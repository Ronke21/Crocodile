<text>was a Japanese &quot;daimyō&quot; during the Azuchi–Momoyama period through the early Edo period. Heir to a long line of powerful feudal lords in the Tōhoku region, he went on to found the modern-day city of Sendai. An outstanding tactician, he was made all the more iconic for his missing eye, as Masamune was often called &quot;dokuganryū&quot; (独眼竜), or the &quot;One-Eyed Dragon of [[Mutsu Province|Ōshū]]&quot;. 
As a legendary warrior and leader, Masamune is a character in a number of Japanese period dramas.

==Early life and rise==
Date Masamune was born as Bontenmaru (梵天丸) later Tojirō (藤次郎), as the eldest son of Date Terumune, likely born in Yonezawa Castle (in modern Yamagata Prefecture). At the age of 14 in 1581, Masamune led his first campaign, helping his father fight the Sōma clan. His buddhist name is “Zuiganjiden Teizan Zenri Daikoji”. In 1584, at the age of 17, Masamune succeeded his father, Terumune, who chose to retire from his position as &quot;daimyō&quot;. Masamune&#x27;s army was recognized by its black armor and golden headgear.

Masamune is known for a few things that made him stand out from other &quot;daimyō&quot; of the time. In particular, his famous crescent-moon-bearing helmet won him a fearsome reputation. As a child, smallpox robbed him of sight in his right eye, though it is unclear exactly how he lost the organ entirely. Various theories behind the eye&#x27;s condition exist. Some sources say he plucked out the eye himself when a senior member of the clan pointed out that an enemy could grab it in a fight. Others say that he had his trusted retainer Katakura Kojūrō gouge out the eye for him, making him the &quot;One-Eyed Dragon&quot; of Ōshu.

The Date clan had built alliances with neighboring clans through marriages over previous generations, but local disputes remained commonplace. Shortly after Masamune&#x27;s succession in 1584, a Date retainer named Ōuchi Sadatsuna defected to the Ashina clan of the Aizu region. Masamune declared war on Ōuchi and the Ashina for this betrayal, and started a campaign to hunt down Sadatsuna. Formerly amicable alliances were cast aside as he began to attack and conquer the lands of Sadatsuna&#x27;s allies in pursuit, even those of his kin in Mutsu and Dewa Province.

In the winter of 1585, one of these allies, Nihonmatsu Yoshitsugu felt defeat was approaching and chose to surrender to the Date instead. Masamune agreed to accept the surrender, but on the heavy condition that the Nihonmatsu give up most of their territory to the Date. This resulted in Yoshitsugu kidnapping Masamune&#x27;s father Terumune during their meeting in Miyamori Castle, where Terumune was staying during the time. The incident ended with Terumune and Yoshitsugu killed as the fleeing Nihonmatsu party clashed with the pursuing Date troops near the Abukuma River.

Due to the death of Date Terumune by the hands of Nihonmatsu Yoshitsugu, Masamune swore vengeance. In January 1586, Masamune had his revenge by launching an attack against the Nihonmatsu at the Battle of Hitotoribashi.
The following year, Date Masamune once again attacked Nihonmatsu at Battle of Koriyama in 1588, The son of Hatakeyama Yoshitsugu set the castle on fire and fled to Aizu. 
Various records of the event exist, although they present different accounts of its circumstances.
In 1589, the Date clan fought many battles with their neighbours afterwards, including the Siege of Kurokawa and Battle of Suriagehara against Ashina clan. 
After defeating the Ashina clan, Masamune made Kurokawa Castle in Aizu domain his base of operations. Later, Masamune fought in the Siege of Sukagawa and defeated Nikaidō clan. In the end 1589, Masamune sealed the Date clan&#x27;s hegemony over southern Mutsu Province.

== Service under Hideyoshi ==
In 1590, Toyotomi Hideyoshi seized Odawara Castle and compelled the Tōhoku-region &quot;daimyō&quot; to participate in the campaign. Although Masamune refused Hideyoshi&#x27;s demands at first, he had no real choice in the matter since Hideyoshi was the virtual ruler of Japan. Masamune still delayed, infuriating Hideyoshi. Expecting to be executed, Masamune, wearing his finest clothes and showing no fear, faced his angry overlord. Not wanting further trouble, Hideyoshi spared his life, saying that &quot;He could be of some use.&quot;

Being a major power in northern Japan, Masamune was naturally viewed with suspicion, as any potential rival would be viewed. Toyotomi Hideyoshi reduced the size of his land holdings after his tardiness in coming to the Siege of Odawara against Hōjō Ujimasa.

In 1591, Masamune forfeited the ancestral land of the Date Clan (present day Date City, Kawamata, Koori, and Kunimi) to Hideyoshi, causing widespread riots. He never regained the territory.

After he fought against Kunohe Rebellion, he was given Iwatesawa and the surrounding lands as his home domain. Masamune moved there, rebuilt the Iwatesawa Castle, renamed it Iwadeyama, and encouraged the growth of a town at its base. Masamune stayed at Iwadeyama for 13 years and turned the region into a major political and economic center.

He and his men served with distinction in the Hideyoshi Korean invasions In 1592–1598.

== Service under Ieyasu ==
In 1598, after Hideyoshi&#x27;s death, Masamune began to support Tokugawa Ieyasu—apparently at the advice of Katakura Kojūrō. Tokugawa Ieyasu increased the size of his lands again, but was constantly suspicious of Masamune and his policies. Although Tokugawa Ieyasu and other Date allies were always suspicious of him, Date Masamune for the most part served the Tokugawa loyally.

In 1600, under Tokugawa eastern army, he fought in Sekigahara Campaign at Siege of Shiroishi and Siege of Hasedo. Later, Tokugawa Ieyasu awarded Masamune the lordship of the huge and profitable Sendai Domain, which made Masamune one of Japan&#x27;s most powerful &quot;daimyō&quot;. Tokugawa had promised Masamune a one-million &quot;koku&quot; domain, but, even after substantial improvements were made, the land only produced 640,000 &quot;koku&quot;, most of which was used to feed the Edo region.

In 1604, Masamune, accompanied by 52,000 vassals and their families, moved to what was then the small fishing village of Sendai. He left his fourth son, Date Muneyasu, to rule Iwadeyama. Masamune would turn Sendai into a large and prosperous city.

In 1614 and 1615, he fought in the Osaka campaigns against the Toyotomi Clan.

Later in 1616, when Tokugawa Ieyasu was on his deathbed, Masamune visited him and read him a piece of Zen poetry. Masamune was highly respected for his ethics; a still-quoted aphorism is, &quot;Rectitude carried to excess hardens into stiffness; benevolence indulged beyond measure sinks into weakness.&quot;

==Later years and death==
Masamune was viewed with caution by Ieyasu and Hidetada, but gained trust during the reign of Iemitsu. As someone who did not experience the Warring States period, Iemitsu had a fondness for hearing stories from the warlords who lived during that time, such as Masamune and Tachibana Muneshige. In 1636, Masamune died of a combination of esophageal cancer and peritonitis at the age of 68 years. He was returned to Sendai in the same daimyō procession as when he was alive. The bakufu gave approval for his eldest legitimate son, Date Tadamune, to inherit the Date clan territory.

== Patron of culture and Christianity ==

Masamune expanded trade in the northeastern Tōhoku region. Although initially faced with attacks by hostile clans, he managed to overcome them after a few defeats and eventually ruled one of the largest fiefdoms of the later Tokugawa shogunate. He built many palaces and worked on many projects to beautify the region. He is also known to have encouraged foreigners to come to his land. Even though he funded and promoted an envoy to establish relations with the Pope in Rome, he was likely motivated at least in part by a desire for foreign technology, similar to that of other lords, such as Oda Nobunaga. Further, once Tokugawa Ieyasu outlawed Christianity, Masamune reversed his position, and though disliking it, let Ieyasu persecute Christians in his domain. For 270 years, Tōhoku remained a place of tourism, trade, and prosperity. Matsushima, for instance, a series of tiny islands, was praised for its beauty and serenity by the wandering haiku poet Matsuo Bashō.

He showed sympathy for Christian missionaries and traders in Japan. In addition to allowing them to come and preach in his province, he also released the prisoner and missionary Padre Sotelo from the hands of Tokugawa Ieyasu. Date Masamune allowed Sotelo as well as other missionaries to practice their religion and win converts in Tōhoku.
Masamune notably funded and backed one of Japan&#x27;s few journeys of far-flung diplomacy and exploration in this period. He ordered the building of the exploration ship &quot;San Juan Bautista&quot;, using foreign (European) ship-building techniques. He sent one of his retainers, Hasekura Tsunenaga, Sotelo, and an embassy numbering 180 on a successful voyage to establish relations with the Pope in Rome. This expedition visited such places as the Philippines, Mexico, Spain and Rome. Previously, Japanese lords had never funded this sort of venture, so it was probably the first successful voyage. At least five members of the expedition stayed in Coria (Seville) of Spain to avoid the persecution of Christians in Japan. 600 of their descendants, with the surname Japón (Japan), are now living in Spain.

When the Tokugawa government banned Christianity, Masamune had to obey the law. However, some sources suggest that Masamune&#x27;s eldest daughter, Irohahime, was a Christian.

== In popular culture ==

Like many figures of the Sengoku period, Date Masamune has been featured in literature, film, manga, anime, video games, and other media. There are a few prominent and notable examples. In the Iver P. Cooper &quot;1632&quot; series book &quot;1636: Seas of Fortune&quot;, Masamune is a prominent character in the short novel &quot;Rising Sun&quot; which is set in the North Pacific region focusing on Japan&#x27;s expansion into North America.

Masamune is the protagonist of the anime series &quot;Masamune Datenicle&quot;, produced by the city of Date in collaboration with Fukushima Gainax in order to promote the city&#x27;s historic connection to the Date Clan. In this series, he is depicted as a child taking on the role of leader of his clan for the first time. Previous leaders of the Date Clan manifest in order to help him prepare for his first battle.

In the video game series &quot;Samurai Warriors&quot; (Koei) Masamune Date is featured as a playable character. In his first appearance, he was a very young man and fought with dual wooden swords, later, his appearance was changed to be a bit older and his weapons were switched out for a more European style sword and a pair of pistols. He is also a prominent character in the &quot;Sengoku Basara&quot; series (Capcom), and has been featured in every major release, portrayed as a reckless, but astute general with a penchant for using humorous English verses, he is also notable for carrying six katanas, which he can equip as &quot;dragon&#x27;s claws&quot;, wielding them between his fingers, three in each hand.

The professional wrestling organization Osaka Pro Wrestling featured two wrestlers using the ring names Masamune and Hideyoshi, who together form the tag team &quot;Sengoku&quot;.

In &quot;Oda Cinnamon Nobunaga&quot;, Masamune is reincarnated as a French bulldog nicknamed Boo in modern-day Japan.

In &quot;Ginga Densetsu Weed: Orion&quot;, Masamune&#x27;s dog version is the main antagonist. His father, Terumune and Kojuuruu also play roles in the comic.

In the popular Netflix miniseries &quot;Age of Samurai: Battle for Japan&quot;, Date Masamune is portrayed by actor Hideaki Itō.

In the video game &quot;Persona 5 Strikers&quot; (known as &quot;Persona 5 Scramble: The Phantom Strikers&quot; in Japan), Masamune is referenced multiple times upon the cast arriving in Sendai. The statue at Aobayama Park is visited immediately upon arriving in the city, and a shrine that appears similar to his gravesite also appears.

In the video game &quot;&quot;, the protagonist, Kaname Date, has his left eye removed prior to the game&#x27;s story, which is likely a reference to Masamune, himself.

Ken Watanabe played the role of Date Masamune in the 1987 NHK Taiga drama Dokuganryū Masamune.

Date Masamune is also a route character in the &quot;Ikemen Sengoku otome game&quot;.

<text>A bass-baritone is a high-lying bass or low-lying &quot;classical&quot; baritone voice type which shares certain qualities with the true baritone voice. The term arose in the late 19th century to describe the particular type of voice required to sing three Wagnerian roles: the title role in &quot;Der fliegende Holländer&quot;, Wotan/Der Wanderer in the &quot;Ring Cycle&quot; and Hans Sachs in &quot;Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg&quot;. Wagner labelled these roles as &quot;Hoher Bass&quot; (&quot;high bass&quot;)—see fach for more details.

The bass-baritone voice is distinguished by two attributes. First, it must be capable of singing comfortably in a baritonal tessitura. Secondly, however, it needs to have the ripely resonant lower range typically associated with the bass voice. For example, the role of Wotan in &quot;Die Walküre&quot; covers the range from F2 (the F at the bottom of the bass clef) to F4 (the F above middle C), but only infrequently descends beyond C3 (the C below middle C). Bass-baritones are typically divided into two separate categories: lyric bass-baritone and dramatic bass-baritone.

Bass-baritones should not be confused with their vocal cousin—the so-called Verdi baritone. This type of Italianate baritone voice has a brighter tone colour and sings at a slightly higher tessitura than that possessed by the bass-baritone. In addition to the operas of Giuseppe Verdi, its natural home is to be found in operatic music composed after about 1830 by the likes of Donizetti, Ponchielli, Massenet, Puccini and the verismo composers.

The term bass-baritone is roughly synonymous with the Italian vocal classification basso cantante; for example, in the Verdian repertoire, Philip II in &quot;Don Carlos&quot; is usually taken by a bass-baritone, while Ferrando in &quot;Il trovatore&quot; is sung by a true bass, though the two roles&#x27; ranges are very similar. In Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot; the role of Golaud, created by Hector Dufranne, sits between Pelléas (high baritone) and Arkel (bass). Some of the classical Mozart baritone roles such as Don Giovanni, Count Almaviva, and Gugliemo—composed before the term &quot;baritone&quot; gained currency—are occasionally played by a bass-baritone.

Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s Savoy operas usually featured a comic bass-baritone character, created to make use of D&#x27;Oyly Carte company member Richard Temple.

In short: the &quot;bass-baritone&quot; is a voice that has the resonant low notes of the typical bass allied with the ability to sing in a baritonal tessitura. Colloquially, it refers to a voice with a range and tone somewhere between a bass and a baritone.

The bass-baritone&#x27;s required range can vary tremendously based on the role, with some less demanding than others. Many bass-baritones have ventured into the baritone repertoire, including (among others) Leopold Demuth, Georges Baklanoff, Rudolf Bockelmann, George London, Thomas Quasthoff, Thomas Stewart, James Morris, and Bryn Terfel.

<text>[[Viscount]] was a Japanese samurai and admiral of the Tokugawa navy of Bakumatsu period Japan, who remained faithful to the Tokugawa shogunate and fought against the new Meiji government until the end of the Boshin War. He later served in the Meiji government as one of the founders of the Imperial Japanese Navy.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Enomoto was born as a member of a samurai family in the direct service of the Tokugawa clan in the Shitaya district of Edo (modern Taitō, Tokyo). Enomoto started learning Dutch in the 1850s, and after Japan&#x27;s forced &quot;opening&quot; by Commodore Matthew Perry in 1854, he studied at the Tokugawa shogunate&#x27;s Naval Training Center in Nagasaki and at the Tsukiji Warship Training Center in Edo.

At the age of 26, Enomoto was sent to the Netherlands to study western techniques in naval warfare and to procure western technologies. He stayed in Europe from 1862 to 1867, and became fluent in both the Dutch and English languages.

Enomoto returned to Japan on board the , a steam warship purchased from the Netherlands by the Shogunal government. During his stay in Europe, Enomoto had realized that the telegraph would be an important means of communication in the future, and started planning a system to connect Edo and Yokohama. Upon his return, Enomoto was promoted to , the second highest rank in the Tokugawa Navy, at the age of 31. He also received the court title of .

===Boshin War and Meiji Restoration===
During the Meiji Restoration, after the surrender of Edo in 1868 during the Boshin War to forces loyal to the Satchō Alliance, Enomoto refused to deliver up his warships, and escaped to Hakodate in Hokkaido with the remainder of the Tokugawa Navy and a handful of French military advisers and their leader Jules Brunet. His fleet of eight steam warships was the strongest in Japan at the time.

Enomoto hoped to create an independent country under the rule of the Tokugawa family in Hokkaidō, but the Meiji government refused to accept partition of Japan. On 27 January 1869, the Tokugawa loyalists declared the foundation of the Republic of Ezo and elected Enomoto as president.

The Meiji government forces engaged and defeated Enomoto&#x27;s forces in the Naval Battle of Hakodate in May 1869. Following the Battle of Hakodate on 27 June 1869, the Republic of Ezo collapsed, and Hokkaidō came under the rule of the central government headed by the Meiji Emperor.

===As a Meiji politician===

After his surrender, Enomoto was arrested, accused of high treason and imprisoned. However, the leaders of the new Meiji government (largely at the insistence of Kuroda Kiyotaka) realized that Enomoto&#x27;s various talents and accumulated knowledge could be of use, and pardoned him in 1872. Enomoto became one of the few former Tokugawa loyalists who made the transition to the new ruling elite, as politics at the time was dominated by men from Chōshū and Satsuma, who had a strong bias against outsiders in general, and former Tokugawa retainers in particular. However, Enomoto was an exception, and rose quickly within the new ruling clique, to a higher status than any other member of the former Tokugawa administrations.

In 1874, Enomoto was given the rank of vice-admiral in the fledgling Imperial Japanese Navy. The following year, he was sent to Russia as a special envoy to negotiate the Treaty of St. Petersburg. The successful conclusion of the treaty was very well received in Japan and further raised Enomoto&#x27;s prestige within the ruling circles, and the fact that Enomoto had been chosen for such an important mission was seen as evidence of reconciliation between former foes in the government.

In 1880, Enomoto became . In 1885, his diplomatic skills were again called upon to assist Itō Hirobumi in concluding the Convention of Tientsin with Qing China. Afterwards, Enomoto held a series of high posts in the Japanese government. He was Japan&#x27;s first Minister of Communications (1885–1888) after the introduction of the cabinet system in 1885. He was also Minister of Agriculture and Commerce from 1894 to 1897, Minister of Education from 1889 to 1890 and Foreign Minister from 1891 to 1892.

In 1887, Enomoto was ennobled to the rank of viscount under the &quot;kazoku&quot; peerage system, and was selected as a member of the Privy Council.

Enomoto was especially active in promoting Japanese emigration through settler colonies in the Pacific Ocean and South and Central America. In 1891, he established—against the will of the cabinet of Matsukata Masayoshi—a &quot;section for emigration&quot; in the Foreign Ministry, with the task of encouraging emigration and finding new potential territories for Japanese settlement overseas. Two years later, after leaving the government, Enomoto also helped to establish a private organization, the &quot;Colonial Association&quot;, to promote external trade and emigration.

==Death==
Enomoto died in 1908 at the age of 72. His grave is at the temple of Kisshō-ji, Bunkyō-ku, Tokyo ().

<text>The prime minister of Japan is the country&#x27;s head of government and the leader of the Cabinet. This is a list of prime ministers of Japan, from when the first Japanese prime minister (in the modern sense), Itō Hirobumi, took office in 1885, until the present day.

32 prime ministers under the Meiji Constitution had a mandate from the Emperor. The &quot;electoral mandates&quot; shown are for the House of Representatives, the lower house of the Imperial Diet, which was not constitutionally guaranteed to have any influence on the appointment of the prime minister.

The prime minister under the Constitution of Japan is designated from among the members of the National Diet, and appointed by the Emperor after being nominated by the National Diet.

The prime ministership of Prince Naruhiko Higashikuni, who was prime minister for fifty-four days in 1945, was the shortest in Japanese history. Shinzo Abe served the longest, with eight years over two non-consecutive periods.

The current prime minister is Shigeru Ishiba, who assumed office on 1 October 2024. There are currently eleven living former prime ministers. The most recent former prime minister to die, Shinzo Abe, was assassinated on 8 July 2022.

==From 1871 to 1885==
The office of daijō-daijin (太政大臣, chancellor of the realm) was the equivalent of what would become the office of prime minister. It was an ancient role which had been discontinued in the 18th century and was briefly revived during the Meiji era.

===Daijō-daijin (chancellor of the realm)===
The office of Daijō-daijin was abolished in December 1885 with the appointment of Itō Hirobumi in the new position of prime minister of Japan (内閣総理大臣, Naikaku Sōri-Daijin).

<text>Cool as Ice is a 1991 American musical teen drama film, directed by David Kellogg, written by David Stenn and starring rapper Vanilla Ice in his feature film debut. The plot focuses on Johnny Van Owen, a freewheeling, motorcycle-riding rapper who arrives in a small town and meets Kathy, an honor student who catches his eye. Meanwhile, Kathy&#x27;s father, who is in witness protection, is found by the corrupt police officers he escaped from years ago.

Developed as a vehicle for Vanilla Ice, the film was widely panned by critics, and was a box office bomb, grossing only $1.2 million from a $6 million budget.

==Plot==
Johnny Van Owen is a rapper who drifts from city to city. Johnny is performing at a nightclub, rapping and dancing with his crew and a club background singer playing &quot;Cool as Ice (Everybody Get Loose)&quot;.

While the group passes through a small town, Johnny falls for honor student Kathy Winslow. The crew is stranded in the town after a member&#x27;s motorcycle breaks down and has to be left at a local repair shop. While waiting for repairs, Johnny uses the opportunity to see Kathy. She already has a boyfriend named Nick, whom he advises Kathy to dump.

Johnny shows up with his crew at a local club frequented by Kathy and her friends. Noticing that no one was enjoying the live music playing at the club, Johnny and the crew decide to perform a musical number, &quot;People&#x27;s Choice&quot;, by unplugging the other band&#x27;s instruments and taking control, shocking the audience and ending with Johnny sweeping Kathy off her feet, humiliating Nick.

He offers to forgive Kathy and take her home, but she refuses and walks home by herself. Unbeknownst to Kathy, she is stalked by two strange men in a car. She is saved by Johnny, who takes her home. At the club&#x27;s parking lot, a jealous Nick and his friends smash up motorcycles belonging to Johnny&#x27;s friends. Nick&#x27;s friends attack the rapping biker who fights back, leaving Nick and his buddies unconscious and Nick himself in the hospital with a broken nose.

Kathy&#x27;s father, Gordon, becomes suspicious of Johnny, and warns Kathy to stay away from him because they can&#x27;t trust strangers. The next day, Kathy goes for a ride with Johnny against her father&#x27;s wishes. They ride all over town, including a construction site. When they finally return home, they are greeted by an angry Gordon, who coldly warns Johnny to stay away from his daughter.

Gordon, under pressure from his wife Grace, reveals to Kathy the secret of his past—he was once a police officer. They were on the run from two corrupt cops and were able to escape using fabricated documents, explaining why he kept his life a secret from Kathy all these years. Kathy criticizes her father, saying it was not fair that he lied to her in order to protect her, yet refuses to permit her to see a total stranger.

The next day, Johnny agrees to give Tommy, Kathy&#x27;s younger brother, a ride on his bike. They cruise through the streets, and finally back to the Winslow home, where Tommy is later kidnapped. At the repair shop, the crew prepares to leave town since the bike has been repaired, but they tell Johnny to say goodbye to Kathy. When Johnny arrives at the Winslow house, he finds an envelope meant for the family. It turns out to be a message from the crooked cops with Tommy recording it. Fearing the worst, Gordon accuses Johnny of criminal involvement, much to Kathy&#x27;s dismay.

When Kathy asks Johnny to play the tape left behind by the kidnappers, he hears a loud clanging noise from a construction vehicle, revealing the message was recorded at the construction site. The gang ambushes the kidnappers and rescues Tommy. When the police arrive, the gang return Tommy to the Winslows, and Gordon apologizes to Johnny. The rapper tells Kathy he has to move on, but she decides to follow him. Nick arrives in his car, telling Kathy to get used to being a biker chick because she will never see him again. Kathy holds on as Johnny uses the car as a ramp and the two new lovers ride off into the big city.

The film ends with Johnny reaching his destination, rapping &quot;Get Wit It&quot; and dancing with his crew to an audience at a nightclub. Kathy joins him on stage after the show is over, dancing alone in the spotlight.

<text>Jeremiah Murry Burrell (September 1, 1815 – October 1, 1856) was a lawyer and judge in western Pennsylvania, of whom three areas were named for.

In 1835, he started his career as a lawyer in the Westmoreland County seat of Greensburg, and around 1839 bought the rights to the newspaper, 
&quot;Pennsylvania Argus&quot;, which he used to promote his political views as editor. He was receiving national attention for his fiery debates by the early 1840s.

By 1844, he was a surrogate debating for presidential candidate James K. Polk. He served three terms in the Pennsylvania House, until 1848,

He further continued his legal and political career as judge of the Tenth Judicial District of Pennsylvania in 1847, which he held until 1855.

On September 13, 1855, he was appointed judge of the Territorial District of Kansas by President Franklin Pierce, and arrived in court in December 1855, when he had to fight for the right to sit on the bench.

Burrell suffered from malaria, and returned to Greensburg in 1856. He later died of the sickness on October 1, 1856, aged 41.

Today, townships in Indiana County (Burrell), Armstrong County (Burrell), and Westmoreland County (Lower Burrell and Upper Burrell) bear his name.

<doc id="314097" wikidata="Q274498" url="?curid=314097" title="1923 Great Kantō earthquake">
<text>The also known in Japanese as struck the Kantō Plain on the main Japanese island of Honshū at 11:58:32 JST (02:58:32 UTC) on Saturday, September 1, 1923. The immediate effects and ensuing firestorms destroyed the Japanese capital city of Tokyo and killed more than 100,000 people, making it one of the deadliest recorded earthquakes.

Varied accounts indicate the duration of the earthquake was between four and ten minutes. The earthquake had a magnitude that ranges between 7.9 to 8.2 on the moment magnitude scale (), with its focus deep beneath Izu Ōshima Island in Sagami Bay. The cause was a rupture of part of the convergent boundary where the Philippine Sea plate is subducting beneath the Okhotsk microplate along the line of the Sagami Trough. 

In the immediate aftermath of the earthquake, the Kantō Massacre began. Rumors emerged that ethnic Koreans in Japan had poisoned wells or were planning to attack cities. In response, the Japanese police and bands of armed vigilantes killed ethnic Korean civilians and anyone they suspected of being Korean. Estimates of the death toll from the massacre vary, with most third-party sources citing fatalities ranging from 6,000 to 10,000.

The earthquake had long lasting effects on Japanese society. It increased Japan&#x27;s drift towards militarization, which would contribute to World War II. It led to the 1927 Shōwa financial crisis, and a resurgence in typhoid fever. Since 1960, September 1 has been designated by the Japanese government as , or a day in remembrance of and to prepare for major natural disasters including tsunami and typhoons.

==Earthquake==
The SS &quot;Dongola&quot; captain reported that, while he was anchored in Yokohama&#x27;s inner harbor:
This earthquake devastated Tokyo, the port city of Yokohama, and the surrounding prefectures of Chiba, Kanagawa, and Shizuoka, and caused widespread damage throughout the Kantō region. The earthquake&#x27;s force was so great that in Kamakura, over from the epicenter, it moved the Great Buddha statue, which weighs about 121 tonnes, almost 60 centimeters.

Estimated casualties totaled about 142,800 deaths, including about 40,000 who went missing and were presumed dead. According to the Japanese construction company Kajima Kobori Research&#x27;s conclusive report of September 2004, 105,385 deaths were confirmed in the 1923 quake.

The damage from this natural disaster was one of the greatest sustained by Imperial Japan. In 1960, on the 37th anniversary of the quake, the government declared September 1 an annual &quot;Disaster Prevention Day&quot;.

=== Damage and deaths ===
Because the earthquake struck when people were cooking meals, many were killed as a result of large fires that broke out. Fires started immediately after the earthquake. Some fires developed into firestorms that swept across cities. Many people died when their feet became stuck on melting tarmac. The single greatest loss of life was caused by a fire whirl that engulfed the Rikugun Honjo Hifukusho (formerly the Army Clothing Depot) in downtown Tokyo, where about 38,000 people who had taken shelter there during the earthquake were incinerated. The earthquake broke water mains all over the city, and putting out the fires took until late in the morning of September 3, nearly two full days.

A strong typhoon centered off the coast of the Noto Peninsula in Ishikawa Prefecture brought high winds to Tokyo Bay at about the same time as the earthquake. These winds caused fires to spread rapidly.

Emperor Taishō and Empress Teimei were staying at Nikko when the earthquake struck Tokyo, and were never in any danger. American Acting Consul General Max David Kirjassoff and his wife Alice Josephine Ballantine Kirjassoff died in the earthquake. The consulate itself lost the entirety of its records in the subsequent fires.

Many homes were buried or swept away by landslides in the mountainous and hilly coastal areas in western Kanagawa Prefecture; about 800 people died. A collapsing mountainside in the village of Nebukawa, west of Odawara, pushed the entire village and a passenger train carrying over 100 passengers, along with the railway station, into the sea.

The RMS &quot;Empress of Australia&quot; was about to leave Yokohama harbor when the earthquake struck. It narrowly survived and assisted in rescuing 2,000 survivors. A P&amp;O liner, &quot; Dongola&quot;, was also in the harbor at the moment of disaster and rescued 505 people, taking them to Kobe.

A tsunami with waves up to high struck the coast of Sagami Bay, Bōsō Peninsula, Izu Islands, and the east coast of Izu Peninsula within minutes. The tsunami caused many deaths, including about 100 people along Yui-ga-hama Beach in Kamakura and an estimated 50 people on the Enoshima causeway. Over 570,000 homes were destroyed, leaving an estimated 1.9 million homeless. Evacuees were transported by ship from Kantō to as far as Kobe in Kansai. The damage is estimated to have exceeded US$1 billion (or about $ billion today). There were 57 aftershocks.

=== Ensuing violence ===

Ethnic Koreans were massacred after the earthquake. The Home Ministry declared martial law and ordered all sectional police chiefs to make maintenance of order and security a top priority. A false rumor was spread that Koreans were taking advantage of the disaster, committing arson and robbery, and were in possession of bombs. Anti-Korean sentiment was heightened by fear of the Korean independence movement. In the confusion after the quake, mass murder of Koreans by mobs occurred in urban Tokyo and Yokohama, fueled by rumors of rebellion and sabotage. The government reported that 231 Koreans were killed by mobs in Tokyo and Yokohama in the first week of September. Independent reports said the number of dead was far higher, ranging from 6,000 to 10,000. Some newspapers reported the rumors as fact, including the allegation that Koreans were poisoning wells. The numerous fires and cloudy well water, a little-known effect of a large quake, all seemed to confirm the rumors of the panic-stricken survivors who were living amidst the rubble. Vigilante groups set up roadblocks in cities, and tested civilians with a shibboleth for supposedly Korean-accented Japanese: deporting, beating, or killing those who failed. Army and police personnel colluded in the vigilante killings in some areas. Of the 3,000 Koreans taken into custody at the Army Cavalry Regiment base in Narashino, Chiba Prefecture, 10% were killed at the base, or after being released into nearby villages. Moreover, anyone mistakenly identified as Korean, such as Chinese, Ryukyuans, and Japanese speakers of some regional dialects, suffered the same fate. About 700 Chinese, mostly from Wenzhou, were killed. A monument commemorating this was built in 1993 in Wenzhou.
In response, the government called upon the Japanese Army and the police to protect Koreans; 23,715 Koreans were placed in protective custody across Japan, 12,000 in Tokyo alone. The chief of police of Tsurumi (or Kawasaki by some accounts) is reported to have publicly drunk the well water to disprove the rumor that Koreans had been poisoning wells. In some towns, even police stations into which Korean people had escaped were attacked by mobs, whereas in other neighborhoods, civilians took steps to protect them. The Army distributed flyers denying the rumor and warning residents against attacking Koreans, but in many cases, vigilante activity only ceased as a result of Army operations against it. In several documented cases, soldiers and policemen participated in the killings, and in other cases, authorities handed groups of Koreans over to local vigilantes, who proceeded to kill them.

Amidst the mob violence against Koreans in the Kantō Region, regional police and the Imperial Army used the pretext of civil unrest to liquidate political dissidents. Socialists such as (平澤計七), anarchists such as Sakae Ōsugi and Noe Itō, and the Chinese communal leader, (王希天), were abducted and killed by local police and the Imperial Army, who claimed the radicals intended to use the crisis as an opportunity to overthrow the Japanese government.

Director Chongkong Oh made two documentary films about the pogrom: &quot;Hidden Scars: The Massacre of Koreans from the Arakawa River Bank to Shitamachi in Tokyo&quot; (1983) and &quot;The Disposed-of Koreans: The Great Kanto Earthquake and Camp Narashino&quot; (1986). They largely consist of interviews with survivors, witnesses, and perpetrators.

The importance of obtaining and providing accurate information following natural disasters has been emphasized in Japan ever since. Earthquake preparation literature in modern Japan almost always directs citizens to carry a portable radio and use it to listen to reliable information, and not to be misled by rumors in the event of a large earthquake.

== Aftermath ==


Following the devastation of the earthquake, some in the government considered the possibility of moving the capital elsewhere. Proposed sites for the new capital were even discussed.

Japanese commentators interpreted the disaster as an act of divine punishment to admonish the Japanese people for their self-centered, immoral, and extravagant lifestyles. In the long run, the response to the disaster was a strong sense that Japan had been given an unparalleled opportunity to rebuild the city and rebuild Japanese values. In reconstructing the city, the nation, and the Japanese people, the earthquake fostered a culture of catastrophe and reconstruction that amplified discourses of moral degeneracy and national renovation in interwar Japan, fostering a culture of militarism.

After the earthquake, Gotō Shinpei organized a reconstruction plan of Tokyo with modern networks of roads, trains, and public services. Parks were placed all over Tokyo as refuge spots, and public buildings were constructed with stricter standards than private buildings to accommodate refugees. The outbreak of World War II and subsequent destruction severely limited resources.

Frank Lloyd Wright received credit for designing the Imperial Hotel, Tokyo, to withstand the quake, although in fact the building was damaged, though standing, by the shock. The destruction of the US embassy caused Ambassador Cyrus Woods to relocate the embassy to the hotel. Wright&#x27;s structure withstood the anticipated earthquake stresses, and the hotel remained in use until 1968. The innovative design used to construct the Imperial Hotel, and its structural fortitude, inspired the creation of the popular Lincoln Logs toy.

The unfinished battlecruiser &quot;Amagi&quot; was in drydock being converted into an aircraft carrier in Yokosuka in compliance with the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922. The earthquake damaged the ship&#x27;s hull beyond repair, leading it to be scrapped, and the unfinished fast battleship &quot;Kaga&quot; was converted into an aircraft carrier in its place.

In contrast to London, where typhoid fever had been steadily declining since the 1870s, the rate in Tokyo remained high, more so in the upper-class residential northern and western districts than in the densely populated working-class eastern district. An explanation is the decline of waste disposal, which became particularly serious in the northern and western districts when traditional methods of waste disposal collapsed due to urbanization. The 1923 earthquake led to record-high morbidity due to unsanitary conditions following the earthquake, and it prompted the establishment of antityphoid measures and the building of urban infrastructure.

The Honda Point Disaster on the West Coast of the United States, in which seven US Navy destroyers ran aground eight days later, killing 23 sailors, has been attributed in part to navigational errors caused by unusual currents set up by the earthquake in Japan.

==Memory==
Beginning in 1960, every September 1 is designated as Disaster Prevention Day to commemorate the earthquake and remind people of the importance of preparedness, as August and September are the peak of the typhoon season. Schools and public and private organizations host disaster drills. Tokyo is located near a fault zone beneath the Izu Peninsula which, on average, causes a major earthquake about once every 70 years, and is also located near the Sagami Trough, a large subduction zone that has potential for large earthquakes. Every year on this date, schools across Japan take a moment of silence at the precise time the earthquake hit in memory of the lives lost.

Some discreet memorials are located in Yokoamicho Park in Sumida Ward, at the site of the open space in which an estimated 38,000 people were killed by a single fire whirl. The park houses a Buddhist-style memorial hall/museum, a memorial bell donated by Taiwanese Buddhists, a memorial to the victims of World War II Tokyo air raids, and a memorial to the Korean victims of the vigilante killings.

== In fiction ==
=== In written or graphic novels ===
In Hiroshi Aramata&#x27;s historical fantasy novel &quot;Teito Monogatari&quot;, a supernatural explanation is given for the cause of the Great Kantō earthquake, connecting it with the principles of feng shui.

In Yasunari Kawabata&#x27;s 1930 novel &quot;The Scarlet Gang of Asakusa&quot; several chapters deal with the Great Kantō earthquake.

In the TV adaptation of the novel &quot;Pachinko&quot; by Min Jin Lee, a young Hansu escapes Yokohama with his father&#x27;s former yakuza employer, Ryoichi, from the Great Kantō Earthquake. The Great Kantō Earthquake is not featured in the book.

In Oswald Wynd&#x27;s novel &quot;The Ginger Tree&quot;, Mary Mackenzie survives the earthquake, and later bases her clothing-design company in one of the few buildings that remained standing in the aftermath.

In Natsumi&#x27;s short story &quot;Taishō Romance&quot;, about a boy in the Reiwa era who became a pen pal with a Taishō-era girl, the story mentions the Great Kantō earthquake, which causes the boy to be unable to contact her. The short story was adapted into the song &quot;Taishō Roman&quot; by Yoasobi; the music video features a giant clock pointing to 11:58, the time of the earthquake.

=== In TV, film or animation ===
The earthquake is recreated in the 1983 asadora &quot;Oshin&quot;, from episode 114 to 117, showing the financial and human losses the disaster caused, as the new factory Oshin and her husband Ryuzo built is destroyed, and their faithful retainer Genji dies protecting their son Yu. The earthquake becomes a major plot point as it drives the family to move to Saga, to live with Ryuzo&#x27;s parents.

An incident after the Great Kanto earthquake is recreated in the 1998 film, &quot;After Life&quot;, known in Japanese as &quot;Wandafuru Raifu&quot; (or &quot;Wonderful Life&quot;). Directed by Hirokazu Kore-eda, the plot takes place in a way station for those who have just died. The newly deceased will take their happiest memory with them into the afterlife. One of the newly deceased has a memory of being in the woods after the earthquake.

Michiyo Akaishi&#x27;s josei manga &quot;Akatsuki no Aria&quot; features the earthquake in volume 8. Several places frequented by the protagonist Aria Kanbara, like her boarding school and the house of the rich Nishimikado clan that she is an illegitimate member of, become shelters for the wounded and the homeless. Aria&#x27;s birth mother is severely injured by debris and later dies, and this triggers a subplot about Aria&#x27;s own heritage.

In Yuu Watase&#x27;s 2017 josei manga &quot;Fushigi Yûgi Byakko Senki&quot;, the heroine Suzuno Osugi enters &quot;The Universe of the Four Gods&quot; for the first time right after the earthquake: her father Takao, who is dying from injuries he suffered when the family house fatally collapsed on him and Suzuno&#x27;s mother Tamayo, orders her to do so, so she will survive the disaster and its aftermath. After a brief time there, she&#x27;s sent back to the already destroyed Tokyo, and she, alongside her soon-to-be love interest Seiji Horie and two young boys named Hideo and Kenichi, is taken in by a friend of the late Takao, Dr. Oikawa.

Waki Yamato&#x27;s manga &quot;Haikara-san ga Tōru&quot; actually reaches its climax after the Great Kantō earthquake—which happens right before the wedding of the female lead, Benio Hanamura, and her second love Tousei. Benio barely survives when the Christian church she&#x27;s getting married in collapses, and then she finds her long-lost love Shinobu whose other love interest Larissa is among the victims; they get back together, and Tousei allows them to.

In Makiko Hirata&#x27;s josei manga and anime &quot;Kasei Yakyoku&quot; the story finishes some time after the earthquake, as a corollary to the main love triangle between the noblewoman Akiko Hashou, her lover Taka Itou, and Akiko&#x27;s personal maid Sara Uchida. The earthquake happens just as the marriage between Akiko and her fiancé Kiyosu Saionji is announced. Sara is in the streets, and Taka is taking Sara&#x27;s brother Junichirou to a hospital after he was injured in a yakuza-related incident. The Hashou&#x27;s mansion is destroyed, leading to an emotional confrontation between Akiko and Saionji; meanwhile, Sara&#x27;s humble house in the suburbia is also destroyed and her and Junichirou&#x27;s mother dies of injuries she sustained in the earthquake.

Maurice Tourneur&#x27;s 1924 silent film &quot;Torment&quot; has an earthquake in Yokohama in its plot, and uses footage of the Kantō earthquake in the film.

The earthquake is the climax of the second episdode of the 1991 OVA &quot;Doomed Megalopolis&quot;.

In the 2013 animated film by director Hayao Miyazaki, &quot;The Wind Rises&quot;, the protagonist Jiro Horikoshi is traveling to Tokyo by train to study engineering. On the way, the 1923 earthquake strikes, damaging the train and causing a huge fire in the city.

In the 2022 animated film &quot;Suzume no Tojimari&quot;, directed by Makoto Shinkai, the earthquake is briefly alluded to in a segment recounting Tokyo&#x27;s devastation 100 years prior.

<text>Ignipuncture (Latin: &quot;Ignis&quot; (fire) + &quot;puncture&quot;) is the procedure of closing a retinal separation by transfixation of the break via cauterization. The procedure was pioneered and named by Jules Gonin in the early 1900s. Due to the risk of severe complications and the advent of lasers for the controlled delivery of energy, ignipuncture became an obsolete procedure; since the 1980s, ignipuncture has been performed using safer techniques like endophotocoagulation.

<text>Ichthyosauria is an order of large extinct marine reptiles sometimes referred to as &quot;ichthyosaurs&quot;, although the term is also used for wider clades in which the order resides.

Ichthyosaurians thrived during much of the Mesozoic era; based on fossil evidence, they first appeared around 250 million years ago (Ma) and at least one species survived until about 90 million years ago, into the Late Cretaceous. During the Early Triassic epoch, ichthyosaurs and other ichthyosauromorphs evolved from a group of unidentified land reptiles that returned to the sea, in a development similar to how the mammalian land-dwelling ancestors of modern-day dolphins and whales returned to the sea millions of years later, which they gradually came to resemble in a case of convergent evolution. Ichthyosaurians were particularly abundant in the Late Triassic and Early Jurassic periods, until they were replaced as the top aquatic predators by another marine reptilian group, the Plesiosauria, in the later Jurassic and Early Cretaceous, though previous views of ichthyosaur decline during this period are probably overstated. Ichthyosaurians diversity declined due to environmental volatility caused by climatic upheavals in the early Late Cretaceous, becoming extinct around the Cenomanian-Turonian boundary approximately 90 million years ago.

Scientists became aware of the existence of ichthyosaurians during the early 19th century, when the first complete skeletons were found in England. In 1834, the order Ichthyosauria was named. Later that century, many finely preserved ichthyosaurian fossils were discovered in Germany, including soft-tissue remains. Since the late 20th century, there has been a revived interest in the group, leading to an increased number of named ichthyosaurs from all continents, with over fifty genera known.

Ichthyosaurian species varied from in length. Ichthyosaurians resembled both modern fish and dolphins. Their limbs had been fully transformed into flippers, which sometimes contained a very large number of digits and phalanges. At least some species possessed a dorsal fin. Their heads were pointed, and the jaws often were equipped with conical teeth to catch smaller prey. Some species had larger, bladed teeth to attack large animals. The eyes were very large, for deep diving. The neck was short, and later species had a rather stiff trunk. These also had a more vertical tail fin, used for a powerful propulsive stroke. The vertebral column, made of simplified disc-like vertebrae, continued into the lower lobe of the tail fin. Ichthyosaurians were air-breathing, warm-blooded, and bore live young. Many, if not all, species had a layer of blubber for insulation.

Like other ancient marine reptiles, such as those in the clades Mosasauria and Plesiosauria, the genera in Ichthyosauria are not part of the clade Dinosauria.

==History of discoveries==

===Early finds===
The first known illustrations of ichthyosaur bones, vertebrae, and limb elements were published by the Welshman Edward Lhuyd in his of 1699. Lhuyd thought that they represented fish remains. In 1708, the Swiss naturalist Johann Jakob Scheuchzer described two ichthyosaur vertebrae assuming they belonged to a man drowned in the Universal Deluge. In 1766, an ichthyosaur jaw with teeth was found at Weston near Bath. In 1783, this piece was exhibited by the Society for Promoting Natural History as those of a crocodilian. In 1779, ichthyosaur bones were illustrated in John Walcott&#x27;s &quot;Descriptions and Figures of Petrifications&quot;. Towards the end of the eighteenth century, British fossil collections quickly increased in size. Those of the naturalists Ashton Lever and John Hunter were acquired in their totality by museums; later, it was established that they contained dozens of ichthyosaur bones and teeth. The bones had typically been labelled as belonging to fish, dolphins, or crocodiles; the teeth had been seen as those of sea lions.

The demand by collectors led to more intense commercial digging activities. In the early nineteenth century, this resulted in the discovery of more complete skeletons. In 1804, Edward Donovan at St Donats uncovered a ichthyosaur specimen containing a jaw, vertebrae, ribs, and a shoulder girdle. It was considered to be a giant lizard. In October 1805, a newspaper article reported the find of two additional skeletons, one discovered at Weston by Jacob Wilkinson, the other, at the same village, by Reverend Peter Hawker. In 1807, the last specimen was described by the latter&#x27;s cousin, Joseph Hawker. This specimen thus gained some fame among geologists as &#x27;Hawker&#x27;s Crocodile&#x27;. In 1810, near Stratford-upon-Avon, an ichthyosaur jaw was found that was combined with plesiosaur bones to obtain a more complete specimen, indicating that the distinctive nature of ichthyosaurs was not yet understood, awaiting the discovery of far better fossils.

===The first complete skeletons===

In 1811, in Lyme Regis, along the Jurassic Coast of Dorset, the first complete ichthyosaur skull was found by Joseph Anning, the brother of Mary Anning, who in 1812 while still a young girl, secured the torso of the same specimen. Their mother, Molly Anning, sold the combined piece to squire Henry Henley for £23. Henley lent the fossil to the London Museum of Natural History of William Bullock. When this museum was closed, the British Museum bought the fossil for a price of £47/5s; it still belongs to the collection of the independent Natural History Museum and has the inventory number NHMUK PV R1158 (formerly BMNH R.1158). It has been identified as a specimen of &quot;Temnodontosaurus platyodon&quot;.
In 1814, the Annings&#x27; specimen was described by Professor Everard Home, in the first scientific publication dedicated to an ichthyosaur. Intrigued by the strange animal, Home tried to locate additional specimens in existing collections. In 1816, he described ichthyosaur fossils owned by William Buckland and James Johnson. In 1818, Home published data obtained by corresponding with naturalists all over Britain. In 1819, he wrote two articles about specimens found by Henry Thomas De la Beche and Thomas James Birch. A last publication of 1820 was dedicated to a discovery by Birch at Lyme Regis. The series of articles by Home covered the entire anatomy of ichthyosaurs, but highlighted details only; a systematic description was still lacking.
Home was very uncertain how the animal should be classified. Though most individual skeletal elements looked very reptilian, the anatomy as a whole resembled that of a fish, so he initially assigned the creature to the fishes, as seemed to be confirmed by the flat shape of the vertebrae. At the same time, he considered it a transitional form between fishes and crocodiles, not in an evolutionary sense, but as regarded its place in the , the &quot;Chain of Being&quot; hierarchically connecting all living creatures. In 1818, Home noted some coincidental similarities between the coracoid of ichthyosaurians and the sternum of the platypus. This induced him to emphasize its status as a transitional form, combining, like the platypus, traits of several larger groups. In 1819, he considered it a form between newts, like the olm, and lizards; he then gave a formal generic name: &quot;Proteo-Saurus&quot;. However, in 1817, Karl Dietrich Eberhard Koenig had already referred to the animal as &quot;Ichthyosaurus&quot;, &quot;fish saurian&quot; from Greek , , &quot;fish&quot;. This name at the time was an invalid and was only published by Koenig in 1825, but was adopted by De la Beche in 1819 in a lecture where he named three &quot;Ichthyosaurus&quot; species. This text would only be published in 1822, just after De la Beche&#x27;s friend William Conybeare published a description of these species, together with a fourth one. The type species was &quot;Ichthyosaurus communis&quot;, based on a lost skeleton. Conybeare considered that &quot;Ichthyosaurus&quot; had priority relative to &quot;Proteosaurus&quot;. Although this is incorrect by modern standards, the latter name became a &quot;forgotten&quot; . In 1821, De la Beche and Conybeare provided the first systematic description of ichthyosaurs, comparing them to another newly identified marine reptile group, the Plesiosauria. Much of this description reflected the insights of their friend, the anatomist Joseph Pentland.

In 1835, the order Ichthyosauria was named by Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville. In 1840, Richard Owen named an order Ichthyopterygia as an alternative concept.

===Popularisation during the 19th century===

The discovery of a hitherto unsuspected extinct group of large marine reptiles generated much publicity, capturing the imagination of both scientists and the public at large. People were fascinated by the strange build of the animals, especially the large scleral rings in the eye sockets, of which it was sometimes erroneously assumed these would have been visible on the living animal. Their bizarre form induced a feeling of alienation, allowing people to realise the immense span of time passed since the era in which the ichthyosaur swam the oceans. Not all were convinced that ichthyosaurs had gone extinct: Reverend George Young found a skeleton in 1819 at Whitby; in his 1821 description, he expressed the hope that living specimens could still be found. Geologist Charles Lyell, to the contrary, assumed that the Earth was eternal so that in the course of time the ichthyosaur might likely reappear, a possibility lampooned in a famous caricature by De la Beche.
Public awareness was increased by the works of the eccentric collector Thomas Hawkins, a pre-Adamite believing that ichthyosaurs were monstrous creations by the devil: &quot;Memoirs of Ichthyosauri and Plesiosauri&quot; of 1834 and &quot;The Book of the Great Sea-Dragons&quot; of 1840. The first work was illustrated by mezzotints by John Samuelson Templeton. These publications also contained scientific descriptions and represented the first textbooks of the subject. In the summer of 1834, Hawkins, after a taxation by William Buckland and Gideon Mantell, sold his extensive collection, then the largest of its kind in the world, to the British Museum. However, curator Koenig quickly discovered that the fossils had been heavily restored with plaster, applied by an Italian artist from Lucca; of the most attractive piece, an &quot;Ichthyosaurus&quot; specimen, almost the entire tail was fake. It turned out that Professor Buckland had been aware of this beforehand, and the museum was forced to reach a settlement with Hawkins, and gave the fake parts a lighter colour to differentiate them from the authentic skeletal elements.
Ichthyosaurs became even more popular in 1854 by the rebuilding at Sydenham Hill of the Crystal Palace, originally erected at the world exhibition of 1851. In the surrounding park, life-sized, painted, concrete statues of extinct animals were placed, which were designed by Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins under the direction of Richard Owen. Among them were three models of an ichthyosaur. Although it was known that ichthyosaurs had been animals of the open seas, they were shown basking on the shore, a convention followed by many nineteenth century illustrations with the aim, as Conybeare once explained, of better exposing their build. This led to the misunderstanding that they really had an amphibious lifestyle. The pools in the park were at the time subjected to tidal changes, so that fluctuations in the water level at intervals submerged the ichthyosaur statues, adding a certain realism. Remarkably, internal skeletal structures, such as the scleral rings and the many phalanges of the flippers, were shown at the outside.

===Later 19th-century finds===

During the nineteenth century, the number of described ichthyosaur genera gradually increased. New finds allowed for a better understanding of their anatomy. Owen had noticed that many fossils showed a downward bend in the rear tail. At first, he explained this as a &quot;post mortem&quot; effect, a tendon pulling the tail end downwards after death. However, after an article on the subject by Philip Grey Egerton, Owen considered the possibility that the oblique section could have supported the lower lobe of a tail fin. This hypothesis was confirmed by new finds from Germany. In the Posidonia Shale at Holzmaden, dating from the early Jurassic, already in the early nineteenth century, the first ichthyosaur skeletons had been found. During the latter half of the century, the rate of discovery increased to a few hundred each year. Ultimately, over four thousand were uncovered, forming the bulk of ichthyosaur specimens displayed. The sites were also a , meaning not only the quantity, but also the quality was exceptional. The skeletons were very complete and often preserved soft tissues, including tail and dorsal fins. Additionally, female individuals were discovered with embryos.

=== 20th century ===
In the early twentieth century, ichthyosaur research was dominated by the German paleontologist Friedrich von Huene, who wrote an extensive series of articles, taking advantage of an easy access to the many specimens found in his country. The amount of anatomical data was hereby vastly increased. Von Huene also travelled widely abroad, describing many fossils from locations outside of Europe. During the 20th century, North America became an important source of new fossils. In 1905, the Saurian Expedition led by John Campbell Merriam and financed by Annie Montague Alexander, found twenty-five specimens in central Nevada, which were under a shallow ocean during the Triassic. Several of these are in the collection of the University of California Museum of Paleontology.

After a slack during the middle of the century, with no new genera being named between the 1930s and the 1970s, the rate of discoveries picked up towards its end. Other specimens are embedded in the rock and visible at Berlin–Ichthyosaur State Park in Nye County. In 1977 the Triassic ichthyosaur &quot;Shonisaurus&quot; became the state fossil of Nevada. About half of the ichthyosaur genera determined to be valid were described after 1990. In 1992 Canadian paleontologist Elizabeth Nicholls uncovered the largest known specimen, a &quot;Shastasaurus&quot;. The new finds have allowed a gradual improvement in knowledge about the anatomy and physiology of what had already been seen as rather advanced &quot;Mesozoic dolphins&quot;. Christopher McGowan published a larger number of articles and also brought the group to the attention of the general public. The new method of cladistics provided a means to exactly calculate the relationships between groups of animals, and in 1999, Ryosuke Motani published the first extensive study on ichthyosaur phylogenetics.

=== 21st century ===
In 2003, McGowan and Motani published the first modern textbook on the Ichthyosauria and their closest relatives. Two jawbones of gigantic ichthyosaur were discovered in 2016 and 2020 in Lilstock and Somerset respectively, UK. Simple scaling would suggest that this ichthyosaur has an estimated total length of up to 26 meters (82 feet), the largest known to date marine reptile. The fossils of this individual were dated to be 202 million-year-old.

== Evolutionary history ==

=== Origin ===
The origin of the ichthyosaurs is contentious. Until recently, clear transitional forms with land-dwelling vertebrate groups had not yet been found, the earliest known species of the ichthyosaur lineage being already fully aquatic. In 2014, a small basal ichthyosauriform from the upper Lower Triassic was described that had been discovered in China with characteristics suggesting an amphibious lifestyle. In 1937, Friedrich von Huene even hypothesised that ichthyosaurs were not reptiles, but instead represented a lineage separately developed from amphibians. Today, this notion has been discarded and a consensus exists that ichthyosaurs are amniote tetrapods, having descended from terrestrial egg-laying amniotes during the late Permian or the earliest Triassic. However, establishing their position within the amniote evolutionary tree has proven difficult, due to their heavily derived morphology obscuring their ancestry. Several conflicting hypotheses have been posited on the subject. In the second half of the 20th century, ichthyosaurs were usually assumed to be of the Anapsida, seen as an early branch of &quot;primitive&quot; reptiles. This would explain the early appearance of ichthyosaurs in the fossil record, and also their lack of clear affinities with other reptile groups, as anapsids were supposed to be little specialised. This hypothesis has become unpopular for being inherently vague because Anapsida is an unnatural, paraphyletic group. Modern exact quantitative cladistic analyses consistently indicate that ichthyosaurs are members of the clade Diapsida. Some studies showed a basal, or low, position in the diapsid tree. More analyses result in their being Neodiapsida, a derived diapsid subgroup.

Since the 1980s, a close relationship was assumed between the Ichthyosauria and the Sauropterygia, another marine reptile group, within an overarching Euryapsida, with one such study in 1997 by John Merck showing them to be monophyletic archosauromorph euryapsids. This has been contested over the years, with the Euryapsida being seen as an unnatural polyphyletic assemblage of reptiles that happen to share some adaptations to a swimming lifestyle. However, more recent studies have shown further support for a monophyletic clade between Ichthyosauromorpha, Sauropterygia, and Thalattosauria as a massive marine clade of aquatic archosauromorphs originating in the Late Permian and diversifying in the Early Triassic.

=== Affinity with the Hupehsuchia ===
Since 1959, a second enigmatic group of ancient sea reptiles is known, the Hupehsuchia. Like the Ichthyopterygia, the Hupehsuchia have pointed snouts and show polydactyly, the possession of more than five fingers or toes. Their limbs more resemble those of land animals, making them appear as a transitional form between these and ichthyosaurs. Initially, this possibility was largely neglected because the Hupehsuchia have a fundamentally different form of propulsion, with an extremely stiffened trunk. The similarities were explained as a case of convergent evolution. Furthermore, the descent of the Hupehsuchia is no less obscure, meaning a possible close relationship would hardly clarify the general evolutionary position of the ichthyosaurs.

In 2014, &quot;Cartorhynchus&quot; was announced, a small species with a short snout, large flippers, and a stiff trunk. Its lifestyle might have been amphibious. Motani found it to be more basal than the Ichthyopterygia and named an encompassing clade Ichthyosauriformes. The latter group was combined with the Hupesuchia into the Ichthyosauromorpha. The ichthyosauromorphs were found to be diapsids.

The proposed relationships are shown by this cladogram:

=== Early Ichthyopterygia ===
The earliest ichthyosaurs are known from the Early and Early-Middle (Olenekian and Anisian) Triassic strata of Canada, China, Japan, and Spitsbergen in Norway, being up to 246 million years old. These first forms included the genera &quot;Chaohusaurus&quot;, &quot;Grippia&quot;, and &quot;Utatsusaurus&quot;. Even older fossils show they were around 250 million years ago, just two million years after the Permian mass extinction. This early diversity suggests an even earlier origin, possibly late Permian. They more resembled finned lizards than the fishes or dolphins to which the later, more familiar species were similar. Their bodies were elongated and they probably used an anguilliform locomotion, swimming by undulations of the entire trunk. Like land animals, their pectoral girdles and pelves were robustly built, and their vertebrae still possessed the usual interlocking processes to support the body against the force of gravity. However, they were already rather advanced in having limbs that had been completely transformed into flippers. They also were probably warm-blooded and viviparous.

These very early &quot;proto-ichthyosaurs&quot; had such a distinctive build compared to &quot;ichthyosaurs proper&quot; that Motani excluded them from the Ichthyosauria and placed them in a basal position in a larger clade, the Ichthyopterygia. However, this solution was not adopted by all researchers.

===Later Triassic forms===
The basal forms quickly gave rise to ichthyosaurs in the narrow sense sometime around the boundary between the Early Triassic and Middle Triassic; the earliest Ichthyosauria in the sense Motani gave to the concept, appear about 245 million years ago. These later diversified into a variety of forms, including the still sea serpent-like &quot;Cymbospondylus&quot;, a problematic form which reached ten metres in length, and smaller, more typical forms like &quot;Mixosaurus&quot;. The Mixosauria were already very fish-like with a pointed skull, a shorter trunk, a more vertical tail fin, a dorsal fin, and short flippers containing many phalanges. The sister group of the Mixosauria were the more advanced Merriamosauria. By the Late Triassic, merriamosaurs consisted of both the large, classic Shastasauria and more advanced, &quot;dolphin-like&quot; Euichthyosauria. Experts disagree over whether these represent an evolutionary continuum, with the less specialised shastosaurs a paraphyletic grade that was evolving into the more advanced forms, or whether the two were separate clades that evolved from a common ancestor earlier on. Euichthyosauria possessed more narrow front flippers, with a reduced number of fingers. Basal euichthyosaurs were &quot;Californosaurus&quot; and &quot;Toretocnemus&quot;. A more derived branch were the Parvipelvia, with a reduced pelvis, basal forms of which are &quot;Hudsonelpidia&quot; and &quot;Macgowania&quot;.

During the Carnian and Norian, Shastosauria reached huge sizes. &quot;Shonisaurus popularis&quot;, known from a number of specimens from the Carnian of Nevada, was long. Norian Shonisauridae are known from both sides of the Pacific. &quot;Himalayasaurus tibetensis&quot; and &quot;Tibetosaurus&quot; (probably a synonym) have been found in Tibet. These large (10- to 15-m-long) ichthyosaurs have by some been placed into the genus &quot;Shonisaurus&quot;.
The gigantic &quot;Shonisaurus sikanniensis&quot; (considered as a shastasaurus between 2011 and 2013) whose remains were found in the Pardonet Formation of British Columbia, has been estimated to be as much as in length. &quot;Ichthyotitan&quot;, found in Somerset, has been estimated to be as much as 26 m long—if correct, the largest marine reptile known to date.

In the Late Triassic, ichthyosaurs attained the peak of their size and diversity. They occupied many ecological niches. Some were apex predators; others were hunters of small prey. Several species perhaps specialised in suction feeding or were ram feeders; also, durophagous forms are known. Towards the end of the Late Triassic, a decline of variability seems to have occurred. The giant species seemed to have disappeared at the end of the Norian. Rhaetian (latest Triassic) ichthyosaurs are known from England, and these are very similar to those of the Early Jurassic. A possible explanation is an increased competition by sharks, Teleostei, and the first Plesiosauria. Like the dinosaurs, the ichthyosaurs and their contemporaries, the plesiosaurs, survived the Triassic–Jurassic extinction event, and quickly diversified again to fill the vacant ecological niches of the early Jurassic.

===Jurassic===

During the Early Jurassic, the ichthyosaurs still showed a large variety of species, ranging from in length. Many well-preserved specimens from England and Germany date to this time and well-known genera include &quot;Eurhinosaurus&quot;, &quot;Ichthyosaurus&quot;, &quot;Leptonectes&quot;, &quot;Stenopterygius&quot;, and the large predator &quot;Temnodontosaurus.&quot; More basal parvipelvians like &quot;Suevoleviathan&quot; were also present. The general morphological variability had been strongly reduced, however. Giant forms, suction feeders and durophagous species were absent. Many of these genera possessed streamlined, dolphin-like thunniform bodies, although more basal clades like Eurhinosauria, which include &quot;Leptonectes&quot; and &quot;Eurhinosaurus&quot;, had longer bodies and long snouts.

Few ichthyosaur fossils are known from the Middle Jurassic. This might be a result of the poor fossil record in general of this epoch. The strata of the Late Jurassic seem to indicate that a further decrease in diversity had taken place. From the Middle Jurassic onwards, almost all ichthyosaurs belonged to the thunnosaurian clade Ophthalmosauridae. Represented by the &quot;Ophthalmosaurus&quot; and related genera, they were very similar in general build to &quot;Ichthyosaurus&quot;. The eyes of &quot;Ophthalmosaurus&quot; were huge, and these animals likely hunted in dim and deep water. However, new finds from the Cretaceous indicate that ichthyosaur diversity in the Late Jurassic must have been underestimated.

===Cretaceous===
Traditionally, ichthyosaurs were seen as decreasing in diversity even further with the Cretaceous, though they had a worldwide distribution. All fossils from this period were referred to a single genus: &quot;Platypterygius&quot;. This last ichthyosaur genus was thought to have become extinct early in the late Cretaceous, during the Cenomanian about 95 million years ago, much earlier than other large Mesozoic reptile groups that survived until the very end of the Cretaceous. Two major explanations have been proposed for this extinction including either chance or competition from other large marine predators such as plesiosaurs. The overspecialisation of ichthyosaurs may be a contributing factor to their extinction, possibly being unable to &#x27;keep up&#x27; with fast teleost fish, which had become dominant at this time, against which the sit-and-wait ambush strategies of the mosasauroids proved superior. This model thus emphasised evolutionary stagnation, the only innovation shown by &quot;Platypterygius&quot; being its ten fingers.

Recent studies, however, show that ichthyosaurs were actually far more diverse in the Cretaceous than previously thought. Fragments previously referred to &quot;Platypterygius&quot; have been found to be from several different taxa. As of 2012, at least eight lineages are known to have spanned the Jurassic-Cretaceous boundary including &quot;Acamptonectes&quot;, &quot;Sveltonectes&quot;, &quot;Caypullisaurus&quot;, and &quot;Maiaspondylus&quot;. In 2013, a Cretaceous basal thunnosaurian was revealed: &quot;Malawania&quot;. Indeed, likely a radiation during the Early Cretaceous occurred due to an increase of coastlines when the continents further broke up.

The demise of the ichthyosaurs has been described as a two-step process. A first extinction event in the beginning of the Cenomanian eliminated two of the three ichthyosaur feeding guilds still present: the &#x27;soft-prey specialists&#x27; and the &#x27;generalists&#x27;, leaving only an unspecialized apex predator group. The second extinction event took place during the Cenomanian-Turonian boundary event, a marine &#x27;anoxic event&#x27;, after which just a single lineage survived, &quot;Platypterygius hercynicus&quot;, which then disappeared about 93 million years ago. Ichthyosaur extinction was thus a pair of abrupt events rather than a long decline, probably related to the environmental upheavals and climatic changes in the Cenomanian and Turonian. Competition with early mosasaurs is unlikely to have been a contributing factor since large mosasaurs did not appear until 3 million years after the ichthyosaur extinction, filling the resulting ecological void left by the extinction of ichthyosaurs. Plesiosaurian polycoltylids perhaps also filled some of the niches previously occupied by ichthyosaurs, although they had coexisted for 19 million years. The extinction was most likely the result of ecological change and volatility that caused changes in migration, food availability, and birthing grounds. This part of the Cretaceous was one in which many other marine extinctions occurred, including those of some types of microplankton, ammonites, belemnites, and reef-building bivalves.

==Phylogeny==
In modern phylogeny, clades are defined that contain all species forming a certain branch of the evolutionary tree. This also allows one to clearly indicate all relationships between the several subgroups in a cladogram. In 1999, a node clade Ichthyopterygia was defined by Motani as the group consisting of the last common ancestor of &quot;Ichthyosaurus communis&quot;, &quot;Utatsusaurus hataii&quot; and &quot;Parvinatator wapitiensis&quot;; and all its descendants. Within Motani&#x27;s phylogeny, the Ichthyopterygia were the larger parent clade of a smaller stem clade Ichthyosauria that was defined as the group consisting of &quot;Ichthyosaurus communis&quot; and all species more closely related to &quot;Ichthyosaurus&quot; than to &quot;Grippia longirostris&quot;. Motani&#x27;s concept of the Ichthyosauria was thus more limited than the traditional one that also contained basal forms, such as &quot;Grippia&quot;, &quot;Utatsusaurus&quot;, and &quot;Parvinatator&quot;.

The following cladogram is based on Motani (1999):

An alternative terminology was proposed by Maisch &amp; Matzke in 2000, trying to preserve the traditional, more encompassing content of the concept Ichthyosauria. They defined a node clade Ichthyosauria as the group consisting of the last common ancestor of &quot;Thaisaurus chonglakmanii&quot;, &quot;Utatsusaurus hataii&quot;, and &quot;Ophthalmosaurus icenicus&quot;, and all its descendants. Ichthyosauria &quot;sensu&quot; Motani might materially be identical to a clade that Maisch &amp; Matzke in 2000 called Hueneosauria, depending on the actual relationships.

Cladogram based on Maisch and Matzke (2000) and Maisch and Matzke (2003) with clade names following Maisch (2010):

==Description==

===Size===
Ichthyosaurs averaged about in length. Some individual specimens were as short as ; some species were much larger: the Triassic &quot;Shonisaurus popularis&quot; was about long and in 2004 &quot;Shonisaurus sikanniensis&quot; (classified as a shastasaurus between 2011 and 2013) was estimated to have been in length. Fragmentary finds suggest the presence of a form in the early Jurassic. In 2018, lower jaw fragments from England were reported indicating a length of between 20 and 25 m (66 to 82 ft), which have been recently described as &quot;Ichthyotitan severnensis&quot;. According to weight estimates by Ryosuke Motani a &quot;Stenopterygius&quot; weighed around , whilst a &quot;Ophthalmosaurus icenicus&quot; weighed .

===General build===

While the earliest known members of the ichthyosaur lineage were more eel-like in build, later ichthyosaurs resembled more typical fishes or dolphins, having a dolphin-like head with a short neck and a long snout. Ichthyosaur fore and hind limbs had been fully transformed into flippers. Some species had a dorsal fin on their backs and a more or less vertical caudal fluke at the rear of a rather short tail. Although ichthyosaurs looked like fish, they were not.

Evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould said that the ichthyosaur was his favourite example of convergent evolution, where similarities of structure are analogous, not homologous, thus not caused by a common descent, but by a similar adaptation to an identical environment:This sea-going reptile with terrestrial ancestors converged so strongly on fishes that it actually evolved a dorsal fin and tail in just the right place and with just the right hydrological design. These structures are all the more remarkable because they evolved from nothing—the ancestral terrestrial reptile had no hump on its back or blade on its tail to serve as a precursor.

===Diagnostic traits===
Derived ichthyosaurs in the narrow sense, as defined by Motani in 1999, differ from their closest basal ichthyopterygian relatives in certain traits. Motani listed a number of these. The external nostril is located on the side of the skull, and is hardly visible from above. The upper rim of the eye socket consists of a bone bar formed by the prefrontal and the postfrontal bones. The postorbital in side view is excluded from the supratemporal fenestra. The opening for the parietal eye is located on the border of the parietal and the frontal bone. The lateral wing of the pterygoid is incompletely and variably ossified. The ulna lacks the part behind the original shaft axis. The rear dorsal vertebrae are disc-shaped.

===Skeleton===

====Skull====
Basal Ichthyopterygia already had elongated, triangular skulls. With ichthyosaurs in the narrow sense, their snouts became very pointy. The snout is formed by the premaxilla. The maxilla behind it is usually shorter and sometimes excluded from the external nostril by the rear branch of the premaxilla. Accordingly, the number of premaxillary teeth is high, while the maxillary teeth are fewer in number or even completely absent. The rear top of the snout is formed by the nasal bones. Derived species have a foramen internasale, a midline opening separating the rear of the nasal bones. The nasal bone usually forms the top and front rim of the bony nostril, itself often placed just in front of the eye socket. However, with some Triassic species, the premaxilla is so strongly extended at its back that it even excludes the nasal from the nostril.

The rear of the skull is dominated by a large eye socket, often covering the major part of the rear side surface. In the socket, a large scleral ring is present; this is a circular structure of small, overlapping bone segments protecting the eye against the water pressure. Both in the relative and absolute senses, ichthyosaurs have the largest eye sockets of all known vertebrates. The other rear skull elements are typically so compressed and fused that they are difficult to identify. The top rear element of the skull was usually assumed to be the supratemporal bone, while the squamosal and quadratojugal were sometimes fused. However, in 1968, Alfred Sherwood Romer stated that the presumed supratemporal was in fact the squamosal, an interpretation which was supported by McGowan in 1973. In 1990, though, John Steve Massare convinced most researchers that the original identification had been the correct one after all. The supratemporal forms the rear rim of the supratemporal opening; a lower temporal opening at the side is lacking. The front rim of the supratemporal opening is typically formed by the postfrontal; only with the very basal &quot;Utatsusaurus&quot; the postorbital and the squamosal still reach the edge. Between the paired supratemporal openings, the skull roof is narrow; some species have a longitudinal crest on it as an attachment for the jaw muscles. Basal Ichthyopterygia have a parietal eye opening between the paired parietal bones. With ichthyosaurs proper, this opening moves to the front, first to the border between the parietals and the frontals and ultimately between the frontals, a condition shown by derived species. Postparietal and tabular bones are lacking. Often, the bones of the back of the skull and the palate are incompletely ossified, apparently having partly remained cartilage. The occipital condyle is typically very convex. The stapes, the bone transmitting sound waves from the eardrum to the middle ear, is elongated and not pierced by a foramen. Pterygoid teeth are typically lacking.

====Lower jaws====
Like the snout, the lower jaws are elongated. However, in some species, such as &quot;Eurhinosaurus&quot; and &quot;Excalibosaurus&quot;, the front of the snout far protrudes beyond the lower jaws. While the front of the lower jaw is typically low, its rear depth is very variable. The greater part of the lower jaw is formed by the front dentary, the tooth-bearing bone. At its inner side the dentary is covered by a splenial that extends forwards until the symphysis, the common contact surface where both lower jaws are grown together. The jaw joints do not allow a horizontal chewing movement: they function as simple hinges to vertically open or close the jaws.

====Teeth====
Ichthyosaur teeth are typically conical. Fish-eating species have long and slender tooth crowns that are slightly recurved. Forms specialised in catching larger prey have shorter, broader, and straighter teeth; sometimes, cutting edges are present. &quot;Thalattoarchon&quot;, an apex predator, had larger teeth formed like flattened blades. Durophagous species that ate shellfish have low, convex teeth that are closely packed. Many ichthyosaur dentitions are heterodont, combining several tooth shapes, e.g. small teeth in the front and larger teeth at the rear. The teeth are usually placed in tooth sockets; derived species possess a common tooth groove, a condition known as aulacodonty. In the latter case, adult individuals sometimes become toothless. Teeth in tooth sockets sometimes fuse with the jawbone. With ichthyosaur teeth, the dentine shows prominent vertical wrinkles. Durophagous forms have teeth with deep vertical grooves and wrinkles in the enamel.

====Postcrania====

=====Vertebral column=====

Basal Ichthyopterygia, like their land-dwelling ancestors, still had vertebrae that possessed a full set of processes that allowed them to interlock and articulate, forming a vertebral column supporting the weight of the body. As ichthyosaurs were fully aquatic, their bodies were supported by the Archimedes force exerted by the water; in other words, they were buoyant. Therefore, the vertebral processes had lost much of their function. Early ichthyosaurs proper had rear dorsal vertebrae that had become disc-shaped, like those of typical fishes. With more derived species, the front dorsals also became discs. Gradually, most processes were lost, including those for rib attachment. The vertebral bodies became much shorter. The front and rear sides of the discs were hollowed out, resulting in a so-called amphicoelous condition. A transverse cross-section of such a vertebra has an hourglass shape. This morphology is unique within the Amniota and makes discerning ichthyosaur vertebrae from those of other marine reptiles easy. The only process that kept its function was the spine at the top, serving as an attachment for the dorsal muscles. However, even the spine became a simple structure. The neural arch, of which it was an outgrowth, typically no longer fused to the vertebral centre.

The neck is short, and derived species show a reduction in the number of cervical vertebrae. The short neck positions the skull close to the trunk, usually in a slight oblique elevation to it. Derived species usually also have a reduced number of dorsals, the total of presacral vertebrae totalling about forty to fifty. The vertebral column is little differentiated. Basal Ichthyopterygia still have two sacral vertebrae, but these are not fused. Early Triassic forms have a transversely flattened tail base with high spines for an undulating tail movement. Derived forms have a shorter tail with the characteristic kink at the end; a section of wedge-shaped vertebrae, itself supporting the fleshy upper tail fin lobe, forced the tail end into the lower fin lobe.

As derived species no longer have transversal processes on their vertebrae—again a condition unique in the Amniota—the parapophyseal and diapophysael rib joints have been reduced to flat facets, at least one of which is located on the vertebral body. The number of facets can be one or two; their profile can be circular or oval. Their shape often differs according to the position of the vertebra within the column. The presence of two facets per side does not imply that the rib itself is double-headed: often, even in that case, it has a single head. The ribs typically are very thin and possess a longitudinal groove on both the inner and the outer sides. The lower side of the chest is formed by gastralia. These belly ribs have a single centre segment and one or two outer segments per side. They are not fused into a real plastron. Usually two gastralia are present per dorsal rib.

=====Appendicular skeleton=====
The shoulder girdle of ichthyosaurs is not much modified from its original condition. Some basal forms show a hatchet- or crescent-shaped shoulder blade or scapula; derived forms have an elongated blade positioned on a broader base. The scapula is not fused with the coracoid into a scapulocoracoid, indicating that the forces exerted on the shoulder girdle were moderate. The shoulder joint is positioned on the border between the scapula and the coracoid. Both coracoids are fused on their common midline. The coracoid shape is very variable, but usually it is rather low. The upper part of the shoulder girdle is formed by two long and slender clavicles, crowned by a central interclavicular bone that is large and triangular with basal forms, small and T-shaped in Jurassic species. Breast bones or sterna are absent.

Basal forms have a forelimb that is still functionally differentiated, in some details resembling the arm of their land-dwelling forebears; the ulna and radius are elongated and somewhat separated; the carpals are rounded, allowing the wrist to rotate; the number of phalanges is within the range shown by land animals. Ichthyosaurs proper, to the contrary, have a forelimb that is fully adapted to its function as a flipper. However, the adaptations are very variable. Triassic species typically have a very derived humerus, changed into a disc. Jurassic species tend to have a more elongated humeral form with a rounded head, narrow shaft, and expanded lower end. The radius and ulna are always strongly flattened, but can be circular, with or without notch, or have a waist. Notches can be homologous to the original shafts, but also be newly formed. Jurassic forms no longer have a space, the &quot;spatium interosseum&quot;, between the radius and ulna. Often, the latter bones gradually merge into lower, disc-shaped elements - the up to four carpals which again differ little in form from the up to five metacarpals.

A strongly derived condition show the phalanges, small, disc-shaped elements positioned in long rows. Sometimes, the number of fingers is reduced, to as low as two. This is a rather common phenomenon within the Tetrapoda. Unique, however, for derived tetrapods, is the fact that some species show nonpathological polydactyly, the number of fingers being higher than five. Some species had ten fingers per hand (eg, &quot;Caypullisaurus&quot;). These fingers, again, can have an increased number of phalanges, up to thirty, a phenomenon called hyperphalangy, also known from the Plesiosauria, mosasaurs, and the Cetacea. The high number of elements allows the flipper to be shaped as a hydrofoil. When a high number of fingers is present, their identity is difficult to determine. It is usually assumed that fingers were added at both the front and at the rear, perhaps to a core of four original fingers. If fingers are added, often the number of metacarpals and carpals is also increased; sometimes even an extra lower arm element is present. Earlier, ichthyosaurs were commonly divided into &quot;longipinnate&quot; and &quot;latipinnate&quot; forms, according to the long or wide shape of the front flippers, but recent research has shown that these are not natural groups; ichthyosaur clades often contain species with and without elongated forelimbs.

The ichthyosaur pelvis is typically rather reduced. The three pelvic bones: the ilium, the ischium, and the pubic bone, are not fused and often do not even touch each other. Also, the left and right pelvic sides no longer touch; only basal forms still have sacral ribs connecting the ilia to the vertebral column. The hip joint is not closed on the inside. The pubic bone typically does not connect to the ischium behind it; the space in between is by some workers identified as the &quot;fenestra thyreoidea&quot;; other researchers deny that the term is applicable given the general loose structure of the pelvis. Some later species have a connected pubic bone and ischium, but in this case, the femoral head no longer articulates with the hip joint. Triassic species have plate-like pubic bones and ischia; in later species these elements become elongated with a narrow shaft and can form a single rod.

Typically, the hindlimbs are shorter than the forelimbs, possessing a lesser number of elements. Often, the rear flipper is only half the length of the front flipper. The thighbone is short and broad, often with a narrow waist and an expanded lower end. The tibia, fibula and metatarsals are merged into a mosaic of bone discs supporting the hydrofoil. Three to six toes are present. The toe phalanges also show hyperphalangy; exceptionally, &quot;Ophthalmosaurus&quot; shows a reduced number of phalanges.

===Soft tissue===

The earliest reconstructions of ichthyosaurs all omitted dorsal fins and caudal (tail) flukes, which were not supported by any hard skeletal structure, so were not preserved in many fossils. Only the lower tail lobe is supported by the vertebral column. In the early 1880s, the first body outlines of ichthyosaurs were discovered. In 1881, Richard Owen reported ichthyosaur body outlines showing tail flukes from Lower Jurassic rocks in Barrow-upon-Soar, England. Other well-preserved specimens have since shown that in some more primitive ichthyosaurs, like a specimen of &quot;Chaohusaurus geishanensis&quot;, the tail fluke was weakly developed and only had a dorsal tail lobe, making the tail more paddle-like. Over the years, the visibility of the tail lobe has faded away in this specimen.

The presence of dorsal fins in ichthyosaurs has been controversial. Finely preserved specimens from the Holzmaden &quot;Lagerstätten&quot; in Germany found in the late 19th century revealed additional traces, usually preserved in black, of the outline of the entire body, including the first evidence of dorsal fins in ichthyosaurs. Unique conditions permitted the preservation of these outlines, which probably consist of bacterial mats, not the remains of the original tissues themselves. In 1987, David Martill argued that, given the indirect method of conservation by bacteria, these outlines were unlikely to have been reliably preserved in any fine detail. He concluded that no authentic dorsal fins had been discovered. After displaced skins flaps from the body would have initially been misinterpreted as fins, fossil preparators later came to expect such fins to be present, and would have identified any discolouration in the appropriate position as a dorsal fin or even have falsified such structures. The lack of a dorsal fin would also explain why ichthyosaurs, contrary to porpoises, retained hind flippers, as these were needed for stability. Other researchers noted that, while the outlines might have been sharpened and smoothed by preparators because fossil bacterial mats usually have indistinct edges, many of the preserved dorsal fins were probably authentic and at least somewhat close to the true body outline. At least one specimen, R158 (in the collections of the Paleontologiska Museet, Uppsala University), shows the expected faded edges of a bacterial mat, so it has not been altered by preparators, yet still preserves a generally tuna-like body outline including a dorsal fin. In 1993, Martill admitted that at least some dorsal fin specimens are authentic.

The fossil specimens that preserved dorsal fins also showed that the flippers were pointy and often far wider than the underlying bones would suggest. The fins were supported by fibrous tissue. In some specimens, four layers of collagen are visible, the fibres of the covering layers crossing those of the collagen below.

In 2017, from the German Posidonia Shale the discovery was reported of 182.7-million-year-old vertebrae of &quot;Stenopterygius&quot; in a carbonate nodule, still containing collagen fibers, cholesterol, platelets, and red and white blood cells. The structures would not have been petrified, but represent the original organic tissues of which the biomolecules could be identified. The exceptional preservation was explained by the protective environment offered by the nodule. The red blood cells found, were one-fourth to one fifth the size of those of modern mammals. This would have been an adaptation for an improved oxygen absorption, also in view of the low oxygen levels during the Toarcian. The cholesterol had a high-carbon-13 isotope component which might indicate a higher position in the food chain and a diet of fish and cephalopods.

In 2018, evidence of blubber was discovered with &quot;Stenopterygius&quot;.

===Skin and colouration===

Typically, fossils that preserve it suggest that the skin of ichthyosaurs was smooth and elastic, lacking scales. However, these remains are not impressions &quot;per se&quot;, but outlines formed from bacterial growth. In one case, a true impression of the skin was reported from a specimen of &quot;Aegirosaurus&quot; found in the Solnhofen Plattenkalk, rocks which were capable of preserving even the finest detail. Minuscule scales seemed to be visible in this specimen.

The colouration of ichthyosaurs is difficult to determine. In 1956, Mary Whitear reported finding melanocytes, pigment cells in which reddish-brown pigment granules would still be present, in a skin specimen of a British fossil, R 509. Ichthyosaurs are traditionally assumed to have employed countershading (dark on top, light at the bottom) like sharks, penguins, and other modern animals, serving as camouflage during hunting. This was contradicted in 2014 by the discovery of melanosomes, black melanin-bearing structures, in the skin of ichthyosaur specimen YORYM 1993.338 by Johan Lindgren of Lund University. It was concluded that ichthyosaurs were likely uniformly dark coloured for thermoregulation and to camouflage them in deep water while hunting. This is in contrast to mosasaurids and prehistoric leatherback turtles, which were found to be countershaded. However, a 2015 study doubted Lindgren and colleagues&#x27; interpretation. This study noted that a basal layer of melanosomes in the skin is ubiquitous in reptile coloration, but does not necessarily correspond to a dark appearance. Other chromatophore structures (such as iridiophores, xanthophores, and erythrophores) affect coloration in extant reptiles but are rarely preserved or identified in fossils. Thus, due to the unknown presence of these chromatophores, YORYM 1993.338, could have been countershaded, green, or various other colors or patterns. In 2018, Lindgren and his colleagues also supported that ichthyosaurs would have been countershaded, on the basis of distributional
variation of melanophores that contain eumelanin found on the specimen of &quot;Stenopterygius&quot;.

===Gastroliths===
Gastroliths, stomach stones that might have assisted digestion or regulated buoyancy, have only on a few occasions been found associated with ichthyosaur skeletons, once with a specimen of &quot;Nannopterygius&quot; and a second time in a &quot;Panjiangsaurus&quot; fossil. Ichthyosaur coproliths, petrified faeces, are very common, though, already being sold by Mary Anning.

==Paleobiology==

===Ecology===
Apart from the obvious similarities to fish, ichthyosaurs also shared parallel developmental features with dolphins, lamnid sharks, and tuna. This gave them a broadly similar appearance, possibly implied similar activity levels (including thermoregulation), and presumably placed them broadly in a similar ecological niche. Ichthyosaurs were not primarily coastal animals; they also inhabited the open ocean. They have been found in all Mesozoic oceans. This is even true of the earliest Ichthyopterygia, making identification of a certain area as their place of origin impossible.

===Feeding===

Ichthyosaurs were carnivorous; they ranged so widely in size, and survived for so long, that they are likely to have had a wide range of prey. Species with pointed snouts were adapted to grab smaller animals. McGowan speculated that forms with protruding upper jaws, in the Eurhinosauria, would have used their pointy snouts to slash prey, as has been assumed for swordfish. The most commonly preserved gut contents in ichthyosaurs are the remains of cephalopods. Less commonly, they fed on fish and other vertebrates, including smaller ichthyosaurs. The large Triassic form &quot;Thalattoarchon&quot; had large, bladed teeth and was probably a macropredator, capable of killing prey its own size, and &quot;Himalayasaurus&quot; and several species of &quot;Temnodontosaurus&quot; also shared adaptations for killing very large prey. These food preferences have been confirmed by coproliths which indeed contain the remains of fishes and cephalopods. Another confirmation is provided by fossilised stomach contents. Buckland in 1835 described the presence in a specimen of a large mass of partly digested fishes, recognisable by their scales. Subsequent research in 1968 determined that these belonged to the fish genus &quot;Pholidophorus&quot;, but also that cephalopod beaks and sucker hooks were present. Such hard food particles apparently were retained by the stomach and regularly regurgitated. Carcasses of drowned animals were eaten as well: in 2003 a specimen of &quot;Platypterygius longmani&quot; was reported having, besides fishes and a turtle, the bones of a land bird in its stomach.

Some early ichthyosaurs were durophagous and had flat convex teeth adapted for crushing shellfish. They thus ate benthos from the floor of shallow seas. Other species were perhaps suction feeders, sucking animals into their mouths by quickly opening their relatively short jaws. This was first assumed for &quot;Shonisaurus&quot;, which giant by this means might have secured a constant food supply for its huge body, and in 2011 for the short-snouted &quot;Guanlingsaurus liangae&quot;. However, in 2013 a study concluded that the hyoid bone of ichthyosaurs, at the tongue base, was insufficiently ossified to support a suction feeding movement and suggested the alternative that such species were ram feeders, gathering food by constantly swimming forwards with a wide-open mouth.

Typical ichthyosaurs had very large eyes, protected within a bony ring, suggesting that they may have hunted at night or at great depths; the only extant animals with similarly large eyes are the giant and colossal squids. Sight thus seems to have been one of the main senses employed while hunting. Hearing might have been poor, given the very robust form of the stapes. Grooves in the palate however, suggest that smell might have been acute or even that electro-sensory organs might have been present.

Ichthyosaurs themselves served as food for other animals. During the Triassic their natural predators mainly consisted of sharks and other ichthyosaurs; in the Jurassic these were joined by large Plesiosauria and Thalattosuchia. This is again confirmed by stomach contents: in 2009 e.g., a plesiosaur specimen was reported with an ichthyosaur embryo in its gut.

===Locomotion===
In ichthyosaurs, the main propulsion was provided by a lateral movement of the body. Early forms employed an anguilliform or eel-like movement, with undulations of the entire trunk and tail. This is usually considered rather inefficient. Later forms, like the Parvipelvia, has a shorter trunk and tail and probably used a more efficient carangiform or even thunniform movement, in which the last third of the body, respectively, the tail end, is flexed only. The trunk in such species is rather stiff.

The tail was bi-lobed, with the lower lobe being supported by the caudal vertebral column, which was &quot;kinked&quot; ventrally to follow the contours of the ventral lobe. Basal species had a rather asymmetric or &quot;heterocercal&quot; tail fin. The asymmetry differed from that of sharks in that the lower lobe was largest, instead of the upper lobe. More derived forms had a nearly vertical symmetric tail fin. Sharks use their asymmetric tail fin to compensate for the fact that they are negatively buoyant, heavier than water, by making the downward pressure exerted by the tail force the body as a whole in an ascending angle. This way, swimming forwards will generate enough lift to equal the sinking force caused by their weight. In 1973, McGowan concluded that, because ichthyosaurs have a reversed tail fin asymmetry compared to sharks, they were apparently positively buoyant, lighter than water, which would be confirmed by their lack of gastroliths and of pachyostosis or dense bone. The tail would have served to keep the body in a descending angle. The front flippers would be used to push the front of the body further downwards and control pitch. In 1987 however, Michael A. Taylor suggested an alternative hypothesis: as ichthyosaurs could vary their lung content, contrary to sharks (which lack a swimming bladder), they could also regulate their buoyancy. The tail thus mainly served for a neutral propulsion, while small variations in buoyancy were stabilised by slight changes in the flipper angles. In 1992, McGowan accepted this view, pointing out that shark tails are not a good analogy of derived ichthyosaur tails that have more narrow lobes, and are more vertical and symmetric. Derived ichthyosaur tail fins are more like those of tuna fish and indicate a comparable capacity to sustain a high cruising speed. A comparative study by Motani in 2002 concluded that, in extant animals, small tail fin lobes positively correlate with a high beat frequency. Modern researchers generally concur that ichthyosaurs were negatively buoyant.

In 1994, Judy Massare concluded that ichthyosaurs had been the fastest marine reptiles. Their length/depth ratio was between three and five, the optimal number to minimise water resistance or drag. Their smooth skin and streamlined bodies prevented excessive turbulence. Their hydrodynamic efficiency, the degree to which energy is converted into a forward movement, would approach that of dolphins and measure about 0.8. Ichthyosaurs would be a fifth faster than plesiosaurs, though half of the difference was explained by assuming a 30% higher metabolism for ichthyosaurs. Together, within Massare&#x27;s model these effects resulted in a cruising speed of slightly less than five kilometres per hour. However, in 2002, Motani corrected certain mistakes in Massare&#x27;s formulae and revised the estimated cruising speed to less than two kilometres per hour, somewhat below that of modern Cetacea. However, as the speeds estimated for plesiosaurs and mosasaurids were also revised downwards, ichthyosaurs maintained their relative position.

Ichthyosaurs had fin-like limbs of varying relative length. The standard interpretation is that these, together with the dorsal fin and tail fin, were used as control surfaces for directional stability, controlling yaw, and for stabilising pitch and roll, rather than propulsion. However, during the 1980s the German paleontologist Jürgen Riess proposed an alternative model. After having studied the flying movement made by the forelimbs of plesiosaurs, he suggested that at least those ichthyosaurs that had long flippers used them for a powerful propulsive stroke, moving them up and down. This would explain the non-degenerated shoulder girdle and the evolution of the hand bones, whose perfect hydrofoil profile would have been useless if it was not functionally employed. He thought to have discovered modern analogues in the Queensland lungfish and the Amazon river dolphin, which he presumed also used their long fins for propulsion. Riess expounded upon this hypothesis in a series of articles. This alternative interpretation was generally not adopted by other workers. In 1998, Darren Naish pointed out that the lungfish and the river dolphin actually do not use their fins in this way and that e.g. the modern humpback whale has very long front flippers, supported by a mosaic of bones, but that these nevertheless mainly serve as rudders. In 2013, a study concluded that broad ichthyosaur flippers, like those of &quot;Platyptergygius&quot;, were not used for propulsion but as a control surface.

===Diving===

Many extant lung-breathing marine vertebrates are capable of deep diving. There are some indications about the diving capacity of ichthyosaurs. Quickly ascending from a greater depth can cause decompression sickness. The resulting bone necrosis has been well documented with Jurassic and Cretaceous ichthyosaurs, where it is present in 15% and 18% of specimens, respectively, but is rare in Triassic species. This could be a sign that basal forms did not dive as deeply, but might also be explained by a greater predation pressure during the later epochs, more often necessitating a fast flight to the surface. However, this last possibility is contradicted by the fact that, with modern animals, damage is not caused by a limited number of rapid ascension incidents, but by a gradual accumulation of non-invalidating degeneration during normal diving behaviour.

Additional evidence is provided by the eyes of ichthyosaurs that among vertebrates are both relatively and absolutely the largest known. Modern leopard seals can dive to up to hunting on sight. Motani suggested that ichthyosaurs, with their relatively much larger eye sockets, should have been able to reach even greater depths. &quot;Temnodontosaurus&quot;, with eyes that had a diameter of twenty-five centimetres, could probably still see at a depth of 1,600 metres. At these depths, such eyes would have been especially useful to see large objects. Later species, such as &quot;Ophthalmosaurus&quot;, had relatively larger eyes, again an indication that diving capacity was better in late Jurassic and Cretaceous forms.

===Metabolism===
Similar to modern cetaceans, such as whales and dolphins, ichthyosaurs were air-breathing. Whales and dolphins are mammals and warm-blooded. Of ichthyosaurs it was traditionally assumed that they were cold-blooded, being reptiles. However, since the 1970s many dominant reptile groups of the Mesozoic, such as theropod dinosaurs, pterosaurs and plesiosaurs, have been considered warm-blooded, as this offers an elegant explanation of their dominance. Some direct evidence is available that ichthyosaurs too might have been endothermic. In 1990, Vivian de Buffrénil published a histological study, indicating that ichthyosaurs possessed a fibrolamellar bone structure, as with warm-blooded animals in general, typified by fast growth and a strong vascularisation. Early Triassic species already show these traits. In 2012, it was reported that even the very basal form &quot;Utatsusaurus&quot; had this bone type, indicating that the ancestors of ichthyosaurs were already warm-blooded. Additional direct proof for a high metabolism is the isotopes of oxygen ratio in the teeth, which indicates a body temperature of between 35 and 39 °C, about 20° higher than the surrounding seawater. Blubber is consistent with warm-bloodedness as the insulating qualities require the animal to generate its own heat.

Indirect evidence for endothermy is provided by the body shape of derived ichthyosaurs, which with its short tail and vertical tail fin seems optimised for a high cruising speed that can only be sustained by a high metabolism: all extant animals swimming this way are either fully warm-blooded or, like sharks and tuna, maintain a high temperature in their body core. This argument does not cover basal forms with a more eel-like body and undulating swimming movement. In 1996, Richard Cowen, while accepting endothermy for the group, presumed that ichthyosaurs would have been subject to &quot;Carrier&#x27;s constraint&quot;, a limitation to reptilian respiration pointed out in 1987 by David Carrier: their undulated locomotion forces the air out of the lungs and thus prevents them from taking breath while moving. Cowen hypothesised that ichthyosaurs would have overcome this problem by porpoising: constantly jumping out of the water would have allowed them to take a gulp of fresh air during each jump. Other researchers have tended to assume that for at least derived ichthyosaurs Carrier&#x27;s constraint did not apply, because of their stiff bodies, which seems to be confirmed by their good diving capacity, implying an effective respiration and oxygen storage system. For these species porpoising was not a necessity. Nevertheless, ichthyosaurs would have often surfaced to breathe, probably tilting their heads slightly to take in air, because of the lower position of the nostrils compared to that of dolphins.

===Reproduction===

Ichthyosaurs were viviparous, i.e. bore live young instead of laying eggs. Although they were reptiles and descended from egg-laying, oviparous, ancestors, viviparity is not as unexpected as it first appears. Air-breathing marine creatures must either come ashore to lay eggs, like turtles and some sea snakes, or else give birth to live young in surface waters, like whales and dolphins. Given their streamlined and transversely flattened bodies, heavily adapted for fast swimming, it would have been difficult, if not impossible, for ichthyosaurs to move far enough on land to lay eggs. This was confirmed as early as 9 December 1845 when naturalist Joseph Chaning Pearce reported a small embryo in a fossil of &quot;Ichthyosaurus communis&quot;. The embryo, with a length of eleven centimetres, was positioned in the birth canal of its two-and-a-half metre long mother, with its head pointed to the rear. Pearce concluded from the fossil that ichthyosaurs had to have been viviparous.
Later, from the Holzmaden deposits numerous adult fossils were found containing fetuses. In 1880, Harry Govier Seeley, heading a special British paleontological committee studying the problem of ichthyosaur reproduction, concluded that birth was given in the water and that fossils containing fetuses in the birth canal probably represented cases of premature death of the juvenile, causing the demise of the mother animal as well. A comparison has been made with dolphins and whales, whose young need to be born tail-first to prevent drowning; if the juvenile is born head-first, it dies and the mother with it if the corpse gets stuck in the birth canal. However, an alternative explanation is that such fossils actually represent females that had died for other reasons while pregnant, after which the decomposition gasses drove out the fetuses head-first. In 2014, a study reported the find of a fossilized &quot;Chaohusaurus&quot; female that had died while giving birth to three neonates. Two had already been expelled while a third was present in the birth canal. The fossil also documented that early ichthyosaurs were also born head first, perhaps opposed to later genera. As &quot;Chaohusaurus&quot; is a very basal ichthyopterygian—previously, the most basal genus of which fetuses were known, had been &quot;Mixosaurus&quot;—this discovery suggests that the earliest land-dwelling ancestors of ichthyosaurs had already been viviparous.

A comprehensive multi-author study published in 2023 examined the evolution of fetal orientation of ichthyosaurs based on known specimens of gravid female ichthyosaurs. Specimens of basal ichthyosaurs, &quot;Chaohusaurus&quot; and &quot;Cymbospondylus&quot;, showed evidence of head-first birth, while &quot;Mixosaurus&quot; had evidence of both head-first and tail-first birth based on three specimens. More derived ichthyosaurus including &quot;Stenopterygius&quot;, &quot;Besanosaurus&quot;, &quot;Qianichthyosaurus&quot; and &quot;Platypterygius&quot; showed evidence of tail-first birth. This indicates that while basal ichthyosaurs were born with head-first, merriamosaurian ichthyosaurs had preference of tail-first birth over head-first birth. The authors asserted that the derived ichthyosaurs&#x27; preference of tail-first birth may have been because it was easy for the female to push on the cranium rather than the pelvis when giving birth, or because it could reduce maternal energy expenditure on trim control. They disagreed with the &quot;increased asphyxiation risk&quot; hypothesis for tail-first birth preference, given that &quot;Mixosaurus&quot; showed evidence of both fetal orientation of head-first and tail-first birth; if this was indeed the reason, there should have been a higher preference for tail-first births caused by strong stabilizing selection for this trait much earlier in the evolutionary history of every aquatic, viviparous tetrapod clades, which isn&#x27;t the case.
Compared with placental mammals or plesiosaurs, ichthyosaur fetuses tend to be very small and their number per litter is often high. In one female of &quot;Stenopterygius&quot; seven have been identified, in another eleven. The fetuses have at most a quarter of the length of the mother animal. The juveniles have about the same body proportions as adult individuals. The main ontogenetical changes during growth consist in the fusion and greater robustness of the skeletal elements. At least one neonate &quot;I. communis&quot; individual has been identified, with preserved stomach contents indicating feeding on cephalopods and fish. This is unlike other similar species, such as Stenopterygius, where feeding niches shift from small fish to larger cephalopods through ontogeny.

Crocodiles, most sea turtles and some lizards determine the sex of their offspring by manipulating the temperature of the developing eggs&#x27; environment; i.e. they do not have distinct sex chromosomes. Live-bearing reptiles do not regulate sex through incubation temperature. A study in 2009, which examined 94 living species of reptiles, birds and mammals, found that the genetic control of sex appears to be crucial to live birth. It was concluded that with marine reptiles such control predated viviparity and was an adaptation to the stable sea-climate in coastal regions. Genetics likely controlled sex in ichthyosaurs, mosasaurs and plesiosaurs.

===Social behaviour and intelligence===
Ichthyosaurs are often assumed to have lived in herds or hunting groups. Little evidence is available about the nature of ichthyosaur social behaviour. Some indications exist that a level of sexual dimorphism was present. Skeletons of &quot;Eurhinosaurus&quot; and &quot;Shastasaurus&quot; show two morphotypes. Individuals with a longer snout, larger eyes, a longer trunk, a shorter tail, and longer flippers with additional phalanges, could have represented the females; the longer trunk may have provided room for the embryos.

Generally, the brain shows the limited size and elongated shape of that of modern cold-blooded reptiles. However, in 1973, McGowan, while studying the natural endocast of a well-preserved specimen, pointed out that the telencephalon was not very small. The visual lobes were large, as could be expected from the eye size. The olfactory lobes were, though not especially large, well-differentiated; the same was true of the cerebellum.

===Pathologies===
Though fossils revealing ichthyosaur behavior remain rare, one ichthyosaur fossil is known to have sustained bites to the snout region. Discovered in Australia, and analyzed by Benjamin Kear &quot;et alii&quot; in 2011, measurements of the wounds reveal that the bite marks were inflicted by another ichthyosaur, likely of the same species, a probable case of face biting during a conflict. The wounds show signs of healing in the form of bone growth, meaning that the victim survived the attack. Another, very large ichthyosaur close to nine metres in length was found in Svalbard; it was nearly complete save for its tail. Scrutiny of the find revealed that while hunting ammonites (as evidenced by an ammonite shell in the throat region), the ichthyosaur was ambushed and attacked, likely by a pliosaurid (known from the same habitat), which severed its tail. The ichthyosaur then sank to the depths, drowning and eventually becoming fossilized in the deep water. The find was revealed to the public in the National Geographic special &quot;Death of a Sea Monster&quot;.

<text>The Ontario Liberal Party (OLP; , PLO) is a political party in the province of Ontario, Canada. The party has been led by Bonnie Crombie since December 2023.

The party espouses the principles of liberalism, and generally sits at the centre to centre-left of the political spectrum, with their rival the Progressive Conservative Party positioned to the right and the New Democratic Party (who at times aligned itself with the Liberals during minority governments), positioned to their left.

The party has strong informal ties to the Liberal Party of Canada, but the two parties are organizationally independent and have separate, though overlapping, memberships. The provincial party and the Ontario wing of the federal party were organizationally one entity until members voted to split in 1976.

The Liberals lost official party status in the 2018 Ontario provincial election; they had fallen to only seven seats, the worst defeat of a governing party in Ontario history. Prior to the 2018 election, the party had won every election since the beginning of the 21st century and had governed the province for the previous 15 years. In the 2022 provincial election, the Liberals saw a modest increase in support, finishing second in popular vote, but only winning eight seats. The party regained official
party status in the 2025 Ontario general election under the leadership of Bonnie Crombie.

==History==

=== Origins ===
The Liberal Party of Ontario is descended from the Reform Party of Robert Baldwin and William Lyon Mackenzie, who argued for responsible government in the 1830s and 1840s against the conservative patrician rule of the Family Compact.

The modern Liberals were founded by George Brown, who sought to rebuild the Reform Party after its collapse in 1854. In 1857, Brown brought together the Reformers and the radical &quot;Clear Grits&quot; of southwestern Ontario to create a new party in Upper Canada with a platform of democratic reform and annexation of the north-west. The party adopted a position in favour of uniting Britain&#x27;s North American colonies, a concept that led to Canadian Confederation.

=== Confederation ===
After 1867, Edward Blake became leader of the Ontario Liberal Party. The party sat in opposition to the Conservative government led by John Sandfield Macdonald. Blake&#x27;s Liberals defeated the Tories in 1871, but Blake left Queen&#x27;s Park for Ottawa the next year, leaving the provincial Liberals in the hands of Oliver Mowat. Mowat served as Premier of Ontario until 1896.

While the Tories became a narrow, sectarian Protestant party with a base in the Orange Order, the Liberals under Mowat attempted to bring together Catholics and Protestants, rural and urban interests under moderate, religiously liberal leadership.

===Decline and opposition===
The Liberals were defeated in 1905 after over thirty years in power. The party had grown tired and arrogant in government and became increasingly cautious. As well, a growing anti-Catholic sectarian sentiment hurt the Liberals, particularly in Toronto where they were unable to win a seat from 1890 until 1916. The Liberals continued to decline after losing power, and, for a time, were eclipsed by the United Farmers of Ontario (UFO) when the Liberals were unable to attract the growing farmers&#x27; protest movement to its ranks.

Debates over the party&#x27;s policy on liquor divided the membership, forced the resignation of at least one leader, Hartley Dewart, and drove away many reform-minded Liberals who supported the federal party under William Lyon Mackenzie King but found the provincial party too narrow and conservative to support. The party was so disorganized that it was led for seven years (and through two provincial elections) by an interim leader, W.E.N. Sinclair, as there was not enough money or a sufficient level of organization, and too many divisions within the party to hold a leadership convention. By 1930, the Liberals were reduced to a small, rural and prohibitionist rump with a base in south western Ontario.

===Return to power under Mitch Hepburn===
After a series of ineffective leaders, the Liberals turned to Mitchell Hepburn, an onion farmer, federal Member of Parliament and former member of the UFO. Hepburn was able to build an electoral coalition with Liberal-Progressives and attract reformers and urban voters to the party. The Liberal-Progressives had previously supported the UFO and the Progressive Party of Canada. A &quot;wet&quot;, Hepburn was able to end the divisions in the party around the issue of temperance which had reduced it to a narrow sect. The revitalized party was able to win votes from rural farmers, particularly in southwestern Ontario, urban Ontario, Catholics and francophones. It also had the advantage of not being in power at the onset of the Great Depression. With the economy in crisis, Ontarians looked for a new government, and Hepburn&#x27;s populism was able to excite the province.

In government, Hepburn&#x27;s Liberals warred with organized labour led by the Congress of Industrial Organizations, who were trying to unionize the auto-sector. Later, he battled with the federal Liberal Party of Canada government of William Lyon Mackenzie King, which, Hepburn argued, was insufficiently supportive of the war effort. The battle between Hepburn and King split the Ontario Liberal Party and led to Hepburn&#x27;s ouster as leader. It also contributed to the party&#x27;s defeat in the 1943 election, which was followed by the party&#x27;s long stint in opposition. The Liberals declined to a right wing, rural rump. The &quot;Progressive Conservatives&quot; under George Drew established a dynasty which was to rule Ontario for the next 42 years.

===Opposition during the post-war boom===
Ontario politics in recent times have been dominated by the Progressive Conservatives, also known as the Tories. The Liberals had formed the Government for only five years out of sixty years from 1943 to 2003. For forty-two years, from 1943 to 1985, the province was governed by the Tories. During this period, the Ontario Liberal Party was a rural, conservative rump with a southwestern Ontario base, and were often further to the right of the moderate Red Tory Conservative administrations. In 1964, the party changed their name from the &quot;Ontario Liberal Association&quot; to the &quot;Liberal Party of Ontario&quot;.

In September 1964, the party elected Andy Thompson as its leader. While the leadership election garnered some attention, it looked like Thompson would have a hard time winning an election. The Liberals had held office only three times for 13 years since 1900 and the party caucus was not that much different from the time between 1959 and 1963. They failed to get a popular candidate, Charles Templeton, elected in a by-election. They also lost another riding to the PCs when Maurice Bélanger died in March 1964. Thompson would last only two years as leader before resigning due to stress-induced health problems.

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, the Liberals were almost shut out of Metropolitan Toronto and other urban areas and, in 1975, fell to third place behind the Ontario New Democratic Party (NDP) under Stephen Lewis. With the NDP in ascendancy in the late 1960s and 1970s, it appeared that the Liberals could disappear altogether.

The Liberals remained more popular than the Tories among Catholic and Francophone voters, due to the party&#x27;s support for extending separate school funding to include Grades 11–13. The Tories opposed this extension until 1985, when they suddenly reversed their position. This reversal angered traditional Conservative voters, and may have contributed to their defeat in the 1985 election.

===The Peterson years===

The Ontario Liberal Party first broke the Tories&#x27; hold on the province in 1985 under the leadership of David Peterson. Peterson modernized the party and made it appealing to urban voters and immigrants who had previously supported the cautious government of Tory Premiers John Robarts and William Davis.

Peterson was able to form a minority government from 1985 to 1987 due to an accord signed with the Ontario NDP. Under this accord, the NDP agreed not to trigger an election via a non-confidence vote in exchange for the Liberals implementing certain agreed upon policies and not calling an election for the next two years.

Once the accord expired, an election was called and Peterson won a strong majority government with 95 seats, its most ever.

Peterson&#x27;s government ruled in a time of economic plenty where occasional instances of fiscal imprudence were not much remarked on. Peterson was a close ally of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney on the Meech Lake Accord, but opposed Mulroney on the issue of free trade.

The majority Liberal government of 1987 to 1990 was less innovative than the previous minority government. The Liberals&#x27; increasing conservatism caused many centre-left voters to look at the Ontario NDP and its leader Bob Rae, and consider the social-democratic NDP as an alternative to the Liberals.

The Liberals went into the 1990 election with apparently strong support in the public opinion polls. This support quickly evaporated, however. On the campaign trail, the media reported that the Liberals were met by voters who were angry at going to the polls just three years into the government&#x27;s mandate. Another negative factor was Peterson&#x27;s association with Mulroney and the failed Meech Lake Accord attempt at constitutional reform, about which the public felt strongly. The campaign was also poorly run: a mid-campaign proposal to cut the provincial sales tax was a particularly bad blunder. The party had also underestimated the impact of the Patti Starr fundraising scandal, as well as allegations surrounding the Liberal government&#x27;s links with land developers.

In the 1990 election, the Liberals only finished five points behind the NDP in the popular vote. However, the NDP took many seats from the Liberals in the Toronto suburbs. The NDP promised a return to the activist form of government that had prevailed from 1985 to 1987, and its co-operation with the Liberals during that time made it appear more moderate and acceptable to swing voters in the Toronto area. Due to the nature of the first-past-the-post system, the Liberals were decimated, falling from 95 seats to 36. The 59-seat loss surpassed the 48-seat loss in 1943 that began the Tories&#x27; long rule over the province. Peterson himself was heavily defeated in his own London-area riding by the NDP challenger.

===Return to opposition===

By the 1995 election, the NDP government had become very unpopular due to perceived mismanagement, a few scandals, and because of the severe downturn in the economy. The Liberal Party was expected to replace the unpopular NDP, but it ran a poor campaign under leader Lyn McLeod, and was beaten by the Progressive Conservatives under Mike Harris. Harris swept to power on a right-wing &quot;Common Sense Revolution&quot; platform. In 1996, the Ontario Liberals selected Dalton McGuinty as their leader in a free-wheeling convention. Starting in fourth place, McGuinty&#x27;s fiscally prudent record and moderate demeanor made him the second choice of a convention polarized around the candidacy of former Toronto Food Bank head Gerard Kennedy.

In the 1999 election, the governing Conservatives were reelected on the basis of strong economic growth and a negative campaign tightly focused on portraying McGuinty as &quot;not up to the job&quot;. A poor performance in the leader&#x27;s debate and a weak overall campaign hamstrung the new leader, but he was able to rally his party in the final weeks of the campaign. The Ontario Liberals garnered 40% of the vote, at the time their second-highest total in 50 years.

McGuinty&#x27;s second term as opposition leader was more successful than his first. With the Liberals consolidated as the primary opposition to Harris&#x27;s Progressive Conservatives, McGuinty was able to present his party as the &quot;government in waiting&quot;. He hired a more skilled group of advisors and drafted former cabinet minister Greg Sorbara as party president. McGuinty also rebuilt the party&#x27;s fundraising operation, launching the Ontario Liberal Fund. He personally rebuilt the party&#x27;s platform to one that emphasized lowering class sizes, hiring more nurses, increasing environmental protections and &quot;holding the line&quot; on taxes in the buildup to the 2003 election. McGuinty also made a serious effort to improve his debating skills, and received coaching from Democratic Party trainers in the United States.

===&quot;Choose Change&quot; the McGuinty government===

In the 2003 election, McGuinty led the Liberals to a majority government, winning 72 out of 103 seats. The PC government&#x27;s record had already been marred by a number of prior events, including the death of Dudley George, the Walkerton water tragedy and the government&#x27;s performance during the SARS outbreak. The PC&#x27;s election campaign relied on attack ads against McGuinty, while the McGuinty campaign kept a positive message throughout. The PCs&#x27; negative attacks on McGuinty backfired throughout the campaign.

The new government called the Legislature back in session in late 2003, and passed a series of bills relating to its election promises. The government brought in auto insurance reforms (including a price cap), fixed election dates, rolled-back a series of corporate and personal tax cuts which had been scheduled for 2004, passed legislation which enshrined publicly funded Medicare into provincial law, hired more meat and water inspectors, opened up the provincially owned electricity companies to Freedom of Information laws and enacted a ban on partisan government advertising.

The McGuinty government also benefited from a scandal involving the previous Progressive Conservative government&#x27;s management of Ontario Power Generation and Hydro One, which broke in the winter of 2003–04. It was revealed that a number of key figures associated with Mike Harris&#x27;s &quot;Common Sense Revolution&quot; had received lucrative, untendered multimillion-dollar consulting contracts from these institutions. Among the figures named in the scandal were Tom Long, former Harris campaign chairman, Leslie Noble, former Harris campaign manager and Paul Rhodes, former Harris communications director.

On May 18, 2004, Provincial Finance Minister Greg Sorbara released the McGuinty government&#x27;s first budget. The centrepiece was a controversial new Health Premium of $300 to $900, staggered according to income. This violated a key Liberal campaign pledge not to raise taxes, and gave the government an early reputation for breaking promises. The Liberals defended the premium by pointing to the previous government&#x27;s hidden deficit of $5.6 billion, and McGuinty claimed he needed to break his campaign pledge on taxation to fulfill his promises on other fronts.

The Ontario Health Premium also became a major issue in the early days of the 2004 federal election, called a week after the Ontario budget. Most believe that the controversy seriously hampered Liberal Prime Minister Paul Martin&#x27;s bid for re-election.

Also controversial were the elimination of coverage for health services not covered by the Canada Health Act, including eye examinations and physical therapy. Other elements included a four-year plan to tackle the deficit left behind by the Progressive Conservatives, free immunization for children, investments in education and investments to lower waiting times for cancer care, cardiac care, joint replacement, MRI and CT scans.

Soon after the federal election, McGuinty hosted a federal-provincial summit on public health-care funding which resulted in a new agreement for a national health accord. This accord allowed the provincial Premiers and territorial leaders to draw more money from Ottawa for health services, and requires the federal government to take provincial concerns such as hospital waiting-lists into account. McGuinty&#x27;s performance at the summit was generally applauded by the Canadian media.

The McGuinty government brought forward a number of regulatory initiatives in the fall of 2004. These included legislation allowing bring-your-own-wine in restaurants, banning junk food in public schools to promote healthier choices, outlawing smoking in public places and requiring students to stay in school until age 18. Following a series of high-profile maulings, the government also moved to ban pit bulls.

During early 2005, McGuinty called the Legislature back for a rare winter session to debate and pass several high-profile bills. The government legislated a Greenbelt around Toronto. The size of Prince Edward Island, the Greenbelt protects a broad swath of land from development and preserves forests and farmland. In response to court decisions, the Liberals updated the definition of marriage to include homosexual couples.

McGuinty also launched a PR campaign to narrow the politically charged $23 billion gap between what Ontario contributes to the federal government and what is returned to Ontario in services. This came as a sharp turn after more than a year of cooperating with the federal government, but McGuinty pointed to the special deals worked out by the federal government with Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia as compromising the nature of equalization payments. In particular, McGuinty noted that immigrants in Ontario receive $800 in support from the federal government, while those in Quebec receive $3800.

In the 2003 campaign, the Liberals denounced public-private partnerships (also known as &quot;3P&quot; deals) for infrastructure projects such as the building of hospitals. Following the campaign, however, the McGuinty government allowed &quot;3P&quot; hospital construction deals arranged by the previous government to continue.

The Ontario Liberals won their second majority in a row on October 10, 2007, winning 71 of the province&#x27;s 107 seats. Winning two majorities back to back is a feat that had not occurred for the party in 70 years.

In the next general election on October 6, 2011, McGuinty led the Liberals to win a historic third consecutive term and to once again form government, albeit with a minority of seats in the legislature. The Liberals won 53 of the 107 seats, just short of a 54-seat majority government. On October 15, 2012, McGuinty announced that he would resign as leader and Premier. At the end of January 2013, the party elected MPP Kathleen Wynne as leader, making her the 25th Premier of Ontario.

=== Majority under Wynne ===
The June 12, 2014 election was triggered by the Ontario New Democratic Party&#x27;s decision to reject the 2014 Ontario Budget. The Liberal Party under the leadership of Kathleen Wynne won 58 seats in the Legislature, and formed a majority government.

In 2015, the Liberals proposed to sell 60 per cent of the province&#x27;s $16-billion share of the province&#x27;s electricity distribution utility, Hydro One. Hydro One Brampton and Hydro One Networks&#x27; distribution arm would be spun off into a separate company and sold outright for up to $3 billion.

The government pivoted to the left in the lead up to the 2018 election by raising the minimum wage, introducing reforms to employment standards and labour law, bringing in a limited form of pharmacare and promising universal child care.

=== Loss of official party status ===
In the 2018 general election, the Liberals were swept from power in a historic defeat that resulted in large gains for both the Progressive Conservatives and NDP. The Liberal popular vote fell to 19%, almost half their previous result; the party lost 51 seats and were reduced to a rump of only seven seats in a swing that elected a PC majority and made the NDP the official opposition.

Notably, the Liberals lost all but three of their 18 seats in Toronto, were completely shut out in the 905 region and won only one seat outside of Toronto and Ottawa. The seven-member rump caucus was one short of the requirement to retain official status in the Ontario legislature, and was also the only remnant of Wynne&#x27;s cabinet. Wynne herself barely held onto her own seat by 181 votes. Accepting responsibility for the worst showing in the party&#x27;s 161-year history and the worst defeat of a sitting government in Ontario, Wynne resigned as Liberal leader on election night.

On June 14, 2018, John Fraser was appointed as interim leader of the party following a vote by caucus members, riding association presidents, and party executives.

In the 2018 municipal election later in the year, six of the defeated Liberal MPPs — Bill Mauro, Kathryn McGarry, Jim Bradley, Mike Colle, Granville Anderson and Dipika Damerla — were elected to municipal office as mayors, city councillors or regional councillors.

In March 2020, the party elected former Cabinet Minister Steven Del Duca as leader, who defeated five other candidates on the first ballot at the leadership convention.

In the 2022 general election, the Liberals finished second in popular vote but gained only one seat, once again falling short of official status by four seats. After failing to win in his own riding, leader Steven Del Duca announced his resignation as party leader. John Fraser returned as interim leader until the December 2023 leadership election which elected Mississauga mayor Bonnie Crombie as the new Liberal leader.

=== Leadership of Bonnie Crombie ===

On December 2nd, 2023, the Ontario Liberal Party elected Bonnie Crombie, the then-mayor of Mississauga, as the next leader of the party, defeating MP Nate Erskine-Smith, MP Yasir Naqvi, and MPP Ted Hsu.

On September 21, 2024, the Ontario Liberal Party unveiled their new logo alongside their slogan, &quot;More for You.&quot;

In the 2025 election, the Liberals garnered 30% of the vote, their highest total since losing government in 2018, winning 14 seats and gaining official party status in the Ontario Legislature.

== Current Ontario Liberal Caucus ==
== Ontario Liberal Executive Council ==
The executive of the Ontario Liberal Party is elected to a 12 to 18 month term at the Annual General Meeting. 
==Leaders==

: Though Sinclair led the party through two elections, he was never formally elected as leader by the Ontario Liberal Association which, due to its state of disorganization, did not organize a leadership convention until 1930.

: Hepburn resigned as Premier in October 1942 after designating Gordon Daniel Conant as his successor, and Conant was sworn in as Premier. The Ontario Liberal Association (particularly supporters of William Lyon Mackenzie King) demanded a leadership convention and one was finally held in May 1943 electing Harry Nixon. Technically, Hepburn did not resign as Liberal leader until the convention.

: Nixon was elected interim leader by the caucus on November 16, 1966, and was acclaimed permanent leader at the January 1967 leadership convention.

: Nixon resigned as interim leader and MPP in order to accept a federal appointment.

: Elston resigned as interim leader when he entered the Liberal leadership race as a candidate.

: Fraser was unanimously interim leader by caucus and a vote of the party executive and riding association presidents following the defeat of the Wynne government in the 2018 provincial election.

==Presidents==

The party president is elected at each annual general meeting (AGM) of the party, by party members who attend the AGM. The role of president is to head the party’s executive council, which oversees such things as policy development and proposed party constitutional changes. Past presidents of the party include Yasir Naqvi, Joe Cruden, Jeffrey King and Pat Reid. The current president is Kathryn McGarry.

==Election results==

1The Liberals were recognized as the Official Opposition following the 1923 election by the governing Conservatives, despite the fact that the United Farmers of Ontario had more seats. According to historian Peter Oliver, this was an arbitrary decision without basis in precedent or law. Conservative Premier G. Howard Ferguson used as justification an announcement by UFO general secretary James J. Morrison that the UFO would be withdrawing from party politics, though Oliver argues that this was facetious logic. UFO parliamentary leader Manning Doherty protested the decision, but to no avail. (source: Peter Oliver, &quot;G. Howard Ferguson: Ontario Tory&quot;, (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1977), p. 158.)

<text>Samuel Augustus Maverick (July 23, 1803 – September 2, 1870) was a Texas lawyer, politician, land baron and signer of the Texas Declaration of Independence. His name is the source of the term &quot;&quot;, first attested in 1867. He was the grandfather of Texas politician Maury Maverick, who coined the term gobbledygook (1944).

==Early years==
Samuel Augustus Maverick was the oldest son of Samuel Maverick, a Charleston businessman, and his wife Elizabeth Anderson. His Maverick ancestors had arrived in the New World in 1624, before emigrating to Barbados and later to Charleston. After his paternal grandfather died, in 1793 his grandmother, Lydia Maverick (née Turpin), married American Revolutionary War general Robert Anderson. In October 1802, his father married Anderson&#x27;s daughter Elizabeth, and nine months later, on July 23, 1803, Maverick was born at his family&#x27;s summer home in Pendleton District, South Carolina. To his family, Maverick was known as &quot;Gus&quot;.
Over the next four years the family lived in Charleston, and his mother bore four more children, one of whom, Robert, lived less than a day. In September 1809, his sister Ann Caroline died of yellow fever. His father, having watched his ten siblings succumb to the same disease as children, moved his family permanently to Pendleton. For the rest of his life, the elder Samuel Maverick cautioned his children to always live in a healthful climate so that they would not fall victim to a tropical disease.

While in Charleston, the elder Samuel had operated a successful business importing goods from England, the Netherlands, Germany, Cuba, and France. After moving to Pendleton he gradually withdrew from his Charleston-based ventures and began to operate a small business in Pendleton. In 1814, the Maverick family expanded with the birth of another daughter, Lydia. Four years later, when Maverick was fifteen, his mother died.

It is likely that Maverick&#x27;s early education took place at home. In early 1822, he traveled to Ripton, Connecticut, to study under a tutor. In September of that year he was admitted to Yale University as a sophomore. At Yale, he was known as &quot;Sam&quot;. After graduating in 1825, Maverick returned to Pendleton and apprenticed under his father to learn business affairs. For the next year, his father deeded him land, and on February 4, 1826, he made his first land purchase, acquiring half a lot in Pendleton.

In 1828, Maverick traveled to Winchester, Virginia, to study law under Henry St. George Tucker, Sr. He became licensed to practice law in Virginia on March 26, 1829, and several weeks later he received his license to practice in South Carolina. He soon established a law practice in Pendleton. The following year he ran for a seat in the South Carolina legislature, advocating for a peaceful resolution to the tariff problem and against nullification. This was not a popular strategy, and Maverick placed 9th out of 13 candidates, gathering 1,628 votes.

Maverick relocated to Georgia in early 1833, where he unsuccessfully ran a gold mine. He returned home at the end of the year. On January 24, 1834, he left Pendleton for Lauderdale County, Alabama, taking 25 of his father&#x27;s slaves to operate a plantation his father had given him. They arrived in March. Later that year his widowed sister, Mary Elizabeth, moved to Alabama to live near him with her three children. Maverick did not enjoy running a plantation, primarily because he did not like supervising slaves. On March 16, 1835, he left Alabama to go to Texas.

==Texas Revolution==
Maverick took the brig &quot;Henry&quot; from New Orleans and arrived at Velasco, at the mouth of the Brazos River, in April 1835. His interest in Texas extended back almost ten years, as in 1826 he noted in his journal that Stephen F. Austin had received a land grant and that Mexico was quickly being settled. When he arrived, there were fewer than 30,000 people living in the territory, which was then part of Mexico. Maverick immediately set out to buy land, making his first purchase on May 20. To officially transfer the title, Maverick had to go to San Felipe, and he spent the next several months traveling up and down the Brazos River from San Felipe looking for more land to buy. After recovering from a bout of malaria, Maverick journeyed to the drier climate of San Antonio, which was surrounded by large swaths of unclaimed land. Fifteen days after arriving in San Antonio he began buying large tracts of land

At this time there was much political unrest in Texas, as the colonists did not trust Mexican president Antonio López de Santa Anna to abide by the promises that had been made in the Mexican Constitution of 1824. The Mexican government believed that the colonists were preparing to revolt and hand Texas to the United States. After having been held in a Mexican prison for over 18 months, a newly released Austin returned to Texas with stories of what he had seen in the Mexican capital, and on September 19, 1835, he issued a call to arms. The first shot of the Texas Revolution soon occurred at Gonzales. General Martín Perfecto de Cos, the commander of the Mexican army in San Antonio, was distrustful of the Anglos in the area, and on October 16 he placed a guard at the door of the home where Maverick was staying. Maverick, his host John Smith, and another boarder, A.C. Holmes, were forbidden to leave the city. The Texan army soon arrived and, by October 24, had initiated the Siege of Bexar. Maverick had long kept a diary, which provided a &quot;generally faithful eyewitness record of the events&quot; of the siege. During this time, Maverick and his fellow prisoners sent missives to the Texans with information about the occurrences within the city, with many of them going to his childhood friend Thomas Jefferson Rusk.

On December 1, Cos allowed Maverick and Smith to leave the city. They approached the Texan army, offered their first-hand knowledge of the situation, and urged an attack. The commander of the army, Edward Burleson, recommended a retreat instead. Ben Milam offered to lead an attack, and several hundred men volunteered to accompany him. On the morning of December 5, Maverick guided Milam&#x27;s detachment into the city, while Smith guided a second detachment under Colonel Frank Johnson. For five days the men fought building-to-building. During the fighting, Milam took a bullet to the head, and Maverick caught his body as it fell. Cos surrendered on the morning of the sixth day, and Maverick attended the surrender ceremony with Burleson and Johnson.

The provisional Texas government had decided in November that all land sales in Texas after August 20, 1835, would be voided, but with the hostilities temporarily over, Maverick continued to buy land in and around San Antonio. He remained with the army stationed at the Alamo. The garrison was prohibited from voting in the election for San Antonio delegates to the Texas independence convention because they were considered transients. The men held their own election, and chose Maverick and James Butler Bonham, who had worked as a lawyer in Pendleton at the same time as Maverick. Bonham declined to accept his nomination, and Jesse Badgett was elected in his place.

Although Badgett left for the convention, Maverick remained at the siege of the Alamo until March 2, the same day the other delegates were signing the Texas Declaration of Independence. By this time the Alamo was surrounded by Mexican troops, and according to Maverick&#x27;s children; when Maverick left, William Barret Travis (the commander of the Texan forces at the Alamo) urged him to convince the convention to send reinforcements. Maverick arrived at the convention on Saturday, March 5, with his friend Smith, who carried one of Travis&#x27;s final missives. The convention was in recess for the weekend, but a special session was called for the following day. By the time the special session concluded, the Battle of the Alamo had concluded, and the Alamo defenders were all dead. Maverick signed the Texas Declaration of Independence the following day, and remained at the convention to help draft the new Texas constitution. Despite his efforts, the new constitution rendered his land claims after August 20 invalid, but it also provided land grants to each resident as of March 2. On March 16, the convention adjourned, having completed a constitution and elected an interim government. Maverick traveled with another delegate to Nacogdoches, where he remained for several weeks while suffering from an illness. After recovering, he returned to Alabama to help his sister.

One may note conflicting reports as to whether Maverick signed the Declaration. While his name is among those omitted from the print published version, his signature clearly appears on page 11 of the hand-written original as &quot;Saml. A Maverick (from Bejar).&quot;

== Marriage and return to Texas ==
Shortly after returning to Alabama, Maverick met eighteen-year-old Mary Ann Adams, whom he married within three months. At the beginning of 1837, he sold his Alabama plantation and with his wife moved to New Orleans, both to receive faster news from Texas and to supervise the agent who was conducting mercantile activities on his behalf. In March, Maverick brought his wife to South Carolina to meet his father. The elder Maverick offered to give the newlyweds his plantation, but Maverick refused as he wished to return to Texas. While they were in South Carolina, Mary Maverick gave birth to a boy, Samuel Maverick, Jr.

In October 1837, the new family and seven slaves left South Carolina. After a brief stop in Tuscaloosa, they traveled overland to the Republic of Texas, accompanied by their slaves, Mary&#x27;s brother Robert, and his three slaves. The party reached Texas near New Year&#x27;s Day 1838. On February 4, they reached the home of George Sutherland in Jackson County, and the bulk of the traveling party remained as boarders there for the next four months. Maverick continued to San Antonio and began buying headright certificates using the money he received from the sale of his lands in Alabama. He received his own headright on March 2 after four citizens testified that Maverick had participated in the Texas Revolution.

Maverick&#x27;s family joined him in San Antonio on June 15, 1838, where they rented rooms in the same home as Mary&#x27;s brother William. They purchased their own home along the San Antonio River in early 1839, where their son Lewis Antonio Maverick was born in March 1839.

By the end of 1839, Maverick had purchased 41 lots. He assumed that there would be an influx of settlers eager to buy the land, but emigration slowed after 1838. Maverick received his Texas law license in November 1838 and began arguing cases in district court. In January 1839 he was elected the mayor of San Antonio. During his one-year term, he also acted as city treasurer and served as a precinct justice of the peace. For the next several years, Maverick spent a great deal of time away from home, either surveying frontier lands or traveling to New Orleans on business. He narrowly escaped death while on a surveying trip in late 1839. Because he had promised his wife that he would be home on a specific day, Maverick left the surveying camp early. Later that day, Comanches raided the camp and killed all but one person, who was scalped.

Comanche raids were frequent in the San Antonio area, and Maverick joined the militia. When an attack was noticed, the church bell would ring, and Maverick and his fellow militia members would have to be ready to leave within 15 minutes. They would chase the raiders with the hopes of recovering captives and any stolen goods. Maverick participated in the Council House Fight on March 19, 1840, as the citizens of San Antonio attempted to capture or kill a band of Indians who had reneged on previous agreements to return captives. Two days after the fight, Maverick left for New Orleans, leaving his family under the protection of his wife&#x27;s two brothers. During his trip, he collected money from rents on various properties and sold more of his lands in Alabama and South Carolina. He used the money to buy two years of provisions, which he shipped to Linnville. Before he could escort the goods to San Antonio, a band of Indians led by Buffalo Hump raided Linnville and destroyed all of the supplies.

In December 1840, his wife&#x27;s uncle, John Bradley, moved to Texas with his wife and their young children and settled near the Mavericks. By the end of the year, Maverick owned full title to , with under survey. The following year, Maverick became the treasurer of the city council.

== Imprisonment ==
In February 1842, word came that Santa Anna was again sending troops into Texas, which Mexico still regarded as a rebellious province. The Mavericks joined a group of Anglo Texans fleeing San Antonio, an event later known as the Runaway of &#x27;42. After a brief stop in Seguin, they moved on to Gonzales, and squatted in a house left empty when the owners had fled in the Runaway. Maverick and the other men in the party joined Texan army troops to retake San Antonio, but the Vásquez Expedition retreated without a fight, although they caused extensive damage to the homes of the Texas citizens.

Maverick moved his family to La Grange after several Indian scares in Gonzales, and on April 30 he left for Alabama to retrieve his wife&#x27;s younger sister, who had been living alone since her mother died the year before. Maverick returned to Texas in July, and the following month he again left his family, this time to go to San Antonio to argue a case before the district court. In early September, San Antonio was surrounded by Mexican troops led by General Adrian Woll. The approximately 60 Anglo-Texans in town gathered in Maverick&#x27;s home, but were soon forced to surrender to the army.

On September 15, the Anglos were forced to march towards Mexico with a guard of 150 Mexican soldiers. Two bands of Texans tried to rescue them; neither succeeded, and the second, which included Mary&#x27;s uncle John Bradley, was also captured and joined Maverick&#x27;s group in their march. For three months the group marched, finally stopping at San Carlos Fortress in Perote, Veracruz. Although the journey was difficult and the men were often forced to sleep in manure-filled sheep pens, in his journal Maverick wrote that he &quot;saw and experienced a thousand new thrills.&quot; On the fifth day after their arrival at the fortress, the men were chained together in pairs. Several days later they were put to hard labor. On behalf of the men, Maverick complained about the almost non-existent food rations and was rewarded with solitary confinement on January 5, 1843.

Despite his imprisonment and the fact that his family now lived in Fayette County, Maverick was elected by the people of San Antonio to represent them in the Seventh Texas Congress. He was unable to attend the legislative session. Maverick was offered his freedom several times, on the condition that he publicly support Mexico&#x27;s claim to Texas. Maverick responded, &quot;I cannot persuade myself that such an annexation, on any terms, would be advantageous to Texas, and I therefore cannot say so, for I regard a lie as a crime, and one which I cannot commit even to secure my release.&quot; The Mexican government finally released him on March 30, the same day his wife gave birth to a daughter, whom she named Augusta. On May 4 Maverick returned home, bringing with him the chain with which he had been bound.

==Texas Congress==
By June, Maverick had returned to San Antonio on court and land business. He was reelected to the Texas House of Representatives, gaining 202 votes, the highest total of the 3 candidates. As part of the 8th Texas Congress, Maverick and his colleagues met at Washington-on-the-Brazos rather than at the state capital, Austin, which was vulnerable to Indian and Mexican raids. In his time in office, Maverick helped pass a bill, over President Sam Houston&#x27;s veto, which repealed Houston&#x27;s ability to grant colonization contracts. Maverick added a clause specifying that previously granted contracts would be forfeited if their terms were not met in the future. As chair of the Enrolled Bills Committee, he helped certify which bills were correctly submitted to the President. He was also a member of the Finance, Public Lands and Indian Affairs committees, as well as the committee on Foreign Relations, which castigated Houston for not providing information to the Congress on his annexation negotiations with the United States.

== Land baron ==
Mary Maverick and their children were often ill, and in November 1844 the family sold their land along the Colorado River and moved to Decrow&#x27;s Point, across from Port Cavallo on Matagorda Bay. They lived there for three years, where the new climate helped them to stay healthier.

In 1844, the tax rolls showed that Maverick owned by title in Bexar County and Bexar Territory, with an additional 20,077 by survey, as well as 21 town lots. The following year he also purchased for his father, intended to be an inheritance for Maverick&#x27;s children and nieces and nephews. Since 1840, Maverick had tripled his land holdings. As he was bringing the land documents home in June 1845, the boat he was in capsized. Maverick barely survived drowning and lost all of his papers.

== Later years ==
After Texas&#x27; annexation by the United States, he was elected to the Texas Legislature. Fifteen years later, as the American Civil War loomed, Maverick supported Sam Houston in his call to support the Union. Nevertheless, he voted for secession as a member of the convention. Shortly afterward, he accompanied Philip N. Luckett and another Texas commissioner of safety to negotiate with U.S. Army General David E. Twiggs for the peaceful surrender of Federal garrisons in Texas.

Maverick served once again as mayor of San Antonio from 1862 to 1863. After the Civil War was over, he helped John H. Reagan to reorganize the Democratic Party.

He died on September 2, 1870, and is interred at San Antonio City Cemetery No. 1.

Maverick County, Texas, is named for him. U.S. Representative from Texas Maury Maverick (1895–1954) was his grandson.

== Alamo cannon ==
During construction of Maverick&#x27;s house in 1852, 13 of the 21 cannons used during the Battle of the Alamo were unearthed. They had been damaged and buried by retreating Mexican soldiers following the Battle of San Jacinto. The Maverick family donated them to the Alamo Mission where they are now on display.

== Cattle branding ==

Maverick steadfastly refused to brand his cattle. As a result, the word &quot;maverick&quot;, slang for someone who exhibits a streak of stubborn independence, also entered the English lexicon as a term for an unbranded range animal.

Maverick&#x27;s stated reason for not branding his cattle was that he didn&#x27;t want to inflict pain on them. Other ranchers suspected his true motivation was that it allowed him to collect any unbranded cattle and claim them as his own – though written accounts of his lack of interest in his herd and its failure to grow during his ownership undermine this claim.

Mary Maverick appended to her memoirs certain of her husband&#x27;s correspondence and an extract of a letter from George Madison Maverick, her son and collaborator in her biography, to the &quot;St. Louis Republic&quot;, apparently in response to an appeal to persons having sure information about the matter to convey their accounts to the editor.

George recounted that, in 1845, his father, whose interest was in real estate, acquired some 400 head of cattle that he did not want from a neighbor as payment of a $1,200 (~$ in ) debt. Maverick left them to be managed by an African American family, who subsequently moved from the Gulf coast to the Conquista Ranch on the San Antonio River, where the cattle were left to multiply, graze, and wander away. Over a decade later, enough had wandered off, or been taken by others, that the number of head ostensibly belonging to Maverick remained the same. Whether rounded up without an identifying mark or taken because they lacked one, many such so-called &quot;mavericks&quot; ended up branded by other ranchers and claimed as their own.

In 1856, a Mr. Leo J. Toutant followed up on his own father&#x27;s earlier offer to purchase Maverick&#x27;s herd, then numbering some 400, and did so.

<text>The little tern (Sternula albifrons) is a seabird of the family Laridae. It was first described by the German naturalist Peter Simon Pallas in 1764 and given the binomial name &quot;Sterna albifrons&quot;. It was moved to the genus &quot;Sternula&quot; when the genus &quot;Sterna&quot; was restricted to the larger typical terns. The genus name &quot;Sternula&quot; is a diminutive of &quot;Sterna&quot;, &#x27;tern&#x27;, while the specific name &quot;albifrons&quot; is from Latin &quot;albus&quot;, &#x27;white&#x27;, and &quot;frons&quot;, &#x27;forehead&#x27;.

This bird breeds on the coasts and inland waterways of temperate and tropical Europe, Asia, north and west Africa, and eastern Australia. It is strongly migratory, wintering in the subtropical and tropical oceans as far south as South Africa and Australia.

There are four subspecies. The nominate &quot;S. a. albifrons&quot; occurs in Europe to North Africa and western Asia, &quot;S. a. guineae&quot; of western Africa, &quot;S. a. sinensis&quot; in eastern Asia (SE Russia to Japan, SE Asia, Philippines) south to New Guinea and northern Australia, and &quot;S. a. placens&quot; on the east coast of Australia and Tasmania. The former North American subspecies (&quot;S. a. antillarum&quot;) and Red Sea subspecies &quot;S. a. saundersi&quot; are now considered to be separate species, the least tern (&quot;Sternula antillarum&quot;) and Saunders&#x27;s tern (&quot;Sternula saundersi&quot;), respectively.

The little tern breeds in colonies on gravel or shingle coasts and islands. It lays two to four eggs on the ground. Like all white terns, it is defensive of its nest and young and will attack intruders.

Like most other white terns, the little tern feeds by plunge-diving for fish, either in coastal saline environments, or inland, along larger rivers. The offering of fish by the male to the female is part of the courtship display.

This is a small tern, 21–25 cm long with a 41–47 cm wingspan. It is not likely to be confused with other species, apart from fairy tern and Saunders&#x27;s tern, because of its size and white forehead in breeding plumage. Its thin sharp bill is yellow with a black tip and its legs are also yellow. In winter, the forehead is more extensively white, the bill is black and the legs duller. The call is a loud and distinctive creaking noise.

== Populations on European rivers ==

At the beginning of the 19th century the little tern was a common bird of European shores, rivers and wetlands, but in the 20th century populations of coastal areas decreased because of habitat loss, pollution and human disturbance.

The loss of inland populations has been even more severe, since due to dams, river regulation and sediment extraction it has lost most of its former habitats. The little tern population has declined or become extinct in many European countries, and former breeding places on large rivers like the Danube, Elbe and Rhine ceased. Nowadays, only a few river systems in Europe possess suitable habitats; the Loire/Allier in France, the Vistula/Odra in Poland, the Po/Ticino in Italy, the Daugava in Latvia, the Nemunas in Lithuania, the Sava in Croatia and the Drava in Hungary and Croatia. The status of the little tern on the rivers Tagus and lower Danube is uncertain.

The Drava population is one of the most threatened. Old-fashioned water management practices, including river regulation and sediment extraction, endanger the remaining pairs. Only 15 pairs still breed on extensive sand or gravel banks along the border between Hungary and Croatia. The WWF and its partners are involved in working for the protection of this bird and this unique European river ecosystem. The little tern is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies.

<doc id="314114" wikidata="Q1500482" url="?curid=314114" title="Pharyngealization">
<text>Pharyngealization is a secondary articulation of consonants or vowels by which the pharynx or epiglottis is constricted during the articulation of the sound.

==IPA symbols==
In the International Phonetic Alphabet, pharyngealization can be indicated by one of two methods:
#A tilde or swung dash (IPA Number 428) is written through the base letter (typographic overstrike). It is the older and more generic symbol. It indicates velarization, uvularization or pharyngealization, as in , the guttural equivalent of .
#The symbol (IPA Number 423) – a superscript variant of , the voiced pharyngeal approximant – is written after the base letter. It indicates specifically a pharyngealized consonant, as in , a pharyngealized .

== Computing codes ==
Since Unicode 1.1, there have been two similar superscript characters: IPA () and Semiticist (). U+02E4 is formally a superscript (, = reversed glottal stop), and in the Unicode charts looks like a simple superscript , though in some fonts it looks like a superscript reversed lower-case letter glottal stop . U+02C1 is a typographic alternative to (); which is used to transliterate the Semitic consonant ayin and which = reversed , which itself transliterates the glottal Semitic consonants aleph and hamza. In the Unicode charts U+02C1 looks like a reversed (), which is used in the IPA for glottalization. There is no parallel Unicode distinction for modifier glottal stop. The IPA Handbook lists U+02E4 as the Unicode equivalent of IPA Number 423, the dedicated IPA symbol for pharyngealization.

The superimposed tilde is assigned Unicode character U+0334. This was originally intended to combine with other letters to represent pharyngealization. However, that usage is now deprecated (though still functional), and several precomposed letters have been adopted to replace it. These are the labial consonants and the coronal consonants .

==Usage==
Ubykh, an extinct Northwest Caucasian language spoken in Russia and Turkey, used pharyngealization in 14 pharyngealized consonants. Chilcotin has pharyngealized consonants that trigger pharyngealization of vowels. Many languages (such as Salishan, Sahaptian) in the Plateau culture area of North America also have pharyngealization processes that are triggered by pharyngeal or pharyngealized consonants, which affect vowels.

The Tuu/&quot;Khoisan&quot; language Taa (or !Xóõ) has pharyngealized vowels that contrast phonemically with voiced, breathy and epiglottalized vowels. That feature is represented in the orthography by a tilde under the respective pharyngealized vowel. In Tuu languages, epiglottalized vowels are phonemic.

For many languages, pharyngealization is generally associated with more dental articulations of coronal consonants. Dark l tends to be dental or denti-alveolar, but clear l tends to be retracted to an alveolar position.

Arabic and Syriac use secondary uvularization, which is generally not distinguished from pharyngealization, for the &quot;emphatic&quot; coronal consonants.

<doc id="314115" wikidata="Q430964" url="?curid=314115" title="Hōjō Tokimune">
<text>of the Hōjō clan was the eighth &quot;shikken&quot; (officially regent of the shōgun, but &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of Japan) of the Kamakura shogunate (reigned 1268–84), known for leading the Japanese forces against the invasion of the Mongols and for spreading Zen Buddhism. He was the second son of Tokiyori, fifth shikken of the Kamakura shogunate. From birth, Tokimune was seen as the successor of &quot;tokusō&quot;, the head of the Hōjō clan. In 1268 AD, at the age of 18, he became &quot;shikken&quot; himself. During his lifetime, the seats of power of the Japanese Emperor, Imperial Regent (&quot;sesshō&quot;), Imperial Chief Advisor (&quot;kampaku&quot;), and the &quot;shōgun&quot; had all been completely marginalized by the Hōjō &quot;shikken&quot;.

== Life ==
Immediately upon his ascension as &quot;shikken&quot;, Tokimune was faced with a national crisis. The Mongol emperor, Kublai Khan, sent an envoy with the demand that Japan enter into a &quot;tributary relationship&quot; with the Mongols or face invasion and conquest. While many in the Japanese government, including members of the royal family, urged that a compromise be reached, the regent defiantly rejected the Mongol demand and sent back the headless bodies of the emissaries. 

Because of his influence, Zen Buddhism became firmly established in Kamakura, then later in Kyoto and in the whole of Japan, especially among the warrior class.

In 1271, he banished Nichiren to Sado Island.

After the war with the Mongols ended, Tokimune turned his attention to other matters, like practicing Zen meditation and building Buddhist shrines and monasteries, such as the one at Engaku-ji as a memorial to those samurai who had died defeating the Mongols. As a teen and young man, he had been an advocate of the Ritsu sect of Buddhism, but converted to Zen at some point before the invasion. He was so committed to his faith that he &quot;took the tonsure and became a Zen monk&quot; on the day that he died.

== Defiance of Mongols ==
The Mongols had sent a threatening letter and emissaries to Japan in January 1268, and after discussion, Tokimune decided to have the emissaries sent back with no answer. The Mongols sent more emissaries time and time again: on 7 March 1269, on 17 September 1269, in September 1271 and in May 1272. But Tokimune had the emissaries of Kublai Khan driven away, without even permission to land each time. Soon after came the first invasion in 1274. But even after the failed invasion, five emissaries were sent in September 1275 to Kyūshū, and refused to leave without reply. Tokimune responded by having them brought to Kamakura and then beheading them. The graves of the five executed Mongol emissaries exist to this day in Kamakura at Tatsunokuchi. Then again on 29 July 1279, five more emissaries were sent, and again beheaded, this time in Hakata. Expecting an invasion, on 21 February 1280, the Imperial Court ordered all temples and shrines to pray for victory over the Mongol Empire. Kublai Khan gathered up troops for another invasion in 1281, which again was a failure, due in part to a typhoon.

Japan was saved, never to be threatened again by an invasion until the end of the Second World War. 

== Zen advice ==
The Mongol invasion had been stopped by a typhoon (&quot;Kamikaze&quot;, &quot;divine wind&quot;), and the resistance of the new warrior class known as samurai. Tokimune planned and led the defence. Tokimune wanted to defeat cowardice, so he asked Mugaku Sogen (his Zen master) for advice. Mugaku Sogen replied he had to sit in meditation to find the source of his cowardice in himself.

When the Mongols invaded Japan, Tokimune went to Mugaku and said, &quot;Finally there is the greatest event of my life.&quot; Mugaku asked, &quot;How do you plan to face it?&quot; Tokimune shouted, &quot;Katsu!&quot; (literally &quot;Victory!&quot;), demonstrating his resolve to triumph over the invaders. Mugaku responded with satisfaction: &quot;It is true that the son of a lion roars as a lion!&quot;

In part to the victory over the Mongols under Tokimune&#x27;s guidance, Zen Buddhism began to spread among the samurai class with some rapidity.

Tokimune also linked Zen with the &quot;moral&quot; code of the samurai class (later called bushido) that stressed frugality, martial arts, loyalty and &quot;honor unto death.&quot; Born from neo-Confucianism, bushido under Tokimune was mixed with elements of Shinto and Zen, adding a dose of wisdom and serenity to the otherwise violent code. Eventually, under the later Tokugawa shogunate, some of these teachings of bushido would be formalized in Japanese feudal law.

==In popular culture==
*NHK&#x27;s 2001 taiga drama series named &quot;Hōjō Tokimune&quot; highlighted the dramatic events just prior to Tokimune&#x27;s birth and up to his death in 1284. Tokimune was portrayed by kyōgen actor, Motoya Izumi.
*Hōjō Tokimune leads the Japanese civilization in the 2016 4X video game &quot;Civilization VI&quot;. His leader ability, Divine Wind, grants bonus combat strength to units on coastal tiles. As a civilization, Japan&#x27;s specialty districts gain an additional +1 adjacency bonus for each adjacent specialty district, a reference to the Meiji Restoration. This means that the districts become more powerful.

<text>was a Japanese political economist in the late Edo period.

Born in Echigo, Toshiaki went to Edo to study astronomy, mathematics and kendo. At the age of 24, he opened his own school. He wrote &quot;A Secret Plan of Government&quot; (&quot;Keisei Hisaku&quot;; 経世秘策), in which he proposed lifting a ban of a foreign trade and colonization of Ezo, and &quot;Tales of the West&quot; (&quot;Seiiki Monogatari&quot;; 西域物語), both in 1798.

Toshiaki was a polymath who knew a bit about the Western world, and wrote that Japan ought to mimic the policies of England, another island country, and &quot;called for more active official promotion of national wealth and strength&quot;. In particular, he wrote about four goals for the Japan of his day: 
* Production of gunpowder
* Smelting of iron and other metals
* Setting up a merchant fleet
* Settlement of Ezo in the north

<doc id="314123" wikidata="Q9604672" url="?curid=314123" title="The Thackery T. Lambshead Pocket Guide to Eccentric &amp; Discredited Diseases">
<text>The Thackery T. Lambshead Pocket Guide to Eccentric &amp; Discredited Diseases (2003) is an anthology of fantasy medical conditions edited by Jeff VanderMeer and Mark Roberts, and published by Night Shade Books. A second edition was published by Spectra in 2005.

== Contents ==
The &quot;Guide&quot; claims to be 83rd edition of a medical reference text first compiled by the fictional Dr. Thackery T. Lambshead in 1915. It contains generally humorous entries (in varying degrees of darkness) with describing fantastical diseases, which together detail the &quot;secret medical history&quot; of the 20th century. Each entry presents a history of the disease, its characteristic symptoms, and any cure that might exist, all written in a faux encyclopedic style. Many diseases are accompanied by illustrations. The book also includes essays about the adventures of the titular Thackery T. Lambshead, &quot;a sort of medical Indiana Jones.&quot; Appendices to the book include a history of its many editions, and biographies of the many contributing authors, named as &quot;doctors,&quot; in which their writing career is recast as a medical career.

== Reception ==
In 2004, the book was shortlisted for a Hugo Award for Best Related Book and a World Fantasy Award for Best Anthology. 

A sequel anthology was released in 2011 called &quot;The Thackery T. Lambshead Cabinet of Curiosities&quot;, which was co-edited by Jeff and Ann VanderMeer.

The encyclopedia makes an appearance in the novel &quot;Monstrocity&quot; by Jeffrey Thomas. It is also referenced in VanderMeer&#x27;s own collection &quot;City of Saints and Madmen&quot;.

<text>Jody Williams (born October 9, 1950) is an American political activist known for her work in banning anti-personnel landmines, her defense of human rights (especially those of women), and her efforts to promote new understandings of security in today&#x27;s world. She was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1997 for her work toward the banning and clearing of anti-personnel mines.

== Education ==
Williams earned a Master in International Relations from the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies (a division of Johns Hopkins University) in Washington, D.C. (1984), an MA in teaching Spanish and English as a second language from the School for International Training (SIT) in Brattleboro, Vermont (1976), and a BA from the University of Vermont (1972).

== Advocacy ==
Williams served as the founding coordinator of the International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL) from early 1992 until February 1998. Before that work, she spent eleven years on various projects related to the wars in Nicaragua and El Salvador, where, according to the &quot;Encyclopedia of Human Rights&quot;, she &quot;spent the 1980s performing life-threatening human rights work.&quot;

In an cooperative effort with governments, UN bodies and the International Committee of the Red Cross, Williams served as a chief strategist and spokesperson for the ICBL, which she developed from two non-governmental organizations (NGOs) with a staff of one – herself – to an international powerhouse of 1,300 NGOs in ninety countries.

From its small beginning and official launch in 1992, Williams and the ICBL achieved the campaign&#x27;s goal of an international treaty banning antipersonnel landmines during a diplomatic conference held in Oslo in September 1997. The Ottawa Treaty that banned land-mines is credited to her and the ICBL. Three weeks later, she and the ICBL were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. At that time, she became the tenth woman – and third American woman – in its almost hundred-year history to receive the Prize. 
In November 2004, after discussions with Iranian Peace Laureates Shirin Ebadi and Professor Wangari Maathai of Kenya, Williams established the Nobel Women&#x27;s Initiative which was launched in January 2006. Williams has since served as its chair. This initiative brought together six of the female Peace Laureates, the women seek to use their influence to promote the work of women working for peace with justice and equality. (Aung San Suu Kyi is an honorary member.)

In 2020, Williams called upon Chevron Corporation to pay cleanup costs to the residents of the Lago Agrio oil field which were awarded in 2011 and have been in litigation ever since.

Williams is quoted as saying, &quot;The image of peace with a dove flying over a rainbow and people holding hands singing kumbaya ends up infantilizing people who believe that sustainable peace is possible. If you think that singing and looking at a rainbow will suddenly make peace appear then you&#x27;re not capable of meaningful thought, or understanding the difficulties of the world.&quot;

In 2019, Williams called for a treaty to end violence against women, in support of Every Woman Coalition.

== Academic career ==
Since 2007, Williams has been the Sam and Cele Keeper Professor in Peace and Social Justice in the Graduate College of Social Work at the University of Houston. Before that she had been a distinguished visiting professor of global justice at the college since 2003.

== Recognition ==
Williams continues to be recognized for her contributions to human rights and global security. She is the recipient of fifteen honorary degrees. In 2004, in its first such listing, she was named by &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine as one of the 100 most powerful women in the world. She is one of the female Nobel Prize laureates to be recognized as a &quot;Woman of the Year&quot; by &quot;Glamour&quot; magazine – which has also honoured Hillary Clinton, Katie Couric and Barbara Walters.

== Publications ==
Williams&#x27; work includes articles for magazines and newspapers, for example the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot;, &quot;The Independent&quot; (UK), &quot;The Irish Times&quot;, &quot;The Toronto Globe and Mail&quot;, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;La Jornada&quot; (Mexico), &quot;The Review of the International Red Cross&quot;, Columbia University&#x27;s &quot;Journal of Politics and Society&quot;.

She added several chapters to numerous books:

* &quot;The Personal Philosophies of Remarkable Men and Women&quot;, edited by Jay Allison and Dan Gediman; 
* &quot;A Memory, A Monologue, A Rant, and A Prayer&quot; 
* &quot;Lessons from our Fathers&quot;, by Keith McDermott
* &quot;Girls Like Us: 40 Extraordinary Women Celebrate Girlhood in Story, Poetry and Song&quot;, by Gina Misiroglu; 
* &quot;The Way We Will be 50 Years from Today: 60 of the World&#x27;s Greatest Minds Share Their Visions of the Next Half-Century&quot;
* Williams co-authored a seminal book on the landmine crisis in 1995, &quot;After the Guns Fall Silent: The Enduring Legacy of Landmines&quot;. 
* Her book, released at the end of March 2008, &quot;Banning Landmines: Disarmament, Citizen Diplomacy and Human Security&quot;, analyzes the Mine Ban Treaty and its impact on other human security- related work. 
* In March 2013, her memoir, &quot;My Name Is Jody Williams: A Vermont Girl&#x27;s Winding Path to the Nobel Peace Prize&quot;, was released.

<doc id="314126" wikidata="Q1054305" url="?curid=314126" title="Imagawa Yoshimoto">
<text>was a Japanese &quot;daimyō&quot; (feudal lord) of the Sengoku period. Based in Suruga Province, he was known as ; he was one of the three &quot;daimyō&quot; that dominated the Tōkaidō region. He died in 1560 while marching to Kyoto to become Shogun. He was killed in the village of Dengakuhazama in Okehazama by Oda Nobunaga.

==Early life and succession==
Yoshimoto was born as in 1519, the third son of Imagawa Ujichika of the Imagawa clan, which claimed descent from Emperor Seiwa (850–880). His childhood name was Yosakimaru (芳菊丸). His family branched from Minamoto clan by the Ashikaga clan. As he was not the eldest son, he was not an heir to his father&#x27;s lordship. As a result, the young boy was sent to a temple where his name was changed to or . 

In 1536, his older brother Ujiteru died suddenly, unleashing successional disputes. His elder half-brother, , tried to seize the lordship, but the clan split into two factions. Yoshimoto&#x27;s faction argued he was the rightful heir because Yoshimoto&#x27;s mother (Jukei-ni) was the consort of Ujichika. Genkō Etan&#x27;s faction disputed this based on Genkō&#x27;s seniority, and that his mother was a member of the Kushima family. However, with the assistance of Hojo Ujitsuna of Sagami province and support of Takeda Nobutora of Kai province, the Genkō faction was eliminated in the . 
Baigaku Shōhō changed his name to Yoshimoto at this point and succeeded the clan.

==Imagawa Campaigns==
After Yoshimoto succeeded to family headship, he married the sister of Takeda Shingen of Kai. This allowed Yoshimoto to cement an alliance with the Takeda when he helped Shingen imprison his father, Takeda Nobutora, in 1540. Soon after, the Later Hōjō clan invaded into the Suruga province but Yoshimoto defeated the Hōjō&#x27;s force. 

In 1542, Yoshimoto began his advance into Mikawa Province, in an effort to fight the growing influence of Oda Nobuhide in that region, but was defeated in the 1542 Battle of Azukizaka. 

Later in 1548, Yoshimoto defeated Nobuhide in the Second Battle of Azukizaka and continued to expand his territory until 1560. In campaigns over the course of the ensuing decades, Yoshimoto wrested control over the Suruga, Totomi, and Mikawa provinces.

In 1552, Shingen&#x27;s son, Takeda Yoshinobu, married Yoshimoto&#x27;s daughter. Yoshimoto and the Hōjō clan reached a peace agreement in 1554 with the marriage of Yoshimoto&#x27;s son, Imagawa Ujizane, to the daughter of Hōjō Ujiyasu, Lady Hayakawa. 

In 1554, the Imagawa clan came to the west and built the Muraki Castle in the southeast of Owari, besieging Mizuno Nobumoto (uncle of Tokugawa Ieyasu) in his castle of Ogawa, who defected from the Imagawa in favor of an alliance with Oda Nobunaga.

In 1558, Yoshimoto sent Matsudaira Motoyasu to attack Terabe Castle, but were driven off by reinforcements sent by Oda Nobunaga. Later, Yoshimoto left the clan&#x27;s political affairs in Ujizane&#x27;s hands, in order to focus on dealing with the advance westward into Mikawa and Owari.

==Death==
In the summer of 1560, after forming a three-way alliance with the Takeda and the Hōjō, Yoshimoto headed out to the capital with Matsudaira Motoyasu (later known as &#x27;Tokugawa Ieyasu&#x27;) of Mikawa in the vanguard. Despite having a strong force of 25,000, Yoshimoto deliberately announced that he had 40,000 troops. While this statement put fear in many factions, Oda Nobunaga was not dissuaded. (Some historical sources support the claim of 40,000.)

After capturing several castles from the Oda clan, Yoshimoto&#x27;s army let its guard down, celebrating with song and sake. However, Oda Nobunaga launched a surprise attack with his army of 3,000 following a downpour and defeated Yoshimoto&#x27;s army. Two Oda samurai (Mōri Shinsuke and Hattori Koheita) ambushed and killed Yoshimoto in the village of Dengakuhazama.

Ujizane succeeded to family headship after Yoshimoto&#x27;s death, but the Imagawa clan fell from power. Ujizane was later summoned by Tokugawa Ieyasu and became a &quot;kōke&quot; in the administration of the Tokugawa clan. Yoshimoto&#x27;s niece was Lady Tsukiyama, the wife of Tokugawa Ieyasu.

Yoshimoto has several graves; his body itself is buried at Daisei-ji, a temple in the city of Toyokawa in modern Aichi Prefecture.

He is a playable character in &quot;Pokémon Conquest&quot; (Pokémon + Nobunaga&#x27;s Ambition in Japan), with his partner Pokémon being Pineco and Forretress.

In the &quot;Samurai Warriors&quot; series, Yoshimoto is represented as a foolish old-fashioned nobleman. His weapon is a kemari which is inspired by his son, Ujizane&#x27;s historical obsession towards kemari. In &quot;Samurai Warriors 5&quot;, however, where he fights with a warhammer and his ancestral katana Samonji, he is instead portrayed as an arrogant but effective leader who is a persistent threat to the young Oda Nobunaga, even defeating him in combat in one battle and forcing the Oda army to withdraw, before his eventual defeat at Okehazama.

A female version of Yoshimoto appears in anime The Ambition of Oda Nobuna. In this version, instead of dying Yoshimoto is spared and later installed as a figurehead Shōgun to legitimize Nobuna&#x27;s claim to Kyoto.

In Sengoku Basara game and anime series, he was shown to be a weak leader, using his vassals as decoys while trying to retreat. In anime version, he was killed by Oda Nobunaga.

<text>The púca (Irish for &quot;spirit/ghost&quot;; plural púcaí), puca (Old English for &quot;goblin&quot;), also pwca, pookah, phouka, and puck, is a creature of Celtic, English, and Channel Islands folklore. Considered to be bringers both of good and bad fortune, they could help or hinder rural and marine communities. Púcaí can have dark or white fur or hair. The creatures were said to be shape-changers that could take the appearance of horses, goats, cats, dogs, and hares. They may also take a human form, which includes various animal features, such as animal ears or a tail.

==Etymology and analogues==
The origin of the name is debated, with some theorising that it originated in the Irish language, but with a different spelling as there was no &quot;p&quot; sound in Primitive Irish. It appears, from place name evidence, to have been in use as early as the 8th century. Since it is a &#x27;cultural&#x27; rather than a practical word that might be used in trading, it is thought to reflect greater cultural contact between Celtic and Germanic cultures in the early medieval period than had been thought.

The &quot;púca&quot; has counterparts throughout the Celtic and Germanic cultures of Northwest Europe. For instance, in Scandinavian languages, we find, according to the OED, &quot;Old Icelandic &quot;púki&quot; mischievous demon, the Devil, Faroese &quot;púki&quot;, Norwegian (originally and chiefly regional) &quot;puke&quot; devil, evil spirit, mischievous person, Old Swedish &quot;puke&quot; devil, evil spirit, Swedish (now chiefly regional) &quot;puke&quot; evil spirit, devil, goblin), Old Danish &quot;puge&quot; evil spirit&quot;. In Welsh mythology, it is named the pwca and in Cornish the &quot;Bucca&quot; (thus being related in etymology and milieu to the bugaboo). In the Channel Islands, the pouque were said to be fairies who lived near ancient stones; in Norman French of the Islands (e.g. Jèrriais), a cromlech, or prehistoric tomb, is referred to as a &quot;pouquelée&quot; or &quot;pouquelay(e)&quot;; &quot;poulpiquet&quot; and &quot;polpegan&quot; are corresponding terms in Brittany.

== Nature of the púca ==
The púca may be regarded as being either menacing or beneficial. Fairy mythologist Thomas Keightley said &quot;notions respecting it are very vague&quot;, and in a brief description gives an account collected by Croker from a boy living near Killarney that &quot;old people used to say that the Pookas were very numerous ... long ago ... , were wicked-minded, black-looking, bad things ... that would come in the form of wild colts, with chains hanging about them&quot;, and that did much to harm unwary travellers. Also, little bad boys and girls were warned not to eat overripe blackberries, because this was a sign that the pooka has entered them.

One theme of the púca&#x27;s folklore is their proclivity for mischief. They are commonly said to entice humans to take a ride on their back, giving the rider a wild and terrifying journey before dropping the unlucky person back at the place they were taken from. This lore bears similarities to other Irish folk creatures, such as the &quot;daoine maithe&quot; (good people) or the &quot;slua sí&quot; (fairy host), said to target humans on the road or along their regular &quot;passes&quot;. These human encounters of the púca tend to occur in rural, isolated places, far from settlements or homes&quot;.&quot;

While púca stories can be found across northern Europe, Irish tales specify a protective measure for encountering a púca. It is said that the rider may be able to take control of the púca by wearing sharp spurs, using those to prevent being taken or to steer the creature if already on its back.

A translation of an Irish púca story, &quot;An Buachaill Bó agus an Púca&quot;, told by storyteller Seán Ó Cróinín, describes this method of control of the púca as done by a young boy who had been the creature&#x27;s target once before:

... the farmer asked the lad what had kept him out so late. The lad told him.

&quot;I have spurs,&quot; said the farmer. &quot;Put them on you tonight and if he brings you give him the spurs!&quot; And this the lad did. The thing threw him from its back and the lad got back early enough. Within a week the (pooka) was before him again after housing the cows.

&quot;Come to me,&quot; said the lad, &quot;so I can get up on your back.&quot;

&quot;Have you the sharp things on?&quot; said the animal.

&quot;Certainly,&quot; said the lad.

&quot;Oh I won&#x27;t go near you, then,&quot; he said.
The protective power of the &quot;sharp things&quot;, as they are always referred to by the pooka in the tales, may stem from the Irish belief that &quot;cold iron&quot; has the ability to ward off the supernatural.

In contrast, the púca is represented as being helpful to farmers by Lady Wilde, who relates the following tale. A farmer&#x27;s son named Padraig one day noticed the invisible presence of the púca brushing by, and called out to him, offering a coat. The púca appeared in the guise of a young bull, and told him to come to the old mill at night. From that time onward, the púca came secretly at night and performed all the work of milling the sacks of corn into flour. Padraig fell asleep the first time, but later concealed himself in a chest to catch sight of them, and later made a present of a fine silk suit. This unexpectedly caused the púca to go off to &quot;see a little of the world&quot; and cease its work. But by then the farmer&#x27;s wealth allowed him to retire and give his son an education. Later, at Padraig&#x27;s wedding, the púca left a gift of a golden cup filled with drink that evidently ensured their happiness.

Another example of the púca as a benevolent or protective entity comes in tales where the creature intervenes before a terrible accident or before the person is about to happen upon a malevolent fairy or spirit. In several of the regional variants of the stories where the púca is acting as a guardian, the púca identifies itself to the bewildered human. This is particularly noteworthy as it is in contrast to the lore of many other folkloric beings, who guard their identities or names from humans.

There are stories of some púcaí being blood-thirsty and vampire-like creatures. Other stories even say some are man-eating beings, hunting down, killing, and eating their victims.

==Morphology and physiology==
According to legend, the púca is a deft shapeshifter, capable of assuming a variety of terrifying or pleasing forms. It can take a human form, but will often have animal features, such as ears or a tail. As an animal, the púca will most commonly appear as a horse, cat, rabbit, raven, fox, wolf, goat, goblin, or dog. No matter what shape the púca takes, its fur is almost always dark. It most commonly takes the form of a sleek black horse with a flowing mane and luminescent golden eyes. The Manx &quot;glashtyn&quot; also takes on human form, but he usually betrays his horse&#x27;s ears and is analogous to the each uisce.

If a human is enticed onto a púca&#x27;s back, it has been known to give them a wild ride; however, unlike a kelpie, which will take its rider and dive into the nearest stream or lake to drown and devour them, the púca will do its rider no real harm. However, according to some folklorists, the only man ever to ride the púca was Brian Boru, High King of Ireland, by using a special bridle incorporating three hairs of the púca&#x27;s tail. The púca has the power of human speech, and has been known to give advice and lead people away from harm. Though the púca enjoys confusing and often terrifying humans, it is considered to be benevolent.

==Agricultural traditions==
Certain agricultural traditions surround the púca. It is a creature associated with Samhain, a Goidelic harvest festival, when the last of the crops are brought in. Anything remaining in the fields is considered &quot;puka&quot;, or fairy-blasted, and hence inedible. In some locales, reapers leave a small share of the crop, the &quot;púca&#x27;s share&quot;, to placate the hungry creature. Nonetheless, 1 November is the púca&#x27;s day, and the one day of the year when it can be expected to behave civilly.

At the beginning of November, the púca was known—in some locales—to either defecate or spit on the wild fruits rendering them inedible and unsafe thenceforth.

==Regional variations==
In some regions, the púca is spoken of with considerably more respect than fear; if treated with deference, it may actually be beneficial to those who encounter it. The púca is a creature of the mountains and hills, and in those regions there are stories of it appearing on November Day and providing prophecies and warnings to those who consult it.

In some parts of County Down, the púca is manifested as a short, disfigured goblin who demands a share of the harvest; in County Laois, it appears as a monstrous bogeyman, while in Waterford and Wexford the púca appears as an eagle with a huge wingspan and in Roscommon as a black goat.

==Art and popular culture==
Shakespeare&#x27;s 1595 play &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; features the character &quot;Robin Goodfellow,&quot; who is also called &quot;sweet Puck,&quot; a version of the púca.

The title character in the 1944 stage play &quot;Harvey&quot; – later adapted into a 1950 film starring James Stewart – is an invisible six-foot, three-and-a-half-inch (1.92 m) tall anthropomorphic rabbit, who is referred to as a &quot;pooka&quot;.

There is a statue of a púca in Ireland. The 2-meter tall bronze sculpture was erected in the Burren at the Michael Cusack Centre in Carron, Co. Clare in 2022.

In the book &quot;Knock Knock Open Wide&quot; by Neil Sharpson &quot;Puckeen&quot; is a children&#x27;s show and also the name of a mysterious, magical creature who lives in a black box and is never actually shown, only spoken of. In discussions of the book Sharpson has said that the Puckeen was inspired by tales of the púca. 
The 2018 animated series Hilda and the graphic novel series it is based on feature the Pooka. It appears in the third season and is a greedy character who often stops at the home of a relative of the main character to &quot;borrow things&quot;.

<text>Malaysian cuisine (Malay: &quot;Masakan Malaysia&quot;; Jawi: ) consists of cooking traditions and practices found in Malaysia, and reflects the multi-ethnic makeup of its population. The vast majority of Malaysia&#x27;s population can roughly be divided among three major ethnic groups: Malays, Chinese and Indians. The remainder consists of the indigenous peoples of Sabah and Sarawak in East Malaysia, the Orang Asli of Peninsular Malaysia, the Peranakan and Eurasian creole communities, as well as a significant number of foreign workers and expatriates.

As a result of historical migrations, colonisation by foreign powers, and its geographical position within its wider home region, Malaysia&#x27;s culinary style in the present day is primarily a melange of traditions from its Malay, Chinese, Indian, Indonesian, Thai, Filipino and indigenous Bornean and Orang Asli, with light to heavy influences from Arab, Thai, Portuguese, Dutch and British cuisines, to name a few. This resulted in a symphony of flavours, making Malaysian cuisine highly complex and diverse. The condiments, herbs and spices used in cooking vary.

Because Peninsular Malaysia shares a common history with Singapore, it is common to find versions of the same dish across both sides of the border regardless of the place of origin, such as laksa and chicken rice. The same thing can be said with Malaysian Borneo and Brunei, such as ambuyat. Also because of their proximity, historic migration and close ethnic and cultural kinship, Malaysia shares culinary ties with Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines, as these nations share dishes such as satay and rendang.

Because the vast majority of Chinese Malaysians are descendants of immigrants from southern China, Malaysian Chinese cuisine is predominantly based on an eclectic repertoire of dishes with roots from Fujian, Teochew, Cantonese, Hakka and Hainanese cuisines. However, although the vast majority of Indian Malaysians are descendants of immigrants from southern India, Malaysian Indian cuisine has a mixture of north-south Indian and Sri Lankan diversity that can be differentiated by drier or wetter curry dish preparation.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
Malaysian cuisine has developed over the region&#x27;s history. Although the modern state of Malaysia did not exist until 1963, the cuisine can claim traceable roots as far back as the 1400s, during the time of the Malacca Sultanate. Malaysian cuisine is a mixture of various food cultures from around the Malay archipelago, such as India, China, the Middle East, and several European countries. This diverse culinary culture stems from Malaysia&#x27;s diverse culture and colonial past. The cuisine was developed as a melange between local and foreign. In the 15th century, the region now known as Malaysia became an important passageway for maritime trade. Passing through Malaysia were Arab traders who brought spices from the Middle East, as well as Portuguese, Dutch, and English colonists and traders who introduced food staples such as peanuts, pineapples, avocado, tomatoes, squash and pumpkin. During the 19th century in the period of British colonial rule, many Indian and Chinese laborers were brought to Malaysia, contributing to the diversity of tastes in Malaysian cuisine.

===Cultural and regional influences===

Being a multicultural country, Malaysians have over the years adopted each other&#x27;s dishes to suit the taste buds of their own culture. For instance, Malaysians of Chinese descent have adapted the Indian curry, and made it more dilute and less spicy to suit their taste. Chinese noodles have been crossed with Indian and Malay tastes and thus Malay fried noodles and Indian fried noodles were born. Malaysians have also adapted famous dishes from neighbouring countries, or those with strong cultural and religious ties, and in the absence of an established community from said countries have made it completely their own, a notable example being tom yam, one of Thailand&#x27;s most well-known dishes

After migrating south of the border, Thai tom yam adopts the visual characteristics of a Malaysian Assam gravy, with a flavor profile that is sweet, sour, and spicy. It is thickened with pounded chili paste, which also gives it a vivid orange-red color. Tamarind is often used instead of lime juice as the souring agent, and dried chilies, rather than fresh ones, are used to provide a fiery kick. Malay-style tom yam soup tends to be heavily seafood-based, whereas in Chinese-style eateries, the broth&#x27;s spiciness is toned down and it is usually served as a base for noodle soup.

Across the sea from Peninsular Malaysia, on Borneo island, lie the states of Sabah and Sarawak. Traditional lifestyles and limited roads still predominate outside of the major cities, especially in Sarawak, where rivers are the only major highways for much of the inland population. The jungles of Borneo are teeming with wild plants, fungi, and fruits, and its sweeping coastlines and many large rivers provide an abundance of seafood and freshwater fish fit for the dinner table. A rich variety of traditional food has been developed by Borneo&#x27;s many tribes and indigenous groups over the centuries; much of it is healthy food, consisting of foraged (now increasingly cultivated due to modernisation) and fermented foods. Because much of the region was once under the Brunei Sultanate&#x27;s thalassocracy, the Bruneian Malay people have left a lasting culinary influence, particularly on the cookery of the coastal Muslim communities of East Malaysia. According to the source paper written in 2006, the Malaysian food industrial sector accounted for about 14% of the total manufacturing energy consumption.

Historically speaking, fresh produce is often scarce for hunter-gatherer nomadic tribes around the world, thus it is usually preserved out of necessity for important events and festivals. The tribal peoples of Sabah and Sarawak are no different; most of them have developed techniques for curing, fermenting or preserving their supplies of fresh meat, fruit and vegetables. For example, during festive occasions the Murut people of Sabah would serve &quot;tamba&quot; (&quot;jeruk&quot; in the Malay language) made from fresh raw wild boar or river fish, which is stuffed in bamboo tubes along with rice and salt and left to ferment for a few weeks, a technique which is also practised by the Lun Bawang people across the border in Sarawak. Fermented products are also frequently used as a cooking ingredient besides eaten on their own. Dayak households in Sarawak may saute their version of fermented meat with garlic and tapioca leaves (either fresh or pickled), and fermented &quot;tempoyak&quot; is a popular cooking seasoning.

The production and consumption of traditional liquor play an important cultural role for the non-Muslim peoples of East Malaysia. Alcoholic drinks made from rice is the most common form, as well as the widely available. In Sabah, the Penampang Kadazan &quot;lihing&quot; is perhaps the most well known. Yet due to the historical lack of a standardised Kadazandusun language used and understood statewide, ethnic groups from other districts in Sabah have very different names for similar fermented rice-based drinks: hiing (certain Dusun languages), kinomol, segantang, kinarung, kinopi, linahas, and even tapai To add to the confusion, tapai proper as understood by most Peninsular Malaysians is a fermented sweet and sour rice paste served as a snack or dessert, although further fermentation of the tapai to produce alcoholic drinks is possible. The preferred party drink of the Murut, made from the tuber of the cassava or tapioca plant, is also called tapai. The Iban of Sarawak call their rice wine tuak, which must not be confused with Sabahan talak, which is a hard liquor made from rice. To the native peoples of Sarawak, tuak may also refer to any alcoholic drink made from fermenting any carbohydrate-rich substance besides rice.

==Staples==
===Rice===

Rice () is the most important staple food in Malaysia. According to Indonesian-born food and cookery writer Sri Owen, there is some evidence for rice cultivation found in the state of Sarawak in Malaysian Borneo dated 2300 BC, and about 900 years of history for the state of Kelantan in West Malaysia. Today Malaysia produces about seventy percent of the amount of rice it needs to support itself and the rest is imported. This is a matter of policy as the government believes that national resources can be used more profitably instead of attempting to achieve self-sufficiency with rice production; the prevalent attitude is that revenue generated from its industries enables the country to import up to half the rice it needs. Nevertheless, the government is fully committed and involved in planning, allocating resources and managing subsidies for the rice farming industry. The state of Kedah is considered the &quot;rice bowl&quot; () of the country, accounting for about half of Malaysia&#x27;s total production of rice.

Plain steamed white rice, to be served with side dishes of meat or vegetables, is typically prepared with an electric rice cooker at home. Some households and food establishments prefer to cook rice on a stove top with the absorption method or the rapid-boil method. Compressed rice, called &quot;nasi himpit&quot;, is another method of preparing and cooking rice: the rice is wrapped with fronds or leaves and compressed into the form of a cylinder, which is then cooked by boiling. The rice would compress and merge during the cooking process. Compressed rice is usually eaten cold with some sort of gravy, although it may be served warm in a broth or soup. A notable variant of compressed rice prepared by the Bugis community is &quot;burasak&quot;: rice is precooked with coconut milk before it is wrapped in banana leaves and steamed until fully cooked.

Besides the ubiquitous white rice, there are different types of locally grown and imported rice available in the market, and each type has a specific cooking method to bring out optimal results. Glutinous rice () is one example: because of its low amylose and high amylopectin content which results in a sticky texture after cooking, glutinous rice is prepared with different measurements and techniques and is not suitably interchangeable with regular rice. It is typically used for making snacks and desserts, but glutinous rice is also prepared as a savoury staple by indigenous peoples like the Orang Asli as well as the Dayak people of Borneo. &quot;Lemang&quot; is glutinous rice roasted in a hollowed bamboo tube, and is prepared for festive occasions like Ari Gawai, Hari Raya Aidilfitri, and Hari Raya Aidiladha.

A popular dish based on rice in Malaysia is , rice steamed with coconut milk and pandan leaves to give it a rich fragrance. Of Malay origin, is very popular and frequently referred to as the national dish. It is customarily served with or fried anchovies, peanuts, sliced cucumber, hard-boiled eggs and &quot;sambal&quot;. Although it is often considered a breakfast dish, it is served in a variety of ways and commonly eaten at any time of day due to its versatility. For a more substantial meal, may be served with fried chicken, curries, or a spicy meat stew called &quot;rendang&quot;.

Congee is a type of rice porridge or gruel popular among Malaysia&#x27;s ethnic communities. It is eaten primarily as a breakfast food or late supper. It is also considered particularly suitable for the sick as a mild, easily digestible food. Congee is called in Malay; 粥 written in Chinese, pronounced as &quot;zhou&quot; in Mandarin Chinese and &quot;juk&quot; in Cantonese; and &quot;kanji&quot; (கஞ்சி) in Tamil. It may be served plain with little embellishment, or cooked with ingredients like fish slices, seafood, chicken, beef, pork, vegetables, and spices. The importance and popularity of congee in the Malaysian diet is such that bubur ayam or chicken congee is a permanent fixture on the menu of Malaysian McDonald&#x27;s restaurants.

===Noodles===

Noodles are another popular staple, particularly in Malaysian Chinese cuisine, but used by other groups as well. Noodles such as bi hoon (米粉, Hokkien: bí-hún, Malay: ; rice vermicelli), kuay teow (粿條, Hokkien: kóe-tiâu) or ho fun (河粉, Cantonese: ho4 fan2; flat rice noodles), mee (麵 or 面, Hokkien: mī, Malay: ; yellow noodles), mee suah (麵線 or 面线, Hokkien: mī-sòaⁿ; wheat vermicelli), yee meen (伊麵 or 伊面, Cantonese: ji1 min6; golden wheat noodles), dongfen (冬粉, Hokkien: tang-hún, Cantonese: dung1 fan2; cellophane noodles), Lao Shu Fen (老鼠粉, Cantonese: lou5 syu2 fan2; silver needle noodles), and others provide an alternative source of carbohydrate to a serving of rice that accompanies every meal. Stir-fried noodle dishes () are ubiquitous throughout Malaysia&#x27;s cities, towns and villages, with numerous localised variants prepared by various ethnic communities according to their culinary traditions and preferences.

===Bread===

Malaysia does not produce wheat, and all supplies are imported from wheat-producing countries. Nevertheless, Western-style white bread and Indian breads made with wheat flour like roti canai are fairly common foods or is sandwiched along with a layer of between slices of untoasted white bread.

Traditional wheat-based pleated steamed bao or pao (Chinese : 包子) is a Chinese staple which has become tightly woven into Malaysia&#x27;s gastronomic fabric. Pao are found in restaurants doing brunch dim sum trade, as well as specialist Chinese kopitiam (coffee shops). Sweet fillings may include tausa, lotus seed paste, , pandan, ground peanuts, and custard; savoury fillings may consist of stewed char siu (Chinese : 叉燒), chicken or pork. Malay versions () may be found in night markets () and they are always halal, with fillings of curried potato, chicken or beef. Some variants have a quail egg in the middle in addition to the curry.

Oven-baked buns are also available in specialist bakeries, , and restaurants. One local speciality in particular - a bun with a buttery core and topped with a crispy and fragrant coffee pastry crust - has achieved iconic status in Malaysia, and franchises like Rotiboy and Pappa Roti which specialise in these coffee buns have successfully expanded abroad to multiple nations and spawned hundreds of outlets. However, the popular buns that remain a favourite among Malaysians are the buns that are filled with a sweet shredded coconut filling, (coconut jam), (screwpine with coconut jam), sweet corn, chocolate, red bean paste and butter buns.

===Other staples===
Like Peninsular Malaysia, rice is the undisputed staple food for the majority of the people of Sabah and Sarawak. Rice is central to Kadazandusun culture, and its paramount importance is reflected in the annual Kaamatan festival, as well as traditional beliefs and customs since antiquity which revolve around the veneration of rice spirits. But for other ethnic communities throughout Sabah and Sarawak, cassava or tapioca tubers as well as sago starch are also popular staples. The tapioca tuber is just as important as rice to the Bajau people of Sabah, while the Dayak peoples of Sarawak make extensive use of both the tuber and leaves of the tapioca plant in their cooking. Sago starch is derived from the pith extracted from the sago palm, and is the staple food for the Melanau and the Penan peoples of Sarawak.

Sago starch is prepared as a gooey and sticky paste by the Bisaya and Kedayan communities called ambuyat, and is called &quot;&quot; by the Melanau. It is eaten by rolling the paste around the prongs of a bamboo fork, and dipping it into soup, &quot;sambal&quot;, or other varieties of gravies and dipping sauces. Aside from being the source for sago pith, the sago palm is a source of another delicacy for the indigenous peoples of Borneo: the sago grub. Called &quot;butod&quot; in Sabah and &quot;ulat mulong&quot; in Sarawak, sago grubs are typically eaten raw but also served deep fried, roasted or sauteed.

== Protein==
===Meat===

Malaysian poultry is handled according to halal standards to conform with the country&#x27;s dominant and official religion, Islam. Imported poultry is available at major hypermarkets, supermarkets and speciality stores especially in affluent areas where a significant expatriate community can be found.

Fish, both freshwater and saltwater, features prominently in the Malaysian diet. Most local fish is purchased soon after it is caught, while frozen fish is generally imported. Such fish, namely salmon and cod, are well received on the Malaysian table but are not found in Malaysian waters.
Many types of seafood are consumed in Malaysia, including shrimp or prawn, crab, squid, cuttlefish, clams, cockles, snails, sea cucumber and octopus. In general, members of all ethnic communities enjoy seafood, which is considered halal by Malaysian Muslims (according to Shafi’i fiqh), though some species of crabs are not considered halal as they can live on both land and sea. Sea cucumbers are considered halal.

Beef is common in the Malaysian diet, though it is notable that the consumption of beef is proscribed by some followers of Hinduism and certain Chinese folk religious sects. Beef can be commonly found cooked in curries, stews, roasted, or eaten with noodles. Malays generally eat beef that is halal. Australian beef prepared under the Government Supervised Muslim Slaughter System (AGSMS) is imported into Malaysia and is halal.

Malaysian Malays, who form about half of Malaysia&#x27;s population, are Muslim and therefore do not consume pork since Islam forbids it. This does not prohibit others from producing and consuming pork products, and thus pork can be found in wet markets, supermarkets and hypermarkets, usually displayed with a non-halal disclaimer. Pork is consumed by the Chinese communities, Indians, the Iban, the Kadazan, Murut, Lun Bawang/Lundayeh, the Orang Asli, and non-Muslim expatriates.

In Malaysia, the term &quot;mutton&quot; refers to goat meat; lamb, or the meat of a young sheep, is always imported from countries like Australia and New Zealand. In the past mutton was primarily associated with Malaysian Indian cuisine, and was not as widely eaten due to health concerns as well as its perceived gamey flavour. Today, dishes like whole spit roast of mutton, mutton biryani and mutton soup are now a common sight at banquets and events. Today, the demand for mutton during the fasting month and Hari Raya period has now far exceeded that for Deepavali and Christmas combined.

==Fruit and vegetables==
===Vegetables===
Locally-grown produce is available year-round as Malaysia is a tropical country and does not have four seasons. During rainy seasons, vegetable yields may decrease (which may result in an increase in market price), but rarely if ever stop altogether. Imported produce has made inroads into the market in recent years, either to supplement local demand for essential ingredients like garlic and potatoes, or to supply produce which does not grow well in Malaysia&#x27;s climate and soil conditions. A few regions in Malaysia, like Cameron Highlands and the foothills adjacent to Mount Kinabalu provide the appropriate mean temperatures and soil conditions for the cultivation of temperate produce like tea.

Malaysian-grown greens, tubers and vegetables commonly found nationwide include but are not limited to amaranth (), bean sprouts (), brinjals (), bitter gourd (), bok choi (), cabbage (), choy sum&quot;,&quot; cucumber ()&quot;, Chinese celery (&quot;)&quot;, coriander&quot; (), ginger (), green beans, water spinach (&quot;kangkung)&quot;, ladies&#x27; fingers (), leeks, lettuce, lotus root, maize (), napa cabbage (), sweet potatoes (), spring onions (), katuk ( or ), pumpkin (), shiitake mushrooms (), stink beans (), tapioca (), taro or yam (), tomatoes, yambean or turnip, turmeric (), and yardlong beans (), carrot (), and scallions ().

In some areas in Malaysia local produce is grown on a small scale, and many rural communities like the Peninsular Orang Asli and certain tribal peoples of Sarawak forage wild edible ferns or vegetables to supplement their diet. Vegetable fern, better known as , is perhaps the most widely available fern and is found in eateries and restaurants throughout the nation. &quot;Stenochlaena palustris&quot; is another type of wild fern popularly used for food. Endemic to East Malaysia, it is called in Sarawak and is prized for its fiddleheads by locals and visitors. It is known by the native peoples of Sabah as , or , where both the leaves and the fiddleheads of the plant are eaten. The young shoots of plants like bamboo and coconut are popularly harvested as food by communities outside urban areas.

A popular way to cook leafy vegetables like and sweet potato leaves is stir frying with a pungent sauce made from (shrimp paste) and hot chilli peppers. Other vegetables popularly cooked this way include bean pods and fiddlehead ferns like and . Vegetables like carrots, cucumbers, onions and yardlong beans are used to make a localised variety of pickle called &quot;acar&quot;. Vegetables and herbs are also popularly served undressed and often raw in some rural indigenous communities as ulam. An spread may include items such as banana blossoms, cucumber, winged beans, &quot;pegaga&quot; leaves, , and yardlong beans, typically eaten with a pungent dipping sauce like .

===Vegetarianism in Malaysia===
As of 2012, about one million people within Malaysia&#x27;s total population were practising vegetarians, and vegetarian food is much easier to obtain when dining out today. However, because of the heavy emphasis on meat and seafood by traditional Malay cuisine as well as the common inclusion of shrimp paste and other seafood products in many local dishes, diners may find it difficult to negotiate their way around menus in search of vegetarian or vegan food in Malay cuisine restaurants.

Restaurants that display signs with the words &quot;sayur sayuran&quot;, &quot;vegetarian&quot; or the Chinese characters &quot;素&quot; or &quot;斎&quot; will offer a decent variety of food for diners who abstain from meat. There are many of them across the country, particularly in urban areas. These restaurants serve only vegetarian/vegan food and absolutely no meat or animal products is used in their cooking. Even restaurants that specialise in meat and seafood will make vegetarian dishes upon request. Some meat-serving restaurants have a vegetarian section in their menu.

Over 80% of Malaysian Chinese identify themselves as Buddhists, and some follow a vegetarian diet at least some of the time. Some vegetarian Chinese cuisine restaurants offer an exclusively vegetarian menu (Chinese: 素食, 斎) featuring Chinese dishes which resemble meat dishes in look and even taste like &quot;roast pork&quot;, fried &quot;fish&quot; with &quot;skin&quot; and &quot;bones&quot;, and &quot;chicken drumsticks&quot; complete with a &quot;bone&quot;. These restaurants are run by proprietors who abstain from consumption of animal products and strong-tasting vegetables and spices as way of life for religious reasons, and are essentially vegan. The meat analogues used are often locally produced as opposed to imported, and are made solely from ingredients like soy, gluten, mushrooms and tuber vegetables.

Organic vegetarianism has also slowly become a trendy modern vegetarian diet nowadays. Most of the organic vegetarian menu will include superfood ingredients, for example: organic quinoa, millet, chia seeds, flax seeds, avocado, egg, tofu, pine nuts, blueberry, almond milk, etc. A lot of organic fruit and vegetables are locally produced in recent years. There is even an organic version of vegetarian sambal balacan, Nasi lemak chili paste, etc.

Buddhist vegetarian restaurants are likely to be found in areas with a high concentration of Chinese and tend to be especially busy on certain festive days where many Buddhists adopt a strict vegetarian diet for at least a day. In Buddhism, some people who are full-time vegetarians are observing the Buddhist Five Precepts. They are vegetarian because they are observing the precept to abstain from killing or harming living beings intentionally. Another precept is to abstain from taking drugs or intoxicants for enjoyment, hence, alcohol is not used in most pure vegetarian shops. (This is different, however, when ordering vegetarian food off the menu of restaurants that serve meat dishes.)

Vegetarianism has a long and revered tradition in Indian culture. Some Malaysian Indians are born-and-bred vegetarians who often hail from a family line with generations of vegetarians. Some others practice vegetarianism on auspicious festivals such as Thai Ponggal, Hindu New Year, Deepavali, Full Moon Prayers, and on certain days of the week as a symbol of respect when they visit holy temples. Abstaining from meat before fulfilling a vow is a common practice to bring the body to a neutral and focused state, physically and mentally, during Thaipusam and other holy prayer events. Dishes, of South and North Indian types, are based on the ancient concept of Ayurveda and are known to include arusuvai or six types of tastes. Some Indian vegetarian dishes may incorporate dairy products and honey (lacto vegetarian). Some others are heavily based on lavish coconut milk and nuts. There are many Indian eateries and restaurants in Malaysia that offer a pure vegetarian menu. South Indian restaurants, in particular, offer no shortage of meatless options such as Thali meal, also known as banana leaf rice, which is often vegetarian by default, and a wide array of sweets, snacks and light meals such as kesari, tose, idli, uppuma, vade, aviyal, idiyappam and paniyaram.

===Fruit===

Malaysia&#x27;s tropical climate allows for fruit to be grown all year round. A huge variety of common and obscure fruits, either locally grown or imported are available throughout the country. While the vast majority of fruits grown in Malaysia naturally thrive in the tropics, a few areas in the country like Cameron Highlands or Kundasang in Sabah have a different climate zone which enables the cultivation of temperate fruits like strawberries. Fruit is commonly served after a meal as dessert, and fruit juices are highly sought after as drinks of choice in a climate that is hot and humid all year round. Pickled fruits or are popular and widely available, whether sold from street stalls or specialist shops. Many localities are named after native fruits, most notably Alor Setar (&quot;buah setar&quot;) and Malacca (&quot;buah melaka&quot;).
Fruits are used to make a popular salad dish called rojak (Chinese: 水果囉喏). It consists of pieces of fruit and vegetable bound with a viscous dark sauce made from shrimp paste, sugar, chilli, and lime juice. The Penang version is particularly popular and well regarded. The dish is usually topped with a generous sprinkling of toasted ground peanuts.

Notable fruits which are cultivated in Malaysia include:

* The banana, or in Malay. Many different cultivars are available on the market, and plantain is used for pisang goreng. Other parts of the banana plant may be used for culinary purposes.
* The calamansi lime, or in Malay. Widely used as a souring agent in Malaysian cooking, the juice of the calamansi lime is also savoured on its own with ice and secondary flavourings like green apple juice, pandan leaves and dried preserved plums.
* The cempedak, a fruit with a large and rough pod-like body. The edible flesh coating each pod is sweet, and has a soft custard-like texture.
* The durian, a fruit with a spiky outer shell and a characteristic odour is a local tropical fruit that is notable because it provokes strong emotions either of loving it or hating it. It is also known as the &quot;King of the Fruits&quot;. Several species of durian exist throughout Malaysia - common cultivars come with pale cream or yellow coloured arils, whereas some varieties found in Borneo are naturally bright red, orange or even purple in colour.
* The guava, called or in Malay. It is a crunchy fruit often eaten plain or garnished with a tart seasoning mix.
* The honeydew, or in Malay. This aromatic green melon is often cut up and served with cooked sago pearls in chilled coconut milk as a dessert.
* The jackfruit, or in Malay. It is an enormous fruit similar in appearance to cempedak, but quite different in taste and texture. The fleshy covering of each pod is firm and sweet. Unripe jackfruit is occasionally used for cooking savoury meals.
* The ‘’’kedondong’’’, a small green fruit with an extremely sour taste, usually pickled.
* The &quot;&#x27;langsat’&quot;, a fruit which are borne in clusters similar to grapes and resemble tiny potatoes, with a taste likened to a sweet and tart combination of grape and grapefruit. A second, larger variety known as generally bear fruit which are large, generally round, and have somewhat thick skin that does not release sap when cooked. The seeds are small with thick flesh, a sweet scent, and a sweet or sour alin.
* The longan, which means &quot;dragon eye&quot; in Chinese. A related species called (literally &quot;cat&#x27;s eye&quot; in Malay) has a virtually identical taste to commercially cultivated longan. However, the fruit (&quot;Euphoria malaiense&quot;) is smaller, the fleshy aril is thinner, and the yellow rind is bumpy and leathery like a lychee fruit.
* The mango, or in Malay. The state of Perlis is famous for its Harumanis variety (from the mangifera indica cultivar), which is registered as a product of geographical indication (GI) with the Malaysian Intellectual Property Organisation (MyIPO). Another notable species of mango found only in Borneo and used extensively in local cookery is the mangifera pajang, known in Sabah as and Sarawak as .
* The mangosteen, or in Malay. In contrast to the durian, mangosteen is often called the &quot;queen of the fruits&quot;.
* The papaya, or in Malay. Another common fruit available year-round in Malaysia, and widely eaten to conclude a meal.
* The pineapple, or in Malay. It is widely eaten as a fruit and used extensively in local cooking, such as a curried pineapple dish called .
* The pitaya, better known locally as dragon fruit. Dragon fruit is available in red and white fleshed varieties.
* The pomelo, or in Malay. Pomelos grown in the Sungai Gedung area in the state of Perak has been granted GI status. It is also called , after the town of Tambun which is also famed for its pomelo produce. As pomelos are associated with traditional Chinese festivities, most farms harvest twice a year in conjunction with Chinese New Year and Mid Autumn Festival.
* The rambutan, as the name suggests, have fleshy pliable spines or &#x27;hairs&#x27; on its outer shell which is usually red or yellow in colour. Once the hairy exterior is peeled away, the tender, fleshy, sweet and sour tasting fruit is revealed.
* The rose apple, called or in Malay, which is not to be confused with or guava. The term refers to various Syzygium species which are grown for their fruit. The fruit may be eaten on its own, or tossed through a salad.
* The sapodilla, better known locally as . Its flesh has a grainy texture akin to ripened pear with a sweet malty flavour.
* The soursop, known as in Malay and to the Dusun people of Borneo. The fruit is commonly made into juice and smoothies, and the leaves of the soursop plant are boiled and taken as a herbal infusion.
* The starfruit, or in Malay. Malaysia is a global leader in starfruit production by volume and ships the fruit widely to Asia and Europe.
* The tarap, also called , is a fruit that is native to Borneo and is related to cempedak and jackfruit. While the fruits are about the same size and shape as a durian and also emit a noxious odour, the spines of the tarap are soft and rubbery compared to the durian&#x27;s hard, thorny spines. The fruit itself is smooth, soft and creamy, and the flavour is reminiscent of sweet custard apple with a hint of tartness.
* The watermelon, or in Malay. This popular fruit comes in red and yellow varieties.
* The sugar apple, or in Malay. This fruit comes in red or green varieties.

==Ingredients==
Chilli peppers are indispensable in Malaysian kitchens, and both fresh and dried forms are used. Chillies come in several sizes, shapes and colours. As a general rule, two type of chilli cultivars are the most commonly available: the bird&#x27;s eye chilli (), which although small in size are extremely pungent and very hot; and longer varieties, which tend to be much milder. Green chillies are more peppery in taste, while red chillies, green chillies which have been left to ripen, have a slightly sweeter heat. If a milder flavour is preferred, the seeds and membranes are removed from the chilli pods before they are cut, or the chillies are left whole and removed prior to serving. Some common uses include grinding the chillies into a paste or sambal; chopping fresh chillies as a condiment or garnish; and pickling whole or cut chillies.

 is essential to Malaysian cooking. It is a type of shrimp paste which is pressed into a block and sun-dried. In its raw form it has a pungent smell. Once cooked, the aroma and flavour mellow and contribute a depth of flavour to the dish. To prepare for use, one typically wraps a small amount in foil, which is then roasted over a flame or placed into a preheated oven. is most commonly pounded or blended with local chilli peppers, shallots and lime juice to make the most popular and ubiquitous relish in Malaysia, . is also crumbled into a ground spice paste called , which usually includes garlic, ginger, onions or shallots, and fresh or dried chilli peppers. A paste is similar in form and function to an Indian wet &quot;masala&quot; paste or Thai curry paste, and is often browned and caramelised () to mellow the raw flavours of its component ingredients and produce a harmonised finish.

The coconut () is another quintessential feature of Malaysian cuisine, and virtually all parts of the plant are used for culinary purposes. The white fleshy part of the coconut endosperm may be grated, shredded and used as is; dried to make desiccated coconut; or toasted until dark brown and ground to make kerisik. Grated coconut flesh is also squeezed to make coconut milk, which is used extensively in savoury dishes and desserts throughout the country. Coconut oil is used for cooking and cosmetic purposes, and may be either obtained by processing copra (dried coconut flesh) or extracted from fresh coconuts as virgin coconut oil. Coconut water, the clear liquid found inside the cavity of each coconut, is a popular cooler in Malaysia&#x27;s hot and humid climate. is unrefined palm sugar produced from the sap of the coconut flower. It is the most traditional sweetener in Malaysian cooking and imbues a rich caramel-like flavour with a hint of coconut. Coconut fronds are traditionally used to wrap food, hollowed out coconut husks and shells may be used as a source of charcoal fuel for barbecued meats and traditional pastry making, and even the apical bud or growing tip of the coconut palm is a popular delicacy served in rural communities and specialty restaurants.

Soy sauce of different varieties is another important ingredient. Light soy sauce contributes its pleasantly salty flavour to a variety of stir-fries, marinades and steamed dishes. In some hawker establishments, freshly sliced or pickled chillies arrive immersed in light soy sauce to be used for dipping. Dark soy sauce is thicker, more intense in flavour and less salty. It is often used when a heartier flavour is desired, particularly with (a style of braising with a blend of soy sauce varieties) dishes, and also to darken the color of a dish. Kicap manis, sweetened soy sauce sometimes flavoured with star anise or garlic, is also a popular seasoning for cooking. The sweet and savoury taste of also functions as a substitute to approximate the combination of dark soy sauce and thick caramel sauce, which is primarily used to colour and season stewed dishes.

Common herbs include lemongrass (), a type of grass with a lemony aroma and flavour. Young, fresh stems are more desirable as older stems tend to acquire a woody texture. The tender white part closest to the base of the stem is thinly sliced and eaten raw in salads, or pounded with other aromatics to make a . It is also used whole in boiled and simmered dishes. The pandan (screwpine) leaf is the Asian equivalent of vanilla in Western cuisine. Its subtle aroma is released when the leaves are bruised by tying one or two long leaves into a knot, and used for cooking curries, rice and desserts. The leaves can also be used to wrap items like rice, chicken or fish for cooking. Pandan leaf is also available in liquid essence or powdered form to flavour and colour cakes. Turmeric () is a rhizome popular for its flavour as well as colouring properties. The leaves and flowers of the turmeric plant are also used in cooking or eaten raw.

Tofu products, specifically fried tofu, are widely used as cooking ingredients and as side accompaniments. While fried tofu can be bland in flavour on its own, its main contribution is texture and especially with tofu puffs, the ability to soak up the flavour of whatever they are cooked in. Fried tofu products are found as a versatile component ingredient for dishes like stir fried noodles, &quot;rojak&quot; (fruit and vegetable salad), noodle soups, and stews. A popular way of serving fried tofu on its own is a salad with bean sprouts, shredded cucumber and spring onions, covered in a thick sweet and spicy dressing and dusted with roasted ground peanuts. Fried tofu may also be stuffed with a mixture of ground meat or shredded vegetables.

Dried seafood products contribute a savoury depth of flavour to some Malaysian dishes. Small dried anchovies, known as , are very popular. It acquires a crispy texture when deep-fried, and is served as an accompaniment or prepared as a relish in this capacity. is also boiled to make fish stock; in fact, instant stock granules are a popular seasoning in modern kitchens. Dried shrimp and salted dried fish are also used in various ways.

Other essential seasoning and garnishes include tamarind (), specifically the paste-like pulp extracted from the fruit pod which contributes a tart flavour to many dishes. Candlenuts () are similar in appearance to macadamia nuts, being round, cream-coloured and having a high oil content. Candlenuts are normally ground to thicken sauces. is a type of dried Chinese sausage made from pork and spices. Mainly used by the Malaysian Chinese community, these sweet sausages are usually sliced very thinly and added for additional flavour and texture. Recent studies have shown that there are 62 commonly consumed Malaysian foods that include biogenic amines.

==Structure of meals==

There is no standard breakfast () menu due to Malaysia&#x27;s multi-ethnic social fabric as well as the advent of modern influences. Western-style breakfast like breakfast cereal, cooked eggs and toast have become commonplace in homes and when dining out, but heartier traditional fare based predominantly on noodles and rice dishes are still very popular. One may choose to start the day with the ubiquitous nasi lemak or kuih; venture for Chinese-style congee, dim sum and noodle soups; or settle for Indian-influenced fare such as roti canai, idli ( &quot;iṭli&quot; ), thosai ( &quot;tōcai&quot; ), and upma. In the state of Kelantan, the term &quot;nasi berlauk&quot; refers to a breakfast meal which consists of a small serve of rice and complementary dishes or &quot;lauk&quot;.

For lunch and dinner, food is not customarily served in courses but rather concurrently. A meal may consist of a single dish for solitary diners, or rice with many complementary dishes shared by all. At restaurants where food is cooked to order, there is often no distinction between appetizers/starters and main courses, and food will arrive at the table whenever it is ready. At some traditionally-run eateries where pre-cooked food is served, diners are meant to help themselves by starting with a plate of plain rice and choose from a buffet spread of assorted dishes. Like the Indonesian Nasi Padang, this is not an all-you-can-eat for a fixed price dining experience. The cost of the meal would depend on what the diner selects and how many different items were placed on the plate for consumption. In Malay-run &quot;warung&quot; (a small family-owned casual eatery or café) or restaurants (&quot;kedai makan&quot;), this style of dining is known as &quot;nasi campur&quot; which means &quot;mixed rice&quot;. A similar concept exist at some eateries serving home-style Malaysian Chinese food, where it may be known as economy rice (Chinese: 杂饭).

A practice known as &quot;open house&quot; () is popular during festive seasons, and even as an elaborate occasion to celebrate birthdays and weddings. Open house events are traditionally held at the home of the host: well-wishers are received and that everyone, regardless of background, is invited to attend. Home-cooked or catered food is provided by the host(s) at their own expense, and while it is acceptable for guests to bring along gifts for the host, they are expected to help themselves to the food as much as they like. Open house events may also be held at restaurants and larger public venues, especially when hosted by government agencies or corporations.

==Food establishments==

A kopitiam or kopi tiam is a traditional coffee shop patronised for meals and beverages, predominantly operated by Chinese proprietors and especially members of the Hainanese community. The word &quot;kopi&quot; is a Malay/Hokkien term for coffee and &quot;tiam&quot; is the Hokkien and Hakka term for shop (Chinese : 店). A common sight in Malaysia and neighbouring Singapore, menus often feature offerings like nasi lemak, boiled eggs, roti bakar, noodle dishes, bread and kuih. The owners of some kopitiam establishments may lease premise space to independent stallholders, who sometimes offer more specialised dishes beyond standard Chinese kopitiam fare. Typical beverages include Milo, a malted chocolate drink considered iconic to Malaysians of all ages, as well as coffee (&quot;kopi&quot;) and tea (&quot;teh&quot;). Diners would use slang terms specific to kopitiam culture to order and customise drinks to their taste.

The omnipresent Mamak stall is a Malaysian institution. Available throughout the country and
particularly popular in urban areas, Mamak stalls and restaurants offer a wide range of food and some are open 24 hours a day. The proprietors of these establishments are members of Malaysia&#x27;s Tamil Muslim community, who have developed a distinct culinary style and wield an enormous influence on Malaysian food culture disproportionate to their numbers. A type of meal served buffet-style at some Mamak eateries is called nasi kandar, which is analogous to the Malay &quot;nasi campur&quot; where you pay for what you have actually eaten. The diner is to choose from a variety of curried dishes made with chicken, beef, mutton, or seafood. A mixture of curry sauces is then poured on the provided rice: this is called &quot;banjir&quot; (literally means &quot;flooding&quot;).

==Cuisines of Malaysia==
===Malay cuisine===

For a traditional Malay meal, rice is considered the centerpiece of a meal, with everything else considered as an accompaniment, relish or side for the rice. Malay cuisine bears many similarities to Indonesian cuisine, in particular some of the regional traditions from Sumatra. It has also been influenced by Chinese, Indian, Thai and many other cultures throughout history, producing a distinct cuisine of their own. Some regional Malay dishes, such as &quot;arisa&quot; and &quot;kacang pool&quot;, are examples of influence from Arab cuisine due to longstanding historical and religious ties.

====Javanese-influenced cuisine====
There are certain Malaysian dishes with overt Javanese influences or are direct adaptations from Javanese cuisine, brought to Malaysia by Javanese immigrants who have been assimilated or integrated into the wider Malay community to various degrees. Javanese cuisine is highly distinct from mainstream Malay cooking, being noted for its simplicity and sweeter flavours, as opposed to mainstream Malay cuisine which is predominantly based on the complex and spicy regional cuisines of Sumatra. A popular way of serving Javanese-influenced food in the southern part of Peninsular Malaysia is termed nasi ambang, which consists of shared platters of white rice served with accompaniments like chicken cooked in soy sauce or curried gravy, stir fried noodles, &quot;sambal goreng&quot;, fried shredded coconut pieces, egg, vegetables and so on.

===Malaysian Chinese cuisine===
Malaysian Chinese cuisine is derived from the culinary traditions of Chinese Malaysian immigrants and their descendants, who have adapted or modified their culinary traditions under the influence of Malaysian culture as well as immigration patterns of Chinese to Malaysia. Because the vast majority of Chinese Malaysians are descendants of immigrants from southern China, Malaysian Chinese cuisine is predominantly based on an eclectic repertoire of dishes with roots from Cantonese cuisine, Hakka cuisine, Fujian cuisine and Teochew cuisine.

As these early immigrants settled in different regions throughout what was then British Malaya and Borneo, they carried with them traditions of foods and recipes that were particularly identified with their origins in China, which gradually became infused with the characteristics of their new home locale in Malaysia while remaining distinctively Chinese. For example, Hainanese chicken rice is usually flavoured with tropical pandan leaves and served with chilli sauce for dipping, and tastes unlike the typical chicken dishes found in Hainan Island itself. Some of these foods and recipes became closely associated with a specific city, town or village, eventually developing iconic status and culminating in a proliferation of nationwide popularity in the present day.

Chinese food is especially prominent in areas with concentrated Chinese communities, at roadside stalls, hawker centres and kopitiam, as well as smart cafes and upmarket restaurants throughout the nation. Many Chinese dishes have pork as a component ingredient, but chicken is available as a substitution for Muslim customers from the wider community, and some Chinese restaurants are even halal-certified.

A sample of representative Malaysian Chinese dishes found nationwide include:


* Bak Kut Teh (pork ribs soup). The root meaning for the dish, &quot;Bak Kut&quot; (Hokkien dialect) is the term for meaty ribs, at its simplest cooked with garlic, dark soy sauce and a specific combination of herbs and spices which have been boiled for many hours. Popularly regarded as a health tonic, this soup is historically eaten by hard working Chinese coolies working on the wharfs at Port Swettenham (now Port Klang) and clearing estates, accompaniment with strong tea (&quot;Teh&quot;) on the side. There are some differences in seasoning amongst other Chinese communities; the Teochew prefer a clear broth which is heavier on garlic and pepper, while the Cantonese may include additional varieties of medicinal herbs and spices. Variations include the so-called &quot;chik kut teh&quot; (made with chicken and a version that is gaining popularity with Muslim diners), seafood bak kut teh, and a &quot;dry&quot; (reduced gravy) version which originated from the town of Klang.
* Bakkwa, literally &quot;dried meat&quot;, bakkwa is better understood as barbecued meat jerky. While this delicacy is especially popular during the Chinese New Year celebration period, it is available everywhere and eaten year round as a popular snack.
* Bean sprouts chicken, Ipoh&#x27;s most well known dish, bean sprouts chicken consists of poached or steamed chicken accompanied with a plate of blanched locally grown bean sprouts in a simple dressing of soy sauce and sesame oil. The crunchy and stout texture of Ipoh-grown bean sprouts is attributed to the mineral-rich properties of local water supplies. The dish is usually served with hor fun noodles in a chicken broth, or plain rice.
* Cantonese fried noodles refers to a preparation of noodles which are shallow or deep fried to a crisp texture, then served as the base for a thick egg and cornstarch white sauce cooked with sliced lean pork, seafood, and green vegetables like choy sum. A variation called yuen yong involves mixing both crisp-fried rice vermicelli as well as hor fun to form a base for the sauce. A related dish called wa tan hor uses hor fun noodles, but the noodles are not deep fried, merely charred.
* Chai tow kway, a common dish in Malaysia made of rice flour. It also known as fried radish cake, although no radish is included within the rice cakes, save perhaps the occasional addition of preserved radish during the cooking process. Seasonings and additives vary from region, and may include bean sprouts and eggs.

* Char kway teow, Stir fried rice noodles with bean sprouts, prawns, eggs (duck or chicken), chives and thin slices of preserved Chinese sausages. Cockles and lardons were once standard offerings, but mostly relegated to optional additions these days due to changing taste preferences and growing health concerns. Penang-style char kway teow is the most highly regarded variant both in Malaysia as well as abroad.
* Chee cheong fun, is square rice sheets made from a viscous mixture of rice flour and water. This liquid is poured onto a specially made flat pan in which it is steamed to produce the square rice sheets. The steamed rice sheets is rolled or folded for ease in serving. It is usually served with tofu stuffed with fish paste. The dish is eaten with accompaniment of semi sweet fermented bean paste sauce, chilli paste or light vegetable curry gravy. Ipoh and Penang have different variants of the dish as well; certain stalls in Ipoh serve the dish with a red sweet sauce, thinly sliced pickled green chillies and fried shallots, whilst in Penang, a type of sweet, black shrimp sauce called &quot;hae ko&quot; is the main condiment.
* Cheong Cheng style steamed fish, Cheong cheng literally mean gravy or sauce steamed. The main ingredients for the gravy or sauce are fermented bean paste and chillies.
* Chicken rice is one of the most popular Chinese-inspired dishes in Malaysia. Hainanese chicken rice is the best known version: it is prepared with the same traditional method used for cooking Wenchang chicken, which involve steeping the entire chicken at sub-boiling temperatures within a master stock until cooked, to ensure the chicken meat becomes moist and tender. The chicken is then chopped up, and served with a bowl or plate of rice cooked in chicken fat and chicken stock, along with another bowl of clear chicken broth and a set of dips and condiments. Sometimes the chicken is dipped in ice to produce a jelly-like skin finishing upon the completion of the poaching process. In Malacca, the chicken rice is served shaped into balls.
* Curry Mee (A bowl of thin yellow noodles mixed with bihun in a spicy curry soup enriched with coconut milk, and topped with tofu puffs, prawns, cuttlefish, chicken, long beans, cockles and mint leaves, with sambal served on the side. It is often referred to as curry laksa.
**White Curry Mee, however the soup base is in white colour instead of yellow or red. The white color comes from the Coconut gravy)
* Fish ball are fish paste shaped into a spherical shape. Usually fish ball is served as a condiment together with rice vermicelli or yellow noodles in a &quot;clear soup&quot; base. Bean sprouts and spring onions are also commonly added, complemented by a small plate of chilli padi soaked in soy sauce. Fishcake is also a common addition
* Fish head bihun, A noodle soup in which the main ingredients are rice vermicelli and a deep fried fish head cut into chunks. The soup itself is somewhat creamy, which is usually achieved using a mixture of rich fish stock and milk. Tomatoes and pickled vegetables are sometimes added to cut the richness and provide a tangy foil for the noodle soup.
* Hakka mee, Hakka Mee is a simple dish of noodles topped with a ground meat gravy. A popular hawker dish with Hakka cultural roots, it is based on an older recipe called Dabumian; the name indicates its place of origin as Dabu County, the center of Hakka culture in mainland China.
* Heong Peng, these fragrant pastries, which resemble slightly flattened balls, are a famed speciality of Ipoh which are now widely available in Malaysia and are even exported overseas. It contains a sweet sticky filling made from malt and shallots, covered by a flaky baked crust and garnished with sesame seeds on the surface.

* Hokkien Mee, actually has two variants, with each being ubiquitous to a particular region of Peninsular Malaysia.
**Penang Hokkien mee, colloquially referred to in Penang as &quot;Hokkien mee&quot;, is also known as &quot;hae mee&quot; elsewhere in Malaysia. One of Penang&#x27;s most famous specialties, it is a noodle soup with yellow and rice noodles immersed in an aromatic stock made from prawns and pork (chicken for halal versions), and garnished with a boiled egg, poached prawns, chopped &quot;kangkung&quot; and a dollop of spicy &quot;sambal&quot;.
** Hokkien char mee, a dish of thick yellow noodles braised, fried with thick black soy sauce and added with crispy lardons, is more commonly served in the Klang Valley. It was originally developed in Kuala Lumpur. Thus, within the central region of Peninsular Malaysia, the term &quot;Hokkien mee&quot; refers to this particular version.
* Ipoh white coffee, A popular coffee drink which originated in Ipoh. Unlike the robust dark roast used for typical Malaysian-style black coffee (&quot;Kopi-O&quot;), &quot;white&quot; coffee is produced with only palm oil margarine and without any sugar and wheat, resulting in a significantly lighter roast. It is typically enriched with condensed milk prior to serving. This drink inspired the OldTown White Coffee restaurant chain, and instant beverage versions are widely available throughout Malaysia and even in international markets.
* Kam Heong, literally &quot;golden fragrance&quot; in English, Kam Heong is a method of cooking developed in Malaysia, and is a good example of the country&#x27;s culinary style of mixing cultures. The tempering of aromatics with bird&#x27;s eye chillies, curry leaves, crushed dried shrimp, curry powder, oyster sauce and various other seasonings yields a versatile stir-fry sauce that goes well with chicken, clams, crabs, prawns, and squid.
* Kway chap, Teochew dish of rice noodle sheets in a dark soy sauce gravy, served with pork pieces, pig offal, tofu products and boiled eggs.
* Lor mee, A bowl of thick yellow noodles served in a thickened gravy made from eggs, starch and pork stock.
* Marmite chicken, a unique dish of marinated fried chicken pieces glazed in a syrupy sauce made from marmite, soy sauce, maltose and honey. This dish may also be prepared with other ingredients like pork ribs and prawns.
* Ngah Po Fan or Sha Po Fan, seasoned rice cooked in a claypot with secondary ingredients, and finished with soy sauce. A typical example is rice cooked with chicken, Chinese sausage, and vegetables. Claypots are also used for braising noodles, meat dishes and reducing soups. One of the most famous and common one is:
**Claypot chicken rice, chicken rice served in a claypot, traditionally cooked with charcoal. Typical additions include salted fish and lap cheong. Bercham, a suburb in Ipoh is famous for claypot chicken rice.
* Ngo hiang or lor bak, a fried meat roll made from spiced minced pork and chopped water chestnuts rolled up in soy bean curd sheets, and deep fried. It is usually served with small bowl of &quot;Lor&quot; (a thick broth thickened with corn starch and beaten eggs) and chilli sauce. The term also extends to other items sold alongside the meat rolls, like &quot;tao kwa&quot; (hard tofu), pork sausages, tofu skin sheets etc.

* Oyster omelette or &quot;O-chian,&quot; a medley of small oysters is sauteed on a hot plate before being folded into an egg batter, which then has moistened starch mixed in for thickening, and finally fried to a crisp finish. Unlike other versions of oyster omelettes found throughout the Hokkien and Teochew diaspora, a thick savoury gravy is never poured onto Malaysian-style oyster omelettes; a chilli sauce is provided on the side for dipping instead.
* Pan mee, noodle soup with hand-kneaded and torn pieces of noodles or regular strips of machine-pressed noodles, with a toothsome texture not unlike Italian pasta. A variant popular in the Klang Valley is known as &quot;Chilli Pan Mee&quot;, and which of cooked noodles served with minced pork, a poached egg, fried anchovies and fried chilli flakes which are added to taste. Chilli Pan Mee is accompanied with a bowl of clear soup with leafy vegetables.
* Popiah, Hokkien/Teochew-style crepe stuffed and rolled up with cooked shredded tofu and vegetables like turnip and carrots. The Peranakan version contains julienned bangkuang (jicama) and bamboo shoots, and the filling is seasoned with tauchu (fermented soybean paste) and meat stock. Another variation consists of popiah doused in a spicy sauce. Popiah can also be deep fried and served in a manner similar to the mainstream Chinese spring roll.
* Tau sar pneah, A famous Penang delicacy, this round-shaped Chinese pastry contains primarily green bean paste, and its ingredients include wheat flour, sugar and salt. It is also known as Tambun biscuits as it was widely believed that the pastry originated from Bukit Tambun, Penang. Its popularity as a delicacy has made this pastry one of the must-buy souvenirs from Penang.
* Wonton Mee, thin egg noodles with wonton dumplings, choy sum and char siu. The dumplings are usually made of pork or prawns, and typically boiled or deep fried. The noodles may be served in a bowl of broth with dumplings as in the traditional Cantonese manner, but in Malaysia it is more commonly dressed with a dark soy sauce dressing, with boiled or deep-fried wonton dumplings as a topping or served on the side in a bowl of broth. Variations of this dish are usually in the meat accompaniments with the noodles. These may include roast pork, braised chicken feet, and roast duck 
* Yau Zha Gwai or Eu Char Kway or You Tiao, a version of the traditional Chinese crueller, which is a breakfast favourite. It can be eaten plain with a beverage like coffee and soy milk, spread with butter or kaya, or dipped into congee. It is shaped like a pair of chopsticks, stuck together.

Originally developed in Ampang, Selangor, Malaysian yong tau foo is a localised adaptation of a Hakka dish called &quot;ngiong tew foo&quot; (stuffed tofu with ground pork paste) and is usually served in a clear broth, with or without noodles.

* Yusheng, a festive raw fish salad, also pronounced &quot;yee sang&quot; in the Cantonese manner. While raw fish preparations are thought to have existed in China during antiquity and can be found in the Chaoshan region of Guangdong province in modern times, yusheng was created and developed in Singapore in 1964 when the republic was still a member state of the Federation of Malaysia. It consists of strips of raw fish tossed at the dining table with shredded vegetables, crispy tidbits and a combination of sauces and condiments. Yusheng literally means &quot;raw fish&quot; but since &quot;fish &quot; is commonly conflated with its homophone &quot;abundance, Yúshēng is interpreted as a homophone for Yúshēng meaning an increase in abundance. Therefore, yusheng is considered a symbol of abundance, prosperity and vigor. As a result, the mixing and tossing of yusheng with chopsticks and the subsequent consumption of the salad has become ritualised as part of the commemoration of Chinese New Year festivities in Malaysia and Singapore.
* Zongzi, a traditional Chinese food made of glutinous rice stuffed with savoury or sweet fillings and wrapped in bamboo, reed, or other large flat leaves. They are cooked by steaming or boiling, and are a feature of the Duanwu festival, which is still celebrated by the Chinese communities in Malaysia.

The recipe differs from household to household, but generally green tea leaves are added to a mixture of salt, ground mint leaves, toasted sesame seeds and nuts. The mixture is ground or pounded into a fine powder, then brewed into a drink. Taste salty, minty, and full of nutrition.
* Gong Pian or Kom Piang, This is a type of clay oven-baked biscuit/bagel associated with the Fuzhounese settlers brought in by the British.

The Gong Pians out of Sitiawan are generally sweet, but the Gong Pians in Sitiawan are salty. It is usually filled with pork, lard or onions and is best eaten while still hot and crispy. Fuzhou cuisine is unique in its own, different from the other more common Chinese clan communities. It is uncommon and can only be found mainly in Sitiawan and Sibu.

===Malaysian Indian cuisine===
Malaysian Indian cuisine, or the cooking of the ethnic Indian communities in Malaysia consists of adaptations of authentic dishes from India, as well as original creations inspired by the diverse food culture of Malaysia. As the vast majority of Malaysia&#x27;s Indian community are mostly ethnic Tamils who are descendants of the modern Indian state of Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka&#x27;s Northern Province, much of Malaysian Indian cuisine is predominantly South Indian inspired in character and taste. A typical Malaysian Indian dish is likely to be redolent with curry leaves, whole and powdered spice, and contains fresh coconut in various forms. Ghee is still widely used for cooking, although vegetable oils and refined palm oils are now commonplace in home kitchens. Before a meal it is customary to wash hands as cutlery is often not used while eating, with the exception of a serving spoon for each respective dish.

Food served in the traditional South Indian manner is termed banana leaf rice. Plain white or parboiled rice would be served with an assortment of vegetable preparations, lentil gravy, pickles, condiments, and papadum crackers on a banana leaf, which acts as a disposable plate. Banana leaf meals are eaten to celebrate special occasions such as festivals, birthdays, marriages, or to commemorate funeral wakes. It is customary to consume banana leaf meals by hand and to show appreciation for the food by folding the banana leaf inwards, though less ritual and etiquette is observed when the meal isn&#x27;t part of a formal occasion, such as the Malayalee community&#x27;s elaborate Sadya feasts. Boiled eggs, meat or seafood dishes are available at banana leaf restaurants which are not exclusively vegetarian or vegan.

Some notable Malaysian Indian dishes include:
* Satti Sorru, Indian claypot rice
* Chapati, a North Indian style flatbread. It is made from a dough of atta flour (whole grain durum wheat), water and salt by rolling the dough out into discs of approximately twelve centimetres in diameter and browning the discs on both sides on a very hot, dry tava or frying pan without any oil.

* Roti canai, a thin unleavened bread with a flaky crust, fried on a skillet with oil and served with condiments. It is sometimes referred to as roti kosong. A host of variations on this classic dish may be found at all Mamak eateries, either at the creative whim of the cook or by customers&#x27; special request. A few examples include: roti telur (fried with eggs), roti bawang (fried with thinly sliced onions), roti bom (a smaller but denser roti, usually round in shape), roti pisang (banana), and so on.
* Roti tissue, a variant of roti canai made as thin as a piece of 40–50 cm round-shaped tissue in density. It is then carefully folded by the cook into a tall, conical shape and left to stand upright.

===Sabahan food===
The food of Sabah reflects the ethnic diversity of its population and is very eclectic. Traditional Kadazandusun cuisine involves mostly boiling or grilling and employs little use of oil. From simple appetizers of seasoned unripe mango to a variety of pickled foods collectively known as &quot;noonsom&quot;, tangy and pungent flavours derived from souring agents or fermentation techniques is a key characteristic of traditional Kadazandusun cooking. Rice wine accompanies all Kadazandusun celebrations and rites, and at a Murut event there will be rows upon rows of jars with fermented tapioca tapai. Presently few eateries in Sabah serve traditional indigenous dishes, although it will always be found during festive occasions like weddings and funerals, as well as the Kaamatan and Kalimaran cultural festivals. Chinese-influenced dishes like northern Chinese potstickers and Hakka stuffed tofu, along with many original creations developed in Sabah&#x27;s interior settlements by immigrants from both northern and southern China throughout the 20th century, feature prominently on the menus of many kopitiam establishments and upscale restaurants.

Sabah is notable for its excellent seafood, temperate produce and tea (Sabah tea has GI status) grown in the highlands of Mt. Kinabalu, and a small coffee plantation industry with Tenom coffee considered the best produce in the region. Local ingredients like freshwater fish, wild boar (&quot;bakas&quot; in native dialects), bamboo shoots, wild ferns, and various jungle produce still figure prominently in the daily diet of the local population. As a significant portion of rural communities still subsist on agriculture as their primary source of income, small scale festivals are even held each year at certain towns to celebrate produce vital to the livelihoods of the local people: the Pesta Jagung of Kota Marudu, the Pesta Rumbia (sago) of Kuala Penyu, and Pesta Kelapa from the town of Kudat. Sabah vegetable, also known as &quot;cekuk manis&quot; or &quot;sayur manis&quot; (Chinese : 树仔菜), can be found on the menus of many eateries and restaurants throughout the state of Sabah. It is one of the local terms used for a variety of &quot;Sauropus albicans&quot; developed in Lahad Datu, which yields crunchy edible shoots in addition to its leaves. The flavour is reminiscent of spinach but more complex, &quot;as though it had been fortified with broccoli and infused with asparagus&quot;, and is typically stir-fried with eggs or seasonings like sambal belacan.

Whether grilled, cured, deep-fried, steamed, stir-fried, braised, served raw, or made into soups, Sabah&#x27;s seafood is famed for its freshness, quality, and good value for money. A vast variety of fish, cephalopods, marine crustaceans, shellfish, sea cucumbers and jellyfish have become mainstays on lunch and dinner menus at kopitiam, restaurants, and humble food shacks all over Kota Kinabalu and other coastal towns like Sandakan, Tawau, Lahad Datu and Semporna. Seafood paired with noodles also figure prominently for breakfast, for each day locals flock to speciality eateries where they may be served an assortment of fish-based products to start the day. Examples include: poached patties handmade with fresh fish paste; deep-fried fish cakes wrapped in tofu skin sheets; and noodle soups with toppings like sliced fish fillet, fish or prawn balls, and fish innards. A few eateries even serve &quot;noodles&quot; rolled out with fresh fish paste.

Edible seaweed is a traditional food for certain seaside communities throughout Sabah and also possess GI status. Latok is similar in appearance to clusters of green-hued fish eggs or grapes, and is typically prepared as a salad by the Bajau people. Coral seaweed is another popular seaplant product; in recent times it is marketed as a gourmet health food to both locals and tourists, and is given the moniker of &quot;sea bird&#x27;s nest&quot; (Chinese : 海底燕窝) as coral seaweed acquires a similar gelatinous texture when dissolved in water.

Among the foods and beverages particular to Sabah are:
* Amplang is a type of cracker made from Spanish mackerel, tapioca starch and other seasonings, and then deep fried.
* Bahar or baa is the Kadazandusun variant of palm wine made with sap collected from the cut flower bud of a young coconut tree and a special type of tree bark called &quot;rosok&quot;, endemic to the Tuaran district.

* Bosou, also called noonsom or tonsom, is the Kadazandusun term for a traditional recipe of tangy fermented meat. Smoked and pulverised buah keluak (nuts from the Kepayang tree (Pangium edule) which grows in Malaysia&#x27;s mangrove swamplands), or &quot;pangi&quot; is a key ingredient and acts as a preservative. Combined with rice, salt and fresh meat or fish, the mixture is then placed into a sealed jar or container for fermentation. Contemporary variants for &quot;bosou&quot; add bananas and pineapples to the mixture. &quot;Pinongian&quot; is a variant where rice is omitted to produce a final product which is much less tangy in taste; however, unlike bosou, &quot;pinongian&quot; must be cooked before serving.

Commercially produced lihing, much pricier than the homebrewed version but consistent in quality, is also available in select souvenir shops. Lihing and similar rice wine variants from other Kadazandusun communities may also be distilled to produce a hard liquor called &quot;montoku&quot; or &quot;talak&quot;.
* Linongot is a type of leaf parcel (usually &quot;irik&quot; or tarap leaves) filled with a combination of cooked rice and root vegetables like sweet potatoes and yam. Alternate names known by Kadazandusun communities in other districts include &quot;linopod&quot; and &quot;sinamazan&quot;.

* Pinasakan or Pinarasakan is a home-style Kadazandusun dish of fish simmered with &quot;takob-akob&quot; (dried skin of a mangosteen-like fruit which functions as a souring agent) or slices of unripe &quot;bambangan&quot;, as well as fresh turmeric leaves and rhizome.

This dish of wok fried fresh handmade noodles is well known in the nearby city of Kota Kinabalu as well as in neighbouring Tamparuli town, where the localised adaptation is called Tamparuli mee (Chinese: 担波罗利炒生面). The noodles must first be toasted with oil in the wok to prevent it from clumping together, then blanched to reduce the stiff crunchy texture from toasting.

A more recent recipe called &quot;serunding tuhau&quot; involves slicing tuhau stems into thin floss-like shreds, which is then sauteed until it becomes golden and crisp. It has a distinctive scent which is said to have a polarising effect even among indigenous Sabahans.

===Sarawakian food===

Sarawakian is quite distinct from the regional cuisines of the Peninsular. It is considered less spicy, lightly prepared and with more emphasis on subtle flavours. The most important spice in Sarawakian cuisine is pepper. Pepper is commercially produced on an industrial scale as a cash crop, and the preferred choice by local cooks when heat is wanted in a dish. Granted GI status by MyIPO, Sarawak black pepper is highly regarded by international culinary figures such as Alain Ducasse.

While the Iban constitute the largest Dayak subgroup as well as the most populous ethnic group in Sarawak, much of the ethnic Iban population is still concentrated away from Sarawak&#x27;s main urban areas, congregating instead within longhouse communities scattered all over the interior regions of the state. The traditional cookery of the Iban is called &quot;pansoh&quot; or &quot;pansuh&quot;, which is the preparation and cooking of food in bamboo tubes. Ingredients like poultry, fish, pork, vegetables or rice are mixed with fragrant herbs like lemongrass, tapioca leaves and &quot;bungkang&quot; leaves (a species of myrtle from the Eugenia genus), then sealed within the bamboo tubes and placed directly over an open fire. Cooking food this way will infuse it with aroma and flavour from the bamboo tubes while keeping it moist.

During Dayak festivals or Gawai, the Iban would slaughter locally reared pigs. The pig would be cleaned thoroughly after the slaughter, have its head and stomach removed, and the rest of the pig would be cut into smaller pieces in preparation for barbecuing. The head and stomach of a pig are usually put aside and prepared separately as they are considered the choicest parts of the animal; hence pig&#x27;s heads are a common edible gift brought by visitors to an Iban longhouse, and dishes such as pork stomach cooked with pineapples are a must for Gawai.

Sarawak is notable for its rice; currently three varieties grown in Sarawak has been granted GI status by MyIPO.
Among the foods and beverages particular to Sarawak are:

* Belacan bihun is rice vermicelli dressed in a gravy made from ground chillies, belacan, tamarind, and dried shrimp. It is garnished with cured cuttlefish, julienned cucumber, bean sprouts and century egg wedges.
* Bubur pedas is a type of rice congee cooked with a specially prepared spice paste, or &quot;rempah&quot; made from turmeric, lemon grass, galangal, chillies, ginger, coconut and shallots. A fairly complex and spicy dish compared to most typical congee preparations, Bubur Pedas is often prepared during the month of Ramadan and served during the breaking of fast.
* Daun ubi tumbuk or pucuk ubi tumbuk is a preparation of cassava leaves (known as &quot;empasak&quot; by the Iban) which has the consistency of pesto, and is widely eaten among Sarawak&#x27;s native communities. The pounded leaves may be sauteed with seasonings like anchovies and chilli, stuffed into a bamboo tube and roasted over an open fire, or simply boiled with shallot, fat and salt.
* Ikan terubuk masin is salt-preserved toli shad, which is endemic to the coastal waters of Sarawak, stretching from Sematan to Lawas. It is considered an iconic delicacy in Sarawak, and thus a prized edible gift.
* Kasam ensabi is a fermented vegetable pickle made from an indigenous cultivar of mustard greens (&quot;ensabi&quot;) and is traditional to the Iban community.
* Kolo mee or mee kolok (Chinese: 干捞面) is a dish of springy egg noodles tossed in a sweet and savoury shallot, lard and vinegar dressing, and topped with seasoned minced pork and char siu. It is similar to Peninsular-style Hakka mee or wonton mee in concept, but differs significantly in taste profile. A popular variant uses rendered oil from cooking char siu to flavour kolo mee instead of plain lard, which gives the noodles a reddish hue. Halal versions of kolo mee replace the pork components with beef (earning the moniker of &quot;mee sapi&quot;) or chicken, and lard with peanut or vegetable oil. Additional toppings can include mushrooms, chicken and crab meat. &quot;Kampua mee&quot; (Chinese: 干盘面) is a similar dish from Sibu of Fuzhou origin.

A related Bidayuh dish is &quot;Asam Siok&quot;, with the addition of rice to the chicken mixture. These dishes are not commonly found in urban eateries and restaurants due to the practicality of roasting a bamboo tube over an open fire within a typical commercial kitchen.
* Nasi goreng dabai is rice stir-fried with dabai (&quot;Canarium odontophyllum&quot;), an indigenous fruit found only in Sarawak. It is often compared to an olive, due to their similarity in appearance as well as taste. As dabai is highly perishable and seasonal in nature, this dish is also prepared with preserved dabai paste.
* Nuba laya is cooked Bario rice which is mashed and wrapped in leaves of the &quot;phacelophrynium maximum&quot; plant. It is considered the centerpiece of a meal for the Lun Bawang and Kelabit people. Accompaniments may include a small bowl of porridge (&quot;kikid&quot;), shredded beef cooked with wild ginger and dried chilli (&quot;labo senutuq&quot;), deboned shredded fish (&quot;a&#x27;beng&quot;), wild jungle vegetables prepared in various ways, and so on.

Originally from Kuching, its popularity has spread to other areas of Sarawak as well as neighbouring Sabah.
* Tuak is a type of liquor traditional to Sarawak&#x27;s Dayak communities. It is most commonly made from fermented normal or glutinous rice, but there is no accepted convention or definition on what constitutes tuak. Tuak is essentially an alcoholic drink produced by fermenting anything that contains carbohydrates, as long as it is made in Sarawak by Sarawakians. with The Bidayuh in particular are known for their skill and expertise in brewing tuak: ingredients for tuak variants include sugarcane (&quot;tepui&quot;), tampoi (a wild fruit with a sweet and tart flavour), pineapples and apples. Tuak is normally served as a welcoming drink to guests, and as an important component for ritual events and festive occasions like Gawai and Christmas. Tuak may also be distilled to make a spirit called &quot;langkau&quot;.
* Umai is a traditional Melanau food, accompanied with a bowl of baked or toasted sago pearls. There are two different versions of umai – the traditional sambal campur and a more contemporary variation called &quot;sambal cecah jeb&quot;. The former is a raw seafood salad which consists of raw sliced seafood (anything from freshwater and seawater fish, prawns and even jellyfish) cured in calamansi lime juice, tossed with ground peanuts, sliced onions and chillies. For &quot;umai jeb&quot;, the raw sliced seafood is undressed, and is simply dipped into a spicy sauce for consumption.
* White Lady is a chilled drink made with milk, mango juice, longan and pineapple. Invented in 1975 by a Kuching hawker, multiple variations can be found in various hawker stalls throughout the city.

===Peranakan food===

Peranakan cuisine, also called Nyonya food, was developed by the Straits Chinese whose descendants reside in today&#x27;s Malaysia and Singapore. The old Malay word nyonya (also spelled nonya), a term of respect and affection for women of prominent social standing (part &quot;madame&quot; and part &quot;auntie&quot;), has come to refer to the cuisine of the Peranakans. It uses mainly Chinese ingredients but blends them with Malay ingredients such as coconut milk, lemon grass, turmeric, tamarind, pandan leaves, chillies and sambal. It can be considered as a blend of Chinese and Malay cooking, with influences from Indonesian Chinese cuisine (for the Nyonya food of Malaccan and Singaporean) and Thai cuisine (for Penang Nyonya cuisine). Traditional Nyonya cooking is often very elaborate, labour-intensive and time-consuming, and the Peranakan community often consider the best Nyonya food is to be found in private homes.

Examples of Nyonya dishes include:
* Acar, various pickled meats and vegetables like acar keat-lah (honey lime/calamansi), achar hu (fried fish), acar kiam hu (salt fish), acar timun (cucumber), acar awat (mixed vegetables).
* Asam Laksa (Mandarin: 亞三叻沙). Considered one of Penang&#x27;s three signature dishes, Asam laksa is similar to the Malay &quot;laksa utara&quot;, which consists of a bowl of translucent &quot;al dente&quot; rice noodles served in a spicy soup made of fish (usually mackerel), tamarind (both &quot;asam jawa&quot; and &quot;asam gelugor&quot;), and &quot;daun kesum&quot;. Toppings differ considerably, and may include onion, mint, chopped torch ginger flower, and slices of pineapple and cucumber. A dollop of pungent, viscous sweet fermented shrimp paste (&quot;Petis udang&quot; or &quot;Hae Ko&quot;) is usually served on the side.

<text>Palmerston North (; , colloquially known as Palmerston or Palmy) is a city in the North Island of New Zealand and the seat of the Manawatū-Whanganui region. Located in the eastern Manawatu Plains, the city is near the north bank of the Manawatū River, from the river&#x27;s mouth, and from the end of the Manawatū Gorge, about north of the capital, Wellington. Palmerston North is the country&#x27;s eighth-largest urban area, with an urban population of The estimated population of Palmerston North city is 

The official limits of the city take in rural areas to the south, north-east, north-west and west of the main urban area, extending to the Tararua Ranges; including the town of Ashhurst at the mouth of the Manawatū Gorge, the villages of Bunnythorpe and Longburn in the north and west respectively. The city covers a land area of .

The city&#x27;s location was once little more than a clearing in a forest and occupied by small communities of Māori, who called it &quot;Papa-i-Oea&quot;, believed to mean &quot;How beautiful it is&quot;. In the mid-19th century, it was settled by Europeans—originally by Scandinavians and, later, British settlers. On foundation, the British settlement was bestowed the name Palmerston, in honour of Viscount Palmerston, a former British Prime Minister. The suffix &quot;North&quot; was added in 1871 to distinguish the settlement from Palmerston in the South Island. Today, the name is often informally shortened to &quot;Palmy&quot;.

Early Palmerston North relied on public works and sawmilling. The west coast railway was built in 1886, linking the town to Wellington, and Palmerston North benefited from a booming pastoral farming industry. Linton Military Camp, Palmerston North Hospital, and the establishment of Massey University (in 1927) have reduced the dependence on farming due to more skilled workers, since the early 20th century. Popular attractions include Te Manawa (a museum and art gallery that includes the New Zealand Rugby Museum), and several performing arts venues.

==History==
===Early settlement===
Ngāti Rangitāne were the local Māori iwi (&quot;tangata whenua&quot;) living in the area known as &quot;Te Ahu-ā-Tūranga&quot;, when a trader, Jack Duff, became the earliest known European to explore the area . He came on a whaling ship and explored possibly as far inland as the site of Woodville. He reported his discovery on arrival back to Porirua. Colonel Wakefield heard of the potential that the Manawatu had for development and visited in 1840. In 1846 Charles Hartley, another trader, heard from &quot;tangata whenua&quot; of a clearing in the Papaioea forest, and he proceeded through the dense bush and forest and discovered it for Europeans.

In 1858, the Government began negotiations with local iwi to purchase land in Manawatu. There was a dispute at the time between the rival iwi Ngāti Rangitāne and Ngāti Raukawa as to who had the right to sell. The dispute is resolved in favour of Rangitāne. On a visit in 1859, John Tiffin Stewart, an employee of the Wellington Provincial Council, was shown the Papaioea clearing by the Rangitāne chief, Te Hirawanu, and noted its suitability for a &quot;good site for a township&quot;. In 1864, Te Ahu-a-Turanga Block was sold by Rangitāne to the Government for £12,000, in an effort to open the Manawatu to settlement.

Stewart returned in 1866 on behalf of the Wellington Provincial Council (under whose jurisdiction the new purchase fell) and made the original survey and subdivision in the Papaioea forest clearing. The settlement, named Palmerston to commemorate the recently deceased Prime Minister of Great Britain, was laid out according to Stewart&#x27;s plan, consisting of a series of wide and straight streets in a rectangular pattern. The focal point was an open space of subsequently known as The Square. On 3 October 1866, Palmerston was formally endorsed after Isaac Earl Featherston (Wellington Provincial Superintendent) signed a proclamation defining the boundaries of the settlement. The first sections were sold after. 

Among the first settlers included Scandinavians, who arrived in 1871. They established settlements at Awapuni and Whakarongo/Stoney Creek.

Later the same year, the suffix &quot;North&quot; was added to distinguish the settlement of the same name in Otago. In 1872, a petition was launched to change the name of the settlement. A public meeting in 1873 ends with no clear decision on the name.

The railway line was laid through the Square in 1875. The foundation stone for the original All Saints Church was laid by Louisa Snelson on 29 September 1875. By 1875 there were newspapers, a doctor and a post office.

In 1876, Palmerston North became a Local Board District, within the Wellington Provincial Council. This existed until the abolition of the provinces later the same year. Also in the same year, the council set aside land north of the Manawatū River for the purposes of a reserve. In 1890, this land was again set aside and would become, in 1897, the &quot;Victoria Esplanade&quot;.

===Growing population===

By 1877, when the Borough Council came into existence, Palmerston North was an isolated village in the midst of the native forest that covered inland Manawatu. By 1878, the population was 880 and sawmilling was the main industry of the district. 

The arrival of the railway in 1886 saw an increase in the speed of growth, and the town was at the centre of a lucrative agricultural district. The opening of the nearby Longburn Freezing Works provided employment, while the Borough Council instigated more infrastructural schemes such as the sewerage system. The Railway through the Manawatū Gorge to Napier was completed in 1891. 

In 1893, Rangitāne sold the Hokowhitu block, increasing the area of land available for settlement. In the same year, the Public Hospital opened in a wooden building on Terrace Street (now Ruahine Street). The hospital required significant fundraising. At the end of the decade, the Boer War broke out in South Africa and men from Palmerston North were among the volunteers.

By 1900 the population had reached 6,000. In the 1910s, Palmerston North&#x27;s growth was steady. The population in 1911 about 10,991 (excluding Māori). The city was affected by World War I, with Awapuni Racecourse being used as an army training camp in 1914. During the course of the war, the Borough Council renamed all German-sounding and foreign street names. When the war finished in 1918, celebrations were delayed due to the Influenza epidemic.

===City status===
In 1930, the population reached the 20,000 threshold and Palmerston North was officially proclaimed a city, the 7th in New Zealand. Development was slow due to the Great Depression and World War II. An airport was established at Milson in 1936, which is now Palmerston North Airport. From 1938, the First Labour government (1935–1949) initiated state housing programmes in West End (Savage Crescent precinct) and Roslyn.

In 1941, the Manawatū River flooded again, having last flooded in 1902. Large parts of Hokowhitu and Awapuni were underwater, with residents evacuating to higher ground (peaked at 5.8m).

In 1940, the Māori Battalion was formed in Palmerston North and trained at the Showgrounds (now Arena Manawatu). In 1942, Linton Army Camp was established. After the war, the city&#x27;s growth was rapid. In 1949, the city&#x27;s boundaries had extended to include Milson and Kelvin Grove. In 1953, the boundaries would further extend to include Awapuni, which in the same year, was again flooded by the Manawatū River, along with Hokowhitu. It was the largest flood since 1902.

Although work had started in 1926, it was not until 1959 the Milson Deviation of the North Island Main Trunk was opened. This meant future trains would pass to the north of the city, instead of through the Square. Later in 1963, the railway station at Tremaine Avenue opens. The last trains passed through the Square in 1964.

In 1961, the Highbury was added to the council area. In 1963, Massey University College of Manawatu was formed by the amalgamation of the Massey Agricultural College with the Palmerston North University College. In 1964, it became Massey University, an autonomous tertiary learning institution with the power to grant its own degrees.

In 1967, city boundaries were again extended to include land in Aokautere, Kelvin Grove, Milson, Amberley (Westbrook) and Awapuni as part of future growth for the next 25 years.

In 1969, volunteers established the Esplanade Scenic Railway at Victoria Esplanade. The railway features a 2.2 km (1.4 mi) miniature railway track offering 20-minute rides through native bush.

In 1970, the New Zealand Rugby Museum was established and a tribute to the founding father of rugby in New Zealand, Charles Munro, was opened at Massey University.

In 1971, a competition to design a civic building for the vacant railway land at the Square, was won by Wellington architects, Maurice and John Patience. The resulting building was finished in 1979. In 1976, the Manawatu and Oroua rivers flooded, 24-hour rainfall records in Feilding and Palmerston North were exceeded and some residents from both locations were evacuated.

In 1977, Palmerston North City Council celebrated its Centenary of Municipal government. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh are among visitors to Palmerston North.

On 1 November 1989, New Zealand local government authorities were reorganised. Palmerston North City boundaries were extended to include Ashhurst, Linton and Turitea through amalgamation of parts of the former Kairanga County, Oroua County and Ashhurst Town Council.

On 1 July 2012, Bunnythorpe, Longburn, part of the area around Kairanga and an area around Ashhurst were transferred from the Manawatū District to Palmerston North City.

==Geography==

Although the land Palmerston North is situated on is bounded by the lofty Ruahine and Tararua ranges in the east and south respectively, the city has a predominantly flat appearance. The occasional rise in elevation occurs further away from the river and is especially pronounced in the north and northeast, and also on the south side of the river. The typical urban area elevation ranges between 20 and 40 metres (65–130 ft) above sea level.

The highest point is above sea level. This is in the Tararua ranges, south-east of Scotts Road.

The lowest point is above sea level. This is at the river bank near Te Puna Road. Incidentally, both these locations are in the south-west of the city, by Linton.

===Palmerston North City Council===

Palmerston North is governed by a city council consisting of the Mayor and 15 councillors, elected on a citywide basis.

In 2017 the Council voted to create a Māori ward, but the decision was overturned by a city-wide referendum in May 2018.

In 2021, Palmerston North City Council decided to establish Māori and general wards under the Local Electoral (Māori Wards and Māori Constituencies) Amendment Act 2021. Starting in 2022, there is a Māori ward called Te Pūao Ward, with two councillors; and a general ward called Te Hirawanui Ward, with 13 councillors.

Before the 2016 election councillors were elected representing one of five city wards, but Palmerston North&#x27;s electoral wards were abolished by the Local Government Commission in 2013. The 2013 election also saw the single transferable vote (STV) system introduced, replacing first past the post (FPP).
The council&#x27;s functions are broken down into six units: Planning, Customer, Finance, People &amp; Performance, Infrastructure, and Chief Executive.

The Chief Executive is Waid Crockett, who replaced Heather Shotter in 2022.

The well-known retailer EziBuy was established in Palmerston North in 1978 by brothers Peter and Gerard Gillespie and operated successfully for many years. The Gillespies sold the business to Woolworths Limited in 2013 when it was the largest fashion and homeware multi-channel retailer in Australasia, mailing over 23 million catalogues and processing more than 1.75 million orders annually. After a number of subsequent changes of ownership the business was put into liquidation in July 2023 with creditors owed more than $100 million.

==Amenities and attractions==

Palmerston North has a number of facilities and attractions. It is also the gateway to attractions in other parts of the region, such as Tongariro National Park, Ruahine and Tararua Ranges. When Palmerston North Airport serviced international flights, the city was also an international gateway to Hawke&#x27;s Bay, Whanganui and Taranaki.

===Retail===
The Plaza Shopping Centre is the largest shopping mall in the Manawatū-Whanganui region and a key shopping centre in the lower North Island, boasting over 100 stores. The mall was originally developed by the Premier Drapery Company (PDC) department store and opened in 1986 as the PDC Plaza. After PDC went into receivership in 1988, the mall was sold and assumed its current name in 1990. The shopping centre underwent refurbishment and expansion between 2008 and 2010.

Downtown on Broadway combines retail and boutique shopping and Event Cinemas.

===The Square===
Originally part of the Papaioea clearing, The Square is a seven-hectare park of lawn, trees, lakes, fountains, and gardens in the centre of the city. It is the city&#x27;s original park and also the centrepoint from whence the city&#x27;s main streets are arranged.

The Square contains the city&#x27;s war memorial and a memorial dedicated to Te Peeti Te Aweawe, the Rangitāne chief instrumental in the sale of Palmerston North district to the government in 1865.
Near the centre of the park is the Hopwood Clock Tower with its illuminated cross and coloured lights. Also here is the city&#x27;s iSite, the Civic Building (seat of the City Council), the City Library, Square Edge and the commercial heart of Palmerston North&#x27;s CBD. Retail stores (including the Plaza) and eateries line the road surrounding the park.

In around 1878, a Māori contingent, including Te Aweawe, gathered together to choose a Māori name for The Square. They chose &quot;Te Marae o Hine&quot;, meaning &quot;The Courtyard of the Daughter of Peace&quot;. This name reflected their hope that all people of all races would live together in enduring peace.

===Parks and recreational facilities===

Palmerston North and its surroundings feature roughly 100 parks and reserves.
Most notable is Victoria Esplanade, a park located along the northern bank of the Manawatū River west of Fitzherbert Avenue. It was opened in 1897 to commemorate the 60th Jubilee of Queen Victoria&#x27;s reign, and includes a native bush reserve along the river bank, formal botanical gardens, playgrounds and the Café Esplanade, all connected with walking and bicycle tracks. Located within the Esplanade are several attractions. The Peter Black Conservatory is a large tropical greenhouse built in 1941 and refurbished in 2014. The Wildbase Recovery visitor centre and aviary for recovering wildlife opened in 2019 and is run in partnership with Massey University&#x27;s Veterinary Hospital. The volunteer-operated Esplanade Scenic Railway features a miniature railway track offering 20-minute rides through native bush. New Zealand&#x27;s largest rose garden, the Dugald McKenzie Rose Garden, is the site of the New Zealand international rose trials and contributed to the city&#x27;s one-time nickname, &quot;Rose City&quot;. It was recognised in 2003 by the World Federation of Rose Societies as one of the finest rose gardens in the world.

Adjacent to the Esplanade are the multi-sport playing fields of Ongley and Manawaroa Parks, the twin turf hockey fields and Fitzherbert Park, the premier cricket ground.

Elsewhere in the city are parks for sports like rugby, such as Coronation Park, Bill Brown Park and Colquhoun Park (also used for softball/baseball); and football: Skoglund Park (home of the Central Football Federation) and Celaeno Park. The Hokowhitu Lagoon is also located nearby the Esplanade and is a popular site for recreational kayaking and canoeing.

The Lido Aquatic Centre is Palmerston North&#x27;s largest aquatic centre. Freyberg Community Pool is an all-year indoor swimming pool complex located next to Freyberg High School in Roslyn.

Memorial Park has a splash pad, pool, playground, football pitch and a duck pond, within easy reach of the city centre.

==== Riverbank development ====
The city council since 2012 has been beautifying the banks of the Manawatū River, opening up previously neglected areas into more accessible recreational parks and reserves. Part of this development is He Ara Kotahi, a pedestrian and cycle track that connects the city to Massey University, adjacent research institutes and Linton Military Camp, all located on the south side of the Manawatū River. The opening in 2019 included the opening of Palmerston North&#x27;s second bridge, a pedestrian bridge connecting the Holiday Park on Dittmer Drive to the track across the river. As well as a recreational asset, He Ara Kotahi was designed to be a pedestrian and cycle commuter route between the city bridge and Massey University, to improve safety and relieve vehicle traffic volumes on the Fitzherbert Bridge. The remainder of the track to Linton crosses tributary streams with boardwalks and four smaller bridges.

===Libraries===
Palmerston North has a main public library with five branches and one mobile library. The central Palmerston North Library is located in the Square and houses the main collections. The other four are located in Ashhurst, Awapuni, Linton, Roslyn and Te Pātikitiki (Highbury).

====Youth Space====
Near the Square is the Youth Space, which opened in September 2011 as a dedicated place for Palmerston North&#x27;s many young people to congregate in a safe environment. Youth space is free to all, and provides table-tennis, gaming consoles, musical instruments, library books, iPads, a kitchen, and other services.

*Globe Theatre is a small community theatre of around 200 seats, opened in November 1982 as a partnership between the City Council and the Manawatu Theatre Society: both parties contributed capital funds to enable the building to be constructed. The building was designed by local architect, Brian Elliot, who returned to design the Theatre&#x27;s major redevelopments in 2014, with the addition of a second auditorium and an extension to the foyer and café/bar area. The redevelopment won a New Zealand Architecture Award for Elliot&#x27;s work.

Top comics including John Clarke, Jon Bridges, Jeremy Corbett, Tom Scott all come from Palmerston North as do stage, television and film performers Paul Barrett, Shane Cortese, Kate Louise Elliott, Simon Ferry, Greg Johnson, Jeff Kingsford-Brown and Alison Quigan and drag performer Spankie Jackzon.

====Music====
Palmerston North has a thriving musical scene, with many national and international acts touring through the town, and many local acts performing regularly.

Local groups include the Manawatu Sinfonia and Manawatu Youth Orchestra (MYO) who perform throughout the year. The Manawatu Youth Orchestra celebrated its 50th year in September 2011.

Palmerston North is also home to the Palmerston North Brass Band. Founded in 1868 by army troops stationed in the region, the Palmerston North Brass Band technically pre-dates the city of Palmerston North. In 2018, the band celebrated its 150th anniversary.

==Infrastructure and services==
===Health===
Palmerston North Hospital is the city&#x27;s main public hospital, and is the seat of the MidCentral District Health Board. The hospital is the major trauma centre for Palmerston North, Otaki, and the Manawatu, Horowhenua and Tararua districts.

There were two private hospitals, Aorangi and Southern Cross. In 2012, these two private surgical hospitals merged and are now known as Crest Hospital.

===Electricity===
The Palmerston North Municipal Electricity Department (MED) was formed in 1924 to supply the city with electricity. The Manawatu-Oroua Electric Power Board (EPB) supplied the surrounding rural areas. Electricity was initially generated at the Keith Street power station until the transmission lines from Mangahao Power Station to Bunnythorpe substation were completed in March 1925. The Keith Street power station continued to regularly generate electricity until the Inter-Island HVDC link was commissioned in 1965, when it was relegated to standby duty before finally being decommissioned in 1992.

The Palmerston North MED and Mawawatu Oroua EPB were dissolved in the late 1990s with the government electricity sector reforms. The retail business was sold to Genesis Energy while the lines business became part of Powerco. Today, Powerco continues to operate the local distribution network, with electricity fed from two Transpower substations, at Bunnythorpe and at Linton. There is now a competitive electricity retail market, although Genesis continues to be the dominant retailer in the city.

Three wind farms are located on the Ruahine and Tararua Ranges bordering Palmerston North: Te Āpiti Wind Farm, Tararua windfarm and Te Rere Hau Wind Farm. The three farms together have a maximum output of 300 MW.

===Natural gas===
Palmerston North was one of the original nine towns and cities in New Zealand to be supplied with natural gas when the Kapuni gas field entered production in 1970 and a 260 km high-pressure pipeline from Kapuni south to Wellington (including a 27 km lateral pipeline from Himatangi to supply Palmerston North) was completed. The high-pressure transmission pipelines supplying the city are now owned and operated by First Gas, with Powerco owning and operating the medium and low-pressure distribution pipelines within the city.

In the 2013 census, 40.5% of Palmerston North homes were heated wholly or partially by natural gas, the highest in New Zealand.

===Internet and telephone===
Fibre to the premises is being deployed in Palmerston North as part of the Government&#x27;s Ultra-Fast Broadband programme. , the fibre roll-out in the city is 94 percent complete, with a 42.2 percent uptake rate.

=== Water and sewage ===
The majority of Palmerston North&#x27;s water supply is drawn from the Turitea Stream, in the Tararua Range south of the city. The supply is supplemented by four artesian wells, at Papaioea Park, Takaro Park, Keith Street and Roberts Line. The waterworks first opened in 1889 and was extended in 1906, but the first sewers, septic tanks and filter beds not until 1907. The first sewage works was at Maxwells Line. Sewage is now treated at the nearby Tōtara Road, before discharging to the river. An upgrade is being planned to reduce pollution.

==Transport==
Palmerston North is a significant road and rail junction. As such, it is an important distribution hub for the Central and lower North Island, with many freight distribution centres based here.

===Road===
Palmerston North&#x27;s arterial roads are arranged in a grid pattern. There are four main dual-carriageway roads radiating from The Square, splitting the city into four quadrants: Rangitikei Street to the north, Fitzherbert Avenue to the south, and Main Street to the east and west.

====State highways====
Palmerston North is served by four state highways:

* State Highway 3 runs northwest–southeast from SH 1 at Sanson through central Palmerston North (via Rangitikei Street, Grey Street, Princess Street and Main Street East), to SH 2 at Woodville. The section from Sanson forms the main route from the upper North Island, Taranaki and Whanganui into Palmerston North, while the section from Woodville forms the main route from the Hawke&#x27;s Bay into Palmerston North.
* State Highway 57 runs southwest–northeast from SH 1 at Ohau, south of Levin, through the southern outskirts of Palmerston North to SH 3 east of Ashhurst. It forms the main route from Wellington to southern and eastern Palmerston North.
* State Highway 56 runs southwest–northeast from SH 57 at Makeura, northeast of Shannon, New Zealand, to the intersection of Pioneer Highway and Maxwells Line in the suburb of Awapuni. It forms the main route from Wellington to northern and western Palmerston North.
* State Highway 54 runs north–south from SH 1 at Vinegar Hill, north of Hunterville, through Feilding to SH 3 at Newbury, on the northern Palmerston North border. It provides an alternative route from the Upper North island into Palmerston North

====Cycling====
Palmerston North is perceived as being better for cycling than most New Zealand cities, with 2001 figures putting it a close second only to Blenheim in terms of bicycle modal share. However, by 2006, cycling to work had almost halved in a decade to 5.4% and the 2013 census found that, in the central city, only 6 cycled, but 690 travelled by motor vehicle.

The Manawatu River Pathway is great for family or beginners riders, as it is all flat to mildly contoured, with some limestone sections, as well as wide cement paths. The track has many access points to this trail, which runs for over 9 km between Maxwells Line in the West to Riverside Drive in the East. A new 3 km section has been added between Ashhurst and Raukawa Road, with plans to link this to the existing path over the next two years, making over 22 km of scenic tracks to explore alongside the river.

Palmerston North has a fairly comprehensive 65 km on-road bicycle lane network, particularly in high traffic areas, to make it safer for people to get around the city by bike. All local buses have racks for two cycles.

The cycle lane network has been criticised for a number of reasons. Motor traffic is often too fast, and there is no physical barrier between bicyclists and motorists. Most bicycle lanes in the city are marked out with parking spaces for motorist parking, making those lanes &#x27;pointless&#x27; and raising the risk of motorists opening car doors into the path of passing bicyclists.

Rebecca Oaten, the so-called &#x27;Helmet Lady&#x27; who campaigned nationwide in the late 1980s for a New Zealand bicycle helmet law, is from Palmerston North.

===Bus===
After much discussion about introducing a tramway system to Palmerston North, including an ambitious tram subway under the central railway station, a £60,000 loan was taken out in 1912 for a tramway scheme. Support, however, was wavering and there were disagreements within the council over the mode of the trams, one of the proposals was from battery trams similar to the ones that ran in Gisborne. Eventually, the decision to install tramways in Palmerston North was rescinded by a referendum and in 1920 the die was cast for a motorbus system to begin in Palmerston North. The first buses arrived in Palmerston North by late 1921.

Urban services are coordinated by Horizons Regional Council, through Masterton-based bus company, Tranzit. All bus services operates at least every 15-20 mins during peak-time and 30 mins off-peak and at weekends. Go cards were replaced by Bee Cards on 20 July 2020. The city&#x27;s urban bus services are unique in New Zealand in that rides are offered free to tertiary students. Palmerston North is the first city to operate all electric bus fleet in the country since February 2024.

The city has 11 interconnected bus routes serving the city&#x27;s suburbs via city centre with one outer services (route 114) to Ashhurst. Most of the lines (Except 121, 122, 123 routes) operates via the Main Street Bus Hub, which is adjacent to the city&#x27;s central Square. Bus services to Massey University and IPU exist for students. Tertiary students are offered free bus rides. This is funded by parking fees at the universities.

Bus services connect the city to several of the region&#x27;s other town such as Whanganui. Bus service to Whanganui run less often than the urban services.

Daily services run to the nearby towns of Linton, Feilding (311 bus via Palmerston North Airport), Foxton, Levin and Marton.

Inter-regional routes are operated by Intercity and Tranzit. Intercity&#x27;s routes run south (to Wellington), north (towards Auckland, via Whanganui, Rotorua and Taupō, or Napier) and east (to Masterton) from the bus terminal in The Square, Palmerston North.

Palmerston North Airport is located in the suburb of Milson, approximately north of the central business district. It is a regional gateway to the central North Island region. The airport has regular services to domestic destinations including Auckland, Christchurch, Hamilton and Nelson operated by Air New Zealand and Originair. International services operated out of Palmerston North between 1996 and 2008, with Freedom Air connecting Palmerston North with Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, the Gold Coast and Nadi.

The airport can be accessed by bus. 2 bus routes: 101 (Airport-Massey University) and 311 (Palmerston North-Feilding via Airport) connects the airport and city centre within 20 mins.

The airport is presently the operational base of the Massey University School of Aviation.
The airport is also a freight hub for Parcelair.

The runway at Palmerston North Airport, 07/25, is orientated true east–west, which requires aircraft on a long approach to runway 25 to cross the Tararua Range. On 9 June 1995, four people were killed when Ansett New Zealand Flight 703 crashed into the range while on approach to runway 25, after the Dash 8&#x27;s right landing gear jammed and the pilots failed to monitor the flight path while carrying out the alternate gear extension procedure.

===Rail===

Palmerston North is on the North Island Main Trunk Railway. There are two passenger trains run by KiwiRail: the weekday-only Capital Connection commuter train once a day to and from Wellington, and the Northern Explorer to and from Auckland and Wellington.

Until 1964, the railway ran through the city centre, with Palmerston North railway station in The Square. The station was moved, and the track diverted to the north by the &quot;Milson Deviation&quot; in 1959–1963; work on the deviation had started in 1926.

Near the current railway station, the North Island Main Trunk railway is joined by the Palmerston North - Gisborne Line, which runs through the Manawatū Gorge to Woodville and Hawke&#x27;s Bay. A connection to the Wairarapa Line is at Woodville.

==Education==
Palmerston North is considered &quot;the student city&quot; of New Zealand&#x27;s North Island. It is an important base for tertiary institutions. The home campuses of Massey University, Universal College of Learning (UCOL) and Institute of the Pacific United (IPU) are here. A large proportion of Palmerston North&#x27;s population consists of students attending these institutions or the various Papaioea Campuses of Te Wananga o Aotearoa during the student year.

;Tertiary Education Institutions
;Primary and Secondary Schools

Palmerston North has five state secondary schools: Palmerston North Boys&#x27; High School and Queen Elizabeth College in the north, Freyberg High School in the north-east, Palmerston North Girls High School in the south, and Awatapu College in the south-west. The city also has one state-integrated Catholic secondary school, St Peter&#x27;s College.

Palmerston North also has one special character secondary school: Cornerstone Christian School, Palmerston North

==Media==
The major daily newspaper in Palmerston North is the &quot;Manawatu Standard&quot;, while the weekly community newspaper is the &quot;Guardian&quot;.

Most radio stations are based outside the city, however some on the nationwide networks have studios in Palmerston North. Local radio stations include More FM (formerly &quot;2XS&quot;) featuring the popular &quot;Mike West in the Morning&quot; breakfast show from 6am-10am. Sister station The Breeze also has a local breakfast show from 6am-10am hosted by Burnzee. Radio Control is the local alternative student radio station, featuring local personality Abi Symes on &quot;The Continental Breakfast&quot; from 7 am to 9 am. Access Manawatu 999AM is a local community station and Kia Ora FM is the local Iwi station.

The city&#x27;s main television and FM radio transmitter is located atop Wharite Peak, northeast of the city centre. The first transmitter at the site was commissioned in 1963 to relay Wellington&#x27;s WNTV1 channel (now part of TVNZ 1). The current main transmitter was built in 1966.

<text>Sebastián Moyano y Cabrera, best known as Sebastián de Belalcázar (; c. 1490 – April 28, 1551) was a Spanish conquistador. Belalcázar, also written as Benalcázar. He is known as the founder of important early colonial cities in the northwestern part of South America; Quito in 1534 and Cali, Pasto and Popayán in 1537. Belalcázar led expeditions in present-day Ecuador and Colombia and died of natural causes after being sentenced to death in the port of Cartagena de Indias in 1551.

== Early life ==
He was born as Sebastián Moyano in the province of Córdoba, Spain, in either 1479 or 1480. He took the name Belalcázar as that was the name of the castle-town near to his birthplace in Córdoba. According to various sources, he may have left for the New World with Christopher Columbus as early as 1498.

== Conquests ==

He was an encomendero in Panama in 1522. He entered Nicaragua with Francisco Hernández de Córdoba in 1524 during the conquest of Nicaragua, and became the first mayor of the city of León in Nicaragua. He remained there until 1527, when he left for Honduras as a result of internal disputes among the Spanish governors. Briefly returning to León, he sailed to the coast of Peru, where he united with the expedition of Francisco Pizarro in 1532.
In 1534, while commanding the settlement of San Miguel for Francisco Pizarro, Sebastian set off to conquer Quito in modern-day Ecuador, without orders from Pizarro. Quito had been the northernmost city of the Inca Empire, but while Belalcázar defeated the Inca general Rumiñahui, the local population secretly carried the city treasure away. Belalcázar then founded the new city of Quito with Diego de Almagro and Baltasar Maldonado, honoring Pizarro by naming it in full &quot;San Francisco de Quito&quot;.


Moving northward into present day Colombia in search of &quot;El Dorado&quot; in 1535, he entered the Cauca River Valley, founding the southwestern Colombian cities of Santiago de Cali in 1536, and Pasto and Popayán (next in importance after Quito) in 1537. Crossing overland to the Magdalena River Valley, he entered the highlands of central Colombia, which had also been reached by Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada and Nikolaus Federmann, a German, in 1539. The three presented their dispute before King and Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. The King granted Belalcázar rule of the area with the title of governor of Popayán and the honorary title of adelantado in May 1540. As so often happened among the conquistadors, land squabbles developed again, this time between Belalcázar and Pascual de Andagoya (1495–1548), who also claimed the governorship of Popayán. Belalcázar successfully defended his lands, and took over some of Andagoya&#x27;s. He then intervened in a disagreement between supporters of the families of Pizarro and Almagro in Perú. In 1546, he ordered the execution of Jorge Robledo, who governed a neighboring province in yet another land-related vendetta. He was put to trial in absentia in 1550, convicted and condemned to death for the death of Robledo, and other offenses pertaining to his constant involvement in the various wars between other conquistadors. A victim of his own ambition, he died in 1551 before he could begin the voyage back to Spain to appeal the decision, in Cartagena, Colombia.

<text>The Nashville Network, usually referred to as TNN, was an American country music-oriented cable television network. Programming included music videos, taped concerts, movies, game shows, syndicated programs, and numerous talk shows. On September 25, 2000, after an attempt to attract younger viewers failed, TNN&#x27;s country music format was changed and the network was renamed The National Network, and eventually became Spike TV in 2003 and Paramount Network in 2018.

On November 1, 2012, the network was revived as a digital broadcast television network. However, this lasted only 11 months, and the channel changed its name to Heartland on October 9, 2013.

==History==

===Beginnings===
The Nashville Network was launched as a basic cable and satellite television network on March 7, 1983, operating from the now-defunct Opryland USA theme park near Nashville, Tennessee. Country Music Television (CMT), founded by Glenn D. Daniels, beat TNN&#x27;s launch by two days to become the first country music cable television network.

TNN was originally owned by WSM, Inc., a subsidiary of National Life and Accident Insurance Company that owned several broadcasting and tourism properties in Nashville and the traditional country radio and stage show &quot;The Grand Ole Opry,&quot; and initially focused on country music-related original programming. TNN&#x27;s flagship shows included &quot;Nashville Now&quot; and &quot;Grand Ole Opry Live&quot;, both of which were broadcast live from Opryland USA. During TNN&#x27;s first year of broadcasting, American General Corporation, parent company of NL&amp;AIC, put the network up for sale, along with the other NL&amp;AI properties, in an effort to focus on its core businesses.

===Gaylord ownership (1983–1997)===
The Gaylord Entertainment Company purchased TNN and the Opryland properties in the latter half of 1983. Much of TNN&#x27;s programming during the Gaylord era was originally produced by Opryland Productions, also owned by Gaylord Entertainment. Programming included variety shows, talk shows, game shows (such as &quot;Fandango&quot; and &quot;Top Card&quot;), outdoors shows, and lifestyle shows, all centered in some way around country music or Southern U.S. culture. Some of TNN&#x27;s popular on-air talent included Miss America 1983 Debra Maffett (TNN Country News), and local Nashville media personalities Ralph Emery, Dan Miller, Charlie Chase, Lorianne Crook and Gary Beaty, as well as established stars such as country music singer Bill Anderson and actresses Florence Henderson and Dinah Shore. TNN even created stars, such as wily professional fisherman Bill Dance. Grand Ole Opry singer and 1960s country star Bobby Lord, known for his skills as a sportsman and living in his native Florida, hosted the program &quot;Country Sportsman&quot;, featuring hunting and fishing excursions with various country stars. Inspired by ABC&#x27;s &quot;The American Sportsman&quot;, the TNN show was later renamed &quot;Celebrity Sportsman&quot; after ABC objected to the similarity to its program. One of the most popular shows that aired on the network during this time was a variety show hosted by the country music quartet The Statler Brothers.

In 1986, TNN started airing professional rodeos, beginning with the Mesquite Championship Rodeo. 

In 1991, Gaylord Entertainment purchased TNN&#x27;s chief competitor, CMT, and operated it in tandem with TNN. CMT continued to show country music videos exclusively throughout Gaylord&#x27;s ownership. Following the acquisition, TNN quickly phased out its music video blocks, while directing viewers to CMT for such fare.

In 1993, Emery began a short-lived retirement from broadcasting, and left &quot;Nashville Now&quot; in the process. Upon Emery&#x27;s exit, the show was merged with fellow TNN program &quot;Crook &amp; Chase&quot; and renamed &quot;Music City Tonight&quot; (hosted by Lorianne Crook and Charlie Chase). The same year, &quot;TNN Country News&quot; debuted and was hosted by Debra Maffett. The programming block &quot;TNN Outdoors&quot; debuted in 1993, and featured hunting and fishing shows, as well as PRCA rodeo and PBR bull riding. In 1996, Crook and Chase left the show to relaunch their eponymous program in daytime syndication; it would return exclusively to TNN in 1997. Meanwhile, &quot;Music City Tonight&quot; was again overhauled to more closely resemble its original &quot;Nashville Now&quot; format, but was rebranded as &quot;Prime Time Country&quot;. This version was originally hosted by actor Tom Wopat (of &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot; fame). He was later replaced with singer/songwriter Gary Chapman, who enjoyed relative success with the show until its cancellation in 1999 as part of the network&#x27;s change of focus.

TNN had two subdivisions focused on specialty programming: &quot;TNN Outdoors&quot; and &quot;TNN Motor Sports.&quot; In 1998, country singer Tracy Byrd became the on-air spokesman for the &quot;TNN Outdoors&quot; block, and stayed until 2000. &quot;TNN Motor Sports&quot; was responsible for production of all of the network&#x27;s auto racing and motorsports coverage. Regarding the latter, NASCAR races (including those of the then-Winston Cup Series, Busch Grand National Series, and Craftsman Truck Series) were the most prominently featured. However, races of other series such as IMSA, IRL, ASA, World of Outlaws, and NHRA were also showcased, as were motorcycle and monster truck racing. &quot;TNN Outdoors&quot; and &quot;TNN Motor Sports&quot; also were marketed as separate entities, selling a variety of merchandise and being branded onto video games such as &quot;TNN Bass Tournament of Champions&quot; and &quot;TNN Outdoors Bass Tournament &#x27;96&quot;.

In 1995, the network&#x27;s motorsports operations were moved into the industrial park located at Charlotte Motor Speedway in Concord, North Carolina, where TNN had purchased controlling interest in World Sports Enterprises, a motorsports production company founded by motorsports editor and commentator Ken Squier and Fred Rheinstein. Notable TNN racing personalities included Mike Joy, Steve Evans, Eli Gold, Buddy Baker, Neil Bonnett, Randy Pemberton, Ralph Sheheen, Dick Berggren, Matt Yocum, Brock Yates, Paul Page, Don Garlits, Gary Gerould, Army Armstrong, and Rick Benjamin. 

The outdoors and motorsports programs were so successful that, by the early 1990s, only those shows were seen on Sundays, with no musical programming.

===Westinghouse-CBS/Viacom ownership (1997–2000)===
Westinghouse Electric, who at the time owned the CBS network and had an existing relationship with TNN through its Group W division, purchased TNN and its sister network CMT outright in 1997 to form the CBS Cable division, along with a short-lived startup network entitled Eye On People.

Most of the original entertainment-oriented programming ceased production during this period, and the network began to rely more on &quot;TNN Outdoors&quot; and &quot;TNN Motor Sports&quot; for programming. The network&#x27;s ties to CBS allowed it to pick up Southern-themed CBS dramas from the 1980s such as &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot; and &quot;Dallas&quot;, and also allowed it to carry CBS Sports&#x27; overruns, which happened during a NASCAR Busch Series race at Texas Motor Speedway and also a PGA Tour event at Firestone Country Club. It also broadcast the 1998 Pepsi 400 on October 17, 1998, after CBS was unable to air it on the rescheduled date (from July 4, due to the 1998 Florida wildfires).

The late 1990s also saw the network&#x27;s first attempts to distance itself from its country music/rural lifestyle image and court a younger demographic, one more attractive to potential advertisers. In 1998, the network dropped its &quot;The Nashville Network&quot; moniker and shortened its official name to TNN, and ownership shifted to Viacom in 2000 after that company&#x27;s acquisition of Westinghouse&#x27;s successor, CBS Corporation. TNN subsequently moved from its original Nashville headquarters to New York City and was folded into Viacom&#x27;s MTV Networks division; sister network CMT, however, remained situated in Nashville and began to venture away from 24/7 music videos in favor of lifestyle programming.

1998 witnessed the premiere of &quot;RollerJam&quot;, which brought roller derby back to television for the first time in almost a decade. The next year, TNN began its relationship with professional wrestling, signing a three-year deal with Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW). &quot;ECW on TNN&quot; was the highest-rated show on TNN through 2000, despite limited advertising (which was a point of contention with ECW officials). &quot;ECW on TNN&quot; and &quot;RollerJam&quot; formed the core of the network&#x27;s &quot;Friday Night Thrill Zone&quot; program block, which was responsible for an increase in the network&#x27;s young male viewership on Friday nights.

===Format change===
In 2000, Viacom sensed redundancy among its TNN and CMT properties and, catalyzed by its acquisition of the rights to World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) programming, decided to refocus TNN. The network was renamed The National Network on September 25 (later The New TNN) and reformatted to compete with TNT, TBS, and USA Network by attracting viewers in the 18 to 49-year-old demographic. Prior to 2000, over half of TNN&#x27;s viewers were 55 years old and over. Only one-third of them were between the ages of 18 and 49, according to Nielsen Media Research.

Some of TNN&#x27;s programming included off-network sitcoms such as &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot;, &quot;WKRP in Cincinnati&quot;, &quot;The Wonder Years&quot; and &quot;Taxi&quot;, and the failed relaunch of &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot; as &quot;Ren &amp; Stimpy &quot;Adult Party Cartoon&quot;&quot;. Eventually, male-oriented shows such as &quot;Baywatch&quot;, &quot;Miami Vice&quot;, &quot;Monster Jam&quot;, &quot;Robot Wars&quot; and &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; were added to the network&#x27;s lineup as the demographic was changed to target &quot;young adult males&quot;. This change in the target demographic led The New TNN to be relaunched as Spike TV in August 2003, and then renamed to simply Spike in 2006.

In 2008, Spike was available in 96.1 million American homes, and the average age of its viewers was 42. The network featured re-runs of popular shows such as &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Unsolved Mysteries&quot;, &quot;Married... with Children&quot;, UFC events, and various original programs and movies. It was also the home of the professional wrestling organization Total Nonstop Action Wrestling&#x27;s flagship show &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot; until January 2015, when the show moved to Destination America.

Spike was rebranded as the Paramount Network on January 18, 2018.

===Revival===

On April 16, 2012, it was announced that Luken Communications and Jim Owens Entertainment would relaunch The Nashville Network as a digital broadcast television network on November 1, 2012. Jim Owens Entertainment, producer of the &quot;Crook &amp; Chase&quot; television program and the &quot;Crook &amp; Chase Top 40 Countdown&quot; radio show (among other programs), acquired The Nashville Network trademark, logo, and some archived programming.

In October 2013, the partnership between Jim Owens Entertainment and Luken Communications ended, and The Nashville Network name was changed to Heartland. The rebranded network continued to carry the same format and programming. As part of the split, Jim Owens Entertainment retained TNN&#x27;s branding.

On April 24, 2019, corporate TV station owner Gray Television announced a joint-venture country music broadcasting service with Opry Entertainment Group (the legal successor to TNN&#x27;s founding company, WSM, Inc.), which became Circle. The services would consist of a broadcast digital network and an OTT streaming platform. The joint venture would be based in Nashville under General Manager Drew Riefenberger. Gray would contribute distribution and marketing capabilities, multicast knowledge and affiliate all its TV stations&#x27; subchannels with the new service. This represents the third attempt to revive the pre-2000 concept of TNN, but without the branding due to the TNN trademark now owned by Jim Owens Entertainment. Owens died on March 4, 2022.

<text>A triptych ( ) is a work of art (usually a panel painting) that is divided into three sections, or three carved panels that are hinged together and can be folded shut or displayed open. It is therefore a type of polyptych, the term for all multi-panel works. The middle panel is typically the largest and it is flanked by two smaller related works, although there are triptychs of equal-sized panels. The form can also be used for pendant jewelry.

Beyond its association with art, the term is sometimes used more generally to connote anything with three parts, particularly if integrated into a single unit.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;triptych&quot; was formed in English by compounding the prefix &quot;tri-&quot; with the word &quot;diptych&quot;. &quot;Diptych&quot; is borrowed from the Latin , which itself is derived from the Late Greek () . is the neuter plural of () .

== In art ==

The triptych form appears in early Christian art, and was a popular standard format for altar paintings from the Middle Ages onwards. Its geographical range was from the eastern Byzantine churches to the Celtic churches in the west. During the Byzantine period, triptychs were often used for private devotional use, along with other relics such as icons. Renaissance painters such as Hans Memling and Hieronymus Bosch used the form. Sculptors also used it. Triptych forms also allow ease of transport.

From the Gothic period onward, both in Europe and elsewhere, altarpieces in churches and cathedrals were often in triptych form. One such cathedral with an altarpiece triptych is Llandaff Cathedral. The Cathedral of Our Lady in Antwerp, Belgium, contains two examples by Rubens, and Notre Dame de Paris is another example of the use of triptych in architecture. The form is echoed by the structure of many ecclesiastical stained glass windows.

The triptych form&#x27;s transportability was exploited during World War Two when a private citizens&#x27; committee in the United States commissioned painters and sculptors to create portable three-panel hinged altarpieces for use by Christian and Jewish U.S. troops for religious services. By the end of the war, 70 artists had created 460 triptychs. Among the most prolific were Violet Oakley, Nina Barr Wheeler, and Hildreth Meiere.

The triptych format has been used in non-Christian faiths, including, Judaism, Islam, and Buddhism. For example: the triptych &quot;Hilje-j-Sherif&quot; displayed at the National Museum of Oriental Art, Rome, Italy, and a page of the &quot;Qur&#x27;an&quot; at the Museum of Turkish and Islamic Arts in Istanbul, Turkey, exemplify Ottoman religious art adapting the motif. Likewise, Tibetan Buddhists have used it in traditional altars.

Although strongly identified as a religious altarpiece form, triptychs outside that context have been created, some of the best-known examples being works by Max Beckmann and Francis Bacon. When Bacon&#x27;s 1969 triptych, &quot;Three Studies of Lucian Freud&quot;, was sold in 2013 for $142.4 million, it was the highest price ever paid for an artwork at auction at that time. That record was broken in May 2015 by $179.4 million for Pablo Picasso&#x27;s 1955 painting &quot;Les Femmes d’Alger&quot;.

== In photography ==
A photographic triptych is a common style used in modern commercial artwork. The photographs are usually arranged with a plain border between them. The work may consist of separate images that are variants on a theme, or may be one larger image split into three.

== Examples ==

* Stefaneschi Triptych by Giotto, c. 1330
* &quot;Annunciation with St. Margaret and St. Ansanus&quot; by Simone Martini, 1333
* The Mérode Altarpiece by Robert Campin, late 1420&#x27;s
* &quot;The Garden of Earthly Delights&quot;, &quot;Triptych of the Temptation of St. Anthony&quot; and &quot;The Haywain Triptych&quot; by Hieronymus Bosch
* The Portinari Altarpiece by Hugo van der Goes, c. 1475
* The Buhl Altarpiece, c. 1495
* &quot;The Raising of the Cross&quot; by Peter Paul Rubens, 1610 or 1611
* &quot;The Aino Myth&quot; triptych by Akseli Gallen-Kallela, 1891
* &quot;The Pioneer&quot; by Frederick McCubbin, 1904
* &quot;Departure&quot; by Max Beckmann, 1932–33
* &quot;Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion&quot; by Francis Bacon, 1944

<text>Moissanite () is naturally occurring silicon carbide and its various crystalline polymorphs. It has the chemical formula SiC and is a rare mineral, discovered by the French chemist Henri Moissan in 1893. Silicon carbide or moissanite is useful for commercial and industrial applications due to its hardness, optical properties and thermal conductivity.

== Background ==
The mineral moissanite was discovered by Henri Moissan while examining rock samples from what is now called Meteor Crater located near Canyon Diablo, Arizona, in 1893. At first, he mistakenly identified the crystals as diamonds, but in 1904 he identified the crystals as silicon carbide. Artificial silicon carbide had been synthesized in the lab by Edward G. Acheson in 1891, just two years before Moissan&#x27;s discovery.

The mineral form of silicon carbide was named in honor of Moissan later on in his life.

== Geological occurrence ==
In its natural form, moissanite remains very rare. Until the 1950s, no other source for moissanite other than as presolar grains in carbonaceous chondrite meteorites had been encountered. Then, in 1958, moissanite was found in the upper mantle Green River Formation in Wyoming and, the following year, as inclusions in the ultramafic rock kimberlite from a diamond mine in Yakutia in the Russian Far East. Yet the existence of moissanite in nature was questioned as late as 1986 by the American geologist Charles Milton.

Discoveries show that it occurs naturally as inclusions in diamonds, xenoliths, and such other ultramafic rock such as lamproite.

==Meteorites==
Analysis of silicon carbide grains found in the Murchison meteorite has revealed anomalous isotopic ratios of carbon and silicon, indicating an extraterrestrial origin from outside the Solar System. 99% of these silicon carbide grains originate around carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch stars. Silicon carbide is commonly found around these stars, as deduced from their infrared spectra. The discovery of silicon carbide in the Canyon Diablo meteorite and other places was delayed for a long time as carborundum (SiC) contamination had occurred from man-made abrasive tools.

== Physical properties ==

The crystalline structure is held together with strong covalent bonding similar to diamonds, that allows moissanite to withstand high pressures up to 52.1 gigapascals. Colors vary widely and are graded from D to K range on the diamond color grading scale.

== Sources ==
All applications of silicon carbide today use synthetic material, as the natural material is very scarce.

The idea that a silicon-carbon bond might exist in nature was first proposed by the Swedish chemist Jöns Jacob Berzelius as early as 1824 (Berzelius 1824). In 1891, Edward Goodrich Acheson produced viable minerals that could substitute for diamond as an abrasive and cutting material. This was possible, as moissanite is one of the hardest substances known, with a hardness just below that of diamond and comparable with those of cubic boron nitride and boron. Pure synthetic moissanite can also be made from thermal decomposition of the preceramic polymer poly(methylsilyne), requiring no binding matrix, e.g., cobalt metal powder.

Single-crystalline silicon carbide, in certain forms, has been used for the fabrication of high-performance semiconductor devices. As natural sources of silicon carbide are rare, and only certain atomic arrangements are useful for gemological applications, North Carolina–based Cree Research, Inc., founded in 1987, developed a commercial process for producing large single crystals of silicon carbide. Cree is the world leader in the growth of single crystal silicon carbide, mostly for electronics use.

In 1995 C3 Inc., a company helmed by Charles Eric Hunter, formed Charles &amp; Colvard to market gem quality moissanite. Charles &amp; Colvard was the first company to produce and sell synthetic moissanite under U.S. patent US5723391 A, first filed by C3 Inc. in North Carolina.

== Applications ==


Moissanite was introduced to the jewelry market as a diamond alternative in 1998 after Charles &amp; Colvard (formerly known as C3 Inc.) received patents to create and market lab-grown silicon carbide gemstones, becoming the first firm to do so. By 2018 all patents on the original process world-wide had expired. Charles &amp; Colvard currently makes and distributes moissanite jewelry and loose gems under the trademarks &quot;Forever One&quot;, &quot;Forever Brilliant&quot;, and &quot;Forever Classic&quot;. Other manufacturers market silicon carbide gemstones under trademarked names such as &quot;Amora&quot;.

On the Mohs scale of mineral hardness (with diamond as the upper extreme, 10) moissanite is rated as 9.5. As a diamond alternative, Moissanite has some optical properties exceeding those of diamond. It is marketed as a lower price alternative to diamond that does not involve the expensive mining practices used for the extraction of natural diamonds. As some of its properties are quite similar to diamond, moissanite may be used as counterfeit diamond. Testing equipment based on measuring thermal conductivity in particular may give results similar to diamond. In contrast to diamond, moissanite exhibits a thermochromism, such that heating it gradually will cause it to temporarily change color, starting at around . A more practical test is a measurement of electrical conductivity, which will show higher values for moissanite. Moissanite is birefringent (i.e., light sent through the material splits into separate beams that depend on the source polarization), which can be easily seen, and diamond is not.

Because of its hardness, it can be used in high-pressure experiments, as a replacement for diamond (see diamond anvil cell). Since large diamonds are usually too expensive to be used as anvils, moissanite is more often used in large-volume experiments. Synthetic moissanite is also interesting for electronic and thermal applications because its thermal conductivity is similar to that of diamonds. High power silicon carbide electronic devices are expected to find use in the design of protection circuits used for motors, actuators, and energy storage or pulse power systems. It also exhibits thermoluminescence, making it useful in radiation dosimetry.

<doc id="314154" wikidata="Q127375" url="?curid=314154" title="Gardnerella vaginalis">
<text>Gardnerella vaginalis is a species of Gram-variable-staining facultative anaerobic bacteria. The organisms are small (1.0–1.5 μm in diameter) non-spore-forming, nonmotile coccobacilli.

Once classified as &quot;Haemophilus vaginalis&quot; and afterwards as &quot;Corynebacterium vaginalis&quot;, &quot;G. vaginalis&quot; grows as small, circular, convex, gray colonies on chocolate agar; it also grows on agar. A selective medium for &quot;G. vaginalis&quot; is colistin-oxolinic acid blood agar.

==Clinical significance==
&quot;G. vaginalis&quot; is a facultatively anaerobic Gram-variable rod that is involved, together with many other bacteria, mostly anaerobic, in bacterial vaginosis (BV) in some women as a result of a disruption in the normal vaginal microflora. The resident facultative anaerobic &quot;Lactobacillus&quot; population in the vagina is responsible for the acidic environment. Once the anaerobes have supplanted the normal vaginal bacteria, prescription antibiotics with anaerobic coverage may have to be given to re-establish the equilibrium of the ecosystem. &quot;G. vaginalis &quot; is not considered the sole cause of the bacterial vaginosis, but a signal organism of the altered microbial ecology associated with overgrowth of many bacterial species.

While typically isolated in genital cultures, it may also be detected in other samples from blood, urine, and the pharynx. Although &quot;G. vaginalis&quot; is a major species present in bacterial vaginosis, it can also be isolated from women without any signs or symptoms of infection.

It has a Gram-positive cell wall, but, because the cell wall is so thin, it can appear either Gram-positive or Gram-negative under the microscope. It is associated microscopically with clue cells, which are epithelial cells covered in bacteria.

&quot;G. vaginalis&quot; produces a pore-forming toxin, vaginolysin, which affects only human cells.

Protease and sialidase enzyme activities frequently accompany &quot;G. vaginalis&quot;.

== Diagnosis ==

A variety of diagnosis techniques are currently available for identifying &quot;Gardnerella vaginalis&quot; such as the OSOM BV Blue assay, FemExam cards and nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), resulting in the determination of ongoing BV. The OSOM BV Blue Assay is a chromogenic point-of-care test which can measure sialidase levels in vaginal fluids. As sialidases are produced by bacteria such as &quot;Gardnerella&quot; and &quot;Bacteroides&quot; species, similar tests are useful as diagnostic techniques. FemExam, besides detecting vaginal fluid pH and trimethylamine presence, is able to measure proline iminopeptidase activity of &quot;G. vaginalis&quot;. Finally, the nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), such as PCR, are commonly used detection techniques due to their ability to detect as little as one organism in a sample, providing a closer look to &quot;Gardnerella vaginalis&quot; and BV status.

== Treatment ==
Bacterial vaginosis is commonly treated with topical or oral antibiotics such as metronidazole or clindamycin, which work by targeting &quot;G. vaginalis&quot; and possibly other anaerobic bacteria. Additionally, a study published in the Journal of Clinical Microbiology described the effectiveness of clindamycin in inhibiting the growth of &quot;G. vaginalis&quot; in vitro; it was found that clindamycin was able to inhibit the growth of the organism at concentrations as low as 0.25 μg/mL. However, due to high recurrence rates, alternative treatment options for BV are still in development. Vaginal boric acid has been shown to be effective against BV, due to its ability to remove BV-specific biofilms and enhance eradication of &quot;G. vaginalis&quot; and other potential bacterial pathogens, resulting in reduced recurrence of symptomatic BV. Its mechanism of action is still not fully understood, but its effects on inhibition of bacterial enzymes, biofilm formation and the permeability of bacterial cell walls, potentially make it a useful agent for recurrent BV for further study.

==Symptoms==
&quot;G. vaginalis&quot; is associated with bacterial vaginosis, which may be asymptomatic, or may have symptoms including vaginal discharge, vaginal irritation, and a &quot;fish-like&quot; odor. In the amine whiff test, 10% KOH is added to the discharge; a positive result is indicated if a fishy smell is produced. This and other tests can be used to distinguish between vaginal symptoms related to &quot;G. vaginalis&quot; and those caused by other organisms, such as &quot;Trichomonas&quot; and &quot;Candida albicans&quot;, which are similar and may require different treatment. &quot;Trichomonas vaginalis&quot; and &quot;G. vaginalis&quot; have similar clinical presentations and can cause a frothy gray or yellow-green vaginal discharge, pruritus, and produce a positive &quot;whiff-test&quot;. The two can be distinguished using a wet-mount slide, where a swab of the vaginal epithelium is diluted and then placed onto a slide for observation under a microscope. &quot;Gardnerella&quot; reveals a classic &quot;clue cell&quot; under the microscope, showing bacteria adhering to the surface of squamous epithelial cells.

== History ==
&quot;Gardnerella vaginalis&quot; was described in 1953 by Sidney Leopold as a nonmotile, nonencapsulated, pleomorphic gram-negative rod from the vaginas of women who showed symptoms of cervicitis. As though it&#x27;s been suggested that the organism was related to the genus Haemophilus due to its morphology and growth conditions, the relation between this organism and vaginitis was still an unknown. It was in 1955, when Gardner and Dukes described the microorganism in relation to bacterial vaginosis (BV). Multiple risk factors associated with the development of BV have been identified. However, its exact etiology remains elusive due to its complexity.

<doc id="314162" wikidata="Q1364657" url="?curid=314162" title="Pretty Things">
<text>Pretty Things were an English rock band formed in September 1963 in Sidcup, Kent, taking their name from Bo Diddley&#x27;s 1955 song &quot;Pretty Thing&quot;, and active in their first incarnation until 1971. They released five studio albums, including the debut &quot;The Pretty Things&quot; (UK Albums Chart #6) and &quot;S. F. Sorrow&quot; (the first rock opera), four EPs and 15 UK singles, including the Top 20 UK Singles Chart &quot;Don&#x27;t Bring Me Down&quot; and &quot;Honey I Need&quot;. They reformed later in 1971 and continued through to 1976 issuing three more studio albums, and reformed once again from 1979 to 2020 releasing another five studio albums finalising with &quot;Bare as Bone, Bright as Blood&quot;.

The group were formed by vocalist Phil May, who was an ever-present until his death in 2020, and guitarist Dick Taylor, who left before the end of their first incarnation but rejoined for the entirety of the third, with John Stax (bass), Brian Pendleton (guitar) and Pete Kitley who was replaced on drums by Viv Prince before any recording began. There have been many personnel changes with Peter Tolson (guitar), Jon Povey (keyboards) and Skip Alan (drums) being involved in all three incarnations, while bassist Wally Waller was involved in the first and third.

Pretty Things recorded stock music for film soundtracks which were issued as the &quot;Electric Banana&quot; series of albums, and collaborated with other artists and bands in the 1990s, such as Pretty Things &amp; the Yardbird Blues Band, and Pretty Things &#x27;N Mates.

==History==
===1962–1964: Formation===
Pretty Things were preceded by Little Boy Blue and the Blue Boys, which consisted of Dick Taylor, fellow Sidcup Art College student Keith Richards, and Mick Jagger, among others. When Brian Jones was recruiting for his own band, all three joined Brian and Ian Stewart and were dubbed &quot;Rollin&#x27; Stones&quot; by Jones in June 1962. Because there were too many guitar players in the band, Taylor switched to bass. He quit the Stones five months later, when he was accepted at the Central School of Art and Design in London. Phil May, another Sidcup student, convinced him to form a new band. Taylor was once again playing guitar, with May singing and playing harmonica. They recruited John Stax on bass and harmonica, Brian Pendleton on rhythm guitar, and Pete Kitley on drums. Kitley was soon replaced by Viv Andrews, also known as Viv Broughton.

Bryan Morrison, a fellow student at the Art College where May and Taylor studied, was recruited as their manager. Morrison was to manage them for the rest of the 1960s, building his own Bryan Morrison Agency. This agency represented Pink Floyd among many other bands. Forming a partnership with songwriter Jimmy Duncan, he got the Pretty Things a recording contract with Fontana Records in early 1964. At this point, Viv Andrews was replaced by Viv Prince, a more experienced drummer who had played with Carter-Lewis and the Southerners.

===1964–1966: Early career===

Pretty Things&#x27; first three singles appeared in the UK Singles Chart in 1964 and 1965: &quot;Rosalyn&quot; No. 41, &quot;Don&#x27;t Bring Me Down&quot; No. 10, and the self-penned &quot;Honey I Need&quot; at No. 13. They never had a hit in the United States, but had considerable success in their native United Kingdom and in Australia, New Zealand, Germany and the Netherlands. Their appearance and behaviour were provocative, with May claiming to have the longest hair in the UK and Prince often causing chaos wherever he went.

The band later blamed their lack of success in the US on the fact their management opted for a tour of the Southern Hemisphere in July–August 1965. During their two weeks in New Zealand, they caused so much outrage in the media that the New Zealand Parliament addressed the issue of granting entry permits to musicians such as the Pretty Things. The band was never actually banned from re-entering New Zealand, contrary to what can be read in some sources.

The first of what would be many personnel changes over the years also began, with Prince, whose wild antics had become too much for the other members to endure, being the first to go in November 1965. He was replaced by Skip Alan. In early 1966, the band made a short film &quot;The Pretty Things on Film&quot;; it featured live footage and a music video prototype for &quot;Can&#x27;t Stand the Pain&quot;, which also featured their manager, Morrison. Rarely screened at the time, the film can be found as a bonus multimedia item on the Snapper CD re-issue of &quot;Get the Picture&quot;. 1966 saw the R&amp;B scene fall into decline and the Pretty Things began moving away, flirting with soul music. In mid-1966, they made the UK Singles Chart for the final time with a cover of the Kinks song &quot;A House in the Country&quot;. In December 1966 came the single &quot;Progress&quot;, where the band were joined by a brass section.

Pendleton left in December 1966 and was replaced on stage by Billy Harrison from Them. Stax followed in January 1967. Jon Povey and Wally Waller, both former Fenmen from Bern Elliott and the Fenmen, joined and made the band a five-piece once again.

===1967–1971: &quot;S. F. Sorrow&quot; and &quot;Parachute&quot;===
Their final album for Fontana Records was a contractual obligation produced by Steve Rowland and the subject of controversy, since &quot;Emotions&quot; was laden with brass and string arrangements arranged by Reg Tilsley. EMI producer Norman Smith expressed interest in working with them and at the end of September 1967, the Pretty Things signed to EMI&#x27;s Columbia label. In November 1967 they released &quot;Defecting Grey&quot;, a psychedelic effort that failed to sell. This was followed three months later by a double A-side single, &quot;Talking About the Good Times&quot; / &quot;Walking Through My Dreams&quot;.

That single marked the beginning of sessions for the &quot;S. F. Sorrow&quot; album. Released in December 1968, it was the first rock opera, preceding the release of the Who&#x27;s &quot;Tommy&quot; in May 1969. It was recorded between December 1967 and September 1968 at the Abbey Road Studios, while Pink Floyd were working on &quot;A Saucerful of Secrets&quot; (also produced by Norman Smith) and the Beatles worked on their 1968 self-titled album. In March 1968, drummer Skip Alan left the group. Twink replaced him to help the band to complete the album.

In March 1969, the British music magazine &quot;NME&quot; reported that Motown Records vice-president Barney Ales had visited London to sign the Pretty Things as the U.S. label&#x27;s first British act. &quot;S. F. Sorrow&quot; was commercially unsuccessful, with no immediate release in the United States. The work received only modest support from EMI, and its depressing narrative probably did not help sales. The American release, on Motown&#x27;s Rare Earth Records label, came out more than a year late, leading to the impression that &quot;S. F. Sorrow&quot; was merely following the trend set by the Who&#x27;s &quot;Tommy&quot;.

1969 saw the band feeling disillusioned by the failure of &quot;S. F. Sorrow&quot; and that June, Taylor left the group. Pretty Things recruited guitarist Victor Unitt from the Edgar Broughton Band to replace Taylor. During the summer of 1969, they recorded an album for a young French millionaire Philippe DeBarge, which was intended only to be circulated among his social circle. The acetate has since been bootlegged. In 2010, it was picked up by Mike Stax, owner of 1960s music magazine &quot;Ugly Things&quot;. He unearthed one of the two acetates and had it mixed and mastered and then as a &quot;piece de resistance&quot;, had the classic Pretty Things line-up, which Dick Taylor had just left at the time of the recording of the tracks with DeBarge, record a song entitled &quot;Monsieur Rock&quot; (&quot;Ballad of Philippe&quot;) a bonus track for this release on Ugly Things UTCD-2207.

Twink left at the end of 1969 to form the Pink Fairies. Skip Alan returned to the drumstool in time for the band&#x27;s return to Abbey Road to start work on &quot;Parachute&quot;, which kept the psychedelic sound. Shortly before the release of &quot;Parachute&quot;, Unitt left to rejoin the Edgar Broughton Band and was replaced by Pete Tolson, former guitarist for Eire Apparent. Despite much stage work and acclaim, their records were still failing to sell at all well. With Tolson, they released two singles before disbanding in mid-1971.

During the late 1960s, the group made some extra money by recording for music library company DeWolfe. Some of these songs ended up in low-budget films including &quot;What&#x27;s Good for the Goose&quot; (1969) (which the band also appeared in), &quot;The Haunted House of Horror&quot; (1969), &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; (1978), and a couple of softcore porn films. Not intended for official release, these songs were later compiled on a number of records and released under the alias Electric Banana: &quot;Electric Banana&quot; (1967), &quot;More Electric Banana&quot; (1968), &quot;Even More Electric Banana&quot; (1969), &quot;Hot Licks&quot; (1970), and &quot;Return of the Electric Banana&quot; (1978). The initial releases featured one side of vocal and one side of instrumental tracks. Subsequent releases of these albums generally keep the true identity of the band secret.

===1970s===
Pretty Things reformed in late 1971. Wally Waller, who had become assistant producer at EMI, was replaced by Stuart Brooks (born January 1951, Hertfordshire) (ex-Black Cat Bones). They signed with Warner Bros. Records and released &quot;Freeway Madness&quot; at the end of 1972. Although Waller was no longer a member of the band, he produced the album under a pseudonym and contributed lead vocals to the song &quot;Over the Moon&quot;. The album was commercially unsuccessful.

In 1973, David Bowie recorded two of their songs, &quot;Rosalyn&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Bring Me Down&quot;, on his album &quot;Pin Ups&quot;. Around this time, the band recruited a sixth member, Gordon John Edwards (born 26 December 1946, Southport, Lancashire). A versatile musician, Edwards could play the guitar as well as the keyboards, and he also sang.

In 1974, Pretty Things were one of the first acts signed by Swan Song Records, the label created by Led Zeppelin, and Peter Grant became their manager. Stuart Brooks left the band before the recording of their first album for Swan Song, &quot;Silk Torpedo&quot;. The bass lines on the album were recorded by guitarist Pete Tolson before the arrival of a new bass player, Jack Green, who only contributed backing vocals.

&quot;Silk Torpedo&quot; was the first British album release on Zeppelin&#x27;s own label Swan Song. It charted in the lower reaches of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, for the first time in the band&#x27;s history. Jimmy Page later remarked:

During the recording of &quot;Savage Eye&quot;, the follow-up to &quot;Silk Torpedo&quot;, tensions arose between the members of the band, with May finding himself at odds with newcomers Edwards and Green over the band direction and writing credits . After the release of &quot;Savage Eye&quot;, May did not show up at a major London gig, and he was fired soon after. Alan, Edwards, Green and Tolson tried to form a new band called Metropolis, but Swan Song was not interested in offering them a contract and they went their separate ways. Edwards briefly joined the Kinks for their &quot;Misfits&quot; tour, while Green became a member of Rainbow for a few weeks before launching a solo career.

===1980s===

The 1967 line-up of Alan, May, Povey, Taylor and Waller reformed in 1978 for a one-off gig in the Netherlands. Adding Pete Tolson, the six-piece recorded &quot;Cross Talk&quot; for Warner Bros. Records in 1980. The new wave sounds did not improve their sales figures, and Pretty Things split up again in 1981, after an appearance in the horror film &quot;The Monster Club&quot; (1981).

Throughout the 1980s, May and Taylor kept the band&#x27;s name alive with a rotating cast of supporting musicians, touring extensively in continental Europe, especially Germany where they retained a loyal fanbase. In 1987, they released &quot;Out of the Island&quot;, a live-in-the-studio album consisting of new recordings of songs from their catalogue which was their first CD release. They did a successful European blues tour in late 1990 with Stan Webb&#x27;s Chicken Shack and Luther Allison. This outfit included drummer Hans Waterman (formerly of Dutch rock group Solution), bassist Roelf ter Velt and guitarist/keyboardist Barkley McKay (Waco Brothers, Pine Valley Cosmonauts, Jon Langford, the Mekons) on guitar. This line-up regularly toured the European mainland until late 1994.

===1990s===

May and Taylor, together with former Yardbirds drummer Jim McCarty, recorded two albums in Chicago as Pretty Things/Yardbird Blues Band. They were &quot;The Chicago Blues Tapes 1991&quot; and &quot;Wine, Women, Whiskey&quot;, both produced by George Paulus. May and Taylor, along with Barkley McKay (credited as Barclay Mackay), also recorded one album with members of the Inmates and Matthew Fisher of Procol Harum under the name Pretty Things n&#x27; Mates. It was released in 1994 as &quot;A Whiter Shade of Dirty Water&quot; (reissued as &quot;Rockin&#x27; the Garage&quot;).

The early 1990s were taken up with a battle against EMI. This was over unpaid royalties stemming back to a deal EMI set up with Motown subsidiary Rare Earth in 1968. The band never received any royalties from Rare Earth nor had received any monies from EMI for many years. The band won the legal case, the result being that in 1993 EMI gave them back all their master tapes, copyrights and an undisclosed sum of money as settlement. This dispute is covered in detail in Alan Lakey’s biography Growing Old Disgracefully. On friendly terms again, the 1967 line-up decided to return with the addition of Pete Tolson, Taylor&#x27;s replacement in 1970, just like they had done in 1980 on &quot;Cross Talk&quot;. After much rehearsal, Tolson grew disillusioned and quit with Frank Holland taking Tolson&#x27;s place.

Their label, Snapper Music, issued remastered CDs with many bonus tracks, plus a DVD of the September 1998 live netcast re-recording of &quot;S. F. Sorrow&quot; at Abbey Road Studios, with David Gilmour and Arthur Brown as guest players. They played a tour of the U.S. for the first time in decades.

===2000s to present===

Original rhythm guitarist Brian Pendleton died of lung cancer on 16 May 2001 in Maidstone. Their ex-guitarist and keyboard player Gordon John Edwards, who also played for the Kinks in the late 1970s, died on 28 February 2003 due to depression-related suicide.

In 1999, they released the studio album &quot;Rage Before Beauty&quot; and in the early 2000s, they released several compilation albums, a live album and DVD. In 2003, Alan Lakey&#x27;s biography of the band, &quot;Growing Old Disgracefully&quot;, was published by Firefly. The book dealt with the long and involved history of the band, and paid special attention to the legal proceedings issued against EMI in the 1990s.

Skip Alan suffered heart problems in 2001 restricting his commitment to the band, with Mark St. John (real name Anthony Ibbotsen and not to be confused with former KISS / White Tiger guitarist of the same name) deputising on the drums as required. In mid-2007, the Pretty Things released their eleventh studio album &quot;Balboa Island&quot; on Zoho Roots. Disillusionment with manager St John meant Waller and Povey were unable to continue with the band. A new line-up emerged around May and Taylor with Frank Holland on guitar, Jack Greenwood on drums and George Woosey on bass.

In June 2009, May, Taylor, Waller, Povey and Alan reunited to receive the &quot;Heroes&quot; award at the annual &quot;Mojo&quot; Awards ceremony. Waller, Povey, Alan and Tolson reunited in the middle of 2010 to re-record &quot;Parachute&quot;, to commemorate its 40th anniversary. Using the byline &#x27;The XPTs&#x27;, the album was released by Esoteric Recordings on 30 April 2012. Tolson died in April 2016.

On 30 April 2012, a re-imagining of &quot;S. F. Sorrow&quot;, entitled &quot;Sorrow&#x27;s Children&quot; and featuring covers by contemporary bands of each track, was released on Fruits de Mer Records, only on vinyl and in a limited edition of 700. The album included an interview with May and Taylor, and had a live version of &quot;Loneliest Person&quot;. The latter was recorded at their gig at London&#x27;s 100 Club in December 2010, at which they played the whole of their first album.

In 2012, the band returned to New Zealand for the first time since the bad publicity of 1965. They also toured Australia and were reunited with original bass player, John Stax, for their Melbourne shows. This was the first time May, Taylor and Stax had played together since 1967.

In 2013 the Pretty Things celebrated their 50th Anniversary Tour with dates in the UK and Europe. The band&#x27;s studio album, &quot;The Sweet Pretty Things (Are in Bed Now, of Course...)&quot;, was released on 10 July 2015. This is the first album recorded with touring members Greenwood and Woosey.

In 2018, the band announced that they were splitting up at the end of the year. All dates throughout 2018 were billed as part of a farewell tour. The group (May and Taylor accompanied by Woosey, Holland and Greenwood) recorded a live session for BBC Radio 6 Music show Marc Riley on 17 July 2018 at Maida Vale Studios performing versions of &quot;Same Sun&quot;, &quot;You Can&#x27;t Judge A Book&quot;, &quot;She Says Good Morning&quot;, &quot;Mister Evasion&quot; and &quot;Rosalind&quot;.

Phil May died, aged 75, on 15 May 2020 following complications after hip surgery.

22 May 2020 saw the release of two tracks from an upcoming &quot;stripped back, acoustic-driven&quot; album recorded by May, Taylor, and Mark St. John before May&#x27;s death. The album, &quot;Bare as Bone, Bright as Blood&quot;, was released in September 2020.

On 9 May 2023, Jon Povey died at the age of 80.

==Musical style==

Influenced by Bo Diddley, Pretty Things were a key part of London&#x27;s blues rock scene and a beat, R&amp;B, rock and roll and garage rock band. From 1967 to 1975, the band pursued a progressive rock and psychedelia sound. Academics Paul Hegarty and Martin Halliwell argued that the Pretty Things were &quot;not merely as precursors of prog but as essential developments of progressiveness in its early days&quot;. &quot;PopMatters&quot; says that after their &quot;S. F. Sorrow&quot; album, Pretty Things were mainly a prog/hard rock band. They were also categorized as yacht rock.

<text>The Bayreuth Festival () is a music festival held annually in Bayreuth, Germany, at which performances of stage works by the 19th-century German composer Richard Wagner are presented. Wagner himself conceived and promoted the idea of a special festival to showcase his own works, in particular his monumental cycle and &quot;Parsifal&quot;.

Performances take place in a specially designed theatre, the Bayreuth Festspielhaus. Wagner personally supervised the design and construction of the theatre, which contained many architectural innovations to accommodate the huge orchestras for which Wagner wrote as well as the composer&#x27;s particular vision about the staging of his works. The Festival has become a pilgrimage destination for Wagnerians and classical-music enthusiasts.

== Origins ==
The origins of the Festival itself lie rooted in Richard Wagner&#x27;s interest in establishing his financial independence. A souring of the relationship with his patron, Ludwig II of Bavaria, led to his expulsion from Munich, where he had originally intended to launch the festival. Wagner next considered Nuremberg, which would have reinforced the thematic significance of works such as &quot;Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg&quot;. On the advice of Hans Richter, however, the focus fell upon Bayreuth which enjoyed three distinct advantages.

First, the town boasted a splendid venue: the Markgräfliches Opernhaus built for Margrave Frederick and his wife, Friederike Sophie Wilhelmine (sister of Frederick the Great) in 1747. With its ample capacity and strong acoustics, the opera house seemed a good match for Wagner&#x27;s vision. Second, the town of Bayreuth was located outside those regions where Wagner no longer owned the rights to the performance of his own works, which he had sold off in 1864 in order to alleviate pressing financial concerns. Finally, the town had no cultural life that could offer competition to Wagner&#x27;s own artistic dominance. The Festival, once launched, would be the dominant feature of Bayreuth&#x27;s cultural landscape. In addition, &quot;Richard Wagner did not want his works interpreted amid the hustle and noise or the distractions of a large city; he sought a place remote from the usual theatrical world where it was so quiet so that the hearers could concentrate their whole attention on the work offered, and could in the pauses refresh themselves in natural surroundings.&quot;

In April 1870, Wagner and his wife Cosima visited Bayreuth. On inspection, the opera house proved to be inadequate. It was built to accommodate the baroque orchestras of the 18th century and was therefore unsuited for the complex stagings and large orchestras that Wagner&#x27;s later stage works required. Nonetheless, the burgermeisters proved open to assisting Wagner with the construction of an entirely new theatre, and the Festival was planned to launch in 1873. After a fruitless meeting in the spring of 1871 with the German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck to obtain funds, Wagner embarked on a fundraising tour across Germany, including Leipzig and Frankfurt.

An initial public subscription proved disappointing until Wagner, at the suggestion of his friend and admirer Emil Heckel, launched a number of Wagner Societies to increase participation in the Festival&#x27;s subscription. Societies were established in Leipzig, Berlin, Vienna and other places.

Despite making direct appeals based on Wagner&#x27;s role as a composer of the new German Reich, the Societies and other fundraising channels were well short of the needed sum by the end of 1872. Wagner made another appeal to Bismarck in August 1873 and was again denied.

Desperate, Wagner turned to his former patron, Ludwig II, who reluctantly agreed to help. In January 1874, Ludwig granted 100,000 Thaler and construction on the theatre, designed by architect Gottfried Semper, started shortly thereafter. Semper, inspired by the classical amphitheater, built a double proscenium in the theatre, creating a necessary space between the listener’s “real world” and the imaginary world that occurred on stage. Later in the construction of the theatre, architect Carl Brandt expanded Semper’s double proscenium to six pairs of proscenia, and also created its amphitheater shape. Performances featured a sunken pit and dimmed lighting; it is clear that Wagner was adamant about controlling the audience’s visual and aural experience during his performances. These specific considerations resulted in a delayed opening of the theatre.A planned 1875 debut was postponed for a year due to construction and other delays.

== Early history ==

Since its opening in 1876, the Bayreuth Festival has been a socio-cultural phenomenon. The inauguration took place on 13 August 1876, with a performance of Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Choral&quot; Symphony, which is occasionally programmed during the festival. (It was played at the post-war reopening in 1951, and subsequently in 1953, 1954, 1963, 2001, and had been planned for the cancelled 2020 season.) Then came the first performance of &quot;Das Rheingold&quot;. Present at this unique musical event were Kaiser Wilhelm, Dom Pedro II of Brazil, King Ludwig (who attended in secret, probably to avoid the Kaiser), and other members of the nobility, as well as the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche who committed much effort to helping his then good friend Wagner establish the festival, and such accomplished composers as Anton Bruckner, Edvard Grieg, Pyotr Tchaikovsky, Franz Liszt, and the young Arthur Foote.

Artistically, the festival was a success. (&quot;Something has taken place at Bayreuth which our grandchildren and their children will still remember&quot;, wrote Tchaikovsky, attending the Festival as a Russian correspondent.) Financially, however, the festival was a disaster and did not begin to make money until several years later. Wagner abandoned his original plan to hold a second festival the following year, and travelled to London to conduct a series of concerts in an attempt to make up the deficit. Although the festival was plagued by financial problems in its early years, it survived through state intervention and the continued support of influential Wagnerians, including King Ludwig II of Bavaria.

Following the financial failure of the initial Bayreuth Festival, as well as Wagner&#x27;s death in 1883, there was a political discourse of Wagner&#x27;s works involving a disenchantment with the Reich that led to a cultural lull of the festival. The declining popularity of the current centralized government created an artistic shift away from Richard Wagner who had preemptively popularized his works amongst the German government in an attempt to gain mass popularity and recognition. This consequently led to a general lack of public interest in the festival in its early history.

From its inception, the festival has attracted leading conductors and singers, many of whom performed without pay. Among these was Hans Richter, who conducted the premiere of the Ring Cycle in 1876. Another was the talented conductor Hermann Levi, who was personally chosen by Richard Wagner to conduct the debut of &quot;Parsifal&quot; in 1882 with the assistance of the young Engelbert Humperdinck. 

Following Wagner&#x27;s death, his widow Cosima continued running the festival at one or, more frequently, two-year intervals. She gradually introduced the early operas which complete the Bayreuth canon of Wagner&#x27;s last ten mature works. Levi, the son of a rabbi, remained the festival&#x27;s principal conductor for the next two decades. Felix Mottl, who was involved with the festival from 1876 to 1901, conducted &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; there in 1886. Until the 1920s, performances were strictly in accordance with the traditions established under King Ludwig&#x27;s patronage. Not a note was &quot;cut&quot; from any of the enormous scores; no concessions were made to the limits of human patience on the part of the audiences. Cosima Wagner preserved the productions of &quot;Parsifal&quot; and the Ring just as they had been in Wagner&#x27;s day, defending any proposed changes with appeals to her son Siegfried: &quot;Was this not how Papa did it in 1876?&quot; During her era of leadership, the festival became increasingly associated with antisemitism.

After Cosima&#x27;s retirement in 1906, Siegfried Wagner took over management of the festival, introducing new staging and performance styles. His early death in 1930 left the Festival in the hands of his English-born wife Winifred Wagner, with Heinz Tietjen as artistic director.

== Bayreuth under Nazi Germany ==

In the 1920s, well before the rise of the Nazi Party, Winifred Wagner became a strong supporter and close personal friend of Adolf Hitler; her correspondence with Hitler has never been released by the Wagner family. She and other festival leaders were members of Nazi chief ideologue Alfred Rosenberg&#x27;s &quot;Kampfbund für deutsche Kultur&quot;, which actively suppressed modernist music and works by &quot;degenerate&quot; artists. The festival maintained some artistic independence under Nazi rule. Ironically, Hitler attended performances that included Jewish and foreign singers, long after they had been banned from all other venues across Germany (including homosexual heldentenor Max Lorenz, married to a well-known Jewish woman). Winifred&#x27;s influence with Hitler was so strong that at her behest, he wrote a letter to anti-fascist Italian conductor Arturo Toscanini, inviting him to lead the festival. Toscanini, who had conducted there in 1930 and 1931, refused in 1933. From 1933 to 1942, the festival was conducted principally by Karl Elmendorff.

It was in Nazi Germany that the festival made its first break from tradition, abandoning the deteriorating 19th century sets created by Richard Wagner. Many protested at the changes, including prominent conductors such as Toscanini and Richard Strauss, and even some members of the Wagner family. In their view, any change to the festival was a profanation against &quot;the Master&quot; (Wagner). Nevertheless, Hitler approved of the changes, thus paving the way for more innovations in the decades to come.

During the war, the festival was turned over to the Nazi Party, which continued to sponsor performances for wounded soldiers returning from the front. These soldiers were forced to attend lectures on Wagner before the performances, and most found the festival to be tedious. However, as &quot;guests of the Führer&quot;, none complained.

===Bayreuth Memorial===

During the 1970s, Winifred Wagner was repeatedly petitioned to install a memorial to the Jewish singers at the Bayreuth Festival who had been murdered in concentration camps. A plaque was finally installed honouring Ottilie Metzger-Lattermann and Henriette Gottlieb after Winifred&#x27;s death.

==New festival==
Two-thirds of the town of Bayreuth were destroyed by American bombing in the final days of World War II, taking with it the rotunda, living room and guest room of Wahnfried, though the theatre itself was undamaged. Following the war, Winifred Wagner was sentenced to probation by a war court for her support of the Nazi Party. The court also banned her from administration of the Bayreuth Festival and its assets, which fell eventually to her two sons, Wolfgang and Wieland.

During American occupation of the region after World War II, the theatre was used for army recreation and religious services for American soldiers. Only popular concerts and mixed entertainment were allowed: comedy, dancing, acrobatics, and then only &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot; was staged. When the Festival House was handed over to the city of Bayreuth in 1946, it was used for concerts of the Bayreuth Symphony Orchestra and the performances of such operas as Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Fidelio&quot;, d&#x27;Albert&#x27;s &quot;Tiefland&quot;, Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Madama Butterfly,&quot; and Verdi&#x27;s &quot;La traviata&quot; and talks about reopening of the Wagnerian Festival started. Finally, it reopened on 29 July 1951 with, as always, a performance by the Bayreuth Festival Orchestra under conductor Wilhelm Furtwängler of Beethoven&#x27;s 9th Symphony, followed by the first post-war performance of Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Parsifal&quot;.

Under the direction of Wieland Wagner, the &quot;New Bayreuth&quot; ushered in an era that was no less than revolutionary. Gone were the elaborate naturalistic sets, replaced with minimalist modern productions. In comparison, the pre-war changes seemed tame. For the first time in its history, the Bayreuth audience booed at the end of productions. Wieland was particularly derided for his 1956 production of &quot;Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg.&quot; Stripped of its pageantry, conservatives viewed the breaking of this &quot;sacred German tradition&quot; as an outrage.

Wieland defended the changes as an attempt to create an &quot;invisible stage&quot; that would allow the audience to experience the full psychosocial aspects of the drama without the baggage and distraction of elaborate set designs. Others have speculated that by stripping Wagner&#x27;s works of their Germanic and historic elements, Wieland was attempting to distance Bayreuth from its nationalistic past and create productions with universal appeal. Over time, many critics came to appreciate the unique beauty of Wieland&#x27;s reinterpretation of his grandfather&#x27;s works.

Wieland&#x27;s innovative productions invited comparison to Wolfgang&#x27;s, which critics unanimously found to be uninspired. If Wieland&#x27;s productions were radical, Wolfgang&#x27;s were regressive. Although still minimalist in approach, Wolfgang resurrected much of the naturalistic and romantic elements of pre-war productions. Thus, when Wieland died prematurely from lung cancer in 1966, many wondered if Bayreuth had a future. They began to question Bayreuth&#x27;s primacy among German opera houses, and some suggested that more interesting productions were being staged elsewhere.

Around this time (1955), in order to broaden its audience, the whole Bayreuth Festival company conducted performances in Paris and Barcelona, performing &quot;Parsifal&quot;, &quot;Die Walküre&quot; and &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;.

In 1973, faced with overwhelming criticism and family infighting, the Bayreuth Festival and its assets were transferred to a newly created Richard Wagner Foundation. The board of directors included members of the Wagner family and others appointed by the state. As chairman, Wolfgang Wagner remained in charge of administration of the festival.

== The Wagner &quot;Werkstatt&quot; ==
While Wolfgang Wagner continued to administer the festival, beginning in the 1970s, production was handled by a number of new directors in what Wolfgang called &quot;Werkstatt Bayreuth&quot; (Bayreuth Workshop). The idea was to turn the festival into an opportunity for directors to experiment with new methods for presenting the stage works. The change came out of necessity, as it was impossible for Wolfgang to both administer and direct the festival. It also provided an opportunity for Bayreuth to renew itself with each production, rather than continue to present the same stage works in the same way, year after year. Ingmar Bergman, who famously made a film version in Swedish of Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Die Zauberflöte&quot;, turned down an invitation to direct the festival.

The most sensational production in &quot;Werkstatt Bayreuth&quot; was the centennial &quot;Ring&quot; cycle (&quot;Jahrhundertring&quot;) directed by Patrice Chéreau, who used an updated 19th-century setting, following the interpretation of George Bernard Shaw who regarded the Ring as a social commentary on the exploitation of the working class by wealthy 19th-century capitalists. The audience reaction was initially split between those who saw the production as an offence and those who considered it the best Ring Cycle ever produced. The ensuing conflict, short only of outright riot, between supporters and detractors was unprecedented in the history of the festival. Later, the performances proved influential for the concept of &quot;Regietheater&quot;.

Other notable directors to have participated in &quot;Werkstatt Bayreuth&quot; included Jean-Pierre Ponnelle, Sir Peter Hall of the Royal Shakespeare Company, Götz Friedrich of the Deutsche Oper Berlin, Harry Kupfer of the Berlin State Opera in the former communist East Germany and Heiner Müller of the Berliner Ensemble. In the end, Wolfgang&#x27;s decision to bring in experimental directors helped rejuvenate Bayreuth and restore its reputation as the world leader in Wagnerian opera.

== 21st century ==

There was uncertainty over how the Festival was to be managed after the retirement of Wolfgang Wagner at the end of August 2008. In 2001, the Festival&#x27;s 21-member board of directors had voted for his daughter, Eva Wagner-Pasquier, to succeed him. Wolfgang Wagner, however, proposed to hand control over to his second wife, Gudrun, and their daughter Katharina. Gudrun died in 2007. No successor was named at that time, but it was speculated that Wagner-Pasquier and Katharina would eventually be named as joint directors of the festival. Directors have stated that preference will be given to descendants of Richard Wagner, and that a non-descendant would have to be a clearly better candidate.

On 1 September 2008, Wolfgang Wagner&#x27;s daughters, Eva Wagner-Pasquier and Katharina Wagner, were named by Bavaria&#x27;s culture minister, Thomas Goppel, to take over the Festival. They were to take up their duties immediately, since their father had announced his retirement at the conclusion of the 2008 Festival. They were chosen ahead of the pair of their cousin, Nike Wagner, and Gerard Mortier, who had placed a late bid for the directorship on 24 August. The conductor Christian Thielemann has agreed to act as chief adviser to the new directors, effectively taking the role of music director of the Festival.

In 2014 it was announced that Eva would be stepping down from the co-directorship leaving, in accord with her father&#x27;s will, Katharina in sole charge.

On the 31 March 2020 it was announced that, due to the
COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting restrictions,
the 2020 festival (due to take place from 25 July to 30 August) would be cancelled.
The new &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot; production planned for that festival would be postponed until at least 2022.

Restrictions were eased for the 2021 festival, which went ahead with a limited audience capacity and testing/vaccination requirements.
The 2022 festival went ahead as normal, including the new production of the &quot;Ring&quot;.

In 2023 the festival had mixed opinions due to the use of AR goggles and 3D glasses to enhance the experience. The festival has attempted to modernize to aid with low ticket sales.

===Tickets===
The festival draws thousands of Wagner fans to Bayreuth every summer. It is very difficult to get tickets, because demand (estimated at 500,000) greatly exceeds supply (58,000 tickets); the waiting time is between five and ten years (or more). The process entails submitting an order form every summer; applicants are usually successful after about ten years. Failure to make an application every year results in being placed at the back of the queue. Although some tickets are allocated by lottery, preference is given to members of the Society of Friends of Bayreuth (financial donors), famous patrons, and to regional and international Wagner societies, which are distributed to their own members through lottery or the willingness to pay a high contribution.

However, in 2013 tickets for one opera production were offered exclusively online, on a first come first served basis with no preferential eligibility. It is reported that they sold out within seconds.
This offer was repeated for the 2014 season, with tickets being available for eight performances including one complete Ring cycle. As of 2014, retail ticket prices ranged from €320 for a front row stalls seat to €45 for a gallery (third level) back row seat.

The Festival authorities assiduously police the traffic of tickets, and monitor sites such as eBay. On admission patrons may be required to show photographic identification matching the name on the ticket, with any not matching being refused admission to the performance.

In 2011 it was revealed that the German Bundesrechnungshof (federal audit office) were investigating the situation where, for a publicly subsidised event, only 40 percent of the tickets were actually available to the general public. Early in 2012 it was announced that changes would be made to the allocation system, including the ending of allocations to Wagner Societies (but not including the Society of Friends of Bayreuth as they make a substantial financial contribution) and a reduction in the proportion reserved for travel agents and hotels. As a result, the proportion of tickets available to the general public would increase to about 65 percent of the total available.

===&quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot;===

A new production of &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot;, or the &quot;Ring&quot; cycle, is presented every five to seven years, following a year in which no &quot;Ring&quot; is presented. In years in which the &quot;Ring&quot; is staged, three other works are also presented. When no &quot;Ring&quot; is staged, five other works are presented. Tickets for the &quot;Ring&quot; are normally sold only as a complete set for all four performances.

The &quot;Ring&quot; produced for the Festival&#x27;s centenary in 1976 was produced by a French team around director Patrice Chéreau and conductor Pierre Boulez. Known as the &quot;Jahrhundertring&quot;, it was filmed. 

The newest production of the &quot;Ring&quot; (directed by Valentin Schwarz) premiered in 2022 after pandemic-related delays. Schwarz&#x27;s modern staging of the cycle— depicting a complex, tangled family drama spanning generations—was met with mixed reviews from audiences and the press.

<text>The Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church (UAOC; (UAPTs)) was one of the three major Eastern Orthodox churches in Ukraine in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, together with the Ukrainian Orthodox Church – Kyiv Patriarchate (UOC-KP) and the Ukrainian Orthodox Church – Moscow Patriarchate (UOC-MP). It began in 1921 during the dissolution of the Russian Empire as part of the Ukrainian independence movement and in order to restore the Ukrainian Orthodox Church that existed in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1620–1685 and was annexed by the Moscow Patriarchate without approval of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. The UAOC came to an end in December 2018 as it united with the UOC-KP into the newly formed Orthodox Church of Ukraine (OCU).

The UAOC, in its contemporary form, has its origins in the synod of 1921 in Kyiv, shortly after Ukraine&#x27;s newly found independence. It was re-established for the third time on 22 October 1989, right before the fall of the Soviet Union. Unlike the UOC-KP, the UAOC enjoyed no recognition by the rest of the Orthodox Christian community until 11 October 2018, when the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople lifted the excommunication which had afflicted both the UAOC and the UOC-KP. It was clarified on 2 November 2018, however, that the Ecumenical Patriarchate recognized neither the UAOC nor the UOC-KP as legitimate and that their respective leaders were not recognized as primates of their churches. On 15 December 2018, at the unification council of the Eastern Orthodox churches of Ukraine, the UAOC and the UOC-KP, along with metropolitans from the UOC-MP, unified into the OCU.

==History==

The Kyivan Metropolis was the fruit of the baptism of the Kyivan Rus in the time of Grand Prince Vladimir the Great (988 AD). Missionaries were sent from Constantinople to instruct the people in the Byzantine-Orthodox faith. Monastic life flourished, including in the famous Kyiv Monastery of the Caves, through the efforts of St. Anthony of Kiev, known as the father of Russian monasticism.

The sacking of Kyiv itself in December 1240 during the Mongol invasion led to the ultimate collapse of the Rus&#x27; state. For many of its residents, the brutality of Mongol attacks sealed the fate of many choosing to find safe haven in the North East. In 1299, the Kyivan metropolitan chair was moved to Vladimir by Metropolitan Maximus, keeping the title &quot;of Kyiv&quot;. As Vladimir-Suzdal, and later the Grand Duchy of Moscow continued to grow unhindered, the Orthodox religious link between them and Kyiv remained strong. The fall of Constantinople in 1453, allowed the once daughter church of North East, to become autocephalous, with Kyiv remaining part of the Ecumenical Patriarchate. From that moment on, the Churches of Ukraine and Russia went their own separate ways.

The latter became central in the growing Russian Tsardom, attaining patriarchate in 1589, whilst the former became subject to repression and Polonization efforts, particularly after the Union of Brest in 1596. Eventually the persecution of Orthodox Ukrainians led to a massive rebellion under Bohdan Khmelnytsky, and united the Ukrainian Hetmanate with the Russian Tsardom, and in 1686, the Kyivan Metropolia came under the Moscow Patriarchate. Ukrainian clergy, for their Greek training, held key roles in the Russian Orthodox Church until the end of the 18th century.

In the wake of the breakup of the Russian Empire some national groups sought autonomy or autocephaly from Moscow. The Ukrainian Orthodox Church was proclaimed under the Ukrainian National Republic in 1917 and survived in Soviet Ukraine until the early 1930s.

===Reestablishment in late 1980s===
Revival of the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church took place in late 1988. On 15 February 1989 in Kyiv was established the Initiative Committee in revival of the UOAC which was based on Ukrainian Cultural club and consisted of priest Bohdan Mykhailechko (Yelgava), priest Myron Sas-Zhurakivskyi (Kolomyia), Larysa Lokhvytska, Antoliy Bytchenko, Mykola Budnyk, Serhiy Naboka, Yevhen Sverstyuk. An appeal was approved, which called for the formation of regional committees for the revival of the UAOC and to begin commemorating the Ecumenical Patriarch Demetrios I at divine services. The Initiative Committee headed by Bohdan Mykhailechko published an appeal to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and Supreme Soviet of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (predecessor of Verkhovna Rada) and the international Christian community. Recalling the long-term captivity and lack of rights of the Ukrainian Church under the rule of Moscow, the five founders of the committee expressed and substantiated the demand for the restoration of full autocephaly.

On Easter 1989, the Kyiv-based Ukrainian Orthodox community held a festive service in a private home. This was the first Ukrainian-language worship service in the capital of Ukraine since 1943. But in early June, the Kyiv city authorities refused to register the UAOC parish of Saint Nicholas of the Embankment in Podil, saying &quot;there has never been and is no such Church as the UAOC, and therefore a non-existent Church cannot be registered.&quot; This is a translation of the verbatim repetition of the thesis expressed by the Exarch of Ukraine, Metropolitan Philaret (Denysenko).

On February 27, 1989, a group of Lviv priests of the Russian Orthodox Church appealed to Metropolitan Philaret (Denysenko) with a statement about the need to obtain autocephaly for the Ukrainian Exarchate. Archpriest Volodymyr Yarema, parson of the Peter and Paul Parish in Lviv, signed the statement on behalf of like-minded people. No response was received. The reaction to the letter was the consideration of the case of Volodymyr Yarema in the diocesan administration. However, strict sanctions against the authors of the letter were not applied due to the difficult situation in the diocese, where it became obvious that the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church would soon come out of the underground.

The Russian Orthodox Church Lviv Metropolitan Nicodemus (Rusnak) (1921-2011), previously expelled from Argentina for espionage for the Soviet Union, was ready to support efforts to obtain autocephaly on the condition that local Greek Catholics, who had begun to emerge from the underground, join the newly forming Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church. He sent Archpriest Volodymyr Yarema and priest Ivan Pashula for negotiations with Volodymyr Sterniuk, head of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church in catacombs. However, Bishop Sterniuk refused to join the Church (UAOC), which will not recognize the jurisdiction of the Roman bishop.

On 19 August 1989, at the Holy Liturgy in the Peter and Paul Cathedral in Lviv, which was first held in Ukrainian, Archpriest Volodymyr Yarema read the appeal of the Initiative Committee for the revival of the UAOC, which proposed:
# To create regional committees for the revival of the UAOC for their subsequent merger into the All-Ukrainian Orthodox Council.
# In your parishes, gather parish meetings, by the decision of which declare your refusal to obey the Russian Orthodox Church.
# Inform the regional committees about your unshakable loyalty to your native UAPC.
# Commemorate His Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Demetrios I at all divine services.

Priest Bohdan Mykhailechko, head of the Initiative Committee, took part in the service and addressed the faithful with a statement of support for the initiative of the church of St. apostles Peter and Paul in Lviv. He emphasized: &quot;Moscow did not have and cannot have any jurisdiction over our Church.&quot; Telegrams were sent to Ecumenical Patriarch Demetrios I, Metropolitan of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the USA Mstyslav (Skrypnyk), Metropolitan of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada Wasyly (Fedak) with a message about the change of jurisdiction. The collection of signatures for the application in the name of the Commissioner for Religious Confessions at the Lviv Regional Executive Committee, Yuliyan Reshetyl, was completed.

On October 22, 1989, the freelance bishop of the Russian Orthodox Church, Ioan Bodnarchuk, arrived in Lviv at the invitation of the clergy to lead the communities that had transferred to the UAOC. He conducted the Divine Service, after which he ordained a deacon, a graduate of the Lviv Polygraphic Institute, Yuri Boyko, who was elected to the first democratic city council of Lviv. Thus, he entered the canonical management of the UAOC communities. Priests of the Lviv Region, led by Bishop Ioan, held the first diocesan council.

The church regained state recognition in 1991, which is known as the &quot;third resurrection&quot; of the UAOC. Initially it was governed from abroad by Patriarch Mstyslav (Skrypnyk). Subsequent to his death in 1993, he was succeeded by Patriarch Volodomyr. The Patriarch would, during his time as patriarch, separate from the UAOC to found the Ukrainian Orthodox Church – Kyiv Patriarchate (UOC-KP), together with Metropolitan (now Patriarch) Filaret Denysenko. Those not willing to accept this change continued the UAOC with a new primate, Patriarch Dymytriy Yarema.

In November of 1991, the Ukrainian Autocephalous Ukrainian Church had 14 eparchies, 11 bishops (episcopes) and 1,600 parishes.

On October 16, 2000, the Church Sobor in Ukraine elected Metropolitan Methodius (Kudriakov) of Ternopil to lead the church.

The Patriarchal Cathedral of the UAOC is the historic Church of St. Andrew the First-Called in Kyiv. It was built between 1747 and 1754 and was designed by the famous architect Bartolomeo Rastrelli. Although used for regular liturgical services of the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church, the edifice had previously been a part of the historical park &quot;Sofia-Kyiv.&quot; The Ukrainian government returned the church to the legal possession of the UAOC on 21 May 2008.

=== 11 October 2018 decision of the Ecumenical Patriarchate ===

On 11 October 2018, after a regular synod, the Patriarchate of Constantinople renewed an earlier decision to move towards granting autocephaly to the Ukrainian Orthodox Church. The synod also withdrew Constantinople&#x27;s 332-years-old qualified acceptance of the Russian Orthodox Church&#x27;s canonical jurisdiction over the Ukrainian Church contained in a letter of 1686. The synod also lifted the excommunication of Patriarch Filaret of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church – Kyiv Patriarchate (UOC-KP) and Metropolitan Makariy of the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church (UAOC), and both bishops were &quot;canonically reinstated to their hierarchical or priestly rank, and their faithful [...] restored to communion with the Church.&quot;

It was later clarified that Filaret was considered by the Ecumenical Patriarchate only as &quot;the former metropolitan of Kyiv&quot;, and Makariy as &quot;the former Archbishop of Lviv&quot; and, on 2 November 2018, that the Ecumenical Patriarchate did not recognize neither the UAOC nor the UOC-KP as legitimate and that their respective leaders were not recognized as primates of their churches. The Ecumenical Patriarchate declared that it recognized the sacraments performed by the UOC-KP and the UAOC as valid.

==== Dissolution and merger with the UOC–KP into the OCU ====

On 15 December 2018, the hierarchs of the UAOC and the UOC-KP decided to dissolve them both. This was done because on the same day, the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church, the Ukrainian Orthodox Church – Kyiv Patriarchate, and some members of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate) were going to merge to form the Orthodox Church of Ukraine after a unification council.

Makariy declared in an interview published on 23 May 2019 that neither the UAOC nor the UOC-KP had been dissolved: &quot;Some government officials spoke incorrectly when they publicly declared that the Kyiv Patriarchate was liquidated.&quot; He explained that Philaret submitted only copies of documents, not the originals necessary in order to liquidate the UOC-KP. Macarius added: &quot;When I was asked to hand over the documents for liquidation, I replied that until I see the originals from the other side, I will not turn in mine.&quot;

On 14 August 2019, the UAOC legally ceased to exist because it merged with the OCU.

On 14 December 2019, after the meeting of the enlarged Bishops&#x27; Council, held on December 14 in Kyiv on the occasion of the anniversary of the creation of the OCU, Epiphanius declared that the procedure of liquidation of the UAOC as well as the UOC-KP had been completed the day before. He added: &quot;Such structures no longer exist. In confirmation of that, in the State Register there is marked &#x27;activity DISCONTINUED&#x27;&quot;.

==Primates==

===1921–1936===

In 1921, with the establishment of the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church, the Metropolitan of Kyiv and All Ukraine was considered the primate of the church.

<text>Baltasar Garzón Real (; born 26 October 1955) is a Spanish former judge. He served on Spain&#x27;s central criminal court, the &quot;Audiencia Nacional&quot;, and was the examining magistrate of the &quot;Juzgado Central de Instrucción No. 5&quot;, which investigates the most important criminal cases in Spain, including terrorism, organised crime, and money laundering. In 2011, he was suspended from judicial activity and in 2012 he was convicted of illegal wiretapping and disbarred for a period of 11 years. During this time, Garzón legally assisted Julian Assange. In the landmark case &quot;Baltasar Garzón v. Spain&quot; (2021)&quot;,&quot; the United Nations Human Rights Committee found that Garzón&#x27;s trial in Spain was &quot;arbitrary&quot; and violated the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.

==Early life==
Born in Torres, Jaén, Garzón graduated from the University of Seville in 1979. He was appointed to the &quot;Audiencia Nacional&quot; in 1988, and rapidly made his name in Spain by pursuing the Basque separatist group ETA.

==Political career==
In 1993, Garzón asked for an extended leave of absence as a judge and went into politics, running for the Congress of Deputies (the lower house of parliament) as an independent candidate on the party list of the then ruling party Partido Socialista Obrero Español (PSOE). Prime Minister Felipe González appointed him head of a strengthened National Plan Against Drugs, but Garzón resigned shortly after being appointed, complaining of lack of support from the government, and returned to the &quot;Audiencia Nacional&quot;.

==Spanish cases==

===GAL===

His 1994 investigation led to the conviction of José Barrionuevo Peña, a former Interior minister, as head of the Grupos Antiterroristas de Liberación (GAL), a state terrorist group, in the aftermath of the kidnapping of French citizen Segundo Marey.

===Drug-trafficking===

Garzón made his name as a magistrate through several police operations centred on drug-trafficking in Galicia. Colombian cartels, such as the Medellín Cartel, were using the Galician mafia, already accustomed to smuggling tobacco, to smuggle drugs into Spain. In 1990, &quot;Operación Nécora&quot; led to the conviction of members of the clan led by Laureano Oubiña. The following year Garzón headed another investigation, &quot;Operación Pitón&quot;, which led to the conviction of members of the Charlines clan.

===&quot;Caso Atlético&quot;===
In 1999, he investigated Jesús Gil, the former mayor of Marbella and owner of Atlético Madrid, who was convicted in 2002 on grounds of corruption.

===Ban of Basque parties Batasuna, EAE-ANV and EHAK===
As a National Court judge, Garzón declared on 11 December 2001 that there is no ETA entourage but &quot;everything is ETA&quot;. On 3 September 2002, he accused the Basque party Batasuna of helping and funding ETA, participating in the armed organization, and as such, involved in &quot;crimes against humanity&quot;, also criticising any nuanced approach on Batasuna and ETA. Police shut down offices and property of the party on Garzon&#x27;s orders, and suspended for three years the operations of the party. 22 members of its directive committee were arrested by 2007.

Ahead of the Spanish general election on 9 March 2008, Garzón suspended in February the Basque parties EAE-ANV and EHAK (PCTV), also ordering the closure of their headquarters, premises, establishments and any other venues, as well as blocking the parties&#x27; banking accounts. In April 2008, the judge concluded the summary that involved Batasuna to ETA, putting on trial 41 members of the party, including Arnaldo Otegi. The 61 Chamber of the Supreme Court of Spain outlawed in September the parties EAE-ANV and EHAK. In March 2009, Garzón processed 44 members constituting the directive committees of the three parties in an indictment numbering 583 pages. The judge stated that &quot;EAE-ANV and EHAK (PCTV) were manipulated by the members of the national committee of Batasuna to continue the criminal pursuit designed by ETA&quot;.

===Approach on torture===

Garzón rose to prominence in the Spanish special tribunal National Court dealing with anti-terrorism in early 1990s. Basque terrorism suspects held incommunicado for days stood before court sometimes with clear signs of violence on their body. As a judge, he used to ignore right away apparent injuries detainees&#x27; bodies, as well as their statements describing their period in police hands, labelling injuries &quot;self-inflicted&quot;, or irrelevant, and failing to investigate the cases. Approximately 100 Basques and Catalans may have been tortured under the jurisdiction of Baltasar Garzón as a judge.

===Francoist atrocities===

On 17 October 2008, Garzón formally declared the acts of repression committed by the Franco regime to be crimes against humanity, and accounted them in more than one hundred thousand killings during and after the Spanish Civil War. He also ordered the exhumation of 19 unmarked mass graves, one of them believed to contain the remains of the poet Federico García Lorca.

On 17 November 2008, Garzón said that he was dropping the investigation against Franco and his allies after state prosecutors had questioned his jurisdiction over crimes committed 70 years ago by people who are now dead and whose crimes were covered by an amnesty passed in 1977. In a 152-page statement, he passed responsibility to regional courts for opening 19 mass graves believed to hold the remains of hundreds of victims.

=== &quot;Caso Gürtel&quot; ===

Garzón started a major corruption inquiry, code-named &quot;Gürtel&quot; from the name of its ringleader, Francisco Correa, (&quot;Gürtel&quot; being German for &quot;belt&quot;, which is the meaning of &quot;correa&quot; in Spanish). The case was related to bribes given to People&#x27;s Party. He was disposed of the case in 2010.

====Allegation of improper eavesdropping====
The accused in the case sought to have evidence against them ignored. The accused asked that the evidence be ruled inadmissible, since it was obtained from conversations between prisoners and counsel, which, under Spanish law, it is claimed, is allowed only in terrorism-related cases.

Garzón&#x27;s authorisation of the recordings resulted in his disbarment as a judge and lawyer.

==International cases==

===Augusto Pinochet===

On 10 October 1998, Garzón issued an international warrant for the arrest of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet for the alleged deaths and torture of Spanish citizens. The Chilean Truth Commission (1990–91) report was the basis for the warrant, marking an unprecedented use of universal jurisdiction to attempt to try a former dictator for a crime committed abroad. Eventually it was turned down by British Home Secretary Jack Straw, who rejected Garzón&#x27;s request to have Pinochet extradited to Spain on health grounds.

====Kissinger and Operation Condor====
Garzón asked for permission to interview former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger about terrorism and genocide that occurred as part of Operation Condor. Permission was refused.

===Dirty War===
Garzón also filed charges of genocide against Argentine military officers on Dirty War&#x27;s disappearance of Spanish citizens during Argentina&#x27;s 1976–1983 dictatorship. Eventually, Adolfo Scilingo and Miguel Angel Cavallo were prosecuted in separate cases. Scilingo was convicted and sentenced to over 1,000 years incarceration for his crimes.

===Guantanamo===
Garzón issued indictments for five Guantanamo detainees, including Spaniard Abderrahman Ahmad and Jordanian Jamil El Banna. Ahmad was extradited to Spain on 14 February 2004. El Banna was released to the United Kingdom, and in 2007, Garzón dropped the charges against him on humanitarian grounds.

====Bush Six====

In March 2009, Garzón considered whether Spain should allow charges to be filed against former officials from the United States government under George W. Bush for offering justifications for torture. The six former Bush officials are: Alberto Gonzales, former Attorney General John Yoo, of the Office of Legal Counsel; Douglas Feith, former undersecretary of defense for policy; William Haynes II, former general counsel for the Department of Defense; Jay Bybee, also at Justice Department&#x27;s Office of Legal Counsel; and David Addington, Vice President Dick Cheney&#x27;s Chief of Staff. However, the investigation was assigned to Judge Eloy Velasco who chose not to pursue it stating that Spain could not investigate the case if the U.S. did not intend to conduct its own investigation into the matter.

On 29 April 2009, Garzón opened an investigation into an alleged &quot;systematic programme&quot; of torture at Guantánamo Bay, following accusations by four former prisoners. Similarly, the leaked cable indicates that the Chief Prosecutor intended to also fight this investigation and that he feared, &quot;Garzón may attempt to wring all the publicity he can from the case unless and until he is forced to give it up.&quot;

In September 2009, the Spanish newspaper &quot;Público&quot; reported that, despite opposition, Garzón was proceeding to the next phase of his investigation.

===Alex Saab===
On 22 July 2020, Garzón said that he would represent Colombian businessman Alex Saab in a U.S. extradition case, indicted with money laundering charges.

==Appearance before the Spanish Supreme Court==
The Supreme Court of Spain has declared admissible three criminal accusations against Garzón for &#x27;prevarication&#x27; which implies using his authority as a judge to intentionally subvert the course of justice. This is a very serious criminal offense punishable by suspension from any (Spanish) judicial activity for up to twenty years.

===Crimes against humanity by Franco&#x27;s government===
In October 2008, Garzón opened a controversial inquiry into alleged crimes against humanity committed by the Nationalist government during the Spanish Civil War and the years that followed the war. This action was controversial because the offenses were nearly 70 years old, occurring before the concept of crimes against humanity, and a 1977 general amnesty act barred any investigations related to criminal offenses with a political aim previous to 1976. In 2008, the inquiry was suspended. In September 2009, a trade union called &quot;Manos limpias&quot; (Clean Hands) filed a lawsuit against Garzón alleging that Garzón had abused his judicial authority by opening the inquiry. Manos Limpias is a &quot;far-right group,&quot; according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Garzón denied any wrongdoing.

In April 2010, Garzón was indicted by the Spanish Supreme Court for prevarication for arbitrarily changing his juridical criteria to engineer the case in order to bypass the law limiting his jurisdiction. If convicted, he could have been barred from his duties for 20 years. Garzón&#x27;s indictment has been highly divisive within Spain and controversial abroad. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch condemned the indictment, and &quot;The New York Times&quot; published an editorial supporting him, whereas &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; condemned Garzón&#x27;s proceedings in an editorial supporting the rule of law. There were public protests in Spain from left wing organizations supporting Garzón.

The International Commission of Jurists considers that his short-lived inquiry did not justify disciplinary action, let alone criminal prosecution, adding that the prosecution of judges for carrying out their professional work was &quot;an inappropriate and unwarranted interference with the independence of the judicial process&quot;.

On 24 April 2010, Garzón presented an appeal to the Supreme Court against the judge investigating the case, Luciano Varela for giving advice to the plaintiffs about the errors in their documents. Garzón accused the judge of partiality, in having &quot;a direct interest in the proceedings and bias in the action&quot; and having &quot;worked closely with the plaintiffs by offering counsel or legal advice&quot; intended help the complainants to correct a defect in their series of indictments to meet a deadline, an action which he defined as &quot;atypical, extrajudicial and prejudicial to one of the parties&quot; (i.e. him, as the accused). According to Garzón, &quot;intervention by the instructing judge is not protected under any provision of the current legal procedural rules and is clearly unrelated to the substantive rules of Spanish court procedure&quot;. Luciano Varela accepted the appeal and temporarily stepped out from the case until the Supreme Court rules on the appeal.

On 11 May 2010, Luis Moreno-Ocampo, chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) requested that the Judiciary of Spain might assign Garzón as a consultant to the ICC for six months, which would have allowed General Council of the Judicial Power of Spain (La Comisión Permanente Extraordinaria del Consejo General del Poder Juidicial or CGPJ) to avoid suspending Garzón during the impending trial for investigating crimes committed during the Francisco Franco era.

In response, Judge Varela brought forward his conclusion that Garzón should stand trial, and the CGPJ rejected the request of the ICC on the basis that it appeared to be simply a personal request by Moreno-Ocampo, rather than an official ICC invitation. On Friday, 14 May 2010, Garzón was duly suspended from judicial activity (with pay) &#x27;as a precaution, pending judgment&#x27; as a result of the decision of Judge Varela, which causes suspension to be formally required by Spanish law. The CGPC subsequently declared that it would require five different certificates (&#x27;informes&#x27; in Spanish) to release Garzón to the ICC as a consultant for six months during his period of suspension from judicial activity. These were:

* That the public prosecutor (which opposes the trial of Garzón) certify that there would be no conflict of interest
* That the Supreme Court of Spain (hearing the case against Garzón) would not be delayed or inconvenienced
* That the ICC certify the appointment would not provide immunity for Garzón from either outstanding or future criminal process in Spain
* That Spain&#x27;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation declare the appointment of Garzón to be in the national interest of Spain
* That the Secretary General of the CGPJ was satisfied that all of the above certificates were appropriate and legally valid for this temporary assignment.

José Manuel Gómez Begresista, the president of the CGPJ&#x27;s Commission for Studies and Reports, impugned each of the above five conditions, which he characterized as &#x27;ridiculous&#x27; since Garzón had previously been assigned to such work, and no immunity from Spanish law attaches thereto. He went on to state that the decision taken by the CGPJ &quot;lacked any legal grounds whatsoever&quot;.

Later that day, the CGPJ authorised the assignment of Garzón to the ICC.

==== ECHR: &quot;Kononov v. Latvia&quot; ====
Coincidentally, on the same day, the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg delivered final judgment in the case &quot;Vassili Kononov v. Latvia&quot; No. 36376/04, on 17 May 2010.

The Russian Federation had maintained that any prosecution of the applicant was statute-barred, as supported by the dissenting opinion of Judge Costa joined by judges Kalaydjieva and Poalelungi, : under &quot;Article 15 of the European Convention on Human Rights no derogation is permissible and in conclusion, the dissident judges considered that, in respect of Article 7 of the European Convention on Human Rights

However, in the prevailing and joint concurring opinion of judges Rozakis, Tulkens, Spielmann and Jebens:

Since the Spanish State of Franco had laws against kidnapping and killing, it might be difficult to argue that these acts were legal, even if they were directed by (Francoist) state officials, particularly as Garzón convicted the PSOE government officials promoting the GAL assassination squads.

===Impartiality questions===
On 17 December 2010, Garzón challenged five of the seven Supreme Court justices that could be appointed to judge him for his activities in respect of the exhumation of Franco victims.

He alleges that Juan Saavedra, Adolfo Prego Oliver, Joaquin Giménez, Francisco and Juan Ramon Berdugo Monterde should be disqualified from officiating in any way because they have participated in pre-trial activities and thus may have an interest in the outcome that might affect their impartiality. These five judges have intervened in the investigation of the case, and the defence claims that consequently – and according to a strict interpretation of the principle of &quot;nemo iudex in causa sua&quot; – such intervention demonstrates these five judges an indirect interest in the outcome of the process.

The background to this case is that conservative opinion generally asserts that &quot;the dictatorship&quot; is past, and exhuming its less savoury activities is injurious to modern Spanish political interests (as may be Garzón&#x27;s extraterritorial attempts to accuse foreign nationals of crimes against humanity).

Certainly founding members of the People&#x27;s Party, such as Manuel Fraga, were members of Franco&#x27;s government, and there may be a fear that the more aggressively socialist opposition may wish to use these exhumations to imply thereby the intentions of modern Spanish political leaders may be less than entirely democratic, and that established political entities may seek to influence the course of justice (for example – between 2005 and 2010 – when the PP and PSOE denied the Spanish Senate the necessary majority to approve fresh judges for the Constitutional Court of Spain)

===Banco Santander corruption allegation===
The allegation is that Garzón dropped (adjourned &quot;sine die&quot;) a case against the director of Santander, Emilio Botín, in return for sponsorship by the bank of some university courses delivered in New York by Garzón between 2005 and 2006.

This appeal to the Supreme Court follows a charge previously closed by the criminal court on 27 November 2006, since the alleged 1.2 million euro fee was deemed by the lower court to be in fact 216,000 euros, which was not paid to Garzón, but to the university foundation.

The Supreme Court investigating judge insisted that there was clear evidence of wrongdoing involving some US$2.5 million, but, because the complaint was originally laid on 12 June 2009, but the last payment was made in May 2006 the three-year statute of limitations relating to the Supreme Court had been exceeded by 25 days. It was not clear why the case, previously archived by a provincial court on 27 November 2006 was not referred back to the lower court where a 15-year statute of limitations applies provided there is disclosure of &#x27;further and better evidence&#x27; which might then lead to a jury trial.

This Supreme Court corruption case against Garzón was closed on 13 February 2012, on the next-but-one working day after Garzón&#x27;s conviction for bugging the Gürtel corruption suspects.

===Supreme Court trial===
On 9 February 2012, the Supreme Court ruled that judge Baltasar Garzón was guilty of illegally ordering the placement of wiretaps in jailhouses to record conversations between inmates and their lawyers in a case of corruption. Under Spanish law, such wiretaps are only expressly permitted for terrorism cases and the legality of their use in other cases is more vague. The Supreme Court also barred Garzón from the legal profession for 11 years. The court said: &quot;Garzón&#x27;s methods are typical of totalitarian countries, without any respect of the right of defence.&quot;
Since Garzon can not appeal the charges, his career as a judge is likely to have ended. He was also fined €2,500. People protested the trial and ruling outside the court with banners calling for &quot;justice&quot; and photos of the people said to have been killed by the Franco regime. Many other judges also came out in support of Garzón.

Given the severity of the accusations against the Supreme Court, a large number of persons and institutions issued statements in support of the ruling. The progressive Judges for Democracy association stated that &quot;The Supreme Court and any other criminal court can only be asked to apply the law and respect the presumption of innocence. This must be both in determining the facts and in interpreting the norm. Whether or not one agrees with the Court&#x27;s decision and the interpretation on which it is founded, we must state that the Supreme Court has ruled in this context and should not be disqualified as such an institution for it.
Margarita Robles, member of the General Council of the Judiciary and former Subsecretary of State with the socialist government, said that the Supreme Court ruling was &quot;legally impeccable&quot; and had been produced as part of a procedure &quot;with all the guarantees.&quot;
It was later revealed that the Supreme Court had made a mistake in sentencing by overlooking the fact the Garzón had been suspended for nearly a year in the period 2010/2011 solely on the basis of his pending trial on a charge relating to his investigation of Francoist atrocities, a charge on which he was subsequently cleared.

==Allegations of politicisation of the judiciary==
In June 2010, Garzón was recruited as a consultant to the ICC.

At the end of October 2010, the re-election of Judge Juan Saavedra to the Spanish Supreme Court Penal Division reactivated the three judicial processes against Garzón. The re-appointment of a right-wing judge may have suggested to the Spanish legal authorities that the complaints had sufficient weight to merit continuing the domestic process despite the rulings in the European Court of Human Rights cited above.

The alleged &quot;political colonisation&quot; of the Spanish judiciary is an increasingly recurrent theme in the Spanish centre/left-wing media. More than 1,500 Spanish judges earlier this year criticised the influence of the major parties in the decisions of the Supreme Judicial Council (CGPJ) via a manifesto that for the first time exposed publicly what was claimed to be a long-standing open secret among Spanish lawyers.

In a 2011 book, Garzón wrote that he had at times exceeded the provisions of domestic Spanish legislation, but quoted external sources, including international treaties, to explain his behavior.

==Other work==
In July 2012, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange recruited the disbarred Garzón as head of his legal team.

In September 2012, Garzón wrote an article in &quot;The Journal Jurisprudence&quot; outlining his views on sexual violence during wartimes.

<text>Malta has participated in the Eurovision Song Contest 36 times since its debut in . The current Maltese participant broadcaster in the contest is the Public Broadcasting Services (PBS). Malta has yet to win the contest, but is the only non-winning country to have achieved four top three results.

Malta finished last on its first two attempts in and , and had a 16-year absence from the contest between and , when it returned. Malta has participated every year since. Malta&#x27;s return proved more successful, reaching the top 10 in 12 out of 15 contests from 1991 to 2005, including third-place results with &quot;Little Child&quot; performed by Mary Spiteri () and &quot;The One That I Love&quot; by Chiara () and second-place results with &quot;7th Wonder&quot; by Ira Losco () and &quot;Angel&quot; by Chiara (). Since finishing last for the third time in , Malta has struggled to make an impact, having achieved only two top 10 results in recent years: first being an eighth-place with &quot;Tomorrow&quot; by Gianluca Bezzina in , and a seventh-place with &quot;&quot; by Destiny Chukunyere in .

==History==
Malta first participated at the Eurovision Song Contest in 1971, although its history with the contest dates farther back. The Maltese Broadcasting Authority (MBA) gained associate European Broadcasting Union (EBU) membership on 1 January 1964 and it wrote a letter to the EBU enquiring about if it could participate as an associate member, but received no response. However, MBA still broadcast the 1964 contest. The MBA once again wrote to the EBU in 1965 asking if it could participate. This time the EBU responded but did not allow the MBA to participate in the contest as an associate member. On 1 January 1970, the MBA became an active member of the EBU and participation in the Eurovision Song Contest was possible for the first time. The MBA once again wrote to the EBU enquiring about its participation, but were informed that &quot;Since arrangements for the contest were already in an advanced stage&quot; they could not participate.

The MBA successfully participated at the contest for the first time in . The format for Malta&#x27;s national finals in the 70s consisted of the Malta Song Festival, which had been held annually in the country since 1960, acting as a semi-final with the highest placing songs going to the Song For Europe contest, where the winner would be chosen by a combination of jury and public votes. Malta&#x27;s first entry to Eurovision was &quot;Marija l-Maltija&quot; performed by Joe Grech. It scored 52 points and finished last out of 18 countries. Malta participated again in with &quot;L-imħabba&quot; by Helen &amp; Joseph. It scored 48 points and Malta came last for the second year in a row. The MBA had originally planned to participate in but due to complications behind their national final where the MBA deemed the participating songs to be &quot;below the European standard&quot;, it withdrew as they feared getting last for a third year in a row. Malta never applied for the contest as they feared getting another low result. Malta returned in and participated with the song &quot;Singing This Song&quot; by Renato. They scored 32 points and came 12th out of 19 countries. This was considered a success for Malta and enthusiasm for the contest in the Maltese music industry increased drastically. On 11 September 1975, the MBA announced their intention to participate in the and opened song submissions for their national final which closed on 15 October. However on 4 November, the MBA announced their withdrawal from the contest, citing that the participation fee had been drastically increased and Malta could not afford to participate. In a statement released on 20 November, the MBA said that it felt it was &quot;Under no obligation to take part in the Eurovision Song Contest year after year&quot; and Malta did not participate in the contest again until 1991.

Malta&#x27;s return to the contest by the Public Broadcasting Services (PBS) in , after a 16-year absence, proved to be more successful, with eight consecutive top 10 placings (1991–1998) and finishing in the top 10 in 12 out of 15 contests from 1991 to 2005. These results included third-place finishes in for Mary Spiteri and in for Chiara and second-place finishes in 2002 for Ira Losco and in for Chiara, who in became the first performer to represent Malta at three contests, finishing 22nd. Malta&#x27;s two second-places and two third-places make it the most successful country not to win the contest.

In the last 15 contests, Malta has only reached the top 10 twice, with Gianluca Bezzina finishing eighth in , and Destiny Chukunyere finishing seventh in . Fabrizio Faniello, who had previously finished ninth in , finished last in the final, and since then the country has failed to qualify from the semi-final round ten times, in , , , , , , , , , and . of which they finished bottom 3 in the semi-final in and , and last place in and .

Together with France, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom, Malta is one of the few countries that has not missed a contest since 1991. All of Malta&#x27;s entries since 1975 have been sung in its other official language, English, which it was one of the few countries allowed to use in the contest between 1977 and 1999, being a former British colony which (as seen below) has had a close relationship with the UK within the contest. The only uses of the Maltese language have been three lines in the 2000 entry &quot;Desire&quot; by Claudette Pace and the repetition of the Maltese word for singing — Kant — in their 2025 entry. Also, along with Croatia and Sweden it was the only country never to be relegated, under the previous rules of the contest, that was not a part of the &quot;Big Four&quot;.

==Selection process==

Malta uses a televised national final to select its entry. From its debut in 1971 through 1976, Malta Song Festival, an existing song festival that had been created in 1960 was used to select the entrant, with the winner going to represent the country at the Eurovision Song Contest. Malta did not participate in the contest between 1977 and 1990. Since its return in 1991, national finals under various names were held to select the entry, including &quot;Malta Song for Europe&quot; (), &quot;Malta Eurovision Song Contest&quot;, and &quot;Malta Eurosong&quot;. During this time period, the organization of the event was taken over by the PBS.

A typical Maltese national final would consist of: the rules for submissions by composers, authors, and singers being published in October, first elimination rounds in December, and semi-finalists announced in January. The semi-final would then be held in February, followed two days later by a final to choose Malta&#x27;s representative at the contest. In 2009, a new format of the contest was introduced, the Malta Eurosong contest, with eight semi-finals held over November 2008 to January 2009, and a final of 20 songs competing in February. In 2010 six semi-finals were held over December 2009 and January 2010, and a final was once again held in February 2010. This format was discontinued for the 2019 and 2020 contests, with PBS instead using X Factor Malta to select the artist. The national final format returned for the 2022 contest.

<text>Kajukenbo (Japanese: カジュケンボ) is a hybrid martial art from Hawaii. It was developed in the late 1940s and founded in 1947 in the Palama Settlement on Oahu, Territory of Hawaii.

Kajukenbo training incorporates a blend of striking, kicking, throwing, takedowns, joint locks and weapon disarmament.

Today, Kajukenbo is practiced all over the world in many different branches. In contrast to many traditional martial arts, students are not required to mimic their teacher, but are encouraged to develop their own &quot;expression&quot; of the art after they first master the system.

==Etymology==
The name Kajukenbo is a combination of the various arts from which its style is derived. The name of the system has been derived from the beginnings of the names of the styles that had become components of kajukenbo:
* KA from Japanese and Korean karate (Tang Soo Do)
* JU from Japanese judo and jujutsu.
* KEN from kenpo and/or the Japanese word for Fist.
* BO from Western boxing, as well as Chinese boxing (Quan Fa).

== History ==
===1945-1959===
In the late 1940s, the Palama Settlement was a violent area. Because of this environment, five martial artists from varying backgrounds, initially known as the &quot;Black Belt Society&quot;, came together with the goal of developing an art that would be practical and effective on the street. These founders sought to develop one style that would complement each of their individual styles and yet allow for effective fighting at a greater variety of ranges and speeds.

The five founding members of Kajukenbo were:
* Adriano D. Emperado — Kosho Shorei-Ryū Kenpo, Arnis and Ng Ying Kung Fu
* Joseph Holck — Kodokan Judo
* Peter Young Yil Choo — Tang Soo Do (Moo Duk Kwan), Boxing and Shotokan Karate
* Frank F. Ordonez — Sekeino Jujutsu
* Clarence Chang — Sil-Lum Pai Gongfu (Ng Ying Kung Fu and Chin Na)

Of the five, Adriano Directo Emperado is often attributed to be the founder. In its conception, the founders followed a simple rule: if a technique worked consistently on the street (or against one another), then it stayed in the system; if it did not, it was discarded. This allowed the style to maintain its self-defense focus, while covering limitations found within each of their traditional arts.

For two years (1945-1947) these five teachers put their knowledge into practice, rehearsing every day possible situations of aggression in real life. Furthermore, it was designed to exemplify the best aspects of American culture, such as courage, pragmatism and deep personal conviction, all the while maintaining the rich cultures of their individual Asian heritages. Later they decided to call this system kajukenbo (referring to the initials of the martial arts that compose it) and created the Black Belt Society.

Initially, the school that would become the first Kajukenbo school was run by Windel McCandels in Palama Settlement, Honolulu. After having studied under William Chow, Emperado had studied under McCandels. After McCandles had died, Emperado took control of the school and renamed it &quot;Palama Settlement Kajukenbo Self-Defenses Institute of Karate.&quot;

Shortly after its conception, the Korean War broke out, and with it Joe Holck, Peter Choo, Frank Ordonez, and Clarence Chang left Hawaii on active military service, leaving only Adriano Emperado to continue teaching the system. Although Adriano Emperado was the listed as the chief instructor of Kajukenbo Institute, most of the instruction was handled by his younger brother, Joseph &quot;Joe&quot; Emperado.

After the death of Joseph Emperado, the Kajukenbo Institute fell in chaos, causing 14 Black Belt-level instructors to leave the school after the week of his death. The Institute remained remaining inoperable for 3 months, until classes eventually restarted under the instruction of Joe Delacruz and Adriano Emperado.

In 1958, over time the teachings moved to the Pacific Coast of the United States, specifically to a student from the institute, Aleju Reyes, who opened the first school outside the Hawaiian Islands, at the Travis Air Force Base (in California). One of his students was Richard Peralta, who started kajukenbo in 1959. That same year, Adriano Emperado integrated wushu techniques into kajukenbo, turning his art into a fluid combination of hard and soft techniques.

===After 1959===

Charles Gaylord, Tony Ramos, and Aleju Reyes, who had received their black belts from Emperado, passed down kajukenbo in the United States. Each of them opened their own kajukenbo school in California. With first being Tony Ramos in 1960, and followed by Reyes, Gaylord, Joe Halbuna. In 1965 Al Dacascos would follow.

In 1967 Charles Gaylord, along with other accomplished Kajukenbo practitioners Aleju Reyes, Joe Halbuna, Tony Ramos, and Al Dacascos formed the Kajukenbo Association of America (KAA.) 

===Kajukenbo in present===

Kajukenbo continues to evolve with each generation and maintains its primary focus on realism and practicality. There are usually martial arts schools that will change along with time to fit into the day&#x27;s society. It is generally thought that &quot;unfair&quot; moves, such as strikes to the eyes or groin, are perfectly acceptable, as is whatever else the practitioner feels is necessary to get home that day.

Currently, Kajukenbo includes more grappling techniques and more throws than other Kenpo schools. The curriculum include different counterattacks against punches, knives, sticks, firearms and grappling.

Certain Kajukenbo schools direct attention to 26 fundamental forms (&quot;Kata&quot;). These Kata had been divided into 13 &quot;Pinyans&quot; and 13 &quot;Concentrations&quot;. Each one has its own specific name: for example, the first one is called &quot;crane strike/tiger&#x27;s claw&quot;. The name of each &quot;Concentration&quot; describes its characteristic movement. So, the first concentration includes a crane strike and a tiger claw. These sequences are incorporated into Kajukenbo to enhance the student&#x27;s skills. Each movement in these forms has its own meaning. For example, the first beat in &quot;Pinyan 1&quot; is a right outside strike that moves into the backbend position during the beat. This motion can be applied to block a blow with a punch. These sequences also focus on combat that faces more than one opponent.

==Features==

Training workouts emphasize cardio conditioning and functional strength. While individual schools may show variation, it would not be unusual to train with sandbags or boxing gloves. There are core self-defense techniques at the heart of Kajukenbo and Kajukenbo schools discourages impractical and flashy moves. Most Kajukenbo curricula feature counter-attacks to punches, kicks, grabs, as well as using knives, sticks and guns to counter back. While this base of common knowledge will keep schools&#x27; styles similar, there is plenty of room for variation. This openness tends to encourage schools to incorporate other arts into their practice. The primary concentration of all Kajukenbo schools remains real world self-defense.

==Ranking==

Ranking hierarchies vary widely from school to school.

Traditional Japanese martial art ranking is often followed. One common belt order is as follows: white, yellow, orange, purple, blue, green, brown, and black, followed by the other various degrees of the black belt. The schools have second and third stripe belts that feature a white for second or black for third stripe running down the center of the belt.

Black belt rankings and titles can also vary, with most schools adopting either Chinese or Japanese titles.

==Official branches==

===Original Method===
Kajukenbo &quot;Emperado Method&quot; or &quot;Traditional Hard Style&quot;.

===Tum Pai===
The original style of Tum Pai might have been put together by Adriano D. Emperado, Al Dacascos and Al Dela Cruz in the early 60s to create an advanced style for the Kajukenbo system. In the mid-60s the developments that made up Tum Pai became incorporated into what was called &quot;Chu&#x27;an Fa&quot;. In 1971 Jon A. Loren started incorporating the concepts of tai chi and Southern Sil-lum into his Kajukenbo classes. This was called Northern Kajukenbo until 1976. In 1976, while staying with Emperado in Hawaii, he demonstrated his concepts and techniques and asked if he could call it &quot;Tum Pai&quot; and bring the name back to life. Emperado granted permission with the acknowledgment that the original Tum Pai followed a different path than the revised Tum Pai soft style. The name Tum Pai, which means &quot;central way&quot;, fits the tai chi concept blended into the Kajukenbo format.

===Chu&#x27;an Fa===
In Hawaii during the early 1960s Adriano Emperado, along with students Al Dacascos and Al Dela Cruz, incorporated innovations of the style Tum Pai and other martial arts into their Kajukenbo training. Later it became obvious that they were no longer doing Tum Pai and it would have to be named something else. In the mid 60s Al Dacascos moved to Northern California and continued training in the Northern and Southern styles of Sil-lum Kung Fu to enhance his Kajukenbo training. It was in 1965 that the name &quot;Chu&#x27;an Fa&quot; was introduced.

===Wun Hop Kuen Do===
Wun Hop Kuen Do was founded by Al Dacascos, father of martial artists and actor Mark Dacascos, who also practice the art. In Cantonese Chinese Wun Hop Kuen Do means &quot;combination fist art style&quot;. Wun Hop Kuen Do techniques identify with, and are based on, the Kajukenbo system.

== Associations and groups ==

===Emperado&#x27;s Kajukenbo Self Defense Institute Worldwide Inc.===
Founded by Sijo Adriano Emperado, it exists as an umbrella aiming to bring all branches of Kajukenbo under Sijo&#x27;s umbrella. The KSDI is currently under the administration of GM Kimo Emperado with deputy administrator GM Glen Fraticelli.

===Kajukenbo Association of America===
In 1967 Charles Gaylord, along with other Kajukenbo practitioners Aleju Reyes, Joe Halbuna, Tony Ramos, John Ramos and Al Dacascos formed the Kajukenbo Association of America (KAA.) The KAA organization lasted until the early 1970s, but it was brought back in 1980 under the leadership of Charles Gaylord. Fifteen years later in September 1995, the KAA&#x27;s black belts promoted Charles Gaylord to the honorary rank of 10th degree black belt. Grandmaster Gaylord&#x27;s traditional Kajukenbo curriculum continues to be taught by his chief instructors who operate Kajukenbo schools in Hawaii and other parts of the United States and the world, including countries like Japan.

===World Wide Kajukenbo Federation===
The World Wide Kajukenbo Federation is headed by Senior Grandmaster Hemenes, along with an executive board of Prof Alsarraf in Kuwait, Senior Grandmaster Robert New in Hawaii and Grandmaster Jimmy Willis in the USA. The World Wide Kajukenbo Federation is a highly progressive form of Kajukenbo that promotes not just self defence, street combatives training but has also produced champions in forms &amp; points fighting and also trains MMA &amp; Sanda competitors.

Hemenes&#x27; legitimacy has often been questioned, as his 8th degree promotion was given by someone with no more than an honorary Kajukenbo rank, and his 9th degree/grandmastership promotion was headed by a man who had been kicked out of Kajukenbo decades earlier due to alleged crimes.

==In popular fiction==
The 1982 children&#x27;s book &quot;A Bundle of Sticks,&quot; by Pat Rhoads Mauser, is the story of a fifth-grade boy Ben Tyler, who is being bullied by a much larger boy named Boyd Bradshaw. One day Ben comes home from school with a badly bruised nose, so Ben&#x27;s parents decide to enroll him in a Kajukenbo martial arts school. Ben reluctantly agrees to attend the school because his mother has already paid the instructor who is known only as Sifu. At first Ben thinks he will not enjoy Kajukenbo, but he eventually discovers how valuable his training is when he successfully defends himself from Boyd.

<text>Parihaka is a community in the Taranaki region of New Zealand, located between Mount Taranaki and the Tasman Sea. In the 1870s and 1880s the settlement, then reputed to be the largest Māori village in New Zealand, became the centre of a major campaign of non-violent resistance to European occupation of confiscated land in the area. Armed soldiers were sent in and arrested the peaceful resistance leaders and many of the Maori residents, often holding them in jail for months without trials.

The village was founded about 1866 by Māori chiefs Te Whiti o Rongomai and Tohu Kākahi on land seized by the government during the post-New Zealand Wars land confiscations of the 1860s. The population of the village grew to more than 2,000, attracting Māori who had been dispossessed of their land by confiscations and impressing European visitors with its cleanliness and industry, and its extensive cultivations producing cash crops as well as food sufficient to feed its inhabitants.

When an influx of European settlers in Taranaki created a demand for farmland that outstripped the availability, the Grey government stepped up efforts to secure title to land it had confiscated but subsequently not taken up for settlement. From 1876 some Māori in Taranaki accepted &quot;no fault&quot; payments called &quot;takoha&quot; compensation, while some &quot;hapū&quot;, or sub-tribal groups, outside the confiscation zone took the government&#x27;s payments to allow surveying and settlement. Māori near Parihaka and the Waimate Plains rejected the payments, however, the government responded by drawing up plans to take the land by force. In late 1878 the government began surveying the land and offering it for sale. Te Whiti and Tohu responded with a series of non-violent campaigns in which they first ploughed settlers&#x27; farmland and later erected fences across roadways to impress upon the government their right to occupy the confiscated land to which they believed they still had rights, given the government&#x27;s failure to provide the reserves it had promised. The campaigns sparked a series of arrests, resulting in more than 400 Māori being jailed in the South Island, where they remained without trial for as long as 16 months with the aid of a series of new repressive laws.

As fears grew among white settlers that the resistance campaign was a prelude to renewed armed conflict, the Hall government began planning a military assault at Parihaka to close it down. Pressured by Native Minister John Bryce, the government finally acted in late October 1881 while the sympathetic Governor was out of the country. Led by Bryce, on horseback, 1,600 troops and cavalry entered the village at dawn on 5 November 1881. The soldiers were greeted with hundreds of skipping and singing children offering them food. Te Whiti and Tohu were arrested and jailed for 16 months, 1,600 Parihaka inhabitants were expelled and dispersed throughout Taranaki without food or shelter and the remaining 600 residents were issued with government passes to control their movement. Soldiers looted and destroyed most of the buildings at Parihaka. Land that had been promised as reserves by a commission of inquiry into land confiscations was later seized and sold to cover the cost of crushing Te Whiti&#x27;s resistance, while others were leased to European settlers, shutting Māori out of involvement in the decisions over land use.

In a major 1996 report, the Waitangi Tribunal claimed the events at Parihaka provided a graphic display of government antagonism to any show of Māori political independence. It noted: &quot;A vibrant and productive Māori community was destroyed and total State control of all matters Māori, with full power over the Māori social order, was sought.&quot; Historian Hazel Riseborough also believed the central issue motivating the invasion was &quot;mana&quot;: &quot;Europeans were concerned about their superiority and dominance which, it seemed to them, could be assured only by destroying Te Whiti&#x27;s &quot;mana&quot;. As long as he remained at Parihaka he constituted a threat to European supremacy in that he offered his people an alternative to the way of life the European sought to impose on them.&quot;

The Parihaka International Peace Festival has been held annually there since 2006.

==Marae==

The local Parihaka marae now features the Rangikapuia, Te Niho, Toroānui and Mahikuare meeting houses. It is a tribal meeting ground for the Taranaki hapū of Ngāti Haupoto and Ngāti Moeahu.

In October 2020, the Government committed $457,693 from the Provincial Growth Fund to upgrade the Toroānui meeting house, creating 6 jobs.

==Settlement==

The Parihaka settlement was founded about 1866, at the close of the Second Taranaki War and a year after almost all Māori land in Taranaki had been confiscated by the Government to punish &quot;rebel&quot; Māori. The settlement was established by a Māori chief and veteran of the Taranaki wars, Te Whiti o Rongomai, as a means of distancing themselves from European contact and association with warlike groups of Māori. The pā was set in sight of Mt Taranaki and the sea, in a clearing ringed by low hills and beside a stream known as Waitotoroa (water of long blood). He was joined by a fellow chief, Tohu Kākahi and a close kinsman, Te Whetu. Later that year King Tāwhiao sent 12 &quot;apostles&quot; to live at Parihaka to strengthen the bonds between the Waikato and Taranaki Māori who were opposed to further land sales to the government or white settlers. Within a year the settlement had grown to house more than 100 large thatched whare (houses) around two marae and by 1871 the population was reported to be 300. The Taranaki Medical Officer visited in 1871 and reported food in abundance, good cookhouses and an absence of disease. It was the cleanest, best-kept pā he had ever visited and its inhabitants &quot;the finest race of men I have ever seen in New Zealand&quot;. Large meetings were held monthly, where Te Whiti warned of increasing levels of bribery and corruption to coerce Māori to sell their land, yet European visitors continued to be welcomed with dignity, courtesy and hospitality.

By the end of the 1870s, it had a population of about 1500 and was being described as the most populous and prosperous Māori settlement in the country. It had its own police force, bakery and bank, used advanced agricultural machinery, and organised large teams who worked the coast and bush to harvest enough seafood and game to feed the thousands who came to the meetings. When journalists visited Parihaka in October 1881, a month before the brutal government raid that destroyed it, they found &quot;square miles of potato, melon and cabbage fields around Parihaka; they stretched on every side, and acres and acres of the land show the results of great industry and care&quot;. The village was described as &quot;an enormous native town of quiet and imposing character&quot; with &quot;regular streets of houses&quot;.

==Land pressures==

In June 1868 hostilities resumed in Taranaki as a Ngāti Ruanui chief, Riwha Tītokowaru, launched a series of effective raids on settlers and government troops in an effort to block the occupation of Māori land. Te Whiti remained neutral during the nine-month-long war, neither helping nor hindering Tītokowaru. When the war ended with Titokowaru&#x27;s withdrawal in March 1869, Te Whiti declared the year to be &quot;te tau o te takahanga&quot;, &quot;the year of the trampling underfoot&quot;, during which kings, queens, governors and governments would be trampled by Parihaka. He told a meeting there would be a new era of &quot;fighting peace&quot; with no surrender of land and no loss of independence. He also declared that because they had remained independent during the recent war, the confiscation of their land for being &quot;rebellious British subjects&quot; was unjust, invalid and void. Te Whiti&#x27;s announcement at the meeting was reported to Premier Edward Stafford by Taranaki Land Purchase Officer Robert Reid Parris, who described him as &quot;this young chief whose influence was strong in the province and with Tawhiao&quot;.

In 1872 the Government acknowledged that although all Māori land in Taranaki had been confiscated, most of it had effectively fallen back into Māori ownership because so little had been settled by Europeans. As a result, the Government began buying back the land, including reserves and land given as compensation for wrongful confiscation.

As Te Whiti continued to reject the offers, however, European anger towards Parihaka grew, fuelling calls for his &quot;dangerous&quot; movement to be suppressed. Newspapers and government agents that had earlier praised him as peaceful and amiable began describing him as a &quot;fanatic&quot; who gave &quot;rambling&quot;, &quot;unintelligible&quot; and &quot;blasphemous&quot; speeches, producing a &quot;baneful influence&quot;.

By the mid-1870s, Taranaki was enjoying a rapid growth in immigration, with the founding of Inglewood and other farming towns, the creation of inland roads as far south as Stratford and a rail link from New Plymouth to Waitara. In mid-1878, as the provincial government pressured the Government for more land, Colonial Treasurer John Ballance advocated the survey and sale by force of the Waimate Plains of South Taranaki. Cabinet members expected to raise £500,000 for government coffers from the sale. In June Premier Sir George Grey and Native Minister John Sheehan held a big meeting at Waitara to dispense &quot;gifts&quot; including tinned fruits and jam, alcohol, clothing and perfume to Taranaki chiefs willing to sell. Neither Te Whiti nor Tawhiao attended, so Sheehan visited Parihaka and then the Waimate Plains, where he appeared to have persuaded Tītokowaru to permit land to be surveyed on the proviso that burial places, cultivations and fishing grounds would be respected and that fenced reserves would be created.

Māori unease mounted as the surveying progressed, with little sign of the promised reserves. In February 1879 surveyors began cutting lines through cultivations and fences and trampling cash crops and also ran a road into Tītokowaru&#x27;s own settlement. Māori retaliated by uprooting kilometres of survey pegs. Sheehan rode to Parihaka to justify the government&#x27;s actions, but left after being verbally abused by Te Whiti. The next day, 24 March 1879, Te Whiti ordered his men to remove all the surveyors from the Waimate Plains. Though the surveyors would not leave of their own accord, the Māori quietly packed up each survey camp, loaded horses and drays and carted everything back across the Waingongoro River, between Manaia and Hāwera.

Hectored by the settler press, which claimed extra farmland was needed and that &quot;these lands should no longer be retained by turbulent, semi-barbarous people, too idle to put them to any use&quot;, the Government on 26 March began advertising the sale of the first of the Waimate Plains. On 24 April it announced the sale was postponed indefinitely. Sheehan determined to find out what had been promised to Māori and whether this was the cause of the interruption to the survey. Still, however, the Government refused to confirm its promise of reserves.

Monthly meetings at Parihaka attracted Māori from all over New Zealand and let was set aside for each tribe to have its own &quot;marae&quot;, meeting house and cluster of &quot;whares&quot; throughout the village. As the population grew, so did the industriousness, with cultivations over a wider area and more than 100 bullocks, 10 horses and 44 carts in use. Yet the gatherings continued to disturb settlers, who in late May called on Grey to boost Taranaki&#x27;s armed constabulary, claiming they were &quot;living in a condition of constant menace&quot;, in fear of their lives and &quot;utterly at the mercy of the Natives&quot;. Māori in Ōpunake had begun ploughing up and fencing off settlers&#x27; fields, and threatening to take over the flour mill. Residents at Hawera were convinced war would be commenced &quot;at any moment&quot; and the &quot;Patea Mail&quot; urged a new &quot;war of extermination&quot; be waged against the Māori: &quot;Justice demands these bloodthirsty fanatics should be returned to the dust ... the time has come, in our minds, when New Zealand must strike for freedom, and this means the death blow to the Māori race.&quot;

==First resistance: The Ploughmen==

On 26 May 1879 those bullocks and horses began to be put to use ploughing long furrows through the grassland of white settler farmers – first at Ōakura and later throughout Taranaki, from Hāwera in the south to Pukearuhe in the north. Most of the land had earlier been confiscated from Māori. Te Whiti insisted the ploughing was directed not against the settlers, but to force a declaration of policy from the Government, but farmers were incensed, threatening to shoot the ploughmen and their horses if they did not desist. Magistrates in Patea County advised Grey that Māori had 10 days to stop &quot;molesting property&quot; or they would be &quot;shot down&quot;, while MP Major Harry Atkinson encouraged farmers to enrol as volunteers and militia soldiers. He promised to upgrade their rifles and was reported in the &quot;Taranaki Herald&quot; as saying &quot;he hoped if war did come, the natives would be exterminated&quot;. At Hawera a group of 100 armed vigilantes confronted ploughmen, but were talked out of violence by those they had come to threaten.

On 29 June the armed constabulary began arresting the ploughmen. Large squads pounced on the ploughing parties, who offered no resistance. Dozens a day were arrested, but their places were immediately taken by others who had travelled from as far away as Waikanae. Te Whiti directed that those of the greatest &quot;mana&quot;, or prestige, should be the first to put their hands to the ploughshares, so among the first arrested were the prominent figures Tītokowaru, Te Iki and Matakatea. As Taranaki jails became full, ploughmen were sent to the Mt Cook barracks in Wellington. By August almost 200 prisoners had been taken. By then, however, the protest action seemed to be having some success, with Sheehan, the Native Minister, telling Parliament on 23 July: &quot;I was not aware ...what the exact position of those lands on the west coast was. It has only been made clear to us by the interruption of the surveys. It turns out that from the White Cliffs to Waitōtara the whole country is strewn with unfulfilled promises.&quot; A former Native Minister, Dr Daniel Pollen, also warned of the consequences of firmer government action against the Parihaka ploughmen: &quot;I warn my honourable friend that there are behind Te Whiti not two hundred men, but a great many times two hundred men.&quot; All the prisons of New Zealand would not be big enough to hold them, he warned.

On 10 August leading pro-government chiefs issued a proclamation to all tribes of New Zealand calling on the government to halt surveys of disputed lands and on Māori to end their action in claiming those lands. The proclamation also proposed testing the legality of the confiscations in the Supreme Court. Te Whiti agreed to a truce and by the end of the month the ploughing ended.

==Imprisonment==

The first 40 ploughmen were brought before court in July, charged with malicious injury to property, forcible entry and riot. They were sentenced to two months&#x27; hard labour and ordered to either pay a £600 surety for 12 months&#x27; good behaviour following their release or—if they could not raise the money—be imprisoned in Dunedin jail for 12 months. The Government declined to lay charges against any of the remaining 180 protesters, but also refused to release them. Colonial Minister and Defence Minister Colonel George S. Whitmore, who had led colonial forces against Titokowaru in 1868–69, admitted it was necessary to bend the law to keep the protesters incarcerated, fearing they would be released by the Supreme Court if they went on trial. The Grey government was on the point of collapse following a series of no-confidence motions, but to provide a legal backing for its move rushed the Maori Prisoners&#x27; Trial Bill through both Houses on the final day of its session in office, Whitmore justifying the haste by claiming the &quot;actual safety of the country and of the lives and property of its loyal subjects&quot; was at stake. No translation of the legislation was provided, despite protests by Māori MPs. The new law provided that the detainees were to be brought to trial anywhere in the colony on a date nominated by the Governor within 30 days of the opening of the next session of parliament.

The new Hall Government was formed in October 1879 and promptly introduced more legislation to deal with the &quot;Parihaka question&quot;. On 19 December the Confiscated Land Inquiry and Maori Prisoners&#x27; Trials Act was passed into law. The Act provided for an &quot;inquiry into alleged grievances of Aboriginal Natives in relation to certain lands taken by the Crown&quot;—the confiscated territory in Taranaki—and it also enabled the Governor to postpone the trials of the Māori prisoners, who had been scheduled to appear at the Supreme Court in Wellington in late December. John Bryce, the new Native Minister, told Parliament he did not attach much importance to the idea of inquiring into Māori grievances; Sheehan, his predecessor, admitted there were many unfulfilled promises and that the west coast people had enough grievances to justify what they had done, but said it was in their interests to suffer &quot;mild confinement&quot; until the government had settled the question.

A new trial date was set—5 April 1880 in Wellington—but in January 1880 the government quietly moved all the prisoners to the South Island, incarcerating them in jails in Dunedin, Hokitika, Lyttelton and Ripapa Island in Canterbury. The move prompted Hōne Tāwhai, the member for Northern Maori, to remark: &quot;I cannot help thinking that they must have been taken there in order that they might be got rid of, and that they might perish there.&quot; In late March the trial date was put back to 5 July; in late June it was moved again to 26 July.

Many of the prisoners had already been in jail for 13 months when, on 14 July 1880 Bryce introduced the Maori Prisoners&#x27; Bill designed to postpone their trial indefinitely. Bryce, who prided himself on plain talk, told Parliament it was &quot;a farce to talk of trying these prisoners for the offences for which they were charged ... if they had been convicted in all probability they would not have got more than 24 hours&#x27; imprisonment. In the Bill we drop that provision in regard to the trial altogether.&quot; The new legislation declared that all those in jail were now deemed to have been lawfully arrested and to be in lawful custody and decreed that &quot;no Court, Judge, Justices of the Peace or other person shall during the continuance of this Act discharge, bail or liberate the said Natives&quot;.

Sheehan, meanwhile, claimed Te Whiti&#x27;s people were wavering and would soon break up, while Bryce declared the end game was within sight: &quot;I fully expect, in the course of next summer, to see hundreds of settlers on these plains.&quot;

==West Coast Commission==
In January 1880, a month after the government provided for an inquiry into grievances over west coast land confiscations and allegations of broken promises, Governor Sir Hercules Robinson appointed MP Hone Tawhai, former premier Sir William Fox and pastoralist and former cabinet minister Sir Francis Dillon Bell as members of the West Coast Commission, with Fox as its chairman. Tawhai resigned before hearings began, claiming his fellow commissioners were not impartial and had been the &quot;very men who had created the trouble on the West Coast&quot;. Fox and Bell had both served as Native Minister, owned vast areas of land and supported confiscation. Tawhai may also have been stung by Te Whiti&#x27;s description of the commission as &quot;two pākehā and a dog&quot;.

Hearings began at Oeo, South Taranaki, in February, but were immediately boycotted by Te Whiti&#x27;s followers when the commission refused to travel to Parihaka to hold discussions. Historian Dick Scott has claimed Fox, who had already expressed in writing his wish that the Waimate Plains be sold and settled, was appointed chairman of the commission on the proviso that he support the government&#x27;s land policies in the area and secure central Taranaki for white settlement. Correspondence to Premier John Hall shows that Fox thought it futile to give a hearing to &quot;every Native who thinks he has a grievance&quot; and was keen to ensure commission hearings did not delay road-building works in the Waimate Plains that could be carried out in summer.

Fox insisted that no survey of land around Parihaka should take place until the commission had made a report. Bryce agreed that central Taranaki would not be entered, apart from the completion of necessary road repairs. In April, however, he found just such a necessity, directing that 550 armed soldiers–mostly unemployed men newly recruited with the promise of free land–would begin &quot;repairing&quot; a new road that would lead directly to Parihaka. His force marched from Oeo to set up camp near Parihaka. A stockade and camp were established at Rahotu, a redoubt and blockhouse at Pungarehu and an armed camp at Waikino to the north. The land around Parihaka began to be surveyed and work began, from both northern and southern approaches, on a coast road between New Plymouth and Hawera. Apart from offering food to the soldiers, Māori continued their daily life as if the surveyors did not exist. In its 1996 report on Taranaki land confiscations, the Waitangi Tribunal noted that Bryce was a Taranaki war veteran who &quot;clearly retained his relish of warfare ... on his own admission, he had always desired a march on Parihaka in order to destroy it.&quot; The tribunal claimed his later actions were &quot;so provocative that, in our view, he was also endeavouring to recreate hostilities.&quot;

In their first interim report, released in March 1880, Fox and Bell acknowledged the puzzle of why the land had been confiscated when its owners had never taken up arms against the government, although they had made plain from the outset that they would not allow submissions on the validity of the confiscations. They recommended the delineation of a &quot;broad continuous belt of reserve&quot; of about on the Waimate Plains and a further reserve of 20,000 to 25,000 acres for the Parihaka people—&quot;so long as they live there in peace&quot;. A second interim report was released on 14 July, followed by the third and final report on 5 August. This last report expressed the commissioners&#x27; wish &quot;to do justice to the Natives&quot; and also to continue &quot;English settlement of the country&quot;. It urged the government to fulfill the promises made by successive ministries, then recommended that the Crown retain the section of the Parihaka block between the new road and the coast (the area of best arable land) but return the rest of the Parihaka block to Te Whiti and his people. The commissioners also made it clear that no act of Te Whiti&#x27;s between the ploughing in 1879 and the fencing in 1880 could &quot;fairly be called hostile&quot;. Bryce, who had strongly opposed the work of the commissioners and resented their influence, was dismissive of their report in his parliamentary address on it and gave no suggestion he would implement the recommendations.

==Further resistance: The Fencers==

In June 1880, meanwhile, the road reached Parihaka and on Bryce&#x27;s instruction, the Armed Constabulary broke fences around the large Parihaka cultivations, exposing their cash crops to wandering stock, crossed cultivations and looted Māori property. &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; reported the next Māori tactic as surveying began there: &quot;Our position is a very unhappy one. We assign reserves for natives ... indicate (sites for) European settlement. The natives reply by building houses, fencing, planting and occupying our camping grounds.&quot; As soldiers and surveyors cut down fences and marked out road lines across fields of crops, Māori just as quickly rebuilt the fences across the roads. When soldiers pulled them down, Māori put them back up again, refusing to answer questions about who was directing them. When Te Whetu threatened in July 1880 to cut down telegraph poles, he was arrested with eight other men and taken to New Plymouth. For the Government, it was the beginning of a new campaign in which fencers were arrested, often being dragged off by force as they continued work on building fences. According to the Waitangi Tribunal, the arrests were invalid: the land was not Crown land and therefore it was the army, not Māori, who were trespassing. Nor were the actions of the Māori fencers a criminal activity. Yet the number of arrests grew daily and Māori began to travel from other parts of the country, including Waikato and Wairarapa, to provide more manpower. In one incident 300 fencers arrived at the roadline near Pungarehu, dug up the road, sowed it in wheat and constructed a fence, with a newspaper reporting: &quot;They looked like an immense swarm of bees or an army of locusts, moving with a steady and uninterrupted movement across the face of the earth. As each portion was finished they set up a shout and a song of derision.&quot;

The Government responded with the Maori Prisoners&#x27; Detention Act (enacted 6 August, the day after the West Commission released its final report) to keep all the prisoners in detention, and then, on 1 September 1880, the even harsher West Coast Settlement (North Island) Act, which widened the powers of arrest and provided for two years&#x27; jail with hard labour–with the offender released only if he paid a surety nominated by the court. Arrests could be made for anyone even suspected of &quot;endangering the peace&quot; by digging, ploughing or disturbing the surface of the land, or erecting or dismantling a fence. Governor Robinson regarded the legislation as necessary in the Māoris&#x27; own interests and said it was &quot;devised for the purpose of averting another Maori war&quot;, but Grey said the law &quot;amounted to a general warrant for the apprehension of all persons ... for offences which were not named at all – in fact they might be arrested for no offence.&quot;

By September about 150 fencers had been detained and sent to South Island jails and the adult male ranks at Parihaka were so depleted, the constabulary were often manhandling young boys and old men, whose fences were often only symbolic, consisting of sticks and branches. When a group of 59 Māori appeared in the District Court in New Plymouth on 23 September for trial on charges of having unlawfully obstructed the free passage of a thoroughfare, a jury of 12 settlers deliberated for 45 minutes before returning to say they could not agree on a verdict. Judge Shaw told the jurors that if they convicted the accused, he might choose to sentence them &quot;to only an hour&#x27;s imprisonment&quot; and bind them over to keep the peace &quot;for only a nominal time&quot;. He told the jurors that if they did not produce a verdict within an hour he would lock them up for the night. They deliberated for just minutes before returning with a guilty verdict. The judge immediately sentenced the fencers to two years&#x27; imprisonment with hard labour at Lyttelton jail, plus a requirement for each to find a £50 surety to keep the peace for six months.

From that date there were no more arrests. The cost of the operation had grown too much: while the land being taken was estimated at £750,000, the costs of the operation in South Taranaki had already exceeded £1 million. The bloody clashes between armed soldiers and unarmed Māori building fences on their own land, as well as the increasing numbers of deaths in custody in the freezing South Island jails, were already attracting the attention of the British House of Commons and newspapers in Europe. In New Zealand, however, the plight of more than 400 political prisoners – equally divided between ploughmen and fencers – attracted scant press coverage. Only when about 100 prisoners were finally released from South Island jails in November 1880 did newspapers begin to report on the deaths in jail, the terms of solitary confinement and tales of gross overcrowding in cells. Reporters noted that some prisoners at Lyttelton jail were terminally ill, while others were &quot;in a very critical state and scarcely able to walk&quot;.

Bryce unsuccessfully sought to impose conditions on the men as they were released, including their acceptance of reserves. The remaining 300 prisoners were released in the first six months of 1881. As they returned to Taranaki they learned that the Government had decided to survey and sell four-fifths of the Waimate Plains and , or more than half, of the Parihaka block. Parihaka, in fact, was to be carved into three sections, with the seaward and inland on the village marked for pākehā settlement and the Māori left with a strip in between. Bryce vowed that &quot;English homesteads would be established at the very doors of (Te Whiti&#x27;s) house&quot;. In January 1881 Bryce resigned as Native Minister, angry at the lack of government support for his plans to invade Parihaka and close the settlement.

The sell-off of central Taranaki continued, however, and in June 1881, with most of the Waimate Plains auctioned off, the Commissioner of Crown Lands sold of the Parihaka block for just over £2.10.0 an acre, with still no reserves marked out. Despite the sale, Māori at Parihaka continued to clear, fence and cultivate the land, regardless of whether it had been surveyed and sold, with their persistence leading to the use of more than 200 Armed Constabulary to pull down fences, which in turn prompted a pursuit by Māori armed with sticks. By September newspapers were reporting that &quot;certain quarters&quot; were persisting in working up a scare campaign, suggesting Te Whiti was fortifying Parihaka and preparing to invade New Plymouth, while the &quot;Taranaki Herald&quot; reported that the settlement was &quot;in a horribly filthy state&quot; and its inhabitants &quot;in a deplorable condition&quot;–a stark contrast to the situation a Wellington doctor discovered when he visited, writing that the place was &quot;singularly clean ... regularly swept ... drainage is excellent&quot;.

==Invasion==

The British Government, already uneasy about growing racial tensions in New Zealand, had in late 1880 dispatched a new governor, Sir Arthur Gordon, to review matters and report to them. Gordon was more sympathetic to the Māori and had already been dismissed as a &quot;gospel-grinding nigger lover&quot; by retired Native Land Court judge Frederick Maning and a man of &quot;wild democratic theories&quot; by Premier Hall. In mid-September 1881 Gordon sailed for Fiji, leaving Chief Justice Sir James Prendergast as acting Governor. In his absence, and with an election looming, Hall&#x27;s ministry completed its plans to invade Parihaka. Bryce&#x27;s replacement as Native Minister, Canterbury farmer William Rolleston, secured two votes worth a total of £184,000 for contingency defence against Taranaki Māori and the government significantly boosted the number of Armed Constabulary on the west coast. On 8 October Rolleston visited Parihaka to urge Te Whiti to submit to the Government&#x27;s wishes. If he refused and war ensued, Rolleston explained, &quot;the blame will not rest with me and the government. It will rest with you.&quot;

When news of the Hall government&#x27;s plans reached Gordon, he terminated his Fiji visit and hurried back to New Zealand. At 8pm on 19 October, two hours before the Governor returned to Wellington, however, Hall convened an emergency meeting of his Executive Council and Prendergast issued a proclamation berating Te Whiti and his people for their &quot;threatening attitude&quot;, their rebellious speech and their resistance of the armed constabulary. It urged the people of Parihaka to leave Te Whiti and for the visitors to return home. It gave them 14 days to accept the &quot;large and ample&quot; reserves on the conditions attached to them by the government and willingly submit to the law of the Queen or the lands would forever pass away from them and they alone would be responsible for this and &quot;for the great evil which must fall on them.&quot; &quot;As usual,&quot; observed historian Hazel Riseborough, &quot;it was a question of &quot;mana&quot;.&quot; The proclamation was signed by Rolleston late on 19 October—his last act as minister before Bryce was returned to Cabinet and just two hours before Gordon arrived back in New Zealand. The Governor, though angry at the issuing of the Proclamation, acknowledged it would be supported &quot;by nine-tenths of the white population of the colony&quot; and allowed it to stand.

Tensions climbed among Europeans in Taranaki. Although it had been more than 12 years since the last military action against Māori in Taranaki, and despite the lack of any threat of violence by the inhabitants of Parihaka, Major Charles Stapp, commander of the Taranaki Volunteers, declared that every man in the province between 17 and 55 years was now on active service in the militia. A government &quot;Gazette&quot; announcement called up 33 units of volunteers from Nelson to Thames. At the end of October the forces–1,074 Armed Constabulary, almost 1,000 volunteers from around New Zealand and up to 600 Taranaki volunteers, together outnumbering Parihaka adult males by four to one–gathered near Parihaka, the volunteers at Rahotu and the Armed Constabulary at Pungarehu, and began drills and target practice. Bryce rode in their midst daily.

On 1 November Te Whiti prepared his people with a speech in which he warned: &quot;The ark by which we are to be saved today is stout-heartedness, and flight is death ... There is nothing about fighting today, but the glorification of God and peace on the land ... Let us wait for the end; there is nothing else for us. Let us abide calmly upon the land.&quot; He warned against armed defence: &quot;If any man thinks of his gun or his horse and goes to fetch it, he will die by it.&quot; The settler press continued to denounce the Parihaka meetings as &quot;schools of fanaticism and sedition&quot; and said Te Whiti and Tohu needed to be &quot;taught the lesson of submission and obedience&quot;.

Shortly after 5am on 5 November, long columns emerged from the two main camps to converge on Parihaka, encircling the village. Each man carried two days&#x27; rations, the troops were equipped with artillery and a six-pound Armstrong gun was mounted on a nearby hill and trained on Parihaka. At 7am a forward unit advanced on the main entrance to the village to find their path blocked by 200 young children, standing in lines. Behind them were groups of older girls skipping in unison. Colonel William Bazire Messenger, who had been called from his Pungarehu farm to command a detachment of 120 Armed Constabulary for the invasion, later recalled:

When the advance party reached the marae at the centre of the village, they found 2500 Māori sitting together. They had been waiting since midnight. At 8am Bryce, who had ordered a press blackout and banned reporters from the scene, arrived, riding on a white charger. Two hours later he demanded a reply to the proclamation of 19 October. When his demand was met with silence, he ordered the Riot Act to be read, warning that &quot;persons unlawfully, riotously, and tumultuously assembled together, to the disturbance of the public peace&quot; had one hour to disperse or receive a jail sentence of hard labour for life. Before the hour was up, a bugle was sounded and troops marched into the village.

Bryce then ordered the arrest of Te Whiti, Tohu and Hiroki, a Waikato Māori who had sought refuge at Parihaka after killing a cook travelling with a survey party in south Taranaki in late 1878. As Te Whiti walked through his people, he told them: &quot;We look for peace and we find war.&quot; At the marae the crowd remained sitting quietly until evening, when they moved to their houses.

Two days later constabulary officers, still on edge because of rumours that Titokowaru had summoned armed 500 reinforcements, began ransacking houses in the village in search of weapons. They turned up 200 guns, mostly fowling pieces. Colonel Messenger told Cowan there was &quot;a good deal of looting – in fact robbery&quot; of greenstone and other treasures. &quot;Rapes [were] committed by Crown troops in the aftermath of the invasion&quot;. Bryce ordered members of all tribes who had migrated to Parihaka to return to their previous homes. When none moved, they were warned the Armstrong gun on Fort Rolleston, the hill overlooking the village, would be fired at them. The threat was not carried out, but soldiers amused themselves by aiming their rifles at the crowd.

The next day the constabulary began raiding other central Taranaki Māori settlements in search of arms, and within days the raids, accompanied by destruction and looting, had spread to Waitara. On 11 November, 26 Whanganui Māori were arrested and Bryce, frustrated in his attempt to identify those from outside central Taranaki, telegraphed Hall to advise he intended destroying every &quot;whare&quot; in the village. He told Hall: &quot;Consider, here are 2000 people sitting still, absolutely declining to give me any indication of where they belong to; they will sit still where they are and do nothing else.&quot;

Each day brought dozens of arrests, and from 15 November officers began destroying &quot;whare&quot; that were either empty or housing only women, assuming they were the homes of the evicted Wanganui men. When still Wanganui women could not be conclusively identified, a Māori informer was brought in to identify them. North Taranaki Māori, including children, were then separated–&quot;like drafting sheep,&quot; one newspaper reported–and then marched under guard to Waitara. To starve out the remainder, soldiers destroyed all surrounding crops, wiping out of potatoes, taro and tobacco, then began repeating the measure across the countryside. By 18 November, as many as 400 a day were being evicted and, by the 20th, 1443 had been ejected, their houses destroyed to discourage their return. Te Whiti&#x27;s meeting house was destroyed and its smashed timbers scattered across the marae in an attempt to desecrate the ground.

On 22 November the last group of 150 prisoners were marched out, bringing to a total of 1600 people ejected. Six hundred were issued with official passes and allowed to remain. Those without a pass were prohibited from entry. Further public meetings were banned. Scott noted:

By December it was reported that many dispersed Māori faced starvation. Bryce offered them work, but it was the ultimate humiliation—roadmaking and fencing for the subdivision of their land. The government then decreed that of land set aside as Parihaka reserves would be withheld as &quot;an indemnity for the loss sustained by the government in suppressing the ... Parihaka sedition&quot;. As with the land confiscations of the mid-1860s, Māori were effectively forced to pay the government for the cost of the military invasion of their land.

==Trial of Te Whiti, Tohu and Titokowaru==

Te Whiti and Tohu appeared before a magistrate and eight justices of the peace in the New Plymouth courtroom on 12 November 1881. Te Whiti was described in court as &quot;a wicked, malicious, seditious and evil-disposed person&quot; who had sought &quot;to prevent by force and arms the execution of the laws of the realm&quot;. At the close of his four-day trial Te Whiti declared: &quot;It is not my wish that evil should come to the two races. My wish is for the whole of us to live peaceably and happy on the land.&quot; The magistrate committed both men to jail in New Plymouth until further notice. Six months later they were moved to the South Island, where they were frequently taken from jail to be escorted around the factories, churches and public buildings.

Titokowaru, who had been put in solitary confinement at the Pungarehu constabulary camp, went on a brief hunger strike in protest at his treatment. On 25 November he was charged with threatening to burn a hotel at Manaia in October and using insulting language to troops at Parihaka in November. Three weeks later, while still in jail, a third charge of being unlawfully obstructive–for sitting on the marae at Parihaka–was laid against him. The magistrates ordered him to find to sureties of £500 each to keep the peace for 12 months and to be kept in the New Plymouth jail in the meantime. He remained in jail until July 1882 when bail was posted for him.

In May 1882 the government introduced new legislation, the West Coast Peace Preservation Bill, which decreed that Te Whiti and Tohu were not to be tried, but would be jailed indefinitely. If released, they could be rearrested without charge at any time. Bryce explained that the law was necessary to protect the people of Taranaki and because he feared the two chiefs might be acquitted by a jury or, if they were convicted, receive a lenient sentence. The legislation, signed into law on 1 July, was followed by the Indemnity Act, which indemnified those who, in preserving the peace on the west coast, may have adopted measures &quot;in excess of legal powers&quot;.

Still in jail at the time, however, Te Whiti was visited by one of Bryce&#x27;s staff, who told him that if he agreed to cease assembling his people he could return to Taranaki, where he would receive a government income and land for himself. Te Whiti refused. The offer was repeated, and rejected, two weeks later. The prisoners were transferred to Nelson, where they received a third offer in August. They were finally released in March 1883—a month after a general amnesty was proclaimed for all Māori—and returned to Parihaka, still under threat of arrest under the powers of the West Coast Peace Preservation Act, renewed in August 1883. His remaining land was still shrinking: on 1 January 1883 the reserves granted to Māori by the West Coast Commission—many of which were described by Fox as &quot;extremely rugged country, broken by deep and wide gullies and covered by extremely heavy forest&quot;—were vested in the Public Trust for 30-year lease to European settlers at market rental, prompting Te Whiti to refuse to sign documents and refuse to collect the rental income of £7000 a year.

==Campaign renewed==

Armed constabulary remained stationed at Parihaka, enforcing the pass laws and the ban on public meetings, yet rebuilding began. In August 1884 Te Whiti and Tohu began a new campaign to publicise the loss of their land, embarking on large protest marches across Taranaki, as far south as Patea and north to White Cliffs. In July 1886 the campaign changed direction as Māori began entering pākehā farms to occupy the land and erect thatched huts. Titokowaru and eight other Māori were arrested and on 20 July armed constables launched a dawn raid on Parihaka to arrest Te Whiti. Ten weeks later they faced a Supreme Court trial in Wellington. Te Whiti was jailed for three months and fined £100 for being an accessory to forcible entry, riot and malicious injury to property; the others were jailed for a month and fined £20. In late 1889 Te Whiti was arrested again over a disputed £203 debt and sentenced to three months&#x27; hard labour.

==Parihaka restored==

In 1889 work began on a meeting house and Te Raukura, a large Victorian mansion containing dining rooms, bedrooms, kitchens, a bakery and council chambers for Te Whiti and his &quot;rūnanga&quot; (council). In 1895 Parihaka received a state visit by the Minister for Labour, William Pember Reeves and, two months later, Premier Richard Seddon, who engaged in a tense exchange with Te Whiti over past injustices. Seddon, speaking to Patea settlers days later, boasted over the increased rate of land acquisition by the Government and told them Parihaka had encouraged Māori to lead &quot;lazy and dissolute&quot; lives. He vowed that the state would destroy &quot;this communism that now existed among them&quot;.

Tohu died on 4 February 1907 and Te Whiti died nine months later, on 18 November.

Their followers have continued to observe monthly dusk-to-dusk Te Whiti and Tohu days at Parihaka ever since. That for Te Whiti is held in the meeting houses Te Niho o te Ati Awa and Te Paepae, and for Tohu in Te Rangi Kāpuia. Although nominally on the 17th and 18th of each month, they are actually held on the 18th and 19th. (One reason offered for this is to compensate for the day lost during the Battle of Jericho.) In the same way, the anniversary of the sacking, 5 November, is observed on 6 November.

Te Raukura was destroyed by fire in 1960. Only its foundations remain.

==Apology and redress==
Several Taranaki tribes were affected by the Parihaka incident. Between 2001 and 2006, the New Zealand government provided redress and a formal apology to four of those tribes, Ngati Ruanui, Ngati Tama, Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi and Ngati Mutunga, for a range of historical issues including Parihaka. Tens of millions of New Zealand dollars were provided as redress to the tribes in recognition of their losses at Parihaka and the confiscations. Most of the confiscated land is now privately owned, and worth considerably more.

In June 2017, the Crown formally apologised to the community. Treaty Negotiations Minister Chris Finlayson delivered the apology on behalf of the Crown, and noted it had been a long time coming. He said past events at Parihaka were &quot;among the most shameful in the history of our land&quot;. He also said the Crown regretted its actions, which had left it with a legacy of shame.

Although there were more violent incidents during the New Zealand Wars, the memory of Parihaka is still invoked as a symbol of colonial aggression against the Māori people.

The story of Parihaka lay largely forgotten by non-Māori New Zealanders, until the publication of &quot;The Parihaka Story&quot; by Dick Scott in 1954. It was revised and enlarged as &quot;Ask That Mountain&quot; in 1975.

New Zealand composer Anthony Ritchie composed an orchestral work &quot;Remember Parihaka&quot; (Op. 61) in 1964, inspired by Dick Scott&#x27;s 1954 book.

A sardonic &quot;song-play&quot; about Māori land issues including Parihaka, &quot;Songs for the Judges&quot;, with words by Mervyn Thompson and music by William Dart, was performed in Auckland in February 1980 and toured in 1981. Two of the songs, &quot;Gather up the Earth&quot; and &quot;On that Day&quot;, are based on sayings of Te Whiti. It was issued as an LP (SLD-69) by Kiwi/Pacific Records in 1982.

A play about Parihaka by Harry Dansey called &quot;Te Raukura&quot; was first performed in Auckland and then, in a cut-down version for school-age performers, in the Hutt Valley and at Parihaka in 1981.

In 1989 musicians Tim Finn and Herbs released the song &quot;Parihaka&quot; about the incident.

In 2011, New Zealand author Witi Ihimaera published a novel called &quot;The Parihaka Woman&quot; which provides a fictional story about a woman named Erenora from Parihaka but also provides much historical fact on the subject.

A song released in 2022 by Don McGlashan, &quot;John Bryce&quot;, compares how well-taught and remembered the events of the Gunpowder Plot of 5 November 1605 are compared to the events at Parihaka on 5 November 1881. The former continue to inspire annual Guy Fawkes Night celebrations in New Zealand, but McGlashan&#x27;s chorus suggests, &quot;let&#x27;s put a new guy on the bonfire...Light up John Bryce on the 5th of November / Make it Parihaka Day&quot;.
