<text>Joseph Eugene Kernan III (April 8, 1946 – July 29, 2020) was an American businessman and Democratic politician who served as the 48th governor of Indiana from 2003 to 2005. He previously served as the 47th lieutenant governor of Indiana from 1997 to 2003 under Frank O&#x27;Bannon and succeeded the governorship after O&#x27;Bannon&#x27;s death. Kernan had also served nearly a year as a prisoner of war during the Vietnam War.

After graduating from the University of Notre Dame, Kernan joined the Navy in 1969. A naval aviator, he was shot down in North Vietnam and taken prisoner in 1972. After his release, Kernan continued on active duty through 1974. A member of the Democratic Party, Kernan served as Mayor of South Bend, Indiana, and then as the 47th lieutenant governor of Indiana from 1997 to 2003. He became governor on September 13, 2003, upon the death of Governor Frank O&#x27;Bannon. He lost an election to serve a full term as governor to former Office of Management and Budget director Mitch Daniels on November 2, 2004. Kernan returned to South Bend and retired from politics. As of , he is the most recent governor of Indiana from the Democratic Party.

==Early life and education==
Joe Eugene Kernan III was born in Chicago, Illinois on April 8, 1946. He was the eldest of nine children.

Kernan&#x27;s father, Joseph E. Kernan Jr. (1923–2008), was a naval aviator during World War II and would go on to have a career in government service. His mother, Marian Powers Kernan (1922–1998), held a variety of jobs, including a tenure C&amp;P Telephone, where she worked her way up to a communications representative. As a communications representative she handled The Pentagon&#x27;s account, and held security clearance.

Kernan&#x27;s father was the unsuccessful Democratic nominee in 1963 for the 4th district seat on the South Bend Common Council, and in 1964 ran unsuccessfully for St. Joseph County commissioner.

Kernan&#x27;s family moved to South Bend when he was ten years of age. Kernan graduated from St. Joseph High School in South Bend in 1964.

He graduated in 1968 with a degree in government from the University of Notre Dame. Kernan played on the university&#x27;s baseball team, serving as a walk-on on the freshman team, and playing for the varsity team his sophomore and junior years in 1967 and 1968. He was initially an infielder, later switching to catcher in his junior year.

==Military service==
Kernan joined the United States Navy in 1969, and served as a Naval Flight Officer aboard the carrier . After he completed Naval Flight Officer training, reconnaissance training, &amp; RA-5C Vigilante Replacement Air Group training, he served with RVAH-7 at Naval Air Station Albany, Georgia, until deploying to Southeast Asia aboard the aircraft carrier USS &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot;, where he served (flying 26 missions over Laos and North Vietnam) from February 1972 until a two-seat fighter plane he was serving as a weapons officer on was shot down by enemy forces while on a reconnaissance mission over North Vietnam and Kernan was detained as a prisoner of war on May 7, 1972. He was held as a prisoner of war for 11 months.

For part of his time as a prisoner of war, Kernan was imprisoned at Hỏa Lò Prison; however, he spent most of his sentence at a nearby prison dubbed &quot;The Zoo&quot;. Kernan was repatriated on March 27, 1973, and continued on active duty with the Navy until December 1974. Kernan received the Distinguished Flying Cross, two Purple Hearts and the Navy Commendation Medal.

==Early career==
Kernan served as a business manager and executive at several companies.

In 1975, after having completed his Naval service, Kernan worked for Procter &amp; Gamble in Cincinnati, supervising the manufacturing of Camay, Safeguard, and Zest products. He then returned to South Bend, where he worked for South Bend Community Schools and later for the Schwarz Paper Company.

Kernan began his career in government by working for a month in the office of South Bend controller Peter Mullen for a month in 1976 on a special project related to license research.

==South Bend Controller==
Kernan served South Bend controller from 1980 to 1984. He was appointed to the position by mayor Roger Parent quickly after Parent took office on January 1, 1980. Kernan had been recommended to Parent by Peter Mullen, who held the position before Kernan.

As controller, Kernan served as an ex officio member of the Board of Public Works, and the water and sewage boards.

Kernan was tasked with overseeing the drafting of the city&#x27;s $40 million annual budget. While in this office, cuts were made in regards to the number of the police and firemen, which he later stated were necessary due to the budget squeeze caused by a state tax freeze and cuts in federal aid. When Kernan left the post, Mayor Parent praised Kernan&#x27;s work on the budget, claiming that Kernan took the job at the city&#x27;s worst financial time and that, &quot;just putting a budget together and making it work is an accomplishment, and Joe did a good job&quot;.

Kernan negotiated contracts for city employees, including contracts for the police and fire department workforces. He also negotiated contracts with Teamsters.

Kernan left the office on February 17, 1984, in order to enter the private sector for employment, announcing on his last day in office that he would be working as a vice president for the McWilliams Corporation. He was succeeded in office by Michael Vance. Following his tenure as South Bend Controller, Kernan held his jobs as vice president and treasurer of MacWilliams Corp until he ran for mayor in 1987.

==South Bend mayoralty==

Kernan was elected to serve as mayor of South Bend as the Democratic Party nominee in the 1987 election, and was reelected as the Democratic nominee in the 1991 and 1995 mayoral elections. In 1995, he won 82% of the vote, a record for South Bend mayoral elections. He was the first mayor of the city to win a third term since 1905. Kernan was the longest-serving mayor of South Bend, until his tenure was surpassed in length by that of his immediate successor Steve Luecke.

Kernan was regarded to be a popular mayor. In November 1996, Nancy Armour of &quot;The Associated Press&quot; wrote that Kernan was, &quot;well-liked by Democrats and Republicans alike. He&#x27;s friendly and warm, quick to greet residents by name and ask how they are doing. He&#x27;s accessible too.&quot;

As mayor, Kernan worked on long-term job creation efforts, made efforts to improve public safety, and strengthened the finances of the city. After being reelected to his third term, Kernan stated that his priorities, at that time, were public safety, economic development, and neighborhoods.

===Development===
At the time he was mayor, Kernan was praised for his ability to attract economic development to the community. Among the major developments he was able to garner South Bend was the securing of the city as the location for the College Football Hall of Fame. Kernan had been instrumental in getting South Bend selected over 89 other cities as the site for the College Football Hall of Fame. Kernan originally pledged that city funds would not go towards the project, and that it would be funded by corporate donations. However, after the city was only able to raise under $2 million in corporate donations, the city issued municipal bonds to pay for the construction.

Among the developments of which Kernan was particularly supportive was the Blackthorn development, a multimillion-dollar golf course and office park development. In 1992, he had touted the concept that became Blackthorn as a &quot;pump for future development.&quot; In 1995, Kernan took interest in a proposal to build an arena in South Bend for a new minor league ice hockey team. However, this proposal ultimately failed to materialize.

Some of the developments that were initially regarded as successes for South Bend when Kernan was mayor ultimately fell short in the long run. For instance, the College Football Hall of Fame never met its initial attendance projections. By the late-90s, it already had begun to be criticized as a failure, due to a lack of corporate sponsorship and poor turnout even during special events. The Hall of Fame would ultimately leave South Bend for the city of Atlanta in the 2010s. The Blackthorn, particularly its golf course component, fell short of expectations as well. However, Kernan, as late as 2015, defended the Blackthorn development, having regarded it, personally, to have been a success.

===Job creation and retention===
In November 1996, Nancy Armour of &quot;The Associated Press&quot; wrote that Kernan, 

Kernan worked on long-term job creation efforts as mayor. Kernan came to office shortly after a number of companies had left the city or closed, such as South Bend Toy in 1985 and Wheelbrater-Frye. Kernan took credit for stopping companies like Allied Products&#x27; South Bend Stamping from leaving the city. He also took credit for attracting other jobs to the city, arguing that as mayor he had been able to create or retain 4,000 manufacturing jobs. Another example that illustrates Kernan&#x27;s work in this area was his successful work in 1993 to keep the Hoosier Lottery&#x27;s 15-employee regional headquarters in South Bend. After they began looking for a new location, eying sites outside of South Bend, Kernan worked directly with them to find a new location for their offices within the city.

===Infrastructure===
The loss of $20 million annually in federal funds which the city had received prior to Reagan and Bush budget cuts to urban programs had taken its toll on South Bend&#x27;s infrastructure. Nevertheless, a number of infrastructure projects took place under Kernan&#x27;s mayoralty.

Among the infrastructure projects that took place during Kernan&#x27;s tenure as mayor was the shifting of South Bend&#x27;s South Shore Line station from a facility shared with Amtrak to a new location at the city&#x27;s airport, which opened in 1992. In 1993, Kernan testified before congress that this move had been partially responsible for a 73% increase in ridership from South Bend, attributing this to the fact that the previous location of the station was in an area, &quot;isolated and very difficult and perceived to be unsafe&quot; Plans to move the South Shore Line station to the airport, creating an air, bus, and rail intermodal terminal, had dated back to the 1970s.
Kernan and others would work to see a new intermodal transit center built in Downtown South Bend, which would feature a new station for Amtrak and a new transit center for South Bend Transpo. Efforts planning this station date back to 1992. It ultimately opened in 1998, after Kernan&#x27;s mayoralty had ended, as the South Street Station, but only as a bus center without an Amtrak component.

===Parks and Recreation===
During Kernan&#x27;s tenure many changes were made to South Bend&#x27;s parks. Several new facilities opened, including Blackthorn Golf Course in 1994. In 1993, for the first time, non-reverting funds were established to create money for capitol improvements to the parks. Additionally, a City-County parks merger was studied in 1993, but ultimately not implemented. In 1995, South Bend&#x27;s recreation commission was dissolved, and the Department of Parks took over management of recreation programs and was renamed the Department of Parks and Recreation.

===National politics===
In 1989, Kernan considered, but ruled out, running against Republican Dan Coats for the United States Senate in the 1990 special election for the seat that had been vacated by Dan Quayle upon becoming vice president. While Kernan was considered a strong prospective candidate among the possible Democratic contenders, commentator James Grass observed prior to Kernan making his decision not to run that, &quot;to run a successful campaign,&quot; a Democratic nominee would likely need, &quot;statewide name recognition, a good reputation, and the ability to raise lots of money. All the Democrats still considering a candidacy lack at least one of these qualifications.&quot;

In 1992, Democratic presidential nominee Bill Clinton proposed a $200 billion ($20 billion annually) plan for infrastructure. Mayor Kernan declared to the media that under Clinton&#x27;s plan, in which a city of South Bend&#x27;s size would have received at least $5 million annually, South Bend would have been able to complete critical road construction and complete reclamation on hundreds of acres of former industrial property.

In 1993, Kernan campaigned in support of President Clinton&#x27;s deficit reduction and economic stimulus proposal. After meeting with Clinton when accompanying Governor Evan Bayh to the Democratic Governors Association quarterly meeting in March 1993, Kernan declared that he had been persuaded by Clinton that it was necessary to pass both deficit reduction and economic stimulus in a singular piece of legislation rather than separating them into separate bills. Kernan declared, 

To promote the legislation to Indiana&#x27;s federal representatives and their constituents, Kernan pointed to an analysis that had found that Indiana would be one of only five states that would benefit fiscally from the proposal, as Indiana, at the time, had typically received less in federal funding than it contributed in federal taxes. Kernan also touted the prospect of South Bend receiving several million dollars in one-time federal funding through the legislation. He also argued that the stimulus portion of the legislation was needed to generate jobs.

Kernan also argued that it was past time for legislators to cease considering alternative proposals, as several Republican alternative proposals had already been voted down. Kernan remarked, &quot;This is the only game in town. While there may be some folks who disagree with some party of it, it&#x27;s the only economic package in the country that has a change of passage.&quot; He argued that failure to pass the proposal without a viable alternative would worsen federal legislative gridlock and hurt the chances of Clinton achieving his target of implementing a significant economic change.

===Other matters===
As mayor, Kernan worked to create a better working relationship between the South Bend city government and the nearby University of Notre Dame.

In December 1988, a fire that destroyed the Morningside Club Residence, an apartment hotel, displaced more than a hundred residents. Kernan was able to persuade the then-unopened Center for the Homeless to rush its opening in order to accommodate some of these displaced residents.
In 1988, taking advantage of a decline in interest rates, Kernan refinanced Coveleski Stadium through the newly created South Bend Redevelopment Authority.

Kernan instituted a mayor&#x27;s night out/mayor&#x27;s night in to provide an opportunity for his constituents to better meet with him and share their concerns with him. He held his first such event in January 1988. This practice was also continued under his successor, Steve Luecke.

Kernan was involved in the creation of Indiana&#x27;s Vietnam and Korean War memorials.

==1996 election as lieutenant governor==
In 1996, Kernan was elected as Indiana&#x27;s lieutenant governor on the Democratic Party ticket with then-lieutenant governor Frank O&#x27;Bannon topping the ticket as the gubernatorial nominee. Kernan had been reluctant to accept O&#x27;Bannon&#x27;s offer to run with him, initially desiring to instead continue to serve as mayor. Others who had been rumored to have under consideration by O&#x27;Bannon for a running mate included Tom DiGuillio, Mike Gery, Baron Hill, John Walda, and Jill Long Thompson. Pamela Carter had ruled herself out of consideration. There has been some reporting that O&#x27;Bannon may have first offered the running mate position to Long Thompson and that she had rejected.

Kernan, the mayor of a Northern Indiana city, brought geographic balance to the ticket headed by O&#x27;Bannon, a native of the Southern Indiana city of Corydon. O&#x27;Bannon had previously signaled that he was exploring choosing a running mate from Northern Indiana in order to provide that geographic benefit. Kernan and O&#x27;Bannon had a strong preexisting acquaintanceship. O&#x27;Bannon had developed a working relationship on issues of economic development since O&#x27;Bannon oversaw the Indiana Department of Commerce as lieutenant governor. Kernan had developed a particularly strong camaraderie with O&#x27;Bannon six years earlier in 1990, when Kernan and other Indiana mayors accompanied O&#x27;Bannon on a trade mission to Poland, Soviet Union, Ukraine, and Yugoslavia. O&#x27;Bannon&#x27;s selection of Kernan was announced June 3, 1996 with a press release followed by press conference in South Bend and Indianapolis. in its press release, the gubernatorial campaign promoted Kernan as having had a record of success in attracting businesses to the city of South Bend.

While campaigning for lieutenant governor in 1996, Kernan continued to fulfill his duties as mayor. In part to facilitate this, Kernan operated his end of the campaign out of a separate campaign office from O&#x27;Bannon, located in South Bend. Despite starting the general election as underdogs, O&#x27;Bannon and Kernan&#x27;s ticket to defeat overcame a deficit to defeat the Republican ticket of Stephen Goldsmith and George Witwer.

Upon being elected Lieutenant Governor, Kernan was involved in the process of helping guide the selection of a successor for mayor. Kernan involved St. Joseph Democratic Party Chairman Butch Morgan and South Bend City Council President Roland Kelly in the interviewing of prospective successors. By law, his successor was appointed by the city&#x27;s 120 Democratic Party precinct committeemen and committeewoman, and it was required that a successor be appointed within thirty days of Kernan leaving office as mayor. It was anticipated that Kernan&#x27;s endorsement would be heeded by them. Kernan ultimately endorsed Steve Luecke to be his successor, and Luecke was thereafter voted unanimously to serve the rest of Kernan&#x27;s term. Other candidates that had been reportedly considered included St. Joseph County Prosecutor Mike Barnes, Portage Township Assessor John Voorde, St. Joseph County Auditor Joe Nagy, City Councilor Sean Coleman, City Councilor John Hosinski, Carter Wolf, and City Controller Kevin Horton.

==Lieutenant Governor of Indiana==
From January 1997, until assuming the governorship in September 2003, Kernan served as lieutenant governor of Indiana. As lieutenant governor, Kernan built a reputation as a skilled orator. Kernan was regarded to be a popular lieutenant governor.

===First term===
Kernan was sworn in as lieutenant governor by his own father. As lieutenant governor, Kernan served as the President of the Indiana Senate, the Director of the Indiana Department of Commerce, and as the Commissioner of Agriculture.

In 1998, Kernan headed the Insurance Industry Working Group, a group aiming to boost the economic fortunes of the state&#x27;s insurance industry. The group succeeded in getting a reduction to the insurance premium tax rate, securing the passage of a new demutualization law, and getting Ivy Tech to create a new associate degree focusing on the insurance industry.

In 1998, Kernan was involved in the formation of the Pork Crisis Working Group, which later became Agricultural Crisis Working Group. Kernan chaired this group.

In 1998, Kernan was made chair of the new Hoosier Farmland Preservation Task Force. It presented recommendations for farmland preservation and additional land use issues to O&#x27;Bannon and members of the Indiana General Assembly, and Laos provided information and advice to communities dealing with problems regarding these issues.

During Kernan&#x27;s tenure at the head of Indiana&#x27;s Department of Commerce, the state recorded what were the second-highest export numbers in its history in the second quarter of 1998.

In 1999, Kernan launched the Veterans Outreach Initiative, which was an effort to urge veterans to capitalize upon state and federal benefits available to them.

Kernan was the chairman of the Indiana 21st Century Research and Technology Fund, which was formed in 1999.

===Second term===
O&#x27;Bannon and Kernan were re-elected in 2000, defeating the ticket of David M. McIntosh and J. Murray Clark.

In October 2001, Kernan unveiled the O&#x27;Bannon administration&#x27;s plan for a comprehensive overhaul to the state of Indiana&#x27;s tax system. The plan was entitled the 21st Century Tax Plan. Kernan had developed this plan alongside a bipartisan group of tax experts. A tax reform plan based upon this proposal was passed in the Indiana General Assembly in June 2002.

In July 2002, Kernan announced a reorganization of the Indiana Department of Commerce. It moved from dividing the department in the thirteen divisions to instead dividing into two teams (program operations and professional services). The reorganization also included the creation of twelve regional offices (including a central office in Indianapolis).

In December 2002, O&#x27;Bannon and Kernan proposed a broad job-creation plan entitled &quot;Energize Indiana&quot;.

In 2002, a rift arose between Kernan and Governor O&#x27;Bannon over O&#x27;Bannon&#x27;s selection of Peter Manous as Democratic State Chairman.

====Acting governor====
On September 10, 2003, Kernan began serving as acting governor. O&#x27;Bannon had been hospitalized after suffering a stroke two days earlier. This was the first time that Indiana had ever implemented their state constitution&#x27;s clause for handing over the authority of governor in the instance that the governor is unable to perform their duty due to disability. Speaker of the Indiana House of Representatives B. Patrick Bauer and Indiana Senate President pro tempore Robert D. Garton had consulted with O&#x27;Bannon&#x27;s counsel, medical treatment team, and family before making a request on September 10, 2003, to Indiana Supreme Court Chief justice Randall Shepard for the court to issue a ruling on O&#x27;Bannon&#x27;s ability to perform his duties. After just over an hour of private discussion, the court ruled that Kernan would become acting governor.

==Governor of Indiana==
Kernan assumed the governorship following the September 13, 2003 death of Frank O&#x27;Bannon. Kernan would receive praise for what was regarded to have been a smooth transition into the office.

===Appointments and personnel===
For his lieutenant governor, Kernan appointed Kathy Davis, making her the first female lieutenant governor in Indiana&#x27;s history.

Early into his governorship, Kernan made some key hires and appointments. This included hiring Marshall Michael Carrington to conduct a thorough probe of the Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles, and appointing Cheryl Sullivan to head the Family and Social Services Administration. Kernan was credited with strengthening the cabinet style of government of Indiana&#x27;s executive branch, which had dissipated in its functionality in the later years of O&#x27;Bannon&#x27;s tenure.

===Economic matters===
Kernan assumed office amid an economic downturn in the state, with state revenue decreasing and unemployment rising. During his governorship, the state struggled with budget deficits and job losses, which Republicans faulted Kernan for, but which Democrats blamed on the lingering aftermath of the early 2000s recession and the dot-com bust. In 2004, the Indiana Fiscal Policy Institute (IFPI) found that the state was facing a $824.3 million structural deficit, a deficit equivalent to more than 7% of the state&#x27;s existing revenues, with the deficit anticipated to significantly grow every year under the existing budget priorities. On a positive note, in 2004, the state began to experience notable increases in revenue in mid-2004.

In November 2003, Kernan and Davis unveiled the Opportunity Indiana initiative, which would aim to optimize how the state conducts business and would aim to increase opportunities for Indiana companies. Under this program, they created a working group to review how the state of Indiana deals with purchasing goods and services, and to provide recommendations to adjustments.

In his 2004 State of the State address, Kernan outlined the Indiana@Work program, an expansion of the state&#x27;s new jobs initiative. By the end of 2004, 30,000 Hoosiers would receive skills assessments through this program.

===Education===
In January 2004, Kernan announced the Early Learning Trust, which was an initiative with the goal of providing every child in Indiana with access to voluntary full-day kindergarten by the year 2007. It would also create pilot programs for early learning opportunities for at-risk children.

In March 2004, Kernan requested to the state&#x27;s public colleges and universities that they cap tuition and fee increases at 4% for the 2004–05 academic year. In October 2004 he unveiled plans to expand the state&#x27;s community college system from having ten campuses to having 23 in time for the fall of 2005, which would mean that every state resident would live within a 30-mile radius of a community college&#x27;s campus.

Through executive order, Kernan created the Early Learning and School Readiness Commission.

As co-chair of the Indiana Education Roundtable, Kernan took charge in work to adopt the P-16 Plan for Improving Student Achievement.

===Healthcare===
Kernan took actions as governor to address rising healthcare costs. Changes were made to HoosierRx to allow senior citizens twice the discount when it was utilized in conjunction with the new federal Medicare prescription drug benefit. Kernan signed legislation which created the state&#x27;s prescription drug purchasing pool. Kernan pushed forward with the Hoosier Health Plan. On December 1, 2004, Kernan convened a prescription drug summit aiming to develop an &quot;Indiana solution&quot; to drug affordability concerns.

===Highway infrastructure===
Kernan supported a controversial project extending Interstate 69 from Indianapolis to Evansville, which had earlier received O&#x27;Bannon&#x27;s support. Kernan also pursued upgrades to U.S. Route 31. The Indiana Department of Transportation estimated that Kernan&#x27;s proposed projects for U.S. Route 31 would cost more than $1 billion.

===Other matters===
In his 2004 State of the State address, Kernan announced the Peak Performance Project, in which he delegated lieutenant governor Davis with overseeing a review of state government performance. The Peak Performance Project would ultimately result in the creation of a broad plan for overhauling the state&#x27;s government.

On March 17, 2004, Kernan signed House Bill 1349, which provided protections for gun owners whose firearms were stolen from being sued for injuries or deaths resulting from misuse of those stolen firearms.

In 2004, Kernan became the first governor of Indiana in 48 years to spare the life of an inmate on death row, when, just days before his scheduled execution, Kernan commuted the sentence of Darnell Williams to life in prison without parole.

===2004 re-election campaign===

In December 2002, whilst lieutenant governor, despite previous widespread anticipation that he would seek the governorship, Kernan made the surprise announcement that he would not run in the 2004 election. However, two months after assuming the governorship, he reversed this decision, declaring himself a candidate. Kernan was unopposed in the Democratic primary and in the general election faced Republican Mitch Daniels. 

In their bid for a first full term as governor and lieutenant governor, Kernan and Davis outlined their vision for what he would seek to accomplish in their prospective continued tenure in the state&#x27;s top two offices in a plan entitled &quot;Action Indiana&quot;.

One of the things Kernan criticized his opponent, Daniels, for was Daniels&#x27; decision in 2000, as a member of the board of the Indianapolis Power &amp; Light Company, to vote to sell the utility company to an out-of-state company. Kernan characterized it as &quot;terribly bad judgement&quot;.

Kernan pledged to pursue upgrades to U.S. Route 31 calling it, &quot;one of my top priorities since I first took office as lieutenant governor in 1997, and...still among them today.&quot; He declared that there had progress in the pursuit of improvements, and that the plans had been made in a &quot;fiscally responsible manner&quot; Kernan also voiced opposition to the prospect making the thoroughfare a toll road, declaring, &quot;I will not make hoosiers – or the people who are driving through on business or pleasure – pay a toll to travel this roadway.&quot; Daniels criticized Kernan&#x27;s proposals, characterizing them as fiscally irresponsible, claiming, &quot;The gap between the cost and the available funds in the Indiana Department of Transportation&#x27;s budget is more than $3 billion in the next six years. For a state that is broke by every measure, the governor&#x27;s promise list is impossible.&quot;

Kernan and Davis were ultimately defeated by the Republican ticket of Mitch Daniels and Becky Skillman. 53%-45% At the time, the election was the most expensive gubernatorial election in the state&#x27;s history, in regards to campaign spending. The Republicans have controlled Indiana&#x27;s governor&#x27;s mansion since Kernan&#x27;s departure.

==Post-gubernatorial career==
Kernan returned to private life in January 2005, and moved back to South Bend in 2006.

He served as a volunteer acting director for the St. Joseph County Red Cross. He worked at the University of Notre Dame as an adjunct professor.

Kernan served on the Indiana University South Bend Chancellor&#x27;s Advisory Board, and was a member of the Chancellor&#x27;s 100 of Indiana University.

Partnering with his gubernatorial successor, Kernan worked with the Mitch Daniels Leadership Foundation.

Kernan was the president and owner of the community and business development consulting firm South Bend Enterprises, Inc.

===South Bend Silver Hawks===
In 2005, Kernan became president and managing investor of the South Bend Silver Hawks baseball club, after convincing approximately 50 others to invest in the team. This kept the team in South Bend, amid rumors that they were eying a move out of the city.

Kernan&#x27;s tenure with the South Bend Silver Hawks team ended in 2011. Kernan then agreed to sell the team to Andrew Berlin, of Berlin Packaging, so that he could develop the Silver Hawks further and keep the team in the South Bend area. The team has subsequently been the renamed the South Bend Cubs.

===Political involvement===
In July 2007, Kernan and Indiana Chief Justice Randall T. Shepard, a Republican, were appointed by Daniels to co-chair the bipartisan Indiana Commission on Local Government Reform. The commission published its report in December 2007. It recommended making broad changes to the structure of local government in the state. The report recommended having county argument mimic state government by having a single executive act that acts the chief executive officer and a legislative body which deals with fiscal and policy matters. The report also recommended saving costs bay eliminating township governments and having other levels of government assume services currently provided by townships. It also recommended having a unified county library system within each of the state&#x27;s 92 counties. It also recommended decreasing the expenses of elections by moving municipal elections from off-years to even-numbered years. The state acted on a recommendation to eliminate township assessors, merging their responsibilities with county assessors. A state law was passed allowing townships to vote on whether to retain or abolish their assessors. In October 2008, Kernan and Shepherd co-authored an op-ed urging voters to vote to abolish assessor positions in their townships in the November elections. That November, 30 townships abolished their assessors, while thirteen retained theirs.

In 2008, Kernan and his wife Maggie were Indiana co-chairs of Hillary Clinton&#x27;s presidential campaign and actively campaigned for Clinton leading up to the state&#x27;s May primary. Ahead of the state&#x27;s April primaries, Kernan also endorsed Jim Schellinger&#x27;s gubernatorial campaign. Like Kernan, Schellinger originally hailed from South Bend. In his endorsement, Kernan stated that he had personally known Schellinger for years prior and considered him a friend and a great prospective governor. Breaking with her husband, Maggie Kernan endorsed Schellinger&#x27;s primary election opponent, Jill Long Thompson.

Kernan endorsed Pete Buttigieg during the 2011 South Bend mayoral election.

In 2014, Kernan and several other city leaders, including his mayoral successor Steve Luecke and former South Bend fire chief Luther Taylor and Republican CEO of the South Bend Regional Chamber of Commerce Jeff Rea, held a press conference in which complained about visible infighting on the South Bend Common Council. Kernan also cited lewd social media posts by then-5th district council member Henry Davis Jr. to have been an embarrassment to the city. At the press conference, Kernan levied the possibility that he would work to help remove problematic members of the council from office in the 2015 election. Immediately after, in comments to the &quot;South Bend Tribune&quot;, Kernan criticized Common Council Vice President Derek Dieter as being &quot;poison in the well&quot;, alleging that he had been &quot;behaving like a bully&quot;. Kernan criticized the leadership of Common Council President Oliver Davis, arguing that he believed Davis was a, &quot;good guy,&quot; who was, &quot;reluctant to make decisions&quot;. Kernan&#x27;s harsh rebuke of the council earned support from council member Fred Ferlic.

In 2015, Kernan served as campaign manager and treasurer for Kareemah Fowler&#x27;s campaign for South Bend City Clerk. Fowler had a landslide victory in capturing Democratic nomination in a competitive primary, defeating veteran Common Council member Derek Dieter, and was elected clerk in the general election.

During the 2016 United States presidential election, Kernan appeared in a Priorities USA Action-funded television advertisement criticizing Republican nominee Donald Trump as &quot;unfit to be president.&quot; In the ad, he also referred to comments Trump had made deriding John McCain&#x27;s military service, in which, like Kernan, he was a prisoner of war in the Vietnam war, as, &quot;disgraceful&quot;. The ad was run in nine swing states.

In 2017, along with Republican former Ohio Governor Bob Taft, Kernan co-authored an op-ed arguing in favor of abolishing the death penalty for mentally ill criminals.

Kernan endorsed Tim Corbett in his unsuccessful bid for the Democratic nomination in the 2018 St. Joseph County Sheriff election.

==Honors and awards==
For his military service, Kernan was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, two Purple Hearts and the Navy Commendation Medal. He was among the second-ever class of inductees into the Indiana Military Veterans Hall of Fame when he was enshrined in 2015.

Kernan was awarded an honorary doctorate by his alma mater the University of Notre Dame in 1998, when he served as the university&#x27;s commencement speaker. In 2012, the Notre Dame Monogram Club awarded Kernan the Edward &quot;Moose&quot; Krause Distinguished Service Award. Six years later, the University of Notre Dame Alumni Association presented Kernan with the Rev. Edward Frederick Sorin, C.S.C., Award, regarded to be one of the university&#x27;s highest honors.

A park in South Bend was named for Kernan in 2017. The park, located along the St. Joseph River, had previously been named Viewing Park. That same year, Kernan received an honorary doctorate of Humane Letters from Indiana University.

==Personal life==
Kernan was the eldest of nine children. He had one brother and seven sisters. He was Catholic.

Kernan married Maggie McCullough in April 1974. In 1976, they moved to the north side of South Bend, Indiana. Maggie is a Purdue University graduate; she was an executive with 1st Source Bank and was active in community service. The couple did not have any children.

===Death===
On July 8, 2020, Kernan&#x27;s family announced that he had been diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease several years earlier, and was living in a care facility in South Bend. The disease had progressed to the point that he had lost the ability to speak. He died from complications of the disease later that month, on July 29, at the age of 74.

==Political positions==
Kernan stated that he was &quot;personally opposed&quot; to abortion, but was strongly pro-choice.

While lieutenant governor, Kernan commented on President Bill Clinton&#x27;s misconduct outlined in the Starr Report, stating that the president had &quot;gone too far,&quot; and further commenting on a sense of disappointment in Clinton by saying, &quot;We&#x27;ve all had some feelings over the last
few weeks and the past seven months. Some of us are angry, disappointed, ashamed, bitter, sad. For all of us, one or more of these emotions have come together.&quot;

As governor, Kernan was not opposed to providing special subsidies for large employers to move jobs to the state. He responded to criticisms of this feeding into a race to the bottom by declaring, &quot;I understand the argument that taking jobs away from Boston and putting them here is nationally a zero-sum game. But Indiana, like virtually every other state, is not going to unilaterally disarm&quot;.

In 2017, along with Republican former Ohio Governor Bob Taft, Kernan co-authored an op-ed arguing in favor of abolishing the death penalty for mentally ill criminals.

<text>A lawn () is an area of soil-covered land planted with grasses and other durable plants such as clover which are maintained at a short height with a lawn mower (or sometimes grazing animals) and used for aesthetic and recreational purposes—it is also commonly referred to as part of a garden. Lawns are usually composed only of grass species, subject to weed and pest control, maintained in a green color (e.g., by watering), and are regularly mowed to ensure an acceptable length. Lawns are used around houses, apartments, commercial buildings and offices. Many city parks also have large lawn areas. In recreational contexts, the specialised names [[Sod|turf]], parade, pitch, field or green may be used, depending on the sport and the continent.

The term &quot;lawn&quot;, referring to a managed grass space, dates to at least the 16th century. With suburban expansion, the lawn has become culturally ingrained in some areas of the world as part of the desired household aesthetic. However, awareness of the negative environmental impact of this ideal is growing. In some jurisdictions where there are water shortages, local government authorities are encouraging alternatives to lawns to reduce water use. Researchers in the United States have noted that suburban lawns are &quot;biological deserts&quot; that are contributing to a &quot;continental-scale ecological homogenization.&quot; Lawn maintenance practices also cause biodiversity loss in surrounding areas. Some forms of lawn, such as tapestry lawns, are designed partly for biodiversity and pollinator support.

==Etymology==
Lawn is a cognate of Welsh &quot;llan&quot; which is derived from the Common Brittonic word &quot;landa&quot; () that originally meant
heath, barren land, or clearing.

== History ==
===Origins===
Areas of grass grazed regularly by rabbits, horses or sheep over a long period often form a very low, tight sward similar to a modern lawn. This was the original meaning of the word &quot;lawn&quot;, and the term can still be found in place names. Some forest areas where extensive grazing is practiced still have these seminatural lawns. For example, in the New Forest, England, such grazed areas are common, and are known as lawns, for example Balmer Lawn. 

Lawns may have originated as grassed enclosures within early medieval settlements used for communal grazing of livestock, as distinct from fields reserved for agriculture. Low, mown-meadow areas may also have been valued because they allowed those inside an enclosed fence or castle to view those approaching. The early lawns were not always distinguishable from pasture fields. The damp climate of maritime Western Europe in the north made lawns possible to grow and manage. They were not a part of gardens in most other regions and cultures of the world until contemporary influence.

In 1100s Britain, low-growing area of grasses and meadow flowers were grazed or scythed to keep them short, and used for sport. Lawn bowling, which began in the 12th or 13th century, required short turf. 

Establishing grass using sod instead of seed was first documented in a Japanese text of 1159. 

Lawns became popular with the aristocracy in northern Europe from the Middle Ages onward. In the fourteen hundreds, open expanses of low grasses appear in paintings of public and private areas; by the fifteen hundreds, such areas were found in the gardens of the wealthy across northern and central Europe. Public meadow areas, kept short by sheep, were used for new sports such as cricket, soccer, and golf. The word &quot;laune&quot; is first attested in 1540 from the Old French &quot;lande&quot; &quot;heath, moor, barren land; clearing&quot;. It initially described a natural opening in a woodland. In the sixteen hundreds, &quot;lawn&quot; came to mean a grassy stretch of untilled land, and by mid-century, there were publications on seeding and transplanting sod. In the seventeen hundreds, &quot;lawn&quot; came to mean specifically a &quot;mown&quot; stretch of meadow. Lawns similar to those of today first appeared in France and England in the 1700s when André Le Nôtre designed the gardens of the Palace of Versailles that included a small area of grass called the &quot;&quot;, or &quot;green carpet&quot;, which became a common feature of French gardens. Large, mown open spaces became popular, in Europe and North America. The lawn was influenced by later seventeen-hundreds trends replicating the romantic aestheticism of grassy pastoralism from Italian landscape paintings.

Before the invention of mowing machines in 1830, lawns were managed very differently. They were an element of wealthy estates and manor houses, and in some places were maintained by labor-intensive scything and shearing (for hay or silage). They were also pasture land maintained through grazing by sheep or other livestock.

===The English lawn===
It was not until the 17th and 18th century that the garden and the lawn became a place created first as walkways and social areas. They were made up of meadow plants, such as camomile, a particular favourite (see camomile lawn). In the early 17th century, the Jacobean epoch of gardening began; during this period, the closely cut &quot;English&quot; lawn was born. By the end of this period, the English lawn was a symbol of status of the aristocracy and gentry.

In the early 18th century, landscape gardening for the aristocracy entered a golden age, under the direction of William Kent and Lancelot &quot;Capability&quot; Brown. They refined the English landscape garden style with the design of natural, or &quot;romantic&quot;, estate settings for wealthy Englishmen. Brown, remembered as &quot;England&#x27;s greatest gardener&quot;, designed over 170 parks, many of which still endure. His influence was so great that the contributions to the English garden made by his predecessors Charles Bridgeman and William Kent are often overlooked.

His work still endures at Croome Court (where he also designed the house), Blenheim Palace, Warwick Castle, Harewood House, Bowood House, Milton Abbey (and nearby Milton Abbas village), in traces at Kew Gardens and many other locations. His style of smooth undulating lawns which ran seamlessly to the house and meadow, clumps, belts and scattering of trees and his serpentine lakes formed by invisibly damming small rivers, were a new style within the English landscape, a &quot;gardenless&quot; form of landscape gardening, which swept away almost all the remnants of previous formally patterned styles. His landscapes were fundamentally different from what they replaced, the well-known formal gardens of England which were criticised by Alexander Pope and others from the 1710s.
The open &quot;English style&quot; of parkland first spread across Britain and Ireland, and then across Europe, such as the garden &quot;à la française&quot; being replaced by the French landscape garden. By this time, the word &quot;lawn&quot; in England had semantically shifted to describe a piece of a garden covered with grass and closely mown.

===In North America===
Wealthy families in America during the late 18th century also began mimicking English landscaping styles. British settlers in North America imported an affinity for landscapes in the style of the English lawn. However, early in the colonization of the continent, environments with thick, low-growing, grass-dominated vegetation were rare in the eastern part of the continent, enough so that settlers were warned that it would be difficult to find land suitable for grazing cattle. In 1780, the Shaker community began the first industrial production of high-quality grass seed in North America, and a number of seed companies and nurseries were founded in Philadelphia. The increased availability of these grasses meant they were in plentiful supply for parks and residential areas, not just livestock.

Thomas Jefferson has long been given credit for being the first person to attempt an English-style lawn at his estate, Monticello, in 1806, but many others had tried to emulate English landscaping before he did. Over time, an increasing number towns in New England began to emphasize grass spaces. Many scholars link this development to the romantic and transcendentalist movements of the 19th century. These green commons were also heavily associated with the success of the Revolutionary War and often became the homes of patriotic war memorials after the Civil War ended in 1865.

===Middle class pursuit===

Before the mechanical lawn mower, the upkeep of lawns was possible only for the extremely wealthy estates and manor houses of the aristocracy. Labor-intensive methods of scything and shearing the grass were required to maintain the lawn in its correct state, and most of the land in England was required for more functional, agricultural purposes.

This all changed with the invention of the lawn mower by Edwin Beard Budding in 1830. Budding had the idea for a lawn mower after seeing a machine in a local cloth mill which used a cutting cylinder (or bladed reel) mounted on a bench to trim the irregular nap from the surface of woolen cloth and give a smooth finish. Budding realised that a similar device could be used to cut grass if the mechanism was mounted in a wheeled frame to make the blades rotate close to the lawn&#x27;s surface. His mower design was to be used primarily to cut the lawn on sports grounds and extensive gardens, as a superior alternative to the scythe, and he was granted a British patent on 31 August 1830.

Budding went into partnership with a local engineer, John Ferrabee, who paid the costs of development and acquired rights to manufacture and sell lawn mowers and to license other manufacturers. Together they made mowers in a factory at Thrupp near Stroud. Among the other companies manufacturing under license the most successful was Ransomes, Sims &amp; Jefferies of Ipswich which began mower production as early as 1832.
However, his model had two crucial drawbacks. It was immensely heavy (it was made of cast iron) and difficult to manoeuvre in the garden, and did not cut the grass very well. The blade would often spin above the grass uselessly. It took ten more years and further innovations, including the advent of the Bessemer process for the production of the much lighter alloy steel and advances in motorization such as the drive chain, for the lawn mower to become a practical proposition. Middle-class families across the country, in imitation of aristocratic landscape gardens, began to grow finely trimmed lawns in their back gardens.

In the 1850s, Thomas Green of Leeds introduced a revolutionary mower design called the Silens Messor (meaning silent cutter), which used a chain to transmit power from the rear roller to the cutting cylinder. The machine was much lighter and quieter than the gear driven machines that preceded them, and won first prize at the first lawn mower trial at the London Horticultural Gardens. Thus began a great expansion in the lawn mower production in the 1860s. James Sumner of Lancashire patented the first steam-powered lawn mower in 1893. Around 1900, Ransomes&#x27; Automaton, available in chain- or gear-driven models, dominated the British market. In 1902, Ransomes produced the first commercially available mower powered by an internal combustion gasoline engine. JP Engineering of Leicester, founded after World War I, invented the first riding mowers.
This went hand-in-hand with a booming consumer market for lawns from the 1860s onward. With the increasing popularity of sports in the mid-Victorian period, the lawn mower was used to craft modern-style sporting ovals, playing fields, pitches and grass courts for the nascent sports of football, lawn bowls, lawn tennis and others. The rise of Suburbanisation in the interwar period was heavily influenced by the garden city movement of Ebenezer Howard and the creation of the first garden suburbs at the turn of the 20th century. The garden suburb, developed through the efforts of social reformer Henrietta Barnett and her husband, exemplified the incorporation of the well manicured lawn into suburban life. Suburbs dramatically increased in size. Harrow Weald went from just 1,500 to over 10,000 while Pinner jumped from 3,00 to over 20,000. During the 1930s, over 4 million new suburban houses were built and the &#x27;suburban revolution&#x27; had made England the most heavily suburbanized country in the world by a considerable margin.

Lawns began to proliferate in America from the 1870s onwards. As more plants were introduced from Europe, lawns became smaller as they were filled with flower beds, perennials, sculptures, and water features. Eventually the wealthy began to move away from the cities into new suburban communities. In 1856, an architectural book was published to accompany the development of the new suburbia that placed importance on the availability of a grassy space for children to play on and a space to grow fruits and vegetables that further imbued the lawn with cultural importance. Lawns began making more appearances in development plans, magazine articles, and catalogs. The lawn became less associated with being a status symbol, instead giving way to a landscape aesthetic. Improvements in the lawn mower and water supply enabled the spread of lawn culture from the Northeast to the South, where the grass grew more poorly. This in combination with setback rules, which required all homes to have a 30-foot gap between the structure and the sidewalk meant that the lawn had found a specific place in suburbia. In 1901, the United States Congress allotted $17,000 to the study of the best grasses for lawns, creating the spark for lawn care to become an industry.

===The chemical boom===
After World War II, a surplus of synthetic nitrogen in the United States led to chemical firms such as DuPont seeking to expand the market for fertilizers. The suburban lawn offered an opportunity to market fertilizers, previously only used by farmers, to homeowners. In 1955, DuPont released Uramite, a slow-release nitrogen fertilizer specifically marketed for lawns. The trend continued throughout the 1960s, with chemical firms such as DuPont and Monsanto utilizing television advertising and other forms of advertisement to market pesticides, fertilizers, and herbicides. The environmental impacts of this widespread chemical use were noticed as early as the 1960s, but suburban lawns as a source of pollution were largely ignored.

=== Organic lawns ===
Due to the harmful effects of excessive pesticide use, fertilizer use, climate change and pollution, a movement developed in the late 20th century to require organic lawn management. By the first decade of the 21st century, American homeowners were using ten times more pesticides per acre than farmers, poisoning an estimated 60 to 70 million birds yearly. Lawn mowers are a significant contributor to pollution released into Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, with a riding lawn mower producing the same amount of pollution in one hour of use as 34 cars. 

In recent years, some municipalities have banned synthetic pesticides and fertilizers and required organic land care techniques be used. There are many locations with organic lawns that require organic landscaping.

===United States===
Prior to European colonization, the grasses on the East Coast of North America were mostly broom straw, wild rye, and marsh grass. As Europeans moved into the region, it was noted by colonists in New England, more than others, that the grasses of the New World were inferior to those of England and that their livestock seemed to receive less nutrition from it. In fact, once livestock brought overseas from Europe spread throughout the colonies, much of the native grasses of New England disappeared, and an inventory list from the 17th century noted supplies of clover and grass seed from England. New colonists were even urged by their country and companies to bring grass seed with them to North America. By the late 17th century, a new market in imported grass seed had begun in New England.

Much of the new grasses brought by Europeans spread quickly and effectively, often ahead of the colonists. One such species, Bermuda grass (&quot;Cynodon dactylon&quot;), became the most important pasture grass for the southern colonies.

Kentucky bluegrass (&quot;Poa pratensis&quot;) is a grass native to Europe or the Middle East. It was likely carried to Midwestern United States in the early 1600s by French missionaries and spread via the waterways to the region around Kentucky. However, it may also have spread across the Appalachian Mountains after an introduction on the east coast.

Farmers at first continued to harvest meadows and marshes composed of indigenous grasses until they became overgrazed. These areas quickly fell to erosion and were overrun with less favorable plant life. Soon, farmers began to purposefully plant new species of grass in these areas, hoping to improve the quality and quantity of hay to provide for their livestock as native species had a lower nutritive value. While Middle Eastern and Europeans species of grass did extremely well on the East Coast of North America, it was a number of grasses from the Mediterranean that dominated the Western seaboard. As cultivated grasses became valued for their nutritional benefits to livestock, farmers relied less and less on natural meadows in the more colonized areas of the country. Eventually even the grasses of the Great Plains were overrun with European species that were more durable to the grazing patterns of imported livestock.

A pivotal factor in the spread of the lawn in America was the passage of legislation in 1938 of the 40-hour work week. Until then, Americans had typically worked half days on Saturdays, leaving little time to focus on their lawns. With this legislation and the housing boom following the Second World War, managed grass spaces became more commonplace. The creation in the early 20th century of country clubs and golf courses completed the rise of lawn culture.

According to study based on satellite observations by Cristina Milesi, NASA Earth System Science, its estimates: &quot;More surface area in the United States is devoted to lawns than to individual irrigated crops such as corn or wheat... area, covering about 128,000 square kilometers in all.&quot;

Lawn monoculture was a reflection of more than an interest in offsetting depreciation, it propagated the homogeneity of the suburb itself. Although lawns had been a recognizable feature in English residences since the 19th century, a revolution in industrialization and monoculture of the lawn since the Second World War fundamentally changed the ecology of the lawn. Money and ideas flowed back from Europe after the U.S. entered WWI, changing the way Americans interacted with themselves and nature, and the industrialization of war hastened the industrialization of pest control. Intensive suburbanization both concentrated and expanded the spread of lawn maintenance which meant increased inputs in not only petrochemicals, fertilizers, and pesticides, but also natural resources like water. 

Lawns became a means of performing class values for the urban middle class, in which the condition of the lawn becomes representative of moral character and social reliability. The social values associated with lawns are promoted and upheld by social pressure, laws, and chemical producers. Social pressure comes from neighbors or homeowner associations who think that the unkempt lawns of neighbors may affect their own property values or create eyesores. Pressures to maintain a lawn are also legal; there are often local or state laws against letting weeds get too tall or letting a lawn space be especially unkempt, punishable by fees or litigation. Chemical producers unwilling to lose business propagate the ideal of a lawn, making it seem unattainable without chemical aid.
Front lawns became standardized in the 1930s when, over time, specific aspects such as grass type and maintenance methods became popular. The lawn-care industry boomed, but the Great Depression of the 1930s and in the period prior to World War II made it difficult to maintain the cultural standards that had become heavily associated with the lawn due to grass seed shortages in Europe, America&#x27;s main supplier. Still, seed distributors such as Scotts Miracle-Gro Company in the United States encouraged families to continue to maintain their lawns, promoting it as a stress-relieving hobby. During the war itself, homeowners were asked to maintain the appearances of the home front, likely as a show of strength, morale, and solidarity. After World War II, the lawn aesthetic once again became a standard feature of North America, bouncing back from its minor decline in the decades before with a vengeance, particularly as a result of the housing and population boom post-war.

The VA loan in the United States let American ex-servicemen buy homes without providing a down payment, while the Federal Housing Administration offered lender inducements that aided the reduction of down payments for the average American from 30% to as little as 10%. These developments made owning your own home cheaper than renting, further enabling the spread of suburbia and its lawns.

Levittown, New York, was the beginning of the industrial suburb in the 20th century, and by proxy the industrial lawn. Between 1947 and 1951, Abraham Levitt and his sons built more than seventeen thousand homes, each with its own lawn. Abraham Levitt wrote &quot;No single feature of a suburban residential community contributes as much to the charm and beauty of the individual home and the locality as well-kept lawns&quot;. Landscaping was one of the most important factors in Levittown&#x27;s success – and no feature was more prominent than the lawn. The Levitts understood that landscaping could add to the appeal of their developments and claimed that, &quot;increase in values are most often found in neighborhoods where lawns show as green carpets&quot; and that, over the years, &quot;lawns trees and shrubs become more valuable both aesthetically and monetarily&quot;. During 1948, the first spring that Levittown had enjoyed, Levitt and Sons fertilized and reseeded all of the lawns free of charge.

The economic recession that began in 2008 has resulted in many communities worldwide to dig up their lawns and plant fruit and vegetable gardens. This has the potential to greatly change cultural values attached to the lawn, as they are increasingly viewed as environmentally and economically unviable in the modern context.

===Australia===
The appearance of the lawn in Australia followed closely after its establishment in North America and parts of Europe. Lawn was established on the so-called &quot;nature strip&quot; (a uniquely Australian term) by the 1920s and was common throughout the developing suburbs of Australia. By the 1950s, the Australian-designed Victa lawn mower was being used by the many people who had turned pastures into lawn and was also being exported to dozens of countries. Prior to the 1970s, all brush and native species were stripped from a development site and replaced with lawns that utilized imported plant species. Since the 1970s there has been an interest in using indigenous species for lawns, especially considering their lower water requirements. Lawns are also established in garden areas as well as used for the surface of sporting fields.

Over time, with consideration to the frequency of droughts in Australia, the movement towards &quot;naturalism&quot;, or the use of indigenous plant species in yards, was beneficial. These grasses were more drought resistant than their European counterparts, and many who wished to keep their lawns switched to these alternatives or allowed their green carpets to revert to the indigenous scrub in an effort to reduce the strain on water supplies. However, lawns remain a popular surface and their practical and aesthetically pleasing appearance reduces the use of water-impervious surfaces such as concrete. The growing use of rainwater storage tanks has improved the ability to maintain them.

Following recent droughts, Australia has seen a change to predominately warm-season turfgrasses, particularly in the southern states like New South Wales and Victoria which are predominately temperate climates within urban regions. The more drought tolerant grasses have been chosen by councils and homeowners for the choice of using less water compared to cool-season turfgrasses like fescue and ryegrass. Mild dormancy seems to be of little concern when high-profile areas can be oversown for short periods or nowadays, turf colourants (fake green) are very popular.

==Uses==

Lawns are a common feature of private gardens, public landscapes and parks in many parts of the world. They are created for aesthetic pleasure, as well as for sports or other outdoor recreational use. Lawns are useful as a playing surface both because they mitigate erosion and dust generated by intensive foot traffic and because they provide a cushion for players in sports such as rugby, football, soccer, cricket, baseball, golf, tennis, field hockey, and lawn bocce.

Lawns and the resulting lawn clipping waste can be used as an ingredient in making compost and is also viewed as fodder, used in the production of lawn clipping silage which is fed to livestock as a sustainable feed source.

==Types of lawn plants==

Lawns need not be, and have not always been, made up of grasses alone. There exist, for instance, moss lawns, clover lawns, thyme lawns, and tapestry lawns (made from diverse forbs). Sedges, low herbs and wildflowers, and other ground covers that can be walked upon are also used.

Thousands of varieties of grasses and grasslike plants are used for lawns, each adapted to specific conditions of precipitation and irrigation, seasonal temperatures, and sun/shade tolerances. Plant hybridizers and botanists are constantly creating and finding improved varieties of the basic species and new ones, often more economical and environmentally sustainable by needing less water, fertilizer, pest and disease treatments, and maintenance. The three basic categories are cool season grasses, warm season grasses, and grass alternatives.

===Grasses===

Many different species of grass are currently used, depending on the intended use and the climate. Coarse grasses are used where active sports are played, and finer grasses are used for ornamental lawns for their visual effects. Some grasses are adapted to oceanic climates with cooler summers, and others to tropical and continental climates with hotter summers. Often, a mixture of grass or low plant types is used to form a stronger lawn when one type does better in the warmer seasons and the other in the colder ones. This mixing is taken further by a form of grass breeding which produces what are known as cultivars. A cultivar is a cross-breed of two different varieties of grass and aims to combine certain traits taken from each individual breed. This creates a new strain which can be very specialised, suited to a particular environment, such as low water, low light or low nutrient.

====Cool season grasses====
Cool season grasses start growth at , and grow at their fastest rate when temperatures are between and , in climates that have relatively mild/cool summers, with two periods of rapid growth in the spring and autumn. They retain their color well in extreme cold and typically grow very dense, carpetlike lawns with relatively little thatch.

*Bluegrass (&quot;Poa&quot; spp.)
*Bentgrass (&quot;Agrostis&quot; spp.)
*Ryegrasses (&quot;Lolium&quot; spp.)
*Fescues (&quot;Festuca&quot; spp.)
*Feather reed grass (&quot;Calamagrostis&quot; spp.)
*Tufted hair grass (&quot;Deschampsia&quot; spp.)

====Warm season grasses====
Warm season grasses only start growth at temperatures above , and grow fastest when temperatures are between and , with one long growth period over the spring and summer (Huxley 1992). They often go dormant in cooler months, turning shades of tan or brown. Many warm season grasses are quite drought tolerant, and can handle very high summer temperatures, although temperatures below can kill most southern ecotype warm season grasses. The northern varieties, such as buffalograss and blue grama, are hardy to .

*Zoysiagrass (&quot;Zoysia&quot; spp.)
*Bermudagrass (&quot;Cynodon&quot; spp.)
*St. Augustine grass (&quot;Stenotaphrum secundatum&quot;)
*Bahiagrass (&quot;Paspalum&quot; spp.)
*Centipedegrass (&quot;Eremochloa ophiuroides&quot;)
*Carpet grass (&quot;Axonopus&quot; spp.)
*Buffalograss (&quot;Bouteloua dactyloides&quot;)
*Grama grass (&quot;Bouteloua&quot; spp.)
*Kikuyu grass (&quot;Pennisetum clandestinum&quot;)

=== Grass seed for shade ===
Grass seed mixes have been developed to include only grass seed species that grow will in low sunlight conditions. These seed mixes are designed to deal with light shade caused by trees that can create patchiness, or slightly heavier shade that prevents the full growth of grass. Most lawns will experience shade in some shape or form due to surrounding fences, furniture, trees or hedges and these grass seed species&#x27; are especially useful in the Northern Hemisphere and Northwestern Europe.

* &quot;Festuca rubra subsp. commutata (&quot;Chewings Fescue)
* &quot;Poa pratensis (&quot;Smooth Stalked Meadow Grass)
* &quot;Festuca ovina (&quot;Sheeps Fescue)
* &quot;Festuca trachyphylla (&quot;hard fescue)
* &quot;Festuca rubra (&quot;Strong Creeping Red Fescue)

===Sedges===
&quot;Carex&quot; species and cultivars are well represented in the horticulture industry as &#x27;sedge&#x27; alternatives for &#x27;grass&#x27; in mowed lawns and garden meadows. Both low-growing and spreading ornamental cultivars and native species are used in for sustainable landscaping as low-maintenance and drought-tolerant grass replacements for lawns and garden meadows. Wildland habitat restoration projects and natural landscaping and gardens also use them for &#x27;user-friendly&#x27; areas. The J. Paul Getty Museum has used &quot;Carex pansa&quot; (meadow sedge) and &quot;Carex praegracilis&quot; (dune sedge) expansively in the Sculpture Gardens in Los Angeles.

:Some lower sedges used are:
*&quot;Carex caryophyllea&quot; (cultivar &#x27;The Beatles&#x27;)
*&quot;C. divulsa&quot; (Berkeley sedge)
*&quot;C. glauca&quot; (blue sedge) (syn. &quot;C. flacca&quot;)
*&quot;C. pansa&quot; (meadow sedge)
*&quot;C. praegracilis&quot; (dune sedge)
*&quot;C. subfusca&quot; (mountain sedge)
*&quot;C. tumulicola&quot; (foothill sedge) (cultivar &#x27;Santa Cruz Mnts. selection&#x27;)
*&quot;C. uncifolia&quot; (ruby sedge)

===Other ground-cover plants===

Moss lawns do well in shaded areas under trees, and require only about 1% of the water of a traditional grass lawn once established. Clover lawns do especially well in damp, alkaline soils. Yarrow lawns are drought resistant, can be mowed to form a soft, comfortable turf; common yarrow is native throughout Europe, North America, and parts of Asia, and spreads vegetatively to cover the ground. Camomile lawns and thyme lawns are fragrant (and native to Europe an North Africa). &quot;Soleirolia soleirolii&quot; favours shaded, damp spaces (and is often used in tsubo-niwas); it is native to the European side of the Mediterranean, and can be invasive elsewhere.

Other low ground covers suitable for lawns include Corsican mint (native to three mediterranean islands, invasive), Ophiopogon planiscapus (native to Japan), &quot;Lippia&quot; and lawnleaf, (native to Central America and southern North America), purple flowering &quot;Mazus&quot; (native to East Asia), grey &quot;Dymondia&quot; (native to South Africa), creeping sedums (various species native to various continents), &quot;Cotula&quot; species (ditto), and creeping jenny (native to Europe). 

==== Eastern North America ====
Some plants native to Eastern North America that can be used as alternatives to grass lawns or incorporated into lawns are:
* Common yarrow 
* Virginia springbeauty
* Wild strawberry
* Dwarf cinquefoil
* Moss phlox
* Creeping phlox
* Sensitive fern
* Canadian wild ginger
* Cinnamon fern
* Lyreleaf sage 
* Allegheny pachysandra
* Woodland stonecrop
* Green-and-gold
* Beetleweed
* Blue-eyed grass
* Common blue violet
* Dwarf crested iris
* Wild pink 
* Purple wood sorrel
* Spotted cranesbill

==Alternatives to lawns==
Alternatives to lawns include meadows, drought-tolerant xeriscape gardens, natural landscapes, native plant habitat gardens, paved Spanish courtyard and patio gardens, butterfly gardens, rain gardens, and kitchen gardens. Trees and shrubs in close proximity to lawns provide habitat for birds in traditional, cottage and wildlife gardens.

==Lawn care and maintenance==
Seasonal lawn establishment and care varies depending on the climate zone and type of lawn grown.

===Planting and seeding===

Early autumn, spring, and early summer are the primary seasons to seed, lay sod (turf), plant &#x27;liners&#x27;, or &#x27;sprig&#x27; new lawns, when the soil is warmer and air cooler. Seeding is the least expensive, but may take longer for the lawn to be established. Aerating just before planting/seeding may promote deeper root growth and thicker turf.

Sodding (American English), or turfing (British English), provides an almost instant lawn, and can be undertaken in most temperate climates in any season, but is more expensive and more vulnerable to drought until established. Hydroseeding is a quick, less expensive method of planting large, sloped or hillside landscapes. Some grasses and sedges are available and planted from &#x27;liner&#x27; and containers, from &#x27;flats&#x27;, &#x27;plugs&#x27; or &#x27;sprigs&#x27;, and are planted apart to grow together.
===Fertilizers and chemicals===

Various organic and inorganic or synthetic fertilizers are available, with instant or time-release applications. Pesticides, which includes biological and chemical herbicides, insecticides and fungicides, treating diseases like gray leaf spot, are available. Consideration for their effects on the lawn and garden ecosystem and via runoff and dispersion on the surrounding environment, inform laws constraining their use. For example, the Canadian province of Quebec and over 130 municipalities prohibit the use of synthetic lawn pesticides. The Ontario provincial government promised in September 2007 to also implement a province-wide ban on the cosmetic use of lawn pesticides, for protecting the public. Medical and environmental groups supported such a ban. 

On 22 April 2008, the Provincial Government of Ontario announced that it would pass legislation that would prohibit, province-wide, the cosmetic use and sale of lawn and garden pesticides. The Ontario legislation would also echo Massachusetts law requiring pesticide manufacturers to reduce the toxins they use in production. Experts advise that a healthy lawn contains at least some &quot;weeds&quot; and insects, discouraging indiscriminate use of potentially harmful chemicals.

Sustainable gardening uses organic horticulture methods, such as organic fertilizers, biological pest control, beneficial insects, and companion planting, among other methods, to sustain an attractive lawn in a safe garden. An example of an organic herbicide is corn gluten meal, which releases an &#x27;organic dipeptide&#x27; into the soil to inhibit root formation of germinating weed seeds. An example of an organic alternative to insecticide use is applying beneficial nematodes to combat soil-dwelling grubs, such as the larvae of chafer beetles. The Integrated Pest Management approach is a coordinated low impact approach.

===Mowing and other maintenance practices===


Maintaining a rough lawn requires only occasional cutting with a suitable machine, or grazing by animals. Maintaining a smooth and closely cut lawn, be it for aesthetic or practical reasons or because social pressure from neighbors and local municipal ordinances requires it, necessitates more organized and regular treatments. Usually once a week is adequate for maintaining a lawn in most climates. However, in the hot and rainy seasons of regions contained in hardiness zones greater than 8, lawns may need to be maintained up to two times a week.

==Social impacts==
The prevalence of the lawns in films such as &quot;Pleasantville&quot; (1998) and &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot; (1990) alludes to the importance of the lawn as a social mechanism that gives great importance to visual representation of the American suburb as well as its practised culture. It is implied that a neighbor whose lawn is not in pristine condition is morally corrupt, emphasizing the role a well-kept lawn plays in neighborly and community relationships. In both of these films, green space surrounding a house in the suburbs becomes an indicator of moral integrity as well as of social and gender norms – lawn care has long been associated with men. These lawns also reinforce class and societal norms by subtly excluding those who may not have been able to afford a house with a lawn. 

The lawn as a reflection of someone&#x27;s character and the neighborhood at large is not restricted to films; the same theme appears in &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; (1925), by American novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald. Character Nick Carraway rents the house next to Gatsby&#x27;s and fails to maintain his lawn according to West Egg standards. The rift between the two lawns troubles Gatsby to the point that he dispatches his gardener to mow Carraway&#x27;s grass and thereby establish uniformity.

Most lawn-care equipment over the decades has been advertised to men, and companies have long associated good lawn-care with good citizenship in their marketing campaigns. The appearance of a healthy lawn was meant to imply the health of the man taking care of it; controlled weeds and strict boundaries became a practical application of the desire to control nature, as well as an expression of control over personal lives once working full-time became central to suburban success. Women were encultured over time to view the lawn as part of the household, as an essential furnishing, and to encourage their husbands to maintain a lawn for the family and community reputation.

During World War II (1939–1945), women became the focus of lawn-care companies in the absence of their husbands and sons. These companies promoted lawn care as a necessary means by which women could help support their male family-members and American patriotism as a whole. The image of the lawn changed from focusing on technology and manhood to emphasizing aesthetic pleasure and the health benefits derived from its maintenance; advertisers at lawn care companies assumed that women would not respond positively to images of efficiency and power. The language of these marketing campaigns still intended to imbue the female population with notions of family, motherhood, and the duties of a wife; it has been argued that this was done so that it would be easier for men returning from war to resume the roles which their wives had taken over in their absence. This was especially apparent in the 1950s and 1960s, when lawn-care rhetoric emphasized the lawn as a husband&#x27;s responsibility and as a pleasurable hobby when he retired.

There are differences in the particulars of lawn maintenance and appearance, such as the length of the grass, species (and therefore its color), and mowing.

==Environmental concerns==

On average, greater amounts of chemical fertilizer, herbicide and pesticide are used to maintain a given area of lawn than on an equivalent area of cultivated farmland. The use of these products causes environmental pollution, disturbance in the lawn ecosystem, and health risks to humans and wildlife.

In response to environmental concerns, organic landscaping and organic lawn management systems have been developed and are mandated in some municipalities and properties. In the United Kingdom, the environmental group Plantlife has encouraged gardeners to refrain from mowing in the month of May to encourage plant diversity and provide nectar for insects.

Other concerns, criticisms, and ordinances regarding lawns arise from wider environmental consequences:
* Lawns can reduce biodiversity, especially when the lawn covers a large area. Traditional lawns often replace plant species that feed pollinators, requiring bees and butterflies to cross &quot;wastelands&quot; to reach food and host plants. Lawns promote homogenization and are normally cleared of unwanted plant and animal species, typically with synthetic pesticides, which can also kill unintended target species. They may be composed of introduced species not native to the area, particularly in the United States. This can produce a habitat that supports a reduced number of wildlife species. 
* Lawn maintenance commonly involves use of fertilizers and synthetic pesticides, which can cause great harm. Some are carcinogens and endocrine disruptors. They may permanently linger in the environment and negatively affect the health of potentially all nearby organisms. The United States Environmental Protection Agency estimated in 2012 that nearly of active pesticide ingredients are used on suburban lawns each year in the United States. There are indications of an emerging regulatory response to this issue. For example, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Kuwait, and Belize have placed restrictions on the use of the herbicide 2,4-D.

*It has been estimated that nearly of gasoline are spilled each summer while re-fueling garden and lawn-care equipment in the United States: approximately 50% more than that spilled during the Exxon Valdez incident.
*The use of pesticides and fertilizers, requiring fossil fuels for manufacturing, distribution, and application, has been shown to contribute to global warming. (Sustainable organic techniques have been shown to help reduce global warming.) A hectare of lawn in Nashville, Tennessee, produces greenhouse gases equivalent to 697 to 2,443 kg of carbon dioxide a year. The higher figure is equivalent to a flight more than halfway around the world. Lawn mowing is one element of lawn culture that causes a great amount of emissions (which can be mitigated by replacing lawn mowers with grazing livestock). 
===Water conservation===
Maintaining a green lawn sometimes requires large amounts of water. While natural rainfall is usually sufficient to maintain a lawn&#x27;s health in the temperate British Isles- the birthplace of the concept of the lawn- in times of drought hosepipe bans may be implemented by the water suppliers. Conversely, exportation of the lawn ideal to more arid regions (e.g. U.S. Southwest and Australia) strains water supply systems when water supplies are already scarce. This necessitates upgrades to larger, more environmentally invasive equipment to deal with increased demand due to lawn watering. Grass typically goes dormant during periods of cold or heat outside of its preferred temperature ranges; dormancy reduces the grasses&#x27; water demand. Most grasses typically recover quite well from a drought, but many property owners become concerned about the brown appearance and increase watering during the summer months. &quot;Water in Australia&quot; observed 1995 data that up to 90% of the water used in Canberra during summer drought periods was used for watering lawns.

In the United States, 50 to 70% of residential water is used for landscaping, with most used to water lawns. A 2005 NASA study estimated conservatively of irrigated lawn in the US, three times the area of irrigated corn. That translates to about of drinking-quality fresh water per person per day is required to keep up United States&#x27; lawn surface area.

In 2022, the state of Nevada pass a bill that not only banned the installation of new lawns in the state, but also mandated the removal of any lawn deemed &quot;nonfunctional.&quot; This was in response to a years-long drought in the state. 

===Chemicals===
An increased concern from the general public over pesticide and fertilizer use and their associated health risks, combined with the implementation of the legislation, such as the US Food Quality Protection Act, has resulted in the reduced presence of synthetic chemicals, namely pesticides, in urban landscapes such as lawns in the late 20th century. Many of these concerns over the safety and environmental impact of some of the synthetic fertilizers and pesticides has led to their ban by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and many local governments. The use of pesticides and other chemicals to care for lawns has also led to the death of nearly 7 million birds each year, a topic that was central to the novel &quot;Silent Spring&quot; by the conservationist Rachel Carson.

The use of lawn chemicals made its first appearance in the 18th century through the introduction of &quot;English garden&quot; fads. These types of lawns put precise hedging, clean cut grass, and extravagant plants on display. Following the initial introduction of lawn chemicals, they have still been continually used throughout North America. Because many of the turf-grass species in North America are not native to our ecosystems, they require extensive maintenance. According to the United States Geological Survey, 99% of the urban water samples that were tested contained one or more types of pesticides. In addition to water contamination, chemicals are making their way into houses which can lead to chronic exposure. Currently, standards for pesticide management practices have been put in place through the Food Quality Protection Act.

===Environmental impact===

In the United States, lawn heights are generally maintained by gasoline-powered lawn mowers, which contribute to urban smog during the summer months. The EPA found, in some urban areas, up to 5% of smog was due to small gasoline engines made before 1997, such as are typically used on lawn mowers. Since 1997, the EPA has mandated emissions controls on newer engines in an effort to reduce smog.

A 2010 study seemed to show lawn care inputs were balanced by the carbon sequestration benefits of lawns, and they may not be contributors to anthropogenic global warming. Lawns with high maintenance (mowing, irrigation, and leaf blowing) and high fertilization rates have a net emission of carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide that have large global warming potential. Lawns that are fertilized, irrigated, and mowed weekly have a lower species diversity.

Replacing turf grass with low-maintenance groundcovers or employing a variety of low-maintenance perennials, trees and shrubs can be a good alternative to traditional lawn spaces, especially in hard-to-grow or hard-to-mow areas, as it can reduce maintenance requirements, associated pollution and offers higher aesthetic and wildlife value. Growing a mixed variety of flowering plants instead of turfgrass is sometimes referred to as meadowscaping.

=== Non-productive space ===
Lawns take up space that could otherwise be used more productively, such as for urban agriculture or home gardening. This is the case in many cities and suburbs in the United States, where open or unused spaces are &quot;not generally a result of a positive decision to leave room for some use, but rather is an expression of a pastoral aesthetic norm that prizes spacious lawns and the zoning restrictions and neighborhood covenants that give these norms the force of law.&quot;

In urban and suburban spaces, growing food in front yards and parking strips can not only provide fresh produce but also be a source of neighborhood pride. While converting lawn space into strictly utilitarian farms is not common, incorporating edible plants into front yards with sustainable and aesthetically pleasing design is of growing interest in the United States.

<text>Serge Koussevitzky (born Sergey Aleksandrovich Kusevitsky; , ; 4 June 1951) was a Russian and American conductor, composer, and double-bassist, known for his long tenure as music director of the Boston Symphony Orchestra from 1924 to 1949.

==Biography==

===Early career===
Koussevitzky was born into a Jewish family of professional musicians in Vyshny Volochyok, Tver Governorate (present-day Tver Oblast), about 250 km northwest of Moscow, Russia. His parents taught him violin, cello, and piano. He also learned trumpet. At the age of fourteen he received a scholarship to the Musico-Dramatic Institute of the Moscow Philharmonic Society, where he studied double bass with Rambusek and music theory. He excelled at the bass, joining the Bolshoi Theatre orchestra at the age of twenty, in 1894, and succeeded his teacher, Rambusek, as the principal bassist in 1901. That same year, according to some sources, he made his début (25 March) as a soloist in Moscow, although his biographer Moses Smith states he made his solo début earlier in 1896; he later won critical acclaim with his first recital in Berlin in 1903. In 1902 he married the dancer Nadezhda Galat. The same year, with Reinhold Glière&#x27;s help, he wrote a popular concerto for the double bass, which he premiered in Moscow in 1905. In 1905, Koussevitzky divorced Nadezhda and married Natalie Ushkova, the daughter of an extremely wealthy tea merchant. He soon resigned from the Bolshoi, and the couple moved to Berlin, where Serge studied conducting under Arthur Nikisch, using his wife&#x27;s wealth to pay off his teacher&#x27;s gambling debts.

===Conductor and publisher===

In Berlin he continued to give double bass recitals and, after two years practising conducting in his own home with a student orchestra, he hired the Berlin Philharmonic and made his professional début as a conductor in 1908. The concert included Sergei Rachmaninoff&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 2, with the composer at the piano. The next year he and his wife returned to Russia, where he founded his own orchestra in Moscow and branched out into the publishing business, forming his own firm, Éditions Russes de Musique, and buying the catalogues of many of the greatest composers of the age. Among the composers published by Koussevitzky were Rachmaninoff, Alexander Scriabin, Sergei Prokofiev, Igor Stravinsky, and Nikolai Medtner. During the period 1909 to 1920 he continued to perform as soloist in Europe, and in Russia he and his orchestra toured towns along the Volga River by riverboat in 1910, 1912, and 1914. The programs included many new works. After the 1917 Russian Revolution, he accepted a position as conductor of the newly named State Philharmonic Orchestra of Petrograd (1917–1920). In 1920, he left Soviet Russia for Berlin and Paris. In Paris he organized the &quot;Concerts Koussevitzky&quot; (1921–1929), presenting new works by Prokofiev, Stravinsky, and Maurice Ravel. In 1924 he took a post in the United States, replacing Pierre Monteux as conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra. However, he continued to return to Paris in the summers to conduct his &quot;Concerts Koussevitzky&quot; until 1929. In 1941 he and his wife became United States citizens.

===In America===

Koussevitzky&#x27;s appointment as conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra (BSO) was the beginning of a golden era for the ensemble that would continue until 1949. Over that 25-year period, he built the ensemble&#x27;s reputation into that of a leading American orchestra. Together with Gertrude Robinson Smith he played a central role in developing the orchestra&#x27;s internationally acclaimed summer concert and educational programs at Tanglewood where today the 5,700-seat main performance venue bears his name. In the early 1940s, he discovered a young tenor named Alfred Cocozza (who would later be known as Mario Lanza), and provided him with a scholarship to attend Tanglewood. With the Boston Symphony he made numerous recordings, most of which were well regarded by critics. His students and protégés included Leonard Bernstein, Eleazar de Carvalho, Samuel Adler, and Sarah Caldwell. Bernstein once received a pair of cufflinks from Koussevitzky as a gift, and thereafter wore them at every concert he conducted.

===Personal life===
Koussevitzky&#x27;s first wife was Bolshoi ballet dancer Nadezheda Galat, whom he married at an unknown date probably before 1903; he divorced her in 1905 and married Natalya (Natalie) Ushkov on 8 September of that year.

Koussevitzky&#x27;s second wife Natalie died in 1942, and he created the Koussevitzky Music Foundations in her honor. In late 1947, he married Olga Naumova (1901–1978), Natalie&#x27;s niece. Naumova had lived with the couple and acted as their secretary for 18 years. Olga Naumova was the daughter of the distinguished politician and civil servant Aleksandr Naumov (1868, Simbirsk – 1950, Nice, France) who served as Minister of Agriculture in the Russian Imperial Cabinet. She has been described as quiet, and soft-spoken, and Leonard Bernstein and Aaron Copland counted her among their close friends.

His nephew Faviy Adolfovich Koussevitzky, known professionally as Fabien Sevitzky, was music director of the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra from 1937 until 1955. Sevitzky changed his surname in order to mitigate accusations of nepotism against him.

Koussevitzky died in Boston in 1951 and was buried alongside his wife Natalie at the Church on the Hill Cemetery in Lenox. His pet is buried at the Pine Ridge Pet Cemetery in Dedham.

==Champion of contemporary music==
Koussevitzky was a great champion of modern music, commissioning a number of works from prominent composers. During his time in Paris in the early 1920s he programmed much contemporary music, ensuring well-prepared and good quality performances. Among the well-received premieres were Arthur Honegger&#x27;s &quot;Pacific 231&quot;, George Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;Second Rhapsody&quot; and Albert Roussel&#x27;s &quot;Suite in F&quot;.

For the Boston Symphony Orchestra&#x27;s 50th anniversary, he commissioned Copland&#x27;s &quot;Ode&quot;, Prokofiev&#x27;s Symphony No. 4 (which Prokofiev later revised), Paul Hindemith&#x27;s &quot;Concert Music for Strings and Brass&quot;, and Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Symphony of Psalms&quot;, as well as works by Albert Roussel and Howard Hanson. In 1922, Koussevitzky commissioned Maurice Ravel&#x27;s arrangement of Modest Mussorgsky&#x27;s 1874 suite for piano, &quot;Pictures at an Exhibition&quot;, which was premiered on 19 October that year and quickly became the most famous and celebrated orchestration of the work. Koussevitzky held the rights to this version for many years.
In 1940, Koussevitzky commissioned Randall Thompson, then a professor at the University of Virginia and director of the men&#x27;s Glee club, to write a new piece for performance at Tanglewood. Koussevitzky had a large-scale festival piece in mind, but with World War II underway and France having fallen to Germany, Thompson could not find such an inspiration. Instead, he produced his unaccompanied &quot;Alleluia&quot; – with the word sung 64 times in the Russian manner – which became his most frequently performed work.

==Legacy==

In 1915, Claude Debussy dedicated the first movement of his &quot;En blanc et noir&quot; for two pianos to Koussevitzky.

As an avid supporter of new music, Koussevitzky created the Koussevitzky Music Foundations in 1942. The basic aim of the foundations was to assist composers by commissioning new compositions and underwriting the cost of their performance. New works created with the foundations&#x27; support include: Benjamin Britten&#x27;s opera &quot;Peter Grimes&quot;, Douglas Moore&#x27;s opera &quot;The Ballad of Baby Doe&quot;, Béla Bartók&#x27;s &quot;Concerto for Orchestra&quot;, Aaron Copland&#x27;s &quot;Symphony No. 3&quot;, Henri Dutilleux&#x27;s string quartet &quot;Ainsi la nuit&quot; and Olivier Messiaen&#x27;s &quot;Turangalîla-Symphonie&quot;.

Following Koussevitzky&#x27;s 1951 death, his widow, Olga Koussevitzky, presented double-bassist Gary Karr with his double bass, once believed to have been made in 1611 by brothers Antonio and Girolamo Amati. The instrument now bears the names of both Karr and Koussevitzky, and has been played by bassist Scott Pingel and the San Francisco Academy Orchestra.

In 1956, the American composer Howard Hanson, a friend of Koussevitzky, wrote his &quot;Elegy for Serge Koussevitzky.&quot;

The Tanglewood Music Center awards the Koussevitzky Prize for outstanding student conductor. It has been awarded since 1954, but unlike many prizes, it is not awarded annually. Past winners have included Seiji Ozawa (1960), Russell Peck (1966), and Michael Tilson Thomas (1969).

The Musicians Club of New York, of which Olga Koussevitzky was president from 1962 to 1975, presents the Serge and Olga Koussevitzky Young Artist Awards. Three prizes are awarded annually in categories that rotate between voice, strings, piano, and woodwind/brass. Winners have included Judith Raskin (1956), Jean Kraft (1959), Robert DeGaetano (1969), Paul Neubauer (1982) and François Salque (1994).

==Recordings==
Serge Koussevitzky recorded with the Boston Symphony exclusively for Victor/ RCA Victor, except for a live recording made for Columbia Records, the &quot;Symphony 1933&quot; composed by Roy Harris, recorded in Carnegie Hall, New York, during a concert, using portable equipment. One quite notable early RCA Victor session in Boston&#x27;s Symphony Hall in 1929 was devoted to an early recording of Ravel&#x27;s &quot;Boléro&quot;, and his first sessions with the Boston orchestra of Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Pastoral&quot; Symphony and a suite from Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Petrushka&quot; were recorded in Symphony Hall in 1927.

Some of Koussevitzky&#x27;s later recordings, including performances of the second suite from Prokofiev&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; (1945, Symphony Hall, Boston), first symphony (1947, Carnegie Hall, New York, a session that included Mendelssohn&#x27;s &quot;Italian&quot; Symphony), and fifth symphony (1945, Symphony Hall, Boston), were reportedly mastered on RCA&#x27;s sound film optical recording process, first employed in this way with the San Francisco Symphony in March 1942.

Koussevitzky&#x27;s final recordings, made in November 1950, on magnetic tape using RCA&#x27;s proprietary RT-21 two-track, -inch machines at 30 inches per second, were acclaimed performances of Sibelius&#x27;s Second Symphony and Grieg&#x27;s &quot;The Last Spring&quot;. Both have been re-released by RCA on CD in Taiwan. Films of some of Koussevitzky&#x27;s performances at Tanglewood, including a very spirited Beethoven &quot;Egmont Overture&quot;, were made during the 1940s.

Several of the Koussevitzky/ Boston Symphony&#x27;s 78 rpm recordings with were reissued on LP on the bargain RCA Camden label, originally released at US$1.98 for a 12-inch LP album when premium priced Red Seal records were selling for US$5.98, in the early 1950s as the &quot;Centennial Symphony Orchestra&quot;. One of the later albums featured Prokofiev&#x27;s &quot;Peter and the Wolf&quot; and Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Till Eulenspiegel&#x27;s Merry Pranks&quot;; while the orchestra was again listed as the Centennial Symphony and the conductor not identified, the narrator, actor Richard Hale, was. Koussevitzky rerecorded the piece in Tanglewood with Eleanor Roosevelt narrating during the summer of 1950 on magnetic tape; originally issued on a ten-inch LP and three 45 rpm records, it has never been reissued officially by RCA in spite of the popularity of the Camden disc with Hale. Hale was also the narrator for Arthur Fiedler&#x27;s 1953 RCA Victor recording of the same music with the Boston Pops Orchestra. RCA Victor reissued several other historic orchestral recordings on its Camden label with spurious names to avoid having them in direct competition with newer recordings by the same artists on the upscale Red Seal label.

<doc id="317945" wikidata="Q158017" url="?curid=317945" title="Rafael Kubelík">
<text>Rafael Jeroným Kubelík, KBE (29 June 1914 – 11 August 1996) was a Czech conductor and composer.

The son of a distinguished violinist, Jan Kubelík, he was trained in Prague and made his debut with the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra at the age of 19. Having managed to maintain a career in Czechoslovakia under the Nazi occupation, he refused to work under what he considered a &quot;second tyranny&quot; after the Communist Czechoslovak coup d&#x27;état of 1948, and took refuge in Britain. He became a Swiss citizen in 1967.

Kubelík was music director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra (1950–53), musical director of The Royal Opera, Covent Garden (1955–58). In 1957, he conducted and recorded the World premiere Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;Les Troyens.&quot; From 1961 to 1979, he was music director of the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, and was a frequent guest conductor for leading orchestras in Europe and America.

As a composer, Kubelík wrote in a neo-romantic idiom. His works include five operas, three symphonies, chamber music, choral works, and songs.

==Life and career==
===Early life===
Kubelík was born in Býchory, Bohemia, Austria-Hungary, today&#x27;s Czech Republic, the day after Archduke Ferdinand&#x27;s assassination that triggered the First World War. He was the sixth child of the Bohemian violinist Jan Kubelík, whom the younger Kubelík described as &quot;a kind of god to me&quot;. His mother was a Hungarian countess, Anna Julie Marie Széll von Bessenyö. Kubelík studied the violin with his father, and entered the Prague Conservatory at the age of 14, studying violin, piano, composition, and conducting. He graduated from the conservatory in 1933, at the age of 19; at his graduation concert he played a Paganini concerto and a composition of his own for violin and orchestra. Kubelík was also an accomplished pianist, and served as his father&#x27;s accompanist on a tour of the United States in 1935.

===Brno===
In 1939, Kubelík became music director of the Brno Opera, a position he held until the Nazis shut the company down in November 1941. The Nazis allowed the Czech Philharmonic to continue operating; Kubelík, who had first conducted the orchestra when he was 19, became its principal conductor. In 1943 he married the Czech violinist Ludmilla Bertlová, with whom he had one son.

In 1944, after various incidents, including one in which he declined to greet the Nazi Reichsprotektor Karl Hermann Frank with a Hitler salute, along with his refusal to conduct Wagner during the War, Kubelík &quot;deemed it advisable to disappear from Prague and to spend a few months undercover in the countryside so as not to fall into the clutches of the SS or Gestapo&quot;. Kubelík conducted the orchestra&#x27;s first post-war concert in May 1945. In 1946, he helped found the Prague Spring Festival, and conducted its opening concert.

===Defection===
After the Communist coup of February 1948, Kubelík left Czechoslovakia, vowing not to return until the country was liberated. &quot;I had lived through one form of bestial tyranny, Nazism,&quot; he told an interviewer, &quot;As a matter of principle I was not going to live through another.&quot; He defected during a trip to Britain, where he had flown to conduct Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; with the Glyndebourne company at the Edinburgh Festival. He had been engaged on the recommendation of Bruno Walter, whom Kubelík had assisted in this work at the 1937 Salzburg Festival. Kubelík told his wife of his decision to defect as their plane left Czechoslovakia.

In 1953, the Communist government convicted the couple &quot;in absentia&quot; of &quot;taking illicit leave&quot; abroad. In 1956, the regime invited him back &quot;with promises of freedom to do anything I wanted,&quot; said Kubelík, but he refused the invitation. In a 1957 letter to &quot;The Times&quot;, Kubelík said he would seriously consider returning only when all the country&#x27;s political prisoners were freed and all émigrés were given as much freedom as he would have possessed. He was invited back by the regime in 1966 but again refused; in 1968, after the Prague Spring had been ended by the Soviet invasion, he organised an international boycott, in which many of the major classical artists of the West participated.

===Chicago, Covent Garden and Munich===

In 1950, Kubelík became music director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, choosing the position over an offer from the BBC to succeed Sir Adrian Boult as chief conductor of the BBC Symphony Orchestra. He left the post in 1953. Some hold that he was &quot;hounded out of the [Chicago] job&quot; (to quote &quot;Time magazine&quot;) by the &quot;savage attacks&quot; (to quote the &quot;New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot;) of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; music critic Claudia Cassidy. But &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; music critic Robert C. Marsh argued in 1972 that it was the Chicago Symphony trustees who were behind the departure. Their foremost complaint, and that of Cassidy as well, was that Kubelík introduced too many contemporary works (about 70) to the orchestra; there were also objections to his demanding exhaustive rehearsals and engaging several black artists. Many recordings made by Kubelík in Chicago for Mercury Records are available on CD, and have received critical praise. Kubeliki&#x27;s landmark recording of &quot;Pictures at an Exhibition&quot; with the CSO on Mercury led &quot;New York Times&quot; music critic Howard Taubman to observe that listening to it was like &quot;being in the living presence of the orchestra,&quot; and Mercury began releasing their classical recordings under the &quot;Living Presence&quot; series name.

After leaving Chicago, Kubelík toured the US with the Concertgebouw Orchestra, and, in the words of Lionel Salter in the &quot;Grove Dictionary&quot;, &quot;had a brilliant success with Janáček&#x27;s Kát&#x27;a Kabanová at Sadler&#x27;s Wells in London in 1954&quot;. Kubelík became musical director of The Royal Opera, Covent Garden, from 1955 to 1958. Among his achievements there was, in 1957, the first practically complete production in any opera house of Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;Les Troyens&quot;. Although Covent Garden sought to renew his contract, he chose to leave, partly because of a campaign by Sir Thomas Beecham against the engagement of foreign artists at Covent Garden. In 1961 Kubelík accepted the position of music director of the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra (BRSO) in Munich. He remained with the BRSO until 1979, when he retired. Salter considers this 18-year association the high point of Kubelík&#x27;s career, both artistically and professionally.

In 1961 Ludmilla Kubelík died after a car crash. Also in 1961, he premiered the concerto performance version of Schoenberg&#x27;s &quot;Jakobsleiter-Fragment&quot; in Vienna, with the Cologne Radio Symphony Orchestra and choir.

In 1963 Kubelík married the Australian soprano Elsie Morison (1924–2016). In 1967 he became a Swiss citizen, and began an association with the Lucerne Festival, in addition to his work with the BRSO.

In 1971, Göran Gentele, the new general manager of the Metropolitan Opera, New York, asked Kubelík to accept the position of music director. Kubelík accepted partly because of his strong artistic relationship with Gentele. The first production he conducted as the Met&#x27;s music director was &quot;Les Troyens&quot;. The death of Gentele in a road accident in 1972 undermined Kubelík&#x27;s reasons for working at the opera house. He had prior conducting commitments away from the Met in his first season there, which diverted his attention. He resigned from the Met in 1974, after only six months in the post.

In his post-Czechoslovakian career, Kubelík worked with the Berlin Philharmonic, Boston Symphony, Chicago Symphony, Cleveland, Israel Philharmonic, London Symphony, New York Philharmonic, Vienna Philharmonic and Royal Concertgebouw orchestras, among others. His final concert was with the Czech Philharmonic.

===Last years===
In 1985, ill-health (notably severe arthritis in his back) caused Kubelík to retire from full-time conducting, but the fall of Communism in his native land led him to accept an invitation to return in 1990 to conduct the Czech Philharmonic at the festival he had founded, the Prague Spring Festival. He recorded Smetana&#x27;s &quot;Má Vlast&quot; live with the Czech Philharmonic for Supraphon, his fifth recording of the piece. He also recorded the Mozart &quot;Prague&quot; Symphony and Dvořák&#x27;s &quot;New World&quot; Symphony at the festival. During the rehearsal of the &quot;New World,&quot; he told the Czech Philharmonic, &quot;It is my joy to hear this. I always wanted it to sound like this but never really found it with any other orchestra in the world. That eighth [note] is great!&quot;

On October 18, 1991, Kubelík shared the podium with Sir Georg Solti and Daniel Barenboim and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in a performance that re-created the orchestra&#x27;s inaugural October 16 and 17, 1891, concerts. Kubelík led the final work on the program: Antonín Dvořák&#x27;s &quot;Husitská&quot; Overture.

Kubelík died in 1996, aged 82, in Kastanienbaum, in the Canton of Lucerne, Switzerland. His ashes are interred next to the grave of his father in Slavín, Vyšehrad cemetery in Prague.

===Compositions===
Among Kubelík&#x27;s compositions are five operas, three symphonies, three settings of the requiem, other choral works, many pieces of chamber music, and songs. Salter describes his musical style as &quot;neo-romantic&quot;.

==Selected recordings==
Kubelík recorded a large repertory, in many cases more than once per work. There are two complete recordings of his traversals of three major symphony cycles – those of Brahms, Schumann, and Beethoven. When Kubelík recorded his first complete Beethoven symphony cycle for Deutsche Grammophon, he employed nine different orchestras, one for each symphony. His complete cycle of Mahler&#x27;s symphonies (recorded from 1967 to 1971 with the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra) is highly regarded. Of his Mahler, Daniel Barenboim remarked, &quot;I often thought I was missing something in Mahler until I listened to Kubelík. There is a lot more to be discovered in these pieces than just a generalized form of extrovert excitement. That is what Kubelík showed.&quot; Kubelík also left much-admired recordings of operas by Verdi (his &quot;Rigoletto&quot; was recorded at La Scala with Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau), Mozart, Janáček, Dvořák and others, including Wagner, whose music he had shunned during the war, but which he conducted in later years. His recordings of &quot;Die Meistersinger&quot; and &quot;Parsifal&quot; have been ranked the top choice by many critics, including BBC Radio 3&#x27;s Building a Library programme.

Kubelík&#x27;s complete discography is enormous, with music ranging from Malcolm Arnold to Jan Dismas Zelenka, with recordings both in the studio and in concert. In addition to complete cycles of Beethoven, Brahms, Dvořák, and Mahler, Kubelík made recordings of orchestral and operatic works by Bach, Mozart, Haydn, Tchaikovsky, Berlioz, Wagner, Verdi and many others, including modern composers.

In May 2018, Deutsche Grammophon released a 66-disc box-set of his complete recordings for the label.

<text>Music journalism (or music criticism) is media criticism and reporting about music topics, including popular music, classical music, and traditional music. Journalists began writing about music in the eighteenth century, providing commentary on what is now regarded as classical music. In the 1960s, music journalism began more prominently covering popular music like rock and pop after the breakthrough of The Beatles. With the rise of the internet in the 2000s, music criticism developed an increasingly large online presence with music bloggers, aspiring music critics, and established critics supplementing print media online. Music journalism today includes reviews of songs, albums and live concerts, profiles of recording artists, and reporting of artist news and music events.

==Origins in classical music criticism==

Music journalism has its roots in classical music criticism, which has traditionally comprised the study, discussion, evaluation, and interpretation of music that has been composed and notated in a score and the evaluation of the performance of classical songs and pieces, such as symphonies and concertos.

Before about the 1840s, reporting on music was either done by musical journals, such as the &quot;Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung&quot; (founded by Johann Friedrich Rochlitz in 1798) and the &quot;Neue Zeitschrift für Musik&quot; (founded by Robert Schumann in 1834), and in London journals such as &quot;The Musical Times&quot; (founded in 1844 as &quot;The Musical Times and Singing-class Circular&quot;); or else by reporters at general newspapers where music did not form part of the central objectives of the publication. An influential English 19th-century music critic, for example, was James William Davison of &quot;The Times.&quot; The composer Hector Berlioz also wrote reviews and criticisms for the Paris press of the 1830s and 1840s.

Modern art music journalism is often informed by music theory consideration of the many diverse elements of a musical piece or performance, including (as regards a musical composition) its form and style, and for performance, standards of technique and expression. These standards were expressed, for example, in journals such as &quot;Neue Zeitschrift für Musik&quot; founded by Robert Schumann, and are continued today in the columns of serious newspapers and journals such as &quot;The Musical Times&quot;.

Several factors—including growth of education, the influence of the Romantic movement generally and in music, popularization (including the &#x27;star-status&#x27; of many performers such as Liszt and Paganini), among others—led to an increasing interest in music among non-specialist journals, and an increase in the number of critics by profession of varying degrees of competence and integrity. The 1840s could be considered a turning point, in that music critics after the 1840s generally were not also practicing musicians. However, counterexamples include Alfred Brendel, Charles Rosen, Paul Hindemith, and Ernst Krenek; all of whom were modern practitioners of the classical music tradition who also write (or wrote) on music.

Women music journalists in the twentieth century who covered classic music performance include Ruth Scott Miller of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; (1920-1921), Henriette Weber at the Chicago &quot;Herald-Examiner&quot;, and Claudia Cassidy, who worked for &quot;Chicago Journal of Commerce&quot; (1924–1941), the &quot;Chicago Sun&quot; (1941–42) and the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; (1942–65).

==Classical==
In the early 1980s, a decline in the quantity of classical criticism began occurring &quot;when classical music criticism visibly started to disappear&quot; from the media. At that time, leading newspapers still typically employed a chief music critic, while magazines such as &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; also employed classical music critics. But by the early 1990s, classical critics were dropped in many publications, in part due to &quot;a decline of interest in classical music, especially among younger people&quot;.

Also of concern in classical music journalism was how American reviewers can write about ethnic and folk music from cultures other than their own, such as Indian ragas and traditional Japanese works. In 1990, the World Music Institute interviewed four &quot;New York Times&quot; music critics who came up with the following criteria on how to approach ethnic music:

# A review should relate the music to other kinds of music that readers know, to help them understand better what the program was about.
# &quot;The performers [should] be treated as human beings and their music [should] be treated as human activity rather than a mystical or mysterious phenomenon.&quot;
# The review should show an understanding of the music&#x27;s cultural backgrounds and intentions.

A key finding in a 2005 study of arts journalism in America was that the profile of the &quot;average classical music critic is a white, 52-year old male, with a graduate degree&quot;. Demographics indicated that the group was 74% male, 92% white, and 64% had earned a graduate degree. One critic of the study pointed out that because all newspapers were included, including low-circulation regional papers, the female representation of 26% misrepresented the actual scarcity, in that the &quot;large US papers, which are the ones that influence public opinion, have virtually no women classical music critics&quot;, with the notable exceptions of Anne Midgette in the &quot;New York Times&quot; and Wynne Delacoma in the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;.

In 2007, &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that classical music criticism, which it characterized as &quot;a high-minded endeavor that has been around at least as long as newspapers&quot;, had undergone &quot;a series of hits in recent months&quot; with the elimination, downgrading, or redefinition of critics&#x27; jobs at newspapers in Atlanta, Minneapolis, and elsewhere, citing &quot;New York&quot; magazine&#x27;s Peter G. Davis, &quot;one of the most respected voices of the craft, [who] said he had been forced out after 26 years&quot;. Viewing &quot;robust analysis, commentary and reportage as vital to the health of the art form&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated in 2007 that it continued to maintain &quot;a staff of three full-time classical music critics and three freelancers&quot;, noting also that classical music criticism had become increasingly available on blogs, and that a number of other major newspapers &quot;still have full-time classical music critics&quot;, including (in 2007) the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot;, &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;, and &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;.

===20th century rock criticism===
Music writers only started &quot;treating pop and rock music seriously&quot; in 1964 &quot;after the breakthrough of the Beatles&quot;. In their book &quot;Rock Criticism from the Beginning&quot;, Ulf Lindberg and his co-writers say that rock criticism appears to have been &quot;slower to develop in the U.S. than in England&quot;. One of the early British music magazines, &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, complained in 1967 about how &quot;newspapers and magazines are continually hammering [i.e., attacking] pop music&quot;. From 1964, &quot;Melody Maker&quot; led its rival publications in terms of approaching music and musicians as a subject for serious study rather than merely entertainment. Staff reporters such as Chris Welch and Ray Coleman applied a perspective previously reserved for jazz artists to the rise of American-influenced local rock and pop groups, anticipating the advent of rock critics. Among Britain&#x27;s broadsheet newspapers, pop music gained exposure in the arts section of &quot;The Times&quot; when William Mann, the paper&#x27;s classical music critic, wrote an appreciation of the Beatles in December 1963. In early 1965, &quot;The Observer&quot;, the country&#x27;s highbrow Sunday newspaper, signalled a reversal of the establishment&#x27;s cultural snobbery towards pop music by appointing George Melly as its &quot;critic of pop culture&quot;. Following Tony Palmer&#x27;s arrival at &quot;The Observer&quot;, the first daily newspaper to employ a dedicated rock critic was &quot;The Guardian&quot;, with the appointment of Geoffrey Cannon in 1968.

&quot;Melody Maker&quot;″s writers advocated the new forms of pop music of the late 1960s. &quot;By 1999, the &#x27;quality&#x27; press was regularly carrying reviews of popular music gigs and albums&quot;, which had a &quot;key role in keeping pop&quot; in the public eye. As more pop music critics began writing, this had the effect of &quot;legitimating pop as an art form&quot;; as a result, &quot;newspaper coverage shifted towards pop as music rather than pop as social phenomenon&quot;.

In the world of pop music criticism, there has tended to be a quick turnover. The &quot;pop music industry&quot; expects that any particular rock critic will likely disappear from popular view within five years; in contrast, according to author Mark Fenster, the &quot;stars&quot; of rock criticism are more likely to have long careers with &quot;book contracts, featured columns, and editorial and staff positions at magazines and newspapers&quot;.
Author Bernard Gendron writes that in the United States &quot;the emergence of a &#x27;serious&#x27; rock press and the rock critic&quot; began in 1966, presaged by Robert Shelton, the folk music critic for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, writing articles praising the Beatles and Bob Dylan, the last of whom had just embraced rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll by performing with electric backing at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival. Paul Williams, an eighteen-year-old student, launched the pop journal &quot;Crawdaddy!&quot; in February 1966; in June, Richard Goldstein, a recent graduate and New Journalism writer, debuted his &quot;Pop Eye&quot; column in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, which Gendron describes as &quot;the first regular column on rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll ... to appear in an established cultural publication&quot;. Rock journalist Clinton Heylin, in his role as editor of &quot;The Penguin Book of Rock &amp; Roll Writing&quot;, cites &quot;the true genesis of rock criticism&quot; to the emergence of &quot;Crawdaddy!&quot; Lindberg et al. say that, while Williams is widely considered to be the first American rock critic, he &quot;nevertheless looked to England for material&quot;.

According to Gendron, Goldstein&#x27;s most significant early pieces were a &quot;manifesto&quot; on rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll and &quot;pop aestheticism&quot;, and a laudatory assessment of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Revolver&quot; album. Published in late August, the latter article provided &quot;the first substantial rock review devoted to one album to appear in any nonrock magazine with accreditory power&quot;. Whereas Williams could be sure of a sympathetic readership, given the nature of his publication, Goldstein&#x27;s task was to win over a more highbrow readership to the artistic merits of contemporary pop music. At this time, both Goldstein and Williams gained considerable renown in the cultural mainstream and were the subject of profile articles in &quot;Newsweek&quot;.

The emergence of rock journalism coincided with an attempt to position rock music, particularly the Beatles&#x27; work, in the American cultural landscape. The critical discourse was further heightened by the respectful coverage afforded the genre in mainstream publications such as &quot;Newsweek&quot;, &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Life&quot; in the months leading up to and following the release of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; album in June 1967. Within this discourse, Richard Meltzer, in an essay for &quot;Crawdaddy!&quot; in March, challenged the highbrow aesthetic of rock proposed by Goldstein. The latter&#x27;s mixed review of &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; in &quot;The New York Times&quot; was similarly the subject of journalistic debate, and invited reprisals from musicologists, composers and cultural commentators.

Among other young American writers who became pop columnists following Goldstein&#x27;s appointment were Robert Christgau (at &quot;Esquire&quot;, from June 1967), Ellen Willis (&quot;The New Yorker&quot;, March 1968) and Ellen Sander (&quot;Saturday Review&quot;, October 1968). Christgau was the &quot;originator of the &#x27;consumer guide&#x27; approach to pop music reviews&quot;, an approach that was designed to help readers decide whether to buy a new album.

According to popular music academic Roy Shuker in 1994, music reference books such as &quot;The Rolling Stone Record Guide&quot; and &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide&quot; played a role in the rise of rock critics as tastemakers in the music industry, &quot;constructing their own version of the traditional high/low culture split, usually around notions of artistic integrity, authenticity, and the nature of commercialism&quot;. These review collections, Shuker continues, &quot;became bibles in the field, establishing orthodoxies as to the relative value of various styles or genres and pantheons of artists. Record collectors and enthusiasts, and specialisation and secondhand record shops, inevitably have well-thumbed copies of these and similar volumes close at hand.&quot;

In the realm of rock music, as in that of classical music, critics have not always been respected by their subjects. Frank Zappa declared that &quot;Most rock journalism is people who can&#x27;t write, interviewing people who can&#x27;t talk, for people who can&#x27;t read.&quot; In the Guns N&#x27; Roses song &quot;Get in the Ring&quot;, Axl Rose verbally attacked critics who gave the band negative reviews because of their actions on stage; such critics as Andy Secher, Mick Wall and Bob Guccione Jr. were mentioned by name.

=== Conservative Christian criticisms of rock music ===
Rock music received a considerable amount of criticism from conservative Christian communities within the United States. This criticism was strongest throughout the 1960s and 70s, with some of the most prominent Christian critics being David A. Noebel, Bob Larson, and Frank Garlock. While these men were not professional music critics, they often claimed to be qualified rock critics because of their professional experiences with both music and religion. For example, Larson tried to assert his authority as a rock critic by stating: &quot;As a minister, I know now what it is like to feel the unction of the Holy Spirit. As a rock musician, I knew what it meant to feel the counterfeit anointing of Satan&quot;.

Christian criticisms of rock music in the mid 20th century often centered around arguments that rock was both sonically and morally bad and physically harmful to both the body and soul. Using these central arguments, Noebel, Larson, Garlock, and other Christian critics of rock music wrote extensively about the differences between &#x27;good&#x27; and &#x27;bad&#x27; music. In &quot;The Beatles: A Study in Drugs, Sex and Revolution&quot;, Noebel explained why rock music was &#x27;bad&#x27; by contrasting it with qualities of &#x27;good&#x27; music. In &quot;The Big Beat: A Rock Blast&quot;, similar arguments were posed by Garlock, with the additional argument that &#x27;good&#x27; music must come from distinguished and educated musicians. Additionally, Larson argued that the beats used in rock music could cause rebellion in younger generations due to their hypnotic and influential nature.

Drawing from styles like rhythm and blues and jazz music, rock and roll was first innovated by black communities, but was soon appropriated by white populations. This aspect of rock&#x27;s history has been overlooked by historians and the media, but music experts now widely agree that rock&#x27;s true origins lie in the American south among black populations.

Early conservative Christian criticisms of rock music had strong footings in racism. Most white conservative Christians in the mid 20th century understood that rock started among black populations and feared what the success of the genre implied for the church, segregation, and racial equality. When critiquing rock music, Christian critics commonly portrayed rock music with &quot;primitive and exotic imagery to convey [its] African-roots&quot;. For example, The American Tract Society in New Jersey released a booklet called &quot;Jungle to Jukebox&quot; that used racist, exotic tropes to illustrate the dangers of rock music to white youth.

===Critical trends of the 21st century===

====2000s====
In the 2000s, online music bloggers began to supplement, and to some degree displace, music journalists in print media. In 2006, Martin Edlund of the &quot;New York Sun&quot; criticized the trend, arguing that while the &quot;Internet has democratized music criticism, it seems it&#x27;s also spread its penchant for uncritical hype&quot;.

Carl Wilson described &quot;an upsurge in pro-pop sentiment among critics&quot; during the early 2000s, writing that a &quot;new generation [of music critics] moved into positions of critical influence&quot; and then &quot;mounted a wholesale critique against the syndrome of measuring all popular music by the norms of rock culture&quot;.

&quot;Slate&quot; magazine writer Jody Rosen discussed the 2000s-era trends in pop music criticism in his article &quot;The Perils of Poptimism&quot;. Rosen noted that much of the debate is centered on a perception that rock critics regard rock as &quot;normative ... the standard state of popular music ... to which everything else is compared&quot;. At a 2006 pop critic conference, attendees discussed their &quot;guilty pop pleasures, reconsidering musicians (Tiny Tim, Dan Fogelberg, Phil Collins) and genres &quot; which rock critics have long dismissed as lightweight, commercial music. Rosen stated that &quot;this new critical paradigm&quot; is called &quot;popism&quot; – or, more evocatively (and goofily), &quot;poptimism&quot;. The poptimism approach states: &quot;Pop (and, especially, hip-hop) producers are as important as rock auteurs, Beyoncé is as worthy of serious consideration as Bruce Springsteen, and ascribing shame to pop pleasure is itself a shameful act.&quot;
In 2008, Ann Powers of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; argued that pop music critics &quot;have always been contrarians&quot;, because &quot;pop music [criticism] rose up as a challenge to taste hierarchies, and has remained a pugilistic, exhibitionist business throughout pop&#x27;s own evolution&quot;. Powers claimed that &quot;[i]nsults, rejections of others&#x27; authority, bratty assertions of superior knowledge and even threats of physical violence are the stuff of which pop criticism is made&quot;, while at the same time, the &quot;best [pop criticism] also offers loving appreciation and profound insights about how music creates and collides with our everyday realities&quot;. She stated that pop criticism developed as a &quot;slap at the establishment, at publications such as the hippie homestead &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and the rawker outpost &quot;Creem&quot;&quot;, adding that the &quot;1980s generation&quot; of post-punk indie rockers had in the mid-2000s &quot;been taken down by younger &#x27;poptimists,&#x27; who argue that lovers of underground rock are elitists for not embracing the more multicultural mainstream&quot;. Powers likened the poptimist critics&#x27; debates about bands and styles to a &quot;scrum in rugby&quot;, in that &quot;[e]verybody pushes against everybody else, and we move forward in a huge blob of vehement opinion and mutual judgment&quot;.

====2010s====
Music critic and indie pop musician Scott Miller, in his 2010 book &quot;&quot;, suggested, &quot;Part of the problem is that a lot of vital pop music is made by 22-year-olds who enjoy shock value, and it&#x27;s pathetic when their elders are cornered into unalloyed reverence&quot;. Miller suggested that critics could navigate this problem by being prepared &quot;to give young artists credit for terrific music without being intimidated into a frame of mind where dark subject matter always gets a passing grade&quot;, stating that a critic should be able to call a young artist &quot;a musical genius&quot; while &quot;in the same breath declaring that his or her lyrics are morally objectionable.&quot; Reacting to the state of pop music criticism, Miller identified a major issue as critics&#x27; failure to &quot;credit an artist with getting a feeling across&quot;, specifically pointing out critic Lester Bangs as &quot;a ball of emotion at all times&quot;, who nonetheless &quot;never really related to his favorite artists as people who develop a skill of conveying feelings. You don&#x27;t feel that he comfortably acknowledged being moved as a result of their honest work. Artists in his writing were vaguely ridiculous, fascinating primitives, embodying an archetype by accident of nature.&quot;

&quot;Jezebel&quot;″s Tracy Moore, in 2014, suggested that one of the virtues of writing about how music made one feel, in contrast with linking it to the sounds of other artists, was to avoid excluding readers who may not have musical knowledge as broad as that of the writer. In contrast, Miller believed that analytical readers would appreciate &quot;more music talk in music criticism&quot;, suggesting that &quot;sensitively modest doses&quot; of musical analysis would provide helpful support for a conclusion &quot;that great melody writing occurred or it didn&#x27;t&quot;. For example, Miller noted that critics rarely &quot;identify catchy melodies as specific passages within a song&quot;, in the way that working musicians might discuss &quot;the A-minor in the second measure of the chorus&quot;.

Stevie Chick, a writer who teaches music journalism at City University London, said, &quot;I think more than any other journalism, music journalism has got a really powerful creative writing quotient to it.&quot;

Tris McCall of the &quot;Newark Star-Ledger&quot; discussed his approach to music criticism in a 2010 interview, stating, &quot;Most of us [critics] begin writing about music because we love it so much. We can&#x27;t wait to tell our friends and neighbors about what we&#x27;re hearing.&quot; According to McCall, even over the course of a long professional career, the enthusiastic impulse to share &quot;never fades&quot;. McCall expressed his interest in &quot;examining why people respond to what they respond to. I hazard guesses. Sometimes I&#x27;m wrong, but I hope I&#x27;m always provocative.&quot;

In the 2010s, some commentators noted and criticized the lack of negative reviews in music journalism. Saul Austerlitz from the &quot;New York Times Magazine&quot; noted that unlike other art forms, &quot;music is now effectively free. Music criticism&#x27;s former priority — telling consumers what to purchase — has been rendered null and void for most fans.&quot; He argued that this and &quot;click culture&quot; causes music critics to act as &quot;cheerleaders&quot; for existing stars.

The 2010s saw a rise of music critics who used YouTube and social media as their platform. According to &quot;Vice&quot; magazine&#x27;s Larry Fitzmaurice in 2016, Twitter (X) is &quot;perhaps the last public space for unfettered music criticism in an increasingly anti-critical landscape&quot;. In 2020, &quot;The New York Times&quot; described YouTuber Anthony Fantano as &quot;probably the most popular music critic left standing.&quot; Fantano&#x27;s channel, The Needle Drop, is his main outlet, but he also streams music commentary on Twitch and posts on X.

==== 2020s ====
In an article published in 2024, Jessica Karl, a Bloomberg News columnist, opined that &quot;the way we critique music is broken&quot;. She argues that the current culture of consuming new music, particularly with the release of Taylor Swift&#x27;s album &quot;The Tortured Poets Department&quot; (2024), is unhealthy. While she found some of the reviews of the album were &quot;well-considered&quot;, she opined others were pre-written and &quot;daft&quot;. She explained that critics are &quot;staying up until dawn to finish listening to an album as if it&#x27;s a college paper we&#x27;re cramming to complete by the morning&quot; and long albums like the 31-track &quot;Tortured Poets&quot; frustrate them. Karl also felt that reviews appearing online within hours of an album&#x27;s release discredits both the plaudits and criticism. She condemned the &quot;Paste&quot; review for making &quot;a litany of petty, exclamation-pointed digs&quot; at Swift, and dismissed the rave &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; review for calling the album a classic within a day, as well as criticizing articles by &quot;reputable publications&quot; like &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; for catering gossip to the masses and fandom instead of serious journalism of the art.

===Gender and race theory===
Applying critical theory (&quot;e.g.&quot;, critical gender studies and critical race theory) to music journalism, some academic writers suggest that mutual disrespect between critics and artists is one of many negative effects of rockism. In 2004, critic Kelefa Sanneh defined &quot;rockism&quot; as &quot;idolizing the authentic old legend (or underground hero) while mocking the latest pop star&quot;. Music journalism &quot;infected&quot; with rockism has become, according to Yale professor Daphne Brooks, a challenge &quot;for those of us concerned with historical memory and popular music performance&quot;.

Simon Frith said that pop and rock music &quot;are closely associated with gender; that is, with conventions of male and female behaviour&quot;. According to Holly Kruse, both popular music articles and academic articles about pop music are usually written from &quot;masculine subject positions&quot;. Kembrew McLeod analyzed terms used by critics to differentiate between pop music and rock, finding a gendered dichotomy in descriptions of &quot;&#x27;serious,&#x27; &#x27;raw,&#x27; and &#x27;sincere&#x27; rock music as distinguished from &#x27;trivial&#x27;, &#x27;fluffy,&#x27; and &#x27;formulaic&#x27; pop music&quot;. McLeod found that a likely cause of this dichotomy was the lack of women writing in music journalism: &quot;By 1999, the number of female editors or senior writers at &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; hovered around a whopping 15%, [while] at &quot;Spin&quot; and &quot;Raygun&quot;, [it was] roughly 20%.&quot; Criticism associated with gender was graphically discussed in a 2014 &quot;Jezebel&quot; article about the struggles of women in music journalism, written by music critic Tracy Moore, previously an editor at the &quot;Nashville Scene&quot;. Moore described how another female music blogger, an &quot;admitted outsider&quot; who threatened no stereotypes, was greeted with enthusiasm by men, in contrast with Moore&#x27;s own experiences as a self-described &quot;insider&quot; who was nevertheless expected to &quot;prove&quot; or &quot;earn&quot; her way into a male-dominated journalism scene.

According to Anwen Crawford, music critic for Australia&#x27;s &quot;The Monthly&quot;, the &quot;problem for women [popular music critics] is that our role in popular music was codified long ago&quot;; as a result, &quot;most famous rock-music critics – Robert Christgau, Greil Marcus, Lester Bangs, Nick Kent – are all male&quot;. Crawford points to &quot;[t]he record store, the guitar shop, and now social media: when it comes to popular music, these places become stages for the display of male prowess&quot;, and adds, &quot;Female expertise, when it appears, is repeatedly dismissed as fraudulent. Every woman who has ever ventured an opinion on popular music could give you some variation [of this experience] ...and becoming a recognized &#x27;expert&#x27; (a musician, a critic) will not save [women] from accusations of fakery.&quot;

Daphne Brooks, in her 2008 article &quot;The Write to Rock: Racial Mythologies, Feminist Theory, and the Pleasures of Rock Music Criticism&quot;, wrote that in order to restructure music criticism, one must &quot;focus on multiple &quot;counter&quot;narratives&quot; to break away from racial and gender biases as embodied in &quot;contemporary cultural fetishizations of white male performative virtuosity and latent black male innovations&quot;. Brooks focused on &quot;the ways that rock music criticism has shaped and continues to shape our understandings of racialized music encounters, and what are the alternative stories that we might tell&quot;. Brooks pointed to Christgau&#x27;s statement that, after the Beatles&#x27; arrival in America, &quot;rock criticism embraced a dream or metaphor of perpetual revolution. Worthwhile bands were supposed to change people&#x27;s lives, preferably for the better. If they failed to do so, that meant they didn&#x27;t matter.&quot; Unsurprisingly, according to Brooks, &quot;the history of women who&#x27;ve been sustaining a tradition of writing about rock since the 60&#x27;s&quot; has been &quot;largely hidden in American culture&quot;.

Brooks theorized that perceptions of female artists of color might be different if there were more women of color writing about them, and praised Ellen Willis as a significant feminist critic of rock&#x27;s classic era. Willis, who was a columnist for the &quot;New Yorker&quot; from 1968 to 1975, believed society could be enlightened by the &quot;ecstatic experience&quot; of visions expressed through music&#x27;s rhythm and noise and that such joy would lead people to different ways of sharing. Brooks wrote that &quot;the confluence of cultural studies, rock studies, and third wave feminist critical studies makes it possible now more than ever to continue to critique and reinterrogate the form and content of popular music histories&quot;. In Brooks&#x27; view, &quot;By bravely breaking open dense equations of gender, class, power, and subcultural music scenes&quot;, music journalists, activists and critics such as Ellen Willis have been &quot;able to brilliantly, like no one before [them], challenge the intellectual and political activism and agency&quot; of the entire music industry.

<text>Erich Leinsdorf (born Erich Landauer; February 4, 1912 – September 11, 1993) was an Austrian-born American conductor. He performed and recorded with leading orchestras and opera companies throughout the United States and Europe, earning a reputation for exacting standards as well as an acerbic personality. He also published books and essays on musical matters.

==Biography==
Leinsdorf was born to a Jewish family in Vienna, and was studying music at a local school by the age of 5. He played the cello and studied composition. In his teens, Leinsdorf worked as a piano accompanist for singers. He studied conducting at the Mozarteum in Salzburg, and later at the University of Vienna and the Vienna Academy of Music. From 1934 to 1937 he worked as an assistant to the noted conductors Bruno Walter and Arturo Toscanini at the Salzburg Festival.

In November 1937, Leinsdorf travelled to the United States to take up a position as assistant conductor at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City. As it turned out, his departure from Austria came a few short months ahead of the Anschluss of March 1938, when the country was taken over by Nazi Germany. With the assistance of freshman Representative from Texas Lyndon B. Johnson, he was able to stay in the United States, and became a naturalized American citizen in 1942.

While at the Met, Leinsdorf was particularly noted for his Wagner performances; after the sudden death of Artur Bodanzky in 1939, he was named the Met&#x27;s &quot;head of German repertoire&quot;. By the spring of 1943, the candidates being considered to take over for Artur Rodzinski as music director of The Cleveland Orchestra included Vladimir Golschmann of the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra, Albert Stoessel of the Juilliard School and New York Oratorio Society, George Szell of the Metropolitan Opera Company, and Leinsdorf, also of the Met.

Given Leinsdorf&#x27;s tender age (31) and limited experience conducting performances outside of opera, questions arose about his capacity for the job. However, Leinsdorf won a vote taken by the Orchestra&#x27;s board of directors and became the ensemble&#x27;s third music director, in 1943. Among the most significant developments during Leinsdorf&#x27;s first year in Cleveland was his intention to schedule the entire season in advance so the Orchestra could promote its concerts ahead of time and reach a wider audience; his desire to have the Orchestra play a year-round schedule — though World War II complicated that possibility; and, finally, the successful negotiation of a weekly radio broadcast on Sunday evenings — allowing The Cleveland Orchestra to be heard throughout the United States, parts of Mexico, and by short wave across Europe, South America, and the South Pacific. More importantly, perhaps, given U.S. involvement in the war, concerts would be recorded and broadcast to overseas American military zones.

Unfortunately, Leinsdorf&#x27;s tenure as music director was short-lived. In October 1943, he received a letter informing him that his potential draft status had changed — though he remained doubtful he would be called to serve because of a host of health problems. Later in the month, however, he received his draft notice, remarking to the press: &quot;I intend to abide by the orders of my government.&quot; Leinsdorf&#x27;s impending departure left the Musical Arts Association with a major problem: The Cleveland Orchestra needed a new music director.

Although Leinsdorf&#x27;s time in the Army was brief — he was honorably discharged in September 1944 — the Orchestra already had its sights set on his replacement. In November 1944, George Szell, who had been at the Met with Leinsdorf, made his Severance Hall debut to rave reviews. Leinsdorf was still under contract, but he had lost much of his power as music director — compromising on a number of issues, from performance content to recording authority. He returned to the podium at Severance Hall for the last program of the season. As public opinion shifted toward Szell, Leinsdorf submitted his resignation. But after Szell&#x27;s death, in 1970, Leinsdorf returned regularly to lead The Cleveland Orchestra as a guest conductor through the 1980s.

Leinsdorf was the principal conductor of the Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra from 1947 to 1955. He came to despair of what he saw as Rochester&#x27;s insular musical culture, famously remarking that &quot;Rochester is the best disguised dead end in the world!&quot; Subsequently, he was briefly head of the New York City Opera, before resuming his association with the Met. In 1962 he was named music director of the Boston Symphony Orchestra. His time in Boston produced many recordings for RCA, but was also marked by controversy, as he occasionally clashed with musicians and administrators.

On November 22, 1963, during a Boston Symphony concert, Leinsdorf had to announce the reports of President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s assassination in Dallas, Texas, to a shocked audience. He and the orchestra followed the news with a performance of the &quot;Funeral March&quot; from Beethoven&#x27;s third symphony. 
In 1969 Leinsdorf left the Boston post. He continued to guest-conduct operas and orchestras around the world for the next two decades, being particularly associated with the Metropolitan Opera and the New York Philharmonic. He also served from 1978 to 1980 as principal conductor of the (West) Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra. He died of cancer in Zürich, Switzerland, at the age of 81.
Leinsdorf is also known for his arrangements of orchestral concert suites of music from major operas. They include: Claude Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot;, Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Parsifal&quot;, and Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Die Frau ohne Schatten&quot;.

==Recordings==
Leinsdorf recorded throughout his career, including some 78-rpm discs for RCA Victor and for Columbia Records with the Cleveland Orchestra. In the early 1950s, Leinsdorf recorded all of the Mozart symphonies for Westminster with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, and started a highly regarded series of recordings with the Rochester Philharmonic for Columbia with a Beethoven &quot;Eroica&quot; that rivaled that of Toscanini in intensity. Leinsdorf made a number of stereo recordings with the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the Philharmonia Orchestra, and a Los Angeles pick-up orchestra called The Concert Arts Orchestra for Capitol Records in the 1960s. He also recorded the Brahms First Symphony, the Franck Symphony in D Minor, and the Mendelssohn First and Grieg piano concertos for RCA Victor with Ania Dorfmann and the Philadelphia Orchestra, called the Robin Hood Dell Orchestra on disc. Beginning 1957, Leinsdorf was conductor for a series of complete stereophonic opera recordings made in Rome, commencing with Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Tosca&quot; with Zinka Milanov, Jussi Björling, and Leonard Warren for RCA Victor. He continued to record for RCA Victor as music director of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, with notable releases of Mahler, Bartok, the complete Beethoven and Brahms symphonies, and a live Mozart Requiem in memory of President John F. Kennedy. Later he again made additional operatic recordings, including the first complete stereo recording of Erich Wolfgang Korngold&#x27;s Die Tote Stadt, with Carol Neblett and René Kollo for RCA. Leinsdorf conducted the Boston Symphony with pianist Artur Rubinstein in the pianist&#x27;s second complete recordings of Beethoven&#x27;s piano concertos, Brahms&#x27; First Piano Concerto, and Tchaikovsky&#x27;s First Piano Concerto. He also recorded a complete &quot;Lohengrin&quot; with the Boston Symphony, a massive and expensive project, which at the time was the first Wagner opera recorded with a major US orchestra. It was announced at the beginning of Leinsdorf&#x27;s appointment with the Boston Symphony that he and the orchestra would record all the major works of Prokofieff, but by the end of his tenure only symphonies 2, 3, 5, and 6, the violin concertos, the five piano concertos, music from &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, the &quot;Scythian Suite&quot; and the Symphony-Concerto for Cello had been recorded and issued. Many of his RCA Victor recordings were considered flawed by the company&#x27;s controversial Dynagroove process. For Decca/London Leinsdorf recorded many Mozart operas, including &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, &quot;Cosi fan tutte&quot;, and the &quot;Marriage of Figaro&quot; as well as a highly regarded recording of Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Die Walküre&quot;. After leaving Boston in the 1970s, Leinsdorf returned to Decca/London to record several releases in their acclaimed Phase 4 Stereo project, notably Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Rite of Spring&quot; and &quot;Petrouchka&quot;. For Sheffield Labs, Leinsdorf recorded three direct-to-disc recordings with the Los Angeles Philharmonic in the 1980s.

Leinsdorf received seven Grammy Awards during his career:

* 1961 – Best Opera Recording (for &quot;Turandot)&quot;
* 1964 – Best Opera Recording (for &quot;Madama butterfly&quot;)
* 1964 – Best Orchestral Performance (for &quot;Bartók: Concerto for Orchestra)&quot;
* 1965 – Best Orchestral Performance (for &quot;Mahler: Symphony No. 5 / Berg: Excerpts from Wozzeck)&quot;
* 1967 – Best Orchestral Performance (for &quot;Mahler: Symphony No. 6)&quot;
* 1969 – Best Opera Recording (for &quot;Così fan tutte&quot;)
* 1972 – Best Opera Recording (for &quot;Aida&quot;)

He also received a total of 12 Grammy nominations during his lifetime.

===DVD===
On video Leinsdorf conducts the Vienna Symphony in &quot;Johann Strauß: Famous Works&quot;. Available on Silverline Classics in Dolby Digital, 2003. A number of Leinsdorf&#x27;s televised performances with The Boston Symphony Orchestra have been released on DVD by VAI and ICA Classics; most notably on ICA Classics, a performance of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s 5th Symphony taped in color from April 1969. This has received several critical accolades.

==Television==
Leinsdorf with the BSO appeared regularly on local broadcasts from WGBH-TV and nationally on PBS in the Evening at Symphony broadcasts. On August 17, 1967, Leinsdorf conducted the Boston Symphony Orchestra in a two-hour primetime special telecast in color on NBC, a reflection of the days when a commercial network would periodically broadcast a full-length classical concert. The program, entitled &quot;An Evening at Tanglewood&quot;, featured violinist Itzhak Perlman as guest soloist.

<doc id="317952" wikidata="Q1761567" url="?curid=317952" title="Mercury switch">
<text>A mercury switch is an electrical switch that opens and closes a circuit when a small amount of the liquid metal mercury connects metal electrodes to close the circuit. There are several different basic designs (tilt, displacement, radial, etc.) but they all share the common design strength of non-eroding switch contacts.

The most common is the &quot;mercury tilt switch&quot;. It is in one state (open or closed) when tilted one direction with respect to horizontal, and the other state when tilted the other direction. This is what older style thermostats used to turn a heater or air conditioner on or off.

The &quot;mercury displacement switch&quot; uses a &#x27;plunger&#x27; that dips into a pool of mercury, raising the level in the container to contact at least one electrode. This design is used in relays in industrial applications that need to switch high current loads frequently. These relays use electromagnetic coils to pull steel sleeves inside hermetically sealed containers.

==History==
From around 1905 to 1910 various mercury switches were invented, but the &quot;mercury in glass envelope&quot; switch got its start with patent 1598874 (filed on January 19, 1922 by Louis Phelan), which evolved into a more modern mercury switch with a straight tubular glass envelope via patent 2232626 (filed on October 7, 1937 by Harold Olson of Honeywell).

==Description==
Mercury switches have one or more sets of electrical contacts in a sealed glass envelope that contains a small quantity of mercury. The envelope may also contain hydrogen at pressure, an inert gas, or a vacuum. Gravity constantly pulls the drop of mercury to the lowest point in the envelope. When the switch is tilted in the appropriate direction, the mercury touches a set of contacts, thus completing an electrical circuit. Tilting the switch in the opposite direction moves the mercury away from that set of contacts, breaking that circuit. The switch may contain multiple sets of contacts, closing different sets at different angles, allowing, for example, single-pole, double-throw (&quot;SPDT&quot;) operation.

==Advantages==
Mercury switches offer several advantages over other switch types:
* The contacts are enclosed, so oxidation of the contact points is impossible. 
* In hazardous locations, interrupting the circuit does not emit a spark that could ignite flammable gases. 
* Contacts stay clean, and even if an internal arc occurs, the contact surfaces renew on every operation, so they don&#x27;t wear out. 
* Even a small drop of mercury has low resistance, so switches can carry useful amounts of current in a small size. 
* Sensitivity of the drop to gravity provides a unique sensing function, and lends itself to simple, low-force mechanisms for manual or automatic operation. 
* The switches are quiet, as no contacts abruptly snap together. 
* The mass of the moving mercury drop provides an over center effect to avoid chattering as the switch tilts. 
* The envelope can include contacts for two or more circuits.

==Disadvantages==
Mercury switches have several disadvantages:
* There is a tendency for the intermittently exposed electrode to become damaged by the intense heat and destructive force of the electrical arc that forms whenever the circuit opens or closes, particularly if the circuit is being opened under a large inductive load. Certain refractory materials have been used to encase this electrode to mitigate this effect.
* Their relatively slow operating rate (due to the inertia of the mercury drop) makes them unsuitable for applications that require many operating cycles per second. 
* Glass envelopes and wire electrodes may be fragile and require flexible leads to prevent damage to the envelope. 
* The mercury drop forms a common electrode, so circuits are not isolated from each other in a multi-pole switch.
* Their sensitivity to gravity may make them unsuitable in portable or mobile devices that can change orientation or vibrate. 
* Mercury compounds are highly toxic and accumulate in any food chain, so safety codes exclude mercury in many new designs.

==Uses==
===Roll sensing===
Tilt switches provide a rollover or tip over warning for applications like construction equipment and lift vehicles that operate in rugged terrain. There are several non-mercury types, but few are implemented due to sensitivity to shock and vibration, causing false tripping. However, devices resistant to shock and vibration do exist.

=== Automotive uses ===
Automobile manufacturers once used mercury switches for lighting controls (for example, trunk lid lights), ride control, and anti-lock braking systems. Scrapped automobiles can leak mercury to the environment if these switches are not properly removed. Since 2003, new American-built cars no longer use mercury switches.

===Electrification of church bells===

In the 1950s, Austrian bellfounder from Vienna, Josef Pfundner jr., decided to develop a new way to electrify church bells. Some Austria church bells were already motorised using motors from a German factory in Herford, which used motors with brakes and gearbox to change direction of rotation and maintain optimal swing angle and change swing direction of bell. This option was expensive so Pfundner decided to try a motor with brake and mercury switch. This was cheaper, but much more sensitive. If the switch was incorrectly installed on the yoke or broken, the bell could be fatally cracked. This type of &quot;gearbox&quot; on yoke contained four mercury switches, specifically, two switches for each direction, which were wired to the motor, in such a way as to change swinging direction while the bell was ringing. Swing angle could be adjusted by moving the switches, though putting them in the wrong place. 

Since Pfundner closed the bellfoundry in 1971, the bellfoundry Grassmayr from Innsbruck in Tyrol had bought a licence for using this patented method and they continued to use it for their own bell electrification until early 2000s. Some electrificators in Croatia also adopted this system, e.g. Alojz Domislovic his successor Luka Ivandija, and later Ivan Bosilj. Ivan Bosilj stopped with usage of mercury switches in 2000. In Vojvodina in Serbia the same system was used by electrificator Mihaly Rozsa, but when he retired, his systems weren&#x27;t maintained until end of 2019 and early 2020s. Now one electrician from Bečej maintains his work and does electrification with mercury switches and motors with brakes by himself.

===Fall alarms===
Work performed in confined space (such as a welder inside a tank) raises special safety concerns. Tilt switches sound an alarm if a worker falls over.

===Aircraft attitude indicators/artificial horizons===
Electrically driven attitude indicators typically use mercury switches to keep the gyro axis vertical. When the gyro is off vertical, mercury switches trigger torque motors that move the gyro position back to the correct position. (Air driven attitude indicators use a different operating principle.)

===Thermostats===
Mercury switches were once common in bimetal thermostats. The weight of the movable mercury drop provided some hysteresis by a degree of over-center action. The bimetal spring had to move further to overcome the weight of the mercury, tending to hold it in the open or closed position. The mercury also provided positive on-off switching, and could withstand millions of cycles without contact degradation.

=== Doorbells ===
Some old doorbells, for example, the Soviet ZM-1U4, use mercury switches as current interrupters.

===Pressure switches===
Some pressure switches use a Bourdon tube and a mercury switch. The small force generated by the tube reliably operates the switch.

===Vending and game machines===
Mercury switches are still used in electro-mechanical systems where physical orientation of actuators or rotors is a factor. They are also commonly used in vending machines and pinball tables, and used to be common in slot machines, for &quot;tilt alarms&quot; that detect when someone tries to rock or tilt the machine to make it vend a product or affect a play outcome.

===Bombs===

A tilt switch can trigger a bomb. Mercury tilt switches can be found in some bomb and landmine fuzes, typically in the form of anti-handling devices, for example, a variant of the VS-50 mine.

==Toxicity==
Since mercury is a toxic heavy metal, devices containing mercury switches must be treated as hazardous waste for disposal. Because it is now RoHS restricted, most modern applications have eliminated it. A metal ball and contact wires can directly replace it, but may require additional circuitry to eliminate switch bounce. Low-precision thermostats use a bimetal strip and a switch contact. Precision thermostats use a thermistor or silicon temperature sensor. Low-cost accelerometers replace the mercury tilt switch in precision applications.

In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulates the disposition and release of mercury. Individual states and localities may enact further regulations on the use or disposition of mercury.

<text>The Enoshima Engi (江嶋縁起) is a history of the temples and shrines on Enoshima Island in Sagami Bay. It was written in Chinese, the scholarly language of the time, by the Japanese Buddhist monk Kōkei in 1047 AD. 

The &quot;Enoshima Engi&quot; consists of two separate parts. The first tells the story of the tribulations of prehistoric villagers who lived in the vicinity of Enoshima. The villagers were plagued for a period of a thousand-some years by a destructive, five-headed dragon (Gozuryu:) that had its lair in a nearby lake. Aware of their suffering, on May 31, 552 AD, the Goddess Benzaiten caused the island of Enoshima to arise from the bottom of the bay to serve as her abode. She then descended onto the island amidst a series of spectacular terrestrial and aerial phenomena. The dragon fell in love with the beautiful goddess and asked her to be his consort. Benzaiten, who was widely known for her persuasive eloquence, rejected the dragon&#x27;s proposal and made it understand that it had been doing wrong by plaguing the villagers. Ashamed, the dragon promised to cease its wrongdoing. It then faced south (devotedly facing the island where Benzaiten lived) and changed into a hill. To this day, the hill is known as Dragon&#x27;s-Mouth Hill (Japanese: tatsu-no-kuchi yama 龍の口山). 

Although this story seems fantastic on the surface, it very likely contains many factual elements. The dragon, for example, is probably a metaphor for the water of a violent local river that is still notorious for its floods. Its five heads were probably four of the river&#x27;s tributaries plus the mouth of the river. The descent of the goddess may have been inspired by aerial phenomena such as the passage of a large meteor. 

The second part of the &quot;Enoshima Engi&quot; relates visits to Enoshima by eminent monks. Among the visitors was Jikaku Daishi (慈覺大師), the posthumous name of Ennin (圓仁, 792-862 AD), the third chief priest of Enryaku-ji (延暦寺), the center of Buddhism in Japan.

<text>A miniature snap-action switch, also trademarked and frequently known as a micro switch or microswitch, is an electric switch that is actuated by very little physical force, through the use of a tipping-point mechanism, sometimes called an &quot;over-center&quot; mechanism.

The defining feature of micro switches is that a relatively small movement at the actuator button produces a relatively large movement at the electrical contacts, which occurs at high speed (regardless of the speed of actuation). Switching happens reliably at specific and repeatable positions of the actuator, which is not necessarily true of other mechanisms. Most successful designs also exhibit hysteresis, meaning that a small reversal of the actuator is insufficient to reverse the contacts; there must be a significant movement in the opposite direction. Both of these characteristics help to achieve a clean and reliable interruption to the switched circuit.

They are very common due to their low cost but high durability, greater than 1 million cycles, and up to 10 million cycles for heavy-duty models. This durability is a natural consequence of the design.

== History ==

The first micro switch was invented by Phillip Kenneth McGall in 1932 in Freeport, Illinois, under patent US1,960,020. McGall was an employee of the Burgess Battery Company at the time. In 1937 W.B. Schulte, McGall&#x27;s employer, started the company MICRO SWITCH. The company and the &quot;Micro Switch&quot; trademark have been owned by Honeywell Sensing and Control since 1950. The name has become a generic trademark for any snap-action switch. Companies other than Honeywell now manufacture miniature snap-action switches.

== Construction and operation ==
In one type of microswitch, internally there are two conductive springs. A long flat spring is hinged at one end of the switch (the left, in the photograph) and has electrical contacts on the other. A small curved spring, preloaded (i.e., compressed during assembly) so it attempts to extend itself (at the top, just right of center in the photo), is connected between the flat spring near the contacts and a fulcrum near the midpoint of the flat spring. An actuator nub presses on the flat spring near its hinge point.

Because the flat spring is anchored and strong in tension the curved spring cannot move it to the right. The curved spring presses, or pulls, the flat spring upward, that is away, from the anchor point. Owing to the geometry, the upward force is proportional to the displacement which decreases as the flat spring moves downward. (Actually, the force is proportional to the sine of the angle, which is approximately proportional to the angle for small angles.)

As the actuator depresses it flexes the flat spring while the curved spring keeps the electrical contacts touching. When the flat spring is flexed enough it will provide sufficient force to compress the curved spring and the contacts will begin to move.

As the flat spring moves downward the upward force of the curved spring reduces causing the motion to accelerate even in the absence of further movement of the actuator until the flat spring impacts the normally-open contact. Even though the flat spring unflexes as it moves downward, the switch is designed so the net effect is acceleration. This &quot;over-center&quot; action produces a very distinctive clicking sound and a very crisp feel.

In the actuated position the curved spring provides some upward force. If the actuator is released this will move the flat spring upward. As the flat spring moves, the force from the curved spring increases. This results in acceleration until the normally-closed contacts are hit. Just as in the downward direction, the switch is designed so that the curved spring is strong enough to move the contacts, even if the flat spring must flex, because the actuator does not move during the changeover.

== Applications ==

Microswitches have two main areas of application:

* Firstly, they are used when a low operating force with a clearly defined action is needed.
* Secondly, they are used when long-term reliability is needed. This is a result of the internal mechanism and the independence of the closing force on the switch contacts from the operating force. Switch reliability is largely a question of the contact force: a force that is reliably adequate, but never excessive, encourages long life.

Common applications of micro switches include the door interlock on a microwave oven, leveling and safety switches in elevators, vending machines, arcade buttons, and to detect paper jams or other faults in photocopiers. Microswitches are commonly used in tamper switches on gate valves on fire sprinkler systems and other water pipe systems, where it is necessary to know if a valve has been opened or shut.

Micro switches are very widely used; among their applications are appliances, machinery, industrial controls, vehicles, convertible tops, and many other places for control of electrical circuits. They are usually rated to carry current in control circuits only, although some switches can be directly used to control small motors, solenoids, lamps, or other devices. Special low-force versions can sense coins in vending machines, or with a vane attached, airflow. Microswitches may be directly operated by a mechanism, or maybe packaged as part of a pressure, flow, or temperature switch, operated by a sensing mechanism such as a Bourdon tube. In these latter applications, the repeatability of the actuator position when switching happens is essential for long-term accuracy. A motor-driven cam (usually relatively slow-speed) and one or more micro switches form a timer mechanism. The snap-switch mechanism can be enclosed in a metal housing including actuating levers, plungers, or rollers, forming a limit switch useful for control of machine tools or electrically-driven machinery.

<text>The reed switch is an electromechanical switch operated by an applied magnetic field. It was invented in 1922 by professor Valentin Kovalenkov at the Petrograd Electrotechnical University, and later evolved at Bell Telephone Laboratories in 1936 by Walter B. Ellwood into the reed relay. In its simplest and most common form, it consists of a pair of ferromagnetic flexible metal contacts in a hermetically sealed glass envelope. The contacts are usually normally open, closing when a magnetic field is present, or they may be normally closed and open when a magnetic field is applied. The switch may be actuated by an electromagnetic coil, making a reed relay, or by bringing a permanent magnet near it. When the magnetic field is removed, the contacts in the reed switch return to their original position. The &quot;reed&quot; is the metal part inside the reed switch envelope that is relatively thin and wide to make it flexible, resembling the reed of a musical instrument. The term &quot;reed&quot; may also include the external wire lead as well as the internal part.

A common example of a reed switch application is to detect the opening of a door or windows, for a security alarm.

==Description==

The most common type of reed switch contains a pair of magnetizable, flexible, metal reeds whose end portions are separated by a small gap when the switch is open. The reeds are hermetically sealed within a tubular glass envelope. Another type of reed switch contains one flexible reed that moves between a fixed normally-open contact and a fixed normally-closed contact. The normally-closed contact is non-ferromagnetic and is closed by the flexible reed&#x27;s spring force. Although reed switches with multiple poles are possible, more often an assembly of single-pole reed switches is used for multi-pole applications.

A magnetic field from an electromagnet or a permanent magnet will cause the reeds to attract each other, thus completing an electrical circuit. The spring force of the reeds causes them to separate, and open the circuit, when the magnetic field ceases. Another configuration contains a non-ferromagnetic normally-closed contact that opens when the ferromagnetic normally-open contact closes. A thin layer of non-ferromagnetic material is applied to the reed switch contact area to serve as an electrical contact switching (wear) surface and, for normally-open contacts, as a magnetic spacer whose thickness is important in controlling the magnetic field level at which the contact opens (the drop-out). Reed switch contacts are typically rhodium, ruthenium, iridium, or tungsten. There are also versions of reed switches with mercury-wetted contacts. Such switches must be mounted in a particular orientation, lest drops of mercury bridge the contacts even when not activated.

Since the contacts of the reed switch are sealed away from the atmosphere, they are protected against atmospheric corrosion. The hermetic sealing of a reed switch make them suitable for use in explosive atmospheres where tiny sparks from conventional switches would constitute a hazard.

One important quality of the switch is its sensitivity, the amount of magnetic field necessary to actuate it. Sensitivity is measured in units of ampere-turns (AT), corresponding to the current in a test coil multiplied by the number of turns in the test coil. Typical pull-in sensitivities for commercial devices are in the 10 to 60 AT range. The lower the AT, the more sensitive the reed switch. Smaller reed switches, which have smaller parts, are generally more sensitive to magnetic fields.

In production, a metal reed is inserted in each end of a glass tube and the ends of the tube are heated so that they seal around a shank portion on the reeds. Green-colored infrared-absorbing glass is frequently used, so an infrared heat source can concentrate the heat in the small sealing zone of the glass tube. The thermal coefficient of expansion of the glass material and metal parts must be similar to prevent breaking the glass-to-metal seal. The glass used must have a high electrical resistance and must not contain volatile components, such as lead oxide and fluorides, which can contaminate the contacts during the sealing operation. The leads of the switch must be handled carefully to prevent breaking the glass envelope. The glass envelope can be damaged if the reed switch is subjected to mechanical stress.

Most reed switches are filled with nitrogen at atmospheric pressure. After the final seal is made, the switch cools and the internal pressure is less than one atmosphere. Reed switches sealed with a pressurized nitrogen atmosphere have a higher breakdown voltage and are useful for switching 220–240 VAC mains power. Reed switches with a vacuum inside the glass envelope can switch thousands of volts.

Reed switches can be used to directly switch a variety of loads ranging from nanovolts to kilovolts, femtoamperes to amperes, and DC to radio frequency. Other magnetically-activated switching devices have a limited range of output voltages and currents, and generally do not directly control a final device such as a lamp, solenoid, or motor.

Reed switches have small leakage currents compared to solid state devices; this may be useful, for example, in medical devices requiring protection of a patient from tiny leakage currents. The reed is hermetically sealed and can therefore operate in almost any environment, such as where flammable gas is present or where corrosion would affect open switch contacts. A reed switch has very low resistance when closed, typically as low as 0.05 ohms, whereas the Hall effect sensors can be in the hundreds of ohms. A reed switch requires only two wires whereas most solid-state devices require three wires. A reed switch can be said to require zero power to operate it.

==Uses==
===Reed relays===

One or more reed switches inside an electromagnetic coil constitute a reed relay. Reed relays are used when operating currents are relatively low, and offer high operating speed, good performance with very small currents that are not reliably switched by conventional contacts, high reliability and long life. Millions of reed relays were used in telephone exchanges in the 1970s and 1980s. In particular, they were used for switching in the British TXE family of telephone exchanges. The inert atmosphere around the reed contacts ensures that oxidation will not affect the contact resistance. Mercury-wetted reed relays are sometimes used, especially in high-speed counting circuits.

===Magnetic sensors===
Reed switches actuated by magnets are commonly used in mechanical systems as proximity sensors. Examples are door and window sensors in burglar alarm systems and tamperproofing methods. Reed switches have been used in laptops to put the laptop into sleep/hibernation mode when the lid is closed. Speed sensors on bicycle wheels frequently use a reed switch to actuate briefly each time a magnet on the wheel passes the sensor.

At one time brushless DC electric motors used reed switches to sense the rotor&#x27;s position relative to the field poles. This allowed switching transistors to act as a commutator, but without the contact problems, wear and electrical noise of a traditional DC commutator. The motor design could also be &quot;inverted&quot;, placing permanent magnets onto the rotor and switching the field through the external, fixed coils. This avoided the need for any rubbing contact to provide power to the rotor. Such motors were used in low-power long-service-life items, such as computer cooling fans and disk drives. As cheap Hall effect sensors became available, they replaced the reed switches and gave even longer service lifetimes.

Reed switches are used in at least one brand of endoscopic capsule to switch on the power source only when the unit is removed from the sterile packaging.

Reed switches may be selected for a particular sensor application when a solid-state device does not meet requirements such as power consumption or electrical interface compatibility.

==== Keyboard switches ====

Reed switches were formerly used in the keyboards for computer terminals, where each key had a magnet and a reed switch actuated by depressing the key. Reed switches in keyboards have largely been superseded by Hall effect switches.

Electric and electronic pedal keyboards used by pipe organ and Hammond organ players often use reed switches, where the glass enclosure of the contacts protects them from dirt, dust, and other particles. They may also be used to control diving equipment, such as flashlights or cameras, which must be sealed to keep water out under high pressure.

== Life ==
The mechanical motion of the reeds is below the fatigue limit of the materials, so the reeds do not break due to fatigue. Wear and life are almost entirely dependent on the electrical load&#x27;s effect on the contacts along with the properties of the specific reed switch used. Contact surface wear occurs only when the switch contacts open or close. Because of this, manufacturers rate life in number of operations rather than hours or years. In general, higher voltages and higher currents cause faster wear and shorter life. Depending on the electrical load, life can be in the range of thousands of operations or billions of operations.

<text>The eMac (short for education Mac) is a discontinued all-in-one Mac desktop computer that was produced and designed by Apple Computer. Released in 2002, it was originally aimed at the education market but was later made available as a cheaper mass-market alternative to Apple&#x27;s &quot;Sunflower&quot; iMac G4. The eMac was pulled from retail on October 12, 2005, and was again sold exclusively to educational institutions thereafter. It was discontinued by Apple on July 5, 2006, and replaced by a cheaper, low-end Intel iMac that, like the eMac, was exclusively sold to educational institutions.

The eMac design closely resembles the Snow iMac G3, though the eMac was only available in white, slightly larger in size, did not include a carry handle, and was heavier than the preceding G3, weighing . The unique shape of the computer was also similar to Apple&#x27;s last CRT-based 17-inch Studio Display, released in 2000 (the last standalone CRT monitor Apple made). The Apple eMac features a PowerPC 7450 (G4e) processor that is significantly faster than the previous-generation PowerPC 750 (G3) processor, as well as a 17-inch flat CRT display which was less expensive and more rugged for the education market, making it a similar-performing alternative to the more premium iMac G4 with its LCD.

==Background==
In 1998, Apple released the iMac G3, an all-in-one computer built around a cathode-ray tube display. The iMac was a major success for Apple, selling more than five million units; it also sold for as low as US$799, making it the most affordable Mac model Apple offered. In January 2002, Apple announced a successor to the iMac G3, the iMac G4. This iMac was built around a floating flat-panel display, and started at a higher price than the previous generation. While a few models of the iMac G3 remained at lower price points, they lacked power for educational tasks like video. Education customers made up nearly a quarter of Apple&#x27;s sales, and with Windows-based computers eating into Apple&#x27;s market share of the sector, Apple consulted with educators to build a cheaper G4-powered successor for the price-conscious market.

Apple announced the eMac on April 29, 2002, to be sold only to education markets. Apple had previously created education-only computer models, including the iMac predecessor Power Macintosh G3 All-In-One. The machine&#x27;s CRT screen made it cheaper than the iMac G4 (the most expensive configuration was still cheaper than the cheapest iMac G4), and its bulk was intended to make it more resilient to wear and tear in a school setting than the fragile hinge and flat screen of the iMac.

==Design ==

The eMac has a substantially similar design to the iMac G3, but features a larger (16-inch viewable) flat-screen CRT monitor. The larger screen has 40percent more viewing area than the iMac. Thanks to the short-necked CRT, it takes up the same space as the iMac—in fact, it is a few millimeters shorter–but also is heavier, at . The computer is powered by a PowerPC G4 processor much faster than the G3-powered iMacs. The machine&#x27;s serial number and networking identification are printed on the front of the computer behind the optical drive door, intended to make it easier for schools to track purchases. RAM can be upgraded through a service hatch at the bottom of the computer. Apple sold a separate acrylic tilt-and-swivel stand to enable changing the viewing angle of the screen.

==Release==
After demand from consumers, Apple announced on June 4, 2002 that the eMac would be available through general retail. Regular consumers did not get the same prices and configuration options as education customers; for example, education buyers could get a model without a modem.

The eMac generally catered to the mass market, eventually taking over the entry-level (previously held by the iMac G3) Macintosh from 2003 to 2005, while the iMac G4 was positioned as a premium offering throughout the lifetime of the eMac line. The eMac generally offered similar performance and features to the iMac G4 while they were sold side by side. The eMac was gradually supplanted by the iMac G5 in 2005 to 2006.

In October 2003, 800 MHz model was eliminated as a standard configuration and the 1 GHz model was brought down in price. This revision was the last in the line to officially run Apple&#x27;s OS 9 operating system natively.

The next revision to the eMac line came in April 2004, with DDR SDRAM, a faster processor running at 1.25 GHz, and a better ATI Radeon 9200 video chipset. The most recent revision came in May 2005, with an even faster CPU running at 1.42 GHz, Radeon 9600 graphics, and larger standard hard disk.

On October 12, 2005, Apple once again restricted sales of the eMac to educational institutions and returned to its &quot;E is for Education&quot; marketing plan that had been attached to the product from the original restriction to education buyers. The company re-implemented this restrictive measure for unspecified reasons. Some analysts believe Apple wanted to force the general public to purchase the more expensive Mac Mini or iMac which had higher profit margins. Also, the eMac was the only CRT display product left in Apple&#x27;s lineup, which made it somewhat bulky compared to new offerings which had compact form factors due to their LCD screens. The falling cost of LCD displays would also gradually bring down the prices of the iMac G5. However, the eMac was still available for sale to the general public through some third-party retailer websites.

On July 5, 2006, the entire eMac line was discontinued. An &quot;educational configuration&quot; of the iMac Core Duo was introduced that same day, which had a Combo drive rather than a SuperDrive and a smaller 80 GB hard disk.

Early eMac models natively boot Mac OS 9.2.2 and Mac OS X beginning with OS X 10.1.4, while later models only officially boot Mac OS X. 1 GHz and faster models cannot boot OS 9, while eMacs slower than 1 GHz do not officially support 10.5 (requirements are an 867 MHz G4 with 512 MB RAM).

==Reception==
The eMac was generally well-received. &quot;Macworld&quot;″s Jason Snell wrote that the eMac served as a worthy successor to the iMac G3. Criticism of the initial release version was that the low amount of installed RAM (128 MB) was not sufficient for Mac OS X. The eMac was as easy to setup and had performance comparable to a similarly-equipped iMac G4, making the eMac the most affordable point of entry with a Power PC G4 processor and DVD-recording.

==Technical problems==
A number of early eMac machines have suffered from what was known as &quot;Raster Shift&quot;, a phenomenon where the bottom third or half of the screen goes black, with the rest of image shifting upward and beyond the top boundary of the display. Serious static also accompanies the problem, rendering the viewable part of the screen virtually useless. In response to the problem, Apple offered a solution which involved the replacement of the video cable inside the eMac&#x27;s case.
Certain models of eMac also suffered from capacitor plague, that caused video distortion or the computer to lock up. Apple responded to these issues by implementing a warranty extension program.

== Technical specifications ==
All are standard configurations from Apple unless otherwise noted.

<text>Thomas Pinckney (October 23, 1750November 2, 1828) was an American statesman, diplomat, and military officer who fought in both the American Revolutionary War and the War of 1812, achieving the rank of major general. He served as Governor of South Carolina and as the U.S. minister to Great Britain.

Born into a prominent family in Charles Town in the Province of South Carolina, Pinckney studied in Europe before returning to America. He supported the independence cause and worked as an aide to General Horatio Gates. After the Revolutionary War, Pinckney managed his plantation and won election as Governor of South Carolina, serving from 1787 to 1789. He presided over the state convention which ratified the United States Constitution. In 1792, he accepted President George Washington&#x27;s appointment to the position of minister to Britain, but was unable to win concessions regarding the impressment of American sailors. He also served as an envoy to Spain and negotiated the Treaty of San Lorenzo, which defined the border between Spain and the United States.

Following his diplomatic success in Spain, the Federalists chose Pinckney as John Adams&#x27;s running mate in the 1796 presidential election. Under the rules then in place, the individual who won the most electoral votes became president, while the individual who won the second most electoral votes became vice president. Although Adams won the presidential election, Democratic-Republican candidate Thomas Jefferson won the second most electoral votes and therefore, won election as vice president. After the election, Pinckney served in the United States House of Representatives from 1797 to 1801. His brother, Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, was the Federalist vice presidential nominee in 1800 and the party&#x27;s presidential nominee in 1804 and 1808. During the War of 1812, Pinckney was commissioned as a major general.

Pinckney was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1797.

==Early life and Revolutionary War years==

Pinckney was born on October 23, 1750, in Charlestown in the Province of South Carolina. His father, Charles Pinckney, was a prominent colonial official, while his mother, Eliza Lucas, was known for her introduction of indigo culture to the colony. Pinckney was the second of three siblings to survive to adulthood; his older sister, Harriott, later married a wealthy South Carolina planter, while his older brother, Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, became a prominent leader in South Carolina. When Pinckney was 3, his father took the family to Great Britain on colonial business, but the elder Pinckney died in 1758. His mother kept the family in Great Britain, and Pinckney studied at Westminster School, Christ Church, Oxford, and the Middle Temple. Pinckney was admitted to the bar in November 1774 and almost immediately left for South Carolina.

Though he had spent the majority of his life in England, Pinckney sympathized with the Patriot cause in the American Revolutionary War. Along with his brother, Charles, he became a captain in the Continental Army in June 1775. After seeing much action, he became an aide-de-camp to General Horatio Gates, and was captured by the British at the disastrous Battle of Camden in 1780. By that time he had married and had an infant child. He was allowed to recuperate from his wounds at his mother-in-law Rebecca Brewton Motte&#x27;s plantation outside Charleston. In 1781 he and his family traveled to Philadelphia, where he was released by the British in a prisoner exchange. Pinckney returned to the South and that year fought under the Marquis de Lafayette in Virginia.

==Governor and ambassador==

After the war, Pinckney focused on his plantations and his legal practice. In 1787, he ran for the position of Governor of South Carolina at the urging of his friend, Edward Rutledge. Pinckney was elected governor with little opposition. He strongly favored ratification of the United States Constitution and presided over the state convention that ratified the Constitution. He served in the South Carolina House of Representatives for St. Philip&#x27;s and St. Michael&#x27;s Parish from January 3 to December 20, 1791.

Pinckney initially declined appointment to a federal position, but in 1792 he agreed to serve as President George Washington&#x27;s ambassador to Britain. As Pinckney was unable to get the British to reach an agreement on various issues, including the practice of impressment or the evacuation of British forts in American territory, Washington dispatched John Jay as a special envoy to Britain. Pinckney helped Jay conclude the Jay Treaty, which addressed some issues between the U.S. and Britain but proved divisive in the United States. In 1795, while he continued to serve as the ambassador to Britain, Pinckney was sent to Spain to negotiate a treaty regarding boundaries and U.S. navigation on the Mississippi River. In the resulting Treaty of San Lorenzo, Spain agreed to allow Americans to export goods through the Mississippi River.

Upon his return to the United States, Pinckney joined with his mother-in-law, Rebecca Motte in developing a rice plantation known as Eldorado on the Santee River outside Charleston. She lived there with him and her daughter and grandchildren in her later years.

==Presidential election of 1796==

Pinckney&#x27;s diplomatic success with Spain made him popular at home, and on his return the Federalist party nominated him as a candidate in the 1796 presidential election. The Federalists were strongest in the region of New England, and they hoped that Pinckney&#x27;s Southern roots would help him win votes in his home region. Pinckney would be the ostensible running mate of Vice President John Adams, but under the electoral rules in place prior to the ratification of the Twelfth Amendment, each member of the Electoral College cast two votes for president with no distinction made between presidential votes and vice presidential votes. Pinckney, Adams, and the main Democratic-Republican candidates, Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr, each had a potential chance at winning the presidency.

Alexander Hamilton clashed with Adams over control of the Federalist Party, and he may have worked to elect Pinckney as president over Adams. Many Democratic-Republicans held favorable views of Pinckney, who had not been closely identified with the Federalist Party before 1796. Some Democratic-Republicans hoped that Pinckney could bridge partisan divides. Thus, Pinckney could potentially attract electors who would not consider voting for Adams.

In the election, most New England electors voted for the Federalist candidates, most Southern electors voted for Democratic-Republican candidates, and the two parties each received support from electors in the middle states. South Carolina split its vote between Jefferson and Pinckney, awarding each candidate 8 electoral votes. However, several New England electors, fearing the possibility of Pinckney&#x27;s election over Adams, refused to vote for Pinckney. Adams finished with 71 electoral votes, Jefferson with 68 electoral votes, and Pinckney with 59 electoral votes. Adams became president and, under the rules then in place, the runner-up, Jefferson, became vice president.

==Later life==
===Public service===
Pinckney was elected to the United States House of Representatives in September 1797, and served until March 1801. His service was frequently affected by poor health, and he declined to seek another term in 1800. While in Congress, he supported the Alien and Sedition Acts. He also served as one of the impeachment managers appointed by the House in 1798 to conduct the impeachment proceedings against William Blount.

After leaving Congress, Pinckney once again focused on developing his plantations. At the request of President James Madison, he returned to military service during the War of 1812. He did see battle during the war, but served as an administrator of American forces in the Southern United States. In 1826, he succeeded his brother as the president of the Society of the Cincinnati, an organization made up of veteran officers of the American Revolutionary War.

===Denmark Vesey conspiracy===

In 1822, news was reported of a massive planned slave uprising, to be led by Denmark Vesey, a literate free man of color. Vesey and numerous other free blacks and slaves were quickly arrested in a roundup and suppression of rebellion by authorities. Slaves constituted the majority of the population in Charleston, where there was a substantial population of free people of color. Whites long feared just such an uprising. In closed court proceedings, Vesey and numerous other suspects were convicted; they were soon executed as conspirators. Arrests continued, with some suspects deported from the country.

Pinckney published a pamphlet listing factors that he thought led to the rebellion conspiracy and should be prevented in the future. 
*1st: The example of Saint-Domingue (now Haiti), where slaves were freed by the victors in the French Revolution of 1804. Many of the freed slaves and their families resettled in the Charleston area. Vesey planned an insurrection on Bastille Day, July 14, 1822. 
*2nd: The indiscreet zeal in favor of universal liberty, expressed by many of our fellow citizens in the States north and east of Maryland; aided by the black population of those states. 
*3rd: The idleness, dissipation, and improper indulgences permitted among all classes of negroes in Charleston, and particularly among the domestic being taught to read and write. Being taught to read and write is the most dangerous. 
*4th: The facility of obtaining money afforded by the nature of their occupations to those employed as mechanics, draymen, fisherman, butchers, porters and hucksters. 
*5th: The disparity of numbers between the white and black inhabitants of the city.

===Death===
Pinckney died in Charleston, South Carolina, on November 2, 1828. He is interred in St. Philip&#x27;s Churchyard.

==Legacy and honors==
*From at least 1801 through 1825, he and his second wife Frances Pinckney lived at a town house they built at 14 George Street, in Charleston. It is now preserved as the Middleton-Pinckney House and listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
*Pinckneyville, Georgia, was named after General Thomas Pinckney, after he traveled through the area. That town no longer exists, as its residents left to found the nearby Norcross. Pinckneyville is the name of a Middle School in Norcross.
*Pinckney, New York, was named after him.
*Pinckney was portrayed by Hugh O&#x27;Gorman in the miniseries &quot;John Adams&quot;, though he is erroneously portrayed as a United States Senator instead of Ambassador to Great Britain during the George Washington administration

==Family==

His father, Charles Pinckney, was Chief Justice of South Carolina. His mother, Eliza Lucas, was prominent for introducing the cultivation of indigo to the colonies.
His brother Charles Cotesworth Pinckney and his cousin Charles Pinckney were signers of the United States Constitution.

Pinckney first married Elizabeth Motte in 1779, a daughter of Jacob and Rebecca Brewton Motte, a planter and merchant family. After her death, he married in 1797 her younger sister, Frances, the widow of John Middleton. (He was a cousin of Arthur Middleton.) The Mottes were patriots in the Revolution.

Pinckney&#x27;s elder son, Colonel Thomas Jr. (1780–1842), married Elizabeth Izard (1781–1862), a cousin twice removed of South Carolina Congressman Ralph Izard.

His younger son, named Charles Cotesworth Pinckney (1789–1865) after his brother, married Phoebe Caroline Elliott, a daughter of a South Carolina State Representative, William Elliott, and Phoebe Waight. That son served as Lt. Governor of South Carolina between 1832 and 1834.

The Pinckneys&#x27; daughter Elizabeth married William Lowndes, son of Revolutionary War-era South Carolina Governor Rawlins Lowndes. He became a leading Democratic-Republican voice in the House of Representatives from 1812 until his death in 1822. Lowndes&#x27;s connection to the Pinckneys, despite their contrasting political affiliation, helped gain the younger man&#x27;s election to Congress in 1811.

<text>Zhou Yu (, ) (175–210), courtesy name Gongjin (), was a Chinese military general and strategist serving under the warlord Sun Ce in the late Eastern Han dynasty of China. After Sun Ce died in the year 200, he continued serving under Sun Quan, Sun Ce&#x27;s younger brother and successor. Zhou Yu is primarily known for his leading role in defeating the numerically superior forces of the northern warlord Cao Cao at the Battle of Red Cliffs in late 208, and again at the Battle of Jiangling in 209. Zhou Yu&#x27;s victories served as the bedrock of Sun Quan&#x27;s regime, which in 222 became Eastern Wu, one of the Three Kingdoms. Zhou Yu did not live to see Sun Quan&#x27;s enthronement, however, as he died at the age of 35 in 210 while preparing to invade Yi Province (modern Sichuan and Chongqing). According to the &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, Zhou Yu was described as tall and handsome. He was also referred to as &quot;Zhou the Youth&quot; (&quot;zhoulang&quot; 周郎). However, his popular moniker &quot;Zhou the Beautiful Youth&quot; (&quot;meizhoulang&quot; 美周郎) does not appear in either the &quot;Records&quot; or the 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;. Some Japanese writers such as Fumihiko Koide believe that this was a later invention by Japanese storytellers such as Eiji Yoshikawa.

==Family background==
Zhou Yu was from Shu County (), Lujiang Commandery (), which is present-day Shucheng County, Anhui. Two of his relatives – his greatuncle Zhou Jing (), and Zhou Jing&#x27;s son Zhou Zhong () – served as the Grand Commandant () in the Han central government, the highest military official position. Zhou Yu&#x27;s father, Zhou Yi (), was a prefect of the imperial capital, Luoyang.

==Service under Sun Ce==
===Friendship===
Around the year 191, Sun Jian raised an army to join the Campaign against Dong Zhuo and moved his family from Shouchun (寿春; around present-day Shou County, Anhui) to Zhou Yu&#x27;s hometown in Shu County. Zhou Yu befriended Sun Jian&#x27;s eldest son, Sun Ce, who was born in the same year as him. The two became very close friends. Zhou Yu not only offered to let Sun Ce and his family stay in the Zhou family home, but also paid respects to Sun Ce&#x27;s mother Lady Wu as if she were his mother.

The &quot;Jiang Biao Zhuan&quot; () contains a slightly different account of how Zhou Yu and Sun Ce met each other. It mentions that Zhou Yu heard of Sun Ce&#x27;s reputation and wanted to meet him, so he travelled from Shu County to Shouchun to visit Sun Ce. The two of them developed such a close friendship that Sun Ce heeded Zhou Yu&#x27;s advice to bring along his family and relocate from Shouchun to Shu County.

===Conquering Jiangdong===
Zhou Yu later travelled to Danyang Commandery (丹楊郡; around present-day Xuancheng, Anhui) to join his uncle Zhou Shang (), who was serving as the Administrator () of Danyang. Around 194, Sun Ce (孙策), then acting under orders from the warlord Yuan Shu, led troops into Yang Province to aid his relatives Wu Jing and Sun Ben against the encroachments of the warlord Liu Yao. While Sun Ce was preparing to cross the Yangtze River at Liyang (歷陽; present-day He County, Anhui) for an attack on Liu Yao, he sent a messenger to inform Zhou Yu about his plans. Zhou Yu led troops to assist Sun Ce, who gratefully told Zhou Yu: &quot;With your aid, I can attain greatness!&quot;

Zhou Yu then joined Sun Ce in his conquests of Hengjiang (橫江; southeast of present-day He County, Anhui, on the northern shore of the Yangtze) and Dangli (當利; east of present-day He County, Anhui). They crossed the Yangtze River, conquered Moling (秣陵; in present-day Nanjing, Jiangsu) and defeated Liu Yao&#x27;s forces under Ze Rong and Xue Li (). They also conquered Hushu (湖孰; southeast of present-day Jiangning, Jiangsu), Jiangcheng (江乘; north of present-day Jurong, Jiangsu), and Qu&#x27;e (曲阿; present-day Danyang, Jiangsu). Liu Yao fled in the wake of his defeat and the strength of Sun Ce&#x27;s forces increased to tens of thousands.

===Later service under Sun Ce===
Sun Ce told Zhou Yu: &quot;I now have sufficient military power to conquer Wu and pacify the Shanyue. You can return to Danyang and station there.&quot; Zhou Yu then made his way back to Danyang. Around 196, Yuan Shu had sent his cousin Yuan Yin () to replace Zhou Shang as the Administrator of Danyang, so Zhou Shang and Zhou Yu went to Shouchun (壽春; present-day Shou County, Anhui) to meet Yuan Shu. Yuan Shu wanted to recruit Zhou Yu to serve under him, but Zhou Yu foresaw Yuan Shu&#x27;s downfall so he pretended to ask for the appointment of Chief () of Juchao (居巢; present-day Juchao District, Chaohu, Anhui) while secretly planning to leave Yuan Shu and join Sun Ce. After Yuan Shu approved his request, Zhou Yu travelled to Wu Commandery (around present-day Suzhou, Jiangsu) via Juchao.

In 198, Zhou Yu arrived in Wu Commandery, where Sun Ce personally received and welcomed him. Sun Ce appointed Zhou Yu as General of the Household Who Establishes Might () and put him in command of 2,000 troops and gave him 50 horses. Sun Ce said: &quot;Zhou Gongjin is an extraordinary hero and talent. He&#x27;s very close to me and we are like brothers. I still remember that time when he brought his troops and supplies from Danyang to assist me in my campaign. I can never repay him for his help and contributions.&quot;

Zhou Yu was 23 years old at the time, and he was nicknamed &quot;Zhou Lang&quot; (周郎; literally &quot;Zhou the youth&quot;) by the people in Wu. He was garrisoned in Lujiang Commandery () and later moved to Niuzhu () before assuming his appointment as the Chief () of Chungu County (春穀縣; northwest of present-day Fanchang County, Anhui). When Sun Ce planned his attack Jing Province (covering present-day Hubei and Hunan), he appointed Zhou Yu as Central Protector of the Army () and the Administrator () of Jiangxia Commandery (). Zhou Yu accompanied Sun Ce in the conquest of Wan (皖; present-day Qianshan County, Anhui). Zhou Yu then joined Sun Ce in attacking Xunyang County (尋陽縣; southwest of present-day Huangmei County, Hubei), where they defeated a minor warlord Liu Xun. They then invaded Jiangxia Commandery (江夏郡; around present-day Xinzhou District, Wuhan, Hubei) and subsequently pacified Yuzhang Commandery (豫章郡; around present-day Nanchang, Jiangxi) and Luling Commandery (廬陵郡; around present-day Ji&#x27;an, Jiangxi). Zhou Yu later returned to Baqiu (巴丘; present-day Xiajiang County, Jiangxi) and garrisoned there.

==Service under Sun Quan==

===Advising Sun Quan not to send a hostage===
Sun Ce was assassinated in the year 200 by the followers of Xu Gong, a commandery administrator whom he killed earlier. His younger brother, Sun Quan, succeeded him and took control of his territories. Zhou Yu rushed back to Wu Commandery (around present-day Suzhou, Jiangsu) to attend Sun Ce&#x27;s funeral and remained in Wu Commandery after the funeral. Zhou Yu then held the appointment of Central Protector of the Army (). As Sun Quan was still relatively young and inexperienced then, Zhou Yu and Zhang Zhao assisted him in overseeing the day-to-day affairs in the Jiangdong territories.

Around the time, the warlord Cao Cao, who controlled the Han court and the figurehead Emperor Xian, had recently defeated his rival Yuan Shao at the Battle of Guandu and was achieving success in his campaigns to unify northern China. In 202, Cao Cao wrote a letter to Sun Quan, demanding that Sun Quan send one of his sons to the imperial capital Xu (許; present-day Xuchang, Henan) as a hostage, so as to secure Sun Quan&#x27;s allegiance towards him. Sun Quan gathered all his subjects, including Zhang Zhao and Qin Song, for a discussion, but they could not arrive at a conclusion.

Sun Quan was reluctant to send one of his sons to be a hostage in the capital, so he had another discussion with only his mother Lady Wu and Zhou Yu. Zhou Yu said: 

Lady Wu agreed with Zhou Yu and she said: &quot;What Gongjin said is true. Gongjin was around the same age as Bofu as he was only a month younger than Bofu. I see Gongjin as a son, so you should treat him like an elder brother.&quot; Sun Quan heeded their advice and did not send a hostage to Cao Cao.

===Battles against Huang Zu===
In 206, Zhou Yu and Sun Quan&#x27;s cousin Sun Yu attacked bandits at Ma () and Bao () counties and killed their chiefs and captured thousands of enemies. Later that year, Huang Zu, the Administrator () of Jiangxia Commandery (江夏郡; around present-day Xinzhou District, Wuhan, Hubei), sent his subordinate Deng Long () to lead a few thousand troops to attack Sun Quan&#x27;s forces in Chaisang Commandery (柴桑郡; around present-day Jiujiang, Jiangxi). Zhou Yu attacked Deng Long, captured him alive, and sent him as a prisoner-of-war to Wu Commandery (around present-day Suzhou, Jiangsu).

In the spring of 208, Sun Quan ordered an attack on Jiangxia, which was defended by Huang Zu. Zhou Yu was assigned as the Chief Commander of the Front Army () and he, along with Lü Meng, Ling Tong and others, scored a major victory over the enemy. Huang Zu was killed by Sun Quan&#x27;s forces when attempting to escape.

===Advising Sun Quan to go to war with Cao Cao===
In the late autumn of 208, Cao Cao started a campaign aimed at wiping out all opposing forces in southern China. When his forces arrived in Jing Province (covering present-day Hubei and Hunan), the provincial governor Liu Cong surrendered without putting up any resistance. When Sun Quan&#x27;s men heard that Cao Cao had obtained tens of thousands of Jing Province&#x27;s land and naval troops, they were all very afraid because they knew Cao Cao&#x27;s next target was Sun Quan&#x27;s territories in Jiangdong.

Cao Cao wrote a letter to Sun Quan as follows: &quot;Of late, I have been leading a punitive campaign in accordance with an imperial decree. Liu Cong surrendered when I led the imperial army to the south. Now, I have 800,000 naval troops under my command, and I wish to participate in a hunting expedition in Wu with you, General.&quot; Sun Quan summoned all his subjects for a meeting to discuss how to counter an impending invasion by Cao Cao. Many of them turned pale when he showed them the letter.

Some of Sun Quan&#x27;s followers suggested to surrender to Cao Cao on the grounds that the strength of their armed forces was not comparable to Cao Cao&#x27;s. Zhou Yu, however, had a different opinion and he said: 

Sun Quan replied: &quot;The old villain has harboured the intention of usurping the Han dynasty for a long time, but he feared the two Yuans (Yuan Shao and Yuan Shu), Lü Bu, Liu Biao and me. Now, all the others have been destroyed and I am the only one left. The old villain and I cannot coexist together. Your idea of going to war coincides closely with my thoughts. This is a sign that Heaven has granted you to me.&quot; He then drew his sword, slashed the table in front of him and said: &quot;Any of you who dares to speak of surrendering to Cao Cao shall end up like this table!&quot;

Later that night, Zhou Yu came to see Sun Quan and said: 

Sun Quan placed his hand on Zhou Yu&#x27;s shoulder and replied: 

Pei Songzhi, who annotated Zhou Yu&#x27;s biography in the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot;, argued that Lu Su was actually the first person who urged Sun Quan to resist Cao Cao. Zhou Yu was at Poyang County before Sun Quan held the discussion with his subjects, and Lu Su suggested to Sun Quan to summon Zhou Yu back for the meeting. Zhou Yu and Lu Su gave similar advice to Sun Quan, which resulted in Sun Quan arriving at his decision to go to war with Cao Cao. Pei Songzhi argued that it was unfair to Lu Su because Zhou Yu&#x27;s biography gave full credit to Zhou Yu for being the only person to urge Sun Quan to resist Cao Cao, and failed to mention that Lu Su had already urged Sun Quan to resist Cao Cao before Zhou Yu did.

===Battle of Red Cliffs===

Around the time, Liu Bei had recently been defeated by Cao Cao at the Battle of Changban, and he planned to lead his followers south across the Yangtze River. Liu Bei met Lu Su at Dangyang, where they discussed the formation of an alliance between Liu Bei and Sun Quan. Liu Bei then moved to Xiakou (夏口; present-day Hankou, Hubei) and garrisoned there. At the same time, he also sent his adviser Zhuge Liang to accompany Lu Su to meet Sun Quan and discuss a Sun–Liu alliance. Sun Quan ordered Zhou Yu and Cheng Pu to lead his forces to join Liu Bei in resisting Cao Cao, and they rendezvoused at Red Cliffs (). A plague had broken out in Cao Cao&#x27;s army, so Cao Cao lost to the allied forces in an early skirmish between both sides. Cao Cao then moved his camp to the northern bank of the Yangtze River while the allies remained at the south.

Huang Gai, one of Sun Quan&#x27;s generals, told Zhou Yu: &quot;The enemy are superior in numbers in comparison with our side. I fear that we cannot last long. However, I observe that Cao Cao&#x27;s ships are linked to each other. We can destroy them by fire.&quot; Huang Gai then prepared about ten &quot;mengchong&quot;s and (鬬艦; a type of warship) and filled them with the ingredients necessary for starting a fire. He also wrote a letter to Cao Cao, pretending that he wanted to surrender and defect to Cao Cao&#x27;s side.

Huang Gai then prepared some (走舸; a smaller type of boat), which would follow behind the and , and his small fleet sailed towards Cao Cao&#x27;s base. The wind was blowing strongly from the southeast. When Huang Gai&#x27;s fleet reached the middle of the river, the ships all raised their sails, and Huang Gai lifted a torch and instructed his men to shout &quot;We surrender!&quot; Cao Cao&#x27;s troops came out of the camp to look and they said Huang Gai was coming to join them. When Huang Gai was about 20 &quot;li&quot; away from the enemy base, he ordered his men to set the ships on fire and they boarded the smaller boats behind. As the wind was very strong, the flaming ships sailed towards Cao Cao&#x27;s warships at fast speed and caused them to catch fire as well. Cao Cao&#x27;s ships were all burnt down and the flames also spread quickly to his camps on land. Zhou Yu then ordered an attack on Cao Cao&#x27;s base and scored a major victory. Cao Cao retreated north with his surviving troops after his defeat. Zhou Yu and Liu Bei led their respective forces in pursuit of Cao Cao, but Cao had already fled.

===Battles of Jiangling===
After his defeat at Red Cliffs, Cao Cao returned to Xu (許; present-day Xuchang, Henan) and left Cao Ren and others behind to defend Jiangling County, the capital of Nan Commandery (). Zhou Yu and Cheng Pu led their troops towards Nan Commandery and were separated from Cao Ren&#x27;s forces by the river. Liu Bei told Zhou Yu: &quot;Cao Ren is defending Jiangling and he has much supplies in the city. He poses a big threat to us. I will send Zhang Yide with 1,000 men to accompany you, while you dispatch 2,000 troops to follow me. We will then cross the Xia River (夏水; a tributary of the Yangtze River starting from southeast of Shashi District and ending at north of Jianli County in Hubei) and attack Cao Ren&#x27;s rear. When Cao Ren hears that we have infiltrated his rear, he will definitely retreat.&quot; Zhou Yu agreed to Liu Bei&#x27;s suggestion.

Zhou Yu later ordered Gan Ning to station at Yiling (夷陵; present-day Yichang, Hubei). Cao Ren sent a separate cavalry force to besiege Yiling, so Gan Ning sent an urgent request to Zhou Yu for reinforcements. Zhou Yu followed Lü Meng&#x27;s advice and left Ling Tong to defend his current position while leading Lü Meng and others to help Gan Ning. After the siege at Yiling was lifted, Zhou Yu and his troops crossed the Yangtze River and attacked Jiangling, with Zhou personally participating in battle. He was hit on his right side by a stray arrow and had to retreat due to the severity of the wound. When Cao Ren heard that Zhou Yu was wounded and bedridden, he led his troops to outside Zhou Yu&#x27;s camp and taunted the Wu troops. Zhou Yu got out of bed and personally inspected his men and encouraged them to raise their morale. Cao Ren saw that and retreated.

By 209, Zhou Yu and Cao Ren had held up against each other for over a year and both sides had sustained heavy casualties. Cao Cao could no longer afford the continuous losses in personnel and materiel, so he ordered Cao Ren to withdraw from Jiangling.

===Advice to Sun Quan on how to deal with Liu Bei===
After the victory at the Battle of Jiangling, Sun Quan appointed Zhou Yu as a Lieutenant-General () and the Administrator () of Nan Commandery (). Zhou Yu&#x27;s headquarters were at Jiangling County while he was in charge of Xiajun (), Hanchang (), Liuyang () and Zhouling () counties.

Liu Bei assumed the appointment of Governor () of Jing Province with his administrative centre at Gong&#x27;an County. When Liu Bei later met Sun Quan at Jing (京; present-day Zhenjiang, Jiangsu), Zhou Yu wrote to Sun Quan: 

Sun Quan considered that Cao Cao was still a threat in the north, so he thought it would be better for him to have more allies instead of creating hostility between him and Liu Bei. Besides, he was also worried that Liu Bei&#x27;s men might not submit to him, so he rejected Zhou Yu&#x27;s idea.

==Death==
Around 210, Liu Zhang was serving as the governor of Yi Province (covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing), and he faced the threat of his rival Zhang Lu in Hanzhong Commandery. Zhou Yu went to see Sun Quan and proposed: &quot;Cao Cao is still recovering from his defeats and he faces internal threats, so he will not go to war with you any time soon. I seek your permission to let me and Sun Yu lead an army to invade Shu (Yi Province) and attack Zhang Lu after that. Sun Yu will then remain behind to defend the conquered territories and form an alliance with Ma Chao. I will join you in attacking Cao Cao at Xiangyang, and together we can conquer the north.&quot; Sun Quan agreed.

Zhou Yu then headed back to Jiangling County to make preparations for the campaign. However, he died of illness at Baqiu (巴丘; present-day Yueyang, Hunan) on the way back. He was 36 years old (by East Asian age reckoning) at the time of his death.

Before Zhou Yu&#x27;s death, he recommended Lu Su to Sun Quan to be his successor.

Sun Quan deeply mourned Zhou Yu&#x27;s death. He shed tears and said: &quot;Gongjin possessed the calibre of a talented adviser to a ruler. Now that he has died at such a young age, who can I still rely on?&quot; He even wore plain garments to express his sorrow, which touched many people. After a funeral was held for Zhou Yu at Baqiu, his body was transported back to Wu Commandery (around present-day Suzhou, Jiangsu). Sun Quan received the procession at Wuhu and personally paid for all the expenses. He also issued an order allowing Zhou Yu&#x27;s family to keep retainers.

In 229, nearly two decades after Zhou Yu&#x27;s death, when Sun Quan declared himself the emperor of the state of Eastern Wu, he told his subjects: &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t have become an emperor today if there wasn&#x27;t Zhou Gongjin to assist me.&quot;

==Family==
Sometime between 198 and 199, Zhou Yu joined Sun Ce in the conquest of Wan (皖; present-day Qianshan County, Anhui). In Wan, they met a certain Elder Qiao (), who had two daughters who were famed for their beautiful looks. Sun Ce married the elder sister while Zhou Yu married the younger one. Sun Ce joked with Zhou Yu: &quot;Although Elder Qiao&#x27;s daughters are exceptionally beautiful, with us as their husbands, it should be a happy enough match&quot; (because Sun Ce and Zhou Yu were both known for being handsome youths). 

Zhou Yu had two sons and a daughter. It is unknown if his three children were born to his wife Xiao Qiao.

Zhou Yu&#x27;s daughter, Lady Zhou, married Sun Quan&#x27;s eldest son Sun Deng, who was designated as the crown prince after his father became the emperor of Eastern Wu, in 225. Sun Deng later died at the age of 32, preceding his father.

Zhou Yu&#x27;s elder son, Zhou Xun (), resembled his father in personality, but died very early. He married Sun Quan&#x27;s daughter Sun Luban and served as a Cavalry Commandant () in Eastern Wu.

Zhou Yu&#x27;s younger son, Zhou Yin (), married a woman from Sun Quan&#x27;s clan. He served as the Commandant of Xingye () and was placed in command of 1,000 troops and garrisoned at Gong&#x27;an County. In 229, after Sun Quan became emperor, he granted Zhou Yin the title of a Marquis of a Chief District (). Zhou Yin was exiled to Luling Commandery (廬陵郡; around present-day Ji&#x27;an, Jiangxi) later for committing an offence. In 239, Zhuge Jin and Bu Zhi wrote a memorial to Sun Quan, requesting for Zhou Yin to be pardoned and restored of his marquis title and appointment on account of his father&#x27;s contributions. Sun Quan was reluctant to do so, as he noted the severity of Zhou Yin&#x27;s offence and said that Zhou Yin had not shown any sign of remorse. However, after much urging from Zhuge Jin, Bu Zhi, Zhu Ran and Quan Cong, Sun Quan eventually agreed, but Zhou Yin had died of illness in exile around the time when the pardon was issued.

Zhou Jun (), the son of Zhou Yu&#x27;s elder brother, was appointed as a Lieutenant-General () and placed in command of 1,000 men by Sun Quan because of his uncle&#x27;s meritorious service. After Zhou Jun died, Quan Cong requested for Sun Quan to commission Zhou Jun&#x27;s son, Zhou Hu (), as a military officer but Sun declined. Sun Quan replied, &quot;In the past, we managed to defeat Cao Cao and obtain Jing Province because of Gongjin&#x27;s efforts. I have never forgotten his contributions. When I heard of Zhou Jun&#x27;s death, I intended to recruit Zhou Hu into the civil service, but I have also heard that Zhou Hu is ruthless and treacherous in his ways. I was worried he will cause trouble if he is given an official appointment so I decided to not recruit him. My memories of Gongjin are lasting. How can I ever stop missing him?&quot;

==Personal life==
Zhou Yu was described to have strong physique and handsome looks. When Zhou Yu became close friends with Sun Ce, Sun Ce&#x27;s mother Lady Wu told Sun Ce&#x27;s younger brother Sun Quan to treat Zhou Yu like an elder brother. After Sun Quan succeeded Sun Ce, his subordinates did not observe the full protocol when they paid their respects to him. Zhou Yu was the only and the first person to follow all the formalities and etiquette when he paid respect to Sun Quan.

Zhou Yu was known to be a magnanimous and generous man who won the hearts of many people with his character. However, there was one person he could not get along well with – Cheng Pu. Cheng Pu was much older than Zhou Yu, and he often insulted and belittled the latter, but Zhou Yu tolerated him. Cheng Pu was so impressed with Zhou Yu that he eventually changed his attitude towards Zhou Yu and treated him respectfully. He even remarked: &quot;Being with Zhou Gongjin is like drinking the finest of wines. You get carried away and become drunk before even realizing it.&quot;

Sometime early in Zhou Yu&#x27;s career, Cao Cao heard of Zhou&#x27;s talent and wanted to recruit Zhou Yu to serve under him, so he sent Jiang Gan to persuade Zhou Yu to defect to his side. However, Zhou Yu indirectly affirmed his loyalty to Sun Quan in front of Jiang Gan, and hinted to Jiang Gan that he cannot be persuaded to switch his allegiance. When Jiang Gan later returned to Cao Cao, he told Cao Cao that &quot;Zhou Yu&#x27;s magnanimity was too great to be described in words&quot;.

Around 209, after visiting Sun Quan at Jing (京; present-day Zhenjiang, Jiangsu), Liu Bei was on his journey back to Jing Province when Sun Quan, along with Zhang Zhao, Qin Song, Lu Su and others, rushed to catch up with Liu Bei to see him off. Sun Quan then held a farewell banquet for Liu Bei. After the feast, the others left while only Liu Bei and Sun Quan remained behind. When they spoke of Zhou Yu, Liu Bei said: &quot;Gongjin&#x27;s talents and abilities are far greater than those of thousands of others. He possesses great ambitions and he may not be willing to remain subordinate for long.&quot; In another incident, after his defeat at the hands of Zhou Yu at the Battle of Red Cliffs, Cao Cao remarked: &quot;I am not ashamed of having lost the battle.&quot; He later wrote to Sun Quan: &quot;At the Battle of Red Cliffs, my men were affected by a plague, so I burnt my warships and retreated of my own accord. That resulted in Zhou Yu claiming the glory (of winning the battle).&quot; Zhou Yu&#x27;s widespread fame incurred much jealousy towards him, which was why Cao Cao and Liu Bei attempted to slander him and sow discord between him and Sun Quan.

Zhou Yu was known to be very learned in music from a young age. Even after three rounds of drinking at a banquet, he could still detect a mistake or a wrong note when a musical piece was being played. When that happened, he would look up at the musician. There was a saying at that time to describe this: &quot;If there is a problem with the tune, Zhou Yu will look up.&quot;

==In &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;==
Zhou Yu is featured as a major character in the 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, which romanticises the historical events before and during the Three Kingdoms period. The novel fabricated the rivalry between him and Zhuge Liang. Zhou Yu is depicted to be extremely jealous of Zhuge Liang&#x27;s talent and relentlessly attempt to outwit the latter on several occasions but never succeeds. His roles in the events leading to, and during the Battle of Red Cliffs, are largely overshadowed by Zhuge Liang&#x27;s. Furthermore, his death is heavily dramatised in the novel and intentionally triggered by Zhuge Liang. Zhou Yu sustains an arrow wound at the Battle of Jiangling against Cao Ren&#x27;s forces, and his condition deteriorates after Zhuge Liang makes him angry by foiling his plans on three occasions later. On the third time, Zhou Yu coughs blood and dies.

<text>Khwarazm (; ; , &quot;Xwârazm&quot; or &quot;Xârazm&quot;) or Chorasmia () is a large oasis region on the Amu Darya river delta in western Central Asia, bordered on the north by the (former) Aral Sea, on the east by the Kyzylkum Desert, on the south by the Karakum Desert, and on the west by the Ustyurt Plateau. It was the center of the Iranian Khwarezmian civilization, and a series of kingdoms such as the Afrighid dynasty and the Anushtegin dynasty, whose capitals were (among others) Kath, Gurganj (now Konye-Urgench) andfrom the 16th century onKhiva. Today Khwarazm belongs partly to Uzbekistan and partly to Turkmenistan.

== Names and etymology ==

=== Names ===
Khwarazm has been known also as &quot;Chorasmia&quot;, &quot;Khaurism&quot;, &quot;Khwarezm&quot;, &quot;Khwarezmia&quot;, &quot;Khwarizm&quot;, &quot;Khwarazm&quot;, &quot;Khorezm&quot;, &quot;Khoresm&quot;, &quot;Khorasam&quot;, &quot;Kharazm&quot;, &quot;Harezm&quot;, &quot;Horezm&quot;, and &quot;Chorezm&quot;.

In Avestan the name is &#x27;; in Old Persian 𐎢𐎺𐎠𐎼𐏀𐎷𐎡𐏁 or 𐎢𐎺𐎠𐎼𐏀𐎷𐎡𐎹 (/hUvārazmī-/); in Modern &#x27;; in &#x27;; in Old Chinese * (); in Modern Chinese &#x27; ( / Xiao&#x27;erjing: خُوَلاذِمُوْ); in , &quot;Xorazm&quot;, خوارَزم; in (&#x27;), حورەزم; in , &quot;Хоразм&quot;, خورەزم; in , &quot;Хорезм&quot;, خوْرِزم; in , &quot;Харәзм&quot;; in ; in Greek language (&#x27;) and (&quot;&quot;) by Herodotus.

=== Etymology ===

The Arab geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi in his &quot;Muʿǧam al-Buldan&quot; wrote that the name was a Persian compound of &#x27; (), and &#x27; (), referring to the abundance of cooked fish as a main diet of the peoples of this area.

C.E. Bosworth, however, believed the Persian name to be made up of &#x27; ( &#x27;the sun&#x27;) and &#x27; ( &#x27;earth, land&#x27;), designating &#x27;the land from which the sun rises&#x27;, although a similar etymology is also given for Khurasan. Another view is that the Iranian compound stands for &#x27;lowland&#x27; from &#x27; &#x27;low&#x27; and &#x27; &#x27;land&#x27;. Khwarazm is indeed the lowest region in Central Asia (except for the Caspian Sea to the far west), located on the delta of the Amu Darya on the southern shores of the Aral Sea. Various forms of &quot;&quot; are commonly used in the Persian Gulf to stand for tidal flats, marshland, or tidal bays (e.g., Khor Musa, Khor Abdallah, Hor al-Azim, Hor al-Himar, etc.)

The name also appears in Achaemenid inscriptions as &quot;Huvarazmish&quot;, which is declared to be part of the Persian Empire.

Some of the early scholars believed Khwarazm to be what ancient Avestic texts refer to as (&#x27;; later Middle Persian &#x27;). These sources claim that Old Urgench, which was the capital of ancient Khwarazm for many years, was actually Ourva, the eighth land of Ahura Mazda mentioned in the Pahlavi text of Vendidad. However, Michael Witzel, a researcher in early Indo-European history, believes that Airyanem Vaejah was in what is now Afghanistan, the northern areas of which were a part of ancient Khwarazm and Greater Khorasan. Others, however, disagree. University of Hawaii historian Elton L. Daniel believes Khwarazm to be the &quot;most likely locale&quot; corresponding to the original home of the Avestan people, and Dehkhoda calls Khwarazm &quot;the cradle of the Aryan tribe&quot; ().

==History==
=== Legendary ===
The Khwarezmian scholar Al-Biruni (973–1048)
says that the land belonging to the mythical king Afrasiab was first colonised 980 years before Alexander the Great (thus , well before the Seleucid era) when the hero of the Iranian epic &quot;Siyavash&quot; came to Khwarazm; his son Kay Khusraw came to the throne 92 years later, in 1200 BC. Al-Biruni starts giving names only with the Afrighid line of Khwarazmshahs, having placed the ascension of Afrighids in 616 of the Seleucid era, i.e. in 305 AD.

=== Early people ===

Like Sogdia, Khwarazm was an expansion of the Bactria–Margiana culture during the Bronze Age, which later fused with Indo-Iranians during their migrations around 1000 BC. Early Iron Age states arose from this cultural exchange. List of successive cultures in Khwarazm region 3000–500 BC:
* Kelteminar culture 
* Suyarganovo culture 
* Tazabagyab culture 
* Amirabad Culture 
* Saka 

During the final Saka phase, there were about 400 settlements in Khwarezm. Ruled by the native Afrighid dynasty, it was at this point that Khwarezm entered the historical record with the Achaemenid expansion.

==== Khwarezmian language and culture ====
An East Iranian language, Khwarezmian was spoken in Khwarezm proper (i.e., the lower Amu Darya region) until soon after the Mongol invasion, when it was replaced by Turkic languages. It was closely related to Sogdian. Other than the astronomical terms used by the native Iranian Khwarezmian speaker Al-Biruni, our other sources of Khwarezmian include al-Zamakhshari&#x27;s Arabic–Persian–Khwarezmian dictionary and several legal texts that use Khwarezmian terms to explain certain legal concepts.

For most of its history, up until the Mongol conquest, the inhabitants of the area were from Iranian stock, and they spoke an Eastern Iranian language called Khwarezmian. The scientist Al-Biruni, a Khwarezm native, in his &quot;Athar ul-Baqiyah&quot;, specifically verifies the Iranian origins of Khwarezmians when he wrote (in Arabic):
(&quot;The people of Khwarezm were a branch from the Persian tree.&quot;)

The area of Khwarezm was under Afrighid and then Samanid control until the 10th century before it was conquered by the Ghaznavids. The Iranian Khwarezmian language and culture felt the pressure of Turkic infiltration from northern Khwarezm southwards, leading to the disappearance of the original Iranian character of the province and its complete Turkicization today. Khwarezmian speech probably lasted in upper Khwarezm, the region round Hazarasp, till the end of the 8th/14th century.

The Khwarezmian language survived for several centuries after Islam until the Turkification of the region, and so must some at least of the culture and lore of ancient Khwarezm, for it is hard to see the commanding figure of Al-Biruni, a repository of so much knowledge, appearing in a cultural vacuum.

=== Achaemenid period ===
The Achaemenid Empire took control of Chorasmia during the time of King Darius I (ruled 522–486 BC). And the Persian poet Ferdowsi mentions Persian cities like Afrasiab and Chach in abundance in his epic Shahnama. The contact with the Achaemenid Empire had a great influence on the material culture of Chorasmia, starting a period of rich economic and cultural development.

Chorasmian troops participated in the Second Persian invasion of Greece by Xerxes in the 480 BC, under the command of Achaemenid general and later satrap Artabazos I of Phrygia. By the time of the Persian king Darius III, Khwarazm had already become an independent kingdom.

=== Hellenistic period ===

Chorasmia was involved in the conquests of Alexander the Great in Central Asia. When the king of Khwarezm offered friendship to Alexander in 328 BC, Alexander&#x27;s Greek and Roman biographers imagined the nomad king of a desert waste, but 20th-century Russian archeologists revealed the region as a stable and centralized kingdom, a land of agriculture to the east of the Aral Sea, surrounded by the nomads of Central Asia, protected by its army of mailed horsemen, in the most powerful kingdom northwest of the Amu Darya (the Oxus River of antiquity). The king&#x27;s emissary offered to lead Alexander&#x27;s armies against his own enemies, west over the Caspian towards the Black Sea (e.g. Kingdom of Iberia and Colchis).

Khwarezm was largely independent during the Seleucid, Greco-Bactrian and Arsacid dynasties. Numerous fortresses were built, and the Khwarazm oasis has been dubbed the &quot;Fifty fortresses oasis&quot;. Chorasmia remained relatively sheltered from the interests of the Seleucid Empire or Greco-Bactria, but various elements of Hellenistic art appear in the ruins of Chorasmian cities, particularly at Akchakhan-Kala, and the influence of the Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhara, reflecting the rise of Kushan Empire, appears at Toprak-Kala. The early rulers of Chorasmia first imitated the coinage of the Greco-Bactrian ruler Eucratides I. Parthian artistic influences have also been described.

From the 1st century BC, Chorasmia developed original coins inspired from Greco-Bactrian, Parthian, and Indo-Scythian types. Artav (Artabanus), a Chorasmian ruler of the 1st–2nd century AD, whose coins were discovered in the capital city of Toprak-Kala, imitated the type of the Kushan Heraios and were found together with coins of the Kushan rulers Vima Kadphises and Kanishka.

From the 2nd century AD, Chorasmia became part of the vast cultural sphere corresponding to the rise of the Kushan Empire in the east.


=== Sassanid period ===

Under Shapur I, the Sasanian Empire spread as far as Khwarezm. Yaqut al-Hamawi verifies that Khwarezm was a regional capital of the Sassanid empire. When speaking of the pre-Islamic &quot;&quot;khosrau&quot; of Khwarezm&quot; (), the Islamic &quot;amir of Khwarezm&quot; (), or even the Khwarezmid Empire, sources such as Al-Biruni and Ibn Khordadbeh and others clearly refer to Khwarezm as being part of the Iranian (Persian) empire. During the reign of Khosrow II, extensive areas of Khwarezm were conquered.

The fact that Pahlavi script which was used by the Persian bureaucracy alongside Old Persian, passed into use in Khwarezmia where it served as the first local alphabet about the AD 2nd century, as well as evidence that Khwarezm-Shahs such as ʿAlā al-Dīn Tekish (1172–1200) issued all their orders (both administrative and public) in the Persian language, corroborates Al-Biruni&#x27;s claims. It was also a vassal kingdom during periods of Kushans, Hephthalites and Gokturks power before the coming of the Arabs.

=== Afrighids ===
Per Al-Biruni, the Afrighids of Kath () were a native Khwarezmian Iranian dynasty which ruled as the Shahs of Khwarezm from 305 to 995 AD. At times they were under Sassanian suzerainty.

In 712, Khwarezm was conquered by the Arab Caliphate (Umayyads and Abbasids). It thus came vaguely under Muslim control, but it was not till the end of the 8th century and the beginning of the 9th century that an Afrighid Shah first converted to Islam appearing with the popular convert&#x27;s name of ʿAbdullah (&#x27;slave of God&#x27;). In the course of the 10th century—when some geographers such as Istakhri in his &quot;Al-Masalik wa-l-mamalik&quot; mention Khwarezm as part of Khorasan and Transoxiania—the local Ma&#x27;munids, based in Gurganj on the left bank of the Amu Darya, grew in economic and political importance due to trade caravans. In 995, they violently overthrew the Afrighids and themselves assumed the traditional title of Khwarazm-Shah.

Briefly, the area was under Samanid suzerainty, before it passed to Mahmud of Ghazni in 1017. From then on, Turko-Mongolian invasions and long rule by Turko-Mongol dynasties supplanted the Iranian character of the region although the title of Khwarezm-Shah was maintained well up to the 13th century.

=== Khwarezmid Empire ===


The date of the founding of the Khwarazmian dynasty remains debatable. During a revolt in 1017, Khwarezmian rebels murdered Abu&#x27;l-Abbas Ma&#x27;mun and his wife, Hurra-ji, sister of the Ghaznavid sultan Mahmud. In response, Mahmud invaded and occupied the region of Khwarazm, which included Nasa and the &quot;ribat&quot; of Farawa. As a result, Khwarazm became a province of the Ghaznavid Empire from 1017 to 1034. In 1077, the governorship of the province, which since 1042/1043 belonged to the Seljuqs, fell into the hands of Anush Tigin Gharchai, a former Turkic slave of the Seljuq sultan. In 1141, the Seljuq Sultan Ahmed Sanjar was defeated by the Qara Khitai at the battle of Qatwan, and Anush Tigin&#x27;s grandson Ala ad-Din Atsiz became a vassal to Yelü Dashi of the Qara Khitan.

Sultan Ahmed Sanjar died in 1156. As the Seljuk state fell into chaos, the Khwarezm-Shahs expanded their territories southward. In 1194, the last Sultan of the Great Seljuq Empire, Toghrul III, was defeated and killed by the Khwarezm ruler Ala ad-Din Tekish, who conquered parts of Khorasan and western Iran. In 1200, Tekish died and was succeeded by his son, Ala ad-Din Muhammad, who initiated a conflict with the Ghurids and was defeated by them at Amu Darya (1204). Following the sack of Khwarizm, Muhammad appealed for aid from his suzerain, the Qara Khitai who sent him an army. With this reinforcement, Muhammad won a victory over the Ghorids at Hezarasp (1204) and forced them out of Khwarizm.

===Mongol conquest by Genghis Khan===

The Khwarezmid Empire ruled over all of Persia in the early 13th century under Shah ʿAlāʾ al-Dīn Muhammad II (1200–1220). From 1218 to 1220, Genghis Khan conquered Central Asia including the Kara-Khitai Khanate, thus ending the Khwarezmid Empire. Sultan Muhammad died after retreating from the Mongols near the Caspian Sea, while his son Jalal ad-Din, after being defeated by Genghis Khan at the Battle of Indus, sought refuge with the Delhi Sultanate, and was later assassinated after various attempts to defeat the Mongols and the Seljuks.

=== Khwarezm during the rule of Qunghrat dynasty (1360–1388) ===
In 1360 there arose in Ḵwarazm an independent minor dynasty of Qunghrat Turks, the Ṣūfīs, but Solaymān Ṣūfī was crushed by Timur in 1388.
The Islamization of Khwarazm was reflected in the creation of literary, scientific and religious works and in the translation of Arabic works into the Turkic language. In the Suleymaniye Library in Istanbul, the Koran is kept with an interlinear translation into Turkic, written in Khwarazm and dated (January – February 1363).

The region of Khwarezm was split between the White Horde and Jagatai Khanate, and its rebuilt capital Gurganj (modern Kunya Urgench, &quot;Old Gorganj&quot; as opposed to the modern city of Urgench some distance away) again became one of the largest and most important trading centers in Central Asia. In the mid-14th century Khwarezm gained independence from the Golden Horde under the Sufid dynasty. However, Timur regarded Khwarezm as a rival to Samarkand, and over the course of five campaigns, destroyed Urganch in 1388.

=== Khwarazm during the reign Shibanids – Arabshahids ===

Control of the region was disputed by the Timurids and the Golden Horde, but in 1511 it passed to a new, local Uzbek dynasty, the ʿArabshahids.
This, together with a shift in the course of the Amu-Darya, caused the center of Khwarezm to shift to Khiva, which became in the 16th century the capital of the Khanate of Khiva, ruled over by the dynasty of the Arabshahids.

Khiva Khanate is the name of Khwarazm adopted in the Russian historical tradition during the period of its existence (1512–1920). The Khiva Khanate was one of the Uzbek khanates. The term &quot;Khiva Khanate&quot; was used for the state in Khwarazm that existed from the beginning of the 16th century until 1920. The term &quot;Khiva Khanate&quot; was not used by the locals, who used the name Khvarazm. In Russian sources the term Khiva Khanate began to be used from the 18th century.

The rumors of gold on the banks of the Amu Darya during the reign of Russia&#x27;s Peter the Great, together with the desire of the Russian Empire to open a trade route to the Indus (modern day Pakistan), prompted an armed trade expedition to the region, led by Prince Alexander Bekovich-Cherkassky, which was repelled by Khiva.

=== Khwarazm during the reign Uzbek dynasty of Qungrats ===
During the reign of the Uzbek Khan Said Muhammad Khan (1856–1864) in the 1850s, for the first time in the history of Khwarazm, a general population census of Khwarazm was carried out.

=== Khwarazm in 1873–1920 ===
It was under Tsars Alexander II and Alexander III that serious efforts to annex the region started. One of the main pretexts for Russian military expeditions to Khiva was to free Russian slaves in the khanate and to prevent future slave capture and trade.

Early in The Great Game, Russian interests in the region collided with those of the British Empire in the First Anglo-Afghan War in 1839.

The Khanate of Khiva was gradually reduced in size from Russian expansion in Turkestan (including Khwarezm) and, in 1873, a peace treaty was signed that established Khiva as a quasi-independent Russian protectorate.

In 1912, the Khiva Khanate numbered up to 440 schools and up to 65 madrasahs with 22,500 students. More than half of the madrasahs were in the city of Khiva (38).

=== Soviet period ===
After the Bolshevik seizure of power in the October Revolution, a short-lived Khorezm People&#x27;s Soviet Republic (later the Khorezm SSR) was created out of the territory of the old Khanate of Khiva, before in 1924 it was finally incorporated into the Soviet Union, with the former Khanate divided between the new Turkmen SSR, Uzbek SSR and Karakalpakstan ASSR (initially part of Kazakh ASSR as Karakalpak Oblast).

The larger historical area of Khwarezm is further divided. Northern Khwarezm became the Uzbek SSR, and in 1925 the western part became the Turkmen SSR. Also, in 1936 the northwestern part became the Kazakh SSR. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, these became Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan respectively. Many of the ancient Khwarezmian towns now lie in Xorazm Region, Uzbekistan.

Today, the area that was Khwarezm has a mixed population of Uzbeks, Karakalpaks, Turkmens, Tajiks, Tatars, and Kazakhs.

== In Persian literature ==
Khwarezm and her cities appear in Persian literature in abundance, in both prose and poetry. Dehkhoda for example defines the name Bukhara itself as &quot;full of knowledge&quot;, referring to the fact that in antiquity, Bukhara was a scientific and scholarship powerhouse. Rumi verifies this when he praises the city as such.

Other examples illustrate the eminent status of Khwarezmid and Transoxianian cities in Persian literature in the past 1500 years:
The world of hearts is under his power in the same manner that

The Khwarazmshahs have brought peace to the world.
:—Khaqani Shirvani
A greedy one went to Khwarezm-shah

early one morning, so I have heard.
:—Saadi

Yaqut al-Hamawi, who visited Khwarezm and its capital in 1219, wrote: &quot;I have never seen a city more wealthy and beautiful than Gurganj&quot;. The city, however, was destroyed during several invasions, in particular when the Mongol army broke the dams of the Amu Darya, which flooded the city. He reports that for every Mongol soldier, four inhabitants of Gurganj were killed. Najmeddin Kubra, the great Sufi master, was among the casualties. The Mongol army that devastated Gurganj was estimated to have been near 80,000 soldiers. The verse below refers to an early previous calamity that fell upon the region:

Oh land of Khorasan! God has saved you,

from the disaster that befell the land of Gurganj and Kath.
:—Divan of Anvari

<text>Todi (; &quot;Tuder&quot; in antiquity) is a town and &quot;comune&quot; (municipality) of the province of Perugia (region of Umbria) in central Italy. It is perched on a tall two-crested hill overlooking the east bank of the river Tiber, commanding distant views in every direction. It was founded in antiquity by the Umbri, at the border with Etruria; the gens Ulpia of Roman emperor Trajan came from Todi.

In the 1990s, Richard S. Levine, a professor of Architecture at the University of Kentucky, included Todi in academic design exercises aimed at conceiving hypothetical improvements to the city and presented its results in a conference titled &quot;The Sustainable City of the Past and the Sustainable City of the Future&quot;. As a result, the Italian press incorrectly reported on Todi as &quot;the world&#x27;s most livable city&quot;.

==History==
According to the legend, said to have been recorded around 1330 BC by a mythological Quirinus Colonus, Todi was built by Hercules, who here killed Cacus, and gave the city the name of &quot;Eclis&quot;.

Historical Todi was founded by the ancient Italic people of the Umbri, in the 8th-7th century BC, with the name of Tutere. The name means &quot;border&quot;, the city being located on the frontier with the Etruscan dominions. It probably was still under the latter&#x27;s influence when it was conquered by the Romans in 217 BC. According to Silius Italicus, it had a double line of walls that stopped Hannibal himself after his victory at Lake Trasimeno. In most Latin texts, the name of the town took the form &quot;Tuder&quot;. 

A notable archeologic find from the Etruscan period is an ancient bronze, the Mars of Todi, discovered in 1835 in the nearby Montesanto; and now at the Gregorian Etruscan section of the Vatican Museums, but a copy is kept in the crypt of the Cathedral.

It was the home of Trajan&#x27;s family, the &quot;Ulpi Traiani&quot;. Christianity spread to Todi very early, through the efforts of St. Terentianus. Bishop St. Fortunatus became the patron saint of the city for his heroic defence of it during the Gothic siege. In Lombard times, Todi was part of the Duchy of Spoleto.

After the 12th century, the city started to expand again: the government was held first by consuls, and then by podestà and a people&#x27;s captain, some of whom achieved wide fame. In 1244 the new quarters, housing mainly the new artisan classes, were enclosed in a new circle of walls.

Benedetto Caetani, the later Pope Boniface VIII, started his career as a Canon in the Cathedral of Todi in 1260. He never forgot his roots in Todi, later describing the city as &quot;the dwelling place of my early youth,&quot; the city which &quot;nourished me while still of tender years,&quot; and as a place where he &quot;held lasting memories.&quot;

In 1290 the city had 40,000 inhabitants. Communal autonomy was lost in 1367 when the city was annexed to the Papal States: the local overlordship shifted among various families (the Tomacelli, the Malatesta, Braccio da Montone, Francesco Sforza and others). Although reduced to half of its former population, Todi lived a brief period of splendour under bishop Angelo Cesi, who rebuilt several edifices or added new ones, like the Cesia Fountain that still bears his name.

In July 1849 Todi received Giuseppe Garibaldi, who was fleeing after the failed democratic attempt of the Republic of Rome.

Todi is the birthplace of the Franciscan poet Jacopone da Todi, who is buried in a special crypt in the church of S. Fortunato.

==Monuments and sites of interest==

Almost all Todi&#x27;s main medieval monuments – the co-cathedral church (&quot;Duomo&quot;), the &quot;Palazzo del Capitano&quot;, the &quot;Palazzo del Priore&quot; and the &quot;Palazzo del Popolo&quot; – front on the main square (&quot;Piazza del Popolo&quot;) on the lower breast of the hill: the piazza is often used as a movie set. The whole landscape is sited over some huge ancient Roman cisterns, with more than 500 pits, which remained in use until 1925.

Over the ages, Todi has been surrounded by three more or less complete concentric walls: the outermost is medieval, the middle wall is Roman, and the innermost is recognizable as partly Etruscan. Sights include also a colossal Roman niched substructure of uncertain purpose (the Nicchioni), the small remnants of a Roman amphitheatre, about a dozen smaller churches, and a few Renaissance or classical palazzi, among which the most important is one by Vignola. In the country outside of the city has many historical castles, fortresses and ancient churches including the famous Todi Castle.

=== Religious architecture or sites ===

*Todi Cathedral: (11th century) Gothic church built at the site of a Lombard church, itself erected over an ancient Roman temple to Apollo. The present church rebuilt after a fire in 1190. The nearly square façade has a large central rose window (1513). Of the same period is the wooden door of the portal, by Antonio Bencivenni from Mercatello, of which only the four upper panels remain today. The church follows the plan of the Latin cross, with a nave and two aisles. Bonifacio VIII allegedly had a second aisle on one side, commonly known as &quot;La navatina&quot;. The large fresco depicting the &quot;Universal Judgment&quot; on the counter-facade was commissioned by Cardinal Angelo Cesi from Ferraù Faenzone, called &quot;Il Faenzone&quot;, influenced by the mannerism of Michelangelo. The choir includes the Gothic altar and a magnificent wooden choir-enclosure (1521) with two floors. One important work of art is the 13th-century &quot;Crucifixion&quot; of the Umbrian school.

*&quot;San Carlo&quot;: small Romanesque and Gothic-style church on Viale San Carlo.
*&quot;San Fortunato&quot;: Paleo-Christian temple (7th century) church on a hilltop of the city, standing along the ruins of a medieval fortress (Rocca). Flanking the entrance portal to San Fortunato are two lion sculptures. In 1292 the construction of a new Gothic edifice was begun by the Franciscans, with a &quot;hall&quot; structure. The plague of 1348 halted work. The lower part of the façade was finished in the second half of the 15th century. The nave and the two aisles have a portal each: these are enriched by fine decorations portraying saints and prophets, with briars representing Good (the vine) and Evil (the fig). The whole apse is occupied by a wooden choir finished in 1590 by Antonio Maffei, from Gubbio. The crypt houses a sepulchre containing the remains of St Fortunatus of Todi and other saints, as well as the tomb of Jacopone da Todi. A chapel has frescoes of a &quot;Madonna and Child&quot; by Masolino da Panicale.
*&quot;Santa Maria della Consolazione&quot;: (begun 1508) domed Renaissance church located on the flank of the hill, just outside the walls. It is often attributed, although without sufficient reason, to Bramante. It has a Greek cross plan: three apses are polygonal and that on the north side is semicircular. Architects who worked on it include Cola da Caprarola, Antonio da Sangallo the Younger, Baldassarre Peruzzi, Galeazzo Alessi, Michele Sanmicheli, Vignola and Ippolito Scalza. The church was inaugurated only in 1607. The apse is surmounted by a square terrace with 4 eagles at the corners, from which the dome rises. In the interior, the altar houses a miraculous image of the Madonna, which according to the tradition, was discovered by a worker during the founding works. 12 niches in the first three apses house giant statues of the apostles. Also noteworthy is the wooden statue of Pope Martin I, native to the Todi area.
*&quot;Santa Maria in Camuccia&quot;: Romanesque and Gothic-style, Roman Catholic church on Via Santa Maria in Camuccia.
*San Giuseppe dei Falegnami: a small Baroque-style, Roman Catholic church from 1612.

=== Secular and civic architecture or sites ===
*&quot;Palazzo del Popolo&quot; (&quot;People&#x27;s Palace&quot;) is a Lombard-Gothic construction that already existed in 1213, and is one of the most ancient communal palaces in Italy. It comprises two great halls: the &quot;Sala Grande Inferiore&quot;, or &quot;Sala delle Pietre&quot;, and the &quot;Sala Grande Superiore&quot;, housing the city&#x27;s Art Gallery.
*&quot;Palazzo del Capitano, Todi&quot;: (&quot;Captain&#x27;s Palace&quot;), built circa 1293 in Italian Gothic style, and named &quot;New Communal Palace&quot; to differentiate it from the former one. It is on two distinct levels: the first floor housed the Justice Hall (currently, seat of the Communal Council), with the Judges&#x27;s offices on the lower. The latter is now occupied by the City Museum, with findings and remains of Todi&#x27;s history. It includes a saddle used by Anita Garibaldi, the wife of Giuseppe Garibaldi. Some rooms are frescoed with histories of the city and portraits of its most illustrious men.
*&quot;Palazzo dei Priori&quot;: located on the southern side of the Piazza, facing the Cathedral. It was begun in 1293 and later enlarged as the seat of the podestà, priors and the Papal governors. The trapezoidal tower was originally lower and had Guelph merlons. The façade includes a big bronze eagle by Giovanni di Giliaccio (1347).
*&quot;Palazzo Vescovile&quot;: Located at the left of the Cathedral, the Bishop&#x27;s Palace was built in 1593 by Cardinal Angelo Cesi at his own expense. His crest is visible over the great portal, attributed to Vignola. The upper floors include a room frescoed by Ferraù Fenzoni and a gallery frescoed by Andrea Polinori in 1629.

<text>Robert Taylor (born Spangler Arlington Brugh; August 5, 1911 – June 8, 1969) was an American film and television actor and singer who was one of the most popular leading men of his era.

Taylor began his career in films in 1934 when he signed with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. He won his first leading role the following year in &quot;Magnificent Obsession&quot;. His popularity increased during the late 1930s and 1940s with appearances in &quot;Camille&quot; (1936), &quot;A Yank at Oxford&quot; (1938), &quot;Waterloo Bridge&quot; (1940), and &quot;Bataan&quot; (1943). During World War II, he served in the United States Naval Air Forces, where he worked as a flight instructor and appeared in instructional films. From 1959 to 1962, he starred in the television series &quot;The Detectives Starring Robert Taylor&quot;. In 1966, he assumed hosting duties from his friend Ronald Reagan on the series &quot;Death Valley Days&quot;.

Taylor was married to actress Barbara Stanwyck from 1939 to 1952. He married actress Ursula Thiess in 1954, and they had two children. A chain smoker, Taylor died of lung cancer at the age of 57.
==Early life==
Taylor was born Spangler Arlington Brugh on August 5, 1911, in Filley, Nebraska, the only child of Ruth Adaline (née Stanhope) and Spangler Andrew Brugh, a farmer turned doctor. During his early life, the family moved several times, living in Muskogee, Oklahoma; Kirksville, Missouri; and Fremont, Nebraska. By September 1917, the Brughs had moved to Beatrice, Nebraska, where they remained for 16 years.

As a teenager, Brugh was a track and field star and played the cello in his high school orchestra. Upon graduation, he enrolled at Doane College in Crete, Nebraska. While at Doane, he took cello lessons from Professor Herbert E. Gray, whom he admired and idolized. After Professor Gray announced he was accepting a new position at Pomona College in Claremont, California, Brugh moved to California and enrolled at Pomona. He joined the campus theater company and also studied with Neely Dickson at the Hollywood Community Theater. Recalled Dickson, &quot;I couldn’t help remembering the first time he came to me, a handsome, young college graduate from Pomona. He was raw, but very sincere and wholly unaffected. He stood before me, voice a little tight from nervousness, and read a scene from his favorite play... I was impressed and did all I could for him.&quot; He was eventually spotted by an MGM talent scout in 1932 after a production of &quot;Journey&#x27;s End.&quot;

==Career==
He signed a seven-year contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer with an initial salary of $35 per week, which rose to $2500 by 1936. The studio changed his name to Robert Taylor. He made his film debut in the 1934 comedy &quot;Handy Andy&quot;, starring Will Rogers (on loan to Fox Studios). 

His first leading role came by accident. In 1934, Taylor was on the MGM payroll as &quot;the test boy,&quot; a male juvenile who would be filmed opposite various young ingenues in screen tests. In late 1934, when MGM began production of its new short-subject series &quot;Crime Does Not Pay&quot; with the dramatic short &quot;Buried Loot&quot;, the actor who had been cast fell ill and could not appear. The director sent for the test boy to substitute for the missing actor. Taylor&#x27;s dramatic performance, as an embezzler who deliberately disfigures himself to avoid detection, was so memorable that Taylor immediately was signed for feature films.

In 1935, Irene Dunne requested him for her leading man in &quot;Magnificent Obsession&quot;. This was followed by &quot;Camille&quot; opposite Greta Garbo.

Throughout the late 1930s, Taylor appeared in films of varying genres including the musicals &quot;Broadway Melody of 1936&quot; and &quot;Broadway Melody of 1938&quot;, and the British comedy &quot;A Yank at Oxford&quot; with Vivien Leigh. Throughout 1940 and 1941 he argued in favor of American entry into World War II, and was sharply critical of the isolationist movement. During this time he said he was &quot;100% pro-British&quot;. In 1940, he reteamed with Leigh in Mervyn LeRoy&#x27;s drama &quot;Waterloo Bridge&quot;.

After being given the nickname &quot;The Man with the Perfect Profile&quot;, Taylor began breaking away from his perfect leading man image and began appearing in darker roles beginning in 1941. That year he played the title role in &quot;Billy the Kid&quot;, followed by the same the next year in the film noir &quot;Johnny Eager&quot; with Lana Turner. After playing a tough sergeant in &quot;Bataan&quot; in 1943, Taylor contributed to the war effort by becoming a flying instructor in the U.S. Naval Air Corps. During this time, he also starred in instructional films and narrated the 1944 documentary &quot;The Fighting Lady&quot;.

After the war, he appeared in a series of edgy roles, including the neo-noir &quot;Undercurrent&quot; (1946) and drama &quot;High Wall&quot; (1947). In 1949 he co-starred with Elizabeth Taylor in the suspense &quot;Conspirator&quot;, which Hedda Hopper described as &quot;another one of Taylor&#x27;s pro-British films&quot;. Taylor responded to this by saying &quot;And it won&#x27;t be the last!&quot; However, both Hopper and Taylor were members of the anticommunist organization the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals, as were Taylor&#x27;s friends John Wayne, Walt Disney and Gary Cooper. For this reason Hopper always spoke favorably of Taylor, despite him disagreeing with her over what she saw as his &quot;Anglophilia&quot; and what he saw as her &quot;Anglophobia&quot;. In 1950, Taylor landed the role of General Marcus Vinicius in &quot;Quo Vadis&quot; with Deborah Kerr. The epic film was a hit, grossing US$11 million in its first run. The following year, he starred in the film version of Walter Scott&#x27;s classic &quot;Ivanhoe&quot;, followed by 1953&#x27;s &quot;Knights of the Round Table&quot; and &quot;The Adventures of Quentin Durward&quot;, all filmed in England. Of the three only &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; was a critical and financial success. Taylor also filmed &quot;Valley of the Kings&quot; in Egypt in 1954. Robert Taylor received the 1953 World Film Favorite–Male, award at the Golden Globes (tied with Alan Ladd).

By the mid-1950s, Taylor began to concentrate on westerns, his preferred genre. He starred in a comedy western &quot;Many Rivers to Cross&quot; in 1955 co-starring Eleanor Parker. Taylor shared the lead with Richard Widmark in the edgy John Sturges western &quot;The Law and Jake Wade&quot; (1958). Taylor&#x27;s long tenure at MGM ended in 1959; he was the last remaining major star under contract from the studio&#x27;s heyday. The studio still held an option for Taylor&#x27;s services, which it exercised for the western &quot;Cattle King&quot;, released in 1963.

Taylor formed his own company, Robert Taylor Productions, starring in the television series &quot;The Detectives Starring Robert Taylor&quot; (1959–1962). Following the end of the series in 1962, Taylor continued to appear in films and television shows, including &quot;A House Is Not a Home&quot;, and two episodes of &quot;Hondo&quot;.

In 1964, Taylor co-starred with his former wife Barbara Stanwyck in William Castle&#x27;s psychological horror film &quot;The Night Walker&quot;. In 1965, after filming &quot;Johnny Tiger&quot; in Florida, Taylor took over the role of narrator in the television series &quot;Death Valley Days&quot; when Ronald Reagan left to pursue a career in politics. Taylor would remain with the series until his death in 1969.

Taylor traveled to Europe to film &quot;Savage Pampas&quot; (1966), &quot;The Glass Sphinx&quot; (1967), and &quot;The Day the Hot Line Got Hot&quot; (1968).

==Personal life==
===Marriages and children===
After dating her for three years, Taylor married Barbara Stanwyck on May 14, 1939, in San Diego, California. Zeppo Marx&#x27;s wife, Marion, was Stanwyck&#x27;s matron of honor. Stanwyck&#x27;s surrogate father—he was her sister Millie&#x27;s husband—and personal assistant, vaudevillian Buck Mack, was Taylor&#x27;s best man. Stanwyck divorced Taylor in February 1951. During the marriage, Stanwyck&#x27;s adopted son from her previous marriage to Frank Fay, Anthony &quot;Tony&quot; Dion, lived with them. After the divorce, Stanwyck retained custody of the child.

Taylor met German actress Ursula Thiess in 1952. They married in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, on May 23, 1954. They had two children, a son, Terrance, (1955) and a daughter, Tessa, (1959). Taylor was stepfather to Thiess&#x27; two children from her previous marriage, Manuela and Michael Thiess. On May 26, 1969, shortly before Taylor&#x27;s death from lung cancer, Ursula Thiess found the body of her son, Michael, in a West Los Angeles motel room. He died from a drug overdose. One month before his death, Michael had been released from a mental hospital. In 1964, he spent a year in a reformatory for attempting to poison his father with insecticide.

=== Politics ===

In February 1944, Taylor helped found the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals. In October 1947, Taylor was called to testify before the House Committee on Un-American Activities regarding Communism in Hollywood. He did this reluctantly, regarding the hearings as a &quot;circus&quot; and refusing to appear unless subpoenaed. In his testimony concerning the Screen Actors Guild (SAG), delivered on October 22, 1947, Taylor stated: &quot;It seems to me that at meetings, especially meetings of the general membership of the Guild, there was always a certain group of actors and actresses whose every action would indicate to me that, if they are not Communists, they are working awfully hard to be Communists.&quot; Two people already under investigation by the FBI, Karen Morley and Howard Da Silva, were mentioned as troublemakers at SAG meetings. Taylor alleged that at meetings of the SAG, Da Silva &quot;always had something to say at the wrong time.&quot; Da Silva was blacklisted on Broadway and New York radio, and Morley never worked again after her name surfaced at the hearings. Taylor went on to declare that he would refuse to work with anyone who was suspected of being a Communist: &quot;I&#x27;m afraid it would have to be him or me because life is too short to be around people who annoy me as much as these fellow-travelers and Communists do&quot;. Taylor also labeled screenwriter Lester Cole &quot;reputedly a Communist&quot;, adding &quot;I would not know personally&quot;. After the hearings, Taylor&#x27;s films were banned in Communist Hungary and in Czechoslovakia, and Communists called for a boycott of his films in France. 

In 1951, Taylor remarked &quot;I speak out against communism now for the same reason I spoke out against Nazism a decade ago, because I am pro-freedom and pro-decency.&quot; He helped narrate the 1952 anticommunist public service documentary &quot;The Hoaxters,&quot; which compared the threat of international communism in the 1950s to the threat of Nazism in the 1930s and 1940s.

Taylor supported Barry Goldwater in the 1964 United States presidential election and Ronald Reagan in the 1966 California gubernatorial election.

===Flying===
In 1952, Taylor starred in the film &quot;Above and Beyond&quot;, a biopic of Enola Gay pilot Paul Tibbets. The two men met and found that they had much in common. Both had considered studying medicine, and were avid skeet-shooters and fliers. Taylor learned to fly in the mid-1930s, and served as a United States Navy flying instructor during World War II. His private aircraft was a Twin Beech called &quot;Missy&quot; (his then-wife Stanwyck&#x27;s nickname) which he used on hunting and fishing trips and to fly to locations for filming.

===Ranch===
Taylor owned a 34-room house situated on located in Mandeville Canyon in the Brentwood section of Los Angeles. Dubbed the Robert Taylor Ranch, the property was sold to KROQ-FM owner Ken Roberts in the 1970s. Roberts remodeled the home and put it back on the market in 1990 for $45 million. He later reduced the price to $35 million, but the ranch failed to attract a buyer. In 2010, the ranch was seized by New Stream Capital, a hedge fund, after Roberts failed to repay a high interest loan he had taken from them.

In November 2012, the Robert Taylor Ranch was put up for auction by the trust that owned it. It was purchased for $12 million by a Chicago buyer in December 2012.

==Death==
In October 1968, Taylor underwent surgery to remove a portion of his right lung after doctors suspected that he had contracted coccidioidomycosis (known as &quot;valley fever&quot;). During the surgery, doctors discovered that he had lung cancer. Taylor, who had smoked three packs of cigarettes a day since he was a boy, quit smoking shortly before undergoing surgery. During the final months of his life, he was hospitalized seven times due to infections and complications related to the disease. He died of lung cancer on June 8, 1969, at Saint John&#x27;s Health Center in Santa Monica, California.

Taylor&#x27;s funeral was held at Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery, in Glendale, California. Long-time friend Ronald Reagan (who was then the governor of California) eulogized Taylor. Among the mourners were Robert Stack, Van Heflin, Eva Marie Saint, Walter Pidgeon, Keenan Wynn, Mickey Rooney, George Murphy, Audrey Totter and Taylor&#x27;s former wife Barbara Stanwyck.

For his contribution to the motion picture industry, Robert Taylor has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1500 Vine Street.

<doc id="318004" wikidata="Q2341317" url="?curid=318004" title="John Randolph of Roanoke">
<text>John Randolph (June 2, 1773May 24, 1833), commonly known as John Randolph of Roanoke, was an American planter, and a politician from Virginia, serving in the House of Representatives at various times between 1799 and 1833, and the Senate from 1825 to 1827. He was also Minister to Russia under Andrew Jackson in 1830. After serving as President Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s spokesman in the House, he broke with the president in 1805 as a result of what he saw as the dilution of traditional Jeffersonian principles as well as perceived mistreatment during the impeachment of Samuel Chase, in which Randolph served as chief prosecutor. Following this split, Randolph proclaimed himself the leader of the &quot;Old Republicans&quot; or &quot;Tertium Quids&quot;, a wing of the Democratic-Republican Party who wanted to restrict the role of the federal government. Specifically, Randolph promoted the Principles of &#x27;98, which said that individual states could judge the constitutionality of central government laws and decrees, and could refuse to enforce laws deemed unconstitutional.

Described as a quick-thinking orator with a remarkable wit, he was committed to republicanism and advocated a commercial agrarian society throughout his three decades in Congress. Randolph &quot;attracted great attention from the severity of his invectives, the piquancy of his sarcasms, the piercing intonation of his voice and his peculiarly expressive gesticulation.&quot; Randolph&#x27;s conservative stance, displayed in his arguments against debt and for the rights of the landed, slaveholding gentry, have been attributed to his ties to his family estate and the elitist values of his native Southside Virginia. His belief in the importance of a landed gentry led him to oppose the abolition of entail and primogeniture: &quot;The old families of Virginia will form connections with low people, and sink into the mass of overseers&#x27; sons and daughters&quot;. Randolph vehemently opposed the War of 1812 and the Missouri Compromise of 1820; he was active in debates about tariffs, manufacturing, and currency. With mixed feelings about slavery, he was one of the founders of the American Colonization Society in 1816, to send free blacks to a colony in Africa. At the same time, he believed that slavery was a necessity in Virginia, saying, &quot;The question of slavery, as it is called, is to us a question of life and death ... You will find no instance in history where two distinct races have occupied the soil except in the relation of master and slave.&quot; In addition, Randolph remained dependent on hundreds of slaves to work his tobacco plantation. However, he provided for their manumission and resettlement in the free state of Ohio in his will, providing money for the purchase of land and supplies. They founded Rossville, now part of Piqua, Ohio and Rumley, Ohio.

His supporters admired Randolph&#x27;s fiery character, and education was one of his passions. On the other hand, others, particularly northern advocates of democracy, mocked Randolph for his eccentricities discussed below, as did many Virginians including Thomas Jefferson. He applied rousing methods in electioneering, which he also enjoyed as a hobby. Randolph appealed directly to yeomen, using entertaining and enlightening oratory, sociability, and community of interest, particularly in agriculture. This resulted in an enduring voter attachment to him. His defense of limited government appeals to modern and contemporary conservatives, most notably Russell Kirk, who wrote an influential monograph on Randolph.

==Early life and education==
Randolph was born at Cawsons (now in Hopewell) in the Colony of Virginia, the son of rich tobacco planter John Randolph (1742–1775) and Frances Bland (1744–1788). His families, the Randolph family of Virginia and the Bland family of Virginia, are both among the prominent First Families of Virginia and often intermarried. His grandfathers were Richard Randolph and Theodorick Bland of Cawsons, who were, respectively, the son and grandson of William Randolph and Mary Isham of Turkey Island. He was the first cousin once removed of both Richard Bland and Peyton Randolph, the two pillars of the First Continental Congress, the nephew of Congressman Theodorick Bland and stepnephew of Thomas Tudor Tucker, a half brother of Henry St. George Tucker, Sr. and Nathaniel Beverley Tucker, and a second cousin of Thomas Jefferson. Jefferson&#x27;s mother was the daughter of Isham Randolph of Dungeness.

His father died in 1775, when he (the youngest of three brothers, and ultimately the longest-lived) was two years old. Their mother managed the family plantations and waited to remarry until 1778, when she wed St. George Tucker, the son of a prominent planter in Bermuda (where he later took his stepsons to recover their health), who had traveled to Virginia to study law under George Wythe in Williamsburg, was admitted to the Virginia bar in 1774, became well-regarded in his profession (including teaching law at the College of William and Mary) and would become a judge of what later became the Virginia Supreme Court in 1804. His maternal fourth great-grandfather was Richard Bennett of Virginia, elected governor of Virginia colony during the Cromwell Protectorate and a Puritan who in 1672 was converted to the Quaker movement by George Fox.

===Health issues===
A genetic aberration — possibly Klinefelter syndrome — left him beardless and with a soprano prepubescent voice throughout his life.
Modern science has established that latent pulmonary tuberculosis can sometimes settle in the genital tract and can cause the symptoms and permanent damage that would prevent the onset of puberty. Randolph&#x27;s brother died of tuberculosis, and it appears that Randolph contracted it as a youth and never went through puberty. He finally died of tuberculosis at age 60, after it broke out into the open. He began to use opium as a way to deal with the extreme pain caused by his lifelong battle with tuberculosis. Contemporary accounts attest to his having had a belligerent and bellicose personality before the onset of any disease.
===Education===
First studying under private tutors, Randolph attended Walker Maury&#x27;s private school. After one of his brothers was disciplined, the Randolph brothers beat Maury and left the boarding school without completing their studies. Their stepfather then sent them to College of New Jersey, and Columbia College, New York City. The Randolph brothers neglected their studies and spent much time in taverns. After failing their courses and running out of money, they returned to Virginia. John later studied law in Philadelphia under his cousin Edmund Randolph, but never practiced. In 1792, his family&#x27;s wealth and influence gained him admission to William and Mary College in Williamsburg, Virginia. Convinced that his pronunciations of words were the only correct ones, he insulted fellow student Robert B. for allegedly mispronouncing a word. Randolph refused to apologize and a duel ensued. Randolph soon after left William and Mary, thus ending his formal education.

==Political career==

In 1798, at the unusually young age of 26, Randolph was elected to the 6th United States Congress. It was said that Randolph&#x27;s youthful appearance prompted the Speaker of the House, Theodore Sedgwick, to ask Randolph whether he was old enough to be eligible, but that Randolph&#x27;s reply — &quot;Ask my constituents&quot; — disinclined Sedgwick to pursue the question further. Randolph was re-elected to the six succeeding Congresses, and served from 1799 to 1813. Even though he frequently criticized slavery, he devoted much of his congressional career to defending slavery and Virginia&#x27;s class of wealthy slaveholders. Randolph also insisted that abolition would be worse for both enslaved blacks and whites. Indeed, Randolph lionized Virginia&#x27;s wealthy slaveholding class as the rightful rulers of Virginia and the United States, and had great disdain for democracy and the advocates of more democratic government in Virginia and the Union.

Federalist William Plumer of New Hampshire wrote in 1803 of his striking presence:
Mr. Randolph goes to the House booted and spurred, with his whip in hand, in imitation, it is said, of members of the British Parliament. He is a very slight man but of the common stature. At a little distance, he does not appear older than you are; but, upon a nearer approach, you perceive his wrinkles and grey hairs. He is, I believe, about thirty. He is a descendant in the right line from the celebrated Indian Princess, Pochahontas. The Federalists ridicule and affect to despise him; but a despised foe often proves a dangerous enemy. His talents are certainly far above mediocrity. As a popular speaker, he is not inferior to any man in the House. I admire his ingenuity and address; but I dislike his politics.

Randolph was chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means in the Seventh through the Ninth Congresses, acting as the Democratic-Republican Party leader. In 1804, Randolph proposed the ill-fated Mobile Act, which implicitly allowed the President to claim parts of Spanish West Florida for the US. The Act was passed, and Jefferson tried to act on it, but Spain objected vehemently. Jefferson backed down and threw blame on Randolph.

After this, Randolph broke with Jefferson (his cousin). In 1806, Randolph founded the &quot;Tertium quids&quot; (Latin for &quot;Third things&quot;, i.e. neither pro-Jefferson nor Federalist), a breakaway faction of the Democratic-Republican Party. They called for a return to the Principles of 1798 and renounced what it saw as creeping nationalism. The Tertium Quids believed that wealthy slaveholders like themselves were the rightful rulers of Virginia and the nation, and that any movement towards greater democracy would undermine the power and authority of Virginia&#x27;s slaveholding class.

Although he greatly admired the political ideals of the Revolutionary War generation, Randolph, influenced by Southern anti-Federalism, propounded a version of republicanism that called for the traditional patriarchal society of Virginia&#x27;s elite slaveholding gentry to preserve social stability with minimal government interference. Randolph was one of the House managers who successfully prosecuted the impeachment trial of John Pickering, judge of the United States District Court for New Hampshire, in January 1804.

Randolph was also a central proponent of impeaching Supreme Court Associate Justice Samuel Chase. Later that same year, Chase was impeached but acquitted. Randolph again served as a House manager, and critics complained that he mismanaged the prosecution.

In June 1807, Randolph was the foreman of the grand jury in Richmond, which was considering the indictment of Aaron Burr and others for treason. By the end of the review, he was angry with Thomas Jefferson for supporting General James Wilkinson, Burr&#x27;s chief accuser. He considered Wilkinson less than a reputable and honorable person.

Defeated for re-election in 1812 due to his opposition to the War of 1812, Randolph was elected in 1814 and 1816. He skipped a term, then was again elected and served from 1819 until his resignation in 1825. During the Missouri Crisis, Randolph emerged as an outspoken defender of the slaveholding gentry and a critic of democracy, even though he repeatedly insisted that he hated slavery.

Randolph was asked to be the Democratic-Republican Party candidate for president in the 1824 presidential election. He declined this offer; the election was won by John Quincy Adams.

Randolph was appointed to the Senate in December 1825 to fill a vacancy, and he served until 1827. During his time in the Senate, his pro-Adams colleagues, annoyed by the bitterness of his invective, sometimes foreshortened his speeches &quot;by severally quitting their seats when he was speaking to an extent sufficient to leave the Senate without a quorum.&quot;

In 1825, he spoke for several days in opposition to a series of measures proposed by President Adams. Randolph argued these measures would give advantage to the emerging industrial powers of New England at the expense of the Southern states. This series of speeches was the first Senate filibuster.

With his Senate term ending, Randolph did not seek re-election. Instead he was again elected US Representative in 1826, and again became Chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means.

John Randolph offered many pro-slavery speeches over his long career in Congress. He mocked universal emancipation as an unreliable fantasy. Speaking about Cuba, Randolph said &quot;It is unquestionable but this invasion will be made with this principle – this genius of universal emancipation – the sweeping anathema against the white population... And then, sir, what is the position of the southern United States?&quot; If we should accede, &quot;we should deserve to have negroes for our taskmasters, and for the husbands of our wives.&quot;

Randolph retired from the US House in 1828. He was a member of the Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1829-1830 as a delegate from Charlotte County. He was appointed United States Minister to Russia by President Andrew Jackson and served from May to September 1830, when he resigned for health reasons. In 1832, he was again elected US Representative, and served until his death in 1833.

==Death, legacy and honors==
He died in Philadelphia on May 24, 1833. He never married. Randolph is buried Hollywood Cemetery, Richmond, Virginia. His Virginia home, Roanoke Plantation, remains standing today, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.

*Randolph was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1815.

A modern conservative political group, the John Randolph Club, is named after Randolph. His defense of limited government appeals to modern and contemporary conservatives, most notably Russell Kirk (1918–1994).

Places named in his honor include: 
*Randolph-Macon College and Randolph College.
*Randolph County, Arkansas, Randolph County, Georgia and Randolph County, Missouri
*The World War II Liberty Ship 
*Randolph-Henry High School, in Charlotte Court House, Virginia was named in his, and Patrick Henry&#x27;s honor. Established 1938.

==Personality, eccentricity and outsider status==
Despite being a Virginia gentleman, one of the great orators in the history of Caroline, and House leader, Randolph after five years of leadership became, by 1803, a permanent outsider. His personal eccentricities may have been made worse by his lifelong ill health (he died of tuberculosis), heavy drinking, and occasional use of opium. According to Bill Kauffman, Randolph was &quot;a habitual opium user [and] a bachelor who seems to have nurtured a crush on Andrew Jackson.&quot;

John Greenleaf Whittier&#x27;s poem &quot;Randolph of Roanoke,&quot; written after the Virginian had become a symbol of &quot;slave power,&quot; may capture his strange brilliance:
:Mirth, sparkling like a diamond shower,
:From lips of lifelong sadness;
:Clear picturings of majestic thought
:Upon a ground of madness
:While others hailed in distant skies
:Our eagle&#x27;s dusky pinion,
:He only saw the mountain bird
:Stoop o&#x27;er his Old Dominion!
:All parties feared him; each in turn
:Beheld its schemes disjointed,
:At right or left his fatal glance
:And spectral finger pointed.
In March 1826, Randolph made a Senate speech in which he described the arrangement by which John Quincy Adams became president in 1825 and Henry Clay became Adams&#x27;s Secretary of State as the actions of the &quot;puritan (Adams) with the blackleg (Clay)&quot;. Clay was under the impression that Randolph had waived congressional immunity before his speech; insulted by Randolph&#x27;s description of him, he challenged Randolph to a duel. Randolph had in fact not waived immunity, but rather than appear dishonorable by making this known, he accepted Clay&#x27;s challenge. During the preliminary activities, Randolph asserted that Clay had no right to issue a challenge over political remarks made on the U.S. Senate floor. Because of this view, Randolph announced his intention not to fire at Clay. On April 8, they met on the Virginia side of the Potomac River. During their first volley, Randolph shot wildly and Clay missed. During their second, Randolph fired into the air, clearly signalling that he would not participate. Clay then ended the duel by approaching Randolph and expressing hope that Randolph was uninjured. Clay&#x27;s bullet had torn Randolph&#x27;s outer clothing, and he replied good-naturedly &quot;You owe me a coat, Mr. Clay&quot;. Civil relations between Randolph and Clay were restored. As Martin Van Buren later wrote:
Except for this incident, Randolph generally saved his bellicosity for the floor of Congress. He routinely dressed in a flashy manner, often accompanied by his slaves and his hunting dogs. &quot;[W]hen Clay had set about making the speakership a position of true power upon his first election to that post in 1811, he had unceremoniously ordered Randolph to remove his dog from the House floor—something no previous Speaker had dared to do.&quot;

Randolph had an intense dislike for Rep. Willis Alston and had a pitched fight with him in a Washington boarding house. Heated words led to the two throwing tableware at each other. Six years later, they fought again in a stairwell at the House after Alston loudly referred to Randolph as a &quot;puppy&quot;. Randolph beat Alston bloody with his cane and the two had to be separated by other congressmen. Randolph was fined $20 for this breach of the peace.

Nonetheless, Randolph maintained many friendships which crossed political party lines. As an example, he remained close with Federalist Congressman Harmanus Bleecker of Albany, New York. Bleecker and Randolph exchanged portraits as a token of their mutual esteem, and each displayed in his home the portrait of the other.

===Religious conversion===
Randolph was raised and remained within the Episcopal Church. Although he went through a phase of youthful irreligion, in 1818 he had a crisis ending in a conversion experience, which he recounted in letters to several friends.

Randolph&#x27;s life thereafter was marked with piety. For example, he wrote to John Brockenbrough that he was restrained from taking communion &quot;by the fear of eating and drinking unrighteously.&quot; Thus, the executors of Randolph&#x27;s last will and testament (described below) included Virginia&#x27;s bishop, William Meade (who had freed his slaves years earlier, but would by the end of his life during the American Civil War become a defender of the &quot;peculiar institution&quot;).

===Slavery===

Together with Justice Bushrod Washington and his former student Henry Clay, Randolph was among the founders of the American Colonization Society (ACS) in 1816. It began as a collaboration of slaveholders and abolitionists that planned to transport and resettle free blacks in a colony in Africa (this territory became Liberia). Like some other slaveholders, Randolph had long been opposed to slavery in theory. Also, his eldest brother, Richard Randolph, had freed slaves in his will, and his widow Judith fought to implement that provision, which led to the founding of the free black community of Israel Hill on the former Randolph estate in Prince Edward County, Virginia. In the two decades after the Revolutionary War, so many planters freed slaves that the proportion of free blacks in Virginia increased from less than one percent in 1782 to 13.5 percent in 1810.

Nearly two decades after Richard&#x27;s death, in 1819, John Randolph also wrote a will providing for the manumission of his slaves after his death. He wrote, &quot;I give and bequeath to all my slaves their freedom, heartily regretting that I have ever been the owner of one.&quot; The will made provision for settling the manumitted slaves on their own land in free territory (since these freed men unlike Richard&#x27;s could not date their freedom before Virginia&#x27;s law requiring freed blacks to leave the Commonwealth). Another will made in 1821 provided that each slave above the age of 40 was to receive of land. Although the will was challenged in the courts, his slaves were ultimately ruled to be free. In 1846, 383 former &quot;Randolph Slaves&quot; arrived in Cincinnati. Local farmers in the Ohio county where Randolph&#x27;s executor had purchased 3200 acres for them prevented the freedpeople from settling there. Many of them ultimately settled in Miami and Shelby Counties at places such as Rossville near Piqua, Ohio, of which only the community cemetery remains.

<doc id="318006" wikidata="Q5768318" url="?curid=318006" title="Hippie Hollow Park">
<text>Hippie Hollow Park (originally known as McGregor County Park) is a park located on the shore of Lake Travis in northwest Austin. It is the only legally recognized clothing-optional public park in the State of Texas. Though the land is owned by the Lower Colorado River Authority, it is leased to Travis County, whose Parks Department has administered the park since 1985. Sometimes erroneously labeled as a beach, the park actually sits on a somewhat steep slope above Lake Travis with limestone steps that can be quite rugged in some spots. Depending on the water level of the lake, access to the water may require some rock climbing.

==History==
Hippie Hollow Park has been used as a nude swimming spot for years, because the area was along a particularly remote section of the shoreline of Lake Travis. The area became more popular in the 1960s due to the cultural changes of that era and, after Woodstock, the nickname &#x27;Hippie Hollow&#x27; was born. Hippie Hollow was controversial in the 1970s, due to increased skinny-dipping which generated complaints from adjacent landowners. Raymond Frank, the sheriff of Travis County from 1973 to 1980, determined that the county&#x27;s law enforcement budget was better spent on more serious offenses, and skinny-dipping activities were generally ignored as long as no other laws were being broken.

In October 1983 the park site was leased to Travis County, and in October 1985 Hippie Hollow Park opened to visitors after some modest improvements and an extensive site clean-up by the county, replacing the former name of McGregor Park. The park continues as a clothing optional park, with appropriate signage at the park entrance advising visitors that nude swimming and sunbathing may be encountered. At one time the park was frequented by families, but many objected. On July 11, 1995, the county commissioners passed an ordinance restricting park usage to those over 18 years of age, as a result of Travis County Attorney Ken Oden&#x27;s interpretation of nudity laws.

This ordinance was challenged in court by the Central Texas Nudists headed by Bob and Christine Morton, who, along with other naturist families, had been bringing their children to the site for years without incident. Part of Morton&#x27;s argument was that the Texas Hill Country had been settled by many German and Czech immigrants in the middle-19th century, and nude sunbathing had been a part of their culture. An appeals court ruled in favor of the county in 1999, and the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear the case (&quot;Central Texas Nudists vs. Travis County&quot;) in October 2001. Hippie Hollow remains clothing optional, but with park usage restricted to those over 18.

In 2004, a rented double-decker party barge carrying 60 people capsized and sank in front of Hippie Hollow when the passengers on board gathered on one side of the barge. The incident, which caused two minor injuries, occurred during Splash Day, a semiannual event hosted by Austin&#x27;s gay and lesbian bar association.

<doc id="318009" wikidata="Q966565" url="?curid=318009" title="Tex Ritter">
<text>Woodward Maurice&quot;Tex&quot;Ritter (January 12, 1905 – January 2, 1974) was a pioneer of American country music singer and actor from the mid-1930s into the 1960s. He was the patriarch of the Ritter acting family (son John Ritter, grandsons Jason Ritter and Tyler Ritter, and granddaughter Carly). He is a member of the Country Music Hall of Fame.

== Early life ==
Woodward Maurice Ritter was born on January 12, 1905, in Murvaul, Texas, to Martha Elizabeth (&quot;née&quot; Matthews) and James Everett Ritter. He grew up on his family&#x27;s farm in Panola County, Texas, and attended grade school in Carthage, Texas. He attended South Park High School in Beaumont, Texas. After graduating with honors, he entered the University of Texas at Austin in 1922 to study pre-law and major in government, political science, and economics. After traveling to Chicago with a musical troupe, he entered Northwestern Law School.

== Career ==
=== Radio and Broadway ===
An early pioneer of country music, Ritter soon became interested in show business. In 1928, he sang on KPRC in Houston, Texas, a 30-minute program of mostly cowboy songs. That same year, he moved to New York City and landed a job in the men&#x27;s chorus of the Broadway show &quot;The New Moon&quot; (1928). He appeared as cowboy Cord Elam in the Broadway production &quot;Green Grow the Lilacs&quot; (1931), the basis for the musical &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; He also played the part of Sagebrush Charlie in &quot;The Round Up&quot; (1932) and &quot;Mother Lode&quot; (1934).

In 1932, he starred in New York City&#x27;s first broadcast Western, &quot;The Lone Star Rangers&quot; on WOR, where he sang and told tales of the Old West. Ritter wrote and starred in &quot;Cowboy Tom&#x27;s Roundup&quot; on WINS in 1933, a daily children&#x27;s cowboy program aired over two other East Coast stations for three years. He also performed on the radio show &quot;WHN Barndance&quot; and sang on NBC Radio shows; and appeared in several radio dramas, including CBS&#x27;s &quot;Bobby Benson&#x27;s Adventures&quot;.

=== Movies ===
In 1936, Ritter moved to Los Angeles. His motion picture debut was in &quot;Song of the Gringo&quot; (1936) for Grand National Pictures. He went on to appear in 70 movies as an actor, and 76 on movie soundtracks. He attracted special attention in 1952 for his rendition of &quot;The Ballad of High Noon&quot; over the opening credits of the celebrated film &quot;High Noon&quot;, and later sang it at that year&#x27;s Academy Awards ceremony, where it won Best Original Song.

=== Recording ===
Ritter&#x27;s recording career was his most successful period. He was the first artist signed with the newly formed Capitol Records in 1942.

In 1944, he scored a hit with &quot;I&#x27;m Wastin&#x27; My Tears on You&quot;, which hit number one on the country chart and number 11 on the pop chart. An article in the trade publication &quot;Billboard&quot; noted 14 years later that with that song, he &quot;reached the style of rhythmic tune that would assure his musical stature&quot;.

In 1952 Ritter recorded &quot;The Ballad of High Noon&quot; for the film &quot;High Noon&quot;. He performed the track at the first televised Academy Awards ceremony in 1953, and it received an Oscar for Best Song that year.

=== Television ===
When television began to compete with movies for American audiences, Ritter began to make appearances on the new medium following 71 straight movie appearances. In 1953, he began performing on &quot;Town Hall Party&quot; on radio and television in Los Angeles. In 1957, he co-hosted &quot;Ranch Party&quot;, a syndicated version of the show. He made his national TV debut in 1955 on ABC-TV&#x27;s &quot;Ozark Jubilee&quot; and was one of five rotating hosts for its 1961 NBC-TV spin-off, &quot;Five Star Jubilee&quot;.

=== Later work ===
Ritter became one of the founding members of the Country Music Association in Nashville, Tennessee, and spearheaded the effort to build the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum into which he was inducted in 1964.

He moved to Nashville in 1965 and began working for radio station WSM and the Grand Ole Opry, earning a lifetime membership in the latter in 1970.

== Senate campaign ==
In 1970, Ritter entered Tennessee&#x27;s Republican primary election for United States Senate. Despite high name recognition, he lost the nomination to United States Representative Bill Brock, who then defeated the incumbent Senator Albert Gore, Sr. in the general election.

== Personal life ==
Tex Ritter married movie actress Dorothy Fay on June 14, 1941. They raised their two sons in Los Angeles and then he and Dorothy moved to Nashville, Tennessee in 1965, as Tex wasn&#x27;t acting and was solely focused on singing &amp; recording. He died of a heart attack in Nashville on January 2, 1974, at age 68. He was survived by Dorothy and their two sons, Tom and John. In a few years, John became famous as an actor, playing Jack Tripper on the ABC sitcom &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot; (1977–1984). In 2003, John died, at the age of 54, of an aortic dissection. Because John was initially diagnosed as having a heart attack, and because aortic dissection is known to be hereditary, the family now believes that Tex died of an aortic dissection rather than a heart attack.

== Legacy ==
For his contribution to the recording industry, Ritter has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6631 Hollywood Boulevard. In 1980, he was inducted into the Western Performers Hall of Fame at the National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. He was a member of the charter group of inductees into the Texas Country Music Hall of Fame in Carthage, in 1998.

In 1986, Ritter was honored posthumously with a Golden Boot Award for his work in Western films.

Ritter can still be heard as the voice of Big Al, an audio-animatronic bear, at Disney theme park attraction Country Bear Jamboree at Tokyo Disneyland in Urayasu, Chiba, Japan, and formerly at the Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World and Disneyland in Anaheim, California.

<doc id="318014" wikidata="Q1385667" url="?curid=318014" title="Eyam">
<text>Eyam () is an English village and civil parish in the Derbyshire Dales that lies within the Peak District National Park. There is evidence of early occupation by Ancient Britons on the surrounding moors and lead was mined in the area by the Romans. A settlement was founded on the present site by Anglo-Saxons, when mining was continued and other industries later developed. However, Eyam’s main claim to fame is the story of how the village chose to go into isolation so as to prevent infection spreading after bubonic plague was discovered there in 1665.

In the later 20th century, the village&#x27;s sources of livelihood largely disappeared. The local economy now relies on the tourist trade, with Eyam being promoted as &quot;the plague village&quot;. Although the story has been kept alive by a growing number of literary works since the early 19th century, its truth has been questioned.

==Governance==
Eyam has its own Parish Council with a wide range of powers at community level. At district level, Eyam has representation on Derbyshire Dales District Council and this, in turn, is represented on Derbyshire County Council. At parliamentary level, the village lies within the constituency of Derbyshire Dales.

==History==
Lead mining seems to have had a continuous history in the Eyam district since at least the Roman era and there is evidence of habitation from earlier. Stone circles and earth barrows on the moors above the present village have largely been destroyed, although some remain and more are recorded. The most notable site is the Wet Withens stone circle on Eyam Moor. Coins bearing the names of many emperors provide evidence of Roman lead-mining locally. However, the village&#x27;s name derives from Old English and is first recorded in the Domesday Book as . It is a dative form of the noun (&#x27;an island&#x27;) and probably refers to a patch of cultivable land amidst the moors, or else to the settlement&#x27;s situation between two brooks.
In the churchyard is an Anglo-Saxon cross in Mercian style dated to the 8th century, moved there from its original location beside a moorland cart track. Grade I listed and a Scheduled Monument, it is covered in complex carvings and is almost complete, but for a missing section of the shaft.

The present parish church of St. Lawrence dates from the 14th century, but evidence of an earlier church there can be found in the Saxon font, a Norman window at the west end of the north aisle, and Norman pillars that are thought to rest on Saxon foundations. There have been alterations since the Middle Ages, including a large sundial dated 1775 mounted on a wall outside. Some of the rectors at the church have had contentious histories, none less than the fanatically Royalist Sherland Adams who, it was accused, &quot;gave tythe of lead ore to the King against the Parliament&quot;, and as a consequence was removed from the and imprisoned.

The lead mining tithe was due to the rectors by ancient custom. They received one penny for every &#x27;dish&#x27; of ore and twopence farthing for every load of hillock-stuff. Owing to the working of a newly discovered rich vein during the 18th century, the Eyam living was a valuable one. Mining continued into the 19th century, after which better sources were discovered and a change-over was made to the working and treatment of fluorspar as a slagging agent in smelting. The last to close was the Ladywash Mine, which was operative between 1948 and 1979. Within a 3-mile radius of the village there are 439 known mines (some running beneath the village itself), drained by 49 drainage levels (&#x27;soughs&#x27;).

According to the 1841 Census for Eyam, there were 954 inhabitants living in the parish, chiefly employed in agriculture, lead mining, and cotton and silk weaving. By the 1881 Census, most men either worked as lead miners or in the manufacture of boots and shoes, a trade that only ended in the 1960s. The transition from industrial village to tourist-based economy is underlined by Roger Ridgeway&#x27;s statement that, at the beginning of the 20th century, &quot;a hundred horses and carts would have been seen taking fluorspar to Grindleford and Hassop stations. Until recently, up to a dozen coach loads of visiting children arrived each day in the village,&quot; and as of the 2011 Census the population has remained largely unchanged at 969.

==1665 plague outbreak==
The history of the plague in the village began in 1665 when a flea-infested bundle of cloth arrived from London
for Alexander Hadfield, the local tailor. Within a week his assistant George Viccars, noticing the bundle was damp, had opened it up. Before long he was dead and more began dying in the household soon after.

As the disease spread, the villagers turned for leadership to their rector, the Reverend William Mompesson, and the ejected Puritan minister Thomas Stanley. They introduced a number of precautions to slow the spread of the illness from May 1666. The measures included the arrangement that families were to bury their own dead and relocation of church services to the natural amphitheatre of Cucklett Delph, allowing villagers to separate themselves and so reducing the risk of infection. Perhaps the best-known decision was to quarantine the entire village to prevent further spread of the disease. Merchants from surrounding villages sent supplies that they would leave on marked rocks; the villagers then made holes there which they would fill with vinegar to disinfect the money left as payment.

The plague ran its course over 14 months and one account states that it killed at least 260 villagers, with only 83 surviving out of a population of 350. That figure has been challenged, with alternative figures of 430 survivors from a population of around 800 being given. The church in Eyam has a record of 273 individuals who were victims of the plague.

Survival among those affected appeared random, as many who remained alive had close contact with those who died but never caught the disease. For example, Elizabeth Hancock was uninfected despite burying six children and her husband in eight days. The graves are known as the Riley graves after the farm where they lived. The unofficial village gravedigger, Marshall Howe, also survived, despite handling many infected bodies.

===Plague Sunday===
Plague Sunday has been celebrated in the village since the plague&#x27;s bicentenary in 1866. Originally held in mid-August, it now takes place in Cucklett Delph on the last Sunday in August, coinciding with the (much older) Wakes Week and well dressing ceremonies.

==Places of interest==

Today Eyam has many plague-related places of interest. One is the Boundary Stone in the fields between Eyam and Stoney Middleton in which money, usually soaked in vinegar, which was believed to kill the infection, was placed in exchange for food and medicine. It is just one of several &#x27;plague stones&#x27; marking the boundary that should not be crossed by either inhabitant or outsider. Another site is the isolated enclosure of the Riley graves mentioned above, now under the guardianship of the National Trust.

A reminder of the village&#x27;s industrial past remains in the name of its only pub, the Miner&#x27;s Arms. Built in 1630, before the plague, it was originally called The Kings Arms. Opposite the church is the Mechanics&#x27; Institute, originally established in 1824, although the present building with its pillared portico dates from 1859 and was enlarged in 1894. At one time, it held a library paid for by subscription, which then contained 766 volumes. The premises now double as the village club. Up the main street is the Jacobean-styled Eyam Hall, built just after the plague. It was leased and managed by the National Trust for five years until December 2017 but is now run by the owners (the Wright Family). The green opposite has an ancient set of village stocks reputedly used to punish the locals for minor crimes.

Catherine Mompesson&#x27;s tabletop grave is in the churchyard and has a wreath laid on it every Plague Sunday. This is in remembrance of her constancy in staying by her husband, rather than moving away with the rest of her family, and dying in the very last days of the plague. The church&#x27;s burial register also records &quot;Anna the traveller, who according to her own account, was 136 years of age&quot; and was interred on 30 December 1663. A more recent arrival there is the cricketer Harry Bagshaw, who played for Derbyshire and then acted as a respected umpire after retiring. At the apex of his headstone is a hand with a finger pointing upwards. Underneath the lettering a set of stumps is carved with a bat, and the bails flying off where a ball has just hit the wicket.

Respect for its heritage has not always been a priority in Eyam. In his &quot;Peak Scenery&quot; (1824), Ebenezer Rhodes charges that by the start of the 19th century many former gravestones of plague victims had been pulled up to floor houses and barns and that ploughing was allowed to encroach on the Riley Graves; that the lime trees planted on either side of Mrs Mompesson&#x27;s grave had been cut down for timber; that the missing piece from the shaft of the Saxon Cross had been broken up for domestic use; and that in general the profit of the living was put before respect for the dead.

Two brooks flow through the village, the Jumber Brook and Hollow Brook.

==Cultural representations==
===Paintings===
Eyam Museum was opened in 1994 and, besides its focus on the plague, includes exhibits on the village&#x27;s local history in general. Among the art exhibits there are painted copies from different eras of a print (taken from a drawing by Francis Chantrey) in Ebenezer Rhodes&#x27; &quot;Peak Scenery&quot; (1818). These depict the sweep of the road by the &#x27;plague cottages&#x27; where the first victims died, with the church tower beyond. The local amateur John Platt painted in naive style and is represented by depictions of the Riley Graves (1871) and the old windmill (1874).

Since the area is scenically beautiful it has attracted many artists, among whom one of the most notable was the Sheffield artist Harry Epworth Allen. The picturesque is subordinated in his paintings of Eyam so as to interpret his subject as a living community within a worked landscape. His &quot;Road above Eyam&quot; (1936), now in the Laing Art Gallery, is travelled by people going about their daily business, for example, and his &quot;Burning Limestone&quot; in Newport Museum and Art Gallery acknowledges the two centuries and more of industrialisation by which the local inhabitants earned their living among harsh conditions.

===Literature===

“The village of Eyam,&quot; its historian begins his account, &quot;has been long characterized throughout the Peak of Derbyshire, as the birthplace of genius – the seat of the Muses – the Athens of the Peak&quot;. During the 18th century the place was notable for having no fewer than four poets associated with it. Reverend Peter Cunningham, curate there between 1775 and 1790, published two sermons during that time as well as several poems of a political nature. In addition, William Wood&#x27;s account speaks of &quot;numberless stones in the burial place that contain the offerings of his muse&quot;.

The rector for whom Cunningham deputised much of the time, Thomas Seward, published infrequently, but at least one poem written during his tenure at Eyam deals with personal matters. His &quot;Ode on a Lady&#x27;s Illness after the Death of her Child&quot;, dated 14 April 1748, concerns the death in infancy of his daughter Jenny. Seward also encouraged one of his surviving daughters, Anna Seward, to write poetry, but only after she moved with her father to Lichfield. A pioneer of Romanticism, Seward could not hide from herself the fact that the wild natural rocks she admired were daily being blasted for utilitarian purposes and the &quot;perpetual consumption of the ever burning lime kilns&quot;, while the view was hidden behind the smoke from the smelting works. Following a visit to her birthplace in 1788, she wrote a poem about it filled with nostalgia. She celebrated this lost domain of happiness once more in &quot;Epistle to Mr. Newton, the Derbyshire Minstrel, on receiving his description in verse of an autumnal scene near Eyam, September 1791&quot;. No copy of the poem by William Newton now exists. The author was a labouring-class protégé from nearby, originally discovered by Cunningham and introduced to Miss Seward in 1783.

The poet Richard Furness belongs to the early 19th century and was known as &#x27;the Poet of Eyam&#x27; after his birthplace, but the bulk of his poetry too was written after he had left the district. Among the several references to the village there are his &quot;Lines written in sight of the rectory&quot;, which praises both Anna Seward and her father. William Wood, the author of &quot;The History and Antiquities of Eyam&quot;, was a village resident. At the head of his first chapter is an excerpt from a poem that links the place with the story of the plague. Simply initialled W. W., the inference to be drawn is that it had earlier appeared in Wood&#x27;s collection &quot;The genius of the Peak and other poems&quot; (1837). A later visitor from across the Peak District was Thomas Matthew Freeman, who included a blank verse meditation &quot;On Eyam&quot; and its plague history in his collection &quot;Spare minutes of a country parson&quot;. At the start of the following century Sarah Longsdon O&#x27;Ferrall was living at Eyam Rectory and published &quot;The Lamp of St Helen and other poems&quot; in 1912. This contained hymns sung on special occasions in Eyam and some verse referring to plague sites.

Prose writers also came to live in the area. The village of Milton that figures in some of Robert Murray Gilchrist&#x27;s fiction is in fact based upon Eyam. His &quot;The Peakland Faggot&quot; (1897) consists of short stories, each focusing on a particular character in the village. This was followed by two other series, &quot;Nicholas and Mary and Other Milton Folk&quot; (1899) and &quot;Natives of Milton&quot; (1902). Eyam was also featured under its own name in Joseph Hatton&#x27;s novel &quot;The Dagger and the Cross&quot; (1897). Set in the former Bradshaw Hall in the year before the plague arrives, it includes local characters who had key roles during the spread of the disease, such as George Vicars and William and Catherine Mompesson.

== Legacy ==
Some have questioned the details of the story of Eyam&#x27;s response to the plague and the wisdom of the actors in it. The reviewer of the poem &quot;The Tale of Eyam&quot; in the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; of 30 November 1889 comments on its poetic phraseology: &quot;The author speaks of the pestilence and &#x27;its hellborn brood&#x27;; and again of firebolts from &#x27;heaven&#x27;s reeking nostrils.&#x27; Such phraseology, says the unknown author, &quot;aptly exemplifies the mental attitude of men who lived in the infancy of modern science, when in the plague they saw the angry stroke of offended Deity, and recognised the &#x27;scourge&#x27; of God in what we know to be only the scourge of filth.&#x27; Shortly afterwards, writing in his &quot;A History of Epidemics in Britain&quot; (Cambridge University Press, 1891), Charles Creighton, while affirming the account of what happened, questioned the wisdom of the actions taken at the revival of the epidemic in 1666 as mistaken, though well-meaning. Instead, &quot;the villagers of Eyam were sacrificed...to an idea, and to an idea which we may now say was not scientifically sound,&quot; suggesting that they should have fled elsewhere as long as they didn&#x27;t gather together or take &quot;tainted&quot; articles with them.

A 2005 study of Eyam&#x27;s story as history claims it is no more than a literary construct fabricated long after the actual events. Contemporary reporting was rare and often the result of political or religious bias. From the dawn of the 19th century, the romanticised and sentimental accounts of events at Eyam were &quot;largely produced by poets, writers and local historians – not doctors&quot;, as is apparent from the dissenting opinions quoted above. The 1886 bicentenary commemoration, repeated annually for close on a century and a half, is claimed by the author to be the beginning of &quot;an overtly invented tradition&quot; which has spawned a heritage industry to profit the village in the face its declining prosperity and population, and provided instead &quot;a plague tourism infrastructure&quot;.

By contrast, the 2000 study led by Dr. Steve O&#x27;Brien suggested that a human gene mutation, CCR5-Delta 32, known to give immunity from HIV, may have helped the survivors at Eyam: &quot;the timing is right, the numbers are right...&quot; and their descendants had a higher than average percentage of the mutation. In addition the 2016 study by Drs. Didelot and Whittles acknowledged that Eyam was &quot;important because it gives us fantastic data for the plague.&quot; They found that human-to-human transmission was far greater than previously thought and that the village&#x27;s isolation did indeed help to stop the spread of the plague.

===Eyam Hypothesis===
The &quot;Eyam Hypothesis&quot; is a medical theory named after the village&#x27;s contribution to containing the spread of the plague through self-isolation. It has been proposed in the recent discussion over whether observed isolationary behaviour in sickness among vertebrates is the result of evolution or of altruism and still awaits validation.

<doc id="318019" wikidata="Q4006782" url="?curid=318019" title="Utopia, Limited">
<text>Utopia, Limited; or, The Flowers of Progress, is a Savoy opera, with music by Arthur Sullivan and libretto by W. S. Gilbert. It was the second-to-last of Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s fourteen collaborations, premiering on 7 October 1893 for a run of 245 performances. It did not achieve the success of most of their earlier productions.

Gilbert&#x27;s libretto satirises limited liability companies, and particularly the idea that a bankrupt company could leave creditors unpaid without any liability on the part of its owners. It also lampoons the Joint Stock Company Act by imagining the absurd convergence of natural persons (or sovereign nations) with legal commercial entities under the limited companies laws. In addition, it mocks the conceits of the late 19th-century British Empire and several of the nation&#x27;s beloved institutions. In mocking the adoption by a &quot;barbaric&quot; country of the cultural values of an &quot;advanced&quot; nation, it takes a tilt at the cultural aspects of imperialism. The libretto was criticised as too long and rambling by some critics and later commentators, and several subplots introduced in Act I are never resolved.

&quot;Utopia&quot; is performed much less frequently than most other Gilbert and Sullivan operas. It can be expensive to produce, requiring a large principal cast and two costumes (&quot;native&quot; and &quot;drawing room&quot;) for most of the performers. The subject-matter and characters, including the specific government offices, are obscure for modern audiences, although its themes of corporatisation of public institutions and scandal in the British Royal family remain relevant. Bernard Shaw wrote in his highly favourable October 1893 review of the show in &quot;The World&quot;, &quot;I enjoyed the score of Utopia more than that of any of the previous Savoy operas.&quot;

== Background ==
In 1890, during the production of Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s previous opera, &quot;The Gondoliers&quot;, Gilbert became embroiled in a legal dispute with their producer, Richard D&#x27;Oyly Carte, over the cost of a new carpet for the Savoy Theatre – and, more generally, over the accounting for expenses over the course of their long partnership. Sullivan sided with Carte and was made a defendant in the case, and the partnership disbanded. Gilbert vowed to write no more operas for the Savoy, and after &quot;The Gondoliers&quot; closed in 1891, Gilbert withdrew the performance rights to his libretti. It was not until October 1891, after conversations with their publisher Tom Chappell, that Gilbert and Sullivan reconciled. After fulfilling their respective open commitments Gilbert and Sullivan were able to plan to renew their collaboration on a new opera, &quot;Utopia, Limited&quot;. The lawsuit, however, had left Gilbert and Sullivan somewhat embittered, and their last two works together suffered from a less collegial working relationship than the two men had typically enjoyed while writing earlier operas.

=== Genesis of the opera ===

In November 1892, after lengthy and delicate discussions over the financial arrangements for a new opera, Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte were able to reach an agreement and set to work on the new opera. On 27 January 1893, Gilbert read the plot outline for the libretto to Sullivan, and by July, he was finished with the libretto. Gilbert suffered from bad gout throughout the summer and autumn of 1893 and had to attend rehearsals in a wheelchair. Gilbert and Sullivan disagreed on several matters, including the character of Lady Sophy, and Sullivan found some of Gilbert&#x27;s lyrics difficult to set. Their lack of cohesion during the writing and editing of &quot;Utopia&quot; was in marked contrast with what Sullivan called the &quot;oneness&quot; of their previous collaborations since &quot;Trial by Jury&quot; in 1875. Nonetheless, Sullivan completed the setting of Gilbert&#x27;s first act within a month, and received particular congratulations from his collaborator for the finale, which Gilbert considered the best Sullivan had composed. For &quot;Utopia&quot;, the creators engaged Hawes Craven to design the sets, which were much praised. Craven was the designer for Henry Irving&#x27;s spectacular Shakespeare productions at the Lyceum Theatre. Percy Anderson designed the costumes. The scenery, properties and costumes cost an unprecedented total of £7,200.

In 1893, the year &quot;Utopia, Limited&quot; was produced, Princess Kaiulani of the independent monarchy of Hawaii attended a private school in England. She was the talk of the society pages, with much speculation as to the influence English &quot;civilization&quot; would have on the Princess and eventually her homeland. Two decades earlier, in 1870, Anna Leonowens first wrote about her six-year stint as governess to the children of the king of Siam (Thailand) in &quot;The English Governess at the Siamese Court&quot;. The two ladies and their stories are likely to have influenced the characters of Princess Zara and Lady Sophy, respectively. Another impetus for Gilbert in the genesis of the work was his disdain for England&#x27;s Limited Liability Act of 1862, which he had begun to explore in the previous opera with Sullivan, &quot;The Gondoliers&quot;.

By using an imaginary setting, Gilbert was emboldened to level some sharp satire at the British Empire, jingoism, the monarchy, party politics and other institutions that might have touched a more sensitive nerve if the opera had a British setting. In this work, Gilbert returns to the idea of an anti-Utopia, which he had explored, in various ways, in his early one-act operas, &quot;Happy Arcadia&quot;, &quot;Our Island Home&quot;, &quot;Topsyturveydom&quot;, and some of his other early works, especially &quot;The Happy Land&quot;. The previous Gilbert and Sullivan opera, &quot;The Gondoliers&quot;, also concerns an imaginary island kingdom where the rules of court are considerably different from those in Britain. In &quot;Utopia&quot;, the island begins as a virtual paradise, is thrown into chaos by the importation of &quot;English&quot; influences, and is eventually saved by an English political expedience. Gilbert&#x27;s biographer Jane Stedman calls this a &quot;Gilbertian invasion plot&quot;.
The opera&#x27;s satiric treatment of limited liability entities that are not required to honour their obligations and scandal in the monarchy was effective in 1893 and still resonates today. In addition, the show satirises &quot;practically everything English – English prudery, English conversation, English company promoting, the English party system, the English War Office and Admiralty, the County Council, and the English Cabinet.&quot; Apart from satirical elements, Gilbert indulges in some small topical touches throughout the libretto. For instance, he was up-to-date in his technological references (as he had been in &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot; with the mention of the telephone), referencing George Eastman&#x27;s new product, the Kodak camera, and its slogan, &quot;You Press the Button, We Do the Rest&quot;. Gilbert also throws some barbs at the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s office, as he loved to do. In addition, The Court of St. James&#x27;s is mockingly confused with St James&#x27;s Hall and its minstrel shows. Sullivan joins in the parody, underlining the mock praise of all things English with a repeated motif throughout the score based on the melody of &quot;Rule Britannia!&quot;.

=== Reception and aftermath ===
The Savoy audiences were glad to see Gilbert and Sullivan back together, and the first-night reception was rapturous. Sullivan wrote in his diary, &quot;Went into the orchestra at 8.15 sharp. My ovation lasted 65 seconds! Piece went wonderfully well – not a hitch of any kind, and afterwards G. and I had a &quot;double call&quot;.&quot; The critics were divided on the merits of the piece. &quot;Punch&quot;, habitually hostile to Gilbert, commented, &quot;&#x27;Limited&#x27; it is, in more senses than one.&quot; &quot;The Standard&quot;, by contrast, said, &quot;Mr. Gilbert and Sir Arthur Sullivan are here at their very best … The wit, humour and satire of the book have not been surpassed in any of the author&#x27;s previous operas, the composer&#x27;s fascinating vein of melody flows as freshly as ever, and the orchestration is full of characteristically happy fancies … A more complete success has never been achieved in comic opera, even at the Savoy.&quot; &quot;The Pall Mall Gazette&quot; also praised Sullivan&#x27;s contribution, but disparaged Gilbert&#x27;s: in its view the music &quot;has not its equal in the whole Sullivan and Gilbert series&quot;, but the book had &quot;not merely a sense of cheapness but the sense of weariness even to exhaustion.&quot; &quot;The Era&quot; commented that Gilbert&#x27;s &quot;wit was as sparkling and his satire as keen as ever,&quot; and thought the council scene &quot;screamingly funny&quot;. &quot;The Observer&quot; judged that Gilbert had lost none of his merits, and that &quot;wit abounds&quot; and &quot;is as spontaneous as ever: not forced or vulgarised, and his rhymes are always faultless.&quot;

Some critics thought it a weakness that the work contained references to the earlier Gilbert and Sullivan operas, for example in the re-use of the character Captain Corcoran, and communications between King Paramount and the Mikado of Japan. &quot;The Pall Mall Gazette&quot; observed, &quot;It is always a melancholy business when a writer is driven to imitate himself. &quot;Utopia (limited)&quot; is a mirthless travesty of the work with which his name is most generally associated. ... Mr. Gilbert has failed to make the old seem new&quot;. &quot;The Musical Times&quot; reported the theatregoing public&#x27;s rejoicing that the partners were reunited, but added:
&quot;The Daily News&quot; and &quot;The Globe&quot; both noted that Act I ran longer than any previous Savoy Opera and needed pruning. &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; praised the work, but commented that there was &quot;much (sometimes too much) Gilbertian dialogue&quot;. However, Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s choices for what to cut are suspect. The soprano&#x27;s aria, &quot;Youth is a boon avowed&quot; got some of the most enthusiastic reviews from the press but was cut after the opening night. &quot;The Globe&quot; called it &quot;one of Sir Arthur Sullivan&#x27;s best works&quot;. Also, the pre-production cuts left subplots that were introduced in Act I unresolved. For example, Sullivan refused to set one of Gilbert&#x27;s scenes for Nancy McIntosh, which left the Scaphio–Phantis–Zara subplot unresolved. Rutland Barrington, in his memoirs, felt that the &quot;second act... was not as full of fun as usual&quot; in the Gilbert and Sullivan operas.

The show made a modest profit, despite the unusually high cost of staging it. In competition with the musical comedies&#x27; fashion pageantry, the drawing room scene was of an unprecedented opulence. &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; called it &quot;one of the most magnificent ever beheld on the stage&quot;, and even &quot;Punch&quot; praised the splendour of the production, but it added thousands of pounds of expense, making &quot;Utopia&quot; the most expensive of all of the Savoy Operas. The taste of the London theatre-going public was shifting away from comic opera and towards musical comedies such as &quot;In Town&quot; (1892), &quot;A Gaiety Girl&quot; (1893) and &quot;Morocco Bound&quot; (1893), which were to dominate the London stage for the next two decades and beyond.
&quot;Utopia&quot; introduced Gilbert&#x27;s last protégée, Nancy McIntosh, as Princess Zara, and the role was much expanded to accommodate her. According to the scholar John Wolfson, in his book, &quot;Final Curtain&quot;, this damaged and unbalanced the script by detracting from its parody of government. Commentators agree that McIntosh was not a good actress, and during the run of &quot;Utopia&quot;, her lack of confidence and health combined to affect her performance. &quot;Utopia, Limited&quot; was to be McIntosh&#x27;s only part with the D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company, as Sullivan refused to write another piece if she was to take part in it. Discussions over her playing the role of Yum-Yum in a proposed revival of &quot;The Mikado&quot; led to another row between the two that prevented the revival, and Gilbert&#x27;s insistence upon her appearing in &quot;His Excellency&quot; caused Sullivan to refuse to set the piece. Three years passed before Gilbert and Sullivan collaborated again, on their last work, &quot;The Grand Duke&quot;.

=== Production history ===
Before the end of October, the title of the piece was changed from &quot;Utopia (Limited)&quot; to &quot;Utopia, Limited&quot;. &quot;Utopia, Limited&quot; ran for 245 performances, a modest success by the standards of the late Victorian theatre; although it was a shorter run than any of Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s 1880s collaborations, it was the longest run at the Savoy in the 1890s. After the original production, four D&#x27;Oyly Carte touring companies played &quot;Utopia&quot; in the British provinces, and the piece was included in tours until 1900. There were also a D&#x27;Oyly Carte production in New York in 1894, performances in the D&#x27;Oyly Carte South African tour of 1902–03, and a J. C. Williamson production in Australia and New Zealand in 1905 and 1906, managed by Henry Bracy. Rupert D&#x27;Oyly Carte considered producing a revival in 1925, but the cost of the production was found to be too great, and the proposed revival was abandoned. &quot;Utopia&quot; was not revived by the D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company until 4 April 1975, during the company&#x27;s centenary season at the Savoy Theatre, directed by Michael Heyland. The single performance was so oversubscribed that the company arranged to give four further performances at the Royal Festival Hall in London later that year.

Various amateur companies performed the opera during the 20th century, and it has enjoyed occasional professional productions in the U.S. by professional companies such as the American Savoyards in the 1950s and 1960s, the Light Opera of Manhattan in the 1970s and 1980s, Light Opera Works in Chicago in 1984 and Ohio Light Opera in 2001. The New York Gilbert and Sullivan Players also gave a staged concert performance in celebration of the opera&#x27;s centenary in 1993 and again in 2010. The Gilbert &amp; Sullivan Opera Company gave two fully staged performances at the 18th International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival in Buxton, England in 2011, producing a commercial video of the production. Although productions are still less frequent than those of the better-known Gilbert and Sullivan operas, and professional productions are rare, &quot;Utopia&quot; is regularly presented by some of the amateur Gilbert and Sullivan repertory companies, and an amateur production has been seen most summers at the International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival.

== Synopsis ==

=== Act I ===

On the fictional South Pacific island of Utopia, the monarch, King Paramount, has sent his eldest daughter, Princess Zara, to Girton College in England. He hopes that her training there will contribute to his plan to civilise his people. The Public Exploder, Tarara, disturbs the languor of the Utopian maidens (&quot;In lazy languor, motionless&quot;) to remind them of his duty to blow up the King with dynamite if the two &quot;Wise Men&quot;, Scaphio and Phantis, order him to do so; Tarara would then be appointed King. The Wise Men appear, heralded by the chorus (&quot;O make way for the Wise Men&quot;) and note that their duty is to spy upon the King to prevent &quot;rascality&quot; (&quot;In every mental lore&quot;). Phantis proclaims his love for the Princess Zara, and Scaphio promises to help him win her (&quot;Let all your doubts take wing&quot;).

The king arrives (&quot;A King of autocratic power we&quot;) and presents his two younger daughters, Nekaya and Kalyba, as models of English-style deportment (&quot;Although of native maids the cream&quot;). Their English governess, Lady Sophy, explains how young ladies should behave when approached by amorous gentlemen (&quot;Bold-faced ranger&quot;). The king joins the two Wise Men, commenting that life is a farce (&quot;First you&#x27;re born&quot;). The king is quite upset about the Wise Men&#x27;s power over him: he is unable to marry the Lady Sophy because of self-mocking articles that Scaphio and Phantis have forced him to write and publish in the newspaper under a pseudonym. He hopes that neither Sophy nor Zara will see the pieces, although he feels they are witty and well written. Lady Sophy discovers the articles to her horror (&quot;Subjected to your heavenly gaze&quot;).
Princess Zara now returns to Utopia with six British gentlemen (the &quot;Flowers of Progress&quot;) in tow (&quot;Oh, maiden rich in Girton lore&quot;). She has become romantically involved with one of them, Captain Fitzbattleaxe (&quot;Ah! gallant soldier&quot;). Scaphio and Phantis, seeing her, are both smitten with love for the princess and argue jealously, finally agreeing to duel one another for her hand. Fitzbattleaxe comes up with a clever way to stall the Wise Men, by saying that, in England, two rivals must entrust the lady at the centre of a controversy to an officer of household cavalry &quot;as stakeholder&quot; until the argument is resolved (&quot;It&#x27;s understood, I think&quot;). Thus, he and Zara can remain together.

Soon, the Utopians assemble, and Zara introduces the Flowers of Progress one by one – Fitzbattleaxe (of the army), Sir Bailey Barre (Q.C. and MP), Lord Dramaleigh (a Lord Chamberlain), Mr. Blushington (of the county council), Mr. Goldbury (a company promoter) and Captain Corcoran (of the navy – a joking reference to the character from Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s early popular opera, &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot;). The Utopian people are duly impressed, and they listen as each of the Flowers of Progress gives a piece of advice about how to improve the country. Mr. Goldbury explains, at some length, the British limited liability companies law (&quot;Some seven men form an association&quot;). The King decides to transform his entire country into a limited liability corporation – an innovation that even England herself has not yet accepted. Everyone but Scaphio, Phantis and Tarara is enthusiastic.

=== Act II ===

Fitzbattleaxe is concerned that the fervour of his love has affected his singing voice (&quot;A tenor, all singers above&quot;). He and Zara share a tender scene (&quot;Words of love too loudly spoken&quot;). Utopia has transformed itself into a &quot;more perfect&quot; replica of Britain – it has built an army, a navy, and courts, purified its literature and drama, and wholeheartedly adopted Mr. Goldbury&#x27;s proposal, so that every person now is a limited liability entity.

The king and the Flowers of Progress exult in their success (&quot;Society has quite forsaken&quot;), and the people, pleased with English fashions and customs, sing of the country&#x27;s newfound glory (&quot;Eagle high in cloudland soaring&quot;). Scaphio and Phantis are furious because the change poses a threat to their power (&quot;With fury deep we burn&quot;). They demand that Paramount revoke the changes, and when he refuses, they remind him of their power over his life (&quot;If you think that when banded in unity&quot;). But the King points out that they cannot blow up a limited company. Scaphio and Phantis plot with Tarara on how to reverse the course of events and retire (&quot;With wily brain&quot;).
The younger princesses, Nekaya and Kalyba, meet Mr. Goldbury and Lord Dramaleigh, who explain that English girls are not so demure and are instead hearty and fun-loving (&quot;A wonderful joy our eyes to bless&quot;). The princesses are pleased at the prospect of abandoning some of the &quot;musty, fusty rules&quot; that they have been living under (&quot;Then I may sing and play?&quot;). Meanwhile, Lady Sophy bemoans Paramount&#x27;s flaw that prevents her loving him (&quot;When but a maid of fifteen year&quot;). The King, his dignity rediscovered, approaches Lady Sophy and tells her the truth about the articles written about him, and she now happily agrees to marry him (&quot;Oh, rapture unrestrained&quot;).

Scaphio and Phantis, however, have succeeded in convincing the people of Utopia that the changes are for the worse (&quot;Upon our sea-girt land&quot;). For example, there has been an end to war, making the army and navy useless; sanitation is so good that the doctors are unemployed; and so perfect are the laws that crime has all but ended, emptying the courts and leaving lawyers jobless. The people demand that the changes be revoked. Paramount asks his daughter for a solution, and, after a little prodding from Sir Bailey Barre, she realizes that she has forgotten &quot;the most essential element&quot; of British civilisation: Government by Party! Under the two-party system, each party will so confound the efforts of the other that no progress will be made, leading to the happy result that everyone seeks. The crowd is overjoyed, Scaphio and Phantis are thrown in prison, and the curtain falls as the people sing their praises of &quot;a little group of isles beyond the wave&quot; – Great Britain.

1 On the 1976 recording, the D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company preceded the Introduction with Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;Imperial March&quot;, which he composed around the same time.

The opening night principal cast and 1975 centenary cast were as follows:
== Recordings ==
The first recording was issued in 1964 featuring the amateur Lyric Theatre Company of Washington, D.C. conducted by John Landis. The first complete professional recording was released in 1976 by the D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company, conducted by Royston Nash, variously considered &quot;a somewhat flat and uninspired account of the score&quot; or to have &quot;a sparkle and spontaneity&quot; that are &quot;irresistible&quot;. The critic Andrew Lamb wrote, &quot;There is a suggestion of stodginess in the conducting … but the singing displays the dependability that is the D&#x27;Oyly Carte company&#x27;s chief virtue. Kenneth Sandford is outstanding as King Paramount.&quot; Also available is a 2001 Ohio Light Opera set, of which &quot;Opera News&quot; wrote: &quot;Conducted with verve by J. Lynn Thompson and featuring a generally strong cast, it serves the musical values of &quot;Utopia&quot; well. ... The principals sing with fine style and admirable diction.&quot; Unlike the D&#x27;Oyly Carte recording, the later set includes the dialogue, though &quot;Opera News&quot; considered that some performers &quot;lack dramatic variety in the spoken dialogue&quot;.

<text>The megamouth shark (Megachasma pelagios) is a species of deepwater shark. Rarely seen by humans, it measures around long and is the smallest of the three extant filter-feeding sharks alongside the relatively larger whale shark and basking shark. According to Sharkman&#x27;s World Organization a total of 286 specimens have been observed or caught since its discovery in 1976. Like the other two planktivorous sharks, it swims with its mouth wide open, filtering water for plankton and jellyfish. The diet of megamouth sharks mainly consists of zooplanktonic organisms like krill, jellyfish, shrimp larvae, squat lobsters, and crab lobsters. It is recognizable from its large head with rubbery lips. The megamouth is so unlike any other type of shark that it is usually considered to be the sole extant species in the family Megachasmidae, though some scientists have suggested it may belong in the family Cetorhinidae. 

== Taxonomy and evolution ==
The first megamouth shark was captured on November 15, 1976, about 25 miles northeast of Kahuku, Hawaii, when it became entangled in the sea anchor of United States Navy ship &quot;AFB-14&quot; at a depth of about 165 m (541 ft). The species was identified as being of a new species in its own family, Megachasmidae. Examination of the , specimen by Leighton Taylor showed it to be an entirely unknown type of shark, making it – along with the coelacanth – one of the more sensational discoveries in 20th-century ichthyology. The pectoral fin of the megamouth shark was studied, along with its skeletal and muscular system, to show its phylogenetic relationship to the other two sharks.
, only 99 megamouth specimens had been caught or sighted. They have been found in the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans. Japan, the Philippines and Taiwan have each yielded at least 10 specimens, the most of any single area, amounting to more than half the worldwide total. Specimens have also been sighted in or come out of the waters near Hawaii, California, Mexico, Indonesia, Australia, Brazil, Senegal, South Africa, Puerto Rico, Ecuador, and possibly Vietnam.

Researchers have predicted the feeding patterns of megamouth sharks in relation to the other two planktivorous sharks; the three planktivorous sharks have ram feeding in common, as it evolved from ram feeding swimming-type ancestors that developed their filtering mechanism to capture small prey like plankton. In addition to the living &quot;M. pelagios&quot;, however, two extinct megamouth species – the Priabonian &quot;M. alisonae&quot; and the Oligocene–Miocene &quot;M. applegatei&quot; – have also recently been proposed on the basis of fossilized tooth remains. An early ancestor of the recent species &quot;Megachasma pelagios&quot; was reported from the early Miocene (Burdigalian) of Belgium. However, the Cretaceous-aged &quot;M. comanchensis&quot; has been recently reclassified as an odontaspid shark in the genus &quot;Pseudomegachasma&quot;, and is in fact unrelated to the megamouth shark despite similar teeth morphology. The megamouth&#x27;s filter-feeding adaptations likely evolved independently from other extant filter-feeding sharks, even the lamniform basking shark, making it an example of convergent evolution.

==Description==
The appearance of the megamouth is distinctive, but little else is known about it. It has a brownish-black colour on top, is white underneath, and has an asymmetrical tail with a long upper lobe, similar to that of the thresher shark. The interior of its gill slits are lined with finger-like gill rakers that capture its food. A relatively poor swimmer, the megamouth has a soft, flabby body and lacks caudal keels. The megamouth is considerably less active than the other filter-feeding sharks, the basking shark and the whale shark. The megamouth has a stout body and a long, wide bulbous head.

Megamouths are large sharks, able to grow to in length. Mature males average at and females at . Weights of up to have been reported. A 2019 study suggested that it would have reached in maximum length. Megamouth sharks can be found as far northward as northern Japan; southern California (LACM 43745-1) and near Punta Eugenia, Baja California, and Hawaii. Megamouth sharks can be found at a depth of up to 1,000 m (3,280 ft). Megamouth sharks are dark blue, brownish-black, or gray above, lighter below; with a white band along the upper jaw; while the posterior margin of its fins are white.

As their name implies, megamouths have a large mouth with small teeth, and a broad, rounded snout, causing observers to occasionally mistake the megamouth for a young orca. The protruding inside of the upper lip is a brilliant silvery-white, which is very visible when the mouth is open. This lip was initially thought to be possibly embedded by luminous photophores when the first shark was examined in the early 1980s, which may act as a lure for plankton, while the team examining the second shark in the mid-1980s instead proposed that the lower lip might glow with the white band used as a reflector of sorts, but neither theory has been proven. In 2020, a study concluded that this species of shark does not in fact produce any light; the white band was found to merely be highly reflective of light. This white band is present in both sexes and could be either a feeding mechanism or possibly be used as a means of identifying other individuals of megamouth sharks. Their mouths can reach up to in width. Megamouth sharks have up to 50 rows of teeth in their upper-jaw and up to 75 rows of teeth in their lower-jaw.

== Behavior ==
In 1990, a 4.9-m (16-foot) male megamouth shark was caught near the surface off Dana Point, California. This individual was eventually released with a small radio tag attached to its soft body. The tag relayed depth and time information over a two-day period. During the day, the shark swam at a depth around , but as the sun set, it would ascend and spend the night at depths between . Both day and night, its progress was very slow, around . This pattern of vertical migration is seen in many marine animals as they track the movement of plankton in the water column. The shark captured in March 2009 was reportedly netted at a depth of .

==Reproduction==
Reproduction is ovoviviparous, meaning that the young sharks develop in eggs that remain within the mother&#x27;s body until they hatch. Tissue samples were obtained from twenty-seven megamouths caught in a two-year period off the Hualien coast (eastern Taiwan), and two caught in Baja California, Mexico, and samples taken from GenBank to perform a population genetic analyses of the megamouth shark; the results indicated no genetic diversity between populations found in different geographical locations, which indicates the species forms a single, highly migratory, interbreeding population.

<text>The Sorcerer is a two-act comic opera, with a libretto by W. S. Gilbert and music by Arthur Sullivan. It was the British duo&#x27;s third operatic collaboration. The plot of &quot;The Sorcerer&quot; is based on a Christmas story, &quot;An Elixir of Love&quot;, that Gilbert wrote for &quot;The Graphic&quot; magazine in 1876. A young man, Alexis, is obsessed with the idea of love levelling all ranks and social distinctions. To promote his beliefs, he invites the proprietor of J. W. Wells &amp; Co., Family Sorcerers, to brew a love potion. This causes everyone in the village to fall in love with the first person they see and results in the pairing of comically mismatched couples. In the end, Wells must sacrifice his life to break the spell.

The opera opened on 17 November 1877 at the Opera Comique in London, where it ran for 178 performances. It was considered a success by the standards of that time and encouraged the collaborators to write their next opera, &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot;. &quot;The Sorcerer&quot; was revised for an 1884 revival, and that version is usually performed today. &quot;The Sorcerer&quot; was the first Savoy opera for which the author and composer had nearly total control over the production and the selection of cast. Several of the actors chosen went on to create principal roles in most of the later Gilbert and Sullivan operas. It was their first opera to use all the major character types and typical range of songs that would appear in their later collaborations, such as comic duets, a patter song, a contrapuntal double chorus, a tenor and soprano love duet, a soprano showpiece and so forth.

The modest success of &quot;The Sorcerer&quot; was overshadowed by the extraordinary popularity of Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s later collaborations, and the opera remains one of the team&#x27;s less popular ones. The satire in the piece concerns Victorian-era class distinctions and operatic conventions with which modern audiences are less familiar. Nevertheless, the opera was important to the development of the Gilbert and Sullivan collaboration and is still regularly played.

==Background==
In 1871, W. S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan had written &quot;Thespis&quot;, an extravaganza for the Gaiety Theatre&#x27;s holiday season that did not lead immediately to any further collaboration. Three years later, in 1875, talent agent and producer Richard D&#x27;Oyly Carte was managing the Royalty Theatre, and he needed a short opera to be played as an afterpiece to Jacques Offenbach&#x27;s &quot;La Périchole&quot;. Carte was able to bring Gilbert and Sullivan together again to write the one-act piece, called &quot;Trial by Jury&quot;, which became a surprise hit. The piece was witty, tuneful and very &quot;English&quot;, in contrast to the burlesques and adaptations of French operettas that dominated the London musical stage at that time. &quot;Trial by Jury&quot; proved even more popular than &quot;La Périchole&quot;, becoming an unexpected hit, touring extensively and enjoying revivals and a world tour.
After the success of &quot;Trial by Jury&quot;, several producers attempted to reunite Gilbert and Sullivan, but difficulties arose. Plans for a collaboration for Carl Rosa in 1875 fell through because Gilbert was too busy with other projects, and an attempted Christmas 1875 revival of &quot;Thespis&quot; by Richard D&#x27;Oyly Carte failed when the financiers backed out. Gilbert and Sullivan continued their separate careers, though both continued writing light opera. Finally, in 1877, Carte organised a syndicate of four financiers and formed the Comedy Opera Company, capable of producing a full-length work. By July 1877, Gilbert and Sullivan were under contract to produce a two-act opera. Gilbert expanded on his own short story that he had written the previous year for &quot;The Graphic&quot;, &quot;An Elixir of Love,&quot; creating a plot about a magic love potion that – as often occurs in opera – causes everyone to fall in love with the wrong partner.

Now backed by a company dedicated to their work, Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte were able to select their own cast, instead of using the players under contract to the theatre where the work was produced, as had been the case with their earlier works. They chose talented actors, most of whom were not well-known stars; and so did not command high fees, and whom they felt they could mould to their own style. Then, they tailored their work to the particular abilities of these performers. Carte approached Mrs Howard Paul to play the role of Lady Sangazure in the new opera. Mr and Mrs Howard Paul had operated a small touring company booked by Carte&#x27;s agency for many years, but the couple had recently separated. She conditioned her acceptance of the part on the casting of her 24-year-old protege, Rutland Barrington. When Barrington auditioned before W. S. Gilbert, the young actor questioned his own suitability for comic opera, but Gilbert, who required that his actors play their sometimes-absurd lines in all earnestness, explained the casting choice: &quot;He&#x27;s a staid, solid swine, and that&#x27;s what I want.&quot; Barrington was given the role of Dr Daly, the vicar, which was his first starring role on the London stage.

For the character role of Mrs. Partlet, they chose Harriett Everard, an actress who had worked with Gilbert before. Carte&#x27;s agency supplied additional singers, including Alice May (Aline), Giulia Warwick (Constance), and Richard Temple (Sir Marmaduke). Finally, in early November 1877, the last role, that of the title character, John Wellington Wells, was filled by the comedian George Grossmith. Grossmith had appeared in charity performances of &quot;Trial by Jury&quot;, where both Sullivan and Gilbert had seen him (indeed, Gilbert had directed one such performance, in which Grossmith played the judge), and Gilbert had earlier commented favourably on his performance in Tom Robertson&#x27;s &quot;Society&quot; at the Gallery of Illustration. After singing for Sullivan, upon meeting Gilbert, Grossmith wondered aloud if the role shouldn&#x27;t be played by &quot;a fine man with a fine voice&quot;. Gilbert replied, &quot;No, that is just what we don&#x27;t want.&quot;

&quot;The Sorcerer&quot; was not the only piece on which either Gilbert or Sullivan were working at that time. Gilbert was completing &quot;Engaged&quot;, a &quot;farcical comedy&quot;, which opened on 3 October 1877. He also was sorting out the problems with &quot;The Ne&#x27;er-do-Weel&quot;, a piece he wrote for Edward Sothern. Meanwhile, Sullivan was writing the incidental music to &quot;Henry VIII&quot;; only after its premiere on 28 August did he begin working on &quot;The Sorcerer&quot;. The opening was originally scheduled for 1 November 1877; however, the first rehearsals took place on 27 October, and the title role of J. W. Wells was filled just before that time. &quot;The Sorcerer&quot; finally opened at Opera Comique on 17 November 1877.

==Synopsis==

===Act I===
The villagers of Ploverleigh are preparing to celebrate the betrothal of Alexis Pointdextre, the son of the local baronet, and the blue-blooded Aline Sangazure (&quot;Ring forth, ye bells&quot;). Only a young village maiden named Constance Partlet seems unwilling to join in the happy mood, and we learn as she tells her mother that she is secretly in love with the local vicar, Dr Daly (&quot;When he is here, I sigh with pleasure&quot;); and the cleric himself promptly soliloquises that he has been unlucky in love (&quot;The air is charged with amatory numbers&quot;). However, despite Mrs. Partlet&#x27;s best attempts at matchmaking, the middle-aged Dr Daly seems unable to conceive that a young girl like Constance would be interested in him.
Alexis and Aline arrive (&quot;With heart and with voice&quot;), and it soon becomes clear that his widower father Sir Marmaduke and her widowed mother Lady Sangazure are concealing long-held feelings for each other, which propriety however demands remain hidden (&quot;Welcome joy, adieu to sadness&quot;). The betrothal ceremony is carried out, and left alone together Alexis reveals to his fiancée his plans for practical implementation of his principle that love should unite all classes and ranks (&quot;Love feeds on many kinds of food, I know&quot;). He has invited a representative from a respectable London firm of sorcerers to Ploverleigh (&quot;My name is John Wellington Wells&quot;). Aline has misgivings about hiring a real sorcerer. Nevertheless, Alexis instructs Wells to prepare a batch of love potion, sufficient to affect the entire village, except that it must have no effect on married people.

Wells mixes the potion, assisted by sprites, fiends, imps, demons, ghosts and other fearsome magical beings in an incantation (&quot;Sprites of earth and air&quot;). The village gathers for the wedding feast (&quot;Now to the Banquet we Press&quot;), and the potion is added to a teapot. All of the villagers, save Alexis, Aline and Wells, drink it and, after experiencing some hallucinations (&quot;Oh, marvellous illusion&quot;), they fall unconscious.

===Act II===

At midnight that night (&quot;&#x27;Tis twelve, I think&quot;), the villagers awake and, under the influence of the potion, each falls in love with the first person of the opposite sex that they see (&quot;Why, where be Oi&quot;). All of the matches thus made are highly and comically unsuitable; Constance, for example, loves the ancient notary who performed the betrothal (&quot;Dear friends, take pity on my lot&quot;). However, Alexis is pleased with the results, and now asserts that he and Aline should drink the potion themselves to seal their own love. Aline is hurt by his lack of trust and refuses, offending him (&quot;Thou hast the power thy vaunted love&quot;). Alexis is distracted, however, by the revelation that his upper-class father has fallen for the lower-class Mrs. Partlet; he determines to make the best of this union (&quot;I rejoice that it&#x27;s decided&quot;).

Wells, meanwhile, is regretting the results that his magic has caused, and regrets them still more when the fearsome Lady Sangazure fixes on him as the object of her affections (&quot;Oh, I have wrought much evil with my spells&quot;). Aline decides to yield to Alexis&#x27; persuasion and drinks the potion without telling Alexis. Upon awaking, she inadvertently meets Dr Daly first and falls in love with him (&quot;Oh, joyous boon&quot;). Alexis desperately appeals to Wells as to how the effects of the spell can be reversed. It turns out that this requires that either Alexis or Wells himself yield up his life to Ahrimanes. The people of Ploverleigh rally against the outsider from London and Wells, resignedly, bids farewell and is swallowed up by the underworld in a burst of flames (&quot;Or he or I must die&quot;). The spell broken, the villagers pair off according to their true feelings, and celebrate with another feast (reprise of &quot;Now to the banquet we press&quot;).

==Productions==

&quot;The Sorcerer&quot; opened on 17 November 1877 at the Opera Comique, preceded by &quot;Dora&#x27;s Dream&quot;, a curtain-raiser composed by Sullivan&#x27;s assistant Alfred Cellier, with words by Arthur Cecil, a friend of both Gilbert&#x27;s and Sullivan&#x27;s. Busy with last-minute cuts and changes the day before the show opened, Sullivan had no time to write an overture and used the &quot;Graceful Dance&quot; music from his incidental music to &quot;Henry VIII&quot;, together with a few measures of music from &quot;Oh Marvellous Illusion&quot;, as an overture. For the 1884 revival, an overture was composed by Sullivan&#x27;s assistant, Hamilton Clarke. Gilbert&#x27;s meticulous rehearsal of the cast was noticed and commented on favourably by the critics, and the opening-night audience was enthusiastic. &quot;The Sorcerer&quot; ran for 178 performances, making a profit. A touring company also began playing the opera in March 1878. D&#x27;Oyly Carte continued touring the piece in the early 1880s. Unauthorised productions played on Broadway and elsewhere in the U.S. beginning by 1879. The original London sets were by W. Beverly, and costumes were by C. Wilhelm.

&quot;The Sorcerer&quot; was revived in 1884, the first of Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s full-length operas to be revived. Its second London revival in 1898 came sooner than any other Savoy opera except for &quot;The Mikado&quot;. The D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company generally played &quot;Trial by Jury&quot; as a companion piece with the opera. In America, &quot;The Sorcerer&quot; was played as early as 1879 by the Adah Richmond Comedy Opera Troupe at Boston&#x27;s Gaiety Theatre. In Australia, its first authorised production opened on 22 May 1886 at the Theatre Royal, Melbourne, produced by J. C. Williamson, starring Frank Thornton, Nellie Stewart and Alice Barnett, conducted by Alfred Cellier, although unauthorised productions had appeared by 1879.
In the early years of the 20th century, however, &quot;The Sorcerer&quot; gradually fell out of favour in Britain. As discussed below, it draws on an older theatrical tradition and satirises social and operatic conventions that are less accessible to modern audiences than the ones explored in the more famous G&amp;S works starting with &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot;. The D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company, which had exclusive rights to the opera in Britain, dropped &quot;The Sorcerer&quot; in 1901, and its principal repertory company did not play the piece again until 1916, after which it made its first professional London appearance in over twenty years in 1919. The company played the opera only intermittently during the 1920s and early 1930s. In 1938 and 1939, it was performed only in the company&#x27;s London seasons, and only for a handful of performances. During the winter of 1941–42, the scenery and costumes for &quot;The Sorcerer&quot; and three other operas were destroyed in enemy action. The opera was not revived professionally in the UK until 1971. Amateur British companies followed suit, as many dropped it from their repertory of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas during these three decades, although American companies often continued their regular rotation of the eleven operas from &quot;Trial&quot; through &quot;The Gondoliers&quot;.

Outside the U.K., however, the opera continued to be played regularly in Australasia by the J. C. Williamson Opera Company, and it was revived on Broadway in 1915 with DeWolf Hopper in the title role. It was played by the American Savoyards in the United States from the 1950s and by other professional companies in the U.S. thereafter. After 1970, &quot;The Sorcerer&quot; was included in the D&#x27;Oyly Carte repertory through the 1975 centenary season, then dropped for several years, then restored for the company&#x27;s last few seasons before it closed in 1982. Amateur companies that had dropped the opera restored it to their rotations after the 1970 revival, and it still receives regular productions, both professional and amateur.

The following table summarises the main London productions of &quot;The Sorcerer&quot; during Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s lifetimes:

==Reception==

===1877 reaction===
The early reviews were generally favourable. According to &quot;The Times&quot;, &quot;The Sorcerer&quot; &quot;achieved a genuine success, and, moreover, a success in every respect deserved&quot;. &quot;The Era&quot; praised both libretto and music: &quot;the libretto, both in the prose and poetical portions, displays remarkable facility in writing fanciful and witty dialogue; and the lively flow of Mr. Sullivan&#x27;s music, always tuneful, bright, and sparkling, and frequently reaching a very high standard of excellence, could hardly fail to please.&quot; &quot;Lloyd&#x27;s Weekly Newspaper&quot; called it &quot;a very amusing work&quot;, and &quot;Reynolds&#x27;s Newspaper&quot; proclaimed it &quot;one of the best entertainments of the kind that has yet been placed on the stage&quot;. As with their previous opera, &quot;Trial by Jury&quot;, the integration of Gilbert&#x27;s words and Sullivan&#x27;s music was emphasised. &quot;The Times&quot; commented that &quot;the music is spontaneous, appearing invariably to spring out of the dramatic situations, as though it was their natural concomitant&quot;; &quot;The Musical Times&quot; mused that &quot;it seems as if every composition had grown up in the mind of the author as he wrote the words&quot;; and &quot;The Pall Mall Gazette&quot; called the union between composer and librettist &quot;well-assorted&quot;, arguing that &quot;the opera contains several very happily designed pieces, in which one cannot tell (and need not know) whether the merit of the original underlying idea belongs to the composer of the poem or to the author of the score&quot;.

A dissenting voice was &quot;Figaro&quot;, which claimed that there was nothing in &quot;The Sorcerer&quot; that could not have been written by &quot;any theatrical conductor engaged at a few pounds a week&quot;. It also criticised Sullivan for wasting his talent on comic opera; such criticism would follow him through the rest of his career. &quot;Monthly Musical Record&quot; objected to the comic depiction of a clergyman, commenting that &quot;the earnest, hard-working, and serious Clergy should not be made the subject of sneering caricature upon the stage&quot;, and Lewis Carroll wrote in his 1888 essay:

Mr. Gilbert – to whom we owe a deep debt of gratitude for the pure and healthy fun he has given us in such comedies as &quot;Patience&quot; – seems to have a craze for making bishops and clergymen contemptible. Yet are they behind other professions in such things as earnestness, and hard work, and devotion of life to the call of duty? That clever song &quot;The pale young curate&quot;, with its charming music, is to me simply painful. I seem to see him as he goes home at night, pale and worn with the day&#x27;s work, perhaps sick with the pestilent atmosphere of a noisome garret where, at the risk of his life, he has been comforting a dying man – and is your sense of humour, my reader, so keen that you can laugh at that man?
Four numbers were encored during the opening night: Aline&#x27;s aria &quot;Oh, happy young heart&quot;, &quot;My name is John Wellington Wells&quot;, the Act II quintet &quot;I rejoice that it&#x27;s decided&quot; and Sir Marmaduke&#x27;s and Lady Sangazure&#x27;s duet &quot;Welcome joy, adieu to sadness&quot;. &quot;The Observer&quot; called this duet &quot;a masterpiece of construction. ... The Baronet sings to the accompaniment of a gavotte, and suddenly bursts forth into a rapid semi-quaver passage, expressive of his admiration of the lady. She follows his example, and while one sings a slow movement the other sings the &quot;presto&quot; movement alternatively&quot;. &quot;The Era&quot; called the quintet &quot;the gem of the opera&quot;, because it is &quot;written with delightful fluency and grace, is admirably harmonised, and the melody is as fresh as May dew.&quot; &quot;Punch&quot; argued that &quot;the quintette and the old-fashioned duet with minuet step are the two best numbers&quot; in the opera.

===Revivals and later assessments===
Both revivals during the composer&#x27;s lifetime were successful. &quot;The Times&quot; called the 1884 revival &quot;distinctly a step in the right direction&quot; and in 1898 the paper claimed that &quot;&quot;The Sorcerer&quot; is very far from having exhausted its popularity&quot;. A review of the 1886 Australian production ranked the opera in &quot;a middle place in Gilbert and Sullivan compositions. Abounding in tuneful numbers, one or two of which rank with anything that has come from Sir Arthur Sullivan&#x27;s pen, the orchestration is thin compared with that of his later operas and its melodies have never taken the same popular hold as those of &quot;Pinafore&quot;, a work of about equal calibre from a musical point of view. ... The libretto is sparkling and pungent, and the idea of presenting a British bagman in the guise of a controller of demons and vendor of family curses is as happy a conception as any which has taken form on this modern stage&quot;.

Later assessments of the opera have often mentioned both the opera&#x27;s strong and weak points. Audrey Williamson wrote in a 1982 book that the virtues of &quot;The Sorcerer&quot;, &quot;in spite of its defects ... justify its place in the repertoire.&quot; In 1996, Ian Bradley commented in the introduction to his annotated edition of the Gilbert and Sullivan libretti, &quot;It will certainly be a great pity if it gradually fades away. &quot;The Sorcerer&quot; contains two of W. S. Gilbert&#x27;s best-drawn characters, the soulful Dr Daly ... and the flashy but ultimately tragic figure of John Wellington Wells. Sir Arthur Sullivan&#x27;s music is delightful and guaranteed to weave a magic spell over all those who hear it, if not actually to make them fall instantly in love with their next-door neighbours.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; commented in 2012 that the plot &quot;has not aged especially well. Its references to rank are dated beyond empathy’s reach; filled with sly allusions, its assumptions about a general audience&#x27;s musical knowledge are unrealistic. Without those cues what remains is neither as exotic nor as amusing as &quot;Pinafore, Pirates&quot; or &quot;The Mikado&quot;. Still, &quot;The Sorcerer&quot; packs ample charms, including a felicitous score, a Verdian drinking song turned to teetotal ends, and at least one chorus that has reached the periphery of pop culture. ... the work can entrance a modern audience&quot;. However, Isaac Goldberg, one of the first Gilbert scholars, in 1913 called it &quot;the weakest of Gilbert&#x27;s productions&quot;.

==Analysis==

===Text and music===

The satire in the opera is focused on old-fashioned customs, pastoral opera conventions, the &quot;popularity of curates, the pose of aristocratic benevolence, and the inebriety of the working man&quot; rather than the broad political satire that would feature in many of the later Savoy opera librettos. For example, &quot;Sir Marmaduke, my dear young friend Alexis&quot;, a recitative among Alexis, Sir Marmaduke and Dr Daly, is a skit on the excessive politeness associated with early nineteenth-century aristocracy, and the incantation scene is a parody of the similar scene in Weber&#x27;s &quot;Der Freischütz&quot;. Dr Daly accompanies his Act II song on a flageolet. Gilbert satirises the Victorian temperance movement by introducing a non-alcoholic brindisi with jorums of tea; this is also a dig at Italian operas, many of which contained a brindisi scene. Another burlesque of Italian opera is &quot;Prepare for sad surprises&quot;, which is similar to Alfredo&#x27;s denunciation of Violetta in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;La traviata&quot;. Gilbert&#x27;s satire of these subjects, like most of his satire in the operas, was blunted with gentle humour. As Gilbert scholar Andrew Crowther explains, Gilbert characteristically combines his criticisms with comic entertainment, which renders them more palatable, while at the same time underlining their truth: &quot;By laughing at a joke you show that you accept its premise.&quot; Theatrical critic Allardyce Nicoll compared J. W. Wells&#x27; speech about blessings being less popular than curses to Mr. Hen&#x27;s satiric auction speech in &quot;The Historical Register for the Year 1736&quot; by Henry Fielding.

The characters in &quot;The Sorcerer&quot; have family names that characterise them. &quot;Pointdextre&quot; is French for dexter point, a heraldic term; &quot;Sangazure&quot; is French for blue blood. &quot;Partlet&quot; means hen. The two characters sing a duet, &quot;Welcome, joy, adieu to sadness!&quot; that contrasts and combines a &quot;Mozart-like minuet&quot; and rapid-fire patter. Other musical numbers that characterise the opera are the quintet in Act II, &quot;I rejoice that it&#x27;s decided&quot;, which is &quot;one of the prettiest things Sullivan ever wrote in the Mendelssohnian manner ... while in the duet that follows between Mr. Wells and Lady Sangazure there is a divertingly sepulchral andante and a no less comic tarentello-like allegro&quot;. &quot;The Sorcerer&quot; has certain technical difficulties in its production. It is the only Savoy opera to require a trapdoor, which many modern theatres do not have, and requires a pyrotechnical effect for a flash in the incantation scene.
In addition to Gilbert&#x27;s story, &quot;An Elixir of Love&quot;, critics have traced several ideas in the opera to earlier sources. The concept of a love philtre was widespread in nineteenth century opera, and a philtre that causes people to fall in love with the first person whom they see is found in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;. The idea of depicting the sorcerer as a respectable tradesman is comparable to the respectable friar in E. L. Blanchard&#x27;s 1863 burlesque, &quot;Harlequin and Friar Bacon&quot;, who is described as a &quot;Licensed Dealer in Black Art&quot;. A drinking-chorus with tea instead of alcoholic drink appeared in Gilbert&#x27;s &quot;The Merry Zingara&quot; (1868), a burlesque of &quot;The Bohemian Girl&quot;. In &quot;My name Is John Wellington Wells&quot;, Gilbert reused rhymes from one of his Bab Ballads, &quot;The Student&quot;.

Some commentators have argued that the opera&#x27;s relatively low popularity is due to satire that relies on Victorian era class distinctions; it may not be clear to the modern audience why a baronet cannot marry a pew-opener, while in the Victorian era it was self-evident. Also, the humour in the piece relies in many instances on parodies of operatic conventions that may be unfamiliar to some audiences. In 1913, E. J. Dent wrote in reference to &quot;The Sorcerer&quot;: &quot;It seems as if a course of Mozart in English might be the best preliminary step towards educating our on-coming public to a really intelligent appreciation of Sullivan&quot;. Gilbert scholar Andrew Crowther argues that while both &quot;The Sorcerer&quot; and &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot; satirise the idea of love levelling all ranks, the earlier opera attacks it more aggressively, offending audiences with which that idea was popular. Gilbert acknowledged that his position as a dramatist was similar to one of &quot;a refreshment contractor who has engaged to supply a meal of one dish at which all classes of the community are to sit down&quot;, since he needed to suit needs of both &quot;butcher-boy in the gallery&quot; and &quot;epicure in the stalls&quot;; Crowther argues that he did not succeed as well at this in &quot;The Sorcerer&quot; as in some of the later works.

===Pattern for later Savoy operas===

The opera establishes several important patterns for future Gilbert and Sullivan works. First, several recurring character types that would appear in their later operas are included: a comic baritone character with an autobiographical patter song (J. W. Wells) and a tenor and soprano as young lovers (Alexis and Aline). Those types can be traced back to Italian comic opera and &quot;commedia dell&#x27;arte&quot;. Character roles for a bass-baritone (Sir Marmaduke) and contralto (Lady Sangazure) are also repeated in the later Savoy operas. The vicar&#x27;s song, &quot;Time was when love and I were well acquainted&quot; is one of the first in a string of meditative &quot;Horatian&quot; lyrics in the Savoy operas, &quot;mingling happiness and sadness, an acceptance and a smiling resignation&quot;. These would allow characters in each of the Savoy operas an introspective scene where they stop and consider life, in contrast to the foolishness of the surrounding scenes.

One notable innovation that is characteristic of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, and confirmed by its extensive use in &quot;The Sorcerer&quot;, is the employment of the chorus as an essential part of the action. In most earlier operas, burlesques and comedies, the chorus had very little impact on the plot and served mainly as &quot;noise or ornament&quot;. In the Savoy operas, however, the chorus is essential, taking part in the action and often acting as an important character in its own right. &quot;The Sorcerer&quot; also confirms a pattern that had been introduced in the earlier collaborations and would be repeated in the other Savoy operas, except for &quot;The Yeomen of the Guard&quot;, to begin with a chorus number and end with a relatively short finale consisting of solos and chorus music. Sullivan later told his biographer, &quot;Until Gilbert took the matter in hand choruses were dummy concerns, and were practically nothing more than a part of the stage setting.&quot; Another Gilbert innovation, following the example of his mentor, T. W. Robertson, was that the costumes and sets were made as realistic as possible. This attention to detail would be repeated in all of the operas. This was far from standard procedure in Victorian drama, where naturalism was still a relatively new concept, and where most authors had very little influence on how their plays and libretti were staged.

&quot;The Sorcerer&quot; also contained several musical techniques that would become typical in the operas. One of the most important ones is the comic baritone&#x27;s lightly orchestrated, rapid-fire patter song, which would become one of the most distinguishing and popular features of Gilbert and Sullivan operas. Following Italian opera precedents, such as &quot;Largo al factotum&quot; from &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot;, these numbers juxtapose virtuosity in their speed of delivery (requiring clarity of elocution) with their often comic or satiric lyrics. In &quot;My name is John Wellington Wells&quot;, the title character of &quot;The Sorcerer&quot; introduces himself as a tradesman of an ironic kind: &quot;a dealer in magic and spells&quot;. Another typical Sullivanian musical technique is the contrapuntal combination of slow and rapid tunes in one song and a tenor aria set in time. Sullivan did this so frequently in the Savoy operas that comedian Anna Russell, in her comedy routine &quot;How to Write Your Own Gilbert and Sullivan Opera&quot;, exclaimed, &quot;the tenor ... according to tradition, &quot;must&quot; sing an aria in time&quot;. Another repeated musical technique was the emphasis of a single syllable to distinguish otherwise identical lines. For example, in the vicar&#x27;s Act I song, the same melody is sung in each of the two stanzas using the following text:

:Stanza 1: A saintly youth, by worldly thought untainted
:Stanza 2: Did I look pale? Then half a parish &quot;trem&quot;bled
In the second, the syllable &quot;trem&quot; has an optional high note to give it a unique character.

Several ideas from &quot;The Sorcerer&quot; were reused in later Savoy operas. Many images from , Aline&#x27;s cut ballad, are present in &quot;None shall part us&quot; in &quot;Iolanthe&quot;. Another example is satire on the aristocracy: while in &quot;The Sorcerer&quot; Lady Sangazure is in direct descent from Helen of Troy, in &quot;The Mikado&quot; Gilbert developed this idea, and Pooh-Bah can trace his ancestry &quot;back to a protoplasmal primordial atomic globule&quot;.

==Revisions and cut material==

===Initial cuts and changes===
Gilbert initially wrote a duet for Aline and Lady Sangazure, , followed by a ballad for Sangazure, . These numbers were cut before opening night, although the ballad was included in the first published version of the libretto. Alexis&#x27;s Act II ballad (&quot;Thou hast the power&quot;) was revised, with the refrain changed from common time to waltz time. Although performed on opening night, it was not included in the original vocal score. Available evidence suggests that the ballad was dropped from the opera, but later reinstated during the original run. It was a substitute for Aline&#x27;s ballad, , which was present in the license copy but cut before the first night and absent from the published version of libretto. Some of the text was reused in &quot;None shall part us&quot; in &quot;Iolanthe&quot;. The of Constance&#x27;s Act I aria, &quot;When he is here&quot;, was also cut during the original production.

The Act I finale was shortened during the original production to omit a reprise of the Brindisi after the &quot;Oh marvellous illusion&quot; chorus, and Constance&#x27;s Act II song was transposed downwards. Originally, in the Act II finale, there was a in which J. W. Wells summoned Ahrimanes (to be played by Mrs Paul), who told him that either he or Alexis must yield his life to quell the spell. This scene was cut, although its opening recitative in rewritten form was present in the first production.

===1884 revival===

The opera was extensively revised for the 1884 revival. An overture was arranged by Sullivan&#x27;s assistant, Hamilton Clarke, to replace Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;graceful dance&quot; from his incidental music to &quot;Henry VIII&quot;. The length of time between the acts was altered from a half-hour to twelve hours, and the Act II opening was rewritten. Act II originally started off with a patter chorus, , a pageant of mismatched couples. The revision changed the setting to nighttime, with a &quot;mysterioso&quot; trio for Alexis, Aline and John Wellington Wells to sing among the sleeping villagers. The villagers then awaken with a rustic chorus in West Country accent and pair up in the mismatched couples.

These revisions were not, however, done very carefully. The Act I Finale still says &quot;Their hearts will melt in half-an-hour / Then will be felt the potion&#x27;s power.&quot; Similarly, Aline drinks the potion in Act II, and falls insensible, but apparently awakes immediately to fall in love with Dr Daly, instead of falling asleep for twelve hours as the revisions would require.

==Historical casting==
The following tables show the casts of the principal original productions and D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company touring repertory at various times through to the company&#x27;s 1982 closure:

1This role is not credited in revivals, which used a revised libretto.

==Recordings==
&quot;The Sorcerer&quot; has not been recorded as often as most of the other Gilbert and Sullivan operas, and the recordings have not been generally well received. The 1966 D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company recording is considered the best of their efforts to record this opera.

The 1982 Brent Walker video is considered to be one of the best of that series and is recommended in Marc Shepherd&#x27;s Gilbert and Sullivan discography. More recent professional productions have been recorded on video by the International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival.

==Cultural impact==

&quot;The Sorcerer&quot; has made its way into popular culture. Isaac Asimov wrote a short story, &quot;The Up-To-Date Sorcerer&quot;, a homage to the opera consisting largely of a series of puns on phrases from it. Charlotte MacLeod&#x27;s 1985 mystery novel, &quot;The Plain Old Man&quot; concerns an amateur production of the opera. A series of seven novels by Tom Holt concern young sorcerers who join the firm of &quot;J. W. Wells &amp; Co&quot;: &quot;The Portable Door&quot; (2003), &quot;In Your Dreams&quot; (2004), &quot;Earth, Air, Fire, and Custard&quot; (2005), &quot;You Don&#x27;t Have to Be Evil to Work Here, But It Helps&quot; (2006), &quot;The Better Mousetrap&quot; (2008), &quot;May Contain Traces of Magic&quot; (2009) and &quot;Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Sausages&quot; (2011). In &quot;Meet Mr Mulliner&quot; by P. G. Wodehouse, the title hero sings a fragment from Dr Daly&#x27;s ballad and characterises his nephew as &quot;the sort of young curate who seems to have been so common in the &#x27;eighties, or whenever it was that Gilbert wrote The Sorcerer.&quot; It has also been referenced in popular TV series, such as in the &quot;Family Guy&quot; episode &quot;Patriot Games&quot;, where characters sing the song &quot;If you&#x27;ll marry me&quot; from Act II.

<text>The Cambridge Buskers were a duo of British musicians, whose career began in the late 1970s and were subsequently called The Classic Buskers. They performed classical music humorously using many instruments, costumes and props.

Michael Copley and David Adam Gillespie (Dag) Ingram met when they were students at Cambridge University. According to the liner notes of their first recording, their musical association began when they found themselves at Blackfriars station without enough money for the fare to get home. In an attempt to raise the money from passers-by, they played &quot;The Entertainer&quot; and &quot;Eine kleine Nachtmusik&quot; for a while, until they were asked to leave by a London Transport official.

Subsequently, they gained international success with their performances and many recordings, and performed in over 20 countries and in 15 languages until September 2016, when they disbanded after an incident in Shanghai. It is reported that at one point a Japanese comic strip was written about them.

Ian Moore (now known as Ian de Massini), another Cambridge University graduate who is also an organist, conductor, composer and singer (formerly in King&#x27;s College Choir, Cambridge), was the accordionist for the latter part of the Buskers&#x27; history.

The Classic Buskers wrote their own arrangements, primarily of classical works by famous composers. Ian Moore played piano accordion, used his voice, and occasionally other percussion instruments or props. Copley played a variety of woodwind instruments, including flute, recorder, ocarina, and crumhorn.

<doc id="318028" wikidata="Q1091101" url="?curid=318028" title="Princess Ida">
<text>Princess Ida; or, Castle Adamant is a comic opera with music by Arthur Sullivan and a libretto by W. S. Gilbert. It was their eighth operatic collaboration of fourteen; the next was &quot;The Mikado&quot;. &quot;Princess Ida&quot; opened at the Savoy Theatre on 5 January 1884 and ran for 246 performances. The piece concerns a princess who founds a women&#x27;s university and teaches that women are superior to men and should rule in their stead. Prince Hilarion, to whom she was betrothed in infancy, sneaks into the university, together with two friends, with the aim of collecting his bride. They disguise themselves as female students but are discovered, and all soon face a literal war between the sexes.

The opera satirizes feminism, women&#x27;s education and Darwinian evolution, which were controversial topics in conservative Victorian England. &quot;Princess Ida&quot; is based on a narrative poem by Alfred, Lord Tennyson called &quot;The Princess&quot; (1847), and Gilbert had written a farcical musical play, based on the poem, in 1870. He lifted much of the dialogue of &quot;Princess Ida&quot; directly from his 1870 farce. It is the only Gilbert and Sullivan opera in three acts and the only one with dialogue in blank verse.

Though its original run was modestly profitable, by Savoy opera standards &quot;Princess Ida&quot; was not considered a success, partly because of a particularly hot summer in London in 1884, and it was not revived in London until 1919. Nevertheless, the piece is performed regularly today by both professional and amateur companies, although not as frequently as the most popular of the Savoy operas.

==Background==
===Genesis===

&quot;Princess Ida&quot; is based on Tennyson&#x27;s serio-comic narrative poem of 1847, &quot;The Princess: A Medley&quot;. Gilbert had written a blank verse musical farce burlesquing the same material in 1870 called &quot;The Princess&quot;. He reused a good deal of the dialogue from this earlier play in the libretto of &quot;Princess Ida&quot;. He also retained Tennyson&#x27;s blank verse style and the basic story line about a heroic princess who runs a women&#x27;s college and the prince who loves her. He and his two friends infiltrate the college disguised as female students. Gilbert wrote entirely new lyrics for &quot;Princess Ida&quot;, since the lyrics to his 1870 farce were written to previously existing music by Offenbach, Rossini and others.

Tennyson&#x27;s poem was written, in part, in response to the founding of Queen&#x27;s College, London, the first college of women&#x27;s higher education in the United Kingdom, in 1847. When Gilbert wrote &quot;The Princess&quot; in 1870, women&#x27;s higher education was still an innovative, even radical concept. Girton College, one of the constituent colleges of the University of Cambridge, was established in 1869. However, by the time Gilbert and Sullivan collaborated on &quot;Princess Ida&quot; in 1883, a women&#x27;s college was a more established concept. Westfield College, the first college to open with the aim of educating women for University of London degrees, had opened in Hampstead in 1882. Thus, women&#x27;s higher education was in the news in London, and Westfield is cited as a model for Gilbert&#x27;s Castle Adamant.

Increasingly viewing his work with Gilbert as unimportant, beneath his skills and repetitious, Sullivan had intended to resign from the partnership with Gilbert and Richard D&#x27;Oyly Carte after &quot;Iolanthe&quot;, but after a recent financial loss, he concluded that his financial needs required him to continue writing Savoy operas. Therefore, in February 1883, with &quot;Iolanthe&quot; still playing strongly at the Savoy Theatre, Gilbert and Sullivan signed a new five-year partnership agreement to create new operas for Carte upon six months&#x27; notice. He also gave his consent to Gilbert to continue with the adaptation of &quot;The Princess&quot; as the basis for their next opera. Later that spring, Sullivan was knighted by Queen Victoria and the honour was announced in May at the opening of the Royal College of Music. Although it was the operas with Gilbert that had earned him the broadest fame, the honour was conferred for his services to serious music. The musical establishment, and many critics, believed that Sullivan&#x27;s knighthood should put an end to his career as a composer of comic opera – that a musical knight should not stoop below oratorio or grand opera. Having just signed the five-year agreement, Sullivan suddenly felt trapped.

By the end of July 1883, Gilbert and Sullivan were revising drafts of the libretto for &quot;Ida&quot;. Sullivan finished some of the composition by early September when he had to begin preparations for his conducting duties at the triennial Leeds Festival, held in October. In late October, Sullivan turned his attentions back to &quot;Ida&quot;, and rehearsals began in November. Gilbert was also producing his one-act drama, &quot;Comedy and Tragedy&quot;, and keeping an eye on a revival of his &quot;Pygmalion and Galatea&quot; at the Lyceum Theatre by Mary Anderson&#x27;s company. In mid-December, Sullivan bade farewell to his sister-in-law Charlotte, the widow of his brother Fred, who departed with her young family to America, never to return. Sullivan&#x27;s oldest nephew, Herbert, stayed behind in England as his uncle&#x27;s ward, and Sullivan threw himself into the task of orchestrating the score of &quot;Princess Ida&quot;. As he had done with &quot;Iolanthe&quot;, Sullivan wrote the overture himself, rather than assigning it to an assistant as he did in the case of most of his operas.

===Production===

&quot;Princess Ida&quot; is the only Gilbert and Sullivan work with dialogue entirely in blank verse and the only one of their works in three acts (and the longest opera to that date). The piece calls for a larger cast, and the soprano title role requires a more dramatic voice than the earlier works. The American star Lillian Russell was engaged to create the title role of &quot;Princess Ida&quot;, but Gilbert did not believe that she was dedicated enough, and when she missed a rehearsal, she was dismissed. The D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company&#x27;s usual female lead, Leonora Braham, a light lyric soprano, nevertheless moved up from the part of Lady Psyche to assume the title role. Rosina Brandram got her big break when Alice Barnett became ill and left the company for a time, taking the role of Lady Blanche and becoming the company&#x27;s principal contralto.

The previous Savoy opera, &quot;Iolanthe&quot;, closed after 398 performances on 1 January 1884, the same day that Sullivan composed the last of the musical numbers for &quot;Ida&quot;. Despite gruelling rehearsals over the next few days, and suffering from exhaustion, Sullivan conducted the opening performance on 5 January 1884 and collapsed from exhaustion immediately afterwards. The reviewer for the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; wrote that the score of &quot;Ida&quot; was &quot;the best in every way that Sir Arthur Sullivan has produced, apart from his serious works... Humour is almost as strong a point with Sir Arthur... as with his clever collaborator...&quot; The humour of the piece also drew the comment that Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s work &quot;has the great merit of putting everyone in a good temper.&quot; The praise for Sullivan&#x27;s effort was unanimous, though Gilbert&#x27;s work received some mixed notices.

===Aftermath===
Sullivan&#x27;s close friend, composer Frederic Clay, had suffered a serious stroke in early December 1883 that ended his career. Sullivan, reflecting on this, his own precarious health and his desire to devote himself to more serious music, informed Richard D&#x27;Oyly Carte on 29 January 1884 that he had determined &quot;not to write any more &#x27;Savoy&#x27; pieces.&quot; Sullivan fled the London winter to convalesce in Monte Carlo as seven provincial tours (one with a 17-year-old Henry Lytton in the chorus) and the U.S. production of &quot;Ida&quot; set out.
As &quot;Princess Ida&quot; began to show signs of flagging early on, Carte sent notice, on 22 March 1884, to both Gilbert and Sullivan under the five-year contract, that a new opera would be required in six months&#x27; time. Sullivan replied that &quot;it is impossible for me to do another piece of the character of those already written by Gilbert and myself.&quot; Gilbert was surprised to hear of Sullivan&#x27;s hesitation and had started work on a new opera involving a plot in which people fell in love against their wills after taking a magic lozenge – a plot that Sullivan had previously rejected. Gilbert wrote to Sullivan asking him to reconsider, but the composer replied on 2 April that he had &quot;come to the end of my tether&quot; with the operas:
Gilbert was much hurt, but Sullivan insisted that he could not set the &quot;lozenge plot&quot;. In addition to the &quot;improbability&quot; of it, it was too similar to the plot of their 1877 opera, &quot;The Sorcerer&quot;, and was too complex a plot. Sullivan returned to London, and, as April wore on, Gilbert tried to rewrite his plot, but he could not satisfy Sullivan. The parties were at a stalemate, and Gilbert wrote, &quot;And so ends a musical &amp; literary association of seven years&#x27; standing – an association of exceptional reputation – an association unequalled in its monetary results, and hitherto undisturbed by a single jarring or discordant element.&quot; However, by 8 May 1884, Gilbert was ready to back down, writing, &quot;...am I to understand that if I construct another plot in which no supernatural element occurs, you will undertake to set it? ... a consistent plot, free from anachronisms, constructed in perfect good faith &amp; to the best of my ability.&quot; The stalemate was broken, and on 20 May, Gilbert sent Sullivan a sketch of the plot to &quot;The Mikado&quot;.

A particularly hot summer in London did not help ticket sales for &quot;Princess Ida&quot; and forced Carte to close the theatre during the heat of August. The piece ran for a comparatively short 246 performances, and for the first time since 1877, the opera closed before the next Savoy opera was ready to open. &quot;Princess Ida&quot; was not revived in London until 1919. Some of these events are dramatised in the 1999 film &quot;Topsy-Turvy&quot;.
==Musical and textual analysis==
The opera satirizes feminism, women&#x27;s education and Darwinian evolution, all of which were controversial topics in conservative Victorian England. In the 15 years between the time that Gilbert wrote &quot;The Princess&quot; and the premiere of &quot;Princess Ida&quot;, the movement for women&#x27;s education had gained momentum in Britain, with the founding of Girton College (1869) and Newnham College (1871) at the University of Cambridge; and Somerville (1878) and Lady Margaret Hall (1878) at the University of Oxford. Westfield College, a women&#x27;s college in Hampstead, London, opened in 1882.

As in &quot;Patience&quot; and &quot;Iolanthe&quot;, the two previous Gilbert and Sullivan operas, &quot;Princess Ida&quot; concerns the war between the sexes. In &quot;Patience&quot;, the aesthetic-crazed women are contrasted with vain military men; in &quot;Iolanthe&quot;, the vague and flighty fairies (women) are pitted against the ineffective, dim-witted peers (men); and in &quot;Ida&quot;, overly serious students and professors at a women&#x27;s university (women) defy a marriage-by-force ultimatum by a militaristic king and his testosterone-laden court (men). &quot;Princess Ida&quot; is one of several Gilbert plays, including &quot;The Wicked World&quot;, &quot;Broken Hearts&quot;, &quot;Fallen Fairies&quot; and &quot;Iolanthe&quot;, where the introduction of males into a tranquil world of women brings &quot;mortal love&quot; that wreaks havoc with the status quo. Stedman calls this a &quot;Gilbertian invasion plot&quot;.

Sullivan&#x27;s score is majestic, and a sequence of songs in Act II, sometimes known as the &quot;string of pearls&quot;, is particularly well loved. Sullivan used chromatic and scalar passages and key modulations throughout the score, and commenters have called the Act II quartet &quot;The World Is But a Broken Toy&quot; one of Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;most beautiful, plaintive melodies.&quot; It has also been called &quot;Gounodesque&quot;. Although Gilbert&#x27;s libretto contains many funny lines, the iambic pentameter and three-act structure tend to make &quot;Ida&quot; more difficult to stage effectively than some of the other Savoy Operas. In addition, modern audiences sometimes find the libretto&#x27;s dated portrayal of sex roles, and the awkward resolution of the opera, unsatisfying. It is also curious, after the string of successes that the partnership had experienced with George Grossmith and Rutland Barrington in starring roles, to choose a theme that relegated them to comparatively minor roles.

==Synopsis==
===Act I===
In a pavilion at King Hildebrand&#x27;s palace, courtiers wait expectantly for the arrival of King Gama and his daughter Princess Ida, who was betrothed in infancy to Hildebrand&#x27;s son, Prince Hilarion (&quot;Search throughout the panorama&quot;). Hildebrand promises to wage war against Gama if the Princess should fail to appear (&quot;Now hearken to my strict command&quot;), while Hilarion, who is in love with Ida, although he has not seen her since he was two years old, wonders how she may have changed over the ensuing twenty years (&quot;Ida was a twelvemonth-old&quot;).

Ida&#x27;s war-like (and dull) brothers Arac, Guron and Scynthius, arrive at Hildebrand&#x27;s palace (&quot;We are warriors three&quot;), preceding their father. King Gama enters, explains his misanthropy (&quot;If you give me your attention I will tell you what I am&quot;), and promptly displays it by insulting Hildebrand and his son. He then announces that Princess Ida has forsworn men and founded a women&#x27;s university at Castle Adamant, one of his many country houses. The two Kings advise Hilarion to go to Castle Adamant to claim Ida; if she refuses him, Hildebrand will storm the castle (&quot;P&#x27;raps if you address the lady&quot;). But Hilarion plans to use romantic means, rather than force, to gain the princess&#x27;s love. He explains that nature has &quot;armed&quot; him and his friends, the courtiers Cyril and Florian, to win this &quot;war&quot; (&quot;Expressive glances will be our lances&quot;). The three set off to Castle Adamant, while King Gama and his sons are to remain at Hildebrand&#x27;s palace as hostages (&quot;For a month to dwell in a dungeon cell&quot;).

===Act II===

At Castle Adamant, Princess Ida&#x27;s pupils learn that &quot;man is nature&#x27;s sole mistake&quot; (&quot;Towards the Empyrean heights&quot;). One of the professors, Lady Blanche, doles out the punishments for the day, for &quot;offences&quot; that include bringing chessmen to the university – &quot;men with whom you give each other mate&quot; – and for sketching a double-perambulator. Princess Ida arrives (&quot;Minerva! Oh hear me&quot;) and delivers a stern lecture, stating that women&#x27;s brains are larger than men&#x27;s, and predicting that woman shall conquer man, but that once having conquered, woman will treat man better than he has treated her. Lady Blanche resents the princess&#x27;s authority and predicts that one day she will replace her as head of the university (&quot;Come mighty must&quot;, a song often cut from the D&#x27;Oyly Carte productions).

Hilarion, Cyril and Florian sneak into Castle Adamant (&quot;Gently, gently&quot;). They scoff at the idea of a woman&#x27;s college. Finding some discarded academic robes, the three men disguise themselves as young maidens wishing to join the university (&quot;I am a maiden cold and stately&quot;), and are welcomed by Princess Ida (&quot;The world is but a broken toy&quot;). Florian realises that their disguises won&#x27;t fool his sister, Lady Psyche (one of the professors), and they take her into their confidence. Lady Psyche warns them that they will face death if the princess discovers who they are and informs them of the princess&#x27;s theories on man, using a parable about an ape who falls in love with a high-born lady to illustrate her point that Darwinian &quot;Man, sprung from an Ape, is Ape at heart&quot; (&quot;A lady fair of lineage high&quot;).

Melissa, Lady Blanche&#x27;s daughter, has overheard them, but, fascinated by the first men she has ever seen, swears herself to secrecy. She falls in love with Florian at first sight, and the company celebrate joyously the discovery that men are not the monsters that Princess Ida had claimed (&quot;The woman of the wisest wit&quot;). Lady Blanche, who has not fallen for the men&#x27;s disguises, confronts Melissa. Though indignant at first, she is persuaded to keep the men&#x27;s secret when her daughter points out that if Hilarion is able to woo Princess Ida, Blanche will become head of the university (&quot;Now, wouldn&#x27;t you like to rule the roast?&quot;). During lunch (&quot;Merrily rings the luncheon bell&quot;), Cyril gets tipsy and inadvertently gives away his friends&#x27; identity by singing a bawdy song (&quot;Would you know the kind of maid&quot;). In the ensuing confusion, Princess Ida falls into a stream, and Hilarion rescues her (&quot;Oh joy, our chief is saved&quot;). Despite her rescue, Ida condemns Hilarion and his friends to death. Hilarion counters that without her love to live for, he welcomes death (&quot;Whom thou hast chained&quot;). King Hildebrand and his soldiers arrive, with Ida&#x27;s brothers in chains. He reminds her that she is bound by contract to marry Hilarion and gives her until the following afternoon to comply (&quot;Some years ago&quot;) or incur the guilt of fratricide. The defiant Ida replies that, although Hilarion saved her life and is fair, strong and tall, she would rather die than be his bride (&quot;To yield at once to such a foe&quot;).
===Act III===
Princess Ida reviews her student troops&#x27; readiness to meet Hildebrand&#x27;s soldiers in battle, but the terrified girls admit that they are afraid of fighting (&quot;Death to the invader!&quot;). Princess Ida is disgusted by their lack of courage and vows that, if necessary, she will fight Hildebrand&#x27;s army alone (&quot;I built upon a rock&quot;). Her father, King Gama, arrives with a message that Hildebrand prefers not to go to war against women. He reveals that Hildebrand has been torturing him by keeping him in luxury and giving him nothing to complain about (&quot;Whene&#x27;er I spoke sarcastic joke&quot;). He suggests that, instead of subjecting her women to all-out war, she pit her three strong, brave brothers against Hilarion and his friends, with Ida&#x27;s hand to depend on the outcome. Ida is insulted to be &quot;a stake for fighting men&quot; but realises that she has no alternative.

Hildebrand&#x27;s forces enter, together with Gama and his three sons (&quot;When anger spreads his wing&quot;). Hilarion, Cyril and Florian are still in their women&#x27;s robes, and King Gama and his sons ridicule them. In preparation for battle, Gama&#x27;s sons shed their heavy armour, saying that it is too uncomfortable for combat (&quot;This helmet I suppose&quot;). The fight ensues, with Hilarion, Cyril and Florian defeating Gama&#x27;s sons (&quot;It is our duty plain&quot;).

Her wager lost, Ida yields to Hilarion and bitterly asks Lady Blanche if she can resign her post with dignity. The delighted Blanche, who will succeed her as head of the university, assures her that she can. Ida laments the failure of her &quot;cherished scheme&quot; for which, had it been successful, &quot;Posterity would bow in gratitude!&quot;, but King Hildebrand points out the flaw in her logic:
:&quot;If you enlist all women in your cause,&quot;
:&quot;And make them all abjure tyrannic Man,&quot;
:&quot;The obvious question then arises, &quot;How&quot;
:&quot;Is this Posterity to be provided?&quot;&quot;
Princess Ida admits, &quot;I never thought of that!&quot; Hilarion makes an emotional appeal, urging her to give Man one chance, while Cyril observes that if she grows tired of the prince, she can return to Castle Adamant. Lady Psyche says that she, too, will return if Cyril does not behave himself, but Melissa swears that she will not return under any circumstances. Finally, Ida admits that she has been wrong, and declares that indeed she loves Hilarion, ending with a quotation directly from the Tennyson poem. All celebrate, (&quot;With joy abiding&quot;).

1 Starting in the 1920s, the D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company usually deleted this song in its performances.

2 D&#x27;Oyly Carte musical director, Harry Norris added prominent horn parts to the accompaniment to &quot;A Lady Fair&quot;. They were expunged by Malcolm Sargent but subsequently restored by Royston Nash in the 1970s. These are customarily referred to as the &quot;Norris&quot; horn parts, though they may have been written by Geoffrey Toye.

3 The first line of this song is often erroneously sung as &quot;Now wouldn&#x27;t you like to rule the roost&quot; instead of &quot;roast&quot; (rhymes with &quot;clear the coast&quot; in the next couplet). This typographical error appeared in early vocal scores and still appears in a current Chappell vocal score edition, although other scores have generally corrected it.

*27. &quot;With joy abiding&quot; [Reprise of &quot;Expressive glances&quot;] (Ensemble)

4 In the original production, No. 22 &quot;followed&quot; No. 23. The present order first appeared in vocal scores published after the first London revival in 1919.

Gilbert claimed that &quot;If you give me your attention&quot; was a satiric self-reference, saying: &quot;I thought it my duty to live up to my reputation&quot;. Tom Lehrer performs a parody of the same song called &quot;The Professor&#x27;s Song&quot;. Music from the overture of &quot;Ida&quot; is heard in &quot;Mickey, Donald, Goofy: The Three Musketeers&quot;.

==Versions of the text==
&quot;Princess Ida&quot; was not revived in London during the authors&#x27; lifetimes, and there were no substantive changes to the text after the premiere. The one alteration was purely cosmetic: the first act had originally been called a &quot;Prologue&quot;. It was re-designated Act I, with a consequent renumbering of the remaining acts.

At around the time of the first London revival, in 1919, there were changes to the running order of Act III. As written originally, the sequence of Act III is as follows:

# &quot;Death to the invader&quot;
# Princess Ida addresses the girls and then dismisses them
# &quot;I built upon a rock&quot; (Princess)
# The girls re-enter, shortly followed by King Gama
# &quot;When e&#x27;er I spoke sarcastic joke&quot; (King Gama, Ladies&#x27; Chorus)
# Dialogue in which the Princess agrees to let her brothers fight for her
# &quot;When anger spreads his wing&quot; (Double chorus)
# Dialogue preceding the fight
# &quot;This helmet, I suppose&quot; (Arac, Guron, Scynthius, Chorus)
# &quot;This is our duty plain&quot; (Chorus during the fight)
# Dialogue and finale

As re-ordered in the 1920s, the running order is as follows:
# &quot;Death to the invader&quot;
# Princess Ida addresses the girls and then dismisses them
# The girls re-enter, shortly followed by King Gama
# &quot;When e&#x27;er I spoke sarcastic joke&quot; (King Gama, Ladies&#x27; Chorus)
# Dialogue in which the Princess agrees to let her brothers fight for her
# &quot;I built upon a rock&quot; (Princess)
# &quot;When anger spreads his wing&quot; (Double chorus)
# &quot;This helmet, I suppose&quot; (Arac, Guron, Scynthius, Chorus)
# Dialogue preceding the fight
# &quot;This is our duty plain&quot; (Chorus during the fight)
# Dialogue and finale
The Chappell vocal score was re-issued to conform to this revised order.

The other significant change is that, at some point in the 1920s, it became traditional to delete Lady Blanche&#x27;s Act II song, &quot;Come, mighty must&quot; (although it continued to be printed in the vocal score). The song is included in the 1924 D&#x27;Oyly Carte recording, but on none of the three recordings the company made after that (1932, 1955, 1965).

==History of productions==
&quot;Princess Ida&quot; was not as successful as the Gilbert and Sullivan operas that had preceded it. In the midst of the unusually hot summer of 1884, Richard D&#x27;Oyly Carte closed the Savoy Theatre for a month, starting in mid-August. The opera had been running for seven months, a short period by the partnership&#x27;s past standards. The opera re-opened for just three weeks, starting in mid-September, before giving way to a revival of &quot;The Sorcerer&quot; (revised) and &quot;Trial by Jury&quot;. Gilbert designed the costumes himself. Act I and Act III sets were by the Drury Lane designer Henry Emden, while the Act II set was by Hawes Craven. A New York production ran briefly in 1884, and there was a second American production in 1887. As had happened with their earlier operas in America, Carte, Gilbert and Sullivan could do nothing to stop producers from mounting unauthorised productions, since there was no international copyright treaty at the time. The U.S. courts held that the act of publication made the opera freely available for production by anyone. In Australia, &quot;Princess Ida&quot;&#x27;s first authorized performance was on 16 July 1887 at the Princess Theatre, Melbourne, produced by J. C. Williamson.

Provincial tours of &quot;Princess Ida&quot; began in early 1884 and ended by mid-1885. The opera was revived on tour in December 1895, remaining in the touring repertory through 1896. It re-appeared in late 1897 or early 1898, and from then on was never out of the D&#x27;Oyly Carte touring repertory through the early years of the twentieth century. The first London revival, however, did not come until 30 December 1919. From then on, it was included in every D&#x27;Oyly Carte touring season until the company disbanded at the outbreak of war in 1939. New costumes were designed by Percy Anderson in 1921.
During World War II, the Company played a smaller repertory. The scenery and costumes for &quot;Princess Ida&quot;, which were in storage, were destroyed by enemy action over the winter of 1940–41. A new production was mounted at the Savoy Theatre on 27 September 1954. A guest artist, opera singer Victoria Sladen, was engaged to sing the title role for the London season. For the 1954 revival, the Act II line &quot;And the niggers they&#x27;ll be bleaching by and by,&quot; was changed to &quot;And they&#x27;ll practice what they&#x27;re preaching by and by,&quot; to accommodate the sensibilities of modern audiences, following similar changes in other Gilbert and Sullivan works. After the 1954 revival, &quot;Princess Ida&quot; was an irregular presence in the D&#x27;Oyly Carte repertory. While it never went unperformed more than two or three seasons at a time, it was usually performed only in London and a few other major cities. The demands of the title role were considered unusual by Gilbert and Sullivan standards, and often the Company brought in guest artists to play it. The company&#x27;s final performances of the opera were in February–April 1977. The company&#x27;s reduced repertory in its final five seasons did not accommodate it.

The film director Ken Russell staged &quot;Princess Ida&quot; for English National Opera in 1992, conducted by Jane Glover. The radical contemporary concept involved an American-Japanese theme park version of Buckingham Palace, with a chorus of Madonna lookalikes (led by Rosemary Joshua as Ida) studying in the Tower of London; Gama (alternating Nickolas Grace and Richard Suart) operated a sushi chain. The production, unanimously reviled by critics, was quickly dropped from ENO&#x27;s repertoire. Other professional companies have produced &quot;Princess Ida&quot;, including American Savoyards in the 1950s and 1960s, Light Opera of Manhattan in the 1970s and 1980s, New York Gilbert and Sullivan Players since the 1980s, Ohio Light Opera (which recorded the piece in 2000), the Gilbert and Sullivan Opera Company at the International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival in 2003 and 2009, and others.

The following table shows the history of the D&#x27;Oyly Carte productions in Gilbert&#x27;s lifetime:
==Historical casting==
The following tables show the casts of the principal original productions and D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company touring repertory at various times through to the company&#x27;s 1982 closure.

==Recordings==
&quot;Princess Ida&quot; has received fewer professional recordings than most of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas. The D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company recorded the piece four times, in 1924, 1932, 1955 and 1965, but the later two recordings have not been as well received as the earlier two. The BBC broadcast the piece in 1966 and 1989, but the recordings are unavailable. Ohio Light Opera recorded the opera in 2000.

The 1982 Brent Walker Productions video is considered to be one of the weakest of the series. More recent professional productions have been recorded on video by the International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival.

<doc id="318031" wikidata="Q313633" url="?curid=318031" title="Pedro Fernandes de Queirós">
<text>Pedro Fernandes de Queirós () (1563–1614) was a Portuguese navigator in the service of Spain. He is best known for leading several Spanish voyages of discovery in the Pacific Ocean, in particular the 1595–1596 voyage of Álvaro de Mendaña y Neira, and for the 1605–1606 expedition that crossed the Pacific in search of Terra Australis.

==Early life==
Queirós (or Quirós as he signed) was born in Évora, Portugal in 1563. As the Portuguese and Spanish monarchies had been unified under the king of Spain in 1580 (following the vacancy of the Portuguese throne, which lasted for sixty years, until 1640, when the Portuguese monarchy was restored), Queirós entered Spanish service as a young man and became an experienced seaman and navigator.

In April 1595, he joined Álvaro de Mendaña y Neira on his voyage to colonize the Solomon Islands, serving as chief pilot. After Mendaña&#x27;s death in October 1595, Queirós is credited with taking command and saving the only remaining ship of the expedition, arriving in the Philippines in February 1596. Isabel Barreto, Mendaña&#x27;s wife, accompanied the expedition and was accused of causing the crew&#x27;s low morale by her selfishness and strict discipline.

==The search for Terra Australis==
Queirós spent eighteen months in the Philippines, but returned to Spain in 1598, via Mexico. Upon his return to Spain, he petitioned King Philip III to support another voyage into the Pacific, hoping to find a large southern continent to claim for Spain. A devout Catholic, Queirós also visited Rome in 1600, where he obtained the support of the Pope, Clement VIII, for further explorations. He greatly impressed the Spanish Ambassador in Rome, the Duke of Sesa, who described him as a “man of good judgement, experienced in his profession, hard working, quiet and disinterested.” While in Rome Queirós also first wrote his &quot;Treatise on Navigation&quot; as a letter to the king, further reinforcing his reputation as a navigator, and invented two navigational tools.

In March 1603, Queirós was finally authorized to return to Peru to organize another expedition, with the intention of finding Terra Australis, the mythical &quot;great south land,&quot; and claiming it for Spain and the Church. Queirós was shipwrecked in the West Indies, but made it to Peru by March 1605. Queirós&#x27;s party of 160 men on three ships, &quot;San Pedro y San Pablo&quot; (150 tons), &quot;San Pedro&quot; (120 tons), and the tender (or launch) &quot;Los Tres Reyes&quot; left Callao on 21 December 1605.

In January 1606, the expedition came upon Henderson Island and Ducie Island, and then Rakahanga (Northern Cook Islands), and the Buen Viaje Islands (Butaritari and Makin) in the present-day island nation of Kiribati. It is also probable that his expedition sighted Tahiti and other islands in the Tuamotu archipelago. Queirós narrowly missed the Marquesas, as well as New Zealand, thanks to a change in his planned itinerary.

In May 1606, the expedition reached the islands later called the New Hebrides and now known as the independent nation of Vanuatu. Queirós landed on a large island which he took to be part of the southern continent, and named it Australia del Espíritu Santo. In his printed memorials, notably the Eighth (which was published in Italy, Holland, France, Germany and England), this was altered to &quot;Austrialia del Espíritu Santo&quot; (The Australian Land of the Holy Spirit), a pun on &quot;Austria&quot;, in honor of King Philip III, who was of the House of Hapsburg or &#x27;Austria&#x27; in Spanish. The island is still called Espiritu Santo. Here he stated his intention to establish a colony, to be called Nova Jerusalem. He seems to have identified &quot;Australia/Austrialia del Espíritu Santo&quot; with the huge northward extension of the Austral continent joining it to New Guinea, as depicted in maps like those of Gerard de Jode and Petrus Plancius. For, as he said in his Tenth Memorial (page 5): “New Guinea is the top end of the Austral Land of which I treat&quot;.

Queirós&#x27; religious fervour found expression with the founding of a new Order of Chivalry, the Knights of the Holy Ghost. The Order&#x27;s purpose was to protect the new colony. However, within weeks the idea of a colony was abandoned due to the hostility of the Ni-Vanuatu and to disagreements among the crew.

After six weeks Queirós&#x27; ships put to sea to explore the coastline. On the night of 11 June 1606, Queirós in the &quot;San Pedro y San Pablo&quot; became separated from the other ships in bad weather and was unable (or so he later said) to return to safe anchorage at Espiritu Santo. In reality, the crew mutinied, with the unfavorable wind conditions just giving them an opportunity to do so. The captain on the &quot;San Pedro y San Pablo&quot; named Diego de Prado, aware of the crew&#x27;s plans, had already transferred to Torres&#x27; ship, and so did the expedition&#x27;s surgeon. Queirós&#x27; ship, with Queirós being held in his cabin, then sailed to Acapulco, Mexico, where she arrived in November 1606. In the account of Diego de Prado, which is highly critical of Queirós, mutiny and poor leadership is given as the reason for Queirós&#x27;s disappearance.

Two weeks later, his second-in-command, Luis Váez de Torres, after searching in vain for Queirós and assuming Queirós (or rather the crew of his ship) had decided to go their own way, left Espiritu Santo. Torres successfully reached Manila, the center of the Spanish East Indies in May 1607, after charting the southern coastline of New Guinea on the way and in doing so sailing through the strait that now bears his name, between Australia and New Guinea. Torres was unaware of his proximity to Australia&#x27;s northern coast, just over the horizon from his route.

==Later life==
Pedro Fernandes de Quirós returned to Madrid in 1607. Regarded as a crank, he spent the next seven years in poverty, writing numerous accounts of his voyage and begging King Philip III for money for a new voyage, sending the king more than 65 letters over a seven-year period. He was finally despatched to Peru with letters of support, but the king had no real intention of funding another expedition, as the royal council feared that Spain could not afford new discoveries in the Pacific. Quirós died on the way, in Panama, in 1614. He had married Doña Ana Chacon de Miranda of Madrid in 1589; the couple had one son and one daughter. His son Lucas de Quirós, who participated in the 1605 expedition, was knighted an Alférez Real and became a regarded cosmographer in Lima.

==Accounts of Queirós&#x27;s voyage==
There are a number of documents describing the Queirós – Torres voyages still in existence. Most significant are
* Queirós&#x27; many subsequent Memorials to the King Philip III regarding the voyage,
* Torres&#x27; letter to the King of Spain from 12 July 1607,
* Diego de Prado&#x27;s narrative and 4 charts of New Guinea,
* Juan Luis Arias de Loyola&#x27;s memorial to King Philip IV (written about 1630 and based on discussions between Queirós and Loyola).

1617 may be the date of the first English translation of one of Queirós’ memorials, as &quot;Terra Australis Incognita&quot;, or &quot;A New Southerne Discoverie&quot;.
A short account of Queirós’ voyage and discoveries was published in English by Samuel Purchas in 1625 in &quot;Haklvytvs posthumus&quot;, or, &quot;Pvrchas his Pilgrimes&quot;, vol. iv, p. 1422-1432. This account also appears to be based on a letter by Queirós to the King in 1610, the eighth on the matter.

Some time between 1762 and 1765, written accounts of the Queirós-Torres expedition were seen by British Admiralty Hydrographer Alexander Dalrymple. Dalrymple provided a sketch map which included the Queirós-Torres voyages to Joseph Banks who undoubtedly passed this information to James Cook.

===Memorials===
Queirós sent at least 50, possibly 65, memorials to the King between 1607 and 1614. Although most were written manuscripts, Queirós paid to have fourteen printed and presented to the King. Copies of thirteen of these memorials are known to have survived. Scholars have numbered these memorials in different ways according to the memorials available to them for study, and those publicly known at the time. 1617 may be the date of the first English translation of one of Queirós&#x27;s memorials, as &quot;Terra Australis Incognita&quot;, or &quot;A New Southerne Discoverie&quot;.
A short account of Queirós&#x27;s voyage and discoveries was published in English by Samuel Purchas in 1625 in &quot;Haklvytvs posthumus&quot;, or, &quot;Pvrchas his Pilg&quot;rimes, vol. iv, p. 1422-1432. This account also appears to be based on a letter by Queirós to the King in 1610, the eighth on the matter.

The table below gives a summary of the memorials, including the classification systems used by four different scholars: Celsus Kelly in 1965, Frances Mary Hellessey Dunn in 1961, Justo Zaragoza in 1876 and Phyllis Mander-Jones in 1930.

==Theory that Queirós discovered Australia==
In the 19th century, some Australian Catholics claimed that Queirós had in fact discovered Australia, in advance of the Protestants Willem Janszoon, Abel Tasman, and James Cook. The Catholic Archbishop of Sydney from 1884 to 1911, Patrick Francis Moran, asserted this to be a fact, and it was taught in Catholic schools for many years. He claimed that the real site of Queirós&#x27; New Jerusalem was near Gladstone in Queensland, supported by elements of Queirós&#x27; description of the land he had discovered, such as his assertion that &quot;its length is as much as all Europe and Asia Minor as far as the Caspian and Persia, with all the islands of the Mediterranean and the ocean which encompasses, including the two islands of England and Ireland. That hidden part is the fourth corner of the world&quot;.

==Queirós in modern literature==

Building on this tradition, the Australian poet James McAuley (1917–1976) wrote an epic called &quot;Captain Quiros&quot; (1964), in which he depicted Queirós as a martyr for the cause of Catholic Christian civilisation (although he did not repeat the claim that Queirós had discovered Australia). The heavily political overtones of the poem caused it to be coldly received at a time when much politics in Australia was still coloured by Catholic-Protestant sectarianism.

The Australian writer John Toohey published a novel, &quot;Quiros&quot;, in 2002.

The British writer Robert Graves describes the 1595 expedition in his historical novel, &quot;The Islands of Unwisdom&quot;, written in 1949. In its introduction he describes his sources.

==Namesake==

The Spanish Navy gunboat &quot;Quirós&quot;, commissioned in 1896, was named for Queirós, using the Spanish spelling of his surname. After she was sold to the United States, she retained the name as in United States Navy service from 1900 to 1923.

==In Popular Culture==
Queirós is mentioned in the 1976 movie King Kong as discovering Skull Island and encountering Kong after being blown south from Tematagi in 1605.

<text>The University of Wales () is a confederal university based in Cardiff, Wales. Founded by royal charter in 1893 as a federal university with three constituent colleges – Aberystwyth, Bangor and Cardiff – the university was the first university established in Wales, one of the four countries in the United Kingdom. The university was, prior to the break up of the federation, the second largest university in the UK.

A federal university similar to the University of London, the University of Wales was in charge of examining students, while its colleges were in charge of teaching. The University of Wales was the only university in Wales prior to the establishment of the University of Glamorgan in 1992.

Former colleges under the University of Wales included most of the now independent universities in Wales: Aberystwyth University (formerly University of Wales, Aberystwyth), Bangor University (formerly University of Wales, Bangor), St David&#x27;s University College (later University of Wales, Lampeter, and now merged with University of Wales Trinity Saint David), Cardiff University (formerly University of Wales, Cardiff), Swansea University (formerly University of Wales, Swansea), Cardiff Metropolitan University (formerly University of Wales Institute, Cardiff) and University of Wales, Newport (which merged with Glamorgan University in April 2013 to form the University of South Wales).

In 2007, the University of Wales changed from a federal structure to a confederal one, and many of the constituent colleges became independent universities. Following a number of controversies in the late 2000s involving overseas affiliates, cheating and student visas, a decision was made to abolish the university as it then existed.

From August 2017 it has been functionally integrated with the University of Wales Trinity Saint David. The Higher Education Statistics Agency recorded zero students registered with the University of Wales in the UK in 2018/19, but 3,345 students registered on transnational education courses outside the UK.

It also collaborated with the University of Malaya in 2013 to establish the International University of Malaya-Wales (IUMW), a private university in Malaysia.

==History==
=== Origins ===
The University of Wales was founded in Wales in 1893 as a federal university with three foundation colleges: University College Wales (now Aberystwyth University), which had been founded in 1872; University College North Wales (now Bangor University); University College South Wales and Monmouthshire (now Cardiff University). The last two had been founded following the Aberdare Report in 1881. Prior to the foundation of the federal university, these three colleges had prepared students for the examinations of the University of London. The University of Wales held its first graduation ceremony in 1897, awarding a BSc to Maria Dawson.

A fourth college, Swansea (now Swansea University), was added in 1920 and in 1931 the Welsh National School of Medicine was incorporated. In 1967, the Welsh College of Advanced Technology entered the federal university as the University of Wales Institute of Science and Technology (UWIST), also in Cardiff. In 1971, St David&#x27;s College (now part of the University of Wales: Trinity Saint David), Wales&#x27; oldest degree-awarding institution, suspended its own degree-awarding powers and entered the University of Wales.

A financial crisis in the late eighties caused UWIST and University College Cardiff to merge in 1988, forming the University of Wales College Cardiff (UWCC). In 1992, the university lost its position as the only university in Wales when the Polytechnic of Wales became the University of Glamorgan (now part of the new University of South Wales).

=== Re-organisation ===

The university was composed of colleges until 1996, when the university was reorganised with a two-tier structure of member institutions in order to absorb the Cardiff Institute of Higher Education (which became the University of Wales Institute, Cardiff (UWIC), now known as Cardiff Metropolitan University) and the Gwent College of Higher Education (which became the University of Wales College, Newport (UWCN)). The existing colleges became constituent institutions, and the two new member institutions became university colleges. In 2003, both of these colleges became full constituent institutions and in 2004, UWCN received permission from the Privy Council to change its name to the University of Wales, Newport.

Cardiff University (which had been known briefly as the University of Wales, Cardiff, between 1996 and 1999) and the University of Wales College of Medicine (UWCM) merged on 1 August 2004. The merged institution, known as Cardiff University, ceased to be a constituent institution and joined a new category of &#x27;Affiliated/Linked Institutions&#x27;. While the new institution continued to award University of Wales degrees in medicine and related subjects, students joining Cardiff from 2005 to study other subjects were awarded Cardiff University degrees.

At the same time, the university admitted four new institutions. Thus, North East Wales Institute of Higher Education (NEWI), Swansea Institute of Higher Education and Trinity College, Carmarthen (who were all previously Associated Institutions) along with the Royal Welsh College of Music &amp; Drama (which was previously a Validated Institution) were admitted as full members of the university on 27 July 2004.

The Royal Welsh College of Music &amp; Drama subsequently left the university in January 2007. More changes followed in September 2007 when the university changed from a federal structure to a confederation of independent institutions, allowing those individual institutions which had gained the status of universities in their own right to use the title of university – these institutions are Aberystwyth University, Bangor University, Glyndŵr University (formerly the North East Wales Institute of Higher Education (NEWI)), Swansea Metropolitan University and Swansea University.

In November 2008, Aberystwyth, Bangor and Swansea Universities decided to exercise their right to register students to study for their own awarded degrees.

=== Scandal and merger ===

In 2010 the university broke its links with a Malaysian college after it was discovered its director had bogus qualifications, while a Thai institution linked to the university was found to be operating illegally. In June 2011, a report from the Quality Assurance Agency found that the university had not run the necessary checks on institutes delivering courses it validated, and instructed it to review all of its validation arrangements. In October, the university announced that it would cease validating courses, just before news broke that one of its affiliated colleges in London was involved in a visa fraud. This led to calls from the vice chancellors of the universities of Aberystwyth, Bangor, Cardiff, Glamorgan and Swansea for the University of Wales to be wound up.

It was announced later in October that the University of Wales would be &quot;effectively abolished&quot;, and merged into the University of Wales Trinity Saint David (UWTSD), which itself merged with Swansea Metropolitan University on 1 August 2013. In August 2017, a &quot;deed of union&quot; was approved by the University of Wales and UWTSD, which integrated the two universities into a single functional body prior to a full legal constitutional merger; as of February 2020 this full merger has not been finalised. As part of the work towards merger, custody of the university&#x27;s Gregynog Hall and its estate was transferred to the newly created Gregynog Trust in July 2019.

==Central services==
The administrative office of the University of Wales is located in Cardiff&#x27;s Civic Centre. In addition to its work with the accredited institutions in Wales, the university also validates schemes of study at some 130 centres in the UK and across the world, though it is currently in the process of bringing this current validation model to a close. It runs a highly rated research centre, the Centre for Advanced Welsh and Celtic Studies (incorporating the Welsh Dictionary Unit), which is adjacent to the National Library of Wales in Aberystwyth. The first edition of &quot;Geiriadur Prifysgol Cymru&quot; (&quot;The University of Wales Dictionary&quot;), which has the same status for Welsh as the OED does for English, was completed in 2002, eighty-two years after it had been started. The University of Wales Press was founded in 1922 and publishes around seventy books a year in both English and Welsh. The university also has a study and conference centre at Gregynog, near Newtown.

==Former colleges and member institutions==
Former colleges and member institutions:
In September 2007, three universities applied for a change to their royal charters to give them the power to award their own degrees, instead of University of Wales degrees. Aberystwyth University, Bangor University, and Swansea University now all award their own degrees.

The University of Wales Trinity Saint David (UWTSD) already had its own degree awarding powers, inherited from Saint David&#x27;s College, Lampeter, which were put into abeyance when Lampeter joined the University of Wales in 1971. From then on, Lampeter awarded Wales degrees but its own licences and diplomas. When the merger between UWTSD and the University of Wales is complete, the new unified institution will award degrees under the historic 1828 royal charter of Saint David&#x27;s College.

Cardiff University and the University of Wales College of Medicine were full members of the University of Wales but left following their merger in 2004. The merged institute awarded its own degrees to students admitted since 2005, except in medicine and related subjects which continued to be awarded University of Wales degrees until 2011. Cardiff University had previously merged with the University of Wales Institute of Science and Technology, another college of the University of Wales, in 1988.

The Royal Welsh College of Music &amp; Drama became a full member of the University of Wales in 2004 having awarded degrees validated by the university since the 1970s, but left in 2007, when it merged with the University of Glamorgan, although retaining its separate identity. The University of Glamorgan subsequently merged with the University of Wales, Newport, another former member of the University of Wales, in 2013 to form the University of South Wales

===Former validated institutions===
A number of institutions were not accredited by the university, but had some of their courses validated by it. There was some publicity and questioning of the quality of these external courses, and in October 2011, in response to changes in higher education in Wales, including the university&#x27;s merger, the university announced that it would launch a new academic strategy which would see the institution only award degrees to students on courses designed and fully controlled by the university. All existing students at validated institutions are able to continue the remainder of their studies for a University of Wales award and will have continuous support.

<text>The Lamniformes (, from Greek &quot;lamna&quot; &quot;fish of prey&quot;) are an order of sharks commonly known as mackerel sharks (which may also refer specifically to the family Lamnidae). It includes some of the most familiar species of sharks, such as the great white as well as less familiar ones, such as the goblin shark and megamouth shark.

Members of the order are distinguished by possessing two dorsal fins, an anal fin, five gill slits, eyes without nictitating membranes, and a mouth extending behind the eyes. Species in two families of Lamniformes – Lamnidae and Alopiidae – are distinguished for maintaining a higher body temperature than the surrounding waters.

Members of the group include macropredators, generally of medium-large size, including the largest macropredatory shark ever, the extinct &quot;Otodus megalodon,&quot; as well as large planktivores.

Although some authors have argued that the Late Jurassic &quot;Palaeocarcharias&quot; should be considered the oldest known lamniform, this is disputed. The earliest unambiguous records of lamniformes are from the Early Cretaceous. Lamniformes underwent a major adaptive radiation during the Cretaceous and became prominent elements of oceanic ecosystems. They reached their highest diversity during the Late Cretaceous, but severely declined during the K-Pg extinction, before rebounding to a high but lower diversity peak during the Paleogene. Lamniformes have severely declined over the last 20 million years, with only 15 species alive today, compared to over 290 extant species in the Carcharhiniformes, which have evolved into medium and large body sizes during the same timeframe. The causes of the decline are uncertain, but are likely to have involved both biotic factors like competition and non-biotic factors like temperature and sea level.

==Species==

== Phylogeny ==
Below is a cladogram showing relationships within Lamniformes. The topology of extant families is based on Vella &amp; Vella (2020) and the placements of Cretoxyrhinidae and Otodontidae are based on Ferrón (2017), Cooper (2020), and Greenfield (2022).

==Sustainable consumption==
In 2010, Greenpeace International added the shortfin mako shark (&quot;Isurus oxyrinchus&quot;) to its seafood red list.

<text>Swansea University () is a public research university located in Swansea, Wales, United Kingdom. 

It was chartered as University College of Swansea in 1920, as the fourth college of the University of Wales. In 1996, it changed its name to the University of Wales Swansea following structural changes within the University of Wales. The title of Swansea University was formally adopted on 1 September 2007 when the University of Wales became a non-membership confederal institution and the former members became universities in their own right.

Swansea University has three faculties across its two campuses which are located on the coastline of Swansea Bay. The Singleton Park Campus is set in the grounds of Singleton Park to the west of Swansea city centre. The £450 million Bay Campus, which opened in September 2015, is located next to Jersey Marine Beach to the east of Swansea in the Neath Port Talbot area. The annual income of the institution for 2022–23 was £412.3 million of which £67.1 million was from research grants and contracts, with an expenditure of £348 million.

It is the third largest university in Wales in terms of number of students. It offers about 450 undergraduate courses, 280 postgraduate taught and 150 postgraduate research courses to undergraduate and postgraduate students.

==History==
===Foundations===

The University College, Swansea, (as it was known then), was established in 1920, opening its doors on 5 October. At the time, it was the youngest of the four colleges of the University of Wales. It was established on the recommendations of a Royal Commission set up in 1916. The college was founded on what were perceived as the needs and the wants of the local area, and Swansea&#x27;s main industries in particular.

The Park Campus houses the oldest parts of the university&#x27;s estate, including Singleton Abbey, a large eighteenth-century mansion which was the ancestral home of the Vivian family, having been bought by the prominent industrialist, John Henry Vivian.

Swansea University&#x27;s foundation stone was laid by King George V in July 1920, welcoming 89 students, of whom eight were female. Subjects taught from the beginning of the college were the sciences, mathematics, metallurgy and engineering. The professors were A.R. Richardson (mathematics), E.J. Evans (physics), J.E. Coates (chemistry), A.E. Trueman (geology), C.A. Edwards (metallurgy) and F. Bacon (engineering).

The university was granted a coat of arms by the College of Heralds in 1921 with the motto &quot;Gweddw Crefft Heb Ei Dawn&quot;, translated as &#x27;technical skill is bereft without culture.&#x27;

Arts subjects were not taught immediately in 1920, but started in the following &#x27;session&#x27;, 1921–22. The first professors in those initial departments were David Emrys Evans (Classics), W.D. Thomas (English language and literature), Henry Lewis (Welsh), E. Ernest Hughes (History), F.A. Cavenagh (education) and Mary Williams (French). Williams was the first woman to be appointed to a chair in the United Kingdom. This met with some reaction from senior men at the college, one of whom she would later marry.

Saunders Lewis, the well-known Welsh language writer and activist, became a member of staff in 1922 although he ran up against controversy in 1936/37 for trying to set fire to a Royal Air Force bombing school on the Llŷn Peninsula. He was tried at the Old Bailey and sent to prison for nine months.

When Singleton Abbey and its surrounding land was handed to the college in 1923, arts subjects were moved there from the college&#x27;s temporary site in Mount Pleasant. Student numbers remained relatively small until the Second World War.

Swansea acquired departments of philosophy in 1925, German in 1931, economics in 1937, social policy in 1947, political theory and government in 1954 – the same year that a civil engineering and a geography department were added. In 1961 Swansea became a centre for Russian and East European studies, while Italian and Spanish joined the Department of French.

There were many notable staff members at the university in the period, including the long-serving female professor of botany, Florence Mockeridge. Another was Glanmor Williams (history) who retired in 1982. Other well-known staff members were the author of novels such as &quot;Lucky Jim&quot; and &quot;That Uncertain Feeling&quot;, Kingsley Amis, who lectured in English in the 1950s and early 1960s; Rush Rhees, who was a member of staff from 1940 to 1966, an expert on philosophy of Ludwig Wittgenstein; and Kenneth O. Morgan (now Lord Morgan of Aberdyfi) who was a junior history lecturer from 1958 to 1966.

===Post-war campus development===
In 1947, John Fulton, the university principal, had designs on creating the UK&#x27;s first self-contained university campus. Located in the vast expanse of Singleton Park, the university only had 2 permanent buildings; Singleton Abbey and the library.

The 1960s saw the university embark on a large campus development programme, aiming to fulfill Fulton&#x27;s plan of becoming a self-contained community within the city. Along with new halls of residence, a Maths and Science Tower was built, with College House – later renamed Fulton House.

==Campus==

For most of its history, Swansea University operated exclusively from the Singleton Park Campus. However, owing to rapid expansion, the university developed a 65-acre, £450 million beachfront science and innovation Bay Campus which opened in September 2015. Since then, Swansea University has operated as a dual-campus university with the &#x27;Park Campus&#x27; located in its traditional Singleton Park grounds, and the Bay Campus, at Crymlyn Burrows.

The Bay campus has been developed on a 65-acre beachfront site between Fabian Way and Jersey Marine beach at Crymlyn Burrows. It houses much of the Faculty of Science and Engineering and the School of Management, a Great Hall seating 800, a library offering views over a Site of Special Scientific Interest, and student accommodation, as well as several research institutes.

<text>Fibromyalgia (FM) is a medical syndrome that causes chronic widespread pain, accompanied by fatigue, awakening unrefreshed, and cognitive symptoms. Other symptoms can include headaches, lower abdominal pain or cramps, and depression. People with fibromyalgia can also experience insomnia and general hypersensitivity. The causes of fibromyalgia are unknown, with several pathophysiologies proposed.
Fibromyalgia was first defined in 1990, with updated criteria in 2011, 2016, and 2019. Fibromyalgia is estimated to affect 2 to 4% of the population. Women are affected more than men. Rates appear similar across areas of the world and among varied cultures. 
Symptoms of fibromyalgia are persistent in nearly all patients.

The treatment of fibromyalgia is symptomatic and multidisciplinary. The European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology strongly recommends aerobic and strengthening exercise. Weak recommendations are given for mindfulness, psychotherapy, acupuncture, hydrotherapy, and meditative exercise such as qigong, yoga, and tai chi. The use of medication in the treatment of fibromyalgia is debated, although antidepressants can improve quality of life. Other medications commonly considered helpful in managing fibromyalgia include serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and muscle relaxants. Q10 coenzyme and vitamin D supplements may reduce pain and improve quality of life.
==Terminology==
The term &quot;fibromyalgia&quot; was derived from Neo-Latin &quot;fibro-&quot;, meaning &quot;fibrous tissues&quot;; Greek μυο- &quot;myo-&quot;, &quot;muscle&quot;; and Greek άλγος &quot;algos&quot;, &quot;pain&quot;; thus, the term literally means &quot;muscle and fibrous connective tissue pain&quot;. Thus arguably this term is inaccurate and misleading, as it only reflects a part of the syndrome symptom set. 

The term FM is increasingly used.

==Classification==
===Formal classification===
Fibromyalgia is classified as a disorder of pain processing due to abnormalities in how pain signals are processed in the central nervous system. The International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) includes fibromyalgia in the category of &quot;Chronic widespread pain,&quot; code MG30.01. 

===Clusters===
People with fibromyalgia differ in several dimensions: severity, adjustment, symptom profile, psychological profile, and response to treatment. There may be clear clusters of symptom characteristics within fibromyalgia.

==Signs and symptoms==
The defining symptoms of fibromyalgia are chronic widespread pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbance. Other symptoms may include heightened pain in response to tactile pressure (allodynia), cognitive problems, musculoskeletal stiffness, environmental sensitivity, hypervigilance, sexual dysfunction, and visual symptoms. Some people with fibromyalgia experience post-exertional malaise, in which symptoms flare up a day or longer after physical exercise.

=== Pain ===
Fibromyalgia is predominantly a chronic pain disorder. According to the NHS, widespread pain is one major symptom, which could feel like an ache, a burning sensation, or a sharp, stabbing pain. Patients are also highly sensitive to pain, and the slightest touch can cause pain. Pain also tends to linger for longer when a patient experiences pain. The pain associated with fibromyalgia is often a constant dull ache that has lasted for at least three months, occurring on both sides of the body and above and below the waist.

=== Fatigue ===
Fatigue is one of the defining symptoms of fibromyalgia. Patients may experience physical or mental fatigue. Physical fatigue can present as a feeling of exhaustion after exercise or limitation in daily activities. Fibromyalgia fatigue can range from feeling mildly tired to flu-like exhaustion. Severe fatigue may come on suddenly and make it difficult to be active at all. The impact of fatigue can be severe and pose more of a problem than the pain. Fatigue is a complicated, multifactorial, and vexing symptom that is highly prevalent (76%) and stubbornly persistent, as evidenced by longitudinal studies over 5 years. Fatigue does not improve with sleep or rest. Meds seem to have little impact on FM fatigue.

=== Sleep problems ===
Sleep problems are a core symptom of fibromyalgia. These include difficulty falling or staying asleep, awakening while sleeping, and waking up feeling unrefreshed. A meta-analysis compared quantitative and qualitative sleep metrics in people with fibromyalgia and healthy people. Individuals with fibromyalgia indicated lower sleep quality and efficiency, longer wake time after sleep start, shorter sleep duration, lighter sleep, and greater trouble initiating sleep when quantitatively assessed; and more difficulty initiating sleep when qualitatively assessed. Sleep problems may contribute to pain by decreased release of IGF-1 and human growth hormone, leading to decreased tissue repair. Improving sleep quality can help people with fibromyalgia manage pain.

=== Cognitive problems ===
Many people with fibromyalgia experience cognitive problems (known as &quot;fibrofog&quot; or brain fog). One study found that approximately 50% of fibromyalgia patients experienced subjective cognitive dysfunction and that it was associated with higher levels of pain and other fibromyalgia symptoms. The American Pain Society recognizes these problems as a major feature of fibromyalgia. About 75% of people with fibromyalgia report significant problems with concentration, memory, and multitasking. A 2018 meta-analysis found that the largest differences between people with fibromyalgia and healthy subjects were in inhibitory control, memory, and processing speed. It is hypothesized that the chronic pain in fibromyalgia compromises attention systems, resulting in cognitive problems.

=== Hypersensitivity ===
In addition to hyperalgesia, some people with fibromyalgia experience hypersensitivity to other stimuli, such as inner body feelings, bright lights, loud noises, perfumes, and cold. A review article found that they have a lower cold pain threshold. Other studies documented an acoustic hypersensitivity.

== Comorbidity ==
Fibromyalgia as a stand-alone diagnosis is uncommon, as most fibromyalgia patients often have other chronic overlapping pain problems or mental disorders. 

===Mental health===
Fibromyalgia is associated with mental health issues like anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, bipolar disorder, alexithymia, and depression. Patients with fibromyalgia are five times more likely to have major depression than the general population. Experiencing pain and limited energy from having fibromyalgia leads to less activity, leading to social isolation and increased stress levels, which tends to cause anxiety and depression. Fibromyalgia is sometimes a co-morbidity for affective mood disorders.

===Pain conditions===
Numerous chronic pain conditions are often comorbid with fibromyalgia. These include chronic tension headaches, myofascial pain syndrome, and temporomandibular disorders. Multiple sclerosis, post-polio syndrome, neuropathic pain, and Parkinson&#x27;s disease are four neurological disorders that have been linked to pain or fibromyalgia. 

===Syndromes with similar pathogenetic mechanisms===
Fibromyalgia largely overlaps with several syndromes that may share the same pathogenetic mechanisms. These include myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome and irritable bowel syndrome.

===Musculoskeletal disorders===
Comorbid fibromyalgia has been reported to occur in 20–30% of individuals with rheumatic diseases. It has been reported in people with noninflammatory musculoskeletal diseases.

===Gastrointestinal conditions===
The prevalence of fibromyalgia in gastrointestinal disease has been described mostly for celiac disease and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). IBS and fibromyalgia share similar pathogenic mechanisms, involving immune system mast cells, inflammatory biomarkers, hormones, and neurotransmitters such as serotonin. Changes in the gut biome alter serotonin levels, leading to autonomic nervous system hyperstimulation.

===Obesity===
Available data support a potential interplay between obesity and FM-related symptoms.

===Other conditions===
Other conditions that are associated with fibromyalgia include connective tissue disorders, cardiovascular autonomic abnormalities, obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome, restless leg syndrome and an overactive bladder.

==Risk factors==
The cause of fibromyalgia is unknown. However, several risk factors, genetic and environmental, have been identified.

===Genetics===
Genetics plays a major role in fibromyalgia and may explain up to 50% of the disease&#x27;s susceptibility. Fibromyalgia is potentially associated with polymorphisms of genes in the serotoninergic, dopaminergic and catecholaminergic systems. Several genes have been suggested as candidates for susceptibility to fibromyalgia. These include SLC6A4, TRPV2, MYT1L, NRXN3, and the 5-HT2A receptor 102T/C polymorphism. The heritability of fibromyalgia is estimated to be higher in patients younger than 50.

Nearly all the genes suggested as potential risk factors for fibromyalgia are associated with neurotransmitters and their receptors. Neuropathic pain and major depressive disorder often co-occur with fibromyalgia — the reason for this comorbidity appears to be due to shared genetic abnormalities, which leads to impairments in monoaminergic, glutamatergic, neurotrophic, opioid and proinflammatory cytokine signaling. In these vulnerable individuals, psychological stress or illness can cause abnormalities in inflammatory and stress pathways that regulate mood and pain. Eventually, a sensitization and kindling effect occurs in certain neurons leading to the establishment of fibromyalgia and sometimes a mood disorder.

FM and reduced pressure pain thresholds aggregate in families, and FM coaggregates with major mood disorder in families.

=== Stress ===
Stress may be an important precipitating factor in the development of fibromyalgia. A 2021 meta-analysis found psychological trauma to be strongly associated with fibromyalgia. People who suffered abuse in their lifetime were three times more likely to have fibromyalgia; people who suffered medical trauma or other stressors in their lifetime were about twice as likely.

Some authors have proposed that, because exposure to stressful conditions can alter the function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, the development of fibromyalgia may stem from stress-induced disruption of the HPA axis.

=== Personality and psychology===
Studies on personality and fibromyalgia have shown inconsistent results. Although some have suggested that fibromyalgia patients are more likely to have specific personality traits, it appears that in comparison to other diseases – when anxiety and depression are statistically controlled forpersonality has far less relevance.

A subset of people with fibromyalgia have prominent underlying psychological factors, but there are also a plethora of other important underlying mechanisms.

=== Other risk markers ===
Other risk markers for fibromyalgia include premature birth, female sex, childhood cognitive and psychosocial problems, primary pain disorders, multiregional pain, infectious illness, hypermobility of joints, iron deficiency, and small-fiber polyneuropathy. Metal-induced allergic inflammation has also been linked with fibromyalgia, especially in response to nickel but also inorganic mercury, cadmium, and lead. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, some have suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 virus may trigger fibromyalgia.

==Pathophysiology==
As of 2022, the pathophysiology of fibromyalgia has not yet been elucidated and several theories have been suggested. The prevailing view is that fibromyalgia is a condition resulting from an amplification of pain by the central nervous system. Substantial biological findings have backed up this notion, leading to development and adoption of the concept of nociplastic pain.

Fibromyalgia is associated with the deregulation of proteins related to complement and coagulation cascades, as well as to iron metabolism. An excessive oxidative stress response may cause dysregulation of many proteins.

=== Nervous system ===

==== Pain processing abnormalities ====
Chronic pain can be divided into three categories. Nociceptive pain is pain caused by inflammation or damage to tissues. Neuropathic pain is pain caused by nerve damage. Nociplastic pain (or central sensitization) is less understood and is the common explanation of the pain experienced in fibromyalgia. Because the three forms of pain can overlap, fibromyalgia patients may experience nociceptive (e.g., rheumatic illnesses) and neuropathic (e.g., small fiber neuropathy) pain, in addition to nociplastic pain.

==== Nociplastic pain (central sensitization) ====

Fibromyalgia can be viewed as a condition of nociplastic pain. Nociplastic pain is caused by an altered function of pain-related sensory pathways in the periphery and the central nervous system, resulting in hypersensitivity.

Nociplastic pain is commonly referred to as &quot;Nociplastic pain syndrome&quot; because it is coupled with other symptoms. These include fatigue, sleep disturbance, cognitive disturbance, hypersensitivity to environmental stimuli, anxiety, and depression. Nociplastic pain is caused by either (1) increased processing of pain stimuli or (2) decreased suppression of pain stimuli at several levels in the nervous system, or both.

==== Neuropathic pain ====
An alternative hypothesis to nociplastic pain views fibromyalgia as a stress-related dysautonomia with neuropathic pain features. This view highlights the role of autonomic and peripheral nociceptive nervous systems in the generation of widespread pain, fatigue, and insomnia. The description of small fiber neuropathy in a subgroup of fibromyalgia patients supports the disease neuropathic-autonomic underpinning. However, others claim that small fiber neuropathy occurs only in small groups of those with fibromyalgia.

==== Autonomic nervous system ====
Some suggest that fibromyalgia is caused or maintained by a decreased vagal tone, which is indicated by low levels of heart rate variability, signaling a heightened sympathetic response. Accordingly, several studies show that clinical improvement is associated with an increase in heart rate variability. Some examples of interventions that increase the heart rate variability and vagal tone are meditation, yoga, mindfulness, and exercise. 

====Reduced capacity in salience network====
In 2023 the Fibromyalgia: Imbalance of Threat and Soothing Systems (FITSS) model was suggested as a working hypothesis. According to the FITSS model, the salience network (also known as the midcingulo-insular network) may remain continuously hyperactive due to an imbalance in emotion regulation, which is reflected by an overactive &quot;threat&quot; system and an underactive &quot;soothing&quot; system. This hyperactivation, along with other mechanisms, may contribute to fibromyalgia.

Autistic people appear to have a higher than average incidence of fibromyalgia. This may be due to autistic burnout and other autistic loading reducing salience network capacity.

==== Neurotransmitters ====
Some neurochemical abnormalities that occur in fibromyalgia also regulate mood, sleep, and energy, thus explaining why mood, sleep, and fatigue problems are commonly co-morbid with fibromyalgia. Serotonin is the most widely studied neurotransmitter in fibromyalgia. It is hypothesized that an imbalance in the serotoninergic system may lead to the development of fibromyalgia. There is also some data that suggests altered dopaminergic and noradrenergic signaling in fibromyalgia. Supporting the monoamine related theories is the efficacy of monoaminergic antidepressants in fibromyalgia. Glutamate/creatine ratios within the bilateral ventrolateral prefrontal cortex were found to be significantly higher in fibromyalgia patients than in controls and may disrupt glutamate neurotransmission.

==== Neurophysiology ====
Neuroimaging studies have observed that fibromyalgia patients have increased grey matter in the right postcentral gyrus and left angular gyrus, and decreased grey matter in the right cingulate gyrus, right paracingulate gyrus, left cerebellum, and left gyrus rectus. These regions are associated with affective and cognitive functions and with motor adaptations to pain processing. Other studies have documented decreased grey matter of the default mode network in people with fibromyalgia. These deficits are associated with pain processing.

==== Neuroendocrine system ====
Studies on the neuroendocrine system and HPA axis in fibromyalgia have been inconsistent. The depressed function of the HPA axis results in adrenal insufficiency and potentially chronic fatigue. 

One study found fibromyalgia patients exhibited higher plasma cortisol, more extreme peaks and troughs, and higher rates of dexamethasone non-suppression. However, other studies have only found correlations between a higher cortisol awakening response and pain, and not any other abnormalities in cortisol. Increased baseline ACTH and increase in response to stress have been observed, and hypothesized to be a result of decreased negative feedback.

==== Oxidative stress ====
Pro-oxidative processes correlate with pain in fibromyalgia patients. Decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, increased superoxide activity, and increased lipid peroxidation production are observed. The high proportion of lipids in the central nervous system (CNS) makes the CNS especially vulnerable to free radical damage. Levels of lipid peroxidation products correlate with fibromyalgia symptoms.

=== Immune system ===
Inflammation has been suggested to have a role in the pathogenesis of fibromyalgia. People with fibromyalgia tend to have higher levels of inflammatory cytokines IL-6, and IL-8. There are also increased levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1 receptor antagonist. Increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines may increase sensitivity to pain, and contribute to mood problems. Anti-inflammatory interleukins such as IL-10 have also been associated with fibromyalgia.

A repeated observation shows that autoimmunity triggers such as traumas and infections are among the most frequent events preceding the onset of fibromyalgia. Neurogenic inflammation has been proposed as a contributing factor to fibromyalgia.

=== Digestive system ===

==== Gut microbiome ====
Though there is a lack of evidence in this area, it is hypothesized that gut bacteria may play a role in fibromyalgia. People with fibromyalgia are more likely to show dysbiosis, a decrease in microbiota diversity. There is a bidirectional interplay between the gut and the nervous system. Therefore, the gut can affect the nervous system, but the nervous system can also affect the gut. Neurological effects mediated via the autonomic nervous system as well as the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis are directed to intestinal functional effector cells, which in turn are under the influence of the gut microbiota.

==== Gut-brain axis ====
The gut-brain axis, which connects the gut microbiome to the brain via the enteric nervous system, is another area of research. Fibromyalgia patients have less varied gut flora and altered serum metabolome levels of glutamate and serine, implying abnormalities in neurotransmitter metabolism.

=== Energy metabolism ===

==== Low ATP in skeletal muscle ====
Patients with fibromyalgia experience exercise intolerance. Primary fibromyalgia is idiopathic (cause unknown), whereas secondary fibromyalgia is in association with a known underlying disorder (such as Ankylosing spondylitis). In patients with primary fibromyalgia, studies have found disruptions in energy metabolism within skeletal muscle, including: decreased levels of ATP, ADP, and phosphocreatine, and increased levels of AMP and creatine (use of creatine kinase and myokinase in the phosphagen system due to low ATP); increased pyruvate; as well as reduced capillary density impairing oxygen delivery to the muscle cells for oxidative phosphorylation.

==== Low ATP in brain ====
Despite being a small percentage of the body&#x27;s total mass, the brain consumes approximately 20% of the energy produced by the body. Parts of the brain—the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), thalamus, and insula—were studied using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in patients with fibromyalgia and compared to healthy controls. The fibromyalgia patients were found to have lower phosphocreatine (PCr) and lower creatine (Cr) than the control group. Phosphocreatine is used in the phosphagen system to produce ATP. The study found that low creatine and low phosphocreatine were associated with high pain, and that high stress, including PTSD, may contribute to these low levels. 

Low phosphocreatine levels may disrupt glutamate neurotransmission within the brains of those with fibromyalgia. Glutamate/creatine ratios within the bilateral ventrolateral prefrontal cortex were found to be significantly higher than in controls.

== Diagnosis ==
Diagnosis of fibromyalgia is hampered by the lack of any single pathological feature, laboratory finding, or biomarker. In most cases, people with fibromyalgia symptoms may have laboratory test results that appear normal and many of their symptoms may mimic those of other rheumatic conditions such as arthritis or osteoporosis.

Nonetheless specific diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia have evolved.

Among diagnosis methods in the US, the ACR 2016 criteria have been found to most accurately match pre-existing FM diagnoses, and have been judged as the best diagnosis criteria available. The UK RCP also recommends these criteria for FM diagnosis. A similar diagnostic approach is taken in Germany. 

Some people can move into and out of an FM diagnostic level over time as their symptoms vary. A definition of Chronic Widespread Pain has been discussed for less severe cases.

=== American College of Rheumatology 2016===
In 2016 the previous (2010) diagnostic criteria of the American College of Rheumatology were revised. The new criteria required all of the following:
# &quot;Generalized pain, defined as pain in at least 4 of 5 regions, is present.&quot;
# &quot;Symptoms have been present at a similar level for at least 3 months.&quot;
# &quot;Widespread pain index (WPI) ≥ 7 and symptom severity scale (SSS) score ≥ 5 OR WPI of 4–6 and SSS score ≥ 9.&quot;
# &quot;A diagnosis of fibromyalgia is valid irrespective of other diagnoses. A diagnosis of fibromyalgia does not exclude the presence of other clinically important illnesses.&quot;
The Widespread Pain Index (WPI) had been introduced by the American College of Rheumatology in 2010. It measures the number of body regions experiencing pain, out of a total of 19: left and right shoulder girdle, upper arm, lower arm, hip/buttock/trochanter, upper leg, lower leg, and jaw; plus the chest, abdomen, neck, upper back and lower back.

The Symptom Severity Scale (SSS) assesses the severity of 6 symptoms; fatigue, memory, waking up unrefreshed, pain or cramps in lower abdomen, depression and headache.

=== American Pain Society 2019 ===

In 2019, the American Pain Society in collaboration with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration developed a new diagnostic system using five dimensions. 

In accordance to the 2016 diagnosis guidelines, the presence of another medical condition or pain disorder does not rule out the diagnosis of fibromyalgia. Nonetheless, other conditions should be ruled out as the main explaining reason for the patient&#x27;s symptoms. 

This diagnosis criteria set was influenced by the theory of central pain processing.

=== Self-report questionnaires ===
Some research has suggested using a multidimensional approach taking into consideration somatic symptoms, psychological factors, psychosocial stressors and subjective belief regarding fibromyalgia. These symptoms can be assessed by several self-report questionnaires.

==== Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) ====
The Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) and the Revised Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQR) assess three domains: function, overall impact and symptoms. It is considered a useful measure of disease impact.

==== Other questionnaires ====
Other measures include the &quot;Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale,&quot; &quot;Multiple Ability Self-Report Questionnaire&quot;, &quot;Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory, and&quot; &quot;Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale.&quot;

===Differential diagnosis===
As of 2016 the ACR criteria include that a diagnosis of fibromyalgia does not exclude the presence of other clinically important illnesses.

As of 2009, it was judged that as many as two out of every three people who were told that they have fibromyalgia by a rheumatologist may have had some other medical condition instead. Fibromyalgia could be misdiagnosed in cases of early undiagnosed rheumatic diseases such as preclinical rheumatoid arthritis, early stages of inflammatory spondyloarthritis, polymyalgia rheumatica, myofascial pain syndromes and hypermobility syndrome. Neurological diseases with an important pain component include multiple sclerosis, Parkinson&#x27;s disease and peripheral neuropathy. Other medical illnesses that should be ruled out are endocrine disease or metabolic disorder (hypothyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, acromegaly, vitamin D deficiency), gastro-intestinal disease (celiac and non-celiac gluten sensitivity), infectious diseases (Lyme disease, hepatitis C and immunodeficiency disease) and the early stages of a malignancy such as multiple myeloma, metastatic cancer and leukemia/lymphoma. Other systemic, inflammatory, endocrine, rheumatic, infectious, and neurologic disorders may cause fibromyalgia-like symptoms, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren syndrome, ankylosing spondylitis, Ehlers-Danlos syndromes, psoriatic-related polyenthesitis, a nerve compression syndrome (such as carpal tunnel syndrome), and myasthenia gravis. In addition, several medications can also evoke pain (statins, aromatase inhibitors, bisphosphonates, and opioids).

The differential diagnosis is made during the evaluation based on the person&#x27;s medical history, physical examination, and laboratory investigations. The patient&#x27;s history can provide some hints to a fibromyalgia diagnosis. A family history of early chronic pain, a childhood history of pain, an emergence of broad pain following physical and/or psychosocial stress, a general hypersensitivity to touch, smell, noise, taste, hypervigilance, and various somatic symptoms (gastrointestinal, urology, gynecology, neurology), are all examples of these signals.

Extensive laboratory tests are usually unnecessary in the differential diagnosis of fibromyalgia. Common tests that are conducted include complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and thyroid function test.

==Epidemiology and prevalence==
===Overall prevalence===
A 2017 review found that fibromyalgia is estimated to affect 1.8% of the population. 

===Fibromyalgia in men===
Historically diagnosed FM cases have been between 80-96% female. As a result historically most FM research has focused on women.

However a 2018 review said that males make up 40% of people with fibromyalgia symptoms in the general population. As of 2024, estimates are that female/male split within fibromyalgia incidence is 60/40.

Men have experienced difficulties in accepting and communicating about FM as it was sometimes seen as a &quot;woman&#x27;s disease&quot; and could thus impact their self-image. 

There has been debate about whether men experience differences in FM symptoms compared to women. 
One small study (n = 281 female, 71 male) found females with FM had higher prevalence and intensity of FM than males with FM. Evidence suggests that women are generally more sensitive to pain than men, perhaps due to differences in brain activity and structure.

These factors may have led to past under-diagnosis of FM in men.

==Prognosis==

Symptoms of fibromyalgia are persistent in nearly all patients, although there can sometimes be marginal long-term improvements. An 11-year follow-up study on 1,555 FM patients found that most remained with high levels of self-reported symptoms and distress. 10% of the patients showed substantial improvement with minimal symptoms and an additional 15% had moderate improvement, but this may be transient, given the fluctuations in symptom severity.

A meta-analysis based on close to 200,000 fibromyalgia patients found that they were at a higher risk for all-cause mortality. Standardized mortality ratio (i.e. observed mortality rates in the study population, compared to expected levels based on a standard population) were 3.37 (95% CI 1.52 to 7.50) for mortality due to suicide, 1.95 (95% CI 0.97 to 3.92) due to accidents, and 1.66 (95% CI 1.15 to 2.38) due to infections. SMR due to cancer was a decreased rate of 0.82 (95% CI 0.69 to 0.97). The studies showed significant heterogeneity.

==Management==
Universally accepted treatments typically consist of symptom management and improving patient quality of life. A personalized, multidisciplinary approach to treatment that includes pharmacologic considerations and begins with effective patient education is most beneficial. Developments in the understanding of the pathophysiology of the disorder have led to improvements in treatment, which include prescription medication, behavioral intervention, and exercise.

===Guidelines===
Several associations have published guidelines for the diagnosis and management of fibromyalgia. The European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR; 2017) recommends a multidisciplinary approach, allowing a quick diagnosis and patient education. The recommended initial management should be non-pharmacological, later pharmacological treatment can be added. The European League Against Rheumatism gave the strongest recommendation for aerobic and strengthening exercise. Weak recommendations were given to some treatments, based on their outcomes. Qigong, yoga, and tai chi were weakly recommended for improving sleep and quality of life. Mindfulness was weakly recommended for improving pain and quality of life. Acupuncture and hydrotherapy were weakly recommended for improving pain. A weak recommendation was also given to psychotherapy. It was more suitable for patients with mood disorders or unhelpful coping strategies. Chiropractic was strongly recommended against, due to safety concerns. Some medications were weakly recommended for severe pain (duloxetine, pregabalin, tramadol) or sleep disturbance (amitriptyline, cyclobenzaprine, pregabalin). Others were not recommended due to a lack of efficacy (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, monoamine oxidase inhibitors and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors). Growth hormone, sodium oxybate, opioids, and steroids were strongly recommended against due to lack of efficacy and side effects.

The guidelines published by the Association of the Scientific Medical Societies in Germany inform patients that self-management strategies are an important component in managing the disease. The Canadian Pain Society also published guidelines for the diagnosis and management of fibromyalgia.

=== Exercise ===
In 2017 exercise was the only fibromyalgia treatment given a strong recommendation by the European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR). There is evidence indicating that exercise improves fitness, sleep and quality of life and may reduce pain and fatigue for people with fibromyalgia. Exercise has an added benefit in that it does not cause any serious adverse effects. There are a number of hypothesized biological mechanisms. Exercise may improve pain modulation through serotoninergic pathways. It may reduce pain by altering the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and reducing cortisol levels. It also has anti-inflammatory effects that may improve fibromyalgia symptoms. Aerobic exercise can improve muscle metabolism and pain through mitochondrial pathways.

When different exercise programs are compared, aerobic exercise is capable of modulating the autonomic nervous function of fibromyalgia patients, whereas resistance exercise does not show such effects. A 2022 meta-analysis found that aerobic training showed a high effect size while strength interventions showed moderate effects. Meditative exercise seems preferable for improving sleep, with no differences between resistance, flexibility, and aquatic exercise in their favorable effects on fatigue.

Despite its benefits, exercise is a challenge for patients with fibromyalgia, due to the chronic fatigue and pain they experience. They may also feel that those who recommend or deliver exercise interventions do not fully understand the possible negative impact of exercise on fatigue and pain. This is especially true for non-personalized exercise programs. Adherence is higher when the exercise program is recommended by doctors or supervised by nurses.

Sufferers perceive exercise as more effortful than healthy adults. Depression and higher pain intensity serve as barriers to physical activity. Exercise may intimidate them, in fear that they will be asked to do more than they are capable of. 

A recommended approach to a graded exercise program begins with small, frequent exercise periods and builds up from there. In order to reduce pain the use of an exercise program of 13 to 24 weeks is recommended, with each session lasting 30 to 60 minutes.

==== Aerobic ====
Aerobic exercise for fibromyalgia patients is the most investigated type of exercise. It includes activities such as walking, jogging, spinning, cycling, dancing and exercising in water, with walking being named as one of the best methods. A 2017 Cochrane summary concluded that aerobic exercise probably improves quality of life, slightly decreases pain and improves physical function and makes no difference in fatigue and stiffness. A 2019 meta-analysis showed that exercising aerobically can reduce autonomic dysfunction and increase heart rate variability. This happens when patients exercise at least twice a week, for 45–60 minutes at about 60%-80% of the maximum heart rate. Aerobic exercise also decreases anxiety and depression and improves the quality of life.

==== Flexibility ====
Combinations of different exercises such as flexibility and aerobic training may improve stiffness. However, the evidence is of low-quality. It is not clear if flexibility training alone compared to aerobic training is effective at reducing symptoms or has any adverse effects.

==== Resistance ====
In resistance exercise, participants apply a load to their body using weights, elastic bands, body weight, or other measures.

Two meta-analyses on fibromyalgia have shown that resistance training can reduce anxiety and depression, one found that it decreases pain and disease severity and one found that it improves quality of life. Resistance training may also improve sleep, with a greater effect than that of flexibility training and a similar effect to that of aerobic exercise.

The dosage of resistance exercise for women with fibromyalgia was studied in a 2022 meta-analysis. Effective dosages were found when exercising twice a week, for at least eight weeks. Symptom improvement was found for even low dosages such as 1–2 sets of 4–20 repetitions. Most studies use moderate exercise intensity of 40% to 85% one-repetition maximum. This intensity was effective in reducing pain. Some treatment regimes increase the intensity over time (from 40% to 80%), whereas others increase it when the participant can perform 12 repetitions. High-intensity exercises may cause lower treatment adherence.

==== Meditative ====
A 2021 meta-analysis found that meditative exercise programs (tai chi, yoga, qigong) were superior to other forms of exercise (aerobic, flexibility, resistance) in improving sleep quality. Other meta-analyses also found positive effects of tai chi for sleep, fibromyalgia symptoms, and pain, fatigue, depression and quality of life. These tai chi interventions frequently included 1-hour sessions practiced 1-3 times a week for 12 weeks. Meditative exercises, as a whole, may achieve desired outcomes through biological mechanisms such as antioxidation, anti-inflammation, reduction in sympathetic activity and modulation of glucocorticoid receptor sensitivity.

==== Aquatic ====
Several reviews and meta-analyses suggest that aquatic training can improve symptoms and wellness in people with fibromyalgia. It is recommended to practice aquatic therapy at least twice a week using a low to moderate intensity. However, aquatic therapy does not appear to be superior to other types of exercise.

==== Other ====
Limited evidence suggests vibration training in combination with exercise may improve pain, fatigue, and stiffness.

=== Medications ===
A few countries have published guidelines for the management and treatment of fibromyalgia. As of 2018, all of them emphasize that medications are not required. However, medications, though imperfect, continue to be a component of treatment strategy for fibromyalgia patients. The German guidelines outlined parameters for drug therapy termination and recommended considering drug holidays after six months.

Health Canada and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have approved pregabalin (an anticonvulsant) and duloxetine (a serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) for the management of fibromyalgia. The FDA also approved milnacipran (another serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor), but the European Medicines Agency refused marketing authority.&lt;ref name=&quot;Doc. Ref.: EMA/814249/2009&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The medications duloxetine, milnacipran, or pregabalin have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the management of fibromyalgia. 
====Antidepressants====
Antidepressants are one of the common drugs for fibromyalgia. A 2021 meta-analysis concluded that antidepressants can improve the quality of life for fibromyalgia patients in the medium term. For most people with fibromyalgia, the potential benefits of treatment with the serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors duloxetine and milnacipran and the tricyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline, are outweighed by significant adverse effects (more adverse effects than benefits), however, a small number of people may experience relief from symptoms with these medications.

The length of time that antidepressant medications take to be effective at reducing symptoms can vary. Any potential benefits from the antidepressant amitriptyline may take up to three months to take effect and it may take between three and six months for duloxetine, milnacipran, and pregabalin to be effective at improving symptoms. Some medications have the potential to cause withdrawal symptoms when stopping so gradual discontinuation may be warranted particularly for antidepressants and pregabalin. 

===== Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors =====
A 2023 meta-analysis found that duloxetine improved fibromyalgia symptoms, regardless of the dosage. SSRIs may be also be used to treat depression in people diagnosed with fibromyalgia.

===== Tricyclic antidepressants =====
While amitriptyline has been used as a first-line treatment, the quality of evidence to support this use and comparison between different medications is poor. Very weak evidence indicates that a very small number of people may benefit from treatment with the tetracyclic antidepressant mirtazapine, however, for most, the potential benefits are not great and the risk of adverse effects and potential harm outweighs any potential for benefit. As of 2018, the only tricyclic antidepressant that has sufficient evidence is amitriptyline.

===== Monoamine oxidase inhibitors =====
Tentative evidence suggests that monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) such as pirlindole and moclobemide are moderately effective for reducing pain. Very low-quality evidence suggests pirlindole as more effective at treating pain than moclobemide. Side effects of MAOIs may include nausea and vomiting.

====Central nervous system depressants====
Central nervous system depressants include drug categories such as sedatives, tranquilizers, and hypnotics. A 2021 meta-analysis concluded that such drugs can improve the quality of life for fibromyalgia patients in the medium term.

====Anti-seizure medication====
The anti-convulsant medications gabapentin and pregabalin may be used to reduce pain. There is tentative evidence that gabapentin may be of benefit for pain in about 18% of people with fibromyalgia. It is not possible to predict who will benefit, and a short trial may be recommended to test the effectiveness of this type of medication. Approximately 6/10 people who take gabapentin to treat pain related to fibromyalgia experience unpleasant side effects such as dizziness, abnormal walking, or swelling from fluid accumulation. Pregabalin demonstrates a benefit in about 9% of people. Pregabalin reduced time off work by 0.2 days per week.

==== Cannabinoids ====
Cannabinoids may have some benefits for people with fibromyalgia. However, as of 2022, the data on the topic is still limited. Cannabinoids may also have adverse effects and may negatively interact with common rheumatological drugs.

====Opioids====
The use of opioids is controversial. As of 2015, no opioid is approved for use in this condition by the FDA. A 2016 Cochrane review concluded that there is no good evidence to support or refute the suggestion that oxycodone, alone or in combination with naloxone, reduces pain in fibromyalgia. The National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) in 2014 stated that there was a lack of evidence for opioids for most people. The Association of the Scientific Medical Societies in Germany in 2012 made no recommendation either for or against the use of weak opioids because of the limited amount of scientific research addressing their use in the treatment of fibromyalgia. They strongly advise against using strong opioids. The Canadian Pain Society in 2012 said that opioids, starting with a weak opioid like tramadol, can be tried but only for people with moderate to severe pain that is not well-controlled by non-opioid painkillers. They discourage the use of strong opioids and only recommend using them while they continue to provide improved pain and functioning. Healthcare providers should monitor people on opioids for ongoing effectiveness, side effects, and possible unwanted drug behaviors.

A 2015 review found fair evidence to support tramadol use if other medications do not work. A 2018 review found little evidence to support the combination of paracetamol (acetaminophen) and tramadol over a single medication. Goldenberg &quot;et al&quot; suggest that tramadol works via its serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition, rather than via its action as a weak opioid receptor agonist.

A large study of US people with fibromyalgia found that between 2005 and 2007 37.4% were prescribed short-acting opioids and 8.3% were prescribed long-acting opioids, with around 10% of those prescribed short-acting opioids using tramadol; and a 2011 Canadian study of 457 people with fibromyalgia found 32% used opioids and two-thirds of those used strong opioids.

==== Topical treatment ====
Capsaicin has been suggested as a topical pain reliever. Preliminary results suggest that it may improve sleep quality and fatigue, but there are not enough studies to support this claim.

====Unapproved or unfounded====
Sodium oxybate increases growth hormone production levels through increased slow-wave sleep patterns. However, this medication was not approved by the FDA for the indication for use in people with fibromyalgia due to the concern for abuse.

The muscle relaxants cyclobenzaprine, carisoprodol with acetaminophen and caffeine, and tizanidine are sometimes used to treat fibromyalgia; however, as of 2015 they are not approved for this use in the United States. The use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is not recommended as first-line therapy. Moreover, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs cannot be considered as useful in the management of fibromyalgia.

Very low-quality evidence suggests quetiapine may be effective in fibromyalgia.

No high-quality evidence exists that suggests synthetic THC (nabilone) helps with fibromyalgia.

===Nutrition and dietary supplements===
Nutrition is related to fibromyalgia in several ways. Some nutritional risk factors for fibromyalgia complications are obesity, nutritional deficiencies, food allergies, and consuming food additives. The consumption of fruits and vegetables, low-processed foods, high-quality proteins, and healthy fats may have some benefits. Low-quality evidence found some benefits of a vegetarian or vegan diet.

Although dietary supplements have been widely investigated concerning fibromyalgia, most of the evidence, as of 2021, is of poor quality. It is therefore difficult to reach conclusive recommendations. It appears that Q10 coenzyme and vitamin D supplements can reduce pain and improve quality of life for fibromyalgia patients. Q10 coenzyme has beneficial effects on fatigue in fibromyalgia patients, with most studies using doses of 300 mg per day for three months. Q10 coenzyme is hypothesized to improve mitochondrial activity and decrease inflammation. Vitamin D has been shown to improve some fibromyalgia measures, but not others.

Two review articles found that melatonin treatment has several positive effects on fibromyalgia patients, including the improvement of sleep quality, pain, and disease impact. No major adverse events were reported.

===Psychotherapy===
Due to the uncertainty about the pathogenesis of fibromyalgia, current treatment approaches focus on management of symptoms to improve quality of life, using integrated pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches. There is no single intervention shown to be effective for all patients. In a 2020 Cochrane review, cognitive behavioral therapy was found to have a small but beneficial effect for reducing pain and distress but adverse events were not well evaluated. Cognitive behavioral therapy and related psychological and behavioural therapies have a small to moderate effect in reducing symptoms of fibromyalgia. Effect sizes tend to be small when cognitive behavioral therapy is used as a stand-alone treatment for patients with fibromyalgia, but these improve significantly when it is part of a wider multidisciplinary treatment program.

A 2010 systematic review of 14 studies reported that cognitive behavioral therapy improves self-efficacy or coping with pain and reduces the number of physician visits at post-treatment, but has no significant effect on pain, fatigue, sleep, or health-related quality of life at post-treatment or follow-up. Depressed mood was also improved but this could not be distinguished from some risks of bias. A 2022 meta-analysis found that cognitive behavioral therapy reduces insomnia in people with chronic pain, including people with fibromyalgia. Acceptance and commitment therapy, a type of cognitive behavioral therapy, has also proven effective.

=== Patient education ===
Patient education is recommended by the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) as an important treatment component. As of 2022, there is only low-quality evidence showing that patient education can decrease pain and fibromyalgia impact.

Sleep hygiene interventions show low effectiveness in improving insomnia in people with chronic pain.

=== Physical therapy ===
Patients with chronic pain, including those with fibromyalgia, can benefit from techniques such as manual therapy, cryotherapy, and balneotherapy. These can lessen the experience of chronic pain and increase both the amount and quality of sleep. Patients&#x27; quality of life is also improved by decreasing pain mechanisms and increasing sleep quality, particularly during the REM phase, sleep efficiency, and alertness.

==== Manual therapy ====
A 2021 meta-analysis concluded that massage and myofascial release diminish pain in the medium term. As of 2015, there was no good evidence for the benefit of other mind-body therapies.

====Acupuncture====
A 2013 review found moderate-level evidence on the usage of acupuncture with electrical stimulation for improvement of overall well-being. Acupuncture alone will not have the same effects, but will enhance the influence of exercise and medication in pain and stiffness.

=== Electrical neuromodulation ===
Several forms of electrical neuromodulation, including transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), have been used to treat fibromyalgia. In general, they help reduce pain and depression and improve functioning.

==== Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) ====
Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is the delivery of pulsed electrical currents to the skin to stimulate peripheral nerves. TENS is widely used to treat pain and is considered to be a low-cost, safe, and self-administered treatment. As such, it is commonly recommended by clinicians to people suffering from pain. On 2019, an overview of eight Cochrane reviews was conducted, covering 51 TENS-related randomized controlled trials. The review concluded that the quality of the available evidence was insufficient to make any recommendations. A later review concluded that transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation may diminish pain in the short term, but there was uncertainty about the relevance of the results.

Preliminary findings suggest that electrically stimulating the vagus nerve through an implanted device can potentially reduce fibromyalgia symptoms. However, there may be adverse reactions to the procedure.

==== Noninvasive brain stimulation ====
Noninvasive brain stimulation includes methods such as transcranial direct current stimulation and high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Both methods have been found to improve pain scores in neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia.

A 2023 meta-analysis of 16 RCTs found that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of over 4 weeks can decrease pain in patients with fibromyalgia.

A 2021 meta-analysis of multiple intervention types concluded that magnetic field therapy and transcranial magnetic stimulation may diminish pain in the short-term, but conveyed an uncertainty about the relevance of the result. Several 2022 meta-analyses focusing on transcranial magnetic stimulation found positive effects on fibromyalgia. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation improved pain in the short-term and quality of life after 5–12 weeks. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation did not improve anxiety, depression, and fatigue. Transcranial magnetic stimulation to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was also ineffective.

==== EEG neurofeedback ====
A systematic review of EEG neurofeedback for the treatment of fibromyalgia found most treatments showed significant improvements of the main symptoms of the disease. However, the protocols were so different, and the lack of controls or randomization impede drawing conclusive results.

=== Hyperbaric oxygen therapy ===
Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) has shown beneficial effects in treating chronic pain by reducing inflammation and oxidative stress. However, treating fibromyalgia with hyperbaric oxygen therapy is still controversial, in light of the scarcity of large-scale clinical trials. In addition, hyperbaric oxygen therapy raises safety concerns due to the oxidative damage that may follow it. An evaluation of nine trials with 288 patients in total found that HBOT was more effective at relieving fibromyalgia patients&#x27; pain than the control intervention. In most of the trials, HBOT improved sleep disturbance, multidimensional function, patient satisfaction, and tender spots. 24% of the patients experienced negative outcomes.

===Approaches to coping with FM===
Achieving acceptance of FM, and making adjustments to lifestyle, are two of many aspects of coping.

==Society and culture==
===Attitudes to fibromyalgia people within health systems===
In the UK FM care is within the primary sector (GP practices). In a survey FM people reported feelings that FM was &#x27;a troublesome label&#x27;, &#x27;a heavy burden&#x27; and &#x27;a low priority&#x27;.

===Economics===
People with fibromyalgia generally have higher healthcare costs and utilization rates. A review of 36 studies found that fibromyalgia causes a significant economic burden on healthcare systems. Annual costs per patient were estimated to be up to $35,920 in the US and $8,504 in Europe.

==History==

===Origins===
Chronic widespread pain had been described in the literature in the 19th century, but the term &quot;fibromyalgia&quot; was not first used until 1976, when Phillip Kahler Hench used it to describe these symptoms. Many names, including muscular rheumatism, &quot;fibrositis&quot;, &quot;psychogenic rheumatism&quot;, and &quot;neurasthenia&quot; were applied historically to symptoms resembling those of fibromyalgia. The term &quot;fibromyalgia&quot; was coined by researcher Mohammed Yunus as a synonym for fibrositis. and was first used in a scientific publication in 1981. Fibromyalgia is from the Latin &quot;fibra&quot; (fiber) and the Greek words &quot;myo&quot; (muscle) and &quot;algos&quot; (pain).

Historical perspectives on the development of the fibromyalgia concept note the &quot;central importance&quot; of a 1977 paper on fibrositis by Smythe and Moldofsky. The first clinical, controlled study of the characteristics of fibromyalgia syndrome was published in 1981, providing support for symptom associations. In 1984, an interconnection between fibromyalgia syndrome and other similar conditions was proposed, and in 1986, trials of the first proposed medications for fibromyalgia were published.

A 1987 article in the &quot;Journal of the American Medical Association&quot; used the term &#x27;fibromyalgia syndrome&#x27;, while saying it was a &quot;controversial condition&quot;. The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) published its first classification criteria for fibromyalgia in 1990. Later revisions were made in 2010, 2016, and 2019.

===Controversies on the nature and reality of fibromyalgia===
In the past fibromyalgia was a disputed diagnosis. Rheumatologist Frederick Wolfe, lead author of the 1990 paper that first defined the diagnostic guidelines for fibromyalgia, stated in 2008 that he believed it &quot;clearly&quot; not to be a disease but instead a physical response to depression and stress. In 2013, Wolfe added that its causes &quot;are controversial in a sense&quot; and &quot;there are many factors that produce these symptoms – some are psychological and some are physical and it does exist on a continuum&quot;. Some members of the medical community did not consider fibromyalgia a disease because of a lack of abnormalities on physical examination and the absence of objective diagnostic tests.

In the past, some psychiatrists viewed fibromyalgia as a type of affective disorder, or a somatic symptom disorder. These controversies did not engage healthcare specialists alone; some patients objected to fibromyalgia being described in purely somatic terms.

As of 2022, neurologists and pain specialists tended to view fibromyalgia as a real pathology. It is mostly seen as due to dysfunction of muscles and connective tissue as well as functional abnormalities in the central nervous system. Rheumatologists define the syndrome in the context of &quot;central sensitization&quot; – heightened brain response to normal stimuli in the absence of disorders of the muscles, joints, or connective tissues. Because of this symptomatic overlap, some researchers have proposed that fibromyalgia and other analogous syndromes be classified together as central sensitivity syndromes. A 2021 study indicated that fibromyalgia may be an autoimmune condition.

===History of fibromyalgia diagnosis===

The first widely accepted set of classification criteria for research purposes was elaborated in 1990 by the Multicenter Criteria Committee of the American College of Rheumatology. These criteria, which are known informally as &quot;the ACR 1990&quot;, defined fibromyalgia according to the presence of the following criteria:
* A history of widespread pain lasting more than three months – affecting all four quadrants of the body, i.e., both sides and above and below the waist.
* Tender points – there are 18 designated possible tender points (although a person with the disorder may feel pain in other areas as well).

The ACR criteria for the classification of patients were originally established as inclusion criteria for research purposes and were not intended for clinical diagnosis but have later become the &quot;de facto&quot; diagnostic criteria in the clinical setting. A controversial study was done by a legal team looking to prove their client&#x27;s disability based primarily on tender points and their widespread presence in non-litigious communities prompted the lead author of the ACR criteria to question now the useful validity of tender points in diagnosis. Use of control points has been used to cast doubt on whether a person has fibromyalgia, and to claim the person is malingering.

In 2010, the American College of Rheumatology approved provisional revised diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia that eliminated the 1990 criteria&#x27;s reliance on tender point testing. The revised criteria used a widespread pain index (WPI) and symptom severity scale (SSS) in place of tender point testing under the 1990 criteria. The WPI counts up to 19 general body areas in which the person has experienced pain in the preceding week. The SSS rates the severity of the person&#x27;s fatigue, unrefreshed waking, cognitive symptoms, and general somatic symptoms, each on a scale from 0 to 3, for a composite score ranging from 0 to 12. The revised criteria for diagnosis were:
* WPI ≥ 7 and SSS ≥ 5 &quot;OR&quot; WPI 3–6 and SSS ≥ 9,
* Symptoms have been present at a similar level for at least three months, &quot;and&quot;
* No other diagnosable disorder otherwise explains the pain.

<text>In chemistry, the law of mass action is the proposition that the rate of a chemical reaction is directly proportional to the product of the activities or concentrations of the reactants. It explains and predicts behaviors of solutions in dynamic equilibrium. Specifically, it implies that for a chemical reaction mixture that is in equilibrium, the ratio between the concentration of reactants and products is constant.

Two aspects are involved in the initial formulation of the law: 1) the equilibrium aspect, concerning the composition of a reaction mixture at equilibrium and 2) the kinetic aspect concerning the rate equations for elementary reactions. Both aspects stem from the research performed by Cato M. Guldberg and Peter Waage between 1864 and 1879 in which equilibrium constants were derived by using kinetic data and the rate equation which they had proposed. Guldberg and Waage also recognized that chemical equilibrium is a dynamic process in which rates of reaction for the forward and backward reactions must be equal at chemical equilibrium. In order to derive the expression of the equilibrium constant appealing to kinetics, the expression of the rate equation must be used. The expression of the rate equations was rediscovered independently by Jacobus Henricus van &#x27;t Hoff.

The law is a statement about equilibrium and gives an expression for the equilibrium constant, a quantity characterizing chemical equilibrium. In modern chemistry this is derived using equilibrium thermodynamics. It can also be derived with the concept of chemical potential.

== History ==
Two chemists generally expressed the composition of a mixture in terms of numerical values relating the amount of the product to describe the equilibrium state.
Cato Maximilian Guldberg and Peter Waage, building on Claude Louis Berthollet&#x27;s ideas about reversible chemical reactions, proposed the law of mass action in 1864. These papers, in Danish, went largely unnoticed, as did the later publication (in French) of 1867 which contained a modified law and the experimental data on which that law was based.

In 1877 van &#x27;t Hoff independently came to similar conclusions, but was unaware of the earlier work, which prompted Guldberg and Waage to give a fuller and further developed account of their work, in German, in 1879. Van &#x27;t Hoff then accepted their priority.

=== 1864 ===
==== The equilibrium state (composition)====
In their first paper, Guldberg and Waage suggested that in a reaction such as 
: &lt;chem&gt;A + B &lt;=&gt; A&#x27; + B&#x27;&lt;/chem&gt;
the &quot;chemical affinity&quot; or &quot;reaction force&quot; between A and B did not just depend on the chemical nature of the reactants, as had previously been supposed, but also depended on the amount of each reactant in a reaction mixture. Thus the law of mass action was first stated as follows:
: When two reactants, A and B, react together at a given temperature in a &quot;substitution reaction,&quot; the affinity, or chemical force between them, is proportional to the active masses, [A] and [B], each raised to a particular power
:: formula_1.

In this context a substitution reaction was one such as &lt;chem&gt;{alcohol} + acid &lt;=&gt; {ester} + water&lt;/chem&gt;. Active mass was defined in the 1879 paper as &quot;the amount of substance in the sphere of action&quot;. For species in solution active mass is equal to concentration. For solids, active mass is taken as a constant. formula_2, a and b were regarded as empirical constants, to be determined by experiment.

At equilibrium, the chemical force driving the forward reaction must be equal to the chemical force driving the reverse reaction. Writing the initial active masses of A,B, A&#x27; and B&#x27; as p, q, p&#x27; and q&#x27; and the dissociated active mass at equilibrium as formula_3, this equality is represented by
:formula_4
formula_3 represents the amount of reagents A and B that has been converted into A&#x27; and B&#x27;. Calculations based on this equation are reported in the second paper.

==== Dynamic approach to the equilibrium state ====
The third paper of 1864 was concerned with the kinetics of the same equilibrium system. Writing the dissociated active mass at some point in time as x, the rate of reaction was given as
: formula_6
Likewise the reverse reaction of A&#x27; with B&#x27; proceeded at a rate given by
: formula_7
The overall rate of conversion is the difference between these rates, so at equilibrium (when the composition stops changing) the two rates of reaction must be equal. Hence
: formula_8...

=== 1867 ===
The rate expressions given in Guldberg and Waage&#x27;s 1864 paper could not be differentiated, so they were simplified as follows. The chemical force was assumed to be directly proportional to the product of the active masses of the reactants.
: formula_9
This is equivalent to setting the exponents a and b of the earlier theory to one. The proportionality constant was called an affinity constant, k. The equilibrium condition for an &quot;ideal&quot; reaction was thus given the simplified form
: formula_10

[A]eq, [B]eq etc. are the active masses at equilibrium. In terms of the initial amounts reagents p,q etc. this becomes
: formula_11
The ratio of the affinity coefficients, k&#x27;/k, can be recognized as an equilibrium constant. Turning to the kinetic aspect, it was suggested that the velocity of reaction, v, is proportional to the sum of chemical affinities (forces). In its simplest form this results in the expression
: formula_12
where formula_13 is the proportionality constant. Actually, Guldberg and Waage used a more complicated expression which allowed for interaction between A and A&#x27;, etc. By making certain simplifying approximations to those more complicated expressions, the rate equation could be integrated and hence the equilibrium quantity formula_3 could be calculated. The extensive calculations in the 1867 paper gave support to the simplified concept, namely,
:The rate of a reaction is proportional to the product of the active masses of the reagents involved.
This is an alternative statement of the law of mass action.

=== 1879 ===
In the 1879 paper the assumption that reaction rate was proportional to the product of concentrations was justified microscopically in terms of the frequency of independent collisions, as had been developed for gas kinetics by Boltzmann in 1872 (Boltzmann equation). It was also proposed that the original theory of the equilibrium condition could be generalised to apply to any arbitrary chemical equilibrium.
: formula_15

The exponents α, β etc. are explicitly identified for the first time as the stoichiometric coefficients for the reaction.

== Modern statement of the law==
The affinity constants, k+ and k−, of the 1879 paper can now be recognised as rate constants. The equilibrium constant, K, was derived by setting the rates of forward and backward reactions to be equal. This also meant that the chemical affinities for the forward and backward reactions are equal. The resultant expression
: formula_16

=== Diffusion in condensed matter ===

Yakov Frenkel represented diffusion process in condensed matter as an ensemble of elementary jumps and quasichemical interactions of particles and defects. Henry Eyring applied his theory of absolute reaction rates to this quasichemical representation of diffusion. Mass action law for diffusion leads to various nonlinear versions of Fick&#x27;s law.

=== In mathematical ecology ===

The Lotka–Volterra equations describe dynamics of the predator-prey systems. The rate of predation upon the prey is assumed to be proportional to the rate at which the predators and the prey meet; this rate is evaluated as &quot;xy&quot;, where &quot;x&quot; is the number of prey, &quot;y&quot; is the number of predator. This is a typical example of the law of mass action.

=== In mathematical epidemiology ===

The law of mass action forms the basis of the compartmental model of disease spread in mathematical epidemiology, in which a population of humans, animals or other individuals is divided into categories of susceptible, infected, and recovered (immune). The principle of mass action is at the heart of the transmission term of compartmental models in epidemiology, which provide a useful abstraction of disease dynamics. The law of mass action formulation of the SIR model corresponds to the following &quot;quasichemical&quot; system of elementary reactions: 
: The list of components is S (susceptible individuals), I (infected individuals), and R (removed individuals, or just recovered ones if we neglect lethality);
: The list of elementary reactions is
:: &lt;chem&gt;S + I -&gt; 2I&lt;/chem&gt;
:: &lt;chem&gt;I -&gt; R&lt;/chem&gt;.
: If the immunity is unstable then the transition from R to S should be added that closes the cycle (SIRS model):
:: &lt;chem&gt;R -&gt; S&lt;/chem&gt;.
A rich system of law of mass action models was developed in mathematical epidemiology by adding components and elementary reactions.

Individuals in human or animal populations unlike molecules in an ideal solution do not mix homogeneously. There are some disease examples in which this non-homogeneity is great enough such that the outputs of the classical SIR model and their simple generalizations like SIS or SEIR, are invalid. For these situations, more sophisticated compartmental models or distributed reaction-diffusion models may be useful.

<text>In mathematics, a Gaussian rational number is a complex number of the form &quot;p&quot; + &quot;qi&quot;, where &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; are both rational numbers.
The set of all Gaussian rationals forms the Gaussian rational field, denoted Q(&quot;i&quot;), obtained by adjoining the imaginary number &quot;i&quot; to the field of rationals Q.

==Properties of the field==
The field of Gaussian rationals provides an example of an algebraic number field that is both a quadratic field and a cyclotomic field (since &quot;i&quot; is a 4th root of unity). Like all quadratic fields it is a Galois extension of Q with Galois group cyclic of order two, in this case generated by complex conjugation, and is thus an abelian extension of Q, with conductor 4.

As with cyclotomic fields more generally, the field of Gaussian rationals is neither ordered nor complete (as a metric space). The Gaussian integers Z[&quot;i&quot;] form the ring of integers of Q(&quot;i&quot;). The set of all Gaussian rationals is countably infinite.

The field of Gaussian rationals is also a two-dimensional vector space over Q with natural basis formula_1.

==Ford spheres==
The concept of Ford circles can be generalized from the rational numbers to the Gaussian rationals, giving Ford spheres. In this construction, the complex numbers are embedded as a plane in a three-dimensional Euclidean space, and for each Gaussian rational point in this plane one constructs a sphere tangent to the plane at that point. For a Gaussian rational represented in lowest terms as formula_2 (i.e. and are relatively prime), the radius of this sphere should be formula_3 where formula_4 is the squared modulus, and is the complex conjugate. The resulting spheres are tangent for pairs of Gaussian rationals formula_5 and formula_2 with formula_7, and otherwise they do not intersect each other.
