<text>Southport is a seaside town in the Metropolitan Borough of Sefton in Merseyside, England. It lies on the West Lancashire coastal plain and the east coast of the Irish Sea, approximately north of Liverpool and southwest of Preston. At the 2021 census, Southport had a population of 94,421, making it the eleventh most populous settlement in North West England and the third most populous settlement in the Liverpool City Region.

The town was founded in 1792 by William Sutton, an innkeeper from Churchtown, who built a bathing house at what is now the south end of Lord Street. The area was previously known as South Hawes, and was sparsely populated and dominated by dunes. The area became popular with tourists due to the easy access from the nearby Leeds and Liverpool Canal, and by 1848 had a railway connection. The resort increased during the Victorian era and contains examples of Victorian architecture and town planning. Lord Street was developed as a wide, tree-lined shopping street, and attractions such as Southport Pier, which is the second longest seaside pleasure pier in the British Isles, were constructed. A particular feature of the town is the extensive tree planting. This was one of the conditions required by the Hesketh family when they made land available for development in the 19th century. Hesketh Park at the northern end of the town is named after them, having been built on land donated by Rev. Charles Hesketh.

Extensive sand dunes stretch for several miles from Woodvale to Birkdale, the south of the town. The Ainsdale dunes have been designated as a national nature reserve and a Ramsar site. Local fauna include the natterjack toad and the sand lizard. Southport hosts events, including an annual air show on and over the beach, the largest independent flower show in the UK in Victoria Park, and the British Musical Fireworks Championship. The town is at the centre of England&#x27;s &quot;Golf Coast&quot;, and has hosted the Open Championship at the Royal Birkdale Golf Club.

==Etymology==
The town gets its name from the South Port Hotel; built around 1797 (see #18th century).

==History==
=== 10th–17th century ===
There have been settlements in the area now comprising Southport since the Domesday Book, and some parts of the town have names of Viking origin.
The earliest recorded human activity in the region was during the Middle Stone Age when mesolithic hunter-gatherers were attracted by the abundant red deer and elk populations, as well as the availability of fish, shellfish, and woodland.

Roman coins have been found at Halsall Moss and Crossens, although the Romans never settled southwest Lancashire.

The first objective evidence of an early settlement in the region is in the Domesday Book, in which the area is called &quot;Otergimele&quot;. The Domesday Book states that there were 50 huts in Otergimele, housing a population 200. The population was scattered thinly across the region, and it was at the northeast end of Otergimele (present-day Crossens), where blown sand gave way to alluvial deposits from the River Ribble estuary, that a small concentration of people occurred.

It was here that a primitive church might have been built, which gave the emerging village its name of Churchtown, the parish being North Meols (pronounced &quot;meals&quot;). A church called St Cuthbert&#x27;s is still at the centre of Churchtown.

With a booming fishing industry, the area grew and hamlets became part of the parish of North Meols. From south to north, these villages were South Hawes, Haweside, Little London, Higher Blowick, Lower Blowick, Rowe-Lane, Churchtown, Marshside, Crossens, and Banks. As well as Churchtown, there were vicarages in Crossens and Banks.

Parts of the parish were almost completely surrounded by water until 1692 when Thomas Fleetwood of Bank Hall cut a channel to drain Martin Mere to the sea. From this point on, attempts at large-scale drainage of Martin Mere and other marshland continued until the 19th century, since when the water has been pumped away. This left behind a legacy of fine agricultural soil and created a booming farming industry.

=== 18th century ===

In the late 18th century, it was becoming fashionable for the well-to-do to desert inland spa towns and visit the seaside to bathe in the salt sea waters. At that time, doctors recommended bathing in the sea to help cure aches and pains. In 1792, William Sutton, the landlord of the &quot;Black Bull Inn&quot; in Churchtown (now the &quot;Hesketh Arms&quot;) and known to locals as &quot;The Old Duke&quot;, realised the importance of the newly created canal systems across the UK and set up a bathing house in the virtually uninhabited dunes at South Hawes by the seaside just four miles (6 km) away from the newly constructed Leeds and Liverpool Canal and two miles southwest of Churchtown.
When a widow from Wigan built a cottage nearby in 1797 for seasonal lodgers, Sutton quickly built a new inn on the site of the bathing house which he called the South Port Hotel, moving to live there the following season. There was no port, but &quot;Southport&quot; soon became the name of the town. The locals thought him mad and referred to the building as the &quot;Duke&#x27;s Folly&quot;, but Sutton arranged transport links from the canal that ran through Scarisbrick, four miles from the hotel, and trade was remarkably good. The hotel survived until 1854, when it was demolished to make way for traffic at the end of Lord Street, but its presence and the impact of its founder are marked by a plaque in the vicinity, by the name of one street at the intersection, namely Duke Street, and by a hotel on Duke Street which bears the legacy name of Dukes Folly Hotel.

===19th century===

Southport grew quickly in the 19th century as it gained a reputation for being a more refined seaside resort than its neighbour Blackpool. Southport had a head start compared to all the other places on the Lancashire coast because it had easy access to the canal system. Other seaside bathing areas could not really get going until the railways were built some years later. The Leeds and Liverpool canal brought people from Liverpool, Manchester, Bolton and Wigan amongst others. By 1820 Southport had over 20,000 visitors per year.

Southport Pier is referred to as the first true &quot;pleasure pier&quot;, being one of the earliest pier structures to be erected using iron. A design from James Brunlees was approved at a cost of £8,700 and on 4 August 1859 a large crowd witnessed the driving home of the first support pile. The opening of the pier was celebrated on 2 August 1860.
On the night of 9 December 1886, the worst lifeboat disaster in the history of the UK occurred off the shores of Southport. A cargo ship called the &quot;Mexico&quot; was on its way to South America when it found itself in difficulty. Lifeboats from Lytham, St. Annes and Southport set off to try to rescue those aboard the vessel. The crews battled against storm-force winds as they rowed towards the casualty. The entire crew from the St. Anne&#x27;s boat was lost and all but two of the Southport crew were too. In all, 28 lifeboatmen lost their lives on that night, leaving many widows and fatherless children.

A memorial was erected in Duke Street Cemetery and there is a permanent display in the museum at The Atkinson on Lord Street. There is also a memorial inside the Lifeboat house, now operated by the Southport Offshore Rescue Trust. &quot;Mexico&quot; was just one of many shipwrecks in the Southport area.

===20th century===
From 1894 to 1912 Birkdale and the adjoining village of Ainsdale were separate from Southport and administered by Birkdale Urban District Council before becoming part of the county borough of Southport in 1912. This was a huge expansion of the town.

In 1914, a very short romance story between a &quot;2 park road Southport&quot; private soldier and French lady took place in Valenciennes in north France during early First World War as described by Andrée Ducatez&#x27;s &quot;Journal&quot;.

In 1925, the RNLI abandoned the station at Southport and left the town with no lifeboat. In the late 1980s, after a series of tragedies, local families from Southport raised the funds to buy a new lifeboat for the town, stationed at the old RNLI lifeboat house. The lifeboat, operated by the Southport Offshore Rescue Trust, is completely independent from the RNLI and receives no money from them. It relies entirely on donations from the general public.

On 21 March 1926, Henry Segrave set the land speed record in his 4-litre Sunbeam Tiger Ladybird on the sands at Southport at . This record lasted for just over a month, until broken by J.G. Parry-Thomas.

=== 21st century ===
Southport elected their first ever Labour MP in the 2024 general election.

On 29 July 2024, three girls aged 6, 7 and 9 were murdered in a stabbing incident, with eight children and two adults left injured. A violent riot the following day in response to the stabbings organised by far-right groups left 53 police officers injured, with eight sustaining serious injuries. Multiple police vehicles were burned and destroyed and shops were raided.

==Governance==

In 2024 Southport elected its first ever Labour MP since the creation of the constituency in the 1880s, with Labour politician Patrick Hurley succeeding Conservative incumbent Damien Moore. Prior to that, Liberal Democrat John Pugh was the MP for Southport, holding the seat for 16 years until his retirement in the 2017 General election.

Southport, as part of the Metropolitan Borough of Sefton, one of the six boroughs of the Liverpool City Region.. It is governed by the Mayor of the Liverpool City Region, and the combined authority, which is responsible for areas of transport, trade and strategic governance of devolved powers in the town and wider Sefton Borough.

===Lancashire (1866–1971)===
Southport is located within the historic county of Lancashire, and was incorporated as a municipal borough in 1866. It became a county borough independent of the administrative county of Lancashire in 1905, having reached the minimum 50,000 population (the 1911 census gave a figure of 51,643). The Birkdale Urban District, including the parishes of Birkdale and Ainsdale was added to Southport in 1912. The county borough had its headquarters at Southport Town Hall.

===Merseyside (1971-present)===

==== Induction into the county of Merseyside ====
Under the 1971 Local Government White Paper, presented in February 1971, Southport would have lost its county borough status, becoming a non-metropolitan district within Lancashire. Rather than accept this fate and lose its separate education and social services departments, Southport Corporation lobbied for inclusion in the nearby planned metropolitan county of Merseyside, to join with Bootle and other units to form a district with the 250,000 required population. It was duly included in the Metropolitan Borough of Sefton.

A recurring local political issue has been the cross-party movement campaigning for Southport to leave Sefton and form its own unitary authority, perhaps adjoined to the neighbouring West Lancashire authority. Support for this has been seen amongst Liberal Democrat councillors, and also within the Southport Conservative Party.

Southport born Kevin Laroux Wood stood in the 1983 general election for the Southport Constituency. He was supported by a team of people who raised the funds needed and formed the &quot;Southport Back in Lancashire Party&quot;. Posters were distributed and articles published in the &quot;Visiter&quot; newspaper. Although was not elected as MP, it put the issue firmly on the local agenda which continues to this day. In the same period in 1980, a Private Member&#x27;s Bill proposed restoring Southport to Lancashire, and renaming the residue of Sefton to the Metropolitan Borough of Bootle. The Local Government Boundary Commission for England conducted a review of the area in 1987, which attracted 10,000 messages, of which &quot;70% were pro forma&quot;. In 1990, the LGBC made suggestions that Southport, Ainsdale and Birkdale should be made a district of Lancashire: the final recommendations in 1991 &quot;concluded that public opinion was more evenly divided than initially thought&quot;, and also that eastward transport links with Lancashire were poor compared to those southward to the Liverpool area.

==== Metropolitan Borough of Sefton ====
The government again directed the Local Government Commission for England to make a review in December 1996 (after it had finished the work on the creation of unitary authorities), commencing in January 1997. This review was constrained by the legal inability of the commission to recommend that the current Sefton-West Lancashire border be altered. In a MORI poll conducted at the behest of the LGCE, 65% of Southport residents supported the campaign, compared to 37% in the borough as a whole. Local MPs Matthew Banks and Ronnie Fearn (MPs for Southport at various times) supported making Southport a unitary authority, with Banks wishing to see it tied to Lancashire ceremonially, but Fearn wishing to see it remain, as a separate borough, in Merseyside.

The commission noted that Southport would have a relatively low population for a unitary authority, even including Formby (89,300 or 114,700), and that it was worried about the viability of a south Sefton authority without Southport, and therefore recommended the status quo be kept. The commission suggested the use of area committees for the various parts of the borough and also that Southport could become a civil parish. Another request made in 2004 was turned down, the Electoral Commission must request such a review.

In 2002, a local independent party calling themselves the Southport Party was established, with many members supporting a policy of &quot;Southport out of Sefton.&quot; Three council seats were won in the 2002 local elections, including that of the leader of Sefton Council, Liberal Democrat Councillor, David Bamber. At the following election there were no gains and a drop in the number of votes for the party. At the all out election in 2004, one of their councillors stood down, whilst the other two lost their seats.

To date, there have been no further moves to change Sefton&#x27;s boundaries, but the Boundary Commission indicated in 2004 that a future review is possible.

From 2014 the Borough of Sefton became one of the six boroughs of the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority.

==Geography==

The closest cities are Preston to the north east and Liverpool to the south.

Existing on the West Lancashire Coastal Plain, most of the town is only slightly above sea level and thus parts of Southport used to be susceptible to flooding. Marine Drive was regularly closed due to flooding from high tides, but in February 1997, new sea defences started being constructed and in 2002 the whole project was completed.

Southport has a maritime climate like most of the UK. Due to its position by the coast, Southport rarely sees substantial snowfall and temperatures rarely fall below so it does not have frequent frosts. Southport generally has moderate precipitation, unlike the rest of western UK.

The coast-to-coast Trans Pennine Trail (TPT) stretches the breadth of northern England – from Southport in the west to Hornsea in the east. The TPT is a route for walkers, cyclists and horse riders linking the North and Irish seas and passing through the Pennines. It runs alongside rivers and canals and through some of the most historic towns and cities in the North of England.

==Demography==
The United Kingdom Census 2001 showed a resident population for Southport of 90,336. Approximately 19,000 were aged 16 or under, 60,000 were aged 16–74, and 10,000 aged 75 and over. According to the 2001 census, 96% of Southport&#x27;s population claim they have been born in the UK.

The population of Southport began to rapidly increase during the Industrial Revolution and the Victorian era. From then the population has been stable with minor decline in some areas of the town.

==Economy==

===Tourism===

As a seaside town Southport has a history of leisure and recreation and is still dependent on tourism. The town went into decline when cheap air travel arrived in the 1960s and people chose to holiday abroad due to competitive prices and more reliable weather. However, the town kept afloat with people coming to spend the day by the seaside on bank holidays and weekends. The town has diversified with annual events, shopping and conferences. In 2011, Southport was named the fourteenth-most popular coastal resort in the country, benefiting from a 23% rise in money spent in the resort in that year. Part of the resort&#x27;s progress is a result of the money invested in Southport over recent years.
* Southport Airshow, the north west&#x27;s biggest airshow, held in the summer
* Southport Flower Show 
* British Musical Fireworks Championships
* Southport International Jazz Festival
* Southport Food and Drink Festival
* Southport Rocks
* Southport 24 Hour Race, A sailing race that sees boats racing continuously for 24 hours even in extreme weather conditions. Entries have included Olympic gold medallists and teams from the Republic of Ireland and France, and even the US and Australia. It is regarded as one of the hardest endurance races in the world.

===Business===
While Southport has a dependence on tourism the town is also home to businesses both in the private and public sector. Some manufacturing facilities were situated in the town, most notably Chewits were manufactured in the town from 1965 to 2006, only closing to move production to Slovakia. Manufacturing has diminished in the last few decades and only a few sites are still in production in the town today.

Lord Street is the main shopping street of Southport. It is one of the great shopping streets of Northern England and is said to be the inspiration for the tree-lined boulevards of Paris. In the 2000s Chapel Street was pedestrianised and is home to famous brands. Southport also has an indoor market situated on King Street and Market Street as well as a farmers&#x27; market held on the last Thursday of every month on Chapel Street.

Southport has hosted conferences since at least the 1880s when the Royal Institution met in the town. The former Southport Theatre &amp; Convention Centre closed in 2020 and a planning permission application for a new Marine Lake Events Centre was submitted at the end of June 2022. It has hosted the United Kingdom Independence Party national conference as well as the regional Labour Party conference. The Liberal Democrats held their federal Spring conference here in March 2018.

===England&#x27;s Golf Coast===
Southport is often called &quot;England&#x27;s Golfing Capital&quot; because it is at the centre of England&#x27;s Golf Coast. Royal Birkdale Golf Club is one of the clubs in the Open Championship rotation for both men and women. The club has hosted the men&#x27;s championship ten times since 1954, most recently in July 2017, and has hosted the women&#x27;s tournament five times, including 2010. Southport&#x27;s other courses include the 9-hole Southport Old Links in High Park, the Hesketh Golf Club, Hillside Golf Club and Southport and Ainsdale Golf Club.

==Attractions==

One of Southport&#x27;s main attractions for many years was Pleasureland, a fairground established in 1912. It was owned by the Thompson Family, and was closed in September 2006. A replacement fairground on the same site, provisionally named New Pleasureland, opened in July 2007. An earlier permanent funfair, Peter Pan&#x27;s Playground, closed in the 1980s and is now the site of part of the Ocean Plaza shopping development.

A former landmark of Pleasureland was the Looping Star roller coaster, which was on site from 1985 to 1987. It featured in the video for the pop single &quot;Wonderful Life&quot;, by Liverpool band Black, which was also shot at other parts of the Sefton and North West coastline. On 24 April 2009 a serious fire occurred at the oldest attraction within New Pleasureland. Called &quot;The River Caves&quot;, it was completely destroyed in this arson attack, and a 16-year-old boy was arrested in connection with the fire.

Southport Model Railway Village is situated in Kings Gardens opposite the Royal Clifton Hotel and near the Marine Lake Bridge. The Model Railway Village opened in May 1996 and was created by Ray and Jean Jones. The Jones family still run the attraction today. The Model Railway Village season extends from April to the end of October. The season has extended into weekend openings during November, February and March, weather permitting. An earlier model village, the Land of the Little People, was demolished in the late 1980s to make way for the aborted Winter Gardens/SIBEC shopping development. Its site is now occupied by a Morrison&#x27;s supermarket.

Other attractions in Southport include Splash World, an indoor water park situated on the back of the Dunes swimming pool which opened in June 2007.
Meols Hall, a manor house, home of the Hesketh family, is open to the public for a limited period each year. Its history back to the Domesday Book.
The British Lawnmower Museum is based in Shakespeare Street, a short distance outside the town centre.
The Power Station, that was the base of the town&#x27;s former radio station Dune FM, on the edge of Victoria Park, which itself is home to the Southport Flower Show.

==Transport==

===Road===
Southport is the second-largest town in Britain with no direct dual-carriageway link to the national motorway network (after Eastbourne: 2011 census). Due to its position by the coast, Southport is a linear settlement and as such can only be approached in a limited number of directions by road.

The main roads entering Southport are:
* A565 (from Preston to the northeast, from the A59 Liverpool – Preston – York)
* A570 (from Ormskirk and St Helens to the southeast)
* A565 (from Liverpool and Formby to the south)

The nearest motorway connections are:
*from the southeast – junction 3 of the M58 (via the A570, twelve miles)
*from the south – junction 7 of the M57 (via the A565, fourteen miles)
*from the northeast – junction 1 of the M65 / junction 29 of the M6 (via the A59 and A582, nineteen miles)
An east-west bypass for the A570 at Ormskirk is planned to relieve congestion on Southport&#x27;s main access route to the motorway network, although the effectiveness of the proposals are still under debate.

Several areas within Southport town centre have undergone major road redevelopment; the largest scheme was the construction of the Marine Way Bridge (opened May 2004), which connects the Lord Street shopping district with the new seafront developments. The high structure is thought to have cost in the region of £5 million.

Also one of the main shopping areas in the town, Chapel Street, has undergone a pedestrianisation scheme to be similar to parts of Liverpool city centre.
===Bus===
Due to the limited number of directions by road, many of the services operated in Southport are from one place south to one place north or east of Southport.

The main operator is Arriva North West, that operates two (previously four) services to Liverpool, and two to Wigan and Skelmersdale via Ormskirk, Scarisbrick and Pinfold/Burscough. Arriva also operate three regular, local services, as well as a twice a day variation of service 46 (46B), six circular services around Formby, and used to operate one seasonal service (serving Pontins to the south of the town).

Stagecoach Merseyside &amp; South Lancashire (Preston Depot) operates three services in Southport, the 2 (Preston – Southport), the X2 (Preston – Southport – Liverpool) and the 347 (Chorley – Rufford – Southport).

Cumfybus operate three regular, local services.

Huyton Travel (HTL Buses), operate one service, the 152 (St Helens, Merseyside – Ormskirk – Southport)

===Rail===

Southport railway station has a frequent service of trains to Liverpool, operated by Merseyrail and a regular service to Wigan, Bolton, Manchester and Leeds. In addition, there are stations at , and on the Liverpool line, part of the Merseyrail network, and at on the Manchester line.

The Liverpool line was originally built by the Liverpool, Crosby and Southport Railway in 1848, to a temporary terminus at , this line was extended to in 1851. It was followed on 9 April 1855 by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway and East Lancashire Railway (who had jointly taken over the Manchester and Southport Railway before it became operational) with a line from to a terminus at , with later stations at and . Chapel Street and London Street were adjacent and all operations were transferred to Chapel Street in 1857.

Formerly, Southport was served by three further railway lines:

* From 1882, the West Lancashire Railway operated from Southport Derby Road station (also known as Southport Central) to Preston Fishergate Hill. It had stations in Southport at Ash Street, , , and . This line was shut in 1964, and nowadays, Southport and Preston are linked only by the (largely dual-carriageway) A565 and A59 roads.
* In 1884, another line from Southport to Liverpool was opened: the Cheshire Lines Committee&#x27;s Southport &amp; Cheshire Lines Extension Railway extended the CLC&#x27;s North Liverpool Extension Line from Liverpool Central to Southport Lord Street. It had stations in Southport at and . 
* The West Lancashire Railway sponsored the Liverpool, Southport and Preston Junction Railway to provide a connection to the CLC line, joining it at Altcar and Hillhouse. It had stations in Southport at Butts Lane and Kew Gardens. These lines ultimately proved uncompetitive, and the Southport services were withdrawn in 1952.

In July 1897, both the West Lancashire and the Liverpool, Southport and Preston Junction Railways were absorbed into the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (L&amp;Y). The L&amp;Y had a large terminus at Southport Chapel Street and could see no sense in operating two termini at very close proximity. In 1901, the L&amp;Y completed a remodelling of the approach lines to Central to allow trains to divert onto the Manchester to Southport line and into Southport Chapel Street Station. Southport Central was closed to passengers and it became a goods depot eventually amalgamating with Chapel Street depot. It survived intact well into the 1970s.

On Southport Pier can be found the now closed Southport Pier Tramway which used to transport passengers from the Promenade to the pier head over on a gauge. This closed in 2016 because of the effect on the pier of the weight of the trams.

The Lakeside Miniature Railway passes under the pier, carrying passengers along the western side of the marine lake. The line claims to be the oldest continuously running gauge railway in the world.

==Education==
There are several schools in the town. The all-girls Greenbank High School is situated next to the Royal Birkdale Golf Club, and is a certified Specialist Language school. Actress Miranda Richardson was educated at the school. Its brother school is the all-boys Birkdale High School, which specialises in mathematics.

There are several other high schools in the town, including Meols Cop High School, Stanley High School, which is a specialist sports school (whose former students include comedian Lee Mack and chef Marcus Wareing), and Christ the King High School.

===Independent schools===
The town&#x27;s last remaining independent preparatory school, Sunnymede School, which was in Westcliffe Road, Birkdale closed in 2010 due to a lack of pupils. In the past the town had more independent schools which included Tower Dene, Brighthelmston School (girls) and University School (boys). Kingswood College (originally St Wyburn&#x27;s) is now housed outside Southport at Scarisbrick Hall.

===Further education===
The town has two further education colleges: Southport College, situated near to the town centre, and King George V College (KGV), located on Scarisbrick New Road in the Blowick area of the town.

Courses at Southport College include Diplomas, NVQs, BTECs and Access courses. In addition, Southport College offers some higher education courses in conjunction with the University of Central Lancashire, Edge Hill University and Liverpool John Moores University.

King George V College offers both A-Level and Business And Technology Education Council (BTEC). It opened as King George V Sixth Form College in 1979, and replaced the former King George V Grammar School for Boys, which occupied the same site from 1926 until its demolition in stages during the 1980s as the college was fully opened. In 2013, the college was the best performing state-funded college in an 18-mile radius of KGV. However, by 2015 Ofsted reported that it &#x27;Requires improvement&#x27;. In 2016, Ofsted again rated it poorly, and a government report suggesting merging it with nearby Southport College.

==Media==

===Newspapers===
The town&#x27;s media consists of two newspaper groups, and two radio stations. The independently owned &quot;Champion&quot; newspaper is a free weekly paper, while &quot;The Mid-week Visiter&quot; and &quot;The Southport Visiter&quot; (part of Reach plc&#x27;s &quot;Sefton &amp; West Lancs Media Mix&quot; titles) are free and paid-for newspapers respectively. The town also falls within the circulation areas of three regional hard copy newspapers; &quot;The Liverpool Echo&quot;, &quot;The Liverpool Daily Post&quot; and &quot;The Lancashire Evening Post&quot;. Southport is also covered by several local and regional magazines, like &quot;Lancashire Life&quot;. The local Ranger Service, which is part of Sefton MBC, runs a quarterly free magazine called &quot;Coastlines&quot;.

Old Southport newspapers now out of print are as follows: &quot;Independent&quot; 1861–1920s; &quot;Liverpool &amp; Southport News&quot; 1861–1872; &quot;Southport News&quot; (West Lancs) 1881–1885; &quot;Southport Standard&quot; 1885–1899; &quot;Southport Guardian&quot; 1882–1953; &quot;Southport Journal&quot; 1904–1932; &quot;Southport Star&quot;; and &quot;Southport Advertiser&quot;.

The area also has online media sites, including the UK&#x27;s first online newspaper, the &quot;Southport Reporter&quot;, as well as Internet forums and blog sites.

===Broadcasting===

In line with the origins of the modern game, the club was composed of old public school boys, and was formed with the intention of &quot;improving the physical development of our young townsmen.&quot; The driving force behind the formation of the club was Dr George Coombe (later Sir George Augustus Pilkington) of Southport Infirmary.

<text>Carlton Chester &quot;Cookie&quot; Gilchrist (May 25, 1935 – January 10, 2011) was an American football fullback who played in the American Football League (AFL) and the Canadian Football League (CFL). He was named the AFL Most Valuable Player (MVP) with the Buffalo Bills in 1962. He was named to the AFL All-Time Second-team.

==Career==
A star player at Har-Brack High School in Natrona Heights, Pennsylvania, in 1953 he led the team to the W.P.I.A.L. co-championship with Donora. As a junior, he was talked into signing a professional football contract with the NFL&#x27;s Cleveland Browns by Paul Brown. The signing was against NFL rules and likely illegal, and when Brown reneged on his promise that Gilchrist would make the team, Gilchrist left training camp at Hiram College, in Hiram, Ohio, and went to Canada to play. There, in the Ontario Rugby Football Union (ORFU), he received the Jim Shanks (Team MVP) Trophy for the Sarnia Imperials in 1954, and the Kitchener-Waterloo Dutchmen&#x27;s Team MVP Award in 1955.

In 1956, he joined the Canadian Football League (CFL) with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, helping lead them to a 1957 Grey Cup victory. He spent one season with the Saskatchewan Roughriders, rushing for 1,254 yards. He then was traded to the Toronto Argonauts for Tex Schwierer, and played three years in Toronto. In his six years in the CFL, Gilchrist was a divisional All-Star at running back five consecutive years from 1956 to 1960 (there were no All-Canadians selected in those years) and was also an Eastern All-Star at linebacker in 1960. Additionally, in 1960 he was runner up for the CFL&#x27;s Most Outstanding Player Award. In his CFL career, Gilchrist recorded 4,911 rushing yards, 1,068 receiving yards and 12 interceptions.

Gilchrist then joined the roster of the Buffalo Bills of the fledgling American Football League. Incidentally, Gilchrist was Buffalo&#x27;s backup plan: they had actually drafted Ernie Davis to be the team&#x27;s franchise running back in 1962. Davis instead chose the NFL, but died of leukemia before ever playing a down of professional football. The Bills instead signed Gilchrist as a free agent. While with Buffalo, Gilchrist played fullback and kicked, though he insisted he could have played both ways. He was the first 1,000-yard American Football League rusher, with 1,096 yards in a 14-game schedule in 1962. That year, he set the all-time AFL record for touchdowns with 13, and he earned AFL MVP honors. Gilchrist rushed for a professional football record 263 yards and five touchdowns in a single game against the New York Jets in 1963. Though he was with the Bills for only three years (1962–1964), he remains the team&#x27;s ninth-leading rusher all-time, and led the league in scoring in each of his three years as a Bill. Gilchrist ran for 122 yards in the Bills&#x27; 1964 American Football League championship defeat of the San Diego Chargers, 20–7. His 4.5 yard/rush average is second as a Bill only to O.J. Simpson. One of Gilchrist&#x27;s strengths was blocking. Gilchrist&#x27;s blocking was mentioned by broadcaster and ex-coach John Madden during a CBS TV broadcast in the 1987 season, saying &quot;Cookie Gilchrist may have been the best blocking running back that ever played the game.&quot;

In an early civil rights victory for black athletes, Gilchrist led a successful boycott of New Orleans as the site of the 1965 American Football League All-Star game. He is the only athlete to turn down being enshrined into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame and Museum, because of what he described as racism and exploitation by management. However, Gilchrist had stated before his death that he never turned down the Hall, instead stating that it was &quot;not that simple&quot;. When he was informed about being nominated by the Hall by John Agro (counsel for the Canadian Football League Players Association), he was told to be &quot;nice&quot; to Jake Gaudaur, the CFL commissioner, and Gilchrist stated that he would &quot;take it under advisement&quot; due to his strained relations with Gaudaur while also expressing the belief that Canada had treated him as a &quot;persona non grata&quot; from 1956 to 2010.

Gilchrist frequently was at odds with team management. He told a reporter from the &quot;London Free Press&quot; that most of the problems he encountered were a result of his standing up for principles at a time when black athletes were expected to remain silent.

Gilchrist was traded to the Denver Broncos before the 1965 season in exchange for fullback Billy Joe and cash.
He played for the Broncos in 1965 and 1967, and for the Miami Dolphins in 1966. He was sent to the man who started his career, Paul Brown in the Cincinnati Bengals expansion draft in 1968, but retired because of knee problems. He was an American Football League All-Star in 1962, 1963, 1964 and 1965, making him one of only a few professional football players who made their league&#x27;s All-Star team for 10 consecutive years (six in the CFL, and four in the AFL). Gilchrist was selected as the fullback of the All-Time American Football League Team. The Professional Football Researchers Association named Gilchrist to the PRFA Hall of Very Good Class of 2013.

Gilchrist was named to the Bills&#x27; Wall of Fame during the team&#x27;s home game on October 29, 2017, against the Oakland Raiders.

==After football==

In 1974, Gilchrist founded the United Athletes Coalition of America to help former football players adjust to life after retirement. In 1975, he booked Marvin Gaye, Ike &amp; Tina Turner, and Taveres for a benefit concert at Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto.

Gilchrist had numerous feuds with the people he worked with during his football career. It has been stated that he refused entry into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame because he did not believe he was paid well enough for his service, while other sources contend it Gilchrist rejected the honor due to how he was treated in the past. However, Gilchrist stated that he did not turn down the Hall, stating the following in 2010:

::&quot;My throat cancer is in remission, my weight is the same. Tell Kaye Vaughan and the crew those days were the greatest in my life. I have great respect for every Canadian Football Player who played with and against me.

::I loved Canada and the Canadian people. However Canada does not love Cookie Gilchrist. And I never turned down the Hall Of Fame. When John Agro told me to be nice to Jake Gaudaur, when he told me I was nominated to be inducted, I told Jake I would take that under advisement, and he or they made a lie out of it. Adolf Hitler said the truth when he said the bigger the lie, the more people believe it.

::&quot;What is my crime? I never robbed, raped, stolen, lied, cheated, sold drugs, beat my wife or children. So. Why did the country treat me as a persona non grata from 1956 to 2010? But it&#x27;s okay, I know how to deal with all the players now. It will all come out in the production of my life story once all the T&#x27;s are crossed and the I&#x27;s dotted.&quot;

He also refused to accept enshrinement on the Buffalo Bills Wall of Fame because he wanted payment for appearing; Van Miller eventually convinced Gilchrist to change his mind, but Gilchrist was not inducted prior to his death. Gilchrist was posthumously inducted into the Greater Buffalo Sports Hall of Fame in 2011. Gilchrist did accept induction onto the Bills&#x27; Wall of Honor, the predecessor to the Wall of Fame that had been set up at War Memorial Stadium in 1970, but none of the honorees on that wall were carried over to Rich Stadium when it was built in 1973. On August 30, 2017, the Bills announced that he would be inducted into the Buffalo Bills Wall of Fame.

In an article in &quot;The Buffalo News&quot; on March 18, 2007, Gilchrist, then 71, announced that he was being treated for throat cancer. At the time, he lived in Natrona Heights, Pennsylvania.

On January 10, 2011, Gilchrist died at an assisted living facility in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Gilchrist was posthumously diagnosed with stage four chronic traumatic encephalopathy, which may explain, in part, some of his behavioural difficulties. Gilchrist was aware of the possibility that he had the disease when writing his autobiography, &quot;The Cookie That Did Not Crumble&quot;, along with Chris Garbarino. Consequently, he donated his brain to the Canadian Sports Concussion Project for use in their study of CTE. Gilchrist was one of at least 345 NFL players to be diagnosed after death with this disease, which is caused by repeated hits to the head.

<doc id="310745" wikidata="Q232125" url="?curid=310745" title="Louise de La Vallière">
<text>Françoise-Louise de La Baume Le Blanc, Duchess of La Vallière and Vaujours (6 August 1644 – 6 June 1710) was a French noblewoman and the mistress of King Louis XIV of France from 1661 to 1667.

La Vallière joined the royal court in 1661 as maid-of-honour to Henrietta of England and soon became Louis XIV&#x27;s mistress. Two of her five children by the King, Marie-Anne, Mademoiselle de Blois (Princess of Conti by marriage) and Louis, Count of Vermandois, survived infancy and were legitimised. She was an important participant in the court&#x27;s intellectual life, interested in the arts, literature, and philosophy. 

In 1666, she was replaced as mistress by Madame de Montespan, but created a &quot;suo jure&quot; duchess and invested with lands. After an illness in 1670, La Vallière turned to religion, and wrote a popular devotional book. In 1674, she entered a Carmelite convent in Paris where she died in 1710.

== Ancestry and early life ==

=== Family ===
Françoise&quot;-Louise&quot; , Mademoiselle de La Vallière was born on 6 August 1644 at the (or Hôtel de la Vallière) in Tours as the daughter of Laurent de La Baume Le Blanc, &quot;Seigneur&quot; of La Vallière (1611–1651) and his wife, Marie-&quot;Françoise&quot; Le Provost de La Coutelaye (died 1686). She had an older brother, Jean-François, later Marquis of La Vallière (1642–1676).&quot;&quot;

In La Vallière&#x27;s paternal family, Catholicism and royalism were important values,&quot;&quot; many relatives chose an ecclesiastical or military career. Her maternal family belonged to the &quot;noblesse de robe&quot;. Her father served as governor of the Castle of Amboise where she occasionally visited him. He was a devout Catholic who practiced penance and charity,&quot;&quot; and owned a library of forty-four folios, extensive for the time. In March 1651, during the Fronde, he held Amboise against the forces of the revolt and remained loyal to King Louis XIV.

=== Childhood ===

La Vallière and her brother were raised at the family seat, the Castle of La Vallière. Their uncle, Gilles de La Vallière (born 1616) was responsible for their education. La Vallière was instructed by the , where two of her aunts lived, in reading, grammar, musical composition, and public speaking. The family owned horses, and she may have gained her love of equitation then; her limping in later life may have been caused by a horse riding accident from this time.

Laurent de La Baume Le Blanc died in the summer of 1651, leaving his family in debt. His widow decided to reclaim her dowry and dower to finance a new marriage, which would have meant relinquishing guardianship of her children and depriving them of their maternal inheritance. Safeguarding the interest of the children, La Vallière&#x27;s paternal family persuaded Françoise Le Provost to settle the debts and accept the furnishings of the family home in place of her dower. She rented the furniture back to her children with an interest. What happened to La Vallière at this time is unknown, but she may have been sent to her aunts’ convent.

=== Life in the household of Gaston, Duke of Orléans ===
In March 1655, Françoise Le Provost married Jacques de Courtavel, Marquis of Saint-Rémy&quot;, maître d’hôtel&quot; (butler) of the exiled Gaston, Duke of Orléans (uncle of Louis XIV). Saint-Rémy had a daughter of La Vallière&#x27;s age, Catherine, and the couple had a third daughter together. The family lived at the Duke&#x27;s household in Blois. La Vallière and her stepsister became &quot;demoiselles de compagnie&quot; (lady&#x27;s companions) to the Duke&#x27;s younger daughters and met the also-exiled &quot;Grande Mademoiselle&quot;, paternal half-sister of the princesses. La Vallière befriended Anne-Constance de Montalais, another &quot;demoiselle de compagnie&quot;, who remained her confidante for years.

Lair says the education of girls in the Orléans court was neglected, while Conley claims that they were taught painting, music, etiquette, and equitation, as well as literature and philosophy by the Duke&#x27;s almoner, Armand-Jean le Bouthillier de Rancé. La Vallière may have been introduced to neo-Aristotelian thought by Rancé. Huertas argues that La Vallière had to receive a good education based on her exceptional spelling. Petitfils sees her education as more rudimentary, being only in ‘reading, prayer, [...] sewing, and embroidery’, but agrees that she was well-trained in the necessary skills for a career at court (such as dancing and horse riding). King Louis XIV was an important topic of conversation among the girls due to plans that the eldest Orléans princess would marry him. In August 1659, the King visited Blois; this was the first time La Vallière saw him. Around the same time, Jacques de Bragenlonge, son of the Duke&#x27;s intendant, fell in love with her. Their letters were discovered by her mother, who forbade her from writing to him. She had a ‘good reputation’; the Duke once said that La Vallière certainly did not take part in mischief, as ‘she [was] too sensible for that’. Later in life, she attributed the ‘beginning of [her] fall’ to the self-assurance she gained from his praise.

In February 1660, the Duke died and his widow, Marguerite of Lorraine, moved the household to the Luxembourg Palace in Paris. The Orléans daughters and their friends spent their time with balls and feasts organised by the &quot;Grande Mademoiselle&quot;. In August 1660, La Vallière was present at the &quot;joyeuse entrée&quot; of Louis and his new wife, Maria Theresa of Spain, into Paris.

== Secret lover of Louis XIV ==

=== Background ===

In April 1661, the King&#x27;s younger brother, Philippe, the new Duke of Orléans (‘Monsieur’), married Henrietta of England (‘Madame’). Madame&#x27;s household was organised by Madame de Choisy, Jeanne de Bélesbat de Hurault, a distant relative of La Vallière and member of the former Orléans household. She placed La Vallière and Montalais in the new Orléans household as &quot;filles d’honneur&quot;. La Vallière and her brother (who was embarking on a military career) had no money, but nobody was willing to lend to minors. They petitioned a judge who instructed their mother and stepfather to borrow money for them. La Vallière joined the Orléans household in the Tuileries Palace after the wedding. On 19 April, they moved to the court in Fontainebleau. The King&#x27;s attendants courted the maids-of-honour of Madame; La Vallière&#x27;s suitor was Armand de Gramont, Count of Guiche.
The King and Madame grew close. Louis’ wife Maria Theresa, his mother, Anne of Austria, and Monsieur all disapproved. Rumours spread that the King and his sister-in-law were in love. The King may have been advised to pretend to be in love with others, or they may have decided to do so together with Madame. Huertas and Petitfils suggest that the ploy was Henrietta&#x27;s idea to deceive the Queen Mother. Olympia Mancini, Countess of Soissons, assisted them. Henrietta may have chosen the decoys herself, including La Vallière and Bonne de Pons d’Heudicourt.

The King fell in love with La Vallière. She reciprocated his feelings and probably believed them to have been sincere from the beginning. They exchanged letters through , the King&#x27;s &quot;premier écuyer&quot; (‘first squire’). Their sexual relationship started around the end of July 1661, after about six weeks of courtship. The Queen Mother noticed that her son neglected religious practice and around mid-July discovered the identity of La Vallière. She reminded Louis of his duty to his country and God, asking him to hide his feelings for La Vallière from his wife. Louis did not end his relationship but promised to conduct it secretly.La Vallière was described as ‘innocent’, ‘submissive’, ‘natural[ly] modest’, ‘sincere’, even ‘naïve’, different from the women Louis had known, but fitting contemporary feminine ideals. She was not flirtatious and did not act out of self-interest, exhibiting an ‘absolute loyalty’ to the King. She was described as tall, slim, and graceful despite her limp, with blue eyes, fine, silver-blond hair, and a ‘beautiful’ voice. Fraser suggests that La Vallière refrained from pursuing material benefits through her relationship because she needed to conceptualise it as ‘pure’ or ‘holy’ to fit it into her religious worldview.

In his memoirs, claims to have been in love with La Vallière, not knowing about her affair. The King saw them when he was painting La Vallière. Brienne complimented her appearance to him, which embarrassed her. Later, discovering Louis and La Vallière together, he understood the situation. Louis then questioned him about his feelings and asked for his painting of La Vallière; Brienne promised never to talk to her again. However, by the time this story supposedly happened, Brienne had probably already heard about the King&#x27;s affair from the Queen Mother.

=== First years of the relationship ===

Nicolas Fouquet, superintendent of finances noticed that the King was neglecting his religious and administrative duties. He learned La Vallière&#x27;s identity by 27 June through his network of spies. He wanted to establish a political relationship with the new favourite and sent her a letter complimenting her appearance and offering a bribe, which she refused. He then attempted to talk to her. La Vallière informed the King, who seems to have believed that Fouquet tried to seduce her. This probably added to his resentment against Fouquet, whose vast fortune, probably embezzled, he envied. In September, Fouquet was arrested and imprisoned until his death in 1680.

La Vallière grew isolated because of her relationship, as Madame resented her for it. The devotion of the King for La Vallière was strengthened in October 1661, when he had a conflict with his wife who supported her father, Philip IV of Spain in a diplomatic conflict. If the Orléans household was established separately from the court, the King regularly dined there, probably to see La Vallière. La Vallière grew closer with Montalais. According to Madame de La Fayette, a contemporary who later wrote a fictionalised biography of Madame, the King disapproved, considering Montalais to be a ‘schemer’. He seems to have been jealous of any close relationship La Vallière had. He disliked her mother and rarely permitted them to see each other.

During Lent 1662, a guest preacher, Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet delivered a series of sermons criticising the King&#x27;s behaviour through biblical examples. In late February, Louis questioned La Vallière about an alleged affair between Madame and the Count of Guiche, but she refused to answer. After their argument, troubled by Bossuet&#x27;s sermons, she fled the Tuileries for the Augustinian Convent of Sainte-Pélerine in Chaillot. The King was informed during an audience with Spanish envoys, rushed to end the talks, and searched for her personally amid fears that his wife would learn of his affair because of La Vallière&#x27;s disappearance. La Fayette claims that Madame and Monsieur were reluctant to admit La Vallière back into their household, but she was permitted to stay. The King&#x27;s affair became public when he did not take communion on Easter. His failure to participate in the Eucharist had already been noted, but when he did not receive the sacrament on Easter (which all Catholics were commanded to do), it caused a ‘scandal’. Since people who were ‘living in sin’, such as committing adultery, could not receive the Eucharist, courtiers became aware that Louis was conducting a sexual affair.
In March 1662, Olympia Mancini, Countess of Soissons conspired with the Count of Guiche and to replace La Vallière with someone she could control. They sent an anonymous letter to the Queen informing her of her husband&#x27;s adultery and accusing La Vallière of trying to undermine her position. The message was intercepted and given to the King, who exiled Guiche. In the summer of 1662, while he was in Saint-Germain-en-Laye, Soissons drew the King&#x27;s attention to Anne-Lucie de La Mothe-Houdancourt. She was famous for her beauty and for not granting sexual favours to her admirers; the King pursued her for some time, but Soisson&#x27;s attempt failed.

In 1663, Louis gave a pension to La Vallière&#x27;s brother, the Marquis of La Vallière, married him to a wealthy heiress, and put him in charge of a cavalry unit despite his lack of experience. After this public show of favour, in July 1663, Soissons and Madame informed the Queen of the King&#x27;s affair; Maria Theresa was devastated and the King furious. Fraser and Petitfils argue that Maria Theresa had to have already suspected her husband&#x27;s infidelity: in 1662, while giving birth to her second child, she saw La Vallière pass through the room, and said in Spanish, ‘this maiden [...] is the one the King wants’.

=== First pregnancy and aftermath ===
In summer 1663, La Vallière became pregnant. In late August, the King left on a military campaign, and his chief minister, Jean-Baptiste Colbert, transmitted letters between the couple. When Louis returned in October, La Vallière left Madame&#x27;s service and the King bought her the small Palais Brion near the Palais-Royal. Anxious to hide her condition, she never left the house and received guests in bed. She suffered from headaches and sometimes lost her sight. Colbert arranged for the child to be raised by his servants, Guy Focart Beauchamp and Clémence Pré (a married couple), who were told that it was an illegitimate child of Colbert&#x27;s brother. On 19 December 1663, at around three in the morning, La Vallière gave birth to a son. At six, the physician, Dr Boucher (who also delivered the Queen&#x27;s children) took him to a carriage with the Beauchamps who transported him to Saint-Leu. He was christened Charles, registered as the son of ‘Monsieur de Lincourt’ and ‘Élisabeth de Beux’, with Beauchamp and his wife as godparents. He died in infancy, within two years of his birth, probably of influenza.

Despite precautions, the story spread. People speculated about La Vallière&#x27;s disappearance and a talk the King had with Dr Boucher. La Vallière attended midnight mass on 24 December to counter rumours, but scorn was so great that she fled before the end of the service. Courtiers observed that she was ‘very pale’ and ‘much changed’, taking this as proof that she had given birth. The situation was worsened by a story invented by Boucher: at the same time as he was helping La Vallière, another lady called for him. To explain his absence, he told her that he had been blindfolded and taken to deliver the child of a masked woman. Courtiers said that this woman was La Vallière. After the birth, with Queen Maria Theresa aware of the affair, it was impossible to hide the relationship. La Vallière became isolated, as ladies who wanted to retain the favour of the queens did not associate with her. She continued living in the Palais Brion. As companion, she was assigned Claude-Marie du Guast d’Artigny who spied on her for the King.

==== &quot;Les Plaisirs de l&#x27;île enchantée&quot; ====
Between 5 and 14 May 1664, Louis XIV hosted and personally planned a feast called &quot;Les Plaisirs de l’île enchantée&quot; (‘The Pleasures of the Enchanted Isle’) in Versailles (this was the first major event there). It was officially dedicated to Queen Maria Theresa and the Queen Mother, but secretly addressed to La Vallière. She was present and seated at the royal table, even though she was no longer a member of the Orléans household. In June, Louis and his mother had an argument; the Queen Mother reminded her son of the ‘peril to his salvation’. Crying, he told his mother that he was ‘sometimes’ ashamed but that his ‘passions had become stronger than his reason’ and he was no longer trying to end his affair.

== &quot;Maîtresse-en-titre&quot; ==
Louis moved La Vallière back to court. His relationship with his mother deteriorated, and they briefly stopped talking. In September, he took La Vallière to a reunion with his brother and sister-in-law in Villers-Cotterêts. Queen Maria Theresa could not attend because of her pregnancy, and she was distraught by his behaviour. According to the memoir of a contemporary, Françoise Bertaut de Motteville, the King promised his wife that after the age of thirty (he was then twenty-six), he would be an ‘examplary husband’, but left with La Vallière.
Lair considers La Vallière as official favourite from the time of the festivities at Villers-Cotterêts. Courtiers now sought to be close to her. When they returned to Vincennes, the King took his mistress to the Queen Mother&#x27;s salon to play cards with Monsieur and Madame. Neither queen was present, but hearing of the episode enraged them. Petitfils argues that the King made the decision to declare La Vallière &quot;maîtresse-en-titre&quot; (official royal mistress) out of love, despite his desire to avoid offending either public morals or his wife and mother. Seeing La Vallière&#x27;s isolation, he wanted to legtimate her position as far as possible. Whether La Vallière asked him to do so, or whether she wanted the position herself, is unknown. A contemporary observer noted that La Vallière had ‘never shown any pride’ when receiving the monarch&#x27;s visits. The King lived with her openly, going on walks, hunts, and carriage rides in public.

On 8 December 1664, Armand-Charles de La Porte, Duke of La Meilleraye, husband of Hortense Mancini and an extremely jealous person, publicly rebuked the King for ‘scandalising the nation’ and urged him to ‘correct himself’, claiming to be ‘speaking from God’. The King ridiculed him by touching his forehead and saying, ‘I have always suspected that you have some injury there’ (the exact words have been recorded differently in primary sources). The Duke retired from public life. Many courtiers were offended by the King&#x27;s open adultery, but the common people were singing about it and considered the King&#x27;s choice a mark of good taste, as La Vallière was seen as more attractive than the Queen.

=== Second pregnancy and marriage plans ===
On 7 January 1665 at noon, La Vallière gave birth to a second son in the Palais Brion with Dr Boucher. At nine in the evening, the physician gave the newborn to Colbert who delivered him to Monsieur Bernard, his servant; he was baptised Philippe, registered as the son of ‘François Derssy, bourgeois’ and his wife, ‘Marguerite Bernard’. The child was raised in the Tuileries by Colbert&#x27;s wife, Marie Charron. The King visited him often and grew to love him. The child was ‘robust’, ‘promised much’, and resembled his father. He died of a cardiac arrest at the end of July 1666.

Queen Maria Theresa, gravely ill at the time, asked her husband to arrange La Vallière&#x27;s marriage; he agreed that she could wed if the queens found a match. Arranging a marriage for their extramarital partners was a common way for monarchs to provide for them, but marrying would have defeated La Vallière&#x27;s idea of a ‘holy devotion’ to her sovereign. According to diplomatic records from early 1665, there was a proposed match between her and the Marquis of Vardes. Both refused the marriage. The same dispatch mentions that the Palais Brion was attacked but the perpetrators were never identified; the King assigned guards to the house. The first book about La Vallière&#x27;s affair, by Roger de Rabutin, Count of Bussy, a disgraced courtier who was imprisoned for his work, was written around 1665 and published in 1666, titled &quot;Les Amours du Palais-Royal&quot; (‘Loves of the Palais-Royal’). It depicted La Vallière as a ‘gentle, kind, [and] selfless’ person who loved the King ‘for himself’, concluding that she would ‘always be the King&#x27;s great love’. She was becoming known around the country as Louis’ mistress.

In October 1665, the King had a short affair with Catherine-Charlotte de Gramont, Princess of Monaco, developed a ‘flirtatious friendship’ with Anne de Rohan-Chabot, Princess of Soubise, and had at least ‘occasional’ sexual encounters with Madame de Soissons. He probably also slept with other women put forward by factions hoping to replace La Vallière. Their relationship, however, remained strong and La Vallière was reportedly happy. They shared a love of hunting, in which La Vallière was regarded as a talent. A diplomat reported seeing her ride a Barb horse bareback, using only a silk string to guide it, standing up and sitting down while it was moving; she handled the pistol and the lance expertly. She was trained by a squire of Moorish origins. During her time as royal mistress, La Vallière played an important role in the intellectual life of the court. She belonged to the circles of libertines such as Isaac de Benserade and Antonin Nompar de Caumont, Duke of Lauzun. She read the popular books of the age and took painting and sculpture classes at the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture. She was interested in philosophy, reading and discussing &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot; by Aristotle and &quot;Discourse on Method&quot; by René Descartes.

=== Death of Anne of Austria and birth of third child ===
Queen Anne died on 20 January 1666, relieving Louis of the only person who could control him. He no longer saw a reason to act against his wishes in his personal life. On the 27th, Queen Maria Theresa invited La Vallière to stand next to her at mass to display her complacency to her husband. However, there were signs that the King&#x27;s love was diminishing. Courtiers who sensed the change derided her for not being beautiful and witty enough. On 2 October 1666, La Vallière gave birth to her daughter Marie-Anne at Vincennes. During the delivery, Madame passed through her room on the way to church. La Vallière told her that she was suffering from colic, and urged Dr Boucher to ensure that the birth was over by the end of mass. She masked the smell of blood with flowers to receive visitors. She was present at the &quot;medianoche&quot; (midnight meal) of the court. The &quot;Grande Mademoiselle&quot; claimed that even though she tried to keep her pregnancies and children hidden, courtiers were aware of them.

=== End of relationship with Louis XIV ===

By the end of 1666, the King seems to have become bored with the La Vallière. Athénaïs, Marquise of Montespan started working to replace her. She was ‘high-spirited and amusing’, considered an extraordinary beauty; with her full figure, she was more in line with contemporary beauty ideals than the thinner La Vallière. She was a member of the salons of the &quot;précieuses&quot;. When her husband embarked on a military career, Montespan had an opportunity to seduce the King. She befriended both La Vallière and the Queen, visiting them daily to see the King. La Vallière&#x27;s detractors agreed that she could not ‘amuse’ the King without Montespan&#x27;s witty conversation. Louis started a sexual relationship with her between November 1666 and July 1667.

It is unclear when sexual relations between La Vallière and the King ended. Plans to arrange her marriage or give her a &quot;suo jure&quot; title were renewed, seen by contemporaries as a sign of her retirement. That year, Louis XIV started to pursue personal ‘glory’ through military conquests and magnificent feasts. La Vallière participated in courtly ballet performances, as did Montespan. The King decided to march on Flanders, starting the War of Devolution. On Easter 1667, he took communion again in preparation for the war. In a dispatch from 29 April 1666, a diplomat reported that La Vallière was ‘losing much of her beauty’, becoming ‘very thin’. ‘[A]lmost nobody’ visited her anymore. He found that she was behaving ‘arrogantly’ with courtiers and ‘boldly’ towards the King; public opinion held that she would soon be replaced for this. On 4 May, Louis and Madame de Montespan went on a carriage ride alone.

==== Legitimisation of her daughter ====

On 13 May, the King published a letter patent to legitimise his only living child with La Vallière, Marie-Anne. He conferred on her Chasteau in northern Touraine, including the ruins of a fortress on Lake Val Joyeux (Vaujours) and created a duchy ‘to be enjoyed by the said &quot;damoiselle&quot; Louise-Françoise de La Vallière, and, after her death, by Marie-Anne [...] [and] her [legitimate] heirs and descendants’. Marie-Anne was authorised to use her mother&#x27;s surname and soon afterwards given the courtesy title of Mademoiselle de Blois. The King lamented his mistake in committing adultery and promising that ‘he shall never return to it’ to his advisors and his wife.

Legitimising the ‘natural’ children of French kings was regular practice, yet devout courtiers and those anxious for their privileges as ‘lawful’ descendants of aristocratic houses scorned the decision. Louis later explained in his &quot;Mémoirs&quot; that he wanted to provide for his mistress and child in case he died in war. He considered it ‘just’ to grant Marie-Anne ‘the honour of her birth’ and reward La Vallière in a way ‘suited to [his] affection’. Her brother was promoted in the army and her uncle made a bishop. It seems that La Vallière was not aware that her lover&#x27;s actions signalled the end of the relationship. She was pregnant again, but her unborn child (and any later offspring) was not included in the succession of her duchy. 

==== Journey to Flanders ====
The military camp left for Compiègne on 24 May; from the ladies of the court, only the Queen and her ladies-in-waiting (including Montespan) were permitted to go. After a few weeks, La Vallière and her sister-in-law travelled to the camp without permission. She arrived at the Queen&#x27;s household at La Fère on 20 June. Maria Theresa was upset by her coming, cried, did not sleep, felt ill, and had violent outbursts. She forbade her staff from giving food to La Vallière. When she went to church, she ordered the door of the royal gallery to be closed so that La Vallière could not go near her; when she greeted Maria Theresa in front of the church, the Queen ignored her. During the following carriage ride, Montespan told Maria Theresa, ‘I admire [La Vallière&#x27;s] boldness in daring to appear before the Queen’, adding, ‘God forbid that I should be the King&#x27;s mistress! Yet if I were, I should be quite ashamed in front of the Queen’. Maria Theresa cried.In Guise, La Vallière did not attend the Queen&#x27;s &quot;coucher,&quot; probably sensing the hostility that surrounded her. On 22 June, the Queen reached the camp at Avesnes. When the approach of the King was announced, La Vallière commanded her carriage to cut the path through the fields at full speed. Upon reaching the sovereign, La Vallière threw herself at his feet, but he received her coldly. He only paid her a formal visit to satisfy customs. She did not attend the &quot;cercle&quot; (royal reception) at night, probably to avoid rebukes By this time, Montespan was certainly Louis’ lover, but he insisted on following etiquette: as a duchess, La Vallière attended mass with the Queen, travelled in her carriage, and dined at the royal table. Maria Theresa remained angry with her; neither of them were aware that she had already been supplanted. Montespan and La Vallière were still friends. Many of La Valliére&#x27;s early biographers, such as Charles Dreyss or Pierre Clément judged La Vallière harshly for this episode, describing her behaviour as ‘foolish haughtiness and cruel vanity’. She was openly mocked by the ladies of the court.

== Later life at court ==
La Vallière returned to Paris, while the court stayed at Compiègne and Louis went on campaign. The Queen received a letter telling her that the King had taken Montespan as his mistress, but she did not believe it. When the King returned to Compiègne, La Vallière went there; Louis was noted to sometimes visit her. He then went on a tour of conquered towns, while La Vallière was in Versailles. She re-joined the court in Saint-Germaine-en-Laye, where the King visited her thrice a day. On 2 October, she gave birth to Louis, who was taken away in secrecy. The King, who loved his older children by La Vallière, showed no care for him. Elizabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate claims that the King was ‘led to believe’ by Montespan and her supporters that La Vallière&#x27;s youngest child had been fathered by the Duke of Lauzun.

Montespan&#x27;s husband returned and became extremely jealous, loudly complaining about the relationship between his wife and the King. He publicly lectured Louis on biblical morality, promising to take revenge by contracting a sexually transmitted infection so that his wife would infect the King. After he insulted and threatened the elderly Julie d’Angennes, Duchess of Montausier (whom he blamed for his wife&#x27;s adultery), the King imprisoned him. He was freed on the condition that he exiled himself to his country estate. There, he announced the death of his wife, organised a funeral, wore mourning clothes, and forbade his children to contact their mother. In order to contain the scandal, La Vallière remained the official mistress and had to share an apartment with Montespan so that the King could visit her.&quot; 

‘Double adultery’, an extramarital affair in which both parties are married to others, was considered a grave sin by the church, and adulterous women could be imprisoned in a convent for life. Madame de Montespan had to be protected from the legal and personal attacks of her husband (who was known to be physically violent). Lair argues that La Vallière endured these humiliations to protect the interests of her son and because she had little income. Her son was acknowledged by the King in February 1669, created count of Vermandois, and made admiral of France, which ensured Louis’ personal control of the navy.&quot; In March 1669, Montespan gave birth to her first child by the King.

During her time at court, La Vallière lived in several places, first in the Palais Brion until the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture moved there in July 1665. Then the King gave her an &quot;hôtel particulière&quot; in the , near the Tuileries. She owned it until her entry into the convent, when her brother inherited it. Around 1668, she owned a pavilion in the &quot;rue de la Pompe&quot; in Versailles&quot;;&quot; in 1672, the King bought its land to build new stables. In 1669, she was had a pavilion in the Tuileries; she owned a house in Saint-Germaine-en-Laye from March 1669 to December 1674, and had her own apartment in the palace there.

=== Religious turn and &quot;Réflexions sur la miséricorde de Dieu&quot; ===

After the end of her affair with Louis XIV, La Vallière settled into a quiet life at court. She continued studying, reading historical, theological, and philosophical works. In 1670 (certainly before May), during a near-fatal, long illness (perhaps smallpox), she had a vision of her soul at the gates of hell, from which the ‘thunder of God’ awakened her. She turned to religion and abandoned her previous, libertine friends. She read the spiritual works of the Counter-Reformation, being most influenced by Teresa of Ávila&#x27;s &quot;The Way of Perfection.&quot; Bossuet became her spiritual guide. With his help, she wrote her &quot;Réflexions sur la miséricorde de Dieu&quot; (‘Reflections on the Mercy of God’) in 1671, which was published anonymously in 1680. It became a popular devotional book among French Catholics, reprinted at least ten times, often under her name.Her authorship of &quot;Réflexions&quot; was later contested. In 1853, argued that the book had been conceived by Bossuet and merely written down by La Vallière. However, the style of &quot;Réflexions&quot; differs from that of Bossuet&#x27;s own work and contains a woman&#x27;s autobiographical notes. In 1928, Marcel Langlois, a literary critic claimed that La Vallière could not have written the book as its ‘rationalist tone’ cannot belong to a woman. He argued that no women of La Vallière&#x27;s time had the knowledge of philosophy and theology demonstrated in the book, or read the Bible in Latin as its author had. However, La Vallière was known in salons for her understanding of Aristotle and Descartes, and many women of her circles read religious texts in Latin, as defended. Her authorship has been asserted through textual analyses by Jean-Christian Petitfils and Monique de Huertas.
After her conversion, a confessor wanted to allow her to take communion immediately, but she refused, finding herself ‘unworthy’. The second wife of Monsieur, Elizabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate recounts questioning La Vallière about why she remained a &quot;‘suivante’&quot; (a servant or companion) of Montespan. She replied that she wished to ‘do penance [...] suffer[ing] what was most painful for her, to share the King&#x27;s heart [with another woman] and see herself despised by him [...], offer[ing] all her pains to God as atonement for her past sins; for, since her sins had been public, her penance had to be public too’. Courtiers saw her new religiousness as a hypocritical ploy to achieve material gains from the King. Her potential marriage was mentioned again, possibly to Lauzun. In late June 1670, Madame died. She agonised for a long time and believed that she had been poisoned. La Vallière was present at her deathbed. In her last hours, she was told by a canon, , that ‘all [her] life had been but sin’, and she repented publicly. When she complained of excruciating pain, Feuillet told her to embrace the suffering and think of God. Courtiers remained under the impression of Madame&#x27;s sudden death and her repentance for a long time.

=== Second flight to Chaillot ===

In early spring 1671, La Vallière fled to the Visitation convent of the &quot;Filles de Sainte-Marie&quot; (‘Daughters of the Virgin Mary’) in Chaillot. She took with her none of her belongings and only left a letter to the King. Whereas he had personally pursued La Vallière in 1662, this time Louis continued his planned activities; however, he was noted to have cried during a carriage ride. He sent Lauzun to persuade La Vallière to return, but he failed, as did Bernardin Gigault de Bellefonds, Marquis of Bellefonds, a good friend of La Vallière. To Bellefonds, La Vallière said that she ‘would have left the court sooner’ but she had felt unable to never see the King again. She added that her ‘weakness’ for Louis remained, but she wanted to dedicate the ‘rest of her life’ to ensuring her own salvation. When hearing this, the King cried but sent Colbert to retrieve La Vallière, by force if necessary. Montespan opposed her potential return and quarrelled with the King.

Colbert asked La Vallière to return so that the King ‘could speak to her further’. She agreed on the condition that Louis would permit her to enter a convent ‘if she persevered’. She had spent around twelve hours in Chaillot. Montespan ran to receive her with open arms and tearful eyes; the King talked with her for an hour, crying. Some faulted La Vallière for being ‘inconstant [in her] resolution’ to live a religious life, while others thought that she had acted ‘foolishly’ by returning without exploiting her stronger bargaining position. The &quot;Grande Mademoiselle&quot; believed that the King would have secretly been happy to ‘get rid of’ La Vallière. Lair argues that Louis still needed La Vallière as a cover for his affair with Montespan because his suit for her separation from her husband did not progress.

The King decided to march on Flanders again and invited La Vallière, who declined. Since her presence was necessary for Montespan, the King commanded her to go. Even her detractors considered her behaviour after her return from Chaillot ‘dignified and reserved’. Onlookers were scandalised to see the King ride in a carriage sitting between his two mistresses. During these years, La Vallière practiced charity, especially towards the poor of Vaujours. She grew close to the Queen who pitied her for her humiliations and appreciated her repentance. Religious practice gained importance in La Vallière&#x27;s life: she prayed and meditated often, avoided events and company that could have ‘distracted’ her, and wore a cilice under her robe.

=== Background of retirement ===

La Vallière&#x27;s children were raised by Colbert and his wife; she only saw them occasionally. Her eight-year-old daughter, Marie-Anne, Mademoiselle de Blois, a child of ‘lively and precocious intelligence’ attended her first ball in January 1674, in her mother&#x27;s presence Bellefonds worried that La Vallière&#x27;s attachment to her daughter would prevent her from entering the convent. She admitted that she had ‘sensitivity’, but her feelings for her children were conflicted because of their ‘sinful’ birth: ‘I confess that I was delighted to see her [...] But, at the same time, I had scruples about it [...] These are rather opposite emotions, yet I feel them as I tell you’. She commissioned a painting of her and her children, probably as a remembrance for them.Many noblewomen retired as &quot;pensionnaires&quot; (boarders) to the Visitation convent of the &quot;Filles de Sainte-Marie&quot; (‘Daughters of the Virgin Mary’) in Chaillot. They lead relatively unrestricted lives, maintainting their social networks and not bound by a vow; they could leave or marry at any time. However, when it was suggested to her, La Vallière felt that this would not be enough for her as penitence. She considered both the &quot;Couvent des Capucines&quot; (‘Convent of Capuchin Sisters’) and the &quot;Grand Couvent&quot; (‘Great Convent’) of Discalced Carmelites, choosing the latter. There were strict requirements for women who sought to enter: they had to have led a ‘regular’ life, demonstrated a ‘good character’, and never been the cause of scandal. As the Carmelites hesitated to accept her because of her public adultery, she sought the help of Judith de Bellefonds, a nun in the convent and the aunt of her friend. In late October 1673, the Marquis of Bellefonds informed her that she would be accepted as a postulant; however, she was unwell and advised to rest. When she returned to court from her retreat to the convent, her impending retirement became public. She was supported in her decision by Bellefonds, Bossuet, and Paul de Beauvilliers, Duke of Saint-Aignan.

Bossuet helped convince Madame de Montespan to endorse La Vallière&#x27;s departure to the King. While she did not oppose it, she ridiculed it publicly. She sent her confidante, Françoise d’Aubigné, Madame Scarron to dissuade her. Scarron warned La Vallière that it might be too difficult to live as a Carmelite after the comforts of the royal court, advising her that she should enter as a secular benefactress and see whether she could tolerate the rules. La Vallière answered that this would not be proper penitence. By December 1673, as a result of Montespan&#x27;s campaign, courtiers thought that La Vallière had changed her mind and mocked her. In the same month, she stood as godmother to the third child of the King and Montespan, named Louise-Françoise after her. She and her two brothers were then legitimised; this was a way for the King to protect them from Madame de Montespan&#x27;s husband after La Vallière&#x27;s retirement. The separation of the Montespans was pronounced, rendering the use of La Vallière as a front unnecessary. In March 1674, she wrote to Bellefonds that she was ‘leaving the world’ with no ‘regrets’, ‘but not without pain’. 

La Vallière was in debt because of her expenditure (especially on charity), but she had to declare herself debt-free to enter the convent. With Colbert&#x27;s intervention, the King permitted her son, Vermandois, to lend the necessary funds to her. By March 1674, La Vallière had arranged her finances; on 18 April, she gave her jewels to her children and petitioned the King to establish pensions for her mother and step-sister, as well as for her servants. She renounced her paternal inheritance to her brother, the Marquis of La Vallière.

== Carmelite sister ==

=== Postulancy and novitiate ===
La Vallière paid her last visits on 18 April, giving pieces of jewellery to her friends. When she said farewell to the King, he cried. She decided to apologise to the Queen publicly. When Louise de Prie asked her to not do so ‘in front of everyone’, La Vallière replied, ‘As my crimes were public, my penitence must be [public], too’. She kneeled before Maria Theresa, who lifted and embraced her, assuring her that she was forgiven. The sympathy La Vallière aroused worried Montespan, so she invited her to supper, where the &quot;Grande Mademoiselle&quot; also said goodbye. The next day, the court attended mass, where the King cried again and his eyes were red for hours. Then, dressed in her &quot;robe de cour&quot;, she left for the convent with her children, friends, and family. The court gathered to see her leave. She was permitted to wear the habit of the nuns immediately, and she cut her hair (as nuns who have pronounced their vows do) that night.

La Vallière followed the regulations of the Carmelites from her first day. To Bellefonds, she reported that she felt ‘calm’, ‘content’, and in ‘safety’. The King developed doubts about her decision, as this public conversion highlighted his adultery. Courtiers still did not believe that La Vallière would stay in the convent, and spread mocking rumors. She asked the Carmelites to shorten her postulancy, and less than three months after her entry, she had her &quot;vêture&quot; (ceremonial donning of a nun&#x27;s habit). As date, she chose the eighth Sunday after Pentecost, when the Parable of the Lost Sheep was read in churches. Many courtiers attended&quot;.&quot; The bishop-designate of Aire, preached, highlighted La Vallière as an ‘example to all her century’, but warning her about the difficulties of cloistered life. She then received a blessed habit from the Archbishop of Paris, François de Harlay de Champvallon.

In the Holy Week of 1675, she received gratefully the news that the King had separated from Madame de Montespan and took communion; she prayed for the conversion of ‘one [she] had so loved’. After a year of novitiate, she took her perpetual vows on 3 June 1675, in the presence of the Queen, Monsieur, Madame Palatine (his second wife), Mademoiselle (Marie-Louise of Orléans, daughter of Monsieur and the late Henrietta of England), and the &quot;Grande Mademoiselle&quot;. The mass was conducted by Abbot Pirot, with a sermon by Bossuet who celebrated the ‘renewal’ of La Vallière, contrasting it with the attitude of ‘those seeking glory and fame’. He focused more on warning the King than on speaking to La Vallière. The black veil of professed nuns was blessed by Bossuet and handed to the Queen, who gave it to the Prioress, Mère Claire de Saint-Sacrement (‘Mother Claire of the Holy Sacrament’) to cover La Vallière&#x27;s head.

=== Life as a nun ===

As a Carmelite sister, she used the name Louise de la Miséricorde (‘Louise of Mercy’). She was reputed to seek the most humbling tasks despite her frequent headaches, believing that ‘nothing was too base for her’. She asked to become a lay sister, but was only permitted to help novices (as they were given the most humbling chores). She was regularly visited by Rancé (who had been almoner in the Orléans household where she lived as a child), by Queen Maria Theresa (who brought along Madame de Montespan twice), and by her childhood friend, Marguerite of Orléans, Grand Duchess of Tuscany.

Multiple stories preserved by the Carmelites recount her discipline. One or two years after her entry, Madame Palatine brought La Vallière&#x27;s son, Vermandois to visit. When the eight- or nine-year-old wanted to kiss his mother, La Vallière refused him. Even though she would have been allowed to embrace her child because of his young age, and despite the entreaties of Madame Palatine and her son’ distress, La Vallière did not relent. Both guests left in tears. She resolved to never see her children again, which the King opposed as he believed that they needed the advice of their mother. The Carmelites considered it a duty to maintain family ties if it was not for their own pleasure but as a service to others.La Vallière&#x27;s brother died in October 1676, followed closely by a nun whom she had known from the Orléans household. She envied them but ‘submit[ed]’ to God&#x27;s will that she would stay alive ‘as a sacrifice’. Her brother had been indebted, and her creditors approached La Vallière. She petitioned the King to allow her nephew to inherit his father&#x27;s position. In his reply granting the wish, Louis that he would offer his condolences in person if he were a ‘good enough man to see a Carmelite as holy as’ she.
Her daughter, Mademoiselle de Blois continued to be raised by Madame Colbert. In 1680, she married Louis-Armand, Prince of Conti. The Prince and his cousin Henri-Jules, Prince of Condé visited La Vallière, and Conti treated his mother-in-law with reverence; she became her spiritual advisor. Her &quot;Réflexions&quot; was also published for the first time that year. Despite being anonymous, the book alluded heavily to La Vallière&#x27;s person. Its preface covertly attacked the King and Montespan (who was still his mistress) by saying, ‘[m]ay Heaven grant that those who followed her in her sins may imitate her in her penance and make good use of the time that the mercy of God gives them to think seriously about their salvation’. The book became a success and was soon translated to German.
==== Death of her son ====
Aged thirteen, Vermandois joined the libertine circles of Philippe, &quot;Chevalier de Lorraine&quot;. After numerous scandals, the King exiled and briefly imprisoned him in Normandy. La Vallière was distressed by her son&#x27;s fate. On his own request, Vermandois was then deployed to the Spanish Netherlands. Only sixteen, combat took a toll on him; he developed a fever and died on 18 November 1683. In the 18th century, people speculated that Vermandois was the Man in the Iron Mask, declared dead but imprisoned for life. At the time, no one doubted that he had died, and he was mourned publicly for his great potential.

The Prioress was tasked with informing La Vallière of his death, but she met her before finding the right words. Seeing her sadness and hesitation, La Vallière (who was aware of her son&#x27;s illness but not of its gravity) said, ‘I understand well’ and went to the chapel to pray. She was never seen to cry for her son, nor did she talk about her grief. A friend advised her that crying could relieve her and that God did not forbid nuns to grieve. ‘One must sacrifice everything; it is for myself that I must weep’, she answered, referring to her sin of having children out of wedlock. In November 1685, her son-in-law died of smallpox, and La Vallière was again ‘firm and resigned’. Lair argues that this was another form of penance: she refused the usual comforts of mourning people to increase the pain caused by her losses. The next year, her mother died; it is unknown how this affected her.

==== Later life ====
La Vallière continued to look after her family. Her niece by her brother, Louise-Gabrielle, was repudiated by her husband, , Duke of Choiseul for her ‘misconduct’. To protect Madame de Choiseul&#x27;s sister Marie-Yolande, La Vallière placed her as a &quot;pensionnaire&quot; in Faremoutiers Abbey and forbade her to contact Madame de Choiseul. In response, Marie-Yolande threatened to kill herself; La Vallière advised the family to let her leave. When Marie-Yolande married in 1697, La Vallière&#x27;s daughter, Madame de Conti asked the King for permission to invite Madame de Choiseul. Louis answered that whatever La Vallière advised should happen, and she allowed Madame de Choiseul to attend. Madame de Conti paid the pensions her mother had requested for relatives and old servants. When the Carmelites wanted to support poor people, La Vallière always turned to her daughter, but she often reprimanded her for her ‘light’ conduct (Madame de Conti&#x27;s behaviour was often considered ‘inappropriate’ for widows by contemporaries).

In 1685, working with Bellefonds, she unsuccessfully attempted to convert Gilbert Burnett to Catholicism during his visit to France. Clément claims that she participated in the theological debates of the century concerning Jansenism, which Lair considers doubtful. Foreign dignitiaries frequently visited her, as well as Madame de Montespan after her disgrace in the Affair of the Poisons. She was regularly visited by the Queen, the Dauphine, (Maria Anna of Bavaria), and Marie-Adélaïde of Savoy. In the community, was appointed &quot;sacristine&quot; (carer of the oratory). She often fasted on bread and water; after experiencing a memory of the refreshments served at the royal court, she only drank half a glass of water for three years. Her physical health was damaged and her superiors urged her to moderate her penance. She suffered from erysipelas but did not seek treatment. She asked to be transferred to ‘one of the poorest [and] most distant’ Carmelite convent, which was refused as the nuns appreciated her company and ‘example’.

Multiple works published during her lifetime discussed La Vallière. A 1678 book by Gatien de Courtilz de Sandras declared that her conversion had reasons other than ‘spite’. In 1695, pamphlets written around 1665 were organised into a book titled &quot;La Vie de la duchesse de La Vallière&quot; (‘The Life of the Duchess of La Vallière’). She became popular among the French; her name was used to sell books to interpret dreams, positioning her as a seer.

==== Death ====

At the end of her life, La Vallière suffered from headaches, sciatica, rheumatism, stomach problems, and other, unspecified internal ailments. She tried to hide her pain and only complained of having to still live. She was permitted to rise two hours earlier than the others. She did so on 5 June 1710; at three in the morning, she was going to the chapel when pain overcame her. She leaned against a wall, unable to speak, and was found two hours later. Doctors performed bloodletting but concluded that she was dying. She refused to use linen instead of her usual coarse bedding. Seemingly happy about imminent death, she repeated the phrase, ‘expiring in the most severe pain, that is what befits a sinner’. At night, she asked for Extreme Unction, confessed and took communion. Abbot Pirot administered the last rites around eleven in the morning. When Madame de Conti arrived, her mother could no longer speak. She died at noon on 6 June 1710. When the King was informed of La Vallière&#x27;s death, he did not seem moved, saying that she had died for him the day she entered the convent.

According to the convent&#x27;s customs, La Vallière&#x27;s body was displayed in the church behind the grille separating the enclosure. Crowds came to see her, and four nuns were necessary to handle the objects people asked to be touched to her body for a blessing. When clergymen arrived to inter the corpse, the laypeople present prayed for La Vallière&#x27;s intercession with God on their behalf. She was buried in the cemetery of the Carmelite nuns, a small headstone inscribed with her religious name marking the place. The cemetery, including her grave, was desecrated during the French Revolution.

<doc id="310751" wikidata="Q1884468" url="?curid=310751" title="Magnesia (regional unit)">
<text>Magnesia (, &quot;Magnisía&quot;, , Ancient Greek: &quot;Magnēsía&quot;, deriving from the tribe name &quot;Magnetes&quot;) is one of the regional units of Greece. It is part of the region of Thessaly. Its capital is the city of Volos. About 70% of the population of Magnesia live in the Greater Volos area, which is the second-largest city in Thessaly and the third busiest commercial port in Greece.

According to the most recent census (2021), the population stands at 177,448. The regional unit hosts 2,000,000 tourists annually. Magnesia is represented in the Greek Parliament by six seats. Its main agricultural products are wheat, cotton, tomatoes, grapes, olives, apples and honey.

==Geography==

A prominent geographic feature of Magnesia is the Pagasetic Gulf, a bay of the Aegean Sea. The Pelion mountain range closes off the Gulf on the east and south side, leaving only a narrow channel near Trikeri. The highest peak of the wooded Pelion is &quot;Pourianos Stavros&quot; or &quot;Xeforti&quot;, (altitude ). On the south edge of Magnesia peninsula Tisaio mountain is found.

Mt. Maurovouni () is the northeasternmost mountain of the regional unit and extends to the neighboring regional unit of Larissa. The southwest border of Magnesia is formed by the Othrys, with its highest peak &quot;Gerakovouni&quot; (). The interior of Magnesia has two plains. The plains southwest of the Pagasetic Gulf are called the Almyros plains, while the plains northwest of the Gulf are called the Volos-Velestino plain. The hydrological network of Magnesia is not particularly rich and is characterized by the absence of big rivers. The waters coming from Pelion shape the rivers Anavros, Platanorema, and Xirias.

In the North section of Magnesia, Lake Karla was formerly found. Lake Karla was drained in 1962, but attempts have been made for its partial restoration. On the bight of Sourpi, next to Amaliapolis a coastal wetland is located, with various species of migratory birds. This wetland together with the forest of Kouri – an infrequent lowland of oak forest close to Almyros – is included in the list of the protected regions of the European Network Natura 2000.

===Climate===

The average temperature is 17 degrees Celsius and the average rainfall about 540 millimetres per year. Heat waves and intense cold periods are rare. During the summer the temperature rises up to about in August. The climate varies in different parts of the prefecture; close to the Pagasetic Gulf conditions are humid, in Nea Ionia it is quite dry and in Velestino and Almyros is the climate is continental. In winter there is significant snowfall in the mountains and often freezing temperatures.

==Administration==


The regional unit Magnesia is subdivided into 5 municipalities. These are (number as in the map in the infobox):
*Almyros (2)
*Rigas Feraios (6)
*South Pelion (&quot;Notio Pilio&quot;, 5)
*Volos (1)
*Zagora-Mouresi (4)

===Prefecture===

Magnesia was created as a prefecture. In addition to the territory of the present regional unit of Magnesia, the Magnesia Prefecture included the Northern Sporades group of islands (Skiathos, Skopelos and Alonnisos). As a part of the 2011 Kallikratis government reform, the prefecture was split into the Magnesia and Sporades regional units. At the same time, the municipalities were reorganised, according to the table below.

===Provinces===
*Province of Volos – Volos
*Province of Almyros – Almyros
*Province of Skopelos and Sporades – Skopelos
&quot;Note:&quot; Provinces no longer hold any legal status in Greece.

==History==

===Antiquity===
====Founding====

According to Hesiod&#x27;s (probably) &quot;Eoiae&quot; () or &quot;Catalogue of Women&quot; on the origin of the Greeks, Pandora (named after her grandmother Pandora, sister of Hellen and daughter of Deukalion and Pyrrha) together with Zeus had one son Graecus, while Zeus had two more with Thyia, another of Deukalion&#x27;s daughter: Magnes and Macedon. Magnes and Makednos together with Hellen&#x27;s three sons Dorus, Xuthus (with his sons Ion and Achaeus) and Aeolus, comprised the set of progenitors of the ancient tribes that formed the Greek/Hellenic nation. Magnes ruled the area and people under his name. Magnesia is also homeland of the mythical heroes Jason, Peleus and his son Achilles.

The Magnetes contributed to the Greek colonization, with their main colonies being established before the 7th century BC, under the names of Magnesia beside Sipylus in Lydia and Magnesia on the Maeander in Ionia.

====Nomenclature====

The word magnet comes from the Greek (), which means &#x27;stone of Magnesia&#x27;. The names for the elements magnesium and manganese are also derived from either this region or its colony Magnesia ad Sipylum, which in addition to the magnetic magnetite (an iron ore), produces certain ores of magnesium and manganese that were known to alchemists.

===Common era===
Written accounts and remains from the 5th century CE document the appearance of Christianity in Magnesia. The minutes of the 3rd Ecumenical Conference are co-signed by the Bishop of Dimitriada Cleonikos. Five basilicas have been revealed in Nea Anhialos, showing that the area was undergoing a spiritual growth in that era. Magnesias has churches, monasteries and chapels, many of which are architectural masterpieces in the style that is called &quot;Pelioritica&quot;.

In the area of Pelion are the monasteries of Saint Gerasimos in Makrinitsa, The Holy Archangels in Agios Georgios Nilias, Osios Lavredios in Agios Lavrendis, Saint John the Baptist in Siki and Saint Spiridon in Promiri. The most famous is the Flamouriou Monastery, built in the 16th century by Osios Simeon, the so-called &quot;barefoot and loin-clothed&quot;, located near Veneto.

In the Almyros area and on the mountain of Othris two other monasteries were built, one inhabited by monks in Ano Panagia (Virgin Mary) Xenia and the other by nuns in Kato Panagia Xenia. This monastery holds historical monuments of the area from the 12th century, with of frescoes, treasuries and a library. In Kato Panagia Xenia monastery, an icon of the Virgin Mary, venerated by the people of the area, is kept. All the monasteries are of archeological, historical and artistic interest and are accessible (Flamouriou Monastery only by men).

The prefecture is directly linked to the rest of Europe through International Airport of Central Greece, located in Nea Anchialo a short distance from Volos. The airport includes a terminal which can serve 1,500 passengers per hour.

<text>Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (A1AD or AATD) is a genetic disorder that may result in lung disease or liver disease. Onset of lung problems is typically between 20 and 50 years of age. This may result in shortness of breath, wheezing, or an increased risk of lung infections. Complications may include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cirrhosis, neonatal jaundice, or panniculitis.
A1AD is due to a mutation in the SERPINA1 gene that results in not enough alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT). Risk factors for lung disease include tobacco smoking and environmental dust. The underlying mechanism involves unblocked neutrophil elastase and buildup of abnormal A1AT in the liver. It is autosomal co-dominant, meaning that one defective allele tends to result in milder deficiency than two defective alleles; for example, carriers with an MS (or SS) allele combination usually produce enough alpha-1 antitrypsin to protect the lungs, while those with MZ alleles have a slightly increased risk of impaired lung or liver function. The diagnosis is suspected based on symptoms and confirmed by blood tests or genetic tests.
Treatment of lung disease may include bronchodilators, inhaled steroids, and, when infections occur, antibiotics. Intravenous infusions of the A1AT protein or in severe disease lung transplantation may also be recommended. In those with severe liver disease liver transplantation may be an option. Avoiding smoking is recommended. Vaccination for influenza, pneumococcus, and hepatitis is also recommended. Life expectancy among those who smoke is 50 years while among those who do not smoke it is almost normal.
The condition affects about 1 in 2,500 people of European descent. Severe deficiency occurs in about 1 in 5,000. In Asians it is uncommon. About 3% of people with COPD are believed to have the condition. Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency was first described in the 1960s.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Individuals with A1AD may develop emphysema, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease during their thirties or forties even without a history of smoking, though smoking greatly increases the risk. Symptoms may include shortness of breath (on exertion and later at rest), wheezing, and sputum production. Symptoms may resemble recurrent respiratory infections or asthma.

A1AD may cause several manifestations associated with liver disease, which include impaired liver function and cirrhosis. In newborns, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency can result in early onset jaundice followed by prolonged jaundice. Between 3% and 5% of children with ZZ mutations develop life-threatening liver disease, including liver failure. A1AD is a leading reason for liver transplantation in newborns. In newborns and children, A1AD may cause jaundice, poor feeding, poor weight gain, hepatomegaly and splenomegaly.

Apart from COPD and chronic liver disease, α1-antitrypsin deficiency has been associated with necrotizing panniculitis (a skin condition) and with granulomatosis with polyangiitis in which inflammation of the blood vessels may affect a number of organs but predominantly the lungs and the kidneys.

==Genetics==

Serpin peptidase inhibitor, clade A, member 1 (&quot;SERPINA1&quot;) is the gene that encodes the protein alpha-1 antitrypsin. &quot;SERPINA1&quot; has been localized to chromosome 14q32. Over 75 mutations of the &quot;SERPINA1&quot; gene have been identified, many with clinically significant effects. The most common cause of severe deficiency, PiZ, is a single base-pair substitution leading to a glutamic acid to lysine mutation at position 342 (dbSNP: rs28929474), while PiS is caused by a glutamic acid to valine mutation at position 264 (dbSNP: rs17580). Other rarer forms have been described .

== Pathophysiology ==

A1AT is a glycoprotein mainly produced in the liver by hepatocytes, and, in some quantity, by enterocytes, monocytes, and macrophages. In a healthy lung, it functions as an inhibitor against neutrophil elastase, a neutral serine protease that controls lung elastolytic activity which stimulates mucus secretion and CXCL8 release from epithelial cells that perpetuate the inflammatory state. With A1AT deficiency, neutrophil elastase can disrupt elastin and components of the alveolar wall of the lung that may lead to emphysema, and hypersecretion of mucus that can develop into chronic bronchitis. Both conditions are the makeup of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Normal blood levels of alpha-1 antitrypsin may vary with analytical method but are typically around 1.0-2.7 g/L. In individuals with PiSS, PiMZ and PiSZ genotypes, blood levels of A1AT are reduced to between 40% and 60% of normal levels; this is usually sufficient to protect the lungs from the effects of elastase in people who do not smoke. However, in individuals with the PiZZ genotype, A1AT levels are less than 15% of normal, and they are likely to develop panlobular emphysema at a young age. Cigarette smoke is especially harmful to individuals with A1AD. In addition to increasing the inflammatory reaction in the airways, cigarette smoke directly inactivates alpha-1 antitrypsin by oxidizing essential methionine residues to sulfoxide forms, decreasing the enzyme activity by a factor of 2,000.

With A1AT deficiency, the pathogenesis of the lung disease is different from that of the liver disease, which is caused by the accumulation of abnormal A1AT proteins in the liver, resulting in liver damage. As such, lung disease and liver disease of A1AT deficiency appear unrelated, and the presence of one does not appear to predict the presence of the other. Between 10% and 15% of people with the PiZZ genotype will develop liver fibrosis or liver cirrhosis, because the A1AT is not secreted properly and therefore accumulates in the liver. The mutant Z form of A1AT protein undergoes inefficient protein folding (a physical process where a protein chain achieves its final conformation). 85 percent of the mutant Z form are unable to be secreted and remain in the hepatocyte. Nearly all liver disease caused by A1AT is due to the PiZZ genotype, although other genotypes involving different combinations of mutated alleles (compound heterozygotes) may also result in liver disease. A liver biopsy in such cases will reveal PAS-positive, diastase-resistant inclusions within hepatocytes. Unlike glycogen and other mucins which are diastase sensitive (i.e., diastase treatment disables PAS staining), A1AT deficient hepatocytes will stain with PAS even after diastase treatment - a state thus referred to as &quot;diastase resistant&quot;. The accumulation of these inclusions or globules is the main cause of liver injury in A1AT deficiency. However, not all individuals with PiZZ genotype develop liver disease (incomplete penetrance), despite the presence of accumulated mutated protein in the liver. Therefore, additional factors (environmental, genetic, etc.) likely influence whether liver disease develops.

== Diagnosis ==
The gold standard of diagnosis for A1AD consists of blood tests to determine the phenotype of the AAT protein or genotype analysis of DNA. Liver biopsy is the gold standard for determining the extent of hepatic fibrosis and assessing for the presence of cirrhosis.

A1AT deficiency remains undiagnosed in many patients. Patients are usually labeled as having COPD without an underlying cause. It is estimated that about 1% of all COPD patients actually have an A1AT deficiency. Testing is recommended in those with COPD, unexplained liver disease, unexplained bronchiectasis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis or necrotizing panniculitis. American guidelines recommend that all people with COPD are tested, whereas British guidelines recommend this only in people who develop COPD at a young age with a limited smoking history or with a family history. The initial test performed is serum A1AT level. A low level of A1AT confirms the diagnosis and further assessment with A1AT protein phenotyping and A1AT genotyping should be carried out subsequently.

As protein electrophoresis does not completely distinguish between A1AT and other minor proteins at the alpha-1 position (agarose gel), antitrypsin can be more directly and specifically measured using a nephelometric or immunoturbidimetric method. Thus, protein electrophoresis is useful for screening and identifying individuals likely to have a deficiency. A1AT is further analyzed by isoelectric focusing (IEF) in the pH range 4.5-5.5, where the protein migrates in a gel according to its isoelectric point or charge in a pH gradient.
Normal A1AT is termed M, as it migrates toward the center of such an IEF gel. Other variants are less functional and are termed A-L and N-Z, dependent on whether they run proximal or distal to the M band. The presence of deviant bands on IEF can signify the presence of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. Since the number of identified mutations has exceeded the number of letters in the alphabet, subscripts have been added to most recent discoveries in this area, as in the Pittsburgh mutation described above. As every person has two copies of the A1AT gene, a heterozygote with two different copies of the gene may have two different bands showing on electrofocusing, although a heterozygote with one null mutant that abolishes expression of the gene will only show one band. In blood test results, the IEF results are notated as, e.g., PiMM, where Pi stands for protease inhibitor and &quot;MM&quot; is the banding pattern of that person.

Other detection methods include use of enzyme-linked-immuno-sorbent-assays in vitro and radial immunodiffusion.
Alpha-1 antitrypsin levels in the blood depend on the genotype. Some mutant forms fail to fold properly and are, thus, targeted for destruction in the proteasome, whereas others have a tendency to polymerize, thereafter being retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. The serum levels of some of the common genotypes are:
* PiMM: 100% (normal)
* PiMS: 80% of normal serum level of A1AT
* PiSS: 60% of normal serum level of A1AT
* PiMZ: 60% of normal serum level of A1AT
* PiSZ: 40% of normal serum level of A1AT
* PiZZ: 10–15% (severe alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency)

== Treatment ==
Treatment of lung disease may include bronchodilators, inhaled steroids, and, when infections occur, antibiotics. Intravenous infusions of the A1AT protein or, in severe disease, lung transplantation may also be recommended. In those with severe liver disease liver transplantation may be an option. Avoiding smoking and getting vaccinated for influenza, pneumococcus, and hepatitis is also recommended.

People with lung disease due to A1AD may receive intravenous infusions of alpha-1 antitrypsin, derived from donated human plasma. This augmentation therapy is thought to arrest the course of the disease and halt any further damage to the lungs. Long-term studies of the effectiveness of A1AT replacement therapy are not available. It is currently recommended that patients begin augmentation therapy only after the onset of emphysema symptoms. As of 2015 there were four IV augmentation therapy manufacturers in the United States, Canada, and several European countries. IV therapies are the standard mode of augmentation therapy delivery.

Liver disease due to A1AD does not include any specific treatment, beyond routine care for chronic liver disease. However, the presence of cirrhosis affects treatment in several ways. Individuals with cirrhosis and portal hypertension should avoid contact sports to minimize the risk of splenic injury. All people with A1AD and cirrhosis should be screened for esophageal varices, and should avoid all alcohol consumption. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) should also be avoided, as these medications may worsen liver disease in general, and may particularly accelerate the liver injury associated with A1AD. Augmentation therapy is not appropriate for people with liver disease. If progressive liver failure or decompensated cirrhosis develop, then liver transplantation may be necessary.

== Epidemiology ==

People of Northern European and Iberian ancestry are at the highest risk for A1AD. Four percent of them carry the PiZ allele; between 1 in 625 and 1 in 2000 are homozygous.

Another study detected a frequency of 1 in 1550 individuals. The highest prevalence of the PiZZ variant was recorded in the northern and western European countries with mean gene frequency of 0.0140. Worldwide, an estimated 1.1 million people have A1AT deficiency and roughly 116 million are carriers of mutations.

A1AD is one of the most common genetic diseases worldwide and the second most common metabolic disease affecting the liver.

==History==

A1AD was discovered in 1963 by Carl-Bertil Laurell at Lund University in Sweden.
Laurell, along with a medical resident, Sten Eriksson, made the discovery after noting the absence of the α1 band on protein electrophoresis in five of 1500 samples; three of the five patients were found to have developed emphysema at a young age.

The link with liver disease was made six years later, when Harvey Sharp &quot;et al.&quot; described A1AD in the context of liver disease.

==Research==
Recombinant and inhaled forms of A1AT treatment are being studied.

<text>World records in the marathon are ratified by World Athletics, the international governing body for the sport of athletics .

The late Kenyan athlete Kelvin Kiptum set a men&#x27;s world record time of 2:00:35 on October 8, 2023, at the 2023 Chicago Marathon, a mixed-sex race.

Kenyan athlete Ruth Chepng&#x27;etich broke the women&#x27;s world record with a time of 2:09:56 on October 13, 2024 at the 2024 Chicago Marathon, a mixed-sex race.

In addition to the standard women&#x27;s marathon world record, World Athletics also recognizes a second world record for women in the &quot;Women Only&quot; category, meaning that the marathon was run on a course without any male athletes in the competition. The current &quot;Women Only&quot; record of 2:16:16 was set by Peres Jepchirchir on April 21, 2024 at the London Marathon in the elite women&#x27;s race.

==History==
Marathon races were first held in 1896, but the distance was not standardized by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF, now World Athletics) until 1921.

The actual distance for pre-1921 races frequently varied from the 1921 standard of 42.195 km (26 miles 385 yards). In qualifying races for the 1896 Summer Olympics, Greek runners Charilaos Vasilakos (3:18:00) and Ioannis Lavrentis (3:11:27) won the first two modern marathons. On April 10, 1896, Spiridon Louis of Greece won the first Olympic marathon in Athens, Greece, in a time of 2:58:50. However, the distance for the event was 40,000 meters. Three months later, British runner Len Hurst won the inaugural Paris to Conflans Marathon (also around 40 km) in a time of 2:31:30. In 1900, Hurst would better his time on the same course with a 2:26:28 performance.

Later, Shizo Kanakuri of Japan was reported to have set a world record of 2:32:45 in a November 1911 domestic qualification race for the 1912 Summer Olympics, but this performance was also run over a distance of approximately 40 km.

The first marathon over the official distance was won by American Johnny Hayes at the 1908 Summer Olympics, with a time of 2:55:18.4.

It is possible that Stamata Revithi, who ran the 1896 Olympic course a day after Louis, is the first woman to run the modern marathon; she is said to have finished in hours. World Athletics credits Violet Piercy&#x27;s 1926 performance as the first woman to race the standard marathon distance; however, other sources report that the 1918 performance of Marie-Louise Ledru in the Tour de Paris set the initial mark for women. Other &quot;unofficial&quot; performances have also been reported to be world bests or world records over time: although her performance is not recognized by World Athletics, Adrienne Beames from Australia is frequently credited as the first woman to break the three-hour barrier in the marathon.

In the 1953 Boston Marathon, the top three male finishers were thought to have broken the standing world record, but Keizo Yamada&#x27;s mark of 2:18:51 is considered to have been set on a short course of 25.54 miles (41.1 km). The Boston Athletic Association also does not report Yamada&#x27;s performance as a world best for this reason.

On October 25, 1981, American Alberto Salazar and New Zealander Allison Roe set apparent world bests at the New York City Marathon (2:08:13 and 2:25:29), however, these marks were invalidated when the course was later found to have been 151 meters short. Although World Athletics&#x27; progression notes three performances set on the same course in 1978, 1979, and 1980 by Norwegian Grete Waitz, the Association of Road Racing Statisticians considers the New York City course suspect for those performances, too.

On April 18, 2011, the Boston Marathon produced what were at that time the two fastest marathon performances of all time. Winner Geoffrey Mutai of Kenya recorded a time of 2:03:02, followed by countryman Moses Mosop in 2:03:06. However, since the Boston course does not meet the criteria for record attempts, these times were not ratified by the IAAF.

Eight IAAF world records were set at the Polytechnic Marathon (1909, 1913, 1952–54, 1963–65). WA-recognized world records have been broken at all of the original five World Marathon Majors on numerous occasions (updated 09/2022); twelve times at the Berlin Marathon, three times at the Boston Marathon, five times at the Chicago Marathon, six times at the London Marathon, and five times at the New York City Marathon. However, the records established in the Boston event have been disputed on grounds of a downhill point-to-point course, while four of the five New York records have been disputed on grounds of a short course.
==Criteria for record eligibility==

For a performance to be ratified as a world record by World Athletics, the marathon course on which the performance occurred must be long, measured in a defined manner using the calibrated bicycle method (the distance in kilometers being the official distance; the distance in miles is an approximation) and meet other criteria that rule out artificially fast times produced on courses aided by downhill slope or tailwind. The criteria include:
* &quot;The start and finish points of a course, measured along a theoretical straight line between them, shall not be further apart than 50% of the race distance.&quot;
* &quot;The decrease in elevation between the start and finish shall not exceed an average of one in a thousand (i.e., 1m per km).&quot;

In recognizing Kenyan Geoffrey Mutai&#x27;s mark of 2:03:02 at the 2011 Boston Marathon as (at the time) &quot;the fastest Marathon ever run&quot;, the IAAF said: &quot;Due to the elevation drop and point-to-point measurements of the Boston course, performances [on that course] are not eligible for World record consideration.&quot;

The Association of Road Racing Statisticians, an independent organization that compiles data from road running events, also maintains an alternate marathon world best progression but with standards they consider to be more stringent.

===Women&#x27;s world record changes===

The IAAF Congress, at the 2011 World Championships, passed a motion changing the record eligibility criteria effective October 6, 2007, so that women&#x27;s world records must be set in all-women competitions. The result of the change was that Radcliffe&#x27;s 2:17:42 performance at the 2005 London Marathon supplanted her own existing women&#x27;s mark as the &quot;world record&quot;; the earlier performance is to be referred to as a &quot;world best&quot;.

Per the 2021 IAAF Competition Rules, &quot;&quot;a World Record for performance achieved in mixed sex (&quot;Mixed&quot;) races and a World Record for performance achieved in single sex (&quot;Women only&quot;) races&quot;&quot; are tracked separately.

===Unofficial record attempts===
In December 2016, Nike, Inc., announced that three top distance runners — Eliud Kipchoge, Zersenay Tadese, and Lelisa Desisa — had agreed to forgo the spring marathon season to work with the company in an effort to run a sub-two-hour marathon.

The Breaking2 event took place in the early morning of May 6, 2017; Kipchoge crossed the finish line with a time of 2:00:25. This time was more than two minutes faster than the world record. 

Kipchoge took part in a similar attempt to break the two-hour barrier in Vienna on October 12, 2019, as part of the Ineos 1:59 Challenge. He successfully ran the first sub two-hour marathon distance, with a time of 1:59:40.2. The effort did not count as a new world record under IAAF rules due to the setup of the challenge. Specifically, it was not an open event, Kipchoge was handed fluids by his support team throughout, the run featured a pace car, and included rotating teams of other runners pacing Kipchoge in a formation designed to reduce wind resistance and maximize efficiency. The achievement was recognized by Guinness World Records with the titles &#x27;Fastest marathon distance (male)&#x27; and &#x27;First marathon distance run under two hours&#x27; instead of an official world record.

<doc id="310763" wikidata="Q2393654" url="?curid=310763" title="Armley">
<text>Armley is a district in the west of Leeds, West Yorkshire, England. It starts less than from Leeds city centre. Like much of Leeds, Armley grew in the Industrial Revolution and had several mills, one of which now houses the Leeds Industrial Museum at Armley Mills. Armley is predominantly and historically a largely working class area of the city, still retains many smaller industrial businesses, and has many rows of back-to-back terraced houses.

It sits in the Armley ward of Leeds City Council and Leeds West and Pudsey parliamentary constituency.

In 2022, statistics released by West Yorkshire Police revealed Armley and New Wortley had the second highest crime rate in Leeds after Leeds city centre.

==Etymology==
First attested in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Ermelai&quot;, the name &quot;Armley&quot; comes from Old English. The second element is from Old English &quot;lēah&quot; (&#x27;open space in a wood&#x27;). The origin of the first element is less clear, but thought to come from an otherwise unattested Old English name &quot;Earma&quot;, a plausible nickname form of the name &quot;Earnmund&quot;. If so, the name originally meant &#x27;Earma&#x27;s woodland clearing&#x27;.

Historically lying within the township of Armley, to the south of Armley&#x27;s centre, the district of Green Side is first mentioned by this name in the nineteenth century. The origin of the name is not certain, but is probably named after the green space now constituted as Wortley Recreation Ground and Western Flatts Cliff park.

== History ==


Armley is mentioned in the 1086 &quot;Domesday Book&quot; reference to &quot;Ristone, Ermelai&quot;. At the time there were eight villagers in Ristone (now east Armley) and Ermelai (now west Armley). Armley was recorded as lying within the hundred of Morley and was estimated to comprise only four households, placing it in the bottom fifth of settlements in the Domesday Book by population size. The actual population is indeterminable as this only accounts for the &#x27;head of household&#x27;.

Armley Mills, now the Leeds Industrial Museum at Armley Mills, was the world&#x27;s largest woollen mill when it was built in 1788. In the 18th and 19th centuries Armley was, through its mills, a major contributor to the economy of the city of Leeds. Many of the buildings standing in and around Armley were built in the 1800s, including many of the churches, schools, shops and houses. Ledgard Way is named after the entrepreneur Samuel Ledgard. Armley also has picturesque views over the rest of Leeds from certain vantage points. William Tetley started his business of malters in Armley in the 1740s. His grandson Joshua Tetley founded Tetley&#x27;s Brewery in Hunslet in 1822.

Armley was formerly a township and chapelry in the parish of Leeds, in 1866 Armley became a separate civil parish, on 26 March 1904 the parish was abolished to form Armley and Bramley. In 1901 the parish had a population of 27,521.

Damage caused by a raid in the Leeds Blitz in March 1941 and later slum clearance schemes brought about the redevelopment of much of Armley in a programme beginning in the 1950s and finishing in the early 1970s.

From the 1870s until 1956, Armley was home to the J W Roberts asbestos mattress and boiler lining factory. This facility exposed residents to asbestos fibres and resulted in a mesothelioma cancer cluster which persists to this day. One of the victims, June Hancock, launched a court action against Turner &amp; Newall, the company that owned the J W Roberts&#x27; factory in 1993. Although the court case was successful, corporate restructuring had, as of 2005, avoided the case being settled. Hancock&#x27;s story was the subject of a play, &quot;Dust&quot;, by Kenneth F. Yates, performed in Armley and at the West Yorkshire Playhouse in July 2009.

The parish church, St Bartholomew&#x27;s, is home to a notable pipe organ built by the German organ builder Edmund Schulze. Originally built for Meanwood Towers in 1866–69, it was opened by S. S. Wesley. It was moved to St Bartholomew&#x27;s in 1879. Schulze&#x27;s work, and this organ in particular, had enormous influence on the development of British organ building in the 19th century. Both church and organ have been restored. The smaller Christ Church is located at the end of Theaker Lane nearer the centre of Armley.

Legend has it that a pedlar called Charlie used to rest and water his pony and trap in Whingate Park in the 19th century. He apparently sold spicy shortbread to the citizens of Upper Armley for 1d a piece. Today the triangular-shaped park is known as Charlie or Charley Cake Park. According to &quot;Armley Through the Camera&quot;, written in 1901, the park was &quot;within memory of many present residents of Armley, a patch of wasteland. Some of them regularly played cricket on its turf&quot;.

There were two railway stations in Armley. Armley Moor railway station on the line between Leeds and Bradford Exchange closed 1966, and Armley Canal Road railway station on the line between Leeds and Shipley closed 1965.

==Geography==
Armley is located between the M621 motorway and the River Aire, stretching from roughly the New Wortley roundabout (the Armley Gyratory) to the start of the Stanningley By-pass and Cockshott Lane where it merges into Bramley.

== Amenities ==
Armley Town Street includes high street names, charity shops and food and independent retailers. There are bus links to Leeds, Bradford, Pudsey and Whinmoor. Armley&#x27;s Town Street has free off-road car parking, but parking is mainly on-street, with few car parks in the centre. Armley&#x27;s only supermarket is a LIDL on Armley Road, but Aldi in neighbouring Wortley in a five-minute walk from Town Street.

Other amenities include Armley (Gott&#x27;s) Park, Gott&#x27;s Park Golf Club and Armley Mills Industrial Museum, and numerous former cinemas and churches. The old Methodist chapel is now a carpet outlet, like a similar chapel in Holbeck. There are present-day Methodist churches in Wesley Road, built in 1987, and in Whingate, built in 1884. The Wesley Road Chapel is a Local Ecumenical Partnership also involving the Baptist and United Reformed Churches. The current church is the fourth on this site, where the original Methodist Wesleyan chapel stood and where John Wesley once preached.

Armley&#x27;s original leisure centre, based on the old Armley swimming baths, was demolished in 2009. The land is now a large car park for the new leisure centre. The closure of the original 25-metre swimming pool with redundant and unused space attracted some controversy because of the age and local architectural significance of the building. HM Prison Leeds, formerly Armley Gaol is located in Armley.

==Housing==

Armley housing includes Victorian back-to-back houses, through terraces and tower blocks.

There is much council housing, although most of the housing stock is privately built and dates from the 1960s. Back-to-back housing has been converted to through terraces.

Corporation residential tower blocks, built to replace older housing stock at the centre of Armley, and neighbouring Wortley, are amongst the tallest in Leeds.

<doc id="310767" wikidata="Q1224487" url="?curid=310767" title="Equaliser (mathematics)">
<text>In mathematics, an equaliser is a set of arguments where two or more functions have equal values.
An equaliser is the solution set of an equation.
In certain contexts, a difference kernel is the equaliser of exactly two functions.

== Definitions ==

Let &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; be sets.
Let &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; be functions, both from &quot;X&quot; to &quot;Y&quot;.
Then the &quot;equaliser&quot; of &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; is the set of elements &quot;x&quot; of &quot;X&quot; such that &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) equals &quot;g&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) in &quot;Y&quot;.
Symbolically:
: formula_1
The equaliser may be denoted Eq(&quot;f&quot;, &quot;g&quot;) or a variation on that theme (such as with lowercase letters &quot;eq&quot;).
In informal contexts, the notation {&quot;f&quot; = &quot;g&quot;} is common.

The definition above used two functions &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot;, but there is no need to restrict to only two functions, or even to only finitely many functions.
In general, if F is a set of functions from &quot;X&quot; to &quot;Y&quot;, then the &quot;equaliser&quot; of the members of F is the set of elements &quot;x&quot; of &quot;X&quot; such that, given any two members &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; of F, &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) equals &quot;g&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) in &quot;Y&quot;.
Symbolically:
: formula_2
This equaliser may be written as Eq(&quot;f&quot;, &quot;g&quot;, &quot;h&quot;, ...) if formula_3 is the set {&quot;f&quot;, &quot;g&quot;, &quot;h&quot;, ...}.
In the latter case, one may also find {&quot;f&quot; = &quot;g&quot; = &quot;h&quot; = ···} in informal contexts.

As a degenerate case of the general definition, let F be a singleton {&quot;f&quot;}.
Since &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) always equals itself, the equaliser must be the entire domain &quot;X&quot;.
As an even more degenerate case, let F be the empty set. Then the equaliser is again the entire domain &quot;X&quot;, since the universal quantification in the definition is vacuously true.

== Difference kernels ==

A binary equaliser (that is, an equaliser of just two functions) is also called a &quot;difference kernel&quot;. This may also be denoted DiffKer(&quot;f&quot;, &quot;g&quot;), Ker(&quot;f&quot;, &quot;g&quot;), or Ker(&quot;f&quot; − &quot;g&quot;). The last notation shows where this terminology comes from, and why it is most common in the context of abstract algebra: The difference kernel of &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; is simply the kernel of the difference &quot;f&quot; − &quot;g&quot;. Furthermore, the kernel of a single function &quot;f&quot; can be reconstructed as the difference kernel Eq(&quot;f&quot;, 0), where 0 is the constant function with value zero.

Of course, all of this presumes an algebraic context where the kernel of a function is the preimage of zero under that function; that is not true in all situations.
However, the terminology &quot;difference kernel&quot; has no other meaning.

== In category theory ==

Equalisers can be defined by a universal property, which allows the notion to be generalised from the category of sets to arbitrary categories.

In the general context, &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are objects, while &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; are morphisms from &quot;X&quot; to &quot;Y&quot;.
These objects and morphisms form a diagram in the category in question, and the equaliser is simply the limit of that diagram.

In more explicit terms, the equaliser consists of an object &quot;E&quot; and a morphism &quot;eq&quot; : &quot;E&quot; → &quot;X&quot; satisfying formula_4,
and such that, given any object &quot;O&quot; and morphism &quot;m&quot; : &quot;O&quot; → &quot;X&quot;, if formula_5, then there exists a unique morphism &quot;u&quot; : &quot;O&quot; → &quot;E&quot; such that formula_6.

A morphism formula_7 is said to equalise formula_8 and formula_9 if formula_5.

In any universal algebraic category, including the categories where difference kernels are used, as well as the category of sets itself, the object &quot;E&quot; can always be taken to be the ordinary notion of equaliser, and the morphism &quot;eq&quot; can in that case be taken to be the inclusion function of &quot;E&quot; as a subset of &quot;X&quot;.

The generalisation of this to more than two morphisms is straightforward; simply use a larger diagram with more morphisms in it.
The degenerate case of only one morphism is also straightforward; then &quot;eq&quot; can be any isomorphism from an object &quot;E&quot; to &quot;X&quot;.

The correct diagram for the degenerate case with &quot;no&quot; morphisms is slightly subtle: one might initially draw the diagram as consisting of the objects &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; and no morphisms. This is incorrect, however, since the limit of such a diagram is the product of &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;, rather than the equaliser. (And indeed products and equalisers are different concepts: the set-theoretic definition of product doesn&#x27;t agree with the set-theoretic definition of the equaliser mentioned above, hence they are actually different.) Instead, the appropriate insight is that every equaliser diagram is fundamentally concerned with &quot;X&quot;, including &quot;Y&quot; only because &quot;Y&quot; is the codomain of morphisms which appear in the diagram. With this view, we see that if there are no morphisms involved, &quot;Y&quot; does not make an appearance and the equaliser diagram consists of &quot;X&quot; alone. The limit of this diagram is then any isomorphism between &quot;E&quot; and &quot;X&quot;.

It can be proved that any equaliser in any category is a monomorphism.
If the converse holds in a given category, then that category is said to be &quot;regular&quot; (in the sense of monomorphisms).
More generally, a regular monomorphism in any category is any morphism &quot;m&quot; that is an equaliser of some set of morphisms.
Some authors require more strictly that &quot;m&quot; be a &quot;binary&quot; equaliser, that is an equaliser of exactly two morphisms.
However, if the category in question is complete, then both definitions agree.

The notion of difference kernel also makes sense in a category-theoretic context.
The terminology &quot;difference kernel&quot; is common throughout category theory for any binary equaliser.
In the case of a preadditive category (a category enriched over the category of Abelian groups), the term &quot;difference kernel&quot; may be interpreted literally, since subtraction of morphisms makes sense.
That is, Eq(&quot;f&quot;, &quot;g&quot;) = Ker(&quot;f&quot; - &quot;g&quot;), where Ker denotes the category-theoretic kernel.

Any category with fibre products (pullbacks) and products has equalisers.

<doc id="310780" wikidata="Q159601" url="?curid=310780" title="Eurocopter Tiger">
<text>The Eurocopter Tiger is a four-blade, twin-engine attack helicopter which first entered service in 2003. It is manufactured by Airbus Helicopters (formerly Eurocopter), which arose from the merger of Aérospatiale&#x27;s and DASA&#x27;s respective helicopter divisions. Airbus Helicopters designates it as the EC665. In France and Spain, the Tiger is known as the Tigre (which is French and Spanish for Tiger), while in Germany and Australia it is referred to as the Tiger.

Development of the Tiger started during the Cold War, and it was initially intended as an anti-tank helicopter platform to be used against a Soviet ground invasion of Western Europe. During its prolonged development period the Soviet Union collapsed, changing the European security situation. France and Germany chose to proceed with the Tiger, developing it instead as a multirole attack helicopter. It achieved operational readiness in 2008.

The Tiger has the distinction of being the first all-composite helicopter developed in Europe; even the earliest models also incorporate other advanced features such as a glass cockpit, stealth technology, and high agility to increase its survivability. Improved variants have since entered service, outfitted with more powerful engines and compatible with a wider range of weapons. Since entering service, Tigers have been used in combat in Afghanistan, Libya, and Mali.

==Development==

===Origins and early development===
In 1984, the French and West German governments issued a requirement for an advanced anti-tank helicopter, with one variant desired by the French dedicated to the escort and anti-helicopter role. 

As originally planned, both countries would procure a total of 427 helicopters. The West Germans planned on acquiring 212 models of the anti-tank variant named PAH-2 (&quot;Panzerabwehrhubschrauber&quot; or &quot;Anti-tank helicopter&quot;), with deliveries starting at the end of 1992. The French wanted 75 HAPs (&quot;Hélicoptère d&#x27;Appui Protection&quot; or &quot;Support and Escort Helicopter&quot;) and 140 HACs (&quot;Hélicoptère Anti Char&quot; or &quot;Anti Tank Helicopter&quot;), with deliveries starting at the end of 1991 and 1995 respectively.

A joint venture consisting of Aérospatiale and MBB was subsequently chosen as the preferred supplier. In 1986, the development programme was effectively canceled due to spiraling costs; it had been officially calculated that supplying the German forces with an equivalent number of US-produced McDonnell Douglas AH-64 Apache attack helicopters would have been a considerably cheaper alternative to proceeding with the development of the Tiger. According to statements by the French Defence Minister André Giraud in April 1986, the collaborative effort had become more expensive than an individual national programme and was also forecast to take longer to complete. In July 1986, a government report into the project alleged that development had become distanced from the requirements and preferences of its military customers.

France and Germany reorganised the programme, including steps such as the adoption of fixed-term contracts which placed greater financial risk upon the private firms involved. Thomson CSF also took over the majority of Tiger&#x27;s electronic development work, such as the visual systems and sensors. Despite the early development problems and the political uncertainty between 1984 and 1986, the program was formally relaunched in November 1987; it was at this point that a greater emphasis on the attack helicopter&#x27;s anti-tank capabilities came about. Much of the project&#x27;s organisational framework was rapidly redeveloped between 1987 and 1989; such as the installation of a Franco-German Helicopter Office to act as a program executive agency in May 1989.
In November 1989, Eurocopter signed an agreement that financially secured the majority of the helicopter&#x27;s development through to serial production, including arrangements for two assembly lines to be built at Aerospatiale&#x27;s Marignane plant and MBB&#x27;s Donauwörth facility. This same arrangement also included the manufacture of five Tiger prototypes. Three were to operate as unarmed testbeds and the other two as armed combat prototypes with one for the French escort helicopter variant and the other for the German anti-tank variant. The first prototype took the Tiger&#x27;s maiden flight on 27 April 1991 that lasted for 30 minutes.

Due to the end of the Cold War and subsequent defence budgets decreases in the 1990s, financial pressures led to further questions regarding the necessity for the entire program; in 1992 there was speculation that the German Defence Ministry might not continue with the project due to the requirement to make fiscal cutbacks. However, Germany was also increasingly keen for the Tiger to perform a wider assortment of missions; beyond being an excellent anti-tank platform, the specifications for the German platform were modified to include armed battlefield reconnaissance, close air support of ground troops, and escorting other helicopters.

In 1992, Aérospatiale and MBB, among other companies, merged to form the Eurocopter Group; this led to considerable consolidation of the aerospace industry and the Tiger project itself. A major agreement was struck in December 1996 between France and Germany that cemented the Tiger&#x27;s prospects and committed the development of supporting elements, such as a series of new generation missile designs for use by the new helicopter. National political issues continued to affect the prospects of the Tiger, however. A proposed sale of up to 145 Tigers to Turkey proved a source of controversy; Turkey selected the Tiger as the preferred option, but conflicting attitudes between Eurocopter, France, and Germany in regards to military exports led to Turkey withdrawing its interest.

On 18 June 1999, Germany and France publicly placed orders for an initial batch of 160 Tiger helicopters, 80 for each nation, valued at €3.3 billion. On 22 March 2002, the first production Tiger was rolled out in a large ceremony held at Eurocopter&#x27;s Donauwörth factory; although production models began initial acceptance trials in 2003, the first official delivery to the French Army took place on 18 March 2005; the first official Tiger delivery to Germany followed on 6 April 2005. Germany reduced its order to 57 in March 2013. In 2008 OCCAR estimated the project cost at . France&#x27;s FY2013 budget put their share of the project at €6.4bn (~US$8.7bn), implying a programme cost of €14.7bn (~US$20.1bn) to the three main partners. The 2013 French White Paper changed the mix to 60 HAP and 20 of the more expensive HAD; at FY2013 prices, their HAP cost €27.4m/unit (~US$37m) and their HAD €36.1m/unit (~US$49m), including development costs the French Tigers cost €80m (~US$109m) each. In December 2015, France placed an additional order for 7 HAD helicopters, with the plan to upgrade the entire fleet to the HAD standard by 2025 for a total of 67 helicopters.

===Exports===
During the 1990s, export prospects for the Tiger had been invigorated by two large bids for orders from Britain and the Netherlands. Discreet talks between Britain and France regarding an association with the Tiger had been continuing since the late 1980s and, although Britain had initially dismissed industrial participation in the project, it was known by the mid 1990s that Britain was prepared to purchase modern attack helicopters from abroad. Eurocopter&#x27;s management was keen to press production of the Tiger into action as soon as possible, as uncertainty over the date at which production, and therefore availability, would start was viewed as negatively impacting potential export deals. In both the Netherlands and Britain, a considerable amount of lobbying pressure was applied in the hopes of the Tiger&#x27;s selection. However, neither country would order the Tiger.
On 21 December 2001, Eurocopter was awarded the contract to meet the Australian Army&#x27;s &quot;AIR 87 requirement&quot; for 22 Tiger helicopters of the ARH (Armed Reconnaissance Helicopter) version. Modifications from the standard Tiger included new communications and avionics systems, as well as compatibility with Australian safety requirements. Per the contract&#x27;s terms, 18 of the 22 aircraft were assembled at Australian Aerospace&#x27;s Brisbane facility, a subsidiary of Eurocopter. On 1 July 2007, because of delays in attaining operational capability, Australia&#x27;s Defence Materiel Organisation stopped all payments in regards to the procurement. According to Australia&#x27;s Department of Defence, by 2008 the main issues had been addressed and payments resumed accordingly. In October 2010, it was revealed that the helicopters will not be fully operational for another two years. In December 2011, the final Tiger ARH was delivered to the Australian Army. In August 2019, Australia announced LAND 4503, the Tiger ARH replacement program.

In September 2003, Spain selected a variant of the Tiger HAP combat support helicopter – the Tiger HAD – for its army. The 24 helicopters of this type would be armed with the PARS 3 LR and Mistral missile systems, and feature uprated Enhanced MTR390 engines capable of lifting heavier payloads. Deliveries of the HAD variant began in 2007. The September 2003 arrangements not only involved a procurement deal but the induction of Spain into the Tiger program itself, leading to the greater integration of parts of Spain&#x27;s aeronautics industry with the new multinational Eurocopter organisation. Shortly following Spain&#x27;s order, France chose to not proceed with the pure anti-tank Tiger HAC variant, instead electing to procure the multirole-oriented Tiger HAD being procured by Spain.

In July 2006, the Saudi government signed a €6.9 billion contract for the sale of 142 helicopters, including 12 Tiger attack helicopters. However, in late 2007, the deal was cancelled for unknown reasons.

In May 2007, in response to an issued tender for 22 attack helicopters for the Indian Air Force, the Tiger was entered into a competition against multiple Russian and American helicopters. In late 2009, it was reported that the Tiger would not be able to participate in the Indian field trials as it was to undergo upgrades. In 2011, several Tigers participated in firing trials of the PARS 3 LR missile as part of a sales effort targeted at the Indian armed forces.

In 2012, the Tiger competed for a ₩1.8 trillion contract to provide up to 20 attack helicopters for South Korea, along with the Boeing AH-64 Apache and the TAI/AgustaWestland T-129; South Korea selected the AH-64 in April 2013. In January 2013, Eurocopter was reportedly in active discussions over potential Tiger procurements with Brazil, Malaysia, and Qatar. As of December 2015, the Tiger was reportedly contending for a Polish requirement for a new attack helicopter as a replacement for the Mil Mi-24 fleet.

==Design==
===Overview===
The Tiger is capable of undertaking a wide range of combat missions, including armed reconnaissance and surveillance, anti-tank and close air support, escort and protection of friendly assets; and can operate during day or night in all weather conditions, and has been designed to include operations in the aftermath of nuclear, biological, or chemical warfare. The Tiger can also be used in the maritime environment, able to operate from the decks of ships including frigates, and during extreme weather conditions. Amongst the Tiger&#x27;s notable qualities, it possesses very high levels of agility, much of which is attributed to the design of its 13-meter four-bladed hingeless main rotor; the Tiger can perform full loops and negative &quot;g&quot; manoeuvres. Power is provided by a pair of FADEC-controlled MTU Turbomeca Rolls-Royce MTR390 turboshaft engines.
The Tiger has a tandem-seat &#x27;glass cockpit&#x27; and is operated by a two-man crew; the pilot is placed in the forward position, with the gunner seated behind. Either of the crew members can manage the weapon systems or the primary flight controls, switching roles if necessitated; in addition to flying the aircraft, the Tiger&#x27;s pilot would typically be in control of the self-defence systems and communications, as well as some secondary weapons functions. While some of the weapons use dedicated control interfaces, such as the anti-tank Trigat missile, air-to-air weapons can be managed via controls on both sets of collective and cyclic sticks.

Crew new to the Tiger have to undergo substantial retraining due to the differences from older platforms, particularly in higher workload management and the additional capabilities afforded by the type; one major change from preceding attack helicopters is a far greater degree of operational autonomy. According to Andrew Warner, chief test pilot during the Tiger&#x27;s development, it is &quot;the easiest-handling aircraft I have ever flown&quot;.

The system cost (helicopter, armament, support) and unit cost vary between variants; Australia&#x27;s Tiger ARH has a price per unit of A$ 68 million, the latest Tiger HAD variant is estimated to cost US$ 44–48 million.

===Survivability===
The protection systems employed on the Tiger includes stealth; aspects such as the visual, radar, infrared and acoustic signatures have been minimised to better evade threats that may be present upon the battlefield. According to Andrew Warner, the Tiger&#x27;s survivability &quot;relies on stealth and agility&quot;. The use of composite materials on the airframe has resulted in reductions in radar cross-section (RCS), infrared and acoustic signatures to improve battlefield survivability. The fuselage is armoured and was developed to withstand small arms fire and cannon rounds. The helicopter has various radar/laser warning and missile approach detection systems, including EADS&#x27;s AN/AAR-60 MILDS (Missile Launch Detection System), as well as flares and chaff dispensers.

The Tiger is the first all-composite helicopter developed in Europe. The fuselage of the Tiger is made from 80% carbon fibre reinforced polymer and kevlar, 11% aluminium, and 6% titanium. The entire tail section is made of composites, including the single section tail boom. The rotors are composed of a fibre plastic composite material able to withstand combat damage and bird strikes. The structure of the Tiger also incorporates protection against lightning strikes and electromagnetic pulses via an embedded copper/bronze grid and copper bonding foil.

The design of the Tiger includes a high degree of crash worthiness; many of the onboard systems have redundancies and are segregated to minimise the effect of damage. Components of the propulsion system, such as the rotors and drive shaft, were deliberately designed for greater ballistic tolerance than traditional designs; the gearbox is rated for a 60-minute dry run capability if lubrication is lost. Fuel is contained in two main internal fuel tanks, and an additional two smaller tanks are housed inside the stub wings. Fuel tanks have self-sealing capability to decrease the vulnerability. In the inhospitable conditions of the Afghanistan theatre, the Tiger had a reported operational availability of 90%.

===Avionics and armaments===
Amongst the key avionics features of the aircraft are the EUROGRID battlefield management and map display systems, integrated communications (HF/VHF/FM radio and satellite) and data transfer links, a high-authority digital automatic flight control system, and redundant MIL 1553 data buses. Two redundant mission computers control the weapons, sensors, and targeting functions. The Tiger&#x27;s navigational suite includes GPS, dual redundant inertial referencing, Doppler radar, separated air data units, radio altimeter and distributed air speed sensors. A dedicated nose-mounted forward-looking infrared (FLIR) sensor is used by the pilot for night time flying.

Each crew member has a pair of multifunction liquid crystal data displays at their control station, typically used to display internal systems information and sensory data, and to interact with the aircraft&#x27;s higher systems. An additional display system is available to both crew in the form of the helmet-mounted display (HMD). The HMD is used by the flying pilot to display basic flight data with digitally enhanced optics, such as night vision or infrared imagery from the sensors, superimposed against; the gunner can use the HMD to interact with and control onboard weapon systems and view targeting data.
Perhaps the most significant single avionics system fitted upon the Tiger is the mast-mounted Osiris sight/sensor; this incorporates optical TV and thermal cameras, a laser range finder/tracker/designator, and multiple gyroscopes for stabilisation. Osiris performs as the main sensor for target observation and acquisition, providing firing and targeting data via the weapons computer; Osiris also enables entirely passive target acquisition to be undertaken and was developed to maximise the capabilities of the Trigat anti-tank missile developed in parallel to the Tiger itself. An alternative optical system to Osiris is mounted on the aircraft&#x27;s roof upon some variants.

The Tiger can be fitted with various armaments including rockets, cannons, and a range of air-to-air and air-to-surface missiles, controlled via a dedicated weapons control computer. Munitions for anti-ground warfare include the nose-mounted 30 mm Nexter turret; an assortment of external gun pods, anti-tank missiles, and up to four launchers for 70 and 68 mm rockets can be mounted on the Tiger&#x27;s stub wings. When deploying missiles such as the Mistral, the Tiger is capable of taking advantage of the munition&#x27;s off-boresight capabilities. A guided 70 mm rocket will be developed for the Tiger based on the Roketsan Cirit.

==Operational history==
In December 2008, final qualification of the HAP and UHT variants of the Tiger was completed, marking the platform&#x27;s readiness for operational duties overseas. In May 2009, the Tiger participated in readiness trials off the coast of Toulon to clear the type for active shipboard deployments. By November 2009, nearly 50 Tigers had been delivered to customers and the worldwide fleet had accumulated more than 13,000 flight hours.

In July 2009, three French Tiger HAP helicopters of the 5th Helicopter Regiment arrived at Kabul International Airport in Afghanistan, marking the first active deployment of the Tiger into an active combat zone. The helicopters performed armed reconnaissance and fire support missions, acting in support of coalition ground troops fighting a Taliban insurgency. The Tigers had their operational certification in Afghanistan in early August 2009; one French officer described the Tiger&#x27;s role in the theatre as &quot;find, attack, suppress, seize, raid, and support&quot;. By July 2010, it was reported that the Tiger detachment had totalled 1,000 operational hours in Afghanistan. On 4 February 2011, a French Tiger crashed during a night time operation about 30 miles east of Kabul and both crew members suffered light injuries.
In August 2009, the German magazine reported that the ten operational Tigers in the German Army were only suitable for pilot training, while others had not been accepted due to defects. In May 2010, Germany suspended deliveries over &quot;serious defects particularly with wiring&quot;; in response Eurocopter stated that &quot;Corrective measures related to wiring problems have been developed, agreed by the customer and are being implemented&quot;, and that two corrected helicopters would soon be handed over to the German military.

During the 2011 military intervention in Libya, France deployed the amphibious assault helicopter carrier, carrying a number of Tiger attack helicopters aboard, to the Libyan coast to conduct military operations upon military targets within the country. On 4 June 2011, French Tigers, alongside British Army Apache helicopters, began conducting combat operations in Libya.

In December 2012, a four-ship flight of German Tiger UHTs was deployed to Afghanistan. Operating from Mazar-i-Sharif, they performed reconnaissance, ground support, and convoy protection missions. All had previously undergone upgrades under the ASGARD programme; the modifications include the addition of new defensive systems, sand filters for the MTR390 engines, and enhancements to the communications suite. Between 30 January 2013 and 30 June 2014, the German Tigers flew 1,860 hours and 260 sorties supporting NATO ground troops, Afghan security forces, and humanitarian relief efforts after floods. The model fired its first shots during combat in German service on 4 May 2013, providing armed overwatch to special forces troops with unguided rockets and machine gun fire. The German Army received its last ASGARD-upgraded Tigers in March 2014.

In March 2013, Spain also deployed three Tiger HADs to the region to provide support to the Spanish ground forces.

In January 2013, as part of France&#x27;s intervention in the Northern Mali conflict, a small number of Tigers were deployed for combat operations to that theatre. Early production HADs (Block 1) followed in November 2014 after having been declared combat capable. In March 2017, German Tigers were rotated into the same country in support of MINUSMA, relieving Apaches of the Royal Netherlands Air Force. On 26 July, one of the aircraft in question crashed in the desert 700 kilometres north of Gao, killing both pilots. A subsequent investigation discovered that mistakes by improperly trained civilian maintenance contractors had caused a fatal malfunction.

==Variants==
===Germany===
====Tiger KHT/UHT====
The KHT (from , German for &quot;Attack Helicopter Tiger&quot;) is a medium-weight multi-role fire support helicopter built for the &quot;Bundeswehr&quot; (German Armed Forces). Until October 2013 its designation was &quot;UHT&quot; (from , German for &quot;Support Helicopter Tiger&quot;). Under an agreement between the German government and Eurocopter made in March 2013, a total of 51 Tiger UHs will enter service. The KHT can carry PARS 3 LR &quot;fire and forget&quot; and/or HOT3 anti-tank missiles as well as Hydra 70 air-to-ground fire support rockets from Belgium manufacturer Forges de Zeebrugge (FZ). Four AIM-92 Stinger missiles (two on each side) are mounted for air-to-air combat. Unlike the HAP/HCP version it has no integrated gun turret, but a gunpod can be fitted if needed. The weapon configuration was designed to be multirole and easily convertible to cover the whole spectrum of possible mission scenarios and to be effective against a broad range of targets. Another difference is the use of a mast-mounted sight, which has second-generation infrared and CCD TV cameras (range 18 km).

===France===
====Tiger HAP====
The Tiger HAP/HCP (&quot;Hélicoptère d&#x27;Appui Protection&quot;, French for &quot;Support and Escort Helicopter&quot; / &quot;Hélicoptère de Combat Polyvalent&quot; French for &quot;Multipurpose Combat Helicopter&quot;) is a medium-weight air-to-air combat and fire support helicopter built for the French Army. It is fitted with a chin-mounted GIAT 30 mm gun turret and can carry 68 mm SNEB unguided rockets or 20 mm machine cannons for the fire support role as well as Mistral air-to-air missiles. France&#x27;s 40 HAP were delivered by 2012 at a cost of €27m/unit (~US$36m) in 2012 prices. In December 2015, France decided to upgrade its entire existing Tiger fleet to the HAD standard by 2025.

====Tiger HAD====

The Tiger HAD (&quot;Hélicoptère d&#x27;Appui Destruction&quot;, in French or &quot;Helicóptero de Apoyo y Destrucción&quot; in Spanish for &quot;Support and Destruction Helicopter&quot;) version is essentially identical to the HAP version but better suited for operations in hot environments, with 14% more engine power available due to the upgraded Enhanced MTR390 engines (1,092 kW / 1,464 shp during normal operation; 1,322 kW / 1,774 shp in contingency power mode), maximum take-off weight is increased to 6,600 kg, communication suite is expanded with Up Link and Down Link satellite antenna and better ballistic protection as a result of the specific requests made by the Spanish Army. It is equipped with the Hellfire II and the Spike ER anti-armour missiles. It is suited for attack, escort, ground fire support, armed reconnaissance and air-to-air combat roles.

It was selected by the Spanish Army, and the French Army Light Aviation (ALAT) decided to upgrade most of their HAP helicopters to the HAD variant. In December 2004, Spain ordered 24 of the HAD variant and France ordered 40 HADs. France&#x27;s 40 HAD will cost €35.6m/unit (~US$48m) in 2012 prices.

====Upgrades====
In January 2016, it was announced that France was working with Australia, Germany, and Spain to define a proposed further upgrade to its Tiger fleet, referred to as MkIII upgrade. A key aspect of this upgrade, being scheduled to take place around 2023, is to be the adoption of a common anti-tank missile, as well as further improvements to the communication system.

In March 2022 Airbus announced that it had reached agreement with France and Spain to proceed with the MkIII programme, 42 French helicopters will be upgraded with deliveries beginning 2029 and 18 Spanish beginning 2030, the prototype MkIII is expected to first fly in 2025. Each country&#x27;s MkIII will be slightly different reflecting national requirements, the upgrades include improvements to the mast-mounted electro-optical system; the helmet-mounted sight system; the enhanced vision system; radios; datalinks for manned-unmanned teaming; new air-to-surface and air-to-air missiles, guns, and rockets; improved countermeasures; a new navigation system synchronised to the Galileo satellite navigation system; as well as an updated avionics suite that includes a new tactical data management system and battlefield management system.

====Tiger ARH====
The Tiger ARH (Armed Reconnaissance Helicopter) was the version ordered by the Australian Army to replace its OH-58 Kiowas and UH-1 Iroquois-based &#x27;Bushranger&#x27; gunships. The Tiger ARH is a modified and upgraded version of the Tiger HAP with upgraded MTR390 engines as well as a laser designator incorporated in the Strix sight for the firing of Hellfire II air-to-ground missiles. Instead of SNEB unguided rockets, the ARH used 70 mm (2.75 in) rockets from Belgian developer, FZ. Twenty-two of the variant were ordered in December 2001. Most of the helicopters were operated by the 1st Aviation Regiment based at Robertson Barracks in Darwin. The helicopter was shipped to Australia in part form and locally assembled at Brisbane Airport by Australia Aerospace.

The first two ARH helicopters were delivered to Australia on 15 December 2004. ARH deliveries were to be completed by June 2010 with Full operating capability planned for December 2011.

In 2012 after three incidents with cockpit fumes that endangered aircrew, pilots voted to not fly until all safety concerns were addressed.

In August 2014, the Australian Defence Force and BAE Systems Australia successfully trialled the Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System laser guidance kit for use with the ARH&#x27;s 70mm FZ unguided rockets.

The 2016 Australian Defence White Paper stated that the Tiger helicopters would be replaced with other armed reconnaissance aircraft in the mid 2020s. Issues cited include lack of commonality with the other Tiger variants, high maintenance cost of the engines and the shipping time of sending parts to Europe for repair and reconditioning.

The Australian Army&#x27;s Tiger ARHs reached their final operating capability on 18 April 2016. In April 2019, the Australian Army renewed Airbus Helicopters&#x27; maintenance contract for a further 5 years running through to 2025.

In July 2019, Australia&#x27;s Capability, Acquisition and Sustainment Group (CASG) issued a request for information to replace their Tiger helicopters. This request surprised many experts, as the issues mentioned in the 2016 White Paper appeared to have been mostly resolved. The aim is to procure a &quot;proven and mature, manned, off-the-shelf armed helicopter&quot; that can also operate from Australia&#x27;s growing fleet of helicopter-capable landing ships. The RFI&#x27;s deadlines are very strict: Initial Operational Capability should be attained by 2026 and all 29 aircraft and training system should be delivered by 2029 at the latest.

The Australian Government announced in January 2021 that it would purchase 29 AH-64E Apache Guardians to replace the Tigers.

In June 2024 the Ukrainian Government expressed interest in acquiring Australia&#x27;s fleet of Tigers.

<text>Genetic testing, also known as DNA testing, is used to identify changes in DNA sequence or chromosome structure. Genetic testing can also include measuring the results of genetic changes, such as RNA analysis as an output of gene expression, or through biochemical analysis to measure specific protein output. In a medical setting, genetic testing can be used to diagnose or rule out suspected genetic disorders, predict risks for specific conditions, or gain information that can be used to customize medical treatments based on an individual&#x27;s genetic makeup. Genetic testing can also be used to determine biological relatives, such as a child&#x27;s biological parentage (genetic mother and father) through DNA paternity testing, or be used to broadly predict an individual&#x27;s ancestry. Genetic testing of plants and animals can be used for similar reasons as in humans (e.g. to assess relatedness/ancestry or predict/diagnose genetic disorders), to gain information used for selective breeding, or for efforts to boost genetic diversity in endangered populations.

The variety of genetic tests has expanded throughout the years. Early forms of genetic testing which began in the 1950s involved counting the number of chromosomes per cell. Deviations from the expected number of chromosomes (46 in humans) could lead to a diagnosis of certain genetic conditions such as trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) or monosomy X (Turner syndrome). In the 1970s, a method to stain specific regions of chromosomes, called chromosome banding, was developed that allowed more detailed analysis of chromosome structure and diagnosis of genetic disorders that involved large structural rearrangements. In addition to analyzing whole chromosomes (cytogenetics), genetic testing has expanded to include the fields of molecular genetics and genomics which can identify changes at the level of individual genes, parts of genes, or even single nucleotide &quot;letters&quot; of DNA sequence. According to the National Institutes of Health, there are tests available for more than 2,000 genetic conditions, and one study estimated that as of 2018 there were more than 68,000 genetic tests on the market.

==Types==
Genetic testing is &quot;the analysis of chromosomes (DNA), proteins, and certain metabolites in order to detect heritable disease-related genotypes, mutations, phenotypes, or karyotypes for clinical purposes.&quot; It can provide information about a person&#x27;s genes and chromosomes throughout life.

===Diagnostic testing===
* Cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) testing a non-invasive (for the fetus) test. It is performed on a sample of venous blood from the mother, and can provide information about the fetus early in pregnancy. it is the most sensitive and specific screening test for Down syndrome.
* Newborn screening used just after birth to identify genetic disorders that can be treated early in life. A blood sample is collected with a heel prick from the newborn 24–48 hours after birth and sent to the lab for analysis. In the United States, newborn screening procedure varies state by state, but all states by law test for at least 21 disorders. If abnormal results are obtained, it does not necessarily mean the child has the disorder. Diagnostic tests must follow the initial screening to confirm the disease. The routine testing of infants for certain disorders is the most widespread use of genetic testing—millions of babies are tested each year in the United States. All states currently test infants for phenylketonuria (PKU, a genetic disorder that causes mental illness if left untreated) and congenital hypothyroidism (a disorder of the thyroid gland). People with PKU do not have an enzyme needed to process the amino acid phenylalanine, which is responsible for normal growth in children and normal protein use throughout their lifetime. If there is a buildup of too much phenylalanine, brain tissue can be damaged, causing developmental delay. Newborn screening can detect the presence of PKU, allowing children to be placed on special diets to avoid the effects of the disorder.
* Diagnostic testing used to diagnose or rule out a specific genetic or chromosomal condition. In many cases, genetic testing is used to confirm a diagnosis when a particular condition is suspected based on physical mutations and symptoms. Diagnostic testing can be performed at any time during a person&#x27;s life, but is not available for all genes or all genetic conditions. The results of a diagnostic test can influence a person&#x27;s choices about health care and the management of the disease. For example, people with a family history of polycystic kidney disease (PKD) who experience pain or tenderness in their abdomen, blood in their urine, frequent urination, pain in the sides, a urinary tract infection or kidney stones may decide to have their genes tested and the result could confirm the diagnosis of PKD. Despite the several implications of genetic testing in conditions such as epilepsy or neurodevelopmental disorders, many patients (specially adults) do not have access to these modern diagnostic approaches, showing a relevant diagnostic gap.
* Carrier testing used to identify people who carry one copy of a gene mutation that, when present in two copies, causes a genetic disorder. This type of testing is offered to individuals who have a family history of a genetic disorder and to people in ethnic groups with an increased risk of specific genetic conditions. If both parents are tested, the test can provide information about a couple&#x27;s risk of having a child with a genetic condition like cystic fibrosis.
* Preimplantation genetic diagnosis performed on human embryos prior to the implantation as part of an in vitro fertilization procedure. Pre-implantation testing is used when individuals try to conceive a child through in vitro fertilization. Eggs from the woman and sperm from the man are removed and fertilized outside the body to create multiple embryos. The embryos are individually screened for abnormalities, and the ones without abnormalities are implanted in the uterus.
* Prenatal diagnosis used to detect changes in a fetus&#x27;s genes or chromosomes before birth. This type of testing is offered to couples with an increased risk of having a baby with a genetic or chromosomal disorder. In some cases, prenatal testing can lessen a couple&#x27;s uncertainty or help them decide whether to abort the pregnancy. It cannot identify all possible inherited disorders and birth defects, however. One method of performing a prenatal genetic test involves an amniocentesis, which removes a sample of fluid from the mother&#x27;s amniotic sac 15 to 20 or more weeks into pregnancy. The fluid is then tested for chromosomal abnormalities such as Down syndrome (trisomy 21) and trisomy 18, which can result in neonatal or fetal death. Test results can be retrieved within 7–14 days after the test is done. This method is 99.4% accurate at detecting and diagnosing fetal chromosome abnormalities. There is a slight risk of miscarriage with this test, about 1:400. Another method of prenatal testing is chorionic villus sampling (CVS). Chorionic villi are projections from the placenta that carry the same genetic makeup as the baby. During this method of prenatal testing, a sample of chorionic villi is removed from the placenta to be tested. This test is performed 10–13 weeks into pregnancy and results are ready 7–14 days after the test was done. Another test using blood taken from the fetal umbilical cord is percutaneous umbilical cord blood sampling.
* Predictive and presymptomatic testing used to detect gene mutations associated with disorders that appear after birth, often later in life. These tests can be helpful to people who have a family member with a genetic disorder, but who have no features of the disorder themselves at the time of testing. Predictive testing can identify mutations that increase a person&#x27;s chances of developing disorders with a genetic basis, such as certain types of cancer. For example, an individual with a mutation in &quot;BRCA1&quot; has a 65% cumulative risk of breast cancer. Hereditary breast cancer along with ovarian cancer syndrome are caused by gene alterations in the genes BRCA1 and BRCA2. Major cancer types related to mutations in these genes are female breast cancer, ovarian, prostate, pancreatic, and male breast cancer. Li-Fraumeni syndrome is caused by a gene alteration on the gene TP53. Cancer types associated with a mutation on this gene include breast cancer, soft tissue sarcoma, osteosarcoma (bone cancer), leukemia and brain tumors. In the Cowden syndrome there is a mutation on the PTEN gene, causing potential breast, thyroid or endometrial cancer. Presymptomatic testing can determine whether a person will develop a genetic disorder, such as hemochromatosis (an iron overload disorder), before any signs or symptoms appear. The results of predictive and presymptomatic testing can provide information about a person&#x27;s risk of developing a specific disorder, help with making decisions about medical care and provide a better prognosis.
* Pharmacogenomics determines the influence of genetic variation on drug response. When a person has a disease or health condition, pharmacogenomics can examine an individual&#x27;s genetic makeup to determine what medicine and what dosage would be the safest and most beneficial to the patient. In the human population, there are approximately 11 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in people&#x27;s genomes, making them the most common variations in the human genome. SNPs reveal information about an individual&#x27;s response to certain drugs. This type of genetic testing can be used for cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. A sample of the cancer tissue can be sent in for genetic analysis by a specialized lab. After analysis, information retrieved can identify mutations in the tumor which can be used to determine the best treatment option.

===Non-diagnostic testing===
* Forensic testing uses DNA sequences to identify an individual for legal purposes. Unlike the tests described above, forensic testing is not used to detect gene mutations associated with disease. This type of testing can identify crime or catastrophe victims, rule out or implicate a crime suspect, or establish biological relationships between people (for example, paternity).
* Paternity testing uses special DNA markers to identify the same or similar inheritance patterns between related individuals. Based on the fact that we all inherit half of our DNA from the father, and half from the mother, DNA scientists test individuals to find the match of DNA sequences at some highly differential markers to draw the conclusion of relatedness.
* Genealogical DNA test used to determine ancestry or ethnic heritage for genetic genealogy.
* Research testing includes finding unknown genes, learning how genes work and advancing understanding of genetic conditions. The results of testing done as part of a research study are usually not available to patients or their healthcare providers.

==Medical procedure==
Genetic testing is often done as part of a genetic consultation and as of mid-2008 there were more than 1,200 clinically applicable genetic tests available. Once a person decides to proceed with genetic testing, a medical geneticist, genetic counselor, primary care doctor, or specialist can order the test after obtaining informed consent.

Genetic tests are performed on a sample of blood, hair, skin, amniotic fluid (the fluid that surrounds a fetus during pregnancy), or other tissue. For example, a medical procedure called a buccal smear uses a small brush or cotton swab to collect a sample of cells from the inside surface of the cheek. Alternatively, a small amount of saline mouthwash may be swished in the mouth to collect the cells. The sample is sent to a laboratory where technicians look for specific changes in chromosomes, DNA, or proteins, depending on the suspected disorders, often using DNA sequencing. The laboratory reports the test results in writing to a person&#x27;s doctor or genetic counselor.

Routine newborn screening tests are done on a small blood sample obtained by pricking the baby&#x27;s heel with a lancet.

==Risks and limitations==
The physical risks associated with most genetic tests are very small, particularly for those tests that require only a blood sample or buccal smear (a procedure that samples cells from the inside surface of the cheek). The procedures used for prenatal testing carry a small but non-negligible risk of losing the pregnancy (miscarriage) because they require a sample of amniotic fluid or tissue from around the fetus.

Many of the risks associated with genetic testing involve the emotional, social, or financial consequences of the test results. People may feel angry, depressed, anxious, or guilty about their results. The potential negative impact of genetic testing has led to an increasing recognition of a &quot;right not to know&quot;. In some cases, genetic testing creates tension within a family because the results can reveal information about other family members in addition to the person who is tested. The possibility of genetic discrimination in employment or insurance is also a concern. Some individuals avoid genetic testing out of fear it will affect their ability to purchase insurance or find a job. Health insurers do not currently require applicants for coverage to undergo genetic testing, and when insurers encounter genetic information, it is subject to the same confidentiality protections as any other sensitive health information. In the United States, the use of genetic information is governed by the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) (see discussion below in the section on government regulation).

Genetic testing can provide only limited information about an inherited condition. The test often can&#x27;t determine if a person will show symptoms of a disorder, how severe the symptoms will be, or whether the disorder will progress over time. Another major limitation is the lack of treatment strategies for many genetic disorders once they are diagnosed.

Another limitation to genetic testing for a hereditary linked cancer, is the variants of unknown clinical significance. Because the human genome has over 22,000 genes, there are 3.5 million variants in the average person&#x27;s genome. These variants of unknown clinical significance means there is a change in the DNA sequence, however the increase for cancer is unclear because it is unknown if the change affects the gene&#x27;s function.

A genetics professional can explain in detail the benefits, risks, and limitations of a particular test. It is important that any person who is considering genetic testing understand and weigh these factors before making a decision.

Other risks include incidental findings—a discovery of some possible problem found while looking for something else. In 2013 the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) recommended that certain genes always be included any time a genomic sequencing was done, and that labs should report the results.

DNA studies have been criticised for a range of methodological problems and providing misleading, interpretations on racial classifications.

==Direct-to-consumer genetic testing==
Direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic testing (also called at-home genetic testing) is a type of genetic test that is accessible directly to the consumer without having to go through a health care professional. Usually, to obtain a genetic test, health care professionals such as physicians, nurse practitioners, or genetic counselors acquire their patient&#x27;s permission and then order the desired test, which may or may not be covered by health insurance. DTC genetic tests, however, allow consumers to bypass this process and purchase DNA tests themselves. DTC genetic testing can entail primarily genealogical/ancestry-related information, health and trait-related information, or both. Genetic testing has been taken on by private companies, such as 23andMe, Ancestry.com, and Family Tree DNA. These companies will send the consumer a kit at their home address, with which they will provide a saliva sample for their lab to analyze. The company will then send back the consumer&#x27;s results in a few weeks, which is a breakdown of their ancestral heritage and possible health risks that accompany it. 

There are a variety of DTC genetic tests, ranging from tests for breast cancer alleles to mutations linked to cystic fibrosis. Possible benefits of DTC genetic testing are the accessibility of tests to consumers, promotion of proactive healthcare, and the privacy of genetic information. Possible additional risks of DTC genetic testing are the lack of governmental regulation, the potential misinterpretation of genetic information, issues related to testing minors, privacy of data, and downstream expenses for the public health care system. In the United States, most DTC genetic test kits are not reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), with the exception of a few tests offered by the company 23andMe. As of 2019, the tests that have received marketing authorization by the FDA include 23andMe&#x27;s genetic health risk reports for select variants of BRCA1/BRCA2, pharmacogenetic reports that test for selected variants associated with metabolism of certain pharmaceutical compounds, a carrier screening test for Bloom syndrome, and genetic health risk reports for a handful of other medical conditions, such as celiac disease and late-onset Alzheimer&#x27;s.

===Controversy===
DTC genetic testing has been controversial due to outspoken opposition within the medical community. Critics of DTC genetic testing argue against the risks involved in several steps of the testing process, such as the unregulated advertising and marketing claims, the potential reselling of genetic data to third parties, and the overall lack of governmental oversight.

DTC genetic testing involves many of the same risks associated with any genetic test. One of the more obvious and dangerous of these is the possibility of misreading of test results. Without professional guidance, consumers can potentially misinterpret genetic information, causing them to be deluded about their personal health.

Some advertising for DTC genetic testing has been criticized as conveying an exaggerated and inaccurate message about the connection between genetic information and disease risk, utilizing emotions as a selling factor. An advertisement for a BRCA-predictive genetic test for breast cancer stated: &quot;There is no stronger antidote for fear than information.&quot; Apart from rare diseases that are directly caused by specific, single-gene mutation, diseases &quot;have complicated, multiple genetic links that interact strongly with personal environment, lifestyle, and behavior.&quot;

Ancestry.com, a company providing DTC DNA tests for genealogy purposes, has reportedly allowed the warrantless search of their database by police investigating a murder. The warrantless search led to a search warrant to force the gathering of a DNA sample from a New Orleans filmmaker; however he turned out not to be a match for the suspected killer.

==Governmental genetic testing==
===In Estonia===
As part of its healthcare system, Estonia is offering all of its residents genome-wide genotyping. This will be translated into personalized reports for use in everyday medical practice via the national e-health portal.

The aim is to minimise health problems by warning participants most at risk of conditions such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. It is also hoped that participants who are given early warnings will adopt healthier lifestyles or take preventative drugs.

== The Genographic Project ==

In 2005, National Geographic launched the &quot;Genographic Project&quot;, which was a fifteen-year project that was discontinued in 2020. Over one million people participated in the DNA sampling from more than 140 countries, which made the project the largest of its kind ever conducted. The project asked for DNA samples from indigenous people as well as the general public, which spurred political controversy among some indigenous groups, leading to the coining of the term &quot;biocolonialism&quot;.

==Government regulation==
===In the United States===
With regard to genetic testing and information in general, legislation in the United States called the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act prohibits group health plans and health insurers from denying coverage to a healthy person or charging that person higher premiums based solely on a genetic predisposition to developing a disease in the future. The legislation also bars employers from using genetic information when making hiring, firing, job placement, or promotion decisions.
Although GINA protects against genetic discrimination, Section 210 of the law states that once the disease has manifested, employers can use the medical information and not be in violation of the law, even if the condition has a genetic basis. The legislation, the first of its kind in the United States, was passed by the United States Senate on April 24, 2008, on a vote of 95–0, and was signed into law by President George W. Bush on May 21, 2008. It went into effect on November 21, 2009.

In June 2013 the US Supreme Court issued two rulings on human genetics. The Court struck down patents on human genes, opening up competition in the field of genetic testing. The Supreme Court also ruled that police were allowed to collect DNA from people arrested for serious offenses.

===In the European Union===
Effective as of 25 May 2018, companies that process genetic data must abide by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The GDPR is a set of rules/regulations that helps an individual take control of their data that is collected, used, and stored digitally or in a structured filing system on paper, and restricts a company&#x27;s use of personal data. The regulation also applies to companies that offer products/services outside the EU.

=== In Germany ===
Genetic testing in Germany is governed by the Genetic Diagnostics Act (GenDG), which mandates that health-related genetic tests can only be carried out under medical supervision to ensure the proper interpretation of results and informed decision-making. The law emphasizes genetic counseling and informed consent, protecting individuals from potential misuse or misunderstanding of their genetic data. 

=== In France ===
The legal status of genetic testing in France is regulated under strict privacy and data protection laws, including the Bioethics Law. Direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic tests, especially those for health-related purposes, are prohibited unless conducted with medical oversight to ensure informed consent and appropriate counseling. This is due to concerns about the potential misuse of genetic data and privacy violations. While health-related genetic testing is allowed within a medical context, tests for non-medical purposes, such as ancestry or personal traits, also face legal restrictions, particularly regarding consumer access. 

===In Russia===

Russian law provides that the processing of special categories of personal data relating to race, nationality, political views, religious or philosophical beliefs, health status, intimate life is allowed if it is necessary in connection with the implementation of international agreements of the Russian Federation on readmission and is carried out in accordance with the legislation of the Russian Federation on citizenship of the Russian Federation. Information characterizing the physiological and biological characteristics of a person, on the basis of which it is possible to establish his identity (biometric personal data), can be processed without the consent of the subject of personal data in connection with the implementation of international agreements of the Russian Federation on readmission, administration of justice and execution of judicial acts, compulsory state fingerprinting registration, as well as in cases stipulated by the legislation of the Russian Federation on defense, security, anti-terrorism, transport security, anti-corruption, operational investigative activities, public service, as well as in cases stipulated by the criminal-executive legislation of Russia, the legislation of Russia on the procedure for leaving the Russian Federation and entering the Russian Federation, citizenship of the Russian Federation and notaries.

Within the framework of this program, it is also planned to include the peoples of neighboring countries, which are the main source of migration, into the genogeographic study on the basis of existing collections.

=== In UAE ===
By the end of 2021, the UAE Genome Project will be in full swing, as part of the National Innovation Strategy, establishing strategic partnerships with top medical research centers, and making sustainable investments in healthcare services. The project aims to prevent genetic diseases through the use of genetic sciences and innovative modern techniques related to profiling and genetic sequencing, in order to identify the genetic footprint and prevent the most prevalent diseases in the country, such as obesity, diabetes, hypertension, cancer, and asthma. It aims to achieve personalized treatment for each patient based on genetic factors. Additionally, a study by Khalifa University has identified, for the first time, four genetic markers associated with type 2 diabetes among UAE citizens.

===In Israel===
The Israeli Knesset passed the Genetic Information Law in 2000, becoming one of the first countries to establish a regulatory framework for the conducting of genetic testing and genetic counseling and for the handling and use identified genetic information. Under the law, genetic tests must be done in labs accredited by the Ministry of Health; however, genetic tests may be conducted outside Israel. The law also forbids discrimination for employment or insurance purposes based on genetic test results. Finally, the law takes a strict approach to genetic testing on minors, which is permitted only for the purpose of finding a genetic match with someone ill for the sake of medical treatment, or to see whether the minor carries a gene related to an illness that can be prevented or postponed.

Under the Genetic Information Law as of 2019, commercial DNA tests are not permitted to be sold directly to the public, but can be obtained with a court order, due to data privacy, reliability, and misinterpretation concerns.

==Children and religion==

Three to five percent of the funding available for the Human Genome Project was set aside to study the many social, ethical, and legal implications that will result from the better understanding of human heredity the rapid expansion of genetic risk assessment by genetic testing which would be facilitated by this project.

===Pediatric genetic testing===
The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) have provided new guidelines for the ethical issue of pediatric genetic testing and screening of children in the United States. Their guidelines state that performing pediatric genetic testing should be in the best interest of the child. AAP and ACMG recommend holding off on genetic testing for late-onset conditions until adulthood, unless diagnosing genetic disorders during childhood can reduce morbidity or mortality (e.g., to start early intervention). Testing asymptomatic children who are at risk of childhood onset conditions can also be warranted.
Both AAP and ACMG discourage the use of direct-to-consumer and home kit genetic tests because of concerns regarding the accuracy, interpretation and oversight of test content.
Guidelines also state that parents or guardians should be encouraged to inform their child of the results from the genetic test if the minor is of appropriate age. For ethical and legal reasons, health care providers should be cautious in providing minors with predictive genetic testing without the involvement of parents or guardians. Within the guidelines set by AAP and ACMG, health care providers have an obligation to inform parents or guardians on the implication of test results.
AAP and ACMG state that any type of predictive genetic testing should be offered with genetic counseling by clinical genetics, genetic counselors or health care providers.

===Israel===

In Israel, DNA testing is used to determine if people are eligible for immigration. The policy where &quot;many Jews from the former Soviet Union (FSU) are asked to provide DNA confirmation of their Jewish heritage in the form of paternity tests in order to immigrate as Jews and become citizens under Israel&#x27;s Law of Return&quot; has generated controversy.

==Costs and time==

From the date that a sample is taken, results may take weeks to months, depending upon the complexity and extent of the tests being performed. Results for prenatal testing are usually available more quickly because time is an important consideration in making decisions about a pregnancy. Prior to the testing, the doctor or genetic counselor who is requesting a particular test can provide specific information about the cost and time frame associated with that test.

<text>Archibald &quot;Archie&quot; Bunker is a fictional character from the 1970s American television sitcom &quot;All in the Family&quot; and its spin-off &quot;Archie Bunker&#x27;s Place&quot;, played by Carroll O&#x27;Connor. Bunker, a main character of the series, is a World War II veteran, blue-collar worker, and family man. &quot;All in the Family&quot; premiered on January 12, 1971, where he was depicted as the head of the Bunker family. In 1979, the show was retooled and renamed &quot;Archie Bunker&#x27;s Place&quot;; it finally went off the air in 1983. Bunker lived at the fictional address of 704 Hauser Street in the Astoria neighborhood of Queens in New York City.

&quot;All in the Family&quot; got many of its laughs by playing on Archie&#x27;s bigotry, although the dynamic tension between Archie and his left-wing son-in-law, Mike, provided an ongoing political and social sounding board for a variety of topics. Archie appears in all but seven episodes of the series. Three fifth-season episodes were missed because of a contract dispute between O&#x27;Connor and series creator Norman Lear.

Archie was modeled after Norman Lear&#x27;s father Herman Lear and on Alf Garnett from the BBC1 sitcom &quot;Till Death Us Do Part&quot;, on which &quot;All in the Family&quot; was based. In 1999, &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked Archie Bunker number5 on its 50 Greatest TV Characters of All Time list. In 2005, Archie Bunker was listed as number1 on Bravo&#x27;s 100 Greatest TV Characters, defeating runners-up such as Ralph Kramden, Lucy Ricardo, Fonzie, and Homer Simpson. Archie&#x27;s chair is in the permanent collection of the National Museum of American History.

==Character traits==

Archie has a gruff, overbearing demeanor, largely defined by his bigotry toward a diverse group of individuals: blacks, Hispanics, &quot;Commies&quot;, Freemasons, gays, women, hippies, Jews, Asians, Catholics, &quot;women&#x27;s libbers&quot;, and Polish–Americans are frequent targets of his barbs. He refers to his son-in-law Michael as &quot;Meathead&quot; and a &quot;dumb Polack&quot; and to blacks as &quot;colored” (a politically correct term during the time of his upbringing, but one that was becoming increasingly outdated and offensive during the show&#x27;s airing); in earlier episodes, it is noted that he previously called blacks &quot;coons&quot; prior to Gloria&#x27;s marriage to Michael. As the show progresses, it becomes evident that Archie&#x27;s prejudice is not motivated by malice but is rather a combination of the era and environment in which he was raised and a generalized misanthropy. Archie himself is depicted as a striving, loving father, and basically decent man; nevertheless, he is ill-tempered and frequently tells his long-suffering wife Edith to stifle herself. Series creator Norman Lear admitted this is how his father treated Lear&#x27;s mother.

Archie &quot;turned the angry white male into a cultural icon&quot;, according to CBS News. After the end of the second season taping, O&#x27;Connor said, paraphrasing James Baldwin, &quot;The American white man is trapped by his own cultural history. He doesn&#x27;t know what to do about it.&quot; O&#x27;Connor goes on to say:

Archie&#x27;s dilemma is coping with a world that is changing in front of him. He doesn&#x27;t know what to do, except to lose his temper, mouth his poisons, look elsewhere to fix the blame for his own discomfort. He isn&#x27;t a totally evil man. He&#x27;s shrewd. But he won&#x27;t get to the root of his problem, because the root of his problem is himself, and he doesn&#x27;t know it. That is the dilemma of Archie Bunker.

As the series progressed, Archie mellowed somewhat, albeit often out of necessity. In one episode, he expresses revulsion for a Ku Klux Klan-like organization which he accidentally joins. On another occasion, when asked to speak at the funeral of his friend Stretch Cunningham (James Cromwell), Archie—surprised to learn that his friend was Jewish—overcomes his initial discomfort and delivers a moving eulogy, wearing a yarmulke, and closing with a heartfelt &quot;shalom&quot;. In 1978, the character became the guardian of Edith&#x27;s stepcousin Floyd&#x27;s nine-year-old daughter, Stephanie (Danielle Brisebois) and came to accept her Jewish faith, even buying her a Star of David pendant.

Archie was also known for his frequent malapropisms and spoonerisms. For example, he refers to Edith&#x27;s gynecologist as a &quot;groinacologist&quot; and to Catholic priests who go around sprinkling &quot;incest&quot; (incense) on their congregation, whereas he referred to incest itself as &quot;committing &#x27;insects&#x27; in the family&quot;. Archie repeatedly called President Richard M. Nixon &quot;Richard E. Nixon&quot;. By the show&#x27;s second season, these had become dubbed &quot;Bunkerisms&quot;, &quot;Archie Bunkerisms&quot;, or simply &quot;Archie-isms&quot;.

O&#x27;Connor was Irish Catholic, and Norman Lear modeled the character on his Jewish father, but Bunker&#x27;s own ethnicity is never explicitly stated, other than identifying him as a WASP; over the course of the series, he mocks or belittles not just most minorities (including blacks, Hispanics, Latinos, and Asians), but also most white ethnic groups as well.

Archie, a Christian belonging to the Episcopal Church, often misquotes the Bible. He takes pride in being religious, although he rarely attends church services and constantly mispronounces the name of his minister, Reverend Felcher, as &quot;Reverend Fletcher&quot;. (When Edith inevitably corrects him, he dismisses the error with &quot;Whatever&quot;.)

He is a compulsive gambler, who, in earlier years, frequently lost his entire weekly paycheck in poker games, as related by Edith in the Season4 episode &quot;Archie the Gambler&quot;; he quit only when Edith threatened to leave him, taking then three-year old Gloria with her.

==Character biography==

When first introduced on &quot;All in the Family&quot; in 1971, Archie is the head of a family consisting of his wife Edith (Jean Stapleton), his adult daughter Gloria (Sally Struthers) and his liberal son-in-law, college student Michael &quot;Mike&quot; Stivic (Rob Reiner), with whom Archie disagrees on virtually everything; Archie frequently characterizes Mike as a &quot;dumb Polack&quot; and usually addresses him as &quot;Meathead&quot; because, in Archie&#x27;s words, he is &quot;dead from the neck up&quot;. During the show&#x27;s first five seasons, Mike and Gloria live with Archie and Edith so Mike can put himself through college. Upon Mike&#x27;s graduation, he and Gloria move into their own home next door, allowing Archie and Mike to interact nearly as much as they had when they were living in the same house.

Archie was born in Queens on May 18, 1924, to parents David and Sarah. He is a Taurus. Information on his siblings is inconsistent, because three of them are mentioned and Archie is seen talking on the phone to his younger brother Fred in &quot;Cousin Oscar&quot; (as well as Fred&#x27;s daughter Debbie Marie) but during season 6episode &quot;Archie Finds a Friend&quot;, he states that he is an only child. Two later episodes (one during season8 and another during season 9) feature Fred (played by Richard McKenzie) and it is now suggested that Fred is Archie&#x27;s only sibling. Another of Fred&#x27;s daughters, Linda, visited Archie during the third season (she briefly dated the Bunkers&#x27; neighbor Lionel in &quot;Lionel Steps Out&quot;). Archie&#x27;s father David is said to be an only child while his mother Sarah has one brother named Roy Longstreet whom Archie liked more than his own parents.

Two of Archie&#x27;s cousins are depicted: Oscar, who dies off-camera in the Bunker house during a visit and cousin Bertha (played by Peggy Rea, who appears in the same episode), apparently a somewhat distant cousin, because Archie does not recognize her.

Archie celebrates his 50th birthday in a 1974 episode and the character is last seen on the final episode of &quot;Archie Bunker&#x27;s Place&quot;, titled &quot;I&#x27;m Torn Here&quot;, on April 4, 1983. In season 5, during a three-episode stretch where Archie&#x27;s whereabouts are unknown, it is revealed that he attended Flushing High School and lettered in baseball. He tried out for the New York Giants but could not turn professional because he was drafted to serve in World War II. Likewise, he never took advantage of the G.I. Bill in order to finish his high school education (although years later he took a night school course to get a high school diploma). After World War II ended, he got a job on a New York City loading dock through his uncle&#x27;s influence; by 1974 he had risen up to dock foreman. To supplement his income, he also works as a part-time taxi driver at night.

While locked in the storeroom of Archie&#x27;s bar (Archie&#x27;s Place) with Mike in the season8 &quot;All in the Family&quot; episode &quot;Two&#x27;s a Crowd&quot;, a drunk Archie confides that as a child, his family was desperately poor and he was teased in school because he wore a shoe on one foot and a boot on the other, so kids nicknamed him &quot;Shoe-booty&quot;. In the same episode, Mike learns that Archie was mentally and physically abused by his father, who was also the source of his bigoted views. Yet, Archie then goes on to vehemently defend his father, who he claims loved him and taught him &quot;to do good&quot;. It is revealed that Archie&#x27;s father was a brakeman for the Long Island Rail Road, when Archie receives his father&#x27;s pocket watch from his formerly long-estranged brother, Alfred (&quot;Fred&quot;), who later appeared in two &quot;All in the Family&quot; episodes, &quot;Archie&#x27;s Brother&quot; and &quot;The Return of Archie&#x27;s Brother&quot;, and the &quot;Archie Bunker&#x27;s Place&quot; episode &quot;Father Christmas&quot;.

When Fred visits Archie in the &quot;Archie&#x27;s Brother&quot; episode, it is revealed that they had not seen each other in the 29 years since Archie and Edith&#x27;s wedding, although they apparently had communicated over the years via phone (two early episodes, &quot;Cousin Oscar&quot; and &quot;Lionel Steps Out&quot;, depict phone conversations between Archie and Fred). Their long estrangement was fueled by the fact that Fred refused to attend their father&#x27;s funeral, with Fred even describing him as &quot;nuts about everything.&quot; In &quot;The Return of Archie&#x27;s Brother,&quot; the two seem to have reconciled, with Fred offering to invest $5,000 to put Archie&#x27;s bar in a national syndicate. However, in Fred&#x27;s return trip to visit Archie and Edith, he arrives with a beautiful 18-year-old wife named Katherine. This leads to a heated discussion, which erupts into an argument between Archie and Fred over &quot;May–September romances&quot;, with Archie even asking if the &quot;truant officer&quot; married them and places another strain on the relationship between Archie and Fred, who storms angrily out of the Bunker home with his teen bride after Archie vehemently snubs his brother&#x27;s offer to go into business with him. Archie and Fred apparently are estranged for the next three-plus years. Putting a further strain on the relationship was the 1981 arrival of Fred&#x27;s 18-year-old daughter, Barbara (&quot;Billie&quot;) Denise Miller, who is also upset over her father&#x27;s marriage to someone not even three years older than she is (although in &quot;Archie Bunker&#x27;s Place&quot;, Billie begins dating someone 15 years her senior). Fred visits again for Christmas in 1982, finally revealing to everyone why he left his first wife and found love with Katherine.

Archie is a World War II veteran who had been based in Foggia, Italy, for 22 months. During a doctor&#x27;s appointment, it is stated that Archie had an undistinguished military record for his non-combat ground role in the motor pool of the Air Corps, later called the Army Air Forces, which at the time was a branch of the United States Army. He received a Good Conduct Medal and, in the &quot;All in the Family&quot; episode &quot;Archie&#x27;s Civil Rights&quot;, it is disclosed he also received a Purple Heart for being hit in his buttocks by shrapnel.

Archie married Edith Bunker 22 years before season 1. Later recollections of their mid-1940s courtship do not result in a consistent timeline. In the flashback episode showing Mike and Gloria&#x27;s wedding, Archie tells Mike his courtship of Edith lasted two years and hints that their relationship was not consummated until a month after their wedding night. Edith elsewhere recollects that Archie fell asleep on their wedding night and reveals that their sex life has not been very active in recent years. On another occasion, Edith discusses Archie&#x27;s history of gambling addiction, which caused problems in the early years of their marriage. Archie also reveals that when Edith was in labor with Gloria, he took her to Bayside Hospital on the Q5 bus because &quot;the subway don&#x27;t run to Bayside&quot;.

According to Edith, Archie&#x27;s resentment of Mike stems primarily from Mike&#x27;s attending college while Archie had been forced to drop out of high school, to help support his family during the Great Depression. Archie does not take advantage of the G.I. Bill, although he does attend night school to earn his diploma in 1973. Archie is also revealed to have been an outstanding baseball player in his youth. His dream was to pitch for the New York Yankees but he had to leave high school to enter the workforce to financially support his family. His uncle got him a job on a loading dock after World War II, and by the 1970s he was a foreman.

Although he is a Protestant, Archie seldom attends church, despite professing strong Christian views. The original pilot mentions that in the 22 years Archie and Edith were married, Archie had attended church only seven times (including their wedding day) and that Archie had walked out of the sermon the most recent time, disgusted with the preacher&#x27;s message (which he perceived as leftist). Archie&#x27;s religiosity often translates into &quot;knee-jerk&quot; opposition to atheism or agnosticism (which Mike and Gloria variously espouse), Catholicism, and Judaism; by the time of &quot;Archie Bunker&#x27;s Place&quot;, Archie&#x27;s antisemitism has mostly disappeared in part due to being increasingly associated with Jews such as his adopted daughter Stephanie and business partner Murray Klein.

Archie is a Republican and an outspoken supporter of Richard Nixon, as well as an early supporter of Ronald Reagan in 1976; he correctly predicts Reagan&#x27;s election in 1980. During the Vietnam War, Archie dismisses peace protesters as unpatriotic and has little good to say about the civil rights movement. Despite having an adversarial relationship with his black neighbors, the Jeffersons, he forms an unlikely friendship with their son Lionel, who performs various odd jobs for the Bunkers and responds to Archie&#x27;s patronizing racial views with sarcastic quips that usually go over Archie&#x27;s head.

The later spinoff series &quot;704 Hauser&quot; features a new, black family moving into Bunker&#x27;s old home. The series is set in 1994 but does not indicate whether Bunker, who would have been 70 by this time, is still alive. His now-adult grandson, Joey Stivic, appears briefly in the first episode of the series and references his grandfather, but does not state whether he&#x27;s still alive at this point.

==Viewer reactions==

Such was the name recognition and societal influence of the Bunker character that by 1972, political commentators were discussing the &quot;Archie Bunker vote&quot; (i.e., the voting bloc comprising urban, white, working-class men) in that year&#x27;s presidential election. In the same year, there was a parody election campaign, complete with T-shirts, campaign buttons, and bumper stickers, advocating &quot;Archie Bunker for President&quot;. In May 1973, RCA Records&#x27; trade advertisement for Archie and Edith&#x27;s debut single, a recording of &quot;Oh, Babe, What Would You Say?&quot;, carried the tagline &quot;John and Yoko, move over&quot;, referring to the artist-activists John Lennon and Yoko Ono.

The character&#x27;s imprint on American culture is such that Archie Bunker&#x27;s name was still being used in the media to describe a certain group of voters who voted in the 2008 United States presidential election.

Bunker&#x27;s perceived racist and misogynistic views were allegedly the template for the creation of Eric Cartman, one of the characters in the adult animated sitcom &quot;South Park&quot;; however, it has been acknowledged that &quot;South Park&quot; greatly served as a bond between Lear and his son Benjamin, and that Benjamin, who was born in 1988, was also not very familiar with his dad&#x27;s work from the 1970s.

<text>The English word militant is both an adjective and a noun, and it is generally used to mean vigorously active, combative and/or aggressive, especially in support of a cause, as in &quot;militant reformers&quot;. It comes from the 15th century Latin &quot;militare&quot; meaning &quot;to serve as a soldier&quot;. The related modern concept of the militia as a defensive organization against invaders grew out of the Anglo-Saxon fyrd. In times of crisis, the militiaman left his civilian duties and became a soldier until the emergency was over, when he returned to his civilian occupation.

The current meaning of &quot;militant&quot; does not usually refer to a registered soldier: it can be anyone who subscribes to the idea of using vigorous, sometimes extreme, activity to achieve an objective, usually political. A &quot;militant [political] activist&quot; would be expected to be more confrontational and aggressive than an activist not described as militant.

Militance may or may not include physical violence, armed combat, terrorism, and the like. The Trotskyist Militant group in the United Kingdom published a newspaper, was active in labour disputes, moved resolutions in political meetings, but was not based on violence. The purpose of the Christian Church Militant is to struggle against sin, the devil and &quot;. . . the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places&quot; (Ephesians 6:12), but it is not a violent movement.

==As adjective==
Militant can mean &quot;vigorously active and aggressive, especially in support of a cause&quot; as in &#x27;militant reformers&#x27;. The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, defines &quot;militant&quot; as &quot;Having a combative character; aggressive, especially in the service of a cause&quot;. The Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines &quot;militant&quot; as &quot;aggressively active (as in a cause)&quot;. It says that the word &quot;militant&quot; might typically be used in phrases such as &#x27;militant conservationists&#x27; or &#x27;a militant attitude&#x27;.

An example of the adjective usages is demonstrated when &quot;The New York Times&quot; ran an article titled &quot;Militant Environmentalists Planning Summer Protests to Save Redwoods&quot; describing a group that believes in &quot;confrontational demonstrations&quot; and &quot;nonviolent tactics&quot; to get across their message of preserving the environment. Another usage example includes &#x27;a militant political activist&#x27;, drawing attention to behaviours typical of those engaged in intensive political activism. The political protests headed by Reverend Al Sharpton have been described as militant in nature in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;.

In general usage, a &quot;militant&quot; person is a &quot;confrontational&quot; person who does not necessarily use violence.

&quot;Militant&quot; is often used within some religious circles to denote the continuous battle of Christians (as church members) or the Christian Church in their struggle against sin. In particular, the Roman Catholic Church differentiates between Church militant and church triumphant. Ellen G. White, one of the founders of the Seventh-day Adventist church, says &quot;Now the church is militant. Now we are confronted with a world in darkness, almost wholly given over to idolatry.&quot;

Such religious meaning must not be confused with the word &#x27;belligerent&#x27; used to describe extremist religious behaviours found in some who, based on their extreme religious beliefs or ideologies, take up weapons and become involved in warfare, or who commit acts of violence or terrorism in an attempt to advance their extremist religious agendas. Such extremist groups can be Christian, Muslims, Jewish, or of any other religious affiliation.

==As noun==
A &quot;militant&quot;, as a noun, is a person who uses militant methods in pursuit of an objective; the term is not associated with the military. &quot;Militant&quot; can refer to an individual displaying aggressive behavior or attitudes.

&quot;Militant&quot; is sometimes used as a euphemism for &quot;terrorist&quot; or &quot;armed insurgent&quot;. (For more on this, see mass media usage below.)

The word &quot;militant&quot; is sometimes used to describe groups that do not name or describe themselves as militants, but that advocate extreme violence. In the early 21st century, members of groups involved in Islamic terrorism such as Al-Qaeda and ISIS are usually described as militants.

==Mass media usage==
Newspapers, magazines, and other information sources may deem &quot;militant&quot; and &quot;guerrilla&quot; as neutral terms, whereas &quot;terrorist&quot; conventionally indicates disapproval of the behavior of the individual or organization so labeled, regardless of the motivations for such behavior, and freedom fighter indicates approval. &quot;Militant&quot;, at other times, can refer to anyone not a member of formal armed forces engaging in warfare or serving as a combatant.

The mass media sometimes uses the term &quot;militant&quot; in the context of terrorism. Journalists sometimes apply the term &quot;militant&quot; to paramilitary movements using terrorism as a tactic. The mass media also has used the term &quot;militant groups&quot; or &quot;radical militants&quot; for terrorist organizations.

===Legal inferences===
Those resisting a foreign military occupation can be seen as not meriting the label &quot;terrorists&quot; because their acts of political violence against military targets of a foreign occupier do not violate international law. Protocol 1 of the Geneva Conventions gives lawful combatant status to those engaging in armed conflicts against alien (or foreign) occupation, colonial domination and racist régimes. Non-uniformed guerrillas also gain combatant status if they carry arms openly during military operations. Protocol 1 does not legitimize attacks on civilians by militants who fall into these categories.

In the UN General Assembly Resolution on terrorism (42/159, 7 December 1987). which condemns international terrorism and outlines measures to combat the crime, with one proviso: &quot;that nothing in the present resolution could in any way prejudice the right to self-determination, freedom and independence, as derived from the Charter of the United Nations, of peoples forcibly deprived of that right [...], particularly peoples under colonial and racist regimes and foreign occupation or other forms of colonial domination, nor...the right of these peoples to struggle to this end and to seek and receive support [in accordance with the Charter and other principles of international law].&quot;

==Span of militancy==
Militants occur across the political spectrum, including racial or religious supremacists, separatists, abortion opponents and proponents, and environmentalists. Examples of left-wing, right-wing, and advocacy group militants include militant reformers, militant feminists, militant animal rights advocates, and militant anarchists. The phrase &quot;militant Islam&quot; can suggest violent and aggressive political activity by Islamic individuals, groups, movements, or governments. There are also various secret societies that are classified as militant groups.

Using the president&#x27;s authority to assassinate people worldwide who pose an &quot;imminent threat&quot; if &quot;capture is not feasible&quot;, the Obama administration routinely called every victim of extrajudicial killing a militant.

==Organizations==
Among organisations that describe themselves as militants, the Ulster Young Militants are an example of a group resorting to violence (intimidation, arson, and murder) as a deliberate tactic.

==Militant research==
Militant research is defined as a type of research that is distinct from academia while also not synonymous with the political militant. It refuses the alienating practices of academia which separate researchers from the political meaning of their activity. In recent years it has become an increasingly popular approach for doing research especially since it attempts to resolve academic concerns related to representation and auto-critique.

<doc id="310796" wikidata="Q2171311" url="?curid=310796" title="Flumpet">
<text>The Flumpet is a hybrid brass instrument that shares the construction and timbral qualities of a trumpet and flugelhorn. The Flumpet was invented for Art Farmer by David Monette and is currently in production by Monette. The Flumpet is in the key of B♭.

==Design==

The Flumpet was designed in 1989 and borrows the three piston valve design of both the trumpet and flugelhorn and shares the same instrument length of a trumpet. The curves on the end of the Flumpet have a resemblance to shepherd&#x27;s crooks. The mouthpiece is deeply conical which tapers slightly, as opposed to the trumpet mouthpiece which has an extreme taper to create a bowl shape. The sound of the Flumpet is described as thicker and richer than a flugelhorn and more mellow and rounded than that of a trumpet. During its creation, metal-worker David Monette wanted to produce an instrument that broke design barriers but ultimately maintained its usefulness.

The Flumpet has been described as &quot;capable of both warmth and sharp attack&quot;, taking advantage of the softer sound produced by the flugelhorn, advantageous in smaller and more intimate venues, whilst still being capable of producing the more familiar harder tones of a trumpet. The tone has been described as having &quot;characteristics of a flugelhorn, but not nearly as brittle. It has the response of a cornet, but again the sound quality is broader and more resonant.&quot;

==Notable players==

* Art Farmer
* Charles Schlueter
* Scotty Barnhart
* Vince Jones

==Recordings and performances==

Made popular by Art Farmer, the Flumpet can be heard on several of his recordings from the 1990s, including &quot;Soul Eyes&quot;, &quot;The Company I Keep&quot;, &quot;The Meaning of Art&quot;, and &quot;Silk Road&quot;. Farmer also used the instrument for 1994 live performances of Haydn&#x27;s trumpet concerto with the Austrian-Hungarian Haydn Philharmonic Orchestra.

At a 1997 performance by Boston Symphony Orchestra, Charles Schlueter played the Flumpet in place of the post-horn solo of Mahler&#x27;s Symphony No. 3.

Film composer and musician Mark Isham played Flumpet on the soundtrack for the 1997 film &quot;Afterglow&quot;.

<doc id="310798" wikidata="Q534842" url="?curid=310798" title="Hank Mobley">
<text>Henry Mobley (July 7, 1930 – May 30, 1986) was an American tenor saxophonist and composer. Mobley was described by Leonard Feather as the &quot;middleweight champion of the tenor saxophone&quot;, a metaphor used to describe his tone, that was neither as aggressive as John Coltrane nor as mellow as Lester Young, and his style that was laid-back, subtle and melodic, especially in contrast with players such as Coltrane and Sonny Rollins. The critic Stacia Proefrock claimed him &quot;one of the most underrated musicians of the bop era.&quot; Mobley&#x27;s compositions include &quot;Double Exposure&quot;, &quot;Soul Station&quot;, and &quot;Dig Dis&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Mobley was born in Eastman, Georgia, but was raised in Elizabeth, New Jersey, near Newark. He described himself as coming from a musical family and spoke of his uncle playing in a jazz band. As a child, Mobley played piano.

When he was 16, an illness kept him in the house for several months. In response, his grandmother bought him a saxophone to help him occupy his time. He tried to enter a music school in Newark but wasn’t accepted since he wasn’t a resident, so he taught himself theory and harmony from books that his grandmother bought for him, while also teaching himself to play the tenor saxophone.

==Career==
===1949–1956: Early career and Jazz Messengers years===
At 19, he started to play with local bands and, months later, worked for the first time with such musicians as Dizzy Gillespie and Max Roach. Roach introduced Mobley to the New York jazz scene in 1951, and over the next two years the latter began composing and recording tunes of his own. He played with multiple R&amp;B bands during this period, and played for two weeks in 1953 with the Duke Ellington Orchestra when saxophonist Jimmy Hamilton was recovering from dental work. When Charlie Parker heard Mobley&#x27;s playing, he advised the young musician to take more influence from blues music.

In April 1953, he was hired by Max Roach to play on the album released as &quot;The Max Roach Quartet featuring Hank Mobley&quot;. He later appeared on two Roach sessions recorded in 1957 and 1958 for EmArcy records.

Shortly after working with Roach, he began working regularly with another drummer and bandleader, Art Blakey. He and Blakey took part in one of the earliest hard bop sessions, alongside pianist Horace Silver, bassist Doug Watkins and trumpeter Kenny Dorham. The results of these sessions were released as &quot;Horace Silver and the Jazz Messengers&quot;. At this point, the band was a collective, sometimes appearing and recording under the names of either Silver or Blakey. Mobley was also in The Jazz Messengers for the recording of the live album &quot;At the Cafe Bohemia&quot;, and he appeared on the Columbia Records studio album &quot;The Jazz Messengers&quot;. Mobley used the Jazz Messengers&#x27; rhythm section as his backing band for his 1955 Blue Note Records debut, &quot;Hank Mobley Quartet&quot;. When the Silver/Watkins/Blakey version of The Jazz Messengers split up in 1956, Mobley continued working with Silver for a short time, appearing on &quot;Silver&#x27;s Blue&quot;, &quot;6 Pieces of Silver&quot;, and &quot;The Stylings of Silver&quot;. Mobley worked for brief periods with Blakey a few years later, rejoining the drummer&#x27;s band (which was called Art Blakey and The Jazz Messengers, and was no longer a collective) in the spring and summer of 1959. He also hired Blakey to play on two of his Blue Note solo albums recorded in 1960.

===1956–1970: Blue Note years===
Mobley recorded steadily during the second half of the 1950s for Blue Note records, a series of albums which featured him with Lee Morgan, Donald Byrd, Art Farmer, Kenny Dorham, Jackie McLean, Pepper Adams, Milt Jackson, Sonny Clark, Bobby Timmons, Herbie Hancock, Wynton Kelly, Paul Chambers, and Philly Joe Jones, among others. Mobley&#x27;s former Messengers rhythm section of Silver, Watkins, and Blakey backed him on &quot;Hank Mobley and His All Stars&quot; and &quot;Hank Mobley Quintet&quot;.
In 1958, Mobley was a sideman on Max Roach&#x27;s album &quot;The Max Roach 4 Plays Charlie Parker&quot;, playing on three tracks. Dorham, saxophone player George Coleman, and bassists George Morrow and Nelson Boyd also recorded on the album, which consisted entirely of Parker compositions. In March 1959, Mobley rejoined the Jazz Messengers. With this edition of The Jazz Messengers, he recorded &quot;At the Jazz Corner of the World&quot; and the studio album first released in 2020 as &quot;Just Coolin&quot;&#x27;. During this same period, Mobley and Blakey appeared together on a Sonny Clark recording session that was first released in 1979 as &quot;My Conception&quot;. Mobley was with the Jazz Messengers during the Newport Jazz Festival that summer, but soon after left the band and was replaced by Wayne Shorter.

During the 1960s, he worked chiefly as a leader, and continued to record for Blue Note Records until 1970. Notable records from this period include &quot;Soul Station&quot; (1960), generally considered to be his finest recording, and &quot;Roll Call&quot; (1960). Both of these albums featured Blakey on drums, and they were the final recordings Mobley made with the drummer. In a 2020 review of &quot;Soul Station&quot;, The Recording Academy&#x27;s &quot;Grammy Awards&quot; website called the album Mobley&#x27;s &quot;most rewarding listen despite not breaking the mold.&quot; Grammy has also referred to the album as &quot;effortlessly elegant.&quot; &quot;The Guardian&quot; gave Mobley&#x27;s four &quot;classic&quot; albums (&quot;Peckin’ Time&quot;, &quot;Soul Station&quot;, &quot;Roll Call&quot; and &quot;Workout&quot;) five stars noting that &quot;[f]or once, the word &#x27;classic&#x27; is justified.&quot; The article referred to his &quot;infinite subtlety&quot; and ability as &quot;an ingenious composer&quot; as justification for this rating.

During this period of his career, he performed with bop and hard bop musicians including Grant Green, Freddie Hubbard, Sonny Clark, Wynton Kelly and Philly Joe Jones, and formed a particularly productive partnership with trumpeter Lee Morgan, having appeared on each other&#x27;s albums and Johnny Griffin&#x27;s &quot;A Blowin&#x27; Session&quot;. Mobley was briefly a member of the Miles Davis band in 1961, during the period when Davis was searching for a tenor saxophone player to permanently replace John Coltrane. Mobley is heard on the album &quot;Someday My Prince Will Come&quot; (on two tracks, playing alongside Coltrane), and the live recordings &quot;In Person: Live at the Blackhawk&quot; and &quot;At Carnegie Hall&quot;. &quot;JazzTimes&quot; noted that around the time he played with Davis, Mobley &quot;retooled his sound&quot; from a lighter to a harder-edged tone. 

In 1961, Mobley recorded two of his own albums, &quot;Workout&quot; and &quot;Another Workout&quot;, although &quot;Another Workout&quot; was not released until 1985. Both featured a rhythm section of Wynton Kelly, Paul Chambers, and Philly Joe Jones, all of whom were in Davis&#x27;s bands during the late 1950s. The delay of the latter album&#x27;s release was later called &quot;incomprehensible&quot; by producer Michael Cuscuna and &quot;astonishing&quot; according to Bob Blumenthal. The personnel on &quot;Workout&quot; included guitarist Grant Green, Wynton Kelly, Paul Chambers, and Philly Joe Jones, while &quot;Another Workout&quot; featured the same personnel, excluding Green. Mobley rehearsed extensively before his 1960s Blue Note recordings, typically twice during the week preceding a Saturday studio session, with Blue Note paying for the rehearsals and recordings. Alfred Lion, co-producer of the label, would frequently direct the band&#x27;s tempo or critique studio takes until he was pleased with them.

Mobley recorded &quot;No Room for Squares&quot; in 1964, featuring trumpeters Donald Byrd and Lee Morgan, with &quot;DownBeat&quot; remarking that on the album Mobley &quot;conveyed quiet authority&quot;, and followed a year later with &quot;A Caddy for Daddy&quot;. Mobley, Lee Morgan, and soul jazz pianist Harold Mabern recorded another mid-60s album, &quot;Dippin&#x27;&quot;, in one day. According to Samuel Chell, &quot;No Room for Squares&quot; was &quot;the first session on which [Mobley] would begin to sacrifice lyric inspiration and subtlety of phrasing to a harder sound and stiffer rhythmic approach.&quot;

In 1964, while serving a prison sentence for narcotics possession, Mobley wrote songs that were later recorded for the album &quot;A Slice of the Top&quot;. The album was recorded in 1966 but was not released until 1979. The popularity of Mobley&#x27;s albums decreased during the mid-1960s, though he continued to record regularly this period. Three critically acclaimed albums recorded during the mid- to late-60s include &quot;A Caddy for Daddy&quot;, &quot;Hi Voltage&quot;, and &quot;The Flip&quot;. Apart from his album &quot;Reach Out!&quot;, also recorded in the late 60s, Mobley avoided progressive jazz and the electric sound popular with jazz musicians during this period.

===1970–1986: retirement===
One of Mobley&#x27;s final albums, titled &quot;Breakthrough!&quot;, was recorded in 1972 with baritone saxophonist Charles Davis, pianist Cedar Walton, bassist Sam Jones, and drummer Billy Higgins. Scott Yanow noted that Mobley&#x27;s career was about to &quot;eclipse&quot; following this record date.

In 1973, shortly before the end of his career, he began a musical collaboration with Muhal Richard Abrams, although the two never recorded together. Following Mobley&#x27;s semi-retirement, pianist Tete Montoliu and Mobley recorded one track together on the 1980 album &quot;I Wanna Talk About You&quot;, the jazz standard &quot;Autumn Leaves&quot;.

In 1979, in an interview with John Litweiler, Mobley noted: &quot;It&#x27;s hard for me to think of what could be and what should have been.&quot;

Mobley gave a speech at the Blue Note Town Hall concert in 1985.

==Personal life==
Mobley became addicted to heroin in the late 1950s, and in 1958 was imprisoned. He continued to struggle with his drug addiction during the 1960s.

A longtime smoker, Mobley was forced to retire in the mid-1970s, due to lung problems. He also had problems with homelessness in his later years and struggled to stay in touch with his fellow musicians. He worked two engagements at the Angry Squire in New York City – November 22 and 23, 1985, and January 11, 1986 – in a quartet with Duke Jordan and guest singer Lodi Carr, a few months before his death.

He died of pneumonia in 1986, aged 55, having also suffered from lung cancer.

==Legacy==
Jazz radio host Bob Perkins described Mobley&#x27;s style as &quot;round, throaty, and distinctive&quot;, noting that despite &quot;lukewarm appraisals of his artistry by critics, Hank Mobley overcame some major stumbling blocks to acquire a place in the history of jazz music.&quot;

Mosaic Records released two multidisc compilations of Mobley&#x27;s Blue Note recordings. &quot;The Complete Blue Note Hank Mobley Fifties Sessions&quot; was released by the label in 1998, and &quot;The Complete Hank Mobley Blue Note Sessions 1963-70&quot; was released in 2019. &quot;GQ&quot; noted that seven of Mobley&#x27;s 12 Blue Note albums recorded in the 1963–70 period were quickly slated for release, with the others &quot;chopped up and mixed and matched—which denied Mobley his proper place in the music of the time and left him deeply frustrated.&quot; Mobley himself was dismayed by the record label&#x27;s tendency to pressure him into studio sessions, only to decide not to release the recorded music. For instance, Mobley&#x27;s album &quot;Poppin″&quot; was recorded in 1957 and released 23 years later.

&quot;The Spectator&quot; lamented that &quot;an unfortunate side effect of 20th century Modernism is that [listenability] doesn&#x27;t put you in the history books,&quot; referencing Mobley&#x27;s style and the lack of attention paid to his work, as compared to John Coltrane and Sonny Rollins. According to fellow saxophonist Gary Bartz, the fact his compositions were not organized with one publishing company made profiting from them difficult.

In November 2020, the Van Gelder Studio&#x27;s first livestream video was a tribute to Mobley. In 2022, saxophonist Art Themen purchased a saxophone that had previously been owned by Ronnie Scott and, before him, by Mobley. Grammy&#x27;s article &quot;Let Me Play The Answers: 8 Jazz Artists Honoring Black Geniuses&quot; cited Mobley as an influence on jazz trumpeter Bruce Harris, and Art Blakey&#x27;s contribution to &quot;Soul Station&quot; as, metaphorically, the &quot;hottest part of the flame&quot; according to former Jazz Messengers drummer Ralph Peterson, Jr.

<text>Bersirc is a discontinued open-source Internet Relay Chat client for the Microsoft Windows operating system. Linux and Mac OS X versions were &quot;in development&quot;. Bersirc uses the Claro toolkit, which aims to provide an interface to native windowing systems and widgets on all operating systems. Microsoft .NET and Qt toolkit ports were also planned. The final version of Bersirc was 2.2.14.

==Features==
Bersirc features connections to multiple servers, a finger client, DCC File Transfers and Chat, Smart Paste, Object Pascal Scripting, Internet Time Support (Swatch Netbeats), Channel Lists, Favorite Channels list, Ident Server, AutoJoin on Invite, AutoRejoin on Kick, configurable date formats, an ICQ-like notify list, advanced filtering, a configurable user interface, and a built in IRC user guide.

==License==
Bersirc was licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License and there are no plans to change this. Bersirc 2.1 was to be released under the Qt Public License, but the Qt toolkit and license were abandoned.

==History==
Bersirc was originally written in Delphi by Jamie Frater in 1999 as a Windows-only IRC client, comparable to HydraIRC and Klient. But development stagnated due to his growing responsibilities in real life.

On 10 February 2004 Nicholas Copeland bought the source code from Frater and released it as open-source. The older Delphi client, Bersirc 1.4, was supposed to be maintained under the name Bersirc 1.5. The original site was also archived by the new owner, including all the old plugins and extensions, but there has been almost no information about the future of the legacy clients since.

Developers stated that development of the 1.4 client stalled because the original source code extensively used proprietary software components. The 1.4 client relies on many parts of old versions of the Raize Components package.

The primary developer, Theo Julienne, announced plans to develop the 2.1 branch in C++ using the Qt toolkit, but with the release of the 2.2 branch this was changed to C using Claro Graphics.

==Reception==
In 2001, New Zealand gaming website GamePlanet recommended Bersirc for users to connect to its IRC services.

Bersirc has received positive reviews. The German website Winfuture referred to version 2.2.13 as a &quot;great free alternative to the popular shareware IRC client mIRC. The program contains only what is necessary for chatting on IRC...&quot;. Snapfiles gave the program 3.5/5 stars, referring to it as &quot;feature rich and nicely designed&quot;.

<doc id="310802" wikidata="Q468930" url="?curid=310802" title="Trompe-l'œil">
<text>; ; ) is an artistic term for the highly realistic optical illusion of three-dimensional space and objects on a two-dimensional surface. , which is most often associated with painting, tricks the viewer into perceiving painted objects or spaces as real. Forced perspective is a related illusion in architecture.

==History in painting==
The phrase, which can also be spelled without the hyphen and ligature in English as &quot;trompe l&#x27;oeil&quot;, originates with the artist Louis-Léopold Boilly, who used it as the title of a painting he exhibited in the Paris Salon of 1800. Although the term gained currency only in the early 19th century, the illusionistic technique associated with dates much further back. It was (and is) often employed in murals. Instances from Greek and Roman times are known, for instance in Pompeii. A typical mural might depict a window, door, or hallway, intended to suggest a larger room.

A version of an oft-told ancient Greek story concerns a contest between two renowned painters. Zeuxis (born around 464 BC) produced a still life painting so convincing that birds flew down to peck at the painted grapes. A rival, Parrhasius, asked Zeuxis to judge one of his paintings that was behind a pair of tattered curtains in his study. Parrhasius asked Zeuxis to pull back the curtains, but when Zeuxis tried, he could not, as the curtains were included in Parrhasius&#x27;s painting—making Parrhasius the winner.
==Perspective==
A fascination with perspective drawing arose during the Renaissance. But Giotto had begun using perspective at the end of the 13th century with the cycle of Assisi in Saint Francis stories. Many Italian painters of the late Quattrocento, such as Andrea Mantegna (1431–1506) and Melozzo da Forlì (1438–1494), began painting illusionistic ceiling paintings, generally in fresco, that employed perspective and techniques such as foreshortening to create the impression of greater space for the viewer below. This type of illusionism as specifically applied to ceiling paintings is known as &quot;di sotto in sù&quot;, meaning &quot;from below, upward&quot; in Italian. The elements above the viewer are rendered as if viewed from true vanishing point perspective. Well-known examples are the Camera degli Sposi in Mantua and Antonio da Correggio&#x27;s (1489–1534) &quot;Assumption of the Virgin&quot; in the Parma Cathedral.

Similarly, Vittorio Carpaccio (1460–1525) and Jacopo de&#x27; Barbari (c. 1440 – before 1516) added small trompe-l&#x27;œil features to their paintings, playfully exploring the boundary between image and reality. For example, a painted fly might appear to be sitting on the painting&#x27;s frame, or a curtain might appear to partly conceal the painting, a piece of paper might appear to be attached to a board, or a person might appear to be climbing out of the painting altogether—all in reference to the contest of Zeuxis and Parrhasius.

==Quadratura==

Perspective theories in the 17th century allowed a more fully integrated approach to architectural illusion, which when used by painters to &quot;open up&quot; the space of a wall or ceiling is known as &quot;quadratura&quot;. Examples include Pietro da Cortona&#x27;s &quot;Allegory of Divine Providence&quot; in the Palazzo Barberini and Andrea Pozzo&#x27;s &quot;Apotheosis of St Ignatius&quot; on the ceiling of the Roman church of Sant&#x27;Ignazio in Campo Marzio.

The Mannerist and Baroque style interiors of Jesuit churches in the 16th and 17th centuries often included such ceiling paintings, which optically &quot;open&quot; the ceiling or dome to the heavens with a depiction of Jesus&#x27;, Mary&#x27;s, or a saint&#x27;s ascension or assumption. An example of a perfect architectural is the illusionistic dome in the Jesuit church, Vienna, by Andrea Pozzo, which is only slightly curved, but gives the impression of true architecture.

 paintings became very popular in Flemish and later in Dutch painting in the 17th century arising from the development of still life painting. The Flemish painter Cornelis Norbertus Gysbrechts created a &quot;chantourné&quot; painting showing an easel holding a painting. &quot;Chantourné&quot; literally means &#x27;cutout&#x27; and refers to a &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; representation designed to stand away from a wall. The Dutch painter Samuel Dirksz van Hoogstraten was a master of the and theorized on the role of art as the lifelike imitation of nature in his 1678 book, the &quot;Introduction to the Academy of Painting, or the Visible World&quot; (&quot;Inleyding tot de hooge schoole der schilderkonst: anders de zichtbaere werelt&quot;, Rotterdam, 1678).

A fanciful form of architectural , quodlibet, features realistically rendered paintings of such items as paper knives, playing cards, ribbons, and scissors, apparently accidentally left lying around.

 can also be found painted on tables and other items of furniture, on which, for example, a deck of playing cards might appear to be sitting on the table. A particularly impressive example can be seen at Chatsworth House in Derbyshire, where one of the internal doors appears to have a violin and bow suspended from it, in a trompe-l&#x27;œil painted around 1723 by Jan van der Vaart. Another example can be found in the Painted Hall at the Old Royal Naval College, Greenwich, London. This Wren building was painted by Sir James Thornhill, the first British born painter to be knighted and is a classic example of the Baroque style popular in the early 18th century. The American 19th-century still-life painter William Harnett specialized in . 

In the 20th century, from the 1960s on, the American Richard Haas and many others painted large murals on the sides of city buildings. From the beginning of the 1980s when German artist Rainer Maria Latzke began to combine classical fresco art with contemporary content, became increasingly popular for interior murals. The Spanish painter Salvador Dalí utilized the technique for a number of his paintings.

==In other art forms==
, in the form of &quot;forced perspective&quot;, has long been used in stage-theater set design, so as to create the illusion of a much deeper space than the existing stage. A famous early example is the Teatro Olimpico in Vicenza, with Vincenzo Scamozzi&#x27;s seven forced-perspective &quot;streets&quot; (1585), which appear to recede into the distance.

 is employed in Donald O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s famous &quot;Running up the wall&quot; scene in the film &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot; (1952). During the finale of his &quot;Make &#x27;em Laugh&quot; number he first runs up a real wall. Then he runs towards what appears to be a hallway, but when he runs up this as well we realize that it is a large mural. More recently, Roy Andersson has made use of similar techniques in his feature films.

Matte painting is a variant of , and is used in film production with elements of a scene are painted on glass panels mounted in front of the camera.

Elsa Schiaparelli frequently made use of in her designs, most famously perhaps in her Bowknot Sweater, which some consider to be the first use of in fashion. The Tears Dress, which she did in collaboration with Salvador Dalí, features both appliqué tears on the veil and &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; tears on the dress itself.

Fictional&quot; trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; appears in many Looney Tunes, such as the Road Runner cartoons, where, for example, Wile E. Coyote paints a tunnel on a rock wall, and Road Runner then races through the fake tunnel. This is usually followed by the coyote&#x27;s foolishly trying to run through the tunnel after the road runner, only to smash into the hard rock-face. This sight gag was employed in &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;.

In Chicago&#x27;s Near North Side, Richard Haas used a 16-story 1929 apartment hotel converted into a 1981 apartment building for murals in homage to Chicago school architecture. One of the building&#x27;s sides features the Chicago Board of Trade Building, intended as a reflection of the building located two miles south.

Several contemporary artists use chalk on pavement or sidewalk to create works, a technique called street painting or &quot;pavement art&quot;. These creations last only until washed away, and therefore must be photographed to be preserved. Practitioners of this form include Julian Beever, Edgar Mueller, Leon Keer, and Kurt Wenner.

The Palazzo Salis of Tirano, Italy, has over centuries and throughout the palace used &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; in place of more expensive real masonry, doors, staircases, balconies, and draperies to create an illusion of sumptuousness and opulence.

&quot;Trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; in the form of illusion architecture and Lüftlmalerei is common on façades in the Alpine region.

&quot;Trompe-l&#x27;œil,&quot; in the form of &quot;illusion painting&quot;, is also used in contemporary interior design, where illusionary wall paintings experienced a renaissance since around 1980. Significant artists in this field are the German muralist Rainer Maria Latzke, who invented, in the 1990s, a new method of producing illusion paintings, frescography, and the English artist Graham Rust.

OK Go&#x27;s music video for &quot;The Writing&#x27;s on the Wall&quot; uses a number of illusions alongside other optical illusions, captured through a one-shot take. &quot;Trompe-l&#x27;œil &quot; illusions have been used as gameplay mechanics in video games such as &quot;The Witness&quot; and &quot;Superliminal&quot;.

Japanese filmmaker and animator Isao Takahata regarded achieving a sense of to be important for his work, stating that an animated world should feel as if it &quot;existed right there&quot; so that &quot;people believe in a fantasy world and characters that no one has seen in reality.&quot;

Tourist attractions employing large-scale illusory art allowing visitors to photograph themselves in fantastic scenes have opened in several Asian countries, such as the Trickeye Museum and Hong Kong 3D Museum.
Recently a Trick Art Museum opened in Europe and uses more photographic approaches.

<doc id="310808" wikidata="Q2725594" url="?curid=310808" title="Tommy Vercetti">
<text>Thomas &quot;Tommy&quot; Vercetti is a fictional character and the playable protagonist of the 2002 video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto: Vice City&quot;, the fourth main installment in Rockstar Games&#x27;s &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; series. The first protagonist in the series who can speak, Tommy was voiced by Ray Liotta.

Portrayed as a temperamental Italian-American mobster, Tommy is a made man or ex-&quot;soldato&quot; of the Forelli crime family, a fictional Italian Mafia organisation. After serving a 15-year prison sentence for murder, Tommy is released in 1986 and resumes work in Vice City, a fictional city based on Miami. However, he is soon tasked with recovering the stolen goods from an ambushed drug deal. Tommy&#x27;s quest leads him to make various criminal contacts, building up a reputation within the criminal underworld of Vice City. Tommy eventually expands his criminal empire, becoming the city&#x27;s kingpin.

Tommy was well received by critics, who found him to be more fleshed-out and likeable than previous protagonists in the series, and praised his characterization, comparing it to that of Tony Montana from the 1983 film &quot;Scarface&quot;. Liotta&#x27;s performance as Tommy was also praised and earned him multiple year-end accolades.

== Concept and design ==
Tommy Vercetti first appears wearing a teal Hawaiian shirt. He is offered more wardrobe options as the game progresses. Tommy, in several ways, exhibits characteristics of fictional drug lord Tony Montana from the 1983 film &quot;Scarface&quot;. This coincides with the heavy themes and appearance of the movie that has been implemented into &quot;Vice City&quot;. The interplay between Tommy and Lance Vance was crafted to be similar to the relationship of &quot;Miami Vice&quot;″s Sonny Crockett and Ricardo Tubbs.

The team spent time &quot;solving [the] riddle&quot; of a speaking protagonist, a notable departure from &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot;″s silent protagonist Claude. Ray Liotta portrayed protagonist Tommy Vercetti. Liotta described the role as challenging: &quot;You&#x27;re creating a character that&#x27;s not there before ... It&#x27;s so intensive&quot;. When recording the role, the team used blue screen in order to allow Liotta to visualise &quot;how it&#x27;s gonna move&quot;. The team ensured that the player felt &quot;real affinity&quot; for Tommy, making the narrative a key development interest. Dan Houser described Tommy as &quot;strong and dangerous and prepared to wait for the right opportunity to arrive&quot;. Director Navid Khonsari found Liotta occasionally difficult to work with. &quot;In some sessions he was ... into it, but then sometimes ... he was very dark and couldn&#x27;t work&quot;, said Sam Houser.

Prior to the release of &quot;Vice City&quot;, IGN stated that Tommy was likely to &quot;leave the same kind of imprint on kids today that [actor Ray Liotta&#x27;s] portrayal of Ray Sinclair left on every high school and college kid who saw &quot;Something Wild&quot; back in 1986.&quot; They also compared Liotta&#x27;s portrayal of Tommy to his portrayal of Henry Hill in &quot;Goodfellas&quot;. When asked about his portrayal of Tommy, Liotta stated that &quot;it was hard work.&quot; He said that &quot;you&#x27;re pretty much putting yourself in [the game developers&#x27;] hands and doing whatever they want so there&#x27;s not much for you to do creatively.&quot;

== Biography ==
Tommy Vercetti, born in Liberty City to an Italian American family, helped his father at a printing press as a child. Initially aspiring to an honest life, he fell into crime as a teenager through Sonny Forelli, a mafia boss who eventually made him a member of the Forelli Crime Family. In 1971, Sonny, fearing Tommy&#x27;s growing influence, set him up in a trap that led to Tommy killing 11 men in self-defense. Arrested for multiple murders, Tommy earned the nickname &quot;The Harwood Butcher&quot; and served 15 years in prison.

In 1986, freshly released, Tommy was sent to Vice City by Sonny to oversee a drug deal. The deal was ambushed, leaving Tommy to recover the lost money and drugs. During his investigation, he formed alliances with figures like Ken Rosenberg, Colonel Cortez, Kent Paul, Lance Vance, and Avery Carrington. Discovering drug lord Ricardo Diaz orchestrated the ambush, Tommy and Lance killed Diaz in his own mansion, seizing his empire.

With Diaz&#x27;s assets, Tommy established the &quot;Vercetti Gang&quot;, distancing himself from the Forellis and building a vast criminal empire. He neglected Lance, who felt sidelined while expanding his operations and forming alliances with local gangs.

When Sonny arrived in Vice City demanding payment, he revealed Lance’s betrayal and his role in Tommy’s 1971 arrest. A shootout ensued, resulting in Tommy killing both Sonny and Lance. With his rivals eliminated, Tommy cemented his position as Vice City&#x27;s undisputed kingpin.

Not much is known about Tommy&#x27;s life after 1986 other than his partnership with Ken being short-lived. At some point before 1992, when Ken&#x27;s cocaine addiction became a serious nuisance for Tommy, he sent him to a rehabilitation center in Fort Carson, San Andreas, and abandoned him there. In &quot;The Introduction&quot;, a short prologue film to &quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot;, Ken gets out of rehab after completing his treatment and tries to contact Tommy, but is unsuccessful, as the latter has cut all ties with him.

== Reception ==
The character of Tommy Vercetti received very positive reviews and remarks from critics and players of &quot;Vice City&quot;, making it to many lists of the best video game characters. &quot;AllGame&quot;″s Scott Alan Marriott found Tommy more engaging than &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot;″s Claude; &quot;IGN&quot;″s Perry felt that Rockstar &quot;found the right person and the right choice&quot;, and &quot;Edge&quot; wrote that Tommy &quot;sweats charisma&quot;, commending Liotta&#x27;s performance. &quot;CraveOnline&quot; stated that playing as Tommy was &quot;a breath of fresh air&quot;. &quot;The Age&quot; praised Liotta&#x27;s acting and stated &quot;while the character riffs on Tony Montana throughout the game, Liotta&#x27;s speeches give him a reckless sense of humour that makes him more likeable&quot;. GameDaily praised Liotta&#x27;s portrayal as having transformed him from a generic-looking thug to a &quot;tough guy who ruled the 80&#x27;s.&quot; &quot;The Telegraph&quot; described Tommy as &quot;the most amoral&quot; &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; protagonist.

Andy Kelly of &quot;TheGamer&quot; described Tommy as the &quot;Greatest GTA Protagonist&quot;, highlighting his role as the first fully developed character in the &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; series. Unlike the eight interchangeable protagonists in the earlier 2D games—whose differences were limited to superficial traits like clothing and skin tone—Tommy featured a well-defined personality. While Claude from &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot; introduced some character depth, his silence left him lacking in overall personality. Kelly credited Ray Liotta for bringing Tommy to life, though he noted that Liotta was initially unfamiliar with the franchise&#x27;s scale and faced conflicts with Rockstar during the recording process. Through comparing Tommy to other protagonists like Niko Bellic, Michael De Santa, and Carl Johnson, Kelly emphasized how Tommy&#x27;s motives and backstory make him stand out.

Liotta won the award for Best Live Action/Voice Male Performance at the 2003 G-Phoria Awards and Best Performance by a Human at the 2003 Spike Video Game Awards.

<text>Macondo () is a fictional town described in Gabriel García Márquez&#x27;s novel &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot;. It is the home town of the Buendía family.

==Aracataca==
Macondo is often supposed to draw from García Márquez&#x27;s childhood town, Aracataca, near the north (Caribbean) coast of Colombia, 80 km south of Santa Marta.

In June 2006, there was a referendum to change the name of the town from Aracataca to Macondo, which ultimately failed due to low turnout.

==Etymology==
In the first chapter of his autobiography, &quot;Living to Tell the Tale&quot;, García Márquez states that he took the name &quot;Macondo&quot; from a sign at a banana plantation near Aracataca. He also mentions the fact that &quot;Macondo&quot; is the local name of the tree &quot;Cavanillesia platanifolia&quot;, which grows in that area.

==Fictional history==
The town first appears in García Márquez&#x27;s short story &quot;Leaf Storm&quot;. It is the central location for the subsequent novel &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot;. He later used Macondo as a setting for several other stories.

In &quot;In Evil Hour&quot;, published the year before &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot;, García Márquez mentions Macondo as the town where Father Ángel was succeeded by the one-hundred-year-old Antonio Isabel del Santísimo Sacramento del Altar Castañeda y Montero, a clear reference to the novel to come.

In the narrative of &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot;, the town grows from a tiny settlement with almost no contact with the outside world, to eventually become a large and thriving place, before a banana plantation is set up. The establishment of the banana plantation leads to Macondo&#x27;s downfall, followed by a gigantic windstorm that wipes it from the map. As the town grows and falls, different generations of the Buendía family play important roles, contributing to its development.

The fall of Macondo comes first as a result of a four-year rainfall, which destroyed most of the town&#x27;s supplies and image. During the years following the rainfall, the town begins to empty, as does the Buendía home.

==In popular culture==
The town of Macondo is the namesake of the Macondo Prospect, an oil and gas prospect in the Gulf of Mexico, where the Deepwater Horizon oil spill began in April 2010. In addition to this usage, hereby other popular culture references down below:

* Macondo is the name of a growing coffee shop franchise located in South Florida featuring Colombian coffee as well as a large variety of foods, some of which have a Latin twist. There are currently seven locations with an eighth on the way, all decorated with rustic appeal consisting of pallet racks topped with coffee sacks.
* Early in the 1974 film &quot;Chinatown&quot;, Jake Gittes spies on Hollis Mulwray at the fictional &quot;El Macondo Apartments&quot;. Production director Richard Sylbert says this was indeed a reference to the fictional town created by García Márquez in &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot;.
*Russian rock band Bi-2 released as part of their 2006 album &quot;Milk&quot; (&quot;&quot;) a song called &quot;Macondo&quot; (&quot;&quot;). The chorus repeats: &quot;Rain was falling on Macondo, right in the middle of the century&quot; (&quot;&quot;). Bi-2 first obtained popularity in 2000, with the release of their first hit &quot;No One Writes to the Colonel&quot; (&quot;&quot;), the title of a novella by Gabriel García Márquez.
* Given the town&#x27;s association with magical realism, many Latin Americans would portray the everyday illogical or absurd news and situations they or their respective countries face as more aptly belonging to Macondo. As a result, some Latin Americans occasionally refer to their home towns or countries as &quot;Macondos&quot;. The Latin American McOndo phenomenon of the mid-1990s (started by the anthology of the same name), a counter-reaction to magical realism and the region&#x27;s literary Boom of the 60s and 70s, derives its name from the portmanteau of the words Macondo and McDonald&#x27;s.
* Macondo is the name of a refugee settlement in Simmering, a municipality on the outskirts of Vienna, Austria, named after Garcia Márquez&#x27;s fictitious town by Chilean refugees. It has been home to successive waves of refugees since Hungarians came en masse after the revolution of 1956, followed by Czechoslovak and Romanian waves in 1968, Vietnamese boat people and Chileans fleeing Pinochet in the early 1970s. Many of these refugees and their descendants still live in the settlement as &quot;permanent refugees,&quot; while new waves from current headlining wars from around the world keep arriving: Somalia, Afghanistan, Iraq, Chechnya, etc.
* The Marquéz Family in the indie video game &quot;Kentucky Route Zero&quot; owns a house on Macondo Lane.
* In &quot;Light Over Liskeard&quot; by Louis de Bernières, the main character&#x27;s best friend Theodore Pitt stayed close to Macondo and Aracataca before.

<doc id="310810" wikidata="Q353943" url="?curid=310810" title="John Lewis (pianist)">
<text>John Aaron Lewis (May 3, 1920 – March 29, 2001) was an American jazz pianist, composer and arranger, best known as the founder and musical director of the Modern Jazz Quartet.

== Early life==
John Lewis was born in La Grange, Illinois, and after his parents&#x27; divorce moved with his mother, a trained singer, to Albuquerque, New Mexico when he was two months old. She died from peritonitis when he was four and he was raised by his grandmother and great-grandmother. He began learning classical music and piano at the age of seven. His family was musical and had a family band that allowed him to play frequently and he also played in a Boy Scout music group. Even though he learned piano by playing the classics, he was exposed to jazz from an early age because his aunt loved to dance and he would listen to the music she played. After attending Albuquerque High School, he then studied at the University of New Mexico, where he led a small dance band that he formed and double majored in Anthropology and Music. His piano teacher at the university was Walter Keller, to whom he paid tribute on the title composition of the Modern Jazz Quartet&#x27;s 1974 album &quot;In Memoriam&quot;. Eventually, he decided not to pursue Anthropology because he was advised that careers from degrees in the subject did not pay well. In 1942, Lewis entered the Army and played piano alongside Kenny Clarke, who influenced him to move to New York once their service was over. Lewis moved to New York in 1945 to pursue his musical studies at the Manhattan School of Music and eventually graduated with a master&#x27;s degree in music in 1953. Although his move to New York turned his musical attention more towards jazz, he still frequently played and listened to classical works and composers such as Chopin, Bach and Beethoven.

==Jazz career==

Once Lewis moved to New York, Clarke introduced him to Dizzy Gillespie&#x27;s bop-style big band. He successfully auditioned by playing a song called &quot;Bright Lights&quot; that he had written for the band he and Clarke played for in the Army. The tune he originally played for Gillespie, renamed &quot;Two Bass Hit&quot;, became an instant success. Lewis composed, arranged and played piano for the band from 1946 until 1948 after the band made a concert tour of Europe. When Lewis returned from the tour with Gillespie&#x27;s band, he left it to work individually. Lewis was an accompanist for Charlie Parker and played on some of Parker&#x27;s famous recordings, such as &quot;Parker&#x27;s Mood&quot; (1948) and &quot;Blues for Alice&quot; (1951), but also collaborated with other prominent jazz artists such as Lester Young, Ella Fitzgerald and Illinois Jacquet.

Lewis was also part of trumpeter Miles Davis&#x27;s &quot;Birth of the Cool&quot; sessions. While in Europe, Lewis received letters from Davis urging him to come back to the United States and collaborate with him, Gil Evans, Gerry Mulligan and others on the second session of &quot;Birth of the Cool&quot;. From when he returned to the U.S. in 1948 through 1949, Lewis joined Davis&#x27;s nonet and is considered &quot;one of the more prolific arrangers with the 1949 Miles Davis Nonet&quot;. For the &quot;Birth of the Cool&quot; sessions, Lewis arranged &quot;S&#x27;il Vous Plait&quot;, &quot;Rouge&quot;, &quot;Move&quot; and &quot;Budo&quot;.

Lewis, vibraphonist Milt Jackson, drummer Clarke and bassist Ray Brown had been the small group within the Gillespie big band, and they frequently played their own short sets when the brass and reeds needed a break or even when Gillespie&#x27;s band was not playing. The small band received a lot of positive recognition and it led to the foursome forming a full-time working group, which they initially called the Milt Jackson Quartet in 1951 but in 1952 renamed the Modern Jazz Quartet.

===Modern Jazz Quartet===
The Modern Jazz Quartet was formed out of the foursome&#x27;s need for more freedom and complexity than Gillespie&#x27;s big band, dance-intended sound allowed. While Lewis wanted the MJQ to have more improvisational freedom, he also wanted to incorporate some classical elements and arrangements into his compositions. Lewis noticed that the style of bebop had turned all focus towards the soloist, and Lewis, in his compositions for the MJQ, attempted to even out the periods of improvisation with periods that were distinctly arranged. Lewis assumed the role of musical director from the start, even though the group claimed not to have a leader. It is commonly thought that &quot;John Lewis, for reasons of his contributions to the band, was apparently the first among the equals&quot;. Davis even once said that &quot;John taught all of them, Milt couldn&#x27;t read at all, and bassist Percy Heath hardly&quot;. It was Lewis who elevated the group&#x27;s collective talent because of his individual musical abilities.

Lewis gradually transformed the group away from strictly 1940s bebop style, which served as a vehicle for an individual artist&#x27;s improvisations, and instead oriented it toward a more refined, polished, chamber style of music. Lewis&#x27;s compositions for The Modern Jazz Quartet developed a &quot;neoclassical style&quot; of jazz that combined the bebop style with &quot;dynamic shading and dramatic pause more characteristic of jazz of the &#x27;20s and &#x27;30s&quot;. Francis Davis, in his book &quot;In the Moment: Jazz in the 1980s&quot;, wrote that by &quot;fashioning a group music in which the improvised chorus and all that surrounded it were of equal importance, Lewis performed a feat of magic only a handful of jazz writers, including Duke Ellington and Jelly Roll Morton, had ever pulled off—he reconciled the composer&#x27;s belief in predetermination with the improviser&#x27;s yen for free will&quot;.

Lewis also made sure that the band was always dressed impeccably. Lewis believed that it was important to dress the way that they came across in their music: polished, elegant and unique. Lewis once said in an interview with &quot;Down Beat&quot; magazine: &quot;My model for that was Duke Ellington. [His band] was the most elegant band I ever saw&quot;.

From 1952 through 1974, he wrote and performed with and for the quartet. Lewis&#x27;s compositions were paramount in earning the MJQ a worldwide reputation for managing to make jazz mannered without cutting the swing out of the music. Gunther Schuller for &quot;High Fidelity Magazine&quot; wrote: It will not come as a surprise that the Quartet&#x27;s growth has followed a line parallel to Lewis&#x27; own development as a composer. A study of his compositions from the early &quot;Afternoon in Paris&quot; to such recent pieces as &quot;La Cantatrice&quot; and &quot;Piazza Navona&quot; shows an increasing technical mastery and stylistic broadening. The wonder of his music is that the various influences upon his work—whether they be the fugal masterpieces of Bach, the folk-tinged music of Bartók, the clearly defined textures of Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Agon&quot;, or the deeply felt blues atmosphere that permeates all his music—these have all become synthesized into a thoroughly homogeneous personal idiom. That is why Lewis&#x27; music, though not radical in any sense, always sounds fresh and individual.

During the same time period, Lewis held various other positions as well, including head of faculty for the summer sessions held at the Lenox School of Jazz in Lenox, Massachusetts from 1957 to 1960, director of the annual Monterey Jazz Festival in California from 1958 to 1983, and its musical consultant, and &quot;he formed the cooperative big band Orchestra U.S.A., which performed and recorded Third Stream compositions (1962–65)&quot;. Orchestra U.S.A., along with all of Lewis&#x27;s compositions in general, were very influential in developing &quot;Third Stream&quot; music, which was largely defined by the interweave between classical and jazz traditions. He also formed the Jazz and Classical Music Society in 1955, which hosted concerts in Town Hall in New York City that assisted in this new genre of classically influenced jazz to increase in popularity. Furthermore, Lewis was also commissioned to compose the score to the 1957 film &quot;Sait-On Jamais&quot;, and his later film work included the scores to &quot;Odds Against Tomorrow&quot; (1959), &quot;A Milanese Story&quot; (1962), Derek Jarman&#x27;s version of &quot;The Tempest&quot; (1979), and the TV movie &quot;Emmanuelle 4: Concealed Fantasy&quot; (1994). His score to &quot;Odds Against Tomorrow&quot; was released on both an original soundtrack album (UA 5061) and an interpretation album by the MJQ in 1959.

The MJQ disbanded in 1974 because Jackson felt that the band was not getting enough money for the level of prestige the quartet had in the music scene. During this break, Lewis taught at the City College of New York and at Harvard University. Lewis was also able to travel to Japan, where CBS commissioned his first solo piano album. While in Japan, Lewis also collaborated with Hank Jones and Marian McPartland, with whom he performed piano recitals on various occasions.

In 1981, the Modern Jazz Quartet re-formed for a tour of Japan and the United States, although the group did not plan on performing regularly together again. Since the MJQ was no longer his primary career, Lewis had time to form and play in a sextet called the John Lewis Group. A few years later, in 1985, Lewis collaborated with Gary Giddins and Roberta Swann to form the American Jazz Orchestra. Additionally, he continued to teach jazz piano to aspiring jazz students, which he had done throughout his career. His teaching style involved making sure the student was fluent in &quot;three basic forms: the blues, a ballad, and a piece that moves&quot;. He continued teaching late into his life.

In 1989, Lewis was awarded an Honorary Doctorate from Berklee College of Music. He was recognized for his impact on jazz and his amazing career.

In the 1990s, Lewis partook of various musical ventures, including participating in the &quot;Re-birth of the Cool&quot; sessions with Gerry Mulligan in 1992, and &quot;The Birth of the Third Stream&quot; with Gunther Schuller, Charles Mingus and George Russell, and recorded his final albums with Atlantic Records, &quot;Evolution&quot; and &quot;Evolution II&quot;, in 1999 and 2000 respectively. He also continued playing sporadically with the MJQ until 1997, when the group permanently disbanded. Lewis performed a final concert at Lincoln Center in New York City in January 2001.

==Death and personal life==
Lewis died in New York City on March 29, 2001, as a result of prostate cancer. He had been married for 39 years to harpsichordist and pianist Mirjana (née Vrbanić; 1936–2010), with whom he had a son and a daughter.

==Music==

===Style and influence===
Leonard Feather&#x27;s opinion of Lewis&#x27;s work is representative of many other knowledgeable jazz listeners and critics: &quot;Completely self-sufficient and self-confident, he knows exactly what he wants from his musicians, his writing and his career and he achieves it with an unusual quiet firmness of manner, coupled with modesty and a complete indifference to critical reaction.&quot; Lewis was not only this way with his music, but his personality exemplified these same qualities.

Lewis, who was significantly influenced by the arranging style and carriage of Count Basie, played with a tone quality that made listeners and critics feel as though every note was deliberate. Schuller remembered of Lewis at his memorial service that &quot;he had a deep concern for every detail, every nuance in the essentials of music&quot;. Lewis became associated with representing a modernized Basie style, exceptionally skilled at creating music that was spacious, powerful and yet, refined. In an interview with &quot;Metronome&quot; magazine, Lewis himself said:
My ideals stem from what led to and became Count Basie&#x27;s band of the &#x27;30s and &#x27;40s. This group produced an integration of ensemble playing which projected—and sounded like—the spontaneous playing of ideas which were the personal expression of each member of the band rather than the arrangers or composers. This band had some of the greatest jazz soloists exchanging and improvising ideas with and counter to the ensemble and the rhythm section, the whole permeated with the fold-blues element developed to a most exciting degree. I don&#x27;t think it is possible to plan or make that kind of thing happen. It is a natural product and all we can do is reach and strive for it.
It is considered, however, that Lewis was successful in exemplifying, in his arrangements and compositions, this skill that he admired. Because of his classical training, in addition to his exposure to bebop, Lewis was able to combine the two disparate musical styles and refine jazz so that there was a &quot;sheathing of bop&#x27;s pointed anger in exchange for concert hall respectability&quot;.

Lewis was also influenced by the improvisations of Lester Young on the saxophone. Lewis had not been the first jazz pianist to be influenced by a horn player. Earl Hines in his early years looked to Louis Armstrong&#x27;s improvisations for inspiration and Bud Powell looked to Charlie Parker. Lewis also claims to have been influenced by Hines himself.

Lewis was also heavily influenced by European classical music. Many of his compositions for the MJQ and his own personal compositions incorporated various classically European techniques such as fugue and counterpoint, and the instrumentation he chose for his pieces, sometimes including a string orchestra.

In the early 1980s, Lewis&#x27;s influence came from the pianists he enjoyed listening to: Art Tatum, Hank Jones and Oscar Peterson.

===Piano style===
Len Lyons depicts Lewis&#x27;s piano, composition and personal style when he introduces Lewis in Lyons&#x27; book &quot;The Great Jazz Pianists&quot;: &quot;Sitting straight-backed, jaw rigid, presiding over the glistening white keyboard of the grand piano, John Lewis clearly brooks no nonsense in his playing, indulges in no improvisational frivolity, and exhibits no breach of discipline nor any phrase that could be construed as formally incorrect. Lewis, of course, can swing, play soulful blues and emote through his instrument, but it is the swing and sweat of the concert hall, not of smoke-filled, noisy nightclubs.&quot; Although Lewis is considered to be a bebop pianist, he is also considered to be one of the more conservative players. Instead of emphasizing the intense, fast tempoed bebop style, his piano style was geared towards emphasizing jazz as an &quot;expression of quiet conflict&quot;. His piano style, bridging the gap between classical, bop, stride and blues, made him so &quot;it was not unusual to hear him mentioned in the same breath with Morton, Ellington, and Monk&quot;. On the piano, his improvisational style was primarily quiet and gentle and understated. Lewis once advised three saxophonists who were improvising on one of his original compositions: &quot;You have to put yourself at the service of the melody... Your solos should expand the melody or contract it&quot;. This was how he approached his solos as well. He proved in his solos that taking a &quot;simple and straightforward... approach to a melody could... put [musicians] in touch with such complexities of feeling&quot;, which the audience appreciated just as much as the musicians themselves.

His accompaniment for other musicians&#x27; solos was just as delicate. Thomas Owens describes his accompaniment style by noting that &quot;rather than comping—punctuating the melody with irregularly placed chords—he often played simple counter-melodies in octaves which combined with the solo and bass parts to form a polyphonic texture&quot;.

===Compositions and arrangements===
Similarly to his personal piano playing style, Lewis was drawn in his compositions to minimalism and simplicity. Many of his compositions were based on motifs and relied on few chord progressions. Francis Davis comments: &quot;I think too, that the same conservative lust for simplicity of forms that draws Lewis to the Renaissance and the Baroque draws him inevitably to the blues, another form of music permitting endless variation only within the logic of rigid boundaries&quot;.

His compositions were influenced by 18th-century melodies and harmonies, but also showed an advanced understanding of the &quot;secrets of tension and release, the tenets of dynamic shading and dramatic pause&quot; that was reminiscent of classic arrangements by Basie and Ellington in the early swing era. This combining of techniques led to Lewis becoming a pioneer in Third Stream Jazz, which was combined classical, European practices with jazz&#x27;s improvisational and big-band characteristics.

Lewis, in his compositions, experimented with writing fugues and incorporating classical instrumentation. An article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;His new pieces and reworkings of older pieces are designed to interweave string orchestra and jazz quartet as equals&quot;. &quot;High Fidelity&quot; magazine wrote that his &quot;works not only show a firm control of the compositional medium, but tackle in a fresh way the complex problem of improvisation with composed frameworks&quot;.

Thomas Owen believes that &quot;[Lewis&#x27;] best pieces for the MJQ are &#x27;Django&#x27;, the ballet suite &quot;The Comedy&quot; (1962, Atl.), and especially the four pieces &#x27;Versailles&#x27;, &#x27;Three Windows&#x27;, &#x27;Vendome&#x27; and &#x27;Concorde&#x27;... combine fugal imitation and non-imitative polyphonic jazz in highly effective ways.&quot;

<text>Ouachita Baptist University (OBU) is a private Baptist university in Arkadelphia, Arkansas. The university&#x27;s name is taken from the Ouachita (pronounced WAH-shi-tah) River, which forms the eastern campus boundary. It is affiliated with the Arkansas Baptist State Convention, a state convention affiliated with the Southern Baptist Convention.

==History==
Ouachita Baptist University was founded as Ouachita Baptist College on September 6, 1886, and has operated continually since that date. It was originally located on the campus of Ouachita Baptist High School. Its current location is on the former campus of the Arkansas School for the Blind, which relocated to Little Rock.

The first president was J. W. Conger, who was elected to the post on June 22, 1886. The OBU Board of Trustees unanimously elected Dr. Ben Sells, former vice president for university advancement at Taylor University, as the sixteenth president of Ouachita Baptist University on April 7, 2016. Those who have served as president include J. W. Conger (1886–1907), Henry Simms Hartzog (1907–1911), R. G. Bowers (1911–1913), Samuel Young Jameson (1913–1916), Charles Ernest Dicken (1916–1926), Arthur B. Hill (1926–1929), Charles D. Johnson (1929–1933), James R. Grant (1933–1949), Seaford Eubanks (1949–1951), Harold A. Haswell (1952–1953), Ralph Arloe Phelps Jr. (1953–1969), Daniel R. Grant (1970–1988), Ben M. Elrod (1988–1998), Andrew Westmoreland (1998–2006) and Rex Horne (2006–2015). 

In 1965 the college changed its name to Ouachita Baptist University.

==Academics==
The university is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission with specific programs accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB International), National Council for the Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE), National Association for Schools of Music, the Commission on the Accreditation of Athletic Training Education Programs (CAATE), and the Commission on Accreditation for Dietetics Education (CADE) of the American Dietetic Association.

The university was ranked 178 of 185 in the 2024 National Liberal Arts Colleges rankings by U.S. News &amp; World Report.

==Athletics==
OBU fields intercollegiate men&#x27;s teams in baseball, basketball, football, soccer, swimming, tennis, cross country, and wrestling. Women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis and volleyball.

The school mascot is the Tiger, and colors are purple and gold. As of fall 2011, Ouachita began competition in the Great American Conference. 

The Tigers football team were the conference champions of the inaugural 2011 season and the 2014, 2017, 2018, and 2019 seasons. In wrestling, a sport not sponsored by the GAC, OBU competes as a single-sport member of the Great Lakes Valley Conference.

In 2010, Ouachita Baptist was the first university in Arkansas to offer an NCAA wrestling program. Dallas Smith, a four-time All-American, earned the program&#x27;s first national title at the NCAA Division II National Championships in 2015.

<doc id="310817" wikidata="Q1532765" url="?curid=310817" title="Wetback (slur)">
<text>Wetback is a derogatory term used in the United States to refer to foreign nationals residing in the U.S., most commonly Mexicans. The word mostly targets illegal immigrants in the United States. Generally used as an ethnic slur, the term was originally coined and applied only to Mexicans who entered the U.S. state of Texas from Mexico by crossing the Rio Grande, which is the U.S. border, presumably by swimming or wading across the river and getting wet, i.e. getting their back wet, in the process.

==Usage==
The first use of the term &quot;wetback&quot; in &quot;The New York Times&quot; is dated June 20, 1920. It was used officially by the US government, including Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1954, with &quot;Operation Wetback&quot;, a project that involved the mass deportation of illegal Mexican immigrants. Usage of the term appeared in mainstream media outlets until the 1960s.

The term can be used as an adjective or verb. As an adjective, it pertains to activities involving Mexican illegal aliens in the United States. The earliest known recorded use in this way is by John Steinbeck in the novel &quot;Sweet Thursday&quot;, the sequel to &quot;Cannery Row&quot;, with the sentence &quot;How did he get in the &quot;wet-back&quot; business?&quot; It was originally used as a verb in 1978 in Thomas Sanchez&#x27;s &quot;Hollywoodland&quot;, with the meaning &quot;to gain illegal entry into the United States by swimming the Rio Grande&quot;.

The equivalent Spanish-language term used in Mexico, Central America, and by Latinos in the United States is &quot;espalda mojada&quot;, and is often shortened to &quot;&quot;. It is not normally considered derisive in those contexts. For example, Guatemalan Latin Pop singer Ricardo Arjona&#x27;s 2006 song &quot;Mojado&quot; uses the word inoffensively, as he describes a migrant seeking a better life in another country, suggesting a reclaiming of the word.

<doc id="310824" wikidata="Q474485" url="?curid=310824" title="Marshal of France">
<text>Marshal of France (, plural &quot;) is a French military distinction, rather than a military rank, that is awarded to generals for exceptional achievements. The title has been awarded since 1185, though briefly abolished (1793–1804) and for a period dormant (1870–1916). It was one of the Great Officers of the Crown of France during the and Bourbon Restoration, and one of the Grand Dignitaries of the Empire during the First French Empire (when the title was Marshal of the Empire, not Marshal of France).

A Marshal of France displays seven stars on each shoulder strap. A marshal also receives a baton – a blue cylinder with stars, formerly fleurs-de-lis during the monarchy and eagles during the First French Empire. The baton bears the Latin inscription of &quot;, which means &quot;terror in war, ornament in peace&quot;.

Between the end of the 16th century and the middle of the 19th century, six Marshals of France were given the even more exalted rank of Marshal General of France: , , , , , and .

The distinction of Admiral of France is the equivalent in the French Navy.

==History==
The title derived from the office of &quot;marescallus Franciae&quot; created by King Philip II Augustus for Albéric Clément about 1190.

The title was abolished by the National Convention in 1793. It was restored as Marshal of the Empire during the First French Empire by Napoleon. Under the Bourbon Restoration, the title reverted to Marshal of France, and Napoleon III kept that designation.

After the fall of Napoleon III and the Second French Empire, the Third Republic did not use the title until the First World War, when it was recreated as a military distinction and not a rank.

Contrarily to ranks, which are awarded by the army, the distinction of Marshal of France is awarded by a special law voted by the French Parliament. For this reason, it is impossible to demote a Marshal. The most famous case is Philippe Pétain, who was awarded the distinction of Marshal of France for his generalship in World War I, and who was stripped of other positions and titles after his trial for high treason due to his involvement with collaborationist Vichy France: due to the principle of separation of powers, the court that judged him did not have the power to cancel the law that had made him a Marshal in the first place.

The last living Marshal of France was Alphonse Juin, promoted in 1952, who died in 1967. The latest Marshal of France was Marie-Pierre Kœnig, who was made a Marshal posthumously in 1984. Today, the title of Marshal of France can only be granted to a general officer who fought victoriously in war-time.

<text>Air North Charter and Training Ltd., operating as , is a Canadian airline based in Whitehorse, Yukon. It operates scheduled passenger and cargo flights throughout Yukon, as well as between Yukon and the Northwest Territories, British Columbia, Alberta, and Ontario. The airline also operates charter flights throughout Canada and Alaska. The airline also provides ground handling services and fuel services to other airlines throughout Yukon, and it also provides ground handling services at Vancouver International Airport and Edmonton International Airport. Its main base is Erik Nielsen Whitehorse International Airport.

== History ==
The airline was established by Joe Sparling and Tom Woods, and started flight training and general purpose charter operations in 1977 with a single Cessna 206. Throughout the 1980s, the company grew and acquired several aircraft including Douglas DC-3s, a Douglas DC-4, and a variety of Cessnas, de Havillands and other aircraft. Air North also began offering scheduled passenger and cargo service in addition to charter services.

During the 1990s, its piston-powered fleet were replaced with more modern and reliable turboprop aircraft, and by 2000 the fleet consisted of one Beechcraft Model 99 and three Hawker Siddeley 748 Series 2As.

The Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation of Old Crow also began investing in Air North during this time. This investment enabled Air North to acquire two Boeing 737-200 jets in 2002. These jets allowed Air North to begin competing with the mainline carriers between Yukon and Vancouver, Calgary and Edmonton. These routes proved to be successful and have since been joined by Kelowna, Yellowknife, Ottawa, Toronto, and Victoria. Since Air North began scheduled jet service, passenger traffic at the Erik Nielsen Whitehorse International Airport has doubled, and by 2014 nearly 60% of Whitehorse passengers were flying Air North.

The Beech 99 was sold in 2005, a fourth Hawker Siddeley 748 was acquired in 2006, and in 2008 a Boeing 737-200 Combi was acquired. The combi&#x27;s large main deck cargo door and moveable bulkhead allowed for all-cargo as well as mixed cargo/passenger operations. A gravel kit was later installed on the 737 Combi, allowing the aircraft to operate on the airline&#x27;s northern routes.

In 2010, the airline started a new fleet expansion and modernization plan, starting with the purchase of a 737-400 and a winglet-equipped 737-500. In 2012, a fifth HS-748 (a pure freighter equipped with the large freight door) and a second 737-500 were acquired. 2014 saw the arrival of the third 737-500 sporting an updated livery, and a fourth 737-500 was put into service in 2016.

In 2017, two ATR 42 combi aircraft were introduced to replace existing HS748 aircraft, ending worldwide scheduled passenger HS-748 service. With newer aircraft in service, the three 737-200s and five HS-748s were retired or sold. Some are now parked behind Air North&#x27;s maintenance base and used for spare parts and staff training.

Starting in 2024 the company&#x27;s fleet was further updated with the introduction of Boeing 737 Next Generation, starting with two 737-800 aircraft. Both are equipped with winglets, short field performance package and Boeing sky interiors.

Since the arrival of the Boeing 737s, the main Air North base in Whitehorse has steadily expanded. It now includes the original hangar which is now used as a cargo warehouse and ground equipment shop, a new aircraft maintenance hangar, a reservations and administration building, an operations centre, an in-house catering and cabin services department, and a fuelling facility. Air North also operates secondary bases in Vancouver, B.C. and Dawson City, Yukon. The in-house catering building opened in the mid-2000s, enabling Air North to offer a complimentary light meal in-flight. Yukon products are featured when possible, and often include Midnight Sun coffee and Yukon Brewing beer.

In conjunction with North of Ordinary Media, Air North launched its inflight magazine, &quot;Yukon, North of Ordinary&quot; in February 2007. The magazine is published quarterly and is available in-flight, via subscription, and in bookstores across Canada. The magazine is owned and operated by North of Ordinary Media of Carcross, Yukon.

Most of Air North&#x27;s work is scheduled passenger and cargo flights between Whitehorse and Vancouver, Kelowna, Victoria, Calgary, Edmonton, Dawson City, Old Crow, Mayo and Inuvik. It also has summer seasonal service to Yellowknife, Ottawa and Toronto. Air North also runs regular freight trips and fuel-haul flights to the fly-in only community of Old Crow, Yukon. In addition to scheduled routes, Air North also offers passenger, combi, cargo and fuel-haul charter services to anywhere in North America with the ATR 42s and Boeing 737s. Regular charter customers include mine operators, cruise ship tour operators, fishing lodges, and sports teams. During the 2021 Canadian federal election, NDP leader Jagmeet Singh&#x27;s campaign chartered an Air North Boeing 737-500.

The remainder of Air North&#x27;s revenue comes from ground handling services at Whitehorse, Dawson City, Old Crow, Edmonton and Vancouver Airports, as well as Jet-A refuelling services at Whitehorse. Air North is currently the main provider of Jet-A fuel service in Whitehorse. It is also the ground handler for Condor Airlines and WestJet Airlines in Whitehorse, as well as several airlines in Vancouver.

In May 2022, Air North launched its inaugural twice-weekly flight to Toronto via Yellowknife.

Air North is now owned by Joseph Sparling (51%) (President, CEO, and Boeing 737 Captain) and the Vuntut Development Corporation (49%), an arm of the Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation. Air North is one of the largest private sector employers in Yukon. As of 2015 it has over 500 employees and more than 1,200 Class C &amp; D shareholders.

===Livery===
Air North&#x27;s aircraft are painted white except for the lettering on the fuselage, wings and vertical stabilizer. On the fuselage, the words &quot;Air North&quot; and &quot;Yukon&#x27;s Airline&quot; are painted, although the positioning varies by aircraft type. On aircraft without winglets, &quot;flyairnorth.com&quot; is painted somewhere on the fuselage.

The tail is painted orange with a stylized &quot;Yukon&quot; printed in white.

On aircraft with winglets, the outside is designed like the tail, with an orange background and the stylized &quot;Yukon&quot; printed on it. On the inside, &quot;flyairnorth.com&quot; is printed.

==&quot;Yukon, North of Ordinary&quot;==
&quot;Yukon, North of Ordinary&quot; (YNoO) is a quarterly arts, travel, and culture magazine in Yukon, Canada. The magazine was first published in February 2007. It is also the official inflight magazine for Air North.

==Accidents and incidents==
*On 20 September 1987, Piper PA-31 Navajo C-GPAC crashed on a flight from Whitehorse to Juneau, Alaska, killing all five on board. The plane crashed into a glacier at .
*On 19 August 1995, Douglas C-47B C-GZOF crashed on approach to Vancouver International Airport, Richmond, British Columbia, killing one of the three crew. The aircraft was on a ferry flight to Prince Rupert Airport when the starboard propeller went into overspeed and the decision was made to return to Vancouver International.
*On 14 August 1996, Douglas DC-4 C-FGNI crashed shortly after takeoff from Bronson Creek mine in Northern British Columbia with three crew and a full load of gold ore cargo on board. On climbout, number 2 engine caught fire and eventually separated from the aircraft. The crew attempted to bring the aircraft back to land, but the aircraft could not maintain altitude on three engines and the crew instead landed in the Iskut River about west of the Bronson Creek airstrip, where all three crew were able to escape the wreckage. The first officer and load master swam to shore, but the captain was never found and presumed to have drowned.

<doc id="310830" wikidata="Q17642916" url="?curid=310830" title="Nottingham Castle">
<text>Nottingham Castle is a Stuart Restoration-era ducal mansion in Nottingham, England, built on the site of a Norman castle built starting in 1068, and added to extensively through the medieval period, when it was an important royal fortress and occasional royal residence. In decline by the 16th century, the original castle, except for its walls and gates, was demolished after the English Civil War in 1651. The site occupies a commanding position on a natural promontory known as &quot;Castle Rock&quot; which dominates the city skyline, with cliffs high to the south and west. 

William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle, started to build the mansion in the 1670s; it was completed by his son, the 2nd Duke of Newcastle. This ducal palace was burnt by rioters in 1831, then left as a ruin until renovated in the 1870s to house an art gallery and museum, which remain in use. Little of the original castle survives other than the gatehouse and parts of the ramparts, but sufficient portions remain to give an impression of the layout of the site.

The castle is owned by Nottingham City Council. After a £30 million restoration from 2018, running of the site was undertaken by independent charitable Nottingham Castle Trust with reopening on 21 June 2022. The castle closed again on 21 November 2022 when the trust went into liquidation owing the council £2.68 million, with all employees made redundant by the joint-administrators. The castle and grounds reopened to visitors on 26 June 2023.

==History==
===Medieval history===
The first Norman castle on Castle Rock was a wooden structure of a motte-and-bailey design, begun in 1068, two years after the Battle of Hastings, on the orders of William the Conqueror. This wooden structure was replaced by a far more defensible stone castle during the reign of King Henry II, of an imposing and complex architectural design, which eventually comprised an upper bailey at the highest point of the castle rock, a middle bailey to the north containing the main royal apartments, and a large outer bailey to the east.

For centuries the castle served as one of the most important in England for nobles and royalty alike. In a strategic position due to its location near a crossing of the River Trent, it was also known as a place of leisure, being close to the royal hunting grounds at Tideswell, the &quot;Kings Larder&quot; in the Royal Forest of the Peak, and also close to the royal forests of Barnsdale and Sherwood. The castle also had its own deer park in the area immediately to the west, still known as The Park.

While King Richard I (&quot;the Lionheart&quot;) was away on the Third Crusade, along with a great number of English noblemen, Nottingham Castle was occupied by supporters of Prince John, including the Sheriff of Nottingham. In the legends of Robin Hood, Nottingham Castle is the scene of the final showdown between the sheriff and the heroic outlaw.

In March 1194, a historic battle took place at Nottingham Castle, part of the returned King Richard&#x27;s campaign to put down the rebellion of Prince John. The castle was the site of a decisive attack when King Richard besieged it after constructing some siege machines similar to those used on crusade. Richard was aided by Ranulph de Blondeville, 4th Earl of Chester, and David of Scotland, 8th Earl of Huntingdon. The castle surrendered after just a few days.

Shortly before his 18th birthday, King Edward III, with the help of a few trusted companions led by Sir William Montagu, staged a coup d&#x27;état at Nottingham Castle (19 October 1330) against his mother Isabella of France, and her lover, Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March. Both Isabella and Mortimer were acting as Regents during Edward&#x27;s minority following their murder of his father Edward II at Berkeley Castle. William Montagu and his companions were accompanied by William Eland, castellan and overseer of Mortimer&#x27;s castle, who knew the location of a secret tunnel which would take them higher up in the castle to a normally locked door. In the dark of night on 19 October 1330, Montagu and his companions entered the tunnel, climbed up to the door, which had now been unlocked either by Edward III or a trusted servant, and overpowered Mortimer, killing Mortimer&#x27;s personal guards. Mortimer was bound and gagged, led out of the tunnel and arrested, along with Queen Mother Isabella. Mortimer was sent to the Tower of London, and hanged a month later. Isabella of France was forced into retirement at Castle Rising Castle. With this dramatic event the personal reign of Edward began. These events seem to be echoed in an interpolation made to a metrical chronicle in around 1331, which describes the caves beneath the castle as having been carved out by Lancelot in his attempts to hide Guinevere from King Arthur following their adulterous affair. This seems to be the earliest reference to Lancelot and Guinevere&#x27;s adultery that exists.

===Royal residence===
Edward III used the castle as a residence and held parliaments. In 1346 King David II of Scotland was held prisoner. In 1365 Edward III improved the castle with a new tower on the west side of the Middle Bailey and a new prison under the High Tower. In 1376 Peter de la Mare, speaker of the House of Commons, was confined in Nottingham Castle for having &quot;taken unwarrantable liberties with the name of Alice Perrers, mistress of the king&quot;.

In 1387 the state council was held in the castle. Richard II held the Lord Mayor of London, aldermen and sheriffs in the castle in 1392, and held another state council for the purpose of humbling Londoners. The last visit recorded by Richard II was in 1397 when another council was held here.

From 1403 until 1437 it was the main residence of Henry IV&#x27;s queen, Joan. After the residence of Joan maintenance was reduced. Only upon the Wars of the Roses did Nottingham Castle begin to be used again as a military stronghold. Edward IV proclaimed himself king in Nottingham, and in 1476 he ordered the construction of a new tower and Royal Apartments. This was described by John Leland in 1540 as:

the most beautifulest part and gallant building for lodging... a right sumptuous piece of stone work.

During the reign of Henry VII, the castle remained a royal fortress. Henry VIII ordered new tapestries from Cornelius van der Strete for the castle before he visited Nottingham in August 1511. In 1538 the Constable, Thomas Manners, 1st Earl of Rutland, reported on the need for maintenance. A survey in 1525 stated that there was much &quot;dekay and ruyne of said castell&quot; and

part of the roof of the Great Hall is fallen down both timber and lead. Also the new building there is in dekay of timber, lead and glass.

In 1536, the Earl of Rutland had the castle reinforced with a new drawbridge and its garrison increased from a few dozen men to a few hundred in response to the Pilgrimage of Grace.

===Civil war===
The castle ceased to be a royal residence by 1600 and was largely rendered obsolete in the 17th century by artillery. A short time following the outbreak of the English Civil War, the castle was already in a semi-ruined state after a number of skirmishes occurred on the site. At the start of the Civil War, in August 1642, Charles I chose Nottingham as the rallying point for his armies, but soon after he departed, the castle rock was made defensible and held by the Parliamentarians. Commanded by John Hutchinson, they repulsed several Royalist attacks, and they were the last group to hold the castle. In 1648 the Royalist commander Marmaduke Langdale, fleeing after defeat in the Battle of Preston, was captured and held in Nottingham Castle, but he managed to escape and make his way to Europe. In 1651, two years after the execution of Charles I in 1649, the castle was razed to prevent it being used again.

===Construction of the Ducal Mansion===


After the restoration of Charles II in 1660, the present &#x27;Ducal Mansion&#x27; was built for the 1st Duke of Newcastle and completed by his son, the 2nd Duke of Newcastle, after the 1st Duke&#x27;s death. This &quot;Italianate&quot; palace was seen as one of the finest in England at the time. Despite the destruction of the keep and fortifications of the upper bailey, some rock cut cellars and medieval pointed arches survive beneath the mansion, together with a long passage to the bottom of the rock, commonly known as Mortimer&#x27;s Hole, through which guided tours take place, starting at the castle and ending at Brewhouse Yard.

The mason for the mansion was Samuel Marsh of Lincoln, who also worked for the duke at Bolsover Castle. His designs are generally thought to have been strongly influenced by Rubens&#x27;s engravings, in his book &quot;Palazzi di Genova&quot;. The duke&#x27;s mansion is a relatively rare surviving example in England of the style of Artisan Mannerism.

However, the mansion lost its appeal to the later dukes with the coming of the Industrial Revolution, which left Nottingham with the reputation of having the worst slums in the British Empire outside India. When residents of these slums rioted in 1831, in protest against the 4th Duke of Newcastle&#x27;s opposition to the Reform Bill, they burned down the mansion. The original exterior stairs on the eastern façade of the mansion were subsequently demolished to create a parade ground for the Robin Hood Rifles.

===Reconstruction as the Nottingham Castle Museum===
The mansion remained a derelict shell until it was restored in 1875 by Thomas Chambers Hine, and opened in 1878 by the Prince of Wales, (later King Edward VII) as Nottingham Castle Museum, the first municipal art gallery in the UK outside London. The new interiors ignored the original floor levels and fenestration to accommodate a top-lit picture gallery modelled after the Grand Gallery of the Louvre.

The gatehouse of the medieval castle and much of the walling of the outer bailey was retained as a garden wall for the Ducal Mansion. However, the northernmost part of the outer bailey was lost when an approach road was constructed in the 1830s for the development of The Park Estate on the former deer park.

In September 1939 the British Army took possession of the Castle and its grounds, and in 1941 control transferred to the Air Ministry. Large quantities of stores were kept there for the duration of the Second World War. It was handed back to the city in 1946.

On Christmas Day 1996 a landslip, caused by a leaking water main, led to 80 tonnes of earth and retaining wall from the Restoration terrace next to the mansion falling to the bottom of the Castle Rock. This revealed some remains of the original castle foundations and the bedrock. After a lengthy controversy on the best conservation/restoration approach, the terrace was reinstated with a traditional stone façade. The terrace offers great views to the south of the city, and appeared in the film &quot;Saturday Night and Sunday Morning&quot;, a film about the changing attitude of youth in a changing industrial society.
A drawing of the Ducal Mansion appeared on millions of packets of rolling tobacco and cigarettes made by John Player &amp; Sons, a Nottingham firm. Most packets had the phrases &quot;Nottingham Castle&quot; and &quot;Trade Mark&quot; bracketing the image of the non-fortress-like structure. This led the novelist Ian Fleming to refer to &quot;that extraordinary trademark of a dolls house swimming in chocolate fudge with Nottingham Castle written underneath&quot; in &quot;Thunderball&quot;, in the knowledge that his British readers would be familiar with the image.

===Renovation between 2018 and 2021===
Nottingham Castle and its grounds closed to the public in 2018 to undergo largescale redevelopments. The closure was much longer than anticipated due to the COVID-19 pandemic and cost £30 million. A new visitor centre was created together with exhibition galleries, interactive displays, a children&#x27;s adventure area in the old castle moat themed on Robin Hood&#x27;s era and a showcase of local industries including Nottingham Lace. 

On 1 June 2021, Nottingham City Council handed over responsibility for running the castle to the independent, charitable Nottingham Castle Trust. The castle reopened on 21 June 2021.

===Criticism and insolvency===
Soon after re-opening, in late August 2021 the Castle Trust received negative reviews on Tripadvisor with criticism of the £13 adult entrance charge being too high; entry to the grounds had previously been without charge or at &quot;a nominal payment&quot; for Nottingham City residents. The charge was criticised by a local ghost tour operator as likely to be counter-productive to the new café revenue, with local visitors effectively barred from the grounds by the admission price. The trust was also criticised for the way it handled an alleged racist incident in the grounds, and staff published an open letter alleging a &quot;toxic culture&quot; and being &quot;gaslit&quot; around concerns about racism and misogyny. Two trustees stepped down in September 2022 after pressure from external groups over their handling of the racist incident and other governance issues at the castle. 

On 21 November 2022, the Castle Trust announced that it was in the process of appointing liquidators and that the castle grounds and exhibitions would be closed to visitors until further notice. The site was returned to the council, which announced that they would reopen it as soon as possible. The trust said that the failure was due to the covid pandemic in the UK from 2020, the later financial crisis, and the tripling of energy costs going into the quietest trading period of the year.

In addition to the restoration costs of £30 million covered by major grants, in late November 2022 it was revealed that the Castle Trust itself had debts to the council of £2.68 million in operating cost loans. Additionally, a non-charitable limited company providing services within the grounds was part of the insolvency, and all of the staff were made redundant by 30 November 2022. Nottingham City Council&#x27;s executive board announced on 21 March 2023 that Nottingham Castle would reopen in late June 2023, with events taking place before the full reopening. The castle and grounds, including the Brewhouse Yard, re-opened to visitors on 26 June 2023. It is to be run as part of the city council&#x27;s museums operations.

==Nottingham Castle Museum==
Until its closure for refurbishment in July 2018, the ducal mansion was in use as a museum and art gallery. Since reopening it continues to house most of the City of Nottingham&#x27;s fine and decorative art collections, galleries on the history and archaeology of Nottingham and the surrounding areas, and the regimental museum of the Sherwood Foresters. Notable elements of the collections were:
* 15th-century Nottingham alabaster carvings, including those found in 1779 during the demolition of St Peter&#x27;s Church, Flawford
* Watercolours by Richard Parkes Bonnington and Paul Sandby
* The Joseph Collection of Wedgwood Jasperware
* The Ballantyne Collection of contemporary ceramics
* Salt-glazed stoneware, including locally-made &quot;bear jugs&quot;
* A costume collection including Nottingham lace-making
* Roman votive offerings from the Temple of Diana Nemorensis at Lake Nemi
* Works by George Wallis

Additionally, The Nottingham Castle Victoria Cross Memorial, dedicated on 7 May 2010, lists Albert Ball and 19 other Nottinghamshire recipients of the Victoria Cross.

Fine art from Britain and continental Europe is displayed in the Long Gallery of the Castle. It included works by artists from Nottinghamshire such as Thomas Barber, Richard Bonington, Henry Dawson, Paul Sandby and John Rawson Walker, and 20th-century works by Edward Burra, Tristram Hillier, Ivon Hitchens, Dame Laura Knight, Harold Knight, L.S. Lowry, William, Ben and Winifred Nicholson, Stanley Spencer, Matthew Smith and Edward Wadsworth.

<doc id="310836" wikidata="Q463471" url="?curid=310836" title="Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement">
<text>The Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement is a Protestant Christian denomination in the Sabbatarian Adventist movement that formed from a schism in the European Seventh-day Adventist Church during World War I over the position its European church leaders took on Sabbath observance and on committing Adventists to the bearing of arms in military service for Imperial Germany in World War I.

The movement was formerly organised on an international level in 1925 at Gotha, Germany and adopted the name &quot;Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement&quot;. It was first registered as a General Conference association in 1929 in Burgwedel, near Hanover, Germany. Following the General Conference association&#x27;s dissolution by the Gestapo in 1936 it was re-registered in Sacramento, California, United States in 1949. Its present world headquarters are in Roanoke, Virginia, USA.

The Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement is governed by a General Conference, a worldwide association of constituent territorial Units consisting of Union Conferences, State/Field Conferences, Mission Fields and Missions not attached to any other unit. Through its local church congregations and groups of adherents, affiliated publishing houses, schools, health clinics and hospitals, the Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement is active in over 132 countries of the world.

The movement&#x27;s beliefs largely reflect its distinctive Seventh-day Adventist Church heritage and foundational pillars, with some small divergences. See on &quot;Beliefs&quot; below.

== History ==
=== 1914-1918 Seventh-day Adventist Church Schism (Europe) ===
The Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement came about as a result of the actions of L. R. Conradi and certain European church leaders during the war, who decided that it was acceptable for Adventists to take part in war, which was in clear opposition to the historical position of the church that had always upheld the non-combative position. Since the American Civil War, Adventists were known as non-combatants, and had done work in hospitals or given medical care rather than combat roles. The Seventh-day Adventist leaders in Europe when the war began, determined on their own that it was permissible for Adventists to bear arms and serve in the military and other changes which went against traditional Adventist beliefs.

The General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists sent Seventh-day Adventist minister and General Conference Secretary William Ambrose Spicer to investigate the changes these leaders had instituted, but was unable to undo what L. R. Conradi and the others had done during the war. After the war, the Seventh-day Adventist church sent a delegation of four brethren from the General Conference (Arthur G. Daniells who was president of General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists, L. H. Christian, F. M. Wilcox, M. E. Kern) in July 1920, who came to a Ministerial Meeting in Friedensau with the hope of a reconciliation. Before the 200 Pastors and the Brethren from the General Conference present at this meeting, its European church leaders, G. Dail, L. R. Conradi, H. F. Schuberth, and P. Drinhaus withdrew their statement about military service and apologized for what they had done. The Reformers were informed of this and the next day saw a meeting by the Adventist brethren with the Reform-Adventists. A. G. Daniells urged them to return to the Seventh-day Adventist church, but the Reform-Adventists maintained that the European church leaders had forsaken the truth during the war and the reconciliation failed. Soon after they began to form a separate group from the official Adventist church. A related group which also came about for the same reasons was the True and Free Seventh-day Adventists (TFSDA) which formed in the Soviet Union at this time, whose most well known leader was Vladimir Shelkov.

=== The 1951 Schism - SDARM General Conference Session Zeist, Netherlands and its Aftermath ===

A major division then took place within the Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement itself at its General Conference session held at Zeist, Utrecht (province), Netherlands in 1951. The cause for the division involved tensions that had arisen over unresolved issues of the preceding years. Charges of arbitrariness and authoritarianism by the Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement leader and on the part of the General Conference administration towards member Units, failures by the General Conference committee to adequately resolve moral failings among leaders, issues concerning mal-administration of Church finances, and procedural and organisational irregularities prior to and during the Session itself are cited by the present organisation as significant contributing factors.

After two weeks of deliberations within the Session trying to resolve some of these tensions, a move was made by a number of delegates to read a declaration enumerating the main problems involved and requesting that a committee to address the entire situation be established. The motion carried on the first vote but was overturned by the chairman. To signify their protest at what was held to be an arbitrary decision of the chair, 45% of delegates present, led by the then Secretary of the General Conference, left the Session room. The Session&#x27;s proceedings faltered at this point. Efforts to reconcile the situation while all delegates were still present in Netherlands failed.

Another factor affecting the administration of the Session at the time was the international situation behind the Iron Curtain. Many of the units attached to the General Conference were unable to send delegates to the Zeist session due to restrictions on religious bodies in communist lands. Proxy letters from a number of Union Conferences were held by the General Conference Secretary enabling the session to convene legally (a provision enabled in the 1949 corporate registration), though the proxy holder still only had one vote regardless of the number of proxies held. Those Units not represented directly accounted for approximately 60% of the organization&#x27;s membership. Consequently, neither of the two factions that became evident at the Zeist session were in a position to make any unilateral decisions.

Over the course of the next year, steps were taken by both parties to explain the situation to their respective member bodies (Union Conferences) that were affiliated up until this time to the one worldwide church administration. Both factions re-organised themselves as General Conference committees independently of each other and proceeded to take the oversight of the SDARM General Conference affairs.

==== SDARM General Conference Headquarters in Roanoke, Virginia, USA ====
The Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement had been first registered as a general conference association in Burgwedel, near Hanover, Germany in 1929. Though never approved by the inaugural 1925 Gotha SDARM General Conference Session, the designation &quot;International Missionary Society&quot; was added to the beginning of the name. The full registered name at that time took the form &quot;International Missionary Society, Seventh-day Adventist Reform Movement, General Conference&quot;. The reasons for adding the designation to the beginning of the name were purely pragmatic, and done in the interests of securing General Conference finances on loan to one of its member Units, namely the German Union Conference. The SDARM General Conference operated under this German registration until 1936 when the association was dissolved by the Gestapo.

From 1936 until the conclusion of the World War II, there was no legally registered SDARM General Conference entity anywhere in the world, and would not be until 1949. The international situation during those years prevented the convening of a General Conference Session. It was not until 1948, when the first post-war General Conference session was held, that the delegates agreed to re-register the worldwide interests of the Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement by incorporating the SDARM General Conference as an association in the USA. They also agreed to do this &quot;under the name that was adopted by the General Conference delegation in session in 1925&quot;. This decision was carried out in 1949. The registered name was now correctly, &quot;Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement General Conference.&quot; It was under the By-Laws of this newly incorporated body that the 1951 Zeist General Conference Session was convened.

By 1951 the SDARM General Conference affairs and financial interests were formally associated with the USA registered entity. Consequently, in the aftermath of the Zeist session, legal proceedings to establish the recognized administrators of the registered General Conference corporate entity commenced. These proceedings were finalised in May 1952 in an out-of-court agreement between the two factions. Representatives of the faction that had engaged in the protest walk-out in 1951 were left in control of the registered SDARM General Conference association.

By 1955, when the next Session of Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement General Conference convened under the auspices the USA registered association, delegates present represented &quot;9000 members (1000 less than in 1951)&quot;. This was a representation of 90% of the worldwide church membership recorded prior to the 1951 division.

====International Missionary Society (IMS)====
Following the 1952 legal proceedings, in June of that year, representatives of the faction that had been the subject of the protest at Zeist conducted a second re-organisation. To distinguish themselves from their opposing faction, they adopted the name &quot;International Missionary Society, Seventh-day Adventist Reform Movement, General Conference&quot; with headquarters in Mosbach, Baden in Germany. As mentioned previously, the Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement, as a general conference association, had been registered under this name in Germany in 1929 and operated under that name until 1936 when the association was dissolved by the Gestapo. &quot;International Missionary Society&quot; was a name that had been associated with the German Union Conference of the Seventh-Day Adventist Reform Movement from its inception in 1919?. As the inaugural 1925 SDARM General Conference session did not agree to use this designation in its official name, the 1949 registered entity did not use it. With the opposing faction now adopting this designation and adding it to the 1925 agreed name, the designation &quot;International Missionary Society&quot; thereafter became associated exclusively with those affiliated with the interests of that faction.

==== Post 1952 Re-Unification Attempts - IMS and SDARM General Conference ====
With both factions formally organized, affiliations of Union and Field Conferences associated under one or the other of the two corporate administrations. Though they remained separate both in administration and worship, the theological beliefs espoused by each entity&#x27;s adherents were common to both. Despite this common platform of belief, tensions from the 1951 schism continued to remain high. Consequently, official efforts in 1967 and again in 1993 to reconcile both administrations at a General Conference level were unsuccessful.

====Post World War II relations with Seventh-day Adventist Church====
In 2005, the mainstream Seventh-day Adventist church tried to make amends and apologized for its failures during World War II, as the issue from the actions of L. R. Conradi continued during that war also. Some members see it as the first attempts to reconcile the Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement with the mainstream Seventh-day Adventist church. However, the actions of the SDA Church towards those who took a conscientious stand against all military service during World War I, were not acknowledged in the apology. The position of the SDA Church towards those engaged in military service, particularly combatants, remains an unresolved issue today.

== Name of Church Congregations ==
While local church congregations use the name Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement, those affiliated with the International Missionary Society General Conference also combine the designation &quot;International Missionary Society&quot; into their name to distinguish themselves from SDARM General Conference Units.

== Beliefs ==

The Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement (SDARM General Conference) identifies itself with a conservative Seventh-day Adventist theological and eschatological heritage. While it holds to the basic tenets of the Seventh-day Adventist faith, commonly referred to as the pillars or landmarks of the faith for these landmark teachings, there is a divergence in degree on some post-1914 doctrinal positions taken by L. R. Conradi and some of the European church leaders of the Seventh-day Adventist Church in both interpretation and application.

The Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement&#x27;s official position as conscientious objectors in relation to war and military service reflects the pacifist position of the Seventh-day Adventist Church during the 1861-1865 American Civil War. This is in direct response to what L. R. Conradi and others presented to the members and distinct from the official Seventh-day Adventist Church position which is one of non-combatancy, though in practice Seventh-day Adventist members have served in combatant roles in the military services.

Other divergences include the Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement&#x27;s positions on divorce and remarriage, closed communion, the sealing work of Revelation 7 (the SDARM holding to a pre-1914 view of its literal and number-limited nature), and the remnant church of Revelation 12:17.

The Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement, as does the official Seventh-day Adventist Church, maintains the belief that Ellen G. White, a co-founder of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, manifested the New Testament &quot;Gift of Prophecy&quot;. Though she had died before the formation of the SDA Reform Movement, her inspired writings, commonly referred to as testimonies, are held in the highest regard by the movement as a whole. Consistent with the Seventh-day Adventist Church, the SDA Reform Movement believes her inspired works do not take the place of the Bible. Rather they are considered a help to the believing church in bringing men and women back to the neglected truths of the Bible, with an emphasis on the need for professed believers to be faithful in the practice of its principles. 
Whereas the Seventh-day Adventist church emphasises the message of the three angels of Revelation 14:6-12, the Reform Movement places a distinct emphasis on a fourth angelic message based on Revelation 18:1-4. The movement claims that the message of this other angel was first given at 1888 Minneapolis General Conference of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. This claim is maintained by the Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement as the unique purpose for its existence as a distinct organisation separate from the Seventh-day Adventist Church. The message is captured in the expression &quot;Christ our Righteousness&quot;, the foundation for &quot;Justification by Faith&quot;.

Aside from the divergences, an examination of the SDA Reform Movement&#x27;s published beliefs, indicate many similarities in theology with the traditional Seventh-day Adventist beliefs and also the more conservative Historic Adventism and Last Generation Theology wings of the Seventh-day Adventist Church.

<doc id="310842" wikidata="Q1998931" url="?curid=310842" title="North-Western Territory">
<text>The North-Western Territory was a region of British North America extant until 1870 and named for where it lay in relation to Rupert&#x27;s Land.

Due to the lack of development, exploration, and cartographic limits of the time, the exact boundaries, ownership, and administration of the region were not precisely defined when the territory was extant. There is also not a definitive date when the British first asserted sovereignty over the territory. Maps vary in defining the boundaries of the territory; however, in modern usage, the region is generally accepted to be the region bounded by modern-day British Columbia, the continental divide with Rupert&#x27;s Land, Russian America (later Alaska), and the Arctic Ocean. The territory covered what is now the Yukon, mainland Northwest Territories, northwestern mainland Nunavut, northwestern Saskatchewan, and northern Alberta.

The North-Western Territory was not technically within the area of land granted to the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company in May 1670, as the region did not drain into Hudson&#x27;s Bay. However, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (HBC) was still the de facto administrator of the region and the territory was included in the same process of transferring Rupert&#x27;s Land to Canada from the HBC, effective on July 15, 1870.

==History==

It is obscure when exactly Great Britain first asserted sovereignty over the territory; however, after France accepted British sovereignty over the Hudson Bay coast by the Treaty of Utrecht (1713), Britain was the only European power with practical access to that part of the continent. The Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, despite the royal charter assigning only Rupert&#x27;s Land to the company, had long used the region as part of its trading area. The North West Company also hunted and trapped on the land and this led to frequent conflicts between the companies. To ease tensions, the British government assigned administrative duties to the HBC, while still allowing The North West Company to hunt on the lands with the passage of &quot;An act for regulating the fur trade, and establishing a criminal and civil jurisdiction within certain parts of North America&quot;, in 1821. As well, large areas of Rupert&#x27;s Land were not accurately mapped then to know the precise boundaries. The British made almost no effort to assert sovereignty over the aboriginal peoples of the area. In accordance with the Royal Proclamation of 1763, large-scale settlement by non-aboriginal people was prohibited until the lands were surrendered by treaty.

In 1862 during the Stikine Gold Rush, part of the North-Western Territory became the Stickeen (Stikine) Territory when the Stikine became inundated by American miners and, to prevent any resulting American claims to or agitation for the region, Governor James Douglas of the Vancouver Island and British Columbia colonies declared the area a British territory. The coastal area at the mouth of the Stikine was part of Russian America at the time, but the British had rights of free navigation to the Stikine by treaties in 1825 and 1839 as well as a lease of coastal lands to the south of it. The boundary of the North-Western Territory in this region, and likewise the Stickeen Territories created from it, south of and northwards from the Stikine, had been set as &quot;ten marine leagues&quot; from the sea, but this remained undefined until the Alaska Boundary Settlement of 1903. The North-Western Territory&#x27;s boundary with Russian America north of the 60th Parallel had been set at the 141st line of longitude by the Treaty of St. Petersburg in 1825.
The year following the creation of the Stickeen Territories, part of the Stikine returned to the North-Western Territory when boundaries were adjusted and the Colony of British Columbia was extended to the 60th parallel north, a measure which also brought into British Columbia its portion of the Peace River Block, which had not been part of the Stikine Territory. In 1868, shortly after Canadian Confederation, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company agreed to surrender its vast territories to the new dominion. However, it was not until July 15, 1870, that the transfer to Canada was made. 

On that date the North-Western Territory became part of the newly created Northwest Territories (often stylized as the North-West Territories). 

In 1880, the British Arctic Territories were claimed by Canada and later formed the Northwest Territories and Nunavut. 

In 1898 the Yukon Territory was formed when the areas west of the Mackenzie Mountains were removed from the Northwest Territories during the Klondike Gold Rush, again as with the Stickeen Territory to prevent efforts at American takeover and also to enable easier governance.

The North-West Territories Council was formed in 1870 and became active in 1872 when the Government of Canada appointed the first Council members.

The 1st North-West Territories Council was formed in 1876, and lasted until 1888. The 2nd Council lasted to 1891 when the NWT Legislative Assembly was formed.

<doc id="310845" wikidata="Q125074" url="?curid=310845" title="Anheuser-Busch">
<text>Anheuser-Busch Companies, LLC ( ) is an American brewing company headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri. Since 2008, it has been wholly owned by Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (AB InBev), now the world&#x27;s largest brewing company, which owns multiple global brands, notably Budweiser, Michelob, Stella Artois, and Beck&#x27;s.

The company employs over 19,000 people, operates 12 breweries and 9 aluminum can plants in the United States, and until December 2009, was one of the largest theme park operators in the United States, with ten theme parks through the company&#x27;s family entertainment division Busch Entertainment Corporation.

==History==

===Beginnings and national expansion===
In 1852, German American brewer and saloon operator George Schneider opened the Bavarian Brewery on Carondelet Avenue (later known as South Broadway) between Dorcas and Lynch streets in South St. Louis. Schneider&#x27;s Brewery expanded in 1856 to a new brewhouse near Eighth and Crittenden streets; however, the following year, financial problems forced the sale of the brewery to various owners during the late 1850s. In 1860, the brewery was purchased on the brink of bankruptcy by William D&#x27;Oench, a local pharmacist, and Eberhard Anheuser, a prosperous German-born soap manufacturer. D&#x27;Oench was the silent partner in the business until 1869 when he sold his half-interest in the company. From 1860 to 1875, the brewery was known as E. Anheuser &amp; Co., and from 1875 to 1879 as the E. Anheuser Company&#x27;s Brewing Association.

Adolphus Busch, a wholesaler who had immigrated to St. Louis from Germany in 1857, married Eberhard Anheuser&#x27;s daughter, Lilly, in 1861. Following his service in the American Civil War, Busch began working as a salesman for the Anheuser Brewery. Busch purchased D&#x27;Oench&#x27;s share of the company in 1869, and he assumed the role of company secretary from that time until the death of his father-in-law.
Adolphus Busch was the first American brewer to use pasteurization to keep beer fresh; the first to use mechanical refrigeration and refrigerated railroad cars, which he introduced in 1876; and the first to bottle beer extensively. By 1877, the company owned a fleet of 40 refrigerated railroad cars to transport beer. Expanding the company&#x27;s distribution range led to increased demand for Anheuser products, and the company substantially expanded its facilities in St. Louis during the 1870s. The expansions led production to increase from 31,500 barrels in 1875 to more than 200,000 in 1881.

To streamline the company&#x27;s refrigerator car operations and achieve vertical integration, Busch established the St. Louis Refrigerator Car Company in 1878, which was charged with building, selling, and leasing refrigerator cars; by 1883, the company owned 200 cars, and by 1888 it owned 850. To serve these cars and switch them in and out of their St. Louis brewery, Anheuser-Busch founded the Manufacturers Railway Company in 1887. The shortline operated until 2011, when Anheuser-Busch sought to shut down operations.

During the 1870s, Adolphus Busch toured Europe and studied the changes in brewing methods which were taking place at the time, particularly the success of pilsner beer, which included a popular Budweiser beer brewed in Budweis. In 1876, Busch took the already well-known name Budweiser and used it for his new beer, even though his product had no connections to the city of Budweis. His company&#x27;s ability to transport bottled beer made US Budweiser the first national beer brand in the United States, and it was marketed as a &quot;premium&quot; beer.

The company was renamed Anheuser-Busch Brewing Association in 1879; in 1880, Adolphus Busch became company president upon Anheuser&#x27;s death. The Busch family fully controlled the company through the generations until Anheuser-Busch&#x27;s sale to InBev in 2008.

During the 1880s and 1890s, Busch introduced a series of advertisements and marketing giveaways for the company, including bottle openers, calendars, corkscrews, pocketknives, postcards, and prints. Among the most well-known of these giveaways was &quot;Custer&#x27;s Last Fight&quot;, a lithograph print of a painting by St. Louis artist Cassilly Adams. As a marketing tactic, Busch distributed thousands of copies of the print to bars in 1896, the same year Anheuser-Busch introduced its new &quot;super-premium&quot; brand, Michelob. Eventually, more than one million copies of the print were produced, and it became &quot;one of the most popular pieces of artwork in American history.&quot;

At the turn of the 20th century, Anheuser-Busch continued to expand its production facilities to keep up with demand. In 1905, the company built a new stockhouse in St. Louis, and by 1907 it produced nearly 1.6 million barrels of beer. As demands for the prohibition of alcohol in the United States grew, Anheuser-Busch began producing non-alcoholic and low-alcoholic beverages (known as near beer); the most successful of these was Bevo, a malt beverage introduced in 1908. After the death of Adolphus Busch in 1913, control of the company passed to his son, August Anheuser Busch Sr., who continued to combat the rise of prohibitionists. As part of an effort to improve the respectability of drinking, August Busch built three upscale restaurants in St. Louis during the 1910s: the Stork Inn, the Gretchen Inn (now known as the Feasting Fox), and the Bevo Mill.

===Prohibition period===

As with all breweries in the country, the Temperance movement and eventual Prohibition in the United States dealt a major blow to the company in the 1910s through the 1930s. Some of the products sold by Anheuser-Busch to survive during Prohibition included brewer&#x27;s yeast, malt extract, ice cream, and Bevo, a nonalcoholic malt beverage, or &quot;near beer&quot;.

===Prohibition to last years of independence===
In 1957, Anheuser-Busch became the largest brewer in the United States.

In 1981, Anheuser-Busch International, Inc., was established as a subsidiary responsible for the company&#x27;s international operations and equity investments. Prior to its 2008 acquisition, Anheuser-Busch operated 15 breweries internationally: 14 in China and one in the United Kingdom.

In 1997, Chinese production of Anheuser-Busch products began after the company&#x27;s purchase of a local brewery; later, the company operated both Budweiser Wuhan International Brewing Company and Harbin Brewery, which Anheuser-Busch fully acquired in 2004. In the United Kingdom, the Budweiser Stag Brewing Company produced and packaged Budweiser at the Stag Brewery in Mortlake.

At one time, Anheuser-Busch International also held investments in Grupo Modelo in Mexico Tsingtao Brewery in China; Anheuser-Busch also held investments in Redhook Ale Brewery of Seattle, Washington and Widmer Brothers Brewery of Portland, Oregon. After the 2008 acquisition, most international operations were transferred to AB InBev zones where the interests are located.

===Acquisition by InBev===
On June 12, 2008, Belgian-Brazilian brewing company InBev announced that it had made a US$46 billion offer for the company, which if it was accepted would join two of the world&#x27;s four largest brewing companies (based on revenue) and create a company brewing three of the highest-grossing beers in the world, namely Bud Light, Budweiser, and Skol. InBev also stated that the merger would not result in any U.S. brewery closures and they would attempt to retain management and board members from both companies. On June 25, 2008, Anheuser-Busch officially announced that they would reject InBev&#x27;s offer and provide a restructuring of the company to maintain shareholders and United States World Headquarters in St. Louis. On July 1, 2008, InBev urged Anheuser-Busch shareholders to vote in favor of the buyout as InBev felt the offer of $65 per share should be considered a reasonable offer in view of the falling stock market. The company had previously filed suit in Delaware, after the rejection of their offer, to ensure that the stockholders could oust Anheuser-Busch&#x27;s 13 board members. On July 7, 2008, Anheuser-Busch filed a lawsuit against InBev to stop them from soliciting the support of shareholders, stating that the company&#x27;s offer is an illegal scheme. InBev was also accused of concealing that they do business in Cuba, which might have created additional obstacles to their efforts to operate in the United States.

On July 13, 2008, Anheuser-Busch and InBev said they had agreed to a deal, pending shareholder and regulatory approval, for InBev to purchase the American icon at $70 per share, creating a new company to be named Anheuser-Busch InBev. Anheuser-Busch would get two seats on the combined board of directors. The all-cash agreement, almost $52 billion in total equity, created the world&#x27;s largest brewer, uniting the maker of Budweiser and Michelob with the producer of Beck&#x27;s, Stella Artois, Hoegaarden, Leffe, Bass, Labatt and Brahma. The two companies had combined yearly sales of more than $36.4 billion, surpassing the current No. 1 brewer, London-based SABMiller.

Grupo Modelo took InBev to arbitration for more than a year and a half after the deal was completed, attempting to block the deal.

On October 7, 2009, parent company Anheuser-Busch InBev announced plans to sell the theme parks division to The Blackstone Group for up to .

In July 2010, a panel decided that the takeover did not violate Anheuser-Busch&#x27;s agreement with Modelo.

===Post-acquisition changes===
On November 18, 2008, the hostile takeover was completed, and the parent corporation was renamed Anheuser-Busch InBev; Anheuser-Busch became a wholly owned subsidiary of the new corporation, controlled within the North America zone unit of AB InBev. By early 2009, AB InBev &quot;turned a family-led company that spared little expense into one that is focused intently on cost-cutting and profit margins, while rethinking the way it sells beer.&quot; AB InBev focused on reducing costs in the Anheuser-Busch Companies subsidiary and implemented performance-related pay, along with several other changes. They immediately laid off 1,400 employees and 415 contractors, sold Busch Entertainment Corporation, and sold company-owned aircraft.

For employees, AB InBev ended perquisites such as executive assistants for senior management, company contributions to the salaried employee pension plan, and company-provided life insurance to retirees; it also reduced the number of company-provided cell phones, taking back 1200 Blackberries; and ended tuition reimbursement, and severance packages. Perks like free tickets to St. Louis Cardinals baseball games and for Busch Gardens were taken away from employees. Anheuser-Busch stopped providing free beer to its employees and visitors to its theme parks. These internal changes accompanied changes in its advertising. These cost-cutting measures rapidly reduced AB InBev&#x27;s debt from $56.6 billion in 2008 to $30.1 billion at the end of 2012. When the restructuring was complete, only three senior-level Anheuser-Busch managers remained.

InBev auctioned off several large assets in an effort to pay off debt to the banks that financed the merger. It sold Anheuser&#x27;s 27% stake in China&#x27;s Tsingtao, sold a few beverage can and lid-making plants to Ball Corporation, and sold its own Korean beer business for $1.8 billion to private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis and Roberts &amp; Co. It put the 10 theme parks in Anheuser&#x27;s Busch Entertainment Unit, which included its three SeaWorld locations, up for sale.

Under InBev, Anheuser-Busch also lengthened accounts payable terms, and introduced zero-based budgeting. These changes caused concern from its suppliers when Anheuser-Busch announced it would take 120 days to pay its bills rather than 30 days, taking time to use that money for other purposes. The new payment policy often results in longer periods than 120 days, since the 120 days starts from the end of the month in which the invoice is &#x27;approved&#x27; internally, which can be many days/months after an invoice is submitted.

InBev signed a 10-year lease on 31,500 square feet of office space on Park Avenue in New York, which led to speculation that they would move Anheuser-Busch InBev North American headquarters from St Louis.

In February 2013, a widely publicized lawsuit accused AB InBev of &quot;watering down&quot; products including Budweiser and Michelob. Such beers are intentionally brewed over-strength and then &quot;watered down&quot; to the intended level, creating a product of equal or greater quality. The lawsuit was dismissed.

Of Anheuser&#x27;s top executives, only three remained in their jobs following the acquisition: Dave Peacock as president of the merged company&#x27;s US division; Gary Rutledge as general counsel for the company&#x27;s North American business; and Bob Golden, Anheuser&#x27;s former acquisitions head, as global head of the merged company&#x27;s mergers and acquisitions effort.

==Operations and products==
Anheuser-Busch Companies operates as one of several subsidiaries in the North America zone unit of Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (AB InBev) and it produces and distributes hundreds of products from the AB InBev portfolio.

On October 10, 2016, a $100 billion merger between Anheuser-Busch InBev and SABMiller closed. The new company is trading as NewbelcoSABMiller.

===Corporate leadership===
Michel Doukeris is the current CEO of AB InBev, the parent company of the U.S. operation, and Brendan Whitworth is the current CEO of the Anheuser-Busch subsidiary.

Previous corporate leaders of Anheuser-Busch include:
* 1860–1880 Eberhard Anheuser
* 1880–1913 Adolphus Busch
* 1913–1934 August A. Busch Sr.
* 1934–1946 Adolphus Busch III
* 1946–1971 Gussie Busch
* 1971–1974 Richard A. Meyer
* 1974–2002 August A. Busch III
* 2002–2006 Patrick Stokes
* 2006–2008 August A. Busch IV
In 2008 Anheuser-Busch was acquired by InBev, and the combined company was renamed Anheuser-Busch InBev.
===Brewery operations===
Anheuser-Busch Companies has operated 13 breweries, all located in the United States:
*St. Louis, Missouri (opened 1852)
*Newark, New Jersey (opened 1951)
*Los Angeles, California (opened 1954)
*Tampa, Florida (opened 1959, now closed)
*Houston, Texas (opened 1966)
*Columbus, Ohio (opened 1968)
*Jacksonville, Florida (opened 1969)
*Merrimack, New Hampshire (opened 1970)
*Williamsburg, Virginia (opened 1972)
*Fairfield, California (opened 1976)
*Baldwinsville, New York (opened 1983)
*Fort Collins, Colorado (opened 1988)
*Cartersville, Georgia (opened 1993)

The St. Louis brewery, which opened in 1852, is a National Historic Landmark District, and includes three buildings listed as National Historic Landmarks. Public tours of the brewery are offered. The tour takes visitors through the complex where they can see beer being made and packaged in a working part of the brewery. The company keeps a rotation of its famous Budweiser Clydesdales at its headquarters, and visitors to the brewery can observe the clydesdales in their exercise field and see their places in the carriage house.

The brewery was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1966. The landmarked area includes 189 structures spread over , including many red brick Romanesque ones &quot;with square crenelated towers and elaborate details.&quot; The Brew House, built in 1891–1892, is particularly notable for its &quot;multi-storied hop chandeliers, intricate iron-work, and utilization of natural light&quot;.

===Other operations===
Aside from supply operations like brewing and packaging, Anheuser-Busch Companies includes Anheuser-Busch Wholesale Operations Divisions (WOD), Anheuser-Busch Agricultural Operations, Anheuser-Busch Recycling Corporation, Eagle Packaging, and Busch Properties, which manages subsidiary-owned property. Anheuser Busch owns and operates aluminum can plants (Metal Container Corporation). 
MCC supplies Anheuser Busch breweries and Pepsi Beverages Group fillers across the US. Suppliers to Anheuser-Busch Companies include Owens-Illinois, which provides glass bottles to several Anheuser-Busch breweries. Anheuser-Busch also owns glass production facilities, such as the former Longhorn Glass, which provides glass for the Houston brewery. Anheuser-Busch Companies delivers its products to retailers through a network of more than 500 independent wholesalers and 13 wholly owned distributors.

On February 20, 1953, Anheuser-Busch purchased the St. Louis Cardinals major league baseball club and owned them until March 21, 1996, when the club was sold to a group of private investors.

In 1966, Busch Memorial Stadium was paid for and built by the brewery and opened for business; Anheuser-Busch later purchased the stadium in 1981 for $53 million and removed the &quot;Memorial&quot; in its name. The stadium was demolished in late 2005 and replaced by a new ballpark in 2006. Anheuser-Busch signed an agreement to retain the &quot;Busch Stadium&quot; name on the new building through 2025.

Up until 2009, Anheuser-Busch was also one of the largest theme park owners/operators in the United States, with ten parks throughout the country through its entertainment division, Busch Entertainment Corporation, including its three SeaWorld locations. The company is now known as SeaWorld Parks &amp; Entertainment.

===Beverage products===

Anheuser-Busch Companies is responsible for the production, importation and distribution of several AB InBev products, including three company-designated global brands, Budweiser, Stella Artois, and Beck&#x27;s. Other multi-country brands distributed or produced by Anheuser-Busch Companies include Leffe and Hoegaarden, while local brands produced by the company include Bass Pale Ale, Bud Light, Busch Beer, Landshark Lager, Michelob, Michelob Ultra, Natural Light, and Shock Top. The company also produces nonalcoholic beverages, malt liquors (such as King Cobra and Hurricane), and flavored malt beverages (e.g. the Bacardi Silver family and Tequiza).

On December 22, 2015, it was announced that Anheuser-Busch would purchase Breckenridge Brewery for an undisclosed sum.

==Advertising==

Prior to its acquisition by InBev, the company was known in the United States for its advertising presence, including a sports marketing division which created advertising material for the Super Bowl and many other sporting events. Budweiser has sponsored horse racing events and motorsports including NASCAR, the &quot;Miss Budweiser&quot; racing hydroplane, and the &quot;Budweiser King&quot; championship top fuel dragster of Kenny Bernstein.

Since the acquisition by AB InBev, the company has significantly cut back its advertising, predicated on the belief that &quot;changing demographics and media habits no longer require spending as much on mainstream sports events&quot;.

==Controversies==

===Spykes underaged alcohol marketing===
In 2007, the company introduced a flavored 12% abv malt liquor under the name &quot;Spykes&quot;. It was sold in colorful, 2-ounce bottles. Available flavors included mango, lime, melon and chocolate. It was withdrawn in the same year after criticism from alcohol industry watchdog groups that it was being marketed to underage customers, and the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau found that the labeling of Spykes was illegal.

===Environmental record===
In 2002, the Political Economy Research Institute ranked Anheuser–Busch 40th among the &quot;Toxic 100&quot;, a list of U.S. corporations most responsible for air pollution. The study found that Anheuser–Busch released 1,002,786 kg (2,213,657 lbs) of toxic pollutants annually into the air. This is mainly because large amounts of CO2 are released during the process of fermentation.

Anheuser-Busch has received numerous awards for its efforts to reduce its impact on the environment. In 1995 Anheuser-Busch&#x27;s Baldwinsville brewery won an award for pollution prevention from the New York Governor for its use of a &quot;comprehensive, energy-producing pollution-prevention system – bioenergy recovery – to treat wastewater from the brewing process.&quot; The brewery also reduced solid waste by nearly 70 percent from 1990 to 1994. In addition, the Baldwinsville brewery found markets for previous &quot;waste&quot; materials used in the fermentation of Anheuser-Busch beers. The Anheuser-Busch Recycling Corp. recycled more than 27 billion cans in 2006, a number far greater than what was used in its own packaging. Similarly, Anheuser-Busch has set short-term goals to reduce energy consumption 5% and increasing use of renewable fuel from 8 to 15% by 2010. Along with these goals, Anheuser-Busch has succeeded in cutting down its water use by 3% since 2002. Its parent company Anheuser-Busch InBev has recently announced a commitment to secure 100% of the company&#x27;s purchased electricity from renewable sources by 2025.

The brewery also operates an environmental outreach program to encourage recycling, energy conservation, and habitat preservation, as well as to prevent littering and water pollution. For past 18 years Anheuser-Busch employees have participated in &quot;Green Week&quot;, which focuses on environmental conservation education for employees and their families.

Anheuser-Busch states they do not use animal-derived products, artificial ingredients, additives or preservatives at any stage of the brewing process or as part of the packaging in any of their range, with the exception of three Michelob products and two Bud Light products, which contain honey and shellfish respectively, and are marketed as such. All other Anheuser-Busch beers are brewed using water, yeast, barley malt, hops, and additional cereal grains. Anheuser-Busch eliminates the need for isinglass finings by settling and removing particles before fermentation. The beechwood aging process also helps to attract and remove yeast from the brew before the lagering process has ended. This only applies to the beers the company brews itself.

Anheuser-Busch became a pioneer for electricity-powered heavy trucks. It ordered hundreds of trucks from Nikola Motor, an Arizona company specialized in the development of hydrogen-fueled engines.

===Budweiser Bill===
In 2003, after numerous deaths in soccer stadiums, Brazil passed a law outlawing alcohol sales in stadiums. FIFA demanded that Brazil allow alcohol sales at the 2014 FIFA World Cup because Budweiser, a major World Cup sponsor is the &quot;Official Beer of the FIFA World Cup&quot;, a role it has played since 1986.

In response, Brazil passed a law paving the way for alcohol sales in the World Cup, nicknamed the &quot;Budweiser Bill&quot;.

===&quot;Up for Whatever&quot; beer campaign controversy===
In April 2015, Anheuser-Busch, in an effort to target new, younger consumers to buy its products, the company printed a slogan on Bud Light bottles that said &quot;The perfect beer for removing &#x27;no&#x27; from your vocabulary for the night. #UpForWhatever.&quot; The label triggered a backlash, and the company was immediately criticized by people who charged that it could be interpreted as promoting rape. Bud Light&#x27;s vice president Alexander Lambrecht addressed the situation via Twitter, first saying that the slogans were meant to promote brand engagement in a &quot;positive and lighthearted way&quot;, but that the company had &quot;missed the mark&quot; with their &quot;up for whatever&quot; slogan. He ended his message by saying that Bud Light would &quot;never condone disrespectful or irresponsible behavior&quot;. His message was followed by a Twitter response from Lisa Weser; the former head of communications and marketing for Anheuser-Busch InBev, who also responded to the situation via Twitter. Her response repeated Alexander Lambrecht&#x27;s concluding message.

===Liquor law violations in Seattle===
The Washington State Liquor and Cannabis Board (WSLCB) issued a $150,000 violation to Anheuser-Busch in May 2016. Investigators determined that Anheuser-Busch entered into an illegal agreement of exclusivity with two concert venues in Seattle – the Showbox and the Showbox SoDo.

===2017 Super Bowl advertising===
In early February 2017, Anheuser-Busch&#x27;s &quot;Budweiser – Born the Hard Way&quot; Super Bowl commercial was released online, prompting conservative political rebuke over its depiction of the immigration of founder Adolphus Busch from Germany to St. Louis. Although the ad had been conceived eight months before its release, some perceived the ad to be a political statement in opposition to then-current president Donald Trump. A week before the ad&#x27;s release, public controversy erupted over an executive order prohibiting entry of immigrants, refugees, and re-entry of permanent residents from seven countries into the United States. The script for the advertisement was finalized after the November elections, when Budweiser&#x27;s internal marketing team settled on the twelfth revision of the script. Shooting for the commercial then took place in January. The ad controversy followed after controversy in May 2016 when Trump, then a presidential candidate, was perceived by some to be hijacking Budweiser&#x27;s America branding campaign for his own political purposes.

===2019 Super Bowl advertising===
On March 21, 2019, Anheuser-Busch was sued for false advertising by rival MillerCoors over a Bud Light commercial that aired during Super Bowl LIII. The commercial claimed MillerCoors&#x27; Miller Lite and Coors Light products contain corn syrup, but the lawsuit argues that corn syrup is only used during the brewing process as a fermentation aid and neither beer contains corn syrup. The suit alleges that Anheuser-Busch is using &quot;false and misleading statements&quot; to confuse health-conscious consumers into thinking the beers contain high-fructose corn syrup, which has been linked with obesity. An Anheuser-Busch spokesperson called the lawsuit &quot;baseless&quot; and said it would not deter Bud Light from &quot;providing consumers with the transparency they demand.&quot; MillerCoors sought an injunction to prevent Bud Light from continuing the ad campaign, as well as a trial by jury and legal fees. Anheuser-Busch prevailed in the Seventh Circuit in 2020, with the court finding that since Miller included corn syrup on the ingredients list, Anheuser-Busch was within the bounds of the Lanham Act.

=== 2023 Bud Light boycott ===
On April 2, 2023, Anheuser-Busch&#x27;s brand Bud Light started facing a boycott, after partnering with transgender influencer and activist Dylan Mulvaney. Alissa Heinerscheid, the vice president of marketing behind the campaign, took a leave of absence on April 21, 2023. She was replaced by Budweiser Global Marketing VP Todd Allen.

On May 10, 2023, HSBC downgraded Anheuser-Busch InBev stock as it dealt with a &quot;Bud Light crisis&quot;. Analysts at HSBC cited &quot;deeper problems than ABI admits&quot; after the partnership with Mulvaney resulted in a wave of backlash and a boycott. The analyst cited a Beer Marketer&#x27;s Insights note that showed a steep drop in beer sales &quot;of maybe more than 25%&quot; in April.

On June 13, 2023, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that Bud Light lost the title as the top-selling U.S. beer, with Modelo Especial in May taking the top sales spot.

Yahoo! Finance, on July 10, 2023, reported a recent YouGov survey&#x27;s findings that Bud Light&#x27;s popularity among American beer brands dropped to the 14th position.

On July 26, 2023, the Wall Street Journal reported that Anheuser-Busch laid off hundreds of workers at its U.S. sales offices after months of slumping sales at Bud Light.

Anheuser-Busch reported in its second quarter earnings, on August 3, 2023, that its revenue in the United States fell more than 10 percent in the second quarter, versus the same period last year, “primarily due to the volume decline of Bud Light.” Operating profit at the U.S. unit dropped by nearly 30 percent.

On February 29, 2024, CNN Business reported, Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world&#x27;s largest brewer, experienced a significant financial hit, potentially losing up to $1.4 billion in sales. This loss was attributed to the controversy and subsequent boycott of Bud Light in the United States, following the sponsored Instagram post featuring the transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney, which notably impacted the company&#x27;s overall growth and beer sales volume in North America.

== Ties with Washington University in St. Louis ==
Adolphus Busch joined Washington University&#x27;s Board of Directors in 1895, back when the school was still located on its old downtown St. Louis campus. Adolphus would continue to serve on the board until his death in 1913, at which point his son, August Busch Sr. took over his seat. Though Adolphus Busch III and Gussie Busch never sat on the board, the ties between their company and the school were still strong. August Busch III, CEO of Anheuser-Busch from 1975 to 2002, would become a trustee of the university, a position he holds to this day. The Anheuser-Busch Foundation donation that gave its name to Anheuser-Busch Hall was made in honor of Fred L. Kuhlmann, an executive officer of both the company and the St. Louis Cardinals under August Busch III. Kuhlmann, who held these positions for most of the 1980s and early 1990s, graduated from WashU&#x27;s undergraduate and law programs. Though the Busch family no longer owns Anheuser-Busch, the connection between the company and the university is ongoing. Jack H. Purnell, former CEO of Anheuser-Busch, where he worked for 36 years, is an executive in residence of the Olin Business School.

<doc id="310847" wikidata="Q2547351" url="?curid=310847" title="Hrunting">
<text>Hrunting was a sword given to Beowulf by Unferth in the ancient Old English epic poem &quot;Beowulf&quot;. Beowulf used it in battle against Grendel&#x27;s mother.

Beowulf is described receiving the sword in lines 1455–1458:

&lt;poem&gt;And another item lent by Unferth
at that moment of need was of no small importance:
the brehon handed him a hilted weapon,
a rare and ancient sword named Hrunting.
The iron blade with its ill-boding patterns
had been tempered in blood. It had never failed
the hand of anyone who hefted it in battle,
anyone who had fought and faced the worst
in the gap of danger. This was not the first time
it had been called to perform heroic feats.&lt;/poem&gt;

However, although the sword possessed great power and was claimed to have never failed anyone who used it, when Beowulf descended to the bottom of the lake to fight Grendel&#x27;s mother, the sword proved ineffective. As the &quot;fabulous powers of that heirloom failed&quot;, Beowulf was forced to discard it.

==Hrunting&#x27;s significance==
Swords have great significance in the war-centred Anglo-Saxon culture from which &quot;Beowulf&quot; arises. Therefore, emphasis is strongly placed on the exchange of weapons of war. Weapons such as swords circulated through Anglo-Saxon society as inheritance through family, birthed through the monsters, found under magic rocks, and as rewards between lords and their subjects. Occasionally such exchange was also seen between warriors. One example of a weapon as a gift is seen in the exchange of Hrunting. As Unferth passes his sword to Beowulf, he admits the loss of his glory, and his submission to this greater warrior. However, when Hrunting fails Beowulf in his battle against Grendel&#x27;s mother, it possibly reflects its previous owner, Unferth, who failed to defeat the hated Grendel. In addition, Beowulf&#x27;s defeat of Grendel prompts the Danish king Hrothgar to bestow upon him many gifts consisting of weapons; this further emphasizes the importance of weaponry to such a society. Beowulf then passes on his rewards to his king Hygelac, thereby establishing his obligation to his king. Hrunting&#x27;s various meanings demonstrate that weapons of war can carry not only positive, but also negative, significance.

==Symbolism of Hrunting==
Unferth&#x27;s very act of giving Hrunting to Beowulf and the sword&#x27;s unexpected failure in the battle against Grendel&#x27;s mother bear much symbolism in the poem. Given that Unferth shows his dislike for Beowulf early in the story, Unferth&#x27;s choice to award Beowulf with Hrunting, which means &quot;hunting&quot;, can be interpreted as a sign of peace and acceptance. In this light, the giving of the sword seems to be an indication of Unferth&#x27;s recognition of Beowulf as a capable and powerful warrior. On the other hand, the poem portrays Unferth as a sly and treacherous man. Furthermore, scholars even propose that Hrunting is &quot;the very sword with which [Unferth] slew his own kin&quot;. It is possible then that Unferth&#x27;s motive in giving away his sword upon being confronted with the problem of Grendel&#x27;s mother could very well be to avoid going into battle. The passing of Hrunting from Unferth&#x27;s hand to Beowulf is therefore a reflection of Unferth&#x27;s treachery as he abandons his role as a warrior of Heorot. At first glance, Unferth&#x27;s sudden act of generosity towards Beowulf appears to have been done for noble reasons. However, what is known about Unferth and the sword&#x27;s inefficacy in battle strongly suggest that Unferth&#x27;s intentions are cowardly rather than noble – something reinforced by the similarly equivocal role played by the sword&#x27;s &quot;hafted&quot; counterpart in Grettis Saga.

==Hrunting&#x27;s failure==
The reason behind Hrunting&#x27;s failing against Grendel&#x27;s Mother has been a point of much scholarly debate. J.L. Rosier, in &quot;A Design for Treachery: The Unferth Intrigue&quot;, puts forth the contention that Unferth deliberately gave Beowulf a sword that he knew would fail, possibly for the purpose of preventing Beowulf from succeeding where Unferth himself failed. Yet this point has been contested by J.D.A Oglivy, who notes that the poem itself offers another explanation. First, Oglivy notes that if Unferth supplied an inferior weapon then it doesn&#x27;t follow for the poet to have gone into extensive detail about the magical infallibility of the sword. Further, as the sword that Beowulf ultimately finds and slays Grendel&#x27;s Mother with is noted to be made by giants, it implies that Grendel&#x27;s line possesses magical invulnerability that prevents weapons made by man from harming them. Moreover, where Heaney translation says, in line 1527, &quot;Here at last&quot;, other translations, such as those of David Wright, Michael Alexander, Constance B. Heatt, J.R.R. Tolkien, et al., rendered the phrase &quot;wæs forma sið&quot; – &quot;For the first time&quot; Hrunting failed to strike an effective blow; so that Unferth would not have expected it to fail.

Another explanation that has been put forth connects Hrunting&#x27;s failure to the broader underlying message of Christianity prevalent throughout the poem. Kent Gould, in his essay &quot;&quot;Beowulf&quot; and Folktale Morphology: God as Magical Donor&quot;, suggests that Hrunting fails because it was given to Beowulf by Unferth, a heathen. Only the more powerful replacement blade that God gives Beowulf is capable of destroying evil. According to Gould, &quot;the message would be clear enough to the poem&#x27;s Christian audience: only God can contribute enough power to overcome enemies to whom the poem has elsewhere given a Scriptural history&quot;. Grendel and Grendel&#x27;s mother have such a history, as Grendel&#x27;s lineage is described in lines 106–108 to have descended from Cain.

<doc id="310848" wikidata="Q851195" url="?curid=310848" title="Beurre blanc">
<text>Beurre blanc (; ) or Beurre Nantais () is a warm emulsified butter sauce made with a reduction of vinegar and/or white wine (normally Muscadet) and shallots into which softened whole butter is whisked in off the heat to prevent separation. The small amount of emulsifiers naturally found in butter, including a trace of lecithin, is used to form an oil-in-water emulsion. Although similar to hollandaise in concept, it is considered neither a classic leading nor compound sauce. This sauce originates in the cuisine of the Loire-Atlantique department.

== Origin ==

The chef Clémence Lefeuvre (née Clémence Prau) invented &quot;beurre blanc&quot;, apparently by accident, sometime around the beginning of the 20th century. She served this sauce at her restaurant &quot;La Buvette de la Marine&quot; in the hamlet of La Chebuette in the village of Saint-Julien-de-Concelles on the banks of the Loire River a few kilometers upstream from Nantes.

Legend holds that she intended to prepare a béarnaise sauce to go with pike but forgot to add the tarragon and egg yolks. Some sources claim that this invention occurred while she worked as a cook for the Marquis de Goulaine at Château de Goulaine. Aristide Briand, long-time prime minister of France and Nobel Peace Prize laureate, said at her death in 1932 that it &quot;was a bit like national mourning.&quot;

==Preparation==

A good &quot;beurre blanc&quot; is rich and buttery, with a neutral flavor that responds well to other seasonings and flavorings, thereby lending itself to the addition of herbs and spices. It should be light yet still liquid and thick enough to cling to food, also known as nappe.

&quot;Beurre blanc&quot; is prepared by reducing wine, vinegar, shallots, and herbs (if used) until it is nearly dry. Although not necessary, cream can be added at this point as a stabilizer to the sauce. Lemon juice is sometimes used in place of vinegar, and stock can also be added. Small cubes of cold butter are then gradually incorporated and as the butter melts the mixture is whisked.

The sauce can separate by either overheating or cooling. If it heats past , some emulsifying proteins begin to break down and release the butterfat they hold in an emulsion. The butterfat will solidify if the sauce cools below .

==Derivatives==
===&quot;Beurre rouge&quot;===
&quot;Beurre rouge&quot; (English: &quot;red butter&quot;) is a variant of the &quot;beurre blanc&quot; sauce that is prepared by substituting a dry red wine for the white wine and red wine vinegar for the white wine vinegar.

<text>John Joseph Welsh Sr (born 10 January 1984) is an English former professional footballer who played as midfielder.

Welsh notably played in the Premier League for Liverpool, where he began his career before playing for Hull City, Chester City, Carlisle United, Bury, Tranmere Rovers and Grimsby Town. In 2019 he dropped down to play at semi-professional level with Atherton Collieries before finishing his career with Stafford Rangers.

He was captain of the England under-20 team, and has been capped eight times for the under-21s. He represented England U20 at 2003 FIFA World Youth Championship.

==Career==
===Liverpool===
Wavertree born Welsh, joined Liverpool at the age of 10. He progressed through the ranks, becoming captain of the Reserve Team in the process. Welsh trained with the Liverpool first team squad at their Melwood training ground from the middle of the 2001–02 season.

In the 2002–03 season John Welsh played only one game for the first team – his début match against Ipswich Town on 4 December 2002 in a League Cup fourth round tie at home – when he replaced Vladimír Šmicer in the 83rd minute. Also, he was amongst the substitutes for a number of European games.

His first game in Premiership was against Arsenal on 4 October 2003, when he replaced Salif Diao in the 82nd minute, but he couldn&#x27;t help his team avoid defeat – they lost 2–1, and unfortunately for Welsh, his first act was to be booked for a foul on Ray Parlour. Welsh featured in Liverpool&#x27;s run to the 2005 UEFA Champions League Final, coming on as a substitute in the round of 16 away tie against Bayer Leverkusen. Liverpool would go on to win the trophy but Welsh was left out of the final match day squad.

===Hull City===
After three starts and seven substitute appearances in all competitions for Liverpool, in August 2005, John went on a season-long loan to Championship side Hull City. The club were impressed, and in November 2005 agreed a deal which saw Liverpool take promising young winger Paul Anderson in exchange. The swap took place on 4 January 2006.

However, three minutes into a match against Preston North End on 10 March 2007, Welsh dived into a tackle with Preston&#x27;s Neil Mellor, a former Liverpool teammate. Welsh was carried off on a stretcher, and it later transpired that he had broken both the tibia and fibula in his right leg, ruling him out for many months.

===Loans away from Hull===
On 31 December 2007, Chester City announced they would be signing Welsh on loan when the transfer window reopened the following day. He made his Chester debut on 1 January 2008, in a 2–0 home defeat to Grimsby Town, and spent the rest of the month in Chester&#x27;s starting line-up before returning to Hull.

He joined Carlisle United on 27 October 2008 for an initial one-month loan making his debut against Hartlepool United.

In March 2009, he joined Football League Two side Bury on loan and was released from Hull on 2 June 2009.

===Tranmere Rovers===
In July 2009, Welsh signed a deal with League One side Tranmere Rovers. He had a very consistent season for Tranmere, playing the holding midfield role successfully. Welsh also scored four goals in his first season at Prenton Park, including a volley in the 4–2 victory over Gillingham and a 25-yard strike in a 2–1 home victory over Brighton. The club offered him contract terms for the 2012–13 season.

===Preston North End===
In May 2012, it was announced that Welsh had signed for Preston North End on a two-year contract. He was voted Player of the Year and Players&#x27; Player of the Year of Preston North End for the season 2012/13. On 17 December 2013, Welsh extended his contract with Preston for a further twelve months, thus keeping him at the club until the summer of 2015.

Despite Tom Clarke taking over the captaincy for the 2014–15 season, Welsh still played a major part in getting the club promoted via the play-offs. This form was rewarded with a new two-year contract. At the end of the 2018 season he left Preston North End and was given an award for longest serving Preston player.

===Grimsby Town===
Welsh signed a two-year contract with League Two club Grimsby Town on 25 June 2018. He was firmly installed as club captain for the 2018–19 season. Welsh left the club by mutual consent on 20 March 2019. This may have been in part due to his participation in a fracas at a bus stop in which he broke a woman&#x27;s leg.

===Non-League===
In October 2019 he joined Atherton Collieries on a short-term contract. It was announced in August 2020 that he had signed for Stafford Rangers, on step 10 of the English football pyramid.

On 8 October 2021, Welsh announced he was leaving Stafford and subsequently retired in order to focus on other work commitments.

<doc id="310853" wikidata="Q848382" url="?curid=310853" title="Cementum">
<text>Cementum is a specialized calcified substance covering the root of a tooth. The cementum is the part of the periodontium that attaches the teeth to the alveolar bone by anchoring the periodontal ligament.

== Structure ==
The cells of cementum are the entrapped cementoblasts, the cementocytes. Each cementocyte lies in its , similar to the pattern noted in bone. These lacunae also have canaliculi or canals. Unlike those in bone, however, these canals in cementum do not contain nerves, nor do they radiate outward. Instead, the canals are oriented toward the periodontal ligament and contain cementocytic processes that exist to diffuse nutrients from the ligament because it is vascularized.

After the apposition of cementum in layers, the cementoblasts that do not become entrapped in cementum line up along the cemental surface along the length of the outer covering of the periodontal ligament. These cementoblasts can form subsequent layers of cementum if the tooth is injured.

Sharpey fibers are part of the principal collagenous fibers of the periodontal ligament embedded in the cementum and alveolar bone to attach the tooth to the alveolus.

If cementum can be observed on teeth, it can imply that the roots are exposed, showing that the clinical crown (the exposed part of the tooth) is bigger than the anatomical crown (the surface of the tooth covered by enamel). This is often due to gingival recession and may be an indication of periodontal disease.

===Cementoenamel junction===

The cementum joins the enamel to form the cementoenamel junction (CEJ), which is referred to as the &quot;cervical line&quot;.

Three possible types of transitional interfaces may be present at the CEJ. The traditional view was that certain interfaces dominated in certain oral cavities. The CEJ may exhibit all of these interfaces in an individual&#x27;s oral cavity, and there is even considerable variation when one tooth is traced circumferentially.

===Dentinocemental junction===
When the cementoid reaches the full thickness needed, the cementoid surrounding the cementocytes becomes mineralized, or matured, and is then considered cementum. The dentinocemental junction (DCJ) is formed because of the apposition of cementum over the dentin. This interface is not as defined, either clinically or histologically, as that of the dentinoenamel junction (DEJ), given that cementum and dentin are of common embryological background, unlike that of enamel and dentin.

The dentinocemental junction (DCJ) is a relatively smooth area in the permanent tooth, and attachment of cementum to the dentin is firm but not understood completely.

===Types===
The different categories of cementum are based on the presence or absence of cementocytes, as well as whether the collagen fibres are extrinsic or intrinsic. It is thought that fibroblasts, and some cementoblasts, secrete extrinsic fibres, but only cementoblasts secrete intrinsic fibres. The extrinsic fibres within acellular extrinsic fibre cementum, travel perpendicular to the surface of the root and allow the tooth to attach to the alveolar bone by the periodontal ligament (PDL), continuous with the cementodentinal junction (CDJ). Acellular cementum only contains extrinsic collagen fibres. Whereas, cellular cementum is quite thick and contains both extrinsic and intrinsic collagen fibres. The first cementum to be formed during tooth development is acellular extrinsic fibre cementum. The acellular layer of cementum is living tissue that does not incorporate cells into its structure and usually predominates on the coronal half of the root; cellular cementum occurs more frequently on the apical half. In summary, the main types of cementum are as follows: acellular afibrillar cementum (AAC), acellular extrinsic fibres cementum (AEFC), cellular intrinsic fibres cementum (CIFC) and mixed stratified cementum (MSC) which displays both cellular and acellular cementum.

Cellular cementum contains cells and is the medium of attachment of collagen fibres to the alveolar bone. It is also responsible for minor repair of any resorption by continued deposition to keep the attachment apparatus intact. Acellular cementum does not contain cells and has a main purpose of adaptive function.

===Composition===
Cementum is slightly softer than dentin and consists of about 45% to 50% inorganic material (hydroxylapatite) by weight and 50% to 55% organic matter and water by weight. The organic portion is composed primarily of collagen and proteoglycans. Cementum is avascular, receiving its nutrition through its own imbedded cells from the surrounding vascular periodontal ligament.

The cementum is light yellow and slightly lighter in color than dentin. It has the highest fluoride content of all mineralized tissue. Cementum also is permeable to a variety of materials. It is formed continuously throughout life because a new layer of cementum is deposited to keep the attachment intact as the superficial layer of cementum ages. Cementum on the root ends surrounds the apical foramen and may extend slightly onto the inner wall of the pulp canal.

===Development===

Cementum is secreted by cells called cementoblasts within the root of the tooth and is thickest at the root apex (the end of the root where the nerves and blood vessels enter the tooth). These cementoblasts develop from undifferentiated mesenchymal cells in the connective tissue of the dental follicle or sac. Cementoblasts produces cementum in a rhythmic manner on intervals indicating periods of activity and periods of rest, producing so-called incremental lines of Salter. Incremental lines of Salter are the only incremental lines in the tooth that are hypercalcified, because there is a much smaller organic portion (collagen fibers) than inorganic portion (hydroxyapatite crystals) of cementum, so when the cementoblasts rest they leave a space for the inorganic portion. Conversely, in enamel ameloblasts (incremental lines of Retzius) and dentin odontoblasts (incremental lines of von Ebner), the inorganic portion is much greater than the organic portion, so when ameloblasts and odontoblasts rest, they leave a space for the organic portion and become hypocalcified.

Unlike ameloblasts and odontoblasts, which leave no cellular bodies in their secreted products, during the later steps within the stage of , many of the cementoblasts become entrapped by the cementum they produce, becoming cementocytes. Thus again, cementum is more similar to alveolar bone, with its osteoblasts becoming entrapped osteocytes.

Cementum is capable of repairing itself to a limited degree, but cannot regenerate. It is not resorbed under normal conditions.

==Clinical significance==
* Some root resorption of the apical portion of the root may occur if orthodontic pressures are excessive and movement is too fast. Some experts also agree on a third type of cementum, afibrillar cementum, which sometimes extends onto the enamel of the tooth.
* The excessive buildup of cementum on the roots of a tooth is a pathological condition known as hypercementosis. Cementum thickness can increase on the root end to compensate for attritional wear of the occlusal/incisal surface and passive eruption of the tooth. 
* When cementum is exposed through gingival recession, it quickly undergoes abrasion by mechanical friction because of its low mineral content and thinness. The exposure of the deeper dentin can lead to problems such as extrinsic staining and dentinal hypersensitivity. 
* The incidence of cemental caries increases in older adults as gingival decline occurs from either trauma or periodontal illness. It is a chronic condition that forms a large, shallow lesion and slowly invades first the root&#x27;s cementum and then dentin to cause a chronic infection of the pulp. Because dental pain is a late finding, many lesions are not detected early, resulting in restorative obstacles and increased tooth loss. 
* Cementicles are small, spherical or ovoid calcified masses embedded within or attached to the cementum layer on the root surface of a tooth, or lying free within the periodontal ligament.
* Cemental spurs can be found at or near the CEJ. These are symmetrical spheres of cementum attached to the cemental root surface, similar to enamel pearls. Cemental spurs result from irregular deposition of cementum on the root. They can present some clinical problems in differentiation from calculus and may be noted on radiographs; yet, because they are hard dental tissue, they are not easily removed, and thus may also interfere with periodontal treatment.

===DNA studies===
A 2010 archeological study has found that cementum has five times the amount of mitochondrial DNA compared to dentin, which is commonly sampled. Teeth are increasingly utilized as a source of nuclear DNA to aid identification of human remains. DNA extraction and the results of genetic analysis from the tissue are extremely variable and to some extent unpredictable. However, the quantity of DNA available in dentin is affected by age and dental disease, whereas that in cementum is not.

<doc id="310855" wikidata="Q1262613" url="?curid=310855" title="Stardate">
<text>A stardate is a fictional system of time measurement developed for the television and film series &quot;Star Trek&quot;. In the series, use of this date system is commonly heard at the beginning of a voice-over log entry, such as &quot;Captain&#x27;s log, stardate 41153.7. Our destination is planet Deneb IV …&quot;. While the original method was inspired by the Modified Julian date system currently used by astronomers, the writers and producers have selected numbers using different methods over the years, some more arbitrary than others. This makes it impossible to convert all stardates into equivalent calendar dates, especially since stardates were originally intended to avoid specifying exactly when &quot;Star Trek&quot; takes place.

== Original stardate ==
The original 1967 &quot;Star Trek Guide&quot; (April 17, 1967, p. 25) instructed writers for the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; TV series on how to select stardates for their scripts. Writers could pick any combination of four numbers plus a decimal point, and aim for consistency within a single script, but not necessarily between different scripts. This was to &quot;avoid continually mentioning &quot;Star Trek&quot;&#x27;s century&quot; and avoid &quot;arguments about whether this or that would have developed by then&quot;. Though the guide sets the series &quot;about two hundred years from now&quot;, the few references within the show itself were contradictory, and later productions and reference materials eventually placed the series between the years 2265 and 2269. The second pilot begins on stardate 1312.4 and the last-produced episode on stardate 5928.5. Though the dating system was revised for &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, the pilot of &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot; follows the original series&#x27; dating system, starting on stardate 1207.3, which is stated precisely to be Sunday, May 11, 2256.

== Revised stardate ==
Subsequent &quot;Star Trek&quot; series followed a new numerical convention. &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; (&quot;TNG&quot;) revised the stardate system in the 1987 &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation Writer&#x27;s/Director&#x27;s Guide&quot;, to five digits and one decimal place. According to the guide, the first digit &quot;4&quot; should represent the 24th century, with the second digit representing the television season. The remaining digits can progress unevenly, with the decimal representing the time as fractional days. Stardates of &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; began with 46379.1, corresponding to the sixth season of &quot;TNG&quot; which was also set in the year 2369. &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; began with stardate 48315.6 (2371), one season after &quot;TNG&quot; had finished its seventh and final season. As in &quot;TNG&quot;, the second digit would increase by one every season, while the initial two digits eventually rolled over from 49 to 50, despite the year 2373 still being in the 24th century. &quot;Star Trek: Nemesis&quot; was set around stardate 56844.9. &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot; traveled to the year 3188, giving a stardate of 865211.3, corresponding to that year in this system of stardates.

On March 9, 2023, &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot; gave a stardate of 78183.10. This indicates a continuity with &quot;TNG&quot;. Each stardate increment represents one milliyear, with 78 years in 2401, counted from 2323. The decimal represents a fractional day. Thus, stardates are a composition of two types of decimal time. In the twenty-first century, this would indicate 78 years from 1945.

== Decimal point ==
Stardates usually are expressed with a single decimal digit, but sometimes with more than one. For instance, &quot;The Next Generation&quot; episode,&quot;The Child&quot;, displays the stardate 42073.1435. According to &quot;The Star Trek Guide&quot;, the official writers&#x27; guide for the original series:

:For example, 1313.5 is twelve o&#x27;clock noon of one day and 1314.5 would be noon of the next day. Each percentage point (sic) is roughly equivalent to one-tenth of one day.

Likewise, page 32 of the 1988 &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation Writer&#x27;s/Director&#x27;s Guide&quot; for season two states:

:…the digit following the decimal point counts one-tenth of a day.

This was demonstrated by the ship&#x27;s chronometer in the &quot;TOS-Remastered&quot; episode, &quot;The Naked Time,&quot; and by Captain Varley&#x27;s video logs in the &quot;TNG&quot; episode &quot;Contagion&quot;. The latter displays several stardates with two decimal digits next to corresponding times.

== Other stardates ==
Additional &quot;Star Trek&quot; media have generated their own numbering systems. The 2009 MMORPG &quot;Star Trek Online&quot; began on stardate 86088.58, in the in-game year 2409, counting 1000 stardates per year from May 25, 1922. Writer Roberto Orci revised the system for the 2009 film &quot;Star Trek&quot; so that the first four digits correspond to the year, while the remainder was intended to stand for the day of the year, in effect representing an ordinal date. In the first installment of the movie trilogy, Spock makes his log of the destruction of Vulcan on stardate 2258.42, or February 11, 2258. &quot;Star Trek Into Darkness&quot; begins on stardate 2259.55, or February 24, 2259. &quot;Star Trek Beyond&quot; begins on stardate 2263.02, or January 2, 2263. In &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot; episode, &quot;The Adhesive Duck Deficiency&quot;, Sheldon Cooper gives the stardate 63345.3, corresponding with the date of the Leonid meteor shower that year, November 17, 2009.

<doc id="310861" wikidata="Q1354071" url="?curid=310861" title="Paul Jennings Hill">
<text>Paul Jennings Hill (February 6, 1954 – September 3, 2003) was an American minister, religious extremist, and anti-abortion terrorist who murdered physician John Britton and Britton&#x27;s bodyguard, retired Air Force Lieutenant Colonel James Barrett, in 1994. Hill was sentenced to death by lethal injection and was executed on September 3, 2003.

==Early life==
Paul Hill was born in Miami, Florida, on February 6, 1954, to Oscar Jennings Hill, an airline pilot, and his wife Louise. He was raised in Coral Gables, Florida. At the age of 17, Hill was charged with the assault of his father when his parents attempted to get him treatment for his drug problem. Hill said he experienced a religious conversion two years later in 1973, after being sent to a military school. Hill later enrolled in Belhaven University, where he met his future wife, Karen Demuth, with whom he had three children.

==Early career==
Hill graduated from Reformed Theological Seminary, where he studied under Greg Bahnsen, a founder of the right-wing Christian Reconstructionist movement. He attended St. Paul Presbyterian Church, which espoused theonomy, a movement related to Reconstructionism. Following his ordination in 1984, Hill became a minister affiliated with both the Presbyterian Church in America and the Orthodox Presbyterian Church. He was excommunicated in 1993 following a number of nationally televised appearances in which he claimed to be the new national spokesperson for &quot;defensive action&quot; against abortion providers and claimed a connection to the Army of God.

==Crime, trial, and execution==
Prior to his excommunication, Hill looked towards other means to support his family, having seen his eight years in ministry as &quot;fruitless&quot;. After moving to Pensacola, Florida, he purchased a franchise for a mobile business that performed cleaning, trim repair, touch-up paint and pinstripe services for new and used car dealerships. This offered him flexible work hours in order to pursue his anti-abortion protest activities. However, Hill&#x27;s client base substantially dwindled as more of his radical views became public.

On July 29, 1994, Hill approached the Ladies Center, an abortion clinic in Pensacola. When he spotted clinic doctor John Britton and his bodyguard, retired USAF Lieutenant Colonel James H. Barrett, outside the clinic, he fired on both of them at close range with a Mossberg Model 500A 12-gauge pump-action shotgun. Both Britton and Barrett died; Barrett&#x27;s wife, June, was also wounded. Following the shots, Hill laid his shotgun on the ground and waited to be arrested.

Following his arrest, Hill was brought to trial in the Circuit Court of Florida for the First Circuit, charged with two counts of first-degree premeditated murder, one count of attempted first-degree murder, and one count of shooting into an occupied vehicle. Hill moved, successfully, to be allowed to appear &quot;pro se&quot;; i.e., he represented himself. He pleaded not guilty on all counts. Hill&#x27;s motion to use the affirmative defense of justification was denied. According to Hill, his actions were a defensive act, rather than a retribution. On December 6, 1994, Hill was found guilty of the charges and was sentenced to death. Appeals to the First District Court of Appeal, 656 So.2d 1271 (Fla. 1995), and subsequently to the Florida Supreme Court, 688 So.2d 901 (Fla.1996), were unsuccessful. Hill petitioned the Supreme Court of the United States for writ of &quot;certiorari&quot; (asking the Court to hear his appeal). The petition was denied. 522 U.S. 907 (1997). After losing his automatic appeals, Hill decided to waive the remainder of his appeals.

The execution warrant for Hill was not signed until July 2003, at which time it was signed by Governor Jeb Bush. Hill died by lethal injection in Florida State Prison on September 3, 2003, aged 49. His last words were, &quot;If you believe abortion is a lethal force, you should oppose the force and do what you have to do to stop it. May God help you to protect the unborn as you would want to be protected.&quot;

Hill chose Rev. Donald Spitz as his spiritual adviser during the last week of his life. Hill was close friends with Spitz both before and after he killed John Britton and James H. Barrett. Spitz was with Hill during the last week of his life and with Hill when he was executed.

==Motives and aftermath==
Prior to the murders, Hill sent two position papers to Reconstructionist author Gary North, which set out Hill&#x27;s views of abortion and why he considered murder of abortion care providers to be warranted. The papers were followed by three additional letters to North in October 1994. North&#x27;s responses, issued after the murders, comprised two letters that were made available to the public. The letters rejected and refuted Hill&#x27;s theological arguments, and concluded that, &quot;...the public will regard your dual assassination as the act of a condemned man outside of God&#x27;s church and acting on his own in defiance of Bible-revealed law and therefore also God&#x27;s moral law.&quot;

Hill spent almost a decade in prison awaiting his execution. In a statement made before his execution, Hill&#x27;s views on the murders remained unchanged; he said that he felt no remorse for his actions, and that he expected &quot;a great reward in Heaven&quot;. Hill left behind a manuscript manifesto which his backers promised him they would publish. Hill also encouraged others who believe abortion is an illegitimate use of lethal force to &quot;do what you have to do to stop it.&quot;

==In media==
While in police custody, Hill told the media &quot;Now is the time to defend the unborn as to defend a slave that&#x27;s about to be murdered.&quot; Hill&#x27;s purported ties to the Army of God movement as well as his life and crimes were explored in the 2000 feature-length HBO documentary &quot;Soldiers in the Army of God&quot;.

&quot;Lake of Fire&quot;, a 2006 documentary by Tony Kaye on the abortion controversy in the United States, features footage of Hill protesting outside abortion clinics in Florida, and shows footage of Hill&#x27;s arrest and trial. Hill also says to the filmmaker that &quot;whatever force is justified in defending the life of a born child is also justified in defending the life of an unborn child.&quot;

<doc id="310864" wikidata="Q6057225" url="?curid=310864" title="Intertwingularity">
<text>Intertwingularity is a term coined by Ted Nelson to express the complexity of interrelations in human knowledge.

Nelson wrote in &quot;Computer Lib/Dream Machines&quot; : &quot;EVERYTHING IS DEEPLY INTERTWINGLED. In an important sense there are no &quot;subjects&quot; at all; there is only all knowledge, since the cross-connections among the myriad topics of this world simply cannot be divided up neatly.&quot;

He added the following comment in the revised edition : &quot;Hierarchical and sequential structures, especially popular since Gutenberg, are usually forced and artificial. Intertwingularity is not generally acknowledged—people keep pretending they can make things hierarchical, categorizable and sequential when they can&#x27;t.&quot;

Intertwingularity is related to Nelson&#x27;s coined term hypertext, partially inspired by &quot;As We May Think&quot; (1945) by Vannevar Bush.

==Influence==
Peter Morville, an influential figure in information architecture, discusses intertwingularity in some of his books. In &quot;Ambient Findability: What We Find Changes Who We Become&quot; (2005), Morville uses the concept of intertwingularity to describe the experience of using hypertext on the web and starting to use computers embedded in everyday objects, known as ubiquitous computing. In 2014, he published a book called &quot;Intertwingled: Information Changes Everything&quot; about the intertwingularity of the universe, crediting Nelson with the word.

David Weinberger wrote about intertwingularity in &quot;Everything Is Miscellaneous: The Power of the New Digital Disorder&quot; in 2008, explaining that providing unique identifiers for items helps enable intertwingularity.

The concept of intertwingularity was celebrated at the &quot;Intertwingled: The Work and Influence of Ted Nelson&quot; conference on April 14, 2014, at Chapman University. The organizers published a book called &quot;Intertwingled: The Work and Influence of Ted Nelson&quot; in 2015, with articles about Nelson&#x27;s work and legacy. One of the organizers of the conference and editors of the book, Douglas Dechow, said, &quot;In the 1960s, he saw a world of networked, interlinked – intertwingled, if you will – documents where all of the world’s knowledge is able to interact and intermingle [...] He was the first, or among the first, people to have that idea.&quot;

<text>Fort Kent (French: &quot;Fort-Kent&quot;) is a town in Aroostook County, Maine, United States, situated at the confluence of the Fish River and the Saint John River, on the border with New Brunswick, Canada. The population was 4,067 in the 2020 census. Fort Kent is home to an Olympic biathlete training center, an annual CAN-AM dogsled race, and the Fort Kent Blockhouse, built in reaction to the Aroostook War and in modern times designated a national historic site. Principal industries include agriculture (particularly potatoes and forestry) and textiles. Fort Kent is the northern terminus of U.S. 1 and the ending point of the Northern Forest Canoe Trail.

==History==
Fort Kent was erected in the summer of 1839 as an American border outpost during the undeclared Aroostook War. The blockhouse, the first structure built in what is the present-day city of Fort Kent, was named after then-governor of Maine Edward Kent. The Saint John River was a log driving route from upstream forests to downstream sawmills and paper mills until the Bangor and Aroostook Railroad and trucks began transporting pulpwood.

===2008 flooding===
After receiving nearly of snow during the 2007–2008 winter season, the Saint John River began to flood on April 29. Nearly two days of nonstop rain also contributed to the flooding. As the river rose, it poured into the downtown area. More than 600 of Fort Kent&#x27;s 4,233 residents were evacuated. The river&#x27;s water level rose to nearly , which was above flood stage.

Governor John Baldacci declared a state of emergency for the region, flying from Augusta to see the damage first-hand. The Fish River did most of the damage, flooding St. Louis Catholic Church and an apartment building.

===Relationship with French Canada===
The town is economically and culturally linked to the Canadian towns of Clair and Saint-François-de-Madawaska, both in Madawaska County, New Brunswick, directly across the Saint John River. Most children on the Canadian side attend French-speaking school while their American counterparts are taught mainly in English.

Sixty-two percent of the residents of Fort Kent are regular speakers of French. The variety of French spoken in Fort Kent, and most of the Saint John River Valley, closely resembles the French spoken in Quebec and New Brunswick. It is referred to as New England French, &quot;Valley French&quot;, or &quot;Brayon&quot;. Many residents have American-Canadian dual citizenship.

==Arts and culture==
===International Muskie Derby===
Fort Kent is home to the International Muskie Fishing Derby. The Derby was started in 2003 to provide a platform to showcase the new fishery and continues today. It has brought attention to the new fishery and helped bring attention to national TV shows such as ESPN 2&#x27;s &quot;Beat Charlie Moore&quot;. This show and other future shows will help showcase the fishery to not only potential derby contestants but for a more secure and expanded tourist based fishery. The St John Watershed is a unique muskie habitat. Several factors make it acceptable and necessary to remove some fish from the ecosystem for the fishery to remain healthy.

===Ploye Festival===
Along with the Muskie Derby is the Fort Kent Ploye Festival, one of the featured events is the making of the world&#x27;s largest ploye. This event attracts hundreds of spectators, making it the highlight of the Ploye Festival. The massive ploye, which thus far, measures 12 feet in diameter, can only be accomplished with the help of friends and family of Bouchard Family Farm, producers of the ploye mix. It requires approximately fifteen bags of charcoal to ready the metal pan to the accurate temperature in order for the ploye to be cooked to perfection. It also needs about fifty pounds of ploye mix, much water (which is then mixed in five-gallon pails) and plenty of muscle to stir the mix. Five people are required to transport the mix from the pails to the awaiting pre-heated pan and also four people to spread the mix out as fast as possible. The thin batter cooks quickly, so time is of the essence. Once cooked, the enormous pan is then removed from the coals, and the ploye is taken off with huge spatulas. Pieces of the giant ploye are then plopped onto large trays and brought to nearby tables where they can be buttered with brushes, and distributed to the eagerly awaiting crowd.

===World Cup IBU===
The Fort Kent Outdoor Center (previously known as 10th Mountain) has hosted a multitude of World Cup biathlon events, including the largest events in 2004 and 2011, where racers from around the globe took part in various biathlon events in Fort Kent.

===Can Am Crown International Sled Dog Race===
The Can-Am Crown International Sled Dog Race was first held on Tuesday, February 16, 1993. Nine teams from Maine, Ontario, Quebec, and New Brunswick competed in that race. In 1994 sixteen teams competed in the 250-mile race and eleven in the newly introduced 60-mile race. In 1997 a 30-mile race was added to the itinerary. That same year, the first Saturday in March was established as the official start date for all three races. The race begins on Main Street in Fort Kent, sloping underneath the international bridge to Canada, then extending into the western parts of the Allagash wilderness, and finishes back in Fort Kent. Three races are part of the CAN-AM Crown, consisting of a 30-mile, 60 mile, and an Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race qualifying 250 mile race.

<text>In mathematics, a distributive lattice is a lattice in which the operations of join and meet distribute over each other. The prototypical examples of such structures are collections of sets for which the lattice operations can be given by set union and intersection. Indeed, these lattices of sets describe the scenery completely: every distributive lattice is—up to isomorphism—given as such a lattice of sets.

==Definition==
As in the case of arbitrary lattices, one can choose to consider a distributive lattice &quot;L&quot; either as a structure of order theory or of universal algebra. Both views and their mutual correspondence are discussed in the article on lattices. In the present situation, the algebraic description appears to be more convenient.

A lattice (&quot;L&quot;,∨,∧) is distributive if the following additional identity holds for all &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, and &quot;z&quot; in &quot;L&quot;:

: &quot;x&quot; ∧ (&quot;y&quot; ∨ &quot;z&quot;) = (&quot;x&quot; ∧ &quot;y&quot;) ∨ (&quot;x&quot; ∧ &quot;z&quot;).

Viewing lattices as partially ordered sets, this says that the meet operation preserves non-empty finite joins. It is a basic fact of lattice theory that the above condition is equivalent to its dual:

: &quot;x&quot; ∨ (&quot;y&quot; ∧ &quot;z&quot;) = (&quot;x&quot; ∨ &quot;y&quot;) ∧ (&quot;x&quot; ∨ &quot;z&quot;)   for all &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, and &quot;z&quot; in &quot;L&quot;.

In every lattice, if one defines the order relation &quot;p&quot;≤&quot;q&quot; as usual to mean &quot;p&quot;∧&quot;q&quot;=&quot;p&quot;, then the inequality &quot;x&quot; ∧ (&quot;y&quot; ∨ &quot;z&quot;) ≥ (&quot;x&quot; ∧ &quot;y&quot;) ∨ (&quot;x&quot; ∧ &quot;z&quot;) and its dual &quot;x&quot; ∨ (&quot;y&quot; ∧ &quot;z&quot;) ≤ (&quot;x&quot; ∨ &quot;y&quot;) ∧ (&quot;x&quot; ∨ &quot;z&quot;) are always true. A lattice is distributive if one of the converse inequalities holds, too.
More information on the relationship of this condition to other distributivity conditions of order theory can be found in the article Distributivity (order theory).

== Morphisms ==

A morphism of distributive lattices is just a lattice homomorphism as given in the article on lattices, i.e. a function that is compatible with the two lattice operations. Because such a morphism of lattices preserves the lattice structure, it will consequently also preserve the distributivity (and thus be a morphism of distributive lattices).

== Examples ==

Distributive lattices are ubiquitous but also rather specific structures. As already mentioned the main example for distributive lattices are lattices of sets, where join and meet are given by the usual set-theoretic operations. Further examples include:

* The Lindenbaum algebra of most logics that support conjunction and disjunction is a distributive lattice, i.e. &quot;and&quot; distributes over &quot;or&quot; and vice versa.
* Every Boolean algebra is a distributive lattice.
* Every Heyting algebra is a distributive lattice. Especially this includes all locales and hence all open set lattices of topological spaces. Also note that Heyting algebras can be viewed as Lindenbaum algebras of intuitionistic logic, which makes them a special case of the first example.
* Every totally ordered set is a distributive lattice with max as join and min as meet.
* The natural numbers form a (conditionally complete) distributive lattice by taking the greatest common divisor as meet and the least common multiple as join. This lattice also has a least element, namely 1, which therefore serves as the identity element for joins.
* Given a positive integer &quot;n&quot;, the set of all positive divisors of &quot;n&quot; forms a distributive lattice, again with the greatest common divisor as meet and the least common multiple as join. This is a Boolean algebra if and only if &quot;n&quot; is square-free.
* A lattice-ordered vector space is a distributive lattice.
*Young&#x27;s lattice given by the inclusion ordering of Young diagrams representing integer partitions is a distributive lattice.
* The points of a distributive polytope (a convex polytope closed under coordinatewise minimum and coordinatewise maximum operations), with these two operations as the join and meet operations of the lattice.

Early in the development of the lattice theory Charles S. Peirce believed that all lattices are distributive, that is, distributivity follows from the rest of the lattice axioms.
However, independence proofs were given by Schröder, Voigt,(de) Lüroth, Korselt, and Dedekind.

== Characteristic properties ==

Various equivalent formulations to the above definition exist. For example, &quot;L&quot; is distributive if and only if the following holds for all elements &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot; in &quot;L&quot;:
formula_1
Similarly, &quot;L&quot; is distributive if and only if

: formula_2 and formula_3 always imply formula_4
The simplest &quot;non-distributive&quot; lattices are &quot;M&quot;3, the &quot;diamond lattice&quot;, and &quot;N&quot;5, the &quot;pentagon lattice&quot;. A lattice is distributive if and only if none of its sublattices is isomorphic to &quot;M&quot;3 or &quot;N&quot;5; a sublattice is a subset that is closed under the meet and join operations of the original lattice. Note that this is not the same as being a subset that is a lattice under the original order (but possibly with different join and meet operations). Further characterizations derive from the representation theory in the next section.

An alternative way of stating the same fact is that every distributive lattice is a subdirect product of copies of the two-element chain, or that the only subdirectly irreducible member of the class of distributive lattices is the two-element chain. As a corollary, every Boolean lattice has this property as well.

Finally distributivity entails several other pleasant properties. For example, an element of a distributive lattice is meet-prime if and only if it is meet-irreducible, though the latter is in general a weaker property. By duality, the same is true for join-prime and join-irreducible elements. If a lattice is distributive, its covering relation forms a median graph.

Furthermore, every distributive lattice is also modular.

== Representation theory ==

The introduction already hinted at the most important characterization for distributive lattices: a lattice is distributive if and only if it is isomorphic to a lattice of sets (closed under set union and intersection). (The latter structure is sometimes called a ring of sets in this context.) That set union and intersection are indeed distributive in the above sense is an elementary fact. The other direction is less trivial, in that it requires the representation theorems stated below. The important insight from this characterization is that the identities (equations) that hold in all distributive lattices are exactly the ones that hold in all lattices of sets in the above sense.

Birkhoff&#x27;s representation theorem for distributive lattices states that every &quot;finite&quot; distributive lattice is isomorphic to the lattice of lower sets of the poset of its join-prime (equivalently: join-irreducible) elements. This establishes a bijection (up to isomorphism) between the class of all finite posets and the class of all finite distributive lattices. This bijection can be extended to a duality of categories between homomorphisms of finite distributive lattices and monotone functions of finite posets. Generalizing this result to infinite lattices, however, requires adding further structure.

Another early representation theorem is now known as Stone&#x27;s representation theorem for distributive lattices (the name honors Marshall Harvey Stone, who first proved it). It characterizes distributive lattices as the lattices of compact open sets of certain topological spaces. This result can be viewed both as a generalization of Stone&#x27;s famous representation theorem for Boolean algebras and as a specialization of the general setting of Stone duality.

A further important representation was established by Hilary Priestley in her representation theorem for distributive lattices. In this formulation, a distributive lattice is used to construct a topological space with an additional partial order on its points, yielding a (completely order-separated) &quot;ordered Stone space&quot; (or &quot;Priestley space&quot;). The original lattice is recovered as the collection of clopen lower sets of this space.

As a consequence of Stone&#x27;s and Priestley&#x27;s theorems, one easily sees that any distributive lattice is really isomorphic to a lattice of sets. However, the proofs of both statements require the Boolean prime ideal theorem, a weak form of the axiom of choice.

== Free distributive lattices ==
The free distributive lattice over a set of generators &quot;G&quot; can be constructed much more easily than a general free lattice. The first observation is that, using the laws of distributivity, every term formed by the binary operations formula_5 and formula_6 on a set of generators can be transformed into the following equivalent &quot;normal form&quot;:

:formula_7

where formula_8 are finite meets of elements of &quot;G&quot;. Moreover, since both meet and join are associative, commutative and idempotent, one can ignore duplicates and order, and represent a join of meets like the one above as a set of sets:

:formula_9

where the formula_10 are finite subsets of &quot;G&quot;. However, it is still possible that two such terms denote the same element of the distributive lattice. This occurs when there are indices &quot;j&quot; and &quot;k&quot; such that formula_11 is a subset of formula_12 In this case the meet of formula_13 will be below the meet of formula_14 and hence one can safely remove the &quot;redundant&quot; set formula_13 without changing the interpretation of the whole term. Consequently, a set of finite subsets of &quot;G&quot; will be called &quot;irredundant&quot; whenever all of its elements formula_10 are mutually incomparable (with respect to the subset ordering); that is, when it forms an antichain of finite sets.

Now the free distributive lattice over a set of generators &quot;G&quot; is defined on the set of all finite irredundant sets of finite subsets of &quot;G&quot;. The join of two finite irredundant sets is obtained from their union by removing all redundant sets. Likewise the meet of two sets &quot;S&quot; and &quot;T&quot; is the irredundant version of formula_17 The verification that this structure is a distributive lattice with the required universal property is routine.

The number of elements in free distributive lattices with &quot;n&quot; generators is given by the Dedekind numbers. These numbers grow rapidly, and are known only for &quot;n&quot; ≤ 9; they are
:2, 3, 6, 20, 168, 7581, 7828354, 2414682040998, 56130437228687557907788, 286386577668298411128469151667598498812366 .
The numbers above count the number of elements in free distributive lattices in which the lattice operations are joins and meets of finite sets of elements, including the empty set. If empty joins and empty meets are disallowed, the resulting free distributive lattices have two fewer elements; their numbers of elements form the sequence
:0, 1, 4, 18, 166, 7579, 7828352, 2414682040996, 56130437228687557907786, 286386577668298411128469151667598498812364 .

<doc id="310885" wikidata="Q2361385" url="?curid=310885" title="Dual (category theory)">
<text>In category theory, a branch of mathematics, duality is a correspondence between the properties of a category &quot;C&quot; and the dual properties of the opposite category &quot;C&quot;op. Given a statement regarding the category &quot;C&quot;, by interchanging the source and target of each morphism as well as interchanging the order of composing two morphisms, a corresponding dual statement is obtained regarding the opposite category &quot;C&quot;op. Duality, as such, is the assertion that truth is invariant under this operation on statements. In other words, if a statement is true about &quot;C&quot;, then its dual statement is true about &quot;C&quot;op. Also, if a statement is false about &quot;C&quot;, then its dual has to be false about &quot;C&quot;op.

Given a concrete category &quot;C&quot;, it is often the case that the opposite category &quot;C&quot;op per se is abstract. &quot;C&quot;op need not be a category that arises from mathematical practice. In this case, another category &quot;D&quot; is also termed to be in duality with &quot;C&quot; if &quot;D&quot; and &quot;C&quot;op are equivalent as categories.

In the case when &quot;C&quot; and its opposite &quot;C&quot;op are equivalent, such a category is self-dual.

==Formal definition==

We define the elementary language of category theory as the two-sorted first order language with objects and morphisms as distinct sorts, together with the relations of an object being the source or target of a morphism and a symbol for composing two morphisms.

Let σ be any statement in this language. We form the dual σop as follows: 
# Interchange each occurrence of &quot;source&quot; in σ with &quot;target&quot;.
# Interchange the order of composing morphisms. That is, replace each occurrence of formula_1 with formula_2
Informally, these conditions state that the dual of a statement is formed by reversing arrows and compositions.

&quot;Duality&quot; is the observation that σ is true for some category &quot;C&quot; if and only if σop is true for &quot;C&quot;op.

==Examples==

* A morphism formula_3 is a monomorphism if formula_4 implies formula_5. Performing the dual operation, we get the statement that formula_6 implies formula_7 For a morphism formula_8, this is precisely what it means for &quot;f&quot; to be an epimorphism. In short, the property of being a monomorphism is dual to the property of being an epimorphism.

Applying duality, this means that a morphism in some category &quot;C&quot; is a monomorphism if and only if the reverse morphism in the opposite category &quot;C&quot;op is an epimorphism.

* An example comes from reversing the direction of inequalities in a partial order. So if &quot;X&quot; is a set and ≤ a partial order relation, we can define a new partial order relation ≤new by

:: &quot;x&quot; ≤new &quot;y&quot; if and only if &quot;y&quot; ≤ &quot;x&quot;.

This example on orders is a special case, since partial orders correspond to a certain kind of category in which Hom(&quot;A&quot;,&quot;B&quot;) can have at most one element. In applications to logic, this then looks like a very general description of negation (that is, proofs run in the opposite direction). For example, if we take the opposite of a lattice, we will find that &quot;meets&quot; and &quot;joins&quot; have their roles interchanged. This is an abstract form of De Morgan&#x27;s laws, or of duality applied to lattices.

* Limits and colimits are dual notions.
* Fibrations and cofibrations are examples of dual notions in algebraic topology and homotopy theory. In this context, the duality is often called Eckmann–Hilton duality.

<text>In mathematics, coalgebras or co-gebras are structures that are dual (in the category-theoretic sense of reversing arrows) to unital associative algebras. The axioms of unital associative algebras can be formulated in terms of commutative diagrams. Turning all arrows around, one obtains the axioms of coalgebras.
Every coalgebra, by (vector space) duality, give rise to an algebra, but not in general the other way. In finite dimensions, this duality goes in both directions (see below).

Coalgebras occur naturally in a number of contexts (for example, representation theory, universal enveloping algebras and group schemes).

There are also [[F-coalgebra]]s, with important applications in computer science.

== Informal discussion ==
One frequently recurring example of coalgebras occurs in representation theory, and in particular, in the representation theory of the rotation group. A primary task, of practical use in physics, is to obtain combinations of systems with different states of angular momentum and spin. For this purpose, one uses the Clebsch–Gordan coefficients. Given two systems formula_1 with angular momenta formula_2 and formula_3, a particularly important task is to find the total angular momentum formula_4 given the combined state formula_5. This is provided by the total angular momentum operator, which extracts the needed quantity from each side of the tensor product. It can be written as an &quot;external&quot; tensor product

:formula_6

The word &quot;external&quot; appears here, in contrast to the &quot;internal&quot; tensor product of a tensor algebra. A tensor algebra comes with a tensor product (the internal one); it can also be equipped with a second tensor product, the &quot;external&quot; one, or the coproduct, having the form above. That they are two different products is emphasized by recalling that the internal tensor product of a vector and a scalar is just simple scalar multiplication. The external product keeps them separated. In this setting, the coproduct is the map
:formula_7
that takes
:formula_8
For this example, formula_9 can be taken to be one of the spin representations of the rotation group, with the fundamental representation being the common-sense choice. This coproduct can be lifted to all of the tensor algebra, by a simple lemma that applies to free objects: the tensor algebra is a free algebra, therefore, any homomorphism defined on a subset can be extended to the entire algebra. Examining the lifting in detail, one observes that the coproduct behaves as the shuffle product, essentially because the two factors above, the left and right formula_10 must be kept in sequential order during products of multiple angular momenta (rotations are not commutative).

The peculiar form of having the formula_10 appear only once in the coproduct, rather than (for example) defining formula_12 is in order to maintain linearity: for this example, (and for representation theory in general), the coproduct &quot;must&quot; be linear. As a general rule, the coproduct in representation theory is reducible; the factors are given by the Littlewood–Richardson rule. (The Littlewood–Richardson rule conveys the same idea as the Clebsch–Gordan coefficients, but in a more general setting).

The formal definition of the coalgebra, below, abstracts away this particular special case, and its requisite properties, into a general setting.

== Formal definition ==
Formally, a coalgebra over a field &quot;K&quot; is a vector space &quot;C&quot; over &quot;K&quot; together with &quot;K&quot;-linear maps Δ: &quot;C&quot; → &quot;C&quot; ⊗ &quot;C&quot; and ε: &quot;C&quot; → &quot;K&quot; such that

# formula_13
# formula_14.

(Here ⊗ refers to the tensor product over &quot;K&quot; and id is the identity function.)

Equivalently, the following two diagrams commute:
In the first diagram, &quot;C&quot; ⊗ (&quot;C&quot; ⊗ &quot;C&quot;) is identified with (&quot;C&quot; ⊗ &quot;C&quot;) ⊗ &quot;C&quot;; the two are naturally isomorphic. Similarly, in the second diagram the naturally isomorphic spaces &quot;C&quot;, &quot;C&quot; ⊗ &quot;K&quot; and &quot;K&quot; ⊗ &quot;C&quot; are identified.

The first diagram is the dual of the one expressing associativity of algebra multiplication (called the coassociativity of the comultiplication); the second diagram is the dual of the one expressing the existence of a multiplicative identity. Accordingly, the map Δ is called the comultiplication (or coproduct) of &quot;C&quot; and ε is the of &quot;C&quot;.

== Examples ==
Take an arbitrary set &quot;S&quot; and form the &quot;K&quot;-vector space &quot;C&quot; = &quot;K&quot;(&quot;S&quot;) with basis &quot;S&quot;, as follows. The elements of this vector space &quot;C&quot; are those functions from &quot;S&quot; to &quot;K&quot; that map all but finitely many elements of &quot;S&quot; to zero; identify the element &quot;s&quot; of &quot;S&quot; with the function that maps &quot;s&quot; to 1 and all other elements of &quot;S&quot; to 0. Define 
:Δ(&quot;s&quot;) = &quot;s&quot; ⊗ &quot;s&quot; and ε(&quot;s&quot;) = 1 for all &quot;s&quot; in &quot;S&quot;.
By linearity, both Δ and ε can then uniquely be extended to all of &quot;C&quot;. The vector space &quot;C&quot; becomes a coalgebra with comultiplication Δ and counit ε.

As a second example, consider the polynomial ring &quot;K&quot;[&quot;X&quot;] in one indeterminate &quot;X&quot;. This becomes a coalgebra (the divided power coalgebra) if for all &quot;n&quot; ≥ 0 one defines: 
:formula_15
:formula_16
Again, because of linearity, this suffices to define Δ and ε uniquely on all of &quot;K&quot;[&quot;X&quot;]. Now &quot;K&quot;[&quot;X&quot;] is both a unital associative algebra and a coalgebra, and the two structures are compatible. Objects like this are called bialgebras, and in fact most of the important coalgebras considered in practice are bialgebras.

Examples of coalgebras include the tensor algebra, the exterior algebra, Hopf algebras and Lie bialgebras. Unlike the polynomial case above, none of these are commutative. Therefore, the coproduct becomes the shuffle product, rather than the divided power structure given above. The shuffle product is appropriate, because it preserves the order of the terms appearing in the product, as is needed by non-commutative algebras.

The singular homology of a topological space forms a graded coalgebra whenever the Künneth isomorphism holds, e.g. if the coefficients are taken to be a field.

If &quot;C&quot; is the &quot;K&quot;-vector space with basis {&quot;s&quot;, &quot;c&quot;}, consider Δ: &quot;C&quot; → &quot;C&quot; ⊗ &quot;C&quot; is given by
:Δ(&quot;s&quot;) = &quot;s&quot; ⊗ &quot;c&quot; + &quot;c&quot; ⊗ &quot;s&quot;
:Δ(&quot;c&quot;) = &quot;c&quot; ⊗ &quot;c&quot; − &quot;s&quot; ⊗ &quot;s&quot;
and ε: &quot;C&quot; → &quot;K&quot; is given by
:ε(&quot;s&quot;) = 0
:ε(&quot;c&quot;) = 1
In this situation, (&quot;C&quot;, Δ, ε) is a coalgebra known as trigonometric coalgebra.

For a locally finite poset &quot;P&quot; with set of intervals &quot;J&quot;, define the incidence coalgebra &quot;C&quot; with &quot;J&quot; as basis. The comultiplication and counit are defined as

:formula_17

:formula_18

The intervals of length zero correspond to points of &quot;P&quot; and are group-like elements.

== Finite dimensions ==
In finite dimensions, the duality between algebras and coalgebras is closer: the dual of a finite-dimensional (unital associative) algebra is a coalgebra, while the dual of a finite-dimensional coalgebra is a (unital associative) algebra. In general, the dual of an algebra may not be a coalgebra.

The key point is that in finite dimensions, and are isomorphic.

To distinguish these: in general, algebra and coalgebra are dual &quot;notions&quot; (meaning that their axioms are dual: reverse the arrows), while for finite dimensions, they are also dual &quot;objects&quot; (meaning that a coalgebra is the dual object of an algebra and conversely).

If &quot;A&quot; is a &quot;finite-dimensional&quot; unital associative &quot;K&quot;-algebra, then its &quot;K&quot;-dual &quot;A&quot;∗ consisting of all &quot;K&quot;-linear maps from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;K&quot; is a coalgebra. The multiplication of &quot;A&quot; can be viewed as a linear map , which when dualized yields a linear map . In the finite-dimensional case, is naturally isomorphic to , so this defines a comultiplication on &quot;A&quot;∗. The counit of &quot;A&quot;∗ is given by evaluating linear functionals at 1.

== Sweedler notation ==
When working with coalgebras, a certain notation for the comultiplication simplifies the formulas considerably and has become quite popular. Given an element &quot;c&quot; of the coalgebra (&quot;C&quot;, Δ, ε), there exist elements &quot;c&quot; and &quot;c&quot; in &quot;C&quot; such that 
:formula_19
Note that neither the number of terms in this sum, nor the exact values of each formula_20 or formula_21, are uniquely determined by formula_22; there is only a promise that there are finitely many terms, and that the full sum of all these terms formula_23 have the right value formula_24.

In &quot;Sweedler&#x27;s notation&quot;, (so named after Moss Sweedler), this is abbreviated to
:formula_25

The fact that ε is a counit can then be expressed with the following formula
:formula_26
Here it is understood that the sums have the same number of terms, and the same lists of values for formula_27 and formula_28, as in the previous sum for formula_24.

The coassociativity of Δ can be expressed as 
:formula_30
In Sweedler&#x27;s notation, both of these expressions are written as
:formula_31

Some authors omit the summation symbols as well; in this sumless Sweedler notation, one writes
:formula_32
and
:formula_33
Whenever a variable with lowered and parenthesized index is encountered in an expression of this kind, a summation symbol for that variable is implied.

== Further concepts and facts ==
A coalgebra is called co-commutative if formula_34, where is the &quot;K&quot;-linear map defined by for all &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot; in &quot;C&quot;. In Sweedler&#x27;s sumless notation, &quot;C&quot; is co-commutative if and only if
:formula_35
for all &quot;c&quot; in &quot;C&quot;. (It&#x27;s important to understand that the implied summation is significant here: it is not required that all the summands are pairwise equal, only that the sums are equal, a much weaker requirement.)

A group-like element (or set-like element) is an element &quot;x&quot; such that and . Contrary to what this naming convention suggests the group-like elements do not always form a group and in general they only form a set. The group-like elements of a Hopf algebra do form a group. A primitive element is an element &quot;x&quot; that satisfies . The primitive elements of a Hopf algebra form a Lie algebra.

If and are two coalgebras over the same field &quot;K&quot;, then a coalgebra morphism from &quot;C&quot;1 to &quot;C&quot;2 is a &quot;K&quot;-linear map such that formula_36 and formula_37.
In Sweedler&#x27;s sumless notation, the first of these properties may be written as:
:formula_38

The composition of two coalgebra morphisms is again a coalgebra morphism, and the coalgebras over &quot;K&quot; together with this notion of morphism form a category.

A linear subspace &quot;I&quot; in &quot;C&quot; is called a coideal if and . In that case, the quotient space &quot;C&quot;/&quot;I&quot; becomes a coalgebra in a natural fashion.

A subspace &quot;D&quot; of &quot;C&quot; is called a subcoalgebra if ; in that case, &quot;D&quot; is itself a coalgebra, with the restriction of ε to &quot;D&quot; as counit.

The kernel of every coalgebra morphism is a coideal in &quot;C&quot;1, and the image is a subcoalgebra of &quot;C&quot;2. The common isomorphism theorems are valid for coalgebras, so for instance &quot;C&quot;1/ker(&quot;f&quot;) is isomorphic to im(&quot;f&quot;).

If &quot;A&quot; is a finite-dimensional unital associative &quot;K&quot;-algebra, then &quot;A&quot;∗ is a finite-dimensional coalgebra, and indeed every finite-dimensional coalgebra arises in this fashion from some finite-dimensional algebra (namely from the coalgebra&#x27;s &quot;K&quot;-dual). Under this correspondence, the commutative finite-dimensional algebras correspond to the cocommutative finite-dimensional coalgebras. So in the finite-dimensional case, the theories of algebras and of coalgebras are dual; studying one is equivalent to studying the other. However, relations diverge in the infinite-dimensional case: while the &quot;K&quot;-dual of every coalgebra is an algebra, the &quot;K&quot;-dual of an infinite-dimensional algebra need not be a coalgebra.

Every coalgebra is the sum of its finite-dimensional subcoalgebras, something that is not true for algebras. Abstractly, coalgebras are generalizations, or duals, of finite-dimensional unital associative algebras.

Corresponding to the concept of representation for algebras is a corepresentation or comodule.

Specifically, the comultiplication and the counit are both unital algebra homomorphisms, or equivalently, the multiplication and the unit of the algebra both are coalgebra morphisms. (These statements are equivalent since they are expressed by the same commutative diagrams.)

Similar bialgebras are related by bialgebra homomorphisms. A bialgebra homomorphism is a linear map that is both an algebra and a coalgebra homomorphism.

As reflected in the symmetry of the commutative diagrams, the definition of bialgebra is self-dual, so if one can define a dual of &quot;B&quot; (which is always possible if &quot;B&quot; is finite-dimensional), then it is automatically a bialgebra.

== Formal definition ==

(&quot;B&quot;, ∇, η, Δ, ε) is a bialgebra over &quot;K&quot; if it has the following properties: 
* &quot;B&quot; is a vector space over &quot;K&quot;;
* there are &quot;K&quot;-linear maps (multiplication) ∇: &quot;B&quot; ⊗ &quot;B&quot; → &quot;B&quot; (equivalent to &quot;K&quot;-multilinear map ∇: &quot;B&quot; × &quot;B&quot; → &quot;B&quot;) and (unit) η: &quot;K&quot; → &quot;B&quot;, such that (&quot;B&quot;, ∇, η) is a unital associative algebra;
* there are &quot;K&quot;-linear maps (comultiplication) Δ: &quot;B&quot; → &quot;B&quot; ⊗ &quot;B&quot; and (counit) ε: &quot;B&quot; → &quot;K&quot;, such that (&quot;B&quot;, Δ, ε) is a (counital coassociative) coalgebra;
* compatibility conditions expressed by the following commutative diagrams:

# Multiplication ∇ and comultiplication Δ
#: where τ: &quot;B&quot; ⊗ &quot;B&quot; → &quot;B&quot; ⊗ &quot;B&quot; is the linear map defined by τ(&quot;x&quot; ⊗ &quot;y&quot;) = &quot;y&quot; ⊗ &quot;x&quot; for all &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; in &quot;B&quot;,
# Multiplication ∇ and counit ε
# Comultiplication Δ and unit η
# Unit η and counit ε

==Coassociativity and counit==
The &quot;K&quot;-linear map Δ: &quot;B&quot; → &quot;B&quot; ⊗ &quot;B&quot; is coassociative if formula_1.

The &quot;K&quot;-linear map ε: &quot;B&quot; → &quot;K&quot; is a counit if formula_2.

Coassociativity and counit are expressed by the commutativity of the following two diagrams (they are the duals of the diagrams expressing associativity and unit of an algebra):

== Compatibility conditions ==
The four commutative diagrams can be read either as &quot;comultiplication and counit are homomorphisms of algebras&quot; or, equivalently, &quot;multiplication and unit are homomorphisms of coalgebras&quot;.

These statements are meaningful once we explain the natural structures of algebra and coalgebra in all the vector spaces involved besides &quot;B&quot;: (&quot;K&quot;, ∇0, η0) is a unital associative algebra in an obvious way and (&quot;B&quot; ⊗ &quot;B&quot;, ∇2, η2) is a unital associative algebra with unit and multiplication

:formula_3
:formula_4,

so that formula_5 or, omitting ∇ and writing multiplication as juxtaposition, formula_6;

similarly, (&quot;K&quot;, Δ0, ε0) is a coalgebra in an obvious way and &quot;B&quot; ⊗ &quot;B&quot; is a coalgebra with counit and comultiplication

:formula_7
:formula_8.

Then, diagrams 1 and 3 say that Δ: &quot;B&quot; → &quot;B&quot; ⊗ &quot;B&quot; is a homomorphism of unital (associative) algebras (&quot;B&quot;, ∇, η) and (&quot;B&quot; ⊗ &quot;B&quot;, ∇2, η2)

:formula_9, or simply Δ(&quot;xy&quot;) = Δ(&quot;x&quot;) Δ(&quot;y&quot;),
:formula_10, or simply Δ(1&quot;B&quot;) = 1&quot;B&quot; ⊗ &quot;B&quot;;

diagrams 2 and 4 say that ε: &quot;B&quot; → &quot;K&quot; is a homomorphism of unital (associative) algebras (&quot;B&quot;, ∇, η) and (&quot;K&quot;, ∇0, η0):

:formula_11, or simply ε(&quot;xy&quot;) = ε(&quot;x&quot;) ε(&quot;y&quot;)
:formula_12, or simply ε(1&quot;B&quot;) = 1&quot;K&quot;.

Equivalently, diagrams 1 and 2 say that ∇: &quot;B&quot; ⊗ &quot;B&quot; → &quot;B&quot; is a homomorphism of (counital coassociative) coalgebras (&quot;B&quot; ⊗ &quot;B&quot;, Δ2, ε2) and (&quot;B&quot;, Δ, ε):

:formula_13
:formula_14;

diagrams 3 and 4 say that η: &quot;K&quot; → &quot;B&quot; is a homomorphism of (counital coassociative) coalgebras (&quot;K&quot;, Δ0, ε0) and (&quot;B&quot;, Δ, ε):

:formula_15
:formula_16,
where 
:formula_17.

==Examples==
===Group bialgebra===
An example of a bialgebra is the set of functions from a finite group &quot;G&quot; (or more generally, any finite monoid) to formula_18, which we may represent as a vector space formula_19 consisting of linear combinations of standard basis vectors e&quot;g&quot; for each &quot;g&quot; ∈ &quot;G&quot;, which may represent a probability distribution over &quot;G&quot; in the case of vectors whose coefficients are all non-negative and sum to 1. An example of suitable comultiplication operators and counits which yield a counital coalgebra are
:formula_20
which represents making a copy of a random variable (which we extend to all formula_19 by linearity), and
:formula_22
(again extended linearly to all of formula_23) which represents &quot;tracing out&quot; a random variable — &quot;i.e.,&quot; forgetting the value of a random variable (represented by a single tensor factor) to obtain a marginal distribution on the remaining variables (the remaining tensor factors). 
Given the interpretation of (Δ,ε) in terms of probability distributions as above, the bialgebra consistency conditions amount to constraints on (∇,η) as follows:

# η is an operator preparing a normalized probability distribution which is independent of all other random variables;
# The product ∇ maps a probability distribution on two variables to a probability distribution on one variable;
# Copying a random variable in the distribution given by η is equivalent to having two independent random variables in the distribution η;
# Taking the product of two random variables, and preparing a copy of the resulting random variable, has the same distribution as preparing copies of each random variable independently of one another, and multiplying them together in pairs.

A pair (∇,η) which satisfy these constraints are the convolution operator
:formula_24
again extended to all formula_25 by linearity; this produces a normalized probability distribution from a distribution on two random variables, and has as a unit the delta-distribution formula_26 where &quot;i&quot; ∈ &quot;G&quot; denotes the identity element of the group &quot;G&quot;.

=== Other examples ===
Other examples of bialgebras include the tensor algebra, which can be made into a bialgebra by adding the appropriate comultiplication and counit; these are worked out in detail in that article.

Bialgebras can often be extended to Hopf algebras, if an appropriate antipode can be found; thus, all Hopf algebras are examples of bialgebras. Similar structures with different compatibility between the product and comultiplication, or different types of multiplication and comultiplication, include Lie bialgebras and Frobenius algebras. Additional examples are given in the article on coalgebras.

<text>In category theory, the coproduct, or categorical sum, is a construction which includes as examples the disjoint union of sets and of topological spaces, the free product of groups, and the direct sum of modules and vector spaces. The coproduct of a family of objects is essentially the &quot;least specific&quot; object to which each object in the family admits a morphism. It is the category-theoretic dual notion to the categorical product, which means the definition is the same as the product but with all arrows reversed. Despite this seemingly innocuous change in the name and notation, coproducts can be and typically are dramatically different from products within a given category.

== Definition ==
Let formula_1 be a category and let formula_2 and formula_3 be objects of formula_4 An object is called the coproduct of formula_2 and formula_6 written formula_7 or formula_8 or sometimes simply formula_9 if there exist morphisms formula_10 and formula_11 satisfying the following universal property: for any object formula_12 and any morphisms formula_13 and formula_14 there exists a unique morphism formula_15 such that formula_16 and formula_17 That is, the following diagram commutes:

The unique arrow formula_18 making this diagram commute may be denoted formula_19 formula_20 formula_21 or formula_22 The morphisms formula_23 and formula_24 are called , although they need not be injections or even monic.

The definition of a coproduct can be extended to an arbitrary family of objects indexed by a set formula_25 The coproduct of the family formula_26 is an object formula_27 together with a collection of morphisms formula_28 such that, for any object formula_12 and any collection of morphisms formula_30 there exists a unique morphism formula_31 such that formula_32 That is, the following diagram commutes for each formula_33:

The coproduct formula_27 of the family formula_35 is often denoted formula_36 or formula_37

Sometimes the morphism formula_31 may be denoted formula_39 to indicate its dependence on the individual formula_40s.

== Examples ==
The coproduct in the category of sets is simply the disjoint union with the maps &quot;ij&quot; being the inclusion maps. Unlike direct products, coproducts in other categories are not all obviously based on the notion for sets, because unions don&#x27;t behave well with respect to preserving operations (e.g. the union of two groups need not be a group), and so coproducts in different categories can be dramatically different from each other. For example, the coproduct in the category of groups, called the free product, is quite complicated. On the other hand, in the category of abelian groups (and equally for vector spaces), the coproduct, called the direct sum, consists of the elements of the direct product which have only finitely many nonzero terms. (It therefore coincides exactly with the direct product in the case of finitely many factors.)

Given a commutative ring &quot;R&quot;, the coproduct in the category of commutative &quot;R&quot;-algebras is the tensor product. In the category of (noncommutative) &quot;R&quot;-algebras, the coproduct is a quotient of the tensor algebra (see free product of associative algebras).

In the case of topological spaces, coproducts are disjoint unions with their disjoint union topologies. That is, it is a disjoint union of the underlying sets, and the open sets are sets &quot;open in each of the spaces&quot;, in a rather evident sense. In the category of pointed spaces, fundamental in homotopy theory, the coproduct is the wedge sum (which amounts to joining a collection of spaces with base points at a common base point).

The concept of disjoint union secretly underlies the above examples: the direct sum of abelian groups is the group generated by the &quot;almost&quot; disjoint union (disjoint union of all nonzero elements, together with a common zero), similarly for vector spaces: the space spanned by the &quot;almost&quot; disjoint union; the free product for groups is generated by the set of all letters from a similar &quot;almost disjoint&quot; union where no two elements from different sets are allowed to commute. This pattern holds for any variety in the sense of universal algebra.

The coproduct in the category of Banach spaces with short maps is the  sum, which cannot be so easily conceptualized as an &quot;almost disjoint&quot; sum, but does have a unit ball almost-disjointly generated by the unit ball is the cofactors.

The coproduct of a poset category is the join operation.

== Discussion ==

The coproduct construction given above is actually a special case of a colimit in category theory. The coproduct in a category formula_1 can be defined as the colimit of any functor from a discrete category formula_42 into formula_1. Not every family formula_44 will have a coproduct in general, but if it does, then the coproduct is unique in a strong sense: if formula_45 and formula_46 are two coproducts of the family formula_44, then (by the definition of coproducts) there exists a unique isomorphism formula_48 such that formula_49 for each formula_33.

As with any universal property, the coproduct can be understood as a universal morphism. Let formula_51 be the diagonal functor which assigns to each object formula_27 the ordered pair formula_53 and to each morphism formula_54 the pair formula_55. Then the coproduct formula_56 in formula_1 is given by a universal morphism to the functor formula_58 from the object formula_59 in formula_60.

The coproduct indexed by the empty set (that is, an &quot;empty coproduct&quot;) is the same as an initial object in formula_1.

If formula_42 is a set such that all coproducts for families indexed with formula_42 exist, then it is possible to choose the products in a compatible fashion so that the coproduct turns into a functor formula_64. The coproduct of the family formula_44 is then often denoted by 
:formula_66
and the maps formula_67 are known as the natural injections.

Letting formula_68 denote the set of all morphisms from formula_69 to formula_70 in formula_1 (that is, a hom-set in formula_1), we have a natural isomorphism 
:formula_73
given by the bijection which maps every tuple of morphisms
:formula_74
(a product in Set, the category of sets, which is the Cartesian product, so it is a tuple of morphisms) to the morphism
:formula_75
That this map is a surjection follows from the commutativity of the diagram: any morphism formula_18 is the coproduct of the tuple 
:formula_77
That it is an injection follows from the universal construction which stipulates the uniqueness of such maps. The naturality of the isomorphism is also a consequence of the diagram. Thus the contravariant hom-functor changes coproducts into products. Stated another way, the hom-functor, viewed as a functor from the opposite category formula_78 to Set is continuous; it preserves limits (a coproduct in formula_1 is a product in formula_78).

If formula_42 is a finite set, say formula_82, then the coproduct of objects formula_83 is often denoted by formula_84. Suppose all finite coproducts exist in &quot;C&quot;, coproduct functors have been chosen as above, and 0 denotes the initial object of &quot;C&quot; corresponding to the empty coproduct. We then have natural isomorphisms
:formula_85
:formula_86
:formula_87
These properties are formally similar to those of a commutative monoid; a category with finite coproducts is an example of a symmetric monoidal category.

If the category has a zero object formula_88, then we have a unique morphism formula_89 (since formula_88 is terminal) and thus a morphism formula_91. Since formula_88 is also initial, we have a canonical isomorphism formula_93 as in the preceding paragraph. We thus have morphisms formula_94 and formula_95, by which we infer a canonical morphism formula_96. This may be extended by induction to a canonical morphism from any finite coproduct to the corresponding product. This morphism need not in general be an isomorphism; in Grp it is a proper epimorphism while in Set* (the category of pointed sets) it is a proper monomorphism. In any preadditive category, this morphism is an isomorphism and the corresponding object is known as the biproduct. A category with all finite biproducts is known as a semiadditive category.

If all families of objects indexed by formula_42 have coproducts in formula_1, then the coproduct comprises a functor formula_64. Note that, like the product, this functor is &quot;covariant&quot;.

<text>Incompatibilism is the view that the thesis of determinism is logically incompatible with the classical thesis of free will. The term was coined in the 1960s, most likely by philosopher Keith Lehrer. The term &quot;compatibilism&quot; was coined (also by Lehrer) to name the view that the classical free will thesis is logically compatible with determinism, i.e. it is possible for an ordinary human to exercise free will (the freedom-relevant ability to do otherwise), even in a universe where determinism is true. These terms were originally coined for use within a research paradigm that was dominant among academics during the so-called &quot;classical period&quot; from the 1960s to 1980s, or what has been called the &quot;classical analytic paradigm&quot;. Within the classical analytic paradigm, the problem of free will and determinism was understood as a compatibility question: &quot;Is it possible for an ordinary human to exercise free will (classically defined as an ability to otherwise) when determinism is true?&quot; Those working in the classical analytic paradigm who answered &quot;no&quot; were &quot;incompatibilists&quot; in the original, classical-analytic sense of the term, now commonly called &quot;classical incompatibilists&quot;; they proposed that determinism precludes free will because it precludes the ability to do otherwise. Those who answered &quot;yes&quot; were &quot;compatibilists&quot; in the original sense of the term, now commonly called &quot;classical compatibilists&quot;.
Given that classical free will theorists (i.e. those working in the classical analytic paradigm) agreed that it is at least metaphysically possible for an ordinary human to exercise free will, all classical compatibilists accepted a compossibilist account of free will (i.e. a compossibilist interpretation of the ability to do otherwise) and all classical incompatibilists accepted a libertarian (a.k.a. libertarianist) account of free will (i.e. a libertarian/libertarianist interpretation of the ability to do otherwise).

The classical analytic paradigm has fallen out of favor over the last few decades, largely because philosophers no longer agree that free will is equivalent to some kind of ability to do otherwise; many hold that it is, instead, a type of sourcehood that does not require an ability to do otherwise. The number of philosophers who reject the classical assumption of anthropocentric possibilism, i.e. the view that it is at least metaphysically possible for a human to exercise free will, has also risen in recent years. As philosophers adjusted Lehrer&#x27;s original (classical) definitions of the terms &quot;incompatibilism&quot; and &quot;compatibilism&quot; to reflect their own perspectives on the location of the purported &quot;fundamental divide&quot; among free will theorists, the terms &quot;incompatibilism&quot; and &quot;compatibilism&quot; have been given a variety of new meanings. At present, then, there is no standard meaning of the term &quot;incompatibilism&quot; (or its complement &quot;compatibilism&quot;).

== Definition ==
On one recent taxonomy, there are now at least three substantively different, non-classical uses of the term &quot;incompatibilism&quot;, namely: neo-classical incompatibilism, post-classical incompatibilism (a.k.a. incompossibilism), and anti-classical incompatibilism. Correspondingly, there are neo-classical, post-classical (compossibilist), and anti-classical versions of compatibilism as well. Neo-classical incompatibilism is a two-tenet view: incompossibilism is true (i.e. it is metaphysically impossible for an ordinary human to act freely when determinism is true), and determinism-related causal/nomological factors preclude free will (which explains &quot;why&quot; incompossibilism is true). Correspondingly, neo-classical compatibilism is the two-tenet view that: the negative, non-explanatory tenet of neo-classical incompatibilism is false (i.e. compossibilism is true), and that the positive, explanatory tenet of neo-classical incompatibilism is false. Anti-classical incompatibilism is the explanatory thesis of neo-classical incompatibilism; anti-classical incompatibilism is neutral on the truth-value of incompossibilism. Correspondingly, anti-classical compatibilism is the negation of neo-classical incompatibilism&#x27;s positive tenet, i.e. anti-classical compatibilism is the contradictory of anti-classical incompatibilism. Post-classical incompatibilism is just the negative, non-explanatory thesis of neo-classical incompatibilism; this view is neutral on whether the positive, explanatory thesis of neo-classical incompatibilism is true. (Put another way, on the post-classical redefinition of &quot;incompatibilism&quot;, it is just an alternative name for incompossibilism, a view which is completely silent on whether determinism-related causal factors are &quot;relevant&quot; to free will or are a total &quot;red herring&quot; in discussions of free will.) Correspondingly, post-classical compatibilism is identical to compossibilism (i.e. on the post-classical redefinition of &quot;compatibilism&quot;, it denotes mere compossibilism).

The ambiguity of &quot;incompatibilism&quot; can be a source of confusion because arguments with very different (even inconsistent) conclusions are currently lumped together under the umbrella phrase &quot;arguments for incompatibilism&quot;. For example, it is easy for the casual reader to overlook that some arguments for &quot;post-classical&quot; incompatibilism (a.k.a. incompossibilism) are not arguments for &quot;neo-classical&quot; incompatibilism on the grounds that the argument does not aim to support the latter&#x27;s explanatory tenet (a.k.a. &quot;anti-classical&quot; incompatibilism). Other arguments support &quot;post-classical&quot; incompatibilism (a.k.a. incompossibilism) but conclude that &quot;neo-classical&quot; incompatibilism is false on the grounds that its explanatory tenet (a.k.a. &quot;anti-classical&quot; incompatibilism) is false. Arguments in the last category conclude that people lack free will when determinism is true but not at all &quot;because&quot; determinism is true (i.e. not at all because certain causal/nomological factors obtain); most propose that the real threat to free will is that people lack adequate control over their own constitutive properties, or what is often called their &quot;constitutive luck&quot; (as opposed to causal luck).

== Libertarianism ==
Free-will libertarianism is the view that the free-will thesis (that we, ordinary humans, have free will) is true and that determinism is false; in first-order language, it is the view that we (ordinary humans) have free will and the world does not behave in the way described by determinism. Libertarianism is one of the popular solutions to the problem of free will, roughly the problem of settling the question of whether we have free will and the logically prior question of what free will amounts to. The main rivals to libertarianism are soft determinism and hard determinism.

Libertarian Robert Kane (editor of the &quot;Oxford Handbook of Free Will&quot;) is a leading incompatibilist philosopher in favour of free will. Kane seeks to hold persons morally responsible for decisions that involved indeterminism in their process. Critics maintain that Kane fails to overcome the greatest challenge to such an endeavor: &quot;the argument from luck&quot;. Namely, if a critical moral choice is a matter of luck (indeterminate quantum fluctuations), then the question of holding a person responsible for their final action arises. Moreover, even if we imagine that a person can make an act of will ahead of time, to make the &quot;moral&quot; action more probable in the upcoming critical moment, this act of &#x27;willing&#x27; was itself a matter of luck. Kane objects to the validity of the argument from luck because the latter misrepresents the chance as if it is external to the act of choosing. The free will theorem of John H. Conway and Simon B. Kochen further establishes that if we have free will, then quantum particles also possess free will. This means that starting from the assumption that humans have free will, it is possible to pinpoint the origin of their free will in the quantum particles that constitute their brain.

Such philosophical stance risks an infinite regress, however; if any such mind is real, an objection can be raised that free will would be impossible if the choosing is shaped merely by luck or chance.

Libertarianism in the philosophy of mind is unrelated to the like-named political philosophy. It suggests that we actually do have free will, that it is incompatible with determinism, and that therefore the future is not determined. 

One famous proponent of this view was Lucretius, who asserted that the free will arises out of the random, chaotic movements of atoms, called &quot;clinamen&quot;. One major objection to this view is that science has gradually shown that more and more of the physical world obeys completely deterministic laws, and seems to suggest that our minds are just as much part of the physical world as anything else. If these assumptions are correct, incompatibilist libertarianism can only be maintained as the claim that free will is a supernatural phenomenon, which does not obey the laws of nature (as, for instance, maintained by some religious traditions).

However, many libertarian view points now rely upon an indeterministic view of the physical universe, under the assumption that the idea of a deterministic, clockwork universe has become outdated since the advent of quantum mechanics.
By assuming an indeterministic universe, libertarian philosophical constructs can be proposed under the assumption of physicalism.

There are libertarian view points based upon indeterminism and physicalism, which is closely related to naturalism. A major problem for naturalistic libertarianism is to explain how indeterminism can be compatible with rationality and with appropriate connections between an individual&#x27;s beliefs, desires, general character and actions. A variety of naturalistic libertarianism is promoted by Robert Kane, who emphasizes that if our &quot;character&quot; is formed indeterministically (in &quot;self-forming actions&quot;), then our actions can still flow from our character, and yet still be incompatibilistically free.

Alternatively, libertarian view points based upon indeterminism have been proposed without the assumption of naturalism. At the time C. S. Lewis wrote &quot;Miracles&quot;, quantum mechanics (and physical indeterminism) was only in the initial stages of acceptance, but still Lewis stated the logical possibility that, if the physical world was proved to be indeterministic, this would provide an entry (interaction) point into the traditionally viewed closed system, where a scientifically described physically probable/improbable event could be philosophically described as an action of a non-physical entity on physical reality (noting that, under a physicalist point of view, the non-physical entity must be independent of the self-identity or mental processing of the sentient being). Lewis mentions this only in passing, making clear that his thesis does not depend on it in any way.

Others may use some form of Donald Davidson&#x27;s anomalous monism to suggest that although the mind is in fact part of the physical world, it involves a different level of description of the same facts, so that although there are deterministic laws under the physical description, there are no such laws under the mental description, and thus our actions are free and not determined.

== Hard determinism ==

Those who reject free will and accept determinism are variously known as &quot;hard determinists&quot;, hard incompatibilists, free will skeptics, illusionists, or impossibilists. They believe that there is no free will and that any sense of the contrary is an illusion. Hard determinists do not deny that one has desires, but say that these desires are causally determined by an unbroken chain of prior occurrences. According to this philosophy, no wholly random, spontaneous, mysterious, or miraculous events occur. Determinists sometimes assert that it is stubborn to resist scientifically motivated determinism on purely intuitive grounds about one&#x27;s own sense of freedom. They reason that the history of the development of science suggests that determinism is the logical method in which reality works.

William James said that philosophers (and scientists) have an &quot;antipathy to chance&quot;. Absolute chance, a possible implication of quantum mechanics and the indeterminacy principle, supports the existence of indefinite causal structures.

=== Moral implications ===
Since many believe that free will is necessary for moral responsibility, hard determinism may imply disastrous consequences for their theory of ethics, resulting in a domino theory of moral nonresponsibility.

As something of a solution to this predicament, one might embrace the so-called &quot;illusion&quot; of free will. This thesis argues in favor of maintaining the prevailing belief in free will for the sake of preserving moral responsibility and the concept of ethics. However, critics argue that this move renders morality merely another &quot;illusion&quot;, or else that this move is simply hypocritical.

The determinist will add that, even if denying free will does mean morality is incoherent, such a result has no effect on the truth. However, hard determinists often have some sort of moral system that relies explicitly on determinism. A determinist&#x27;s moral system simply bears in mind that every person&#x27;s actions in a given situation are, in theory, predicted by the interplay of environment and upbringing.

== Hard incompatibilism ==

Hard incompatibilism, like hard determinism, is a type of skepticism about free will. &quot;Hard incompatibilism&quot; is a term coined by Derk Pereboom to designate the view that both determinism and indeterminism are incompatible with having free will and moral responsibility. Like the hard determinist, the hard incompatibilist holds that if determinism were true, people would not have free will. But Pereboom argues in addition that if decisions were indeterministic events, free will would also be precluded. In his view, free will is the control in action required for the desert aspect of moral responsibility—for people to deserve to be blamed or punished for immoral actions, and to be praised or rewarded for morally exemplary actions. He contends that if people&#x27;s decisions were indeterministic events, their occurrence would not be in the control of the agent in the way required for such attributions of desert. The possibility for free will that remains is libertarian agent causation, according to which agents as substances (thus not merely as having a role in events) can cause actions without being causally determined to do so. Pereboom argues that for empirical reasons it is unlikely that people are agent causes of this sort, and that as a result, it is likely that they lack free will.

== Experimental research ==
In recent years researchers in the field of experimental philosophy have been working on determining whether ordinary people, who are not experts in this field, naturally have compatibilist or incompatibilist intuitions about determinism and moral responsibility. Some experimental work has even conducted cross-cultural studies. The debate about whether people naturally have compatibilist or incompatibilist intuitions has not come out overwhelmingly in favor of one view or the other. Still, there has been some evidence that people can naturally hold both views. For instance, when people are presented with abstract cases which ask if a person could be morally responsible for an immoral act when they could not have done otherwise, people tend to say no, or give &quot;incompatibilist&quot; answers, but when presented with a specific immoral act that a specific person committed, people tend to say that that person is morally responsible for their actions, even if they were determined (that is, people also give &quot;compatibilist&quot; answers).

<text>Male waxing is the broad term for hair removal for men using depilatory wax; it is also called &quot;male body waxing&quot; and &quot;male Brazilian waxing&quot;. The latter refers to the removal of hair from the pubic area and buttocks.

==Male body waxing==
Male body waxing refers to all body areas from neck to toe except the genital and buttocks area. Normal body hair is finer with shallower roots than pubic hair. It is usually removed with strip wax which leaves a smooth result and exfoliates the top layer of dead skin cells.

==Male Brazilian waxing==
The somewhat vague term &quot;male Brazilian waxing&quot;, refers to any removal of hair from the pubis, penis, scrotum, perineum, or buttocks. The definition also usually includes the bikini line, or an inch or two out from the leg crease. It takes its name from female Brazilian waxing. The term &quot;Manzilian&quot; is becoming increasingly mainstream in advertising and popular culture to differentiate the treatment from female waxing.

<text>The Blues Magoos are an American rock group from The Bronx, a borough of New York City, United States. They were at the forefront of the psychedelic music trend, beginning in 1966. They are best known for the hit song &quot;(We Ain&#x27;t Got) Nothin&#x27; Yet&quot;, their only single to reach the &quot;Billboard&quot; top fifty.

==History==
===1964–1971===
The band was formed in 1964 as The Trenchcoats after Ralph Scala and Ron Gilbert met on the golf team at Dewitt Clinton High School. The original members were Emil &quot;Peppy&quot; Thielhelm &quot;Peppy&quot; Castro (vocals and guitar), Dennis LePore (lead guitar), Ralph Scala (organ and vocals), Ron Gilbert (bass) and Jon Finnegan (drums). The band made a name for itself in various clubs in Greenwich Village, most notably the Night Owl Cafe. In 1965, the name had been changed to The Bloos Magoos, and by 1966, the band had settled on calling themselves the Blues Magoos. Mike Esposito and Geoff Daking replaced Dennis LePore and Jon Finnegan, respectively, by early 1966. 

The band&#x27;s single &quot;So I&#x27;m Wrong and You Are Right&quot; b/w &quot;The People Had No Faces&quot; on Verve Records (both Rick Shorter compositions) did not gain the band much recognition. Verve dropped them shortly thereafter.

In early 1966, Mercury Records signed the band to a record deal with the help of Bob Wyld and Art Polhemus of Longhair Productions. Their first single, “Tobacco Road” b/w “Sometimes I Think About” was released in June 1966. The group&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Psychedelic Lollipop&quot;, was released in November 1966 – becoming one of the first albums to include the word &quot;psychedelic&quot; on the sleeve (after the 13th Floor Elevators&#x27; &quot;The Psychedelic Sounds of the 13th Floor Elevators&quot; and The Deep&#x27;s &quot;Psychedelic Moods&quot;, both also from 1966). They played often at the Chess Mate Coffeehouse, a mostly folk venue in Detroit owned by Morrie Widenbaum that also hosted bands such as Southbound Freeway and Siegel-Schwall Blues Band. 

The group&#x27;s most successful song was &quot;(We Ain&#x27;t Got) Nothin&#x27; Yet,&quot; which reached number 5 on the U.S. charts, and number 4 in Canada.

The next single by the Blues Magoos was &quot;There&#x27;s A Chance We Can Make It&quot;. By 1967, they appeared on several network television programs, including two Dick Clark–produced series, &quot;Where The Action Is&quot; and &quot;American Bandstand&quot;. They also made visits to &quot;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot;, performing &quot;Pipe Dream,&quot; and a &quot;Kraft Music Hall&quot; hosted by Jack Benny. &quot;One by One&quot; was the band&#x27;s last single to make the charts. &quot;Electric Comic Book,&quot; their next album, was released on Mercury in April 1967. Starting in June 1967, the Blues Magoos embarked on a tour through the US and Canada with Herman&#x27;s Hermits and The Who until September of that year. In May 1968, the band released their third album, &quot;Basic Blues Magoos&quot;. Shortly afterwards, in mid-late 1968, the band split up after disagreements on the musical direction of the band and financial problems. 

In early 1969, Castro formed a new band with Eric Kaz, Richie Dickon, John Leillo, and Roger Eaton. The band was signed to ABC Records after agreeing to keep the Blues Magoos name. Also in early 1969, Scala, Gilbert, and Daking moved to Los Angeles, enlisted Ted Munda, and released the &quot;Let Your Love Ride&quot; b/w &quot;Who Do You Love&quot; single on Ganim Records before replacing Munda with Joey Stec, formerly of The Millennium, and then going their separate ways after a dispute with ABC Records over the rights to the Blues Magoos name. Ralph Scala, Ron Gilbert, and Joey Stec later played in The Dependables. In 1969, the Castro-led band completed &quot;Never Goin&#x27; Back To Georgia&quot;. Eaton left the band, and the other Blues Magoos used session musicians for the follow-up &quot;Gulf Coast Bound&quot;. After two further years the band dissolved.

===1972–Present===
After a stint with the rock musical &quot;Hair&quot; and recording with Mercury label mate Exuma (Tony McKay), Peppy Castro formed Barnaby Bye with fellow cast members Bobby and Billy Alessi. The group released two albums on Atlantic Records, &quot;Room to Grow&quot; (1972) and &quot;Touch&quot; (1973). In 1981, Castro resurfaced again with the group Balance whose song &quot;Breaking Away&quot; reached No. 22 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. 

In July 2008, the Blues Magoos, with original members Ralph Scala, Castro and Geoff Daking reunited for the first time in years for two concerts, including one with The Zombies at the Fillmore New York at Irving Plaza in New York City. In December 2009, they traveled to Spain for the Purple Weekend festival.

In 2014, The Blues Magoos released their first new album in 43 years, &quot;Psychedelic Resurrection&quot;. The Blues Magoos toured in 2015. In 2022, The Blues Magoos officially released their last recording, &quot;Nowhere is Somewhere&quot;. The song and accompanying video were featured at the 2021 Woodstock Film Festival.

On February 16, 2024, Ron Gilbert died in Los Angeles, California, as confirmed by the Blues Magoos official Facebook page. As of 2024, he is the only deceased original member of the band.

<doc id="310898" wikidata="Q836356" url="?curid=310898" title="Croup">
<text>Croup ( ), also known as croupy cough, is a type of respiratory infection that is usually caused by a virus. The infection leads to swelling inside the trachea, which interferes with normal breathing and produces the classic symptoms of &quot;barking/brassy&quot; cough, inspiratory stridor and a hoarse voice. Fever and runny nose may also be present. These symptoms may be mild, moderate, or severe. Often it starts or is worse at night and normally lasts one to two days.
Croup can be caused by a number of viruses including parainfluenza and influenza virus. Rarely is it due to a bacterial infection. Croup is typically diagnosed based on signs and symptoms after potentially more severe causes, such as epiglottitis or an airway foreign body, have been ruled out. Further investigations, such as blood tests, X-rays and cultures, are usually not needed.
Many cases of croup are preventable by immunization for influenza and diphtheria. Most cases of croup are mild and the patient can be treated at home with supportive care. Croup is usually treated with a single dose of steroids by mouth. In more severe cases inhaled epinephrine may also be used. Hospitalization is required in one to five percent of cases.
Croup is a relatively common condition that affects about 15% of children at some point. It most commonly occurs between six months and five years of age but may rarely be seen in children as old as fifteen. It is slightly more common in males than females. It occurs most often in autumn. Before vaccination, croup was frequently caused by diphtheria and was often fatal. This cause is now very rare in the Western world due to the success of the diphtheria vaccine.

==Signs and symptoms==

Croup is characterized by a &quot;barking&quot; cough, stridor, hoarseness, and difficult breathing which usually worsens at night. The &quot;barking&quot; cough is often described as resembling the call of a sea lion. The stridor is worsened by agitation or crying, and if it can be heard at rest, it may indicate critical narrowing of the airways. As croup worsens, stridor may decrease considerably.

Other symptoms include fever, coryza (symptoms typical of the common cold), and indrawing of the chest wall–known as Hoover&#x27;s sign. Drooling or a very sick appearance can indicate other medical conditions, such as epiglottitis or tracheitis.

==Causes==
Croup is usually deemed to be due to a viral infection. Others use the term more broadly, to include acute laryngotracheitis (laryngitis and tracheitis together), spasmodic croup, laryngeal diphtheria, bacterial tracheitis, laryngotracheobronchitis, and laryngotracheobronchopneumonitis. The first two conditions involve a viral infection and are generally milder with respect to symptomatology; the last four are due to bacterial infection and are usually of greater severity.

===Viral===
Viral croup or acute laryngotracheitis is most commonly caused by parainfluenza virus (a member of the paramyxovirus family), primarily types 1 and 2, in 75% of cases. Other viral causes include influenza A and B, measles, adenovirus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Spasmodic croup is caused by the same group of viruses as acute laryngotracheitis, but lacks the usual signs of infection (such as fever, sore throat, and increased white blood cell count). Treatment, and response to treatment, are also similar.

===Bacteria and cocci ===
Croup caused by a bacterial infection is rare. Bacterial croup may be divided into laryngeal diphtheria, bacterial tracheitis, laryngotracheobronchitis, and laryngotracheobronchopneumonitis. Laryngeal diphtheria is due to &quot;Corynebacterium diphtheriae&quot; while bacterial tracheitis, laryngotracheobronchitis, and laryngotracheobronchopneumonitis are usually due to a primary viral infection with secondary bacterial growth. The most common cocci implicated are &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; and &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot;, while the most common bacteria are &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot;, and &quot;Moraxella catarrhalis&quot;.

==Pathophysiology==
The viral infection that causes croup leads to swelling of the larynx, trachea, and large bronchi due to infiltration of white blood cells (especially histiocytes, lymphocytes, plasma cells, and neutrophils). Swelling produces airway obstruction which, when significant, leads to dramatically increased work of breathing and the characteristic turbulent, noisy airflow known as stridor.

==Diagnosis==
Croup is typically diagnosed based on signs and symptoms. The first step is to exclude other obstructive conditions of the upper airway, especially epiglottitis, an airway foreign body, subglottic stenosis, angioedema, retropharyngeal abscess, and bacterial tracheitis.

A frontal X-ray of the neck is not routinely performed, but if it is done, it may show a characteristic narrowing of the trachea, called the steeple sign, because of the subglottic stenosis, which resembles a steeple in shape. The steeple sign is suggestive of the diagnosis, but is absent in half of cases.

Other investigations (such as blood tests and viral culture) are discouraged, as they may cause unnecessary agitation and thus worsen the stress on the compromised airway. While viral cultures, obtained via nasopharyngeal aspiration, can be used to confirm the exact cause, these are usually restricted to research settings. Bacterial infection should be considered if a person does not improve with standard treatment, at which point further investigations may be indicated.

===Severity===

The most commonly used system for classifying the severity of croup is the Westley score. It is primarily used for research purposes rather than in clinical practice. It is the sum of points assigned for five factors: level of consciousness, cyanosis, stridor, air entry, and retractions. The points given for each factor is listed in the adjacent table, and the final score ranges from 0 to 17.
* A total score of ≤ 2 indicates &quot;mild&quot; croup. The characteristic barking cough and hoarseness may be present, but there is no stridor at rest.
* A total score of 3–5 is classified as &quot;moderate&quot; croup. It presents with easily heard stridor, but with few other signs.
* A total score of 6–11 is &quot;severe&quot; croup. It also presents with obvious stridor, but also features marked chest wall indrawing.
* A total score of ≥ 12 indicates impending respiratory failure. The barking cough and stridor may no longer be prominent at this stage.

85% of children presenting to the emergency department have mild disease; severe croup is rare (&lt;1%).

==Prevention==
Croup is contagious during the first few days of the infection. Basic hygiene including hand washing can prevent transmission. There are no vaccines that have been developed to prevent croup, however, many cases of croup have been prevented by immunization for influenza and diphtheria. At one time, croup referred to a diphtherial disease, but with vaccination, diphtheria is now rare in the developed world.

==Treatment==
Most children with croup have mild symptoms and supportive care at home is effective. For children with moderate to severe croup, treatment with corticosteroids and nebulized epinephrine may be suggested. Steroids are given routinely, with epinephrine used in severe cases. Children with oxygen saturation less than 92% should receive oxygen, and those with severe croup may be hospitalized for observation. In very rare severe cases of croup that result in respiratory failure, emergency intubation and ventilation may be required. With treatment, less than 0.2% of children require endotracheal intubation. Since croup is usually a viral disease, antibiotics are not used unless secondary bacterial infection is suspected. The use of cough medicines, which usually contain dextromethorphan or guaifenesin, are also discouraged.

=== Supportive care ===
Supportive care for children with croup includes resting and keeping the child hydrated. Infections that are mild are suggested to be treated at home. Croup is contagious so washing hands is important. Children with croup should generally be kept as calm as possible. Over the counter medications for pain and fever may be helpful to keep the child comfortable. There is some evidence that cool or warm mist may be helpful, however, the effectiveness of this approach is not clear. If the child is showing signs of distress while breathing (inspiratory stridor, working hard to breathe, blue (or blue-ish) coloured lips, or decrease in the level of alertness), immediate medical evaluation by a doctor is required.

===Steroids===
Corticosteroids, such as dexamethasone and budesonide, have been shown to improve outcomes in children with all severities of croup, however, the benefits may be delayed. Significant relief may be obtained as early as two hours after administration. While effective when given by injection, or by inhalation, giving the medication by mouth is preferred. A single dose is usually all that is required, and is generally considered to be quite safe. Dexamethasone at doses of 0.15, 0.3 and 0.6 mg/kg appear to be all equally effective.

===Epinephrine===
Moderate to severe croup (for example, in the case of severe stridor) may be improved temporarily with nebulized epinephrine. While epinephrine typically produces a reduction in croup severity within 10–30 minutes, the benefits are short-lived and last for only about 2 hours. If the condition remains improved for 2–4 hours after treatment and no other complications arise, the child is typically discharged from the hospital. Epinephrine treatment is associated with potential adverse effects (usually related to the dose of epinephrine) including tachycardia, arrhythmias, and hypertension.

=== Oxygen ===
More severe cases of croup may require treatment with oxygen. If oxygen is needed, &quot;blow-by&quot; administration (holding an oxygen source near the child&#x27;s face) is recommended, as it causes less agitation than use of a mask.

===Other===
While other treatments for croup have been studied, none has sufficient evidence to support its use. There is tentative evidence that breathing heliox (a mixture of helium and oxygen) to decrease the work of breathing is useful in those with severe disease, however, there is uncertainty in the effectiveness and the potential adverse effects and/or side effects are not well known. In cases of possible secondary bacterial infection, the antibiotics vancomycin and cefotaxime are recommended. In severe cases associated with influenza A or B infections, the antiviral neuraminidase inhibitors may be administered.

==Prognosis==
Viral croup is usually a self-limiting disease, with half of cases resolving in a day and 80% of cases in two days. It can very rarely result in death from respiratory failure and/or cardiac arrest. Symptoms usually improve within two days, but may last for up to seven days. Other uncommon complications include bacterial tracheitis, pneumonia, and pulmonary edema.

==Epidemiology==
Croup affects about 15% of children, and usually presents between the ages of 6 months and 5–6 years. It accounts for about 5% of hospital admissions in this population. In rare cases, it may occur in children as young as 3 months and as old as 15 years. Males are affected 50% more frequently than are females, and there is an increased prevalence in autumn.

==History==
The word &quot;croup&quot; comes from the Early Modern English verb &quot;croup&quot;, meaning &quot;to cry hoarsely.&quot; The noun describing the disease originated in southeastern Scotland and became widespread after Edinburgh physician Francis Home published the 1765 treatise &quot;An Inquiry into the Nature, Cause, and Cure of the Croup&quot;.

Diphtheritic croup has been known since the time of Homer&#x27;s ancient Greece, and it was not until 1826 that viral croup was differentiated from croup due to diphtheria by Bretonneau. Viral croup was then called &quot;faux-croup&quot; by the French and often called &quot;false croup&quot; in English, as &quot;croup&quot; or &quot;true croup&quot; then most often referred to the disease caused by the diphtheria bacterium. False croup has also been known as pseudo croup or spasmodic croup. Croup due to diphtheria has become nearly unknown in affluent countries in modern times due to the advent of effective immunization.

One famous fatality of croup was Napoleon&#x27;s designated heir, Napoléon Charles Bonaparte. His death in 1807 left Napoleon without an heir and contributed to his decision to divorce from his wife, the Empress Josephine de Beauharnais. Preston Brooks, a pro-slavery, pre-Civil War US congressman from South Carolina died unexpectedly from a violent attack of croup on January 27, 1857, a few weeks before the March 4 start of the new congressional term to which he had been re-elected.

<text>Kahless &quot;The Unforgettable&quot; is a fictional character from the &quot;Star Trek&quot; media franchise. He was displayed as a portrait in &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot; by Robert Herron and in &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; by Kevin Conway; and is the titular character in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; novel &quot;Kahless&quot; by Michael Jan Freeman. Kahless is an important religious and historical figure to the Klingon race and has been studied in explorations of the philosophy within the setting of &quot;Star Trek&quot;.

Kahless was also the subject of a Klingon language opera in the Netherlands.

== Name ==
In the Klingon language, Kahless&#x27; name is spelled &quot;qeylIS&quot;. The Klingon spelling and pronunciation of Kahless&#x27; name was established in 1984 by language expert Marc Okrand.

==Background ==
Within the setting, Kahless is a messianic figure in Klingon history, who unified the Klingon people and became emperor after three centuries without leadership. Kahless said that Klingons should fight not just to shed blood, but to enrich the spirit. The story of Kahless is a cornerstone of Klingon mythology and religion.

The spouse of Kahless was Lady Lukara, whom he had become romantically involved with after a battle against five hundred warriors at the Great Hall of Qam-Chee, when the local garrison routed. Only Kahless and Lukara remained to fight and achieved a decisive victory.

An image of Kahless was encountered in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode &quot;The Savage Curtain&quot;. In the Excalbian Yarnek&#x27;s study of good versus evil, Kahless was one of the evil images alongside Zora, Colonel Phillip Green and Genghis Khan. Abraham Lincoln and Surak of Vulcan represented good and assisted Kirk and Spock. Played by actor Robert Herron, this Kahless also appeared as the typical original series smooth forehead Klingon (which does not date back to the era of Kahless as revealed in &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot;). As the Excalbians were reading Kirk and Spock&#x27;s thought patterns, Kahless&#x27;s depiction here was believed by fans to be based solely on Kirk&#x27;s limited and heavily biased knowledge of Klingon culture.

In the &quot;Next Generation&quot; episode &quot;Rightful Heir,&quot; Kahless was alluded to as having united the Klingon Empire some 1,500 years ago after fighting and killing the tyrant Molor with the first bat&#x27;leth. He is said to have fashioned the weapon by dropping a lock of his hair into the lava from the Kri&#x27;stak Volcano and twisting it into a blade. 

Furthermore, in the episode, a clone of Kahless was created by caretakers of the planet Boreth (a Klingon pilgrimage site) using dried blood from the ancient dagger of Molor in an attempt to gain political influence. The scheme was circumvented by Worf, who learned the truth and subsequently arranged for the new Kahless II to occupy a ceremonial position as a figurehead and spiritual leader in the Klingon Empire.

Another story tells of how Kahless fought his brother, Morath, for twelve days and twelve nights after Morath had lied and brought shame to his family. Kahless is also said to have fought off an entire army single-handedly at Three Turn Bridge. 

==Religion==
In-universe, Klingon warriors will often pray to Kahless for guidance before going into battle. The Blood Oath, a popular Klingon prayer, most prominently used in &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot; is as follows:

* &quot;Whom do we seek?&quot;
** &quot;Kahless.&quot;
* &quot;How do we find him?&quot;
** &quot;Together.&quot;
* &quot;Give us light to see.&quot;
** &quot;Forever.&quot;
* &quot;Will he hide from us always?&quot;
** &quot;Never.&quot;
In &quot;Star Trek and Philosophy: The Wrath of Kant,&quot; they are comfortable with Worf&#x27;s exploration of his spirituality on his trip to Boreth. They note that when Kahless appears not as a vision, but an actual person to Worf, he reacts with skepticism, and responds by using the advanced technology at his disposal to investigate.

== Clone ==
In the &quot;Star Trek&quot; science fiction universe, the Clone of Kahless was created by a Klingon scientist named Gothmara, with the assistance and aid of materials provided by the Clerics, &quot;The r&#x27;tak of Boreth.&quot;

By Lieutenant Worf&#x27;s design and with the cooperation of Chancellor Gowron, the Clone of Kahless becomes emperor of the Klingon Empire in the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; episode &quot;Rightful Heir.&quot; The emperor is a figurehead, with power residing with the Klingon High Council. Worf believes this to be the first step in a renaissance for the Klingon people. This idealism is seen to be unfounded when the Clone&#x27;s opposition to the Klingon invasion of Cardassian space is unheeded by the High Council and their armies.

The Kahless clone is played by actor Kevin Conway in the episode &quot;Rightful Heir.&quot;

The clone was made from cells that existed from the original Kahless, but he is not made aware of the cloning process and instead tricked into thinking he is the original Kahless. In addition to being cloned, the monks used stories to imprint on his mind, thus altering his natural mind.

According to Star Trek writer Ronald D. Moore, the inspiration for the idea of bringing Kahless back was the popularity in the early 1990s of cloning with DNA, such as popularized in &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;. Then there was the idea of doing this with a person, in this case Kahless of the Klingons empire was chosen, and the concept developed from there. Previous episodes and book had established a kind of Klingon religion in the Star Trek lore, and the writing for Kahless was influenced by that.

==Novels and opera==
The non-canon novel &quot;Kahless&quot;, written by Michael Jan Friedman, gives a different version of Kahless&#x27; history. In the novel, Kahless left for Sto-vo-kor with a scroll detailing how he really brought about the creation of the new Klingon Empire. The scroll says that Kahless was a loyal soldier of Molor who killed the son of the tyrant because he was acting in a dishonorable manner. Kahless fled with his company of soldiers and was then thought of as a sort of hero to the people. However, he did not think of himself a hero. It was Morath, who was not blood-related but was still considered a brother under Klingon custom, who forced Kahless to stick with his rebellion and slay the tyrant. While Molor was indeed a strong and capable warrior, when Kahless and Morath finally met him in battle, he was severely weakened by the plague happening at the time. Kahless gave Molor his d&#x27;k tahg to commit suicide. Instead, Molor threw it at Kahless, but Morath jumped in front of the blade, after which Kahless decapitated the tyrant. Thus, the blade contains the blood of Morath who sacrificed his life for his friend, not the blood of Kahless. Moreover, the book makes clear that the supposed clone of Kahless is a clone of Morath. The novel also describes the creation of the first bat&#x27;leth. Kahless had a vision of his dead mate in Sto-vo-kor telling him to do exactly what the myth says (make the sword from his hair and lava). Instead, he draws the image of the sword and gives it to a swordsmith. Despite the scroll being proven authentic, most Klingons still see their Emperor as a semi-divine figure.

Kahless is referred-to in the 1984 tie-in novel &quot;The Final Reflection&quot; by John M. Ford. Captain Krenn tells the story to Dr Tagore, of how the Klingons have one who is not forgotten. When his ship was dying, Kahless had his hand bound to the captain&#x27;s chair, so none could say he left the bridge. The ship&#x27;s crew could then abandon the ship, because Kahless had taken on the ship&#x27;s fate. Krenn tells Tagore that&#x27;s the source of the Klingon phrase Kahlesste kaase, Kahless&#x27; hand, a swear or curse that many of the Klingons in the book utter when impressed or awed.

Kahless is the subject of an opera in the Klingon language: &quot;’u’&quot;, which debuted at The Hague in September 2010. The opera was presented in the Klingon language.
