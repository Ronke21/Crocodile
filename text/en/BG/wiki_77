<text>Adobe Dreamweaver is a proprietary web development tool from Adobe. It was created by Macromedia in 1997 and developed by them until Macromedia was acquired by Adobe Systems in 2005.

Adobe Dreamweaver is available for the macOS and Windows operating systems.

Following Adobe&#x27;s acquisition of the Macromedia product suite, releases of Dreamweaver subsequent to version 8.0 have been more compliant with W3C standards. Recent versions have improved support for Web technologies such as CSS, JavaScript, and various server-side scripting languages and frameworks including ASP (ASP JavaScript, ASP VBScript, ASP.NET C#, ASP.NET VB), ColdFusion, Scriptlet, and PHP.

== Features ==
Adobe Dreamweaver CC is a web design Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that is used to develop and design websites. Dreamweaver includes a code editor that supports syntax highlighting, code completion, real-time syntax checking, and code introspection for generating code hints to assist the user in writing code.

Dreamweaver, like other HTML editors, edits files locally then uploads them to the remote web server using FTP, SFTP, or WebDAV. Dreamweaver CS4 supports the Subversion (SVN) version control system.

Since version 5, Dreamweaver supports syntax highlighting for the following languages:
* ActionScript
* Active Server Pages (ASP).
* C#
* Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
* ColdFusion
* EDML
* Extensible HyperText Markup Language (XHTML)
* Extensible Markup Language (XML)
* Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations (XSLT)
* HyperText Markup Language (HTML)
* Java
* JavaScript
* PHP
* Visual Basic (VB)
* Visual Basic Script Edition (VBScript)
* Wireless Markup Language (WML)

Support for Active Server Pages (ASP) and JavaServer Pages was dropped in version CS5.

Users can add their language syntax highlighting.
Code completion is available for many of these languages.

== Internationalization and localization ==

=== Language availability ===
Adobe Dreamweaver CS6 is available in Brazilian Portuguese, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Czech, Dutch, English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean (Windows only), Polish, Russian, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish.

=== Specific features for Arabic and Hebrew languages ===
The older Adobe Dreamweaver CS3 also features a Middle Eastern version that allows typing Arabic, Persian, Urdu, or Hebrew text (written from right to left) within the code view. Whether the text is fully Middle Eastern (written from right to left) or includes both English and Middle Eastern text (written left to right and right to left), it will be displayed properly.

<doc id="318920" wikidata="Q2291081" url="?curid=318920" title="Dosimetry">
<text>Radiation dosimetry in the fields of health physics and radiation protection is the measurement, calculation and assessment of the ionizing radiation dose absorbed by an object, usually the human body. This applies both internally, due to ingested or inhaled radioactive substances, or externally due to irradiation by sources of radiation.

Internal dosimetry assessment relies on a variety of monitoring, bio-assay or radiation imaging techniques, whilst external dosimetry is based on measurements with a dosimeter, or inferred from measurements made by other radiological protection instruments.

Radiation dosimetry is extensively used for radiation protection; routinely applied to monitor occupational radiation workers, where irradiation is expected, or where radiation is unexpected, such as in the contained aftermath of the Three Mile Island, Chernobyl or Fukushima radiological release incidents. The public dose take-up is measured and calculated from a variety of indicators such as ambient measurements of gamma radiation, radioactive particulate monitoring, and the measurement of levels of radioactive contamination.

Other significant radiation dosimetry areas are medical, where the required treatment absorbed dose and any collateral absorbed dose is monitored, and environmental, such as radon monitoring in buildings.

==Measuring radiation dose==

===External dose===
There are several ways of measuring absorbed doses from ionizing radiation. People in occupational contact with radioactive substances, or who may be exposed to radiation, routinely carry personal dosimeters. These are specifically designed to record and indicate the dose received. Traditionally, these were lockets fastened to the external clothing of the monitored person, which contained photographic film known as film badge dosimeters. These have been largely replaced with other devices such as Thermoluminescent dosimetry(TLD), optically stimulated luminescence(OSL), or Fluorescent Nuclear Tract Detector(FNTD) badges.

The International Committee on Radiation Protection (ICRP) guidance states that if a personal dosimeter is worn on a position on the body representative of its exposure, assuming whole-body exposure, the value of Personal Dose Equivalent Hp(10), is sufficient to estimate an effective dose value suitable for radiological protection. Personal Dose Equivalent is a radiation quantity specifically designed to be used for radiation measurements by personal dosimeters. Dosimeters are known as &quot;legal dosimeters&quot; if they have been approved for use in recording personnel dose for regulatory purposes. In cases of non-uniform irradiation such personal dosimeters may not be representative of certain specific areas of the body, where additional dosimeters are used in the area of concern.

A number of electronic devices known as Electronic Personal Dosimeters (EPDs) have come into general use using semiconductor detection and programmable processor technology. These are worn as badges but can give an indication of instantaneous dose rate and an audible and visual alarm if a dose rate or a total integrated dose is exceeded. A good deal of information can be made immediately available to the wearer of the recorded dose and current dose rate via a local display. They can be used as the main stand-alone dosimeter, or as a supplement to other devices. EPD&#x27;s are particularly useful for real-time monitoring of dose where a high dose rate is expected which will time-limit the wearer&#x27;s exposure.

In certain circumstances, a dose can be inferred from readings taken by fixed instrumentation in an area in which the person concerned has been working. This would generally only be used if personal dosimetry had not been issued, or a personal dosimeter has been damaged or lost. Such calculations would take a pessimistic view of the likely received dose.

===Internal dose===

Internal dosimetry is used to evaluate the committed dose due to the intake of radionuclides into the human body.

==Medical dosimetry==

Medical dosimetry is the calculation of absorbed dose and optimization of dose delivery in radiation therapy. It is often performed by a professional health physicist with specialized training in that field. In order to plan the delivery of radiation therapy, the radiation produced by the sources is usually characterized with percentage depth dose curves and dose profiles measured by a medical physicist.

In radiation therapy, three-dimensional dose distributions are often evaluated using a technique known as gel dosimetry.

==Environmental dosimetry==
Environmental dosimetry is used where it is likely that the environment will generate a significant radiation dose. An example of this is radon monitoring. The largest single source of radiation exposure to the general public is naturally occurring radon gas, which comprises approximately 55% of the annual background dose. It is estimated that radon is responsible for 10% of lung cancers in the United States. Radon is a radioactive gas generated by the decay of uranium, which is present in varying amounts in the Earth&#x27;s crust. Certain geographic areas, due to the underlying geology, continually generate radon which permeates its way to the Earth&#x27;s surface. In some cases the dose can be significant in buildings where the gas can accumulate. A number of specialised dosimetry techniques are used to evaluate the dose that a building&#x27;s occupants may receive.

==Radiation exposure monitoring==
Records of legal dosimetry results are usually kept for a set period of time, depending upon the legal requirements of the nation in which they are used.

Medical radiation exposure monitoring is the practice of collecting dose information from radiology equipment and using the data to help identify opportunities to reduce unnecessary dose in medical situations.

==Measures of dose==


To enable consideration of stochastic health risk, calculations are performed to convert the physical quantity absorbed dose into equivalent and effective doses, the details of which depend on the radiation type and biological context. For applications in radiation protection and dosimetry assessment the (ICRP) and the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU) have published recommendations and data which are used to calculate these.

===Units of measure===
There are a number of different measures of radiation dose, including absorbed dose (&quot;D&quot;) measured in:
*gray (Gy) energy absorbed per unit of mass (J·kg−1)
*Equivalent dose (&quot;H&quot;) measured in sieverts (Sv)
*Effective dose (&quot;E&quot;) measured in sieverts
*Kerma (K) measured in grays
*dose area product (DAP) measured in gray centimeters2
*dose length product (DLP) measured in gray centimeters
*rads a deprecated unit of absorbed radiation dose, defined as 1 rad = 0.01 Gy = 0.01 J/kg
*Roentgen a legacy unit of measurement for the exposure of X-rays

Each measure is often simply described as ‘dose’, which can lead to confusion. Non-SI units are still used, particularly in the USA, where dose is often reported in rads and dose equivalent in rems. By definition, 1 Gy = 100 rad and 1 Sv = 100 rem.

The fundamental quantity is the absorbed dose (&quot;D&quot;), which is defined as the mean energy imparted [by ionising radiation] (dE) per unit mass (dm) of material (D = dE/dm) The SI unit of absorbed dose is the gray (Gy) defined as one joule per kilogram. Absorbed dose, as a point measurement, is suitable for describing localised (i.e. partial organ) exposures such as tumour dose in radiotherapy. It may be used to estimate stochastic risk provided the amount and type of tissue involved is stated. Localised diagnostic dose levels are typically in the 0–50 mGy range. At a dose of 1 milligray (mGy) of photon radiation, each cell nucleus is crossed by an average of 1 liberated electron track.

===Equivalent dose===

The absorbed dose required to produce a certain biological effect varies between different types of radiation, such as photons, neutrons or alpha particles. This is taken into account by the equivalent dose (H), which is defined as the mean dose to organ T by radiation type R (&quot;D&quot;T,R), multiplied by a weighting factor &quot;W&quot;R . This designed to take into account the biological effectiveness (RBE) of the radiation type, For instance, for the same absorbed dose in Gy, alpha particles are 20 times as biologically potent as X or gamma rays. The measure of ‘dose equivalent’ is not organ averaged and now only used for &quot;operational quantities&quot;. Equivalent dose is designed for estimation of stochastic risks from radiation exposures. Stochastic effect is defined for radiation dose assessment as the &quot;probability&quot; of cancer induction and genetic damage.

As dose is averaged over the whole organ; equivalent dose is rarely suitable for evaluation of acute radiation effects or tumour dose in radiotherapy. In the case of estimation of stochastic effects, assuming a linear dose response, this averaging out should make no difference as the total energy imparted remains the same.

===Effective dose===
Effective dose is the central dose quantity for radiological protection used to specify exposure limits to ensure that the occurrence of stochastic health effects is kept below unacceptable levels and that tissue reactions are avoided.

It is difficult to compare the stochastic risk from localised exposures of different parts of the body (e.g. a chest x-ray compared to a CT scan of the head), or to compare exposures of the same body part but with different exposure patterns (e.g. a cardiac CT scan with a cardiac nuclear medicine scan). One way to avoid this problem is to simply average out a localised dose over the whole body. The problem of this approach is that the stochastic risk of cancer induction varies from one tissue to another.

The effective dose &quot;E&quot; is designed to account for this variation by the application of specific weighting factors for each tissue (&quot;W&quot;T). Effective dose provides the equivalent whole body dose that gives the same risk as the localised exposure. It is defined as the sum of equivalent doses to each organ (&quot;H&quot;T), each multiplied by its respective tissue weighting factor (&quot;W&quot;T).

Weighting factors are calculated by the International Commission for Radiological Protection (ICRP), based on the risk of cancer induction for each organ and adjusted for associated lethality, quality of life and years of life lost. Organs that are remote from the site of irradiation will only receive a small equivalent dose (mainly due to scattering) and therefore contribute little to the effective dose, even if the weighting factor for that organ is high.

Effective dose is used to estimate stochastic risks for a ‘reference’ person, which is an average of the population. It is not suitable for estimating stochastic risk for individual medical exposures, and is not used to assess acute radiation effects.

==Dose versus source or field strength==
Radiation dose refers to the amount of energy deposited in matter and/or biological effects of radiation, and should not be confused with the unit of radioactive activity (becquerel, Bq) of the source of radiation, or the strength of the radiation field (fluence). The article on the sievert gives an overview of dose types and how they are calculated. Exposure to a source of radiation will give a dose which is dependent on many factors, such as the activity, duration of exposure, energy of the radiation emitted, distance from the source and amount of shielding.

===Background radiation===
The worldwide average background dose for a human being is about 3.5 mSv per year , mostly from cosmic radiation and natural isotopes in the earth. The largest single source of radiation exposure to the general public is naturally occurring radon gas, which comprises approximately 55% of the annual background dose. It is estimated that radon is responsible for 10% of lung cancers in the United States.

===Calibration standards for measuring instruments===
Because the human body is approximately 70% water and has an overall density close to 1 g/cm3, dose measurement is usually calculated and calibrated as dose to water.

National standards laboratories such as the National Physical Laboratory, UK (NPL) provide calibration factors for ionization chambers and other measurement devices to convert from the instrument&#x27;s readout to absorbed dose. The standards laboratories operates as a primary standard, which is normally calibrated by absolute calorimetry (the warming of substances when they absorb energy). A user sends their secondary standard to the laboratory, where it is exposed to a known amount of radiation (derived from the primary standard) and a factor is issued to convert the instrument&#x27;s reading to that dose. The user may then use their secondary standard to derive calibration factors for other instruments they use, which then become tertiary standards, or field instruments.

The NPL operates a graphite-calorimeter for absolute photon dosimetry. Graphite is used instead of water as its specific heat capacity is one-sixth that of water and therefore the temperature increase in graphite is 6 times higher than the equivalent in water and measurements are more accurate. Significant problems exist in insulating the graphite from the surrounding environment in order to measure the tiny temperature changes. A lethal dose of radiation to a human is approximately 10–20 Gy. This is 10–20 joules per kilogram. A 1 cm3 piece of graphite weighing 2 grams would therefore absorb around 20–40 mJ. With a specific heat capacity of around 700 J·kg−1·K−1, this equates to a temperature rise of just 20 mK.

Dosimeters in radiotherapy (linear particle accelerator in external beam therapy) are routinely calibrated using ionization chambers or diode technology or gel dosimeters.

==Radiation-related quantities==
The following table shows radiation quantities in SI and non-SI units.
Although the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission permits the use of the units curie, rad, and rem alongside SI units, the European Union European units of measurement directives required that their use for &quot;public health ... purposes&quot; be phased out by 31 December 1985.

<text>ihug was New Zealand&#x27;s third largest ISP (behind Xtra and TelstraClear), before it was bought, then absorbed by Vodafone New Zealand (the country&#x27;s largest mobile phone operator, later renamed One NZ). According to 2005 estimates, it had over 100,000 internet and phone subscribers. Before 2000 ihug was New Zealand&#x27;s largest ISP but as other ISPs began offering flat rate services, some customers opted to transfer to those providers.

ihug originally stood for Internet Home Users Group, even though the name was seldom used. It was also known as &quot;The Internet Group&quot; or &#x27;TIG&#x27; in Australia. ihug was sold to iiNet in 2003 before being sold to Vodafone in 2006 after interest from then Television New Zealand subsidiary THL and competitor Orcon. Its headquarters were in Auckland, New Zealand. The former CEO was Mark Rushworth, who became Manager of Marketing at Vodafone NZ.

The company also ran a small subscription television service in Auckland for a short period.

After Vodafone retired the ihug brand in April 2008, existing customers were moved to Vodafone&#x27;s own internet services, although customers had the choice of retaining their email addresses until Vodafone later stopped providing email services.

<text>Stabæk Fotball is a Norwegian professional football club based in Bærum, a suburb of Oslo. It is part of the multi-sport organization Stabæk IF. Founded in 1912, the club&#x27;s name is an archaic spelling of the suburban area Stabekk, from which it once originated. The club currently competes in the Norwegian first division, the second tier of Football in Norway. Their home stadium is the Nadderud Stadion after a three-year-long stay at the Telenor Arena. Their current chairman is Espen Moe. Bob Bradley is the current head coach of the club since taking over for the 2023 season.

== History ==
After years of lean seasons, they won their first title in 1998 as they emerged victorious in the Norwegian Cup, beating Rosenborg BK 3–1 in the final. After having been relegated to 1. divisjon after a poor 2004 season, they experienced a successful period under new manager Jan Jönsson, during which they returned to the league in 2005, won the 2008 Tippeligaen, their first, and reached the final of the Norwegian Cup, culminating in a very successful 2008 season for the club. Stabæk subsequently won the 2009 Norwegian Super Cup but finished a disappointing 12th and 10th place in the 2010 and 2011 league seasons, respectively, thus narrowly avoiding relegation both times.

Stabæk holds longstanding rivalries with Bærum SK, FK Lyn and Vålerenga, both in the league and by geographical location. The team&#x27;s home colors, entirely blue, have earned them the nickname “De Blaa” (The Blue Ones). In 2009, Stabæk became the first Norwegian association football club with both their men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s teams in the premier divisions. Lillestrøm followed suit the next year.

On 30 November 2015, Billy McKinlay was appointed as manager of the club on a two-year contract. McKinlay resigned as manager on 8 July 2016, after being knocked out of the UEFA Europa League by Welsh club Connah&#x27;s Quay Nomads.

In the 2021 Eliteserien season, Stabæk finished in 15th place, resulting in relegation to the Norwegian First Division for the first time since 2012.

== Stadium ==
Stabæk played home games at the Nadderud Stadion until 2008. They then moved into the Telenor Arena, which had a capacity of 15,000 people. Their stay at the Telenor Arena became shorter than desired; after a three-year-long stay at the indoor arena, they moved back to the Nadderud Stadion due to economic issues with the new arena. The women&#x27;s team, Stabæk FK, also currently plays home games at Nadderud Stadion. Nadderud Stadion has a capacity of 4,938 spectators.

The club&#x27;s record home attendance was set on 13 September 2009, when 13,402 spectators attended Telenor Arena to watch a game against Rosenborg BK. The record attendance at Nadderud Stadion of approximately 10,000 spectators dates from the quarter-final of the 1970 Norwegian Cup, a game Stabæk lost 2–4 against Strømsgodset.

== Chairman ==
On 4 February 2010, Einar Schultz was elected chairman of Stabæk, replacing Ingebrigt Steen Jensen. Schultz has held various positions in the Stabæk system over the last five years. In February 2012, Kjell Johnsen was elected the new chairman of Stabæk Fotball. Johnsen was replaced in 2013 by Espen Moe.

<doc id="318936" wikidata="Q284641" url="?curid=318936" title="Timon of Athens">
<text>The Life of Tymon of Athens, often shortened to Timon of Athens, is a play written by William Shakespeare and likely also Thomas Middleton in about 1606. It was published in the &quot;First Folio&quot; in 1623. Timon lavishes his wealth on parasitic companions until he is poor and rejected by them. He then denounces all of mankind, and isolates himself in a cave in the wilderness.

The earliest-known production of the play was in 1674, when Thomas Shadwell wrote an adaptation under the title &quot;The History of Timon of Athens, The Man-hater&quot;. Multiple other adaptations followed over the next century, by writers such as Thomas Hull, James Love and Richard Cumberland.
The straight Shakespearean text was performed at Smock Alley in Dublin in 1761, but adaptations continued to dominate the stage until well into the 20th century.

&quot;Timon of Athens&quot; was originally grouped with the tragedies, but recently some scholars name it as one of the problem plays.

==Synopsis==

Timon is a wealthy and generous Athenian gentleman. He hosts a large banquet, attended by nearly all of Athens. Timon gives away money wastefully, and everyone around him pleases him to receive more, except for Apemantus, a churlish philosopher &quot;(whose name means &quot;feeling no pain&quot;)&quot; whose cynicism Timon cannot yet appreciate. He accepts art from a poet and a painter, and a jewel from a jeweler, only to later give his jewel away to another friend. Timon&#x27;s servant, Lucilius, has been wooing the daughter of an old Athenian. The Athenian is furious with Lucilius&#x27; flirting, as a result, but Timon pays him three talents to fund for the couple&#x27;s marriage, because the happiness of his servant is worth the price. Timon is told that his friend, Ventidius, is in debtors&#x27; prison. He sends money to pay for Ventidius&#x27;s debt, and Ventidius is released and attends Timon&#x27;s banquet. Timon gives a speech on the value of friendship, and later, the guests are entertained by a masque, followed by dancing. As the party winds down, Timon continues to wastefully give away to his friends: his horses, as well as other possessions. The act is divided rather arbitrarily into two scenes, but the experimental and/or unfinished nature of the play is reflected in that it does not naturally break into a five-act structure.

Unbeknownst to him, Timon has given away all his wealth, and is deep in debt. Flavius, Timon&#x27;s steward, is upset by the way Timon is spending his wealth; overextending his munificence by showering patronage over parasitic writers and artists, and saving his dubious friends from their financial straits; Flavius confronts Timon when he returns from a hunt. Timon is upset that Flavius did not warn him of his debt before, and begins to direct his anger onto Flavius, who says that he has tried repeatedly in the past without success, and now he is at the end: all of Timon&#x27;s land has been sold. Shadowing Timon is another guest at the banquet: Apemantus, who terrorises Timon&#x27;s shallow companions with his caustic raillery. Along with a Fool, he attacks Timon&#x27;s creditors when they show up to make their demands for immediate payment. Timon has no money to repay his debt, thus he sends out his servants to request for money from those friends he considers closest.

Timon&#x27;s servants are turned down, one by one, by Timon&#x27;s false friends. Elsewhere, one of Alcibiades&#x27;s junior officers, in a rage, kills a man in &quot;hot blood&quot;. Alcibiades pleads with the Senate for his mercy, arguing that a crime of passion should not carry as severe a sentence as premeditated murder. The senators disagree, and, when Alcibiades persists, banish him forever. Alcibiades vows to seek revenge, with the support of his troops. The act finishes with Timon discussing with his servants the revenge he will carry out at his next banquet.

Timon hosts a smaller party, intended only for those he feels have betrayed him. The serving trays are brought in, only to reveal that the trays contain rocks and lukewarm water. Timon ambushes his false friends and flees Athens. The loyal Flavius vows to find him.

Cursing the city walls, Timon goes into the wilderness and makes his crude home in a cave, sustaining himself on roots. Here he discovers an underground trove of gold. The knowledge of his discovery spreads. Alcibiades, Apemantus, and three bandits are able to find Timon before Flavius does. Accompanying Alcibiades are two prostitutes, Phrynia and Timandra, who trade barbs with the bitter Timon on the subject of venereal disease. Timon offers most of the gold to the rebel Alcibiades to subsidise his assault on the city, which Timon now wants to see destroyed, as his experiences have reduced him to misanthropy. He gives the rest to his whores, to spread disease, and much of the remainder to the poet and the painter, who arrive soon after, leaving little for the senators who visit him. Apemantus appears and accuses Timon of copying his pessimistic ways, and there is a mutually misanthropic exchange of invective.

Flavius arrives. Flavius asks Timon for money as well, but also asks for Timon to return to society. Timon acknowledges that he has had one true friend in Flavius, a shining example of an otherwise diseased and impure race, but laments that Flavius is a mere servant. He invites the last set of envoys from Athens, who hoped Timon might placate Alcibiades, to go hang themselves, and then dies in the wilderness. Alcibiades, marching on Athens, throws down his glove, and ends the play reading the bitter epitaph Timon wrote for himself, part of which was composed by Callimachus:
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 2em;&quot;&gt;
Here lies a wretched corpse of wretched soul bereft:
Seek not my name: a plague consume you wicked caitiffs left!
Here lie I, Timon, who alive, all living men did hate,
Pass by, and curse thy fill, but pass and stay not here thy gait.
&lt;/poem&gt;

==Date and text==
The play&#x27;s date is uncertain, though its bitter tone links it with &quot;Coriolanus&quot; and &quot;King Lear.&quot; John Day&#x27;s play &quot;Humour Out of Breath,&quot; published in 1608, contains a reference to &quot;the lord that gave all to his followers, and begged more for himself&quot;a possible allusion to &quot;Timon&quot; that would, if valid, support a date of composition before 1608. It has been proposed that Shakespeare himself took the role of the Poet, who has the fifth-largest line count in the play.

The play was entered into the Stationers&#x27; Register in 1623. There are no contemporary allusions to the play by which its date of composition may be determined, nor is there an agreed means of explaining the play&#x27;s &quot;loose ends and inconsistencies&quot;. Editors since the twentieth century have sought to remedy these defects through conjectures about Shakespeare&#x27;s emotional development (Chambers); hypotheses concerning the play&#x27;s &quot;unfinished state&quot; (Ellis-Fermor) and &quot;scribal interference&quot; (Oliver); and through statistical analyses of vocabulary, stage directions, and so forth.

Assuming the play is a collaboration between Shakespeare and Middleton, its date has been placed in the period 1605–1608, most likely 1606.
In his 2004 edition for the Oxford Shakespeare, John Jowett argues the lack of act divisions in the &quot;Folio&quot; text is an important factor in determining a date. The King&#x27;s Men only began to use act divisions in their scripts when they occupied the indoor Blackfriars Theatre in August 1608 as their winter playhouse. &quot;Timon&quot; is notoriously difficult to divide into acts, suggesting to Jowett that it was written at a time when act divisions were of no concern to the writer, hence it must have been written prior to August 1608. A &quot;terminus post quem&quot; may come from a possible topical allusion to the Gunpowder Plot of November 1605; &quot;those that under hot ardent zeal would set whole realms on fire&quot; (scene 7, 32–33). In the context of the play, the line is referring to religious zeal, but some scholars feel it is a subtle reference to the events of November.
The play may also have been influenced by a pamphlet published in June 1605, &quot;Two Unnatural and Bloody Murders&quot;, which served as the primary source for Thomas Middleton&#x27;s &quot;A Yorkshire Tragedy&quot;. This would narrow the possible range of dates to sometime between November 1605 and August 1608. Furthermore, MacDonald P. Jackson&#x27;s rare-word test found the conjectured Shakespearean parts of the text date to 1605–1606. Going further, Jackson found that if one examines the non-Shakespearean sections in the context of Middleton&#x27;s career, a date of 1605–1606 also results.

== Sources ==
Shakespeare, in writing the play, probably drew upon the twenty-eighth novella of William Painter&#x27;s &quot;Palace of Pleasure&quot;, the thirty-eighth novella of which was the main source for his &quot;All&#x27;s Well That Ends Well&quot;. He also drew upon Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Lives&quot;, and perhaps Lucian&#x27;s &quot;Dialogues&quot; and a lost comedy on the subject of Timon, allusions to which survive from 1584.

==Authorship==

Since the nineteenth century, suggestions have been made that &quot;Timon&quot; is the work of two writers, and it has been argued that the play&#x27;s unusual features are the result of the play being co-authored by playwrights with very different mentalities; the most popular candidate, Thomas Middleton, was first suggested in 1920.

The play contains several narrative inconsistencies uncharacteristic of Shakespeare, an unusually unsatisfying &quot;dénouement&quot;, drastically different styles in different places and an unusually large number of long lines that do not scan. One theory is that the play as it appears in the &quot;First Folio&quot; is unfinished. E. K. Chambers believes Shakespeare began the play, but abandoned it due to a mental breakdown, never returning to finish it. F. W. Brownlow believes the play to have been Shakespeare&#x27;s last, and remained uncompleted at his death.
The now-predominant theory of collaborative authorship
was proposed by Charles Knight in 1838.
Today, many scholars believe that other dramatist was Thomas Middleton. However, the exact nature of the collaboration is disputed. Did Middleton revise a piece begun by Shakespeare, did Shakespeare revise Middleton&#x27;s work, or did they work together? John Jowett, editor of the play for both the &quot;Oxford Shakespeare: Complete Works&quot; and the individual Oxford Shakespeare edition, believes Middleton worked with Shakespeare in an understudy capacity and wrote scenes 2 (1.2 in editions which divide the play into acts), 5 (3.1), 6 (3.2), 7 (3.3), 8 (3.4), 9 (3.5), 10 (3.6) and the last eighty lines of 14 (4.3).

A 1917 study by J. M. Robertson posited that George Chapman wrote &quot;A Lover&#x27;s Complaint&quot; and was the originator of &quot;Timon of Athens&quot;. These claims were rejected by other commentators, including Bertolt Brecht, Frank Harris, and Rolf Soellner (1979), who thought the play was a theatrical experiment. They argued that if one playwright revised another&#x27;s play it would have been &quot;fixed&quot; to the standards of Jacobean theatre, which is clearly not the case. Soellner believed the play is unusual because it was written to be performed at the Inns of Court, where it would have found a niche audience with young lawyers.

Linguistic analyses of the text have all discovered apparent confirmation of the theory that Middleton wrote much of the play. It contains numerous words, phrases, and punctuation choices that are characteristic of his work but rare in Shakespeare. These linguistic markers cluster in certain scenes, apparently indicating that the play is a collaboration between Middleton and Shakespeare, not a revision of one&#x27;s work by the other.
The evidence suggests that Middleton wrote around one third of the play, mostly the central scenes. The editor of the Oxford edition, John Jowett, states that Middleton,

wrote the banquet scene (Sc. 2), the central scenes with Timon&#x27;s creditors and Alcibiades&#x27; confrontation with the senate, and most of the episodes figuring the Steward. The play&#x27;s abrasively harsh humour and its depiction of social relationships that involve a denial of personal relationships are Middletonian traits[.]

Jowett stresses that Middleton&#x27;s presence does not mean the play should be disregarded, stating &quot;&quot;Timon of Athens&quot; is all the more interesting because the text articulates a dialogue between two dramatists of a very different temper.&quot;

==Analysis and criticism==
Many scholars find much unfinished about this play including unexplained plot developments, characters who appear unexplained and say little, prose sections that a polished version would have in verse (although close analysis would show this to be almost exclusively in the lines of Apemantus, and probably an intentional character trait), and the two epitaphs, one of which doubtless would have been cancelled in the final version. However, similar duplications appear in &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; and &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot; and are generally thought to be examples of two versions being printed when only one was ultimately used in production, which could easily be the case here. Frank Kermode refers to the play as &quot;a poor relation of the major tragedies.&quot; This is the majority view, but the play has many scholarly defenders as well. Nevertheless, and perhaps unsurprisingly due to its subject matter, it has not proven to be among Shakespeare&#x27;s popular works.

An anonymous play, &quot;Timon,&quot; also survives. In this adaptation, Timon is explicitly hedonistic and spends his money much more on himself than in Shakespeare&#x27;s version. He also has a mistress. It mentions a London inn called The Seven Stars that did not exist before 1602, yet it contains elements that are in Shakespeare&#x27;s play but not in Plutarch or in Lucian&#x27;s dialogue, &quot;Timon the Misanthrope,&quot; the other major accepted source for Shakespeare&#x27;s play. Both Jacobean plays deal extensively with Timon&#x27;s life before his flight into the wilderness, which in both Greek versions is given little more than one sentence each.

Soellner (1979) argues that the play is equal parts tragedy and satire, but that neither term can adequately be used as an adjective, for it is first and foremost a tragedy, and it does not satirise tragedy; rather, it satirises its subjects in the manner of Juvenalian satire while simultaneously being a tragedy.

Herman Melville considered &quot;Timon&quot; to be among the most profound of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays, and in his 1850 review &quot;Hawthorne and His Mosses&quot; writes that Shakespeare is not &quot;a mere man of Richard-the-Third humps, and Macbeth daggers,&quot; but rather &quot;it is those deep far-away things in him; those occasional flashings-forth of the intuitive Truth in him; those short, quick probings at the very axis of reality: these are the things that make Shakespeare, Shakespeare. Through the mouths of the dark characters of Hamlet, Timon, Lear, and Iago, he craftily says, or sometimes insinuates the things, which we feel to be so terrifically true, that it were all but madness for any good man, in his own proper character, to utter, or even hint of them.&quot; In his 1590 &quot;Greene&#x27;s Mourning Garment&quot;, Robert Greene used the term &quot;&quot; to refer to a lonely misanthrope. In his 1852 novel &quot;&quot;, Melville used the term &quot;&quot; about an artist&#x27;s contemptuous rejection of both his audience and mankind in general.

Appreciation of the play often pivots on the reader&#x27;s perception of Timon&#x27;s asceticism. Admirers like Soellner point out that Shakespeare&#x27;s text has Timon neither drink wine nor eat meat: only water and roots are specifically mentioned as being in his diet, which is also true of Apemantus. If one sees Timon&#x27;s parties not as mere excuses to have fun, but as vain attempts to genuinely win friends among his peers, he gains sympathy. This is true of Pryce&#x27;s Timon in the television version mentioned below, whose plate is explicitly shown as being perpetually unsoiled by food, and he tends to be meek and modest. This suggests a Timon who lives in the world but not of it. Other versions, often by creators who regard the play as a lesser work, involve jazz-era swinging (sometimes, such as in the Michael Langham/Brian Bedford production (in which Timon eats flamingo) set to a score that Duke Ellington composed for it in the 1960s), and conclude the first act with a debauchery. The Arkangel Shakespeare audio recording featuring Alan Howard (with Rodway reprising his television role) also takes this route: Howard&#x27;s line readings suggest that Timon is getting drunker and drunker during the first act; he does not represent the moral or idealistic figure betrayed by the petty perceived by Soellner and Brecht the way Pryce does.

===Themes and motifs===
Major motifs in &quot;Timon&quot; include dogs, breath, gold (from act IV on), and &quot;use&quot; (in the sense of usury). One of the most common emendations of the play is the Poet&#x27;s line &quot;Our Poesie Is as a Gowne, which uses From whence &#x27;tis nourisht&quot;, to &quot;our poesy is as a gum, which oozes from whence &#x27;tis nourished&quot; (originated by Pope and Johnson). Soellner says that such emendations erode the importance of this motif, and suggests a better emendation would be &quot;from&quot; to &quot;form,&quot; creating a mixed metaphor &quot;revelatory of the poet&#x27;s inanity.&quot;

One odd emendation that often appears near the end of the play is Alcibiades commanding his troops to &quot;cull th&#x27; infected fourth&quot; from the Senate, as if he intends to destroy a fourth of the Senate. The word in the folio is, in fact, &quot;forth&quot;, suggesting that &quot;th&#x27; infected&quot; are simply the ones who argued strongly against the cases of Timon and Alicibiades&#x27;s officer, and that the troops are to leave alone those who just went along with it.

Banquets and feasting in Shakespeare are dramatically significant; besides sometimes being of central and structural importance, they often present dramatic spectacles in themselves. The first banquet of Timon of Athens reflects contemporary understandings of lavish Athenian entertainment at which Timon celebrates friendship and society. All the citizens are welcome to the banquet, as in accordance with the democratic principles of Athens. The second banquet functions as a parody of the first, as Timon uses it to exact revenge on his false friends, before abandoning feasting and the city completely by exiling himself. The senses are absent from this feast: Timon mocks the insatiable appetite of his guests as he uncovers dishes of smoke and water. Timon is misled by facades of friendship, and so inflicts apropos revenge: misleading those that had misled him by having them suffer the disillusionment of mortal senses with the mere spectacle of a banquet.

Shakespeare includes the character of Alcibiades in the play, the ultimate redeemer of iniquitous Athens. He would have been known among the educated of the audience for his presence at the Greek banquet in Plato&#x27;s &quot;Symposium&quot; at which he gets the last word on the nature of love, proposing that it cannot be found in superficial appearance.

==Performance history==
Performance history in Shakespeare&#x27;s lifetime is unknown, though the same is also true of his more highly regarded plays such as&quot; Antony and Cleopatra&quot; and &quot;Coriolanus,&quot; which most scholars believe were written in the same period.

The earliest known performance of the straight Shakespearean text was at Smock Alley Theatre in Dublin in 1761.
The earliest-known production of a predominantly Shakespearean version of the play in the United Kingdom was at Sadler&#x27;s Wells in 1851.

It has played once on Broadway, at the Lyceum Theatre in 1993, with Brian Bedford in the title role. This was a production of The Public Theater, which revived the play in February 2011 with Richard Thomas in the lead role, citing it as a play for the Great Recession.

The Chicago Shakespeare Theater first staged the play in 1997. It was the company&#x27;s first modern-dress production. In April 2012, C.S.T. again staged the play with the Scottish actor Ian McDiarmid playing Timon. The play was given a new ending by director Barbara Gaines.

In August 2011, the Hudson Shakespeare Company of New Jersey staged &quot;Timon of Athens&quot; as part of their summer Shakespeare in the Parks series. As a departure from several other modern dress productions, director Jon Ciccarelli set the action in the &quot;Roaring 20s&quot; with corrupt politicians, mobsters and making the characters of Alcibiades, Timon of Athens and Flavius veterans of World War I. Timon (Imran Sheikh) was portrayed as a &#x27;Great Gatsby&#x27; type figure who loses his great fortune to corrupt &quot;friends&quot;.

In July 2012 the British National Theatre produced a version of the play set in modern dress and in the present time of scandal and fraud in the City of London and the British media. The play was directed by Nicholas Hytner. The National Theatre production was broadcast live to cinemas worldwide on 1 November 2012 as part of the National Theatre Live programme.

From 7 December 2018 to 22 February 2019 the play was revived by the Royal Shakespeare Company in a version directed by Simon Godwin, also in modern dress and featuring contemporary visual allusions, starring Kathryn Hunter as Lady Timon, one of several gender changes. Hunter and Godwin&#x27;s version also had a run in New York City at Theatre for a New Audience in Brooklyn. The show opened on 19 January 2020, and ran through 9 February 2020. The following month the production played at the Shakespeare Theater Company&#x27;s Kline Theatre in Washington DC.

In 2024 the Australian Sport for Jove Theatre Company produced a version called &quot;I Hate People; or Timon of Athens&quot;, directed by Margaret Thanos and starring the company&#x27;s artistic director Damien Ryan, at the Everglades, Leura. The production was described by &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; as the &quot;pinnacle of Shakespeare in Sydney this century&quot;.

==Adaptations==

===TV adaptations===
Rarely performed, &quot;Timon of Athens&quot; was produced for TV as part of the BBC Television Shakespeare series in 1981 with Jonathan Pryce as Timon, Norman Rodway as Apemantus, John Welsh as Flavius, and John Shrapnel as Alcibiades, with Diana Dors as Timandra, Tony Jay as the Merchant, Sebastian Shaw as the Old Athenian, and John Fortune and John Bird as Poet and Painter. This Elizabethan/Jacobean historical period drama production was directed by Jonathan Miller.

===Film adaptations===
&quot;I, Timon&quot; was released in 2016 premiered at the 2017 Hoboken International Film Festival (where it was nominated for &quot;Best Director&quot; and &quot;Best Cinematography&quot;). Bramwell Noah appears in the title role (and is also responsible for the original adaptation of the play for the big screen). The film also features a soundtrack based on the musical score Hexachordum Apollinis by Johann Pachelbel.

===Play adaptations===
In 1678 Thomas Shadwell produced a popular adaptation, &quot;The History of Timon of Athens, the Man-Hater,&quot; to which Henry Purcell later composed the music. Shadwell added two women to the plot: Melissa, Timon&#x27;s faithless fiancee, and Evandre, his loyal and discarded mistress. James Dance made another adaptation in 1768, soon followed by Richard Cumberland&#x27;s version at Drury Lane in 1771, in which the dying Timon gives his daughter, Evadne, not present in Shakespeare&#x27;s original, to Alcibiades.

Further adaptations followed in 1786 (Thomas Hull&#x27;s at Covent Garden) and 1816 (George Lamb&#x27;s at Drury Lane), ending with an 1851 production reinstating Shakespeare&#x27;s original text by Samuel Phelps at Sadler&#x27;s Wells.

Peter Brook directed a French-language production in the sixties in which Timon was portrayed as an innocent idealist in a white tuxedo, ripped and dishevelled in the second part. His cast was primarily young, and Apemantus was Algerian. Commentators who admire the play typically see Timon as intended to have been a young man behaving in a naïve way. The play&#x27;s detractors usually cite an oblique reference to armour in act IV as evidence that Timon is a long-retired soldier.

British playwright Glyn Cannon wrote a short adaptation of the play called &quot;Timon&#x27;s Daughter&quot;. It premiered in May, 2008 at the Old Fitzroy Theatre in Sydney. Cannon&#x27;s play revisits the major themes of charity and giving in the original work, with a story that follows the adventures of Timon&#x27;s daughter (named &quot;Alice&quot; in Cannon&#x27;s play) when she is taken in by Flavius (renamed &quot;Alan&quot;).

===Musical versions===
Shadwell&#x27;s adaptation of the play was first performed with music by Louis Grabu in 1678. More famously, the 1695 revival had new music by Henry Purcell, most of it appearing in the masque that ended act 2. Duke Ellington was commissioned to compose original music for the Stratford Shakespeare Festival&#x27;s first production of &quot;Timon of Athens&quot; in 1963. Stephen Oliver, who wrote the incidental music for the BBC television version, composed a two-act opera, &quot;Timon of Athens&quot;, which was first performed at the London Coliseum on 17 May 1991.

==Cultural references==
Ralph Waldo Emerson alludes to Timon in &quot;&quot; (1844) in an essay entitled &quot;Gifts.&quot; Emerson says, &quot;This giving is flat usurpation, and therefore when the beneficiary is ungrateful, as all beneficiaries hate all Timons … I rather sympathize with the beneficiary, than with the anger of my lord Timon.&quot;

Karl Marx discusses and quotes Timon in his &quot;Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844&quot; and &quot;Das Kapital, Volume I&quot;. Marx&#x27;s analysis focuses on how passages from &quot;Timon of Athens&quot; (act IV, scene III) shed light on the nature and amoral power of money:
# &quot;It is the visible divinity – the transformation of all human and natural properties into their contraries, the universal confounding and distorting of things: impossibilities are soldered together by it.&quot;
# &quot;It is the common whore, the common procurer of people and nations.&quot;

Charlotte Brontë includes an allusion to Timon in &quot;Villette&quot; (1853). Ginevra Fanshawe affectionately nicknames Lucy &quot;Timon,&quot; which highlights Ginevra&#x27;s role as a foil for Lucy. Herman Melville references Timon repeatedly in his novel &quot;The Confidence-Man&quot; (1857), when referring to confidence as a preferable trait in all circumstances to misanthropy. Charles Dickens alludes to Timon in &quot;Great Expectations&quot; (1861) when Wopsle moves to London to pursue a life in the theatre. Thomas Hardy alludes to Timon in his short story, &quot;The Three Strangers&quot; (1883).

The English artist and writer Wyndham Lewis produced one work of art, a portfolio of drawings titled &quot;Timon of Athens&quot; (1913), a preliminary example of the style of art that would come to be called Vorticist.

Danish author Karen Blixen (Isak Dinesen) has a story within the tale titled &quot;The Deluge of Norderney&quot; in her &quot;Seven Gothic Tales&quot; (1934). It tells about a Hamlet-like figure, called Timon of Assens , who comes from the Danish town of Assens.

Vladimir Nabokov borrowed the title for his novel &quot;Pale Fire&quot; (1962) from this quotation of Timon&#x27;s in act IV, scene III:
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;The sun&#x27;s a thief, and with his great attraction
Robs the vast sea: the moon&#x27;s an arrant thief,
And her pale fire she snatches from the sun...&lt;/poem&gt;
A copy of &quot;Timon of Athens&quot; features variously in the plot of &quot;Pale Fire&quot; and, at one point, the quotation above is amusingly mistranslated from the fictional language of Zemblan, a trademark prank of the polyglot Nabokov. The theme of thievery to which Timon is alluding is also a principal theme of &quot;Pale Fire&quot;, referring to Charles Kinbote&#x27;s misappropriation of the poem by the deceased John Shade that forms part of the novel&#x27;s structure.

<text>Ferdinand Anton Ernst Porsche (19 September 1909 – 27 March 1998), mainly known as Ferry Porsche, was an Austrian-German technical automobile designer and automaker-entrepreneur. He operated Porsche AG in Stuttgart, Germany. His father, Ferdinand Porsche Sr. was also a renowned automobile engineer and founder of Volkswagen and Porsche. His nephew, Ferdinand Piëch, was the longtime chairman of Volkswagen Group, and his son, Ferdinand Alexander Porsche, was involved in the design of the 911.

Ferry Porsche&#x27;s life was intimately connected with that of his father, Ferdinand Porsche Sr., who began sharing his knowledge of mechanical engineering already in his childhood. With his father he opened a bureau of automobile design, in Stuttgart in 1931.

The Volkswagen Beetle was designed by Ferdinand Porsche Sr. and a team of engineers, including Ferry Porsche.

After World War II, while his father remained imprisoned in France being accused of war crimes, Ferry Porsche ran their company. Aided by the postwar Volkswagen enterprise, he created the first cars that were uniquely associated with the company. Despite the political-economical adversities of the postwar years, the company manufactured automobiles and, eventually, became a major sports car manufacturer.

==Early life==
Ferdinand Porsche Sr. was chief designer at Austro-Daimler in Austria. His designs were focused on compact street cars and race cars. Austro-Daimler was so strongly tied to the local royalty that the Austrian double-headed eagle became the trademark of the company. The day Ferry Porsche was born, his father was competing with one of his race cars (called the Maja) at Semmering, finishing first in his class. He found out about his son&#x27;s birth by telegram.

Ferry Porsche&#x27;s mother was Aloisia Johanna Kaes. He had an older sister, Louise Piëch, who was five years his senior. He was baptized Ferdinand Anton Ernst Porsche, with the name Ferdinand after his father, the name Anton after his grandfather, and the name Ernst after his uncle on his mother&#x27;s side. Early in his childhood he picked up the nickname &quot;Ferry&quot; rather than the usual nickname &quot;Ferdy&quot;, as Ferdy reminded his parents too much of a typical coachman nickname — a profession that, coincidentally, was made obsolete by the family&#x27;s work.

During the following years, the family moved around a lot. He and his father spent much time together in workshops where he began early to learn about mechanical engineering. They also used to tour around Europe and the United States of America, where they raced the cars they designed.

Ferry remarked later, &quot;...cars were my greatest passion from the very beginning.&quot;. For example, on Christmas Eve of 1920, Ferry Porsche was originally misled by his parents, who first presented him with a miniature coach pulled by a goat, while his real present was a petrol-driven miniature car with a four-stroke, two-cylinder engine specially designed by his father. Ferry Porsche learned to drive when he was only 10 years old. At age 12 he drove a real race car, the Austro-Daimler Sascha, which had just won its class at Targa Florio, Sicily, in 1922.

Ferry Porsche attended school at Wiener Neustadt and Stuttgart, concentrating on mathematics.

==Move to Stuttgart==
In 1923, the family moved to Stuttgart, due to senior Ferdinand Porsche&#x27;s unrest about the poor financial condition of Austro-Daimler. He joined the Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft at Stuttgart-Untertürkheim (where the design department from the whole company was concentrated). Soon, he achieved the position of technical director.

Meanwhile, Ferry Porsche received consent from the company to stay at the plant together with his father because of his increasing interest in design issues. The local town authorities endorsed a special permission for him to drive, even at 16 years of age.

Ferdinand Porsche senior enjoyed success particularly with his racing cars which excelled at the race tracks. His personal preference for designing compact cars differed with the current policies of (now merged) Daimler-Benz, who were in favor of more luxurious Mercedes-Benz models.

So, in 1929, Daimler-Benz began to question Porsche&#x27;s work seriously and halted it suddenly. He worked temporarily as the technical director of Steyr AG in Austria; nonetheless, he soon decided to open a consulting office of automobile design, again at Stuttgart.

At the same time, after finishing school, Ferry Porsche was residing at Stuttgart where he began working for Bosch Company in 1928; this was to add depth to his interest in automobile engineering. In 1930, he was taking additional lessons in physics and engineering, however he never formally enrolled in any university.

==Construction Bureau at Stuttgart==
By the 1930s, Stuttgart had already established itself as a center for the German automobile industry. It was thus an ideal location for the new Porsche design company. When Porsche senior opened his offices in April 1931, his son Ferry (then age 21) was by his side. The firm was called &quot;Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche GmbH Konstructionsbüro für Motoren, Fahrzeuge, Luftfahrzeuge und Wasserfahrzeugbau&quot;, meaning that Ferdinand Porsche&#x27;s firm specialized in construction and consultation for engines, automobiles, airplanes, and motorboats. Porsche GmbH was founded in 1931 by Ferdinand Porsche, Dr. Anton Piëch and Adolf Rosenberger. While Rosenberger was the financial backer, he also brought technical knowledge and racing skill to the company. Father and son were accompanied by renowned engineers.

During the early 1930s, Germany&#x27;s economic crisis was at its peak. The country was on the verge of political succession by the Nazis. In addition to the financial and political crises, Porsche also faced a lack in personnel, limiting the company&#x27;s prospects initially.

Nevertheless, Porsche soon obtained contracts from important German automotive firms Wanderer, Auto Union, Zwickau, Zündapp and, starting in 1933, the Nazi government. Some of these projects had historical impact, such as the mid-engine Auto Union &quot;Silver Arrow&quot; race cars, designed by Porsche. By that time, a newspaper published that &quot;in the automobile world, the name Porsche deserves a monument.&quot;

Ferry Porsche, at the time, managed departments &quot;controlling of testing&quot;, &quot;coordinating of the design engineers&quot;, and &quot;keeping good relations with clients&quot;. In 1935, Ferry married Dorothea Reitz, whom he had first met at Daimler-Benz. The couple had four children: Ferdinand Alexander (born 1935), Gerhard (born 1938), Hans-Peter (born 1940), and Wolfgang (born 1943), and remained married until her death.

In 1938, when his father moved to the new Volkswagen plant at Wolfsburg, Ferry became deputy manager of the Stuttgart bureau and relocated the design departments to Stuttgart-Zuffenhausen.

===Volkswagen===
Ferdinand Porsche&#x27;s dream had been to create a small compact car &quot;from scratch&quot;, instead of a version derived of an existing sedan. The design work began at their familial residence in Stuttgart on &quot;Feuerbacher Weg&quot;. Ferry Porsche had complete access to help his father, intervening on important parts of the project. The work had originally been supported by Zündapp, until backing away soon after due to commercial reasons.

The German government accepted the project on 22 June 1934, interested in producing &quot;an affordable car for the German family&quot;. Originally, it was called Porsche (Model) 60 but it was soon officially renamed as the KdF-Wagen or Volkswagen (people&#x27;s car). In the family&#x27;s garage at Stuttgart, three prototypes were built.

In 1939, when the Volkswagen factory opened in Wolfsburg, Porsche senior became its general manager, along with an officer from the Nazi party.

===Auto Union and Wanderer===
The German government had also decided to promote German race cars at the Grand Prix Motor Racing competitions. Therefore, the government had called for a concourse of the state-of-the-art racers of the time. Daimler-Benz easily won a bid. When Wanderer applied, it was rejected. Wanderer resorted to the Porsche firm.

In 1932, Ferdinand Porsche met with Adolf Hitler personally and their bid was accepted. Ferry Porsche took part in the conception and construction of those race cars, and was also responsible for the general organization of the workshop and the testing of units. In 1933, their first race car was developed with a 4.5 litre V-16 engine and an aluminum framework.

In 1934, Wanderer and others merged to form Auto Union, and the senior Porsche became the chief designer of their race cars. Both racing teams, Daimler-Benz and Auto Union, were also used for political propaganda by the National Socialists. They overwhelmingly dominated all the competitions of the 1930s. In 1938, Ferdinand Porsche senior left the Auto Union racing team when his contract expired.

==Second World War==
Porsche volunteered to join the SS on December 17, 1938, later claiming, falsely, that he had been conscripted by Himmler to design the Schwimmwagen. He would continue to deny having volunteered until his death. To avoid the aerial bombings of Stuttgart, Ferry Porsche was forced to bring some of the design departments to Austria, to two locations, Gmünd/Carinthia and Zell am See, where the family had a farm. Nonetheless, he stayed personally in Stuttgart, managing the business where factories were staffed with coerced labor.

Meanwhile, Porsche senior continued on at Wolfsburg, working for the Germans until the end of the war. The production of compact civilian cars at that factory had been halted, to produce small military cars called Kübelwagen.

Though, after the end of WWII, the French government requested formally that the Porsche family build a French version of the compact Volkswagen, in November 1945.

A group of French producers, led by Jean Pierre Peugeot, resisted this. During an official appointment at Wolfsburg, both Porsches, father and son, as well as Anton Piëch, a Viennese attorney who was Louise Porsche&#x27;s husband, were arrested together as criminals of war, on December 15. Without any trial, a bail of 500,000 francs was officially asked for each of the Porsche&#x27;s. It could be afforded only for Ferry Porsche who moved then to Austria, in July 1946. His father was taken instead to prison at Dijon.

==Porsche company at Gmünd==
After his release, Ferry Porsche attempted to return to Stuttgart but he was barred by the occupation forces. In consequence, in July 1946 he brought all the structure of the company to Gmünd/Carinthia, Austria.

Together, with his sister Louise, Ferry took over the management of the company. Early on, the workshop was primarily used for automotive repair. Additionally, they commercialized water pumps and lathes.

In time, they obtained two contracts for automobile design. One was for the construction of racecars for the &quot;Cisitalia&quot; racing team. The other was for the design of their own car, which later became known as the Porsche 356.

===Porsche Type 360 - Cisitalia===
As a result of Carlo Abarth&#x27;s mediation, Ferry Porsche inked a contract with Piero Dusio to produce Grand Prix racing cars again. The new model was called the Porsche 360 Cisitalia, and it was the first to spell out the name of the family&#x27;s enterprise. Its design was mostly alike to the preceding pre-war ones, despite being smaller. It had a supercharged mid-mounted engine displacing 1.5 liters and four-wheel drive.

===Porsche Type 356===
Following his father&#x27;s old aspiration, Ferdinand Porsche designed the Porsche 356, with a unique chassis and body while using Volkswagen components. The 356 had an air-cooled, rear-mounted, 4-cylinder engine producing 35 hp. Due to the location of its engine, the car was a little unstable but the balance favored potency and light weight.

An automobile dealer from Zürich ordered the first shipment in the winter of 1947 and production of the automobile began. Under Ferry Porsche&#x27;s supervision, the units were built completely by hand at an improvised workshop inside a sawmill at Gmünd.

By June 1948, 50 aluminum-bodied units had been completely assembled. Additionally, 6 frameworks were sent to the Beutler Company at Thun, Switzerland, where they were fitted with cabriolet bodies.

Despite its compact size, the car was popular with wealthy customers. If successful, the 356 would mean Porsche&#x27;s final hop out from performing only designing chores for others. Indeed, surprisingly, the 356 remained in production for many years and by 1965 had sold nearly 78,000 units. Additionally, it laid the framework which was followed by the entirety of the successive series of Porsche&#x27;s sports cars.

==Ferdinand Sr.&#x27;s fate==
During his 20 months of jail time in Dijon, Ferdinand Sr collaborated on designs for Renault and their later popular 4CV. It is speculated that the conditions of his imprisonment contributed to his health decline.

In 1947, Ferry gathered the amount of the stipulated bail, immediately after receiving the early fees for his new designs. His father was then released on 1 August 1947, along with Anton Piëch.

Once in Austria, Ferndinand Sr. reviewed the designs of his son for both projects; the 360 Cisitalia and the 356. He consented with the plans and aided the projects which were in progress. He commented daily to their employees that he &quot;would have done the same designs as Ferry&quot;.

As Ferdinand Sr.&#x27;s health further declined, Ferry took him to revisit Wolfsburg&#x27;s plant which was flourishing with the massive production of the Volkswagen Beetle—which was carried out under supervision of the British occupation. In November 1950, Ferdinand Sr. suffered a stroke which disabled him until his death, on 30 January 1951, aged 75.

==Return to Stuttgart==
In the spring of 1949, the &quot;general manager&quot; of Volkswagen, Heinz Nordhoff, approached &quot;junior&quot; Ferdinand Porsche and unpacked a massive contract.
For &quot;Porsche&quot;&#x27;s designing services—for example, improving the &quot;Beetle&quot;--, it specified that &quot;Volkswagen&quot; would start providing in exchange:
*a share of the profits from each &quot;Beetle&quot; sold
*the raw materials for building the sport &quot;Porsche&quot;″s vehicles
*the usage of &quot;Volkswagen&quot;″s world structure of retailers
*the usage of &quot;Volkswagen&quot;″s world structure for technical service
Also by this agreement, &quot;junior&quot; Ferdinand Porsche would become the only dealer of &quot;Volkswagen&quot; for all Austria.

In view of this new stabilized situation, &quot;junior&quot; Ferdinand Porsche decided to reestablish the headquarters of the &quot;Porsche&quot; at Stuttgart-Zuffenhausen. Though, the old original &quot;Porsche&quot;″s facilities were occupied by American forces. Nonetheless, he rented some workshops then from the company &quot;Reutter&quot; (which was a constructor of bodies for automobiles). He brought most of his employees and opened in September 1949. Their first work was the development of an engine which was called &quot;Carrera&quot;.

In 1950, the production of the &quot;Porsche 356&quot; resumed. Eventually, it was so successful that, despite being originally planned an annual production of 500, they had already produced 78,000 units by 1967. Ferdinand Porsche&#x27;s motto was to produce automobiles which had to be &quot;reliable and of high-quality sports cars, of a high utilitarian value&quot;.

&quot;Porsche&quot;″s most recognized involvement in car races began at &quot;24 Hours of Le Mans&quot;, in June 1951, when an improved version of the &quot;356&quot; debuted on this track and won in its category. On successive years, &quot;Porsche&quot;″s winning contribution to &quot;Le Mans&quot; is regarded as fundamental for the own existence of the circuit. Later, in 1959, &quot;Porsche&quot; won for first time an event of the &quot;World Sportscar Championship&quot;, at &quot;Targa Florio&quot;, while a &quot;Porsche 917&quot; would achieve the first &quot;Le Mans&quot; win finally in 1970.

===Porsche - Type 911 (1963)===
At the demand of Porsche&#x27;s fans, the company began planning a successor to the &quot;356&quot;. The project was originally called &quot;Porsche 901&quot;. Ferdinand Alexander Porsche (who was also nicknamed &quot;Butzi&quot;) and Ferdinand Porsche&#x27;s nephew took charge on designing the new model.

The first units were manufactured in 1962. However, Peugeot pushed legally for a change of the name, due to its registered trademark on automobile names with a &quot;zero amid two numbers&quot;. The model was renamed &quot;Porsche 911&quot;. Over time, it has evolved, but still kept the general shape and architecture since the beginning with a rear-mounted high-performance engine. On 11 May 2017, the millionth example was built.

==Porsche plc==
Following his father&#x27;s death in 1951, Ferry Porsche was the most responsible official of the company, as general manager, the chairman of the board of management. In 1972, he decided to transform the &quot;Porsche Company&quot; (which was a limited partnership) into a public concern, also by merging all the three enterprises which constituted it:
*&quot;Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche KG&quot;, from Stuttgart
*&quot;VW-Porsche Vertriebsgesellschaft&quot;, from Ludwigsburg
*&quot;Porsche Konstruktion KG&quot;, from Salzburg
Additionally, Ferdinand Porsche stepped down from the chairmanship and became honorary chairman of the supervisory board. In fact, he continued controlling the company as such. He remained in that position until his death In 1998. Ferdinand Alexander Porsche took his place as general manager.

The enterprise became a public limited company (plc), the &quot;Porsche GmbH&quot;. Nevertheless, the two deeply seated families, Porsche and Piëch, assured the possession yet of most of the shares. This status has also been kept through the years, until recently.

==Later years==
In 1989, Ferdinand Porsche retired definitively from involvement with the company he created, returning to his cherished Austrian farm at Zell am See.

Later, one of his last visited events was the launching of a new model, the Porsche 911 Carrera Cabriolet. It was based on the old &quot;356&quot;, with a 300 hp 6-cylinder air-cooled engine.

He also assisted in the large celebration of the 30 years of the Porsche 911 which took place at Stuttgart and Ludwigsburg. Despite being in an unhealthy condition, he signed autographs and drove through a street of 500 911s. He supported himself with a cane and was wearing a straw hat.

Ferdinand Porsche died 74 days short of the 50th anniversary of the company, at the age of 88, on 27 March 1998, at the farm in Zell am See, Austria. He was buried there at the Schüttgut church, beside his parents, his wife Dorothea and Anton Piëch. Porsche AG conducted a memorial service soon after in Stuttgart.

<doc id="318949" wikidata="Q1401207" url="?curid=318949" title="Root cause analysis">
<text>In science and engineering, root cause analysis (RCA) is a method of problem solving used for identifying the root causes of faults or problems. It is widely used in IT operations, manufacturing, telecommunications, industrial process control, accident analysis (e.g., in aviation, rail transport, or nuclear plants), medical diagnosis, the healthcare industry (e.g., for epidemiology), etc. Root cause analysis is a form of inductive inference (first create a theory, or &quot;root&quot;, based on empirical evidence, or &quot;causes&quot;) and deductive inference (test the theory, i.e., the underlying causal mechanisms, with empirical data).

RCA can be decomposed into four steps:
# Identify and describe the problem clearly
# Establish a timeline from the normal situation until the problem occurrence
# Distinguish between the root cause and other causal factors (e.g., via event correlation)
# Establish a causal graph between the root cause and the problem.

RCA generally serves as input to a remediation process whereby corrective actions are taken to prevent the problem from recurring. The name of this process varies between application domains. According to ISO/IEC 31010, RCA may include these techniques: Five whys, Failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA), Fault tree analysis, Ishikawa diagrams, and Pareto analysis.

==Definitions==

There are essentially two ways of repairing faults and solving problems in science and engineering.

===Reactive management===
Reactive management consists of reacting quickly after the problem occurs, by treating the symptoms. This type of management is implemented by reactive systems, self-adaptive systems, self-organized systems, and complex adaptive systems. The goal here is to react quickly and alleviate the effects of the problem as soon as possible.

===Proactive management===
Proactive management, conversely, consists of preventing problems from occurring. Many techniques can be used for this purpose, ranging from good practices in design to analyzing in detail problems that have already occurred and taking actions to make sure they never recur. Speed is not as important here as the accuracy and precision of the diagnosis. The focus is on addressing the real cause of the problem rather than its effects.

Root cause analysis is often used in proactive management to identify the root cause of a problem, that is, the factor that was the leading cause. It is customary to refer to the &quot;root cause&quot; in singular form, but one or several factors may constitute the &quot;root cause(s)&quot; of the problem under study.

A factor is considered the &quot;root cause&quot; of a problem if removing it prevents the problem from recurring. Conversely, a &quot;causal factor&quot; is a contributing action that affects an incident/event&#x27;s outcome but is not the root cause. Although removing a causal factor can benefit an outcome, it does not prevent its recurrence with certainty.

A great way to look at the proactive/reactive picture is to consider the Bowtie Risk Assessment model. In the center of the model is the event or accident. To the left, are the anticipated hazards and the line of defenses put in place to prevent those hazards from causing events. The line of defense is the regulatory requirements, applicable procedures, physical barriers, and cyber barriers that are in place to manage operations and prevent events. A great way to use root cause analysis is to proactively evaluate the effectiveness of those defenses by comparing actual performance against applicable requirements, identifying performance gaps, and then closing the gaps to strengthen those defenses. If an event occurs, then we are on the right side of the model, the reactive side where the emphasis is on identifying the root causes and mitigating the damage. 

===Example===
Imagine an investigation into a machine that stopped because it was overloaded and the fuse blew. Investigation shows that the machine was overloaded because it had a bearing that was not being sufficiently lubricated. The investigation proceeds further and finds that the automatic lubrication mechanism had a pump that was not pumping sufficiently, hence the lack of lubrication. Investigation of the pump shows that it has a worn shaft. Investigation of why the shaft was worn discovers that there is not an adequate mechanism to prevent metal scrap getting into the pump. This enabled scrap to get into the pump and damage it.

The apparent root cause of the problem is that metal scrap can contaminate the lubrication system. Fixing this problem ought to prevent the whole sequence of events from recurring. The &quot;real&quot; root cause could be a design issue if there is no filter to prevent the metal scrap getting into the system. Or if it has a filter that was blocked due to a lack of routine inspection, then the &quot;real&quot; root cause is a maintenance issue.

Compare this with an investigation that does not find the root cause: replacing the fuse, the bearing, or the lubrication pump will probably allow the machine to go back into operation for a while. However there is a risk that the problem will simply recur until the root cause is dealt with.

The above does not include cost/benefit analysis: does the cost of replacing one or more machines exceed the cost of downtime until the fuse is replaced? This situation is sometimes referred to as &quot;the cure being worse than the disease&quot;.

As an unrelated example of the conclusions that can be drawn in the absence of the cost/benefit analysis, consider the tradeoff between some claimed benefits of population decline: In the short term there will be fewer payers into pension/retirement systems; whereas halting the population will require higher taxes to cover the cost of building more schools. This can help explain the problem of the cure being worse than the disease.

Costs to consider go beyond finances when considering the personnel who operate the machinery. Ultimately, the goal is to prevent downtime; but more so prevent catastrophic injuries. Prevention begins with being proactive.

==General principles==
Despite the different approaches among the various schools of root cause analysis and the specifics of each application domain, RCA generally follows the same four steps:

# Identification and description: Effective problem statements and event descriptions (as failures, for example) are helpful and usually required to ensure the execution of appropriate root cause analyses. Problem statements are the North Star of the RCA as it keeps the team focused on what they are investigating and prevents them from going astray. 
# Gathering, organizing and analyzing information: Most RCAs begin with a fact finding session to gather available information such as witness statements, the chronology of events and applicable requirements for the evolutions that were taking place at the time of the event. The information can be used to establish a sequence of events or timeline for the event, and to identify the line of the defenses that should have prevented the event (i.e. the administrative requirements, and physical and cyber barriers). Available databases should also be queried and analyzed (such as corrective action program and safety program databases), and data analysis tools such as Pareto charts, process maps, fault trees, and other tools that provide us with insights into performance gaps. Any number of data analysis tools can be brought to bear, including data analysis tools from Lean Six Sigma, statistical analysis tools, and others such as hierarchical clustering and data-mining solutions (such as graph-theory-based data mining). Another consists in comparing the situation under investigation with past situations stored in case libraries, using case-based reasoning tools and can include change analysis, comparative timeline analysis and task analysis.
# Analysis of Defenses: After identifying the defenses in place that should have prevented the event or accident, it is highly recommended to conduct an analysis of defenses (traditionally called Barrier Analysis) in every case including non-RCA investigations. One method is to list the defenses on chart or a virtual white board. Then, for each defense, look at the information and data that was gathered for evidence of the effectiveness of that defense. We are actually looking for deficiencies or gaps in performance where the administrative requirements were not met, or where the physical or cyber barriers were bypassed. These initial gaps in performance are merely symptoms of deeper-seated causes. We use these symptomatic performance gaps to develop lines of inquiry questions as outlined below, to pursue the symptoms back to their points of origin (i.e. the root causes) using cause-and-effect analysis. 
# Generating focused, unbiased lines of inquiry questions: After gathering available information, organizing it into charts with timelines and other data, after analyzing available data, and after conducting an analysis of our defenses, we use those insights to generate great questions. These questions will become our lines of inquiry for cause-and-effect analysis. The questions must be unbiased, and to prevent any bias from the RCA team from tainting the investigation, questions should be tied to a specific defense, or to a specific insight from our data analysis (e.g., Pareto charts, process maps, fault trees, control charts) and other tools that provide us with insights into performance gaps. There should not be any curiosity questions, questions that reflect &quot;confirmation bias&quot; (i.e. asking a leading question so they answer what the RCA team thinks are the causes), or questions that are accusatory in nature that will cause those helping the investigation to close down and withdraw. 
# Cause-and-Effect Analysis: Once we have developed a robust set of lines of inquiry questions from the factual evidence collected, the applicable requirements, and an analysis of the available data, we can take those questions to the organization&#x27;s subject matter experts. This begins the process of cause-and-effect analysis. Once we pose a question to the affected organization, we use their answer to pose a follow-up Socratic questions. Socratic questions keep the investigation flowing down to the next deeper causal factors until the organization runs out of answers, or the last causal factor is beyond the organization&#x27;s control. There are many skills involved in conducting an effective cause-and-effect analysis, including facilitation skills, communication skills, and Socratic questioning. When conducted properly, this will take the RCA down to the deepest-seated root causes. A word of caution: Ishikawa or the Fishbone Diagram, and the 5-Whys methods, are not rigorous enough for conducting a root cause analysis. The Fishbone is from the 1940s and the 5-Whys is from the 1930, and there are much more advanced methods available. Look for methods that were developed in this century (the year 2000 and later), as they are more likely to account for the new dynamics of the modern sociotechnical work environments.
# Charting the Results of the RCA: The best way to chart the results of an RCA investigation is to start populating the final chart from the start. This process has become much easier with the advent of virtual white boards. In a single virtual white board, we can display the timelines, the lines of defenses, the data analysis, the lines of inquiry questions, the cause-and-effect analysis, the root causes, and the corrective action plan.
# Corrective Actions to Prevent Recurrence: From a management perspective, the RCA effort is not complete without a comprehensive corrective action plan to address the root causes, the contributing factors, and the &quot;Extent of the Causes.&quot; The corrective action plan should be developed by the issue owners and does not require participation by the RCA team, although the team is an excellent source of guidance for the issue owners. The Extent of Cause reviews are conducted to determine the extent of the damage or impact that the root causes and contributing factors had on humans, equipment, or facilities. Extent of Cause reviews are an Achilles heel in the vast majority of organizations and a primary reason why RCAs and corrective action plans fail to prevent recurrence. Also, care must be taken to avoid corrective action plans that simply add more administrative requirements and more training to the organization. To avoid this, use the Hierarchy of Hazard Controls and Lean Mistake Proofing as guidelines for developing effective corrective actions that have a much higher likelihood of preventing recurrence. 
# Effectiveness Reviews: After a pre-determined period after the implementation of the corrective action plan, an effectiveness review is scheduled to evaluate the effectiveness of those corrective actions. This requires specifying a set of metrics or indicators that will be monitored prior to and after the corrective actions are implemented, so we can measure their impact. If the desired results are not achieved, which in most cases is a significant reduction in the magnitude or frequency of the event or problem, then the RCA must be reopened as it was not effective. 

To be effective, root cause analysis must be performed systematically. The process enables the chance to not miss any other important details. A team effort is typically required, and ideally all persons involved should arrive at the same conclusion. In aircraft accident analyses, for example, the conclusions of the investigation and the root causes that are identified must be backed up by documented evidence.

===Transition to corrective actions===

The goal of RCA is to identify the root cause of the problem with the intent to stop the problem from recurring or worsening. The next step is to trigger long-term corrective actions to address the root cause identified during RCA, and make sure that the problem does not resurface. Correcting a problem is not formally part of RCA, however; these are different steps in a problem-solving process known as fault management in IT and telecommunications, repair in engineering, in aviation, environmental remediation in ecology, therapy in medicine, etc.

==Application domains==

Root cause analysis is used in many application domains. RCA is specifically called out in the United States Code of Federal Regulations in many of the Titles. For example:

# TITLE 10 - ENERGY »&gt; 10CFR Part 50, Appendix B, Criterion XVI, “Corrective Actions” (also adopted by NQA-1)
#* “Measures shall be established to assure that conditions adverse to quality such as failures, malfunctions, deficiencies, defective material and equipment, and non-conformances are promptly identified and corrected.
#* In the case of significant conditions adverse to quality, the measures shall assure that the cause of the condition is determined, and corrective action taken to prevent recurrence.”
# TITLE 14 - AERONAUTICS AND SPACE »&gt; 14 CFR Chapter III, Subchapter C, Part 437, Subpart C, §437.73   Anomaly recording, reporting and implementation of corrective actions.
## A permittee must record each anomaly that affects a safety-critical system, subsystem, process, facility, or support equipment.
## A permittee must identify all root causes of each anomaly and implement all corrective actions for each anomaly.
# TITLE 21 - FOOD AND DRUG »&gt; 21 CFR Subpart J: 21CFR820.100(a) – Corr./Preventive Action: (A) Each manufacturer shall establish and maintain procedures for implementing corrective and preventive action.  The procedures shall include requirements for:
## Investigating the cause of nonconformities relating to product, processes, and the quality system;
## Identifying the action(s) needed to correct and prevent recurrence of non- conforming product and other quality problems;
## Verifying or validating the corrective and preventive action to ensure that such action is effective and does not adversely affect the finished device;
# TITLE 42 - PUBLIC HEALTH »&gt; 42 CFR PART 488, SURVEY, CERTIFICATION, AND ENFORCEMENT PROCEDURES &gt; Subpart E—Survey and Certification of Long-Term Care Facilities
## §488.61   Special procedures for approval and re-approval of organ transplant programs.
## ...Root Cause Analysis for patient deaths and graft failures, including factors the program has identified as likely causal or contributing factors for patient deaths and graft failures;

===Manufacturing and industrial process control===
The example above illustrates how RCA can be used in manufacturing. RCA is also routinely used in industrial process control, e.g. to control the production of chemicals (quality control).

RCA is also used for failure analysis in engineering and maintenance.

===IT and telecommunications===
Root cause analysis is frequently used in IT and telecommunications to detect the root causes of serious problems. For example, in the ITIL service management framework, the goal of incident management is to resume a faulty IT service as soon as possible (reactive management), whereas problem management deals with solving recurring problems for good by addressing their root causes (proactive management).

Another example is the computer security incident management process, where root-cause analysis is often used to investigate security breaches.

RCA is also used in conjunction with business activity monitoring and complex event processing to analyze faults in business processes.

Its use in the IT industry cannot always be compared to its use in safety critical industries, since in normality the use of RCA in IT industry is &quot;not&quot; supported by pre-existing fault trees or other design specs. Instead a mixture of debugging, event based detection and monitoring systems (where the services are individually modelled) is normally supporting the analysis. Training and supporting tools like simulation or different in-depth runbooks for all expected scenarios do not exist, instead they are created after the fact based on issues seen as &#x27;worthy&#x27;.
As a result the analysis is often limited to those things that have monitoring/observation interfaces and not the actual planned/seen function with focus on verification of inputs and outputs. Hence, the saying &quot;there is no root cause&quot; has become common in the IT industry.

===Health and safety===
In the domains of health and safety, RCA is routinely used in medicine (diagnosis) and epidemiology (e.g., to identify the source of an infectious disease), where causal inference methods often require both clinical and statistical expertise to make sense of the complexities of the processes.

RCA is used in environmental science (e.g., to analyze environmental disasters), accident analysis (aviation and rail industry), and occupational safety and health. In the manufacture of medical devices, pharmaceuticals, food, and dietary supplements, root cause analysis is a regulatory requirement.

===Systems analysis===
RCA is also used in change management, risk management, and systems analysis.

==Challenges==

Without delving in the idiosyncrasies of specific problems, several general conditions can make RCA more difficult than it may appear at first sight.

First, important information is often missing because it is generally not possible, in practice, to monitor everything and store all monitoring data for a long time.

Second, gathering data and evidence, and classifying them along a timeline of events to the final problem, can be nontrivial. In telecommunications, for instance, distributed monitoring systems typically manage between a million and a billion events per day. Finding a few relevant events in such a mass of irrelevant events is asking to find the proverbial .

Third, there may be more than one root cause for a given problem, and this multiplicity can make the causal graph very difficult to establish.

Fourth, causal graphs often have many levels, and root-cause analysis terminates at a level that is &quot;root&quot; to the eyes of the investigator. Looking again at the example above in industrial process control, a deeper investigation could reveal that the maintenance procedures at the plant included periodic inspection of the lubrication subsystem every two years, while the current lubrication subsystem vendor&#x27;s product specified a 6-month period. Switching vendors may have been due to management&#x27;s desire to save money, and a failure to consult with engineering staff on the implication of the change on maintenance procedures. Thus, while the &quot;root cause&quot; shown above may have prevented the quoted recurrence, it would not have prevented other perhaps more severe failures affecting other machines.

<doc id="318956" wikidata="Q526300" url="?curid=318956" title="Billy McNeill">
<text>William McNeill (2 March 1940 – 22 April 2019) was a Scottish football player and manager. He had a long association with Celtic, spanning more than sixty years as a player, manager and club ambassador. McNeill captained Celtic&#x27;s &#x27;Lisbon Lions&#x27; to their European Cup victory in 1967 and later spent two spells as the club&#x27;s manager. As a player and manager, he won 31 major trophies with Celtic.

A defender, McNeill played for Celtic for his entire senior career, and holds the club record for most appearances, a total of 822 games over 18 seasons. He was captain during their most successful era in the 1960s and 70s. The club won nine consecutive Scottish league championships and thirteen other major domestic trophies in this time, and in 1967 became the first British club to win the European Cup. He also played 29 times for Scotland.

McNeill managed Celtic for nine seasons, from 1978 to 1983 and 1987 to 1991, winning four Scottish league championships. This included a league and cup double in 1987–88, the club&#x27;s centenary season. He also managed Clyde, Aberdeen, Manchester City and Aston Villa. In 2015, Celtic installed a statue outside Celtic Park of McNeill holding aloft the European Cup, an iconic image in their history.

==Early life==
McNeill was born on 2 March 1940 in Bellshill, Lanarkshire. His father was a soldier in the Black Watch and later the Army Physical Training Corps. Aged nine, McNeill moved to Hereford in England where his father was posted, and stayed for two and a half years. Although he already liked football, he enjoyed playing rugby union in his time there.

He moved to Motherwell and excelled playing football as centre-half at Our Lady&#x27;s High School. His schoolboy performances led to him signing for the junior team Blantyre Victoria.

==Playing career==

McNeill was signed by Celtic for £250 in 1957 after then reserve team coach Jock Stein saw him playing for Scotland schoolboys against England. He was given the nickname Cesar after the actor Cesar Romero.

In his early career, Celtic endured some of their most difficult times, and did not win a trophy for eight years. After Stein became manager in 1965, however, the club&#x27;s fortunes improved. In the 1965 Scottish Cup final, Celtic defeated Dunfermline 3–2, with McNeill scoring the winning goal. In that season he was named Scottish Footballer of the Year, the first year it was awarded.

With McNeill as captain, Celtic enjoyed their most successful period, dominating Scottish football and regularly competing in the latter stages of European competitions. They won nine Scottish League championships in a row, as well as seven Scottish Cups and six Scottish League Cups.

Celtic&#x27;s greatest season was in 1966–67, when they won every competition they entered; as well as a domestic treble and the Glasgow Cup, McNeill led the team to victory in the 1967 European Cup Final. The team, which became known as the &#x27;Lisbon Lions,&#x27; defeated Inter Milan 2–1 and McNeill (whose last minute goal, a characteristic header from a set piece, had ensured progression against Vojvodina Novi Sad in the quarter-final) was the first British footballer to lift the trophy. He also became the first player to captain his side to the European Treble, and remains the only captain to win the fabled Quadruple.

Following another domestic treble in 1968–69, in which another McNeill headed goal set his team on the way to a 4–0 win over Rangers in the Scottish Cup Final, Celtic again reached the European Cup final in 1970, this time losing to Feyenoord.

McNeill retired as a player in 1975, having made a club record 822 appearances for Celtic and never being substituted. He won 29 caps for Scotland, scoring 3 goals, and also played 9 times for the Scottish League XI.

==Managerial career==
After retiring as a player, McNeill began coaching Celtic Boys Club&#x27;s under 16 team. He began his management career at Clyde in April 1977, before moving to Aberdeen two months later. McNeill recorded four wins, three draws from eight league matches and recorded a total of 11 out of a possible 16 points at Clyde. His last match in charge was a Glasgow Cup semi-final against Celtic, in which Celtic struck two late goals to win 4–2.

===Aberdeen===
McNeill was appointed Aberdeen manager in June 1977, having been recommended by Jock Stein. He succeeded Ally MacLeod. In his one season in charge, 1977–78, McNeill led Aberdeen to runners-up finishes in the league and Scottish Cup, and enjoyed a positive working relationship with the club&#x27;s chairman, Dick Donald. Their performance in the league was their best since 1972, and three places above Celtic. During his season with Aberdeen, McNeill signed Gordon Strachan, Steve Archibald and Neil Simpson. When Stein retired as Celtic manager, he identified McNeill as his successor, and McNeill accepted the club&#x27;s offer. He was succeeded at Aberdeen by Alex Ferguson.

===Celtic===
McNeill returned to a Celtic side who had finished in fifth place in 1977–78. He immediately improved the club&#x27;s fortunes, as they won the league championship in 1978–79. Celtic clinched the title in their final match of the league season by beating Rangers 4–2, despite having had Johnny Doyle sent off.

His five years in charge saw Celtic win three League championships, in 1978–79, 1980–81 and 1981–82, the Scottish Cup in 1979–80 and the League Cup in 1982–83. This period saw Celtic&#x27;s greatest competition come from the New Firm clubs – Aberdeen, who won the League championship in 1979–80, and Dundee United, who won the title in 1982–83.

McNeill is credited with developing young players for Celtic, such as Paul McStay and Charlie Nicholas, and making signings such as Murdo MacLeod and Davie Provan who became key players for the club through the 1980s. However, McNeill found working with Desmond White, Celtic&#x27;s chairman, very difficult, and felt underpaid and underappreciated. Despite Celtic&#x27;s successes, by 1983 he was being paid less than the managers of Aberdeen, Dundee United, Rangers and St Mirren. When White sold Nicholas to Arsenal, against McNeill&#x27;s wishes, McNeill looked for the first available way out, and took up the offer to manage Manchester City.

===Manchester City and Aston Villa===
On 30 June 1983 he moved to England to manage Manchester City. Two years before being appointed by City, he had been strongly linked with the manager&#x27;s job at their city rivals Manchester United, when Ron Atkinson was appointed instead. McNeill secured promotion for City after two seasons in charge (in 1984–85), and oversaw survival in their first season back in the First Division (1985–86).

He started the 1986–87 season as manager of Manchester City, but quit in September 1986 to take charge of Aston Villa. When Villa were relegated, after finishing bottom of the First Division in May 1987, McNeill stood down and was replaced by Graham Taylor. Manchester City were also relegated that season.

===Return to Celtic===
He then returned to Celtic, and in his first season, 1987–88, the club won the League Championship and Scottish Cup double in their centenary year. Celtic were renowned for scoring late goals that season, and in both the Cup semi-final and final scored late goals to come from behind and win 2–1. Celtic won the Scottish Cup in 1988–89, defeating Rangers 1–0 in the final.

The following two seasons were disappointing, and Celtic did not win a trophy. They lost the 1990 Scottish Cup Final to Aberdeen on penalties. Celtic&#x27;s league performance was particularly poor; after finishing in third place in 1988–89, they managed only fifth in 1989–90 and third in 1990–91. This was the beginning of a period of poor results and increasing financial instability for Celtic, which continued until the club was taken over by Fergus McCann in 1994. McNeill was sacked by Celtic on 22 May 1991 after four seasons as manager, at the age of 51. In two spells he won eight trophies as Celtic manager – four League championships, three Scottish Cups and one League Cup.

After leaving Celtic he turned down several offers to return to management, including from Dundee, and worked in the media instead. He remained bitter about the manner of his departure from Celtic, until he was asked to become a club ambassador in 2009.

===Hibernian===
McNeill had a brief spell as football development manager at Hibernian in the later part of the 1997–98 season. He was brought in as a mentor to manager Jim Duffy, as they unsuccessfully attempted to arrest a decline in fortunes at the club. McNeill took charge of the team for one game after Duffy was sacked, even though he had been out of football since leaving Celtic in 1991 and was recovering from heart surgery. He left Hibernian at the end of the 1997–98 season.

McNeill wrote three autobiographies:

==Awards and recognition==

McNeill was awarded the MBE in November 1974. In 2002 he was voted Celtic&#x27;s greatest ever captain, and a member of Celtic&#x27;s greatest team, by the club&#x27;s fans. He was inducted into the Scottish Sports Hall of Fame in 2002 and the Scottish Football Hall of Fame in 2004.

In December 2015 Celtic installed a statue at the entrance to the Celtic Way outside Celtic Park, created by sculptor John McKenna. The statue, in bronze on a granite base, shows McNeill holding aloft the European Cup, an iconic image in the club&#x27;s history.

In 2019, he was recognised with the &quot;One Club Award&quot; by Spanish club Athletic Bilbao for his achievements and loyalty to Celtic.

A short time after his death, the new sports pitch at his former school, Our Lady&#x27;s High, was named in his honour.

In 2019, the Billy McNeill Commemoration Committee was created in Bellshill, and campaigned to raise funds to build a bronze sculpture of McNeill at the pedestrian area of Bellshill Cross. The statue was unveiled in November 2022.

==Personal life==
McNeill&#x27;s maternal grandparents were from Lithuania, while his father was of Irish descent. He was Catholic.

McNeill married Liz Callaghan, a dancer on the TV variety show &quot;The White Heather Club&quot; in 1963. They had five children.

McNeill, along with former Rangers player Eric Caldow, stood as a candidate for the Scottish Senior Citizens Unity Party in the 2003 Scottish Parliament election. In 2008, he was awarded an honorary degree from the University of Glasgow.

During the 2014 Scottish independence referendum McNeill was a supporter of the Better Together campaign against Scottish independence.

It was reported in February 2017 that McNeill was suffering from dementia and was very limited in his speech. He died on 22 April 2019, aged 79.

<text>John Walker (29 May 1781 – 1 May 1859) was an English inventor who invented the friction match.

==Life==
Walker was born in Stockton-on-Tees, County Durham, in 1781. He went to the local grammar school and was afterwards apprenticed to Watson Alcock, the principal surgeon of the town, serving him as an assistant. He had, however, an aversion to surgical operations and had to leave the profession, turning instead to chemistry. After studying at Durham and York he set up a small business as a chemist and druggist at 59 High Street, Stockton, around 1818.
Walker died in Stockton on 1 May 1859 and was buried in the grounds of St Mary&#x27;s Church in Norton, near Stockton.

==Walkers Friction Match==

He developed an interest in trying to find a means of obtaining fire easily. Several chemical mixtures that would ignite by a sudden explosion were already known but it had not been found possible to transmit the flame to a slow-burning substance such as wood. While Walker was preparing a lighting mixture on one occasion, a match that had been dipped in it caught fire by an accidental friction on the hearth. He at once appreciated the practical value of the discovery and started making friction matches. They consisted of wooden splints or sticks of cardboard coated with sulphur and tipped with a mixture of sulphide of antimony, chlorate of potash and gum, the sulphur serving to communicate the flame to the wood.

The price of a box of 50 matches was one shilling. With each box was supplied a piece of sandpaper, folded in half, through which the match had to be drawn to ignite it. He did not name the matches &quot;Congreves&quot; in honour of the inventor and rocket pioneer, Sir William Congreve as it is sometimes stated. The &quot;congreves&quot; were the invention of Charles Sauria, a French chemistry student at the time. He did not divulge the exact composition of his matches.

Two and a half years after Walker&#x27;s invention was made public Isaac Holden arrived, independently, at the same idea of coating wooden splinters with sulphur. The exact date of his discovery, according to his own statement, was October 1829. Before that date Walker&#x27;s sales-book contains an account of no fewer than 250 sales of friction matches, the first entry dated 7 April 1827. Already comfortably off, he refused to patent his invention despite being encouraged to by Michael Faraday and others, making it freely available for anyone to make. He received neither fame nor wealth for his invention, although he was able to retire some years later. The credit for his invention was attributed only after his death.

Following the ideas laid out by the French chemist Charles Sauria, who in 1830 invented the first phosphorus-based match by replacing the antimony sulfide in Walker&#x27;s matches with white phosphorus, matches were first patented in the United States in 1836, in Massachusetts, being smaller in size and safer to use. White phosphorus was later banned for public use because of its toxicity. Today&#x27;s modern safety matches were created by the Swedish chemist, Gustaf Erik Pasch.

<text>Seipp&#x27;s day gecko (Phelsuma seippi) is an endangered diurnal species of lizard in the family Gekkonidae. The species is native to northern Madagascar, typically inhabits rainforests, dwells on trees, and feeds on insects and nectar.

==Etymology==
The specific name, &quot;seippi&quot;, is in honor of German herpetologist Robert Seipp.

==Description==
&quot;P. seippi&quot; belongs to the medium-sized day geckos. It can reach a total length (including tail) of about . The body colour of this slender and long-snouted gecko is green or yellowish green. There are several small red or rust-coloured spots on the back which may form dorsal striping. A rust-coloured eye stripe extends from the nostril to above the ear opening. A red v-shaped marking may be present on the head. Typical for this species are several v-shaped stripes on the throat. The ventral side is light pink.

==Geographic range==
&quot;P. seippi&quot; inhabits northwest Madagascar. It can also be found on the islands Nosy Bé and Nosy Komba.

==Habitat==
The preferred natural habitat of &quot;P. seippi&quot; is forest, at altitudes from sea level to . Seipp&#x27;s day gecko is restricted to the native rainforests and avoids bright sun light. It lives on trees both in the forest and along its edges. It is largely dependent on bamboo forest, and habitat degradation is a major threat to this species.

==Diet==
&quot;P. seippi&quot; feeds on various insects and other invertebrates. It also likes to lick soft, sweet fruit, pollen and nectar.

==Behaviour==
&quot;P. seippi&quot; is often found in pairs on a tree. Juveniles mainly inhabit surrounding low shrubs.

==Reproduction==
The female of &quot;P. seippi&quot; lays a pair of eggs and hides them on the ground under foliage or wood, or she may lay her eggs on trees under loose bark. At a temperature of , the young will hatch after approximately 45–50 days. The juveniles measure .

==Captivity==
&quot;P. seippi&quot; should be housed in pairs in a well planted terrarium. The temperature should be between . The humidity should be maintained between 75 and 100%. In captivity, &quot;P. seippi&quot; can be fed crickets, wax moth larvae, fruit flies, mealworms, and houseflies.

<text>News Corp UK &amp; Ireland Limited (trading as News UK, formerly News International and NI Group) is a British newspaper publisher, and a wholly owned subsidiary of the American mass media conglomerate News Corp. It is the current publisher of &quot;The Times&quot;, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, and &quot;The Sun&quot; newspapers; its former publications include the &quot;Today&quot;, &quot;News of the World&quot;, and &quot;The London Paper&quot; newspapers. It was established in February 1981 under the name News International plc. In June 2002, the company name was changed to News International Limited, and on 31 May 2011, to NI Group Limited, and on 26 June 2013 to News UK.

==History==
Between 1987 and 1995, News International owned, through its subsidiary News (UK) Ltd, &quot;Today&quot;, the first UK national newspaper to be printed in colour. All of News International&#x27;s newspapers (with the exception of &quot;The London Paper&quot;, launched in 2006) were founded by other owners, in some cases hundreds of years ago.

In October 2005, News International sold TSL Education, publisher of &quot;Times Higher Education&quot;, &quot;Times Educational Supplement&quot;, and other education titles, for £235m ($415m). &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;, previously part of TSL Education, was retained by News International as part of the deal. Darwin Ltd, which had taken over the company, continued to produce the same product.

===Phone hacking allegations===
In July 2009, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, a newspaper owned by Guardian Media Group, reported that News Group Newspapers paid in excess of £1m to settle legal cases that threatened to reveal News Group journalists&#x27; use on repeated occasions of illegal methods in the pursuit of stories. It has been alleged that News Group staff were accused of engaging in phone hacking, including Clive Goodman, illegally accessed voicemail for the mobile phones of thousands of public figures, including politicians and celebrities. Goodman was jailed in 2007 for tapping the mobile phones of three members of the royal staff; this is an offence under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act. It was stated by News International at the time that Goodman had acted without its knowledge, and that no other News International journalists made use of such methods.

The evidence uncovered by &quot;The Guardian&quot; showed that many more figures were in fact the subject of phone-taps, including Nigella Lawson, Lenny Henry, Gwyneth Paltrow, John Prescott, Boris Johnson, and Tessa Jowell. In 2008, the &quot;News of the World&quot; paid in excess of £400,000 in damages to Gordon Taylor, the chief executive of the Professional Footballers&#x27; Association, who was suing the newspaper for its involvement in the illegal interception of messages to his mobile phone. According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, this payment, made in exchange for Taylor&#x27;s silence, &quot;prevented the public from knowing anything about the hundreds of pages of evidence which had been disclosed in Taylor&#x27;s case&quot;.

In contrast to News International&#x27;s earlier denials of knowledge, &quot;The Guardian&quot; cites suppressed evidence revealing that &quot;News of the World&quot;″s editorial staff were involved with private investigators who engaged in illegal phone-hacking, and that both reporters and executives were commissioning purchases of confidential information; this is illegal unless it is shown to be in the public interest. Apparently these activities were well known within the &quot;News of the World&quot;, being &quot;openly paid for by the accounts department with invoices which itemised illegal acts&quot;. The paperwork was alleged to show the above occurred during the tenure of Andy Coulson, who was chief press advisor to David Cameron, leader of the UK&#x27;s Conservative Party, until his resignation on 21 January 2011.

On 4 July, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that a private investigator at the &quot;News of the World&quot; had hacked into the phone of murdered teenager Milly Dowler, causing both her parents and police investigating her murder to wrongly believe she was still alive. This occurred during the period that Rebekah Brooks (&quot;née&quot; Wade) was editor.

On 7 July, British newspaper &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; alleged that the families of dead British service personnel were targeted by private investigators working for the &quot;News of the World&quot;. This led to The Royal British Legion severing ties with the paper until such allegations are proved false. On the same day, James Murdoch announced the &quot;News of the World&quot; would be shut down after the publication of one more edition on 10 July 2011, due to the allegations. The newspaper had already been faced with the withdrawal of a number of sponsors which had advertised their products and services in the newspaper, not to mention the inevitable fall in sales that the newspaper would have faced had it remained in circulation.

On 15 July, Rebekah Brooks resigned as chief executive of News International. She commented thus on her departure:

&quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper, citing official company accounts, claims Brooks received a £10.8m payoff for leaving News International.

===Brooks reappointed as CEO===
In September 2015, Brooks was reappointed as CEO of the company, now named News UK.

==Operations==
The company&#x27;s major titles are published by subsidiary companies, Times Newspapers Ltd and News Group Newspapers. Until 2010, these newspapers were written at a large site in Wapping in east London, near Tower Hill, which earned the nickname &quot;Fortress Wapping&quot; after a fierce dispute with the union to which the workforce had previously belonged. The printing of the papers is now undertaken at plants in Waltham Cross, Knowsley, and Lanarkshire (the latter said by Rupert Murdoch, on the plant&#x27;s opening in 2007, to be &quot;the largest and fastest print press in the world&quot;).

The News Building, where all of News UK&#x27;s London operations are based, was opened on 16 September 2014 by the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson.

===Times Newspapers Ltd===
Times Newspapers Limited publishes the compact daily newspaper &quot;The Times&quot; and the broadsheet &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;.

Times Newspapers was formed in 1967 when the Thomson Corporation purchased &quot;The Times&quot; from the Astor family and merged it with &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, which it had owned since 1959. The company was purchased by Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s News International in February 1981. The acquisition followed an intense 21 days of negotiations with the print unions, conducted by John Collier and Bill O&#x27;Neill. &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;, &quot;Times Educational Supplement&quot; and &quot;Times Higher Education Supplement&quot; were also part of the group; the latter two publications have since been sold.

Times Newspapers Holdings Limited was incorporated as a private company on 3 June 1925 and was dissolved on 9 July 2024. The Times Limited has existed as a separate company since 1968 and , registered at the same address, as a private, limited, non-trading company.

An American edition of &quot;The Times&quot; was launched in New York City, Boston and some other East Coast US cities in 2006.

Rupert Murdoch has stated that the law and the independent board prevent him from exercising editorial control. However, an article in &quot;The Spectator&quot; following the resignation of James Harding stated that the trust has &quot;never played much of a role in the 30 years Murdoch has owned the paper&quot;, and suggested that Murdoch had pressurised Harding to resign.

===News Group Newspapers Ltd===
News Group Newspapers Ltd publishes the tabloid newspaper &quot;The Sun&quot;. The &quot;News of the World&quot; was another tabloid newspaper owned by the company; however, its closure was announced on 7 July 2011, following new evidence about a phone hacking scandal at the newspaper. The final issue was released on 10 July 2011.

The &quot;News of the World&quot; was purchased by Murdoch in January 1969. &quot;The Sun&quot; was acquired in October 1969 from International Publishing Corporation.

Murdoch states that he acts as a &quot;traditional proprietor&quot;; exercising editorial control on major issues, such as which political party to back in a general election or policy on Europe.

===NI Free Newspapers Limited===
&quot;The London Paper&quot; was the first newspaper to be launched by News International rather than bought. It was an evening freesheet distributed at bus and rail stations in London. It was published five days a week from September 2006 to September 2009, when it closed down, faced with competition from other free papers.

===Wireless Group Limited===
In 2016, News UK acquired Wireless Group Limited, the operator of a number of radio stations across the United Kingdom and Ireland.

===Talk===

In December 2020, Ofcom granted a licence to News UK &amp; Ireland Limited to operate a new television channel on satellite and cable (not to be confused with Andrew Neil&#x27;s GB News, which is a separate news channel launched in June 2021). At that time, News UK TV was overseen by David Rhodes who had been a Fox News executive and president of CBS News.

In April 2021, News UK CEO Rebekah Brooks announced that plans for the new service had been much reduced: a British equivalent of Fox was considered unviable; programmes would be available only via streaming. David Rhodes was to return to the United States in June that year.

In September 2021, a few days after Neil had resigned as chairman of rival GB News, it was reported that News UK&#x27;s channel would now be called TalkTV (after the radio stations TalkRadio and talkSport); Piers Morgan would be a presenter on the new service. News UK decided TalkTV would run on FreeSat, Freeview, Sky UK and Virgin Media (if slots could be acquired); the channel would feature current affairs, sport, and entertainment.

In response to poor viewer ratings the television channel was rebranded as &quot;Talk&quot; and became an internet-only service in 2024.

<text>A dissenter (from the Latin , &#x27;to disagree&#x27;) is one who dissents (disagrees) in matters of opinion, belief, etc. Dissent may include political opposition to decrees, ideas or doctrines and it may include opposition to those things or the fiat of a government, political party or religion.

==Usage in Christianity==
===Dissent from the Anglican Church===
In the social and religious history of England and Wales, and, by extension, Ireland, however, it refers particularly to a member of a religious body who has, for one reason or another, separated from the established church or any other kind of Protestant who refuses to recognise the supremacy of the established church in areas where the established church is or was Anglican.

Originally, the term included English and Welsh Roman Catholics whom the original draft of the Nonconformist Relief Act 1779 styled &quot;Protesting Catholic Dissenters&quot;. In practice, however, it designates Protestant Dissenters referred to in sec. ii. of the Act of Toleration of 1689 (see English Dissenters). The term recusant, in contrast, came to refer to Roman Catholics rather than Protestant dissenters.

===Dissent from the Presbyterian Church===
The term has also been applied to those bodies who dissent from the Presbyterian Church of Scotland, which is the national church of Scotland. In this connotation, the terms &quot;dissenter&quot; and &quot;dissenting&quot;, which had acquired a somewhat contemptuous flavor, have tended since the middle of the 18th century to be replaced by &quot;nonconformist&quot;, a term which did not originally imply secession, but only refusal to conform in certain particulars (for example the wearing of the surplice), with the authorized usages of the established church.

==Dissent from state religion==
Still more recently, the term &quot;nonconformist&quot; has in its turn, as the political attack on the principle of a state establishment of religion developed, tended to give way to the style of &quot;free churches&quot; and &quot;free churchman&quot;. All three terms continue in use, &quot;nonconformist&quot; being the most usual, as it is the most colourless.

<doc id="318969" wikidata="Q850982" url="?curid=318969" title="Curtici">
<text>Curtici (Hungarian: &quot;Kürtös&quot;, German: &quot;Kurtitsch&quot;) is a town located in Arad County, in western Romania. The town is situated at a distance from the county capital, Arad, in the western part of Arad County. It is the most important railway meeting point of Central Europe with the western part of Romania. Its administrative territory extends on a area, on the Sântana Plateau, a plateau characterized in the zone of the town by the sand hills formed by the old branches of the river Mureș.

Curtici is a border town between Hungary and Romania, on the Romanian side. It is an especially important rail border crossing, as it is the main crossing between trains going from Hungary and Romania, especially those between Budapest and Bucharest. The town administered the village of Dorobanți until 2004, when it was split off to form a separate commune. The town borders Hungary and Macea commune to the north, Zimandu Nou commune to the east, Șofronea commune to the south, and Dorobanți commune to the west.

The town&#x27;s Hungarian name means &quot;Trumpeter&quot;; the German and Romanian names derive from that. The first written confirmation of the town Curtici dates back to the 16th century, specifically to 1519. In 1920, it became part of Romania. It was declared a town in 1968.

==Demographics==

At the 2021 census, Curtici had a population of 7,279. At the 2011 census, the town had 6,849 inhabitants, of which 86.62% were Romanians, 9.35% Roma, 3.19% Hungarians, 0.11% Germans, 0.21% Ukrainians, and 0.1% are of other or undeclared nationalities.

==Economy==
Its economy is in a continuous development. Due to the agricultural potential of the zone, to its favourable position from the western border of Romania, to its closeness to Arad, to the presence of the main railway making connection with Western Europe (the railway station of Curtici was inaugurated in 1921, simultaneously with the formation of the customs) the town is an important economic pole. The town attracts investments due to the establishment of the Arad-Curtici duty-free zone.

In summer, the thermal water pool is the town&#x27;s main tourist attraction.

<text>Sir Julius Caesar (1557/155818 April 1636) was an English lawyer, judge and politician who sat in the House of Commons at various times between 1589 and 1622. He was also known as Julius Adelmare.

==Early life and education==
Caesar was born near Tottenham in Middlesex, the son of Cesare Adelmare who was originally from Treviso, Italy, and his wife, Margery Perient or Pirry (died c. 1583). Cesare Adelmare, like many of his ancestors, studied at the University of Padua, where he was made doctor in 1547. He was registered as a doctor in his native Treviso in 1542. In England in 1544 he was found to be working unlicensed and then licensed. He was naturalised in 1558, and was a physician to Queens Mary I and Elizabeth I. 

Cesare&#x27;s father, Pietro Maria Adelmare, was also a graduate of Padua, and was a judge and ambassador for Treviso. His mother, Paola Cesarini, was said to be descended from the well-known Cesarini family of Rome. Julius was baptised in the Church of St. Dunstan&#x27;s-in-the-East in February 1558, his sponsors being the Lord Treasurer, William Paulet, 1st Marquess of Winchester; the Earl of Arundel; and Lady Montagu representing the queen. After his father&#x27;s death, his mother married, as her second husband, Michael Lok. 

He was possibly educated at Winchester College and matriculated at Magdalen Hall, Oxford, on 10 January 1575, aged 16, and was awarded BA on 17 May 1575 and MA on 18 February 1578. He then studied at the Faculty of Law of Paris (University of Paris), where he was made LLB and LLD on 22 April 1581.

==Career==
Caesar was noted for his persistent striving for advancement and for financial reward in the time of Queen Elizabeth. He was a general commissioner on piracy in October 1581. In 1583 he was counsel to the City of London and commissary of his friend John Aylmer, the Bishop of London in Middlesex, Hertfordshire and Essex. On 5 March 1584 he was awarded a law degree at Oxford, and became doctor of canon law. In 1584, he was appointed Judge of the High Court of Admiralty until 1605, and was an advocate of Doctors&#x27; Commons in 1586. In 1588 he became a master in chancery. He was elected MP for Reigate in 1589. He became Bencher of the Inner Temple in 1590 and was Master of Requests Extraordinary of Court of Requests in 1591. He became JP from 1592 and was governor of mineral and battery works in 1593. Also in 1593 he was elected MP for Bletchingley. He was treasurer of the Inner Temple in 1593. He became Master of Requests Ordinary of Court of Requests in 1595 and Master of St Katherine&#x27;s Hospital in 1596. In 1597 he was elected MP for Windsor and was re-elected MP for Windsor in 1601.

Queen Elizabeth, on her way to Nonsuch Palace, paid him a visit at his house at Mitcham on 12 September 1598. She spent the night of the 12th there, and dined with him the next day.

In the reign of King James, Caesar acquired extensive property, particularly in Hertfordshire, and achieved greater influence and political importance. He was knighted at Greenwich by King James in May 1603. He also became ecclesiastical commissioner for the Province of Canterbury in 1603. In 1606 he was elected MP for Middlesex. He was Chancellor and Under Treasurer of the Exchequer from 1606 to 1614. In 1607 he was appointed to the Privy Council. In 1614 he was appointed Master of the Rolls, an office which he held till his death in 1636. He was re-elected MP for Middlesex in 1614. In 1621 he became first commissioner for the great seal and was elected MP for Maldon. He was commissioner to inquire into operation of the poor law from 1631 to 1633.

==Death==
Caesar died at the age of 79 and was buried at Great St. Helen&#x27;s, Bishopsgate.

===Legacy===
Caesar was a remarkable civil servant and left many volumes of papers relating to his official work, and others relating to the mint, of which his first father-in-law was master. He worked on the history of the Exchequer, and presented to Burghley a history of the Court of Requests &quot;to defend it against the slights of the common lawyers&quot;. In 1625 he wrote a treatise on the constitution and functions of the privy council, entitled &quot;Concerning the Private Council of the Most High and Mighty King of Great Britain, France, Scotland, and Ireland&quot;. His manuscripts, many of which are now in the British Museum, were sold by auction in 1757 for a sum of around £500.

==Personal life==

Caesar married three times. He married firstly Dorcas Lusher (1561 – 16 June 1595), widow of Richard Lusher of the Middle Temple and daughter of Sir Richard Martin, master of the mint and later Lord Mayor of London, with whom he had four sons and a daughter.

He married secondly, on 10 April 1596, Alice Dent (June 1569 – 23 May 1614), widow of John Dent, Alderman of London, and daughter of Christopher Grant of Manchester, Lancashire, with whom he had three more sons. A portrait of Alice when pregnant dated 1597 gives her age as 31.

He married thirdly Anne Hogan, widow of Henry Hogan and William Hungate, both of East Bradenham, Norfolk, and daughter of Henry Woodhouse of Waxham, Norfolk on 19 April 1615. His third wife Anne was a granddaughter of Nicholas Bacon. Francis Bacon, his wife&#x27;s uncle, died in his arms.

His son, also named Julius Caesar (14 February 1587 – 8 January 1607), was sent to study at the University of Padua. He was wounded while fencing with Antonio Brochetta and sought revenge. He lay in wait for him with a pistol, but his shot missed. He then fell while attempting to draw his sword and was set upon by Brochetta who ran him through and killed him.

His son Sir Charles Caesar (27 January 1590 – 6 December 1642) was a member of Parliament, as well as Master of the Rolls from 1639 to 1642, which he purchased for £15,000 and a £2,000 loan.

His son Sir John Caesar (20 October 1597 – 23 May 1647) of Hyde Hall, Hertfordshire, a country gentleman, was knighted in Scotland on 20 June 1617.

His son Thomas Caesar D.D. (17 March 1601 – 1633) was rector of Llanrhuddlad Anglesey, Wales of whom a memorial graces the chancel of Beaumaris parish church, Anglesey.

His son Robert Caesar (9 October 1602 – 27 October 1637) was one of the Six Clerks of Court of Chancery and a member of Parliament.

<doc id="318976" wikidata="Q1386253" url="?curid=318976" title="F-test">
<text>An F-test is a statistical test that compares variances. It&#x27;s used to determine if the variances of two samples, or if the ratios of variances among multiple samples, are significantly different. The test calculates a statistic, represented by the random variable F, and checks if it follows an F-distribution. This check is valid if the null hypothesis is true and standard assumptions about the errors (ε) in the data hold. 

F-tests are frequently used to compare different statistical models and find the one that best describes the population the data came from. When models are created using the least squares method, the resulting F-tests are often called &quot;exact&quot; F-tests. The F-statistic was developed by Ronald Fisher in the 1920s as the variance ratio and was later named in his honor by George W. Snedecor.

==Common examples==

Common examples of the use of &quot;F&quot;-tests include the study of the following cases

* The hypothesis that the means of a given set of normally distributed populations, all having the same standard deviation, are equal. This is perhaps the best-known &quot;F&quot;-test, and plays an important role in the analysis of variance (ANOVA).
** F test of analysis of variance (ANOVA) follows three assumptions 
**# Normality (statistics)
**# Homogeneity of variance
**# Independence of errors and random sampling 

* The hypothesis that a proposed regression model fits the data well. See Lack-of-fit sum of squares.
* The hypothesis that a data set in a regression analysis follows the simpler of two proposed linear models that are nested within each other.
* Multiple-comparison testing is conducted using needed data in already completed F-test, if F-test leads to rejection of null hypothesis and the factor under study has an impact on the dependent variable.
** &quot;&quot;a priori&quot; comparisons&quot;/ &quot;planned comparisons&quot;- a particular set of comparisons
** &quot;pairwise comparisons&quot;-all possible comparisons
*** i.e. Fisher&#x27;s least significant difference (LSD) test, Tukey&#x27;s honestly significant difference (HSD) test, Newman Keuls test, Ducan&#x27;s test
** &quot;&quot;a posteriori&quot; comparisons&quot;/ &quot;&quot;post hoc&quot; comparisons&quot;/ &quot;exploratory comparisons&quot;- choose comparisons after examining the data
*** i.e. Scheffé&#x27;s method 
===&quot;F&quot;-test of the equality of two variances===
The &quot;F&quot;-test is sensitive to non-normality. In the analysis of variance (ANOVA), alternative tests include Levene&#x27;s test, Bartlett&#x27;s test, and the Brown–Forsythe test. However, when any of these tests are conducted to test the underlying assumption of homoscedasticity (&quot;i.e.&quot; homogeneity of variance), as a preliminary step to testing for mean effects, there is an increase in the experiment-wise Type I error rate.

==Formula and calculation==
Most &quot;F&quot;-tests arise by considering a decomposition of the variability in a collection of data in terms of sums of squares. The test statistic in an &quot;F&quot;-test is the ratio of two scaled sums of squares reflecting different sources of variability. These sums of squares are constructed so that the statistic tends to be greater when the null hypothesis is not true. In order for the statistic to follow the &quot;F&quot;-distribution under the null hypothesis, the sums of squares should be statistically independent, and each should follow a scaled χ²-distribution. The latter condition is guaranteed if the data values are independent and normally distributed with a common variance.

=== One-way analysis of variance ===
The formula for the one-way ANOVA &quot;F&quot;-test statistic is
:formula_1

or

:formula_2

The &quot;explained variance&quot;, or &quot;between-group variability&quot; is

:formula_3

where formula_4 denotes the sample mean in the &quot;i&quot;-th group, formula_5 is the number of observations in the &quot;i&quot;-th group, formula_6 denotes the overall mean of the data, and formula_7 denotes the number of groups.

The &quot;unexplained variance&quot;, or &quot;within-group variability&quot; is

:formula_8

where formula_9 is the &quot;j&quot;th observation in the &quot;i&quot;th out of formula_7 groups and formula_11 is the overall sample size. This &quot;F&quot;-statistic follows the &quot;F&quot;-distribution with degrees of freedom formula_12 and formula_13 under the null hypothesis. The statistic will be large if the between-group variability is large relative to the within-group variability, which is unlikely to happen if the population means of the groups all have the same value.

The result of the F test can be determined by comparing calculated F value and critical F value with specific significance level (e.g. 5%). The F table serves as a reference guide containing critical F values for the distribution of the F-statistic under the assumption of a true null hypothesis. It is designed to help determine the threshold beyond which the F statistic is expected to exceed a controlled percentage of the time (e.g., 5%) when the null hypothesis is accurate. To locate the critical F value in the F table, one needs to utilize the respective degrees of freedom. This involves identifying the appropriate row and column in the F table that corresponds to the significance level being tested (e.g., 5%).

How to use critical F values: 

If the F statistic &lt; the critical F value

* Fail to reject null hypothesis
* Reject alternative hypothesis
* There is no significant differences among sample averages 
* The observed differences among sample averages could be reasonably caused by random chance itself
* The result is not statistically significant 

If the F statistic &gt; the critical F value

* Accept alternative hypothesis
* Reject null hypothesis
* There is significant differences among sample averages 
* The observed differences among sample averages could not be reasonably caused by random chance itself
* The result is statistically significant 

Note that when there are only two groups for the one-way ANOVA &quot;F&quot;-test, formula_14where &quot;t&quot; is the Student&#x27;s formula_15 statistic.

==== Advantages ====

* Multi-group Comparison Efficiency: Facilitating simultaneous comparison of multiple groups, enhancing efficiency particularly in situations involving more than two groups.
* Clarity in Variance Comparison: Offering a straightforward interpretation of variance differences among groups, contributing to a clear understanding of the observed data patterns.
* Versatility Across Disciplines: Demonstrating broad applicability across diverse fields, including social sciences, natural sciences, and engineering.

==== Disadvantages ====

* Sensitivity to Assumptions: The F-test is highly sensitive to certain assumptions, such as homogeneity of variance and normality which can affect the accuracy of test results.
* Limited Scope to Group Comparisons: The F-test is tailored for comparing variances between groups, making it less suitable for analyses beyond this specific scope. 
* Interpretation Challenges: The F-test does not pinpoint specific group pairs with distinct variances. Careful interpretation is necessary, and additional post hoc tests are often essential for a more detailed understanding of group-wise differences.

===Multiple-comparison ANOVA problems===
The &quot;F&quot;-test in one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) is used to assess whether the expected values of a quantitative variable within several pre-defined groups differ from each other. For example, suppose that a medical trial compares four treatments. The ANOVA &quot;F&quot;-test can be used to assess whether any of the treatments are on average superior, or inferior, to the others versus the null hypothesis that all four treatments yield the same mean response. This is an example of an &quot;omnibus&quot; test, meaning that a single test is performed to detect any of several possible differences. Alternatively, we could carry out pairwise tests among the treatments (for instance, in the medical trial example with four treatments we could carry out six tests among pairs of treatments). The advantage of the ANOVA &quot;F&quot;-test is that we do not need to pre-specify which treatments are to be compared, and we do not need to adjust for making multiple comparisons. The disadvantage of the ANOVA &quot;F&quot;-test is that if we reject the null hypothesis, we do not know which treatments can be said to be significantly different from the others, nor, if the &quot;F&quot;-test is performed at level α, can we state that the treatment pair with the greatest mean difference is significantly different at level α.

===Regression problems===
Consider two models, 1 and 2, where model 1 is &#x27;nested&#x27; within model 2. Model 1 is the restricted model, and model 2 is the unrestricted one. That is, model 1 has &quot;p&quot;1 parameters, and model 2 has &quot;p&quot;2 parameters, where &quot;p&quot;1 &lt; &quot;p&quot;2, and for any choice of parameters in model 1, the same regression curve can be achieved by some choice of the parameters of model 2.

One common context in this regard is that of deciding whether a model fits the data significantly better than does a naive model, in which the only explanatory term is the intercept term, so that all predicted values for the dependent variable are set equal to that variable&#x27;s sample mean. The naive model is the restricted model, since the coefficients of all potential explanatory variables are restricted to equal zero.

Another common context is deciding whether there is a structural break in the data: here the restricted model uses all data in one regression, while the unrestricted model uses separate regressions for two different subsets of the data. This use of the F-test is known as the Chow test.

The model with more parameters will always be able to fit the data at least as well as the model with fewer parameters. Thus typically model 2 will give a better (i.e. lower error) fit to the data than model 1. But one often wants to determine whether model 2 gives a &quot;significantly&quot; better fit to the data. One approach to this problem is to use an &quot;F&quot;-test.

If there are &quot;n&quot; data points to estimate parameters of both models from, then one can calculate the &quot;F&quot; statistic, given by

:formula_16

where RSS&quot;i&quot; is the residual sum of squares of model &quot;i&quot;. If the regression model has been calculated with weights, then replace RSS&quot;i&quot; with χ2, the weighted sum of squared residuals. Under the null hypothesis that model 2 does not provide a significantly better fit than model 1, &quot;F&quot; will have an &quot;F&quot; distribution, with (&quot;p&quot;2−&quot;p&quot;1, &quot;n&quot;−&quot;p&quot;2) degrees of freedom. The null hypothesis is rejected if the &quot;F&quot; calculated from the data is greater than the critical value of the &quot;F&quot;-distribution for some desired false-rejection probability (e.g. 0.05). Since &quot;F&quot; is a monotone function of the likelihood ratio statistic, the &quot;F&quot;-test is a likelihood ratio test.

<doc id="318980" wikidata="Q194502" url="?curid=318980" title="Endorheic basin">
<text>An endorheic basin ( ; also endoreic basin and endorreic basin) is a drainage basin that normally retains water and allows no outflow to other external bodies of water (e.g. rivers and oceans); instead, the water drainage flows into permanent and seasonal lakes and swamps that equilibrate through evaporation. Endorheic basins are also called closed basins, terminal basins, and internal drainage systems.

Endorheic regions contrast with open lakes (exorheic regions), where surface waters eventually drain into the ocean. In general, water basins with subsurface outflows that lead to the ocean are not considered endorheic; but cryptorheic. Endorheic basins constitute local base levels, defining a limit of the erosion and deposition processes of nearby areas. Endorheic water bodies include the Caspian Sea, which is the world&#x27;s largest inland body of water.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;endorheic&quot; derives from the French word , which combines ( &#x27;within&#x27;) and &#x27;flow&#x27;.

==Endorheic lakes==
Endorheic lakes (terminal lakes) are bodies of water that do not flow into an ocean or a sea. Most of the water that falls to Earth percolates into the oceans and the seas by way of a network of rivers, lakes, and wetlands. Analogous to endorheic lakes is the class of bodies of water located in closed watersheds (endorheic watersheds) where the local topography prevents the drainage of water into the oceans and the seas. These endorheic watersheds (containing water in rivers or lakes that form a balance of surface inflows, evaporation and seepage) are often called sinks.

Endorheic lakes are typically located in the interior of a landmass, far from an ocean, and in areas of relatively low rainfall. Their watersheds are often confined by natural geologic land formations such as a mountain range, cutting off water egress to the ocean. The inland water flows into dry watersheds where the water evaporates, leaving a high concentration of minerals and other inflow erosion products. Over time this input of erosion products can cause the endorheic lake to become relatively saline (a &quot;salt lake&quot;). Since the main outflow pathways of these lakes are chiefly through evaporation and seepage, endorheic lakes are usually more sensitive to environmental pollutant inputs than water bodies that have access to oceans, as pollution can be trapped in them and accumulate over time.

==Occurrence==
Endorheic regions can occur in any climate but are most commonly found in desert locations. This reflects the balance between tectonic subsidence and rates of evaporation and sedimentation. Where the basin floor is dropping more rapidly than water and sediments can accumulate, any lake in the basin will remain below the sill level (the level at which water can find a path out of the basin). Low rainfall or rapid evaporation in the watershed favor this case. In areas where rainfall is higher, riparian erosion will generally carve drainage channels (particularly in times of flood), or cause the water level in the terminal lake to rise until it finds an outlet, breaking the enclosed endorheic hydrological system&#x27;s geographical barrier and opening it to the surrounding terrain. The Black Sea was likely such a lake, having once been an independent hydrological system before the Mediterranean Sea broke through the terrain separating the two. Lake Bonneville was another such lake, overflowing its basin in the Bonneville flood. The Malheur/Harney lake system in Oregon is normally cut off from drainage to the ocean, but has an outflow channel to the Malheur River. This is presently dry, but may have flowed as recently as 1,000 years ago.

Examples of relatively humid regions in endorheic basins often exist at high elevation. These regions tend to be marshy and are subject to substantial flooding in wet years. The area containing Mexico City is one such case, with annual precipitation of and characterized by waterlogged soils that require draining.

Endorheic regions tend to be far inland with their boundaries defined by mountains or other geological features that block their access to oceans. Since the inflowing water can evacuate only through seepage or evaporation, dried minerals or other products collect in the basin, eventually making the water saline and also making the basin vulnerable to pollution. Continents vary in their concentration of endorheic regions due to conditions of geography and climate. Australia has the highest percentage of endorheic regions at 21 per cent while North America has the least at five per cent. Approximately 18 per cent of the Earth&#x27;s land drains to endorheic lakes or seas, the largest of these land areas being the interior of Asia.
In deserts, water inflow is low and loss to solar evaporation high, drastically reducing the formation of complete drainage systems. In the extreme case, where there is no discernible drainage system, the basin is described as arheic. Closed water flow areas often lead to the concentration of salts and other minerals in the basin. Minerals leached from the surrounding rocks are deposited in the basin, and left behind when the water evaporates. Thus endorheic basins often contain extensive salt pans (also called salt flats, salt lakes, alkali flats, dry lake beds, or playas). These areas tend to be large, flat hardened surfaces and are sometimes used for aviation runways, or land speed record attempts, because of their extensive areas of perfectly level terrain.

Both permanent and seasonal endorheic lakes can form in endorheic basins. Some endorheic basins are essentially stable because climate change has reduced precipitation to the degree that a lake no longer forms. Even most permanent endorheic lakes change size and shape dramatically over time, often becoming much smaller or breaking into several smaller parts during the dry season. As humans have expanded into previously uninhabitable desert areas, the river systems that feed many endorheic lakes have been altered by the construction of dams and aqueducts. As a result, many endorheic lakes in developed or developing countries have contracted dramatically, resulting in increased salinity, higher concentrations of pollutants, and the disruption of ecosystems.

Even within exorheic basins, there can be &quot;non-contributing&quot;, low-lying areas that trap runoff and prevent it from contributing to flows downstream during years of average or below-average runoff. In flat river basins, non-contributing areas can be a large fraction of the river basin, e.g. Lake Winnipeg&#x27;s basin. A lake may be endorheic during dry years and can overflow its basin during wet years, e.g., the former Tulare Lake.

Because the Earth&#x27;s climate has recently been through a warming and drying phase with the end of the Ice Ages, many endorheic areas such as Death Valley that are now dry deserts were large lakes relatively recently. During the last ice age, the Sahara may have contained lakes larger than any now existing.

Climate change coupled with the mismanagement of water in these endorheic regions has led to devastating losses in ecosystem services and toxic surges of pollutants. The desiccation of saline lakes produces fine dust particles that impair agriculture productivity and harm human health. Anthropogenic activity has also caused a redistribution of water from these hydrologically landlocked basins such that endorheic water loss has contributed to sea level rise, and it is estimated that most of the terrestrial water lost ends up in the ocean. In regions such as Central Asia, where people depend on endorheic basins and other surface water sources to satisfy their water needs, human activity greatly impacts the availability of that water.

==Notable endorheic basins and lakes==


===Africa===
Large endorheic regions in Africa are located in the Sahara Desert, the Sahel, the Kalahari Desert, and the East African Rift:

* Chad Basin, in the northern centre of Africa. It covers an area of approximately 2.434 million km2.
* Qattara Depression, in Egypt.
* Chott Melrhir, in Algeria.
* Chott el Djerid, in Tunisia.
* The Okavango River, in the Kalahari Desert, is part of an endorheic basin region, the Okavango Basin, that also includes the Okavango Delta, Lake Ngami, the Nata River, and a number of salt pans such as Makgadikgadi Pan.
* Etosha Pan in Namibia&#x27;s Etosha National Park.
* Turkana Basin, in Kenya, whose basin includes the Omo River of Ethiopia.
* Lake Chilwa, in Malawi.
* Afar Depression, in Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Djibouti, which contains the Awash River
* Some Rift Valley lakes, such as Lake Abijatta, Lake Chew Bahir, Lake Shala, Lake Chamo, and Lake Awasa.
* Lake Mweru Wantipa, in Zambia.
* Lake Magadi, in Kenya.
* Lake Rukwa, in Tanzania.

===Antarctica===
Endorheic lakes exist in Antarctica&#x27;s McMurdo Dry Valleys, Victoria Land, the largest ice-free area.

*Don Juan Pond in Wright Valley is fed by groundwater from a rock glacier and remains unfrozen throughout the year.
*Lake Vanda in Wright Valley has a perennial ice cover, the edges of which melt in the summer, allowing flow from the longest river in Antarctica, the Onyx River. The lake is over 70 m deep and is hypersaline.
*Lake Bonney is in Taylor Valley and has a perennial ice cover and two lobes separated by the Bonney Riegel. Glacial melt and discharge from Blood Falls feed the lake. Its unique glacial history has resulted in hypersaline brine in the bottom waters and fresh water at the surface.
*Lake Hoare, in Taylor Valley, is the freshest of the Dry Valley lakes, receiving its melt almost exclusively from the Canada Glacier. The lake has an ice cover and forms a moat during the Austral summer.
*Lake Fryxell is adjacent to the Ross Sea in Taylor Valley. The lake has an ice cover and receives its water from numerous glacial meltwater streams for approximately six weeks out of the year. Its salinity increases with depth.

===Asia===

Much of Western and Central Asia is a giant endorheic region made up of a number of contiguous closed basins. The region contains several basins and terminal lakes, including:

* The Caspian Sea, the largest lake on Earth. A large part of western Russia, drained by the Volga River, is part of the Caspian basin.
*Lake Urmia in Western Azerbaijan Province of Iran.
* The Aral Sea, whose tributary rivers have been diverted, leading to a dramatic shrinkage of the lake. The resulting ecological disaster has brought the plight of internal drainage basins to public attention.
* Lake Balkhash, in Kazakhstan.
* Issyk-Kul Lake and Chatyr-Kul Lake in Kyrgyzstan.
* Lop Lake, in the Tarim Basin of China&#x27;s Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
* The Dzungarian Basin in Xinjiang, separated from the Tarim Basin by the Tian Shan. The most notable terminal lake in the basin is the Manas Lake.
* The Central Asian Internal Drainage Basin, in southern and western Mongolia, contains a series of closed drainage basins, such as the Khyargas Nuur basin, the Uvs Nuur basin, which includes Üüreg Lake, and the Pu-Lun-To River Basin.
* Qaidam Basin, in Qinghai Province, China, as well as nearby Qinghai Lake.
* Sistan Basin covering areas of Iran and Afghanistan
* Pangong Tso and Aksai Chin Lake on the China-India border
* Many small lakes and rivers of the Iranian Plateau, including Gavkhouni marshes and Namak Lake.

Other endorheic lakes and basins in Asia include:

* The Dead Sea, the lowest surface point on Earth and one of its saltiest bodies of water lies between Israel and Jordan.
* Sambhar Lake, in Rajasthan, north-western India
* Lake Van in eastern Turkey
* Sabkhat al-Jabbul, extensive salt flats and a lake in Syria.
* Solar Lake, Sinai, near the Israeli-Egypt border.
* Lake Tuz, in Turkey, in south part of Central Anatolia Region.
* Sawa lake in Iraq, in Muthanna Governorate.

===Australia===
Australia, being very dry and having exceedingly low runoff ratios due to its ancient soils, has many endorheic drainages. The most important are:

* Lake Eyre basin, which drains into the highly variable Lake Eyre and includes Lake Frome.
* Lake Torrens, usually an endorheic lake to the west of the Flinders Ranges in South Australia, that flows to the sea after extreme rainfall events.
* Lake Corangamite, a highly saline crater lake in western Victoria.
* Lake George, formerly connected to the Murray-Darling Basin

===Europe===
Though a large portion of Europe drains to the endorheic Caspian Sea, Europe&#x27;s wet climate means it contains relatively few terminal lakes itself: any such basin is likely to continue to fill until it reaches an overflow level connecting it with an outlet or erodes the barrier blocking its exit.

There are some seemingly endorheic lakes, but they are cryptorheic, being drained either through manmade canals, via karstic phenomena, or other subsurface seepage.

* Lake Neusiedl, in Austria and Hungary.
* Lake Trasimeno, in Italy.
* Fucine Lake, in Italy. Now drained.
* Lake Velence, in Hungary.
* Lake Prespa, between Albania, Greece and North Macedonia.
* Rahasane Turlough, the largest turlough in Ireland.
* Laacher See, in Germany.
* The Lasithi Plateau in Crete, Greece, is a high endorheic plateau.

A few minor true endorheic lakes exist in Spain (e.g. Laguna de Gallocanta, Estany de Banyoles), Italy, Cyprus (Larnaca and Akrotiri salt lakes) and Greece.

===North and Central America===

* The Great Basin is North America&#x27;s largest and the world&#x27;s ninth largest endorheic basin, covering nearly all of Nevada, much of Oregon and Utah, and portions of California, Idaho, and Wyoming. Notable enclosed basins include Death Valley, the hottest location on Earth; the Black Rock Desert and Bonneville Salt Flats, location of many of the new vehicle land speed records set since the 1930s; the Great Salt Lake, remnant of Lake Bonneville; and the Salton Sea.
*The Valley of Mexico. In Pre-Columbian times, the Valley was substantially covered with five lakes, including Lake Texcoco, Lake Xochimilco, and Lake Chalco.
* Guzmán Basin, in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States. The Mimbres River of New Mexico drains into this basin.
* Lago Atitlán, a volcanic caldera lake in the highlands of Guatemala. It is cryptorheic.
* Lago Coatepeque, El Salvador.
* Bolsón de Mapimí, in northern Mexico.
* Willcox Playa of southern Arizona.
* Tulare Lake in the San Joaquin Valley in Central California, fed by the Kaweah and Tule Rivers plus southern distributaries of the Kings. Historically, it would drain into the San Joaquin River in very wet years. Agricultural development and irrigation diversions have left the lake dry.
* Buena Vista Lake at the southmost end of the San Joaquin Valley in Southern California, fed by the Kern River. Historically, it would drain into Tulare Lake and the San Joaquin River in exceptionally wet years. Agricultural development and irrigation diversions have left the lake dry.
* Crater Lake, in Oregon, a cryptorheic lake with subsurface drainage to the Wood River. It is filled directly by rain and snow and has very little mineral or salt buildup.
* The Great Divide Basin in Wyoming, a small endorheic basin that straddles the Continental Divide of the Americas.
* Devils Lake, in North Dakota.
* Devil&#x27;s Lake, in Wisconsin, cryptorheic.
* Tule Lake and the Lost River basin in California and Oregon.
* Little Manitou Lake in Saskatchewan.
* Old Wives Lake, on the Laurentian Divide in Saskatchewan.
* Quill Lakes, in Saskatchewan.
* Pakowki Lake, on the Laurentian Divide in Alberta.
* Paynes Prairie, in Florida. Since 1927, it has been drained by canal to the Atlantic Ocean via the River Styx.
* Spotted Lake, Osoyoos, British Columbia, Canada.
* Several lakes on the western Chilcotin Plateau sit on the divide between the Fraser River drainage to the east and the Homathko drainage to the west. Such examples include Choelquoit Lake, Eagle Lake, and Martin lake. 
* Frame Lake in Yellowknife, capital of Canada&#x27;s Northwest Territories.
* New Mexico has several desert endorheic basins, including:
** The Tularosa Basin, a rift valley.
** Zuñi Salt Lake, a maar.
** The Mimbres River Basin, in Grant County.
** The San Agustin Basin, in Catron and Socorro Counties.
* Lago Enriquillo on the island of Hispaniola in the Caribbean Sea.

Many small lakes and ponds in North Dakota and the Northern Great Plains are endorheic, and some have salt encrustations along their shores.

===South America===
* Laguna del Carbón, in Gran Bajo de San Julián, Argentina – the lowest point in the Western and Southern hemispheres
* Lake Mar Chiquita in Argentina
* The Altiplano includes a number of closed basins such as the Salar de Coipasa, and Titicaca–Poopó system
* Lake Valencia, in Venezuela
* Salar de Atacama, in the Atacama Desert, Chile

==Ancient==
Some of Earth&#x27;s ancient endorheic systems and lakes include:

* The Black Sea, until its merger with the Mediterranean.
* The Mediterranean Sea itself and all its tributary basins, during its Messinian desiccation (approximately five million years ago) as it became disconnected from the Atlantic Ocean.
* The Orcadian Basin in Scotland during the Devonian period. Now identifiable as lacustrine sediments buried around and off the coast.
* Lake Tanganyika in Africa. Currently high enough to connect to rivers entering the sea.
* Lake Lahontan in North America.
* Lake Bonneville in North America. The basin was not always endorheic; at times, it overflowed through Red Rock Pass to the Snake River and the sea.
* Lake Chewaucan in North America.
* Tularosa Basin and Lake Cabeza de Vaca in North America. The basin was formerly much larger than it is today, including the ancestral Rio Grande north of Texas, which fed a large lake area. 
* Ebro and Duero basins, draining most of northern Spain during the Neogene and perhaps Pliocene. Climate change and erosion of the Catalan coastal mountains, as well as the deposition of alluvium in the terminal lake, allowed the Ebro basin to overflow into the sea during the middle-to-late Miocene.

<text>Haymarket is a street in the St James&#x27;s area of the City of Westminster, London. It runs from Piccadilly Circus in the north to Pall Mall at the southern end. Located on the street are the Theatre Royal, His Majesty&#x27;s Theatre, New Zealand House, a cinema complex and restaurants.

==History==
===Origins===
The broad street connecting Pall Mall with Piccadilly is recorded in the Elizabethan era and, as the name suggests, was chiefly used as a street market for the sale of fodder and other farm produce. At that time, it was a rural spot, with the village of Charing the closest settlement. This practice continued to the reign of William III; by that time, carts carrying hay and straw were allowed in the street to trade, toll-free. In 1692, when the street was paved, a tax was levied on the loads: 3d for a load of hay and 2d for one of straw. In 1830, the market was moved by Act of Parliament to Cumberland Market near Regent&#x27;s Park.

In earlier centuries, the Haymarket was also one of the centres of prostitution in London, but this is no longer the case. &quot;Old and New London&quot; informs us, in 1878:

Situated in the centre of the pleasure-going Westend population, the Haymarket is a great place for hotels, supper-houses, and foreign cafés; and it need hardly be added here, that so many of its taverns became the resort of the loosest characters, after the closing of the theatres, who turned night into day, and who were so constantly appearing before the sitting magistrates in consequence of drunken riots and street rows, that the Legislature interfered, and an Act of Parliament was passed, compelling the closing of such houses of refreshment at twelve o&#x27;clock.

===Theatres===
It is part of London&#x27;s theatre district, the West End, and has been a theatrical location at least since the 17th century. The Queen&#x27;s Theatre in the Haymarket, designed by John Vanbrugh, opened in 1705 on the site of what is now His Majesty&#x27;s Theatre. It was intended for drama, but the acoustics turned out to be more suitable for opera, and from 1710 to 1745, most operas and some oratorios of George Frederick Handel were premièred at this theatre, which was renamed the King&#x27;s Theatre at the death of Queen Anne in 1714. After Vanbrugh&#x27;s building had been destroyed by fire in 1790, another King&#x27;s Theatre on the same site followed. After another fire, Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre was opened there in 1897. This building, the fourth on the same site, is still in use for major musical productions. Its title changes with the sex of the monarch: it became His Majesty&#x27;s Theatre in 1902 following the death of Queen Victoria, Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre in 1952 when Elizabeth II succeeded her father, and, after the death of Elizabeth II in 2022, has reverted to His Majesty&#x27;s Theatre. Today&#x27;s Theatre Royal at another site in the Haymarket is a building originally designed by John Nash (1820), replacing a previous theatre of the 1720s.

==Haymarket today==
Haymarket runs parallel to Regent Street St James (Lower Regent Street) and together the two roads form a one-way system, Lower Regent Street taking northbound traffic and Haymarket taking southbound traffic. The two roads are classified as part of the A4 route from London to Avonmouth, near Bristol.

On 29 June 2007, the Metropolitan Police Service &quot;made safe&quot; a car bomb that had been parked in Haymarket as part of the 2007 London attempted attacks.

<doc id="318989" wikidata="Q7768947" url="?curid=318989" title="The Three Bears (comic strip)">
<text>The Three Bears was a long-running British comic strip which appeared in the British comics magazine &quot;The Beano&quot;. It first featured in 1959&#x27;s issue 881 and ran sporadically until 2011 through reprints and several artists.

==Synopsis==
Ma and Pa Bear and their young son Teddy (later called Ted) were three anthropomorphic bears who lived in a setting loosely based on the American Wild West. They were lazy and gluttonous, and lived in a cave upon a hill. Most storylines revolved around their attempts to steal &quot;grub&quot; from the local storekeeper Hank (who often shoots at the Three Bears with his blunderbuss for trying to rob him). There was the occasional appearance by the local sheriff, and their rival bear Grizzly Gus (who had a son called Gus&#x27;s Grizzly).

==Publication history==
It made its first appearance in issue 881, drawn by Leo Baxendale at first and then by Bob McGrath for most of its run.

Originally disappearing from the comic after issue 2253, by which time McGrath had departed and briefly been replaced by Tom Lavery, the strip has returned to &quot;The Beano&quot; several times since then, between 1988 and 1995, re-appearing from issues 2391 and 2674. The first re-launch was drawn by Bob Dewar, and the second originally by David Parkins, who drew it for much of the mid-1990s, then Robert Nixon later on. Parkins&#x27; version is cited by former &quot;Beano&quot; editor Euan Kerr as one of his favourite strips.

===1999–2007 strips===
The strip appeared again in 2000, when, after being a &#x27;Guest Star&#x27; since the previous year, it was voted into the comic by &quot;Beano&quot; readers, beating Tricky Dicky, Inspector Horse and Jocky and Gordon Bennett. This time it was drawn by Mike Pearse, but in 2002 Chris McGhie replaced him to relieve Pearse&#x27;s workload, although the strip was drawn in a largely similar style.

After a vote in 2006, the Three Bears re-appeared as reprints of the 1990s David Parkins strips. He had also drawn Fred&#x27;s Bed, Dennis the Menace and Gnasher, and Billy Whizz, all of which have been reprinted in some form. In the 2007 Christmas special (reprinted from the 2000 Christmas &quot;Beano&quot;), The Three Bears had a present delivered by Billy Whizz, before they return to Beanotown at the end of the strip.

They appeared in the Beano Annual 2007 again drawn by Parkins, and in the Beano Annual 2008 in which Ted shaves off animals&#x27; hair including Pa&#x27;s. This was drawn by Ken Harrison. They made another appearance in &quot;The Beano&quot;″s 2008 Summer Special, again drawn by Chris McGhie. In the 2009 annual they were drawn by Hunt Emerson, appearing alongside another Western-themed &quot;Beano&quot; star, Little Plum.

Their final new story in the weekly comic came in issue 3365 of &quot;The Beano&quot;, drawn by Tom Paterson. This was a new strip, not a reprint. The characters later reappeared three years later in issue 3541.

===Recent appearances===
In annuals, they have been drawn by Mike Pearse (2001, 2002, 2003), Chris McGhie (2004), Ken Harrison (2005, 2006, 2008), David Parkins (2007), Hunt Emerson (2009) and David Sutherland (2012).

The Three Bears are often seen in the &quot;BeanoMAX&quot; and &quot;Beano&quot; annuals, although they hardly ever make appearances in the comic itself. They continued weekly in the comic, as reprints of the Mike Pearse strips until early 2011 when the strip stopped appearing. In the 2012 Beano Annual, their strip was drawn by David Sutherland.

The Three Bears are featured in the 2015 Beano Annual.
The Three Bears made a cameo appearance in the 2022 Beano annual, in two panels of a Betty and hse Yeti.

==Parodies of the strip==
The strip was the subject of two parodies by the adult comic &quot;Viz&quot;.
*The first was a surreal parody entitled &#x27;The Three Chairs&#x27;, about a family of three chairs who lived in a cave and frequently robbed Frank&#x27;s Store for food.
*The second was called &#x27;Three Blairs&#x27; in which Pa represented the then British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Ma represented Cherie Blair (Tony Blair&#x27;s wife), Ted represented Leo Blair (Tony Blair&#x27;s youngest son), and Hank represented the then British Chancellor Gordon Brown. In this story the Three Blairs plan to rob &quot;Hank&#x27;s&quot; store so that &quot;Pa&quot; won&#x27;t faint in the House of Commons due to hunger. To distract &quot;Hank&quot; while &quot;Ma&quot; and &quot;Ted&quot; rob the store &quot;Pa&quot; stages a press conference outside &quot;Hank&#x27;s&quot; store and states that all the conditions have been met for Britain to start using the Euro. &quot;Hank&quot; promptly states this is untrue and chases after &quot;Pa&quot; while shooting at him. Though this plan works &quot;Ma&quot; and &quot;Ted&quot; have eaten all the food by the time &quot;Pa&quot; has returned home. In the last panel the newspaper reads that the Prime Minister has fainted in the House of Commons. Coincidentally this strip was drawn by Brian Walker, a former &quot;Beano&quot; artist, albeit never on The Three Bears.
*&#x27;The Three Shakespeares&#x27; also appeared in &quot;Viz&quot; in February/March 1999. The Shakespeares were engaged in attempting to steal sonnets from Christopher Marlowe, who in one scene had left them out on the windowsill &quot;to cool&quot;. Eventually they were given a slap-up meal by Francis Bacon: &quot;Slobber. Our favourite – dramatic monologues composed in iambic decasyllabic blank verse. And mash.&quot;
Bryan Talbot&#x27;s graphic novel series &quot;Grandville&quot; - set in a world of anthropomorphised animals - features a cameo by the bears as a musical hall act called Les Baxendales.

<text>Bootsie and Snudge is a British sitcom that aired on ITV for three series from 1960 to 1963, with a fourth in 1974. The show is a spin-off of &quot;The Army Game&quot;, a sitcom about soldiers undertaking national service, and follows two of the main characters (played by Alfie Bass and Bill Fraser) after they returned to civilian life. The first series is titled Bootsie and Snudge in Civvy Life. Between the 1963 and 1974 series, a spin-off called &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; was broadcast.

==Background==
Bass and Fraser acted together in minor roles in the 1956 comedy film &quot;Jumping for Joy&quot; starring Frankie Howerd and possibly developed a friendship from that point.

Private Montague &#x27;Bootsie&#x27; Bisley and Sergeant-Major Claude Snudge are two of the main characters in the successful sitcom &quot;The Army Game&quot; that aired from 1957 to 1961. Snudge enjoys his position of superiority over Bootsie, whilst Bootsie feels comfortable in his position as it allows him to mock and hate Snudge (and attack authority in general). Clive Dunn plays 83-year-old Henry, despite being only 38 at the time. Dunn is introduced as &quot;Meadows&quot; then seconds later screen time, he is called &quot;Johnson&quot;. In 1961 a comic strip was published in &quot;TV Comic&quot; telling the story of how &quot;Bootsie and Snudge&quot; began.

A large team of writers wrote for the series over its 104 episodes. Those that wrote for the 1960–63 episodes were Marty Feldman, Barry Took, John Antrobus, Ray Rigby, David Cumming, Derek Collyer, Peter Miller, James Kelly, Peter Lambda, Stanley Myers, Tom Espie, Jack Rosenthal, Harry Driver, Patrick Ryan, John Smith and Doug Eden. The 1974 series was written by David Climie, Ronnie Cass and Lew Schwarz.

The series established the reputation of actor Clive Dunn as a player of old men in comedies, leading to his more famous role as Corporal Jones in &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;, along with release of a hit single, &quot;Grandad&quot; in 1971.

==Cast==
*Alfie Bass – Montague &#x27;Bootsie&#x27; Bisley
*Bill Fraser – Claude Snudge
*Clive Dunn – Henry Beerbohm Johnson &quot;(series 1 – 3)&quot;
*Robert Dorning – Hesketh Pendleton &quot;(series 1 – 3)&quot;

==Plot==

===Series 1 to 3===
Bootsie and Snudge are de-mobbed from their national service and are employed as handyman and hall porter respectively at the Imperial, a Pall Mall gentleman&#x27;s club run by hot-headed secretary Hesketh Pendleton. One of their colleagues, the bumbling Henry Beerbohm Johnson, has worked at the Imperial for 40 years and to begin with believes Snudge is Lord Kitchener. Storylines revolve around the club&#x27;s members and guests and the relationships between the four members of staff. Hesketh Pendleton has no time for anyone who disagrees with him, and will drown out their attempts to talk by saying &quot;Tup! Tup!&quot; louder and louder until they give up. Bootsie naturally refers to him as &quot;Ol&#x27; Tup-tup&quot;.

===Series 4===
Ten years later, and the positions have reversed as Bootsie wins £1 million on the Football pools and Snudge – an employee of Permapools – becomes his self-appointed financial adviser.

==Episodes==
A total of four series of &quot;Bootsie and Snudge&quot; were made, the first three in black-and-white and the final series in colour. The first series of 40 episodes aired from 23 September 1960 to 23 June 1961 on Fridays at 8.55 pm. The second series, consisting of 29 episodes, was shown from 27 October 1961 to 10 May 1962 – originally on Fridays at 8.55 pm then Thursdays at 8.30pm. The third series, also of 29 episodes, broadcast from 8 November 1962 to 30 May 1963 on Thursdays at 7.30 pm. The final series, of just six episodes, went out over a decade later from 16 October 1974 to 20 November 1974, on Wednesdays at 8.30 pm.

Not all 104 episodes of &quot;Bootsie and Snudge&quot; have survived. Four episodes are missing from the archives, episode 40 from series 1 and three episodes from the third series (&quot;The Rescue&quot;, &quot;Soul Mates&quot; and &quot;Carnet de Balham&quot;).

==DVD releases==
The surviving 39 episodes of series one were released by the Network imprint on 13 August 2012. The complete second series was released on 22 July 2013. Previously a single episode of &quot;Bootsie and Snudge&quot; had been released on &quot;The Army Game – Volume 2&quot; DVD on 14 August 2006.

==Media spin-offs==

The sitcom was adapted into a comic strip by Bill Titcombe.

<text>Halabja (, ) is a city in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq and the capital of Halabja Governorate, located about northeast of Baghdad and from the Iranian border.

The city lies at the base of what is often referred to as the greater Hewraman region stretching across the Iran–Iraq border. Halabja is surrounded by Hawraman and Shnrwe range in the northeast, Balambo range in the south and Sirwan river in the west. The Kurds in the city of Halabja generally speak only the Sorani dialect of Kurdish, but some residents of the surrounding villages speak the Hewrami dialect.

==History==
===Early history===
The history of Halabja is believed to have started during the Akkadian Empire period (24th century BC). The ancient city-kingdom of Lullubi from that period is thought to be located in Halabja area.

The excavations at nearby archaeological sites like Bakr Awa revealed a long history. The cemetery there includes the tombs of several historical figures, such as Ahmed Mukhtar Jaff, Tayar Bag Jaff and Adila Khanim. In August 2009, three 17th century tombs were discovered in the Ababile district of the town.

This suggests that the town is somewhat older than indicated by some sources, which claim that it was built by the Ottoman Empire at about 1850. However, modern developments date from the early 20th century. The post office opened in 1924 and the first school opened the following year. The Qaysari Pasha and Hamid Bag bazaars were built-in 1932. Electricity did not reach the city until 1940.

At the beginning of the 20th century, there were many British soldiers stationed in Halabja. During World War I, Adela Khanum saved the lives of several British soldiers, resulting in the British honoring her with the title Khan Bahadur, Princess of the Brave. She was also responsible for the building of a new prison, setting up a court of justice, of which she was the first president and building a new bazaar.

During the Al-Anfal campaign of the Iraqi Government, which took place between March 1987 and May 1989, the neighborhoods Kani Ashqan and Mordana were erased in May 1987 as a reprisal for the support of the Peshmerga. But Halabja suffered much more during the Al-Anfal campaign, in which Saddam Hussein violently suppressed Kurdish revolts during the Iran–Iraq War.

===Chemical attack===

The Kurdish Peshmerga guerrillas, supported by Iran, captured Halabja in the final phase of the Iran–Iraq War. At 11:00 AM, On March 16, 1988, after two days of conventional artillery attacks, Iraqi planes dropped gas canisters on the town. The town and surrounding district were attacked with bombs, artillery fire and chemical weapons, the last of which proved most devastating. At least 5,000 people died as an immediate result of the chemical attack and it is estimated that a further 7,000 people were injured or suffered long-term illness. Most of the victims of the attack on the town of Halabja were Kurdish civilians.

The attack is believed to have included the nerve agents Tabun, Sarin and VX, as well as mustard gas. However, according to former senior CIA analyst Stephen C. Pelletiere, Iraq did not have the nerve agent used in the attack but did have mustard gas which was used in the Iran–Iraq War. An interdisciplinary scientific study from 2019, after more than three decades, shows that the chemical attacks on Halabja have long-term biological, psychological and social effects on the survivors. The authors, Faraidoun Moradi, Mia Söderberg, Fazil Moradi and others conclude: &quot;The post-exposure somatic and psychosocial effects such as respiratory symptoms of CWA are a plausible contributors to poor general health and quality of life among survivors. We conclude that multidisciplinary interventions are needed to tackle the biopsychosocial complications in survivors of SM exposure to minimize further health damage in the future, as well as to promote their health-related quality of life.&quot;

It is occasionally suggested that cyanide was also included among these chemical weapons, though this assertion has been cast into doubt, as cyanide is a natural byproduct of impure Tabun.

Before the war ended the Iraqis moved in on the ground and completely destroyed the town. In March 2010, the Iraqi High Criminal Court recognized the Halabja massacre as genocide; the decision was welcomed by the Kurdistan Regional Government.

===Kurdish autonomy===
In the mountains to the east of Halabja, a militant Kurdish Islamist group, Ansar al-Islam, occupied a small enclave in the period of 2000–2003. The area was overrun by Peshmerga forces from the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), with U.S. air support, at the beginning of the 2003 US invasion of Iraq. The town has remained a center of Islamism in the Kurdistan region, however.

Just before Kurds gained some autonomy over the Iraqi Kurdistan region in 1991, which included Halabja, a new town was set up where some former Kurdish refugees later relocated. The new town called &quot;Halabja Taza&quot; (or &quot;New Halabja&quot;) today has an estimated 9,000 homes.

The Kurdistan Regional Government made some concentrated reconstruction efforts after 2003 in the old town and began rebuilding some of the bombed-out homes in Halabja and paving new roads. A memorial was also constructed for the victims of the chemical attacks. However, residents of Halabja have complained about the continued lack of basic services and necessities.

On the 2006 anniversary of the gas attack, violent demonstrations erupted in Halabja. An estimated 7,000 demonstrators protested against priorities in reconstruction, claiming that officials were not sincerely addressing the problems of the gas attack victims. Roadblocks were set up and the gas attack memorial museum was set afire. Police fired at protesters killing one 14-year-old boy and wounding many others.

=== Modern times ===
In 2008, plans were announced to construct an international airport for the city.

On 12 November 2017 at 21:18 local time, an earthquake struck approximately south-southwest of Halabja.

==Climate==
Halabja has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csa&quot;) with very hot summers and cool wet winters.

==Topography== 
Halabja is located in the Shahrizor plain, a fertile valley nestled in the foothills of the Zagros Mountains in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. The city&#x27;s elevation is around 700 meters above sea level. The surrounding area is characterized by mountainous terrain, with the Hawraman Mountain range to the east, which plays a significant role in the city’s climate and geography. The region’s topography includes rolling hills and valleys, making it ideal for agriculture, particularly in the fertile plains.

<text>The Stadium of Light is an all-seater football stadium in Sunderland, England, and the eighth and current home to Sunderland A.F.C. With space for 49,000 spectators, the Stadium of Light is the ninth largest football stadium in England. The stadium primarily hosts Sunderland A.F.C. home matches. The stadium was named by chairman Bob Murray to reflect the coal mining heritage of the North East and the former Monkwearmouth Colliery site on which it stands. A Davy lamp monument stands at the entrance to reflect the coal mining industry that brought prosperity to the town.

As well as hosting Sunderland games, the stadium has hosted three matches for the England national football team, as well as an England under-20, an England under-21 and two England women&#x27;s team matches. With an original capacity of 42,000, it was expanded in 2000 to seat 49,000. Its simple design is apparently to allow for redevelopments up to a capacity of 64,000. The attendance record at the Stadium of Light is 48,353 set on 13 April 2002, when Sunderland played Liverpool with the visitors running out 1–0 winners. Along with hosting football matches, the stadium has played host to performers such as Beyoncé, Rihanna, Oasis, Take That, Kings of Leon, P!nk, Coldplay, Spice Girls and Elton John. The ground also holds conference and banqueting suites, the &#x27;Black Cats Bar&#x27;, and a club shop selling Sunderland merchandise.

==Planning and construction==
Following the release of the Taylor Report in January 1990, Sunderland was obliged to make plans to turn their Roker Park home into an all-seater stadium. Roker Park was a ground that mainly consisted of standing terraces, and if converted into all-seater it would have held far fewer spectators than before. Enclosed by residential streets on all sides, expansion was practically impossible. So, by 1991, Sunderland chairman Bob Murray had started to scour the local area for possible sites to build a new all-seater stadium.

The front-runner that emerged was a proposed stadium located on an area of land adjacent to the Nissan car plant. The 49,000 all-seater ground was labelled &quot;the Wembley of the North&quot; by Sunderland fans and would boast a capacity that not even Manchester United&#x27;s Old Trafford exceeded until 1996. The plans did not come to fruition. Shortly after the plans were announced in 1992, Nissan launched an official objection, ultimately forcing Sunderland to abandon the idea. By 1995, the site of the Wearmouth Colliery, which had closed in December 1993, was identified as the club&#x27;s preferred location for a new stadium. The area, on the north bank of the River Wear in the Sheepfolds district of Sunderland, was only a few hundred yards from Roker Park, and close to the centre of the city.

In 1993, Sunderland&#x27;s planned new stadium was on the shortlist for Euro 96 venues, as England had been named as hosts of the competition in May 1992. However, it soon become clear that a new stadium in Sunderland would not be ready in time for the tournament.

On 13 November 1995, the Sunderland chairman Bob Murray announced that the Tyne and Wear Development Corporation had approved plans for Sunderland to build a 34,000-seater stadium on the Monkwearmouth site.
Ballast Wiltshier plc, a contracting company that had built the Amsterdam Arena, was contracted to build the stadium at an initial cost of £15 million. In June 1996, as the planned capacity rose to more than 40,000, construction work began. The capacity was revised again in early 1997, and the stadium was completed on time, with a capacity of 42,000. The stadium&#x27;s design allows possible expansion of a further tier; completed expansion of the whole upper tier would produce a capacity of 63,000, although it is believed by some that the stadium can expand to a maximum capacity of 84,000, this would seem unlikely ever to be exercised.

The stadium was opened on 30 July 1997 by Prince Andrew, Duke of York, with bands such as Status Quo, Upside Down and Kavana playing. To celebrate the opening of the stadium, Sunderland played a friendly against the Dutch side Ajax, which was drawn 0–0.

The move did not happen without criticism. Famous actor and Sunderland supporter, often named in the media &quot;Sunderland&#x27;s most famous supporter&quot;, Peter O&#x27;Toole, said he wasn&#x27;t as much a fan as he used to be since the team left Roker Park. Playwright Tom Kelly and actor Paul Dunn created a one-man play called &quot;I Left My Heart at Roker Park&quot; about a fan struggling with the move and what Roker Park meant for him - the play originally ran in 1997, and had a few revivals since.

The North Stand was extended in 2000 to bring the capacity to 49,000, costing the club a further £7 million, making the final cost of the stadium £23 million. On 18 July 2006, a statue of 1973 FA Cup Final winning manager Bob Stokoe was unveiled outside the stadium. At the end of season Football League awards, the Stadium of Light was named the &quot;Best Away Ground&quot;, with other contenders including Crewe Alexandra&#x27;s Alexandra Stadium and Plymouth Argyle&#x27;s Home Park. Sunderland celebrated the tenth anniversary of the stadium with a pre-season friendly against Juventus on 6 August 2007; the game was drawn 1–1.

== Name ==
During construction, the stadium had not adopted an official name, and had been known colloquially as the &quot;Wearside Stadium&quot; and &quot;New Roker Park&quot;.

The name was eventually revealed as the Stadium of Light at a naming ceremony on 30 July 1997, hours before the opening game against Ajax (0-0). Speaking at the naming event, Bob Murray explained the inspiration for the name came from the Coal mining heritage of the region and the stadium&#x27;s Monkwearmouth Colliery site:&quot;For many years, miners at Wearmouth Colliery carried with them a Davy lamp as part of their working lives. Reflecting this tradition, the name allows the image of this light to shine forever.&quot;

To emphasise the fact, a statue of a miner&#x27;s Davy lamp was located in front of the stadium&#x27;s ticket office, adjacent to the stadium. The stadium name had been associated with the area since 1970 when it appeared in a Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus episode &quot;Literary Football&quot;, which was hosted by a native of South Shields, Eric Idle.

The name initially drew mixed reactions from Sunderland fans many unhappy that the name was already associated with the home ground of S.L. Benfica. A film crew for the Premier Passions documentary series recorded the moment that Bob Murray faced Sunderland fans immediately after the naming with many expressing their disappointment. The similarity to the name of Benfica&#x27;s home, Estádio da Luz, often anglicised to &quot;The Stadium of Light&quot;, has led to some visiting fans and reporters to erroneously assume that Sunderland&#x27;s home was named after the Portuguese stadium. Murray responded directly to this in a 2017 interview with the Evening Chronicle, in which he said
&quot;The Estadio de Luz in Portugal isn’t the Stadium of Light, it is named after the area – Luz. It’s like, say, Elland Road or Old Trafford. We are the only club whose stadium has that name, and it was because of the history of the region that I named it&quot;.In the same interview, Murray revealed that shortly after the stadium opened he was approached by a representative of the Labour government asking if he would consider renaming the stadium after Diana, Princess of Wales, who died in September 1997. Murray refused the request as he believed the stadium should be named in honour of those in the region who had worked in darkness.

The &#x27;Of Light&#x27; suffix became a recognisable part of the Sunderland A.F.C. brand, and was used in a number of other areas related to the club; the Academy of Light is the club&#x27;s training facility and youth academy, the Foundation of Light is a registered charity affiliated with the club and the Beacon of Light is a sports and education centre, owned by the Foundation, which is adjacent to the stadium. The club&#x27;s official magazine was called &quot;Legion of Light&quot; before it was discontinued in January 2017.

In March 2010, Sunderland Chairman Niall Quinn announced the club were considering plans to sell naming rights to the stadium as a new way to boost income. The plans were shelved shortly after. The possibility of selling the naming rights was floated again by chief executive Margaret Byrne in 2013. Discussing the options of selling the stadium name in October 2018, chairman Stewart Donald said:&quot;I think the fans should have a say on whether they are comfortable with it. My gut feel is that even if we didn&#x27;t consult with them, the vibe I get is that they aren&#x27;t particularly attached to the name of the stadium. It&#x27;s not a sacred thing like some of the other grounds.&quot;

==Structure and facilities==

The stadium is in the shape of a square bowl, and is separated into the West Stand, North Stand, East Stand and the Roker End (South Stand). The stands have all formerly had commercial names as part of sponsorship deals, e.g. the Vaux Stand (West), the Carling Stand (North), Fosters Stand (East) and the Metro FM Stand (South). The South Stand was renamed to the Roker End in December 2018, following a poll organised by the Red &amp; White Army supporters club. The Roker End was the name of the stand behind the goal at the southern end Sunderland&#x27;s former ground, Roker Park.

The West Stand includes the Premier Concourse which is the name of the upper tier and a number of executive boxes. The North Stand also includes an upper tier, formerly branded the Strongbow Upper, which contained the exterior seating for the Black Cats Bar, an enhanced match-day experience with padded seating and an exclusive catering facilities and bar. When the away fans were relocated in 2012, the Black Cats Bar seating was relocated to the rear of the North Stand lower tier.

Within the stadium is a concourse, housing the turnstiles, emergency exits, food kiosks, bars and toilet facilities. The concourse allows uninterrupted spectator access throughout the inner stadium bowl, with the exception being a gap between the South Stand and the South West corner. The concourse is linked to the seating bowl via a series of access ramps. The South East corner of the stadium is designated as the Family Zone, and has family-oriented branding within the concourse, as well as entertainment such as PlayStation 4 consoles.

Away fans were seated in the west half of the South Stand when the ground opened in 1997, but in November 2011, the club announced that the away supporters&#x27; section would be moved from the South Stand to the North Stand Upper from the beginning of the 2012–13 season.

The pitch is several metres below the level of the ground outside the stadium. The pitch uses a lighting system from Stadium Grow Lighting to ensure the grass can grow at any time of year. The device controls various aspects of the pitch, including exposure to light, temperature, water, and air, to make the grass able to grow in any conditions.

To the North East of the stadium stands the Black Cat House, a separate building which was the location of the Box office and club administrative offices, but became the SAFC club merchandise store in 2024, with the ticket office transferring to a unit in the West Stand. There is a large car park behind the West Stand and two car parks behind the East Stand, but match-day parking is permit only. Fragments of the iconic Archibald Leitch latticework, taken from the Main Stand at Roker Park, is used to separate parts of the Western Car Park. Wooden boards mimicking the Leitch lattice work were also added to the Roker End in 2019 as part of an initiative by the Red &amp; White Army supporters group to bring a sense of identity to renamed stand.

The perimeter walls of the stadium incorporate a &quot;Wall of Fame&quot; feature, where names can be engraved into the bricks of the walls. The interior of the stadium holds a banqueting suite, which can seat from 460 to 600 people. The stadium also contains several conferencing suites, that can be hired for events. Quinn&#x27;s Bar, housed in the West Stand, was named after former player and chairman Niall Quinn and includes memorabilia from the club&#x27;s history. Originally it was available for non-match-day visitors, but has since become exclusive for match-day hospitality and event packages.

In 2004,The &quot;Centre for Light&quot; was opened by the SAFC Foundation within the Stadium. The £1.6m learning facility, built over multiple floors, included five learning areas supporting up to 120 visiting children per day. In 2015, Sunderland became the first football club in the world to open a sensory room within the Stadium - thereby allowing people on the Autism spectrum to watch matches in a sound-proofed environment. It was named the &quot;Nathan Shippey Sensory Room&quot; after Nathan&#x27;s parents petitioned the club to set the room up. The sensory room provided a huge success, with the model being adopted at other clubs around the world. Sunderland opened their second sensory room in 2018.

In March 2018 it was announced that after the relegation to EFL League One, the Premier Concourse would be closed during the 2018–19 season, although it was temporarily reopened to accommodate a large crowd for the Boxing Day game against Bradford City and again on the final home league game against Portsmouth. After promotion back to EFL Championship, the Premier Concourse permanently reopened.

=== Seats ===
The stadium originally had mainly red seats, except for a Sunderland emblem and the words &quot;SUNDERLAND A.F.C&quot; in white lettering on the East Stand, and the slogan &quot;HA&#x27;WAY THE LADS&quot; (&quot;Ha&#x27;way&quot; is a Mackem dialect equivalent of the Geordie word &quot;Howay&quot;, meaning &quot;Come on&quot;) in white lettering on the North Stand. A thin band of white seats also circled the top of the East and South stand.

Over time, sections of red seats become bleached by the sun, turning them pink - which became a source of mockery from opposing fans. Sunderland fans petitioned the club to replace the seats, even noting on the inclusion of the faded pink seats in the digital replica of the Stadium of Light in the FIFA video game. In 2016, the club announced that a programme of seat changes would take place as part of a face-lift for the stadium&#x27;s 20th anniversary. Sections of the East Stand were replaced, but further work stalled.

When Stewart Donald purchased the club in the summer of 2018, frustration over the pink seats (and the general state of the stadium) came up frequently in his early engagements with fans. In June, Donald announced that he had purchased 31,500 seats and requested Sunderland fans to volunteer to help change them. The seat change took place in phases, with hundreds of volunteering fans joined occasionally by club officials and players. Phase I was the South East corner and was completed on 19 July 2018, Phase II was the North East corner and North Stand on was completed on 15 September 2018, and Phase III the South West corner completed in October 2018. The fourth and final phase, replacing 10,000 seats in the South and West stands, began on 29 October 2018. The corners were replaced with white seats, while the sides and ends were left red. The emblem and lettering remained. The club were nominated as a finalist in &#x27;Best Club Marketing Initiative&#x27; category at the 2018 Business Football Awards for the seat change activity.

== Fan Zone ==
A 6,000 capacity Fan Zone, modelled on similar schemes at Manchester City and those at NFL games in the United States, was approved by Sunderland City Council in July 2015. It followed a successful trial prior to a game against West Ham United in January 2013.

It was opened on the first home game of the 2015–16 season. The zone was located in the car park outside the East Stand and South East corner, and included live music, children&#x27;s activities (including a Five-a-side football pitch), food and drink kiosks and on-stage interviews with club legends. The Fan Zone opened three hours before kick-off and for a few hours after the game, and was accessible to ticket-holding spectators, including away fans. Due to the temporary structures in use, the Fan Zone was closed for safety reasons during periods of high winds. An enhanced version of the Fan Zone was opened for the England senior international game vs Australia in 2016.

The Fan Zone re-opened for the 2016–17 season opener against Middlesbrough, but as the season progressed, poor performance on the field and financial troubles off the field led to the Fan Zone being cancelled.

In a Q&amp;A with supporters association &#x27;Red &amp; White Army&#x27;, new club owner Stewart Donald committed to bring back the Fan Zone. It returned for the opening game of the 2018–19 season against Charlton Athletic, although smaller than the 2015 version, it was open to anyone - not just ticket-holding spectators. The Fan Zone no longer re-opens after a game.

== Stadium Village ==
A 30 hectare site area around the Stadium, including the Sheepfolds Industrial estate, was designated as the &#x27;Stadium Village&#x27; development zone by Sunderland City Council in 2007 - and a draft Supplementary planning document was released in 2009. The plan, adopted in 2010, described a framework for redeveloping the Stadium Village area into a mixture of commercial, residential and entertainment facilities with a focus on health and well-being. The plan was consistent with wider redevelopment plans across Sunderland, then under the umbrella of Sunderland Arc agency. In preparation for the redevelopment plans, the council began buying up plots in the area in 2008.

Initial redevelopment work focused on the Northern end of the site, adjacent to the stadium&#x27;s North Stand and the Black Cat House ticket office. The buildings in this area have &quot;Stadium Park&quot; as their address. The Sunderland Aquatic Centre, including an Olympic-sized swimming pool and fitness centre, opened in April 2008. In December 2014 construction work began on a new 141-room Hilton Garden Inn which opened on 28 April 2016. The Beacon of Light, a sports, education and community centre, opened in the summer of 2018 alongside the Aquatic Centre.

In 2009, during a review of the Stadium Village plans, city councilors expressed ambitions to build an Indoor skiing facility on the site and an expression of interest was issued to potential developers.

In the spring of 2011, the Sunderland Arc redevelopment agency was shut down, after its funding was pulled due to austerity cuts. This put the long-term future of the Stadium Village plan in doubt. However the council partnered with IDPartnership Group to push ahead with the plan, and in September 2017, a &#x27;masterplan&#x27; for Phase II of the Stadium Village area was approved by Sunderland council and released for public consultation. The Phase II area covers an area to the South and East of the stadium and proposals included facilities such as a Velodrome, an Ice rink, a Conference centre and a Climbing wall.

A key part of the new masterplan is &quot;Stadium Way&quot;, a proposed tree-lined boulevard linking the St Peter&#x27;s Metro station with a proposed Plaza at the South East corner of the stadium. The plaza would incorporate an enhanced Fan Zone, and is modelled on a similar space being developed as part of the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in London.

==International matches==
As well as holding Sunderland games, the stadium has also hosted England matches. The stadium was one of several venues used as temporary home grounds for the England team while the redevelopment of Wembley Stadium took place. It hosted its first England game in 1999, when they played Belgium in a friendly match, which England won 2–1. It played host to its first competitive England match on 2 April 2003, when they played Turkey in a Euro 2004 qualifying match, which England won 2–0. The Stadium of Light also held an England under 20 match against Italy on 27 November 2002, Italy beat England 5–3. On 10 June 2003 it hosted an England&#x27;s under-21s 2004 U21 European Championship qualifier match against Slovakia&#x27;s under-21s. The hosts beat the visitors 2–0 through Peter Doležaj&#x27;s fortieth minute own goal and Phil Jagielka&#x27;s eighty third-minute goal with 11,223 in attendance.

On 4 March 2016 it was announced that the Stadium of Light would host England for a friendly against Australia on 27 May 2016 as part of their preparations for Euro 2016. The sold-out match finished in a 2–1 victory for England, with goals from Marcus Rashford (on his international debut), Wayne Rooney and an own goal from Eric Dier.

On 30 September 2021, it was announced that the Stadium would host its first women&#x27;s football international; an England 2023 World Cup qualifier against Austria on 27 November 2021.

==Other uses==

=== Other Football ===
The Stadium of Light has hosted the final of the Durham Challenge Cup three times; in 2008, 2019. and 2023. It was due to host the 2020 final, but this was cancelled due to COVID-19. The Stadium of Light has also played host to finals for youth football, including the U14 Premier League Cup Final in 2014.

=== Rugby union === 
In August 2023, the stadium was confirmed as one of eight host venues for the women&#x27;s 2025 Women&#x27;s Rugby World Cup. In December 2023, it was confirmed that the stadium would host the tournament&#x27;s opening game.
=== Concerts ===


=== Sunderland University ===
The Stadium of Light currently hosts the annual graduation ceremony for the students of the University of Sunderland. The stadium won the RSVP magazine&#x27;s &quot;Most creative use of a sporting venue&quot; award in 2007 for its usage as the university&#x27;s graduation site.

==Records==
=== Attendances ===
The highest football attendance at the Stadium of Light is 48,353 set on 13 April 2002 for a Premier League game between Sunderland and Liverpool. The Stadium attendance record for non-football is 60,000 on 3 June 2022 for an Ed Sheeran concert.

The lowest league attendance at the stadium was 22,167 against Wigan Athletic on 2 December 2003. The lowest recorded attendance for a first-team competitive game at the Stadium of Light was 3,498 vs Oldham Athletic in the EFL Trophy Second Round on 1 December 2021. A dead rubber game vs. Bradford City in the same tournament on 9 November 2021 did not have an officially recorded attendance.

The highest seasonal average at the stadium since it was opened was 46,790 in the 2000–01 season while Sunderland were playing in the Premier League. The lowest average attendance at the Stadium of Light was 27,119 in the 2003–04 season in Division One. The highest total seasonal attendance was recorded during the 1998–99 season when the aggregate was 890,660 in a season where Sunderland were First Division champions, and League Cup semi-finalists. The lowest seasonal aggregate at the Stadium of Light was 572,241 in the 2019–20 season, as Sunderland played only 19 of a planned 23 games due to the season&#x27;s curtailment because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The following season saw all games played behind closed doors due to the pandemic.

In the 2018-19 season, Sunderland averaged a home league crowd of 32,156, setting a new record for the third tier, while the Boxing Day game against Bradford City attracted 46,039, both a League One record, and the highest attended league game outside of the Premier League that season.

On , Sunderland A.F.C. Women and Newcastle United W.F.C. set a new attendance record of 15,387 for the Women&#x27;s Championship in their first meeting in the league, a Wear–Tyne derby match played at the stadium. The previous record had been an attendance of 11,137, set in 2022.

=== Results ===
Sunderland&#x27;s largest margin of victory at the stadium was a 7–0 win over Oxford United in Division 1 during the 1998–99 promotion season.

Sunderland&#x27;s biggest defeat at the Stadium of Light was 5–0 in a preseason friendly (marking the 20th anniversary of the stadium) against Celtic on 29 July 2017. Sunderland&#x27;s biggest league defeat at the Stadium of Light is 4–0 which has happened on five occasions: vs. Arsenal (11 May 2003), vs. Manchester United (26 December 2007), vs. Aston Villa (14 March 2015), vs. Southampton (11 February 2017) and vs. Middlesbrough (7 October 2023).

The highest scoring matches at the Stadium of Light with nine goals are a 6–3 Sunderland victory over Exeter City in Round 2 of the EFL Cup on 25 August 2015, and a 5–4 Sunderland defeat to Coventry City in League One on 13 April 2019.

==Transport==

Sunderland railway station is connected to London King&#x27;s Cross by main line services run by London North Eastern Railway connecting via Newcastle or Darlington and by occasional direct services run by the Open Access operator Grand Central. The station is near the stadium. The St Peter&#x27;s and Stadium of Light Metro stations were built as part of the Sunderland extension. Both are quite near the stadium, though ironically St. Peter&#x27;s is nearer to the stadium than the Stadium of Light station. The Metro was extended into Sunderland in 2002. A park and ride system is available on match days to allow spectators to park away from the stadium, and a new footbridge has been proposed to link the stadium to the south bank of the river as part of the stadium park regeneration project.

He then moved to Los Angeles to work as an actor and writer and performed comedy routines. Levinson at one time shared an apartment with would-be drug smuggler (and subject of the movie &quot;Blow&quot;) George Jung.

==Career==
Levinson&#x27;s first writing work was for television variety shows such as &quot;The Marty Feldman Comedy Machine&quot;, &quot;The Lohman and Barkley Show&quot;, &quot;The Tim Conway Show&quot;, and &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot;. He moved on to success as a film screenwriter – notably the Mel Brooks comedies &quot;Silent Movie&quot; (1976) and &quot;High Anxiety&quot; (1977) (in which he played a bellboy) and the Oscar-nominated script (co-written by then-wife Valerie Curtin) for &quot;...And Justice for All&quot; (1979). He was an uncredited co-writer on Dustin Hoffman&#x27;s 1982 hit comedy &quot;Tootsie.&quot; 

Levinson began his career as a film director with &quot;Diner&quot; (1982), for which he also wrote the script, earned him an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay. &quot;Diner&quot; was the first of four films set in the Baltimore of Levinson&#x27;s youth. The other three were &quot;Tin Men&quot; (1987), a story of aluminum-siding salesmen in the 1960s starring Richard Dreyfuss and Danny DeVito; the immigrant family saga &quot;Avalon&quot; (1990) featuring Elijah Wood in one of his earliest screen appearances; and &quot;Liberty Heights&quot; (1999). 

His biggest hit, both critically and financially, was &quot;Rain Man&quot; (1988), a sibling drama starring Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise in which Levinson appeared as a doctor in a cameo appearance. The film won four Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director. It also won the Golden Bear at the 39th Berlin International Film Festival.

Levinson directed the popular period baseball drama &quot;The Natural&quot; (1984), starring Robert Redford. Redford later directed &quot;Quiz Show&quot; (1994), and he cast Levinson as television personality Dave Garroway. Levinson also directed the classic war comedy &quot;Good Morning, Vietnam&quot; (1987), starring Robin Williams (as Adrian Cronauer), and he later collaborated with Williams on the fantasy film &quot;Toys&quot; (1992) and the political comedy &quot;Man of the Year&quot; (2006). Levinson also directed the critically acclaimed historical crime drama &quot;Bugsy&quot; (1991), which starred Warren Beatty and which was nominated for ten Academy Awards. 

He directed Dustin Hoffman again in &quot;Wag the Dog&quot; (1997), a political satire co-starring Robert De Niro about a Presidential election swayed by a phony war staged on a film studio. The film won the Silver Bear – Special Jury Prize at the 48th Berlin International Film Festival.

Levinson partnered with producer Mark Johnson to form the film production company Baltimore Pictures, with 1990&#x27;s &quot;Avalon&quot; as the company&#x27;s first production. Johnson departed the firm in 1994. Levinson has been a producer or executive producer for such major productions as &quot;The Perfect Storm&quot; (2000), directed by Wolfgang Petersen; &quot;Analyze That&quot; (2002), starring De Niro as a neurotic mob boss and Billy Crystal as his therapist; and &quot;Possession&quot; (2002), based on the best-selling novel by A. S. Byatt.

Levinson has a television production company with Tom Fontana (The Levinson/Fontana Company) and has served as executive producer for a number of series, including &quot;&quot; (which ran on NBC from 1993 to 1999) and the HBO prison drama &quot;Oz&quot;. Levinson also played an uncredited main role as a judge in the short-lived TV series &quot;The Jury&quot;.

Levinson published his first novel, &quot;Sixty-Six&quot; (), in 2003, and like several of his films, it is semi-autobiographical and set in Baltimore in the 1960s. In 2004, he directed two webisodes of the American Express ads &quot;The Adventures of Seinfeld &amp; Superman.&quot; In 2004, he was also the recipient of the Austin Film Festival&#x27;s Distinguished Screenwriter Award. Levinson directed a documentary &quot;PoliWood&quot; about the 2008 Democratic and Republican National Conventions: the documentary—produced by Tim Daly, Robin Bronk and Robert E. Baruc—had its premiere at the 2009 Tribeca Film Festival.

In 2011 Levinson was developing a film based on Whitey Bulger, the Boston crime boss. The resulting film, &quot;Black Mass&quot; (script by Jim Sheridan, Jez Butterworth, and Russell Gewirtz), is based on the book by Dick Lehr and Gerard O&#x27;Neill, and it is said to be the &quot;true story of Billy Bulger, Whitey Bulger, FBI agent John Connelly and the FBI&#x27;s witness protection program created by J. Edgar Hoover.&quot; Levinson later left the project.

Levinson finished production on &quot;The Humbling&quot; (2014), starring Al Pacino. Levinson also directed &quot;Rock the Kasbah&quot; (2015), starring Bill Murray.

In 2010, Levinson received the Laurel Award for Screenwriting Achievement, which is the lifetime achievement award from the Writers Guild of America.

In 2021, he co-executive produced the Hulu miniseries &quot;Dopesick&quot; and directed the first two episodes.

==Personal life==
Levinson married his writing collaborator Valerie Curtin in 1975. They divorced seven years later. He later married Dianna Rhodes, whom he met in Baltimore while filming &quot;Diner.&quot; He is the father of Sam, Jack, Michelle, and Patrick Levinson.
He is a minority owner of the Baltimore Orioles baseball team.

He resides with his two sons and wife in Redding, Connecticut.

<doc id="319000" wikidata="Q7754024" url="?curid=319000" title="The Nibblers">
<text>The Nibblers are fictional characters who have their own comic strip in the UK comic &quot;The Beano&quot;. Also known as &#x27;The Bash Street Mice&#x27;, The Nibblers were a community of mice who lived in a hole in the wall, and were always stealing food from Porky, the fat owner of the house. Porky and his cat Whiskers were repeatedly foiled in their attempts to catch The Nibblers, who nearly always had the last laugh. Like The Bash Street Kids, the Nibblers all had distinct personalities. Their names were:

*His Nibs – The chief nibbler.
*Cheddar George – Champion guzzler.
*Gordonzola – Half-Scottish, half-Italian.
*Enor Mouse – Strong, but er... daft.
*Chiseller – Our engineer.
*Sniffler – A nose for food and trouble.
*Scritch and Scratch – The terrible twins, similar to Snitch and Snatch in Lord Snooty.

The strip originally ran from 1970 to 1974. In 1977 it was revived, and continued in the comic until 1984. The initial run was drawn by Ron Spencer, and the second by John Sherwood.

In the Ratz strip in the Beano Annual 2009, Herman, one of the main characters, goes off to Hollywood. Keef and Rod look for a new Herman and the Nibblers audition for the vacancy.
They made a surprise reappearance in the 2012 annual, drawn by David Sutherland, along with a reprint in the weekly comic&#x27;s Retro Beano section in issue 3597, dated 6 August 2011. They also re-appeared in the weekly comic drawn by Hunt Emerson from 2014.</text><links>

<doc id="319009" wikidata="Q7738930" url="?curid=319009" title="The Harp in the South">
<text>The Harp in the South is the debut novel by New Zealand-born Australian author Ruth Park. Published in 1948, it portrays the life of a Catholic Irish Australian family living in the Sydney suburb of Surry Hills, which was at that time an inner city slum.

==Publication History==
&quot;The Harp in the South&quot; was published, initially, in the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; in twelve daily instalments, beginning on 4 January 1947, after winning a competition run by that newspaper. The prize was £2,000, and there were 175 entries.

It was controversial, with readers writing to the newspaper, on the basis of the synopsis, even before the serialisation started. Delia Falconer writes that &quot;The Herald&quot; published &quot;forty-three responses, a symposium, and a daily tally of pro and con letters (sixty-eight for; fifty-four against)&quot;. It was published in book form in 1948 by Angus &amp; Robertson, who baulked at the novel but &quot;had to honour a ‘gentleman’s agreement’ to publish the winner&quot;.

Nonetheless, it has become a classic and has never been out of print.

== Characters ==
Hughie Darcy:
Married to Margaret Darcy. Hughie often becomes drunk after work and his best friend is Patrick Diamond, even though Patrick is Protestant and he is Catholic. He is the father of Rowena and Dolour. Hughie wants to get out of Surry Hills and back to the bush but he has a family to support so is trapped.
Margaret “Mumma” Darcy:
Mother of Rowena and Dolour, mother-in-law of Charlie Rothe. She is a devout Catholic and although generally accepting, sometimes fights with Patrick Diamond (their lodger) over his religious beliefs.
Rowena &quot;Roie&quot; Darcy:
Married to Charlie Rothe, they have one child, Moira, known as “Motty”. In her youth, she was courted by Tommy Mendel, but after sleeping with her, he disappeared. Roie secretly works at two jobs to save enough for an abortion when she discovers she is expecting Tommy&#x27;s baby, but at the last minute cannot go through with it. On her way home, she is attacked and savagely beaten by a group of sailors and loses the baby.
Charlie Rothe:
Charlie is assumed to be part Aboriginal although he does not know his parents as he was taken away as a baby and put in a home. He is married to Rowena Darcy whom he met when her younger sister, Dolour took part in a radio quiz show, &quot;Junior Information Please&quot;. Roie was feeling sick and he helped her outside for air. Charlie knows there is no racial prejudice with Roie but Margaret does not accept him at first and Dolour is angry with him for stealing Roie from her.
Dolour Darcy:
Dolour is the youngest in her family. A very bright girl, she aspires to get a good education and escape from Surry Hills. She is aunty to &quot;Motty&quot; Roie&#x27;s child and good friends with elderly Chinese greengrocer, Lick Jimmy.
Patrick Diamond:
The Darcy’s fervent Protestant lodger. Every St. Patrick&#x27;s day, he gets drunk and verbally abuses Mrs. Darcy. When he suffers a stroke, Lick Jimmy performs an emergency &#x27;bleed&#x27; by cutting open a vein to ease the pressure. Pat was unaware of this, as he had passed out because Hughie, also drunk, had hit him.
Miss Sheily:
Mother to disabled Johnny Sheily, she constantly abuses him. When he is knocked down and killed she seems relieved rather than upset. Later, Roie sees her flagellating herself and crying Johnny&#x27;s name. She marries a Swedish man named Gunnarson.

<text>Rosina Ruth Lucia Park AM (24 August 191714 December 2010) was a New Zealand–born Australian author. Her best known works are the novels &quot;The Harp in the South&quot; (1948) and &quot;Playing Beatie Bow&quot; (1980), and the children&#x27;s radio serial &quot;The Muddle-Headed Wombat&quot; (1951–1970), which also spawned a book series (1962–1982).

==Personal history==
Park was born in Auckland to a New Zealand father whose father was Scottish and mother Irish and a New Zealand mother whose father was Swedish and mother was Irish. Her family later moved to the town of Te Kūiti further south in the North Island of New Zealand, where they lived in isolated areas.

During the Great Depression her working-class father laboured on bush roads and bridges, worked as a driver, did government relief work and became a sawmill hand. Finally, he shifted back to Auckland, where he joined the workforce of a municipal council. The family occupied public housing, known in New Zealand as a state house, and money remained a scarce commodity. Ruth Park, after attending St Benedict&#x27;s School, a Catholic primary school, won a partial scholarship to St Benedict&#x27;s secondary school, but her high-school education was broken by periods of being unable to afford to attend. Nevertheless, she completed her studies at St Benedict&#x27;s as Head Girl. She completed an external degree course at Auckland University.

Park&#x27;s first break as a professional writer came when she was hired by the &quot;Auckland Star&quot; newspaper as a journalist, but she found the assignments she was given unchallenging. Wishing to expand her horizons, she accepted a job offer from the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot;, but the tightening of United States&#x27; entry requirements after the bombing of Pearl Harbor forced a change of plan. Instead, she moved to Sydney, Australia, in 1942, where she had lined up a job with another newspaper.

That same year she married the budding Australian author D&#x27;Arcy Niland (1917–1967), with whom she had been corresponding as pen pals for some years, and whom she had finally met on a previous visit to Sydney. There she embarked on a career as a freelance writer. Park and Niland had five children, of whom the youngest, twin daughters Kilmeny and Deborah, went on to become book illustrators. (Park was devastated when Niland died in Sydney at the age of 49 from a heart ailment; Kilmeny also predeceased her — see the &quot;Herald&quot; obituary.) Park had eleven grandchildren and five great-grandchildren. The writer Rafe Champion is her son-in-law. In addition, D’Arcy Niland&#x27;s brother Beresford married Ruth Park&#x27;s sister Jocelyn.

==Writing career==
When contracted in 1942 by Ida Elizabeth Osbourne to write a serial for the ABC Children&#x27;s Session, she wrote the series &quot;The Wide-awake Bunyip&quot;. When the lead actor Albert Collins died suddenly in 1951, she changed its direction and &quot;The Muddle-Headed Wombat&quot; was born, with first Leonard Teale then John Ewart in the title role. The series ended when the radio program folded in 1970. Such was its popularity that between 1962 and 1982 she wrote a series of children&#x27;s books about the character.

Her first novel was &quot;The Harp in the South&quot; (1948) – a graphic story of Irish slum life in Sydney, which has been translated into 37 languages. Even though it was acclaimed by literary critics, the book proved controversial with sections of the public due to its candour, with some newspaper letter-writers calling it a cruel fantasy because as far as they were concerned, there were no slums in Sydney. However, the newly married Park and Niland did live for a time in a Sydney slum located in the rough inner-city suburb of Surry Hills and vouched for the novel&#x27;s accuracy. It has never been out of print. Sydney slum life recurs in her novel for children, &quot;Playing Beatie Bow&quot; (1980).

Park built on her initial success with the 1949 publication of a follow-up novel titled the &quot;Poor Man&#x27;s Orange&quot;. During the 1950s, despite the demands of raising a family, she wrote tirelessly. According to a 2010 tribute article printed in the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; and written by her literary agent Tim Curnow, she produced more than 5,000 radio scripts alone during this decade, as well as contributing numerous articles to newspapers and magazines and penning weightier works of fiction.

She subsequently wrote &quot;Missus&quot; (1985), a prequel to &quot;The Harp in the South&quot;, among other novels, and created scripts for film and television. Her autobiographies, &quot;A Fence Around the Cuckoo&quot; (1992) and &quot;Fishing in the Styx&quot; (1993), deal with her life in New Zealand and Australia respectively. She also penned a novel set in New Zealand, &quot;One-a-pecker, Two-a-pecker&quot; (1957), about gold mining in Otago. (It was later renamed &quot;The Frost and The Fire&quot;.)
Park never remarried. Between 1946 and 2004, she received numerous awards for her contributions to literature in both Australia and internationally. She was made a Member of the Order of Australia in 1987. (Her awards and honours are listed below.)

From 1974 to 1981 Park dwelt on Norfolk Island, where she was the co-owner of a shop selling books and gifts. Her later years, however, were spent living in the Sydney harbourside suburb of Mosman. She died in her sleep on 14 December 2010, at the age of 93.

<text>Te Kūiti is a town in the north of the King Country region of the North Island of New Zealand. It lies at the junction of State Highways 3 and 30 and on the North Island Main Trunk railway, south of Hamilton. The town promotes itself as the sheep shearing capital of the world and is host to the annual New Zealand National Shearing Championships.

Te Kūiti is approximately 80 km south of Hamilton and 19 km south-east of Waitomo. The area around Te Kūiti, commonly known as the &quot;King Country&quot;, gives its name to the Heartland Championship rugby team based in Te Kūiti.

==History and culture==

Te Kūiti is the Māori name given to the area. In its original form of &quot;Te Kūititanga&quot;, it literally means &quot;the valley&quot;, &quot;the squeezing in&quot; or &quot;the narrowing&quot;.

Several marae are located in and around Te Kūiti, associated with Ngāti Maniapoto hapū:
* Te Kumi Marae and Te Korapatu meeting house are affiliated with Ngāti Peehi and Rōrā
* Mōtītī Marae and Ko te Hungaiti or Hapainga meeting house are affiliated with Ngāti Kinohaku, Ngāti Putaitemuri and Ngāti Tauhunu
* Te Piruru Papakainga Marae and Te Pukenui o Taonui meeting house are affiliated with Ngāti Rōrā
* Tāne Hopuwai Marae and Tāne Hopuwai meeting house are affiliated with Ngāti Apakura
* Te Tokanganui a Noho Marae and meeting house are affiliated with Ngāti Rōrā. This wharenui was constructed in 1873 for Te Kooti and his followers, and was one of the largest wharenui ever built at the time.
* Tomotuki Marae and Parekatini meeting house are affiliated with Apakura, Parekaitini and Ngāti Rōrā
* Te Waipatoto Marae, and Waipatoto and Waipatoto Tuarua meeting houses, are affiliated with Ngāti Kinohaku

==Geography==

Limestone deposits and water have created the Waitomo Caves, northwest of the town, one of New Zealand&#x27;s most-visited tourist locations. The town itself is located in a valley with many rich limestone deposits. The Manga-o-Kewa Stream runs through the valley and is a tributary of the Waipā River.
Te Kūiti&#x27;s hinterland consist mainly of farmland and limestone quarries. The land surrounding Te Kūiti has steep hilly relief which reflects the nature of the North King Country region.
The climate of Te Kūiti is wet during the winter and dry during the late summer with an average of 1,450mm of rainfall each year.

He was given sanctuary by the chiefs of Maniapoto against the white colonial Government of New Zealand and under Maniapoto&#x27;s protection carved one of the most famous and important late 19th century spiritual houses in the North Island. This house is central to Te Kūiti&#x27;s historical foundation, also referred to as the epicentre of the Rohe Pōtae or &quot;King Country&quot;. In 1881 the last frontier was opened to colonial settlers.

The Tatsuno Japanese Garden is at the southern end of the main street.

The Mangaokewa reserve located 5 km south of Te Kūiti is a popular attraction for rock climbers, hikers, picnic goers, swimmers and trout fisherman in the region.

A &#x27;Revitalisation Project&#x27; for the NZHPT Category II listed Te Kuiti railway station was started in 2014 to provide for arts and crafts groups, an education centre, youth projects, historical displays and a meeting room. The Rail Heritage Trust describes the station as, &quot;the finest remaining example of a standard class B station&quot;.

==Sport==

Te Kūiti is the home of the Waitete Rugby Football Club and the King Country Rugby Union, both of whom are based at Rugby Park. The famous Colin Meads spent the entirety of his career with both Waitete and King Country. The town also has an association football club, Te Kuiti Albion Football Club, who play in the Deacon Shield tournament. They play their home games at Centennial Park where there is a small clubroom. The club colours are yellow and black striped shirts and black shorts.

<text>The bystander effect, or bystander apathy, is a social psychological theory that states that individuals are less likely to offer help to a victim in the presence of other people. The theory was first proposed in 1964 after the murder of Kitty Genovese, in which a newspaper had reported (albeit erroneously) that 38 bystanders saw or heard the attack without coming to her assistance or calling the police. Much research, mostly in psychology research laboratories, has focused on increasingly varied factors, such as the number of bystanders, ambiguity, group cohesiveness, and diffusion of responsibility that reinforces mutual denial. If a single individual is asked to complete a task alone, the sense of responsibility will be strong, and there will be a positive response; however, if a group is required to complete a task together, each individual in the group will have a weak sense of responsibility, and will often shrink back in the face of difficulties or responsibilities.

Recent research has focused on &quot;real world&quot; events captured on security cameras, and the coherency and robustness of the effect has come under question. More recent studies also show that this effect can generalize to workplace settings, where subordinates often refrain from informing managers regarding ideas, concerns, and opinions.

==Social psychology research==

The bystander effect was first demonstrated and popularized in the laboratory by social psychologists John M. Darley and Bibb Latané in 1968 after they became interested in the topic following the murder of Kitty Genovese in 1964. These researchers launched a series of experiments that resulted in one of the strongest and most replicable effects in social psychology. In a typical experiment, the participant is either alone or among a group of other participants or confederates. An emergency situation is staged and researchers measure how long it takes the participants to intervene, if they intervene. These experiments have found that the presence of others inhibits helping, often by a large margin. For example, Bibb Latané and Judith Rodin (1969) staged an experiment around a woman in distress, where subjects were either alone, with a friend, or with a stranger. 70 percent of the people alone called out or went to help the woman after they believed she had fallen and was hurt, but when paired with a stranger only 40 percent offered help.

Philpot et al. (2019) examined over 200 sets of real-life surveillance video recordings from the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and South Africa to answer &quot;the most pressing question for actual public victims&quot;: whether help would be forthcoming at all. They found that intervention was the norm, and in over 90% of conflicts one or more bystanders intervened to provide help. Increased bystander presence &quot;increased&quot; the likelihood that someone would intervene.

===Variables affecting bystanders===

====Emergency versus non-emergency situations====
Latané and Darley performed three experiments to test bystander behavior in non-emergency situations. Their results indicated that the way in which the subjects were asked for help mattered. In one condition, subjects asked a bystander for his or her name. More people provided an answer when the students gave their name first. In another condition, the students asked bystanders for a dime. When the student gave an explanation, such as saying that their wallet had been stolen, the percentage of people giving assistance was higher (72%) than when the student just asked for a dime (34%). Additional research by Faul, Mark, et al., using data collected by EMS officials when responding to an emergency, indicated that the response of bystanders was correlated with the health severity of the situation.

According to Latané and Darley, there are five characteristics of emergencies that affect bystanders:
# Emergencies involve threat of harm or actual harm
# Emergencies are unusual and rare
# The type of action required in an emergency differs from situation to situation
# Emergencies cannot be predicted or expected
# Emergencies require immediate action

Due to these five characteristics, bystanders go through cognitive and behavioural processes:
# &quot;Notice&quot; that something is going on
# &quot;Interpret&quot; the situation as being an emergency
# &quot;Degree of responsibility&quot; felt
# &quot;Form of assistance&quot;
# &quot;Implement the action choice&quot;

&quot;Notice&quot;:
To test the concept of &quot;noticing&quot;, Latane and Darley (1968) staged an emergency using Columbia University students. The students were placed in a room—either alone, with two strangers or with three strangers to complete a questionnaire while they waited for the experimenter to return. While they were completing the questionnaire, smoke was pumped into the room through a wall vent to simulate an emergency. When students were working alone they noticed the smoke almost immediately (within 5 seconds). However, students that were working in groups took longer (up to 20 seconds) to notice the smoke. Latané and Darley claimed this phenomenon could be explained by the social norm of what is considered polite etiquette in public. In most western cultures, politeness dictates that it is inappropriate to idly look around. This may indicate that a person is nosy or rude. As a result, passers-by are more likely to be keeping their attention to themselves when around large groups than when alone. People who are alone are more likely to be conscious of their surroundings and therefore more likely to notice a person in need of assistance.

&quot;Interpret&quot;:
Once a situation has been noticed, a bystander may be encouraged to intervene if they interpret the incident as an emergency. According to the principle of social influence, bystanders monitor the reactions of other people in an emergency situation to see if others think that it is necessary to intervene. If it is determined that others are not reacting to the situation, bystanders will interpret the situation as not an emergency and will not intervene. This is an example of pluralistic ignorance or social proof. Referring to the smoke experiment, even though students in the groups had clearly noticed the smoke which had become so thick that it was obscuring their vision, irritating their eyes or causing them to cough, they were still unlikely to report it. Only one participant in the group condition reported the smoke within the first four minutes, and by the end of the experiment, no-one from five of eight groups had reported the smoke at all. In the groups that did not report the smoke, the interpretations of its cause, and the likelihood that it was genuinely threatening was also less serious, with no-one suggesting fire as a possible cause, but some preferring less serious explanations, such as the air-conditioner was leaking.
Similarly, interpretations of the context played an important role in people&#x27;s reactions to a man and woman fighting in the street. When the woman yelled, &quot;Get away from me; I don&#x27;t know you,&quot; bystanders intervened 65 percent of the time, but only 19 percent of the time when the woman yelled, &quot;Get away from me; I don&#x27;t know why I ever married you.&quot;

General bystander effect research was mainly conducted in the context of non-dangerous, non-violent emergencies. A study (2006) tested bystander effect in emergency situations to see if they would get the same results from other studies testing non-emergencies. In situations with low potential danger, significantly more help was given when the person was alone than when they were around another person. However, in situations with high potential danger, participants confronted with an emergency alone or in the presence of another person were similarly likely to help the victim. This suggests that in situations of greater seriousness, it is more likely that people will interpret the situation as one in which help is needed and will be more likely to intervene.

&quot;Degree of responsibility&quot;:
Darley and Latané determined that the degree of responsibility a bystander feels is dependent on three things:
# Whether or not they feel the person is deserving of help
# The competence of the bystander
# The relationship between the bystander and the victim

&quot;Forms of assistance&quot;:
There are two categories of assistance as defined by Latané and Darley:
# Direct intervention: directly assisting the victim
# &quot;Detour&quot; intervention. Detour intervention refers to reporting an emergency to the authorities (i.e. the police, fire department)

&quot;Implementation&quot;:
After going through steps 1–4, the bystander must implement the action of choice.

In one study done by Abraham S. Ross, the effects of increased responsibility on bystander intervention were studied by increasing the presence of children. This study was based on the reaction of 36 male undergraduates presented with emergency situations. The prediction was that the intervention would be at its peak due to presence of children around those 36 male undergraduate participants. This was experimented and showed that the prediction was not supported, and was concluded as &quot;the type of study did not result in significant differences in intervention.&quot;

A meta-analysis (2011) of the bystander effect reported that &quot;The bystander effect was attenuated when situations were perceived as dangerous (compared with non-dangerous), perpetrators were present (compared with non-present), and the costs of intervention were physical (compared with non-physical). This pattern of findings is consistent with the arousal-cost-reward model, which proposes that dangerous emergencies are recognized faster and more clearly as real emergencies, thereby inducing higher levels of arousal and hence more helping.&quot; They also &quot;identified situations where bystanders provide welcome physical support for the potentially intervening individual and thus reduce the bystander effect, such as when the bystanders were exclusively male, when they were naive rather than passive confederates or only virtually present persons, and when the bystanders were not strangers.&quot;

An alternative explanation has been proposed by Stanley Milgram, who hypothesized that the bystanders&#x27; callous behavior was caused by the strategies they had adopted in daily life to cope with information overload. This idea has been supported to varying degrees by empirical research.

Timothy Hart and Ternace Miethe used data from the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) and found that a bystander was present in 65 percent of the violent victimizations in the data. Their presence was most common in cases of physical assaults (68%), which accounted for the majority of these violent victimizations and less likely in robberies (49%) and sexual assaults (28%). The actions of bystanders were most frequently judged by victims as &quot;neither helping nor hurting&quot; (48%), followed by &quot;helping&quot; (37%), &quot;hurting&quot; (10%), and &quot;both helping and hurting&quot; (3%). Half of the attacks in which a bystander was present occurred in the evening, where the victim and bystander were strangers.

====Ambiguity and consequences====
Ambiguity is one factor that affects whether or not a person assists another in need. In some cases of high ambiguity, it can take a person or group up to five times as long before taking action than in cases of low ambiguity. In these cases, bystanders determine their own safety before proceeding. Bystanders are more likely to intervene in low ambiguity, insignificant consequence situations than in high ambiguity, significant consequence situations.

Latané and Rodin (1969) suggested that in ambiguous situations, bystanders may look to one another for guidance, and misinterpret others&#x27; lack of initial response as a lack of concern. This causes each bystander to decide that the situation is not serious.

====Understanding of environment====
Whether or not a bystander intervenes may have to do with their familiarity of the environment where the emergency occurs. If the bystander is familiar with the environment, they are more likely to know where to get help, where the exits are, etc. Bystanders who are in an environment in which they are not familiar with the surroundings are less likely to give help in an emergency situation.

====Priming the bystander effect====
Research done by Garcia et al. (2002) indicate that priming a social context may inhibit helping behavior. Imagining being around one other person or being around a group of people can affect a person&#x27;s willingness to help.

====Cohesiveness and group membership====

Group cohesiveness is another variable that can affect the helping behaviour of a bystander. As defined by Rutkowski et al., cohesiveness refers to an established relationship (friends, acquaintances) between two or more people. Experiments have been done to test the performance of bystanders when they are in groups with people they have been acquainted with. According to Rutkowski et al., the social responsibility norm affects helping behavior. The norm of social responsibility states that &quot;people should help others who are in need of help and who are dependent on them for it.&quot; As suggested by the research, the more cohesive a group, the more likely the group will act in accordance to the social responsibility norm. To test this hypothesis, researchers used undergraduate students and divided them into four groups: a low cohesive group with two people, a low cohesive group with four people, a high cohesive group with two people, and a high cohesive group with four people. Students in the high cohesive group were then acquainted with each other by introducing themselves and discussing what they liked/disliked about school and other similar topics. The point of the experiment was to determine whether or not high cohesive groups were more willing to help a hurt &quot;victim&quot; than the low cohesive groups. The four member high cohesive groups were the quickest and most likely groups to respond to the victim who they believed to be hurt. The four member low cohesive groups were the slowest and least likely to respond to the victim.

Altruism research suggests that helping behaviour is more likely when there are similarities between the helper and the person being helped. Recent research has considered the role of similarity, and more specifically, shared group membership, in encouraging bystander intervention. In one experiment (2005), researchers found that bystanders were more likely to help an injured person if that person was wearing a football jersey of a team the bystander liked as opposed to a team the bystander did not like. However, when their shared identity as football fans was made salient, supporters of both teams were likely to be helped, significantly more so than a person wearing a plain shirt.

The findings of Mark Levine and Simon Crowther (2008) illustrated that increasing group size inhibited intervention in a street violence scenario when bystanders were strangers, but encouraged intervention when bystanders were friends. They also found that when gender identity is salient, group size encouraged intervention when bystanders and victims shared social category membership. In addition, group size interacted with context-specific norms that both inhibit and encourage helping. The bystander effect is not a generic consequence of increasing group size. When bystanders share group-level psychological relationships, group size can encourage as well as inhibit helping.

These findings can be explained in terms of self-categorization and empathy. From the perspective of self-categorization theory, a person&#x27;s own social identity, well-being is tied to their group membership so that when a group based identity is salient, the suffering of one group member can be considered to directly affect the group. Because of this shared identity, referred to as &quot;self-other merging,&quot; bystanders are able to empathize, which has been found to predict helping behaviour. For example, in a study relating to helping after eviction both social identification and empathy were found to predict helping. However, when social identification was controlled for, empathy no longer predicted helping behaviour.

====Cultural differences====
In discussing the case of Wang Yue and a later incident in China, in which CCTV footage from a Shanghai subway showed passengers fleeing from a foreigner who fainted, UCLA anthropologist Yunxiang Yan said that the reactions can be explained not only by previous reports of scamming from older people for helping, but also by historical cultural differences in Chinese agrarian society, in which there was a stark contrast between how individuals associated with ingroup and outgroup members, saying, &quot;How to treat strangers nicely is one of the biggest challenges in contemporary Chinese society...The prevailing ethical system in traditional China is based on close-knit community ties, kinship ties.&quot; He continued, &quot;A person might treat other people in the person&#x27;s social group very, very nicely... But turn around, when facing to a stranger, and (a person might) tend to be very suspicious. And whenever possible, might take advantage of that stranger.&quot; In spite of this, Yan thought Chinese society was moving to a more positive direction, with the younger generation having more inclusive values as a result of growing up in a more globalized society.

In India, the phenomena of bystanders failing to help after witnessing violent incidents have also been partly attributed to culture. Indian sociologist Ashis Nandy contended it was due to the &quot;increasing brutalisation of our society&quot; which resulted from &quot;rapid cultural change and the change in education standards&quot;. According to psychologist Devika Kapoor, the bystander effect in India &quot;seems more pronounced because of our cultural conditioning. We&#x27;re often told to mind our own business as young kids and not ask questions. This then carries into our adult lives too, where we choose to isolate ourselves from situations that don&#x27;t concern us.&quot;

====Diffusion of responsibility====

Darley and Latané (1968) conducted research on diffusion of responsibility. The findings suggest that in the case of an emergency, when people believe that there are other people around, they are less likely or slower to help a victim because they believe someone else will take responsibility. People may also fail to take responsibility for a situation depending on the context. They may assume that other bystanders are more qualified to help, such as doctors or police officers, and that their intervention would be unneeded. They may also be afraid of being superseded by a superior helper, offering unwanted assistance, or facing the legal consequences of offering inferior and possibly dangerous assistance. For this reason, some legislations, such as &quot;Good Samaritan Laws&quot; limit liability for those attempting to provide medical services and non-medical services in an emergency.

A 2009 study published by International Ombudsman Association in the &quot;Journal of the International Ombudsman Association&quot; suggests that—in reality—there are dozens of reasons why people do not act on the spot or come forward in the workplace when they see behavior they consider unacceptable. The most important reasons cited for not acting were: the fear of loss of important relationships in and out of the workplace, and a fear of &quot;bad consequences&quot;. There also were many reasons given by people who did act on the spot or come forward to authorities.

This practitioners&#x27; study suggests that the &quot;bystander effect&quot; can be studied and analyzed in a much broader fashion. The broader view includes not just a) what bystanders do in singular emergencies, b) helping strangers in need, when c) there are (or are not) other people around. The reactions of bystanders can also be analyzed a) when the bystanders perceive any of a wide variety of unacceptable behavior over time, b) they are within an organizational context, and c) with people whom they know. The practitioners&#x27; study reported many reasons why some bystanders within organizations do not act or report unacceptable behavior. The study also suggests that bystander behavior is, in fact, often helpful, in terms of &quot;acting on the spot to help&quot; and &quot;reporting&quot; unacceptable behavior (and emergencies and people in need.) The ombuds practitioners&#x27; study suggests that what bystanders will do in real situations is actually very complex, reflecting views of the context and their managers (and relevant organizational structures if any) and also many personal reasons.

In support of the idea that some bystanders do indeed act responsibly, Gerald Koocher and Patricia Keith Spiegel wrote a 2010 article related to an NIH-funded study which showed that informal intervention by peers and bystanders can interrupt or remedy unacceptable scientific behavior.

===&quot;What Would You Do?&quot;===
John Quiñones&#x27; primetime show, &quot;Primetime: What Would You Do?&quot; on ABC, tests the bystander effect. Actors are used to act out (typically non-emergency) situations while the cameras capture the reactions and actions of innocent bystanders. Topics include cheating on a millionaire test, an elderly person shoplifting, racism and homophobia.

===Non-computer versus computers: computer mediated intervention===
Research suggests that the bystander effect may be present in computer-mediated communication situations. Evidence demonstrates that people can be bystanders even when they cannot see the person in distress. In the experiment, 400 online chat groups were observed. One of two confederates were used as victims in each chat room: either a male victim whose screen name was Jake Harmen or a female victim whose screen name was Suzy Harmen. The purpose of the experiment was to determine whether or not the gender of the victim mattered, if the size of each chat group had any effect and if asking for a person&#x27;s help by directly using their screen name would have any effect.

Results indicated that the gender of the victim had no effect on whether or not a bystander assisted the victim. Consistent with findings of Latané and Darley, the number of people present in the chat room did have an effect. The response time for smaller chat groups was quicker than in the larger chat groups. However, this effect was nonexistent when the victim (Suzy or Jake) asked for help from a specific person in the chat group. The mean response time for groups in which a specific person was called out was 36.38 seconds. The mean response time for groups in which no screen name was pointed out was 51.53 seconds. A significant finding of the research is that intervention depends on whether or not a victim asked for help by specifying a screen name. The group size effect was inhibited when the victim specifically asked a specific person for help. The group size effect was not inhibited if the victim did not ask a specific person for help.

===Children as bystanders===
Although most research has been conducted on adults, children can be bystanders too. A study conducted by Robert Thornberg in 2007 came up with seven reasons why children do not help when another classmate is in distress. These include: trivialisation, dissociation, embarrassment association, &#x27;busy working&#x27; priority (the prioritisation of a current task instead of assistance), compliance with a competitive norm (where another social norm applies, a child may instead comply with that norm), audience modelling (modelling of the behaviours of the other audience members), and responsibility transfer (assuming that another person is responsible).

In a further study, Thornberg concluded that there are seven stages of moral deliberation as a bystander in bystander situations among the Swedish schoolchildren he observed and interviewed: (a) &quot;noticing that something is wrong&quot;, i.e., children pay selective attention to their environment, and sometimes they do not tune in on a distressed peer if they are in a hurry or their view is obstructed, (b) &quot;interpreting a need for help&quot;—sometimes children think others are just playing rather than actually in distress or they display pluralistic ignorance, (c) &quot;feeling empathy&quot;, i.e., having tuned in on a situation and concluded that help is needed, children might feel sorry for an injured peer, or angry about unwarranted aggression (empathic anger), (d) &quot;processing the school&#x27;s moral frames&quot;—Thornberg identified five contextual ingredients influencing children&#x27;s behavior in bystander situations (the definition of a good student, tribe caring, gender stereotypes, and social-hierarchy-dependent morality), (e) &quot;scanning for social status and relations&quot;, i.e., students were less likely to intervene if they did not define themselves as friends of the victim or belonging to the same significant social category as the victim, or if there were high-status students present or involved as aggressors—conversely, lower-status children were more likely to intervene if only a few other low-status children were around, (f) &quot;condensing motives for action&quot;, such as considering a number of factors such as possible benefits and costs, and (g) &quot;acting&quot;, i.e., all of the above coalesced into a decision to intervene or not. It is striking how this was less an individual decision than the product of a set of interpersonal and institutional processes.

==Implications of research==

===South African murder trials===
In an effort to make South African courts more just in their convictions, the concept of &quot;extenuating circumstances&quot; came into being. However, no concrete definition of extenuating circumstances was ever made. The South African courts began using the testimony of expert social psychologists to define what extenuating circumstances would mean in the justice system. Examples include: deindividuation, bystander apathy, and conformity.

In the case of &quot;S. vs. Sibisi and Others (1989)&quot; eight members of the South African Railways and Harbours Union were involved in the murder of four workers who chose not to join in the SARHWU strike. Psychologists Scott Fraser and Andrew Colman presented evidence for the defense using research from social psychology.
Social anthropologist Boet Kotzé provided evidence for the defense as well. He testified that African cultures are characterized by a collective consciousness. Kotzé testified that the collective conscious contributed to the defendants&#x27; willingness to act with the group rather than act as individuals. Fraser and Colman stated that &quot;bystander apathy,&quot; deindividuation, conformity and group polarization were extenuating factors in the killing of the four strike breakers. They explained that deindividuation may affect group members&#x27; ability to realize that they are still accountable for their individual actions even when with a group. They also used research on bystander apathy by Latané and Darley to illustrate why four of the eight defendants watched as the other four defendants killed four men. The testimonies of Fraser and Colman helped four of the defendants escape the death penalty.

===Laws===

Some parts of the world have included laws that hold bystanders responsible when they witness an emergency.

# The Charter of human rights and freedoms of Quebec states that &quot;[e]very person must come to the aid of anyone whose life is in peril, either personally or calling for aid, unless it involves danger to himself or a third person, or he has another valid reason&quot;. It is therefore a legal obligation to assist people in danger in Quebec if it is safe to do so.
# Likewise, the Brazilian Penal Code states that it is a crime not to rescue (or call emergency services when appropriate) injured or disabled people including those found under grave and imminent danger as long as it safe to do so. This also includes abandoned children.
# The German penal code makes it a crime for a person to fail to render aid in cases of accidents or other common dangers, unless such person would thereby endanger themselves or it would be contrary to some other important obligation.

In the US, Good Samaritan laws have been implemented to protect bystanders who acted in good faith. Many organizations are including bystander training. For example, the United States Department of the Army is doing bystander training with respect to sexual assault. Some organizations routinely do bystander training with respect to safety issues. Others have been doing bystander training with respect to diversity issues. Organizations such as American universities are also using bystander research to improve bystander attitudes in cases of rape. Examples include the InterAct Sexual Assault Prevention program and the Green Dot program. Others have been critical of these laws for being punitive and criminalizing the problem they are meant to address.

Many institutions have worked to provide options for bystanders who see behavior they find unacceptable. These options are usually provided through complaint systems—so bystanders have choices about where to go. One option that is particularly helpful is that of an organizational ombudsman, who keeps no records for the employer and is near-absolutely confidential.

==Notable examples==
===Kitty Genovese===

On March 13, 1964, 28-year-old bartender Catherine &quot;Kitty&quot; Genovese was stabbed, sexually assaulted, and murdered while walking home from work at 3 a.m. in Queens, New York. The case is widely known for originally stimulating social psychological research into the &quot;bystander effect&quot;. According to a sensationalized article in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, 38 witnesses watched the stabbings but did not intervene or even call the police until after the attacker fled and Genovese had died.

The shocking account drew widespread public attention and many newspaper editorials. Psychology researchers Latané and Darley attributed the lack of help by witnesses to diffusion of responsibility: because each witness saw others witnessing the same event, they assumed that the others would be taking responsibility and calling the police, and therefore did nothing to stop the situation themselves.

An article published in &quot;American Psychologist&quot; in 2007 found that the story of Genovese&#x27;s murder had been exaggerated by the media. There were far fewer than 38 eyewitnesses, the police were called at least once during the attack, and many of the bystanders who overheard the attack could not actually see the event. In 2016, &quot;The New York Times&quot; called its own reporting &quot;flawed&quot;, stating that the original story &quot;grossly exaggerated the number of witnesses and what they had perceived&quot;.

=== Jane Doe of Richmond High ===

On October 24, 2009, a female student of Richmond High School was gang-raped and beaten by a group of boys and men after a classmate invited her to a dark courtyard outside the school&#x27;s homecoming dance. It was reported that she was treated politely and drank brandy with the group before the assault took place, which lasted two and a half hours before a young woman notified the police. As many as 20 people witnessed the incident, with several reportedly cheering and videotaping it. She was hospitalised for scrapes and bruises all over her face and body, and later sustained scars from cigarette burns on her back, as well as hips that regularly pop out of place. The case drew nationwide outrage.

===Raymond Zack===

On May 30, 2011 (Memorial Day), 53-year-old Raymond Zack, of Alameda, California, walked into the waters off Robert Crown Memorial Beach and stood neck deep in water roughly 150 yards offshore for almost an hour. His foster mother, Dolores Berry, called 9-1-1 and said that he was trying to drown himself. (There are conflicting reports about Zack&#x27;s intentions.) Firefighters and police responded but did not enter the water. The firefighters called for a United States Coast Guard boat to respond to the scene. According to police reports, Alameda police expected the firefighters to enter the water. Firefighters later said that they did not have current training and certifications to perform land-based water rescue. Dozens of civilians on the beach, and watching from their homes across from the beach, did not enter the water, apparently expecting public safety officers to conduct a rescue. Eventually, Zack collapsed in the water, apparently from hypothermia. Even then, nobody entered the water for several minutes. Finally, a good samaritan entered the water and pulled Zack to shore. Zack died afterwards at a local hospital.

===Jane Doe of Philadelphia===

On October 13, 2021, a passenger was sexually harassed and eventually raped by another rider on a SEPTA train in Philadelphia, with several bystanders in the area purportedly witnessing the incident, even allegedly recording the assault on their phones, and failing to alert authorities or stop the assault until one off-duty employee called 911 after boarding the train and noticing the attack. The sexual assault, which went on for nearly 40 minutes, as well as the passengers&#x27; apparent lack of action, was recorded on SEPTA surveillance video. After the initial 911 call, a SEPTA officer boarded the train when it arrived at the 69th Street Transportation Center, arresting the suspect after pulling him off the victim.

This assault gained international attention for the passengers&#x27; apparent lack of action, though some scholars argued that the bystanders simply did not know what to do in that instance. According to SEPTA general manager Leslie Richards, the arrest occurred 3 minutes after the initial 911 call, which happened after the victim had been harassed for more than half an hour. The organization eventually released a statement, saying &quot;There were other people on the train who witnessed this horrific act, and it may have been stopped sooner if a rider called 911.&quot; However, Delaware County District Attorney Jack Stollsteimer refuted the claim that the bystanders were filming the assault, countering that many of the bystanders may not have understood what they were seeing.

===Piang Ngaih Don===

In July 2016, a 24-year-old Myanmar citizen and domestic maid Piang Ngaih Don was abused and murdered by her employer Gaiyathiri Murugayan and Gaiyathiri&#x27;s mother Prema S. Naraynasamy. Both Gaiyathiri and Prema were arrested and charged with murder, while a third accomplice, Gaiyathiri&#x27;s husband Kevin Chelvam who was then a police officer, was also charged with maid abuse and his police duties were suspended in view of his criminal proceedings. Subsequently, Gaiyathiri was sentenced to 30 years&#x27; imprisonment in June 2021 for a lower charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder. Prema was convicted of multiple charges of maid abuse and destroying evidence and sentenced to 17 years&#x27; imprisonment in 2023.

The case invoked public outrage, shock and anger over the extensive cruelty of the case and death of the maid. Piang&#x27;s case also demonstrated chilling similarities and comparisons to Kitty Genovese&#x27;s murder and the existence of the bystander effect, as it was discovered that during the regular health-checks at the hospital and the maid agency, there were people who suspected that Piang may have been abused but Gaiyathiri and her family denied them; no police report was made in relation to these suspected signs of maid abuse.

==Counterexample==
In 2019, a large international cultural anthropology study analyzed 219 street disputes and confrontations that were recorded by security cameras in three cities in different countries: Lancaster, Amsterdam, and Cape Town. Contrary to the hypothesis of the bystander effect, the study found that bystanders intervened in almost every case, and the chance of intervention went up with the number of bystanders, &quot;a highly radical discovery and a completely different outcome than theory predicts&quot;.

However, the final statement is likely to be inaccuarate. As a 2022 study conducted by one of the same researchers of the initial 2019 study has found that the presence of a weapon had no effect on whether people would intervene or not. Unlike most prior studies on the bystander effect, these studies focused on the likelihood of receiving help in a public confrontation at all, rather than simply comparing the difference between likelihood of bystander intervention when alone or in a group. The 2019 study concluded that the decreased likelihood of a particular person helping was offset by the increased likelihood that at least someone would help. Findings were consistent with other studies that showed lower rates of bystander apathy when the situation was a dangerous emergency.

<text>Something Happened is Joseph Heller&#x27;s second novel (published in 1974, thirteen years after &quot;Catch-22&quot;). Its main character and narrator is Bob Slocum, a businessman who engages in a stream of consciousness narrative about his job, his family, his childhood, his sexual escapades, and his own psyche. Although &quot;Something Happened&quot; failed to achieve the level of renown that &quot;Catch-22&quot; did, it has since developed a cult following, with some considering it one of Heller&#x27;s finest works.

==Plot==

While there is an ongoing plot about Slocum preparing for a promotion at work, most of the book focuses on detailing various events from his life, ranging from early childhood to his predictions for the future, often in non-chronological order and with little if anything to connect one anecdote to the next. Near the end of the book, Slocum starts worrying about the state of his own sanity as he finds himself hallucinating or remembering events incorrectly, suggesting that some or all of the novel might be the product of his imagination, making him an unreliable narrator.

==Reception==
&quot;Something Happened&quot; has frequently been criticized as overlong, rambling, and deeply unhappy. These sentiments are echoed in a review of the novel by fellow writer and humorist Kurt Vonnegut, but are countered with praise for the novel&#x27;s prose and the meticulous patience Heller took in the creation of the novel, stating, &quot;Is this book any good? Yes. It is splendidly put together and hypnotic to read. It is as clear and hard-edged as a cut diamond. Mr. Heller&#x27;s concentration and patience are so evident on every page that one can only say that &#x27;Something Happened&#x27; is at all points precisely what he hoped it would be.&quot; In a contemporary write-up for &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot;, the reviewer stated that &quot;there is none of the rogue absurdism or imaginative verve&quot; of Heller&#x27;s previous novel, but praised the book&#x27;s &quot;bravura, expertise and cumulative hook&quot;.

&quot;Something Happened&quot; has since garnered a small base of devoted fans. In 2015, Carmen Petaccio referred to it as the &quot;most criminally overlooked great novel of the past half century [...] one of the most pleasurable, engrossing, and in retrospect moving American novels ever written.&quot; Naturi Thomas-Millard called it the &quot;best book you&#x27;ve never read&quot;; while agreeing that it is overlong, she billed it as &quot;an invaluable study in how to portray the horror of everyday life.&quot; Novelist Jonathan Franzen prefers &quot;Something Happened&quot; to &quot;Catch-22&quot;, and Christopher Buckley referred to the work as &quot;dark and brilliant&quot;. Comedian Richard Lewis claims he &quot;happily lost most of [his] hope&quot; after reading the novel.

<text>Addicted to Love is a 1997 American romantic black comedy film directed by Griffin Dunne and starring Meg Ryan, Matthew Broderick, Tchéky Karyo, and Kelly Preston. Its title is based on Robert Palmer&#x27;s song &quot;Addicted to Love,&quot; a cover of the song by Neneh Cherry is featured in the film.

==Plot==
The story begins in a small town, where Sam works as an astronomer and enjoys an idyllic life with his childhood sweetheart Linda, who is a schoolteacher. She wants more experiences than can be offered there, so goes to New York City for a two-month teaching fellowship.

Instead of returning home, Linda sends Sam a Dear John letter announcing that she is staying in New York. He leaves almost immediately for the city, convinced he can get her back.

Sam quickly discovers Linda&#x27;s living with a new lover, French restaurant owner Anton. Sam breaks into an abandoned building across from Anton&#x27;s residence, and converts his astronomy equipment to surveillance equipment. He sets up house (and a camera obscura), watching her interactions with Anton in the hopes of finding out more information about them, as well as predicting when they will break up.

Sam&#x27;s surveillance operation is later discovered by Maggie, a photographer and motorcyclist, determined to get revenge on Anton, her ex-fiancé. She sets up in a nearby room, and soon has sound equipment set up to eavesdrop on the couple.

Out of money and to find out more about him, Sam takes a job at Anton&#x27;s restaurant as a dishwasher. As the men talk they become friends, Anton unaware of Sam&#x27;s connection to Linda.

Partnering with Maggie in the hopes of driving them apart, a comedy of errors ensues, in which Maggie and Sam try several unethical and nasty tricks to break apart their respective former partners, including: identity theft, assault, embarrassing him in public with a street performer&#x27;s monkey, paying children to spray him with women&#x27;s perfume in the street, planting women&#x27;s underwear and receipts for expensive gifts and getting Anton&#x27;s restaurant shut down by bringing in cockroaches on a busy night with a food critic there.

Mutually hostile at first, Sam and Maggie eventually warm up to each other in their quest to break up Linda and Anton, complicating their original mission to win their former partners back. When Maggie&#x27;s nan visits, she insists they kiss for a photo (she believes he is her fiancé), and they obviously share a moment. But suddenly they discover Linda has left Anton. He really had slept with another woman, someone in the bank to help with a loan.

Maggie pushes Sam out, as Linda is now gone, and he runs into a desolate Anton, who talks him into joining him at his place. Maggie watches as they interact. The next day, she&#x27;s there to spy on Sam when he sees and kisses Linda, and again spies on him that night as he helps a severely injured Anton he unintentionally got put into an upper body cast. Sam mentions Linda, which makes Anton realise something is fishy about Sam, and he attacks him.

The upshot of it all is, Maggie makes peace with Anton, Sam comes clean with Linda and in the closing there are two couples: Sam and Maggie, Anton back with Linda.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film, marking actor Griffin Dunne&#x27;s full-length directorial debut, was released on May 23, one week before the highly competitive Memorial Day weekend in the United States.

The film opened at No. 2 at the North American box office making US$11.4 million in its opening weekend, behind &quot;The Lost World: Jurassic Park.&quot;

The film only managed to gross $34,673,095 at the box office, several million less than either Ryan or Broderick&#x27;s averages.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 55% based on reviews from 33 critics. On Metacritic, it has a score of 49 out of 100 based on reviews from 19 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews.&quot; Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade B on scale of A to F.

&quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; film critic Roger Ebert panned it as immature, implausible and imbecilic, giving it two stars out of a possible four. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;&#x27;Kevin Thomas called the film &quot;creepy,&quot; writing: 

&quot;Time Out New York&quot; film critic Andrew Johnston wrote: &quot;Some say that movies named after hit songs always suck. In its own unspectacular way, &quot;Addicted to Love&quot; proves them wrong. Griffin Dunne&#x27;s directorial debut is no artistic triumph, certainly, but it is a reasonably entertaining big-screen sitcom.&quot; In 2020, David Sims, film critic for &quot;The Atlantic,&quot; called it &quot;underrated&quot; and &quot;a personal favorite.&quot;

==Locations==
While the majority of the filming took place where it was set, in the Greenwich Village area of New York City, some shooting was done in Centreville, Delaware and Swarthmore, Pennsylvania.

<text>The Hudsonian godwit (Limosa haemastica) is a large shorebird in the sandpiper family, Scolopacidae. It is a long distance migratory species that breeds at remote sites in northern Canada and winters in southern South America. The genus name &quot;Limosa&quot; is from Latin and means &quot;muddy&quot;, from &quot;limus&quot;, &quot;mud&quot;. The specific &quot;haemastica&quot; is from Ancient Greek and means &quot;bloody&quot;.The English term &quot;godwit&quot; is believed to imitate the bird&#x27;s call.

==Taxonomy==
The Hudsonian godwit was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it in the genus &quot;Scolopax&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Scolopax haemastica&quot;. Linnaeus based his entry on the &quot;red-breasted godwit&quot; that had been described and illustrated in 1750 by the English naturalist George Edwards in the third volume of his &quot;A Natural History of Uncommon Birds&quot;. Edwards had obtained a specimen that had been collected in the Hudson Bay region of Canada by James Isham, an employee of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. Linnaeus specified the type locality as North America but this is restricted to the Hudson Bay following Edwards. The Hudsonian godwit is now one of four species placed in the genus &quot;Limosa&quot; that was introduced in 1760 by French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson. The species is considered to be monotypic: no subspecies are recognised. The genus name &quot;Limosa&quot; is from Latin and means &quot;muddy&quot;, from &quot;limus&quot;, &quot;mud&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;haemastica&quot; is from Ancient Greek &quot;haimatikos&quot; meaning &quot;bloody&quot;. The English name &quot;godwit&quot; was first recorded in about 1416–17 and is believed to imitate the bird&#x27;s call.

==Description==
Adults have long dark legs and a long pink bill with a slight upward curve and dark at the tip. The upper parts are mottled brown and the underparts are chestnut. The tail is black and the rump is white. They show black wing linings in flight. The legs and feet are bluish-grey.
==Distribution and habitat==
They migrate to South America and the Caribbean. These birds gather at James Bay before fall migration. In good weather, many birds make the trip south without stopping. They are vagrants to Europe, Australia, and South Africa.

They can perhaps be most easily seen in migration on the east coast of North America where they can be plentiful in migration in late July through early August.

==Behaviour and ecology==
===Breeding===
Their breeding habitat is the far north near the tree line in northwestern Canada and Alaska, also on the shores of Hudson Bay. They nest on the ground, in a well-concealed location in a marshy area. The female usually lays 4 olive-buff eggs marked with darker splotches. Incubation period is 22 days. Both parents look after the young birds, who find their own food and are able to fly within a month of hatching.

===Food and feeding===
These birds forage by probing in shallow water. They eat invertebrates and plant material.

==Status==
The species is classified as of Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

<doc id="319026" wikidata="Q55950666" url="?curid=319026" title="Bystander intervention">
<text>Bystander intervention is a type of training used in post-secondary education institutions to prevent sexual assault or rape, binge drinking and harassment and unwanted comments of racist, homophobic, or transphobic nature. A bystander is a person who is present at an event, party, or other setting who notices a problematic situation, such as a someone making sexual advances on a drunk person. The bystander then takes on personal responsibility and takes action to intervene, with the goal of preventing the situation from escalating. 

The bystander who is intervening has several options, including distracting either of the people, getting help from others, checking in later, or directly intervening. There are risks to bystander intervention; it can lead to fights, it can ruin the mood for the people who were &quot;intervened&quot; into, and it can lead to confrontations. Bystander intervention may also be called &quot;bystander education&quot;, because the model is based on a system of educating trainers and leaders who will then go on to train people from their community.

==Prevention of sexual assault==
One bystander intervention researcher suggests that a potential sexual assault should be stopped by pretending to spill a drink on a drunk person who is trying to make sexual moves on another intoxicated person, to distract him and &quot;...stop bad behavior before it crosses the line from drunken partying to sexual assault&quot;. Advocates hope that bystander intervention programs can yield the same results on sexual assault that designated driver initiatives have had in reducing impaired driving; another similarity is that both programs do not discourage drinking itself, only the combination of drinking and law-breaking. Some US universities are introducing bystander education initiatives to comply with Title IX, which requires US universities which receive federal funding to not discriminate on basis of gender.

==Research==
A study on bystander intervention by the University of New Hampshire showed that 38 percent of the men who participated in a bystander intervention campaign training said they intervened to stop a sexual assault, versus only 12 percent of the control group (who did not see the campaign). An Ohio University study compared men who took a bystander intervention session with a group of men who did not have the training; 1.5 percent of the bystander intervention participants said they had committed sexual assault over the last four months, versus 6.7 percent from the untrained group. One challenge with bystander education programs is that a study has shown that white female students are less likely to intervene in a hypothetical situation where they see an intoxicated black woman being led towards a bedroom at a party by a non-intoxicated male, as white students feel &quot;less personal responsibility&quot; to help women of colour and they feel that the black woman is deriving pleasure from the situation.

<doc id="319027" wikidata="Q860251" url="?curid=319027" title="Urban warfare">
<text>Urban warfare is warfare in urban areas such as towns and cities. Urban combat differs from combat in the open at both operational and the tactical levels. Complicating factors in urban warfare include the presence of civilians and the complexity of the urban terrain. Urban combat operations may be conducted to capitalize on strategic or tactical advantages associated with the possession or the control of a particular urban area or to deny these advantages to the enemy. It is considered to be arguably the most difficult form of warfare.

Fighting in urban areas negates the advantages that one side may have over the other in armor, heavy artillery, or air support. Ambushes laid down by small groups of soldiers with handheld anti-tank weapons can destroy entire columns of modern armor (as in the First Battle of Grozny), while artillery and air support can be severely reduced if the &quot;superior&quot; party wants to limit civilian casualties as much as possible, but the defending party does not (or even uses civilians as human shields).

Some civilians may be difficult to distinguish from such combatants as armed militias and gangs, and particularly individuals who are simply trying to protect their homes from attackers. Tactics are complicated by a three-dimensional environment, limited fields of view and fire because of buildings, enhanced concealment and cover for defenders, below-ground infrastructure, and the ease of placement of booby traps and snipers.

==Military terminology==

Historically, the United States Armed Forces has referred to urban warfare as &quot;UO&quot; (urban operations), but this term has been largely replaced with &quot;MOUT&quot; (military operations in urban terrain).

The British armed forces terms are &quot;OBUA&quot; (operations in built-up areas), &quot;FIBUA&quot; (fighting in built-up areas), or sometimes (colloquially) &quot;FISH&quot; (fighting in someone&#x27;s house), or &quot;FISH and CHIPS&quot; (fighting in someone&#x27;s house and causing havoc in people&#x27;s streets/public spaces).

The term &quot;FOFO&quot; (fighting in fortified objectives) refers to clearing enemy personnel from narrow and entrenched places like bunkers, trenches and strongholds; the dismantling of mines and wires; and the securing of footholds in enemy areas.

Israel Defense Forces calls urban warfare לש&quot;ב (pronounced &quot;LASHAB&quot;), a Hebrew acronym for &quot;warfare on urban terrain&quot;. LASHAB in the IDF includes large-scale tactics (such as use of heavy armoured personnel carriers, armoured bulldozers, UAVs for intelligence, etc.), close-quarters battle training for fighting forces (how a small team of infantry soldiers should fight in close and built-up spaces). IDF&#x27;s LASHAB was developed mainly in recent decades, after the 1982 Lebanon War included urban warfare in Beirut and Lebanese villages, and was further developed during the Second Intifada (2000–2005) in which IDF soldiers entered and fought in Palestinian cities, villages and refugee camps. The IDF has an advanced facility for training soldiers and units in urban warfare.

== Urban operations ==


Urban military operations in World War II often relied on large quantities of artillery bombardment and air support varying from ground attack fighters to heavy bombers. In the European theatre of war, roughly 40% of battles took place in urban areas. In some particularly vicious urban warfare battles such as Stalingrad and Warsaw, all weapons were used irrespective of their consequences.

Military historian Victor Davis Hanson noted the lethality of urban warfare in the Second World War, &quot;When civilian met soldier in the confined landscapes, the death toll spiked, and it was no surprise that the greatest carnage of World War II—at Leningrad and Stalingrad—was the result of efforts to storm municipal fortresses&quot;.

However, when liberating occupied territory some restraint was often applied, particularly in urban settings. For example, Canadian operations in both Ortona and Groningen avoided the use of artillery altogether to spare civilians and buildings, and during the Battle of Manila in 1945, General MacArthur initially placed a ban on artillery and air strikes to save civilian lives.

Military forces are bound by the laws of war governing military necessity to the amount of force which can be applied when attacking an area where there are known to be civilians. Until the 1970s, this was covered by the 1907 Hague Convention &quot;IV – The Laws and Customs of War on Land&quot; which specifically includes articles 25–27. This has since been supplemented by the &quot;Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions of August 12, 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International and Non-International Armed Conflicts&quot;.
Sometimes distinction and proportionality, as in the case of the Canadians in Ortona, causes the attacking force to restrain from using all the force they could when attacking a city. In other cases, such as the Battle of Stalingrad and the Battle of Berlin, both military forces considered evacuating civilians only to find it impractical.

When Russian forces attacked Grozny in 1999, they conducted a massive artillery and air bombardment campaign in an attempt to smash the city into submission. The Russian Army handled the issue of civilian casualties by issuing an ultimatum urging citizens to leave or be destroyed without mercy. Leaflets dropped on the city read: &quot;&#x27;You are surrounded, all roads to Grozny are blocked...Persons who stay in the city will be considered terrorists and bandits and will be destroyed by artillery and aviation. There will be no further negotiations. Everyone who does not leave the city will be destroyed&quot; &#x27;.
Fighting in an urban environment can offer some advantages to a weaker defending force or to guerrilla fighters through ambush-induced attrition losses. The attacking army must account for three dimensions more often, and consequently expend greater amounts of manpower to secure a myriad of structures, and mountains of rubble.

Ferroconcrete structures will be ruined by heavy bombardment, but it is very difficult to demolish such a building totally when it is well defended. Soviet forces had to fight room by room while defending the Red October Steel Factory during the Battle of Stalingrad, and in 1945, during the race to capture the Reichstag, despite heavy bombardment with artillery at point blank range (including 203 mm howitzers).

It is also difficult to destroy underground or heavily fortified structures such as bunkers and utility tunnels; during the Siege of Budapest in 1944 fighting broke out in the sewers, as both Axis and Soviet troops used them for troop movements.

Analysts debate the scope and size of urban battles in the modern day, as they are unlikely to match the scale of battles in the Second World War. For example, professor Michael C. Desch states that while &quot;enormous forces engaged on both sides in those battles may never be seen in high-intensity urban battles again&quot;, that &quot;the large numbers of killed and wounded underline the basic fact that such conflict is extremely lethal&quot;, referencing the battles of Stalingrad and Berlin. An article by the Modern War Institute states that while lessons may be taken from Stalingrad, ultimately &quot;Stalingrad took place in a theater with a large number of army groups with a total of a million soldiers involved on each side; modern armies are unlikely to fight with these numbers.&quot;

Many analysts, such as former American army general and Commandant of the United States Marine Corps, Charles C. Krulak, and retired military officer and chairman of the urban warfare studies at the Modern War Institute, John Spencer have predicted urban warfare to become the norm in wars. Spencer confirmed this to be true in an article in 2024, providing a list of numerous urban battles in the recent decades of the 21st century alone, those being Fallujah, Sadr City, Mosul, Raqqa, Marawi, and now Bakhmut, Mariupol, and Khan Yunis in the 2020s. In 2023, analyst Mikael Weissmann claimed that it is widely agreed upon that urban warfare will be the &quot;battlefields of tomorrow&quot;.

==Urban warfare tactics==

The characteristics of an average city include tall buildings, narrow alleys, sewage tunnels and possibly a subway system. Defenders may have the advantage of detailed local knowledge of the area, right down to the layout inside of buildings and means of travel not shown on maps.

The buildings can provide excellent sniping posts while alleys and rubble-filled streets are ideal for planting booby traps. Defenders can move from one part of the city to another undetected using tunnels and spring ambushes.

Meanwhile, the attackers tend to become more exposed than the defender as they must use the open streets more often, unfamiliar with the defenders&#x27; secret and hidden routes. During a house to house search the attacker is often also exposed on the streets.

===Battle of Monterrey, Mexico===

The Battle of Monterrey was the U.S. Army&#x27;s first major encounter with urban warfare. It occurred in September 1846 when the U.S. Army under Zachary Taylor invaded the town. The U.S. Army had no prior training in urban warfare and the Mexican defenders hid on rooftops, shot through loopholes, and stationed cannons in the middle of the city&#x27;s streets. The houses at Monterrey were made of thick adobe, with strong double doors and few windows. The rooftops were lined with a two-foot-tall wall that acted as a parapet for the defending soldiers. Each home was a fort unto itself.

On September 21, 1846, the U.S. Army which included some of its best soldiers, recent West Point graduates, marched down the city&#x27;s streets and were cut down by the Mexican defenders. They could not see the men hidden behind walls, loopholes, or rooftops. They tried to march straight down the street until the intense fire drove them to hide in adjacent buildings. Taylor tried to move artillery into the city but it could not hit the well-hidden defenders any better than the U.S. soldiers could. Two days later the US again assaulted the city from two sides and this time they fought differently.

Not wanting to repeat the mistakes of the 21st, General William Jenkins Worth listened to his Texan advisers. These men had fought in Mexican cities before at the Battle of Mier in 1842 and the Battle of Bexar in 1835. They understood that the army needed to &quot;mouse hole&quot; through each house and root out the defenders in close combat.

Worth&#x27;s men used pick axes to chip holes in the adobe walls of the homes, in the roof of the house from where the soldiers could drop in, or used ladders to climb to the top of a rooftop and assault the Mexican defenders in hand-to-hand combat. The typical assault on a home would include one man who would run to the door of the house and chip the door away with a pick axe under covering fire. Once the door showed signs of weakening, 3–4 other soldiers would run to the door and barge in with revolvers blazing. Worth lost few men on the 23rd using these new urban warfare techniques.

===Battle of Stalingrad===
The Battle of Stalingrad is largely seen as the defining battle of urban warfare, with the battle commonly studied and referenced in studies of urban warfare. The battle was the single largest and costliest urban battle ever, with it being seen as the worst and most extreme case of urban warfare. The Battle of Stalingrad saw all types of &quot;MOUT&quot; combat techniques. Historian Iain MacGregor states that the &quot;evolution of urban, house-to-house fighting and defending these buildings and built-up areas was seemingly born in Stalingrad in the winter of 1942&quot;. The battle &quot;occupies a famous, notorious place in the history of war, particularly urban warfare. It seems to encapsulate and personify it, to provide an instinctive yardstick by which urban warfare can be examined, understood, defined, and assessed&quot; according to military historian Stephen Walsh.

The Soviets used the great amount of destruction to their advantage by adding man-made defenses such as barbed wire, minefields, trenches, and bunkers to the rubble, while large factories even housed tanks and large-caliber guns within. In addition, Soviet urban warfare relied on 20-to-50-man-assault groups, armed with machine guns, grenades and satchel charges, and buildings fortified as strongpoints with clear fields of fire.

===Battle of Berlin===


A Soviet combat group was a mixed arms unit of about eighty men, divided into assault groups of six to eight men, closely supported by field artillery. These were tactical units which were able to apply the tactics of house to house fighting that the Soviets had been forced to develop and refine at each &quot;Festungsstadt&quot; (fortress city) they had encountered from Stalingrad to Berlin.
The German tactics in the battle of Berlin were dictated by three considerations: the experience that the Germans had gained during five years of war; the physical characteristics of Berlin; and the tactics used by the Soviets.

Most of the central districts of Berlin consisted of city blocks with straight wide roads, intersected by several waterways, parks and large railway marshalling yards. The terrain was predominantly flat but there were some low hills like that of Kreuzberg that is above sea level.

Much of the housing stock consisted of apartment blocks built in the second half of the 19th century. Most of those, thanks to housing regulations and few elevators, were five stories high, built around a courtyard which could be reached from the street through a corridor large enough to take a horse and cart or small trucks used to deliver coal. In many places these apartment blocks were built around several courtyards, one behind the other, each one reached through the outer courtyards by a ground-level tunnel similar to that between the first courtyard and the road. The larger, more expensive flats faced the street and the smaller, less expensive ones were found around the inner courtyards.

Just as the Soviets had learned a lot about urban warfare, so had the Germans. The &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; did not use the makeshift barricades erected close to street corners, because these could be raked by artillery fire from guns firing over open sights further along the straight streets. Instead, they put snipers and machine guns on the upper floors and the roofs – a safer deployment as the Soviet tanks could not elevate their guns that high. They also put men armed with &quot;panzerfausts&quot; in cellar windows to ambush tanks as they moved down the streets. These tactics were quickly adopted by the Hitler Youth and the First World War &quot;Volkssturm&quot; veterans.

To counter these tactics, Soviet submachine gunners rode the tanks and sprayed every doorway and window, but this meant the tank could not traverse its turret quickly. The other solution was to rely on heavy howitzers (152 mm and 203 mm) firing over open sights to blast defended buildings and to use anti-aircraft guns against defenders posted on the higher floors.

Soviet combat groups started to move from house to house instead of directly down the streets. They moved through the apartments and cellars blasting holes through the walls of adjacent buildings (for which the Soviets found abandoned German &quot;panzerfausts&quot; were very effective), while others fought across the roof tops and through the attics.

These tactics took the Germans lying in ambush for tanks in the flanks. Flamethrowers and grenades were very effective, but as the Berlin civilian population had not been evacuated these tactics inevitably killed many civilians.

===First Chechen War===

During the First Chechen War most of the Chechen fighters had been trained in the Soviet armed forces. They were divided into combat groups consisting of 15 to 20 personnel, subdivided into three or four-man fire teams. A fire team consisted of an antitank gunner, usually armed with a Russian made RPG-7s or RPG-18s, a machine gunner and a sniper. The team would be supported by ammunition runners and assistant gunners. To destroy Russian armoured vehicles in Grozny, five or six hunter-killer fire teams deployed at ground level, in second and third stories, and in basements. The snipers and machine gunners would pin down the supporting infantry while the antitank gunners would engage the armoured vehicle aiming at the top, rear and sides of vehicles.

Initially, the Russians were taken by surprise. Their armoured columns that were supposed to take the city without difficulty as Soviet forces had taken Budapest in 1956 were decimated in fighting more reminiscent of the Battle of Budapest in late 1944. As in the Soviet assault on Berlin, as a short term measure, they deployed self-propelled anti-aircraft guns (ZSU-23-4 and 2K22M) to engage the Chechen combat groups, as their tank&#x27;s main gun did not have the elevation and depression to engage the fire teams and an armoured vehicle&#x27;s machine gun could not suppress the fire of half a dozen different fire teams simultaneously.

In the long term, the Russians brought in more infantry and began a systematic advance through the city, house by house and block by block, with dismounted Russian infantry moving in support of armour. In proactive moves, the Russians started to set up ambush points of their own and then move armour towards them to lure the Chechen combat groups into ambushes.

As with the Soviet tank crews in Berlin in 1945, who attached bedsprings to the outside of their turrets to reduce the damage done by German &quot;panzerfausts&quot;, some of the Russian armour was fitted quickly with a cage of wire mesh mounted some 25–30 centimetres away from the hull armour to defeat the shaped charges of the Chechen RPGs.

=== Operation Defensive Shield ===

Operation Defensive Shield was a counter-terrorism military operation conducted by the Israel Defense Forces in April 2002 as a response to a wave of suicide bombings by Palestinian factions which claimed the lives of hundreds of Israeli civilians. It was in part characterized by alleged usage of human shields by both IDF and Palestinian militants.

The two major battles were held in Nablus and Jenin.
In Nablus, the Paratroopers Brigade and the Golani Brigade, backed by reservist armour force and combat engineers with armoured Caterpillar D9 bulldozers, entered to Nablus, killing 70 militants and arresting hundreds, while sustaining only one fatality. The forces deployed many small teams, advancing in non-linear manner from many directions, using snipers and air support. The battle ended quickly with a decisive Israeli victory.

In Jenin the battle was much harder and fierce. Unlike in Nablus, the forces who fought in Jenin were mainly reserve forces. The Palestinian militants booby-trapped the city and the refugee camp with thousands of explosive charges, some were very large and most were concealed in houses and on the streets. After 13 Israeli soldiers were killed in an ambush combined with booby traps, snipers and suicide bombers, the IDF changed its tactics from slow advancing infantry soldiers backed by attack helicopters to a heavy use of armoured bulldozers. The heavily armoured bulldozers began by clearing booby traps and ended with razing many houses, mainly in the center of the refugee camp. The armoured bulldozers were unstoppable and impervious to Palestinian attacks and by razing booby-trapped houses and buildings which used as gun posts they forced the militants in Jenin to surrender. In total, 56 Palestinians and 23 Israeli soldiers were killed in the battle of Jenin.

==Close-quarters battle==


The term close-quarter battle refers to fighting methods within buildings, streets, narrow alleys and other places where visibility and manoeuvrability are limited.

Both &quot;close-quarters-battle&quot; (CQB) and &quot;urban operations&quot; (UO) are related to urban warfare, but while UO refers mainly to the macromanagement factor (i.e. sending troops, using of heavy armoured fighting vehicles, battle management), CQB refers to the micromanagement factor—namely: how a small squad of infantry troops should fight in urban environments and/or inside buildings in order to achieve its goals with minimal casualties.

As a doctrine, CQB concerns topics such as:
:* Weapons and ammunition most suitable for the mission
:* Extra gear, such as bulletproof vests and night vision devices
:* Accurate explosives
:* Routines and drills for engaging the enemy, securing a perimeter, clearing a room, etc.
:* Team maneuvers
:* Methods and tactics

Military CQB doctrine is different from police CQB doctrine, mainly because the military usually operates in hostile areas while the police operates within docile populations.

Armies that often engage in urban warfare operations may train most of their infantry in CQB doctrine. While training will vary, it generally will focus on what proficiencies each unit possess. This is in opposition to what units may lack in either strength or weapons capabilities. 
The fundamentals of muzzle awareness and weapons safety are of the utmost importance given the propensity for fratricide due to the confined spaces, as well as the limited avenues of approach.

==Urban warfare training==

Armed forces seek to train their units for those circumstances in which they are to fight: built up, urban areas are no exception. Several countries have created simulated urban training zones. The British Army has established an &quot;Afghan village&quot; within its Stanford Battle Area and the French Army has built several urban training areas in its CENZUB facility.

During World War II, as preparation for the Allied invasion of Normandy, the population of the English village of Imber was evacuated compulsorily to provide an urban training area for United States forces. The facility has been retained, despite efforts by the displaced people to recover their homes, and was used for British Army training for counter-insurgency operations in Northern Ireland. A newer purpose-built training area has been created at Copehill Down, some 3 miles from Imber.

<text>Muḥammad bin ‘Abd al-Karīm al-Khaṭṭābī ( ), better known as Abd el-Krim (; 1882 or 1883 – 6 February 1963), was a Moroccan political and military leader and the president of the Republic of the Rif. He and his brother M&#x27;Hammad led a large-scale revolt by a coalition of Riffian tribes against the Spanish and French Protectorates of the Rif and the rest of Morocco. His guerrilla tactics, which included the first-ever use of tunneling as a technique of modern warfare, directly influenced Ho Chi Minh, Mao Zedong and Che Guevara. He also became one of the major figures of Arab nationalism, which he actively supported.

== Early life ==
Muhammad ibn Abd al-Karim was born in 1882 in the settlement of Ajdir, Morocco. He was the son of Abd al-Karim al-Khattabi, a qadi (Islamic judge and chief local leader) of the Ait Youssef ou Ali clan of the Rifian Ait Ouriaghel tribe. He was named qadi in the 1880s by Hassan I.

In Abd el-Krim&#x27;s memoirs authored by Jacques Roger-Mathieu, Abd el-Krim traces his ancestry to a certain patriarch named Zar&#x27;a who originated in Yanbu in the Hejaz, belonging to an Arab tribe known as Ouled Sidi Mohammed ben Abd el-Krim, from which Abd el-Krim derived his name. Zar&#x27;a is believed to have immigrated to the Rif and settled among the Beni Ouriaghel in the 10th century.

The majority of Moroccan and Arab authors consider Abd el-Krim&#x27;s family to be Arab. Despite this, European authors such as historian Germain Ayache and anthropologist assert that Abd el-Krim&#x27;s family is entirely of Berber origin. Abd el-Krim&#x27;s ancestry is unclear, as Riffian families did not hold proper documentation regarding their geneaology.

In some instances, Abd el-Krim was attributed ancestry to Umar ibn al-Khattab and Idris II, founder of the city of Fez. Despite this, French colonial authorities claimed that Abd el-Krim &quot;forged an Idrissid ascendance&quot; to gain legitimity due to Moroccan religious tradition. According to Mohammed Azarqan, the foreign minister of the Republic of the Rif, his surname comes from the Aït Khattab clan of the Ait Ouriaghel and has no relation with Umar ibn al-Khattab. Historian María Rosa de Madariaga also denies Abd el-Krim&#x27;s alleged sharifian lineage. 

In a later interview in 1952 with the weekly &quot;Akher Saa&quot;, Abd el-Krim defined himself as an ethnic Berber and explained that his ancestors were Berbers; he also highlighted the Berber people as &quot;advanced people, who have inherited many civilizations&quot; and that &quot;we speak Arabic, the language of the Quran, and we understand ourselves in Berber, the language of our ancestors&quot;.

Abd el-Krim received a customary formative education at a local school in Ajdir and subsequently attended an institute at Tetouan. At the age of 20, he studied for two years in Fez at the Al Attarine and Saffarin madrasas and subsequently enrolled as a student at the  University of al-Qarawiyyin, the world&#x27;s oldest institution of higher education. Both Muhammad and his brother M&#x27;Hammad received a Spanish education, the latter studying mine engineering in Málaga and Madrid. Both spoke fluent Spanish and Riffian. 
Following his studies, Abd el-Krim worked in Melilla (a Spanish enclave from 1494 to the present day) as a teacher and translator for the OCTAI, the Spanish &#x27;native affairs&#x27; office, and as a journalist for the Spanish newspaper &quot;Telegrama del Rif&quot; (1906–1915). In 1907, he was hired to edit and write articles in Arabic for &quot;El Telegrama del Rif&quot;, a daily newspaper in Melilla, where he defended the advantages of European—especially Spanish—civilization and technology and their potential to elevate the economic and cultural level of the Moroccan population. In 1910, Abd el-Krim took a position as secretary-interpreter in the Native Affairs Office in Melilla, which brought him into close contact with the Spanish military bureaucracy and the town&#x27;s civil society and gained a reputation for intelligence, efficiency and discretion.

== World War I ==
Abd el-Krim entered the Spanish administration first as a secretary in the Bureau of Native Affairs, and he was later appointed chief qadi for Melilla in 1915. He taught at a Hispano-Arabic school and was an editor for the Arab section of the newspaper, &quot;El Telegrama del Rif&quot;.

Before and after the outbreak of World War I, Abd el-Krim was noted as Germanophile, defending it on the basis of arguments brought from the Egyptian and Turkish press. Abd-el-Krim offered himself as broker to the Germans to get them mining licenses in the mountains of Beni Uriaguel. His father was indeed one of the leading elements of the German–Turkish operations in the Rif.

In the midst of the conflict, he was arrested. The Spanish authorities sought to please the French, who had claimed the German agents roamed free in Melilla, thus they proceeded to hear a number of complaints on Abd el-Krim. One of the complaints dealt with an alleged involvement in a conspiracy with the German consul Walter Zechlin (1879–1962). He was imprisoned in Chefchaouen from 1916 to 1918 but then escaped. He regained his job as a judge in Melilla. 

In 1920, Abd el-Krim, together with his brother, began a war of rebellion against the Spanish incursions. His goal was to unite the tribes of the Rif into an independent Republic of the Rif, to dismantle the entire French-Spanish colonial project in Morocco and to introduce modern political reform.

== Guerrilla leadership ==

In 1921, as a byproduct of their efforts to destroy the power of a local brigand, Ahmed er Raisuni, Spanish troops approached the unoccupied areas of the Rif. Abd-el-Krim sent their commander, General Manuel Fernández Silvestre, a warning that if the troops crossed the Ameqqran River, he would consider it as an act of war. Silvestre is said to have dismissed the warning, and shortly afterwards, crossed the river with 60,000 men and set up a military post in the foothills of the Abarran mountains. In June 1921 a sizable Riffian force attacked this post killing 179 of the estimated 250 Spanish troops there. Soon afterwards, Abd el-Krim directed his forces to attack the Spanish army camp at Anwal, which they did with great success. During the attack, General Silvestre, head of the Spanish forces, committed suicide when he saw that defeat was inevitable. In three weeks of fierce battles, 13,000 Spanish and colonial troops were killed. The Rifians&#x27; colossal victory established Abd el-Krim as a master and pioneer of guerrilla warfare, and the president of the Republic of the Rif. By July, the remainder of the 60,000 Spanish soldiers who were not killed or captured had fled to the coast, and into Melilla, defeated by an army of 30,000 Rifian fighters.

The catastrophic defeat of the Spanish forces at Annual and the ensuing massacre of Spaniards at Monte Arruit delivered a &quot;coup de grace&quot; to the Restoration regime in that country, and what it was known as the African &quot;adventure&quot; became referred to as the Moroccan &quot;mess&quot; or &quot;cancer&quot;. A coup d&#x27;état led by Miguel Primo de Rivera installed a dictatorship in Spain in September 1923.

By 1924, the Spanish forces had retreated, because of more defeats at the hands of Abd el-Krim, to three isolated cities along the Moroccan coast: Tetouan, Ceuta and Melilla (the two latter under Spanish jurisdiction to this day). After Abd el-Krim invaded French-occupied Morocco in April 1925 and made it as far as Fez, France decided to take strong steps to put down the revolt. The French government, in 1925, after conferencing with the Spanish in Madrid, sent a massive French force under Marshal Henri Philippe Pétain to Morocco, where it joined with a Spanish army, with a combined total of more than 250,000 soldiers, supported by large numbers of aircraft and artillery, and began operations against the Rif Republic. By September 1925 the Spanish Army of África, supported by a combined Spanish-French fleet, landed in Alhucemas bay, barely a dozen miles from Abd-el-Krim&#x27;s capital and birthplace, Axdir, while several colonials and even metropolitan French regiments were coming from the south toward the heartlands of the Rifian rebellion.

Intense combat lasted ten months, but eventually, the combined French and Spanish armies, which used chemical bombs against the population as well as other weapons, defeated the forces of Abd el-Krim and inflicted extensive damage on the local Berber population. On 26 May 1926, Abd el-Krim surrendered to the French at his then headquarters of Targuist (Targist).

== Exile ==

Following his surrender Abd el-Krim was exiled to the island of Réunion (a French territory in the Indian Ocean) from 1926 to 1947, where he was &quot;given a comfortable estate and generous annual subsidiary&quot;, before ending up in Cairo. In exile, he continued his fierce anti-Western rhetoric, and he pushed to keep western trends from encroaching on Moroccan culture.

Abd el-Krim supported Arab nationalist causes. During the French Indochina War from 1946 to 1954, he corresponded with Ho Chi Minh and called on North African soldiers serving for France to desert to the Viet Minh. He encouraged and supported the Algerian National Liberation Front insurgents during the Algerian War from 1954 to 1962. Abd el-Krim defined the Maghreb as &quot;indissolubly part of Arab countries&quot; and &quot;having owed its existence to Islam,&quot; which he saw as an Arab and Muslim region.

In 1947, Abd el-Krim was given permission to live in the south of France after he had been released on health grounds; however, during his transfer he was freed from his French keepers and escorted to Cairo by Moroccan nationalists. There he received a &quot;hero&#x27;s welcome&quot; as an important figure of the Arab independence from European colonial rule and was celebrated in international media, thereby drawing attention to the ongoing Moroccan struggle for independence. He was nominally appointed as head of the Liberation Committee of the Arab Maghreb. The Liberation Committee was established on 5 July 1948 with Abd el-Krim at its head, with its charter stating &quot;The Arab Maghreb lived and will live with Islam and will proceed with Islam with its future, moreover it is indissolubly part of the Arab world, and its cooperation with the Arab League is natural and a necessity.&quot;

Abd el-Krim&#x27;s flight to Egypt drew global attention to the Moroccan independence movement, highlighting the broader anti-colonial sentiment and the pivotal role of Cairo as a center of transnational activism. This escape not only represented the determination and resilience of the Moroccan independence movement but also helped rally support from both local and international communities, further integrating diverse individuals and groups into the advocacy network of Moroccan nationalists. The incident emphasizes the significance of charismatic and symbolic figures in mobilizing support for national issues and strategically using international platforms to amplify their message.

After Morocco gained independence in 1956, Mohammed V of Morocco invited him back to Morocco. He refused as long as French forces were on North African soil.

==Death==
He died in 1963, just after he had seen his hopes of a Maghreb independent of colonial powers completed by the independence of Algeria.
== Family ==

Abd el-Krim had 6 sons and 5 daughters from two different women.

On 20 September 2023, Aicha El Khattabi, the daughter of the late Mohamed Ben Abdelkrim El Khattabi, passed away at the age of 81 in Casablanca. Her funeral took place 2 days later on a Friday, which was attended by Prince Moulay Rachid. The body of the deceased was buried in the Errahma cemetery, after the Dhuhr and funeral prayers.

<doc id="319040" wikidata="Q5509702" url="?curid=319040" title="Furphy">
<text>A furphy is Australian slang for an erroneous or improbable story that is claimed to be factual. Furphies are supposedly heard from reputable sources, sometimes secondhand or thirdhand, and widely believed until discounted. 

In recent years, the word has been said to derive from water carts designed and made by a company established by John Furphy of J. Furphy &amp; Sons of Shepparton, Victoria. The steel and cast iron tanks were first made in the 1880s and were used on farms and by stock agents.&lt;ref name=&quot;smh.com.au/water-under-bridge&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Many Furphy water carts were used to take water to Australian Army personnel during World War I in Australia, Europe and the Middle East. 

Because these water carts were placed where people gathered and talked, the story goes, suspiciously just like an American office watercooler, a &quot;furphy&quot; became the name for the sort of chatter that circulated by the Furphy tank (see the similar meaning and derivation of the term scuttlebutt). 

However, this story is itself most likely a furphy.

In his book &quot;Memories of a Signaller&quot;, Harold Hinckfuss wrote of the &quot;furphies&quot; or rumours of pending movements of troops, while awaiting transfer to the French lines from Egypt. His account claims that the association of &quot;furphy&quot; with the latrines is not due to any association of toilets with drinking water beside a cart, but because a &quot;furphy&quot; was a term for a fart: &quot;Every day in the tent someone would come up with a &#x27;furphy&#x27; that he had heard whilst down at the latrines. That is why the different stories were called furphies (&#x27;furphy&#x27; was the term used for a fart).&quot;

H. G. Hartnett, used and credited as a source by official historian C.E.W. Bean in his 12 volume &quot;The Official History of Australia in the War of 1914-1918&quot; (e.g. mentioned by name Vol. IV, p. 836), is more precise and detailed about the origin of the term, which 

* contradicts the much later &quot;watercart&quot; story, 
* corresponds with Australian culture rather than American, and 
* corresponds with Hinckfuss&#x27;s recollection of its alternate meaning:

It is doubtful if there ever was a more fruitful field for rumours than the army. No one knew where they emanated from. Scanty scraps of information, often reported to have been told initially in the strictest confidence, were distorted, magnified, losing nothing in the constant retelling; instead, they often branched out into new avenues as they were passed on.

Although generally treated with scant respect, these tales —&quot;Latrine Wireless News&quot; and &quot;Furphies&quot;— quite often did contain an element of truth. Those repeating them apologetically indicated that what they told was &quot;according to rumour&quot;. 

The term &quot;Furphy&quot; is said to have originated in the Broadmeadows Camp,
 Melbourne, in 1914. 
The garbage and refuse of the camp was collected in carts, somewhat resembling present day municipal council garbage trucks, each of which had the maker&#x27;s name, &quot;FURPHY&quot;, painted in large letters on both sides of the vehicle. Rumours in the camp were passed on direct from a &quot;Furphy&quot; and, in due course, &quot;Furphy&quot; was adopted as the &quot;official&quot; title for all rumours right throughout the AIF. 
&quot;(emphasis added)&quot;
As he then continues: &quot;It was, therefore, not surprising that the &#x27;Latrine Wireless&#x27; in the Old Belgian Cavalry Barracks spread the news around that the 2nd Battalion was going right back for another long spell. At the time most of us did not take it seriously. Nevertheless, the battalion did march out of Ypres next morning, 11 November [1917]&quot;.

Hartnett wrote in a bowdlerised fashion suitable for polite company of the 1920s, so his otherwise-tautological separate specification of &quot;refuse&quot; was actually the then-common euphemism for night soil, further connecting the Furphy carts to (the odour of) the latrines.

<doc id="319045" wikidata="Q767976" url="?curid=319045" title="Splinter (The Offspring album)">
<text>Splinter is the seventh studio album by American punk rock band the Offspring, released on December 9, 2003, by Columbia Records. It was the first album the band released without long-time drummer Ron Welty, who left the band three weeks before the recording sessions started.

Although not as successful as the Offspring&#x27;s previous albums, &quot;Splinter&quot; received gold certification two months after its release. The album received average reviews, but still sold reasonably well, debuting at number 30 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with around 87,000 copies sold in its first week. &quot;Hit That&quot; and &quot;(Can&#x27;t Get My) Head Around You&quot; were the only two singles to accompany the album; &quot;Spare Me the Details&quot; was also released as a single, but charted only in New Zealand.

==Production and marketing==
After spending nearly two years supporting the &quot;Conspiracy of One&quot; album, The Offspring began writing songs for &quot;Splinter&quot; in late 2002.

The recording sessions for the album lasted from January to August 2003, making it the first time The Offspring had recorded an album for that long (although their next album, 2008&#x27;s &quot;Rise and Fall, Rage and Grace&quot;, took more than a year to record).

Three weeks prior to the recording sessions, longtime drummer Ron Welty, who had played on all six of the band&#x27;s previous albums, left the band to form his own band, Steady Ground. Welty filed a lawsuit against the band on September 10, 2020 for unpaid royalties, but it was dismissed on March 6, 2023.

Due to the difficulty in finding, or auditioning, for an immediate replacement for Welty on such short notice, the band elected to have session musician Josh Freese play drums on the album; they had met Freese when his band The Vandals was signed by Dexter Holland&#x27;s label Nitro Records, while Freese also happened to be in town for when they would start recording. Holland noted Freese &quot;did all the drums in just a couple days, and he made it sound like the Offspring, not A Perfect Circle or anything else he does.&quot; After the album was finished, Atom Willard was hired to be their new drummer.

&quot;Splinter&quot; offers a variety of lyrical and musical themes, combining their usual punk rock with experiments into ska and electronic sounds, and comedic songs with heavier themes about fear, paranoia, hopelessness and anxiety. Holland said that “Half this record is pretty much fast, melodic, whatever, punk stuff. But you kind of get bored just doing that after a while. I do.&quot;, and also that given most groups are &quot;either a happy band or they&#x27;re dark&quot;, he felt only one side did not fully represent him, &quot;so I really wanted to do both in my music.&quot; A case of the mixture was lead single &quot;Hit That&quot;, with lyrics about promiscuity creating broken families, with funk-inspired keyboards played by Ronnie King. The lyrics of &quot;Spare Me the Details&quot; were inspired by how a friend of Holland did not like being given a detailed account on how his girlfriend cheated on him.

The crowd vocals in the opening track &quot;Neocon&quot; were recorded at Reading Festival in 2002 during the Offspring&#x27;s set on the festival&#x27;s main stage.

There was another song recorded for the album, called &quot;Pass Me By&quot;. The band felt that it was too heavy for &quot;Splinter&quot;, which is why it was not included on the disc.

==Album title==
On April Fools&#x27; Day 2003, the album&#x27;s title was jokingly announced as &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot;, the same name of a repeatedly delayed album by Guns N&#x27; Roses. Holland quipped, &quot;You snooze, you lose. Axl ripped off my braids, so I ripped off his album title.&quot; Holland detailed someone actually suggested &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot; as the band struggled to think of an album title and instead was saying comedic suggestions like &quot;Offspring Bloody Offspring&quot;, and that Guns N&#x27; Roses considered legal actions but were deterred by how album titles cannot be copyrighted before release. Regarding the name &quot;Splinter&quot;, which appears in a lyric of &quot;Long Way Home&quot;, Holland explained that it reflected how &quot;this record is pretty diverse and splintered&quot;, exploring different genres, while also having lyrics &quot;told in first person through these different voices that are slightly demented like a splintered personality.&quot;

==Critical reception==
Similar to &quot;Conspiracy of One&quot;, has been given a score of 60 out of 100 from Metacritic based on &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

Reviewers from sites such as Launch.com claimed &quot;Splinter&quot; was a welcome return to The Offspring&#x27;s punk roots, citing songs such as &quot;The Noose&quot; and &quot;Da Hui&quot;. The more mainstream songs, &quot;Hit That&quot; and &quot;Spare Me the Details&quot;, were also praised.

AllMusic&#x27;s Johnny Loftus also praised punk songs such as &quot;Long Way Home&quot; and &quot;Lightning Rod&quot;, and claimed second single &quot;Head Around You&quot; was the album&#x27;s standout. However, he criticized songs such as &quot;The Worst Hangover Ever&quot; and &quot;When You&#x27;re in Prison&quot;, calling them &#x27;throwaways&#x27;. PopMatters also praised &quot;Head Around You&quot;, &quot;Race Against Myself&quot;, and other heavier songs on the album. However, it also called &quot;Worst Hangover Ever&quot; &#x27;idiotic&#x27; and again criticized &quot;When You&#x27;re In Prison&quot; and &quot;Neocon&quot;. They also criticized the album’s short length, calling it “wasted potential&quot;.

In 2017, Loudwire ranked &quot;Splinter&quot; as the weakest album in the entire Offspring catalogue.

<doc id="319048" wikidata="Q471040" url="?curid=319048" title="Vinayak Damodar Savarkar">
<text>Vinayak Damodar Savarkar (28 May 1883 – 26 February 1966) was an Indian politician, activist and writer. Savarkar developed the Hindu nationalist political ideology of Hindutva while confined at Ratnagiri in 1922. He was a leading figure in the Hindu Mahasabha. The prefix &quot;Veer&quot; (meaning &#x27;brave&#x27;) has been applied to his name by his followers.

Savarkar began his political activities as a high school student and continued to do so at Fergusson College in Pune. He and his brother founded a secret society called Abhinav Bharat Society. When he went to the United Kingdom for his law studies, he involved himself with organizations such as India House and the Free India Society. He also published books advocating complete Indian independence by revolutionary means. One of the books he published called &quot;The Indian War of Independence&quot; about the Indian Rebellion of 1857 was banned by the British colonial authorities.

In 1910, Savarkar was arrested by the British government and was ordered to be extradited to India for his connections with India House. On the voyage back to India, Savarkar staged an attempt to escape from the steamship SS Morea and seek asylum in France while the ship was docked in the port of Marseille. The French port officials, however, handed him back to the British government. On return to India, Savarkar was sentenced to life terms of imprisonment totalling fifty years and was moved to the Cellular Jail in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. He was released in 1924 by the British officials after he wrote a series of mercy petitions to the British. He virtually stopped any criticism of the British regime after he was released from jail.

After being released from his restriction to Ratnagiri district in 1937, Savarkar started traveling widely, becoming a forceful orator and writer, advocating Hindu political and social unity. In his Ahmedabad addressal, he supported Two-nation theory. The Hindu Mahasabha under Savarkar&#x27;s leadership endorsed the idea of India as a &quot;Hindu Rashtra (Hindu Nation&quot;).

In 1939, the ruling Indian National Congress resigned en masse over Britain declaring India a belligerent in World War II. The Hindu Mahasabha under Savarkar formed alliances with the Muslim League and other non-Congress parties to form government in many states. Subsequently, Congress under Gandhi&#x27;s leadership launched the Quit India Movement; Savarkar boycotted the movement, writing a letter titled &quot;Stick to your Posts&quot; and recruiting Indians for the British war effort. In 1948, Savarkar was charged as a co-conspirator in the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi; he was acquitted by the court for lack of evidence.

== Life and career ==

=== Early life ===
Savarkar was born on 28 May 1883 to a Marathi Hindu Chitpavan Brahmin family, to Damodar and Radhabai Savarkar in the village of Bhagur, near the city of Nashik, Maharashtra. He had three other siblings: two brothers, Ganesh and Narayan, and a sister named Mainabai. Savarkar began his activism as a high school student. When he was 12, he led fellow students in an attack on his village mosque following Hindu-Muslim riots, stating: &quot;We vandalized the mosque to our heart&#x27;s content.&quot; In 1903, in Nashik, Savarkar and his older brother Ganesh Savarkar founded the Mitra Mela, an underground revolutionary organisation, which became Abhinav Bharat Society in 1906. Abhinav Bharat&#x27;s main objectives were to overthrow British rule and revive Hindu pride.

===Student activist===

Savarkar continued his political activism as a student at Fergusson College in Pune.
Savarkar was greatly influenced by the radical nationalist leader, Lokmanya Tilak. Tilak was in turn impressed with the young student and helped him obtain the Shivaji Scholarship in 1906 for his law studies in London. To protest against Bengal partition of 1905, Savarkar led foreign-clothes bonfire in India with other students in presence of Bal Gangadhar Tilak.

====London years====
In London, Savarkar got involved with organizations such as India House and the Free India Society. He also published books advocating complete Indian independence by revolutionary means. One of the books he published called &quot;The Indian War of Independence&quot; about the Indian Rebellion of 1857 was banned by the British colonial authorities.

Savarkar was influenced by the life and thinking of Italian nationalist leader, Giuseppe Mazzini. During his stay in London, Savarkar translated Mazzini&#x27;s biography in Marathi. He also influenced thinking of a fellow student called Madanlal Dhingra. In 1909, Dhingra assassinated Curzon Wyllie, a colonial officer. It is alleged by Mark Juergensmeyer that Savarkar supplied the gun which Dhingra used. Juergensmeyer further alleged that Savarkar supplied the words for Dhingra&#x27;s last statement before he went to the gallows for the murder. Savarkar met Mohandas Gandhi for the first time in London shortly after Curzon-Wyllie&#x27;s assassination. During his stay, Gandhi debated Savarkar and other nationalists in London on the futility of fighting the colonial state through acts of terrorism and guerilla warfare.

==== Arrest and transportation to India ====
In India, Ganesh Savarkar organized an armed revolt against the Morley-Minto reforms of 1909, and was sentenced to life imprisonment on the Andaman islands. Around the same time Vinayak Savarkar was accused of participating in a conspiracy to overthrow the British government in India by organizing murders of various officials. Hoping to evade arrest, Savarkar moved to Bhikaiji Cama&#x27;s home in Paris, but against advice from his friends, returned to London. On 13 March 1910, he was arrested in London on multiple charges, including procurement and distribution of arms, waging war against the state, and delivering seditious speeches. At the time of his arrest, he was carrying several revolutionary texts, including copies of his own banned books. In addition, the British government had evidence that he had smuggled 20 Browning handguns into India, one of which Anant Laxman Kanhere used to assassinate the Nasik district&#x27;s collector A.M.T. Jackson in December 1909. During the trial of Nasik Conspiracy Case 1910, government&#x27;s advocate alleged that Savarkar was a moving part and inspiration behind assassination of Jackson. A Bombay court tried him in the Nasik conspiracy case and sentenced him for life-imprisonment and transported him to the notorious Cellular Jail of Andaman Island and forfeited his property.

Although his alleged crimes were committed both in Britain, as well as India, the British authorities decided to try him in India. He was accordingly put on the commercial ship &quot;Morea&quot; with a police escort for his transport to India. When the ship docked in the French Mediterranean port of Marseille, Savarkar escaped by jumping from the ship&#x27;s window, swam to the French shore, and asked for political asylum. The French port officials ignored his pleas, and handed him back to his British captors. When the French government came to know of this incidence, they asked for Savarkar to be brought back to France, and lodged an appeal with the Permanent Court of Arbitration.

==== French Case before the Permanent Court of Arbitration ====

Savarkar&#x27;s arrest at Marseille caused the French government to protest against the British, arguing that the British could not recover Savarkar unless they took appropriate legal proceedings for his rendition. The dispute came before the Permanent Court of International Arbitration in 1910, and it gave its decision in 1911. The case excited much controversy as was reported widely by the French press, and it considered it involved an interesting international question of the right of asylum.

The Court held, firstly, that since there was a pattern of collaboration between the two countries regarding the possibility of Savarkar&#x27;s escape in Marseille and there was neither force nor fraud in inducing the French authorities to return Savarkar to them, the British authorities did not have to hand him back to the French for the latter to hold rendition proceedings. On the other hand, the tribunal also observed that there had been an &quot;irregularity&quot; in Savarkar&#x27;s arrest and delivery over to the Indian Army Military Police guard.

=== Trial and sentence ===
Arriving in Bombay, Savarkar was taken to the Yervada Central Jail in Pune. The trial before the special tribunal was started on 10 September 1910. One of the charges on Savarkar was the abetment to murder of Nasik Collector A. M. T. Jackson. The second was waging a conspiracy under Indian penal code 121-A against the King Emperor. Following the two trials, Savarkar, then aged 28, was convicted and sentenced to 50-years imprisonment and transported on 4 July 1911 to the infamous Cellular Jail in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. He was considered by the British government as a political prisoner.

====Clemency Petitions====

=====1911=====
Savarkar applied to the Bombay Government for certain concessions in connection with his sentences. However, by Government letter No. 2022, dated 4 April 1911, his application was rejected and he was informed that the question of remitting the second sentence of transportation for life would be considered in due course on the expiry of the first sentence of transportation for life. A month after arriving in the Cellular Jail, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Savarkar submitted his first clemency petition on 30 August 1911. This petition was rejected on 3 September 1911.

=====1913=====
Savarkar submitted his next clemency petition on 14 November 1913 and presented it personally to the Home Member of the Governor General&#x27;s council, Sir Reginald Craddock. In his letter, he described himself as a &quot;&quot;prodigal son&quot; longing to return to the &quot;parental doors of the government&quot;&quot;. He wrote that his release from the jail will recast the faith of many Indians in the British rule. Also, he said 

=====1917=====

In 1917, Savarkar submitted another clemency petition, this time for a general amnesty of all political prisoners. Savarkar was informed on 1 February 1918 that the clemency petition was placed before the British colonial government. In December 1919, there was a Royal proclamation by King George V. The Paragraph 6 of this proclamation included a declaration of Royal clemency to political offenders. In view of Royal proclamation, Savarkar submitted his fourth clemency petition to the British colonial government on 30 March 1920, in which he stated that 

This petition was rejected on 12 July 1920 by the British colonial government. After considering the petition, the British colonial government contemplated releasing Ganesh Savarkar but not Vinayak Savarkar. The rationale for doing so was stated as follows

Savarkar signed a statement endorsing his trial, verdict, and British law, and renouncing violence, a bargain for freedom.

=== Ratnagiri years under restricted freedom===
On 2 May 1921, the Savarkar brothers were transferred from Andaman to mainland India with Vinayak being sent to a jail in Ratnagiri, and Ganesh to Bijapur Jail. During his incarceration in Ratnagiri jail in 1922, Vinayak wrote his &quot;Essentials of Hindutva&quot; that formulated his theory of Hindutva. Ganesh (Babarao) Savarkar was unconditionally released from jail in 1922. On 6 January 1924 Vinayak was released, but was restricted to Ratnagiri District. Soon after his release, he started working on the consolidation of Hindu society or Hindu Sangathan. The colonial authorities provided a bungalow for him and he was allowed visitors. During his internment, he met influential people such as Mahatma Gandhi and B. R. Ambedkar. Nathuram Godse, who later assassinated Gandhi, also met Savarkar for the first time as a nineteen-year-old in 1929. Savarkar became a prolific writer during his years of restricted freedom in Ratnagiri. His publishers, however, needed to have a disclaimer that they were wholly divorced from politics. Savarkar remained restricted to Ratnagiri district until 1937. At that time, he was unconditionally released by the newly elected government of Bombay presidency.

=== Leader of the Hindu Mahasabha ===
Savarkar as president of the Hindu Mahasabha, during the Second World War, advanced the slogan &quot;Hinduize all Politics and Militarize Hindudom&quot; and decided to support the British war effort in India seeking military training for the Hindus. When the Congress launched the &quot;Quit India&quot; movement in 1942, Savarkar criticised it and asked Hindus to stay active in the war effort and not disobey the government; he also urged the Hindus to enlist in the armed forces to learn the &quot;arts of war&quot;.

Hindu Mahasabha under Savarkar&#x27;s leadership organized &quot;Hindu Militarization Boards&quot; which recruited armed forces for helping the British in World War 2.

He assailed the British proposals for transfer of power, attacking both the Congress and the British for making concessions to Muslim separatists. Soon after independence, Syama Prasad Mukherjee resigned as vice-president of the Hindu Mahasabha dissociating himself from its &quot;Akhand Hindustan&quot; (&quot;Undivided India&quot;) plank, which implied undoing partition.

==== Opposition to Quit India Movement ====
Under Savarkar, the Hindu Mahasabha openly opposed the call for the Quit India Movement and boycotted it officially. Savarkar even went to the extent of writing a letter titled &quot;Stick to your Posts&quot;, in which he instructed Hindu Sabhaites who happened to be &quot;members of municipalities, local bodies, legislatures or those serving in the army ... to stick to their posts&quot; across the country, and not to join the Quit India Movement at any cost.

==== Alliance with Muslim League and others ====
The Indian National Congress won a massive victory in the 1937 Indian provincial elections, decimating the Muslim League and the Hindu Mahasabha. However, in 1939, the Congress ministries resigned in protest against Viceroy Lord Linlithgow&#x27;s action of declaring India to be a belligerent in the Second World War without consulting the Indian people. This led to the Hindu Mahasabha, under Savarkar&#x27;s presidency, joining hands with the Muslim League and other parties to form governments, in certain provinces. Such coalition governments were formed in Sindh, NWFP, and Bengal.

In Sindh, Hindu Mahasabha members joined Ghulam Hussain Hidayatullah&#x27;s Muslim League government. In Savarkar&#x27;s own words:
In the North West Frontier Province, Hindu Mahasabha members joined hands with Sardar Aurangzeb Khan of the Muslim League to form a government in 1943. The Mahasabha member of the cabinet was Finance Minister Mehar Chand Khanna.

In Bengal, Hindu Mahasabha joined the Krishak Praja Party led Progressive Coalition ministry of Fazlul Haq in December 1941. Savarkar appreciated the successful functioning of the coalition government.

=== Arrest and acquittal in Gandhi&#x27;s assassination ===


Following the assassination of Gandhi on 30 January 1948, police arrested the assassin Nathuram Godse and his alleged accomplices and conspirators. He was a member of the Hindu Mahasabha and of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. Godse was the editor of &quot;Agrani – Hindu Rashtra&quot;, a Marathi daily from Pune which was run by the company &quot;The Hindu Rashtra Prakashan Ltd&quot; (The Hindu Nation Publications). This company had contributions from such eminent persons as Gulabchand Hirachand, Bhalji Pendharkar, and Jugalkishore Birla. Savarkar had invested 15000 in the company. Savarkar, a former president of the Hindu Mahasabha, was arrested on 5 February 1948, from his house in Shivaji Park, and kept under detention in the Arthur Road Prison, Bombay. He was charged with murder, conspiracy to murder, and abetment to murder. A day before his arrest, Savarkar in a public written statement, as reported in &quot;The Times of India&quot;, Bombay dated 7 February 1948, termed Gandhi&#x27;s assassination a fratricidal crime, endangering India&#x27;s existence as a nascent nation. The mass of papers seized from his house had revealed nothing that could remotely be connected with Gandhi&#x27;s murder. Due to lack of evidence, Savarkar was arrested under the Preventive Detention Act.

==== Badge&#x27;s testimony ====
Godse claimed full responsibility for planning and carrying out the assassination. However, according to the Approver Digambar Badge, on 17 January 1948, Nathuram Godse went to have a last &quot;darshan&quot; (audience/interview) with Savarkar in Bombay before the assassination. While Badge and Shankar waited outside, Nathuram and Apte went in. On coming out Apte told Badge that Savarkar blessed them &quot;&quot;Yashasvi houn ya&quot; (&quot;यशस्वी होऊन या&quot;&quot;, be successful and return). Apte also said that Savarkar predicted that Gandhi&#x27;s 100 years were over and there was no doubt that the task would be successfully finished. However Badge&#x27;s testimony was not accepted as the approver&#x27;s evidence lacked independent corroboration and hence Savarkar was acquitted.

In the last week of August 1974, Mr. Manohar Malgonkar saw Digamber Badge several times and in particular, questioned him about the veracity of his testimony against Savarkar. Badge insisted to Mr. Manohar Malgonkar that &quot;even though he had blurted out the full story of the plot as far as he knew, without much persuasion, he had put up a valiant struggle against being made to testify against Savarkar&quot;. In the end, Badge gave in. He agreed to say on oath that he saw Nathuram Godse and Apte with Savarkar and that Savarkar, within Badge&#x27;s hearing, had blessed their venture.

==== Kapur commission ====

On 12 November 1964, at a religious program organized in Pune to celebrate the release of Gopal Godse, Madanlal Pahwa and Vishnu Karkare from jail after the expiry of their sentences, G. V. Ketkar, grandson of Bal Gangadhar Tilak, former editor of Kesari and then editor of &quot;Tarun Bharat&quot;, who presided over the function, gave information of a conspiracy to kill Gandhi, about which he professed knowledge six months before the act. Ketkar was arrested. A public furor ensued both outside and inside the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly and both houses of the Indian parliament. Under the pressure of 29 members of parliament and public opinion the then Union home minister Gulzarilal Nanda appointed Gopal Swarup Pathak, M. P. and a senior advocate of the Supreme Court of India as a Commission of Inquiry to re-investigate the conspiracy to murder Gandhi. The central government intended on conducting a thorough inquiry with the help of old records in consultation with the government of Maharashtra. Pathak was given three months to conduct his inquiry; subsequently, Jevanlal Kapur, a retired judge of the Supreme Court of India, was appointed chairman of the commission.

The commission&#x27;s reinvestigation saw Savarkar&#x27;s secretary and bodyguard to have testified that Savarkar met with Godse and Apte right before Gandhi was killed.

The commission was provided with evidence not produced in the court; especially the testimony of two of Savarkar&#x27;s close aides – Appa Ramachandra Kasar, his bodyguard, and Gajanan Vishnu Damle, his secretary. The testimony of Mr. Kasar and Mr. Damle was already recorded by Bombay police on 4 March 1948, but apparently, these testimonies were not presented before the court during the trial. In these testimonies, it is said that Godse and Apte visited Savarkar on or about 23 or 24 January, which was when they returned from Delhi after the bomb incident. Damle deposed that Godse and Apte saw Savarkar in the middle of January and sat with him (Savarkar) in his garden. The C. I. D. Bombay was keeping vigil on Savarkar from 21 to 30 January 1948. The crime report from C. I. D. does not mention Godse or Apte meeting Savarkar during this time.

Justice Kapur concluded: &quot;All these facts taken together were destructive of any theory other than the conspiracy to murder by Savarkar and his group.&quot;

The arrest of Savarkar was mainly based on approver Digambar Badge&#x27;s testimony. The commission did not re-interview Digambar Badge. At the time of inquiry of the commission, Badge was alive and working in Bombay.

=== Later years ===
After Gandhi&#x27;s assassination, Savarkar&#x27;s home in Dadar, Bombay was stoned by angry mobs. After he was acquitted of the allegations related to Gandhi&#x27;s assassination and released from jail, Savarkar was arrested by the government for making &quot;Hindu nationalist speeches&quot;; he was released after agreeing to give up political activities. He continued addressing the social and cultural elements of Hindutva. He resumed political activism after the ban on it was lifted; it was however limited until his death in 1966 because of ill health.

In 1956, he opposed B. R. Ambedkar&#x27;s conversion to Buddhism calling it a &quot;useless act&quot;, to which Ambedkar responded by publicly questioning the use of epithet ‘&quot;Veer&quot;’ (meaning &quot;brave&quot;) by Savarkar.

On 22 November 1957, Raja Mahendra Pratap moved a bill in Lok Sabha to recognise the service to the country of people like Vir Savarkar, Barindra Kumar Ghosh and Bhupendranath Datta. But the bill was defeated with 48 votes favouring it and 75 against it. This bill was also supported by communist leader like A. K. Gopalan.

=== Death ===
On 8 November 1963, Savarkar&#x27;s wife, Yamunabai, died. On 1 February 1966, Savarkar renounced medicines, food, and water which was termed as &quot;prayopavesha&quot; (fast until death). Before his death, he had written an article titled &quot;Atmahatya Nahi Atmaarpan&quot; in which he argued that when one&#x27;s life mission is over and the ability to serve society is left no more, it is better to end the life at will rather than waiting for death. His condition was described to have become as &quot;extremely serious&quot; before his death on 26 February 1966 at his residence in Bombay (now Mumbai), and that he faced difficulty in breathing; efforts to revive him failed, and was declared dead at 11:10 a.m. (IST) that day. Prior to his death, Savarkar had asked his relatives to perform only his funeral and do away with the rituals of the 10th and 13th day of the Hindu faith. Accordingly, his last rites were performed at an electric crematorium in Bombay&#x27;s Sonapur locality by his son Vishwas the following day.

There was no official mourning by the Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee or the central government in Delhi during the time of his death. Not a single minister from the Maharashtra Cabinet showed up to pay homage and respect to Savarkar. The political indifference to Savarkar has also continued after his death. After the death of Nehru, the Congress government, under Prime Minister Shastri, started to pay him a monthly pension.

== Religious and political views ==

=== Hindutva ===
In contrast with Dayananda Saraswati, Swami Vivekananda and Sri Aurobindo, who were &quot;men of religion&quot; who introduced reforms in the society and put Hinduism in front of the world, Savarkar mixed politics and religion and started an extreme form of Hindu nationalism.

During his incarceration, Savarkar&#x27;s views began turning increasingly towards Hindu cultural and political nationalism, and the next phase of his life remained dedicated to this cause. In the brief period he spent at the Ratnagiri jail, Savarkar published his ideological treatise – &quot;&quot; in 1923. In this work, Savarkar promotes a farsighted new vision of Hindu social and political consciousness. Savarkar began describing a &quot;Hindu&quot; as a patriotic inhabitant of Bharatavarsha, venturing beyond a religious identity. While emphasising the need for patriotic and social unity of all Hindu communities, he described Hinduism, Jainism, Sikhism and Buddhism as one and the same. He outlined his vision of a &quot;Hindu Rashtra&quot; (&quot;Hindu Nation&quot;) as &quot;Akhand Bharat&quot; (&quot;United India&quot;), purportedly stretching across the entire Indian subcontinent. He defined Hindus as being neither Aryan nor Dravidian but as &quot;People who live as children of a common motherland, adoring a common holyland.&quot;

According to Sharma, Savarkar&#x27;s celebration and justification of violence against [British] women and children in his description of the Mutiny of 1857, &quot;transformed Hindutva into the very image of Islam that he defined and found so intolerably objectionable&quot;.

Scholars, historians and Indian politicians have been divided in their interpretation of Savarkar&#x27;s ideas. A self-described atheist, Savarkar regards being Hindu as a cultural and political identity. He often stressed social and community unity between Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists and Jains, to the exclusion of Muslims and Christians. Savarkar saw Muslims and Christians as &quot;misfits&quot; in the Indian civilization who could not truly be a part of the nation. He argued that the holiest sites of Islam and Christianity are in the Middle East and not India, hence the loyalty of Muslims and Christians to India is divided.

After his release from jail on 6 January 1924, Savarkar helped found the Ratnagiri Hindu Sabha organisation, aiming to work for the social and cultural preservation of Hindu heritage and civilisation.

Focusing his energies on writing, Savarkar authored the &quot;Hindu Pad-pada-shahi&quot; – a book documenting the Maratha empire – and &quot;My Transportation for Life&quot; – an account of his early revolutionary days, arrest, trial and incarceration. He also wrote and published a collection of poems, plays and novels. He also wrote a book named &quot;Majhi Janmathep&quot; (&quot;My Life-term&quot;) about his experience in Andaman prison.

=== Hindu orthodoxy ===
He was an ardent critique of a number of Hindu religious practices he saw as irrational and viewed them as a hindrance to the material progress of the Hindus. He believed that religion is an unimportant aspect of &quot;Hindu identity&quot;.

He was opposed to the caste system and in his 1931 essay titled &quot;Seven Shackles of the Hindu Society,&quot; he wrote &quot;One of the most important components of such injunctions of the past that we have blindly carried on and which deserves to be thrown in the dustbins of history is the rigid caste system&quot;.

However, in 1939, Savarkar assured that his party Hindu Mahasabha won&#x27;t necessarily support entry of the untouchables into temples. Savarkar said, &quot;Thus the Party will not introduce or support compulsory Legislature regarding Temple Entry by the untouchables etc. in old temples beyond the limit to which the non-Hindus are allowed by custom as in force today.&quot;
=== Constitution of India ===
 Savarkar in his book, &quot;Women in Manusmriti&quot;, he wrote: &quot;The worst about the new constitution of Bharat is that there is nothing Bharatiya (Indian) about it. Manusmriti is that scripture which is most worship-able after Vedas for our Hindu Nation and which from ancient times has become the basis of our culture-customs, thought and practice. This book for centuries has codified the spiritual and divine march of our nation. Even today the rules which are followed by crores of Hindus in their lives and practice are based on Manusmriti.&quot; B. R. Ambedkar, Chairman of the committee that drafted the Constitution of India, criticized Manusmriti as responsible for caste system in India.

=== Fascism ===
In a speech before a 20,000 strong audience at Pune on 1 August 1938, Savarkar stood by Nazi Germany&#x27;s right to Nazism and Italy&#x27;s to Fascism; their achievement of unprecedent glory in the world-stage and a successful inculcation of national solidarity justified those choices. Savarkar criticized Nehru for denouncing Germany and Italy, proclaiming that &quot;crores of Hindu Sanghatanists in India [..] cherish[ed] no ill-will towards Germany or Italy or Imperial Japan.&quot; He proclaimed his support for the German occupation of Czechoslovakia in the same breath.

As World War II become imminent, Savarkar had initially advocated a policy of neutralism centered on India&#x27;s geostrategic equations but his rhetoric grew coarser with time and he expressed consistent support for Hitler&#x27;s policy about Jews. In a speech on 14 October, it was suggested that Hitler&#x27;s ways be adopted for dealing with Indian Muslims. On 11 December, he characterized the Jews as a communal force. Next March, Savarkar would welcome Germany&#x27;s revival of Aryan culture, their glorification of Swastika, and the &quot;crusade&quot; against Aryan enemies — it was hoped that German victory would finally invigorate the Hindus of India.

On 5 August 1939, Savarkar highlighted how a common strand of &quot;thought, religion, language, and culture&quot; was essential to nationality thus preventing the Germans and Jews from being considerable as one nation. By the year end, he was directly equating the Muslims of India with German Jews — in the words of Chetan Bhatt, both were suspected of harboring extra-national loyalties and became illegitimate presences in an organic nation. These speeches circulated in German newspapers with Nazi Germany even allotting a point-of-contact person for engaging with Savarkar, who was making sincere efforts to forge a working relationship with the Nazis. Eventually, Savarkar would be gifted with a copy of Mein Kampf.

=== Nazis and Jews ===

Savarkar supported Hitler&#x27;s anti-Jewish policy. In 1939, he deemed that &quot;Germans and the Jews could not be regarded as a nation&quot;. In the same year, he compared Indian Muslims with the Jews of Germany by saying &quot;Indian Muslims are on the whole more inclined to identify themselves and their interests with Muslims outside India than Hindus who live next door, like Jews in Germany&quot;.

In 1941, Savarkar supported Jews resettling their fatherland of Israel, in what he believed would defend the world against Islamic aggression. In his letter dated December 19, 1947, Savarkar celebrated &quot;the establishment of the independent Jewish State in Palestine on moral as well as political grounds&quot; while adding that &quot;the Jewish people bear no political ill-will towards Hindudom&quot;.

It remains unknown whether Savarkar withdrew his support for Nazi Germany after the Holocaust became common knowledge. However, on 15 January 1961 he had spoken favorably of Hitler&#x27;s Nazism against Nehru&#x27;s &quot;cowardly democracy&quot;.

=== Two-nation theory ===

In his earlier writings, Savarkar argued for &quot;Indian independence from British rule&quot;, whereas in later writings he focused on &quot;Hindu independence from Christians and Muslims&quot;. In his 1909 book &quot;The Indian War of Independence&quot;, Savarkar emphasizes Hindu-Muslim unity, stating that they worked together for &quot;freeing their country&quot; during the 1857 uprising. In his introduction to the book, Savarkar states that the feeling of hatred against the Muslims was necessary during Shivaji&#x27;s period, but it would be &quot;unjust and foolish&quot; to nurse such hatred now.

By 1923, when his &quot;Essentials of Hindutva&quot; was published, Savarkar no longer emphasized the Hindu-Muslim unity, and primarily focused on &quot;Hindus&quot; rather than &quot;Indians&quot;. His writings on Hindutva emerged immediately after he was moved from the Cellular Jail to a prison in Ratnagiri in 1921, and therefore, later scholars have speculated if his stay in these prisons contributed to a change in his views. These scholars point to Savarkar&#x27;s claims that the Muslim warders at the Cellular Jail treated the Muslim prisoners favourably, while mistreating Hindus; the pan-Islamic Khilafat Movement may have also influenced his views about Muslims while he stayed at Ratnagiri during 1921–1923. According to Bhai Parmanand, his fellow prisoner at the Cellular Jail during 1915–1920, Savarkar had already formed his ideas about Hindutva before they met.

Savarkar in 1937 during the 19th session of the Hindu Mahasabha in Ahmedabad supported two-nation theory. He said:

In the 1940s, the two-nation theory was supported by Muhammad Ali Jinnah and Savarkar. Savarkar declared on August 15, 1943, in Nagpur:

Savarkar not only talked of Hindudom, Hindu Nation and Hindu Raj, but he wanted to depend upon the Sikhs in the Punjab to establish a Sikhistan. Savarkar assured the Sikhs that &quot;when the Muslims woke from their day-dreams of Pakistan, they would see established instead a Sikhistan in the Punjab.&quot; Savarkar further instigated the Sikhs by claiming that Sikhs previously occupied Afghanistan when they were not many and now there are millions of Sikhs.

===Muslims===

Since his time in jail, Savarkar was known for his anti-Muslim writings. Historians including Rachel McDermott, Leonard A. Gordon, Ainslie Embree, Frances Pritchett and Dennis Dalton state that Savarkar promoted an anti-Muslim form of Hindu nationalism.

Savarkar saw Muslims in the Indian police and military to be &quot;potential traitors&quot;. He advocated that India reduce the number of Muslims in the military, police and public service and ban Muslims from owning or working in munitions factories. Savarkar criticized Gandhi for being concerned about Indian Muslims.

In his 1963 book &quot;Six Glorious Epochs of Indian History&quot;, Savarkar says Muslims and Christians wanted to &quot;destroy&quot; Hinduism.

=== Women ===

Historian Vinayak Chaturvedi writes that in a 1937 speech Savarkar said that &quot;Kitchen and children were the main duties of women&quot; and suggested that they have healthy children. Unlike Tilak who said that women should not be allowed education at all as reading may make them &quot;immoral&quot; and &quot;insubordinate&quot;, Savarkar held a less extreme view. Savarkar did not oppose education of women but suggested that the education focus on how they could be good mothers and create a generation of patriotic children. In an essay, &quot;Women&#x27;s beauty and duty&quot;, he stated that a woman&#x27;s main duty was to her children, her home and her country. As per Savarkar, any woman digressing from her domestic duties was &quot;morally guilty of breach of trust&quot;.

In his 1963 book &quot;Six Glorious Epochs of Indian History&quot;, Savarkar advocated use of rape as political tool. He accused Muslim women of actively supporting Muslim men&#x27;s atrocities against Hindu women, Savarkar wrote that young and beautiful Muslim girls should be captured, converted and presented to Maratha warriors to reward them, stating that the Muslim ruler Tipu Sultan had similarly distributed Hindu girls among his warriors. He further wrote:
As per Sharma, based on Swami Ramdas&#x27;s teaching, &quot;Savarkar justifies the killing of countless British women and children&quot; in 1857. Sharma has translated some passages from &quot;Savarkar Samgraha&quot; which is originally in Savarkar&#x27;s native language into English to give examples.

In Jhansi, 12 women along with 23 children and 75 men were killed. Savarkar calls this killing of the British whites as a &quot;Bali&quot; or &quot;Holy Sacrifice&quot;.

On page 202 of Volume 5, &quot;Savarkar Samgraha&quot;, in his native language, Savarkar writes (translated by Sharma):

When some men, women and children were killed in the Ganga river, Savarkar describes this as a &quot;celebration&quot; of the anniversary of plassey on page 196. In Kanpur, when 150 children and women were killed he quotes unemotionally as per Sharma in his native language that &quot;the butchers entered Bibigarh ..and sea of white blood spread all over&quot;. In another incident on May 16, Savarkar describes the fate of English women and children as follows:
== Legacy ==
He is known among followers by the honorific prefix &quot;Veer&quot; meaning &quot;brave&quot;. The airport at Port Blair, Andaman and Nicobar&#x27;s capital was renamed Veer Savarkar International Airport in 2002. One of the commemorative blue plaques affixed on India House fixed by the Historic Building and Monuments Commission for England reads &quot;Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, 1883–1966, Indian patriot and philosopher lived here&quot;.

* A commemorative postage stamp was released by government of India in 1970.
* A portrait of Savarkar was unveiled in the Indian Parliament in 2003.
* The Shiv Sena party has demanded that the Indian Government posthumously confer upon him India&#x27;s highest civilian award, the Bharat Ratna. Uddhav Thackeray, Shiv Sena chief, while reiterating this demand for Bharat Ratna in 2017, has also suggested that a replica of the prison cell where Savarkar was imprisoned should be built in Mumbai and the youth should be educated about Savarkar&#x27;s contribution towards the &#x27;Hindu Rashtra&#x27; and the Indian freedom struggle.

In 1926, two years after the release of Savarkar from the prison, a biography titled &quot;Life of Barrister Savarkar&quot; and authored by a certain &quot;Chitragupta&quot; was published. A revised version was published in 1939 with additions by Indra Prakash of the Hindu Mahasabha. A second edition of the book was published in 1987 by Veer Savarkar Prakashan, the official publisher of writings by Savarkar. In its preface, Ravindra Vaman Ramdas deduced that, &quot;Chitragupta is none other than Veer Savarkar&quot;.

=== In popular culture ===

* In the 1996 Malayalam movie &quot;Kaalapani&quot; directed by Priyadarshan, the Hindi actor Annu Kapoor played the role of Savarkar.
* The Marathi and Hindi music director and Savarkar follower, Sudhir Phadke, and Ved Rahi made the biopic film &quot;Veer Savarkar&quot;, which was released in 2001 after many years in production. Savarkar is portrayed by Shailendra Gaur.
* The 2015 Indian Marathi-language film &quot;What About Savarkar?&quot;, directed by Rupesh Katare and Nitin Gawde, depicted the journey of a man&#x27;s revenge against those who have disrespect Savarkar&#x27;s name.
* The 2024 Indian Hindi-language film Swatantrya Veer Savarkar directed, co-written, co-produced and acted by Randeep Hooda depicted the life journey of Savarkar.

==Books==
He wrote 38 books in English and Marathi, consisting in many essays, two novels called &quot;Moplah Rebellion&quot; and &quot;the Transportation&quot;, poetry and plays, the best-known of his books being his historical study &quot;The Indian war of independence, 1857&quot; and his pamphlet &quot;&quot;.

<text>Violeta del Carmen Parra Sandoval (; 4 October 1917 – 5 February 1967) was a Chilean composer, singer-songwriter, folklorist, ethnomusicologist and visual artist. She pioneered the Nueva Canción Chilena (The Chilean New Song), a renewal and a reinvention of Chilean folk music that would extend its sphere of influence outside Chile.

Her birthdate (4 October) was chosen &quot;Chilean Musicians&#x27; Day&quot;. In 2011, Andrés Wood directed a biopic about her, titled &quot;Violeta Went to Heaven&quot; (Spanish: &quot;Violeta se fue a los cielos&quot;).

==Early life==
There is some uncertainty as to exactly where Violeta Parra was born. The stamp on her birth certificate says she was born in San Carlos, Ñuble Province, a small town in southern Chile on 4 October 1917, as Violeta del Carmen Parra Sandoval. However, both the Violeta Parra Foundation (Fundación Violeta Parra) and the Violeta Parra Museum (Museo Violeta Parra) state on their websites that she was born in San Fabián de Alico, 40 km from San Carlos.

Violeta Parra was one of nine children in the prolific Parra family. Her father, Nicanor Parra Alarcón, was a music teacher. Her mother, Clarisa Sandoval Navarrete had grown up in the countryside and was a seamstress. She sang and played the guitar, and taught Violeta and her siblings traditional folk songs. Among her brothers were the notable modern poet, better known as the &quot;anti-poet&quot;, Nicanor Parra (1914–2018), and fellow folklorist Roberto Parra (1921–1995). Her son, Ángel Parra, and her daughter, Isabel Parra, are also important figures in the development of the &quot;Nueva Canción Chilena&quot;. Their children have also mostly maintained the family&#x27;s artistic traditions.

Violeta Parra and some of her siblings would perform in Chillán and local towns to help support their family. Her father&#x27;s lack of success in his own music career led to alcoholism. Two years after Violeta&#x27;s birth, the family moved to Santiago, then, two years later, to Lautaro and, finally, in 1927, to Chillán. It was in Chillán that Violeta started singing and playing the guitar, together with her siblings Hilda, Eduardo and Roberto; and soon began composing traditional Chilean music.

Parra&#x27;s father died in 1929 from tuberculosis, and her family&#x27;s quality of life greatly deteriorated. Violeta and her siblings had to work to help feed the family.

In 1932, at the insistence of her brother Nicanor, Parra moved to Santiago to attend the Normal School, staying with relatives. Later, she moved back with her mother and siblings to Edison Street, in the Quinta Normal district.

== Musical career ==
In the beginning of her career, there was a greater interest in Eurocentric music by the vast majority of the population in Chile.

The Parras performed in nightclubs, such as El Tordo Azul and El Popular, in the Mapocho district, interpreting boleros, rancheras, Mexican corridos and other styles.

Parra took a break from her musical career in 1938 to start a family. In 1944, Parra started to perform again under the name &quot;Violeta de Mayo&quot; (Violeta of May or May Violet). Parra began singing songs of Spanish origin, from the repertoire of the famous Argentinian singers Lolita Torres and Imperio Argentina. She sang in restaurants and, also, in theatres. In 1945, she appeared with her children Isabel and Angel in a Spanish show in the Casanova confectionery.

Parra and her sister Hilda began singing together as &quot;The Parra Sisters&quot;, and they recorded some of their work on RCA VICTOR. Parra continued performing: she appeared in circuses and toured, with Hilda and with her children, throughout Argentina.

=== The folklorist ===
In 1952, encouraged by her brother Nicanor, Violeta began to collect and collate authentic Chilean folk music from all over the country. She abandoned her old folk-song repertoire, and began composing her own songs based on traditional folk forms. She gave recitals at universities, presented by the well-known literary figure Enrique Bello Cruz, founder of several cultural magazines. Soon, Parra was invited to the &quot;Summer School&quot; at the University of Concepción. She was also invited to teach courses in folklore at the University of Iquique. In Valparaiso, she was presented at the Chilean-French Institute.

Parra&#x27;s two singles for EMI Odeon label: &quot;Que Pena Siente el Alma&quot; and &quot;Verso por el Fin del Mundo&quot;, and &quot;Casamiento de Negros&quot; and &quot;Verso por Padecimiento&quot; brought her a good measure of popularity.

Don Isaiah Angulo, a tenant farmer, taught her to play the guitarrón, a traditional Chilean guitar-like instrument with 25 strings.

Along the way, Parra met Pablo Neruda, who introduced her to his friends. In 1970, he would dedicate the poem &quot;Elegia para Cantar&quot; to her.

Between January and September 1954, Parra hosted the immensely successful radio program &quot;Sing Violeta Parra&quot; for Radio Chilena. The program was most often recorded in places where folk music was performed, such as her mother&#x27;s restaurant in Barrancas. At the end of 1954, Parra participated in another folkloric program, for Radio Agriculture.

===First trip to Europe===
Violeta was invited to the World Festival of Youth and Students, in Warsaw, Poland, in July 1955.
She then moved to Paris, France, where she performed at the nightclub &quot;L&#x27;Escale&quot; in the Quartier Latin.

Violeta made contacts with European artists and intellectuals. Through the intervention of the anthropologist Paul Rivet, she recorded at the National Sound Archive of the &quot;Musée de l&#x27;Homme&quot; La Sorbonne in Paris, where she left a guitarrón and tapes of her collections of Chilean folklore. She travelled to London to make recordings for EMI-Odeon and radio broadcasts from the BBC. Back in Paris, in March 1956, she recorded 16 songs for the French label &quot;Chant du Monde&quot; which launched its first two records with 8 songs each.

=== Return to Chile ===
In November 1957, Violeta returned to Chile and recorded the first LP of the series &quot;The Folklore of Chile&quot; for the EMI Odeon label, &quot;Violeta Parra and her Guitar&quot; (&quot;Canto y Guitarra&quot;), which included three of her own compositions. She followed with the second volume of &quot;The Folklore of Chile&quot; in 1958, &quot;Acompañada de Guitarra&quot;. In 1959, she released &quot;La cueca&quot; and &quot;La tonada&quot;. The following year, she founded the National Museum of Folkloric Art (Museo Nacional de Arte Folklórico) in Concepción, under the University of Concepción (Universidad de Concepción). During this time, she composed many décimas, a Latin American poetry form for which she is well known.

In the following years, she built her house &quot;Casa de Palos&quot; on Segovia Street, in the municipality of La Reina. She continued giving recitals in major cultural centers in Santiago, travelling all over the country to research, organize concerts, and give lectures and workshops about folklore. She travelled north to investigate and record the religious festival &quot;La Tirana&quot;.

Violeta Parra exerted a significant influence on Héctor Pavez and Gabriela Pizarro, who would become great performers and researchers in their own right. The product of this collaboration is evident in the play &quot;La Celebración de la Minga&quot; staged at the Teatro Municipal de Santiago.

She composed the music for the documentaries &quot;Wicker&quot; and &quot;Trilla&quot;, and contributed to the film &quot;Casamiento de negros&quot;, performed by Sergio Bravo.

She wrote the book &quot;Cantos Folklóricos Chilenos&quot;, which gathered all the research conducted so far, with photographs by Sergio Larraín and musical scores performed by Gastón Soublette (Santiago, Nascimento, 1979).
She also wrote the &quot;Décimas autobiográficas&quot;, work in verse recounting her from her childhood to her trip to Europe.

On 4 October 1960, the day of her birthday, she met Swiss clarinetist Gilbert Favre with whom she became romantically involved. In 1961, she traveled to Buenos Aires, Argentina, where she exhibited her paintings, appeared on TV, gave recitals at the Teatro IFT, and recorded an album of original songs for EMI Odeon – which was banned.

===Second trip to Europe===
In June 1962 she returned to Santiago. With her children Isabel and Angel, and her granddaughter Tita, she embarked, with the Chilean delegation, for Finland to participate in the 8th &quot;World Festival of Youth and Students&quot; held in Helsinki. After touring the Soviet Union, Germany, Italy and France, Violeta Parra moved to Paris, where she performed at La Candelaria and L&#x27;Escale, in the Latin Quarter, gave recitals at the &quot;Théâtre Des Nations&quot; of UNESCO and performed on radio and television with her children.

She then started living with Gilbert Favre in Geneva, dividing her time between France and Switzerland, where she also gave concerts, appeared in TV and exhibited her art.

In 1963, she recorded in Paris revolutionary and peasant songs, which would be published in 1971 under the title &quot;Songs rediscovered in Paris&quot;.
She wrote the book &quot;Popular Poetry of the Andes&quot;.
The Parras took part in the concert of &quot;L&#x27;Humanité&quot; (official newspaper of the French Communist Party). An Argentine musician friend recorded at her home a version of &quot;El Gavilán&quot; (&quot;The Hawk&quot;), interpreted by Violeta Parra accompanied by her granddaughter on percussion.
Violeta accompanied her children in the LP &quot;Los Parra de Chillán&quot; for the Barclay label.
She began playing the cuatro, an instrument of Venezuelan origin, and the charango, an instrument of Bolivian origin.

===Return to South America===
Parra returned to South America with Gilbert Favre, in June 1965. Violeta recorded two 45s, one with her daughter Isabel and another to instrumental music for cuatro and quena with Gilbert Favre, whom she christened &quot;El Tocador Afuerino&quot; (The outsider musician). Her music now incorporated the Venezuelan cuatro and the Bolivian charango. EMI Odeon circulated the LP &quot;Remembering Chile (a Chilean in Paris)&quot;, whose cover was illustrated with her own arpilleras. Soon after, however, Favre and Parra separated, provoked by his desire to live in Bolivia where he was part of a successful Bolivian music act, Los Jairas.

Parra&#x27;s energy was invested in reviving a version of the Peña (now known as &quot;La Peña de Los Parra&quot;), a community center for the arts and for political activism. Parra&#x27;s Peña was a tent (somewhat similar looking to a circus tent) that she set up on a 30 x 30-meter piece of land in the Parque La Quintrala, at number 340 Carmen Street, in today&#x27;s La Reina municipality of Santiago, in the area once known as la Cañada. Her tent hosted musical spectacles where she often sang with her children, and she and her children also lived on the same land. In La Reina, at La Cañada 7200, she also established a cultural center called &quot;La Carpa de la Reina&quot; inaugurated on 17 December 1965. She also installed a folk peña in the International Fair of Santiago (FISA), where she was invited. On the same year, she participated in numerous national television programs and signed a contract with Radio Minería which would be the last radio station to be used as a platform for her work.

Under the EMI Odeón label, she released the LP &quot;La Carpa de La Reina&quot; in 1966, featuring three songs performed by Violeta Parra and nine by guest artists announced at the carpa by Violeta herself. She travelled to La Paz to meet with Gilbert Favre, where she regularly appeared in the Peña Naira. She came back to Chile with Altiplano groups, presenting them in her carpa, on television, and in her children&#x27;s Peña. She also performed in concert at the Chilean southern cities of Osorno and Punta Arenas, invited by René Largo Farias, under the &quot;Chile Ríe y Canta&quot; (&quot;Chile Laughs and Sings&quot;) program. Accompanied by her children and Uruguayan Alberto Zapicán, she recorded for RCA Victor the LP &quot;The Last Compositions of Violeta Parra&quot;. In that year, Favre returned briefly to Chile with his group, but declined to stay, because in the meantime he had married in Bolivia.

=== Music ===

===&quot;Gracias a la vida&quot;===

Parra composed &quot;Gracias a la vida&quot; in La Paz, Bolivia in 1966. In 1971 the song was popularized throughout Latin America by Mercedes Sosa, and later in Brazil by Elis Regina and in the US by Joan Baez. It remains one of the most covered Latin American songs in history. Other covers of the folk anthem include the Italian guitar-vocal solo of Adriana Mezzadri and La Oreja de Van Gogh at the 2005 Viña del Mar International Song Festival. It has been treated by classically trained musicians such as in the fully orchestrated rendition by conservatory-trained Alberto Cortez. The song was re-recorded by several Latin artists, Canadian Michael Bublé to gather funds for the Chilean people affected by the earthquake in Chile, February 2010, and American singer-songwriter Kacey Musgraves from her fifth studio album Star-Crossed.

It opens with a very common shift between A minor and E major chords, then it goes to G7-C/C7 before returning to the Am/E motif. &quot;Gracias a la vida&quot; was written and recorded in 1964–65, following Parra&#x27;s separation from her long-term partner. It was released in &quot;Las Últimas Composiciones&quot; (1966), the last album Parra published before taking her life in 1967.

Parra&#x27;s lyrics are ambiguous at first: the song may be read as a romantic celebration of life and individual experience, but the circumstances surrounding the song suggest that Parra also intended the song as a sort of suicide note, thanking life for all it has given her. It may be read as ironic, pointing out that a life full of good health, opportunity and worldly experience may not offer any consolation to grief and the contradictory nature of the human condition.
:&quot;Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto&quot;
:&quot;Me dio dos luceros que cuando los abro&quot;
:&quot;Perfecto distingo lo negro del blanco&quot;
:&quot;Y en el alto cielo su fondo estrellado&quot;
:&quot;Y en las multitudes el hombre que yo amo&quot;
Translated into English:
:&quot;Thanks to life, which has given me so much&quot;
:&quot;It gave me two bright stars that when I open them,&quot;
:&quot;I perfectly distinguish the black from white&quot;
:&quot;And in the sky above, her starry backdrop&quot;
:&quot;And within the multitudes the man I love&quot;

===&quot;Volver a los Diecisiete&quot;===
Another highly regarded song – the last she wrote – is &quot;Volver a los Diecisiete&quot; (&quot;Being Seventeen Again&quot;). It celebrates the themes of youthful life, in tragic contrast to her biography. Unlike much popular music, it moves through minor key progression creating an introspective if not melancholy mood and thus has lent itself to classical treatment as well as popular music.

Parra&#x27;s music is deeply rooted in folk song traditions, as she was considered part of the Nueva Canción movement. Her involvement was as a forerunner in the 1950s and increasing the popularity of folk music.

== Artistic career ==
During Parra&#x27;s travels collecting musical traditions, she also collected artistic practices. She developed a serious interest in ceramics, painting and arpillera embroidery. As a result of severe hepatitis in 1959 that forced her to stay in bed, her work as a painter and arpillerista was developed greatly, so much so that that same year, she exhibited her oil paintings and arpilleras at both the First and Second Outdoor Exhibition of Fine Arts in Santiago&#x27;s Parque Forestal.

In April 1964 she did an exhibition of her arpilleras, oil paintings and wire sculptures in the Museum of Decorative Arts of the Louvre – the first solo exhibition of a Latin American artist at the museum.
In 1965, the publisher François Maspero, Paris, published her book &quot;Poésie Populaire des Andes&quot;.
In Geneva, Swiss television made a documentary about the artist and her work, &quot;Violeta Parra, Chilean Embroiderer&quot;.

Many of her art works center around folk tales and the oral histories she collected in her efforts to preserve them. These include her paintings, &quot;Las tres pascualas, Casamiento de negros,&quot; and &quot;Machitún.&quot; Each of these paintings are inspired by Chilean folk tales and all are oil paint on wood. Her painting style is simplistic; Parra avoided realism to allow the stories, themes, and context of the paintings to come through without distractions.

== Personal life ==
In 1934, she met Luis Cereceda, a railway driver. They got married in 1938, and Parra took time away from her musical career to start a family. They had two children, Isabel (born 1939) and Ángel (born 1943). Her husband was an avid supporter of the Chilean Communist Party. They both became involved in the progressive movement and the Communist Party of Chile, taking part in the presidential campaign of Gabriel González Videla in 1944. They also supported the first-left wing president in Chilean history, Pedro Aguirre Cerda&#x27;s political campaign.

After 10 years of marriage, in 1948, Parra and Luis Cerceda separated. Parra then met and married Luis Arce in 1949, and their daughter, Carmen Luisa, was born the same year. Their second child, Rosita Clara was born in 1952, but later died in 1955 while Parra was in Europe.

== Death and legacy ==
In 1967 Parra died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Several memorials were held after her death, both in Chile and abroad. She was an inspiration for several Latin-American artists, such as Victor Jara and the musical movement of the &quot;Nueva Cancion Chilena&quot;, which renewed interest in Chilean folklore.

In 1992, the Violeta Parra Foundation was founded at the initiative of her children, with the aim to group, organize and disseminate her still-unpublished work. Rodolfo Braceli&#x27;s book &quot;Y Ahora, la Resucitada de la Violenta Violeta&quot; was adapted into a play called &quot;Violeta Viene a Nacer&quot;, starring Argentinian actress Virginia Lago in 1993 and 1994. In 1997, with the participation of Violeta Parra Foundation and the Department of Cultural Affairs, Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Chile, her visual work was exhibited in the Museum of Decorative Arts of the Louvre Museum, Paris.

In 2007, the 90th anniversary of her birth was commemorated with an exhibition of her visual work at the Centro Cultural Palacio La Moneda and the release of a collection of her art work titled, &quot;Visual Work of Violeta Parra&quot;. 4 October 2015 marked the inauguration of the Violeta Parra Museum (Museo Violeta Parra) in Santiago, Chile. On 4 October 2017, Google celebrated her 100th birthday with a Google Doodle.

== Film ==
&quot;Violeta Went to Heaven&quot; (Spanish: &quot;Violeta se fue a los cielos&quot;) is a 2011 Chilean biopic about Parra, directed by Andrés Wood. The film is based on a biography of the same name, written by Ángel Parra, Violeta&#x27;s son with Luis Cereceda Arenas. Parra collaborated on the film.
The film was selected as the Chilean entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 84th Academy Awards, but it did not make the final shortlist.
The film won Sundance&#x27;s 2012 World Cinema Dramatic Jury Prize.

<text>Phelsuma v-nigra v-nigra (syn. &quot;Phelsuma v-nigra&quot; ) is a small diurnal subspecies of geckos. It lives in the Comoros and typically inhabits trees and bushes. &quot;Phelsuma v-nigra v-nigra&quot; feeds on insects and nectar.

== Description ==
This lizard belongs to the smallest day geckos. It can reach a maximum length of approximately 10 cm. The body colour is bright green, which may have a blue hue. There is a red v-shaped stripe on the snout and two red bars between the eyes. On the back there often are a number of small red-brick coloured dots. The typical v-shaped marking on the throat may not be present in adults. The ventral side is yellow.

== Distribution ==
This species only inhabits the island Mohéli in the Comoros.

== Habitat ==
&quot;Phelsuma v-nigra v-nigra&quot; is found on banana trees and human dwellings.

== Diet ==
These day geckos feed on various insects and other invertebrates. They also like to lick soft, sweet fruit, pollen and nectar.

== Reproduction ==
At a temperature of 28 °C, the young will hatch after approximately 45 days. The juveniles measure 35 mm.

== Care and maintenance in captivity ==
These animals should be housed in pairs and need a medium-sized, well planted terrarium. The daytime temperature should be between 28 and 30 °C and 24 and 26 °C at night. The humidity should be around 70%. A two-month winter cooldown should be included during which temperature is 25 °C at daytime and 20 °C at night. In captivity, these animals can be fed with crickets, wax moth larvae, fruit flies, mealworms and houseflies.

<doc id="319058" wikidata="Q1368496" url="?curid=319058" title="Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead">
<text>The Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead is a unitary authority area with royal borough status in Berkshire, England. The borough is named after its two largest towns of Maidenhead (where the council is based) and Windsor. The borough also includes the towns of Ascot and Eton, plus numerous villages and surrounding rural areas. It is home to Windsor Castle, Eton College, Legoland Windsor and Ascot Racecourse. It is one of only four boroughs in England entitled to be prefixed &quot;royal&quot;, and the only one of them which is not a London borough.

==History==
The non-metropolitan district of Windsor and Maidenhead was created in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, as one of six districts within Berkshire. It covered the whole area of five former districts and part of a sixth, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Cookham Rural District
*Eton Rural District (parishes of Datchet, Horton and Wraysbury only, rest split between Beaconsfield and Slough)
*Eton Urban District
*Maidenhead Municipal Borough
*New Windsor Municipal Borough
*Windsor Rural District
The two Eton districts had been in Buckinghamshire prior to the reforms. The new district was named &#x27;Windsor and Maidenhead&#x27; after its two largest towns. The district was also given the additional honorific title of royal borough, which had previously been held by the municipal borough of New Windsor.

From 1974 until 1998 the council was a lower-tier authority, with Berkshire County Council providing county-level services. The county council was abolished in 1998 and the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead took on county-level services, making it a unitary authority. Berkshire continues to legally exist as a ceremonial county and a non-metropolitan county, albeit without a county council.

== River Thames ==
The borough straddles the River Thames. Approximately half of its flow through the borough has a bypass and seasonally-variable flood relief channel, the Jubilee River. Further flood relief channels are planned for the reaches below the Borough to benefit many other settlements including Datchet and Wraysbury in the borough which were the settlements most widely affected by the UK storms of January-February 2014.

== Towns and villages ==
The borough contains the following towns and villages:
==Governance==

Since 1998, the council has been a unitary authority, providing both district-level and county-level functions. It is based at Maidenhead Town Hall. Much of the borough is covered by civil parishes, which form an additional tier of local government for their areas, although the two largest towns of Maidenhead and Windsor are unparished.

===Westminster===
The Royal Borough is represented at Westminster by two members of parliament: Jack Rankin of the Conservative Party (for Windsor) and Joshua Reynolds of the Liberal Democrats (for Maidenhead). Maidenhead was held by the Conservative Party since its creation in 1997 until 2024. Windsor has been held by the same party since 1874 with varying representation from its 1484 creation including more than 350 initial years with two MPs. Small parts of other districts, notably Slough and Wokingham have intermittently been included in each constituency to prevent malapportionment which is a definition of boundaries which causes any MP to serve a significantly different number of potential voters (electors) than the others.

The irregular, elongated shape of the Windsor seat being the south-east half of the Borough has been criticised by academics who noted the net changes which the Heath administration led through Parliament in 1972, implemented in 1974, intensified difference. They frequently grouped right-leaning suburban areas within urban historic centres and more modern, urban left-leaning areas such as the bulk of Slough. This ostensibly amounted to nationwide gerrymandering or homogenisation to install a greater number safe seats at the expense of marginal seats however also reflected the majority of social associations of people in each area.

===Parish and town councils===
There are 14 parish councils and 1 town council in the borough:
The towns of Maidenhead and Windsor are unparished.

== Education ==

The Windsor and Maidenhead LEA provides a comprehensive system, with a three-tier successive school system in Windsor, and two-tier education elsewhere. Colleges and sixth forms are available in the main two towns as well as across its borders in Egham, Slough and Wokingham.

<doc id="319059" wikidata="Q4639742" url="?curid=319059" title="500 rum">
<text>500 rum, also called pinochle rummy, Michigan rummy, Persian rummy, rummy 500 or 500 rummy, is a popular variant of rummy. The game of canasta and several other games are believed to have developed from this popular form of rummy. The distinctive feature of 500 rum is that each player scores the value of the sets or cards they meld. It may be played by 2 to 8 players, but it is best for 3 to 5.

The term &quot;Michigan rummy&quot; may also refer to an unrelated game, very similar to the Canadian Rummoli (both sharing traits with the much older Poch), involving a playing board, chips, and accumulated pots that are awarded to players who play certain cards.

==Rules==
===The cards and dealing===
500 rum is played using a standard French deck and can use 52 cards, or 53–54 cards including one or two jokers. When playing with 5 or more players, two decks of cards should be used with a total of 104–108 cards.

The players draw for deal, low dealing first. Ace is the lowest card in the draw. The dealer shuffles, and the player to the right cuts. The dealer completes the cut and deals cards one at a time to each player face down, clockwise starting at the dealer&#x27;s left. The number of cards dealt depends on the number of players.

The remaining cards are placed in a single pile face down between the players, forming the stock. The top card of the stock is turned face up and placed besides the stock to start the discard pile. As play continues any cards added to the discard pile are placed face up on top of any cards already in the discard pile. The discard pile should be slightly spread, so that players can readily see all the cards in it. Players are permitted to move the cards in the discard pile to view the cards, but may not change the order of the discard pile. After a round is complete, the next player to the left becomes the dealer.

In one variation, the discard pile is started by dealing one extra card face down to the player on the dealer&#x27;s left, who can then choose any card from their hand to place face up besides the stock to start the discard pile. The player that wins the round then becomes the dealer in the next round.

===Game play===
The object of the game is to score points as in regular rummy by laying down or laying off cards, initially in groups of matching cards known as &quot;melds&quot;, with a &quot;meld&quot; consisting of either: 3 or 4 cards of the same rank (e.g. or ) called a &quot;set&quot;; or in sequences of three or more cards of the same suit (e.g. ) called a &quot;run&quot;. One variation of the game requires that laying down a &quot;run&quot; can only be done starting with four or more cards of the same suit (e.g. ).

Aces can be played as either a high card or a low card, meaning that they may be played after a king as a high card (e.g. ) or before a two as a low card (e.g. ). Going &quot;around the corner&quot; means that Ace is allowed to be both high and low in the same run (e.g. ). If going around the corner is not allowed, Q-K-A and 2-3-4 must be separate runs.

Each player in turn, beginning with the player to the left of the dealer, may draw either the top card of the stock or any card from the discard pile. Once a card is picked up, either from the stock or the discard pile, it is final and no other cards may be picked up. However, there are two conditions when drawing a card from the discard pile:
#The player must take all the cards on top of (i.e., discarded after) the selected card.
#The selected card so drawn must immediately be used, either by laying it down in a meld or by laying it off on a meld already on the table if permitted.
When drawing a card from the discard pile any remaining cards taken with the card drawn from the discard pile may be either melded in the same turn or simply added to the player&#x27;s hand. Also, multiple cards picked up from the discard pile are left out until the selected card is played in an acceptable manner.

During a player&#x27;s turn, after drawing but before discarding, they may lay down any meld of matching cards, or may lay off any cards that match a meld or cards that have already been played. A player may lay down a single card or pairs of cards, but only if they match cards that have already been played. For example, a player may lay down a single card (e.g. ) on either a set that has already been laid down (e.g. ), or a run or part of a run that has already been laid down (e.g. or ). A player may also lay down a pair of cards in sequence of the same suit on a run or part of a run that has already been laid down (e.g. lay down the on a run of or previously laid down).

Cards that are laid down or laid off are kept spread out on the table in front of the player, visible to other players. The player ends his turn by discarding a single card from his hand to the discard pile.

Players are usually only permitted to lay down cards when it is their turn, after drawing but before discarding. In a variation, players may put down melds or matching cards on other people&#x27;s turns. The round is not over until one of the players puts down their last card, so with this variation a player can put down a meld when ever they want, until that last card is down.

If jokers are used in the game, they are treated as wild cards and can represent any card the player chooses even if that card is already used in another meld.

The round is over when one player has no cards in his or her hand, either by melding or laying off all cards, or when there are no cards left in the stock pile. Players typically receive no bonus for finishing first.

===Discarding===
When picking up from the discard pile you cannot pick up just to play a single card on a meld or other cards that have already been laid down, sometimes referred to as &quot;picking up to hit&quot;. You may only pick up from the discard pile if you were to put down a meld consisting of 3 or more cards including the card that was picked up.

In one variation, a player may pick up from the discard pile to play a single card or pair of cards on a meld or other cards that have already been laid down by any of the players. In another variation, a player may pick up only the top card from the discard pile and keep it in their hand without immediately playing it.

===Scoring===
Face cards count as 10 as does the 10 card. A-9 are 5 points, unless the Ace is used high, when it is 15. Jokers count as 15 points.

In order to begin scoring all players must lay no less than 30 points for their first score.

When any player discards the last card in their hand, the play immediately ends. Each player&#x27;s score is then figured as follows: The player is credited with the point value of all cards that he has showing on the table. From this figure is subtracted the point value of all cards remaining in his hand. The difference is added or subtracted from their score, as the case may be.

If the cards they have shown total 85 points, and the cards left in their hand total 90 points, 5 points are subtracted from their previous net score. If the drawing pile runs out of cards and nobody is able to make a play, then the hand ends and nobody deducts the score from their hand.

The first player whose score reaches +500 wins the game. If two or more players reach 500 on the same hand, the one who goes out is the winner.

====Modified scoring systems====
These additional or alternate rules have been put in to simplify scoring and speed up games. Point variants for Aces change the game dynamic somewhat as players may be more or less likely to reveal and play them as a part of runs.

* Aces count 15 no exceptions or variations.
* Aces are worth 25.
* Aces played high are worth 15 except in the case where a single player plays a 4-of-a-kind Ace meld, in which case the meld is worth 100 points (25/ea.).
* Aces can be allowed to &quot;go-around&quot; in order to speed up games; thus allowing a meld of K-A-2.
* All other cards are worth 5 points.
* If preferred, all of these scores may be divided by five and the game played to 100.

====Boathouse rule====
Some rummy players play that any player must discard on the turn in which they go out. (A completed turn includes a discard in most variations of Rummy 500, and every turn, even the final turn, is not considered complete without a pile discard). This is often considered standard rules for Rummy.

For example, if a player held a hand of two 3&#x27;s and picked up another 3, this player would be unable to go out as they would not have a discard. Under this variation, the last card in a set picked up from the discard pile cannot be used as the discard in that round. This may prevent a player from picking up cards that would complete a meld if, after laying down the meld, they would not have a card left to discard. This is a variation that should be agreed upon before play begins.

Also, if the stock is finished then players may continue to draw from the pile only so long as they are able and willing to do so. Otherwise, the hand is finished with all cards in each player&#x27;s hand counting against them. This is also normally standard. However some play the alternative that the cards should be reshuffled, and play should continue. Another alternative with a depleted stock is for play to continue, with players discarding after each turn until one of the players goes out. 

Some variations require that the player must draw two cards from the stock pile. This variation is played as &quot;Boathouse Rum&quot; in Best of Card Games for Windows 95 and Card Hero for Windows 8.

====Add opponent&#x27;s hand rule====
Instead of players subtracting their remaining totals when play is finished, they add the values in their hands to the total of the player who went out. If nobody has gone out when the stock is depleted (see Boathouse rule):

*With two players, or two partnerships: add opponent&#x27;s remainder to your score.
*With more than two players: do not add any totals.
*Alternatively, continue play with a discard after each turn until one of the players goes out.

This again, is meant to speed up the game. Also when one player plays his last card, the other player reserves the chance to add any of his deadwood cards to his opponent&#x27;s melds.

==Variations==
===Dealer&#x27;s gambit===
This game is the same as 500 Rum, with the following exceptions. The pack is 54 cards: the standard 52 cards plus two jokers. Some people play with 56 cards, including four jokers. Unlike ordinary rummy, dealing is always rotated anti-clockwise.

At the beginning of each deal one joker is removed from the pack. After shuffling and dealing that joker is placed face-up at the side of the pack closest to the dealer. This is the &#x27;dealer&#x27;s joker&#x27; and may be used at any time in the game by the dealer, unless it has been &#x27;blocked&#x27; [see below] by another player&#x27;s joker. The second joker is shuffled and dealt with the rest of the cards.

After dealing but before any of the players look at their cards the dealer must nominate the effect of the jokers for that hand. The dealer may nominate the joker to do one of the following:
# Wild card. The joker may be used as a wild card in any set or sequence. The wild joker is worth zero points.
# Double. The joker doubles the value of any set. The joker is placed face up over any meld, whilst it is being melded. Once the joker has been added to the meld, that set is &#x27;sealed&#x27; and no further cards can laid off onto it.
# The joker is used to &#x27;split&#x27; the discard pile from either side of the card selected. Those cards on the inside of the split are then removed from the game for the remainder of that hand. Those cards on the outside of the split are added to the players hand. As per normal the selected card must be used immediately either by laying it down in a set or by laying it off on a set already on the table.

The dealer&#x27;s joker can be &#x27;blocked&#x27; at any time in the game by placing another joker face down over it. If the dealer&#x27;s joker is so blocked it may not be used by the dealer for the remainder of that hand.

Jokers have a zero value if still in a players hand at the end of the turn. There are no penalties for not using the jokers.

Each joker nomination may be used strategically by the dealer to improve their position or undermine that of other players. As a result, this is a highly strategic variant of the game which may result in long games with significant fluctuations in the score. As a result, some people only play to a smaller score of 250 points.

===Partnership 500 rum===
This game is the same as 500 rum, with the following exceptions.

Four players are organized into two teams of two players each, with partners facing each other across the table. The rules are exactly as in 500 rum, except the partners may play off on each other&#x27;s matched sets and sequences in an effort to go out as quickly as possible. When any player goes out, the play ends and the score of each partnership is figured as a unit. The game is over when either side reaches +500. The team with the highest score over 500 wins, even if a team goes out first.

===Persian rummy===
The game is the same as partnership 500 rum, with the following exceptions, and the pack is 56 cards: the standard 52 cards plus four jokers.

Each joker counts as 20 points, and jokers may not be used in sequences or as wild cards, but only in groups of three or four jokers. Any meld of four, laid down all at once, counts double its face value. Thus, four jokers laid down together count 160; three jokers laid down count 60, and the fourth joker when added counts only 20 more. Four 6s put down together count 48, but three 6s count only 18, and the fourth 6 adds only 6 points. If a player gets rid of all his cards, his side scores a bonus of 25.

A game ends after two deals. The side with the best score receives a bonus of 50 points and wins the difference between its final score and the opponents&#x27; score.

===Rummy===
If a player discards a card that plays into any match set or sequence already laid-off on the table then other players may call-out &quot;Rum&quot;. The first player to call &quot;Rum&quot; may only take the discarded card and must lay-off it on the table in front of them in their laid-off cards area. They may not combine it with cards in their hand to create a new match set or sequence.

===7-card straight===
If a player lays down a 7-card straight and then discards his last card, he is awarded 500 points. This is known as the &quot;Rummy Master&#x27;s Hand&quot;.

<text>The Grand Comoro Day Gecko (Phelsuma v-nigra comoraegrandensis ) is a small diurnal subspecies of geckos. It lives in the Comoros and typically inhabits trees and bushes. The Grand Comoro day gecko feeds on insects and nectar.

== Description ==
This lizard belongs to the smallest day geckos. It can reach a maximum length of approximately 10 cm. Their bodies are bright green, which may have a blue hue. There is a red v-shaped stripe on the snout and two red bars between the eyes. On the back there often are a large number of small red-brick coloured dots which may form a faint mid dorsal stripe. The flanks are grey. There is a v-shaped marking on the throat. The ventral side is yellowish white. This lizard also does not have eyelids like all day geckos.

== Distribution ==
This species only inhabits the island Grand Comoro in the Comoros.

== Habitat ==
The Grand Comoro day gecko inhabits moist forests, palm trees and human dwellings.

== Diet ==
These day geckos feed on various insects and other invertebrates. They also like to lick soft, sweet fruit, pollen, and nectar.

== Reproduction ==
At a temperature of 28°C, the young will hatch after approximately 45 days. The juveniles measure 35 mm.

== Care and maintenance in captivity ==
These animals should be housed in pairs and need a medium-sized, well planted terrarium. The daytime temperature should be between 28 and 30 °C and 24 and 26 °C at night. The humidity should be around 75–90%. In captivity, these animals can be fed with crickets, wax moth larvae, fruit flies, mealworms, and houseflies.

<text>Horemheb, also spelled Horemhab, Haremheb or Haremhab (, meaning &quot;Horus is in Jubilation&quot;), was the last pharaoh of the 18th Dynasty of Egypt (1550–1292 BC). He ruled for at least 14 years between 1319 BC and 1292 BC. He had no relation to the preceding royal family other than by marriage to Mutnedjmet, who is thought (though disputed) to have been the daughter of his predecessor, Ay; he is believed to have been of common birth.

Before he became pharaoh Horemheb was the commander-in-chief of the army under the reigns of Tutankhamun and Ay. After his accession to the throne, he reformed the Egyptian state and it was during his reign that official action against the preceding Amarna rulers began, which is why he is considered the ruler who restabilized his country after the troublesome and divisive Amarna Period.

Horemheb demolished monuments of Akhenaten, reusing the rubble in his own building projects, and usurped monuments of Tutankhamun and Ay. Horemheb presumably had no surviving sons, as he appointed as his successor his vizier Paramesse, who would assume the throne as Ramesses I.

==Early career and accession to kingship==

Horemheb is believed to have originally come from Hnes, on the west bank of the Nile, near the entrance to the Faiyum, since his coronation text formally credits the god Horus of Hnes for establishing him on the throne.
His parentage is unknown but he is believed to have been a commoner. According to the French Egyptologist Nicolas Grimal, Horemheb does not appear to be the same person as Paatenemheb (&quot;Aten Is Present In Jubilation&quot;), who was the commander-in-chief of Akhenaten&#x27;s army. Grimal notes that Horemheb&#x27;s political career began under Tutankhamun where he &quot;is depicted at this king&#x27;s side in his own tomb chapel at Memphis.&quot;

In the earliest known stage of his life Horemheb served as &quot;the royal spokesman for [Egypt&#x27;s] foreign affairs&quot; and personally led a diplomatic mission to visit the Nubian governors. This resulted in a reciprocal visit by &quot;the Prince of Miam (Aniba)&quot; to Tutankhamun&#x27;s court, &quot;an event [that is] depicted in the tomb of the Viceroy Huy.&quot; Horemheb quickly rose to prominence under Tutankhamun, becoming commander-in-chief of the army and advisor to the pharaoh. Horemheb&#x27;s specific titles are spelled out in his Saqqara tomb, which was built while he was still only an official: &quot;Hereditary Prince, Fan-bearer on the Right Side of the King and Chief Commander of the Army&quot;; the &quot;attendant of the King in his footsteps in the foreign countries of the south and the north&quot;; the &quot;King&#x27;s Messenger in front of his army to the foreign countries to the south and the north&quot;; and the &quot;Sole Companion, he who is by the feet of his lord on the battlefield on that day of killing Asiatics.&quot;

When Tutankhamun died while a teenager, Horemheb had already been officially designated as the &quot;rpat&quot; or &quot;iry-pat&quot; (basically the hereditary or crown prince) and &quot;idnw&quot; (deputy of the king in the entire land) by the child pharaoh; these titles are found inscribed in Horemheb&#x27;s then private Memphite tomb at Saqqara, which dates to the reign of Tutankhamun since the child king&#x27;s
The title &quot;iry-pat&quot; (Hereditary Prince) was used very frequently in Horemheb&#x27;s Saqqara tomb but not combined with any other words. When used alone, the Egyptologist Alan Gardiner has shown that the &quot;iry-pat&quot; title contains features of ancient descent and lawful inheritance which is identical to the designation for a &quot;Crown Prince.&quot; This means that Horemheb was the openly recognised heir to Tutankhamun&#x27;s throne, and not Ay, Tutankhamun&#x27;s immediate successor. The Dutch Egyptologist Jacobus Van Dijk observes:

Nozomu Kawai, however, rejects Van Dijk&#x27;s interpretation that Tutankhamun had nominated Horemheb as his successor and reasons that:
: &quot;If Horemheb was appointed as the “Crown Prince” at the beginning of Tutankhamun’s reign, this means that the end of the royal bloodline was already arranged. If this arrangement was made, people like Ay, who were closely connected to the royal family, would not have accepted it. Although Horemheb had already boasted of his strength in his pre-royal career, the statements must have been exaggerated, especially in his [ie. Horemheb&#x27;s] coronation inscription, which was undoubtedly intended to propagate his legitimacy as the king. Notably, he called himself the ‘Eldest son of Horus’, a title that regularly refers to the Crown Prince. For van Dijk this means that he was already the designated successor of Tutankhamun. Janssen, however, states that the “Eldest Son” was honorific and did not indicate the surviving heir to the throne. I would suggest that this expression seems to have been a propaganda title meaning the “Eldest son of Horus of Hutnesu,” Horemheb’s birthplace.&quot;
While no objects belonging to Horemheb were found in Tutankhamun&#x27;s tomb, and items among the tomb goods donated by other high-ranking officials, such as Maya and General Nakhtmin, were identified by Egyptologists. Nozomu Kawai maintains that Horemheb was an active participant at Tutankhamun&#x27;s burial.
Kawai writes:
: &quot;Many scholars have suggested that Horemheb did not leave any evidence in Tutankhamun’s tomb, while prominent persons such as Ay, Maya and Nakhtmin left either funerary items or iconographic images. However, the wall scene of the tomb shows Tutankhmun’s coffin dragged by a group of officials in a mourning procession that contains a man who seems to be Horemheb (Fig. 3). The lone figure standing behind the two viziers must be Horemheb, which also makes him situated closest to the mummy of Tutankhamun. This means that Horemheb acted as the leader of the funerary procession.&quot;

Kawai maintains rather that both Ay and Horemheb held important high administrative roles during Tutankhamun&#x27;s reign with Ay participating in royal cultic activities whereas Horemheb acted as a royal military leader and legislator. But after Ay became the pharaoh, his relationship with Horemheb changed. The aged Vizier Ay initially succeeded Tutankhamun, possibly because he made an arrangement with Horemheb. However, during his brief four-year reign, Ay proceeded to nominate Nakhtmin as his successor—whom Ay named as &quot;King&#x27;s Son&quot; ()—rather than Horemheb. The title of “King’s Son” (zꜣ-nswt) was clearly meant to designate the king&#x27;s successor and Ay, therefore, sidelined Horemheb&#x27;s claim to the throne with this action. Ankhesenamun, Tutankhamun&#x27;s queen chose not to marry Horemheb, a commoner, and this also solidified Ay&#x27;s kingship.

Kawai notes that Horemheb himself likely &quot;did not plot revenge on Ay, probably because Ay was old and would likely die soon&quot; and merely kept his military power. After Ay&#x27;s reign, which lasted for a little over four years, Horemheb managed to seize power, presumably thanks to his position as commander of the army, and to assume what he must have perceived to be his reward for having ably served Egypt under Tutankhamun and Ay, Horemheb resented Ay&#x27;s attempt to sideline him from the royal succession and acted to quickly removed Nakhtmin&#x27;s rival claim to the throne and arranged to have Ay&#x27;s WV 23 tomb desecrated by smashing the latter&#x27;s sarcophagus, systematically chiselling Ay&#x27;s name and figure out of the tomb walls and probably destroying Ay&#x27;s mummy. Horemheb also usurped and enlarged Ay&#x27;s mortuary temple at Medinet Habu for his own use and erased Ay&#x27;s titulary on the back of a 17-foot colossal statue by carving his own titulary in its place. 

Horemheb&#x27;s actions against Ay were a damnatio memoriae to remove the memory of his rival from the historical records. However, he spared Tutankhamun&#x27;s tomb from vandalism presumably out of respect because it was Tutankhamun who had overseen his rise to prominence in the first place and because he had no antagonism with Tutankhamun.

==Internal reform==

Upon his accession, Horemheb initiated a comprehensive series of internal transformations to the power structures of Akhenaten&#x27;s reign, due to the preceding transfer of state power from Amun&#x27;s priests to Akhenaten&#x27;s government officials. Horemheb &quot;appointed judges and regional tribunes ... reintroduced local religious authorities&quot; and divided legal power &quot;between Upper Egypt and Lower Egypt&quot; between &quot;the Viziers of Thebes and Memphis respectively.&quot;

These deeds are recorded in a stela which the king erected at the foot of his Tenth Pylon at Karnak. Occasionally called &quot;The Great Edict of Horemheb&quot;, it is a copy of the actual text of the king&#x27;s decree to re-establish order to the Two Lands and curb abuses of state authority. The stela&#x27;s creation and prominent location emphasizes the great importance which Horemheb placed upon domestic reform.

Horemheb also reformed the Army and reorganized the Deir el-Medina workforce in his 7th year while Horemheb&#x27;s official Maya renewed the tomb of Thutmose IV, which had been disturbed by tomb robbers in his 8th year. While the king restored the priesthood of Amun, he prevented the Amun priests from forming a stranglehold on power, by deliberately reappointing priests who mostly came from the Egyptian army since he could rely on their personal loyalty.
Horemheb was a prolific builder who erected numerous temples and buildings throughout Egypt during his reign. He constructed the Second, Ninth, and Tenth Pylons of the Great Hypostyle Hall, in the Temple at Karnak, using recycled talatat blocks from Akhenaten&#x27;s own monuments here, as building material for the first two Pylons.

Horemheb continued Tutankhamun&#x27;s restoration of the old order that had been established before the Amarna period. He reintroduced the ancient cults, particularly Amun, thus proving himself a true pharaoh who established Maat (world order).

Because of his unexpected rise to the throne, Horemheb had two tombs constructed for himself: the first – when he was a mere nobleman – at Saqqara near Memphis, and the other in the Valley of the Kings, in Thebes, in tomb KV 57 as king. His chief wife was Queen Mutnedjmet, who may have been Nefertiti&#x27;s younger sister. They had no surviving children, although examinations of Mutnedjmet&#x27;s mummy show that she gave birth several times, and she was buried with an infant, suggesting that she and her last child died in childbirth. Horemheb is not known to have any children by his first wife, Amenia, who died before Horemheb assumed power.

==Disputed reign length==

Scholars have long disputed whether Horemheb reigned for 14-15 years or 27 years. Manetho&#x27;s Epitome assigns a reign length of 4 years and 1 month to a king called Harmais. Scholars previously assigned this reign-length to Ay; however, evidence from excavations in Horemheb&#x27;s tomb (KV57) indicates that this figure should be raised by a decade to [1]4 years and 1 month and attributed to Horemheb. These excavations, conducted under G.T. Martin and Jacobus Van Dijk in 2006 and 2007, uncovered a large hoard of 168 inscribed wine sherds and dockets, below densely compacted debris in a great shaft (called Well Room E) in KV 57. Of the 46 wine sherds with year dates, 14 have nothing but the year date formula, 5 dockets have year 10+X, 3 dockets have year 11+X, 2 dockets preserve year 12+X and 1 docket has a year 13+X inscription. 22 dockets &quot;mention year 13 and 8 have year 14 [of Horemheb]&quot; but none mention a higher date for Horemheb.

The full texts of the docket readings are identical and read as:

Meanwhile, the year 14 dockets, in contrast, are all individual and mention specific wines such as &quot;very good quality wine&quot; or, in one case &quot;sweet wine&quot; and the location of the vineyard is identified. A general example is this text on a year 14 wine docket:
Other year 14 dockets mention Memphis (?), the Western River while their vintners are named as Nakhtamun, [Mer-]seger-men, Ramose, and others.
The &quot;quality and consistency of the KV 57 dockets strongly suggest that Horemheb was buried in his year 14, or at least before the wine harvest of his year 15 at the very latest.&quot; This evidence is consistent &quot;with the Horemheb dockets from Deir el-Medina which mention years 2, 3, 4, 6, 13, and 14, but again no higher dates ...&quot; while a docket ascribed to Horemheb from Sedment has year 12.&quot; The lack of dated inscriptions for Horemheb after his year 14 also explains the unfinished state of Horemheb&#x27;s royal KV 57 tomb – &quot;a fact not taken into account by any of those [scholars] defending a long reign [of 26 or 27 years]. The tomb is comparable to that of Seti I in size and decoration technique, and Seti I&#x27;s tomb is far more extensively decorated than that of Horemheb, and yet Seti managed to virtually complete his tomb within a decade, whereas Horemheb did not even succeed in fully decorating the three rooms he planned to have done, leaving even the burial hall unfinished. Even if we assume that Horemheb did not begin the work on his royal tomb until his year 7 or 8, ... it remains a mystery how the work could not have been completed had he lived on for another 20 or more years.&quot; Therefore, some scholars now accept a reign of 14 years and 1 month.

In 1995, prior to the 2006 and 2007 discovery of wine dockets from Horemheb&#x27;s tomb, Van Dijk in a 1995 GM article already argued, based on the career of Maya&#x27;s chief sculptor, Userhat Hatiay, that Horemheb far shorter reign of between 15 and 17 years.
The argument for a 27 year reign derived from two texts. The first is an anonymous hieratic graffito written on the shoulder of a now fragmented statue from his mortuary temple in Karnak which mentions the appearance of the king himself, or a royal cult statue representing the king, for a religious feast. The ink graffito reads &quot;Year 27, first Month of Shemu day 9, the day on which Horemheb, who loves Amun and hates his enemies, entered&quot; [the temple for the event]. It was disputed whether this was a contemporary text or a reference to a festival commemorating Horemheb&#x27;s accession written in the reign of a later king. The second text is the Inscription of Mes, from the reign of Ramesses II, which records that a court case decision was rendered in favour of a rival branch of Mes&#x27; family in year 59 of Horemheb. It was argued that the year 59 Horemheb date included the reigns of all the rulers between Amenhotep III and Horemheb. Subtracting the nearly 17 year reign of Akhenaten, the 2 year reign of Neferneferuaten, the 9 year reign of Tutankhamun and the reign of Ay suggested a reign of 26–27 years for Horemheb. However, the length of Ay&#x27;s reign is not actually known and Wolfgang Helck argues that there was no standard Egyptian practice of including the years of all the rulers between Amenhotep III and Horemheb.

The most recent interpretation of the archeological evidence today favours Van Dijk&#x27;s arguments that Horemheb either died in his Regnal Year 14 or that he started a Regnal Year 15 but died before the wine harvest of his final year was processed. As David Aston notes in a 2012 Ägypten und Levante paper, this theory means that R. &quot;Hari&#x27;s [1964] emendation of the [partly damaged] Horemheb text London UC 14291 to Year [1]5 is possible but to year [2]5 is unlikely.&quot;

== Cartouches and symbols ==
Horemheb turned to several gods because of his various names: his throne name means &#x27;Sacred are the manifestations of Ra&#x27; and his name birth name is accompanied by the epithet &#x27;beloved of Amun&#x27;.

It is not yet proven whether Horemheb had really exorcised the Amarna period; the great iconoclasm began only after his death. To be able to build for himself, however, he did have the Per-Aten temple at Karnak pulled down and constructed a pylon of the Amun temple with its stone blocks. The Aten reliefs from the Amarna period on those blocks therefore remained fairly well preserved.

Horemheb appear in reliefs wearing the typical pleated linen robe of a high ranking official depicted sitting in front of an offering table, as a pharaoh holding the pole and the sekhem sceptre of a high official (the uraeus was added after his ascension to the throne), with a benu-bird regarded as the protector of the dead as the soul of Ra sitting on a stand, and finally a man worshipping a benu-bird.

The coronation inscription on the back of a double statue, showing Horemheb with his wife, tells that he is under the protection of Horus and appointed by Amun. It reports further that he had the damaged statues of the old gods remade and had the temples that had fallen into disrepair rebuilt. For the Amun cult, &#x27;he provided them with servants to the god and lector priests from the military elite&#x27;. In a decree on a stele in Karnak, he again officially confirms the restoration of the old order.

==Succession==


Under Horemheb, Egypt&#x27;s power and confidence were once again restored after the internal chaos of the Amarna Period; this situation set the stage for the rise of the 19th Dynasty under such ambitious Pharaohs as Seti I and Ramesses II. Geoffrey Thorndike Martin in his excavation work at Saqqara states that the burial of Horemheb&#x27;s second wife Mutnedjmet, as well as that of an unborn or newborn baby, was located at the bottom of a shaft to the rooms of Horemheb&#x27;s Saqqara tomb. He notes that &quot;a fragment of an alabaster vase inscribed with a funerary text for the chantress of Amun and King&#x27;s Wife, Mutnodjmet, as well as pieces of a statuette of her [was found here] ... The funerary vase in particular, since it bears her name and titles would hardly have been used for the burial of some other person.&quot;Eugene Strouhal studied a skull and other bones and concluded that they belonged to the queen. According to his analysis, the queen lost her teeth at an early age. She died at around age forty, possibly in childbirth, as the remains of a fetus were found with her body.Since Horemheb had no surviving son, he appointed his Vizier, Paramesse, to succeed him upon his death, both to reward Paramesse&#x27;s loyalty and because the latter had both a son and grandson to secure Egypt&#x27;s royal succession. Paramesse employed the name Ramesses I upon assuming power and founded the 19th Dynasty of the New Kingdom. Horemheb&#x27;s second successor, Seti I, was married to a possible daughter of Horemheb&#x27;s, Tanodjmy. While the decoration of Horemheb&#x27;s KV 57 tomb was still unfinished upon his death, this situation is not unprecedented: Amenhotep II&#x27;s tomb was also not fully completed when he was buried, even though this ruler enjoyed a reign of 26 years.

During the damnatio memoriae of Horemheb, the second pharaoh after him, Seti I, left the name of Horemheb on the veil of the Amun bark on a pedestal in Luxor temple untouched. This is similar to how Horemheb left the name of Tutankhamun on the veil of Amun bark at Karnak temple untouched.

==Tomb and excavation==

Directly after his accession to the throne, Horemheb had a tomb built in the Valley of Kings, abandoning his earlier one near Memphis. For the first time, scenes from the Book of Gates were used in the burial chamber as a decoration for a royal tomb.

Horemheb&#x27;s tomb was excavated in the early 20th century by Theodore M. Davis. Davis discovered it in a poor state due to robbers and earth movements over the centuries. The lid of the sarcophagus had been taken off and smashed by robbers.

He also plays a major role in the deaths of both Akhenaten and Tutankhamun. While Ay outmaneuvers him for the throne after Tut&#x27;s death (Horemheb had planned to force Ankhesenamun to marry him, but she announced a marriage to Ay instead), Horemheb easily forces his ailing father to accept him as heir a few years later.

<text>The Anjouan Island day gecko (&quot;Phelsuma v-nigra anjouanensis&quot;) is a small diurnal subspecies of gecko. It lives in the Comoros and typically inhabits trees and bushes. The Anjouan Island day gecko feeds on insects and nectar.

== Description ==
This lizard belongs to the smallest day geckos. It can reach a maximum length of approximately . The body colour is bright green. There is a red v-shaped stripe on the snout and a red barring between the eyes. On the back there are a number of tiny red-brick coloured spots and reticulations. On the throat, there is a faint v-shaped marking. The ventral side is greyish.

== Distribution ==
This subspecies only inhabits the island Anjouan in the Comoros.

== Habitat ==
&quot;Phelsuma v-nigra anjouanensis&quot; is found on agave bushes, banana trees, palms, human dwellings and even on the ground.

== Diet ==
These day geckos feed on various insects and other invertebrates. They also like to lick soft, sweet fruit, pollen and nectar.

== Care and maintenance in captivity ==
These animals should be housed in pairs and need a medium-sized, well planted terrarium. The daytime temperature should be between and at night. The humidity should be not too high. A two-month winter cooldown should be included during which temperature is at daytime and at night. In captivity, these animals can be fed with crickets, wax moth larvae, fruit flies, mealworms and houseflies.

<text>The Summerland disaster occurred when a fire spread through the Summerland leisure centre in Douglas on the Isle of Man on the night of 2 August 1973. 50 people were killed and 80 seriously injured. The scale of the fire has been compared to those seen during the Blitz.

==Background==
Summerland was opened on 25 May 1971. It was a climate-controlled building covering on Douglas&#x27;s waterfront, consisting of of floor area constructed at a cost of £2 million. The building&#x27;s exterior and the interior were designed by two architects who did not coordinate their planning with each other and thereby created a venue with significant fire risks.

Summerland was designed to accommodate up to 10,000 tourists and consisted of a dance hall, five floors of holiday games, a rollerskating rink, restaurants and public bars. It was an example of Modernist architecture incorporating advanced controlled internal climate, built with novel construction techniques using new plastic materials. The street frontage and part of the roof was clad in Oroglas, a transparent acrylic glass sheeting.

==Fire==
The fire started at around 7:30 p.m. on 2 August 1973 when approximately 3,000 people were inside and was caused by three boys who were smoking in a small disused kiosk on the centre&#x27;s miniature golf course, and who told police it was likely started by a carelessly discarded match or stub. The burning kiosk collapsed against the exterior of the building. This part of the building was clad in a material called &quot;Galbestos&quot;: profiled steel sheeting with asbestos felt on both sides coated with bitumen, with no fire-resistant qualities. The fire spread to the wall&#x27;s interior soundproofing material, which was highly combustible, causing an intense fire that ignited the flammable acrylic sheeting that covered the rest of the building. The fire quickly spread across the sheeting on the leisure centre walls and roof and through vents which were not properly fireproofed. The acrylic material melted, allowing more oxygen to enter and dropping burning molten material, both starting other fires and injuring those trying to escape. The building&#x27;s open-plan design included many unblocked internal spaces that acted as chimneys, adding to the conflagration.

There was no attempt to evacuate the 3,000 people present until the visible evidence of the flames prompted a panic-stricken mass rush for the exits. The fire was contained in an internal space within the walls until it penetrated the interior, destroying the wiring of the fire alarm system in the process. One survivor (who was a child at the time) remembered her father noticing smoke coming from the ventilation shaft and had started to attempt to evacuate when the whole area erupted in flames. The survivor and her mother were separated from her father and sister and stuck in the venue before being rescued through a window by firemen.

Because of the locked fire doors, many people headed to the main entrance, which caused a crush.

The fire services were not called for over 20 minutes, and even then the call did not originate from Summerland. Instead, the first call came from a passing taxi driver, while another came from the captain of a ship offshore who radioed HM Coastguard and said, &quot;It looks as if the whole of the Isle of Man is on fire&quot;. The Coastguard immediately called the fire brigade. The first responding fire crews realised additional resources would be required, and almost every resource available to the Isle of Man Fire and Rescue Service was mobilised to the incident (93 of its 106 firefighters and all 16 of its engines).

== Victims ==
The fire killed 50 people, eleven of them under the age of twenty. Around 80 people were seriously injured in the resulting crush and fire and received physical and mental scars. The fire brigade&#x27;s provisional total of 51 deaths at the scene was subsequently revised down to 48, and two others died in hospital, one in Douglas on 11 August and the other in Scotland on 29 September; the latter is excluded from the Isle of Man coroner&#x27;s list of 49 deaths. Ian Phillips of Birmingham University suggests these reporting discrepancies explain why some sources have given incorrect death tolls of 49, 51, or 53. The inscription on the 1998 disaster memorial did not give a death toll; its 2013 replacement lists all 50 names.

==Aftermath==

The death toll brought about a public inquiry that ran from September 1973 to February 1974. Denis Cowley QC acted for the Douglas Corporation. No specific individuals or groups were blamed and the deaths were attributed to misadventure, although the delay in evacuation and the flammable building materials were condemned.

On 17 September 1973, three Liverpool boys and one from Glasgow – two of them 12 and the other 14 the glasgow boy was 9– appeared before Douglas Juvenile Court and admitted wilfully and unlawfully damaging the lock of a plastic kiosk next to Summerland. They were each fined £3 () and ordered to pay 33p compensation and 15p costs.

The centre was seriously damaged by the fire. Its charred steel skeletal remains were demolished in 1975 and then rebuilt on a smaller scale, construction commencing in 1976, with a smaller area of glass than the original, and a highly advanced fire extinguisher and alarm system. The centre reopened in June 1978.

Soon after the disaster, John Hinnigan was brought in from Blackburn fire and rescue to become the new chief.

After the fire, changes to building regulations to improve fire safety were introduced.

===2002 flood and final closure===

In October 2002, torrential rain caused damage to several structures, as well as two landslides behind Summerland which dislodged two 50-tonne concrete blocks that had once supported the roof of the original building, but had not been removed in the wake of the fire. A geotechnical team determined that the blocks could not be safely stabilised or removed and that there was a risk they would fall into the buildings below, so the site was scheduled for demolition. With the building also suffering from concrete cancer, the remainder of the site closed in 2004, and demolition began in January 2006. Today, the site where the Summerland leisure centre once sat is an empty, undeveloped plot. The west wall remains intact as there is concern that its removal may cause the adjacent cliff to collapse.

==Memorials==
Forty years after the tragedy, a permanent memorial in the form of three granite columns was unveiled at Kaye Memorial Gardens, at the bottom of Summer Hill. It bears the names of those killed in the fire and is set into a circle of paving, alongside a stone laid earlier to mark the 25th anniversary.

On other anniversaries of the disaster many memorials take place, such as a memorial concert and a moment of silence at the location which is now a vacant site.

== Depiction in media ==
One survivor, Ruth McQuillan-Wilson, wrote about her experiences from the fire in a book entitled &quot;Made in Summerland&quot;, which was published in July 2017.

<text>George Enescu (; – 4 May 1955), known in France as Georges Enesco, was a Romanian composer, violinist, pianist, conductor, and teacher and is regarded as one of the greatest musicians in Romanian history.

==Biography==

Enescu was born in Romania, in the village of Liveni (later renamed &quot;George Enescu&quot; in his honor), then in Dorohoi County, today Botoșani County. His father was Costache Enescu, a landholder, and his mother was Maria Enescu (née Cosmovici), the daughter of an Orthodox priest. Their eighth child, he was born after all the previous siblings had died in infancy. His father later separated from Maria Enescu and had another son with Maria Ferdinand-Suschi: the painter Dumitru Bâșcu.

A child prodigy, Enescu began experimenting with composing at an early age. Several, mostly very short, pieces survive, all for violin and piano. The earliest work of significant length bears the title &quot;Pămînt românesc&quot; (&quot;Romanian Land&quot;), and is inscribed &quot;opus for piano and violin by George Enescu, Romanian composer, aged five years and a quarter&quot;. Shortly thereafter, his father presented him to the professor and composer Eduard Caudella. On 5 October 1888, at the age of seven, he became the youngest student ever admitted to the Vienna Conservatory, where he studied with Joseph Hellmesberger Jr., Robert Fuchs, and Sigismund Bachrich. He was the second person ever to be admitted to the Vienna Conservatory by a dispensation of age, and was the first non-Austrian (in 1882, Fritz Kreisler had also been admitted at the age of seven; according to the rules, nobody younger than 14 years could study there).

In 1891, the ten-year-old Enescu gave a private concert at the Court of Vienna, in the presence of Emperor Franz Joseph.

Joseph Hellmesberger Sr., one of his teachers and the director of the Vienna Conservatory, hosted Enescu at his home, where the child prodigy met his idol, Johannes Brahms.

He graduated at the age of 12, earning the silver medal. In his Viennese concerts young Enescu played works by Brahms, Sarasate and Mendelssohn. In 1895, he went to Paris to continue his studies. He studied violin with Martin Pierre Marsick, harmony with André Gedalge, and composition with Jules Massenet and Gabriel Fauré.

Enescu then studied from 1895 to 1899 at the Conservatoire de Paris. In a letter from André Gédalge to Lucien Rebatet, dated 16 October 1923, Gédalge said that Enescu was &quot;the only one [among his students] who truly had ideas and spirit&quot; &quot;(fr: le seul qui ait vraiment des idées et du souffle)&quot;.

On 6 February 1898, at the age of 16, Enescu presented in Paris his first mature work, &quot;Poema Română&quot;, played by the Colonne Orchestra, then one of the most prestigious in the world, and conducted by Édouard Colonne.

Many of Enescu&#x27;s works were influenced by Romanian folk music, his most popular compositions being the two &quot;Romanian Rhapsodies&quot; (1901–02), the opera &quot;Œdipe&quot; (1936), and the suites for orchestra. He also wrote five mature symphonies (two of them unfinished), a symphonic poem &quot;Vox maris&quot;, and much chamber music (three sonatas for violin and piano, two for cello and piano, a piano trio, two string quartets and two piano quartets, a wind decet (French, &quot;dixtuor&quot;), an octet for strings, a piano quintet, and a chamber symphony for twelve solo instruments). A young Ravi Shankar recalled in the 1960s how Enescu, who had developed a deep interest in Oriental music, rehearsed with Shankar&#x27;s brother Uday Shankar and his musicians. Around the same time, Enescu took the young Yehudi Menuhin to the Colonial Exhibition in Paris, where he introduced him to the Gamelan Orchestra from Indonesia.

On 8 January 1923 he made his American debut as a conductor in a concert given by the Philadelphia Orchestra at Carnegie Hall in New York City, and subsequently visited the United States many times. It was in America, in the 1920s, that Enescu was first persuaded to make recordings as a violinist. He also appeared as a conductor with many American orchestras and, in 1936, was one of the candidates considered to replace Arturo Toscanini as permanent conductor of the New York Philharmonic. In 1932, Enescu was elected a titular member of the Romanian Academy. In 1935, he conducted the Orchestre Symphonique de Paris and Yehudi Menuhin (who had been his pupil for several years starting in 1927) in Mozart&#x27;s Violin Concerto No. 3 in G major. He also conducted the New York Philharmonic between 1937 and 1938. In 1939, he married Maria Tescanu Rosetti (known as Princess Maruca Cantacuzino through her first husband Mihail Cantacuzino), a good friend of Queen Marie of Romania.

He was also renowned as a violin teacher. He began teaching at the Mannes School of Music in 1948. His students included Yehudi Menuhin, Christian Ferras, Ivry Gitlis, Arthur Grumiaux, Serge Blanc, Ida Haendel, Uto Ughi, and Joan Field. () 

He promoted contemporary Romanian music, playing works of Constantin Silvestri, Mihail Jora, Ionel Perlea and Marțian Negrea. Enescu considered Bach&#x27;s Sonatas and Partitas for solo violin as the &quot;Himalayas of violinists&quot;. An annotated version of this work brings together the indications of Enescu regarding sonority, phrasing, tempos, musicality, fingering and expression.

Enescu died on 4 May 1955. On his death, he was interred in Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.

==Reception==

Pablo Casals described Enescu as &quot;the greatest musical phenomenon since Mozart&quot; and &quot;one of the greatest geniuses of modern music&quot;. Queen Marie of Romania wrote in her memoirs that &quot;in George Enescu was real gold&quot;. Yehudi Menuhin, Enescu&#x27;s most famous pupil, once said about his teacher: &quot;He will remain for me the absoluteness through which I judge others&quot;, and &quot;Enescu gave me the light that has guided my entire existence.&quot; He also considered Enescu &quot;the most extraordinary human being, the greatest musician and the most formative influence&quot; he had ever experienced. Vincent d&#x27;Indy claimed that if Beethoven&#x27;s works were destroyed, they could be all reconstructed from memory by George Enescu. Alfred Cortot, one of the greatest pianists of all time, once said that Enescu, though primarily a violinist, had better piano technique than his own.

Enescu&#x27;s only opera, &quot;Œdipe&quot; (&quot;Oedipe&quot;), was staged for the first time at the Royal Opera House in London in 2016, 80 years after its Paris premiere, in a production directed and designed by La Fura dels Baus which received superlative reviews in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;The Independent&quot;, &quot;The Times&quot; and other publications. An analysis of Enescu&#x27;s work and the reasons why it is less known in the UK was published by musician Dominic Saunders in &quot;The Guardian&quot;.

==Commemorations==
Enescu founded the Enescu Prize in composition, which was awarded from 1913 to 1946, and afterwards by the National University of Music Bucharest.

Eugène Ysaÿe&#x27;s Violin Sonata No. 3 in D minor, subtitled &quot;Ballade&quot; (composed in 1923), was dedicated as an act of homage to fellow-violinist Enescu.

While staying in Bucharest during the 1930s, Enescu lived in the Cantacuzino Palace on Calea Victoriei and married its then owner, Maruca Cantacuzino, in 1939. After the Communist takeover, the couple occupied a part of it briefly before moving to Paris in 1947. Following Enescu&#x27;s death in 1955, Maruca donated the palace to the Romanian state in order to organize a museum in memory of the musician. Likewise, the Symphony Orchestra of Bucharest and the George Enescu Festival—initiated by the musicologist Andrei Tudor and supported by his friend, musical advocate, and sometime collaborator, the conductor George Georgescu—are named and held in his honor, and the composer&#x27;s childhood home in Liveni was inaugurated as a memorial museum in 1958.

Earlier still, in 1947, his wife Maruca donated to the state the mansion near Moinești where Enescu had lived and where he completed his opera &quot;Oedipe&quot;, provided that a cultural centre be built there. In Moinești itself there is a street named after the composer, as well as a middle school. In addition the renamed George Enescu International Airport at Bacău is some twenty miles away. Then in 2014 the home of Enescu&#x27;s maternal grandfather in Mihăileni, Botoșani, where the composer spent part of his childhood, was rescued from an advanced state of dilapidation by a team of volunteer architects and now houses a centre of excellence for the study of music.

Enescu&#x27;s portrait appeared on the redesigned 5 lei Romanian banknote in 2005.

<text>Tirania purpurea, the sole species in genus Tirania, is a species of climbing plant endemic to Vietnam. This genus is related to &quot;Forchhammeria&quot; and &quot;Stixis&quot;, but the placement of these three is uncertain. They were placed in Capparaceae until DNA studies showed them to be more closely related to Resedaceae that to Capparaceae. They are sometimes placed in their own family Stixaceae, but since it is not yet clear whether they are from a clade, they are better left in Brassicales unplaced at family rank.

<doc id="319080" wikidata="Q7984149" url="?curid=319080" title="Wessex Regionalists">
<text>The Wessex Regionalists is a minor English regionalist political party in the United Kingdom. It seeks a degree of legislative and administrative home rule for Wessex, an area in the south and south-west of England loosely based on the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of the same name.
The party has contested a small number of Wessex-area parliamentary constituencies in most elections since it was established, but without success.

==History==
Speaking at a tourism industry conference in 1969, the then Viscount Weymouth suggested Wessex as a regional identity for tourism purposes. He later objected to the press over Wessex not being given the same opportunities as Scotland or Wales in the Kilbrandon Report. Lord Weymouth subsequently stood as the first Wessex Regionalist parliamentary candidate in Westbury in the February 1974 United Kingdom general election, coming last with 521 votes.

The party was formally constituted in 1981. It initially used Thomas Hardy&#x27;s definition of Wessex as Berkshire, Hampshire, Wiltshire, Somerset, Dorset and Devon; but later added Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire. It pulled out of the 1987 general election and advocated that its supporters voted for the Liberal/SDP Alliance on the basis that they were a close second in many Wessex seats and were the most supportive of regional government.

Lord Weymouth (who succeeded as The 7th Marquess of Bath in June 1992) was the first president of the party, later defecting to the Liberal Democrats although in 1999 he was &quot;still in touch&quot; with the Wessex Regionalists. Subsequent presidents have included the activist John Banks and the former architect Colin Bex.

In 2013, Dorset County Councillor David C Fox switched his party allegiance from Liberal Democrat to Wessex Regionalist for his final few days in office.

During the 2015 general election, Bex cast doubt on the official version of events of the 2001 September 11 attacks. During the UK&#x27;s 2016 referendum on membership of the European Union, the then-president Bex campaigned to leave. He described immigration as a &quot;peaceful invasion&quot;, describing &quot;people from all over the world&quot; as &quot;infiltrating&quot; national institutions. Devizes candidate and party leader Jim Gunter, at a hustings shortly before the 2017 general election, advocated a second referendum and, if that were not possible, the &quot;Norway option&quot; of remaining in the single market.

==Ideology==

The party has been described as ethnoterritorial, though an earlier study of regionalist and nationalist parties in Britain reached the opposite conclusion, saying that &quot;For regionalism, the legitimacy of the state as a whole is not usually in question; the challenge is to its territorial organisation. This is in contrast to ethnic nationalism (for example, that advocated for Wales), which suggests that the state is not legitimate because it contains different nations.&quot; Its platform is based on the creation of a devolved assembly for the region it defines as Wessex. The party defines the counties of Berkshire, Devon, Dorset, Gloucestershire, Hampshire, the Isle of Wight, Oxfordshire, Somerset, and Wiltshire as being part of Wessex. Whilst this roughly corresponds to the South West Region, it also includes the Western counties of the South East Region, and excludes Cornwall, which it describes as being &quot;the last of the Celtic areas to be incorporated into Wessex&quot;, and retaining its own identity, as well as a nationalist party, Mebyon Kernow. The assembly has variously been described as having a rotating location in the style of the Anglo-Saxon &quot;Witenagemot&quot; and as being based in Winchester, which had been the capital of the ancient kingdom of Wessex. The assembly would take power from Parliament in Westminster rather than from local authorities.

In light of UK government recognition of the Cornish people as a national minority under a European treaty, the party called for greater protection of local produce and what it described as the &quot;Wessex dialect&quot;. The party believes that the Wessex region has a distinct cultural identity, which it seeks to promote. It defines this culture as including morris dancing, cider, and the works of various local writers. The party was described in &quot;The Guardian&quot; as having a &quot;nostalgia for pre–industrial revolution England&quot;.

In 2010, party leader Colin Bex advocated a 100% tax rate on the top 10% of earners, with the revenue passed to parish councils.

<doc id="319085" wikidata="Q4720226" url="?curid=319085" title="Alexander Thynn, 7th Marquess of Bath">
<text>Alexander George Thynn, 7th Marquess of Bath (6 May 1932 – 4 April 2020), styled Viscount Weymouth between 1946 and 1992, was an English peer and landowner, owner of the Longleat estate, who sat in the House of Lords from 1992 until 1999, and an artist and author.

Lord Bath was in the media spotlight for his hippy fashion-sense and his many &quot;wifelets&quot;, the latter of which earned him the nickname &quot;the loins of Longleat&quot; in reference to his prodigious sexual appetites and the name of his estate, which includes a safari park that prominently markets its lions. The &quot;Sunday Times Rich List 2009&quot; gave him an estimated wealth of £157 million.

==Early life and education==
Thynn was born in London, the son of Henry Thynne, 6th Marquess of Bath and Daphne Fielding, and grew up at his family seat, Longleat, a grand Elizabethan house set in Wiltshire parkland landscaped in the 18th century by Capability Brown. After attending Ludgrove School and Eton College, he joined the Life Guards for National Service, being commissioned as a Lieutenant in 1951. He then went up to Christ Church, Oxford, where he was President of the Bullingdon Club, before embarking upon a modern-day European Grand Tour. During the 1950s, he studied art in Paris.

==Political career==
As Viscount Weymouth, he stood in the February 1974 General Election as a Wessex regionalist, believing that Wessex would be better off as a devolved region of the UK. Shortly after that General Election, he became one of the founders of the Wessex Regionalist Party. He stood for the party in the first ever elections to the European Parliament in 1979.

After succeeding to his father&#x27;s marquessate and other titles in 1992, Lord Bath sat in the House of Lords as a Liberal Democrat, until he lost his right to sit in the Upper House following New Labour&#x27;s House of Lords reforms which ousted all but 92 of the hereditary peers. Among other issues, he spoke in favour of devolution for the regions of England.

==Personal life==

In 1969, Thynn married Hungarian-born Anna Gyarmathy, also known as Anna Gaël, by whom he had two children, Lady Lenka Abigail Thynn and Ceawlin, 8th Marquess of Bath, both of whom were educated at comprehensive school. Lord Bath also acknowledged an illegitimate daughter born . He had open sexual relations with over seventy women during his marriage, many of whom lived in &quot;grace and favour&quot; in estate cottages. Lord Bath referred to his mistresses as &quot;wifelets&quot;. According to &quot;The Times&quot; (2015): &quot;The wifelets have included former Bond girls and Sri Lankan teenagers, as well as housewives and, according to some, prostitutes.&quot;

Born with the family name Thynne, he dropped the &quot;e&quot; in 1976, as he wanted to emphasise its correct pronunciation to rhyme with &quot;pin&quot; and not &quot;pine&quot;. He was known for his colourful style of dress, which he acquired while he was an art student in Paris, and was a prolific amateur painter who decorated rooms of his home with erotic scenes from the &quot;Kama Sutra&quot;.

After his father&#x27;s death in 1992, he dismissed his younger brother Lord Christopher Thynne as estate comptroller, evicting him from his home on the Longleat estate. In early 2010, he passed the management of the business to his son, then Viscount Weymouth. By one account, the Viscount intended to evict the mistresses from their estate cottages. Some of his father&#x27;s murals were removed, which caused a rift and led to a boycott by the Marquess of his son&#x27;s marriage to Emma McQuiston.

==Death==

Lord Bath was admitted to the Royal United Hospital, Bath, on 28 March 2020 and while in hospital tested positive for COVID-19 during the COVID-19 pandemic. He died of pneumonia whilst infected by the virus on 4 April 2020 at the age of 87.

==Appearances and media==
In 1999, Thynn appeared in series 6, episode 4 of &quot;Time Team&quot;, which dealt with the excavation of a cave in the Cheddar Gorge, an area of land owned by him. From 2000 to 2009, &quot;Animal Park&quot;, a television documentary about the life of keepers and animals at Longleat Safari Park, Wiltshire, England, aired over nine series on the BBC. It also covered the daily life of workers in Longleat House, the estate and the gardens and regularly featured items about Lord Bath himself.

In March 2009, he appeared in episode 4 of &quot;Heston&#x27;s Feasts&quot;. &quot;The Marquess of Bath&quot;, a book by Nesta Wyn Ellis, initially written with Bath&#x27;s co-operation, was published in the autumn of 2010. Lord Bath&#x27;s autobiography, collectively called &quot;Strictly Private to Public Exposure&quot;, was first published as a series by Artnik Books, and since 2002 has been republished by Top Spot Publishing. His other screen credits include an episode of &quot;Globe Trekker&quot;. He played an aristocrat in the music video for the Pet Shop Boys song &quot;Rent&quot;.

Artist and potter Grayson Perry interviewed the marquess in the third of his three-part 2012 documentary series &quot;All in the Best Possible Taste with Grayson Perry&quot; which focused on Britain&#x27;s upper class. In 2014, Thynn appeared in &quot;All Change at Longleat&quot;, a three-part documentary of some of the issues as he passed the running of the house to his son.

<text>A low-intensity conflict (LIC) is a military conflict, usually localised, between two or more state or non-state groups which is below the intensity of conventional war. It involves the state&#x27;s use of military forces applied selectively and with restraint to enforce compliance with its policies or objectives.

The term can be used to describe conflicts where at least one or both of the opposing parties operate along such lines.

==Official definitions==
===United States===
Low-intensity conflict is defined by the United States Army as:
The manual also says:
=== Relations with terrorism ===
Boaz Ganor notes that scholars once labeled terrorism as &quot;low-intensity warfare.&quot; However, this terminology has become obsolete due to the intricate nature of multidimensional warfare and the mass impact of contemporary terrorist attacks, such as the September 11 attacks.

==Implementation==
===Weapons===
As the name suggests, in comparison with conventional operations the armed forces involved operate at a greatly reduced tempo, with fewer soldiers, a reduced range of tactical equipment and limited scope to operate in a military manner. For example, the use of air power, pivotal in modern warfare, is often relegated to transport and surveillance, or used only by the dominant side of conflict in asymmetric warfare such as a government forces against insurgents. Artillery and multiple rocket launchers are often not used when LIC occurs in populated areas. The role of the armed forces is dependent on the stage of the insurrection, whether it has progressed to armed struggle or is in an early stage of propaganda and protests. Improvised explosive devices are commonly used by insurgents, militias and sometimes government forces such as barrel bombs in low intensity conflicts. The majority of casualties in low intensity conflicts tend to be resulting from small arms and improvised explosive devices.

===Intelligence===

Intelligence gathering is essential to an efficient basis of LIC operation instructions. Electronic and signal gathering intelligence, ELINT and SIGINT, proves largely ineffective against low-intensity opponents. LIC generally requires more &quot;hands-on&quot; HUMINT methods of information retrieval.

===Stages===

In the first stages of insurrection, much of an army&#x27;s work is &quot;soft&quot; – working in conjunction with civil authorities in psychological operations, propaganda, counter-organizing, so-called &quot;hearts and minds.&quot; If the conflict progresses, possibly into armed clashes, the role develops with the addition of the identification and removal of the armed groups – but again, at a low level, in communities rather than throughout entire cities.

==Examples==
===Burma===
Myanmar (Burma) has regularly conducted limited low-intensity military campaigns against the independence movement of the Karen people in an area of southeast Burma (roughly corresponding to a Burmese administrative region called the Kayin State), which has actively pursued independence since January 1949. While allegedly limited and low-intensity in that the territories occupied in force by central government forces are returned (as they cannot be held permanently as yet) at the end of the offensives (with the stated, but sometimes unstated, purpose of weakening the opposition and independence movements), human rights organizations and national governments outside of Burma question the veracity of, and sometimes outright refute, these claims.

===Sudan===
The governments of Sudan have also engaged in limited military offensives (analogous to Burma&#x27;s &quot;annual dry season offensives&quot;) against various armed opposition and independence movements, which have often escalated into full-scale warfare, particularly in the south and Darfur, but also until recently in the east. These military actions (First Sudanese Civil War and Second Sudanese Civil War) have, over time, continued to ravage the areas in dispute and contribute greatly to the poor conditions in those regions as well as the various human rights violations that have occurred (and in some cases are still occurring) there.

===German occupation of France===
German occupation of Western Europe during World War II, notably the occupation of France, shared many aspects with more recent cases of LIC, such as the &quot;Hearts and minds&quot; stage early on, establishment of puppet governments, strong propaganda aimed at isolating resistance movements, and support to domestic friendly forces (such as the Milice in France).

===German occupation of Poland===
In Poland from 1939 to 1945 there was a strong partisan movement. Partisan forces (mainly AK and BCh organizations), although less numerous than the German army, organized a strong resistance movement; in the years 1941-44 a successful action was carried out against the expulsion of Poles from the Zamość region. Besides, the &quot;Polish underground&quot; destroyed hundreds of German transports of military supplies throughout the war. In Poland there was also a secret order and many non-military resistance organizations like &quot;Zegota&quot; which helped thousands of Jews save their lives. When the Red Army entered Poland in 1944, the Poles wanted to support them in the fight against the Germans, but the Soviets betrayed them, even though during Operation Tempest, the partisans significantly accelerated the Russian attack, the Russians arrested or killed thousands of members of the Polish Underground State, nor did the Soviets also help support the Warsaw Uprising. In total, throughout the war, hundreds of thousands of people (up to 700,000) served in the ranks of the Polish underground, and even every sixth Pole helped polish partizants but partizantes did not have more than 50,000 firearms.

===Northern Ireland===
The conflict, known as The Troubles, was a sectarian and ethno-nationalistic conflict, fuelled by historical events and longstanding oppression by the UK&#x27;s military and security services. By the mid-1960s, the Northern Ireland civil rights movement began organizing Irish Catholics to protest, among other factors, disenfranchisement, abuses of power such as discrimination in the housing and job markets perpetuated by the ruling governments in the United Kingdom and its devolved subsidiary, known as Stormont. When these peaceful protests were met with brutal attacks by both the police and loyalist gangs given free rein to attack these protesters. On its face, it had a religious dimension although despite use of the terms &#x27;Protestant&#x27; and &#x27;Catholic&#x27; to refer to the two warring sides, it was not a religious conflict. For most, these were mostly just terms of identity. A key issue was the status of Northern Ireland. Unionists and loyalists, who descended from colonists who arrived during the Ulster Plantation, displacing all but a handful of native clans and farmers, were Ulster Protestants and wanted Northern Ireland to remain within the United Kingdom. Irish nationalists and republicans, who were mostly Irish Catholics, wanted to end the Partition of Ireland, leave the United Kingdom and reunite with the 26 counties that had formed the Republic of Ireland following partition.

The main participants in the Troubles were republican paramilitaries such as the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) and the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA); loyalist paramilitaries such as the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) and Ulster Defence Association (UDA); British state security forces such as the British Army, Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), Ulster Defense Regiment, MI5, and lesser known groups like the Force Research Unit; and political activists. The security forces of the Republic of Ireland played a smaller role. Republicans carried out a guerrilla campaign against British forces as well as a bombing campaign against infrastructural, commercial and political targets. Loyalists attacked occasionally republicans/nationalists, but focused primarily on the wider Catholic community in what they described as retaliation. At times, there were bouts of sectarian tit-for-tat violence, as well as feuds within and between paramilitary groups. The British security forces undertook policing and counter-insurgency, primarily against suspected republicans. This included the internment without trial of anyone accused of being, or supporting, Republicans. Investigations also revealed significant collusion between British state forces and loyalist paramilitaries, and furthermore loyalist paramilitaries such as the Glenanne gang included serving members of the Ulster Defense Regiment and Royal Ulster Constabulary.

==Guerrilla warfare==
Low-intensity warfare&#x27;s main opponent is the guerrilla, or irregular fighter. This opponent may be state sponsored, or private non-state actors driven by religious or other ideology in urban, semi-urban and rural areas. Modern guerrilla warfare at its fullest elaboration is an integrated process, complete with sophisticated doctrine, organization, specialist skills and propaganda capabilities. Guerrillas can operate as small, scattered bands of raiders, but they can also work side by side with regular forces or combine for far-ranging mobile operations in squad, platoon or battalion sizes or even form conventional units. Based on their level of sophistication and organization, they can shift between all those modes as the situation demands, as guerrilla warfare is flexible, not static.

Guerrilla tactics are based on intelligence, ambush, deception, sabotage, and espionage, undermining an authority by long, low-intensity confrontation. It can be quite successful against an unpopular foreign or local regime, as demonstrated by the Vietnam War. A guerrilla army may increase the cost of maintaining an occupation or a colonial presence above what the foreign power may wish to bear. Against a local regime, guerrillas may make governance impossible by terror strikes and sabotage or even a combination of forces to depose their local enemies in conventional battle. Those tactics are useful in demoralizing an enemy and raising the morale of the guerrillas. In many cases, guerrilla tactics allow a small force to hold off a much larger and better equipped enemy for a long time, as in Russia&#x27;s Second Chechen War and the Second Seminole War fought in the swamps of Florida, United States. Guerrilla tactics and strategy are summarized below and are discussed extensively in standard reference works such as Mao&#x27;s &quot;On Guerrilla Warfare&quot;.

===Three-phase Maoist model===
====Mao/Giap approach====
Mao&#x27;s theory of people&#x27;s war divides warfare into three phases. In the first phase, the guerrillas gain the support of the population by attacking the machinery of government and distributing propaganda. In the second phase, escalating attacks are made on the government&#x27;s military and vital institutions. In the third phase, conventional fighting is used to seize cities, overthrow the government, and take control of the country. Mao&#x27;s seminal work &quot;On Guerrilla Warfare&quot;, has been widely distributed and applied, nowhere more successfully than in Vietnam, under the military leader and theorist Võ Nguyên Giáp. Giap&#x27;s &quot;People&#x27;s War, People&#x27;s Army&quot; closely followed the Maoist three-stage approach but with greater emphasis on flexible shifting between mobile and guerrilla warfare, and opportunities for a spontaneous &quot;general uprising&quot; of the masses, in conjunction with guerrilla forces.

===Organization===
Guerrilla organization can range from small local rebel groups with a few dozen participants to tens of thousands of fighters, deploying from tiny cells to formations of regimental strength. In most cases, there is a leadership aiming for a clear political objective. The organization is typically structured into political and military wings, sometimes allowing the political leadership plausible deniability of military attacks. The most fully elaborated guerrilla warfare structure was seen by the Chinese and Vietnamese communists during the revolutionary wars of East and Southeast Asia.

A simplified example of this more sophisticated organizational type, which was used by revolutionary forces during the Vietnam War, is shown below.

===Types of operations===

Guerrilla operations typically include a variety of attacks on transportation routes, individual groups of police or military, installations and structures, economic enterprises, and targeted civilians. Attacking in small groups and using camouflage and often captured weapons of that enemy, the guerrilla force can constantly keep pressure on its foes and diminish its numbers and still allow escape with relatively few casualties. The intention of such attacks is only military but also political in aiming to demoralize target populations or governments or by goading an overreaction that forces the population to take sides for or against the guerrillas. Examples range from chopping off limbs in various internal African rebellions to the suicide bombings of Palestine and Sri Lanka to sophisticated maneuvers by Viet Cong and NVA forces against military bases and formations.

===Surprise and intelligence===

For successful operations, surprise must be achieved by guerrillas. If the operation has been betrayed or compromised, it is usually called off immediately. Intelligence is also extremely important, and detailed knowledge of the target&#x27;s dispositions, weaponry, and morale is gathered before any attack. Intelligence can be harvested in several ways. Collaborators and sympathizers usually provide a steady flow of useful information. If working clandestinely, guerrilla operatives may disguise their membership in the insurgent operation and use deception to ferret out needed data. Employment or enrollment as a student may be undertaken near the target zone, community organizations may be infiltrated, and even romantic relationships struck up in intelligence gathering. Public sources of information are also invaluable to the guerrilla, from the flight schedules of targeted airlines, to public announcements of visiting foreign dignitaries, to US Army Field Manuals. Modern computer access via the World Wide Web makes harvesting and collation of such data relatively easy. The use of on the spot reconnaissance is integral to operational planning. Operatives will &quot;case&quot; or analyze a location or potential target in depth- cataloging routes of entry and exit, building structures, the location of phones and communication lines, the presence of security personnel, and a myriad of other factors. Finally, intelligence is concerned with political factors such as the occurrence of an election or the impact of the potential operation on civilian and enemy morale.

===Relationships with the civil population===
Relationships with civil populations are influenced by whether the guerrillas operate among a hostile or friendly population. A friendly population is of immense importance to guerrillas, providing shelter, supplies, financing, intelligence, and recruits. The &quot;base of the people&quot; is thus the key lifeline of the guerrilla movement. In the early stages of the Vietnam War, American officials &quot;discovered that several thousand supposedly government-controlled &#x27;fortified hamlets&#x27; were in fact controlled by Viet Cong guerrillas, who &#x27;often used them for supply and rest havens.&#x27;&quot; Popular mass support in a confined local area or country, however, is not always strictly necessary. Guerrilla and revolutionary groups can still operate by using the protection of a friendly regime, drawing supplies, weapons, intelligence, local security, and diplomatic cover. The Al Qaeda organization is an example of the latter type, drawing sympathizers and support primarily from the wide-ranging Muslim world, even after American attacks eliminated the umbrella of a friendly Taliban regime in Afghanistan.

An apathetic or hostile population makes life difficult for guerrillas, and strenuous attempts are usually made to gain their support. They may involve not only persuasion but also a calculated policy of intimidation. Guerrilla forces may characterize a variety of operations as a liberation struggle, but that may or may not result in sufficient support from affected civilians. Other factors, including ethnic and religious hatreds, can make a simple national liberation claim untenable. Whatever the exact mix of persuasion or coercion used by guerrillas, relationships with civil populations are one of the most important factors in their success or failure.

===Use of terror===
Terror is used to focus international attention on the guerrilla cause, liquidate opposition leaders, extort cash from targets, intimidate the general population, create economic losses, and keep followers and potential defectors in line. The widespread use of terror by guerrillas and their opponents is a common feature of modern guerrilla conflicts, with civilians attempting to mollify both sides. At times, a civil population may be the main targets of guerrilla attacks, as in Palestinian operations against Israeli civilians. Such tactics may backfire and cause the civil population to withdraw its support or to back countervailing forces against the guerrillas.

===Withdrawal===
Guerrillas must plan carefully for withdrawal once an operation has been completed or if it is going badly. The withdrawal phase is sometimes regarded as the most important part of a planned action, as getting entangled in a lengthy struggle with superior forces is usually fatal to insurgent, terrorist or revolutionary operatives. Withdrawal is usually accomplished using a variety of different routes and methods and may include quickly the scouring of the area for loose weapons, the cleaning-up of evidence, and the disguising as peaceful civilians. In the case of suicide operations, withdrawal considerations by successful attackers are moot, but such activity as eliminating traces of evidence and hiding materials and supplies must still be done.

===Logistics===
Guerrillas typically operate with a smaller logistical footprint than to conventional formations, but their logistical activities can be elaborately organized. A primary consideration is to avoid depending on fixed bases and depots, which are comparatively easy for conventional units to locate and destroy. Mobility and speed are the keys; wherever possible, the guerrilla must live off the land or draw support from the civil population in which it is embedded. In that sense, &quot;the people&quot; become the guerrilla&#x27;s supply base. The financing of terrorist or guerrilla activities ranges from direct individual contributions (voluntary or non-voluntary) to the actual operation of business enterprises by insurgent operatives to bank robberies and kidnappings to the complex financial networks that are based on kin, ethnic and religious affiliation used by modern jihadist/jihad organizations.

Permanent and semi-permanent bases form part of the guerrilla logistical structure, which are usually located in remote areas or in cross-border sanctuaries that are sheltered by friendly regimes. They can be quite elaborate, such as in the tough VC/NVA fortified base camps and tunnel complexes encountered by US forces during the Vietnam War. Their importance can be seen by the hard fighting sometimes engaged in by communist forces to protect those sites. However, when it became clear that defense was untenable, communist units typically withdrew without sentiment.

===Terrain===

Guerrilla warfare is often associated with a rural setting, which was indeed the case with the definitive operations of Mao and Giap, and the mujahideen of Afghanistan. Guerrillas, however, have successfully operated in urban settings, such as in Argentina and Cyprus. In both cases, guerrillas rely on a friendly population to provide supplies and intelligence. Rural guerrillas prefer to operate in regions providing plenty of cover and concealment, especially heavily forested and mountainous areas. Urban guerrillas, rather than melting into the mountains and jungles, blend into the population and also depend on a support base among the people. Rooting guerrillas out of both types of areas can be difficult.

===Foreign support and sanctuaries===
Foreign support in the form of soldiers, weapons, sanctuary, or statements of sympathy for guerrillas is not strictly necessary, but it can greatly increase the chances of an insurgent victory. Foreign diplomatic support may bring the guerrilla cause to international attention, putting pressure on local opponents to make concessions or garnering sympathetic support and material assistance. Foreign sanctuaries can add heavily to guerrilla chances, furnishing weapons, supplies, materials, and training bases. Such shelter can benefit from international law, particularly if the sponsoring regime is successful in concealing its support and in claiming plausible deniability for attacks that are by operatives based in its territory.

The VC and NVA made extensive use of such international sanctuaries during their conflict, and the complex of trails, way-stations and bases snaking through Laos and Cambodia (the famous Ho Chi Minh Trail) was the logistical lifeline that sustained their forces in South Vietnam. Another case in point is the Mukti Bahini guerrillas, who fought alongside the Indian Army in the 14-day Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971 against Pakistan, which led to the independence of Bangladesh. In the post-Vietnam era, al-Qaeda also made effective use of remote territories, such as Afghanistan under the Taliban regime, to plan and execute its operations. That foreign sanctuary eventually broke down with American attacks against the Taliban and al-Qaeda after the September 11 attacks.

===Guerrilla initiative and combat intensity===
Since they can choose when and where to strike, guerrillas usually have the tactical initiative and the element of surprise. The planning for an operation may take weeks, months, or even years with a constant series of cancelations and restarts, as the situation changes. Careful rehearsals and &quot;dry runs&quot; are usually conducted to work out problems and details. Many guerrilla strikes are not undertaken unless clear numerical superiority can be achieved in the target area, a pattern typical of VC/NVA and other &quot;people&#x27;s war&quot; operations. Individual suicide bomb attacks offer another pattern, typically involving only the individual bomber and his support team, but they too are spread or metered out based on prevailing capabilities and political winds.

Whatever approach is used, the guerrilla holds the initiative and can prolong his survival by varying the intensity of combat. Attacks are spread out over quite a range of time, from weeks to years. During the interim periods, the guerrilla can rebuild, resupply, and plan. During the Vietnam War, most communist units, including mobile NVA regulars using guerrilla tactics, spent only a few days per month fighting. While they might be forced into an unwanted battle by an enemy sweep, most of the time was spent in training, intelligence gathering, political and civic infiltration, propaganda indoctrination, construction of fortifications, or foraging for supplies and food. The large numbers of such groups striking at different times, however, gave the war its &quot;around-the-clock&quot; quality.

==Low-intensity counter operations or counter-guerrilla warfare==
===Principles===
The low-intensity fighter or guerrilla can be difficult to beat, but certain principles of counter-insurgency warfare are well known since the 1950s and 1960s and have been successfully applied.

====Classic guidelines====

The widely distributed and influential work of Sir Robert Thompson, counter-insurgency expert in Malaysia, offers several such guidelines. Thompson&#x27;s underlying assumption is that of a country minimally committed to the rule of law and better governance. Numerous other regimes, however, give such considerations short shrift, and their counterguerrilla operations have involved mass murder, genocide, starvation as well as the massive spread of terror, torture and execution. The totalitarian regimes of Stalin and Hitler are classic examples, as are the lesser but comparable measures of dictatorships fighting &quot;dirty wars&quot; in South America. Elements of Thompson&#x27;s moderate approach are adapted here:
#A viable competing vision that comprehensively mobilizes popular support. There must be a clear political counter-vision, which can overshadow, match, or neutralize the guerrilla vision. That can range from granting political autonomy to economic development measures in the affected region. The vision must be integrated approach, involving political, social, and economic and media influence measures.
#Reasonable concessions where necessary. Action also must be taken at a lower level to resolve legitimate grievances. It may be tempting for the counter-insurgent side simply to declare guerrillas &quot;terrorists&quot; and to pursue a harsh liquidation strategy. Brute force, however, may not be successful in the long run. Action does not mean capitulation, but sincere steps, such as removing corrupt or arbitrary officials, cleaning up fraud, or collecting taxes honestly can do much to undermine the guerrillas&#x27; appeal. 
#Economy of force. The counter-insurgent regime must not overreact to guerrilla provocations, which may indeed be what the guerrilla seeks to create a crisis in the civilian morale. Police level actions should guide the effort and take place in a clear framework of legality, even if under a state of emergency. Civil liberties and other customs of peacetime may have to be suspended, but again, the counter-insurgent regime must exercise restraint and cleave to orderly procedures. Clear steps must be taken to curb brutality and retaliation by the security or &quot;freelance&quot; forces.
#Big unit action may sometimes be necessary. If police action is not sufficient to stop insurgents, military sweeps may be necessary. Such &quot;big battalion&quot; operations may be needed to break up significant guerrilla concentrations and split them into small groups that can be controlled by combined civic-military action.
#Mobility. Mobility and aggressive small unit action is extremely important for the counter-insurgent regime. Heavy formations must be lightened to aggressively locate, pursue, and fix insurgent units. Huddling in static strongpoints simply concedes the field to the insurgents, who must be kept on the run constantly by aggressive patrols, raids, ambushes, sweeps, cordons, etc. 
#Systematic intelligence effort. Every effort must be made to gather and organize useful intelligence. A systematic process must be set up to do so, ranging from casual questioning of civilians to structured interrogations of prisoners. Creative measures must also be used, including the use of double agents or even bogus &quot;liberation&quot; or sympathizer groups to help reveal insurgent personnel or operations.
#Methodical clear and hold. An &quot;ink spot&quot; clear and hold strategy must be used by the counter-insurgent regime, which divides the conflict area into sectors and assigns priorities between them. Control must expand outward like an ink spot on paper, systematically neutralizing and eliminating the insurgents in one sector of the grid, before proceeding to the next. It may be necessary to pursue holding or defensive actions elsewhere while priority areas are cleared and held.
#Careful deployment of mass popular forces and special units. Specialist units can be used profitably, including commando squads, long range reconnaissance, &quot;hunter-killer&quot; patrols, defectors who can track or persuade their former colleagues like the Kit Carson units in Vietnam, and paramilitary style groups. Strict control must be kept over specialist units to prevent the emergence of violent vigilante-style reprisal squads that undermine the government&#x27;s program. Mass forces include village self-defence groups and citizen militias organized for local defence and security.
#Foreign assistance must be limited and carefully used. Such aid should be limited to material and technical support and small cadres of specialists. Unless that is done, the foreign helper may find itself &quot;taking over&quot; the local war and being sucked into a lengthy commitment, thus providing the guerrillas with valuable propaganda opportunities. Such a scenario occurred with the United States in Vietnam.

== Low-intensity operations ==
Low-intensity operations consist of the deployment and use of soldiers in situations other than war. For states, these operations are usually conducted against non-state actors and are given terms like counter-insurgency, anti-subversion, and peacekeeping. Violent non-state actors often conduct low-intensity operations against states, often in insurgencies.

<text>This article deals with the history of Tuscany.

&quot;Tuscany&quot; is named after its pre-Roman inhabitants, the Etruscans. It was ruled by Rome for many centuries. In the Middle Ages, it saw many invasions, but in the Renaissance period it helped lead Europe back to civilization. Later, it settled down as a grand duchy. It was conquered by Napoleonic France in the late 18th century and became part of the Italian Republic in the 19th century.

== Apennine, Proto-Villanovan and Villanovan culture ==

The pre-Etruscan history of the area in the middle and late Bronze parallels that of the archaic Greeks. The Tuscan area was inhabited by peoples of the so-called Apennine culture in the second millennium BC (roughly 1400–1150 BC) who had trading relationships with the Minoan and Mycenaean civilizations in the Aegean Sea, and, at the end of the Bronze Age, by peoples of the so-called of the Proto-Villanovan culture (c. 1100-900 BC) part of the central European Urnfield culture system. Following this, at the beginning of the Iron Age, the Villanovan culture (c. 900–700 BC), regarded as the oldest phase of Etruscan civilization, saw Tuscany, and the rest of Etruria, taken over by chiefdoms. City-states developed in the late Villanovan (paralleling Greece and the Aegean) before &quot;Orientalization&quot; occurred.

== Etruscan period ==

The Etruscans were the first major civilization in this region; large enough to lay down a transport infrastructure, implement agriculture and mining, and produce vivid art. The Etruscans lived in Etruria well into prehistory. The civilization grew to fill the area between the Arno River and Tiber River from the 10th century, reaching their peak during the 7th century BC and 6th century BC, finally succumbing to the Romans by the first century. Despite being seen as distinct in its manners and customs by contemporary Greeks, the cultures of Greece, and later Rome, influenced the civilisation to a great extent. One reason for its eventual demise was this increasing absorption by surrounding cultures, including the adoption of the Etruscan upper class by the Romans.

== Roman period ==
Soon after absorbing Etruria, Rome established the cities of Lucca, Pisa, Siena, and Florence, endowed the area with new technologies and development, and ensured peace. These developments included extensions of existing roads, introduction of aqueducts and sewers, and the construction of many buildings, both public and private. The Roman civilization in the West collapsed in the fifth century and the region was left to the Goths, and others. In the sixth century, the Longobards arrived and designated Lucca the capital of their Duchy of Tuscia.

==Middle Ages==
After the fall of the Western Roman Empire the region went under the Ostrogoth and Byzantine dominations, before the Lombard conquest in 569. Tuscany was made a Duchy, known as Duchy of Tuscia, having its seat in Lucca. After the destruction of the Lombard kingdom by Charlemagne, it became a county first, and then a march. In the 11th century the marquisate went to the Attoni family from Canossa, who also held Modena, Reggio Emilia and Mantua. Matilda of Canossa was their most famous member.

In this period Tuscany acquired many castles, abbeys and monasteries, while the main towns started again to grow demographically, turning themselves into communes mostly independent from the Holy Roman Empire. Lucca was in fact the first commune in Italy; the other most important ones were Arezzo, Florence, Siena and Pisa, often struggling between each other. The south of current Tuscany (roughly identifiable with the modern province of Grosseto) was instead a feudal dominion of the Aldobrandeschi family.

Pilgrims travelling along the Via Francigena between Rome and France brought wealth and development during the Middle Ages. The food and shelter required by these travellers fuelled the growth of communities around churches and taverns.

In the 11th century Pisa became the most powerful of them, building a trade (as well as colonial) empire in the Mediterranean and playing a key role in the Crusades. Banking, soon turned into an international activity with branches in Flanders, France and England, was instead the main resource of Florence, Siena and Lucca. The latter was also an important center for silk production.

Pisa began to decline in the 13th/14th centuries after its defeat by Genoa at the Battle of Meloria. After its conquest of Arezzo and Pisa, by the early 15th century Florence had gained a prominent role in Tuscany, as well as in Italy, and was also the cultural capital of the region. Its only remaining rival in Tuscany was Siena.

== Republican governments, c. 1000–1805 ==

=== Republic of Pisa, c. 1000–1406 ===
From its creation to the year 1189, the republic was governed by consuls. From 1190 the Republic of Pisa adopted the Podestà as its head of state; however, for some periods citizens elected as consuls also operated. In 1254, after a popular revolt, the maritime republic held the creation of the captaincy and the &quot;council of the elders&quot;, but the most important institutional figure remained that of the podestà.

=== Republic of Florence, 1115–1434 ===
Before becoming a de facto monarchy ruled by the powerful Medici family, the Florentine Republic adopted various forms of republican government. In 1172 the Florentines elected their first Consuls: Giovanni di Uguccione Giandonati, Importuno, Truffetto dei Fifanti and Ormanno Caponsacchi. While in 1207 it was elected their first Podestà, Gualfredotto Grasselli. In 1293 the republic elected its first Gonfaloniere of Justice, Giano della Bella. Republican rule came to an end with the arrival of the Medici to power in 1434, with Cosimo de&#x27; Medici as the first Lord of the city-state.

=== Republic of Siena, 1125–1555 ===
Following the deposition of the bishop who governed the city, the Sienese elected the consuls as the first head of state. In 1199 they held the election of their first Podestà, while in the following centuries the governments were led by members of the council of the Republic, the most notable being the Noveschi. From a short period, from 1399 to 1404 it was also ruled by the Visconti of Milan. The republican government was suppressed for good with the Siena&#x27;s loss of independence to the then increasingly powerful Florentine Republic.

=== Republic of Lucca, 1160–1805 ===
The Republic of Lucca, the only republic which managed to remain independent until the early modern period in the history of Tuscany, and along with Genoa and Venice, in the history of Italy, it was consequently one of the most enduring states of all Italian city-states. The republic, was ruled by the Gonfaloniere, and its deliberative bodies were the &quot;Maggior Consiglio&quot; (Great Council), the &quot;Minor Consiglio&quot; (Minor Council) and the Council of the Elders (with ten members).

== Renaissance period ==
Though &quot;Tuscany&quot; remained a linguistic, cultural and geographic conception, rather than a political reality, in the 15th century, Florence extended dominion in Tuscany through the annexion of Arezzo in 1384, the purchase of Pisa in 1405 and the suppression of a local resistance there (1406). Livorno was bought in 1421 and become the harbour of Florence.

In the leading city of Florence, the republic was from 1434 onward dominated by the increasingly monarchical Medici family. Initially, under Cosimo the Elder, Piero the Gouty, Lorenzo the Magnificent and Piero the Unfortunate, the forms of the republic were retained and the Medici ruled without a title, usually without even a formal office. These rulers presided over the Florentine Renaissance.

There was a return to the republic from 1494 to 1512, when first Girolamo Savonarola then Piero Soderini oversaw the state. Cardinal Giovanni de&#x27; Medici retook the city with Spanish forces in 1512, before going to Rome to become Pope Leo X. Florence was dominated by a series of papal proxies until 1527 when the citizens declared the republic again, only to have it taken from them again in 1530 after a siege by an Imperial and Spanish army. At this point Pope Clement VII and Charles V appointed Alessandro de&#x27; Medici as the first formally hereditary ruler.

The Sienese commune was not incorporated into Tuscany until 1555, and during the 15th century Siena enjoyed a cultural &#x27;Sienese Renaissance&#x27; with its own more conservative character. Lucca remained an independent Republic until 1847 when it became part of Grand Duchy of Tuscany by the will of its people. Piombino was another minor state that was not part of the Grand Duchy, but under both Spanish and Tuscan influence.

== Grand Duchy of Tuscany ==

For most of the 16th century the Medici ruled Florence and Tuscany quite successfully, expanding the state&#x27;s territory greatly by acquiring Siena. The Medici were patrons of science and the arts which flowered for much of their reign. Tuscany became a more cohesive and unified state during these years, rather than simply the dominion of a dominating city, Florence.

As time went on, Tuscany was transformed in a number of ways, not always positively. Most importantly, the economy underwent a fundamental change in character. The wool industry was decimated during these later years, though the silk industry was, to some extent, able to replace it. Nonetheless, industry, which had shaped and sustained Florence since the Middle Ages, began to decline throughout the 17th century. Investment in business became less lucrative and there was some &quot;re-feudalization&quot; of the Tuscan state with many patricians investing in land instead of industry. Tuscany is generally agreed to have declined greatly by the early 18th century under a series of inept grand dukes.

After the House of Medici died out, Francis I, a cognatic descendant of the dynasty, succeeded the family and ascended the throne of Grand Duchy, placing the state under the sovereignty of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine.

Known in Italy as Pietro Leopoldo, Leopold I was the only progressive reformer to rule Tuscany. He abolished the last vestiges of serfdom, encouraged trade and industry, and reformed the bureaucracy. During his long reign Tuscany became one of the most prosperous states in Italy. On 30 November 1786, he promulgated a penal reform making Tuscany the first sovereign state to abolish the death penalty. In this time period Tuscany was also known as a &quot;Guild&quot;.

Ferdinand III was deposed by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1801 so that Tuscany could be given to the Bourbon Dukes of Parma as compensation for the loss of their duchy. During this brief period, the Grand Duchy of Tuscany was known as the Kingdom of Etruria.

Tuscany/Etruria was annexed by Napoleonic France in 1807. In 1809 Napoleon gave his sister Elisa Bonaparte the honorary title of Grand Duchess of Tuscany. In 1814, after Napoleon&#x27;s downfall, Ferdinand III was restored as grand duke. However, in 1815, the Congress of Vienna separated the Duchy of Lucca from Tuscany to give to the Bourbons of Parma in compensation for other losses. (Lucca would be reintegrated into Tuscany in 1847.)

== Kingdom of Italy ==

In 1861 Tuscany became part of modern Italy. Florence replaced Turin as Italy&#x27;s capital in 1865, hosting the country&#x27;s first parliament, and was superseded by Rome six years later, in 1871.
