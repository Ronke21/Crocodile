<text>The Dow Chemical Company is an American multinational corporation headquartered in Midland, Michigan, United States. The company was among the three largest chemical producers in the world in 2021. It is the operating subsidiary of Dow Inc., a publicly traded holding company incorporated under Delaware law.

With a presence in around 160 countries, it employs about 36,000 people worldwide. Dow has been called the &quot;chemical companies&#x27; chemical company&quot;, as its sales are to other industries rather than directly to end-use consumers. Dow is a member of the American Chemistry Council.

In 2015, Dow and fellow chemical company DuPont agreed to a corporate reorganization involving the merger of Dow and DuPont followed by a separation into three different entities. The plan commenced in 2017, when Dow and DuPont merged to form DowDuPont, and was finalized in April 2019, when the materials science division was spun off from DowDuPont and took the name of the Dow Chemical Company.

== History ==

===Early history===
Dow was founded in 1897 by chemist Herbert Henry Dow, who invented a new method of extracting the bromine that was trapped underground in brine at Midland, Michigan. The company originally sold only bleach and potassium bromide, achieving a bleach output of 72 tons a day in 1902. Early in the company&#x27;s history, a group of British manufacturers tried to drive Dow out of the bleach business by cutting prices. Dow survived by also cutting its prices and, although losing about $90,000 in income, began to diversify its product line.

In 1905, German bromide producers began dumping bromides at low cost in the U.S. in an effort to prevent Dow from expanding its sales of bromides in Europe. Instead of competing directly for market share with the German producers, Dow bought the cheap German-made bromides and shipped them back to Europe. This undercut his German competitors. Even in its early history, Dow set a tradition of rapidly diversifying its product line. Within twenty years, Dow had become a major producer of agricultural chemicals, elemental chlorine, phenol and other dyestuffs, and magnesium metal.

During World War I, Dow supplied many war materials that the United States had previously imported from Germany. Dow produced magnesium for incendiary flares, monochlorobenzene and phenol for explosives, and bromine for medicines and tear gas. By 1918, 90 percent of Dow&#x27;s production was geared towards the war effort. At this time, Dow created the diamond logo that is still used by the company. After the war, Dow continued research in magnesium, and it developed refined automobile pistons that produced more speed and better fuel efficiency. The Dowmetal pistons were used heavily in racing vehicles, and the 1921 winner of the Indianapolis 500 used the Dowmetal pistons in his vehicle.

In the 1930s, Dow began producing plastic resins, which would grow to become one of the corporation&#x27;s major businesses. Its first plastic products were ethylcellulose, made in 1935, and polystyrene, made in 1937.

===Diversification and expansion===
From 1940 to 1941, Dow built its first plant in Freeport, Texas, to produce magnesium extracted from seawater rather than underground brine. The Freeport plant is Dow&#x27;s largest site, and the largest integrated chemical manufacturing site in the country. The site grew quickly – with power, chlorine, caustic soda and ethylene also soon in production. Growth of this business made Dow a strategic company during World War II, as magnesium became important to manufacture lightweight parts for aircraft. Based on 2002–2003 data, the Freeport plants produced 27 billion lbs of product – or 21% of Dow&#x27;s global production. In 1942, Dow began its foreign expansion with the formation of Dow Chemical of Canada in Sarnia, Ontario, to produce styrene for use in styrene-butadiene synthetic rubber. Also during the war, Dow and Corning began their joint venture, Dow Corning, to produce silicones for military and, later, civilian use.

The Ethyl-Dow Chemical Co. plant at Kure&#x27;s Beach, NC, the only plant on the East Coast producing bromine from seawater, was attacked by a German U-boat in 1942.

In the post-war era, Dow began expanding outside of North America, founding its first overseas subsidiary in Japan in 1952, and in several other nations soon thereafter. Based largely on its growing plastics business, Dow opened a consumer products division, beginning with Saran wrap in 1953. Based on its growing chemicals and plastics businesses, Dow&#x27;s sales exceeded $1 billion in 1964 and $2 billion in 1971.

===Nuclear weapons===
From 1951 to 1975, Dow managed the Rocky Flats Plant near Denver, Colorado. Rocky Flats was a nuclear weapons production facility that produced plutonium triggers for hydrogen bombs.

Contamination from fires and radioactive waste leakage plagued the facility under Dow&#x27;s management. In 1957 a fire burned plutonium dust in the facility and sent radioactive particles into the atmosphere.

The Department of Energy transferred management of the facility to Rockwell International in 1975. In 1990, nearby residents filed a class action lawsuit against Dow and Rockwell for environmental contamination of the area; the case was settled in 2017 for $375 million. According to the Appellate Court, the owners of the 12,000 properties in the class-action area had not proved that their properties were damaged or they had suffered bodily injury.

===Vietnam War: napalm and Agent Orange===

The United States military used napalm bombs during the Vietnam War until 1973. Dow was one of several manufacturers who began producing the napalm B compound under government contract from 1965. After experiencing protests and negative publicity, the other suppliers discontinued manufacturing the product, leaving Dow as the sole provider. The company said that it carefully considered its position, and decided, as a matter of principle, &quot;its first obligation was to the government&quot;. Despite a boycott of its products by anti-war groups and harassment of recruiters on some college campuses, Dow continued to manufacture napalm B until 1969.

Agent Orange, a chemical defoliant containing dioxin, was also manufactured by Dow in New Plymouth, New Zealand, and Midland, Michigan, in the United States for use by the British military during the Malayan Emergency and the U.S. military during the Vietnam War. In 2005, a lawsuit was filed by Vietnamese victims of Agent Orange against Dow and Monsanto Co., which also supplied Agent Orange to the military. The lawsuit was dismissed. In 2012, Monsanto agreed to a $93 million settlement as a result of a case pursued by ex-Monsanto employees and citizens in the city of Nitro, WV. In 1949, a chemical plant in Nitro experienced an explosion that damaged a tank containing 2,4,5-T, one of the composites that is used in the production of Agent Orange. The settlement of the case included $9 million for the cleanup of affected homes in the area, and $84 million to cover the medical monitoring and treatment of people affected by the explosion, as well as legal costs for the claimants. No care has been given for the in state damage done by the Headquarters in Midland, Michigan, and they refuse to give the evidence to the community.

===Dow Corning breast implants===
A major manufacturer of silicone breast implants, Dow Corning (Dow Chemical&#x27;s Joint Venture with Corning Inc.) was sued for personal damages caused by ruptured implants. On 6 October 2005, all such cases pending in the District Court against the company were dismissed. A number of large, independent reviews of the scientific literature, including the Institute of Medicine in the United States, have subsequently found that silicone breast implants do not cause breast cancers or any identifiable systemic disease.

===Bhopal disaster===

The Bhopal disaster occurred at a pesticide plant owned by Union Carbide India Ltd., a subsidiary of Union Carbide, in 1984. A gas cloud containing methyl isocyanate and other chemicals spread to the neighborhoods near the plant where more than half a million people lived. The government of Madhya Pradesh confirmed 3,787 deaths related to the gas release. The leak caused 558,125 injuries, including 38,478 temporary partial injuries and approximately 3,900 severely and permanently disabling injuries. Union Carbide was sued by the Government of India and agreed to an out-of-court settlement of US$470 million in 1989. Dow Chemical acquired Union Carbide in 2001. Activists want Dow Chemical to clean up the site which is now controlled by the state of Madhya Pradesh.

===DBCP===
Until the late 1970s, Dow produced DBCP (1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane), a soil fumigant, and nematicide, sold under the names the Nemagon and Fumazone. Plantation workers who alleged that they became sterile or were stricken with other maladies subsequently sued both Dow and Dole Foods in Latin American courts. The cases were marred by extensive fraud, including the falsification of test results and the recruitment of plaintiffs who had never worked at Dole plantations. While Nicaraguan courts awarded the plaintiffs over $600 million in damages, they have been unable to collect any payment from the companies. A group of plaintiffs then sued in the United States, and, on 5 November 2007, a Los Angeles jury awarded them $3.2 million. Dole and Dow vowed to appeal the decision. On 23 April 2009 a Los Angeles judge threw out two cases against Dole and Dow due to fraud and extortion by lawyers in Nicaragua recruiting fraudulent plaintiffs to make claims against the company. The ruling casts doubt on $2 billion in judgments in similar lawsuits.

===Tax evasion===

In February 2013 a federal court rejected two tax shelter transactions entered into by Dow that created approximately $1 billion in tax deductions between 1993 and 2003. The court wrote that the transactions were &quot;schemes that were designed to exploit perceived weaknesses in the tax code and not designed for legitimate business reasons&quot;. The schemes were created by Goldman Sachs and the law firm of King &amp; Spalding, and involved creating a partnership that Dow operated out of its European headquarters in Switzerland. Dow stated that it had paid all tax assessments with interest. The case was against the Internal Revenue Service seeking a refund of the taxes paid. The case was appealed to the 5th Circuit court, where Dow&#x27;s claims were again rejected. Dow has petitioned for an en banc hearing by the 5th Circuit, arguing that the decision was contrary to established case law.

===Price fixing===

Dow Chemical was implicated in a price-fixing scheme that inflated the cost of polyurethane for customers. The U.S. Justice Department closed an investigation in 2007 without charges or recommendations, but a class-action civil lawsuit won at a jury trial in 2013. Dow settled the suit in 2016 for $835 million.

===Recent mergers, acquisitions and reorganization===
====1990s – transition from geographic alignment to global business units====
In the early 1990s, Dow embarked on a major structural reorganization. The former reporting hierarchy was geographically based, with the regional president reporting directly to the overall company president and CEO. The new organization combines the same businesses from different sites, irrespective of which region they belong (i.e. the vice president for Polystyrene is now in charge of these plants all over the world).

====Union Carbide merger====
At the beginning of August 1999, Dow agreed to purchase Union Carbide Corp. (UCC) for $9.3 billion in stock. At the time, the combined company was the second largest chemical company, behind DuPont. This led to protests from some stockholders, who feared that Dow did not disclose potential liabilities related to the Bhopal disaster.

William S. Stavropoulos served as president and chief executive officer of Dow from 1995 to 2000, then again from 2002 to 2004. He relinquished his board seat on 1 April 2006, having been a director since 1990 and chairman since 2000. During his first tenure, he led the purchase of UCC, which proved controversial, as it was blamed for poor results under his successor as chief executive officer, Mike Parker. Parker was dismissed and Stavropoulos returned from retirement to lead Dow.

==== 2006–2008 restructuring ====
On 31 August 2006, Dow announced that it planned to close facilities at five locations:
* Sarnia, Ontario was Dow&#x27;s first manufacturing site in Canada, located in the Chemical Valley area alongside other petrochemical companies. In 1942, the Canadian government invited Dow to build a plant there to produce styrene (an essential raw material used to make synthetic rubber for World War II). Dow then built a polystyrene plant in 1947. In August 1985, the site accidentally discharged 11,000 litres of perchloroethylene (a dry cleaning solvent) into the St. Clair River, which gained infamy in the media as &quot;The Blob&quot;, and Dow Canada was charged by the Ministry of the Environment. Up to the early 1990s, Dow Canada&#x27;s headquarters was located at the Modeland Centre, and a new three-story complex called the River Centre was opened up on the Sarnia site in 1993 to house Research and Development. Since then, several plants (Dow terminology for a production unit) on the site have been dismantled, particularly the Basic Chemicals including Chlor Alkali unit whose closure was announced in 1991 and carried out in 1994 which affected nearly half of the site&#x27;s employees. The Dow Canada headquarters were moved to Calgary, Alberta in 1996, and the Modeland Centre was sold to Lambton County and the City of Sarnia with Dow leasing some office space. The Dow Fitness Centre was donated to the YMCA of Sarnia-Lambton in 2003. The Sarnia Site&#x27;s workforce declined from a peak of 1600 personnel in the early 1990s to about 400 by 2002. In the late 1990s, land on the site was sold to TransAlta which built a natural gas power plant that begun operations in 2002 to supply electricity to the remaining Sarnia site plants and facilities, so that Dow could close its older less efficient steam plant (originally coal fired and later burning natural gas). On 31 August 2006, Dow announced that the entire Sarnia site would cease operations at the end of 2008. The Sarnia site had been supplied with ethylene through a pipeline from western Canada but BP officials warned Dow that shipments from the pipeline had to be suspended for safety reasons, and the loss of an affordable supply for the low density polyethylene plant rendered all the other operations at the site non-competitive. The Low-Density Polyethylene and Polystyrene units closed in 2006, followed by the Latex Unit in 2008, and finally the Propylene Oxide Derivatives Unit in April 2009. Dow afterward focused its efforts on the environmental remediation of the vacant site, which was sold to TransAlta. The former site has since been renamed the Bluewater Energy Park, with the River Centre remaining available for lease.
* One plant at its site in Barry (South Wales), a triple string STR styrene polymer production unit. Integral in the company&#x27;s development of the super high melt foam specific polymers &amp; Styron A-Tech high gloss, high impact polymers.
* One plant at its site in Porto Marghera (Venice), Italy.
* Two plants at its site in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta, Canada.

In 2006, Dow formed the Business Process Service Center (BPSC).

In December 2007, Dow announced a series of moves to revamp the company. A 4 December announcement revealed that Dow planned to exit the automotive sealers business in 2008 or 2009. Within several weeks, Dow also announced the formation of a joint venture, later named K-Dow, with Petrochemical Industries Co. (PIC), a subsidiary of Kuwait Petroleum Corporation. In exchange for $9.5 billion, the agreement included Dow selling 50-percent of its interest in five global businesses: polyethylene, polypropylene and polycarbonate plastics, and ethylenamines and ethanolamines. The agreement was terminated by PIC on 28 December 2008.

=====Rohm &amp; Haas Co. purchase=====
On 10 July 2008, Dow agreed to purchase all of the common equity interest of Rohm and Haas Co. for $15.4 billion, which equated to $78 per share. The buyout was financed with equity investments of $3 billion by Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and $1 billion by the Kuwait Investment Authority. The purpose of the deal was to move Dow Chemical further into specialty chemicals, which offer higher profit margins than the commodities market and are more difficult to enter for the competition. The purchase was criticized by many on Wall Street who believed Dow Chemical overpaid (about a 75 percent premium on the previous day&#x27;s market capital) to acquire the company; however, the high bid was needed to ward off competing bids from BASF. The transaction to purchase the outstanding interest of Rohm and Haas was closed on 1 April 2009.

=====Accelerated implementation=====
On 8 December 2008, Dow announced that due to the Financial crisis of 2007–2008, it would accelerate job cuts resulting from its reorganization. The announced plan included closing 20 facilities, temporarily idling 180 plants, and eliminating 5,000 full-time jobs (about 11 percent of its work-force) and 6,000 contractor positions.

=====Strategy interruption=====
Citing the global recession that began in the latter half of 2008, the Kuwaiti government scuttled the K-Dow partnership on 28 December 2008. The collapse of the deal dealt a blow to Dow CEO Andrew Liveris&#x27; vision of restructuring the company to make it less cyclical. However, on 6 January 2009 Dow Chemical announced they were in talks with other parties who could be interested in a major joint venture with the company. Dow also announced they that it would be seeking to recover damages related to the failed joint venture from PIC.

After the K-Dow deal collapsed, some speculated that the company would not complete the Rohm &amp; Haas transaction, as the cash from the former transaction was expected to fund the latter. The deal was expected to be finalized in early 2009 and was to form one of the nation&#x27;s largest specialty chemicals firms in the U.S. However, on 26 January 2009 the company informed Rohm and Haas that it would be unable to complete the transaction by the agreed upon deadline. Dow cited a deteriorated credit market and the collapse of the K-Dow Petrochemical deal as reasons for failing to timely close the merger. Around the same time, CEO Andrew Liveris said a first- time cut to the company&#x27;s 97- year- old dividend policy was not &quot;off the table&quot;. On 12 February 2009, the company declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15/share, down from $0.42 the previous quarter. The cut represented the first time the company had diminished its investor payout in the dividend&#x27;s 97-year history.

The transaction to purchase the outstanding interest of Rohm and Haas closed on 1 April 2009. After negotiating the sale of preferred stock with Rohm and Hass&#x27; two largest stockholders and extending their one-year bridge loan an additional year, the company purchased Rohm and Haas for $15 billion ($78 a share) on 9 March 2009.

====2007 dismissal of senior executives====

On 12 April 2007, Dow dismissed two senior executives for &quot;unauthorized discussions with third parties about the potential sale of the company&quot;. The two figures are executive vice president Romeo Kreinberg, and director and former CFO J. Pedro Reinhard. Dow claims they were secretly in contact with JPMorgan Chase; at the same time, a story surfaced in Britain&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Express&quot; regarding a possible leveraged buyout of Dow. The two executives have since filed lawsuits claiming they were fired for being a threat to CEO Liveris, and that the allegations were concocted as a pretext. However, in June 2008 Dow Chemical and the litigants announced a settlement in which Kreinberg and Reinhard dropped their lawsuits and admitted taking part in discussions &quot;which were not authorized by, nor disclosed to, Dow&#x27;s board concerning a potential LBO&quot; and acknowledged that it would have been appropriate to have informed the CEO and board of the talks.

====2008 sale of zoxamide business====

In summer 2008, Dow sold its zoxamide business to Gowan Company. Included in the sale were the trademarks for a potato and grape fungicide called Gavel (fungicide). It is employed by potato growers to control early and late potato blight and is also registered in Canada for control of downy mildew in grapes, except in British Columbia.

====2014 – New operating segments====
In the fourth quarter of 2014, Dow announced new operating segments in response to its previously announced leadership changes. The company stated it would give further support to its end-market orientation and increase its alignment to Dow&#x27;s key value chains – ethylene and propylene.

====U.S. Gulf Coast investments====
Several plants on the Gulf Coast of the US have been in development since 2013, as part of Dow&#x27;s transition away from naphtha. Dow estimates the facilities will employ about 3000 people, and 5000 people during construction. The plants will manufacture materials for several of its growing segments, including hygiene and medical, transportation, electrical and telecommunications, packaging, consumer durables and sports and leisure.

Dow&#x27;s new propane dehydrogenation (PDH) facility in Freeport, Texas, was expected to come online in 2015, with a first 750000 tonne per year unit, while other units would become available in the future. An ethylene production facility was expected to start up in the first half of 2017.

====Chlorine merger====
On 27 March 2015, Dow and Olin Corporation announced that the boards of directors of both companies unanimously approved a definitive agreement under which Dow will separate a significant portion of its chlorine business and merge that new entity with Olin in a transaction that will create an industry leader, with revenues approaching $7 billion. Olin, the new partnership, became the largest chlorine producer in the world.

====2015 merger and 2019 separation with DuPont====

On 11 December 2015, Dow announced that it would merge with DuPont, in an all-stock deal. The combined company, which was known as DowDuPont, had an estimated value of $130 billion, was equally held by the shareholders of both companies, and maintained their respective headquarters in Michigan and Delaware. Within two years of the merger&#x27;s closure, DowDuPont was set to split into three separate public companies, focusing on the agriculture, chemical, and specialty product industries. Shareholders of each company held 50% of the combined company. In the new entity, Dow Chemical chief executive officer Andrew N. Liveris became executive chairman and DuPont chief executive officer Edward D. Breen became chief executive officer. In January 2017, the merger was pushed back a second time pending regulatory approvals.

The same day, Dow also announced that it had reached a deal to acquire Corning Incorporated&#x27;s stake in their joint venture Dow Corning for $4.8 billion in cash and a roughly 40% stake in Hemlock Semiconductor Corporation.

In 2019, DowDuPont de-merged, forming Dow Inc. The spin-off was completed on 1 April 2019, at which time Dow Inc. became an independent, publicly traded company, and the direct parent company of The Dow Chemical Company. Also in 2019 Dow employees won an Adhesives and Sealants Council Innovation Award for &quot;UV Curable Primer that Enables Hard to Bond INFUSE Olefin Block Copolymer Midsole Foams in High Performance Footwear&quot;.

===Focus on higher margin business===
Dow Chemical has begun to shed commodity chemical businesses, such as those making the basic ingredients for grocery bags and plastic pipes, because their profit margins only average 5–10%. Dow is, as of 2015, focusing its resources on specialty chemicals that earn profit margins of at least 20%.

=== Dioxin contamination ===
Areas along Michigan&#x27;s Tittabawassee River, which runs within yards of Dow&#x27;s main plant in Midland, were found to contain elevated levels of the cancer-causing chemical dioxin in November 2006. The dioxin was located in sediments two to ten feet below the surface of the river, and, according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;there is no indication that residents or workers in the area are directly exposed to the sites&quot;. However, people who often eat fish from the river had slightly elevated levels of dioxin in their blood. In July 2007, Dow reached an agreement with the Environmental Protection Agency to remove of sediment from three areas of the riverbed and levees of the river that had been found to be contaminated. In November 2008, Dow Chemical along with the United States Environmental Protection Agency and Michigan Department of Environmental Quality agreed to establish a Superfund to address dioxin cleanup of the Tittabawassee River, Saginaw River and Saginaw Bay.

=== Sale of herbicide business ===
In December 2015, Dow Chemicals agreed to sell part of its global herbicide business, which had reported falling sales for nearly a year. A portfolio of weed killers known as dinitroanilines was sold to privately held Gowan Company, a family owned company located in Yuma, Arizona, which markets a variety of pesticides to the agricultural and horticultural industries. The global trademarks for Treflan (pesticide)®, which can be sprayed on field corn, cotton and some fruit and vegetables, were included in the sale, as well as a formulation and packaging facility in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta, Canada. Edge (pesticide)®, Team (pesticide)®, Bonalan (pesticide)® and Sonalan (pesticide)®, intellectual property and labels for herbicides based on the molecules trifluralin, benfluralin and ethalfluralin were also included in the sale. Annual grasses and small seeded broadleaf weeds can be controlled with these products in a wide range of crops including cotton, beans, canola, cereals, crucifers, cucurbits, and vegetables. Dinitroanilines, are also known as &quot;DNA herbicides&quot;, and have been commercialised at least since 1970.

== Products ==

Dow is a large producer of plastics, including polystyrene, polyurethane, polyethylene, polypropylene, and synthetic rubber. It is also a major producer of ethylene oxide, various acrylates, surfactants, and cellulose resins. It produces agricultural chemicals including the pesticide Lorsban and consumer products including Styrofoam. Some Dow consumer products, including Saran wrap, Ziploc bags, and Scrubbing Bubbles were sold to S. C. Johnson &amp; Son in 1997.

===Performance plastics===
Performance plastics make up 25% of Dow&#x27;s sales, with many products designed for the automotive and construction industries. The plastics include polyolefins such as polyethylene and polypropylene, as well as polystyrene used to produce Styrofoam insulating material. Dow manufactures epoxy resin intermediates including bisphenol A and epichlorohydrin. Saran resins and films are based on polyvinylidene chloride (PVDC).

===Performance chemicals===
The Performance Chemicals (17 percent of sales) segment produces chemicals and materials for water purification, pharmaceuticals, paper coatings, paints and advanced electronics. Major product lines include nitroparaffins, such as nitromethane, used in the pharmaceutical industry and manufactured by Angus Chemical Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of The Dow Chemical Co. Important polymers include Dowex ion-exchange resins, acrylic and polystyrene latex, as well as Carbowax polyethylene glycols. Specialty chemicals are used as starting materials for production of agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals.

===Water purification===
Dow Water and Process Solutions (DW&amp;PS) is a business unit which manufactures Filmtec reverse osmosis membranes which are used to purify water for human use in the Middle East. The technology was used during the 2000 Summer Olympics and 2008 Summer Olympics. The DW&amp;PS business unit remained with DowDuPont following the April 2019 spin-off.

===Agricultural sciences===
Agricultural Sciences, or (Dow AgroSciences), provides 7 percent of sales and is responsible for a range of insecticides (such as Lorsban), herbicides and fungicides. Seeds from genetically modified plants are also an important area of growth for the company. Dow AgroSciences sells seeds commercially under the following brands: Mycogen (grain corn, silage corn, sunflowers, alfalfa, and sorghum), Atlas (soybean), PhytoGen (cotton) and Hyland Seeds in Canada (corn, soybean, alfalfa, navy beans and wheat). The Dow AgroSciences business unit was spun off into Corteva Inc, on 3 June 2019.

===Basic plastics===
Basic plastics (26 percent of sales) end up in everything from diaper liners to beverage bottles and oil tanks. Products are based on the three major polyolefins – polystyrene (such as Styron resins), polyethylene and polypropylene.

===Basic chemicals===
Basic chemicals (12 percent of sales) are used internally by Dow as raw materials and are also sold worldwide. Markets include dry cleaning, paints and coatings, snow and ice control and the food industry. Major products include ethylene glycol, caustic soda, chlorine, and vinyl chloride monomer (VCM, for making PVC). Ethylene oxide and propylene oxide and the derived alcohols ethylene glycol and propylene glycol are major feedstocks for the manufacture of plastics such as polyurethane and PET.

===Hydrocarbons and energy===
The Hydrocarbons and Energy operating segment (13 percent of sales) oversees energy management at Dow. Fuels and oil-based raw materials are also procured. Major feedstocks for Dow are provided by this group, including ethylene, propylene, 1,3-butadiene, benzene and styrene.

===Hand sanitizer===
In March 2020, during the Coronavirus outbreak, Dow expanded its European hand sanitizer production, providing the product free to hospitals.

== Finances ==

For the fiscal year 2023, Dow Chemicals reported earnings of US$0.6 billion, with an annual revenue of US$44.9 billion. Dow Chemicals shares traded at over $67 per share, and its market capitalization was valued at over US$121.1 billion in September 2018.

==Environmental record==
In 2003, Dow agreed to pay $2 million, the largest penalty ever in a pesticide case, to the state of New York for making illegal safety claims related to its pesticides. The New York Attorney General&#x27;s Office stated that Dow AgroSciences had violated a 1994 agreement with the State of New York to stop advertisements making safety claims about its pesticide products. Dow stated that it was not admitting to any wrongdoing, and that it was agreeing to the settlement to avoid a costly court battle.

According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Dow has some responsibility for 96 of the United States&#x27; Superfund toxic waste sites. One of these, a former UCC uranium and vanadium processing facility near Uravan, Colorado, is listed as the sole responsibility of Dow. The rest are shared with numerous other companies. Fifteen sites have been listed by the EPA as finalized (cleaned up) and 69 are listed as &quot;construction complete&quot;, meaning that all required plans and equipment for cleanup are in place.

In 2007, the chemical industry trade association – the American Chemical Council – gave Dow an award of &#x27;Exceptional Merit&#x27; in recognition of longstanding energy efficiency and conservation efforts. Between 1995 and 2005, Dow reduced energy intensity (BTU per pound produced) by 22 percent. This is equivalent to saving enough electricity to power eight million US homes for a year. The same year, Dow subsidiary, Dow Agrosciences, won a United Nations Montreal Protocol Innovators Award for its efforts in helping replace methyl bromide – a compound identified as contributing to the depletion of the ozone layer. In addition, Dow Agrosciences won an EPA &quot;Best of the Best&quot; Stratospheric Ozone Protection Award. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) named Dow as a 2008 Energy Star Partner of the Year for excellence in energy management and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.

In December 2022, the company was added to the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index.

===Carbon footprint===
Dow Chemical Company reported Total CO2e emissions (Direct + Indirect) for the twelve months ending 31 December 2020 at 33,100 Kt (+700/+2.2% y-o-y) and plans to reduce emissions 15% by 2030 from a 2019 base year.

==Major sponsorships==
In July 2010, Dow became a worldwide partner of the Olympic Games. The sponsorship extended until 2020.

In September 2004, Dow obtained the naming rights to the Saginaw County Event Center in Saginaw, Michigan; the center is now called the Dow Event Center. The Saginaw Spirit (of the Ontario Hockey League) plays at the center, which also hosts events such as professional wrestling, live theater, and concerts.

In October 2006, Dow bought the naming rights to the stadium used by the Great Lakes Loons, a Single-A minor league baseball team located in its hometown of Midland, Michigan. The stadium is called Dow Diamond. The Dow Foundation played a key role in bringing the Loons to the city.

In 2010, Dow signed a $100m (£63m) 10-year deal with the International Olympic Committee and agreed to sponsor the £7m Olympic Stadium wrap.

Since 2014 Dow also sponsors Austin Dillon&#x27;s #3 Chevrolet for Richard Childress Racing in the NASCAR Cup Series.

==Major collaborations==
===Lab Safety Academy===
On 20 May 2013, Dow launched the Dow Lab Safety Academy, a website that includes a large collection of informational videos and resources that demonstrate best practices in laboratory safety. The goal of the website is to improve awareness of safety practices in academic research laboratories and to help the future chemical workforce develop a safety mindset. As such, the Dow Lab Safety Academy is primarily geared toward university students. However, Dow has made the content open to all, including those already employed in the chemical industry. The Dow Lab Safety Academy is also available through the Safety and Chemical Engineering Education program, an affiliate of American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE); and The Campbell Institute, an organization focusing on environment, health and safety practices.

The Dow Lab Safety Academy is one component of Dow&#x27;s larger laboratory safety initiative launched in early 2012, following a report from the U.S. Chemical Safety Board that highlighted the potential hazards associated with conducting research at chemical laboratories in academic institutions. Seeking to share industry best practices with academia, Dow partnered with several U.S. research universities to improve safety awareness and practices in the departments of chemistry, chemical engineering, engineering and materials. Through the pilot programs with U.C. Santa Barbara (UCSB), University of Minnesota, and Pennsylvania State University, Dow worked with graduate students and faculty to identify areas of improvement and develop a culture of laboratory safety.

===Nature conservancy===
In January 2011, The Nature Conservancy and The Dow Chemical Co. announced a collaboration to integrate the value of nature into business decision-making. Scientists, engineers, and economists from The Nature Conservancy and Dow are working together at three pilot sites (North America, Latin America, and TBD) to implement and refine models that support corporate decision-making related to the value and resources nature provides. Those ecosystem services include water, land, air, oceans and a variety of plant and animal life. These sites will serve as a “living laboratories”, to validate and test methods and models so they can be used to inform more sustainable business decisions at Dow and hopefully influence the decision-making and business practices of other companies.

<text>The Hephthalites (), sometimes called the White Huns (also known as the White Hunas, in Iranian as the Spet Xyon and in Prakrit as the Sveta-huna), were a people who lived in Central Asia during the 5th to 8th centuries CE, part of the larger group of Eastern Iranian Huns. They formed an empire, the Imperial Hephthalites, and were militarily important from 450 CE, when they defeated the Kidarites, to 560 CE, when combined forces from the First Turkic Khaganate and the Sasanian Empire defeated them. After 560 CE, they established &quot;principalities&quot; in the area of Tokharistan, under the suzerainty of the Western Turks (in the areas north of the Oxus) and of the Sasanian Empire (in the areas south of the Oxus), before the Tokhara Yabghus took over in 625.

The Imperial Hephthalites, based in Bactria, expanded eastwards to the Tarim Basin, westwards to Sogdia and southwards through Afghanistan, but they never went beyond the Hindu-Kush, which was occupied by the Alchon Huns, previously thought to be an extension of the Hephthalites. They were a tribal confederation and included both nomadic and settled urban communities. They formed part of the four major states known collectively as &quot;Xyon&quot; (Xionites) or &quot;Huna&quot;, being preceded by the Kidarites and by the Alkhon, and succeeded by the Nezak Huns and by the First Turkic Khaganate. All of these Hunnic peoples have often been controversially linked to the Huns who invaded Eastern Europe during the same period, and/or have been referred to as &quot;Huns&quot;, but scholars have reached no consensus about any such connection.

The stronghold of the Hephthalites was Tokharistan (present-day southern Uzbekistan and northern Afghanistan) on the northern slopes of the Hindu Kush, and their capital was probably at Kunduz, having come from the east, possibly from the area of Pamir. By 479 the Hephthalites had conquered Sogdia and driven the Kidarites eastwards, and by 493 they had captured parts of Dzungaria and the Tarim Basin (in present-day Northwest China). The Alchon Huns, formerly confused with the Hephthalites, expanded into Northern India as well.

The sources for Hephthalite history are sparse and the opinions of historians differ. There is no king-list, and historians are not sure how the group arose or what language they initially spoke. They seem to have called themselves &quot;Ebodalo&quot; (ηβοδαλο, hence &quot;Hephthal&quot;), often abbreviated &quot;Eb&quot; (ηβ), a name they wrote in the Bactrian script on some of their coins. The origin of the name &quot;Hephthalites&quot; is unknown, it may stem either from a Khotanese word &quot;*Hitala&quot; meaning &quot;Strong&quot;, from hypothetical Sogdian *&quot;Heβtalīt&quot;, plural of *&quot;Heβtalak&quot;, or from postulated Middle Persian &quot;*haft āl&quot; &quot;the Seven Al&quot;.

== Name and ethnonyms ==

The Hephthalites called themselves &quot;ēbodālo&quot; (Bactrian: ; Greek script: ηβοδαλο) in their inscriptions, which was commonly abbreviated to (ηβ, &quot;eb&quot;) in their coinage. An important and unique seal, held in the private collection of Professor Dr. Aman ur Rahman and published by Nicholas Sims-Williams in 2011, shows an early Hepthalite ruler with a round beardless face and slanted almond-shaped eyes, wearing a radiate crown with a single crescent, and framed by the Bactrian script legend ηβοδαλο ββγο (&quot;The Lord [&quot;Yabghu&quot;] of the Hephthalites&quot;). The seal is dated to the end 5th century- early 6th century CE. The ethnic name &quot;Ebodalo&quot;, and title &quot;Ebodalo Yabghu&quot;, have also been discovered in contemporary Bactrian documents of the Kingdom of Rob describing administrative functions under the Hephthalites.

Byzantine Greek sources referred to them as &quot;Hephthalitae&quot; (), &quot;Abdel&quot; or &quot;Avdel&quot;. To the Armenians, the Hephthalites were &quot;Hephthal&quot;, &quot;Hep&#x27;t&#x27;al&quot; &amp; &quot;Tetal&quot; and sometimes identified with the Kushans. To the Persians, Hephthalites are Hephtal, Hephtel, &amp; Hēvtāls. To Arabs, Hephthalites were &quot;Haital&quot;, &quot;Hetal&quot;, &quot;Heithal&quot;, &quot;Haiethal&quot;, &quot;Heyâthelites&quot;, &quot;(al-)Hayaṭila&quot; (), and sometimes identified as Turks. According to Zeki Velidi Togan (1985), the form &quot;Haytal&quot; in Persian and Arabic sources in the first period was a clerical error for &quot;Habtal&quot;, as Arabic &quot;-b-&quot; resembles &quot;-y-&quot;.

In Chinese chronicles, the Hephthalites are called &quot;Yàndàiyílìtuó&quot; (), or in the more usual abbreviated form, &quot;Yèdā&quot; or in the 635 &quot;Book of Liang&quot; as the &quot;Huá&quot; . The latter name has been given various Latinisations, including &quot;Yeda&quot;, &quot;Ye-ta&quot;, &quot;Ye-tha&quot;; &quot;Ye-dā&quot; and &quot;Yanda&quot;. The corresponding Cantonese and Korean names &quot;Yipdaat&quot; and &quot;Yeoptal&quot; (), which preserve aspects of the Middle Chinese pronunciation (IPA ) better than the modern Mandarin pronunciation, are more consistent with the Greek &quot;Hephthalite&quot;. Some Chinese chroniclers suggest that the root &quot;Hephtha-&quot; (as in &quot;Yàndàiyílìtuó&quot; or &quot;Yèdā&quot;) was technically a title equivalent to &quot;emperor&quot;, while &quot;Huá&quot; was the name of the dominant tribe.

In ancient India, names such as Hephthalite were unknown. The Hephthalites were part of, or offshoots of, people known in India as &quot;Hunas&quot; or &quot;Turushkas&quot;, although these names may have referred to broader groups or neighbouring peoples. Ancient Sanskrit text &quot;Pravishyasutra&quot; mentions a group of people named &quot;Havitaras&quot; but it is unclear whether the term denotes Hephthalites. The Indians also used the expression &quot;White Huns&quot; (&quot;Sveta Huna&quot;) for the Hephthalites.

=== Geographical origin and expansion ===

According to recent scholarship, the stronghold of the Hephthalites was always Tokharistan on the northern slopes of the Hindu Kush, in what is present-day southern Uzbekistan and northern Afghanistan. Their capital was probably at Kunduz, which was known to the 11th-century scholar al-Biruni as &quot;War-Walīz&quot;, a possible origin of one of the names given by the Chinese to Hephthalites: 滑 (Middle Chinese (ZS) *&quot;ɦˠuat̚&quot; &gt; standard Chinese: &quot;Huá&quot;).

The Hephthalites may have come from the East, through the Pamir Mountains, possibly from the area of Badakhshan. Alternatively, they may have migrated from the Altai region, among the waves of invading Huns.

Following their westward or southward expansion, the Hephthalites settled in Bactria, and displaced the Alchon Huns, who expanded into Northern India. The Hephthalites came into contact with the Sasanian Empire, and were involved in helping militarily Peroz I seize the throne from his brother Hormizd III.

Later, in the late 5th century, the Hephthalites expanded into vast areas of Central Asia, and occupied the Tarim Basin as far as Turfan, taking control of the area from the Rourans, who had been collecting heavy tribute from the oasis cities, but were now weakening under the assaults of the Chinese Northern Wei dynasty.

== Origins and characteristics ==
There are several theories regarding the origins of the Hephthalites, with the Iranian and Altaic theories being the main ones. The most prominent theory at present seems to be that the Hephthalites were of Turkic origin, and later adopted the Bactrian language.

According to most specialists, the Hephthalites adopted Bactrian as their official language, just as the Kushans had done, following their settlement in Bactria/Tokharistan. Bactrian was an Eastern Iranian language which was written in the Greek alphabet, a legacy of the Greco-Bactrian kingdom in the 3rd–2nd century BCE. Bactrian, beyond being an official language, was also the language of the local populations ruled by the Hephthalites.

The Hephthalites inscribed their coins in Bactrian. The titles they held were Bactrian, such as () or , and of probable Chinese origin, such as &quot;yabghu&quot;. The names of Hephthalite rulers given in Ferdowsi&#x27;s &quot;Shahnameh&quot; are Iranian, and gem inscriptions and other evidence shows that the official language of the Hephthalite elite was East Iranian. In 1959, Kazuo Enoki proposed that the Hephthalites were probably (East) Iranians who originated in Bactria/Tokharistan, based on the fact that ancient sources generally located them in the area between Sogdia and the Hindu-Kush, and the Hephthalites had some Iranian characteristics. Richard Nelson Frye cautiously accepted Enoki&#x27;s hypothesis, while at the same time stressing that the Hephthalites &quot;were probably a mixed horde&quot;. Frye writes: 

A few scholars, such as Marquart and Grousset proposed Proto-Mongolic origins. Yu Taishan traced the Hephthalites&#x27; origins to the Xianbei and further to Goguryeo.

Other scholars such as de la Vaissière, based on a recent reappraisal of the Chinese sources, suggest that the Hephthalites were of Turkic origin, and later adopted the Bactrian language, first for administrative purposes, and possibly later as a native language. According to , this thesis is seemingly the &quot;most prominent at present&quot;.
=== Relation to European Huns ===
According to Martin Schottky, the Hephthalites apparently had no direct connection with the European Huns, but may have been causally related with their movement. The tribes in question deliberately called themselves &quot;Huns&quot; in order to frighten their enemies. On the contrary, de la Vaissière considers that the Hephthalites were part of the great Hunnic migrations of the 4th century CE from the Altai region that also reached Europe, and that these Huns &quot;were the political, and partly cultural, heirs of the Xiongnu&quot;. This massive migration was apparently triggered by climate change, with aridity affecting the mountain grazing grounds of the Altay Mountains during the 4th century CE. According to Amanda Lomazoff and Aaron Ralby, there is a high synchronicity between the &quot;reign of terror&quot; of Attila in the west and the southern expansion of the Hephthalites, with extensive territorial overlap between the Huns and the Hephthalites in Central Asia.

The 6th-century Byzantine historian Procopius of Caesarea (History of the Wars, Book I. ch. 3), related them to the Huns in Europe, but insisted on cultural and sociological differences, highlighting the sophistication of the Hephthalites:

=== Chinese chronicles ===

The Hephthalites were first known to the Chinese in 456 CE, when a Hephthalite embassy arrived at the Chinese court of the Northern Wei. The Chinese used various names for the Hephthalites, such as &quot;Hua&quot; (滑), &quot;Ye-tha-i-li-to&quot; (simp. 厌带夷栗陁, trad. 厭帶夷粟陁) or more briefly &quot;Ye-da&quot; (嚈噠). Ancient imperial Chinese chronicles give various explanations about the origins of the Hephthalites:
* They were descendants &quot;of the Gaoju or the Da Yuezhi&quot; according to the earliest chronicles such as the &quot;Book of Wei&quot; or the &quot;History of the Northern Dynasties&quot;.
* They were descendants &quot;of the Da Yuezhi tribes&quot;, according to many later chronicles.
* The ancient historian Pei Ziye conjectured that the &quot;Hua&quot; (滑) may be descendants of a Jushi general of the 2nd century CE because that general was named &quot;Bahua&quot; (八滑). This etymological fantasy was adopted by the &quot;Book of Liang&quot; (Volume 30 and Volume 54).
* Another etymological fantasy appeared in the &quot;Tongdian&quot;, reporting an account by the traveller Wei Jie according to which the Hephthalites may have been the descendants of the Kangju because a Kangju general of the Eastern Han happened to be named &quot;Yitian&quot;.

Kazuo Enoki made a first groundbreaking analysis of the Chinese sources in 1959, suggesting that the Hephthalites were a local tribe of the Tokharistan (Bactria) region, with their origin in the nearby Western Himalayas. He also used as an argument the presence of numerous Bactrian names among the Hephthalites, and the fact that the Chinese reported that they practiced polyandry, a well-known West Himalayan cultural trait.

According to a recent reappraisal of the Chinese sources by de la Vaissière (2003), only the Turkic Gaoju origin of the Hephthalites should be retained as indicative of their primary ethnicity, and the mention of the Da Yuezhi only stems from the fact that, at the time, the Hephthalites had already settled in the former Da Yuezhi territory of Bactria, where they are known to have used the Eastern Iranian Bactrian language. The earliest Chinese source on this encounter, the near-contemporary chronicles of the Northern Wei (&quot;Weishu&quot;) as quoted in the later &quot;Tongdian&quot;, reports that they migrated southward from the Altai region circa 360 CE:

The Gaoju (高車 lit. &quot;High Cart&quot;), also known as Tiele, were early Turkic speakers related to the earlier Dingling, who were once conquered by the Xiongnu. Weishu also mentioned the linguistic and ethnic proximity between the Gaoju and the Xiongnu. De la Vaissière proposes that the Hephthalites had originally been one Oghuric-speaking tribe who belonged the Gaoju/Tiele confederation. This and several later Chinese chronicles also report that the Hephthalites may have originated from the Da Yuezhi, probably because of their settlement in the former Da Yuezhi territory of Bactria. Later Chinese sources become quite confused about the origins of the Hephthalites, and this may be due to their progressive assimilation of Bactrian culture and language once they settled there.

According to the &quot;Beishi&quot;, describing the situation in the first half of the 6th century CE around the time Song Yun visited Central Asia, the language of the Hephthalites was different from that of the Rouran, Gaoju or other tribes of Central Asia, but that probably reflects their acculturation and adoption of the Bactrian language since their arrival in Bactria in the 4th century CE. The &quot;Liangshu&quot; and &quot;Liang Zhigongtu&quot; do explain that the Hephthalites originally had no written language and adopted the &quot;hu&quot; (local, &quot;Barbarian&quot;) alphabet, in this case, the Bactrian script.

Overall, de la Vaissière considers that the Hephthalites were part of the great Hunnic migrations of the 4th century CE from the Altai region that also reached Europe and that these Huns &quot;were the political, and partly cultural, heirs, of the Xiongnu&quot;.

=== Appearance ===

The Hepthalites appear in several mural paintings in the area of Tokharistan, especially in banquet scenes at Balalyk tepe and as donors to the Buddha in the ceiling painting of the 35-meter Buddha at the Buddhas of Bamyan. Several of the figures in these paintings have a characteristic appearance, with belted jackets with a unique lapel of their tunic being folded on the right side, a style which became popular under the Hephthalites, the cropped hair, the hair accessories, their distinctive physionomy and their round beardless faces. The figures at Bamyan must represent the donors and potentates who supported the building of the monumental giant Buddha. These remarkable paintings participate &quot;to the artistic tradition of the Hephthalite ruling classes of Tukharistan&quot;.

The paintings related to the Hephthalites have often been grouped under the appellation of &quot;Tokharistan school of art&quot;, or the &quot;Hephthalite stage in the History of Central Asia Art&quot;. The paintings of Tavka Kurgan, of very high quality, also belong to this school of art, and are closely related to other paintings of the Tokharistan school such as Balalyk tepe, in the depiction of clothes, and especially in the treatment of the faces.

This &quot;Hephthalite period&quot; in art, with the caftans with a triangular collar folded on the right, the particular cropped hairstyle, the crowns with crescents, have been found in many of the areas historically occupied and ruled by the Hephthalites, in Sogdia, Bamyan (modern Afghanistan), or in Kucha in the Tarim Basin (modern Xinjiang, China). This points to a &quot;political and cultural unification of Central Asia&quot; with similar artistic styles and iconography, under the rule of the Hephthalites.

== History ==

The Hephthalites were a vassal state to the Rouran Khaganate until the beginning of the 5th century. There were close contacts between them, although they had different languages and cultures, and the Hephthalites borrowed much of their political organization from Rourans. In particular, the title &quot;Khan&quot;, which according to McGovern was original to the Rourans, was borrowed by the Hephthalite rulers. The reason for the migration of the Hephthalites southeast was to avoid a pressure of the Rourans.

The Hephthalites became a significant political entity in Bactria around 450 CE, or sometime before. It has been commonly assumed that the Hephthalites formed a third wave of migrations into Central Asia, after the Chionites (who arrived circa 350 CE) and the Kidarites (who arrived from around 380 CE), but recent studies suggest that instead there may have been a single massive wave of nomadic migrations around 350–360 CE, the &quot;Great Invasion&quot;, triggered by climate change and the onset of aridity in the grazing grounds of the Altay region, and that these nomadic tribes vied for supremacy thereafter in their new territories in Southern Central Asia. As they rose to prominence, the Hephthalites displaced the Kidarites and then the Alchon Huns, who expanded into Gandhara and Northern India.
The Hephthalites also entered into conflict with the Sasanians. The reliefs of the Bandian complex seem to show the initial defeat of the Hephthalites against the Sasanians in 425 CE, and then their alliance with them, from the time of Bahram V (420-438 CE), until they invaded Sasanian territory and destroyed the Bandian complex in 484 CE.

In 456–457 a Hephthalite embassy arrived in China, during the reign of Emperor Wen of the Northern Wei. By 458 they were strong enough to intervene in Persia.

Around 466 they probably took Transoxianan lands from the Kidarites with Persian help but soon took from Persia the area of Balkh and eastern Kushanshahr. In the second half of the fifth century they controlled the deserts of Turkmenistan as far as the Caspian Sea and possibly Merv. By 500 they held the whole of Bactria and the Pamirs and parts of Afghanistan. In 509, they captured Sogdia and they took &#x27;Sughd&#x27; (the capital of Sogdiana).

To the east, they captured the Tarim Basin and went as far as Urumqi.

Around 560 CE their empire was destroyed by an alliance of the First Turkic Khaganate and the Sasanian Empire, but some of them remained as local rulers in the region of Tokharistan for the next 150 years, under the suzerainty of the Western Turks, followed by the Tokhara Yabghus. Among the principalities which remained in Hephthalite hands even after the Turkic overcame their territory were: Chaganian, and Khuttal in the Vakhsh Valley.

=== Ascendancy over the Sasanian Empire (442–c.530 CE) ===

The Hephthalites were originally vassals of the Rouran Khaganate but split from their overlords in the early fifth century. The next time they were mentioned was in Persian sources as foes of Yazdegerd II (435–457), who from 442, fought &#x27;tribes of the Hephthalites&#x27;, according to the Armenian Elisee Vardaped.

In 453, Yazdegerd moved his court east to deal with the Hephthalites or related groups.

In 458, a Hephthalite king called Akhshunwar helped the Sasanian Emperor Peroz I (458–484) gain the Persian throne from his brother. Before his accession to the throne, Peroz had been the Sasanian for Sistan in the far east of the Empire, and therefore had been one of the first to enter into contact with the Hephthalites and request their help.

The Hephthalites may have also helped the Sasanians to eliminate another Hunnic tribe, the Kidarites: by 467, Peroz I, with Hephthalite aid, reportedly managed to capture Balaam and put an end to Kidarite rule in Transoxiana once and for all. The weakened Kidarites had to take refuge in the area of Gandhara.

==== Victories over the Sasanian Empire (474–484 CE) ====
Later, however, from 474 CE, Peroz I fought three wars with his former allies the Hephthalites. In the first two, he himself was captured and ransomed. Following his second defeat, he had to offer thirty mules loaded with silver drachms to the Hephthalites, and also had to leave his son Kavad as a hostage. The coinage of Peroz I in effect flooded Tokharistan, taking precedence over all other Sasanian issues.

In the third battle, at the Battle of Herat (484), he was vanquished by the Hepthalite king Kun-khi, and for the next two years the Hephthalites plundered and controlled the eastern part of the Sasanian Empire. Perozduxt, the daughter of Peroz, was captured and became a lady as the Hephtalite court, as Queen of king Kun-khi. She became pregnant and had a daughter who would later marry her uncle Kavad I. From 474 until the middle of the 6th century, the Sasanian Empire paid tribute to the Hephthalites.

Bactria came under formal Hephthalite rule from that time. Taxes were levied by the Hephthalites over the local population: a contract in the Bactrian language from the archive of the Kingdom of Rob, has been found, which mentions taxes from the Hephthalites, requiring the sale of land in order to pay these taxes. It is dated to 483/484 CE.

==== Hephthalite coinage ====
With the Sasanian Empire paying a heavy tribute, from 474, the Hephthalites themselves adopted the winged, triple-crescent crowned Peroz I as the design for their coinage. Benefiting from the influx of Sasanian silver coins, the Hephthalites did not develop their own coinage: they either minted coins with the same designs as the Sasanians, or simply countermarked Sasanian coins with their own symbols. They did not inscribe the name of their ruler, contrary to the habit of the Alchon Huns or the Kidarites before them. Exceptionally, one coin type deviates from the Sasanian design, by showing the bust of a Hepthalite prince holding a drinking cup. Overall, the Sasanians paid &quot;an enormous tribute&quot; to the Hephthalites, until the 530s and the rise of Khosrow I.

==== Protectors of Kavad ====
Following their victory over Peroz I, the Hepthalites became protectors and benefactors of his son Kavad I, as Balash, a brother of Peroz took the Sasanian throne. In 488, a Hepthalite army vanquished the Sasaniana army of Balash, and was able to put Kavad I (488–496, 498–531) on the throne.

In 496–498, Kavad I was overthrown by the nobles and clergy, escaped, and restored himself with a Hephthalite army. Joshua the Stylite reports numerous instances in which Kavadh led Hepthalite (&quot;Hun&quot;) troops, in the capture of the city of Theodosiupolis of Armenia in 501–502, in battles against the Romans in 502–503, and again during the siege of Edessa in September 503.

=== Hephthalites in Tokharistan (466 CE) ===

Around 461–462 CE, an Alchon Hun ruler named Mehama is known to have been based in Eastern Tokharistan, possibly indicating a partition of the region between the Hephthalites in western Tokharistan, centered on Balkh, and the Alchon Huns in eastern Tokharistan, who would then go on to expand into northern India. Mehama appears in a letter in the Bactrian language he wrote in 461–462 CE, where he describes himself as &quot;Meyam, King of the people of Kadag, the governor of the famous and prosperous King of Kings Peroz&quot;. Kadag is Kadagstan, an area in southern Bactria, in the region of Baghlan. Significantly, he presents himself as a vassal of the Sasanian Empire king Peroz I, but Mehama was probably later able to wrestle autonomy or even independence as Sasanian power waned and he moved into India, with dire consequences for the Gupta Empire.

The Hepthalites probably expanded into Tokharistan following the destruction of the Kidarites in 466. The presence of the Hepthalites in Tokharistan (Bactria) is securely dated to 484 CE, date of a tax receipt from the Kingdom of Rob mentioning the need to sell some land in order to pay Hephthalite taxes. Two documents were also found, with dates from the period from 492 to 527 CE, mentioning taxes paid to Hephthalite rulers. Another, undated documents, mentions scribal and judiciary functions under the Hephthalites:

=== Hephthalite conquest of Sogdiana (479 CE) ===
The Hephthalites conquered the territory of Sogdiana, beyond the Oxus, which was incorporated into their Empire. They may have conquered Sogdiana as early as 479 CE, as this is the date of the last known embassy of the Sogdians to China. The account of the Liang Zhigongtu also seems to record that from around 479 CE, the Hephthalites occupied the region of Samarkand. Alternatively, the Hephthalites may have occupied Sogdia later in 509 CE, as this is the date of the last known embassy from Samarkand to the Chinese Empire, but this might not be conclusive as several cities, such as Balkh or Kobadiyan, are known to have sent embassies to China as late as 522 CE, while under Hephthalite control. As early as 484, the famous Hephthalite ruler Akhshunwar, who defeated Peroz I, held a title that may be understood as Sogdian: &quot;’xs’wnd’r&quot; (&quot;power-holder&quot;).

The Hephthalites may have built major fortified Hippodamian cities (rectangular walls with an orthogonal network of streets) in Sogdiana, such as Bukhara and Panjikent, as they had also in Herat, continuing the city-building efforts of the Kidarites. The Hephthalites probably ruled over a confederation of local rulers or governors, linked through alliance agreements. One of these vassals may have been Asbar, ruler of Vardanzi, who also minted his own coinage during the period.

The wealth of the Sasanian ransoms and tributes may have been reinvested in Sogdia, possibly explaining the prosperity of the region from that time. Sogdia, at the center of a new Silk Road between China to the Sasanian Empire and the Byzantine Empire became extremely prosperous under its nomadic elites. The Hephthalites took on the role of major intermediary on the Silk Road, after their great predecessor the Kushans, and contracted local Sogdians to carry on the trade of silk and other luxury goods between the China Empire and the Sasanian Empire.

Because of the Hephthalite occupation of Sogdia, the original coinage of Sogdia came to be flooded by the influx of Sasanian coins received as a tribute to the Hephthalites. This coinage then spread along the Silk Road. The symbol of the Hephthalites appears on the residual coinage of Samarkand, probably as a consequence of the Hephthalite control of Sogdia, and becomes prominent in Sogdian coinage from 500 to 700 CE, including in the coinage of their indigenous successors the Ikhshids (642-755 CE), ending with the Muslim conquest of Transoxiana.

=== Tarim Basin (circa 480–550 CE) ===

In the late 5th century CE they expanded eastward through the Pamir Mountains, which are comparatively easy to cross, as did the Kushans before them, due to the presence of convenient plateaus between high peaks. They occupied the western Tarim Basin (Kashgar and Khotan), taking control of the area from the Rourans, who had been collecting heavy tribute from the oasis cities, but were now weakening under the assaults of the Chinese Northern Wei dynasty. In 479 they took the east end of the Tarim Basin, around the region of Turfan. In 497–509, they pushed north of Turfan to the Urumchi region. In the early years of the 6th century, they were sending embassies from their dominions in the Tarim Basin to the Northern Wei dynasty. They were probably in contact with Li Xian, the Chinese Governor of Dunhuang, who is known for having furnished his tomb with a Western-style ewer probably made in Bactria.

The Hephthalites continued to occupy the Tarim Basin until the end of their Empire, circa 560 CE.

As the territories ruled by the Hephthalites expanded into Central Asia and the Tarim Basin, the art of the Hephthalites, characterized by the clothing and hairstyles of the figures being represented, also came to be used in the areas they ruled, such as Sogdiana, Bamyan or Kucha in the Tarim Basin (Kizil Caves, Kumtura Caves, Subashi reliquary). In these areas appear dignitaries with caftans with a triangular collar on the right side, crowns with three crescents, some crowns with wings, and a unique hairstyle. Another marker is the two-point suspension system for swords, which seems to have been an Hephthalite innovation, and was introduced by them in the territories they controlled. The paintings from the Kucha region, particularly the swordsmen in the Kizil Caves, appear to have been made during Hephthalite rule in the region, circa 480–550 CE. The influence of the art of Gandhara in some of the earliest paintings at the Kizil Caves, dated to circa 500 CE, is considered as a consequence of the political unification of the area between Bactria and Kucha under the Hephthalites. Some words of the Tocharian languages may have been adopted from the Hephthalites in the 6th century CE.

The early Turks of the First Turkic Khaganate then took control of the Turfan and Kucha areas from around 560 CE, and, in alliance with the Sasanian Empire, became instrumental in the fall of the Hepthalite Empire.

=== Hephthalite embassies to Liang China (516–526 CE) ===
An illustrated account of a Hepthalite (滑, Hua) embassy to the Chinese court of the Southern Liang in the capital Jingzhou in 516–526 CE is given in &quot;Portraits of Periodical Offering of Liang&quot;, originally painted by Pei Ziye or the future Emperor Yuan of Liang while he was a Governor of the Province of Jingzhou as a young man between 526 and 539 CE, and of which an 11th-century Song copy is preserved. The text explains how small the country of the Hua was when they were still vassals of the Rouran Khaganate, and how they later moved to &quot;Moxian&quot;, possibly referring to their occupation of Sogdia, and then conquered numerous neighbouring country, including the Sasanian Empire:

The &quot;Portraits of Periodical Offering of Liang&quot; mentions that no envoys from the Hephthalites came before 516 to the southern court, and it was only in that year that a Hephthalite King named Yilituo Yandai (姓厭帶名夷栗陁) sent an ambassador named Puduoda[] (蒲多达[], possibly a Buddhist name &quot;Buddhadatta&quot; or &quot;Buddhadāsa&quot;). In 520, another ambassador named Fuheliaoliao (富何了了) visited the Liang court, bringing a yellow lion, a white marten fur coat and Persian brocade as present. Another ambassador named Kang Fuzhen (康符真), followed with presents as well (in 526 CE according to the &quot;Liangshu&quot;). Their language had to be translated by the Tuyuhun.

In &quot;Portraits of Periodical Offering of Liang&quot;, the Hepthalithes are treated as the most important foreign state, as they occupy the leading position, at the front of the column of foreign ambassadors, and have by far the largest descriptive text. The Hepthalites were, according to the &quot;Liangshu&quot; (Chap.54), accompanied in their embassy by three states: Humidan (胡蜜丹), Yarkand (周古柯, Khargalik) and Kabadiyan (呵跋檀). The envoys from right to left were: the Hephthalites (滑/嚈哒), Persia (波斯), Korea (百濟), Kucha (龜茲), Japan (倭), Malaysia (狼牙脩), Qiang (鄧至), Yarkand (周古柯, &quot;Zhouguke&quot;, &quot;near &quot;Hua&quot;&quot;), Kabadiyan (呵跋檀 &quot;Hebatan&quot;, &quot;near &quot;Hua&quot;&quot;), Kumedh (胡蜜丹, &quot;Humidan&quot;, &quot;near &quot;Hua&quot;&quot;), Balkh (白題, &quot;Baiti&quot;, &quot;descendants of the Xiongnu and east of the &quot;Hua&quot;&quot;), and finally Merv (末).

Most of the ambassadors from Central Asia are shown wearing heavy beards and relatively long hair, but, in stark contrast, the Hephthalite ambassador, as well as the ambassador from Balkh, are clean-shaven and bare-headed, and their hair is cropped short. These physical characteristics are also visible in many of the Central Asian seals of the period.

==== Other embassies ====
Overall, Chinese chronicles recorded twenty-four Hephthalite embassies: the first embassy in 456, and the others from 507 to 558 CE (including fifteen to the Northern Wei until the end of this dynasty in 535, and five to the Southern Liang in 516–541). The last three are mentioned in the &quot;Zhoushu&quot;, which records that the Hepththalites had conquered Anxi, Yutian (Hotan region in Xinjiang) and more than twenty other countries, and that they sent embassies to the Chinese court of the Western Wei and Northern Zhou in 546, 553 and 558 CE respectively, after what the Hepthalites were &quot;crushed by the Turks&quot; and embassies stopped.

The Hephthalites also requested and obtained a Christian bishop from the Patriarch of the Church of the East Mar Aba I circa 550 CE.

=== Buddhas of Bamiyan (544–644 CE) ===

The complex of the Buddhas of Bamiyan was developed under Hephthalite rule. After the dissolution of their empire in 550–560, the Hephthalites continued to rule in the geographical areas corresponding to Tokharistan and today&#x27;s northern Afghanistan,&lt;ref name=&quot;Hyun Jin Kim 2015 https://books.google.com/books?id=bnv4CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA56 56&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and particularly held a series of castles on the roads to Bamiyan. Carbon dating of the structural components of the Buddhas has determined that the smaller &quot;Eastern Buddha&quot; was built around 570 CE (544–595 CE with 95% probability), while the larger &quot;Western Buddha&quot; was built around 618 CE (591–644 CE with 95% probability). This corresponds to the period soon before or after the major defeat of the Hephthalites against the combined forces of Western Turk and Sasanian Empire (557 CE), or the following period during which they regrouped south of the Oxus as Principalities, but essentially before the Western Turks finally overran the region to form the Tokhara Yabghus (625 CE).

Among the most famous paintings of the Buddhas of Bamyan, the ceiling of the smaller Eastern Buddha represents a solar deity on a chariot pulled by horses, as well as ceremonial scenes with royal figures and devotees. The god is wearing a caftan in the style of Tokhara, boots, and is holding a lance, he is &quot;The Sun God and a Golden Chariot Rising in Heaven&quot;. His representation is derived from the iconography of the Iranian god Mithra, as revered in Sogdia. He is riding a two-wheeled golden charriot, pulled by four horses. Two winged attendants are standing to the side of the charriot, wearing a Corinthian helmet with a feather, and holding a shield. In the top portion are wind gods, flying with a scarf held in both hands. This great composition is unique, and has no equivalent in Gandhara or India, but there are some similarities with the painting of Kizil or Dunhuang.

The central image of the Sun God on his golden chariot is framed by two lateral rows in individuals: Kings and dignitaries mingling with Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. One of the personages, standing behind a monk in profile, much be the King of Bamyan. He wears a crenelated crown with single crescent and korymbos, a round-neck tunic and a Sasanian headband. Several of the figures, either royal couples, crowned individuals or richly dressed women, have the characteristic appearance of the Hephthalites of Tokharistan, with belted jackets with a unique lapel of their tunic being folded on the right side, the cropped hair, the hair accessories, their distinctive physionomy and their round beardless faces. These figures must represent the donors and potentates who supported the building of the monumental giant Buddha. They are gathered around the Seven Buddhas of the past and Maitreya. The individuals in this painting are very similar to the individuals depicted in Balalyk Tepe, and they may be related to the Hepthalites. They participate &quot;to the artistic tradition of the Hephthalite ruling classes of Tukharestan&quot;.

These murals disappeared with the destruction of the statues by the Taliban in 2001.

===Hephthalite royals on the tombs of Sogdian traders===

The Tomb of Wirkak is the tomb of a 6th-century Sogdian trader established in China, and discovered in Xi&#x27;an. It seems that depictions of Hephthalite rulers are omnipresent in the pictorial decorations of the tomb, as royal figures with elaborate Sasanian-type crowns appearing in their palaces, nomadic yurts or while hunting. Hephthalites rulers are shown short-haired, wearing tunics, and are often depicted together with their female consort. The Sogdian trader Wirkak may therefore have primarily dealt with the Hephthalites during his young years (he was around 60 when the Hephthalites were finally destroyed by the alliance of the Sasanians and the Turks between 556 and 560 CE). The Hephthalites also appear in four panels of the Miho funerary couch (c.570 CE) with somewhat caricatural features, and characteristics of vassals to the Turks. On the contrary, the depictions in the tombs of later Sogdian traders, such as the Tomb of An Jia (who was 24 years younger than Wirwak), already show the omnipresence of the Turks of the First Turkic Khaganate, who were probably his main trading partners during his active life.

=== End of the Empire and fragmentation into Hephthalite Principalities (560–710 CE) ===

After Kavad I, the Hephthalites seem to have shifted their attention away from the Sasanian Empire, and Kavad&#x27;s successor Khosrow I (531–579) was able to resume an expansionist policy to the east. According to al-Tabari, Khosrow I managed, through his expansionsit policy, to take control of &quot;Sind, Bust, Al-Rukkhaj, Zabulistan, Tukharistan, Dardistan, and Kabulistan&quot; as he ultimately defeated the Hephthalites with the help of the First Turkic Khaganate.

In 552, the Göktürks took over Mongolia, formed the First Turkic Khaganate, and by 558 reached the Volga. Circa 555–567, the Turks of the First Turkic Khaganate and the Sasanians under Khosrow I allied against the Hephthalites and defeated them after an eight-day battle near Qarshi, the Battle of Gol-Zarriun, perhaps in 557.

These events put an end to the Hephthalite Empire, which fragmented into semi-independent Principalities, paying tribute to either the Sasanians or the Turks, depending on the military situation. After the defeat, the Hephthalites withdrew to Bactria and replaced king Gatfar with Faghanish, the ruler of Chaghaniyan. Thereafter, the area around the Oxus in Bactria contained numerous Hephthalites principalities, remnants of the great Hephthalite Empire destroyed by the alliance of the Turks and the Sasanians. They are reported in the Zarafshan valley, Chaghaniyan, Khuttal, Termez, Balkh, Badghis, Herat and Kabul, in the geographical areas corresponding to Tokharistan and today&#x27;s northern Afghanistan. They also held a series of castles on the roads to Bamiyan. Extensive Hephthalite kurghan necropoli have been excavated all over the region, as well as a possible one in the Bamiyan valley.

The Sasanians and Turks established a frontier for their zones of influence along the Oxus river, and the Hephthalite Principalities functioned as buffer states between two Empires. But when the Hephthalites chose Faghanish as their king in Chaganiyan, Khosrow I crossed the Oxus and put the Principalities of Chaghaniyan and Khuttal under tribute.

When Khosrow I died in 579, the Hephthalites of Tokharistan and Khotan took advantage of the situation to rebel against the Sasanians, but their efforts were obliterated by the Turks. By 581 or before, the western part of the First Turkic Khaganate separated and became the Western Turkic Khaganate. In 588, triggering the First Perso-Turkic War, the Turkic Khagan Bagha Qaghan (known as Sabeh/Saba in Persian sources), together with his Hephthalite subjects, invaded the Sasanian territories south of the Oxus, where they attacked and routed the Sasanian soldiers stationed in Balkh, and then proceeded to conquer the city along with Talaqan, Badghis, and Herat. They were finally repelled by the Sasanian general Vahram Chobin.

==== Raids into the Sasanid Empire (600–610 CE) ====

Circa 600, the Hephthalites were raiding the Sasanian Empire as far as Ispahan (Spahan) in central Iran. The Hephthalites issued numerous coins imitating the coinage of Khosrow II, adding on the obverse a Hephthalite signature in Sogdian and a Tamgha symbol .

Circa 616/617 CE the Göktürks and Hephthalites raided the Sasanian Empire, reaching the province of Isfahan. Khosrow recalled Smbat IV Bagratuni from Persian Armenia and sent him to Iran to repel the invaders. Smbat, with the aid of a Persian prince named Datoyean, repelled the Hephthalites from Persia, and plundered their domains in eastern Khorasan, where Smbat is said to have killed their king in single combat. Khosrow then gave Smbat the honorific title &quot;Khosrow Shun&quot; (&quot;the Joy or Satisfaction of Khosrow&quot;), while his son Varaztirots II Bagratuni received the honorific name &quot;Javitean Khosrow&quot; (&quot;Eternal Khosrow&quot;).

==== Western Turk takeover (625 CE) ====
From 625 CE, the territory of the Hephthalites from Tokharistan to Kabulistan was taken over by the Western Turks, forming an entity ruled by Western Turk nobles, the Tokhara Yabghus. The Tokhara Yabghus or &quot;Yabghus of Tokharistan&quot; (), were a dynasty of Western Turk sub-kings, with the title &quot;Yabghus&quot;, who ruled from 625 CE south of the Oxus river, in the area of Tokharistan and beyond, with some smaller polities surviving in the area of Badakhshan until 758 CE. Their legacy was extended to the southeast until the 9th century CE, with the Turk Shahis and the Zunbils.

==== Arab invasion (c.651 CE) ====
Circa 650 CE, during the Arab conquest of the Sasanian Empire, the Sasanian Empire ruler Yazdegerd III was trying to regroup and gather forces around Tokharistan and was hoping to obtain the help of the Turks, after his defeat to the Arabs in the Battle of Nihâvand (642 CE). Yazdegerd was initially supported by the Hephthalite Principality of Chaghaniyan, which sent him troops to aid him against the Arabs. But when Yazdegerd arrived in Merv (in what is today&#x27;s Turkmenistan) he demanded tax from the &quot;Marzban&quot; of Marw, losing his support and making him ally with the Hephthalite ruler of Badghis, Nezak Tarkan. The Hepthalite ruler of Badghis allied with the &quot;Marzban&quot; of Merv attack Yazdegerd and defeated him in 651. Yazdegerd III barely escaped with his life but was murdered in the vicinity of Merv soon after, and the Arabs managed to capture the city of Merv the same year.

In 652 CE, following the Siege of Herat (652) to which the Hephthalites participated, the Arabs captured the cities of northern Tokharistan, Balkh included, and the Hepthalites principalities were forced to pay tribute and accept Arab garrisons. The Hephthalites again rebelled in 654 CE, leading to the Battle of Badghis.

In 659, Chinese chronicles still mentioned the &quot;Hephtalite Tarkans&quot; (悒達太汗 &quot;Yida Taihan&quot;, probably related to &quot;Nezak Tarkan&quot;), as some of the rulers in Tokharistan who remained theoretically subjects to the Chinese Empire, and whose main city was Huolu 活路 (modern Mazār-e Sherif, Afghanistan).

The city of Merv became the base of the Arabs for their Central Asian operations. The Arabs weakened during the 4-year civil war leading to the establishment of the Umayyad Caliphate in 661, but they were able to continue their expansion after that.

===== Hephthalite revolts against the Ummayad Caliphate (689–710 CE) =====

Circa 689 CE, the Hephthalite ruler of Badghis and the Arab rebel Musa ibn Abd Allah ibn Khazim, son of the Zubayrid governor of Khurasan Abd Allah ibn Khazim al-Sulami, allied against the forces of the Umayyad Caliphate. The Hepthalites and their allies captured Termez in 689, repelled the Arabs, and occupied the whole region of Khorasan for a brief period, with Termez as the capital, described by the Arabs as &quot;the headquarters of the Hephthalites&quot; (&quot;dār mamlakat al-Hayāṭela&quot;). The Arabs of the Umayyad Caliphate under Yazid ibn al-Muhallab re-captured Termez in 704. Nezak Tarkan, the ruler of the Hephthalites of Badghis, led a new revolt in 709 with the support of other principalities as well as his nominal ruler, the Yabghu of Tokharistan. In 710, Qutaiba ibn Muslim was able to re-establish Muslim control over Tokharistan and captured Nezak Tarkan who was executed on al-Hajjaj&#x27;s orders, despite promises of pardon, while the Yabghu was exiled to Damascus and kept there as a hostage.

In 718 CE, Chinese chronicles still mention the Hephthalites (悒達 &quot;Yida&quot;) as one of the polities under the suzerainty of the Turkic Tokhara Yabghus, capable of providing 50,000 soldiers at the service of its overlord. Some remnants, not necessarily dynastic, of the Hephthalite confederation would be incorporated into the Göktürks, as an Old Tibetan document, dated to the 8th century, mentioned the tribe &quot;Heb-dal&quot; among 12 &quot;Dru-gu&quot; tribes ruled by Eastern Turkic khagan &quot;Bug-chor&quot;, i.e. Qapaghan Qaghan Chinese chronicles report embassies from the &quot;Hephtalite kingdom&quot; as late as 748 CE.

== Military and weapons ==
The Hephthalites were considered to be a powerful military force. Depending on sources, their main weapon was the bow, the mace or the sword. Judging from their military achievements, they probably had a strong cavalry. In Persia, according to the 6th-century Armenian chronicler Lazar Parpetsi:

&quot;Hunnic&quot; designs in weaponry are known to have influenced Sasanian designs during the 6th–7th century CE, just before the Islamic invasions. The Sasanians adopted Hunnish nomadic designs for straight iron swords and their gold-covered scabbards. This is particularly the case of two-straps suspension design, in which straps of different lengths were attached to a P-shaped projection on the scabbard, so that the sword could be held sideways, making it easier to draw, especially when on horseback. The two-point suspension system for swords is considered to have been introduced by the Hephthalites in Central Asia and in the Sasanian Empire and is a marker of their influence, and the design was generally introduced by them in the territories they controlled. The first example of two-suspension sword in Sasanian art occurs in a relief of Taq-i Bustan dated to the time of Khusro II (590–628 CE), and is thought to have been adopted from the Hepthalites.

Swords with ornate cloisonné designs and two-straps suspensions, as found in the paintings of Penjikent and Kizil and in archaeological excavations, may be versions of the daggers produced under Hephthalite influence. Weapons with Hunnic designs are depicted in the &quot;Cave of the Painters&quot; in the Kizil Caves, in a mural showing armoured warriors and dated to the 5th century CE. Their sword guards have typical Hunnish designs of rectangle or oval shapes with cloisonné ornamentation. The Gyerim-ro dagger, found in a tomb in Korea, is a 5-6th century highly decorated dagger and scabbard of &quot;Hunnic&quot; two-straps suspension design, introduced by the Hephthalites in Central Asia. The Gyerim-ro dagger is thought to have reached Korea either through trade or as a diplomatic gift.

Lamellar helmets were also popularized by the steppe nomads, and were adopted by the Sasanian Empire when they took control of former Hephthalite territory. This type of helmet appears in sculptures on pillar capitals at Ṭāq-e Bostān and Behistun, and on the Anahita coinage of Khosrow II (r. 590–628 CE).

== Religion and culture ==

They were said to practice polyandry and artificial cranial deformation. Chinese sources said they worshiped &#x27;foreign gods&#x27;, &#x27;demons&#x27;, the &#x27;heaven god&#x27; or the &#x27;fire god&#x27;. The Gokturks told the Byzantines that they had walled cities. Some Chinese sources said that they had no cities and lived in tents. Litvinsky tries to resolve this by saying that they were nomads who moved into the cities they had conquered. There were some government officials but central control was weak and local dynasties paid tribute.

According to Song Yun, the Chinese Buddhist monk who visited the Hephthalite territory in 540 and &quot;provides accurate accounts of the people, their clothing, the empresses and court procedures and traditions of the people and he states the Hephthalites did not recognize the Buddhist religion and they preached pseudo gods, and killed animals for their meat.&quot; It is reported that some Hephthalites often destroyed Buddhist monasteries but these were rebuilt by others. According to Xuanzang, the third Chinese pilgrim who visited the same areas as Song Yun about 100 years later, the capital of Chaghaniyan had five monasteries.
According to historian André Wink, &quot;...in the Hephthalite dominion Buddhism was predominant but there was also a religious sediment of Zoroastrianism and Manichaeism.&quot; Balkh had some 100 Buddhist monasteries and 30,000 monks. Outside the town was a large Buddhist monastery, later known as Naubahar.

There were Christians among the Hephthalites by the mid-6th century, although nothing is known of how they were converted. In 549, they sent a delegation to Aba I, the patriarch of the Church of the East, asking him to consecrate a priest chosen by them as their bishop, which the patriarch did. The new bishop then performed obeisance to both the patriarch and the Sasanian king, Khosrow I. The seat of the bishopric is not known, but it may have been Badghis–Qadištan, the bishop of which, Gabriel, sent a delegate to the synod of Patriarch Ishoyahb I in 585. It was probably placed under the metropolitan of Herat. The church&#x27;s presence among the Hephthalites enabled them to expand their missionary work across the Oxus. In 591, some Hephthalites serving in the army of the rebel Bahram Chobin were captured by Khosrow II and sent to the Roman emperor Maurice as a diplomatic gift. They had Nestorian crosses tattooed on their foreheads.

== Hephthalite seals ==

Several seals found in Bactria and Sogdia have been attributed to the Hephthalites.
* The &quot;Hephthalite Yabghu seal&quot; shows a Hephthalite ruler with a radiate crown, royal ribbons and a beardless face, with the Bactrian script title &quot;Ebodalo Yabghu&quot; ( ηβοδαλο ββγο, &quot;The Lord of the Hephthalites&quot;), and has been dated to the end of the 5th century-early 6th century CE. This important seal was published by Judith A. Lerner and Nicholas Sims-Williams in 2011.
* &quot;Stamp seal (BM 119999)&quot; in the British Museum shows two facing figures, one bearded and wearing the Sasanian dress, and the other without facial hair and wearing a radiate crown, both being adorned with royal ribbons. This seal was initially dated to 300–350 CE and attributed to the Kushano-Sasanians, but has been more recently attributed to the Hephthalites, and dated to the 5th–6th century CE. Paleographically, the seal can be attributed to the 4th century or first half of the 5th century.
* The &quot;Seal of Khingila&quot; shows a beardless ruler with radiate crown and royal ribbons, wearing a single-lapel caftan, in the name of Eškiŋgil (εϸχιγγιλο), which could correspond to one of the rulers named Khingila (χιγγιλο), or may be a Hunnic title meaning &quot;Companion of the Sword&quot;, or even &quot;Companion of the God of War&quot;.

== Local populations under the Hephthalites ==
The Hephthalites governed a confederation of various people, many of whom were probably of Iranian descent, speaking an Iranian language. Several cities, such as Balkh, Kobadiyan and possibly Samarkand, were allowed to send regional embassies to China while under Hephthalite control. Several portraits of regional ambassadors from the territories occupied by the Hephthalites (Tokharistan, Tarim Basin) are known from Chinese paintings such as the &quot;Portraits of Periodical Offering of Liang&quot;, originally painted in 526–539 CE. They were at that time under the overlordship of the Hephthalites, who led the embassies to the Southern Liang court in the early 6th century CE. A century later, under the Tang dynasty, portraits of the local people of Tokharistan were again illustrated in &quot;The Gathering of Kings&quot;, circa 650 CE. Etienne de la Vaissière has estimated the local population of each major oasis in Tokharistan and Western Turkestan during the period to around several hundreds of thousands each, while the major oasis of the Tarim Basin are more likely to have had populations ranging in the tens of thousands each.

== The Alchon Huns (formerly considered as a branch of the Hephthalites) in South Asia ==
The Alchon Huns, who invaded northern India and were known there as &quot;Hūṇas&quot;, have long been considered as a part or a sub-division of the Hephthalites, or as their eastern branch, but now tend to be considered as a separate entity, who may have been displaced by the settlement of the Hephthalites in Bactria. Historians such as Beckwith, referring to Étienne de la Vaissière, say that the Hephthalites were not necessarily one and the same as the Hunas (&quot;Sveta Huna&quot;). According to de la Vaissiere, the Hephthalites are not directly identified in classical sources alongside that of the Hunas. They were initially based in the Oxus basin in Central Asia and established their control over Gandhara in the northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent by about 465 CE. From there, they fanned out into various parts of northern, western, and central India.

In India, these invading people were called Hunas, or &quot;Sveta Huna&quot; (&quot;White Huns&quot;) in Sanskrit. The Hūṇas are mentioned in several ancient texts such as the Rāmāyaṇa, Mahābhārata, Purāṇas, and Kalidasa&#x27;s Raghuvaṃśa. The first &quot;Hunas&quot;, probably Kidarites, were initially defeated by Emperor Skandagupta of the Gupta Empire in the 5th century CE. In the early 6th century CE, the Alchon Hun &quot;Hunas&quot; in turn overran the part of the Gupta Empire that was to their southeast and had conquered Central and North India. Gupta Emperor Bhanugupta defeated the Hunas under Toramana in 510, and his son Mihirakula was repulsed by Yashodharman in 528 CE. The &quot;Hunas&quot; were driven out of India by the kings Yasodharman and Narasimhagupta, during the early 6th century.

== Possible descendants ==
A number of groups may have descended from the Hephthalites.
* Avars: suggestions have been made that the Pannonian Avars were Hepthalites who went to Europe after their collapse in 557 CE, but this is not adequately supported by archaeological or written sources.
* Pashtuns: The Hephthalites may have contributed to the ethnogenesis of Pashtuns. Yu. V. Gankovsky, a Soviet historian on Afghanistan, stated: &quot;Pashtun began as a union of largely East Iranian tribes, which became the initial ethnic stratum of the Pashtun ethnogenesis dating from the middle of the first millennium CE, and is connected with the dissolution of the Hephthalite confederacy.&quot; According to The Cambridge History of Iran the descendants of Hephthalites are Pashtuns.
** Durrani: The Durrani Pashtuns of Afghanistan were called &quot;Abdali&quot; before 1747. According to linguist Georg Morgenstierne, their tribal name &quot;Abdālī&quot; may have &quot;something to do with&quot; the Hephthalite. This hypothesis was endorsed by historian Aydogdy Kurbanov, who indicated that after the collapse of the Hephthalite confederacy, they likely assimilated into different local populations and that the Abdali may be one of the tribes of Hephthalite origin.

* Khalaj: The Khalaj people are first mentioned in the 7th–9th centuries in the area of Ghazni, Qalati Ghilji, and Zabulistan in present-day Afghanistan. They spoke Khalaj Turkic. Al-Khwarizmi mentioned them as a remnant tribe of the Hephthalites. However, according to linguist Sims-Williams, archaeological documents do not support the suggestion that the Khalaj were the Hephthalites&#x27; successors, while according to historian V. Minorsky, the Khalaj were &quot;perhaps only politically associated with the Hephthalites.&quot; Some of the Khalaj were later Pashtunized, after which they transformed into the Pashtun Ghilji tribe.
* Kanjina: a Saka tribe linked to the Indo-Iranian Kumijis and incorporated into the Hephthalites. Kanjinas were possibly Turkicized later, as al-Khwarizmi called them &quot;Kanjina Turks&quot;. However, Bosworth and Clauson contended that al-Khwarizmi was simply using &quot;Turks&quot; &quot;in the vague and inaccurate sense&quot;.
* Karluks: (or Qarlughids) were reported as settled in Ghazni and Zabulistan, present-day Afghanistan, in the thirteenth century. Many Muslim geographers identified &quot;Karluks&quot; &quot;Khallukh&quot; ~ &quot;Kharlukh&quot; with &quot;Khalajes&quot; &quot;Khalaj&quot; from confusion, as the two names were similar and these two groups dwelt near each other.
* Abdal is a name associated with the Hephthalites. It is an alternate name for the Äynu people.
** According to Orhan Köprülü, Abdal of Turkey might be descended from the Hepthalites. Albert von Le Coq mentions the relation between Abdals of Adana and Äynus of East Turkestan, by them having some common words, and by both referring to themselves as Abdals and speaking an exclusive language among themselves. Some Abdal elements can also be found in the composition of Azerbaijanis, Turkmen (Ata, Chowdur, Ersary, Saryk), Kazakhs, Uzbek-Lokays, Turks and Volga Bulgars (Savirs).

== Hephthalite rulers ==

* Akhshunwar, circa 458 CE
* Kun-khi, circa 484 CE
* Yandai Yilituo, circa 516 CE (only known from his Chinese name 厭帶夷栗陁)
* Hwade-gang (only known from the archives of the Kingdom of Rob).
* Ghadfar/Ghatifar, circa 567–568 CE.
* Faghanish (568-) (ruling in Chaghaniyan)
* Nezak Tarkan (circa 650–710)

<text>Cuernavaca (; , &quot;near the woods&quot; , Otomi: ) is the capital and largest city of the state of Morelos in Mexico. Along with Chalcaltzingo, it is likely one of the origins of the Mesoamerican civilization. Olmec works of art, currently displayed in the Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City were found in the Gualupita III archeological site. 

The city is located south of Mexico City and reached via a 90-minute drive using the Federal Highway 95D.

The name &quot;Cuernavaca&quot; is a euphonism derived from the Nahuatl toponym and means &#x27;surrounded by or close to trees&#x27;. The name was Hispanicized to &quot;Cuernavaca&quot;; Hernán Cortés called it &quot;Coadnabaced&quot; in his letters to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, and Bernal Díaz del Castillo used the name &quot;Cuautlavaca&quot; in his chronicles. The coat-of-arms of the municipality is based on the pre-Columbian pictograph emblem of the city that depicts a tree trunk () with three branches, with foliage, and four roots colored red. There is a cut in the trunk in the form of a mouth, from which emerges a speech scroll, probably representing the language Nahuatl and by extension the locative suffix , meaning &#x27;near&#x27;.

Cuernavaca has long been a favorite escape for Mexico City residents and foreign visitors because of its warm, stable climate and abundant vegetation. The municipality was designated a Forest Protection Zone by President Lázaro Cárdenas in 1937 to protect the aquifers, the vegetation, and the quality of life of residents, both in Mexico City and locally. The city was nicknamed the &quot;City of Eternal Spring&quot; by Alexander von Humboldt in the 19th century. 
Aztec emperors had summer residences there, and considering its location of just a 1½-hour drive from Mexico City, today many Mexico City residents maintain homes there. Cuernavaca is also host to a large foreign resident population, including large numbers of students who come to study the Spanish language.

==The city==

===City of Eternal Spring===

Cuernavaca was one of the cities of the world nicknamed &quot;City of Eternal Spring&quot;. This appelative derived from Alexander von Humboldt&#x27;s &quot;Researches concerning the institutions &amp; monuments of the ancient inhabitants of America...:&quot;

The city is located in a tropical region, but its temperature is fairly constant at . It is located on the southern slope of the &quot;Sierra de Chichinautzin&quot; mountains. In the morning, warm air flows up the mountains from the valley below and in the late afternoon, cooler air flows down from the higher elevations. One ubiquitous flowering plant in the city is the bougainvillea.

This pleasant climate has attracted royalty and nobles since Aztec times. Foreign princes, archdukes, and other nobles have been attracted to this place because of its flowers, sun, fruits, fresh-water springs, and waterfalls. Emperor Maximilian I of Mexico set up a country residence in the city. Philanthropist Barbara Hutton, who held several aristocratic titles through marriage, had a home on the outskirts of the city. Princess Maria Beatrice of Savoy (b. 1943) lived there from 1971 to 1999, and the Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, lived in exile in the city following the Iranian Revolution. Although a native of the U.S., Bauhaus designer Michael van Beuren established his residence in a family hacienda in Cuernavaca while fleeing the rise of the Nazi regime in Germany (where he studied and practiced his profession), and a colony of Bauhaus designers grew in the city during World War II.

=== Cuernavaca metropolitan area ===

Cuernavaca always has been a popular place for people from Mexico City to escape the city. In the 20th century, the climate and flora began to attract many foreigners as well. Population increase in this urban area began in 1940, but the metro area was not created, nor recognized, until the 1960s. From this time the population and the extension of the metropolitan area have grown. From 1960 to 1980, the population had grown from 85,620 to 368,166. From the 1980s to the present, the municipalities of Emiliano Zapata, Jiutepec, Temixco, Tepoztlán, and Xochitepec have been added to the metropolitan area. These municipalities have seen the highest rates of growth, however; population and economic activity remain concentrated in the city of Cuernavaca proper. The metropolitan area has a population of 912,024 and the municipality has 366,321 inhabitants, as of 2015.

Over the decades since 1970, this metropolitan area has become more economically and socially integrated with the Mexico City metropolitan area. Many people from Mexico City own second homes there for weekend retreats, both for the climate and for the well-developed infrastructure. Starting in the 1980s permanent migration of Mexico City residents began, spurred by pollution and crime problems in the capital. The 1985 Mexico City earthquake also pushed many well-to-do families there, fearful of the next catastrophe. In many of these cases, the main breadwinner commutes each day to work in Mexico City. This has produced a considerable increase in housing developments on the outskirts of the city, especially in the late 1990s and 2000s. This influx has had a positive economic benefit for the city but has put pressure on the infrastructure as well. 85% of the city of Cuernavaca is dedicated to housing, and much of this is in middle-class housing developments such as &quot;Rancho Cortés, Rancho Tetela&quot;, and &quot;Colonia del Bosque&quot;, which are located on the outskirts of the city. Lower-income housing is concentrated in the city proper.

==History==

===Indigenous peoples===

Burials dated to c. 1000 BCE have been found in Gualupita, Morelos, in the north of the city.

The first major culture to inhabit this area was the Tlahuica, whose main settlement was where the city of Cuernavaca is today. The Tlahuicas have inhabited this area at least since the 12th century.

The first incursions south into the area by peoples of the Valley of Mexico occurred in the 12th century, when a lord named Xolotl (ruler of Tetzcoco) conquered most of the Valley of Mexico. An allied Chichimeca tribe also moved south into what is now northern Morelos state, making Techintecuitla lord of the Cuauhnahuac (as they called the city) area, with the Tlahuicas concentrated in the nearby towns of Yecapixtla and Yautecatle. According to the Tlatelolco Annals, in 1365, the lord of Cuauhnahuac, Macuilxochitl, tried to conquer lands as far as the Valley of Mexico, but was met by the lord of Chalco, Tzalcualtitlan, with similar ambitions.

The first Aztec emperor, Acamapichtli, began to expand his empire to the south of the Valley of Mexico and beyond in the 1370s. His successor, Huitzilihuitl, was eager to press on into what is now Morelos state because of the cotton grown there, it was called &quot;Tlalnahuatl&quot; at that time. He asked to marry the daughter of the ruler of Tlalnahuatl but was rejected. That rejection started a war that ended with an Aztec victory in 1396. &quot;Huitziliuitl&quot; then married the princess and Moctezuma I was born of the union. Credit for the conquest of Cuernavaca is given to Acamapichtli in the &quot;Mendocino Codex&quot;, but later writings cite Itzcóatl, or even Moctezuma I, as the conqueror. The conquered dominion, &quot;Tlalnahuac&quot;, was roughly the size of the modern state of Morelos, and subsequently was renamed as &quot;Cuauhnahuac&quot; by the Aztecs.

From 1403 to 1426, this province grew in strength, subduing neighboring peoples such as the &quot;Coauixcas&quot;. Eventually, the province, then ruled by Miquiuix, rebelled against the Aztec Empire. This rebellion was put down by Totoquihuatzin and Netzahualcoyotl in 1433. This area then joined in the conquests of what now are known as Taxco, Tepecuacuilco, and Ocuilán. For tribute purposes, the dominion was divided into two zones, one headed by Cuauhnahuac and the other by Huaxtepec.

===Spanish Conquest and colonization===
At the time of the Spanish Conquest, Itzohuatzin was governing Cuauhnahuac. It was a rich city and densely populated, with large farms and its characteristic ravines bridged over. The Spanish marched on Cuernavaca even before taking the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan. They were led by Gonzalo de Sandoval and he was joined later by the conquistador, Hernán Cortés. The bridges were destroyed to prevent the Spanish from entering the city, but they were able to cross on a fallen tree. The Spanish troops pillaged and burned the city before retiring to nearby Acapantzingo, where they celebrated the first mass in Morelos on Sunday, 14 April 1521, before continuing their march on the capital. The Spanish had difficulty pronouncing the Nahua name of the city and changed it to &quot;Cuernavaca.&quot;

Cortés returned to Cuernavaca in 1523, stopping in Tlaltenango, where he founded the Church of San José and constructed the first sugar plantation. The fertility of these lands compelled the conquistador to found his favorite residence here. Juana de Zúñiga, Cortes&#x27;s wife, lived in Cuernavaca in the palace that was constructed in 1526. Cortes then moved the hacienda in Tlaltenango to Amatitlan. The Franciscans arrived in Cuernavaca in 1529 and founded their 5th monastery in New Spain there. This first group included &quot;Martín de Lua, Francisco Martínez, Luis Ortiz, Juan de Cervo, Francisco de Soto, Andrés de Córdova, Martín de Jesús, Juan Juárez, Juan de Motolinía&quot;, and &quot;Juan García de Cervo&quot;. Originally they lived at the San Francisquito hermitage, but later they constructed the open-air chapel, Capilla Abierta, at what was to become a monastery and eventually the Cuernavaca Cathedral. They extended their presence into the neighboring communities of Tetecala, Jiutepec, and Tlaquiltenango, among others, eventually forming the province of Santo Evangelio, which would be part of the province of Mexico in 1543.

In 1646, this province was reorganized several times. Cuernavaca and Cuautla became high mayorships which answered directly to the viceregal authorities in Mexico City. In 1786, New Spain was divided into twelve provinces and in 1824, Cuernavaca was initially a district of Mexico City.

===Independence to Revolution===
During the Mexican War of Independence, José María Morelos was imprisoned at the Palacio de Cortés in November 1815. Agustín de Iturbide&#x27;s army passed through Cuernavaca to fight Vicente Guerrero in 1820 and came through again in 1821, as the head of the Ejército Trigarante. After Independence and with the Constitution of 1824, the territory now known as the State of Morelos became part of the State of Mexico. Between 1827 and 1829, Cuernavaca was a district of this state. From 1829 to 1833, it was called a prefecture. In 1833, the State of Mexico declared the Atlacomulco Hacienda, which contains the Palacio de Cortés and Cortés&#x27;s houses in Coyoacán, to be public property.
In 1834, Ignacio Echevarría and José María Tornel drafted the Plan of Cuernavaca, which permitted Antonio López de Santa Anna to disregard the laws protecting church property, exile Valentín Gómez Farías, reopen the university, and dissolve the tribunal that was set to convict Anastasio Bustamante for the assassination of Vicente Guerrero. In the same year, the State of Mexico declared Cuernavaca to be a city.

During the Mexican–American War (1846-1847), Cuernavaca was captured by the Cadwalader Brigade and was forced to pay retributions to the U.S. Army after the Cuernavaca Infantry under Francisco Modesto Olabuibel fell.

During the Ayutla Rebellion in 1854, Santa Anna was forced out of the capital of Mexico City in 1855. He moved his government to Cuernavaca, reorganized it, and named a junta to elect an interim president. This junta consisted of Valentín Gómez Farías, Melchor Ocampo, Benito Juárez, Francisco de P. Zendejas, Diego Álvarez, and Joaquín Moreno. They then voted for Alvarez as president. This new president swore to uphold the Plan of Ayutla and his inauguration was celebrated with much pomp in the city. Ministers from Guatemala, the United States, and Great Britain, as well as the Apostolic Delegate and the Consuls of Belgium, Chile, and some Asian countries, moved to Cuernavaca and recognized the Álvarez government.

In 1853, the District of Cuernavaca and the District of Mexico were declared separate.

During the Reform War (1857–1860) when conservatives rejected the liberal constitution of 1857, Juan Vicario voiced the cry of &quot;Religión y Fueros&quot; (Religion and Immunity) in Cuernavaca on 13 January 1858. In 1861, the Government of the State of Mexico created the districts of Cuernavaca, Jonacatepec, Tautepec, and Tetecala.

In order to facilitate operations against the French during the French Intervention, President Juarez divided the State of Mexico into three military districts. The third consisted of the territories of Cuernavaca, Yautepec, and Tetecala, with its capital in the city of Cuernavaca. Soon thereafter, this district fell into French hands. Maximilian I converted the Borda Garden into his summer residence and bought land in nearby Acapantzingo to construct a chalet. This prompted the construction of the Mexico-Cuernavaca highway.

When the French-installed monarch fell in 1867, Republican forces under Francisco Leyva, Ignacio Figueroa, and Ignacio Manuel Altamirano laid siege to Cuernavaca, which was defended by General Joaquín Ayestarán. The attackers cut off water supplies to the city and attacked on 3 January, but were met with a long series of street battles throughout the city. During the fighting, the general was killed and the Republican forces withdrew, victorious, to Mexico City, but only after burning a large portion of the city.
The State of Morelos was created in April 1869, with General Francisco Leyva as its first governor. Cuernavaca was declared the capital of the new state in November of the same year. In 1877, under Governor Carlos Pacheco, the Toluca-Cuernavaca highway was built and a rail connection created between Cuernavaca and Mexico City. The Porfirio Díaz Theater was opened in February 1882, and the first Public Health Board in the city was established the same year. In 1891, the Diocese of Cuernavaca was established by Pope Leo XII, comprising the entire state of Morelos, with Hipolito Vera as the first bishop of Cuernavaca. The first locomotive arrived on 1 December 1897, and a bridge was constructed to connect the center of the city with the train station. The Bank of Morelos was founded in 1903.

===Mexican Revolution and 20th century===

In 1909, the anti-reelection movement was established in Cuernavaca, and by the end of this same year guerilla operations against the Diaz government were headed by Genovevo de la O in Santa María Ahuacatitlán. Emiliano Zapata took over the movement in the south and named De la O in charge of the Cuernavaca area. On 21 May 1911, Cuernavaca was evacuated by government troops, leaving the entire state in rebel hands. Professor Brunk, describing Zapata&#x27;s triumph, writes &quot;On the twenty-sixth, at 4 o&#x27;clock on a bright Friday afternoon, Zapata rode triumphantly into that city at the head of four thousand troops. Waving images of the Virgin of Guadalupe overhead, these revolutionaries were a ragged lot in the eyes of the urbane. But to the throngs who greeted them - the common people of Morelos, the young girls with armfuls of bougainvillea - they were conquering heroes.&quot; President Francisco I. Madero visited the city on 12 June 1911, and he attended a banquet in the Borda Garden. The city later fell to the forces of Huerta, and Zapata began to lay siege to Cuernavaca in May 1914 with 3,600 men, falling by August. Later, on 26 January 1915, the Revolutionary government was moved to the city, in defiance of Carranza and the Constitutionalists. However, Zapata lost control of Cuernavaca on 2 May 1916 and was forced to return to guerilla warfare.

The Spanish flu came to Cuernavaca in 1918, leaving only 3,000 survivors, although by May 1920 it had a population of 12,799.

Wealthy North Americans and Europeans established secondary residences in Cuernavaca and took long vacations there or frequently traveled back and forth, while servants maintained the haciendas in their absence. Sometimes, their offspring have made Cuernavaca their permanent residence, creating an enclave of natives with international roots bearing the influence of their cultures. For example, when the American designer, Michael van Beuren fled Germany with members of Bauhaus, where he was practicing his profession, he took up residence at the vacation hacienda of his parents in Cuernavaca, and stayed permanently, establishing his factory nearby and raising his family there. Others in his family began to reside there year &#x27;round. Their children were natives of Mexico. 

After his installation as U.S. Ambassador to Mexico in 1927, American businessman Dwight Morrow established a weekend home in Cuernavaca on the street that today bears his name. It was here that his daughter Anne met famed aviator Charles Lindbergh, whom Morrow had invited to Mexico. In celebration of his daughter&#x27;s engagement to Lindbergh and to thank the people of Cuernavaca, in 1929 Morrow commissioned Diego Rivera to paint the mural &quot;History of Morelos, Conquest and Revolution&quot; at the Palacio de Cortes.

During the 1920s and 1930s, Cuernavaca became a place to vacation and gamble when the Hotel de la Selva was converted into the Casino de la Selva, which attracted people such as Rita Hayworth, Bugsy Siegel, and Al Capone to Cuernavaca, however, gambling was shut down by Lázaro Cárdenas in 1934. He is the same president who declared the area a ZPG (Forest Protection Zone). The casino hosted very important artistic works, including murals of Alvarez Icaza, Messeguer, and the architecture of Candela. The main vault was considered to be the &quot;Mexican Sistine Chapel&quot; by Nobel Prize author, Gabriel García Márquez.

1936 was the year that Malcolm Lowry wrote his short story, &quot;Under The Volcano&quot;, which inspired his 1947 novel of the same name. It has never gone out of print and was made into a movie in 1984. Cuernavaca, or Quaunahuac, as it is called in the novel, and the surrounding area, figure prominently in this great historical novel, where extensive details on Mexican history, culture, topography, and especially, politics and religion figure prominently. The recurrent artifacts are the twin volcanos, Popocatepetl and Iztaccihuatl, and the barranca, symbols of division, death, and rebirth in the city of eternal spring.

Dr. Sergio Méndez Arceo became bishop of Cuernavaca in 1952. Mendez was known as a leading voice of &quot;Liberation Theology&quot; and he was a human rights activist.

In 1956, Erich Fromm founded the Sociedad Mexicana de Psicoanálisis and from his house in Cuernavaca promoted new ideas in the field of psychiatry, incorporating Zen Buddhism and &quot;communal psychoanalytic studies&quot; (estudios psicoanalíticos comunitarios). This attracted many artists, composers, architects, and counterculture types here. In the 1960s, the city was one of the centers of the psychedelic movement. Timothy Leary tried psilocybin mushrooms there in the summer of 1960 and came back regularly to repeat the experience.

There was a riot in Cuernavaca in February 1957 after a police officer shot and killed Jorge Garrigós.

In 1966, Austrian priest Ivan Illich founded the &quot;Centro Intercultural de Documentación&quot; (CIDOC) to teach Spanish language and culture to North American missionaries. This center was closed by order of the Vatican in 1969, but several of the teachers continued elsewhere in the city, making Cuernavaca a leading center of Spanish-language teaching for foreigners.

More recently the city has seen a very active society dedicated to the preservation of its environment and cultural heritage. The &quot;Frente Civico&quot; which is now influential throughout the country, along with some 150 other organizations has promoted a boycott against Costco for having destroyed the Casino de la Selva to build a couple of warehouses. One of its members, Professor Jaime Lagunez, lobbied a general agreement in the national congress for the purpose of protecting its sixty archeological sites, its vegetation, historic center, and neighboring forests, among other important cultural aspects of the city. The &quot;Frente Civico&quot; received the 2004 National Mendez Arceo Human Rights Award for having protected the world cultural heritage found in the city.

===21st century===
The 19 September 2017 earthquake with a magnitude of 7.1 killed four people and damaged or destroyed 180 homes, 11 churches, and 10 other Cuernavaca buildings, including the Cortés Palace, the cathedral, and the landmark &quot;Torre Latinoamericana&quot;, according to Fernando Manrique Rivas, general director of &quot;Protección Civil de Cuernavaca&quot;.

Cuernavaca instituted a curfew and possible arrest for 36 hours for violators during the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico. Open-air restaurants and bars were closed. Mayor Antonio Villalobos Adan commented on 1 May that the city needs a new cemetery with capacity for 15,000 people, since the city&#x27;s seven cemeteries are all saturated. It is already estimated that 40% of the population in the Antonio Barona neighborhood has been contaminated by COVID-19. On 2 June, Cuernavaca reported 393 confirmed cases and 83 deaths from the virus; the reopening of the state was pushed back until at least 13 June. Cuernavaca reported 1,322 cases, 1,015 recoveries, and 223 deaths on 31 August. 2,566 cases were reported on 27 December 2020.

Four bottles of the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine were stolen from &quot;Carlos Calero Elorduy Hospital&quot; run by SEDENA on 14 January. This hospital plus the G. Parres general hospital, both dedicated to the care of serious COVID-19 cases, reached 100% capacity on 15 January 2021.

==Points of interest==

===Palace of Cortés===

The Palacio de Cortés is east of the Morelos Garden and is considered to be the most representative building of Cuernavaca. Built by Hernán Cortés, it was finished in 1535. It is one of the oldest European-style, civil constructions in the Americas, but is executed in Renaissance style. The series of arches of the central terrace, the battlements, and the thick walls are the most representative aspects of the original construction. It is said that this residence looks much like the mansion built in Santo Domingo by Diego Colón, the son of Christopher Columbus. Just outside the front of the building is an old pyramid base over which Cortés had the structure built, on a hill that dominated the old city. Petroglyphs recovered from the site and from throughout the city are on display. From right to left the petroglyphs are named Lagarto de San Antón, Aguila de Chapultepec, Piedra Chimalli, or Piedra de los Encantos.

After having been the residence of Cortés and his descendants for several centuries, the building became a warehouse, a jail, a military barracks, and then the State Government Palace (until 1969). From 1971 to 1973, the building was restored extensively and today houses the &quot;Museo Regional Cuauhnáhuac&quot;, dedicated to the history of Morelos State. It often is referred to as &quot;the Palacio of Cortes&quot;. It has ten exhibit halls with maps, illustrations, photographs, works of art, and everyday items from various epochs representing the first human settlements in the state to the present day. It has murals created by Diego Rivera that reflect both Morelos and Mexican history. Adjacent to the Palacio a permanent local handicraft market in which one may purchase silver jewelry, T-shirts, beaded bracelets, pottery, hammocks, blankets, and much more.

===Morelos and Juárez Gardens===

The Juárez and Morelos Gardens are in the center of the city, both of which are plazas lined with trees. Between the two is the State Government Palace, a three-story building with a tezontle façade built between 1955 and 1969. The Morelos Garden dates from 1908 and is easily recognizable by the large stone statue of José María Morelos, which is known colloquially as &quot;Morelotes&quot;. The Juárez Garden is located to the north of the State Government Palace and is the oldest public square in Cuernavaca. The Garden contains a kiosk sometimes said to be designed by Gustave Eiffel and brought from Britain toward the end of the 19th century. Unlike most main squares in Mexico, neither of these open up the way to the main cathedral. The main cathedral in Cuernavaca is located a few blocks west of the square.

These two gardens or plazas are known colloquially as the &quot;zócalo&quot;. Spectacles are often to be seen here and can include people dancing the &quot;danzón&quot; or other popular dances and &quot;estudiantinas&quot; dressed in colonial-era Spanish garb, playing instruments and dancing, and any number of free concerts. Often clowns perform on the zocalo as well, with balloons and tricks for the children and tell double-entendre jokes for the adults. Locals use the plazas to sell products such as honey, yogurt, traditional candies, and crafts. Street food such as corn on the cob, snow cones, candies, fruit smoothies, and more generally are available.

===Cathedral===
Cuernavaca Cathedral is the main church of what was the monastery of the Third Order of the Franciscans, called La Asunción, that dates back to the 16th century. It sits on the southeast corner of a large atrium, which also contains a number of other chapels that were built at different times and with different architectural styles. This complex is located at the intersection of Hidalgo and Morelos streets, a few blocks west of the town center.

The cathedral was built by Cortés to double as a fortress, with cannons mounted above the buttresses. Over time, this church underwent a number of transformations, updating its interior. This was undone in the mid-20th century, when restoration work removed all the Neoclassical altars and images. These now are stored in the cathedral&#x27;s pinacotheca and not available to the public. Restoration work uncovered al fresco murals on the lateral walls, relating to the martyrdom of Philip of Jesus, the first Mexican canonized as a saint. The only other decoration inside this church now is a modern-style crucifix and an image of the Assumption of Mary. This restoration work was carried out by Bishop Sergio Méndez Arceo.

After the Reform Laws in the 1860s, most of the monastery property passed into state, then private hands, leaving only what is now the cathedral and several smaller chapels on a very large atrium. The Revolution Garden was the orchard of the Cathedral, and the cloister with its observatory, is now the Robert Brady Museum. The church became the Cathedral of Cuernavaca in 1891.
Next to the cathedral is the &quot;open chapel&quot; (&quot;capilla abierta&quot;) of San José, which is an original structure built in the 16th century. It also was rescued and restored by Bishop Méndez Arceo and is one of the oldest constructions on the site. The building consists of a vault with three arches that face the atrium. These arches are supported by a pair of flying buttresses. Inside the arches is an altarpiece dating from the 17th century.

The main entrance is on Hidalgo Street, where one passes between two large chapels called the Chapel of Santa Cruz and the Chapel of the Tercera Orden. The Tercera Orden is considered to be the more valuable artistically of the two, with its highly sculpted early Baroque main and side portals painted in various colors. Inside, there is a later Churrigueresque main altar. A third chapel, called the Chapel of Nuestra Señora de los Dolores is farther into the atrium and near the Open Chapel of San José. The bell tower was added in 1713. The cathedral was damaged during the September 2017 earthquake, but it has since been restored.

====Other churches of interest====

*Parish of &quot;Los Tres Reyes Magos&quot; in Tetela was built in the 16th century by Franciscan monks. It is Baroque style, and there is a fresco inside painted by Marcos Aldaña. The stone fence around the perimeter of the church was designed by British sculptor John Spencer in the 1980s.
*&quot;El Calvario&quot; refers to two buildings just north of the Historic Center of Cuernavaca. The smaller is a &quot;chapitel&quot; (open-air chapel) built in 1538 at what was then the entrance to the city. It gets its name from the cross on top. There is a fountain in front called &quot;Fuente de los Leones&quot; or &quot;Fuente de las Ranas&quot;. In 1772 the chapitel was dedicated to the Virgin of Guadalupe, and there is a large fair every 12 December. The larger building is the church of &quot;San Jose&quot;, built in 1939.
*The Church of &quot;Tepetates&quot;, built in the 16th century at the time of the conquest of Cuauhnáhuac, was named after the type of soil found in the area. It is located off Guerrero Street in the old district of Tecoac, which was one of the five neighborhoods that made up the center of the City of Cuernavaca. For years it was the symbol of the city due to its picturesque façade flanked by two cypresses. This temple is designed in neoclassic style, dedicated to Jesus of Nazareth. The church a small atrium, an open chapel, and a nave in addition to two bells that date from 1791. Fr. William Wasson founded the orphanage &quot;Nuestros Pequeños Hermanos&quot; here in 1954.

Just east of Ocotepec is the Benedictine monastery of &quot;Nuestra Señora de los Angeles&quot; designed by Gabriel Chávez de la Mora. The chapel is round and is used for Catholic retreats.

There are a number of non-Catholic churches in Cuernavaca also, notably the Episcopal Cathedral of &quot;San Miguel Arcángel&quot; located at the corner of Calles Guerrero and Santos, Centro Historico.
===Teopanzolco===
Teopanzolco is an archeological site located just east of the historic downtown of Cuernavaca. Until recently its construction was dated to the year 1427, but new evidence revealed by 19 September 2017 earthquake suggests the original structure was built between 1150 and 1200 CE. Teopanzolco was an important ceremonial center during the 15th and 16th centuries when the native Tlahuicas were dominated by the Aztecs. The site shows significant Aztec influence. It has a large pyramidal base, called the &quot;Gran Basamento&quot;, topped by two shrines, much like the Templo Mayor in Tenochtitlan. In fact, the new finds indicate that Teopanzolco predates the Templo Mayor and served as a model for the latter. Only the stone columns of these shrines remain today. The teocalli, (sacred plaza) contains fourteen monuments including a circular altar dedicated to the wind deity Ehécatl. There are also two concentric structures separated by a moat or ditch. Both might have been dedicated to Quetzalcoatl, the feathered-serpent deity, or to Tlāloc, god or rain. The ruins were discovered during the &quot;Siege of Cuernavaca&quot; in 1914 as the &quot;Zapatistas&quot; used the heights to place their cannons.

====Centro Cultural Teopanzolco====
The Cultural Center next to the pyramids has recently been remodeled and now includes several first-class concert halls. There is outside seating facing the pyramids where one can see a video mapping of the pyramid site (Spanish only).

===Borda Garden===

The Borda Garden is located near the cathedral on Morelos Street. Originally, this was a house bought by José de la Borda, the mining magnate of Taxco in the mid-18th century. Later, his son, Manuel de Borda y Verdugo, transformed the grounds of the house into gardens filled with flower and fruit trees to satisfy his passion for botany. These gardens also contain a number of fountains and an artificial lake that were completed in 1783. Today the complex contains an art gallery, offices, a restaurant, and an open-air theater. In 1865, this was the summer home of Emperor Maximilian I and his wife Carlota Amalia. Some sources say the emperor met his mistress, &quot;La India Bonita&quot;, there, (although other sources say they met at his home called &quot;El Olindo&quot; in Acapantzingo.) In the late 19th and early 20th centuries the Borda Garden sponsored soirees, such as those sponsored by Porfirio Díaz and Emiliano Zapata. Today the area is a public park where the gardens have been maintained and it is possible to take a short boat ride on the lake. The house has been converted into a museum. Six of its halls are dedicated to temporary exhibits while the other seven are devoted to recreating the characteristics of the 18th and 19th centuries.

The Church of Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe is located next to the Borda Garden, and was constructed by Manuel de la Borda in 1784. It has a Baroque façade and what is considered to be the best cupola in the city. It was the royal chapel of Emperor Maximilian. The cupola was badly damaged in the earthquake of 2017.

===Robert Brady Museum===
The Robert Brady Museum is on Nezahualcoyotl Street and occupies the building known as the &quot;Casa de la Torre&quot;, originally part of the monastery of La Asunción. In 1960, it was purchased by the U.S. artist, Robert Brady, who transformed it into his home and a private art and collectible museum. It contains a collection of art and crafts from around the world as well as the original &quot;Self-Portrait with Monkey&quot; painted by Frida Kahlo. Other works are by artists such as Miguel Cobarruvias, Pelegrí Clavé, María Izquierdo, and Rufino Tamayo. Non-Mexican paintings include those from North America and Europe. Other objects in the collection include antique furniture, African and Indian crafts, and archeological pieces. The collection occupies fourteen rooms of the old house, which has been kept mostly the way it was when Brady died in 1986 and bequeathed the house and its contents to the city.

===Tlaltenango===
Tlaltenango used to be a separate town, but now is a neighborhood of Cuernavaca city. The main attraction there is the church compound containing the Church of San José and the Church of Nuestra Señora de los Milagros de Tlaltenango. San José is one of the oldest churches in Mexico, built between 1521 and 1523. Two centuries later an image of the Virgin appeared to members of this village, prompting the building of the second church. This is the Sanctuary of Nuestra Señora de los Milagros, which was built in 1730, with its bell towers built at the end of the 19th century.

===Hacienda Atlacomulco===
The Hacienda de San Antonio Atlacomulco is located south of the Cuernavaca and was established by Hernán Cortés as one of the first sugar plantations in Mexico. Descendants of the Conquistador held the property until the 19th century, when it became the property of Lucas Alamán, who modernized the facility. The hacienda lost its surrounding properties during the Mexican Revolution and all that remains is the main house. After a long period of restoration and modification, the hacienda today houses an exclusive hotel, which can accommodate conventions and banquets.

===Museum of Traditional and Herbal Medicine and the Ethnicbotanical garden===
South of the city center is Acapantzingo, which had been a separate town, but now is part of the city. A large farm owned by Emperor Maximilian I existed there in the 1860s. It was named Olindo, referring to a character in the poem by Torquato Tasso. The emperor used this property as one of his residences in Cuernavaca, and according to rumor, to enjoy the company of a certain beautiful Indian woman. On this farm and in what was the Pavilion, is now the Museum of Traditional and Herbal Medicine (Museo de Medicina Tradicional). The museum sponsors workshops and classes on the use of plants to make soap, cremes, dyes, decorative objects and more. Outside is the ethnicbotanical garden with exhibits including 800 species of plants organized by uses, such as the making of textiles, animal feed, condiments, ritual, and others.

===Chapultepec Ecological Park===
The Chapultepec Ecological Park is located about four km southeast of the Cuernavaca city center. It contains fresh-water springs, which form the beginning of a river, and is surrounded by large trees called Chapultepec. It is a public park administered by the State Commission of Water and Environment. In addition to playgrounds, the park has constructed habitats for monkeys, birds, butterflies, crocodiles, reptiles, aquatic plants, and orchids. It also has a petting zoo, environmental museum, planetarium, house of terror, theater, and tour train. Beginning December 2018, Diana Ríos, a Mexican designer and artist working with the company &quot;Veneno Ríos&quot; is in charge of creating a new façade called &quot;Metamorphosis&quot; inspired in evolution and species changes as well as the love of nature in Morelos. Featured species are the &quot;cangrejito barranqueño&quot; (a crab), the &quot;carpita morelense&quot; (carp), and the &quot;amate amarillo&quot; (yellow fig tree).

===Chapitel del Calvario===
The Chapitel del Calvario is a church located at the corner of Morelos and Matamoros Streets, which was constructed in 1532. The word &quot;chapitel&quot; means &quot;spire&quot; as the church is named after two spires that define its appearance. It also has a fourteen-meter-high dome. It was constructed in the 16th century and was the last building encountered within Cuernavaca, as one left the city on the road to Mexico City. In 1772, this church was dedicated to the Virgin of Guadalupe.

===El Castillito===
The &quot;Museo de Fotografía Antigua&quot;, also known as &quot;El Castillito&quot; (the little castle), is located one block from the &quot;Chapitel del Calvario&quot;. It is a very small, brick building that dates from the early 20th century when it was built as a home for the caretaker of the park that is next to the bridge built by Porfirio Diaz. It was later abandoned until Governor Vicente Estrada Cajigal remodeled it as his residence. Since 1986 it has been a small museum dedicated to antique photographs of the city of Cuernavaca.

===Salto de San Antón / St. Anthony Waterfall===

The Salto de San Anton is a large ravine with a thin but tall waterfall located in the neighborhood of &quot;San Anton Analco&quot; on the west side of Cuernavaca. The waterfall is high, with its water coming from a small tributary of the Zempoala River. The vertical walls of the ravine are of basalt and broad-leafed vegetation grows in nooks and crannies of the stone. A series of stairs and platforms have been built to enable access to the waterfall area from the park above. 

===Museo Morelense de Arte Contemporáneo Juan Soriano===

The museum was designed by the architect Javier Sanchez and it cost 300 million pesos (US$15 million) to build.

===Ravine of Amanalco Park / Barranca de Amanalco===
The ravines of Cuernavaca play a major role in regulating the climate of the city. One of the most important is the Ravine of Amanalco, which served as a natural defensive line for the city of Cuauhuanauc during the Spanish conquest of 1520, until Hernán Cortés managed to cross it where the modern &quot;Puente del Diablo&quot; is located.

The Ravine of Amanalco Park opened in the 1990s and features a 352-meter long walkway beginning at the Porfirio Díaz bridge and ending at the arches of a colonial-era aqueduct of Carlos Cuagila Street. It is a peaceful walk under dense foliage, and the only sounds you will hear are the birds and the running water.

One can view of the under area of the bridge, which was built at the end of the 19th century in order to connect the center of the city and the railway station via trolly.

===La Tallera David Alfaro Siqueiros / David Alfaro Siqueiros House &amp; Studio===
The David Alfaro Siqueiros House and Studio in Cuernavaca, was donated to &quot;the people of Mexico&quot; by David Alfaro Siqueiros (1896–1974). In the late fifties, Siqueiros was creating the mural &quot;Del Porfirismo a la Revolución&quot; (1957–66). On 9 August 1960, this project was abandoned because he was charged with the crime of &quot;social dissolution&quot; and the muralist was imprisoned. When he left prison in 1964, Siqueiros finished the mural and built a house and workshop in the city of Cuernavaca. There, he lived and executed the mural &quot;La Marcha de la Humanidad&quot; (1971–73), currently located at the Polyforum Siqueiros.

The house/workshop is located in &quot;Parque Siqueiros&quot; at the intersection of Calles Marte and Venus, Colonia Jardines de Cuernavaca. It is recommended that one enter from Calle Marte in order to fully appreciate the recently restored murals outside. Free.

The Huehuechis, a dance group, was started in Cuernavaca in 1870 by a group of young people. They dressed up in old boots and clothes, covering their faces with cloth, dancing sponteaneously in the streets with whistles and shouts. The name comes from a Nahuatl word for old, worn-out clothing. The event spread to other municipalities. It became popular enough among participants and spectators alike to be organized formally in 1871, when it became a traditional way to celebrate the days just before Lent, or the Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday of Carnival. The tradition spread to Tepoztlan, where it became even more famous after the people there modified the clothing worn, adding masks with beards and large mustaches. The dance there was renamed &quot;Chinelos&quot;. This new version became a fixture at the carnaval of Yautepec and other towns in Morelos as well.

===International presence in Cuernavaca===
Cuernavaca has been a getaway, especially for the well-to-do, since Aztec times. This has continued to the 21st century, with many of these residents including artists, intellectuals, and film stars. María Félix, a Mexican diva, had an opulent, cobalt-blue and papaya-colored villa on Avenida Palmira, along with five other houses. It is known as the &quot;Casa de las Tortugas&quot; (House of the Turtles) and has Louis XV beds, is adorned with silk brocades, Venetian mosaics, Talavera urns, marble fireplaces, sixteenth-century Spanish armor, Italian gilded chairs, and portraits of her created by Antoine Tzapoff.

U.S. Ambassador and businessman Dwight Morrow had a weekend house called &quot;Casa Mañana&quot; on the street that bears his name downtown. Morrow commissioned the artist Diego Rivera to paint the murals of the Palacio de Cortes. Today the restaurant &quot;La India Bonita&quot; is housed there. The restaurant is named for Concepción Sedano, the legendary mistress of Emperor Maximilia I. There is a painting of Maximilian and Concepcion by &quot;Taracena&quot; in the City Museum. You can also see Rivera murals at the restaurant &quot;Casa Rivera&quot;, which was once the home of the Mexican actor Mario Moreno Cantinflas. The restaurant is on Juarez, across from the Palacio de Cortes.

The legalization of gambling for a short time in the 1930s attracted Hollywood stars and mobsters from the United States. Cuernavaca was the setting of Malcolm Lowry&#x27;s &quot;Under the Volcano&quot; written in 1947. It is a tale of despair and self-destruction due to alcoholism. In the 1950s and 1960s, the city attracted many directors, producers, and actors from Hollywood, many of whom had been blacklisted through the influence of McCarthyism.

Cuernavaca became the host of the CIDOC (Centro Intercultural de Documentación) in 1961, a Catholic institution that indoctrinated priests from developed countries before they were deployed elsewhere in Latin America. CIDOC&#x27;s lasting reputation was assured by its founding director Ivan Illich, though it closed, &quot;a victim of its own success&quot;, ten years later under right-wing political pressure. In the 1960s, the city became one of the centers of the psychedelic movement, attracting many artists, composers, and hippies. Another infamous resident was Sam &quot;Momo&quot; Giancana, a mafia boss associated with the Saint Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre in Chicago, made Cuernavaca his home from 1967 until his arrest and deportation in 1974.

Gene Gauntier, actress and scenarist of silent film, spent the rest of her life in Cuernavaca. She lived in her sister&#x27;s home, Marguerite Wenner-Gren, wife of Swedish millionaire Axel Wenner-Gren who owned a hacienda in &quot;Rancho Cortés&quot; (today Hotel Racquet). Gauntier died in 1966. Racquet Club (English) retrieved Dec 16, 2018

The trend continues today, with a large number of retirees, diplomats, business executives, royalty, and government officials living in Cuernavaca from all over the world. Many of these foreign residents have formed active expatriate groups, such as the &quot;Cuernavaca Newcomers Club&quot; to offer get-togethers and advice for its members and newcomers to the city. Services for foreign residents include a large network of English-speaking doctors, foreign mass media via satellite, and ATMs networked to U.S. banks.

The deposed Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi lived for a short time in Cuernavaca in 1979. His move was arranged by David Rockefeller of Chase Manhattan Bank. The Iran hostage crisis was set off when he moved to New York City for medical treatment.

Princess Maria Beatrice of Savoy, the youngest daughter of King Umberto II of Italy, lived in Colonia Acapantzingo, Cuernavaca with her husband and Luis Reyna and their three children from 1971 until his murder on 17 February 1999.

Cuernavaca has attracted Hollywood production with parts of the 1969 film &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot; being shot in Tlayacapan north of the city, and parts of the classic 1979 comedy &quot;The In-Laws&quot;, starring Alan Arkin and Peter Falk, being filmed there. In 1984, John Huston shot &quot;Under the Volcano&quot; from Malcolm Lowry&#x27;s novel, with Albert Finney and Jacqueline Bisset in Colonia Acapantzingo, Cuernavaca and in Yautepec de Zaragoza.

== Geography ==

=== Climate ===
Cuernavaca has a tropical savanna climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Aw&quot;) bordering on a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cwa&quot;), with temperatures that are moderated by its altitude. The warmest month is May with an average temperature of and the coolest month is January with an average of . The municipality has two distinct climates.

In the south, is a tropical climate that is warmer with the same moisture pattern. The southern area is primarily grassland with some rainforest. Average annual temperature is with the warmest months being April and May and the coolest being January and December. Temperatures only occasionally exceed or fall below .

==Economy==
Most of the economic activity in the municipality is retail trade, concentrated in and around the city of Cuernavaca. Agriculture and fish farming employ the fewest people, although the municipality contains a good quantity of resources for these enterprises. The far north of the municipality generally is not suited to agriculture, due to the terrain and types of volcanic soil found there. Most agriculture is concentrated in the southeast. The lower elevations, at around , is best-suited for fishing and fish-farming. The middle range, between , has uses mixed between agriculture and forest products, and the elevations higher than are primarily forest. Fish farming areas are under pressure from urban development, especially in the Ahuatepec region east of the city, where irregular and sometimes illegal, housing developments are appearing among the farms.

On the outskirts of Cuernavaca, there are a handful of plant nurseries, specializing in the planting, growing and distribution, including international shipments, of plants, flowers and seeds. Many famous gardens around the world are supplied with flowers from the Cuernavaca region.

Industry is minimal and mostly limited to micro-industries such as printing, framing, ceramics, garment-making, and the production of cleaning supplies. This employs about 28% of the population. Most of the population (67%) is employed in the retail and service industries, both dependent on tourism.

Crafts from this area primarily consist of ceramics and wax products. The wax used is from bees and generally it is shaped into capricious figures. Flowerpots and clay objects from San Antón, handcrafted paper from wood chips with multicolored paintings, and wood lacquered masks are other products of the municipality.

<text>Robert Edward Machado (born October 16, 1973) is an Australian born American professional surfer. Rob competed on the World Surf League Championship Tour from 1993-2001. Since then he has become a professional free surfer.

== Early life ==
Machado attended San Dieguito High School. He describes himself in interviews, vlogs and social media as a &quot;soul surfer,&quot; or freesurfer. He was largely active in the competitive surfing scene from 1993 to 2000, and was still competing in World Surf League events until 2012.

== Career==
Machado hosts and participates in an annual event held at his home reef called the Rob Machado Surf Classic and Beach Fair, which is an amateur competition for the locals of all ages, and it includes demo sessions with Machado and other pros.

Machado portrayed &quot;himself&quot; in the 2007 animated picture, &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up, as well as playing himself in the art film &quot;Kingshighway - Rob Machado and Joel Tudor&quot; by Paulo Carvalho (Kid Rio) and Danny Camp.&quot; Machado also starred in his own feature film released in the late 90s titled &quot;Drifting&quot;. Additionally, Rob wrote and starred in the 2009 film, &quot;The Drifter&quot;.

Machado is a 2011 inductee into the Surfing Walk of Fame in Huntington Beach, California in the surf champion category.

On December 31, 2019, Machado announced he would no longer be associated with Hurley International after having been sponsored by the surf company for nearly 20 years, due to the new ownership group&#x27;s desire to cut spending. He is now sponsored by Vuori, Reef, Dragon and Firewire. He regularly surfs in San Diego, where he has gained prominence.

== Environmental activism ==
Machado formed the Rob Machado Foundation, an organization focused on environmental causes.

== Career highlights ==
Machado has won the Hawaii&#x27;s Pipeline Masters (Triple Crown of Surfing), and the U.S. Open of Surfing, the largest surfing event held on the U.S. mainland.

<doc id="309674" wikidata="Q208450" url="?curid=309674" title="Panic">
<text>Panic is a sudden sensation of fear, which is so strong as to dominate or prevent reason and logical thinking, replacing it with overwhelming feelings of anxiety, uncertainty and frantic agitation consistent with a fight-or-flight reaction. Panic may occur singularly in individuals or manifest suddenly in large groups as mass panic (closely related to herd behavior).

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;panic&quot; derives from antiquity and is a tribute to the ancient god Pan. One of the many gods in the mythology of ancient Greece, Pan was the god of shepherds and of woods and pastures. The Greeks believed that he often wandered peacefully through the woods, playing a pipe, but when accidentally awakened from his noontime nap he could give a great shout that would cause flocks to stampede. From this aspect of Pan&#x27;s nature Greek authors derived the word &quot;panikos&quot;, &quot;sudden fear&quot;, the ultimate source of the English word: &quot;panic&quot;. The Greek term indicates the feeling of total fear that is also sudden and often attributed to the presence of a god.

== Psychology ==
The fight-or-flight response (among other names) is a physiological reaction that occurs in response to a perceived harmful event, attack, or threat to survival. Animals react to threats with a general discharge of the sympathetic nervous system, preparing the animal for fighting or fleeing. The adrenal medulla produces a hormonal cascade that results in the secretion of catecholamines, especially norepinephrine and epinephrine. The hormones estrogen, testosterone, and cortisol, as well as the neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin, also affect how organisms react to stress. The hormone osteocalcin might also play a part.

General adaptation syndrome regulates stress responses among vertebrates and other organisms involves the fight-or-flight response as it first stage.

A panic attack is a sudden period of intense fear and discomfort that may include palpitations, sweating, chest pain, shaking, shortness of breath, numbness, or a feeling of impending doom or of losing control. Typically, symptoms reach a peak within ten minutes of onset, and last for roughly 30 minutes, but the duration can vary from seconds to hours. Though distressing, panic attacks themselves are not physically dangerous. They can either be triggered or occur unexpectedly.

In psychology, there is an identified condition called panic disorder that has been described as a specific psychological vulnerability of people to interpret normal physical sensations in a catastrophic way. It is related strongly to biological and psychological factors and their interactions. Leonard J. Schmidt and Brooke Warner describe panic as &quot;that terrible, profound emotion that stretches us beyond our ability to imagine any experience more horrible&quot; adding that &quot;physicians like to compare painful clinical conditions on some imagined &#x27;Richter scale&#x27; of vicious, mean hurt … to the psychiatrist there is no more vicious, mean hurt than an exploding and personally disintegrating panic attack.&quot;
Panic attacks can occur due to several other disorders including social anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, substance use disorder, depression, and medical problems.

Panic in social psychology is considered infectious since it can spread to a multitude of people and those affected are expected to act irrationally as a consequence. Psychologists identify different types of this panic event with slightly varying descriptions, which include mass panic, mass hysteria, mass psychosis, and social contagion.

An influential theoretical treatment of panic is found in Neil J. Smelser&#x27;s &quot;Theory of Collective Behavior&quot;. The science of panic management has found important practical applications in the armed forces and emergency services of the world.

== Effects ==
Prehistoric humans used mass panic as a technique when hunting animals, especially ruminants. Herds reacting to unusually strong sounds or unfamiliar visual effects were directed towards cliffs, where they eventually jumped to their deaths when cornered.

Humans are also vulnerable to panic and it is often considered infectious, in the sense one person&#x27;s panic may easily spread to other people nearby and soon the entire group acts irrationally, but people also have the ability to prevent and/or control their own and others&#x27; panic by disciplined thinking or training (such as disaster drills).

Architects and city planners try to accommodate for behaviors related to panic, such as herd behavior, during design and planning, often using simulations to determine the best way to lead people to a safe exit and prevent congestion or crowd crushes. The most effective methods are often non-intuitive. A tall column or columns, placed in front of the door exit at a precisely calculated distance, may speed up the evacuation of a large room, as the obstacle divides the congestion well ahead of the choke point.

Many highly publicized cases of deadly panic occurred during massive public events. The layout of Mecca was extensively redesigned by Saudi authorities in an attempt to eliminate frequent crushes, which kill an average of 250 pilgrims every year. Football stadiums have seen deadly crowd rushes and stampedes, such as at Heysel stadium in Belgium in 1985 with more than 600 casualties, including 39 deaths, at Hillsborough stadium in Sheffield, England, in 1989 when 96 people were killed in a crush, and at Kanjuruhan Stadium in Indonesia, in 2022 when 135 people were killed in a crush.

<doc id="309676" wikidata="Q7099178" url="?curid=309676" title="Or Commission">
<text>The Or Commission (), fully the Commission of Inquiry into the Clashes Between Security Forces and Israeli Citizens in October 2000 (), was a panel of inquiry appointed by the Israeli government to investigate the events of October 2000 at the beginning of the Second Intifada in which 12 Arab citizens of Israel and one Palestinian were killed by Israeli police amid several demonstrations. One Israeli Jew was killed by a stone dropped from a bridge onto her vehicle near one such demonstration; however, it is not clear that the incident was linked. The commission released its findings on &quot;the clashes between security forces and Israeli civilians&quot; on September 2, 2003. The chief investigator was Theodor Or, an Israeli Supreme Court Justice.

==Main conclusions of the Or Commission==

===Police responsibility===
The governmental body of inquiry criticised the Israeli police for being unprepared for the riots and using excessive force to disperse the protesting and rioting citizens. Eight policemen were reprimanded by the commission, most of them after they had retired from the police force. Two police officers were released from the force due to the conclusions.

===Official responsibility===
As the commission&#x27;s mandate was one of inquiry, no action was taken against most of those warned by it, but rather recommendations were made. Most Jewish politicians were determined to be largely not responsible, with the exception being the Internal Security Ministry, Prof. Shlomo Ben-Ami. The commission recommended that he be removed from his post, and he would later become foreign minister. Also, three Arab figures (two Arab members of the Knesset and the head of the northern branch of the Islamic movement in Israel) were found to be partially responsible by incitement that preceded the riots.

===Background to the demonstrations===
The Or Commission found that Arab citizens suffer discrimination in Israel and leveled criticism at the government for failing to give fair and equal attention to the needs of Arab citizens of Israel. The commission found that frustration with discrimination led to the outpourings of frustration in October 2000.

==Reception==

The commission&#x27;s report was highly controversial on all sides, both gravely disappointing the families of the victims and angering those who blamed Arab citizens for the unrest of October 2000.

Arab advocacy organizations such as Adalah, the Arab Association for Human Rights, and Mossawa argued that the report exonerated Jewish Israeli political figures who played a central role in mishandling the crisis around October 2000, and gave slap-on-the-wrist treatment to those who fired the shots, while severely censuring Arab political figures for incendiary speech. Some commentators believed this amounted to virtual circumvention of due process for Arab citizens.

At the same time, the Or Commission&#x27;s statements were perhaps the first public official acknowledgment of discrimination faced by the Arab citizenry of Israel; Adalah and Mossawa commended the Or Commission for this admission. One year after the release of the commission report, Theodore Or publicly attacked the government for failing to implement its recommendations.

James Taranto of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; commented &quot;That the Israeli government criticizes its own treatment of Arabs is a testament to its democracy.&quot;

<doc id="309682" wikidata="Q434319" url="?curid=309682" title="Altamont Free Concert">
<text>The Altamont Speedway Free Festival was a counterculture rock concert in the United States, held on Saturday, December 6, 1969, at the Altamont Speedway outside of Tracy, California. Approximately 300,000 attended the concert, with some anticipating that it would be a &quot;Woodstock West&quot;. The Woodstock festival had taken place in Bethel, New York, in mid-August, almost four months earlier.

The event is remembered for its use of Hells Angels as security and its significant violence, including the killing of Meredith Hunter and three accidental deaths: two from a hit-and-run car accident, and one from a drowning incident in an irrigation canal. Scores were injured, numerous cars were stolen (and subsequently abandoned), and there was extensive property damage.

The concert featured performances (in order of appearance) by Santana, Jefferson Airplane, The Flying Burrito Brothers, and Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young (CSNY), with The Rolling Stones taking the stage as the final act. The Grateful Dead were also scheduled to perform after CSNY, but shortly before their scheduled appearance, they chose not to due to the increasing violence at the venue. &quot;That&#x27;s the way things went at Altamont—so badly that the Grateful Dead, the prime organizers and movers of the festival, didn&#x27;t even get to play,&quot; wrote staff at &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine in a detailed narrative on the event, terming it, in an additional follow-up piece, &quot;rock and roll&#x27;s all-time worst day, December 6th, a day when everything went perfectly wrong.&quot;

Filmmakers Albert and David Maysles shot footage of the event and incorporated it into the 1970 documentary film titled &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot;.

==Accounts of the concert==
===Jefferson Airplane&#x27;s point of view===
According to Jefferson Airplane&#x27;s Spencer Dryden, the idea for &quot;a kind of Woodstock West&quot; began when he and bandmate Jorma Kaukonen discussed the staging of a free concert with the Grateful Dead and Rolling Stones in Golden Gate Park. Referring to the Stones, Dryden said, &quot;Next to the Beatles they were the biggest rock and roll band in the world, and we wanted them to experience what we were experiencing in San Francisco.&quot;

As plans were being finalized, Jefferson Airplane were on the road, and by early December they were in Florida, believing the concert plans for Golden Gate Park were proceeding. But by December 4, the plans had broken down, in Paul Kantner&#x27;s account, because the city and police departments were unhelpful; innate conflict between the hippies of Haight-Ashbury and the police was manifested in obstructiveness. Sonoma Raceway was then the venue, but its owners wanted $100,000 in escrow from the Rolling Stones.

At the last moment, Dick Carter offered his Altamont Speedway in eastern Alameda County for the festival. Jefferson Airplane flew out of Miami on December 5. Kantner said the location was taken in a spirit of desperation: &quot;There was no way to control it, no supervision or order.&quot; According to Grace Slick, &quot;The vibes were bad. Something was very peculiar, not particularly bad, just real peculiar. It was that kind of hazy, abrasive and unsure day. I had expected the loving vibes of Woodstock but that wasn&#x27;t coming at me. This was a whole different thing.&quot;

===Rolling Stones/Grateful Dead&#x27;s point of view===
During the Rolling Stones&#x27; 1969 U.S. tour, many (including journalists) felt that the ticket prices were far too high. In answer to this criticism, the Rolling Stones decided to end their tour with a free concert in San Francisco.

The concert was originally scheduled to be held at San Jose State University&#x27;s practice field, as there had recently been a three-day outdoor free festival there with 52 bands and 80,000 attendees. Dirt Cheap Productions was asked to help secure the property again for the Rolling Stones and Grateful Dead to play a free concert. The Stones and the Dead were told the city of San Jose was not in the mood for another large concert and the grounds were out of bounds. Golden Gate Park in San Francisco was next on the list. However, a previously scheduled Chicago Bears–San Francisco 49ers football game at Kezar Stadium, located in Golden Gate Park, made that venue impractical, and permits were never issued for the concert. The venue was then changed to the Sears Point Raceway near Sonoma. However, a dispute with Sears Point&#x27;s owner, Filmways, Inc., arose over a $300,000 up-front cash deposit from the Rolling Stones and film distribution rights, so the festival was moved once again. The Altamont Raceway, just outside of Tracy, was chosen at the suggestion of its owner, local businessman Dick Carter. The concert was to take place on Saturday, December 6; the location was switched on the night of Thursday, December 4. 

In making preparations, Grateful Dead manager Rock Scully and concert organizer Michael Lang helicoptered over the site before making the selection, much as Lang had done when the Woodstock Festival was moved at the last moment from Wallkill to Bethel, New York.

The hasty move resulted in numerous logistical problems, including a lack of facilities such as portable toilets and medical tents. The move also created a problem for the stage design; instead of being on top of a rise, which characterized the geography at Sears Point, at Altamont the stage would now be at the bottom of a slope. The Rolling Stones&#x27; stage manager on the 1969 tour, Chip Monck, explained that &quot;the stage was one metre high – 39 inches for us – and [at Sears Point] it was on the top of a hill, so all the audience pressure was back upon them&quot;. Because of the short notice for the change of location, the stage could not be changed. &quot;We weren&#x27;t working with scaffolding, we were working in an older fashion with parallels. You could probably have put another stage below it...but nobody had one,&quot; Monck said.

Because the stage was so low, members of the Hells Angels motorcycle club, led by Oakland chapter head Ralph &quot;Sonny&quot; Barger, were asked to surround the stage to provide security.

==Security==
By some accounts, the Hells Angels were hired as security by the management of the Rolling Stones, on the recommendation of the Grateful Dead and Jefferson Airplane (who both had previously used the Angels for security at performances without incident), for $500 worth of beer. This story has been denied by some parties who were directly involved. According to the road manager of the Rolling Stones&#x27; 1969 US Tour, Sam Cutler, &quot;the only agreement there ever was ... the Angels would make sure nobody tampered with the generators, but that was the extent of it. But there was no way &#x27;They&#x27;re going to be the police force&#x27; or anything like that. That&#x27;s all bollocks.&quot; The deal was made at a meeting including Cutler, Grateful Dead manager Rock Scully, and Pete Knell, a member of the Hells Angels&#x27; San Francisco chapter. According to Cutler, the arrangement was that all the bands were supposed to share the $500 beer cost, &quot;[but] the person who paid it was me, and I never got it back, to this day.&quot;

Hells Angels member Bill &quot;Sweet William&quot; Fritsch recalled this exchange he had with Cutler at a meeting prior to the concert, in which Cutler had asked them to provide security:

We don&#x27;t police things. We&#x27;re not a security force. We go to concerts to enjoy ourselves and have fun.

Well, what about helping people out—you know, giving directions and things?

Sure, we can do that.

When Cutler asked how they would like to be paid, William replied, &quot;We like beer.&quot; In the documentary &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot;, Sonny Barger states that the Hells Angels were not interested in policing the event, and that organizers had told him that the Angels would be required to do little more than sit on the edge of the stage, drink beer, and make sure there were not any murders or rapes occurring.

In 2009, Cutler explained his decision to use the Angels. 
I was talking with them, because I was interested in the security of my band—everyone&#x27;s security, for that matter. In the country of the blind, the one-eyed man is king. They were the only people who were strong and together. [They had to protect the stage] because it was descending into absolute chaos. Who was going to stop it? 
Grateful Dead manager Rock Scully said that if the Angels hadn&#x27;t been on the stage, that whole crowd could have easily passed out, and rolled down onto the stage. There was no barrier.

Stefan Ponek, who helped organize the event, hosted a December 7, 1969, KSAN-FM radio broadcast of a four-hour, &quot;day after&quot; post-concert telephone call-in forum, provided the following for the 2000 release (the four-hour recording is included) of the &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot; DVD: 
What we learned in the broadcast was pretty much startling: These guys—the Angels—had been hired and paid with $500 of beer, on a truck with ice, to essentially bring in the Stones and keep people off the stage. That was the understanding, that was the deal. And it seemed like there was not a lot of disagreement over that; that seemed to emerge as a fact, because it became rather apparent that the Stones didn&#x27;t know what kind of people they were dealing with.

The &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot; DVD contains extensive excerpts from that broadcast. A Hells Angels member who identified himself as &quot;Pete, from Hells Angels San Francisco&quot; (most likely Pete Knell, president of the San Francisco chapter), says &quot;they offered us $500 worth of beer [to] go there and take care of the stage ... we took this $500 worth of beer to do it.&quot; Sonny Barger, who also called into the KSAN forum, states: &quot;We were told by one of the [other Hells Angels] clubs if we showed up down there [and] sat on the stage and drink some beer ... that the Stones manager or somebody had bought for us.&quot; In his lengthy call, Barger mentions the beer deal yet again: 
I ain&#x27;t no cop, I ain&#x27;t never going to ever pretend to be a cop. And you know what, I didn&#x27;t go there to police nothing, man. They told me if I could sit on the edge of the stage so nobody would climb over me, you know, I could drink beer until the show was over. And that&#x27;s what I went there to do.

A woman who called in to the program revealed that she had seen at least five fist fights from her vantage point near the stage and that the Angels were involved in all of them. She also described a general uncaring attitude toward people who clearly needed help; a girl who was dragged across the stage by her hair, another who was on a bad acid trip and bystanders kicked and walked on her. She said she felt having the Angels as &quot;security&quot; was an irresponsible move because &quot;we were all in terror of them&quot;. When she tried to speak about this at the concert, she was warned to be quiet by the people around her, for fear of being beaten. At this point, KSAN&#x27;s Scoop Nisker mentioned the bystander effect and the murder of Kitty Genovese.

Emmett Grogan (founder of the radical community-action group the Diggers), who was intimately involved in the organization of the event (especially at the two earlier-planned venues), confirmed the $500 beer arrangement on that same KSAN forum with Ponek.

&quot;Pete&quot; also tells host Ponek that the Angels were hired by Cutler because of some rowdy, anxious on-stage incidents during the Stones&#x27; Oakland and Miami concerts weeks earlier. As security guards, Pete said &quot;we ain&#x27;t into that security&quot;, but that they agreed after the beer offer. He also claimed that, other than being told to &quot;just keep people off the stage,&quot; Cutler gave the Hells Angels very little specific instructions for stage security: &quot;They didn&#x27;t say nothing to us about any of that.&quot; And although the Angels are not security guards, &quot;If we say we&#x27;re going to do something, we do it. If we decide to do it, it&#x27;s done. No matter what, how far we have to go to do it.&quot; The similar lack of detailed security instructions by the concert&#x27;s management was also mentioned by Barger during his telephone call-in.

Altamont Speedway owner Dick Carter had hired hundreds of professional, plainclothes security guards, ostensibly more for the purpose of protecting his property rather than for the safety and well-being of the concertgoers. Barger mentions these guards, as identified by their wearing of &quot;little white buttons&quot; on &quot;civilian clothes&quot;.

Political scientist and cultural critic James Miller believes that since Ken Kesey had invited the Hells Angels to one of his outdoor Acid Tests, the hippies had viewed the bikers unrealistically, idealizing them as &quot;noble savages&quot; and thus &quot;outlaw brothers of the counterculture&quot;. Miller also maintains that the Rolling Stones may have been misled by their experience with a British contingent of self-described &quot;Hells Angels&quot;, a non-outlaw group of admirers of American biker gear who had provided nonviolent security at a free Stones concert earlier that year in Hyde Park, London. Cutler, however, denies ever having had any illusions about the true nature of Californian Hells Angels. &quot;That&#x27;s another canard foisted on the world by the press&quot;, he said, but Rock Scully remembers explaining to the Stones what the &quot;real&quot; Angels were like after watching the Hyde Park concert.

==Situation deteriorates==
The first act on the stage, Santana, gave a performance that generally went smoothly; however, over the course of the day, the mood of both the crowd and the Angels became progressively agitated and violent. The Angels had been drinking their free beer all day in front of the stage, and most were very drunk. The crowd had also become antagonistic and unpredictable, attacking each other, the Angels, and the performers. A Mick Jagger biographer, Anthony Scaduto, in &quot;Mick Jagger: Everybody&#x27;s Lucifer&quot;, wrote that the only time the crowd seemed to calm down to any degree was during a set by the country-rocking Flying Burrito Brothers. However, Denise Jewkes, lead singer of the local San Francisco rock band The Ace of Cups, six months pregnant, was hit in the head by an empty beer bottle thrown from the crowd and suffered a skull fracture. The Angels proceeded to arm themselves with sawed-off pool cues and motorcycle chains to drive the crowd further back from the stage.

After the crowd (perhaps accidentally) toppled one of the Angels&#x27; motorcycles, the Angels became even more aggressive, including toward the performers. Marty Balin of Jefferson Airplane jumped off the stage to try to sort out the problem, only to be punched in the head and knocked unconscious by an Angel during the band&#x27;s set. When Jefferson Airplane guitarist Paul Kantner sarcastically thanked the Angels for knocking the singer out, Angel Bill Fritsch took hold of a microphone and argued with him about it. The Grateful Dead had been scheduled to play between Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young, and the Rolling Stones, but after hearing about the Balin incident from Santana drummer Michael Shrieve, they refused to play and left the venue, citing the quickly degenerating security situation.

During Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young&#x27;s set, Stephen Stills was reported to be repeatedly stabbed in the leg by a &quot;stoned-out&quot; Hells Angel, with a sharpened bicycle spoke.

By the time the Rolling Stones took the stage in the early evening, the mood had taken a decidedly ugly turn as numerous fights had erupted between Angels and crowd members and within the crowd itself. 

The Rolling Stones waited until sundown to perform. Stanley Booth stated that part of the reason for the delay was that Bill Wyman had missed the helicopter ride to the venue. When the Stones began their set, a tightly packed group of between 4,000 and 5,000 people were jammed to the very edge of the stage, and many attempted to climb onto it.

== Killing of Meredith Hunter ==

Rolling Stones lead singer Mick Jagger, who had already been punched in the head by a concertgoer within seconds of emerging from his helicopter, was visibly intimidated by the unruly situation and urged everyone to, &quot;Just be cool down in the front there, don&#x27;t push around.&quot; During the third song, &quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot;, a fight erupted in the front of the crowd at the foot of the stage, prompting the Stones to pause their set while the Angels restored order. After a lengthy pause and another appeal for calm, the band restarted the song and continued their set with less incident until the start of &quot;Under My Thumb&quot;. At this point, some of the Hells Angels got into a scuffle with Meredith Hunter, age 18, when he attempted to get onstage with other fans. One of the Hells Angels grabbed Hunter&#x27;s head, punched him, and chased him back into the crowd. After a minute&#x27;s pause, Hunter returned to the stage where, according to &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot; producer Porter Bibb, Hunter&#x27;s girlfriend Patty Bredehoft found him and tearfully begged him to calm down and move further back in the crowd with her, but he was reportedly enraged, irrational and &quot;so high he could barely walk&quot;. Rock Scully, who could see the audience clearly from the top of a truck by the stage, said of Hunter, &quot;I saw what he was looking at, that he was crazy, he was on drugs, and that he had murderous intent. There was no doubt in my mind that he intended to do terrible harm to Mick or somebody in the Rolling Stones, or somebody on that stage.&quot;

Following his initial scuffle with the Angels as he tried to climb onstage, Hunter, as seen in concert footage wearing a bright lime-green suit, returned to the front of the crowd and drew a long-barreled .22 caliber revolver from inside his jacket. Hells Angel Alan Passaro, seeing Hunter drawing the revolver, drew a knife from his belt and charged Hunter from the side, parrying Hunter&#x27;s pistol with his left hand and stabbing him twice with his right hand, killing him.

Footage shot by Eric Saarinen, who was on stage taking pictures of the crowd, and Baird Bryant, who climbed atop a bus, appears in the &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot; documentary. Saarinen was unaware of having caught the killing on film. This was discovered more than a week later when raw footage was screened in the New York offices of the Maysles Brothers. In the film sequence, lasting about two seconds, a two-meter (six-foot) opening in the crowd appears, leaving Bredehoft in the center. Hunter enters the opening from the left. His hand rises toward the stage, and the silhouette of a revolver is clearly seen against Bredehoft&#x27;s light-colored vest. Passaro is seen entering from the right and delivering two stabs with his knife as he parries Hunter&#x27;s revolver and pushes him off-screen; the opening then closes around Bredehoft. Passaro was reported to have stabbed Hunter five times in the upper back, although only two stabs are visible in the footage. Witnesses also reported Hunter was stomped on by several Hells Angels while he was on the ground. The gun was recovered and turned over to police. Hunter&#x27;s autopsy confirmed he was high on methamphetamine when he died. Passaro was arrested and tried for murder in the summer of 1971, but was acquitted after a jury viewed concert footage showing Hunter brandishing the revolver and concluded that Passaro had acted in self-defense.

The Rolling Stones were aware of the skirmish, but not the stabbing (&quot;You couldn&#x27;t see anything, it was just another scuffle&quot;, Jagger tells David Maysles during film editing). But it soon became apparent they could see something of what had happened because the band stopped playing mid-song and Jagger was heard calling into his microphone, &quot;We&#x27;ve really got someone hurt here... is there a doctor?&quot; After a few minutes the band began playing again and eventually completed their set. Jagger told Maysles they all agreed that if they abandoned the show at that point, the crowd would have become even more unruly, perhaps degenerating into a full-scale riot.

In 2003, the Alameda County Sheriff&#x27;s Office initiated a two-year investigation into the possibility of a second Hells Angel having taken part in the stabbing. Finding insufficient support for this hypothesis, and reaffirming that Passaro acted alone, the office closed the case for good on May 25, 2005.

The Altamont concert is often contrasted with the Woodstock Festival that took place fewer than four months earlier. While Woodstock represented &quot;peace and love&quot;, Altamont came to be viewed as the end of the hippie era and the &quot;de facto&quot; conclusion of late-1960s American youth culture: &quot;Altamont became, whether fairly or not, a symbol for the death of the Woodstock Nation.&quot; Rock music critic Robert Christgau wrote in 1972 that &quot;Writers focus on Altamont not because it brought on the end of an era but because it provided such a complex metaphor for the way an era ended.&quot; Writing for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in 2015, Richard Brody argued that what Altamont ended was &quot;the idea that, left to their own inclinations and stripped of the trappings of the wider social order, the young people of the new generation will somehow spontaneously create a higher, gentler, more loving grassroots order. What died at Altamont is the Rousseauian dream itself.&quot; More contemporary perspectives challenge that, since the Manson Family murders, also ascribed to counter-cultural hippies, occurred even before Woodstock.

The music magazine &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, in a 14-page, 11-author article on the event entitled &quot;The Rolling Stones Disaster at Altamont: Let It Bleed&quot; published in their January 21, 1970, issue, stated that &quot;Altamont was the product of diabolical egotism, hype, ineptitude, money manipulation, and, at base, a fundamental lack of concern for humanity&quot;. The article covered the many issues with the event&#x27;s organization and was very critical of the organizers and the Rolling Stones; one writer stated: &quot;what an enormous thrill it would have been for an Angel to kick Mick Jagger&#x27;s teeth down his throat.&quot; Another follow-up piece in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called the Altamont event &quot;rock and roll&#x27;s all-time worst day&quot;. In &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine, Ralph J. Gleason observed, &quot;The day The Rolling Stones played there, the name &quot;[Altamont]&quot; became etched in the minds of millions of people who love pop music and who hate it as well. If the name &#x27;Woodstock&#x27; has come to denote the flowering of one phase of the youth culture, &#x27;Altamont&#x27; has come to mean the end of it.&quot;

The film &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot; was criticized by Pauline Kael, Vincent Canby and other reviewers for portraying the Stones too sympathetically, and for staging a concert for the sole reason that it could be filmed, despite all the problems leading up to it. &quot;Salon&quot;&#x27;s Michael Sragow, writing in 2000, said many of the critics took their cues from the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; review, which heavily blamed the filmmakers for being part of a &quot;staged event&quot; so that the Rolling Stones could profit from making a &quot;concert&quot; film. Sragow pointed out numerous errors in the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; coverage and added that the Maysles did not make &quot;major motion pictures&quot; in the traditional way; instead, a variety of factors contributed to the tragedy.

The Rolling Stones&#x27; Keith Richards was relatively sanguine about the show, calling it &quot;basically well-handled, but lots of people were tired and a few tempers got frayed&quot; and &quot;on the whole, a good concert.&quot;

The Grateful Dead wrote several songs about, or in response to, what lyricist Robert Hunter called &quot;the Altamont affair&quot;, including &quot;New Speedway Boogie&quot; (featuring the line &quot;One way or another, this darkness got to give&quot;) and &quot;Mason&#x27;s Children&quot;. Both songs were written and recorded during sessions for the early 1970 album &quot;Workingman&#x27;s Dead,&quot; but &quot;Mason&#x27;s Children&quot; was not included on the album.

Altamont also inspired the Blue Öyster Cult song &quot;Transmaniacon MC&quot; (&quot;MC&quot; means &quot;motorcycle club&quot;), the opening track of their first album.

The incident is mentioned in the film &quot;The Cable Guy&quot; (1996), in a scene where Jim Carrey&#x27;s character, Chip Douglas, performs &quot;Somebody to Love&quot; on karaoke: &quot;You might recognize this song as performed by Jefferson Airplane, in a little rockumentary called &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot;, about the Rolling Stones and their nightmare at Altamont. That night the Oakland chapter of the Hell&#x27;s Angels had their way. Tonight, it&#x27;s my turn.&quot;

In 2004, Australian electronic psych group Black Cab released their debut LP &quot;Altamont Diary&quot;, a concept album based on the concert and its cultural fallout. The LP features a cover of &quot;New Speedway Boogie&quot;.

Altamont is also referenced by Don McLean in the song &quot;American Pie&quot; in the song&#x27;s fifth verse, the majority of which contains symbols related to Altamont: &quot;Jack Flash&quot;, a reference to San Francisco (&quot;Candlestick&quot;, though that venue had nothing to do with the actual concert), (Sympathy for) &quot;the Devil&quot;, an enraged spectator watching something on a stage, and an &quot;angel born in Hell&quot;. McLean officially refused to confirm or deny the song&#x27;s ties to Altamont until he sold his songwriting notes in 2015. Within the context of the song, Altamont served as the culmination of a period that had begun with the plane crash that killed Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and the Big Bopper in February 1959, during which &quot;things (were) heading in the wrong direction&quot; and life was &quot;becoming less idyllic.&quot;

In 2008, a former FBI agent asserted that some members of the Hells Angels had conspired to murder Mick Jagger in retribution for the Rolling Stones&#x27; lack of support following the concert, and for the negative portrayal of the Angels in the &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot; film. The conspirators reportedly used a boat to approach a residence where Jagger was staying on Long Island, New York, the plot failing when the boat was nearly sunk by a storm. Jagger&#x27;s spokesperson has refused to comment on the matter.
In January 2022, the Library of Congress shared a 30-minute clip of soundless footage shot from the stage at Altamont. The Library obtained the footage from the Prelinger Archives.

<text>The Firesign Theatre (also known as the Firesigns) was an American surreal comedy troupe who first appeared on November 17, 1966, in a live performance on the Los Angeles radio program &quot;Radio Free Oz&quot; on station KPFK FM. They continued appearing on &quot;Radio Free Oz&quot;, which later moved to KRLA 1110 AM and then KMET FM, through February 1969. They produced fifteen record albums and a 45 rpm single under contract to
Columbia Records from 1967 through 1976, and had three nationally syndicated radio programs: &quot;The Firesign Theatre Radio Hour Hour&quot; [sic] in 1970 on KPPC-FM; and &quot;Dear Friends&quot; (1970–1971) and &quot;Let&#x27;s Eat!&quot; (1971–1972) on KPFK. They also appeared in front of live audiences, and continued to write, perform, and record on other labels, occasionally taking sabbaticals during which they wrote or performed solo or in smaller groups.

The Firesign Theatre was the brainchild of Peter Bergman, and all of its material was conceived, written, and performed by its members: Bergman, Philip Proctor, Phil Austin, and David Ossman. The group&#x27;s name stems from astrology, because all four were born under the three &quot;fire signs&quot;: Aries (Austin), Leo (Proctor), and Sagittarius (Bergman and Ossman). Their popularity peaked in the early 1970s and ebbed in the Reagan era. They experienced a revival and second wave of popularity in the 1990s and continued to write, record and perform until Bergman&#x27;s death in 2012.

In 1997, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked the Firesign Theatre among the &quot;Thirty Greatest Comedy Acts of All Time&quot;. Their 1970 album &quot;Don&#x27;t Crush That Dwarf, Hand Me the Pliers&quot; was nominated in 1971 for the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation by the World Science Fiction Society, and their next album &quot;I Think We&#x27;re All Bozos on This Bus&quot; received the same nomination in 1972. Later, they received nominations for the Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album for three of their albums: &quot;The Three Faces of Al&quot; (1984), &quot;Give Me Immortality or Give Me Death&quot; (1998), and &quot;Bride of Firesign&quot; (2001). In 2005, the US Library of Congress added &quot;Don&#x27;t Crush That Dwarf&quot; to the National Recording Registry and called the group &quot;the Beatles of comedy.&quot;

==Before &quot;Firesign&quot;==
Peter Bergman and Philip Proctor met while attending Yale University in the late 1950s, where Proctor studied acting and Bergman edited the Yale comedy magazine. Bergman studied playwriting and collaborated as lyricist with Austin Pendleton in 1958 on two Yale Dramat musicals in which Proctor starred: &quot;Tom Jones&quot;, and &quot;Booth Is Back In Town&quot;.

In 1965, Bergman spent a year working in England on the BBC television program &quot;Not So Much a Programme, More a Way of Life&quot; and went to see surrealist comedian Spike Milligan in a play. Bergman went backstage and struck up a friendship with Milligan. Also that year, he saw the Beatles in concert, which gave him the inspiration to form a four-man comedy group.

On returning to the US, Bergman started a late-night listener-participation talk show, &quot;Radio Free Oz&quot;, on July 24, 1966, on listener-sponsored KPFK FM in Los Angeles, working with producers Phil Austin and David Ossman. According to Austin, the show &quot;featured everybody who was anybody in the artistic world who passed through LA.&quot; Guests included the band Buffalo Springfield and Andy Warhol. In November, Proctor was in Los Angeles looking for acting work and watching the Sunset Strip curfew riots. When he discovered he was sitting on a newspaper photo of Bergman, he called his college buddy, who recruited him as the fourth man for his comedy group.

Bergman originally named the group the &quot;Oz Firesign Theatre&quot; because all four were born under the three astrological fire signs (Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius), and the group debuted on his November 17, 1966 show. Bergman had to drop &quot;Oz&quot; from the name after legal threats from Disney and MGM, who owned movie rights to &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; and other associated works.

==&quot;Radio Free Oz&quot;==

The Firesigns initially chose an improvisational style and carried it to a level which revolutionized radio comedy. According to Proctor:
On nights when he had no guests, Bergman would have the Firesigns come on the air and pretend (including himself) to be outrageously interesting guests. On their November 17, 1966 debut, they pretended to be the panel of an imaginary &quot;Oz Film Festival&quot;: Bergman was film critic Peter Volta, &quot;writing a history of world cinema one frame at a time&quot;; Ossman was Raul Saez, maker of “thrown camera” films, who had just won a grant to roll a 70 mm film camera down the Andes mountains; Austin was Jack Love, making &quot;Living Room Theatre&quot; porn films like &quot;The Nun&quot; and &quot;Blondie Pays the Rent&quot;; and Proctor was Jean-Claude Jean-Claude, creator of the &quot;Nouvelle Nouvelle Vague Vague movement&quot; and director of a documentary &quot;Two Weeks With Fred&quot;, which lasts a full two weeks.

By 1967, Bergman had the Firesign Theatre appear regularly on &quot;Radio Free Oz&quot;. The Firesigns were strongly influenced by the British &quot;Goon Show&quot;; Proctor, Austin, and Ossman were big fans since the NBC program &quot;Monitor&quot; broadcast &quot;Goon Show&quot; episodes in the late 1950s, and Bergman became a fan after forming the Firesigns. According to Ossman:
In the fall of 1967, the Firesign Theatre was broadcasting Sunday nights from &quot;The Magic Mushroom&quot;, in Studio City, formerly a Bob Eubanks&#x27; &quot;Cinnamon Cinder&quot;. In September 1967, they performed an adaptation of Jorge Luis Borges&#x27; short story &quot;La Muerte y La Brujula&quot; (&quot;Death and the Compass&quot;) on Radio Free Oz.

In 1969, they created improvised television commercials for Jack Poet Volkswagen in Highland Park, California, with the characters of Christian Cyborg (Bergman), Coco Lewis (Proctor), Bob Chicken (Austin), and Tony Gomez (Ossman).

==Golden age==
===Early recording career===
Bergman coined the term &quot;love-in&quot; in 1967, and he promoted the first Los Angeles Love-In, attended by 40,000 in Elysian Park, on his program. The Firesigns performed there, which led to &quot;Radio Free Oz&quot; moving to KRLA 1110 AM, which had a much wider audience than KPFK FM. This event also caught the attention of Columbia Records staff producer Gary Usher, who sensed commercial potential for the Firesign Theatre and proposed to Bergman they make a &quot;love-In album&quot; for Columbia. Bergman countered with a proposal for a Firesign Theatre album, and this led to a five-year recording contract with the label. Usher also used the Firesigns&#x27; audio collages on songs by The Byrds (&quot;Draft Morning&quot;) and Sagittarius (the 45 RPM version of &quot;Hotel Indiscreet&quot;) in 1967 and 1968.

The album was given the non sequitur title &quot;Waiting for the Electrician or Someone Like Him&quot;, from Bergman&#x27;s undeveloped 1965 idea for a comic film. The Firesigns changed their improvisational style, producing tightly scripted and memorized material. According to Bergman: &quot;There was no leader.&quot; The Firesigns always billed themselves alphabetically on their album jackets and other printed materials. &quot;Everything was communally written, and if one person didn&#x27;t agree about something, no matter how strongly the other three felt about it, it didn&#x27;t go in.&quot; 
The resulting synergy created the feeling of a fifth Firesign; according to Austin: &quot;It&#x27;s like, suddenly there is this fifth guy that actually does the writing. We all vaguely sort of know him, and a lot of the time take credit for him.&quot; This resulted in the group inventing the name &quot;4 or 5 Krazy Guys Publishing&quot; to copyright their work. Their contract with Columbia, in exchange for a low royalty rate, gave them unlimited studio time, allowing them to perfect their writing and recording.

&quot;Electrician&quot; revolutionized the concept of the comedy album: it consists of four radio plays. Side one is a trilogy of pieces: starting with &quot;Temporarily Humboldt County&quot;, a satire of the Europeans&#x27; displacement of the indigenous peoples of the Americas; followed by &quot;W. C. Fields Forever&quot;, a satire of the 1960s hippie culture; leading into &quot;Trente-Huit Cunegonde (Returned for Regrooving)&quot;, a projected future in which the roles of the hippie counterculture and the Establishment culture are reversed. Side two, the title track, is a stream-of-consciousness play about an American tourist (Austin) to an Eastern Bloc country, who ends up in prison and is rescued by the CIA. It was recorded in CBS&#x27;s Los Angeles radio studio from which &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot; and others had been broadcast; the original RCA microphones and sound effects devices were used. It was released in January 1968, selling a modest 12,000 copies in its first year.

The Firesigns continued to work on the radio and began performing in folk clubs such as the Ash Grove. &quot;Radio Free Oz&quot; moved again to KMET FM until February 1969. &quot;The Firesign Theatre Radio Hour Hour&quot; aired for two hours on Sunday nights on KPPC-FM in 1970. They concentrated their writing on the folk-club material and produced improvisational skit material for the &quot;Radio Hour&quot; and its successors.

The Firesigns almost lost their recording contract after their first album. According to Bergman: &quot;Columbia was going to kick us off the label, so we scripted the next record and the old guard at Columbia took a look at the script and said &#x27;This isn&#x27;t funny—this is dirty!&#x27; And to our rescue came James William Guercio [producer of the Buckinghams]
and John Hammond.&quot; Austin says, &quot;With Hammond backing us up, CBS came around.&quot; They went on to produce three more Columbia studio albums from 1969 to 1971. Each grew technically more sophisticated, taking advantage of up to 16 tape tracks and Dolby noise reduction by 1970.

&quot;How Can You Be in Two Places at Once When You&#x27;re Not Anywhere at All&quot;, released in 1969, consists of a stream-of-consciousness play on side one about a man named Babe (Bergman) who buys a car and goes on a road trip that turns into a parody of Norman Corwin&#x27;s 1941 patriotic radio pageant &quot;We Hold These Truths&quot;. Side two, &quot;The Further Adventures of Nick Danger&quot;, is a parody of 1940s radio, about a hard-boiled detective (Austin) who became possibly the Firesigns&#x27; most famous character.

&quot;Don&#x27;t Crush That Dwarf, Hand Me the Pliers&quot; (1970) is a single play centered around an actor named George Tirebiter (Ossman), who gradually ages into an old man while watching his old movies on television: a Henry Aldrich parody &quot;High School Madness&quot; (in which he is named Porgie Tirebiter), and the Korean War film &quot;Parallel Hell&quot;. &quot;Dwarf&quot; marked a high point in the Firesign&#x27;s use of blue comedy: Porgie has explicit sex with a housemaid as creaking bedsprings are heard. This album was nominated for a Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation in 1971 by the World Science Fiction Society,

&quot;Dwarf&quot; brought a level of success to the Firesigns that started to spoil them. Bergman said, &quot;We toured after &quot;Dwarf&quot; and we began to realize the extent we were influencing people. We realized that FM radio was playing our albums whole, and that people were memorizing them.&quot; Austin said of this period, &quot;At that point we began not to get along with each other that well, and the being taken so seriously — &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; did a long article on us, and we were being compared to James Joyce — there was a prideful attitude that took over. But we weren&#x27;t making money; we might as well have been teaching school somewhere and worrying about making tenure for all the money we were making. So in some sense we didn&#x27;t really understand what we were doing, which is why we were never able to make a second &quot;Dwarf&quot;, which to me is a real disappointment.&quot;

Their fourth album, &quot;I Think We&#x27;re All Bozos On This Bus&quot; (1971), also a single play, centers on a young, early-technology computer hacker (Proctor) and an older &quot;bozo&quot; with a large nose that honks like a clown&#x27;s (Austin), who attend a Disneyesque Future Fair. The blue comedy was dialed back from explicit to suggestive, as a scientist invents a machine that mimics sexual intercourse. This album also received a Hugo nomination in 1972.

Meanwhile, from September 9, 1970 to February 17, 1971, they were performing a one-hour weekly live series on KPFK, &quot;Dear Friends&quot;. These programs were recorded and then edited into slightly shorter shows and syndicated to radio stations across the country on 12&quot; LP albums. Their fifth album, &quot;Dear Friends&quot;, was a double-record compilation of what they considered the best segments from the series, released in January 1972. &quot;Dear Friends&quot; was followed with the KPFK show &quot;Let&#x27;s Eat!&quot; in 1971 and 1972. Both titles came from lines uttered by televangelist Pastor Rod Flash (Proctor) on his &quot;Hour of Reckoning&quot; program in &quot;Don&#x27;t Crush That Dwarf&quot;.

In 1970, the group had performed a live stage show, the Shakespeare parody &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot;, at Columbia University. In January 1972 they decided to expand this and retitle it &quot;Anything You Want To&quot; for their next album. On March 9, Columbia signed them to a second five-year contract. On March 30, they ended &quot;Let&#x27;s Eat!&quot; with a live broadcast titled &quot;Martian Space Party&quot;, which was also recorded on 16-track tape and filmed. The Firesigns combined parts of the two shows with some new studio material to produce their sixth album, &quot;Not Insane or Anything You Want To&quot;. But before releasing the album in October 1972, they had discarded their original story line idea and some newly written scenes.

===1973 split===
The &quot;Not Insane&quot; album performed poorly, and the Firesigns later claimed to be disappointed with it. In the liner notes to the group’s 1993 greatest hits album, &quot;Shoes for Industry: The Best of the Firesign Theatre&quot;, Bergman criticized &quot;Not Insane&quot;, saying it &quot;was when the Firesign was splitting apart; it was a fractious, fragmented album.&quot; Ossman called it &quot;a serious mistake&quot; and said it “was incomprehensible, basically,&quot; and &quot;it was not the album it should have been and I think that caused us to slope off rapidly in sales.&quot;

The four decided to take a break from the group in 1973 to work in separate directions. Proctor and Bergman decided to perform as a duo, and made a separate record deal with Columbia, producing &quot;TV or Not TV: A Video Vaudeville in Two Acts&quot;. The record predicts the rise of pay cable TV, and it depicts an amateur station run by two men who must constantly block a group of teenage hijackers. They turned this into a vaudeville-type show which they played on tour. While promoting the show, they did a radio interview with disk jockey Wolfman Jack.

Meanwhile, Ossman wrote a solo album, &quot;How Time Flys&quot;, based on the Mark Time astronaut character he created for a &quot;Dear Friends&quot; skit, used on &quot;I Think We&#x27;re All Bozos&quot; and cut from &quot;Not Insane&quot;. He co-directed the album with Columbia producer Stephen Gillmor, and the other three Firesigns starred on it, along with several guest personalities including Wolfman Jack, Harry Shearer of The Credibility Gap, and broadcast journalist Lew Irwin. Mark returns on New Year&#x27;s Eve, 1999, from a twenty-year round trip to Planet X, only to find the space program has been dismantled, and no one cares about him except for an eccentric impresario (Bergman) who kidnaps him for his video recordings of encounters with alien life.

Austin wrote the solo album &quot;Roller Maidens From Outer Space&quot;, based on a hardboiled detective in the same vein as his Nick Danger character introduced on the B side of &quot;How Can You Be In Two Places...&quot;. &quot;Roller Maidens&quot;, released in March 1974 on Columbia&#x27;s Epic label, also featured all four Firesigns and included actors Richard Paul and Michael C. Gwynne. The album satirizes series television, televangelists, the 1973 oil crisis, and the presidency of Richard Nixon.

===Comedy style===
The Firesigns made use of inside humor. They peppered &quot;Waiting for the Electrician&quot; and &quot;How Can You Be in Two Places At Once&quot; with Beatles references not found in the band&#x27;s top 40 material. Firesign characters quoted lyrics from songs such as &quot;The Word&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m So Tired&quot;, and &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot;. The name of Danger&#x27;s criminal nemesis Rocky Rococo was a parody of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Rocky Raccoon&quot;, and Danger&#x27;s girlfriend has multiple names but &quot;everyone knew her as Nancy&quot; just like Rocky Raccoon&#x27;s girlfriend.

Later the Firesigns created their own inside jokes by referring to their own previously released material. A famous example is when a confused caller tries to order a pizza from Nick Danger; the other side of this phone conversation is portrayed in &quot;Dwarf&quot;, where George Tirebiter is the frustrated, hungry caller trying to get food delivered from &quot;Nick&#x27;s&quot;.

&quot;He&#x27;s no fun, he fell right over&quot; became a famous catchphrase delivered by Austin in &quot;How Can You Be In Two Places at Once&quot; and repeated on side two in &quot;The Further Adventures of Nick Danger&quot;. This line was repeated on the albums &quot;Not Insane&quot; and &quot;How Time Flys&quot;.

===Reunion===
The group reunited in late August 1973 to produce the Sherlock Holmes parody &quot;The Tale of the Giant Rat of Sumatra&quot;, based on one of the plays from their 1967 Magic Mushroom broadcasts, &quot;By the Light of the Silvery&quot;. This was released on vinyl in January 1974. The Firesigns sold this script to science fiction writer Harlan Ellison for Book Three of Ellison&#x27;s anthology &quot;The Last Dangerous Visions&quot;, which Ellison never completed.

In October 1974, the Firesigns released their eighth album, &quot;Everything You Know Is Wrong&quot;, which satirized the developing New Age movement. Ossman said this record &quot;grew out of our basic interest in those parapsychological things ... from Castaneda to the hollow Earth theory to the guy who bends spoons. Originally, when we started writing it, it was going to be a much more complicated and &#x27;cinematic&#x27; record; we were trying to write a radio movie.&quot; The Firesigns produced a film made by Allen Daviau (who later filmed &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot;) using the album as the soundtrack. The film was shown in a live appearance at Stanford University and released on VHS video tape in 1993.

In 1975, they released the black comedy album &quot;In the Next World, You&#x27;re on Your Own&quot;, written by Austin and Ossman. The story centers on Random Coolzip (Proctor), an alcoholic dirty cop whose son (Bergman) is a by-the-book cop, whose daughter (Proctor) is a porn actress, and whose police dispatcher wife (Ossman) lives in a soap opera. In a parody of Marlon Brando&#x27;s 1973 Academy Awards protest, the brother and sister stage a terrorist attack on an Oscar awards ceremony. This album, like &quot;Not Insane&quot;, also sold poorly, and Columbia declined to offer them a third contract in 1976. This time, the Firesigns didn&#x27;t protest. Bergman said, &quot;The group had really split apart; we had just burned out. I mean it was five years non-stop work. We would stop one album and start writing the next. Frankly, we didn&#x27;t have five more albums in us at that point.&quot;

===Second split===
As Austin looked back on this period from September 1993, he wrote that he saw Proctor and Bergman wanting to take the Firesign Theatre in a different direction than he did, moving away from intensely written albums released one per year, to more live performances with lighter material. Proctor and Bergman turned their attention in 1975 to producing a live show recorded on the Columbia album &quot;What This Country Needs&quot;, based in part on material from &quot;TV or Not TV&quot; and named for a song added to the show.

The Firesign Theatre closed out their Columbia Records contract with a greatest-hits compilation &quot;Forward Into the Past&quot; in 1976. This title came from the A side of a 45 RPM single originally released in November 1969. This track and its B side, &quot;Station Break&quot;, were included on the 1976 album. Meanwhile, Austin and Ossman toured the west coast, billing themselves as &quot;Dr. Firesign&#x27;s Theatre of Mystery&quot;. They produced a live stage show &quot;Radio Laffs of 1940&quot;, which included a second episode of the private eye character Nick Danger, &quot;School For Actors&quot;; and a soap opera &quot;Over the Edge&quot;. This was performed at the Los Feliz Theatre in Los Angeles in May 1976 and at the Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco in June. Austin wrote in 1993 that this tour &quot;was meant to be an antidote to confusion but ... had not turned out to be much fun at all&quot;.

The Firesigns took it easy for the rest of the 1970s, producing a 1977 album &quot;Just Folks... A Firesign Chat&quot; based largely on unreleased &quot;Dear Friends&quot; and &quot;Let&#x27;s Eat&quot; radio material. Proctor and Bergman appeared as regulars on a 1977 summer replacement TV series hosted by the Starland Vocal Band. Proctor and Bergman gave up their road performances after witnessing the September 4, 1977 Golden Dragon Massacre, and in 1978 released another studio album &quot;Give Us a Break&quot;, which lampooned radio and television. The Starland Vocal Band also performed short comic radio breaks on this album.

Norman Lear and Bud Yorkin&#x27;s Tandem Productions bought the rights to Nick Danger for a TV series to star George Hamilton; and in 1978, New Line Cinema began negotiations to make a movie starring Chevy Chase. Both projects ended in development hell, and rights to the character reverted to the Firesigns. In December 1978, they began writing five short (2:24) episodes of &quot;Nick Danger: The Case of the Missing Shoe&quot; for a possible syndicated daily radio series. When the syndication went unsold, Austin approached Rhino Records and secured a deal to release the five episodes in 1979 on a 12-minute extended play (EP) record.

Meanwhile, Proctor and Bergman produced a film, &quot;J-Men Forever&quot;, using clips from old Republic Pictures movie serials with dubbed dialogue, combined with new footage of them as FBI agents tracking down a villain known as &quot;the Lightning Bug&quot; voiced by disk jockey M. G. Kelly. This became popular on the 1980s late-night TV series &quot;Night Flight&quot;.

Austin called Bergman in late 1979 to make peace and reunite the Firesigns. This resulted in a series of shows performed at the Roxy Theatre in Los Angeles: &quot;The Owl and the Octopus Show&quot;; &quot;The Joey Demographico Show&quot;; &quot;Nick Danger: Men in Hats&quot;; and &quot;Welcome to Billville&quot;. These included songs with music written by Austin, and were recorded; the live recordings were used to produce their last album of the decade, the 1980 &quot;Fighting Clowns&quot;. They also produced a show, &quot;Presidents in Hell&quot; (FDR, Truman, Eisenhower, and Nixon), which was not recorded.

==Reagan era==

The popularity of the group cooled off after 1980 as the social and political climate of the United States changed with the election of President Ronald Reagan. In 1982, they produced the album &quot;Lawyer&#x27;s Hospital&quot; from a collection of live appearances, National Public Radio (NPR) performances, and the Jack Poet Volkswagen commercials from &quot;Radio Free Oz&quot;. They also expanded their 1972 Shakespeare parody into a road show, &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s Lost Comedie&quot; and released it on a 1982 vinyl LP, which required editing down; it was re-released uncut on CD in 2001, retitled &quot;Anythynge You Want To&quot;.

Ossman left the group in early 1982 to take a producer&#x27;s job for NPR in Washington DC. The remaining three Firesigns produced a new album in 1984, &quot;The Three Faces of Al&quot;, with the further adventures of Nick Danger. This received a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album, and was followed in 1985 with the album &quot;Eat or Be Eaten&quot;, about a character trapped in an interactive video game.

In 1988, Austin was signed by John Dryden to produce over 50 short Nick Danger pieces for his radio satire show &quot;The Daily Feed&quot;. These were published on cassette tape as &quot;The Daily Feed Tapes&quot;, and later formed the basis for a 1995 book authored by Austin, &quot;Tales of the Old Detective and Other Big Fat Lies&quot;.

In the summer of 1990, NPR producer Ted Bonnitt called Proctor and asked him if he wanted to contribute some comedy material to Bonnitt&#x27;s nightly program &quot;HEAT with John Hockenberry&quot;. Proctor called Bergman, and the duo agreed to write and perform a serial consisting of 13 five-minute episodes, &quot;&quot;

==1990s revival==

Following the 1992 United States presidential election, and with Ossman back in the group, the Firesign Theatre reunited in 1993 for a 25th anniversary reunion tour around the US, &quot;Back From the Shadows&quot;, starting on April 24 in Seattle with an audience of 2,900. The title was taken from a parody of the Gene Autry song &quot;Back in the Saddle Again&quot;, which they wrote for &quot;I Think We&#x27;re All Bozos on This Bus&quot;. The tour, consisting of live performances of material adapted from their first four Golden Age albums (&quot;Electrician&quot;, &quot;Two Places At Once&quot;, &quot;Dwarf&quot;, and &quot;Bozos&quot;), was recorded on CD and a DVD video released in 1994. They also released a 1993 greatest hits album, &quot;Shoes for Industry: The Best of the Firesign Theatre&quot; containing original material from the first nine albums, &quot;TV or Not TV&quot;, and &quot;Roller Maidens From Outer Space&quot;.

In 1996, Bergman revived &quot;Radio Free Oz&quot; as an Internet-based radio station, www.rfo.net, calling it &quot;the Internet&#x27;s funny bone.&quot;

The Firesigns followed this with the 1998 album &quot;Pink Hotel Burns Down&quot;, a collection of material from two 1967 Magic Mushroom broadcasts, &quot;Exorcism In Your Daily Life&quot; and their early Sherlock Holmes parody &quot;By the Light of the Silvery&quot;; two cuts, &quot;The Pink Hotel&quot; and &quot;The Sand Bar&quot; from their video game record that eventually became &quot;Eat or Be Eaten&quot;; the soap opera &quot;Over the Edge&quot; from Austin and Ossman&#x27;s 1976 &quot;Dr. Firesign&#x27;s Theatre of Mystery&quot; tour, and several clips from their radio work, including the earliest recorded appearance on &quot;Radio Free Oz&quot;.

The Firesigns satirized the turn-of-the-millennium Y2K scare with the 1998 album &quot;Give Me Immortality or Give Me Death&quot;, in which they revived some of their classic characters such as used car salesman Ralph Spoilsport (Proctor) from &quot;How Can You Be In Two Places At Once&quot;, news reporters Harold Hiphugger (Ossman) and Ray Hamberger (Proctor) from &quot;Everything You Know Is Wrong&quot;, and game-show contestant Caroline Presskey (Proctor) from &quot;Don&#x27;t Crush That Dwarf&quot;. This earned them their second Grammy nomination, and they developed it into a &quot;millennium trilogy&quot; with the 1999 &quot;Boom Dot Bust&quot; and 2001 &quot;Bride of Firesign&quot;, which received a third Grammy nomination. &quot;Boom Dot Bust&quot; used material from their 1979 Roxy show &quot;Welcome to Billville&quot;.

==21st century==
They created a live show, &quot;Radio Now Live&quot; in 2001 using characters from &quot;Give Me Immortality&quot; and released it on a live album, which also includes updated cuts from &quot;Anythynge You Want To&quot;.

In December 2001, the Firesigns appeared in a 90-minute PBS television show &quot;Weirdly Cool&quot;. This contained live, updated performance material based on &quot;Waiting for the Electrician&quot;, &quot;How Can You Be in Two Places...&quot;, and &quot;Don&#x27;t Crush That Dwarf&quot;; and included interviews and two Jack Poet Volkswagen commercials.

From November 2002 through early 2003, Bergman produced a political satire series &quot;True Confessions of the Real World&quot;, three times weekly on Pasadena non-commercial KPCC FM. He scripted fake interviews with imaginary &quot;newsmakers&quot;.

The Firesigns appeared on the NPR show &quot;All Things Considered&quot; on US holidays from July 4 to December 31, 2002; these were compiled on a CD, &quot;All Things Firesign&quot;. They also appeared for President&#x27;s Day on February 17, 2003, and Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day on March 17, 2003.

In 2008, they released a four-CD boxed set &quot;The Firesign Theatre&#x27;s Box of Danger&quot;, compiling most material which featured their most famous character, Nick Danger, including a bootleg recording of a 1976 live performance.

Their penultimate album was the 2010 &quot;Duke of Madness Motors: The Complete &quot;Dear Friends&quot; Radio Era&quot;, a combination book and data DVD comprising a complete compilation, totaling over 80 hours, of their 1970s radio shows &quot;Firesign Theatre Radio Hour Hour&quot;, &quot;Dear Friends&quot;, and &quot;Let&#x27;s Eat&quot; (the last two in both original broadcast, and syndication-edited form). Their last live performance as a quartet was on December 10, 2011 in Portland, Oregon. They could claim to be the longest surviving group from the &quot;classic rock&quot; era to still be intact with the original members (45 years).

Bergman died in a Santa Monica hospital on March 9, 2012, from complications of leukemia. According to Austin, the remaining three Firesigns&#x27; April 21, 2012 memorial for Bergman was their last live performance. Austin died in Fox Island, Washington, on June 18, 2015, from complications of cancer.

A compilation album distilled from the &quot;Duke of Madness Motors&quot; set, &quot;Dope Humor of the Seventies&quot;, was released by Stand Up! Records in November 2020. The title is another Firesign inside joke: it was first used in 1972 for a fictional album hawked by Austin as &quot;Dexter Fogg&quot; in &quot;Martian Space Party&quot; (heard on &quot;Not Insane&quot;). Ossman called &quot;Dope Humor&quot; a sort of &quot;dark side&quot; to the &quot;Dear Friends&quot; album, since both were compiled from the same source, but the sketches on &quot;Dope Humor&quot; had not been constrained by the desire to keep the material radio-friendly, as had been the case for &quot;Dear Friends&quot;. Proctor called the release a tribute to Austin and Bergman.

==Firesign members==
Peter Bergman (born under the fire sign Sagittarius in Cleveland, Ohio on November 29, 1939; died March 9, 2012) started his radio career on his high school radio system during the Korean War. He was kicked off the air by the principal when, as a prank, he announced a Communist takeover of the school. He studied economics at Yale (class of 1961) and was managing editor of the university&#x27;s comedy magazine. In his second graduate year he became a fellow in playwriting. As a member of the Yale Dramatic Association, he co-wrote two musical comedies with Austin Pendleton. Later, he considered attending medical school and helped produce a machine for viewing angiocardiograms and measuring blockage of the arteries of the heart. He had a deep voice and frequently took African-American roles in Firesign Theatre and Proctor and Bergman works.

Philip Proctor (born under the fire sign Leo in Goshen, Indiana on July 28, 1940) was a boy soprano in a children&#x27;s choir and studied acting at Yale. There, he met his future partner Bergman in the Yale Dramatic Association, where he starred in the two musical comedies written by Bergman and Pendleton. He became a professional actor, with a role on the soap opera &quot;The Edge of Night&quot;, before contacting Bergman and joining him on &quot;Radio Free Oz&quot; in 1966. Proctor&#x27;s adult tenor voice enables him to do a convincing female voice without using falsetto; therefore he usually did most of the female roles in the Firesign Theatre and Proctor and Bergman works, though the other three Firesigns occasionally did female voices. He also has done celebrity voice impersonations on Firesign material, including W.C. Fields (&quot;Waiting For the Electrician&quot; and &quot;How Can You Be In Two Places...&quot;), Robert F. Kennedy (&quot;Waiting For the Electrician&quot;), and a Peter Lorre-like voice for the Nick Danger character Rocky Rococo (&quot;Box of Danger&quot;). Proctor has also acted and appeared as a voice actor on many television shows and several feature films.

Phil Austin (born under the fire sign Aries in Denver, Colorado on April 6, 1941; died June 18, 2015), was the youngest Firesign. He attended college but never graduated. He was an accomplished lead guitarist, and he was responsible for adding much of the music to Firesign works. He also appeared as an actor and voice actor on television. He used his natural, sonorous baritone voice for Nick Danger, but affected a phony Japanese accent for his &quot;Young Guy, Motor Detective&quot; self-parody of Danger in &quot;Not Insane&quot; and a stereotypical, tough-guy voice and accent for the similar hardboiled detective Dick Private in &quot;Roller Maidens From Outer Space&quot;. He also could do an old-man voice as Doc Technical in the &quot;Dear Friends&quot; radio &quot;Mark Time&quot; episode, and he applied his impersonation of Richard Nixon as presidents in several Firesign and solo works (&quot;Bozos&quot;, &quot;How Time Flys&quot;, &quot;Roller Maidens&quot;, and &quot;Everything You Know Is Wrong&quot;). He also did an Elvis Presley impersonation singing the news in the &quot;Roller Maidens&quot; track &quot;The Bad News&quot;.

David Ossman (born under the fire sign Sagittarius in Santa Monica, California on December 6, 1936), the oldest Firesign, is known as the intellectual of the group, and he is known for doing an old-man voice (most famously as Catherwood the butler in the original Nick Danger story, George Tirebiter on &quot;Don&#x27;t Crush That Dwarf&quot; and &quot;In the Next World You&#x27;re On Your Own&quot;, and as the elder ant Cornelius in Disney Pixar&#x27;s 1998 &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot;.) He used his natural voice as astronaut Mark Time and newsman Harold Hiphugger. Outside of the Firesign Theatre, he has performed several voices on &quot;The Tick&quot; animated TV series and worked extensively as a producer and on-air narrator on National Public Radio and several affiliated stations.

===Associate Firesigns===

Several people have been accorded unofficial &quot;associate Firesign&quot; status over the years, by virtue of performing on several records with the group.

Austin&#x27;s first wife Annalee performed in support of the group on several golden age albums. She is credited as a member of &quot;the St. Louis Aquarium Choraleers&quot; (singing the hymn &quot;Marching to Shibboleth&quot;) and as &quot;the Wake-Up Lady&quot; and for birdsong on &quot;Don&#x27;t Crush That Dwarf&quot;; as &quot;Mickey&quot; and with keyboard stylings on &quot;I Think We&#x27;re All Bozos&quot;; with film footage on the &quot;Dear Friends&quot; album; and organ, piano, and vocals on &quot;Not Insane&quot;.

Ossman&#x27;s first wife Tiny (Tinika) performed as a St. Louis Aquarium Choraleer and as part of the &quot;Ambient&#x27;s Noyes Choral&quot; (singing the Peorgie and Mudhead theme song) on &quot;Don&#x27;t Crush That Dwarf&quot;; as &quot;Ann&quot; on &quot;I Think We&#x27;re All Bozos&quot;; as Nurse Angela and news reporter Chiquita Bandana on &quot;How Time Flys&quot;; and vocals and percussion on &quot;Not Insane&quot;. She and Ossman co-hosted a Sunday night radio program of pre–World War II music on KTYD.

Austin married his second wife Oona in 1971. She is credited as an anonymous extra in &quot;I Think We&#x27;re All Bozos&quot;; was photographed as one of the &quot;Roller Maidens From Outer Space&quot; and sang backup vocals for the Austin solo album; and appeared as a Reebus Caneebus groupie in the film version of &quot;Everything You Know Is Wrong&quot;. She is the model for the blonde femme fatale on the cover art of the &quot;Box of Danger&quot; CD set, and is credited with performing support functions such as photography and catering on several of the later albums.

Proctor&#x27;s third wife, actress Melinda Peterson, appeared with Proctor and Bergman on their 1990 NPR serial &quot;&quot;. She also performed on the &quot;Give Me Immortality ...&quot;, &quot;Boom Dot Bust&quot;, and &quot;Bride of Firesign&quot; albums and supported the group in the &quot;Radio Now Live&quot; show.

===Timeline===

==Cultural influence==
In 1997, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked the Firesign Theatre among the &quot;Thirty Greatest Comedy Acts of All Time&quot;. In 2005, the US Library of Congress added &quot;Don&#x27;t Crush That Dwarf, Hand Me the Pliers&quot; to the National Recording Registry, and called the group &quot;the Beatles of comedy.&quot;

Comedians George Carlin, Robin Williams, and John Goodman enjoyed the Firesigns&#x27; comedy and lent their comments to the 2001 PBS television special &quot;Weirdly Cool&quot;. Williams referred to Firesign albums as &quot;the audio equivalent of a Hieronymus Bosch painting.&quot;

Beatle John Lennon was photographed wearing the Firesign&#x27;s &quot;Not Insane – Papoon for President&quot; campaign button they had made for &quot;Martian Space Party&quot; (&quot;Not Insane&quot; album).

Musical satirist &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic paid homage to the Firesigns by giving the title &quot;Everything You Know Is Wrong&quot; to an original song on his 1996 album &quot;Bad Hair Day&quot;.

Steve Jobs paid homage to the Firesigns&#x27; &quot;I Think We&#x27;re All Bozos&quot; album by programming an &quot;Easter egg&quot; in Apple&#x27;s Siri intelligent personal assistant. Siri responds to the prompt &quot;This is worker speaking. Hello&quot; with &quot;Hello Ah-Clem. What function can I perform for you? LOL&quot;.

On several occurrences of the Association for Consciousness Exploration (ACE)&#x27;s Starwood Festival, director Jeff Rosenbaum has organized performances of Firesign Theatre radio plays performed by organizers and guest speakers of the event under the name &quot;Firesign Clones&quot;.

===Copyright infringement===
In Madison, Wisconsin in 1974, a pair of University of Illinois students opened the first of a regional chain of pizza restaurants they named &quot;Rocky Rococo&quot; after the Nick Danger character, without any mention of connection to the Firesign Theatre. They hired an artist to design, as their logo, a moustachioed Italian with a white hat and sunglasses, suggested by the White Spy from Mad Magazine, and hired comic actor Jim Pederson to portray this &quot;Rocky Rococo&quot; wearing a white suit.

The Firesigns visited the first Rocky Rococo Pizza when on tour in Madison in 1975 and reacted with good humor, joking around with the owners and giving them pictures that said, &quot;To Rocky, from Rocky&quot; which were hung on the wall. But in 1985, by which time the chain had grown to 62 restaurants and the Firesigns had passed their &quot;golden age&quot;, they sent the owners a letter claiming ownership of the name. The pizza chain&#x27;s lawyers found a similar case where an Austin, Texas pizzeria named Conan&#x27;s ran afoul of the copyright owners, producers of the 1982 film &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot;. Since the creator of the &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot; comic had similarly endorsed the restaurant by drawing Conan on its walls, the suit lost in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, so the Firesigns settled out of court.

===Mark Time awards===
Ossman and his second wife Judith Walcutt formed Otherworld Media Productions in 1985 to produce audio theatre. They created an annual &quot;Mark Time award&quot; for best radio science fiction, named after Ossman&#x27;s astronaut character. In 2015, they added three new awards named after Firesign Theatre characters:

*Nick Danger prize for best mystery/detective fiction
*The Bradshaw prize (after Bergman&#x27;s cop character) for &quot;service to the field&quot;
*The Betty Jo (But Everyone Knew Her as Nancy) prize, judged by Phil Proctor and his wife, for best &quot;multi-gender&quot; vocal performance

<text>is a small offshore island, about in circumference, at the mouth of the Katase River which flows into the Sagami Bay of Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. Administratively, Enoshima is part of the mainland city of Fujisawa, and is linked to the Katase section of that city by a bridge. Home to some of the closest sandy beaches to Tokyo and Yokohama, the island and adjacent coastline are the hub of a local resort area.

==History==
===Classical era===
Benzaiten, the goddess of music and entertainment, is enshrined on the island. The island in its entirety is dedicated to the goddess, who is said to have caused it to rise from the bottom of the sea in the sixth century. The island is the scene of the &quot;Enoshima Engi&quot;, a history of shrines on Enoshima written by the Japanese Buddhist monk Kōkei in 1047 AD.

===Modern era===
In 1880, after the Shinto and Buddhism separation order of the new Meiji government had made the land available, much of the uplands was purchased by Samuel Cocking, a British merchant, in his Japanese wife&#x27;s name. He developed a power plant and extensive botanical gardens including a very large greenhouse. Although the original greenhouse was destroyed in the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake, the botanical garden (now the Samuel Cocking Garden) remains an attraction with over half a million visitors a year.

===Contemporary era===
Enoshima is now the center of Shōnan, a resort area along the coast of Sagami Bay.

== Food ==
*Various forms of rice cracker, including those of octopus (&quot;Maruyaki Tako Senbei&quot;) , shrimp, and whitebait at Asahi Honten
==Transportation==
Enoshima is served by three nearby railway stations: Katase-Enoshima Terminus on the Odakyū Enoshima Line, Enoshima Station on the Enoshima Electric Railway (&quot;Enoden&quot;), and Shōnan-Enoshima Station on the Shonan Monorail.

== Features ==
*Enoshima Illuminations - A large-scale light show that runs from December through the end of February. The show is free, but admission to the Samuel Cocking Garden is required.
*Enoshima Sea Candle- located within the Samuel Cocking Garden.
*Enoshima Shrine
*Iwaya Caves - were formed by the erosion of waves in ancient times. It has also been a place for Buddhist monks to train. The Iwaya caves consists of the First Cave ( in length) and the Second Cave ( in length). These caves can be entered by purchasing a ticket.
*Lover&#x27;s Hill/Bell of Ryuren - A romantic place where lovers post messages with padlocks, a mini-version of the love locks in Paris. 
*Luminous Way - A set of three illuminated escalators which take visitors from the base of the Enoshima Shrine to the Samuel Cocking Garden, bypassing a series of long and steep stairways. Fees required.
*Samuel Cocking Garden- located at the island&#x27;s summit.

==Sport==
Enoshima was the Olympic harbor for the 1964 Summer Olympics. Enoshima was also used as the sailing venue for the 2020 Summer Olympics.

== Accessibility ==
While the bridge and town area of Enoshima are wheelchair accessible, anything past the main gate of the shrine (including the observation tower, caves, etc.) is inaccessible to those with mobility difficulties.

<text>Queens College (QC) is a public college in the New York City borough of Queens. Part of the City University of New York system, Queens College occupies an campus primarily located in Flushing.

Queens College was established in 1937 and offers undergraduate degrees in over 70 majors, graduate studies in over 100 degree programs and certificates, over 40 accelerated master&#x27;s options, 20 doctoral degrees through the CUNY Graduate Center, and a number of advanced certificate programs. Alumni and faculty of the school, such as Arturo O&#x27;Farrill and Jerry Seinfeld, have received over 100 Grammy Award nominations.

The college is organized into seven schools. It competes in Division II of the NCAA and sponsors 15 men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s championship-eligible varsity teams.

==History==

===Before 1937===

Before Queens College was established in 1937, the site of the campus was home to the Jamaica Academy, a one-room schoolhouse built in the early 19th century, where Walt Whitman once worked as a teacher. The building was located on Flushing-Jamaica Road (later renamed Kissena Boulevard). Jamaica Academy became public in 1844. In 1909, the New York Parental School, a home for troubled boys, opened on the land surrounding the future site of Queens College and incorporated Jamaica Academy on its campus. Buildings such as Jefferson Hall (named after Thomas Jefferson) were used as both dormitories and classrooms.

In 1934, the New York Parental School was investigated amid rumors of abuse. The school was shut down and students were transferred to local public schools. A few months later, the grounds were turned over to the city. The city planned to house 500 mental patients from Randall&#x27;s Island Hospital, who were temporarily displaced by the construction of the Triborough Bridge.

===Founding===

Meanwhile, County Judge Charles S. Colden appointed and chaired a committee to assess the feasibility of opening a free college in Queens. In September 1935, the committee recommended the establishment of such a college. Mayor La Guardia backed the recommendation and pushed for the free college&#x27;s creation. In March 1937, the Board of Education designated the site of the former Parental School to be the future location of Queens College. Paul Klapper, former dean of the School of Education at City College of New York, was appointed the new college&#x27;s president. The college opened in October 1937—later than anticipated due to a painters&#x27; strike—with 21 members on its teaching staff and 400 students in its inaugural freshmen class. The school&#x27;s colors of blue and silver were selected by a &quot;Color Committee&quot; drawn from the entering class of students, and were announced at the first school dance, which was held on Wednesday, November 24, 1937. Around 1,200 students enlisted in the American military during World War II; fifty-nine would be killed in action.

=== Motto ===
Queens College&#x27;s motto is &quot;Discimus ut serviamus&quot;, which translates to &quot;We learn so that we may serve.&quot; With public service for the common good on his mind, Queens College president Paul Klapper created the motto in 1937 to inspire the first class of students and the following generations.

=== Late 20th century ===
The college campus grew as buildings were constructed and enrollment increased. But changes beyond growth were in store for Queens College: in 1970, CUNY adopted the controversial policy of Open Admissions, which guaranteed a place at CUNY for any high school graduate in New York, regardless of traditional criteria like grades or test scores. The program was intended to offer college education to more New York City residents, in particular those of color. But Open Admissions did not seem to affect Queens College as much as it did other schools — a year after its implementation, only 10% of its student body was black or Puerto Rican, according to the newly appointed college president, Joseph S. Murphy. In 1973, enrollment at Queens reached an all-time high of 31,413 students. By 1976 new concerns overtook the college as New York City faced a crippling financial crisis. CUNY&#x27;s policy of free tuition was revoked; the overall CUNY budget was cut by $135 million; and CUNY Chancellor Robert Kibbee demanded that Queens College slash its budget by 15%. Some faculty members resigned in protest. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported in December 1976 that &quot;Queens College, considered the jewel in the university&#x27;s crown, has been particularly hard hit by the cuts, which have gone to the heart of the faculty.&quot; All hiring and building on campus was halted.

In 1979, President Jimmy Carter became the first sitting president to visit Queens College, where he conducted a Town Hall Meeting at Colden Center.

By 1984, student enrollment had declined to 15,000. But with a $175 million building program in place by 1986 for the college&#x27;s 50th anniversary, enrollments were expected to rise and the college was beginning to recover from the financial crisis of the 1970s. In addition, the student body, in accordance with the mission of the short-lived Open Admissions program, had grown much more diverse, and college faculty were trained to understand Latin American culture and how to teach American literature to non-native students. By that time, former Queens College president Joseph S. Murphy was CUNY Chancellor. In the 1990s, the college attracted high-profile researchers to its faculty, including the virologist Luc Montagnier. Under President Allen Lee Sessoms, the college underwent some growth but also some missteps, including the highly publicized inability to fund the planned AIDS research center that Montagnier had been hired to lead.

====Involvement in the Civil Rights Movement====
Queens College students were active participants in the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s, including the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom in 1963. The most well-known student activist was Andrew Goodman, who was slain in Mississippi in 1964 with two other young men, James Chaney, and Michael Schwerner; all three were trying to register African Americans to vote in the South. Schwerner and Chaney were on the organizing staff of CORE; Goodman was a Freedom Summer volunteer. The three activists were stopped and arrested for allegedly driving over the speed limit on a Mississippi road. After being brought into the sheriff&#x27;s department and released, the three young men were stopped by two carloads of Ku Klux Klan members on a remote rural road. The men approached their car, then shot and killed all three young men. The murders received national attention, and six conspirators were brought to trial and convicted by federal prosecutors for civil rights violations. The Chaney-Goodman-Schwerner Clock Tower of Rosenthal Library, a highly visible borough landmark, is named in their honor.

In February 2011, Queens College inherited the personal collection of the late James Forman. The collection, along with other civil rights leaders&#x27; collections, is available online at the Queens College Civil Rights Archive. A special program on February 17, 2011, included a presentation by the Honorable Julian Bond for Black History Month, as well as a formal announcement of the acquisition.

===21st century===
The college campus continued improving its facilities. Under a $1 billion CUNY-wide improvement program, Queens College&#x27;s Powdermaker Hall was given a $57 million renovation, begun in 2000.

By 2014, enrollment was 20,000 students, half of whom come from minority backgrounds.

Felix V. Matos Rodriguez was appointed president of Queens College by the CUNY Board of Trustees in 2014. Five years later, he became the first Latino Chancellor of the City University of New York. William Tramontano served as QC&#x27;s interim president from 2019 until July 1, 2020, when Frank H. Wu succeeded him as the new college president.

Budgetary pressures from city government continued to affect Queens College in the 2020s. In November 2023, Mayor Eric Adams ordered $23 million in CUNY-wide cuts. As a result, two weeks before the start of classes, Queens College did not reappoint 26 faculty lecturers. That number fell to 24, and 10 were re-hired on an adjunct basis. Courses without instructors were cancelled or divided among remaining faculty.

==Campus and facilities==
The campus, located off Kissena Boulevard, is on a -high hill that faces Manhattan. Six of the original Spanish-style buildings dating back to the early 20th century still stand, such as Jefferson Hall, which was built in 1907. The college has since expanded to over 40 buildings, including the main classroom building, Powdermaker Hall, rebuilt in 2003 and named after the college&#x27;s distinguished anthropologist Hortense Powdermaker.

Queens College is one of two CUNY colleges that participates in Division II sports (the other is the College of Staten Island). A Child Development Center, staffed by professionals, offers inexpensive child care services to students with children. 

The Godwin-Ternbach Museum, which opened in 1981 and houses more than 7,000 works of art, is located in Queens College&#x27;s Klapper Hall, named after the former school president, Paul Klapper. Godwin-Ternbach Museum is the only museum in the City University of New York (CUNY) system, and is the only encyclopedic collection of its kind in the borough of Queens. Its collection is global in breadth and deeply historical, with works of art and artifacts ranging from antiquity to the present. The outdoor plaza in front of the museum hosts a site-specific installation by Vito Acconci titled, &quot;More Balls For Klapper Hall&quot; (or &quot;Untitled&quot;). The artwork had been damaged over the years, and is in the second phase of a complete conservation program enacted by the college administration. Klapper Hall also houses the Fine Arts and English Departments, and boasts the largest ceramics studio within the CUNY system. Other facilities in this building include a metal working studio and foundry, wood shop, black and white darkroom, student gallery and a suite of art studios for BFA and MFA candidates.

The college holds courses at several off-campus locations, including the 43rd Street Extension Center in Manhattan and the CUNY Center for Higher Education in downtown Flushing, which opened in late 2003.

The college has a low-rise 506-bed residence hall on campus called the Summit Apartments, which opened in late 2009. This makes Queens College one of only four CUNY campuses with dorm facilities (the others being Hunter College, the College of Staten Island, and City College).

The college is home to the Aaron Copland School of Music (named for Aaron Copland), which is located in the Music Building. The Music Building also houses the music library and the 490-seat LeFrak Concert Hall.

CUNY School of Law was previously located to the west of the campus of Queens College; while it was always a separate administrative unit of CUNY, the building itself read &quot;CUNY School of Law at Queens College&quot;, and was once a building for the Department of Education. The CUNY Board of Trustees approved plans for the Law School to be relocated to 2 Court Square in Long Island City, with the first semester of classes held in 2012. Queens College has since taken over the former Law School building, now named Queens Hall and home to the college&#x27;s language departments.

Townsend Harris High School and John Bowne High School are located at the edge of the Queens College campus.

=== The Kupferberg Center for the Arts ===
The Kupferberg Center for the Arts is home to Colden Auditorium, Goldstein Theatre, and the Ethel &amp; Samuel Lefrak Concert Hall. Trevor Noah, Jerry Seinfeld, David Bowie, Patti LaBelle and Johnny Mathis, The Byrds, Victor Manuelle, Cesar Millan, and El Gran Combo have performed at Colden.

===Benjamin Rosenthal Library===

The campus maintains the Benjamin Rosenthal Library. The library&#x27;s Chaney-Schwerner-Goodman Clocktower was named after the three civil rights workers who were murdered in 1964, including Andrew Goodman, a Queens College student. Built in 1988, the library contains over 800,000 books, 32,600 print and electronic materials, the electronic archives, a collection of multimedia materials in its Media Center and an art center. The library is also home to the Louis Armstrong archives.

The Art Library and the Queens College Art Center are on the sixth floor of Rosenthal. The Art Library has over 70,000 books; 5,000 bound periodicals; and 110,000 slides, pictures, and exhibition catalogs and pamphlets. The collection includes resources for the study of all aspects of the visual arts and material culture, including art and architectural history, theory, criticism, materials, techniques, and practice.

Nurtured by both the Aaron Copland School of Music and the Queens College Library, the Music Library has evolved into a first-class research facility and is the largest music collection in the CUNY system. The Music Library is located on two levels in the School of Music building and contains over 35,000 scores, 30,000 books, and 20,000 sound recordings, including the David S. Walker Music Education Collection and the Ursula Springer Choral Music Collection.

===Godwin-Ternbach Museum===
Since 1957 Queens College has been collecting works of art, these collections were initially used for teaching purposes and were meant to serve the college community. The collections were eventually brought together with the establishment of the Godwin-Ternbach Museum in 1981. The museum is now a part of the Kupferberg Center for the Arts, which has joined all the arts entities on campus in collaborations of visual, performance, dance, and theater arts. Former museum director, Amy Winter spent 16 years from the early 1990s on, introducing an active exhibition program and an expansion of collections related care and management. To address these concerns, Winter turned to MAP (The Museum Assessment Program); as a result not only did the museum improve its facilities but increased its collections-related staff as well. Today, co-directors Louise Weinberg and Maria Pio, manage the museum with its encyclopedic collections along with an ambitious agenda of workshops, school visits, gallery talks, zoom events, and a vigorous online presence. Exhibitions and programs are free and open to the public. The museum is an integral part of Queens College that serves not only the students, faculty, and staff but the community at large.

The museum, located in Klapper Hall, maintains a fine collection of 7,000 pieces of art, as well as artifacts from all cultures dating from ancient times to the modern day. These include works by Rembrandt, Louise Nevelson, Pablo Picasso, Claudia DeMonte, Henri Matisse, Andy Warhol, Margot Lovejoy, Hale Aspacio Woodruff, and George Braque.

===Residence===

Queens College&#x27;s first residence hall, the Summit Apartments, opened in 2009. This low-rise, 506-bed facility is located in the middle of the campus. Queens College is still primarily a commuter school, as only 500 of its over 19,000 students live on campus. The building has a gold certificate from the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), an organization that certifies buildings to have met environmentally sustainable construction standards. Queens College&#x27;s residence hall offers study lounges on each floor, wireless internet, laundry services, and a state of the art fitness center. The Summit Apartments also includes kitchens with full-size appliances, as well as dining areas, microwaves, couches, entertainment stands, and music practice rooms.

In addition to the Summit, many students rent apartments off-campus in the surrounding neighborhoods.

<text>Song and Dance is a musical comprising two acts, one told entirely in &quot;Song&quot; and one entirely in &quot;Dance&quot;, tied together by a unifying love story.

The &quot;Song&quot; act is &quot;Tell Me on a Sunday&quot;, with lyrics by Don Black and music by Andrew Lloyd Webber, about a young British woman&#x27;s romantic misadventures in New York City and Hollywood. The &quot;Dance&quot; act is a ballet choreographed to &quot;Variations&quot;, composed by Andrew Lloyd Webber for his cellist brother Julian, which is based on the A Minor Caprice No. 24 by Paganini.

==Background==
The &quot;Song&quot; portion was written specifically for Marti Webb, and presented at the Sydmonton Festival in the summer of 1979. It was subsequently recorded and aired as a one-hour television special by the BBC the following January. The &quot;Dance&quot; portion was recorded in 1978, and nearly became incorporated into &quot;Cats&quot;. The opening sequence was utilized as the theme music for London Weekend Television&#x27;s &quot;South Bank Show&quot;.

Producer Cameron Mackintosh proposed that the two pieces be combined under the umbrella title &quot;Song and Dance&quot; to acknowledge the primary aspect of each act, billing the piece as &quot;a concert for the theatre&quot;.

Black altered some of the songs from the original album and worked with Lloyd Webber on new material: &quot;The Last Man in My Life&quot;, &quot;I Love New York&quot; and &quot;Married Man&quot;, the latter set to the same tune as &quot;Sheldon Bloom&quot;. A new orchestration of the &quot;Variations&quot; for a sixteen-piece theatre orchestra was produced from the original symphonic version played by the London Philharmonic Orchestra but Harry Rabinowitz retained the baton for the stage production. &quot;When You Want to Fall in Love&quot;, with a tune previously released by Marti Webb and Justin Hayward as &quot;Unexpected Song&quot; which itself was later added to the score, was used at the climax of the dance section to meld the two halves.

==Productions==

===1982 London===
The musical had its world premiere on March 26, 1982 at the Palace Theatre, where it ran for 781 performances, directed by John Caird. Marti Webb performed the &quot;Song&quot; half; she subsequently was succeeded in February 1983 by Gemma Craven, who had performed the show for a month during Webb&#x27;s holiday in August the previous year. Craven was followed by Lulu and Liz Robertson. Carol Nielsson, Webb&#x27;s original understudy took over the role with two hour notice when Lulu damaged her voice after a foldback monitor failed during a performance. The &quot;Dance&quot; portion was choreographed by Anthony Van Laast and featured Wayne Sleep and Jane Darling. Stewart Avon-Arnold also appeared as a contemporary dancer in the second act.

The set and lighting was designed by David Hersey, costumes by Robin Don, and sound by Andrew Bruce and Julian Beech.

The original recording of the London production was made live on the opening night using a recording studio then built into the Palace Theatre. The album was produced by Martin Levan, who also co-designed the sound system for the show.

Soon after the production closed, the show was filmed for a television broadcast, with Sarah Brightman and Wayne Sleep in the lead roles.

===1983 Australia===
The Australian production of the musical opened at the Theatre Royal in Sydney on 4 August 1983. It featured Gaye MacFarlane and John Meehan in the leading roles.

===1985 Broadway===
In anticipation of a Broadway run, director and lyricist Richard Maltby Jr. was approached to adapt the first act for an American audience. The Broadway production, choreographed by Peter Martins, opened on September 18, 1985 at the Royale Theatre conducted by John Mauceri, and closed on November 8, 1986, after 474 performances and seventeen previews. Bernadette Peters starred in &quot;Song&quot; for nearly thirteen months; she was succeeded by Betty Buckley for the final four weeks. &quot;Dance&quot; featured Christopher d&#x27;Amboise and Gregg Burge. Amongst the many changes to the show, the characters were all given names, with &#x27;the girl&#x27; now known as Emma.

Singer-songwriter Melissa Manchester starred in a subsequent six-month US national tour of the show in 1987, starting in Dallas, Texas and ending in Tampa, Florida.

The Broadway production received eight Tony Award nominations, with Peters winning the award for Best Actress in a Musical.

The recording of the Broadway production, featuring Peters in the entire first act but none of the music from second act, was recorded in 1985 by RCA Victor.

==Synopsis==
&quot;Song&quot; focuses on an English girl who has recently arrived in New York City. Following an argument with her boyfriend, they decide to break up. She writes to her mother in England about what happened, and that she has met a new man, Hollywood producer Sheldon Bloom, with whom she travels to California. She eventually realizes that Sheldon has only been using her as a trophy, and she ends things once and for all.

The woman returns to New York disappointed and meets a younger man who she finds more fulfilling. When he has to leave on a business trip, the woman can&#x27;t bear to let him go. Her friend later comes over to tell her about the man&#x27;s infidelity, and she asks him for the truth.

Depressed, the woman walks through the city streets. She meets a married man and reflects on whether their affair is wrong. The married man comes by to confess his love; however, she realizes that she has been using him. In the end she decides that it was not the end of the world to have no one.

&quot;Dance&quot; explores the story of the younger man, his various relationships and his commitment issues. At the end, the man sees the woman, and they make up, joining both at last in Song and Dance.

==Critical reception==

Reviewing the London production, the &quot;Financial Times&quot; theatre critic Michael Coveney claimed, &quot;It is a long time since I have sat through a more ostentatious, less theatrically coherent evening.&quot;

In Frank Rich&#x27;s review of the Broadway production for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, he wrote: &quot;Miss Peters is more than talented: As an actress, singer, comedienne and all-around warming presence, she has no peer in the musical theater right now. In her half of &quot;Song &amp; Dance,&quot; she works so hard you&#x27;d think she were pleading for mercy before a firing squad. Yet for all the vocal virtuosity, tempestuous fits and husky-toned charm she brings to her one-woman musical marathon, we never care if her character lives or dies.&quot;

John Simon, in &quot;The New York Magazine&quot;, noted that the unseen men seemed &quot;nebulous and unreal, so too, does the seen woman&quot;, and in the &quot;Dance&quot; half, &quot;things go from bad to worse.&quot; However, he wrote that &quot;Miss Peters is an unimpeachable peach of a performer who does so much for the top half of this double bill as to warrant its immediate rechristening &#x27;Song of Bernadette&#x27;. She not only sings, acts, and (in the bottom half) dances to perfection, she also, superlatively, &#x27;is&#x27; &quot;.

<doc id="309705" wikidata="Q3983042" url="?curid=309705" title="Tell Me on a Sunday">
<text>Tell Me on a Sunday is a musical with music by Andrew Lloyd Webber and lyrics by Don Black. A one-woman show, it has been performed by a number of female singers/actors, most notably Marti Webb and Bernadette Peters. A one-act song cycle, it tells the story of an ordinary English girl from Muswell Hill, who journeys to the United States in search of love. Her romantic misadventures begin in New York City, lead her to Hollywood, and eventually take her back to Manhattan.

==Background==
The musical is based on an idea originally conceived by Tim Rice, who intended to develop it as a cycle of television shows with songwriting partner Andrew Lloyd Webber. The two relished working on a small-scale project following &quot;Evita&quot;. Shortly after they began working, however, Lloyd Webber realized Rice was writing specifically for Elaine Paige, with whom Rice was having an affair. Lloyd Webber felt that allowing Paige to appear in the series would suggest he approved of the relationship, so he decided to look for a new lyricist. He opted for Don Black who, following a successful stint in Hollywood (including an Academy Award for Best Original Song for &quot;Born Free&quot;), had begun writing for the theatre. Although it had proven to be unsuccessful, his &quot;Bar Mitzvah Boy&quot; had impressed Lloyd Webber, who thought Black would be a good match.

Rice&#x27;s original concept had kept &#x27;the girl&#x27; in the UK. It was Black who suggested she emigrate to the States. He quickly began writing lyrics for several tunes Lloyd Webber already had composed. It was their intent to present as complete a work as possible at the Sydmonton Festival in September 1979. The two decided to cast Marti Webb, who was portraying Eva Perón at the matinee performances of &quot;Evita&quot;, as their heroine, and the show was first presented at the 1979 Sydmonton Festival.

==Productions==

===Original album and broadcast===
The positive reception at Sydmonton led to the show being recorded as an album. Following this, a special performance was filmed at the Royalty Theatre in London on 28 January 1980, and later broadcast on the BBC on 12 February 1980, although it was produced in 1979 according to the credits. The broadcast was a critical success and garnered high ratings, leading it to be repeated the following month. Following its transmission, the album reached #2 on the UK charts, and the single release of &quot;Take That Look Off Your Face&quot; reached #3. This success propelled Marti Webb into a household name, despite being in the theatrical business for twenty years. She followed this with a number of her own albums and two further top 20 singles.

The original version was broadcast again for the first time in over 40 years, on BBC Four, in March 2023.

===&quot;Song and Dance&quot;===

Lloyd Webber decided the piece could work well on the stage if paired with another one-act piece. He previously had considered writing a brief operatic piece about the friendship between Giacomo Puccini and Ruggiero Leoncavallo, going so far as to compose a melody that would later become &quot;Memory&quot;, but decided it would not fit well with the girl&#x27;s saga. He tried adapting the Charles Dickens work &quot;The Signal-Man&quot;, but decided it was too gloomy and rejected it as well. Eventually he and Black set aside &quot;Tell Me on a Sunday&quot; and turned to other projects.

In 1982, the creative team decided to combine &quot;Tell Me on a Sunday&quot; with a ballet choreographed to Lloyd Webber&#x27;s &quot;Variations&quot;, a classical piece based on the A Minor Caprice No. 24 by Paganini that had debuted at Sydmonton in 1977. Following some revisions, including a new song &quot;The Last Man in My Life&quot; and several changes to the lyrics, &quot;Tell Me on a Sunday&quot; became Act I of &quot;Song and Dance&quot;, which was staged at the Palace Theatre in London&#x27;s West End. Marti Webb was again cast as &#x27;the girl&#x27;. Over the course of its run, she was succeeded by Lulu, Gemma Craven, Liz Robertson, and Sarah Brightman. Opening on 26th March 1982 and closing on 31st March 1984, the production ran for 781 performances.

Following its closure, on 28th April 1984, a special performance of &quot;Song and Dance&quot; featuring Sarah Brightman performing &quot;Tell Me on a Sunday&quot; was filmed at the Palace Theatre and later broadcast on UK television.

Lyricist Richard Maltby Jr. was brought in to help adapt the show for an American audience, in anticipation of a Broadway run. Bernadette Peters was chosen for the role of &#x27;the girl&#x27;, who was now renamed Emma. It opened on 18 September 1985 to mixed reviews. Writing in the &quot;New York Post&quot;, Clive Barnes thought it was &quot;the best thing that Lloyd Webber has written for the theater,&quot; but Frank Rich of the &quot;New York Times&quot; was not impressed, observing that &quot;empty material remains empty, no matter how talented those who perform it. Emma is a completely synthetic, not to mention insulting, creation whom no performer could redeem.&quot; Peters went on to win the Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Musical, but the show failed to win Best Musical or Best Original Score. Black, unimpressed that Peters had insisted on gathering background information about the character, later said he preferred the original London production and Webb&#x27;s performance.

===Subsequent productions as a stand-alone piece===
Reverting to its one-act format, &quot;Tell Me on a Sunday&quot; was substantially rewritten, with five new songs and additional material by Jackie Clune, for a 2003 London production at the Gielgud Theatre. The BBC critic observed, &quot;this may be the smallest show Lloyd Webber&#x27;s ever written, but the score (to appropriately conversational lyrics by Don Black) contains several of his very best songs.&quot; Directed by Christopher Luscombe and starring Denise Van Outen, it ran for ten months. Marti Webb succeeded Van Outen and subsequently toured the UK with the show, alternating with former Steps vocalist, Faye Tozer, and actress Patsy Palmer.

In 2008, the Alloy Theater Company staged the original one-act version with Irish actress, Maxine Linehan, at the Laurie Beechman Theatre in New York City. That same year, Bailiwick Repertory produced the Chicago premiere starring Harmony France to rave reviews and the Kookaburra Theatre presented the Australian premiere starring Jolene Anderson, with Noni Hazlehurst and John Waters providing the voices of &quot;Mum&quot; and &quot;Married Man&quot; respectively. Despite mixed reviews, it had sellout performances in both Sydney and Melbourne.

The show toured the United Kingdom, beginning on 30 August 2010 at Northampton&#x27;s Royal Theatre and continuing until autumn 2011. The tour starred Claire Sweeney as &#x27;the girl&#x27; and was directed by Tamara Harvey. The script was again updated for the 21st century, and &#x27;the girl&#x27; was rewritten as originating from Liverpool, like Claire Sweeney herself. The song list stayed closer to the original, although a new finale was added, &quot;Dreams Never Run on Time&quot;, itself a rewrite of the song &quot;Somewhere, Someplace, Sometime&quot; from the 2003 version.

In late 2013, Marti Webb performed the songs &quot;Tell Me on a Sunday&quot; and &quot;Take That Look Off Your Face&quot; at a tribute show to Don Black, where she met Lewis Carnie, the Head of Programmes for BBC Radio 2, who asked if she would consider performing the entire piece again for broadcast on the station. Producer Robert Mackintosh then suggested the show could be staged for a week at the St James Theatre, London in January, the popularity of which saw it being restaged for three weeks at the Duchess Theatre in February and early March, with musical direction by Simon Lee.
The latest production in Mandarin, premiered in Shanghai, China in early June 2018 with musical supervision by Fiz Shapur, who also supervised the Mandarin language production of CATS.

In January 2016, Jodie Prenger starred in a revival at the Watermill Theatre in Newbury directed by Paul Foster before touring the UK. The production toured again, starring Prenger in June 2021.

Tell Me On Sunday was the first show to open in Oslo, Norway past the pandemic. It opened at Chateau Neuf Theatre on May 31 and starred Charlotte Brænna. This version was based on the definitive 2016 version and was directed by Julie Ibenfeldt Lindvik, with musical supervision by Christian Sthäler. It was translated by Christian Ranke and Martine T. Lundeberg

==Synopsis==
&#x27;The girl&#x27; arrives in New York City, and tells her friend that she does not want to become a hard-bitten career woman or a user of men. Shortly after, she discovers her beau has been cheating on her with numerous other women and she walks out. She meets Hollywood producer Sheldon Bloom, who takes her to Los Angeles. Sheldon&#x27;s career ambitions preclude his spending much time on a personal relationship and, after realizing life in the film capital is uneventful and Sheldon has been using her as a trophy girlfriend, &#x27;the girl&#x27; returns to Manhattan.

Back in Greenwich Village, &#x27;the girl&#x27; meets a salesman, and once again faces disappointment when she learns he frequently has been in town with other women when he supposedly was away on business. The two split up and she meets a married man. Intent on succeeding in her career and acquiring a green card, she is content with the noon-to-two relationship they share, until he announces he plans to leave his wife and marry her instead. She is horrified because not only does she not love him, but she realizes she&#x27;s been using him, something she had vowed never to do. She sends him away and promises herself she will return to being the idealistic and ethical woman she was when she first arrived in the States.

&#x27;The girl&#x27; is the only person who appears on stage, despite having conversations with her friends and writing letters to her mum.

<doc id="309714" wikidata="Q615250" url="?curid=309714" title="Eilmer of Malmesbury">
<text>Eilmer of Malmesbury (also known as Oliver due to a scribe&#x27;s miscopying, or Elmer, or Æthelmær) was an 11th-century English Benedictine monk best known for his early attempt at a gliding flight using wings.

== Life ==
Eilmer was a monk of Malmesbury Abbey who wrote on astrology. All that is known of him is from the &quot;Gesta regum Anglorum&quot; (Deeds of the English Kings), written by the eminent medieval historian William of Malmesbury in about 1125. Being a fellow monk of the same abbey, William almost certainly obtained his account directly from people who knew Eilmer when he was an old man.

Later scholars, such as the American historian of technology Lynn White, have attempted to estimate Eilmer&#x27;s date of birth based on a quotation in William&#x27;s &quot;Deeds&quot; about Halley&#x27;s Comet, which appeared in 1066. However, William recorded Eilmer&#x27;s quotation not to establish his age, but to show that a prophecy was fulfilled when the Normans invaded England.

If Eilmer had seen Halley&#x27;s Comet 76 years earlier in 989, he could have been born about 984, making him about five or six years old when he first saw the comet, and therefore old enough to remember it. However the periodicity of comets was probably unknown in Eilmer&#x27;s time, and so his remark &quot;It is long since I saw you&quot; could have referred to a different, later comet. Since it is known that Eilmer was an &quot;old man&quot; in 1066, and that he had made the flight attempt &quot;in his youth&quot;, the event is placed some time during the early 11th century, perhaps in its first decade.

Beyond those based on William&#x27;s account, there are no other known sources documenting Eilmer&#x27;s life.

== The flight ==
William records that, in Eilmer&#x27;s youth, he had read and believed the Greek myth of Daedalus. Thus, Eilmer fixed wings to his hands and feet and launched himself from the top of a tower at Malmesbury Abbey:

Given the geography of the abbey, his landing site, and the account of his flight, to travel for &quot;more than a furlong&quot; (220 yards, 201 metres) he would have had to have been airborne for about 15 seconds. His exact flightpath is not known, nor how long he was in the air, because today&#x27;s abbey is not the abbey of the 11th century, when it was probably smaller, although the tower was probably close to the present height. &quot;Olivers Lane&quot;, off the present-day High Street and about from the abbey, is reputed locally to be the site where Eilmer landed. That would have taken him over many buildings. Maxwell Woosnam&#x27;s study concluded that he is more likely to have descended the steep hill off to the southwest of the abbey, rather than the town centre to the south.

Eilmer used a bird-like apparatus to glide downwards against the breeze. However, being unable to balance himself forward and backwards, as does a bird by slight movements of its wings, head and legs, he would have needed a large tail to maintain equilibrium. Eilmer could not have achieved true soaring flight, but he might have glided down safely with a tail. Eilmer said he had &quot;forgotten to provide himself with a tail.&quot;

== Historical traditions and influence ==
Other than William&#x27;s account of the flight, nothing has survived of Eilmer&#x27;s lifetime work as a monk, although his astrological treatises apparently still circulated as late as the 16th century.

Based on William&#x27;s account, the story of Eilmer&#x27;s flight has been retold many times through the centuries by scholars, encyclopaedists, and proponents of man-powered flight, keeping the idea of human flight alive. These include over the years: Helinand of Froidmont (before 1229), Alberic of Trois-Fontaines (before 1241), Vincent of Beauvais (1250s), Roger Bacon (c. 1260), Ranulf Higden (before 1352, and the first to misname him &quot;Oliver&quot;) and the English translators of his work: Henry Knighton (before 1367), John Nauclerus of Tübingen (c. 1500), John Wilkins (1648), John Milton (1670), and John Wise (1850).

More recently, Maxwell Woosnam in 1986 examined in more detail the technical aspects such as materials, glider angles, and wind effects.

Contemporaries had developed small drawstring toy helicopters, windmills, and sails for boats while church artists increasingly showed angels with more accurate bird-like wings, detailing the camber (curvature) that would help develop lift for heavier-than-air flight. Air was accepted as something that could be &quot;worked&quot;, and some people believed that humans could fly with physical effort and the right equipment. Still, for the monk Eilmer the idea of flight must have had a spiritual significance as well: he would not have been ignorant of the need to guard and stabilize the soul for its flight in the afterlife; the differences between angelic and human bodies; the weight of sin and the unnaturalness of ascending mortal flesh.

== Legacy ==
The School of Mechanical and Mining Engineering at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia, has developed a Computational Fluid Dynamics simulation code named Eilmer4. The short film &quot;Eilmer the Flying Monk&quot; recounts Eilmer&#x27;s attempt to emulate Icarus.

<text>The Sonoran Desert () is a hot desert and ecoregion in North America that covers the northwestern Mexican states of Sonora, Baja California, and Baja California Sur, as well as part of the Southwestern United States (in Arizona and California). It is the hottest desert in Mexico. It has an area of .

In phytogeography, the Sonoran Desert is within the Sonoran floristic province of the Madrean Region of southwestern North America, part of the Holarctic realm of the northern Western Hemisphere. The desert contains a variety of unique endemic plants and animals, notably, the saguaro (&quot;Carnegiea gigantea&quot;) and organ pipe cactus (&quot;Stenocereus thurberi&quot;).

The Sonoran Desert is clearly distinct from nearby deserts (e.g., the Great Basin, Mojave, and Chihuahuan deserts) because it provides subtropical warmth in winter and two seasons of rainfall (in contrast, for example, to the Mojave&#x27;s dry summers and cold winters). This creates an extreme contrast between aridity and moisture.

==Location==
The Sonoran desert wraps around the northern end of the Gulf of California, from Baja California Sur (El Vizcaíno Biosphere Reserve in central and Pacific west coast, Central Gulf Coast subregion on east to southern tip), north through much of Baja California, excluding the central northwest mountains and Pacific west coast, through southeastern California and southwestern and southern Arizona to western and central parts of Sonora.

It is bounded on the west by the Peninsular Ranges, which separate it from the California chaparral and woodlands (northwest) and Baja California desert (Vizcaíno subregion, central and southeast) ecoregions of the Pacific slope. The Gulf of California xeric scrub ecoregion lies south of the Sonoran desert on the Gulf of California slope of the Baja California Peninsula.

To the north in California and northwest Arizona, the Sonoran Desert transitions to the colder-winter, higher-elevation Mojave, Great Basin, and Colorado Plateau deserts.

The coniferous Arizona Mountains forests are to the northeast. The Chihuahuan Desert and Sierra Madre Occidental pine–oak forests are at higher elevations to the east. To the south the Sonoran–Sinaloan transition subtropical dry forest is the transition zone from the Sonoran Desert to the tropical dry forests of the Mexican state of Sinaloa.

===Sub-regions===
The desert&#x27;s sub-regions include the Colorado Desert of southeastern California; and the Yuma Desert east of the north-to-south section of the Colorado River in southwest Arizona. In the 1957 publication &quot;Vegetation of the Sonoran Desert&quot;, Forrest Shreve divided the Sonoran Desert into seven regions according to characteristic vegetation: Lower Colorado Valley, Arizona Upland, Plains of Sonora, Foothills of Sonora, Central Gulf Coast, Vizcaíno Region, and Magdalena Region. Many ecologists consider Shreve&#x27;s Vizcaíno and Magdalena regions, which lie on the western side of the Baja California Peninsula, to be a separate ecoregion, the Baja California desert.

Within the southern Sonoran Desert in Mexico is found the Gran Desierto de Altar, with the El Pinacate y Gran Desierto de Altar Biosphere Reserve, encompassing of desert and mountainous regions. The biosphere reserve includes the only active erg dune region in North America. The nearest city to the biosphere reserve is Puerto Peñasco (&#x27;Rocky Point&#x27;) in the state of Sonora.

;Sub-regions
Sonoran Desert sub-regions include:
* Colorado Desert
* Gran Desierto de Altar
* Lechuguilla Desert
* Tonopah Desert
* Yuha Desert
* Yuma Desert

==Climate==
The Sonoran desert has an arid subtropical climate and is considered to be the most tropical desert in North America. In the lower-elevation portions of the desert, temperatures are warm year-round, and rainfall is infrequent and irregular, often less than 90 mm (approx. 3.5&quot;) annually. The Arizona uplands are also warm year-round, but they receive 100–300 mm (approx. 4–12&quot;) of average annual rainfall, which falls in a more regular bi-seasonal pattern.

According to the Köppen climate classification system, the majority of the Sonoran Desert has a hot desert climate (&quot;BWh&quot;). Hot semi-arid climate (&quot;BSh&quot;) exists on some of the higher elevation mountains within the desert, as well as in a continuous swath on the eastern and northeastern fringes as elevations gradually rise toward the Madrean Sky Islands in the east and the Mogollon Rim in the northeast. There are also a few small areas of cold semi-arid climate (&quot;BSk&quot;) and even hot-summer Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csa&quot;) on only the highest mountain peaks within the region.

==Flora==

Many plants not only survive, but thrive in the harsh conditions of the Sonoran Desert. Many have evolved specialized adaptations to the desert climate. The Sonoran Desert&#x27;s bi-seasonal rainfall pattern results in more plant species than any other desert in the world. The Sonoran Desert includes plant genera and species from the agave family, palm family, cactus family, legume family, and numerous others. Many of these adaptations occur in food crops. Mission Garden is a living agricultural museum that showcases foods that have been grown in the Sonoran Desert for over 4000 years.

The Sonoran is the only place in the world where the famous saguaro cactus (&quot;Carnegiea gigantea&quot;) grows in the wild. Cholla (&quot;Cylindropuntia&quot; spp.), beavertail (&quot;Opuntia basilaris&quot;), hedgehog (&quot;Echinocereus&quot; spp.), fishhook (&quot;Ferocactus wislizeni&quot;), prickly pear (&quot;Opuntia&quot; spp.), nightblooming cereus (&quot;Peniocereus&quot; spp.), and organ pipe (&quot;Stenocereus thurberi&quot;) are other taxa of cacti found here. Cacti provide food and homes to many desert mammals and birds, with showy flowers in reds, pinks, yellows, and whites, blooming most commonly from late March through June, depending on the species and seasonal temperatures.

Creosote bush (&quot;Larrea tridentata&quot;) and bur sage (&quot;Ambrosia dumosa&quot;) dominate valley floors. Indigo bush (&quot;Psorothamnus fremontii&quot;) and Mormon tea are other shrubs that may be found. Wildflowers of the Sonoran Desert include desert sand verbena (&quot;Abronia villosa&quot;), desert sunflower (&quot;Geraea canescens&quot;), and evening primroses.
Ascending from the valley up bajadas, various subtrees such as velvet mesquite (&quot;Prosopis velutina&quot;), palo verde (&quot;Parkinsonia florida&quot;), desert ironwood (&quot;Olneya tesota&quot;), desert willow (&quot;Chilopsis linearis&quot; ssp. &quot;arcuata&quot;), and crucifixion thorn (&quot;Canotia holacantha&quot;) are common, as well as multi-stemmed ocotillo (&quot;Fouquieria splendens&quot;). Shrubs found at higher elevations include whitethorn acacia (&quot;Acacia constricta&quot;), fairy duster, and jojoba. In the desert subdivisions found on Baja California, cardon cactus, elephant tree, and boojum tree occur.
The California fan palm (&quot;Washingtonia filifera&quot;) is found in the Colorado Desert section of the Sonoran Desert, the only native palm in California, among many other introduced Arecaceae genera and species. It is found at spring-fed oases, such as in Anza Borrego Desert State Park, Joshua Tree National Park, and the Kofa National Wildlife Refuge.

==Fauna==

The Sonoran Desert is home to a wide variety of fauna that have adapted and thrive in the hot, arid desert environment, such as the Gila monster, bobcat, mule deer, antelope jackrabbit, burrowing owl, greater roadrunner, western diamondback rattlesnake, and elf owl. There are 350 bird species, 20 amphibian species, over 100 reptile species, 30 native fish species, and over 1000 native bee species found in the Sonoran. The Sonoran Desert area southeast of Tucson and near the Mexican border is vital habitat for the only population of jaguars living within the United States. The Colorado River Delta was once an ecological hotspot within the Sonoran desert due to the Colorado river in this otherwise dry area, but the delta has been greatly reduced in extent due to damming and use of the river upstream. Species that have higher heat tolerance are able to thrive in the conditions of the Sonoran Desert. One such insect species that has evolved a means to thrive in this environment is &quot;Drosophila mettleri&quot;, a Sonoran Desert fly. This fly contains a specialized P450 detoxification system that enables it to nest in the cool region of exudate moistened soil. Thus, the fly is one of few that can tolerate the high desert temperatures and successfully reproduce.

== Human population ==
The Sonoran Desert is home to the cultures of over 17 contemporary Native American tribes, with settlements at American Indian reservations in California and Arizona, as well as populations in Mexico.

The largest city in the Sonoran Desert is Phoenix, Arizona, with a 2017 metropolitan population of about 4.7 million. Located on the Salt River in central Arizona, it is one of the fastest-growing metropolitan areas in the United States. In 2007 in the Phoenix area, desert was losing ground to urban sprawl at a rate of approximately per hour.

The next largest cities are Tucson, in southern Arizona, with a metro area population of just over 1 million, and Mexicali, Baja California, with a similarly sized metropolitan population of around 1,000,000. The metropolitan area of Hermosillo, Sonora, has a population close to 900,000. Ciudad Obregón, Sonora, in the southern part of the desert, has a population of 375,800.

===California===
The Coachella Valley, located in the Colorado Desert section of the Sonoran Desert, has a population of 365,000. Several famous Southern California desert resort cities such as Palm Springs and Palm Desert are located here.
During the winter months, from November to April, the daytime temperatures in the Coachella Valley range from 70 °F (21 °C) to 90 °F (32 °C) and corresponding nighttime lows range from 46 °F (8 °C) to 68 °F (20 °C) making it a popular winter resort destination. Due to its warm year-round climate citrus and subtropical fruits such as mangoes, figs, and dates are grown in the Coachella Valley and adjacent Imperial Valley. The Imperial Valley has a total population of over 180,000 and has a similar climate to that of the Coachella Valley. Other cities include Borrego Springs, Indio, Coachella, Calexico, El Centro, Imperial, and Blythe.

===United States–Mexico border region===

Straddling the Mexico–United States border, the Sonoran desert is an important migration corridor for humans and animals. The harsh climate conditions and border militarism mean that the journey can be perilous, usually moving at night to minimize exposure to the heat.

==Protected areas==
There are many National Parks and Monuments; federal and state nature reserves and wildlife refuges; state, county, and city parks; and government or nonprofit group operated natural history museums, science research institutes, and botanical gardens and desert landscape gardens.

<doc id="309720" wikidata="Q495530" url="?curid=309720" title="Sledd of Essex">
<text>Sledd (or Sledda) was King of Essex in the late 6th century, possibly between (?) 587 and &quot;c&quot;. 604. Extremely little is known about him.

An East-Saxon genealogy preserved as British Library Add. MS 23211, possibly of the late 9th century, makes him a son and successor of King Æscwine. The post-Conquest historians Henry of Huntingdon (&quot;Historia Anglorum&quot;), Roger of Wendover (&quot;Flores Historiarum&quot;), and Matthew Paris (&quot;Chronica Majora&quot;) substitute the name Eorcenwine (&quot;Erkenwine&quot;, &quot;Erchenwine&quot;) as his father. Though their testimony is centuries removed from Sledd&#x27;s floruit, it is thought that they drew on alternative pre-Conquest material.

Although Æscwine or Eorcenwine is sometimes credited with the foundation of the kingdom, genealogies included in the works of William of Malmesbury and John of Worcester (&quot;Chronicon&quot; B) make Sledd the first king of Essex, while the genealogies in Add. MS 23211 use Sledd as their point of convergence. This suggests that Sledd may have been regarded as the founder of the East Saxon house. On no known authority, Roger of Wendover and Matthew Paris state that Sledd directly succeeded his father on his death in 587.

Sledd married Ricula, sister of King Æthelberht of Kent. Sledd was father of Sæberht, whose rule began in &quot;c&quot;. 604, and of another son, Seaxa, whose descendants supplanted those of Sæberht in the mid-8th century. Seaxa is perhaps identical to Seaxbald, father of king Swithelm, of unknown placement within the royal family, but Yorke thinks this unlikely on chronological grounds.

<text>This is a list of English words that are thought to be commonly misused. It is meant to include only words whose &quot;misuse&quot; is deprecated by most usage writers, editors, and professional grammarians defining the norms of Standard English. It is possible that some of the meanings marked &quot;non-standard&quot; may pass into &quot;Standard&quot; English in the future, but at this time all of the following &quot;non-standard&quot; phrases are likely to be marked as &quot;incorrect&quot; by English teachers or changed by editors if used in a work submitted for publication, where adherence to the conventions of Standard English is normally expected. Some of the examples are homonyms or pairs of similarly spelled words that are often confused.

The words listed below are frequently used in ways that major English dictionaries do not condone in any definition. See List of English words with disputed usage for words that are used in ways that are by some usage writers but are condoned by some dictionaries. There may be regional variations in grammar, orthography, and word-use, especially between different English-speaking countries. Such differences are not classified normatively as non-standard or &quot;incorrect&quot; once they have gained widespread acceptance in a particular country.

** &quot;Standard&quot;: The board of directors developed an algorithm for choosing the company&#x27;s new president from among the remaining candidates.

Such phraseology is awkward and should usually be rewritten, but not always.

<doc id="309729" wikidata="Q747417" url="?curid=309729" title="Wolf's Rain">
<text>Wolf&#x27;s Rain (stylized in all caps) is a Japanese anime television series created by writer Keiko Nobumoto and produced by Bones. It was directed by Tensai Okamura and featured character designs by Toshihiro Kawamoto with a soundtrack produced and arranged by Yoko Kanno. It focuses on the journey of four lone wolves who cross paths while following the scent of the Lunar Flower and seeking Paradise.

&quot;Wolf&#x27;s Rain&quot; spans twenty-six television episodes and four original video animation (OVA) episodes, with each episode running approximately twenty-three minutes. The series was originally broadcast in Japan on Fuji TV, some of Fuji TV&#x27;s affiliate stations, and the anime CS television network, Animax. The complete thirty episode series is licensed for a North American release by Funimation, in Europe by Beez Entertainment and in Australia and New Zealand by Madman Entertainment. The series was adapted into a short two-volume manga series written by Keiko Nobumoto and illustrated by Toshitsugu Iida. The manga, which was released while the series was airing, is a retelling of the story rather than a straight adaptation. It was originally serialized in &quot;Magazine Z&quot; and has been released in North America by Viz Media.

The anime series was well received in Japan, being the third-ranked anime series in its timeslot while airing on Fuji TV. The Bandai Entertainment English-language release sold well in North America. It helped Bandai gain the 2004 Anime Company of the Year award from industry news company ICv2 in the ICv2 Retailers Guide to Anime/Manga. The manga adaptation was selected as one of their top ten anime products of 2005 and sold well in North America. Reviewers of the series gave it high marks for characterization, emotional weight, visual presentation, narrative and its soundtrack, while disparaging the existence of four recapitulation episodes in the middle of the series. The manga adaptation also sold well in North America and received good reviews, though reviewers felt its short length resulted in a rushed plot and neglected supporting characters.

==Plot==
According to an old legend, when the end of the world comes, a place known as Paradise will appear. However, only wolves will know how to find it. Although wolves are believed to have been hunted to extinction nearly two hundred years ago, they still exist, surviving by casting illusions over themselves to make them appear human. Freeze City is a northern human city set in Russia, in a world where the majority of people live in poverty and hardship.

Kiba, an injured lone white wolf, goes to Freeze City following the scent of the Lunar Flower, which is the key to opening Paradise. There he encounters Tsume, Hige and Toboe, three other wolves who were drawn to Freeze City by the scent of the Lunar Flower and are now living in the city. The wolves encounter Quent Yaiden, a former Sheriff of Kyrios who is obsessed with hunting down wolves, and his dog Blue. Cheza, the Flower Maiden who is destined to lead the wolves to Paradise, is being studied at a laboratory under the care of Cher Degré. She is awakened by the smell of the wolf&#x27;s blood. As Kiba and Hige approach the lab to find her, she is stolen away by Lord Darcia the Third, whose people created Cheza.

With the Flower Maiden gone, the wolves have no reason to stay in the city. Despite some initial misgivings and suspicions, they decide to stay together and follow Kiba in his search for the Flower Maiden and Paradise. As they pursue Cheza, the wolves travel through various cities and the remnants of former habitations. Cher joins the city&#x27;s army to try to recover Cheza, while Cher&#x27;s ex-husband Hubb Lebowski searches desperately for Cher, and Quent continues his relentless pursuit of the wolves. When Blue eventually encounters Cheza, it awakens her wolf blood from dormancy and causes her to leave Quent and take on her human form. She joins the wolves and travels with them for a while, developing an intense and close romantic relationship with Hige, and meanwhile, Hubb finds himself traveling with Quent, who is now searching for Blue as well as the wolves. Hubb eventually finds Cher and from there they continue their pursuit of the wolves to find Cheza.

Together the wolves reach Darcia&#x27;s keep after Kiba goes off on his own. Hubb, Cher, and Quent arrive in the keep, and Tsume, Toboe, and Hige find Kiba, Cheza, and Darcia during a sword fight between Darcia and Kiba. However, the reunion is short-lived when the Noble Jaguara troops attack, destroying the keep in the process. The troops capture Cheza, Hubb, Cher, and Blue during the raid, and the wolves get separated from Kiba. After finding Kiba, the wolves continue their journey to rescue Cheza from Jaguara, while Cher rescues Blue and manages to find Cheza with help from Hubb, but Jaguara&#x27;s troops instantly recapture Cheza, taking Hubb with them and forcing Cher and Blue to find Cheza on their own.

The wolves and the humans eventually come together in Jaguara&#x27;s city, where the captured Cheza is being held. In attempting to rescue the abducted Cheza, Kiba, Tsume, and Toboe are captured. Tsume and Toboe are thrown into a dungeon with Hubb while Jaguara attempts to use Kiba&#x27;s blood to force Paradise to open. Meanwhile, Hige and Blue are reunited outside the Keep, where he remembers that he had once worked for Jaguara and decides to rescue his friends, but not before telling Blue to stay outside and promising her that he will return to her no matter what. While waiting for Hige, Blue is reunited with her master Quent and meanwhile, Darcia, having survived the attack on his keep, interrupts Jaguara&#x27;s ceremony as Kiba and the other wolves break free and rush to free the Flower Maiden. Hige is wounded during the fight against Jaguara and Kiba arrives after Darcia is poisoned by the Noble. Darcia battles Jaguara along with Kiba and finally slays her as the keep begins to collapse, ending the anime&#x27;s original 26-episode run.

As the original video animation (OVA) episodes begin, the wolves and the humans escape Jaguara&#x27;s city, which has fallen into chaos. Quent is gravely wounded saving Blue from an oncoming vehicle, but he and Blue are found by Hubb and Cher, and subsequently by the wolves and Cheza. Together, they all continue making their way to Paradise, pursued by the now insane Darcia. As the Earth begins to fall into destruction, Cher dies when the car falls off a cliff. Soon after, Toboe is accidentally shot by Quent when he tries to shoot Darcia who in turn kills Quent. Hubb tries to keep up with the remaining wolves climbing up a mountain but falls to his death. Darcia attacks the remaining wolves killing Hige, Blue, and Tsume, leaving only Kiba, Cheza, and Darcia alive at the place where Paradise can be opened. Darcia and Kiba battle over who will open Paradise and Kiba is fatally wounded. Darcia dies when he attempts to enter Paradise due to not being a true wolf. Kiba finds Cheza as she dies and disintegrates into seeds. Dying, Kiba concludes that his quest has failed, but rain begins to fall and Cheza&#x27;s seeds grow into thousands of lunar flowers. As he dies, Kiba falls into the water&#x27;s depths but sees the blood-red moon turning back to its normal color. Cheza&#x27;s death causes Paradise, as well as the world, to be reborn. However, Darcia&#x27;s corruption can be seen taking root in this new Paradise. The final scenes take place in what appears to be a 21st-century Japanese city. Kiba, apparently reincarnated as a human, passes reincarnated Tsume, Hige, and Toboe (apparently no memories of past life and it is unknown if the cat with blue eyes is Blue); a lunar flower is blooming in an alleyway.

===Changes in the manga adaptation===
The two-volume manga adaptation includes some of the core events of the anime series with few changes, but as a whole the manga veers greatly from its anime inspiration. Many events from the anime do not occur in the manga, and some of the events from the anime that are presented in the manga are completely different in terms of dialogue, chronological sequence, and outcomes. In particular, the second volume tells an almost completely different story, with Darcia recruiting Blue to help him open the door to Paradise with her blood. The wolves must go to Darcia&#x27;s keep, rather than Jaguara&#x27;s, to free Cheza, with Kiba missing but appearing at the end to make the final rescue effort. At the end of the manga, the four wolves and Cheza are sitting on a rock as the clouds break and sunlight streams through for the first time. The world rejoices at the end of the Ice Age and rumors that Paradise has been found abound.

In the manga, most of the characters are similar in appearance and personality to their anime counterparts, but some characters seen in the anime do not appear in the manga, including the Noble Lord Orkham.

==Principal characters==
* is a white wolf who is dedicated solely to finding the Lunar Flower and opening the way to Paradise. He does what he can as much possible to protect Cheza with his life. Kiba primarily acts on his instincts, which sometimes lead him to behave rashly, this shows the dogmatic changes through a wolf&#x27;s position in a human mindset or a wolf mindset, and this causes the other characters to call him idealistic. Full of wolf pride, Kiba initially expresses disgust at wolves who use human disguises, but eventually realizes that it is necessary to survive. Voiced by: Mamoru Miyano (Japanese); Johnny Yong Bosch (English, Bandai Visual dub), Darren Pleavin (English, Animax Asia dub)
* is a gray wolf with a large, X-shaped scar across his chest, among many others. Rough and self-reliant, Tsume is a strong fighter who keeps his true feelings to himself. He joins the others after his human gang in Freeze City betrays him. He does not initially believe in Paradise, but eventually starts to believe in their goal after seeing the great sacrifices his new pack was doing in order to open Paradise. Though he frequently quarrels with Kiba over their journey, he eventually accepts his leadership and comes to trust in him, also growing protective of Toboe and eventually forming a brotherly relationship with him. Voiced by: Kenta Miyake (Japanese); Crispin Freeman (English, Bandai Visual dub), Victor Lee (English, Animax Asia dub)
* is a brown wolf with a carefree attitude, who seems quite comfortable living in human society. Hige likes to converse with girls and to eat, and due to the latter he is quite chubby. After meeting Kiba, he goes along with the idea of searching for Paradise without much argument. Hige wears a collar around his neck, that seems to attract soldiers of a Noble, Lady Jaguara, leading him to put his wolf crew in danger and himself in pain. Voiced by: Akio Suyama (Japanese); Joshua Seth (English, Bandai Visual dub)
* is a red/brown wolf and the youngest of the group. He is considered the pup or the runt by the others, but after he desperately fights a huge walrus during the journey to rescue Cheza from Jaguara, the other wolves change their mind about him. He was raised by an old woman who found him outside the city, and still wears the bracelets she gave him. Due to his upbringing, Toboe is friendly and protective towards most humans. He forms a brotherly relationship with Tsume. Voiced by: Hiroki Shimowada (Japanese); Mona Marshall (English, Bandai Visual dub), Candice Moore (English, Animax Asia dub)
* is also called the &quot;Flower Maiden&quot;. The wolves need Cheza to find and open the gateway to Paradise. She was created via alchemy from a Lunar Flower, and as such needs water and sunlight to survive. Originally asleep and under study in a lab in Freeze City, Cheza is eventually able to join the wolves, whom she loves, and travels with them. She refers to herself in the third person, usually adapted to &quot;this one&quot;. The spilling of wolf blood makes Cheza scream, and she has the ability to heal them or put them to sleep through her song and touch. Voiced by: Arisa Ogasawara (Japanese); Sherry Lynn (English, Bandai Visual dub), Andrea Kwan (English, Animax Asia dub)
* is a blue wolf/dog hybrid. At first, she travels along with Quent Yaiden, hunting wolves. But after Blue finds out that she is actually half-wolf, and unwilling to hunt her own kind, Blue leaves Quent to join the wolves, eventually falling in love with Hige. She is strong, fearless and independent. Voiced by: Mayumi Asano (Japanese); Jessica Strauss (English, Bandai Visual dub), Sarah Hauser (English, Animax Asia dub)

==Production==
The series was created primarily by Keiko Nobumoto with director Tensai Okamura claiming he was not sure if they had a very full communication. When Nobumoto created the series, she was sort of intrigued by the two different aspects of wolves. Being noble, the dignified existence of wolves in folklore and the violent character of real wolves, and how becomes a conflicting characterization. Okamura was not sure that he understood Nobumoto&#x27;s intention. The male human pursuers, Hubb and Quent, helped the director get a greater understanding of their story.

===Release===

The &quot;Wolf&#x27;s Rain&quot; anime series was produced by studio Bones and directed by Tensai Okamura. Keiko Nobumoto was the writer and story editor, while Toshihiro Kawamoto created the character designs. The series premiered in Japan on Fuji TV on January 6, 2003, and ran for a full season of twenty-six episodes, with the final episode airing on July 29, 2003. A four-episode original video animation (OVA) was later created and released to DVD to provide a fuller conclusion to the story than the original television run did, and to make up for the four recap episodes that were originally broadcast in the middle of the series. The first two OVA episodes were released on January 23, 2004, with the final two released a month later on February 25, 2004. Animax also aired the series on its respective networks worldwide, including East Asia, Southeast Asia, South Asia, Latin America, Europe, and other regions.

Except for the four recap episodes, the entire &quot;Wolf&#x27;s Rain&quot; anime series aired in the United States as part of Cartoon Network&#x27;s Adult Swim lineup in 2004. It was broadcast on Europe&#x27;s digital specialty station Rapture TV from November 14, 2005, to July 6, 2006. It also aired in the UK on Anime Central starting November 4, 2007, with only the first 26 episodes airing.

&quot;Wolf&#x27;s Rain&quot; was licensed for Region 1 DVD release by Bandai Entertainment. The entire series, including the four OVAs, were released in seven individual volumes that contained four episodes, except for the first two volumes, which had five episodes. With the first volume, Bandai offered a stand-alone version and a limited edition version, which included an art box, Kiba plushie, and the first CD soundtrack. Bandai also released the thirty episodes in a complete series box set and in a two-part &quot;Anime Legends&quot; collection. Funimation has since licensed the series following the closure of Bandai Entertainment and released the series on a Blu-ray and DVD combo pack on February 7, 2017.

In Region 2 (Europe) the series is licensed by Beez Entertainment, which also released the entire series, including the OVAs, in seven individual volumes, and later as a box set which also included the first soundtrack CD (see below). In Region 4, Madman Entertainment owns the series license and released all twenty-six episodes and four OVA episodes in the form of a complete series box set.

===Soundtrack===
All of the music for the &quot;Wolf&#x27;s Rain&quot; soundtrack was composed and arranged by Yoko Kanno. The vocal songs are performed by various artists, including Maaya Sakamoto, Raj Ramayya, Ilaria Graziano, Steve Conte and Joyce, and they were recorded around the world, including Japan, Poland, Brazil, the United States, and Italy to offer a diverse range of music and give the soundtrack an international flavor. Two CD soundtracks, produced by Yoko Kanno, Toshiaki Ota, and Shiro Sasaki, were released in Japan by Victor Entertainment.

&quot;Gravity&quot;, the series&#x27; ending theme, is a song performed by Maaya Sakamoto. It was released as a single on February 21, 2003.

&quot;Wolf&#x27;s Rain Original Soundtrack, Volume 1&quot; was released March 29, 2003. It contains twenty-one tracks, including the opening and closing themes throughout most of the main series &quot;Stray&quot; and &quot;Gravity&quot; and many of the background sounds used during key points in the main series. The soundtrack was released in the United States by Bandai Entertainment on May 11, 2004, under the title of &quot;Wolf&#x27;s Rain Original Soundtrack.&quot;

&quot;Wolf&#x27;s Rain Original Soundtrack, Volume 2&quot; was released on January 21, 2004. It contains an additional 23 tracks, including the closing theme for the final episode of the main series &quot;Tell Me What the Rain Knows&quot;, sung by Maaya Sakamoto and with lyrics by Chris Mosdell. It also includes background music from the final episode not included in the broadcast version, and music from the four OVA episodes. The second CD has not been licensed for release outside Japan.

==Manga==
The two-volume manga series was originally serialized in &quot;Magazine Z&quot;, a monthly &quot;seinen&quot; magazine, with the first chapter premiering in April 2003. The manga, which was written by Nobumoto and illustrated by Toshitsugu Iida, is an almost complete retelling of the anime story. Each chapter of the manga series is called a &quot;grope&quot;, which is a reference to a Japanese phrase for arriving somewhere after enduring hardships.

The two volumes were released in North America by VIZ Media as individual volumes in 2004 and 2005. An exclusive edition of the first volume was released on November 5, 2004, in Borders and Waldenbooks stores that included a collectible box to hold both volumes and a 3D lenticular card. The Viz English release is adapted by David Ury, who also acted as translator and Egan Loo. The series has also been released in German by Heyne, in Italian by Shin Vision and in Polish by Japonica Polonica Fantastica.


==Reception==
In Japan, &quot;Wolf&#x27;s Rain&quot; ranked third among anime series airing in the same time slot behind &quot;Air Master&quot; and &quot;Dear Boys&quot;. The series was considered &quot;a big hit in 2004&quot; for the North American market, selling well in mass markets as well as in online markets and at independent retailers. ICv2 notes that it has &quot;a strong appeal to the growing teen and older anime audience.&quot; The series was selected as one of the top ten anime properties of 2005 for the ICv2 Retailers Guide to Anime/Manga. Its release was also a central reason Bandai Entertainment earned the ICv2 Anime Company of the Year award for 2004.

Tasha Robinson of &quot;SciFi Weekly&quot; praised the series for its unusual focus on non-human characters and the interesting dynamic of wolves behaving like wolves as they interact with the human characters and environments in the series. Carlo Santos of Anime News Network praised the visuals of the series, noting that they &quot;showcase Studio BONES at their most imaginative, with beautiful backgrounds that depict settings from high-tech mysticism to urban decay to open wilderness. The character designs are equally striking: in their human form, the wolves wear contemporary outfits, making them the most accessible of all characters.&quot; Both Santos and Chris Beveridge of Mania.com noted that the Region 1 DVD volume containing the four recapitulation episodes should be left unbought and skipped as a waste of money; however, they praised Bandai&#x27;s release of the episodes for putting the episodes on a single volume, unlike in the Japanese release where they were spread over two DVDs requiring them to be bought to get the new episodes on the same volumes. Other critics have complained that while the show had an original and innovative storyline with beautiful visuals and appealing characters, the episodes themselves were poorly paced, undeveloped, and plagued with plot holes.

In &quot;The Anime Encyclopedia&quot;, Jonathan Clements and Helen McCarthy criticized the production delays and the hiatuses that led to the creation of the four recap episodes, stating that &quot;if the makers had spent less time recounting the story so far, they might have had more than enough space to finish the entire run within the requisite 26 episodes&quot;. They praised the series&#x27; soundtrack, feeling it supported &quot;the atmosphere and character development&quot;, and felt the &quot;moody, dark, and understated&quot; art was attractive.

Yoko Kanno&#x27;s soundtrack for the series has also been hailed for its beauty and the way it adds to the series&#x27; emotional impact. The instrumental tracks were found to mirror the show&#x27;s tone perfectly, evoking feelings of sorrow and loss. According to one reviewer, the soundtrack &quot;...shows [Kanno&#x27;s] skills as both composer and pianist...&quot; and is &quot;...a treat to hear.&quot; Kanno&#x27;s work in the series was nominated for an Annie Award in the &quot;Music in an Animated Television Production&quot; category in 2006.

The &quot;Wolf&#x27;s Rain&quot; manga adaptation has also enjoyed success in the North American market, with the second volume being the ninth best-selling graphic novel on the Nielsen BookScan list for February 13, 2007. It was considered a &quot;major manga hit&quot; among manga series adapted from an anime series. Anime News Network&#x27;s Liann Cooper praised its artwork, but also felt its short length and rushed storyline made it hard to connect to the characters. He also felt the supporting characters, Cher, Hubb and Quent, were only included &quot;just to have them included&quot;. Carlo Santos, also of Anime News Network, praised the &quot;snappy pacing&quot; while also considering it the primary downfall of the series. In reviewing the series for &quot;&quot;, Rebecca Brown felt the series was a &quot;transparent grab for cash&quot; and criticized its extreme brevity and the art, which she felt was &quot;barely adequate and at times not even that.&quot;

<doc id="309733" wikidata="Q1061221" url="?curid=309733" title="Sagami Bay">
<text>lies south of Kanagawa Prefecture in Honshu, central Japan, contained within the scope of the Miura Peninsula, in Kanagawa, to the east, the Izu Peninsula, in Shizuoka Prefecture, to the west, and the Shōnan coastline to the north, while the island of Izu Ōshima marks the southern extent of the bay. It lies approximately southwest of the capital, Tokyo. Cities on the bay include Odawara, Chigasaki, Fujisawa, Hiratsuka, Itō, and Kamakura.

== History ==
The center of the Great Kantō earthquake in 1923 was deep beneath Izu Ōshima Island in Sagami Bay. It devastated Tokyo, the port city of Yokohama, and the surrounding prefectures of Chiba, Kanagawa, and Shizuoka, and caused widespread damage throughout the Kantō region. The shallow nature of the seabed on the north of the bay, and the funnelling effect of tsunami and typhoon wave energy, contributed to certain parts of the Shonan coast having suffered considerable damage, including the destruction of the Kōtoku-in temple housing the Great Buddha, or Daibutsu during the massive tsunami of 1498.

== Natural environment ==
A branch of the warm Kuroshio Current warms the bay, allowing it to host marine organisms typical of more southerly regions and giving a mild climate to the land bordering it. The maximum depth of Sagami Bay is about 1500 meters.

Organisms from sub-arctic regions are advected into the bay by intrusions of the Oyashio Current resulting in very high biodiversity. It is the major study site for research programs at the University of Tokyo (ORI) and the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC).

In 2004, soil samples from Sagami Bay were found to contain radioactive contamination from the Bikini Atoll nuclear tests that took place from 1946 to 1958.

The Hikiji River, Sagami River and Sakai River flow into the bay.

<text>The Hong Kong dollar (, sign: HK$; code: HKD) is the official currency of Hong Kong. It is divided into 100 cents. Historically, it was also divided into 1000 mils. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is the monetary authority of Hong Kong and the Hong Kong dollar.

Three commercial banks are licensed by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority to issue their own banknotes for general circulation in Hong Kong. These banks, HSBC, Bank of China, and Standard Chartered, issue their own designs of banknotes in denominations of HK$20, HK$50, HK$100, HK$150, HK$500, and HK$1000, with all designs being similar to one another in the same denomination of banknote. However, the HK$10 banknote and all coins are issued by the Government of Hong Kong.

 the Hong Kong dollar was the ninth-. Hong Kong uses a linked exchange rate system, trading since May 2005 in the range US$1:HK$7.75–7.85.

Apart from its use in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong dollar is also used in neighbouring Macau. It is pegged at 1 Hong Kong dollar to 1.03 Macanese patacas, and is generally accepted at par or MOP 1.00 for retail purchases.

==History==

When Hong Kong was established as a free trading port in 1841, there was no local currency in everyday circulation. Foreign currencies such as Indian rupees, Spanish or Mexican 8 reales, and Chinese cash coins circulated. Since 1825, it had been the policy of the British government to introduce sterling silver coinage to all of its colonies, and to this end, in 1845, the Spanish or Mexican 8 reales coins were set at a legal tender value of 4 shillings, 2 pence sterling (50 pre-decimal pence). But just as in the case of the British North American colonies, the attempts to introduce the sterling coinage failed to overcome the strong local adherence to the silver Spanish dollar system that had been in wide circulation across the Far East, emanating for centuries from Manila in the Philippines as part of the Spanish East Indies in the Spanish colonial empire through the Manila-Acapulco Galleon Trade with the coins minted in the Spanish Americas in Mexico or Peru or Bolivia.

By 1858, the British government gave up all attempts to influence the currency situation in Canada, and by the 1860s, it came to the same realisation in Hong Kong: that there was no point in trying to displace an already existing currency system. In 1863, the Royal Mint in London began issuing special subsidiary coinage for use in Hong Kong within the dollar system, though other national currencies circulated unofficially for years afterwards. In 1866, a local mint was established at Cleveland Street in Causeway Bay on Hong Kong Island for the purpose of minting Hong Kong silver dollar and half dollar coins of the same value and similar likeness to their Spanish/Mexican counterparts. The Chinese did not however receive these new Hong Kong dollars well, and in 1868, the Hong Kong Mint was closed down with a loss of $440,000. The machinery at the Hong Kong mint was sold first to Jardine Matheson and, in turn, to the Japanese and used to make the first Yen coins in 1870. In the 1860s, banknotes of the new British colonial banks, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation and the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China, denominated in dollars, also began to circulate in both Hong Kong and the wider region.

In 1873, the international silver crisis resulted in a devaluation of silver against gold-based currencies. Since the silver dollars in the US and Canada were attached to a gold exchange standard, this meant that the silver dollars circulating along the China coast dropped in value as compared to the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar.

===Early 20th century===

By 1895, the circumstances had changed to the extent that there was now a dearth of Spanish/Mexican dollars and the authorities in both Hong Kong and the Straits Settlements were putting pressure on the authorities in London to take measures to have a regular supply of silver dollar coins. London eventually acquiesced and legislation was enacted in attempts to regulate the coinage. New British trade dollars were coined at the mints in Calcutta and Bombay for use in both Hong Kong and the Straits Settlements. In 1906, the Straits Settlements issued their own silver dollar coin and attached it to a gold sterling exchange standard at a fixed value of 2 shillings and 4 pence. This was the point of departure as between the Hong Kong unit and the Straits unit.

In British Weihaiwei, the Hong Kong dollar circulated jointly with the Chinese yuan from 1914 to 1930, when Weihaiwei was returned to the Republic of China.

By 1935, only Hong Kong and China remained on the silver standard. In that year, Hong Kong, shortly after China, abandoned silver and introduced a crawling peg to sterling of £1 = HK$15.36 to HK$16.45. It was from this point in time that the concept of a Hong Kong dollar as a distinct unit of currency came into existence. The One-Dollar Currency Note Ordinance of that year led to the introduction of one-dollar notes by the government and the government acknowledged the Hong Kong dollar as the local monetary unit. It was not until 1937 that the legal tender of Hong Kong was finally unified. In 1939, the Hong Kong dollar was put on a fixed peg of HK$16 = £1 ($1 = 1s 3d).

The discussion about switching from the silver standard to the gold standard began as early as 1930. A commission report was released in May 1931. It concluded that it was important for Hong Kong to facilitate free flow of capital with China and the same monetary standard was thus preferred. The report also recommended the Hong Kong Government only to take over the burden of note issuance when the banks failed to do so. Actually, the Hong Kong Government was not willing to take up the logistics of note issuance, and some officials even thought that the public had greater degree of confidence in the notes issued by those long-established banks than that by the government.

During the Japanese occupation, the Japanese military yen were the only means of everyday exchange in Hong Kong. When the yen was first introduced on 26 December 1941, the exchange rate was ¥1 yen = HK$2. However, in August 1942, the rate was changed to HK$4 to ¥1 yen. The yen became the only legal tender on 1 June 1943. The issue of local currency was resumed by the Hong Kong government and the authorised local banks after liberation, with the pre-war rate of HK$16 = £1 being restored. The yen was exchanged at a rate of ¥100 = HK$1. On 6 September 1945, all military yen notes used in Japanese colonies were declared void by the Japanese Ministry of Finance.

===Post-WWII period===

====The Hong Kong dollar in the sterling area====

After the end of the Second World War, the Hong Kong dollar was re-pegged to sterling at a fixed rate identical to the pre-war level. Meanwhile, the United Kingdom made efforts in maintaining the sterling area with countries of the British Commonwealth as well as its colonies. It imposed exchange controls on non-sterling area countries, barring them from freely converting British pounds into US dollars, but no such restriction was placed on sterling area countries. As a colony of the British Empire, Hong Kong was obliged to observe the sterling area regulations. Nevertheless, its unique geo-economic position afforded Hong Kong the ability to defy exchange controls by operating a dual system with the sterling area and a free exchange market principally with the US dollar, which was technically illegal from 1949 to 1967. Hong Kong economy specialist Leo Goodstadt argues that ministers and officials in London were bound to tolerate Hong Kong&#x27;s situation, given Hong Kong&#x27;s extensive trade with PRC, and the long collusion between officials in Hong Kong, bankers and local business communities. The People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) established by the Chinese Communist Party in 1949 was in dire need for foreign currency, especially after the Korean War (1950–1953) and the Sino-Soviet split in the early 1960s for international trade with countries of non-Soviet bloc. The British sterling obtained through Hong Kong was able to finance 28% and 46% of PRC&#x27;s total import from 1963 to 1967 and from 1970 to 1971 respectively. Of the British sterling obtained by PRC through Hong Kong during 1953 and 1971, about 40–50% was supplied by The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC), the de facto &quot;central bank&quot; in Hong Kong, which accounted for 10% of annual foreign currency needed by PRC in the period.

==== The impacts of the devaluation of the pound in 1967====

In the 1960s, the UK found it difficult to keep the value of sterling as it was, with its role as official reserve currency even within the sterling area. In 1964, sterling was 83% of the official reserves of overseas sterling area countries, but this share had decreased to 75% in 1966 and to 65% in 1967. When sterling was devalued by the UK in 1967, and Hong Kong dollar&#x27;s peg to the pound resulted in a re-valuation of Hong Kong dollar from $16 to $14.5, a 10% re-valuation against the pound and 5.7% devaluation against the US dollar. The unilateral devaluation sparked a circle of grievances among local business communities as well as colonial officials in Hong Kong because the official reserves and private savings in sterling were substantial from Hong Kong. In the 1950–60s, Hong Kong accumulated significant reserves in sterling with its economic growth, money supply was exponentially expanded from £140–£160 million in the late 1950s to £363 million in October 1967, equivalent to 10% of the UK&#x27;s total sterling liabilities to the overseas sterling area before the devaluation. Subsequently, Hong Kong and London engaged in talks about compensation and protection against further losses. Considering the potential diversification of official reserves from sterling to the US dollars by the Hong Kong government officials, London agreed to offer exchange guarantees to protect Hong Kong against potential devaluation of sterling in the future, which was the first to receive such guarantees among the sterling area countries.

====Floating currency system, 1974–1983====

After the US&#x27;s cessation of the convertibility between gold and the U.S. dollar in October 1971, Britain abandoned the fixed exchange rate with the U.S. dollar and extended the exchange controls also to the Sterling Area countries, which put an effective end to the Sterling Area in 1972. In the same year, the Hong Kong dollar was pegged to the U.S. dollar at a rate of HK$5.65 = US$1, revised to HK$5.085 = US$1 in 1973. From 1974 to 1983, the Hong Kong dollar was not anchored to another currency, changing the monetary regime from a currency board system to a floating currency system.

====Linked Exchange Rate System since 1983====

On 17 October 1983, the Hong Kong dollar was officially pegged to the U.S. dollar at a rate of HK$7.8 = US$1, officially switching back to the currency board system. The peg of Hong Kong dollar to the U.S. dollar in 1983 actually took place in the context of Sino-British negotiation regarding the future of Hong Kong after 1997. Due to the lack of public confidence in the talks, on 24 September 1983, the Hong Kong dollar was devalued by 15% over 2 days to a historical low at HK$9.6 to US$1. Public panic set in and there were runs on foodstuff on this Black Saturday (1983). Amidst the monetary crisis, John Greenwood, an economist who was later dubbed the &quot;architect of the Linked Exchange Rate System&quot; in Hong Kong, advocated the proposal to peg the Hong Kong dollar to the U.S. dollar with a return to the former currency board system. The proposal received support from two government officials within the Monetary Affairs Branch of the Hong Kong Government, namely the Deputy Secretary for Monetary Affairs Tony Latter and the Government Economist Alan McLean as a practical way to restore confidence in the Hong Kong dollar. After discussions between London and Hong Kong, the Financial Secretary of Hong Kong Government John Bremridge announced to peg the Hong Kong dollar with the U.S. dollar at a rate of HK$7.8 to US$1 in a currency board fashion on 17 October 1983.

When recalling the choice of rate, Tony Latter notes that a rate of HK$7.25 to HK$7.50 was considered a reasonable range in macroeconomic terms, given the rate against the U.S. dollar around HK$6.60 before the crisis and the rate around HK$8.30 to HK$8.80 when the government&#x27;s intention to change monetary regime was revealed in early October. In political terms, the government did not want to set the rate too weak so as to warrant international allegations of currency manipulation for competitive advantages, or too strong a rate that would result in high interest rates and the eventual abandonment of the rate. HK$7.8 was finally selected, as the government hoped to demonstrate that the situation has been properly stabilized and it was felt that the rate below HK$8.0 can achieve this purpose psychologically.

John Bremridge was once quoted saying that the rate was somewhat &quot;a number off the air&quot;, but the most important thing was the restoration of public confidence in Hong Kong dollar with the peg amidst the crisis. The solution in its current form was favored by government officials for reasons beyond monetary considerations. Financially, the currency peg was designed not to require the Bank of England to lend its reserves to maintain Hong Kong&#x27;s currency peg. Politically, the currency board system well demonstrated the autonomy London has given to Hong Kong in economic policymaking amidst British negotiation with China to grant Hong Kong&#x27;s higher autonomy after 1997. As envisioned, the currency board monetary regime continues to function with the same pegged rate beyond the handover of sovereignty of Hong Kong to China in 1997.

===Post-1997 period===

The Basic Law of Hong Kong and the Sino-British Joint Declaration provides that Hong Kong retains full autonomy with respect to currency issuance. Currency in Hong Kong is issued by the government and three local banks (HSBC, Bank of China and Standard Chartered) under the supervision of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, which was a semi-independent public body established in the early 1990s to regulate banks and manage exchange funds and serves until now as the territory&#x27;s de facto &quot;central bank&quot;. Banknotes are printed by Hong Kong Note Printing Limited. A bank can issue a Hong Kong dollar only if it has the equivalent exchange in US dollars on deposit. The currency board system ensures that Hong Kong&#x27;s entire monetary base is backed with US dollars at the linked exchange rate. The resources for the backing are kept in Hong Kong&#x27;s exchange fund, which is among the largest official reserves in the world. Hong Kong also has huge deposits of US dollars, with official foreign currency reserves of US$361 billion as of March 2016.

In a speech addressing the issue of who determines the monetary policy in Hong Kong on 13 May 2002, Tony Latter, in the position of the Deputy Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), contended that the Financial Secretary together with the HKMA in the Hong Kong SAR Government were responsible for that. He acknowledged the heavy and direct influence of the Federal Reserve of the United States on Hong Kong&#x27;s monetary policy under the currency peg, but argued that &quot;It was Hong Kong&#x27;s choice, and we do not require any permission from US to continue or discontinue it&quot;.

As of 18 May 2005, in addition to the lower guaranteed limit, a new upper guaranteed limit was set for the Hong Kong dollar at HK$7.75 to the US dollar. The lower limit has been lowered from 7.80 to 7.85 (by 100 pips per week from 23 May to 20 June 2005). The Hong Kong Monetary Authority indicated this move is to narrow the gap between the interest rates in Hong Kong and those of the United States. A further aim of allowing the Hong Kong dollar to trade in a range is to avoid the HK dollar being used as a proxy for speculative bets on a renminbi revaluation.

==Terminology==

In formal Cantonese, the or () character is used. In informal Cantonese, () is used. The use of the character () originate from the tone change of the currency denomination used in China in imperial times (), which was the chief denomination until the introduction of the yuan in the late 19th century.

The dollar is divided into 100 cents, with the character (, a transliteration of “cent”) used on coins and in informal Cantonese. However, is now only used in the stock market, as now it no longer has a note or coin form due to its small value, and is no longer used in regular cash transactions. The amount of 10 cents is called 1 &quot;hou&quot; () in Cantonese.

To express prices in informal Cantonese, for example HK$7.80, the phrase is (); in financial terms, where integer values in cents exist, e.g., HK$6.75, the phrase is (; fives in cents is normally expressed as “half”, unless followed by another five, such as 55 cents when preceded by a dollar value); $7.08 is ().

===Slang terms===

In Hong Kong, the following are slang terms used to refer to various amounts of money:

Some of these terms are also used by overseas Chinese to refer their local currency. A slang term in English sometimes used for the Hong Kong dollar is &quot;Honkie&quot;.

==Coins==

In 1863, 1-mil (-cent), 1-cent and 10-cent coins were introduced, followed in 1866 by 5-cent and 20-cents, half-dollar and 1-dollar. The 1-mil and 1-cent were struck in bronze, with the 1 mil a holed coin. The remaining coins were struck in silver. Production of the 1-mil ended in 1866, whilst that of the half-dollar and 1-dollar ceased in 1868, with only the half-dollar (now with the denomination given as 50 cents) resuming production in 1890. Production of all silver coins was suspended in 1905, only briefly resumed in 1932 and 1933 for the production of 5-cent coins.

In 1934, the last 1-cent coins were issued, but the last minting was 1941. These were not issued because the Japanese sank a ship carrying 1-cent coins bound for Hong Kong in the Second World War. The following year (1935), cupro-nickel 5 and 10 cents were introduced, replaced by nickel in 1937 and nickel-brass between 1948 and 1949. Copper-nickel 50 cents were issued in 1951 and first bore the name &quot;fifty cents&quot; in both Chinese and English, but these were changed to nickel-brass in 1977.

In 1960, cupro-nickel 1-dollar coins were introduced, these were then reduced in size in 1978. They were followed in 1975 by nickel-brass 20 cents and cupro-nickel 2-dollar coin (both scallop shaped) and, in 1976, by decagonal, cupro-nickel 5-dollar coin, changed to a round thicker shape in 1980. The 5-cent coin was last issued in 1979, but last struck in 1988. In 1994, a bimetallic 10-dollar coin was introduced.

Starting on New Year&#x27;s Day (1 January) 1993 at stroke of midnight HKT, prior to the establishment of the HKSAR, coins with Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s portrait were gradually withdrawn from circulation. Most of the notes and coins in circulations feature Hong Kong&#x27;s &quot;Bauhinia&quot; flower or other symbols. Coins with the Queen&#x27;s portrait are still legal tender and can be seen, but these are slowly being phased out. However, most still remain in legal tender and are in circulation. Because the redesign was highly sensitive with regard to political and economic reasons, the designing process of the new coins could not be entrusted to an artist but was undertaken by Joseph Yam, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, himself who found in the Bauhinia the requested &quot;politically neutral design&quot; and did a secret &quot;scissors and paste job&quot;.

In early 1997, to commemorate Hong Kong&#x27;s transfer of sovereignty from Britain to the PRC, the government issued a new commemorative coin set which depicted Chinese cultural themes and Hong Kong&#x27;s landmarks and 19 and 97, marking the year 1997, on each side of the designs.

As of today, coins in denominations of HK$10, HK$5, HK$2, HK$1, 50 cents, 20 cents and 10 cents are issued by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority on behalf of the Government of Hong Kong.

==Banknotes==

The issue of Hong Kong dollar notes is governed today by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), the governmental currency board of Hong Kong. Under licence from the HKMA, three commercial banks issue their own banknotes for general circulation in the region. They are Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited; the Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited; and the Standard Chartered Bank (Hong Kong) Limited. Notes are also issued by the HKMA itself. In most countries of the world the issue of banknotes is handled exclusively by a single central bank or government. The arrangements in Hong Kong are unusual but not unique; a comparable system is used in the United Kingdom, where seven banks issue banknotes.

As of today, the three commercial banks, HSBC, Bank of China and Standard Chartered issue their own designs of banknotes in denominations of HK$20, HK$50, HK$100, HK$500 and HK$1,000, with all designs being similar to the other in the same denomination of banknote. While only the HK$10 banknote is issued solely by Hong Kong Monetary Authority on behalf of the Government of Hong Kong, which in total makes up the banknote circulation arrangement to four different note issuers.

In 1845, the first private bank, the Oriental Bank, was founded. However, banknotes were not produced until the 1860s, when the Oriental Bank, the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China and the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation began issuing notes. Denominations issued in the 1860s and 1870s included 1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100 and 500 dollars. These notes were not accepted by the Treasury for payment of government dues and taxes, although they were accepted for use by merchants. 25 dollar notes did not survive beyond the end of the 19th century, whilst the 1-dollar notes (only produced by the HSBC) were issued until 1935.

Under the Currency Ordinance of 1935, banknotes in denominations of 5 dollars and above issued by the three authorised local banks, the Mercantile Bank of India, London and China, the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China and the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, were all declared legal tender. The government took over production of 1 dollar notes. In 1941, the government introduced notes for 1 cent, 5 cents and 10 cents due to the difficulty of transporting coins to Hong Kong caused by the Second World War (a ship carrying 1941 1-cent coins was sunk, making this unissued coin very rare). Just before the Japanese occupation, an emergency issue of 1 dollar notes was made consisting of overprinted Bank of China 5 yuan notes.

In 1945, paper money production resumed essentially unaltered from before the war, with the government issuing 1 cent, 5 cents, 10 cents, and 1-dollar notes, and the three banks issuing 5, 10, 50, 100 and 500-dollar notes. 1-dollar notes were replaced by coins in 1960, with only the 1-cent note issued by the government after 1965.

In 1975, the HK$5 notes were replaced by coins, whilst HK$1,000 notes were introduced in 1977. The Mercantile Bank was absorbed by the HSBC in 1978 and ceased issuing notes. In 1985, HK$20 notes were introduced, whilst, in 1993, HK$10 coins were introduced and the banks stopped issuing HK$10 notes. In 1994 the HKMA gave authority to the Bank of China to issue notes.

On New Year&#x27;s Day (1 January) 1993 at stroke of midnight HKT, HSBC, Bank of China and Standard Chartered officially introduced all new banknote designs.

HSBC, Bank of China and Standard Chartered officially introduced a new series of banknotes on New Year&#x27;s Day (1 January) 1993 at stroke of midnight HKT in denominations of $10, $20, $25, $50, $100, $500 and $1000.

After a less-than-successful trial from 1994 to 2002 to move the HK$10 denomination from the banknote format (issued by the banks) to the coin format (Government-issued), HK$10 notes are currently the only denomination issued by the HKMA, having acquired the note printing plant at Tai Po from the De La Rue Group of the UK on behalf of the Government. These notes were printed in paper in 2002 and in polymer since 2007. All older HK$10 banknotes, although rare and being phased out, remain legal tender.

The latest series of banknotes was issued starting in 2018. Commemorative banknotes have also been issued celebrating the note-issuing banks&#x27; anniversaries as well as the Olympic Games held in Beijing in 2008 and 2022.

==Economics==

===Linked exchange rate system===


Since 1983, the linked exchange rate system is a unique type of exchange rate regime used for the Hong Kong dollar to be pegged with the United States dollar at a fixed rate of HK$7.80 = US$1. In this unique linked exchange rate system, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) authorises the three note-issuing commercial banks to freely issue new banknotes provided that they deposit an equivalent value of United States dollars with the HKMA.

In practice, in the unique linked exchange rate system, the exchange rate of HK$7.80 = US$1, is strictly controlled by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority in the foreign exchange market by controlling supply and demand of Hong Kong dollars in order to influence the exchange rate being fixed. By this arrangement the HKMA guarantees to exchange United States dollar into Hong Kong dollars and vice versa, at the rate of 7.80. When the market rate is below 7.80, the banks will convert United States dollar for Hong Kong dollars from the HKMA, Hong Kong dollars supply will increase, and the market rate will climb back to 7.80. The same mechanism also works when the market rate is above 7.80, and the banks will convert Hong Kong dollars for United States dollars.

By this arrangement, the Hong Kong dollar is backed by one of the world&#x27;s largest foreign exchange reserves, which is over 7 times the amount of money supplied in circulation or about 48% of Hong Kong dollar M3 at the end of April 2016.

===Renminbi peg debate===

Following the Internationalization of the renminbi in the late 2000s and the inclusion of the Renminbi in the special drawing rights, there has been some debates to peg the Hong Kong dollar with the Renminbi, instead of the United States dollar. Studies shows that, if the Hong Kong dollar were to be re-pegged to the Renminbi, it would need over 2 trillion Renminbi worth of assets to replace the HKMA&#x27;s US$340 billion in foreign reserves as of 2015, which exceeds the amount of existing Renminbi assets in Hong Kong&#x27;s offshore market. Moreover, according to figures from the HKMA as of the end of 2014, Renminbi deposits and certificates of deposits stood at 1.158 trillion Renminbi, while outstanding Renminbi bonds amounted to 381 billion and Renminbi-denominated loans stood at 188 billion. Other studies shows, while the Hong Kong&#x27;s financial and economic links are increasingly dominated by mainland China, and previous concerns about the monetary openness of China&#x27;s capital account are slowly receding, if China continues to open its capital account, the peg could shift from United States dollar to renminbi.

However, in January 2016, the volatility in the Renminbi and China&#x27;s financial markets expanded to Hong Kong&#x27;s markets and its currency. Renminbi offshore overnight borrowing rate, CNH HIBOR, soared to 66.8% on 12 January after the People&#x27;s Bank of China, China&#x27;s central bank (PBOC), intervened in the effort of squeezing out Renminbi short speculations by tightening liquidity at Hong Kong commercial banks. The PBOC&#x27;s move at the offshore market, coupled with another plunge in Chinese stocks, has led to investors’ fears that the Hong Kong Dollar may be de-pegged from the US Dollar in the foreseeable future. In response to the market speculation, Hong Kong Monetary Authority said on 27 January that the regulator will protect Hong Kong dollar&#x27;s linked exchange rate regime. As Hong Kong&#x27;s financial markets are highly impacted by mainland China, the Renminbi exchange rate as well as China&#x27;s equity market remain in a state of high volatility and continues to weigh on Hong Kong markets and the Hong Kong dollar. However, the greater influence remains the US Federal Reserve, as whenever it raises interest rates and sends the US Dollar higher, the linked Hong Kong Dollar would become more expensive than un-pegged currencies including the Chinese Yuan.

<text>Romagna () is an Italian historical region that approximately corresponds to the south-eastern portion of present-day Emilia-Romagna in northern Italy.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Romagna&quot; originates from the Latin name &quot;Romania&quot;, which originally was the generic name for &quot;land inhabited by Romans&quot;, and first appeared on Latin documents in the 5th century AD. It later took on the more specific meaning of &quot;territory subjected to Eastern Roman rule&quot;, whose citizens called themselves Romans (&quot;Romani&quot; in Latin; , &quot;Rhomaîoi&quot; in Greek). Thus the term &quot;Romania&quot; came to be used to refer to the territory administered by the Exarchate of Ravenna in contrast to other parts of Northern Italy under Lombard rule, named &quot;Langobardia&quot; or &quot;Lombardy&quot;.

==Location and boundaries==
Romagna is traditionally limited by the Apennines to the south-west, the Adriatic to the east, and the rivers Reno and Sillaro to the north and west. To the southeast, the valley formed by the Conca river has historically formed a buffer region between the regions of Romagna and the Marche.

The region&#x27;s major cities include Cesena, Faenza, Forlì, Imola, Ravenna, and Rimini. The independent Republic of San Marino is considered by some to be part of the region.

Romagnol culture exerts a considerable influence over the Montefeltro historical region, on the borders between Emilia-Romagna, Tuscany, and the Marche. On 15 August 2009, seven municipalities were transferred from the Province of Pesaro and Urbino to the Province of Rimini: Casteldelci, Maiolo, Novafeltria, Pennabilli, San Leo, Sant&#x27;Agata Feltria and Talamello. On 17 June 2021, the municipalities of Montecopiolo and Sassofeltrio followed.

==History==
===Prehistory===
A number of archaeological sites in the region, such as Monte Poggiolo, show that Romagna has been inhabited since the Paleolithic age.

===Umbri and Gauls===
The Umbri, speaking an extinct Italic language called Umbrian, are the first traceable inhabitants of the region. The Etruscans also dwelt in some portions of Romagna.

In the 5th century BC, various Gaulish tribes, most notably the Lingones, Senones and Boii, moved south into Ithe Italian peninsula, and sacked Rome in 390 BC. The Senones subjugated the Umbri and settled in Romagna, extending south to Ancona, with their capital at &#x27; (Senigallia). The lands formerly inhabited by the Senones were known as &#x27; (Gallic plain) to the Romans.

According to the Italian linguist Giacomo Devoto, there are still a number of Celtic substrata in the Romagnolo dialect.

===Roman Republic===
In 295 BC, the Roman Republic won a decisive victory at the Battle of Sentinum against a coalition of Umbris, Senones, Samnites, and Etruscans. To consolidate their victory, the &quot;colonia&quot; of (Rimini) was founded in southern Romagna in 268 BC, alongside the construction of the Via Flaminia, running from Rome to . Rome was further strengthened by their victory over Celtic tribes at the Battle of Telamon in 225 BC, leading to the Roman hegemony over the new Roman Province of Cisalpine Gaul centred at (modern Modena).

After the Second Punic War, the pro-Carthaginian Lingones and Senoni were expelled. To consolidate the Roman rule in the region, in 187 BC, the Via Aemilia was completed from to (Piacenza). A series of colonies were founded along the route; in Romagna, these included (Forlì), (Imola), and (Forlimpopoli). The Lex Julia of 90 BC, following the Social War, granted Roman citizenship to all &quot;municipia&quot; south of the River Po.

During Sulla&#x27;s civil war in 82 to 82 BC, most of the colonies supported Gaius Marius. and (Cesena) were razed to ground, and the region was looted by Lucius Cornelius Sulla&#x27;s victorious army.

The First Triumvirate divided the Roman Republic along the infamous Rubicon. Most of the colonies in present-day Romagna were ruled by Julius Caesar, with the notable exception of , south of the river. In 49 BC, Caesar, who had been residing in Ravenna, led the Legio XIII across the Rubicon, igniting Caesar&#x27;s civil war.

===Roman Empire===
After the decisive Battle of Actium, the reign of Augustus started a centuries-long era of &quot;Pax Romana&quot;. All of Cisalpine Gaul had been incorporated into the Roman province of Italia. Around 7 BC, Augustus divided all of Italy into eleven &quot;regiones&quot;, and most of Romagna (except Rimini) was in the eighth, &quot;&quot;.

Towards the end of the 3rd century, Diocletian reordered the Empire into four prefectures, each divided into dioceses, which in turn were divided into provinces. Under the new system, Italy was demoted to a mere Imperial province. Modern Romagna was organized into the Roman province of &quot;Flaminia et Picenum&quot; in the diocese of Italia Annonaria.

Ravenna, which was surrounded by swamps and marshes, prospered and steadily rose in importance, and a Roman fleet was based at the city. It had developed into a major port on the Adriatic. However, in 330, the capital of the Empire was transferred to Constantinople, so with the fleet that stationed at Ravenna, thus weakened the coastal defence in the Adriatic.

===Germanic migrations and Exarchate of Ravenna===
Stepping into the 5th century, the Germanic migrations into the Empire further intensified. In 402, Emperor Honorius even moved the Western Roman Empire&#x27;s capital from Mediolanum to Ravenna, mainly because of the region&#x27;s defensive terrain. 8 years later, Alaric I of the Visigoths looted Rome. In 476, Odoacer deposed Romulus in Ravenna, thus marking an end to the Western Empire.

Encouraged by Emperor Zeno, Theodoric the Great led the Ostrogoths into Italy. He entered Ravenna and murdered Odoacer in 493, establishing a twofold kingdom of the Romans and Goths. Under the Ostrogoths Italy was partly restored to its former prosperity.

In 535 Justinian I initiated the Gothic War. It was fought for 20 years, and the Ostrogoths were finally subjugated. The peninsula, depopulated and devastated, was ruled by an exarch from Ravenna. However, Imperial authority was maintained for barely more than a decade. In 568 new Germanic tribes, the Lombards, entered Italy, and established their capital at Pavia. The Empire could barely defend the region around Ravenna and Rome, connected by a narrow strip of land passing through Perugia, as well as a series of coastal cities. The Imperial frontier retreated to Bologna.

In 727 the Lombard King Liutprand renewed war against the Byzantines, taking most of Romagna and besieging Ravenna itself. These territories were returned to the Byzantines in 730. In 737 the king entered Romagna once more and took Ravenna. The exarch, Eutychius, retook the region in 740, with Venetian assistance. Eventually another Lombard king, Aistulf, conquered Romagna once more, and brought an end to the exarchate in 751.

===Papal rule===

King Rudolf I of Germany officially ceded Romagna to the Papal States in 1278. However, papal control over the area long remained only nominal. The region was divided among a series of regional lords, such as the Ordelaffi of Forlì or the Malatesta of Rimini, many of them adhering to the Ghibelline party in opposition to the pro-papal Guelphs. This situation started to change in the late-15th century, when after their return to Rome from Avignon in 1378, stronger popes progressively reasserted their authority in the fragmented region. Parts of Romagna were also seized by other powers, including Venice, and most notably the Republic of Florence, which took land up to Forlì and Cervia, building the famous city-fortress of Terra del Sole. The Florentine Romagna remained part of Tuscany until the 1920s.


In 1500 Cesare Borgia, illegitimate son of Pope Alexander VI, carved out for himself an ephemeral Duchy of Romagna, but his lands were reabsorbed into the Papal States after his fall. In 1559 the Peace of Cateau-Cambrésis divided Romagna between the Farnese family of the Duchy of Parma and Piacenza, the House of Este of the Ferrara, and the Duchy of Modena and Reggio, and the Papal States. The Duchy of Ferrara was later annexed by the Papal States on the extinction of the main d&#x27;Este line in 1597, with the cadet branch retaining the Imperial fiefs of Modena and Reggio.

This situation lasted until the French invasion of 1796, which brought bloodshed (the massacre of Lugo, looting, heavy taxation, the destruction of Cesena University) but also innovative ideas in social and political fields. Under Napoleonic rule Romagna received recognition as an entity for the first time, with the creation of the provinces of the Pino (Ravenna) and Rubicone (Forlì). When in 1815 the Congress of Vienna restored the pre-war situation, secret anti-papal societies were formed, and riots broke out in 1820, 1830–31 and 1848.

This opposition was fuelled by the Mazzinian propaganda and the direct action of Giuseppe Garibaldi. Men like Felice Orsini, Piero Maroncelli and Aurelio Saffi were among the protagonists of the Italian Risorgimento.

===Post-unification===
However, after joining the unification of Italy in 1860, Romagna was not awarded separate status by the Savoy monarchs, who were afraid of dangerous destabilizing tendencies in the wake of the popular figures cited above.

In the early 20th century the autonomy of Romagna was advocated by Aldo Spallicci, Giuseppe Fuschini, Emilio Lussu and others. A movement proposing separation from Emilia-Romagna was created in the 1990s.

<doc id="309748" wikidata="Q719518" url="?curid=309748" title="Paxos">
<text>Paxos () is a Greek island in the Ionian Sea, lying just south of Corfu. As a group with the nearby island of Antipaxos and adjoining islets, it is also called by the plural form Paxi or Paxoi (, pronounced in English and in Greek). The main town and the seat of the municipality is Gaios. The smallest of the seven main Ionian Islands (the Heptanese), Paxos has an area of , while the municipality has an area of and a population of about 2,500.

Paxos lies some 15 km from the southern tip of Corfu and at about the same distance from the town of Parga on the mainland. It is connected by ferry lines from Igoumenitsa and Corfu with Gaios. The island is hilly, the highest point having an elevation of 230 m.

In Greek mythology, Poseidon created the island by striking Corfu with his trident, so that he and his wife Amphitrite could have some peace and quiet.

==History==

Paxos is a historical island that has been inhabited since prehistoric times. According to tradition, the Phoenicians were the first settlers on Paxos, and it is believed that the name &quot;Paxos&quot; originated from the Phoenician word &quot;Pax,&quot; meaning &quot;trapezoidal.&quot; In ancient times, Paxos played a significant role, especially during the First Illyrian War in 229 BC when the Battle of Paxos was fought between the ancient Greek and Illyrian fleets. The account of this battle is documented in The Histories, a work by the ancient historian Polybius.

Paxos has been ruled by various conquerors, including the Romans in the 2nd century BC, pirates during the Byzantine era and Middle Ages, and by Crusaders. Eventually, the Venetians gained control of the island at the end of the 14th century.

During the Napoleonic Wars, the Ionian Islands were occupied by the French and the Russo-Turkish alliance. However, Paxos surrendered to the Royal Navy frigate HMS &quot;Apollo&quot; and 160 troops from the 2nd Greek Light Infantry from Cephalonia and the 35th Regiment of the Royal Corsican Rangers on February 13, 1814. The United Kingdom established the Ionian Union in 1815, and in 1864, Paxos, along with the rest of the Ionian Islands, was ceded to Greece.

==Geography==

Paxos lies some 15 km from the southern tip of Corfu, and at about the same distance from the town of Parga on the mainland.

The island is approximately long and up to wide, stretching in northwest–southeast direction. Much of the hilly landscape is covered in olive groves. These stretch from Lakka, the harbour community in the north, through Magazia to Gaios, the capital. Coastal communities of Gaios, Lakka and Longos on the east coast are the three main settlements, while the interior features numerous scattered hamlets. The west coast is dominated by steep white, chalky cliffs that are greatly eroded at sea level, and harbour many &quot;blue caves&quot;. The highest point of the island is Agios Isavros at an elevation of 231 m. Several islets lie very close to the coast of Paxos: Agios Nikolaos and Panagia protect the harbor of Gaios, while Mongonisi and Kaltsonisi lie off the southeastern tip. Antipaxos lies some 5 km further southeast.

The production of olive oil, soap manufacture and fishing were supplanted by tourism as the main industry in the mid-1960s, resulting in a construction boom, which has greatly altered the coastline around Gaios, the capital of the Paxiot &quot;demos&quot; (community).

==Fauna==

===Reptiles and amphibians===
Only a few articles have been published on the herpetofauna of Paxos and Antipaxos; the latest in 2014 and 2017, where the following reptile species were confirmed: &quot;Hemidactylus turcicus&quot;, &quot;Mediodactylus kotschyi&quot;, &quot;Algyroides nigropunctatus&quot;, &quot;Hierophis gemonensis&quot;, and &quot;Zamenis longissimus&quot;. Earlier reports of &quot;Lacerta viridis&quot;, &quot;Laudakia stellio&quot;, and &quot;Platyceps najadum&quot; were not confirmed.

No amphibians have been reported on the islands.

==Province==
The province of Paxoi () was one of the provinces of the Corfu Prefecture. Its territory corresponded with that of the current municipality Paxoi. It was abolished in 2006.

==Foreign residents==
Among well known semi-permanent British inhabitants were Audrey Good, former commander of the UN refugee bases in Epirus following the Greek Civil War, actor Peter Bull (author of &quot;It Isn&#x27;t All Greek to Me&quot;), and actress Susannah York.

Members of the Agnelli family (of FIAT fame) have built a palatial holiday home—complete with &quot;faux&quot; medieval tower—on a small island of (Kaltonisi) situated near the southernmost tip (&#x27;the heel&#x27;) of Paxos, close to the beach of Mongonissi.

Paxos is part of a European network called Cultural Village of Europe. The annual Paxos Festival was founded by John Gough, and is now organised by the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London, and attracts some of Europe&#x27;s finest young performers. This festival events usually take place between June and September and are usually held in the disused school of Longos.

==Transport==
The island is serviced by combined passenger and vehicle ferries which operate year-round from the port of Igoumenitsa on the mainland of Greece (1.5 hours). In the tourist season hydrofoils, passenger ferries and sea-taxis operate from Corfu (1–2 hours). A hydrofoil passenger service operates outside the tourist season, but is infrequent and weather dependent. Winter visitors should anticipate occasional periods of isolation.

<doc id="309749" wikidata="Q208526" url="?curid=309749" title="New Taiwan dollar">
<text>The New Taiwan dollar (code: TWD; symbol: NT$, also abbreviated as NT) is the official currency of the Republic of China (Taiwan). Usually, the $ sign precedes the amount, but NT$ is used to distinguish from other currencies named dollar. The New Taiwan dollar has been the currency of the island of Taiwan since 1949, when it replaced the old Taiwan dollar, at a rate of 40,000 old dollars per one new dollar. The base unit of the New Taiwan dollar is called a yuan (), subdivided into ten chiao () or 100 fen (), although in practice neither chiao nor fen are used.

There are a variety of alternative names for the units in Taiwan. The unit of the dollar is typically informally written with the simpler equivalent character as , except when writing it for legal transactions such as at the bank, when it has to be written as the homophonous . Colloquially, the currency unit is called both (&quot;yuán&quot;, literally &quot;circle&quot;) and (&quot;kuài&quot;, literally &quot;piece&quot;) in Mandarin, (&quot;kho͘&quot;, literally &quot;hoop&quot;) in Hokkien, and (&quot;ngiùn&quot;, literally &quot;silver&quot;) in Hakka.

The Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan) has issued the New Taiwan Dollar since 2000. Prior to 2000, the Bank of Taiwan issued banknotes as the &quot;de facto&quot; central bank between 1949 and 1961, and after 1961 continued to issue banknotes as a delegate of the central bank. The central bank began issuing New Taiwan dollar banknotes in July 2000, and the notes issued by the Bank of Taiwan were taken out of circulation.

==Terminology==
The adjective &quot;new&quot; () is only added in formal contexts where it is necessary to avoid any ambiguity, even though ambiguity is virtually non-existent today. These contexts include banking, contracts, or foreign exchange. The currency unit name can be written as or , which are interchangeable. They are both pronounced &quot;yuán&quot; in Mandarin but have different pronunciations in Taiwanese Hokkien (îⁿ, goân) and Hakka (yèn, ngièn). The name in Taiwanese Hokkien and Hakka for cent is a loanword borrowed from English.

In English usage, the New Taiwan dollar is often abbreviated as NT, NT$, or NT dollar, while the abbreviation TWD is typically used in the context of foreign exchange rates. Subdivisions of a New Taiwan dollar are rarely used since practically all products on the consumer market are sold in whole dollars. Nevertheless, electronic transactions and bank statements can be expressed to 1 &quot;fen&quot; ($0.01).

==History==
The various currencies called yuan or dollar issued in China, as well as the Japanese yen, were all derived from the Spanish American silver dollar, which China imported in large quantities from Spanish America through Spanish Philippines in the Manila-Acapulco Galleon Trade from the 16th to 20th centuries. After the use of the Spanish dollar and silver Chinese yuan in Taiwan, it issued the Taiwanese yen in 1895, followed by the Old Taiwan dollar in 1946.

The Bank of Taiwan first issued the New Taiwan dollar on 15 June 1949 to replace the Old Taiwan dollar at a ratio of 40,000 to one. The first goal of the New Taiwan dollar was to end the hyperinflation that had plagued Nationalist China due to the Chinese Civil War.

After the communists captured Beijing in January 1949, the Nationalists began to retreat to Taiwan. The government then declared in the Temporary Provisions Effective During the Period of Communist Rebellion that dollars issued by the Bank of Taiwan would become the new currency in circulation.

Even though the New Taiwan dollar was the &quot;de facto&quot; currency of Taiwan, statutes after 1949 still define the silver yuan or silver dollar as the legal currency, worth NT$3. Many older statutes have fines and fees given in silver yuan. Its value of NT$3 has not been updated despite decades of inflation, making the silver yuan a purely notional currency a long time ago, inconvertible to actual silver.

When the &quot;Temporary Provisions&quot; were made ineffective in 1991, the ROC lacked a legal national currency until the year 2000, when the Central Bank of China (CBC) replaced the Bank of Taiwan in issuing NT bills. In July 2000, the New Taiwan dollar became Taiwan&#x27;s legal currency. It is no longer secondary to the silver yuan. At this time, the central bank began issuing New Taiwan dollar banknotes, and the notes issued earlier by the Bank of Taiwan were taken out of circulation.

The exchange rate compared to the United States dollar has varied from less than ten to one in the mid-1950s, more than forty to one in the 1960s, and about twenty-five to one in 1992. The exchange rate as of July 2021 is NT$27.93 per US$.

==Coins==
The denominations of the New Taiwan dollar in circulation are:

Coins are minted by the Central Mint, while notes are printed by the Central Engraving and Printing Plant. Both are run by the Central Bank. The 50¢ coin is rare because of its low value, while the NT$20 coin is rare because of the government&#x27;s lack of willingness to promote it. As of 2010, the cost of the raw materials in a 50¢ coin was more than the face value of the coin.

==Banknotes==

The current series of banknotes for the New Taiwan dollar began circulation in July 2000. This set was introduced when the New Taiwan dollar succeeded the silver yuan as the official currency within Taiwan.

The current set includes banknotes for NT$100, NT$200, NT$500, NT$1,000, and NT$2,000. Note that the NT$200 and NT$2,000 banknotes are not commonly used by consumers. This may be due to the tendency of consumers to simply use multiple NT$100 or NT$500 bills to cover the range of NT$200, as well as using multiple NT$1,000 bills or credit/debit cards instead of the NT$2,000 bill. Lack of government promotion may also be a contributing factor to the general lack of usage.

It is relatively easy for the government to disseminate these denominations through various government bodies that do official business with the citizens, such as the post office, the tax authority, or state-owned banks. There is also a conspiracy theory against the Democratic Progressive Party, the ruling party at the time the NT$200 and NT$2,000 denominations were issued. The conspiracy states that putting Chiang Kai-shek on a rarely used banknote would &quot;practically&quot; remove him from the currency while &quot;nominally&quot; including him on the currency would not upset supporters on the other side of the political spectrum that much (the Pan-Blue Coalition).

The year 2000 version $500 and 1999 version $1000 notes without holographic strip were officially taken out of circulation on 1 August 2007. They were redeemable at commercial banks until 30 September 2007. As of 1 October 2007, only Bank of Taiwan accepts such notes.

===100-dollar commemorative note===

On 6 January 2011, the Central Bank of the Republic of China issued a new 100-dollar legal tender circulating commemorative in celebration of the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China. The red paper note measures 145 × 70 mm and features a portrait of Dr. Sun Yat-sen on the front and the Chung-Shan Building on the back. The design is no different from the ordinary NT$100 note, except for the Chinese wording on the reverse of the note, which reads &quot;Celebrating 100 years since the founding of the Republic of China ()&quot;.

<text>Investigative journalism is a form of journalism in which reporters deeply investigate a single topic of interest, such as serious crimes, racial injustice, political corruption, or corporate wrongdoing. An investigative journalist may spend months or years researching and preparing a report. Practitioners sometimes use the terms &quot;watchdog reporting&quot; or &quot;accountability reporting&quot;.

Most investigative journalism has traditionally been conducted by newspapers, wire services, and freelance journalists. With the decline in income through advertising, many traditional news services have struggled to fund investigative journalism, due to it being very time-consuming and expensive. Journalistic investigations are increasingly carried out by news organizations working together, even internationally (as in the case of the Panama Papers, Paradise Papers and Pandora Papers), or by nonprofit outlets such as ProPublica, which rely on the support of the public and benefactors to fund their work.

== Definitions ==
University of Missouri journalism professor Steve Weinberg defined investigative journalism as: &quot;Reporting, through one&#x27;s own initiative and work product, matters of importance to readers, viewers, or listeners.&quot; In many cases, the subjects of the reporting wish the matters under scrutiny to remain undisclosed. There are currently university departments for teaching investigative journalism. Conferences are conducted presenting peer-reviewed research into investigative journalism.

British media theorist Hugo de Burgh (2000) states that: &quot;An investigative journalist is a man or woman whose profession is to discover the truth and to identify lapses from it in whatever media may be available. The act of doing this generally is called investigative journalism and is distinct from apparently similar work done by police, lawyers, auditors, and regulatory bodies in that it is not limited as to target, not legally founded and closely connected to publicity.&quot;

==History==

Early newspapers in British colonial America were often suppressed by the authorities for their investigative journalism. Examples include &quot;Publick Occurrences Both Forreign and Domestick&quot; and Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s &quot;New England Courant&quot;. Journalists who reported on the doings of the British authorities would later contribute to revolutionary sentiment in the run-up to the American Revolution; one prominent example was the &quot;Boston Gazette&quot;, contributed to by Samuel Adams among others.

American journalism textbooks point out that muckraking standards promoted by &quot;McClure&#x27;s Magazine&quot; around 1902, &quot;Have become integral to the character of modern investigative journalism.&quot; Furthermore, the successes of the early muckrakers continued to inspire journalists.

The outlook for investigative journalism in the United States was improved by the 1960s with the Freedom of Information Act and &quot;New York Times Co. v. Sullivan&quot;. The invention of the photocopier also offered an assistive tool to whistleblowers.

The growth of media conglomerates in the U.S. since the 1980s has been accompanied by massive cuts in the budgets for investigative journalism. A 2002 study concluded &quot;that investigative journalism has all but disappeared from the nation&#x27;s commercial airwaves.&quot; Non-commercial journalism has increasingly stepped-up to work on this growing need for in-depth investigations and reporting. One of the largest teams of investigative journalists is the Washington-based International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) launched in 1997 by the Center for Public Integrity which includes 165 investigative reporters in over 65 countries working collaboratively on crime, corruption, and abuse of power at a global level, under Gerard Ryle as Director. Working with major media outlets globally, they have exposed organised crime, international tobacco companies, private military cartels, asbestos companies, climate change lobbyists, details of Iraq and Afghanistan war contracts, and most recently the Panama Papers and Paradise Papers. The investigative Commons center opened in Berlin, Germany in 2021 and houses the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights, Forensic Architecture, and Bellingcat.

== Tools ==
An investigative reporter may make use of one or more of these tools, among others, on a single story:

* Analysis of documents, such as lawsuits and other legal documents, tax records, government reports, regulatory reports, and corporate financial filings.
* Databases of public records.
* Investigation of technical issues, including scrutiny of government and business practices and their effects.
* Research into social and legal issues.
* Subscription research sources such as LexisNexis.
* Numerous interviews with on-the-record sources as well as, in some instances, interviews with anonymous sources (for example whistleblowers).
* Federal or state Freedom of Information Acts to obtain documents and data from government agencies.
* OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) databases and tools that contain free and open resources that anybody can use.

==Examples==

* Julius Chambers of the &quot;New-York Tribune&quot; had himself committed to the Bloomingdale Asylum in 1872, and his account led to the release of twelve patients who were not mentally ill, a reorganization of the staff and administration, and eventually to a change in the lunacy laws; this later led to the publication of the book &quot;A Mad World and Its Inhabitants&quot; (1876).
*Ida B. Wells-Barnett&#x27;s 1892 pamphlet &quot;Southern Horrors&quot; documented lynching in the United States, exposing in the pages of black-owned newspapers as a campaign of oppression and intimidation against African Americans. A white mob destroyed her newspaper press and office in retaliation for her reporting.
*Ida Tarbell&#x27;s 1904 book, &quot;The History of the Standard Oil Company&quot;, exposed the nefarious practices and methods of the monopoly of the company, and led to its dismantling.
*Upton Sinclair&#x27;s 1905 book &quot;The Jungle&quot; exposed unsanitary conditions in American meatpacking plants, and led to the creation of the Food and Drug Administration.
*Nellie Bly, a pseudonym used by Elizabeth Cochrane Seaman in the late 19th century, famously feigned insanity as part of her 1887 undercover investigation into and subsequent exposé regarding the inner-workings of the Women&#x27;s Lunatic Asylum in New York City. Published to wide acclaim as a series of articles in the &quot;New York World&quot; which were later compiled and further detailed in her book &quot;Ten Days in a Mad-House&quot;, Bly&#x27;s revelations led to both a grand jury investigation of the asylum and increased funding for the Department of Public Charities and Corrections.
*Between 1972 and 1974 Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein uncovered and exposed a variety of incriminating information regarding President Richard Nixon&#x27;s 1968–1972 presidential campaign. The information exposed, prompted Nixon&#x27;s resignation in 1974 and was then on recognized as the Watergate scandal.
*Bill Dedman&#x27;s 1988 investigation, &quot;The Color of Money&quot;, for &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; on racial discrimination by mortgage lenders in middle-income neighborhoods, received the 1989 Pulitzer Prize for Investigative Reporting and was an influential early example of computer-assisted reporting or database journalism.
*Brian Deer&#x27;s British press award-winning investigation for &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; of London into the worldwide MMR vaccine controversy which revealed that research, published by &quot;The Lancet&quot;, associating the children&#x27;s vaccine with autism was fraudulent.
*&quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; investigated claims that various British Members of Parliament had been filing dubious and frivolous expenses claims, and had done for many years in secret. The House of Commons Authority initially tried to block the release of the information, but the expenses were leaked to the &quot;Telegraph&quot;. The newspaper then released pieces of information which dominated the news for weeks and caused considerable anger in the UK.
*John M. Crewdson of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; wrote a 1996 article proposing the installment of defibrillators on American airliners. Crewdson argued that based on his research and analysis, &quot;Medical kits and defibrillators would be economically justified if they saved just 3 lives each year.&quot; Soon after the article&#x27;s publication, airlines began installing defibrillators on planes, and the devices began to show up in airports and other public spaces. Ten years after installing defibrillators, American Airlines reported that 80 lives had been saved by the machines.
* Project Censored regularly investigates stories which have gone undercovered by other outlets.
* Hopewell Chin&#x27;ono, the award-winning Zimbabwean journalist who investigated and exposed the Covid-gate scandal in Zimbabwe in June 2020. US$60 million was siphoned to a shadowy company called Drax that is linked to President Emmerson Mnangagwa. The exposure resulted in the dismissal and arrest of Health Minister Obbidiah Moyo. Hopewell Chin&#x27;ono was arrested on flimsy charges in an apparent attempt to silence him.

<text>The Empire of Nicaea (), also known as the Nicene Empire, was the largest of the three Byzantine Greek rump states founded by the aristocracy of the Byzantine Empire that fled when Constantinople was occupied by Western European and Venetian armed forces during the Fourth Crusade, a military event known as the Sack of Constantinople. Like the other Byzantine rump states that formed due to the 1204 fracturing of the empire, such as the Empire of Trebizond and the Despotate of Epirus, it was a continuation of the eastern half of the Roman Empire that survived well into the Middle Ages. A fourth state, known in historiography as the Latin Empire, was established by an army of Crusaders and the Republic of Venice after the capture of Constantinople and the surrounding environs.

Founded by the Laskaris family, it lasted from 1204 to 1261, when the Nicenes restored the Byzantine Empire after they recaptured Constantinople. Thus, the Nicene Empire is seen as a direct continuation of the Byzantine Empire, as it fully assumed the traditional titles and government of the Byzantines in 1205.

The Despotate of Epirus contested the claim in 1224 and became the Empire of Thessalonica, but was forced to renounce its claim by the Nicenes in 1242. The Empire of Trebizond, which declared its independence a few weeks before the Sack of Constantinople in 1204, withdrew all claims to being a continuation of the Byzantine Empire in the Treaty of 1282.

==History==

===Foundation===
In 1204, Byzantine emperor Alexios V Doukas Mourtzouphlos fled Constantinople after crusaders invaded the city. Soon after, Theodore I Laskaris, the son-in-law of Emperor Alexios III Angelos, was proclaimed emperor, but he too, realizing the situation in Constantinople was hopeless, fled to the city of Nicaea in Bithynia.

The Latin Empire, established by the Crusaders in Constantinople, had poor control over former Byzantine territory, and Greek successor states of the Byzantine Empire sprang up in Epirus, Trebizond, and Nicaea. Trebizond had broken away as an independent state a few weeks before the fall of Constantinople. Nicaea, however, was the closest to the Latin Empire and was in the best position to attempt to re-establish the Byzantine Empire.

Theodore Laskaris was not immediately successful, as Henry of Flanders defeated him at Poimanenon and Prusa (now Bursa) in 1204. But Theodore was able to capture much of northwestern Anatolia after the Bulgarian defeat of Latin Emperor Baldwin I in the Battle of Adrianople, because Henry was recalled to Europe to defend against invasions from Tsar Kaloyan of Bulgaria. Theodore also defeated an army from Trebizond, as well as other minor rivals, leaving him in charge of the most powerful of the successor states.

Numerous truces and alliances were formed and broken over the next few years, as the Byzantine successor states, the Latin Empire, the Bulgarian Empire and the Seljuks of Iconium (whose territory also bordered Nicaea) fought each other. In 1211, at Antioch on the Meander, Theodore defeated a major invasion by the Seljuks, who were backing a bid by Alexios III Angelos to return to power. The losses suffered at Antioch, however, led to a defeat at the hands of the Latin Empire at the Rhyndacus River and the loss of most of Mysia and the Marmara Sea coast in the subsequent Treaty of Nymphaeum. The Nicenes were compensated for this territorial loss when, in 1212, the death of David Komnenos allowed their annexation of his lands in Paphlagonia.

In 1205, Theodore assumed the traditional titles of the Byzantine emperors. Three years later, he convoked a church council to elect a new Orthodox patriarch of Constantinople. The new patriarch crowned Theodore emperor and established his seat at Theodore&#x27;s capital, Nicaea. In 1219, he married the daughter of Latin Empress Yolanda of Flanders, but he died in 1221 and was succeeded by his son-in-law, John III Doukas Vatatzes

===Expansion===
The accession of Vatatzes was initially challenged by the Laskarids, with the &quot;sebastokratores&quot; Isaac and Alexios, brothers of Theodore I, seeking the aid of the Latin Empire. Vatatzes prevailed over their combined forces, however, in the Battle of Poimanenon, securing his throne and regaining almost all of the Asian territories held by the Latin Empire in the process.

In 1224, the Latin Kingdom of Thessalonica was captured by the Despot of Epirus Theodore Komnenos Doukas, who crowned himself emperor in rivalry to Vatatzes and established the Empire of Thessalonica. It proved short-lived, as it came under Bulgarian control after the Battle of Klokotnitsa in 1230. With Trebizond lacking any real power, Nicaea was the only effective Byzantine state left, and John III expanded his territory across the Aegean Sea. In 1235, he allied with Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria, allowing him to extend his influence over Thessalonica and Epirus.

In 1242, the Mongols invaded Seljuk territory to the east of Nicaea, and although John III was worried they might attack him next, they ended up eliminating the Seljuk threat to Nicaea. In 1245, John allied with the Holy Roman Empire by marrying Constance II of Hohenstaufen, daughter of Frederick II. In 1246, John attacked Bulgaria and recovered most of Thrace and Macedonia, and proceeded to incorporate Thessalonica into his realm. By 1248, John had defeated the Bulgarians and surrounded the Latin Empire. He continued to take land from the Latins until his death in 1254.

Theodore II Laskaris, John III&#x27;s son, faced invasions from the Bulgarians in Thrace, but successfully defended the territory. A conflict between Nicaea and Epirus broke out in 1257. Epirus allied with Manfred of Sicily when Theodore II died in 1258. John IV Laskaris succeeded him, but since he was still a child he was put under the regency of the general Michael Palaiologos. Michael proclaimed himself co-emperor (as Michael VIII) in 1259, and soon defeated a combined invasion by Manfred, the Despot of Epirus, and the Latin Prince of Achaea at the Battle of Pelagonia.

===Recapture of Constantinople===

In 1260, Michael began the assault on Constantinople itself, which his predecessors had been unable to do. He allied with Genoa, and his general Alexios Strategopoulos spent months observing Constantinople in order to plan his attack. In July 1261, as most of the Latin army was fighting elsewhere, Alexios was able to convince the guards to open the gates of the city. Once inside he burned the Venetian quarter (as Venice was an enemy of Genoa, and had been largely responsible for the capture of the city in 1204).

Michael was recognized as emperor a few weeks later, restoring the Byzantine Empire. Part of Achaea was soon recaptured, but Trebizond and Epirus remained independent Byzantine Greek states. The restored empire also faced a new threat from the Ottomans, when they arose to replace the Seljuks.

==Aftermath==
After 1261, Constantinople once more became the capital of the Byzantine Empire. The territories of the former Empire of Nicaea were stripped of their wealth, which was used to rebuild Constantinople and to fund numerous wars in Europe against the Latin states and Epirus. Soldiers were transferred from Asia Minor to Europe, leaving the old frontier relatively undefended. Raids by Turkish &quot; ghazis&quot; were left unchecked, and the frontier was increasingly overrun.

The usurpation of the legitimate Laskarid ruler John IV Laskaris by Michael VIII Palaiologos in 1261 alienated much of the populace against the restored Byzantine Empire at Constantinople. John IV was left behind at Nicaea, and was later blinded on Michael&#x27;s orders on his eleventh birthday, 25 December 1261. This made him ineligible for the throne, and he was exiled and imprisoned in a fortress in Bithynia. This action led to the excommunication of Michael VIII Palaiologos by the Patriarch Arsenios Autoreianos, and a later revolt led by a Pseudo-John IV near Nicaea.

The subsequent history of the former territory of the Empire of Nicaea is one of gradual conquest by the Turks. After the death of Michael VIII in 1282, Turkish raids turned into permanent settlement and the establishment of Turkish beyliks on former Byzantine territory. While the emperor Andronikos II attempted to improve the situation, it was unsuccessful. By c. 1300, nearly the whole of the former Empire of Nicaea had been conquered by the Turks, with only a tiny strip of territory directly opposite Constantinople clinging on. The final end of Byzantine Asia Minor came with the fall of Bursa in 1326, Nicaea in 1331 and Nicomedia in 1337.

==Military==
The Nicene Empire consisted of Byzantium&#x27;s most highly populated Greek region, with the exception of Thrace which was under Latin/Bulgar control. As such, the Empire was able to raise a reasonably numerous military force of around 20,000 soldiers at its height – numbers recorded as participating in its numerous wars against the Crusader states.

The Nicenes continued some aspects of the Komnenian army, but without the resources available to the Komnenian emperors the Nicene Byzantines could not match the numbers, nor the quality, of the armies that the emperor Manuel I Komnenos and his predecessors had fielded. Western Asia Minor had access to the sea, making it wealthier than most of the splinter states around and in time became the most powerful state in the region, if only for a short period.

==Ideology and Hellenism==
The court of the Nicene state widely used the term &quot;Hellenes&quot; instead of the earlier &quot;Romans&quot; to describe its Greek speaking population. Contemporaries preferred the use of &quot;Hellas&quot; or the adjective &quot;Hellenikon&quot; for the Empire of Nicaea. As such, Emperor Theodore Laskaris sometimes replaced the terms Romaioi (Romans) and Graikoi by Hellenes. Emperor Theodore II describes his realm as the &quot;new Hellas&quot;. Patriarch Germanos II used in official correspondence with the western world the term: &quot;Graikoi&quot; to describe the local population and &quot;Empire of the Greeks&quot; () as the name of the state. During that time there was a concerted ethnic Greek self-identification initiative.

Some scholars see the Nicene empire period as an indication of rising ethnic Hellenic consciousness and Greek nationalism. However, these scholars caution that a rise in ethnic consciousness did not affect the official imperial ideology. In the official ideology, the traditional view of Byzantium as the Roman Empire was not overturned, as the usage of the word Rhomaioi for subjects of the Nicene emperors demonstrates. The official ideology of the Nicene Empire was one of reconquest and militarism, which was not to be seen in later 14th-century Palaiologan rhetoric.

The ideology of 13th-century Nicaea was characterized by belief in the continued significance of Constantinople and the hope to recapture the city, drawing less on claims of political universalism or Hellenic nationalism than on Old Testament ideas of Jewish providence. The emperor in this period is frequently compared to Moses or Zorobabel, or even as the &quot;Pillar of Fire&quot; that guides God&#x27;s people to the Promised Land, e.g. in a speech delivered by Theodore I Laskaris, written by Niketas Choniates.

The rhetoric of this period also glorified war and the reconquest of Constantinople using images not drawn from the Old Testament. For example, in his panegyric of Theodore I Laskaris, Choniates describes a battle with a Seljuk sultan as a battle between Christianity and Islam, rhetorically comparing the wounds of Theodore, who had himself slain an enemy commander, to those of Christ on the cross. Dimiter Angelov suggests that western crusading ideology may have influenced the development of this view on reconquest, and during this period there is mention that Patriarch Michael IV Autoreianos offered full remission of sins to Nicene troops about to enter battle, a practice almost identical to a western plenary indulgence. However, the granting of such indulgences was short-lived, and many of the possible crusader influences seem to have dropped off after 1211.

The Byzantines of the 13th century also drew parallels between the situation of the empire after 1204 and that of Classical Greeks. This evidence has helped to strengthen the view of some scholars, such as A. E. Vacalopoulos, who see these references, combined with a re-evaluation of Byzantium&#x27;s classical past, to be the genesis of Greek nationalism. With the loss of Constantinople, this comparison played on the idea of &quot;Hellenes&quot; surrounded by barbarians; Choniates equated the Seljuk sultan killed by Theodore I with Xerxes, and Patriarch Germanos II recalled the victory of John III Vatatzes as another battle of Marathon or Salamis. In much the same way, Theodore II Laskaris compared his father&#x27;s victories to those of Alexander the Great and proceeded to extol the martial values of contemporary &quot;Hellenes&quot;.

In addition, during this period there seems to have been a shift in how the word &quot;Hellene&quot; was used in Byzantine parlance. Up to this point, &quot;Hellene&quot; had borne a negative connotation and was in particular associated with the remnants of paganism. In this period, however, both the terms &quot;Graikoi&quot; and &quot;Hellenes&quot; appear to enter into the diplomatic usage of the empire as a form of religious and ethnic self-identification, spurred by a desire to differentiate the empire and its citizens from the Latins. Patriarch Germanos II in particular exemplifies this new vision of ethnic and religious identity. His letters equate good birth with the purity of his Hellenistic ancestry, placing more value in his Hellenistic linguistic and ethnic background than in any association with Constantinople, and showing his contempt for the Latins who prided themselves on possessing the city. There is a debate among scholars regarding the exact timing of the shift in meaning of the word Hellene. Roderick Beaton, considering the evidence of the usage of the term &quot;Hellenes&quot; in the 12th century, sees the re-evaluation of the term as occurring before the loss of Constantinople in 1204. In addition, unlike Vacalopoulos, Beaton sees not the birth of Greek nationalism, but rather an embryonic &quot;ethnic&quot; awareness, primarily based around language.

Michael Angold notes that the ideology of the period displays the ability of the Byzantines to react and adapt to changing cultural and political circumstances, including exile, and that the ideological developments of this period were, for the most part, cut short and discarded by the restored empire of the Palaiologoi, as Michael VIII returned to the ideology of earlier periods.

<text>Zakynthos (also spelled Zakinthos; ; ) or Zante (, , ; ; from the Venetian form, traditionally Latinized as Zacynthus) is a Greek island in the Ionian Sea. It is the third largest of the Ionian Islands, with an area of , and a coastline in length. The name, like all similar names ending in &quot;&quot;, is pre-Mycenaean or Pelasgian in origin. In Greek mythology, the island was said to be named after Zacynthus, the son of the legendary Arcadian chief Dardanus.

Zakynthos is a tourist destination, especially amongst British tourists, with an international airport served by charter flights from northern Europe. The island&#x27;s nickname is &quot;the Flower of the Levant&quot;, bestowed upon it by the Venetians, who ruled Zakynthos from 1484 to 1797.

==History==


===Ancient history===
The ancient Greek poet Homer mentioned Zakynthos in the &quot;Iliad&quot; and the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, stating that its first inhabitants were the son of King Dardanos of Arcadia, called Zakynthos, and his men. Before being renamed Zakynthos, the island was said to have been called Hyrie. Zakynthos was then conquered by King Arkesios of Kefalonia, and then by Odysseus from Ithaca. Zakynthos participated in the Trojan War and is listed in the Homeric Catalogue of Ships which, if accurate, describes the geopolitical situation in early Greece at some time between the Late Bronze Age and the eighth century BC. In the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, Homer mentions 20 nobles from Zakynthos among a total of 108 of Penelope&#x27;s suitors.

The Athenian military commander Tolmides concluded an alliance with Zakynthos during the First Peloponnesian War, sometime between 459 and 446 BC. In 430 BC, the Lacedaemonians led a force of about 1,000 heavy infantry, led by the Spartan admiral Cnemus, in an attack upon Zakynthos. Although the attackers managed to burn much of the surrounding countryside, the city itself refused to surrender and the attack ultimately failed. The Zakynthians are then enumerated among the autonomous allies of Athens in the disastrous Sicilian expedition. After the Peloponnesian War, Zakynthos seems to have passed under the supremacy of Sparta because in 374 BC, Timotheus, an Athenian commander, on his return from Kerkyra, landed some Zakynthian exiles on the island and assisted them in establishing a fortified post. These exiles must have belonged to the anti-Spartan party as the Zakynthian rulers applied for help to the Spartans who sent a fleet of 25 to the island.

The importance of this alliance for Athens was that it provided them with a source of tar. Tar is a more effective protector of ship planking than pitch (which is made from pine trees). The Athenian trireme fleet needed protection from rot, decay and the teredo, so this new source of tar was valuable to them. The tar was dredged up from the bottom of a lake (now known as Lake Keri) using leafy myrtle branches tied to the ends of poles. It was then collected in pots and could be carried to the beach and swabbed directly onto ship hulls. Alternatively, the tar could be shipped to the Athenian naval yard at Piraeus for storage.

Philip V of Macedon seized Zakynthos in the early 3rd century BC, when it was a member of the Aetolian League. In 211 BC, the Roman praetor Marcus Valerius Laevinus took the city of Zakynthos with the exception of the citadel. It was afterwards restored to Philip V of Macedon. The Roman general Marcus Fulvius Nobilior finally conquered Zakynthos in 191 BC for Rome. In the Mithridatic War, it was attacked by Archelaus, the general of Mithridates, but he was repulsed.

===Medieval period===
In 459, the island was plundered by the Vandals under Geiseric, who carried off 500 local aristocrats. Zakynthos appears to have been spared from the Slavic invasions of the 6th–7th centuries, as no Slavic names are attested on the island.

During the middle Byzantine period (7th–12th centuries), Zakynthos belonged to the Theme of Cephallenia, and the local bishopric was likewise a suffragan of Cephallenia (and later of the Metropolis of Corinth). In 880, the Aghlabids raided Zakynthos, but were defeated by the Byzantine navy under Nasar. Plundered by the Pisans in 1099, it was captured by Margaritus of Brindisi in 1185, and thereafter formed part of the County Palatine of Cephalonia and Zakynthos. A Latin bishopric was installed on the island, alongside the Orthodox one.

===Venetian period and modern era===
By 1460, and during the reign of Mehmed II, the Ottoman Turks eventually controlled most of the Peloponnese with the exception of the remaining Venetian-controlled towns of Argos, Nafplio, Monemvassia, Methoni, and Koroni. After the collapse of the Hexamilion, which was supposed to act as a defense across the Isthmus of Corinth, and hence, protect the Peloponnese, Leonardo III Tocco made an agreement with Venice to accept 10,000 refugees from this region. Leonardo III Tocco and his realm were increasingly vulnerable to Ottoman Turkish attacks. These refugees consisted of Greeks, Arvanites, and some Venetian officials.
Zakynthos was captured by the Ottoman Empire in 1478 but conquered by the Republic of Venice in 1482. It remained in Venetian hands, as part of the Venetian Ionian Islands, until the Fall of the Republic of Venice in 1797. It then passed successively under French rule, became part of the autonomous Septinsular Republic in 1800, and returned to the French in 1807. Seized by the British in 1809, it formed part of the United States of the Ionian Islands until the Union of the Ionian Islands with Greece in 1864.

====World War II====
During the Axis occupation of Greece, Mayor Loukas Karrer and Bishop Chrysostomos Dimitriou refused German orders to turn in a list of the members of the town&#x27;s Jewish community for deportation to the death camps. Instead they hid all (or most) of the town&#x27;s Jewish people in rural villages. According to some sources, all 275 Jews of Zakynthos survived the war. Both were later recognized as Righteous among the Nations by Yad Vashem. In contrast, over 80% of Greek Jews were deported to death camps and murdered in the Holocaust.

===Earthquakes===
Zakynthos was hit by a 7.3-magnitude earthquake on 12 August 1953, destroying most of the buildings on the island. Subsequently, all buildings have been strengthened to protect against further tremors. On 26 October 2018, a 6.4-magnitude earthquake south of the island caused no injuries, but damaged the local pier and a 13th-century monastery.

==Geography==
Zakynthos lies in the eastern part of the Ionian sea, around west of the Greek (Peloponnese) mainland. The island of Kefalonia lies to the north. It is the southernmost of the main group of the Ionian islands (not counting distant Kythira). Zakynthos is about long and wide, and covers an area of . Its coastline is approximately long. According to the 2011 census, the island has a population of 40,759. The highest point is Vrachionas, at .

Zakynthos has the shape of an arrowhead, with the &quot;tip&quot; (Cape Skinari) pointing northwest. The western half of the island is a mountainous plateau and the southwest coast consists mostly of steep cliffs. The eastern half is a densely populated fertile plain with long sandy beaches, interrupted with several isolated hills, notably Bochali which overlooks the city and the peninsula of Vasilikos in the northeast. The peninsulas of Vassilikos to the north and Marathia to the south enclose the wide and shallow bay of Laganas on the southeast part of the island.

The capital, which has the same name as the prefecture, is the town of Zakynthos. It lies on the eastern part of the northern coast. Apart from the official name, it is also called &quot;Chora&quot; (i.e. the Town, a common denomination in Greece when the name of the island itself is the same as the name of the principal town). The port of Zakynthos has a ferry connecting to the port of Kyllini on the mainland. Another ferry connects the village of Agios Nikolaos to Argostoli on Kefalonia. Minor uninhabited islands around Zakynthos included in the municipality and regional unit are: Marathonisi, Pelouzo, Agios Sostis in the Laganas bay, Agios Nikolaos near the eponymous harbor on the northern tip, and Agios Ioannis near Porto Vromi on the western coast.

===Flora and fauna===

The mild Mediterranean climate and plentiful winter rainfall endow the island with dense vegetation. The principal agricultural products are olive oil, currants, grapes and citrus fruit. The Zante currant is a small sweet seedless grape that is native to the island.

The Bay of Laganas is the site of the first National Marine Park and the prime nesting area for loggerhead sea turtles (&quot;Caretta caretta&quot;) in the Mediterranean.

===Climate===
Zakynthos has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csa&quot;) with hot, dry summers and mild to cool, rainy winters. Like most of the Ionian Islands, it receives sizeable amounts of precipitation during the winter while the summers are mostly hot and sunny. The average annual temperature stands at around while humidity is fairly high throughout the year, even during the summer months.

===Sights===
Famous landmarks include the Navagio beach, a cove on the northwest shore isolated by high cliffs and accessible only by boat. Numerous natural &quot;blue caves&quot; are cut into cliffs around Cape Skinari; they are accessible only by small boats, which are popular amongst tourists. Keri, on the south of the island, is a mountain village with a lighthouse. The whole western shore from Keri to Skinari contains rock formations including arches.
Northern and eastern shores feature numerous wide sandy beaches, some of which attract tourists in summer months. The largest resort is Laganas. Marathonissi islet (also known as &quot;Turtle Island&quot;) near Limni Keriou has tropical vegetation, turquoise waters, beaches, and sea caves. Bochali hill above the Zakynthos town contains a small Venetian castle.

==Administration==
Zakynthos is a separate regional unit of the Ionian Islands region, and the only municipality of the regional unit. The seat of administration is Zakynthos, the main town of the island.

===Regional unit===
As a part of the 2011 Kallikratis government reform, the regional unit Zakynthos was created out of the former prefecture Zakynthos (). The prefecture had the same territory as the present regional unit. In the same reform, the current municipality Zakynthos was created out of the six former municipalities:
*Zakynthos (city)
*Alykes
*Arkadioi
*Artemisia
*Elatia
*Laganas

==Population and demographics==

*1889: 44,070 (island), 18,906 (city)
*1896: 45,032 (island), 17,478 (city)
*1900: 42,000
*1907: 42,502
*1920: 37.482
*1940: 42,148
*1981: 30,011
*1991: 32,556 (island), 13,000 (city)
*2001: 38,596
*2011: 40,759
*2021: 40,508

In 2006, there were 507 births and 407 deaths. Zakynthos is one of the regions with the highest population growth in Greece. It is also one of the only three prefectures (out of 54) in which the rural population has a positive growth rate. In fact, the rural population&#x27;s growth rate is higher than that of the urban population in Zakynthos. Out of the 507 births, 141 were in urban areas and 366 were in rural areas. Out of the 407 deaths, 124 were in urban areas and 283 were in rural areas.

==Culture==

===Literature===

Since Zakynthos was under the rule of the Venetian Republic, it had closer contact with Western literary trends than other areas inhabited by Greek people.

An early literary work from the island is the &quot;Rimada&quot;, a 16th-century romance in verse about Alexander the Great. Notable early writers include Tzanes Koroneos, author of &quot;Andragathemata of Bouas&quot;, a work of historical fiction; Nikolaos Loukanis, a 16th-century Renaissance humanist; Markos Defaranas (1503–1575), possibly the author of the &quot;Rimada&quot;; Pachomios Roussanos (1508–1553), a scholar and theologian; and Antonio Catiforo (1685–1763), a grammarian and satirist.

Towards the end of the 18th century, the so-called Heptanese School of Literature developed, consisting mainly of lyrical and satirical poetry in the vein of Romanticism prevalent throughout Europe at the time. It also contributed to the development of modern Greek theatre. An important poet of this school was Zakynthian Dionysios Solomos; another was Nikolaos Koutouzis, who also figures prominently in the Heptanese School of Painting. Others include Georgios Tertsetis (1800–1873), politician, poet, and historian.

The 1998 novel &#x27;Fugitive Pieces&#x27; by Canadian author Anne Michaels includes a section set on Zakynthos during the Nazi occupation. The young Jewish narrator, Jakob Beer, is hidden in a rural home. He notes that while he enjoyed the luxury of a room, &#x27;thousands were stuffed into baking stoves, sewers, garbage bins. In the crawlspaces of double ceilings, in stables, pigsties, chicken coops&#x27;. The narrative refers to Mayor Karrer and Archbishop Chrysostomos&#x27;s refusal to collaborate with the Germans.

==Transport==
The island is covered by a network of roads, particularly the flat eastern part, with main routes linking the capital with Volimes in the north, Keri in the south, and the Vassiliki peninsula in the west. The road between Volimes and Lithakia connects the western half of the island.

The island has one airport, Zakynthos International Airport, on former GR-35, offering connecting flights with other Greek airports and numerous tourist charters. Opened in 1972, it is located from Zakynthos.

Zakynthos also features two ports, the main port located in the capital, and another in the village of Agios Nikolaos. From the main port there is a connection to the port of Kyllini, which is the usual place of arrival to the island by sea from the mainland. From the port of Agios Nikolaos there is a connection to the island of Kefalonia.

==Science==
Ionian University&#x27;s Department of Environment has been located on Zakynthos since 2003. It has developed laboratory and field station infrastructures in Zakynthos and the Strofades islets.

Freshwater resources on Zakynthos are limited, and as a result a Greek-Norwegian educational collaboration is being established on the island. Science Park Zakynthos is a collaboration between the Technological Educational Institute of the Ionian Islands (TEI), the Norwegian University of Life Sciences (UMB), and the Therianos Villas and Therianos Family Farm on Zakynthos.

==Notable people==

Among the most famous Zakynthians is the 19th-century poet Dionysios Solomos, whose statue adorns the main town square. The Italian poet Ugo Foscolo was born in Zakynthos: he wrote the sonnet &quot;A Zacinto&quot; dedicated to the island. Antonios Komoutos, second head of state &quot;Prince&quot; of the Septinsular Republic originated from Zakynthos. Early 19th-century poet and playwright Elizabeth Moutzan-Martinegou, the first prominent modern Greek female writter, was born on the island. Andreas Vesalius, famous Renaissance surgeon and anatomist, died on Zakynthos after being shipwrecked while making a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. His body is thought to have been buried on the island but the site has been lost.

==Tourism==
The Museum of Solomos and Eminent Zakynthians, located on St Mark&#x27;s plaza, includes local art from the 18th and 19th centuries, as well as sculptures, musical instruments contemporary to the eminent Zakynthians, and ceramics. In particular, it features Dionysios Solomos and Andreas Kalvos.

Since the mid-1980s, Zakynthos has become a hub for 18-to-30-year-old tourists, leading particularly to Laganas (formerly a quiet village) becoming a hotbed of clubbing, nightclubs, bars and restaurants.

==International relations==
Zakynthos is twinned with:

<doc id="309760" wikidata="Q496810" url="?curid=309760" title="Bangladesh Nationalist Party">
<text>The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (), popularly abbreviated as BNP (), is a major political party in Bangladesh. Founded on 1 September 1978 by former president of Bangladesh, Ziaur Rahman with a view of uniting people with a nationalist ideology, the BNP later became one of the two dominant parties in Bangladesh, along with its archrival, the Awami League. Initially a big tent centrist party, it later moved towards more right-wing politics.

Known as the &quot;Party of the Freedom Fighters of the Battlefield&quot;, BNP was founded by Ziaur Rahman after the presidential election of 1978 and remained in its leadership until his assassination in 1981. Following Rahman&#x27;s assassination, his widow, Khaleda Zia, took over leadership of the party and presided as chairperson until her imprisonment, in 2018. Since then, Tarique Rahman, the son of Rahman and Zia, has served as acting chairperson and has run the affairs of the party from London.

Since its creation, the BNP has won the 1979 election and 1981 presidential election as well as the 1991, February 1996 and 2001 general elections. Ziaur Rahman-led governments formed under the semi-presidential system and the parliamentary republics were led by Khaleda Zia, who served as prime minister. Begum Zia, who served as the party&#x27;s chairperson from 1983, became the first woman prime minister of Bangladesh and the second female prime minister of a Muslim-majority country after Pakistan&#x27;s Benazir Bhutto. The party holds the record of being the largest opposition in the history of parliamentary elections of the country with 116 seats in the general election of June 1996.

Begum Khaleda Zia is currently the chairperson of the party, with Tarique Rahman as the senior vice-chairman and Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir as the secretary-general. The party tends to consulate votes based on complete independence of Bangladeshi territory and a mix of Bengali and Islamic customs. It is often known to be pro-global with being very pro-China or pro-Southeast Asia and pro-Middle East to capture markets on foreign investment and remittance.

==History==
===JaGoDal===

On 22 February 1978, a new party, Jatiyatabadi Ganatantrik Dal (JaGoDal), was formed with Justice Abdus Sattar as the coordinator. Most of the prominent figures were from the advisory council that was running the country at that time. JAGODAL was the first attempt to create a platform for the country&#x27;s nationalists. Major General (retd) M. Majid ul Haq, Professor Syed Ali Ahsan, Shamsul Alam Chowdhury, A.Z.M. Enayetullah Khan, M. Hamidullah Khan, Jakaria Chowdhury, Professor Dr. M. R. Khan, and Saifur Rahman were prominent figures. JAGODAL was dissolved on 28 August 1978 to consolidate its membership under the Jatiyatabadi Front.

===Jatiyatabadi Front===
On 1 May 1978, the Jatiyatabadi Front or Nationalist Front was formed with Ziaur Rahman as the front&#x27;s chief, which JAGODAL joined soon after its formation. A major portion of NAP (Bhashani) joined the front as well with Mashiur Rahman. The election symbol of NAP (Bhashani), sheaf of paddy, would become the symbol of the BNP. Shah Azizur Rahman with some of his colleagues from Muslim League. Kazi Zafar Ahmed and a faction of United Peoples Party, Maulana Matin with his Labour Party, and minority leader Rashraj Mandal with Tafsili Jati Federation also joined.

Ziaur Rahman was their candidate for the presidential election of 3 June 1978. Ziaur Rahman won the election, defeating M. A. G. Osmani of Ganatantrik Oikya Jote (United Democratic Alliance) which was backed by the Bangladesh Awami League.

===Formation of BNP===
After the presidential election of 1978, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) was established on 1 September. The newly established party soon emerged as a &quot;hotchpotch&quot; of leftists, rightists, opportunists, and Pakistan-era establishmenterians.

The constitution of the party was drafted within 21 days of the formation with 76 members with Ziaur Rahman as the chief convener, M. Hamidullah Khan as the Executive Secretary and Dr. A. Q. M. Badruddoza Chowdhury was appointed as the Secretary-General.

The BNP formed its first government after the 1979 Bangladesh general election. The first session of the parliament was on 2 April 1979. It elected Shah Azizur Rahman as prime minister and leader of the parliament. Mirza Ghulam Hafiz was elected as the speaker of the parliament. Asaduzzaman Khan from the Awami League became the leader of the opposition.

During this time, it attracted a large pool of supporters and activists who joined the newly formed student wing and youth wing. After the formation of the government, the first executive committee of the party was declared. A national standing committee was formed as the highest decision-making forum of the party with 12 members.

A youth wing was formed in September 1978 which was named Bangladesh Jatiyatabadi Jubo Dal with Abul Kashem as its chief convener. The Dhaka unit convener was Saifur Rahman. Within a couple of months, the central executive committee of Jubo Dal was declared with Abul Kashem and Saifur Rahman as the President and general secretary respectively. Mirza Abbas became the Dhaka unit President with Kamruzzaman Ayat Ali as the Secretary-General.

===1981–1982===
On 30 May 1981, the founder of the party President Ziaur Rahman was assassinated in the Chittagong Circuit House by a small group of military officials. After the assassination of Ziaur Rahman, large crowds started protesting in major cities like Dhaka and Chittagong. The funeral of Ziaur Rahman became a huge event with the participation of millions of people in Dhaka.

In the 1981 Bangladeshi presidential election, Abdus Sattar was elected. He formed the National Security Council to involve the Bangladesh Armed Forces. Meanwhile, Vice President Mirza Nurul Huda resigned from his post in March 1982.

====Military coup d&#x27;état, 1982====
Army Chief Hussain Muhammad Ershad thwarted the elected government of Justice Sattar on 24 March 1982 and replaced him with Justice A. F. M. Ahsanuddin Chowdhury. The BNP was thrown out of power. Many of its leaders were imprisoned, including former Minister S.A. Bari, Saifur Rahman, Habibullah Khan, Tanvir Ahmed Siddiqui, Atauddin Khan, Jamal Uddin Ahmed, K.M. Obaidur Rahman, Abul Hasnat, and Moudud Ahmed. 233 leaders of BNP were arrested from March to July 1982.

====7-Party Alliance====
From 1983, Begum Khaleda Zia became the de facto decision-maker of the party. Under her leadership, the BNP formed a new anti-government alliance against the autocratic Ershad regime. It was named after the number of parties with it, 7-Party Alliance.

BNP launched a massive anti-government movement after co-ordination with Awami League-led 15-Party Alliance in September 1983. The 7-Party Alliance arranged a mass gathering and called a nationwide strike on 1 November 1983. The strike had successful results. After that, the alliance called to surround the Secretariat on 28 November 1983 along with the 15-Party Alliance. Thousands of BNP activists led by then Executive Secretary (later designated Office Secretary) M. Hamidullah Khan surrounded the secretariat building at Paltan and broke a large hole in the southern corner of the boundary wall of the building. The police retaliated with indiscriminate firing of live bullets. M. Hamidullah Khan was arrested on 3 November in the afternoon from his residence at Dhaka Cantonment. A ban on political activities was imposed that night and Begum Khaleda Zia was kept under house arrest. The government was severely shaken at the core. A long curfew and ban on politics was imposed.

On 29 February 1984, Ershad declared that the ban on politics would be lifted on 26 March and on 27 May, both the presidential and national elections would be held. The 7-Party Alliance asked for the national election before the presidential election. After lifting the ban, Khaleda Zia attended an extended meeting of the party on 1 April, where she was made the acting chairperson of the party. In May, the Chairperson Justice Sattar resigned and Khaleda Zia was made the chairperson of the party.

Under the leadership of Khaleda Zia, the first major step BNP took was to expel leaders like Shah Azizur Rahman, Moudud Ahmed, AKM Maidul Islam, Abdul Alim, and Barrister Sultan Ahmed Chowdhury from the party. These leaders formed a committee with Shah Aziz as the President and AKM Maidul Islam as the general secretary. This faction later joined the Jatiya Front and Jatiya Party.

====Attack on Begum Khaleda Zia====
On 23 September 1984, while addressing a rally in Bogra, 10-12 handmade grenades were charged at the rally and some of them were aimed at the stage, where Khaleda Zia was giving her speech. Khaleda Zia narrowly escaped injury while eleven members of her party received severe injuries. A nationwide strike was called in protest at this attack on 22 and 27 December. The government imposed a ban on political activities on those days to foil the strike, but it was largely ignored. Two people including a student leader from Bangladesh Jatiotabadi Chatra Dal died when police fired on a crowd on 22 December.

====Upazila election 1985====
The government amid protests, held upazila elections on 15 May 1985 in 251 upazilas and on 20 May in 209. The election was marked by rigging, stuffing, snatching of ballots and electoral fraud. Ershad&#x27;s newly formed Janadal got 190 candidates as victors. Though, BNP had struggles because of government repression, it got 46 of its leaders as upazila chairmen while the Awami League fared worse with 41 upazila chairmen.

====Formation of student alliance====
In 1985, BNP&#x27;s student wing Bangladesh Jatiotabadi Chatra Dal formed Shongrami Chatra Jote with Chatra League (Awranga), Chatra League (Pradhan) and five other student organisations and started its resistance against Ershad.

===General election 1986===
In March 1986, Ershad declared that a national election would be held on 26 April. Both the 7-Party Alliance led by BNP and the 15-Party Alliance led by the Awami League declared a boycott of the election on 17 March. Both called a joint rally on 21 March and a nationwide strike on 22 March as the immediate program to thwart the forthcoming election.

The night before the nationwide strike on 22 March, the Awami League called a meeting of the 15-Party Alliance but Sheikh Hasina refused to take part in the meeting. In the meeting, the majority of the parties including the Awami League opined in favour of the election. General Khalilur Rahman of Awami League maintained close contact with the army headquarters during the meeting that night. Sheikh Hasina was discussing with General Khalil periodically.

On the final hours of 21 March 1986, Sheikh Hasina announced that the Awami League and her alliance would participate in the election. Five parties of the alliance parted ways from the Awami League after the announcement and decided to boycott the election. BNP and the 7-Party Alliance with the newly formed 5-Party alliance of leftists started campaigning against the election while the Awami League and Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami joined the election.

The election was largely boycotted. BNP Chairperson mobilised a large pool of political parties and their leaders behind her to boycott the election. Apart from the BNP-led 7-Party Alliance and leftist 5-Party Alliance, 17 more parties including BNP (Shah Aziz), Samajbadi Dal (Nirmal Sen), Democratic League (Moshtaq), Democratic League (Oli Ahad), Islamic Democratic League, Islami Andolon (M. A. Jalil), Janata Party, Jatiya Ganatantrik Party, Labour Party (Maolana Matin), Muslim League (Kamruzzaman), Progatishil Ganatantrik Shakti and so on.

Khaleda Zia reiterated that the BNP would participate only if:

# The fundamental rights are restored
# All political prisoners are released
# All convictions of politicians by the military courts are cancelled

The anti-election alliance under BNP called for a nationwide strike on election day. Unrest, voting fraud and malpractices marked the election day according to the opposition parties. Both the Awami League and Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami conceded a humiliating defeat in the election.

General Hussain Muhammad Ershad got himself elected on 15 October 1986. Prior to the election, Khaleda Zia was put under house arrest on 13 October.

In a joint declaration, the two alliances called for &quot;Siege Dhaka&quot; program on 10 November 1987. The government imposed a ban on public gatherings ahead of the program which was defied on the day and during the program, the capital of the country virtually went under the control of the opposition alliances. This incident infuriated the opposition and a nationwide protest was called on the following day. The government came hard-handed and both Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina were put under house arrest on 11 October. Both the parties and their partners in the movement declared frequent nationwide strikes for the next days until the end of the year.

====1988 Bangladesh General Election====
BNP was determined not to join the poll under the Ershad regime and decided to boycott the general election of 1988 after the abolishment of the previous parliament. The election was held on 3 March without the participation of any popular party or alliance rather a combined opposition was led by ASM Abdur Rab. BNP called a nationwide on Election Day and declared they would resist the election.

====Organizational reformations====
On the advice of Dr. Badruddoza Chowdhury, BNP chief Begum Zia on 21 June 1988, suspended the national standing committee and executive committee on the party for various reasons including the failures of strengthening the party of leaders. During this opportunity, former military officers were also removed from leadership positions within the party. M. Hamidullah Khan was relieved from his post as Executive Secretary. On 3 July 1988, Barrister Abdus Salam Talukder, a distinguished lawyer, was assigned with the post of Secretary General of the party instead of KM Obaidur Rahman. Soon after the removal of Obaidur, he with Jamal Uddin Ahmed and Abul Hasnat formed a new party with the same name. On 17 July of the same year, Shah Azizur Rahman dissolved the BNP faction with him and joined the party with his followers on 26 August. Barrister Abdus Salam Talukder restructured the BNP, making it a stronger political platform that thrived through a critical time with a goal to topple Ershad&#x27;s regime.

===1990 Mass Uprising===

The movement against Ershad started gaining momentum in October 1990. The BNP-led 7-party alliance, the Awami League-led 8-party alliance and the Leftist 5-party alliance started a movement to usurp Ershad on 10 October 1990 and declared a nationwide strike on that day. The strike claimed 5 lives, including three BNP activists who were rallying in front of the central office of the Jatiya Party when the Jatiya Party cadres opened fire on the crowd.

On 28 November, the opposition parties including BNP and its student wing defied the curfew and state of emergency and came out with large processions. The curfew and state of emergency was the last resort for Ershad which became ineffective by the end of November 1990. On 3 December, the protests became more violent and many died. Bombs were hurled at the Sena Kalyan Sangstha building at Motijheel. From 27 November to 3 December, more than fifty protesters died. On 4 December, the mass uprising took place and Ershad declared his resignation.

====Students movement====
Dhaka University Central Students&#x27; Union (DUCSU) which has always been a centre of all popular movements in the history of Bangladesh came under the control of Bangladesh Jatiotabadi Chatra Dal after the election of 3 June 1990. The Amanullah Aman-Khairul Kabir Khokan panel backed by Chatra Dal won all the posts and took the lead of the students&#x27; movement in the University of Dhaka campus.

The Chatra Dal-led DUCSU committee allied with all existing student groups on the campus, Sarbadaliya Chatra Oikya Parishad (All-party Students Alliance Council) and staged a demonstration on 1 October 1990. The protests turned violent after the police firing on a rally of Chatra Dal on 10 October that claimed the life of Naziruddin Jehad, a Chatra Dal leader from Sirajganj who came to Dhaka to join the rally against Ershad.

The series of student protests compelled the Ershad regime to think about a safe exit.

====Solidarity of teachers====
On 7 December 1989, the BNP-supported White panel of teachers got the highest number of Deans elected from their panel including Professor Anwarullah Chowdhury, Professor S M Faiz, Assistant Professor M. Anwar Hossain and Associate Professor Humayun Ahmed.

The pro-BNP White panel of teachers, which dominated the Dhaka University Teachers Association, declared an all-out movement against the Ershad regime in 1990. All the teachers decided to resign from their posts on 29 November and confirmed their decision of not returning to classes until the fall of Ershad. The firm reaction from the teachers jeopardised the Ershad regime.

After the fall of Ershad, because of the commitment to the national interest the White panel of teachers won a decisive victory on 24 December 1990 in the election of Dhaka University Teachers Association once again with Professor Anwarullah Chowdhury as the President of the association with Professor M. Anwar Hossain as the general secretary.

===Caretaker government (2006–2008)===

The military-backed government promised to tackle the longstanding problems of corruption, filing charges against more than 160 politicians, civil servants and businessmen in 2007. Among those charged were Khaleda Zia and her two sons, as well as Sheikh Hasina, leader of the Awami League.

The Bangladesh Election Commission invited Hafizuddin&#x27;s faction, rather than Khaleda Zia&#x27;s, to participate in talks, effectively recognising the former as the legitimate BNP. Khaleda Zia challenged this in court, but her appeal was rejected on 10 April 2008. After her release later that year, Zia was restored to her position as party leader.

In the 2008 Bangladesh general election, the 4-party alliance led by BNP won 33 seats out of 299 constituencies, of which the BNP alone got 30.

===5th National Council, 2009===

After sanctions by the Election Commission, the party held country-wide events for local leaders to play an active role in the national party. The BNP National Council empowered re-elected party chairperson Khaleda Zia to pick other members for the National Executive Committee and Standing Committee. It elected her eldest son, Tarique Rahman, to the powerful post as Senior vice-chairman, in a &quot;move apparently designed to smooth his path to the party helm.&quot;

===Post-election campaigns (2012 – present)===
After several movements in a period of severe political unrest between 2012 and 2014 to prevent the ruling party from holding the 10th general election in January 2014 without a neutral caretaker government, Khaleda led BNP and its allies in a boycott of the election. Incidents of violence were reported on polling day including the bombing of election centres, which the BNP and its allies were accused of. Over 100 people were killed in the 2016 Union Parishad Election in violent clashes between Awami League and BNP supporters. In 2016, the BNP announced its new National Standing Committee, in which Khaleda retained her position as chairperson. New members were recruited while some older members were removed, and various new strategies for party operation were formulated. In May 2017, Khaleda revealed BNP&#x27;s Vision 2030 to gain public support for the next general elections. However the ruling Awami League government denounced Vision 2030 as an act of plagiarism of Awami League&#x27;s Vision 2021 which they used in the ninth general election and claimed most of the targets in the Visions were fulfilled by Awami League, thus declaring BNP&#x27;s Vision 2030 as unoriginal. BNP also announced it will hold processions to hold the 11th general elections under a neutral government. This renewed tensions between BNP and Awami League.

On 8 February 2018, Khaleda Zia and her son Tarique Rahman as per court verdict, were jailed for 5 and 10 years respectively due to involvement in the Zia Charitable Trust corruption case. While Tarique was in exile, Khaleda was imprisoned in the old Dhaka Central Jail on Nazimuddin Road. In protest, BNP held nationwide demonstrations, which were foiled by a well-prepared police force across the nation. A large number of BNP activists were arrested during clashes with the police during the protests against Khaleda&#x27;s imprisonment.

On 9 October 2018, the Bangladesh government formed a nine-member group to detect and monitor rumors on social media sites such as Facebook. Tarana Halim said the group&#x27;s goal was to ensure that &quot;people [have] the right information only.&quot; Two months later, approximately 30 accounts linked to the spreading of fictitious news reports regarding the BNP were blocked from Facebook and Twitter.

===Jatiya Oikya Front===
After the jailing of chairperson Begum Khaleda Zia, BNP expedited the process of forging a national unity with prominent leaders of the country. In October 2018, the party formally announced its joining of Jatiya Oikya Front with Dr. Kamal Hossain at its forefront.

There was controversy in the run-up to the elections surrounding the nomination of banned Jamaat candidates under the BNP banner. In 2013, the Jamaat-e-Islami was banned from registering and therefore contesting in elections by the High Court, citing their charter in violation of the constitution. However, 25 Jamaat candidates ran in the election, with 22 nominations for BNP and 3 running as independents. An investigation was launched but on 23 December the Election Commission Secretary Helaluddin Ahmed said they had examined the related law and &quot;there is no scope for rejecting the Jamaat leaders&#x27; candidacy at this moment.&quot; On 26 December, just days before the election, Jatiya Oikya Front leader Kamal Hossain expressed his regret about Jamaat&#x27;s involvement in the elections under his alliance, claiming &quot;had I known [that Jamaat leaders will be given BNP tickets] I would not have been part of it.&quot; The media, however, had reported at the end of November that this was happening.

=== 2024 general election ===

On 26 March 2020, BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia&#x27;s prison sentence was suspended for six months amid the COVID-19 pandemic, and she was granted a conditional release because she received medical treatment within the country and did not travel abroad. The six-month suspension has been granted for a total of six consecutive times, with the most recent one being on 18 September 2022. Since Zia&#x27;s release, the BNP campaigned for her unconditional release and for the ruling government to allow her to travel abroad.

In preparation for the upcoming 2024 general election, the BNP launched a series of rallies which advocated for the resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and the return of the caretaker government. During a rally held in Dhaka on 10 December 2022, seven BNP lawmakers announced their resignation from the current government in demands of the dissolution of parliament, the formation of a new election commission, and allowing the election to be held under a neutral caretaker government.

=== 2024 student protests ===
BNP actively supported the 2024 Bangladesh quota reform movement. Later, it joined the Non-cooperation movement against the Sheikh Hasina government.

==Ideology==
Bangladesh Nationalist Party is a big tent party that has been cited as being on the centre, centre-right, or right-wing of the political spectrum, with ideological base combining conservatism, national conservatism, and economic liberalism. Party&#x27;s official website states its founding principles to be–&quot;full faith and trust in Allah&quot;, Bangladeshi nationalism, democracy and socialism &quot;in the sense of economic and social justice&quot;. However, political experts such as Professor Sirajul Islam Chowdhury, a former professor of Dhaka University, thinks that BNP&#x27;s ideological definition came only after the establishment of the party.

BNP was originally formed when a political vacuum was occurring in Bangladesh, mainly resulting from the coups–countercoups of 1975. As a result, after the withdrawal of military rule, various politicians, regardless of party &amp; ideological affiliation, joined the newly formed BNP to return to mainstream politics. Many of them had contradictory ideologies to each other, including politicians from various Islamist parties to &quot;pro-China left and NAP&quot;. Canadian-Bangladeshi analyst Mir Aftabuddin Ahmed called early BNP &quot;a coalition of convenience rather than ideology&quot;. Many political experts, including Ahmed, believe that since BNP was born after Awami League was overthrown, the BNP was an attempt to establish a position in the areas where Awami League was moderate.

Concerning the ideology, Syed Manjurul Islam, a professor of the English department at Dhaka University, stated, 

According to the political analyst Maruf Mallick, BNP was founded as a centre-left, liberal and social democratic political party and the party&#x27;s early political and economic policy was inspired by the Western European social liberal politics.

Senior BNP leader Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain said about BNP&#x27;s ideology, 

===Nationalism===
Bangladeshi nationalism is the central ideology of the party. It was adopted from the 19-point program, which declared, &quot;The sovereignty and independence of Bangladesh, golden fruits of the historic liberation struggle, is our sacred trust and inviolable right.&quot; According to its founder Ziaur Rahman, the &quot;Bangladeshi&quot; identity, based on its history, traditions, culture and geographical territory, is different from the neighbouring nations and unique to itself. BNP&#x27;s declaration supports a populism based on nationalism.

===Economy===
The party fiscally calls itself socialist, but practically BNP promotes economic liberalism and supports a free-market economy with limited intervention. Rahman believed that the previous socialist-influenced economy had been in a poor shape because of &quot;years of colonial-style exploitation&quot;. To abate the deteriorating conditions, a revamp of the economic system is required. According to Mubashar Hasan, this new economic system was primarily an &quot;outline for a capitalist system&quot;. Despite being located to the right-of-centre, founding principles of the party included social and economic justice in light of socialism. According to Mallick, early BNP was inspired by the European social liberal policies which supported equal distribution of wealth and social welfare but opposed strong economic regulatory policies of its predecessor Awami League.

The party claim to have practiced &quot;people&#x27;s democracy&quot;, an idea derived from Marxism–Leninism allowing multi-party democracy for obtaining socialism, possibly influenced by the leftist politicians of the party.

===Religion===
BNP&#x27;s position on religion remains complicated and changed over time. The founding manifesto of the BNP claims that the people of Bangladesh want to &quot;...see that all-out faith and confidence in the almighty Allah, democracy, nationalism&quot;. Although the party does not officially call itself Islamic, its official website states that the party aims to &quot;preserve the age old human values of the Bangladeshi people through the teaching of Islam–religion of the majority of Bangladeshi people and other religions&quot;. Upon taking power, Ziaur Rahman introduced a state-sponsored Islamization process that had a significant impact on Bangladeshi society and culture. At the same time, the party also promotes religious freedom and tolerance as a component of Bangladeshi nationalism. Many founding leaders of the party were non-Muslims. Ziaur Rahman rejected theocracy as the governing system for Bangladesh. Moreover, in 2023, BNP leader Iqbal Hasan Mahmud Tuku claimed the party to be secular. Furthermore, in January 2025, BNP General Secretary Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir noted that politics is a specific field which has no direct relation with the religious scriptures like Gita, Bible or Quran.

According to Mallick, BNP is not a religion-based party in a traditional sense and it has a moderate stance on religion. BNP&#x27;s stance for conservatism represents &quot;a mixture of traditional Bengali customs and moderate Islam&quot;. But still, due to the party&#x27;s sympathy for Islam, Islamist parties like Jamaat-e-Islami have come to view it as a more comfortable coalition partner than its counterpart Awami League. Mir Aftabuddin Ahmed opined: 

According to a report from &quot;Dhaka Tribune&quot;, as the reactionary leaders have started to dominate, BNP is moving away from its traditional liberal–centrist stance towards a more right-wing stance.

==Policies==
===Domestic policy===
===Foreign policy===

The main objective of BNP&#x27;s foreign policy is to maintain good relationships with the Western world, the Muslim World and the Third World, as well as to maintain a balanced relationship with India. BNP has been described as Indosceptic many times. After Ziaur Rahman became the president, his government started to distance themselves from India. Some sources say that the Indo-Bangladesh relations were at their worst in memory during Rahman&#x27;s presidency. Anti-Indo-Soviet axis foreign policy was initiated. On 11 December 1991, in an interview with &quot;The Hindu&quot;, then Prime Minister Khaleda Zia said, &quot;We do not want to see the rise of any major power in this region, because it will disturb the peace, stability and balance in this region&quot;, here she meant India as the major power.

In 2024, some of the BNP leaders, including Ruhul Kabir Rizvi, joined the &quot;Boycott India&quot; campaign. In August 2024, BNP secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir expressed a desire to &quot;move past previous differences and collaborate&quot;, assuring India that the BNP would not permit activities that would threaten India&#x27;s security, but stated that relations would decline if India did not extradite Hasina.

Ziaur Rahman&#x27;s government focused on the strengthening of its relationship with the Muslim world and the Arab world. His government amended the Constitution adding articles 25(1) &amp; 25(2) declaring the establishment of brotherhood with the Muslim countries. Until he died in 1981, Rahman regularly visited Muslim countries. Following his predecessor Mostaq, his government continued the close relationship with Pakistan. His government abandoned secularism and socialism in favour of building good ties with the Muslim world.

Besides, Ziaur Rahman facilitated the investment of Western capital in the country by taking liberal economic measures. His government improved relations with United States and China.

BNP government&#x27;s foreign policy during the second premiership of Khaleda Zia between 2001 and 2006 was called &quot;Look East Foreign Policy&quot;. In 2002, Prime Minister Zia visited Thailand, Myanmar and China and met with the leaders of those countries to expand Bangladesh&#x27;s foreign policy to the east.

<text>Kythira ( ; ), also transliterated as Cythera, Kythera and Kithira, is an island in Greece lying opposite the south-eastern tip of the Peloponnese peninsula. It is traditionally listed as one of the seven main Ionian Islands, although it is distant from the main group. Administratively, it belongs to the Islands regional unit, which is part of the Attica region, despite its distance from the Saronic Islands, around which the rest of Attica is centered. As a municipality, it includes the island of Antikythera to the south.

The island is strategically located between the Greek mainland and Crete, and from ancient times until the mid-19th century was a crossroads of merchants, sailors, and conquerors. As such, it has had a long and varied history and has been influenced by many civilizations and cultures. This is reflected in its architecture (a blend of traditional, Aegean and Venetian elements), as well as the traditions and customs, influenced by centuries of coexistence of the Greek, and Venetian cultures.

==Administration==
Kythira and the nearby island of Antikythira were separate municipalities until they were merged at the 2011 local government reform; the two islands are now municipal units of Kythira municipality. The municipality has an area of 300.023 km2, the municipal unit 279.593 km2. The province of Kythira () was one of the provinces of Lakonia, then of Argolis and Korinthia, then of Attica Prefecture from 1929 to 1964. Then from 1964 to 1972 Kythira became part of the newly establishment Piraeus Prefecture and after dissolution of Piraeus prefecture returned to Attica Prefecture as part of Piraeus prefecture (Νομαρχία). It was abolished in 2006. From 2011 it is part of the Islands regional unit of Attica region.

==History==

===Pre-classical and ancient===
There are archaeological remains from the Helladic period, contemporary with the Minoans. There is archaeological evidence of Kythiran trade as far as Egypt and Mesopotamia.

Kythira had a Phoenician colony in the early archaic age; the sea-snail which produces Tyrian purple is native to the island. Xenophon refers to a Phoenician Bay in Kythira (&quot;Hellenica&quot; 4.8.7, probably Avlemonas Bay on the eastern side of the island). The archaic Greek city of Kythira was at Scandea on Avlemonas; its ruins have been excavated. Its acropolis, now Palicastro (Palaeocastron, &quot;Old Fort&quot;), has the temple of Aphrodite Ourania, who may well represent a Phoenician cult of Astarte.

In classical times, Kythira was part of the territory of several larger city-states. Sparta took the island from Argos early in the sixth century BC, and ruled it under a &quot;kytherodíkes&quot; (kυθηροδίκης, &quot;judge on Kythira&quot;), in Thucydides&#x27; time [4,53,3]; Athens occupied it three times when at war with Sparta (in 456 BC during her first war with Sparta and the Peloponnesians; from 424 to 410 BC, through most of the great Peloponnesian War; and from 393 to 387/386BC, during the Corinthian War against Spartan dominance) and used it both to support her trade and to raid Laconia.

Kythira was independent, and issued her own coins in 195 BC after the Achaean defeat of Sparta. In Augustus&#x27; time, it was again subject to Sparta, being the property of Gaius Julius Eurycles, who was both a Spartan magnate and a Roman citizen.

By this time, the Greek cities were in practice subject to the Roman Empire. Kythira continued to exist under the Roman Empire and its Byzantine successor state for centuries. Christianity is attested from the fourth century AD, the time of Constantine; according to her legend, Saint Elessa came from Laconia to convert the island.

===Medieval and modern===


Kythira is not mentioned in the literary sources for centuries after its conversion; in the period of Byzantine weakness at the end of the seventh century, it might have been exposed to attacks from both the Slavic tribes who raided the mainland and from Arab pirates from the sea. Archaeological evidence suggests the island was abandoned about 700 AD.

When Saint Theodore of Cythera led a resettlement after the Byzantine reconquest of Crete in 962, he found the island occupied only by wandering bands of hunters. He established a great monastery at Paliochora; a town grew up around it, largely populated from Laconia.

When the Byzantine Empire was divided among the conquerors of the Fourth Crusade, the Republic of Venice took her share, three eighths of the whole, as the Greek islands, Kythira among them. She established a coast patrol on Kythira and Antikythera to protect her trade route to Constantinople; Kythira was one of the islands Venice continued to hold despite the Greek reconquest of Constantinople and the Turkish presence all over the Near East. During the Venetian domination the island was known as Cerigo.

Kythirans still talk about the destruction and looting of Paliochora by Barbarossa; it has become an intrinsic part of the Kytherian folklore. One can easily accept the stories of locals by noticing the number of monasteries embedded in the rocky hillsides to avoid destruction by the pirates.

Barbary pirates ranged across the Mediterranean waters, raiding ships, coasts and islands, taking booty and slaves for the Barbary slave trade. Kythira was at the mercy of Barbary pirates due to its strategic location in the Mediterranean. In order to intercept merchant vessels, islands along the trade routes were of course more interesting for pirates. In the 17th century the small islands like Sapientza (Kalamatas) south of Messinia (district in south-western part of the Peloponnese), Cerigo (Kythira) south of the south-eastern tip of the Peloponnese, and along the coast of Asia minor, the then deserted islands of Fourni southwest of Samos, and the island of Psara, west of Chios, were all pirate bases.

When Napoleon put an end to the Venetian Republic in 1797, Kythira was among the islands incorporated in that most distant department of France, called Mer-Égée. Kythira shared a common destiny with the other Ionian islands during the turbulent Napoleonic era, and is still regarded as one of them; it was counted as one of the Cyclades in antiquity.

In 1799, the Ionian islands became the Septinsular Republic, nominally under Ottoman suzerainty, but in practice dominated by Imperial Russia. In 1807, the French recaptured the islands, before they were captured again by the British in 1809, who set up the United States of the Ionian Islands, a British protectorate. The British ruled over the islands for nearly half a century; under British rule, they were governed by a High Commissioner who was granted both legislative and executive powers. During the period of British rule, the city was known as Carigo or Cerigo, a name it had been acquired under Venetian control. After a long period of turbulence in the colony, which even eminent Commissioners as William Ewart Gladstone who served in the role for three weeks in the winter of 1859 failed to resolve, the British discussion whether they were a waste of money or a vital overseas possession ended with the cession of the Ionian Islands, including Kythira, to the new King George I of Greece, who was brother-in-law to the Prince of Wales.

The chief town of the island, Kythira (or Chora, &quot;village&quot;), houses the Historical Archives of Kythira, the second largest in the Ionian islands, after Corfu.

==Geography==
Kythira has a land area of ; it is located at the southwestern exit from the Aegean Sea, behind Cape Malea. The rugged terrain is a result of prevailing winds from the surrounding seas which have shaped its shores into steep rocky cliffs with deep bays. The island has many beaches, of various composition and size; only half of them can be reached by road through the mountainous terrain of the island. 
The Kythirian Straits are nearby.

Kythira is close to the Hellenic arc plate boundary zone, and thus highly prone to earthquakes. Many earthquakes in recorded history have had their epicentres near or on the island. Probably the largest in recent times is the 1903 earthquake near at the village of Mitata, that caused significant damage as well as limited loss of life. It has had two major earthquakes in the 21st century: that of November 5, 2004, measuring between 5.6 and 5.8 on the Richter scale and the earthquake of January 8, 2006, measuring 6.9 on the Richter scale. The epicenter of the latter was in the sea about to the east of Kythira, with a focus at a depth of approximately . Many buildings were damaged, particularly old ones, mostly in the village of Mitata, but with no loss of life. It was felt as far as Italy, Egypt, Malta and Jordan.

===Communities and villages===
The municipal unit Kythira is subdivided into 13 communities (constituent settlements in parentheses):
* Kythira or Chora (Kythira, Kalamos, Kapsali, Manitochori, Pourko, Strapodi)
* Aroniadika (Aroniadika, Pitsinades)
* Karavas (Karavas, Vouno, Gerakari, Kryoneri, Petrouni, Plateia Ammos, Progki)
* Karvounades (Karvounades, Agios Ilias, Alexandrades, Keramoto, Pitsinianika, Stathianika)
* Kontolianika (Kontolianika, Goudianika, Tsikalaria, Fatsadika)
* Livadi (Livadi, Ano Livadi, Katsouni, Lourantianika, Travasarianika)
* Logothetianika (Logothetianika, Kominianika, Lianianika, Perlegkianika)
* Mitata (Mitata, Avlemonas, Agia Moni, Viaradika, Palaiopoli)
* Mylopotamos (Mylopotamos, Araioi, Kato Chora, Piso Pigadi)
* Myrtidia (Drymon, Kalisperianika, Kalokairines, Moni Myrtidion)
* Potamos (Potamos, Agia Anastasia, Agia Pelagia, Kampos)
* Fratsia (Fratsia, Dokana)
* Friligkianika (Friligkianika, Aloizianika, Diakofti, Drymonari, Kampos Palaiopoleos, Kastrisianika)

===Climate===
Kythira has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Csa&quot;) with mild, rainy winters and warm to hot dry summers.

==Mythology==
In Ancient Greek mythology, Kythira was considered to be the island of celestial Aphrodite, the Goddess of love (cf. Cyprus, another island devoted to the Goddess of Love). She is said to have been birthed from sea foam near the island.

==Demographics==

Like many of the smaller Aegean islands, Kythira&#x27;s population is decreasing. While the island had reached a peak population of about 14,500 in 1864, that has steadily declined mostly due to emigration, both internal (to major urban centres of Greece) and external (to Australia, the United States, Germany) in the first half of the 20th century. Today its population hovers around 3,650 people (2021 census).

==Economy==
Since the late 20th century, the Kythirean economy has largely focused and, in the process, has become dependent on tourism, which provides the majority of the island&#x27;s income, despite the fact that Kythira is not one of the most popular tourist destinations in Greece. The popular season usually begins with the Greek holiday of Pentecost at the end of May, and lasts until the middle of September. During this time, primarily during August, the island&#x27;s population will often triple due to the tourists and natives returning for vacation. Dependence on tourism has resulted in increased building activity in many of the island&#x27;s villages, mostly for commercial purposes (hotels and hospitality facilities, shops etc.), but also secondary homes; prominent examples are Agia Pelagia and Livadi, both of which having witnessed significant growth in their size since the early 1990s.

Minor sources of revenue are thyme honey, famous within Greece for its rich flavor, as well as some small-scale cultivation of vegetables and fruit and animal husbandry that is, nevertheless, increasingly restricted to local consumption.

Only five of the island&#x27;s villages are on the coast (Platia Amos, Agia Pelagia, Diakofti, Avlemonas, &amp; Kapsali). During July and August, several traditional dances will be held in various villages. These dances usually attract the majority of the island&#x27;s population, the biggest of which are the festival of &#x27;Panagia&#x27; in Potamos on 15 August, and the wine festival in Mitata on the first Friday and Saturday of August.

== Infrastructure ==
The Trifylleion Hospital of Kythera is the only hospital on the island. The hospital&#x27;s construction was made possible through the contributions of Greek Americans, including Mixalis Semitekolos, also known as Mike Semet, who was a prominent figure in the New York City restaurant industry in the early 20th century. Semitekolos, an immigrant from Kythera, raised funds for the hospital by participating in a pan-Kytherian fundraising campaign in the United States in the early 1950s. His significant monetary contributions earned him recognition from King Paul of Greece with the Order of the Phoenix. The groundbreaking for the hospital was on May 21, 1953, in Potamos, making it the first hospital on the island. It remains the only hospital on the island to this day, providing essential medical services to the residents of Kythira and the surrounding areas. The charitable organization responsible for the hospital evolved to become the Trifylleion Foundation of Kytherians and is still active today.

==Kythira (town)==

The capital, Chora, is located on the southern part of the island having no ports connected to the southern Peloponnese or Vatika. Kythira&#x27;s port for Vatika was previously situated at Agia Pelagia, although in recent years this port has been decommissioned and has been replaced by a new port at the coastal town of Diakofti, Kythira.

Most of the over 60 village names end with &quot;-anika&quot; and a few end with -athika, -iana and -wades. This is due to the villages being named after influential families that settled first in that region. For Example, &#x27;Logothetianika&#x27; is derived from the Greek last name of &#x27;Logothetis&#x27;.

Officially, Greek is Kythira&#x27;s main language. Despite popular belief, most places such as public services and local administrations, will be able to oblige to an individual&#x27;s needs in English as well. In specific areas, some of Kythira&#x27;s population is fluent in Italian.

==Transportation==
The island in the past has been plagued by a poor infrastructure, exacerbated by the effect of weather on transportation during the winter months. However the construction of the new port in Diakofti along with the renovation of the island&#x27;s airport have significantly reduced these effects. A new road from the island&#x27;s most populated town of Potamos in the north to the island&#x27;s capital of Chora in the south is currently in the planning and development stage.

===Port===

Despite the fact that the island has been a trade route for centuries, construction of a modern port was postponed several times until the latter half of the 20th century. In 1933, efforts were made to construct a port in the village of Agia Pelagia, yet financial and governmental problems meant that it was only decades later that one was built. That small port of Agia Pelagia (currently being renovated from a ferry dock to a tourist/recreational boat dock) was the island&#x27;s main port until the mid-1990s. Around that time the new port of Diakofti, the site originally chosen by the British colonial administration in the 19th century, was constructed along with a modern wider road, aiming to support larger cargo and passenger vessels. The port of Diakofti currently serves scheduled routes to/from Gythion, Kalamata, Antikythera, Piraeus&#x27; Athens port, Crete &amp; Neapolis - Vatika. Proposals have been made to attach a marina to the south side of the port, however no plans or timetables have been produced. Additionally, the harbour of Agia Patrikia (north of Agia Pelagia) is the primary fishing boat harbour, housing two wide boatramps and a boat repair facility.

===Airport===
The island&#x27;s primary airport is the Alexander S. Onassis Airport also known as Kithira Island National Airport, located in the region between the village of Friligiannika and Diakofti, about from the capital. The airport was revamped and extended at the turn of the 21st century, largely by private funds provided by the local population. The island is served by Olympic Air and Aegean Airlines flights.

<text>SETI@home (&quot;SETI at home&quot;) is a project of the Berkeley SETI Research Center to analyze radio signals with the aim of searching for signs of extraterrestrial intelligence. Until March 2020, it was run as an Internet-based public volunteer computing project that employed the BOINC software platform. It is hosted by the Space Sciences Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley, and is one of many activities undertaken as part of the worldwide SETI effort.

SETI@home software was released to the public on May 17, 1999, making it the third large-scale use of volunteer computing over the Internet for research purposes, after Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search (GIMPS) was launched in 1996 and distributed.net in 1997. Along with MilkyWay@home and Einstein@home, it is the third major computing project of this type that has the investigation of phenomena in interstellar space as its primary purpose.

In March 2020, the project stopped sending out new work to SETI@home users, bringing the crowdsourced computing aspect of the project to a stop. At the time, the team intended to shift focus onto the analysis and interpretation of the 20 years&#x27; worth of accumulated data. However, the team left open the possibility of eventually resuming volunteer computing using data from other radio telescopes, such as MeerKAT and FAST.

As of November 2021, the science team has analysed the data and removed noisy signals (Radio Frequency Interference) using the Nebula tool they developed and will choose the top-scoring 100 or so multiplets to be observed using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope, to which they have been granted 24 hours of observation time.

==Scientific research==
The two original goals of SETI@home were:
* to do useful scientific work by supporting an observational analysis to detect intelligent life outside Earth
* to prove the viability and practicality of the &quot;volunteer computing&quot; concept

The second of these goals is considered to have succeeded completely. The current BOINC environment, a development of the original SETI@home, is providing support for many computationally intensive projects in a wide range of disciplines.

The first of these goals has to date yielded no conclusive results: no evidence for ETI signals has been shown via SETI@home. However, the ongoing continuation is predicated on the assumption that the observational analysis is not &quot;ill-posed.&quot; The remainder of this article deals specifically with the original SETI@home observations/analysis. The vast majority of the sky (over 98%) has yet to be surveyed, and each point in the sky must be surveyed many times to exclude even a subset of possibilities.

==Procedure details==
SETI@home searches for possible evidence of radio transmissions from extraterrestrial intelligence using observational data from the Arecibo radio telescope and the Green Bank Telescope. The data is taken &quot;piggyback&quot; or &quot;passively&quot; while the telescope is used for other scientific programs. The data is digitized, stored, and sent to the SETI@home facility. The data is then parsed into small chunks in frequency and time, and analyzed, using software, to search for any signals—that is, variations which cannot be ascribed to noise, and hence contain information. Using volunteer computing, SETI@home sends the millions of chunks of data to be analyzed off-site by home computers, and then have those computers report the results. Thus what appears a difficult problem in data analysis is reduced to a reasonable one by aid from a large, Internet-based community of borrowed computer resources.

The software searches for five types of signals that distinguish them from noise:
* Spikes in power spectra
* Gaussian rises and falls in transmission power, possibly representing the telescope beam&#x27;s main lobe passing over a radio source
* Triplets – three power spikes in a row
* Pulsing signals that possibly represent a narrowband digital-style transmission
* Autocorrelation detects signal waveforms.

There are many variations on how an ETI signal may be affected by the interstellar medium, and by the relative motion of its origin compared to Earth. The potential &quot;signal&quot; is thus processed in many ways (although not testing all detection methods nor scenarios) to ensure the highest likelihood of distinguishing it from the scintillating noise already present in all directions of outer space. For instance, another planet is very likely to be moving at a speed and acceleration with respect to Earth, and that will shift the frequency, over time, of the potential &quot;signal.&quot; Checking for this through processing is done, to an extent, in the SETI@home software.

The process is somewhat like tuning a radio to various channels, and looking at the signal strength meter. If the strength of the signal goes up, that gets attention. More technically, it involves a lot of digital signal processing, mostly discrete Fourier transforms at various chirp rates and durations.

==Results==
To date, the project has not confirmed the detection of any ETI signals. However, it has identified several candidate targets (sky positions), where the spike in intensity is not easily explained as noise spots, for further analysis. The most significant candidate signal to date was announced on September 1, 2004, named Radio source SHGb02+14a.

While the project has not reached the stated primary goal of finding extraterrestrial intelligence, it has proved to the scientific community that volunteer computing projects using Internet-connected computers can succeed as a viable analysis tool, and even beat the largest supercomputers. However, it has not been demonstrated that the order of magnitude excess in computers used, many outside the home (the original intent was to use 50,000–100,000 &quot;home&quot; computers), has benefited the project scientifically. (For more on this, see below.)

Astronomer Seth Shostak stated in 2004 that he expects to get a conclusive signal and proof of alien contact between 2020 and 2025, based on the Drake equation. This implies that a prolonged effort may benefit SETI@home, despite its (present) twenty-year run without success in ETI detection.

==Technology==
Anybody with an at least intermittently Internet-connected computer was able to participate in SETI@home by running a free program that downloaded and analyzed radio telescope data.

Observational data were recorded on 2-terabyte SATA hard disk drives fed from the Arecibo Telescope in Puerto Rico, each holding about 2.5 days of observations, which were then sent to Berkeley. Arecibo does not have a broadband Internet connection, so data must go by postal mail to Berkeley. Once there, it is divided in both time and frequency domains &quot;work units&quot; of 107 seconds of data, or approximately 0.35 megabytes (350 kilobytes or 350,000 bytes), which overlap in time but not in frequency. These work units are then sent from the SETI@home server over the Internet to personal computers around the world to analyze.

Data was merged into a database using SETI@home computers in Berkeley. Interference was rejected, and various pattern-detection algorithms were applied to search for the most interesting signals.

The project used CUDA for GPU processing starting in 2015.

In 2016 SETI@home began processing data from the Breakthrough Listen project.

===Software===


The SETI@home volunteer computing software ran either as a screensaver or continuously while a user worked, making use of processor time that would otherwise be unused.

The initial software platform, now referred to as &quot;SETI@home Classic&quot;, ran from May 17, 1999, to December 15, 2005. This program was only capable of running SETI@home; it was replaced by Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC), which also allows users to contribute to other volunteer computing projects at the same time as running SETI@home. The BOINC platform also allowed testing for more types of signals.

The discontinuation of the SETI@home Classic platform rendered older Macintosh computers running the classic Mac OS (pre December, 2001) unsuitable for participating in the project.

SETI@home was available for the Sony PlayStation 3 console.

On May 3, 2006, new work units for a new version of SETI@home called &quot;SETI@home Enhanced&quot; started distribution. Since computers had the power for more computationally intensive work than when the project began, this new version was more sensitive by a factor of two concerning Gaussian signals and to some kinds of pulsed signals than the original SETI@home (BOINC) software. This new application had been optimized to the point where it would run faster on some work units than earlier versions. However, some work units (the best work units, scientifically speaking) would take significantly longer.

In addition, some distributions of the SETI@home applications were optimized for a particular type of CPU. They were referred to as &quot;optimized executables&quot;, and had been found to run faster on systems specific for that CPU. , most of these applications were optimized for Intel processors and their corresponding instruction sets.

The results of the data processing were normally automatically transmitted when the computer was next connected to the Internet; it could also be instructed to connect to the Internet as needed.

==Statistics==
With over 5.2 million participants worldwide, the project was the volunteer computing project with the most participants to date. The original intent of SETI@home was to utilize 50,000–100,000 home computers. Since its launch on May 17, 1999, the project has logged over two million years of aggregate computing time. On September 26, 2001, SETI@home had performed a total of 1021 floating point operations. It was acknowledged by the 2008 edition of the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; as the largest computation in history. With over 145,000 active computers in the system (1.4 million total) in 233 countries, , SETI@home had the ability to compute over 668 teraFLOPS. For comparison, the Tianhe-2 computer, which was the world&#x27;s fastest supercomputer, was able to compute 33.86 petaFLOPS (approximately 50 times greater).

==Project future==
There were plans to get data from the Parkes Observatory in Australia to analyze the southern hemisphere. However, , these plans were not mentioned in the project&#x27;s website. Other plans include a Multi-Beam Data Recorder, a Near Time Persistency Checker and Astropulse (an application that uses coherent dedispersion to search for pulsed signals). Astropulse will team with the original SETI@home to detect other sources, such as rapidly rotating pulsars, exploding primordial black holes, or as-yet unknown astrophysical phenomena. Beta testing of the final public release version of Astropulse was completed in July 2008, and the distribution of work units to higher spec machines capable of processing the more CPU intensive work units started in mid-July 2008.

On March 31, 2020, UC Berkeley stopped sending out new data for SETI@Home clients to process, ending the effort for the time being. The program stated they were at a point of &quot;diminishing returns&quot; with the volunteer processing and needed to put the effort into hibernation while they processed the results.

==Competitive aspect==
SETI@home users quickly started to compete with one another to process the maximum number of work units. Teams were formed to combine the efforts of individual users. The competition continued and grew larger with the introduction of BOINC.

As with any competition, attempts have been made to &quot;cheat&quot; the system and claim credit for work that has not been performed. To combat cheats, the SETI@home system sends every work unit to multiple computers, a value known as &quot;initial replication&quot; (currently 2). Credit is only granted for each returned work unit once a minimum number of results have been returned and the results agree, a value known as &quot;minimum quorum&quot; (currently 2). If, due to computation errors or cheating by submitting false data, not enough results agree, more identical work units are sent out until the minimum quorum can be reached. The final credit granted to all machines which returned the correct result is the same and is the lowest of the values claimed by each machine.

Some users have installed and run SETI@home on computers at their workplaces; an act known as &quot;Borging&quot;, after the assimilation-driven Borg of &quot;Star Trek&quot;. In some cases, SETI@home users have misused company resources to gain work-unit results with at least two individuals getting fired for running SETI@home on an enterprise production system. There is a thread in the newsgroup alt.sci.seti which bears the title &quot;Anyone fired for SETI screensaver&quot; and ran starting as early as September 14, 1999.

Other users collect large quantities of equipment together at home to create &quot;SETI farms&quot;, which typically consist of a number of computers consisting of only a motherboard, CPU, RAM and power supply that are arranged on shelves as diskless workstations running either Linux or old versions of Microsoft Windows &quot;headless&quot; (without a monitor).

==Challenges==

===Closure of Arecibo Observatory===

Until 2020, SETI@home procured its data from the Arecibo Observatory facility that was operated by the National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center and administered by SRI International.

The decreasing operating budget for the observatory has created a shortfall of funds which has not been made up from other sources such as private donors, NASA, other foreign research institutions, nor private non-profit organizations such as SETI@home.

However, in the overall long-term views held by many involved with the SETI project, any usable radio telescope could take over from Arecibo (which completely collapsed in December 2020), as all the SETI systems are portable and relocatable.

===More restrictive computer use policies in businesses===
In one documented case, an individual was fired for explicitly importing and using the SETI@home software on computers used for the U.S. state of Ohio. In another incident a school IT director resigned after his installation allegedly cost his school district $1 million in removal costs; however, other reasons for this firing included lack of communication with his superiors, not installing firewall software and alleged theft of computer equipment, leading a ZDNet editor to comment that &quot;the volunteer computing nonsense was simply the best and most obvious excuse the district had to terminate his contract with cause&quot;.

, approximately one-third of the processing for the non-BOINC version of the software was performed on work or school based machines. As many of these computers will give reduced privileges to ordinary users, it is possible that much of this has been done by network administrators.

To some extent, this may be offset by better connectivity to home machines and increasing performance of home computers, especially those with GPUs, which have also benefited other volunteer computing projects such as Folding@Home. The spread of mobile computing devices provides another large resource for volunteer computing. For example, in 2012, Piotr Luszczek (a former doctoral student of Jack Dongarra) presented results showing that an iPad 2 matched the historical performance of a Cray-2 (the fastest computer in the world in 1985) on an embedded LINPACK benchmark.

===Funding===
There is currently no government funding for SETI research, and private funding is always limited. Berkeley Space Science Lab has found ways of working with small budgets, and the project has received donations allowing it to go well beyond its original planned duration, but it still has to compete for limited funds with other SETI projects and other space sciences projects.

In a December 16, 2007 plea for donations, SETI@home stated its present modest state and urged donations of $476,000 needed for continuation into 2008.

===Unofficial clients===
A number of individuals and companies made unofficial changes to the distributed part of the software to try to produce faster results, but this compromised the integrity of all the results. As a result, the software had to be updated to make it easier to detect such changes, and discover unreliable clients. BOINC will run on unofficial clients; however, clients that return different and therefore incorrect data are not allowed, so corrupting the result database is avoided. BOINC relies on cross-checking to validate data but unreliable clients need to be identified, to avoid situations when two of these report the same invalid data and therefore corrupt the database. A very popular unofficial client (lunatic) allows users to take advantage of the special features provided by their processor(s) such as SSE, SSE2, SSE3, SSSE3, SSE4.1, and AVX to allow for faster processing.

===Hardware and database failures===

SETI@home is a test bed for further development not only of BOINC but of other hardware and software (database) technology. Under SETI@home processing loads, these experimental technologies can be more challenging than expected, as SETI databases do not have typical accounting and business data or relational structures. The non-traditional database uses often do incur greater processing overheads and risk of database corruption and outright database failure. Hardware, software and database failures can (and do) cause dips in project participation.

The project has had to shut down several times to change over to new databases capable of handling more massive datasets. Hardware failure has proven to be a substantial source of project shutdowns, as hardware failure is often coupled with database corruption.
