<text>Olin A. Dutra (January 17, 1901 – May 5, 1983) was an American professional golfer who played on the PGA Tour in the 1920s and 1930s. He won two major titles, the PGA Championship in 1932 and the U.S. Open in 1934, and was the first major champion born in the western United States.

== Early life ==
Born in Monterey, California, Dutra was a descendant of early Spanish settlers in California. At age nine, he and his older brother Mortimer were introduced to golf as a caddies at the country club in Del Monte, where the club professional was Macdonald Smith. For years, they woke up very early to practice golf before going to work. Early in his career, Dutra worked at a hardware store for five years.

== Professional career ==
In 1923, Dutra resigned from a job at his father&#x27;s hardware store to become a golf professional. His best years as a golf professional were in the early 1930s, when he won his two majors and played on the 1933 and 1935 Ryder Cup teams. In the 1932 PGA Championship in St. Paul, Dutra played 196 holes and finished an astounding 19-under-par. He was the medalist in the 36-hole qualifier and won his five matches by comfortable margins (9 &amp; 8, 5 &amp; 3, 5 &amp; 4, 3 &amp; 2, and 4 &amp; 3).

Dutra is best remembered for his performance at the 1934 U.S. Open at Merion near Philadelphia. More than a year earlier, Dutra became afflicted with amoebic dysentery, an often uncomfortable and painful intestinal infection. While traveling east from Los Angeles, Dutra stopped in the Detroit area to meet up with his brother Mortie, as both were entered in the Open, and began to feel very ill. He spent a short time in the hospital, casting doubt whether he could even play in the tournament. He resorted to unusual measures to cope with the infection, and lost close to off his , frame. After the first two rounds, Dutra was eight strokes behind the leaders and in 18th place. On the eve of the 36-hole final day, he had an attack of dysentery, forcing him to snack on sugar cubes throughout the day. He was still able to shoot a 71-72, and held off 54-hole leader Gene Sarazen to win by a single stroke. (Mortie Dutra finished tied for 28th.)

Dutra began his career as a club pro in Fresno, California at Fort Washington Country Club for several years and then was at Sunnyside Country Club for a year. He won his two majors as the pro at Brentwood Country Club in Los Angeles, and moved over to Wilshire Country Club in 1935. While at Brentwood in 1932, he gave Babe Didrickson a two-minute lesson before she played her &quot;first&quot; round of golf, shortly after the 1932 Olympics; her first tee shot was , outdriving her male playing partners. (It was later revealed she had previous golf experience.) Dutra later worked in Mexico City, then back in California in Avila Beach and Watsonville. In 1966, Dutra was inducted into the Fresno County Athletic Hall of Fame. He died after an extended illness at age 82 in Newman in Stanislaus County. Dutra and his wife Gladys are buried in the Hills Ferry Cemetery in Newman.

<doc id="318560" wikidata="Q2078164" url="?curid=318560" title="Chick Evans">
<text>Charles E. &quot;Chick&quot; Evans Jr. (July 18, 1890 – November 6, 1979) was a prominent American amateur golfer of the 1910s and 1920s. Evans, who won the 1910 Western Open, became the first amateur to win both the U.S. Open and U.S. Amateur in one year, a feat he achieved in 1916. Evans won the U.S. Amateur again in 1920, and was runner-up three times. Selected to the Walker Cup team in 1922, 1924, and 1928, he competed in a record 50 consecutive U.S. Amateurs in his long career. Evans achieved all of this while carrying only seven hickory-shafted clubs.

In addition to his golf career, Evans is known for founding the Evans Scholars Foundation, which provides a college scholarship for qualified caddies.

In 1960, Evans was voted the Bob Jones Award, the highest honor given by the United States Golf Association in recognition of distinguished sportsmanship in golf. He is a member of the World Golf Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Born in Indianapolis, Indiana, Evans&#x27; family moved to Chicago when he was eight years old, and he grew up on the north side of the city. His father, Charles Evans, was one of the most influential librarians of the 20th century. At the age of eight, he was first exposed to golf as a caddie at a Chicago course, the Edgewater Golf Club. He attended secondary school at the Evanston Academy, and won the 1907 and 1908 Western Interscholastic tournaments. He led in the founding of the Western Interscholastic Golf Association (WIGA), and led Evanston Academy to the 1908 WIGA team championship.

==Golf career==

From these beginnings, Evans became one of the most acclaimed American amateur golfers of his time. The accomplishment that gave him the most contemporary publicity came in 1916, when he won both the U.S. Amateur and U.S. Open in the same year. Evans was the first person to accomplish this task, and only Bobby Jones has done it since.

Evans also won the Western Open in 1910 by defeating George Simpson 6 and 5 in the 36-hole final. He was the only amateur to do so until Scott Verplank in 1985. Simpson graciously praised Evans on his victory, saying “I’ve learned the greatest golf lesson of my life today. I consider it a greater honor to be beaten by the kind of golf you have played than to have remained out of the tournament because I did not fancy match play.”

Into the 1960s, Evans was an active participant in senior tournaments, and still competed in U.S. Amateur events, eventually setting a record of completing 50 of these championships. Evans played his last rounds of competitive golf in 1968, winning the Illinois Open that year. His last Western Amateur was in 1967.

After his retirement, Evans continued to attend events as a spectator and converse with the fans and players.

==Evans Scholars Foundation==

After his wins in 1916, Evans was given several thousand dollars in royalties for recording golf instructions for the Brunswick Record Company, and in 1921 he received royalties from a golf book. If he had accepted this money Evans would have lost his amateur status. His mother suggested that he put the money to good use by sponsoring a scholarship fund for caddies.

Evans, who was unable to finish his own matriculation at Northwestern University, recalled that his mother &quot;wouldn&#x27;t think of accepting my money unless we could arrange it to be trusted to furnish educations for deserving qualified caddies.&quot; He said his mother &quot;pointed out that the money came from golf and thus should go back into golf -- It was all her dream -- her idea.&quot;

Evans went to the Western Golf Association (WGA), an organization that ran the golf championships in the Midwest, to get their support for his scholarship. By 1930, the Evans Scholars Foundation had formed and two caddies, Harold Fink and Jim McGinnis, were named the first two Evans Scholars.

Chick Evans&#x27; long friendship with Chicago tax attorney, Carleton Blunt, had proved to be the catalyst for launching the Evans Scholars Foundation. Blunt, an avid golfer and philanthropist, supported Evans&#x27; vision for helping caddies attend colleges and universities across the country by raising the necessary funds for decades.

The criteria used to choose the recipients were scholarship, fellowship and leadership. Since that time, over 10,600 caddies have become Evans Scholars and attained college educations. The Evans scholarship program continues today as the largest scholarship organization in sports and the largest privately funded scholarship program in the United States.

Evans Scholarship houses exist at the following Universities: University of Colorado, University of Illinois, Northwestern University, Marquette University, University of Wisconsin, Purdue University, Ohio State University, Northern Illinois University, University of Missouri, Indiana University, University of Michigan, Michigan State University, Miami University and the University of Minnesota.

On February 19, 2014, the Evans Scholars Foundation announced their plans to build a new chapter house at the University of Oregon. It is the first new Scholarship House in 27 years. In addition to those universities at which houses exist, scholarship recipients attend several other universities around the country. More than 800 caddies currently attend college on an Evans Scholarship.

==Death and legacy==
Evans died on November 6, 1979, at age 89. His wife, Esther, had died in 1967 after 40 years of marriage. They had no children. The Chick Evans Golf Course in Morton Grove, a north suburb of Chicago, is named in his honor.

<text>A foxhound is a type of large hunting hound bred for strong hunting instincts, a keen sense of smell, and their barking, energy, drive, and speed. In fox hunting, the foxhound&#x27;s namesake, packs of foxhounds track quarry, followed—usually on horseback—by the hunters, sometimes for several miles at a stretch; moreover, foxhounds also sometimes guard sheep and houses.

There are different breeds of foxhound, each having slightly different characteristics and appearances, and each often called simply &quot;Foxhound&quot; in their native countries:
*American Foxhound
*Dumfriesshire Black and Tan Foxhound (extinct)
*English Foxhound
*Welsh Foxhound

The American Masters of Foxhounds Association recognizes these breeds of foxhounds:
American, Penn-Marydel, English, and crossbred foxhounds.
The International Foxhound Association was created in 2012 for the international promotion of the Foxhound as a breed.

== Characteristics == 

Foxhounds are medium-large dogs and males typically weigh 29-32 kg (65-70 lb) and females 27-29 kg (60-65 lb). Height for males measures 55-63 cm (22-25 in) and females 53-60 cm (21-24 in). Foxhounds have a short coat, and long, strong legs, as well as deep chests for lots of lung space.

== Disposition == 
Foxhounds generally display a gentle and affectionate temperament. Foxhounds are highly active and energetic, and therefore require activity and exercise. Foxhounds are sociable and these dogs have great stamina, sense of smell, and enjoy being in a pack, as they are bred for hunting in packs.

== Fox hunting == 
In fox hunting, the foxhound&#x27;s namesake, packs of foxhounds track and chase fox while hunters follow along on horseback. Fox hunting has shifted over the years and may differ depending on the country. Some changes over time include focusing on chasing rather than killing, and chasing other creatures, such as the coyote, instead of only the fox. 

== Most common causes of death ==
Most common causes of death among Foxhound puppies are respiratory disease, anorexia and dehydration, skin disorders, and gastrointestinal disease. 

== Respiratory disease in foxhounds == 
A kennel of working, hunting English Foxhounds in the south of England, had an outbreak of tuberculosis (TB) that impacted 180 dogs in late 2016 and early 2017. The kennel housed Foxhound puppies to adults, up to 8 years old. The Foxhounds work among six counties and some of the six counties are in the &quot;Edge Area&quot; that is impacted by bovine tuberculosis. 

An investigation occurred which consisted of testing the dogs and looking deeper into the regional area, diet of the dogs, and even more factors while conducting tests and gathering information. The dogs eat raw meat and there was speculation about the diet containing the M. bovis that causes TB as the meat comes from areas impacted by M. bovis. 

== Registrations==
In 2005, the American Kennel Club reported that the English and American Foxhounds were their least and fourth least registered breeds in North America with 22 and 44 registrations, respectively; the top registered breed, the Labrador Retriever, had 137,867 registrations during the same year.

== Notable foxhounds==
* Sweet Lips and the Virginia Hounds - George Washington bred foxhounds and enjoyed fox hunting. He called his pack of dogs the Virginia Hounds. Sweet Lips was a female foxhound, a product of his vision to breed his pack to produce a &quot;superior dog&quot; who is fast and intelligent.
*The state of Virginia&#x27;s &quot;state dog&quot; is the American Foxhound.
*Old Drum - said to have been the inspiration for the phrase &quot;Man&#x27;s Best Friend&quot;, which arose from an 1870 court case regarding him.
* Mountain and Muse - In 1814 the Duke of Leeds gave two Irish foxhounds, Mountain and Muse, to a visiting guest, Bolton Jackson. This famous pair of hounds changed hands several times before going to Charles Carroll at his Homewood estate. Descendants of Mountain and Muse still hunt territories in Maryland that were once hunted by George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Charles Carroll, and the Marquis de Lafayette.
* Colonel - In 2011, Baron von Pfetten&#x27;s Colonel was Champion of the World Dog Show in Paris and was the first ever English Foxhound invited to compete in the final Champion of Champions competition in Bruxelles that same year.

<doc id="318564" wikidata="Q276043" url="?curid=318564" title="Manuel Fraga">
<text>Manuel Fraga Iribarne (; 23 November 1922 – 15 January 2012) was a Spanish professor and politician during the dictatorship of Francisco Franco, who was also one of the founders of the People&#x27;s Party. Fraga was Minister of Information and Tourism between 1962 and 1969, Ambassador to the United Kingdom between 1973 and 1975, Minister of the Interior in 1975, Second Deputy Prime Minister between 1975 and 1976, President of the People&#x27;s Alliance/People&#x27;s Party between 1979 and 1990 and President of the Regional Government of Galicia between 1990 and 2005. He was also a Member of the Congress of Deputies and a Senator.

Fraga&#x27;s career as one of the key political figures in Spain straddles both General Francisco Franco&#x27;s regime and the subsequent transition to representative democracy. He served as the President of the Regional Government of Galicia from 1990 to 2005 and as a Senator until November 2011. Fraga is also one of the Fathers of the Constitution.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Fraga was born in Vilalba, Lugo Province, Galicia. Trained in law, economics and political science, he began his political career in 1945, during Francisco Franco&#x27;s reign.

Fraga married Carmen Estévez Eguiagaray, whom he had met in 1945 in the Faculty of Law, on 17 January 1948. They had 5 children: Carmen, Isabel, José Manuel, Ignacio and Adriana. He also adopted Amalia. Aside from Spanish, Fraga also spoke French, English, Italian, German, Portuguese, Galician and Basque.

=== Propaganda Minister during the dictatorship ===
Fraga started in the Franco cabinet in 1962 as Minister of Information and tourism. He played a major role in the revitalization of Spanish tourist industry, leading a campaign under the slogan &quot;Spain is different!&quot;. On 8 March 1966, he attempted to dispel fears of a nuclear accident after the Palomares hydrogen bombs incident by swimming in the contaminated water with the American ambassador, Angier Biddle Duke.

Fraga authorized the execution of political prisoners under the Francoist State. A notable case is the execution of communist leader Julián Grimau, whom he called &quot;that little gentleman&quot; () in a press conference when asked about his detention and death sentence. His death sentence caused a large controversy outside of Spain. Grimau was executed by firing squad in 1963. Fraga never publicly apologized or expressed regret for Grimau&#x27;s execution.

Another notable case was the assassination by Spanish police of Enrique Ruano, a student activist who opposed the Francoist State. Fraga telephoned Ruano&#x27;s father and threatened to arrest his other daughter, Margot, who was also an anti-Francoist, unless she immediately stopped her activism. The then-director of Spanish newspaper &quot;ABC&quot;, Torcuato Luca de Tena, later confessed that Fraga ordered him to publish a manipulated copy of Ruano&#x27;s personal diary in order to present Ruano as a mentally unstable person who killed himself.

Later in the decade, Fraga established himself as one of the more prominent members of a reformist faction in the government who favoured opening up the government from above. He introduced an &quot;a posteriori&quot; censorship law, which was based on lifting pre-publication censorship and a reduction in its strictness. Additionally, a certain sexual liberality in films was popularly summarized in the expression &quot;Con Fraga hasta la braga&quot; (&quot;With Fraga [you can see] even the panties&quot;). His departure from the government was prompted by the MATESA affair: the debt of the important publisher Manuel Salvat Dalmau was tangled with members of the Opus Dei, faction which Fraga opposed. When he published this information, the caudillo Franco expelled both sectors.

=== Ambassador to the United Kingdom ===
In 1973, Fraga (according to his memoirs he had been in the shortlist for becoming prime minister along Carrero Blanco and Raimundo Fernández Cuesta), accepted a proposal by Foreign Minister Laureano López Rodó to become Ambassador to the United Kingdom, under the conditions of the stint no being longer then 2 years, having the ability to appoint a counsellor and a press officer and not being excessively constrained by the Francoist administration. He also wanted to finish a book titled &quot;La España de los 70&quot;. He served until 1975.

=== Minister of the Interior during the Transition ===
Following Franco&#x27;s death on 20 November 1975, Fraga was appointed deputy prime minister (Vice President of the Government) and Interior Minister (Ministro de Gobernación) on 12 December 1975, under Carlos Arias Navarro, a post he held until 5 July 1976. This was the first government with Juan Carlos I as chief of state.

By this time, Fraga believed Francoism could not be maintained forever. However, while he still favoured liberalization from above, his vision entailed an extremely gradual transition to full democracy. The drastic measures he took as interior minister and head of state security during the first days of the Spanish transition to democracy gave him a reputation for heavy-handedness, and deeply damaged his popularity. The phrase &quot;¡La calle es mía!&quot; (&quot;The streets are mine!&quot;) was attributed to him as his answer to complaints of police repression of street protests: he claimed that the streets did not belong to the &quot;people&quot; but to the state. He was known to be an admirer of Antonio Cánovas del Castillo. During a clash at the Church of St. Francis of Assisi in Vitoria (Basque Country) between police and striking workers, on Fraga&#x27;s orders the police stormed into a packed church into which 4,000 demonstrators had retreated and went on a shooting spree, resulting in five dead and over 100 wounded.

=== Leader of People&#x27;s Alliance ===

In 1976, Fraga and other former prominent members of the Francoist government founded the People&#x27;s Alliance (AP), initially a loose confederation of political parties that later became a full-fledged party. Although he tried to brand the party as a mainstream conservative party, the people did not trust him. Besides the large number of former Francoists in the party, Fraga&#x27;s performance as interior minister gave voters pause. Fraga was one of the writers of the new Spanish constitution approved in 1978 (the &quot;Fathers of the Constitution&quot;). AP fared poorly in its first years, but following the 1982 crisis and the collapse of the Union of the Democratic Centre (UCD), the party that—led by Adolfo Suárez—had won the first two democratic elections, AP became the second biggest group in the Congress of Deputies after the Spanish Socialist Workers Party (PSOE).

Fraga was reckoned as the Leader of the Opposition to the PSOE government. The PSOE enjoyed great popularity and an absolute majority winning streak in the 1982 and 1986 elections, in part because Fraga and the AP were generally viewed as too reactionary to be an alternative. He was subject to a scandal in 1983, when it was reported that Rodolfo Almirón, a former Argentine national police officer leader of the Triple A, a far-right death squad in Argentina, had become chief of his personal security team.

=== Passing on the torch ===
Following a political crisis in AP in 1986 that saw former Secretary-General Jorge Verstrynge leaving the party and the breaking of the alliance with the christian-democrats of the People&#x27;s Democratic Party (PDP) under the People&#x27;s Coalition (CP), Fraga resigned from the presidency of AP in December 1986. Replaced as party leader by Antonio Hernández Mancha, Fraga ran first in the People&#x27;s Alliance list for the 1987 European election and was subsequently elected MEP. He served as member of the European Parliament until 1989.

With the AP in headlong decline, Fraga briefly resumed the leadership of the party in 1989. With the addition of several lesser Christian democratic parties and the remnants of the Democratic Center Union, he refounded the People&#x27;s Alliance as the People&#x27;s Party (PP). Later in the same year, Fraga encouraged the election of José María Aznar as the party&#x27;s new president. Fraga was then appointed as honorary president of the PP.

=== Regional President of Galicia ===

Manuel Fraga returned to his Galician homeland in 1989, and following the results of the 1989 regional election, with the People&#x27;s Party in Galicia (PPdG) winning a simple majority in the regional parliament, he became President of the Xunta of Galicia. He remained in charge for almost 15 years until 2005, when the PPdeG lost its overall majority.

Fraga was widowed on 23 February 1996.

Fraga saw his credibility damaged in late 2002, when the oil tanker ship &quot;Prestige&quot; sank off the Galician coast. It caused a massive oil spill that affected the shoreline in the northwest of the region. Fraga was said to have been slow to react and unable, or unwilling, to handle the situation. In 2004, a power struggle between factions of PPdeG further hurt the party&#x27;s image.

Subsequently, in the autonomous elections of 2005, Fraga and the PPdeG lost their absolute majority in the Parliament of Galicia. Despite their obtaining a 45% plurality in the elections, a left-government coalition developed between the Socialists&#x27; Party of Galicia (PSdeG) and the Galician Nationalist Bloc, making socialist Emilio Pérez Touriño the new president. Fraga remained on the political scene from Galicia, as a member of the Senate representing the Parliament of Galicia. Alberto Núñez Feijóo, a member of the Galician Popular Party, succeeded Fraga as head of the PPdG on 15 January 2006.

=== Later life ===

Fraga was designated as member of the Senate by the Parliament of Galicia in 2006. He served in the Upper House until 2011.

Fraga died on 15 January 2012 of a respiratory disease. His funeral was attended by Prince Felipe and Princess Letizia.

==Overview==
Fraga was one of the writers of the democratic constitution and spent part of his political career lessening the censorship law during the latter years of the Francoist State. However, he had openly admitted admiration for General Franco and the Francoist State in public on several occasions. He was renowned for his temper tantrums in public at not being referred to or addressed as &quot;Don Manuel&quot;. He most famously shouted during a television interview, completely unaware the camera was filming and the show was being broadcast live on air. Fraga was probably one of the most important and yet controversial politicians in modern Spain.

To his supporters, Fraga was a Galician hero who throughout his rule, modernised Galicia and built up a fair level of tourism to the region. He built great roads and motorways and in 2000, he approved the Galician Plan to build Spain&#x27;s first high speed bullet train.

To his opponents he was seen as a dinosaur from the Franco regime. He was a keen follower of Carl Schmitt&#x27;s ideas, and granted the German political theorist honorary membership to the Institute of Political Studies in 1962, in a ceremony where he praised him as a &quot;revered master&quot;. Fraga identified himself with the figure of Antonio Cánovas del Castillo in 1976 for the first time; this idea of identification between Cánovas and Fraga was reinforced by historiographical trends close to Fraga in the 1980s in order to commend his figure. Despite their political differences, he developed a close friendship with Fidel Castro, himself of Galician descent, who met with Fraga in Galicia during a visit to Spain in 1992.

==In popular culture==
In 1962, a satirical magazine &quot;Ley Fraga&quot; was launched in Barcelona which was named after him.

<text>Urnäsch is a municipality in the canton of Appenzell Ausserrhoden, Switzerland.

==History==

In 831 AD a part of Urnäsch known as &quot;Färchen&quot; was first mentioned. In the 10th century, Urnäsch was part of the administrative district Herisau. From the 14th century onwards, Urnäsch was part of the &quot;Rhode&quot; Hundwil, and thus part of the bailiwick of St. Gallen. The first official mentioning of the municipality&#x27;s entirety as “Urnäschen” occurred in 1344, when the village was sold to the German Earl &quot;Werdenberg&quot;, although the municipality already had a strong and independent agenda. It became part of the &quot;Schwäbischer Städtebund&quot; in the same year as the so-called &quot;Lendlyn,&quot; which further reaffirmed their independent position. In 1401, Urnäsch joined the &quot;Bund&quot; together with St. Gallen. At that time, Urnäsch was still a part of the &quot;Rhode&quot; Hundwil. From 1401 to 1429, Urnäsch was on the forefront of the Appenzell wars. After the battles in &quot;Vögelinsegg&quot; (1403) and &quot;Stoss&quot; (1405) the land gained independence as part of Appenzell.

Until 1414, Urnäsch’s population had to go to church in the faraway municipality of Herisau. In the same year, a new church was built in Urnäsch and thereby the municipality obtained its independence in 1417 when the church was inaugurated. In 1480, Hundwil and Urnäsch split. In 1525, Urnäsch joined the reformation. Since the &quot;Landteilung&quot; in 1597, Urnäsch has been part of Appenzell Ausserrhoden as one of the six outermost &quot;Rhoden&quot; and was regularly the meeting place of the &quot;Kleiner Rat.&quot;

In 1641, a large fire broke out in the village and burned down the church, the guildhall, the presbytery, and many other residential buildings. The church was rebuilt shortly thereafter and renovated in the years 1866 to 1888.

Until 1722, the municipality Schönengrund was also part of Urnäsch, but obtained its independence the same year. Since then, the territory of Urnäsch has remained unaltered.

Since the second half of the 19th century, the separation of church and state became more common, until the Swiss constitution of 1908 declared them to be fully separated from each other. Interestingly, the Urnäsch’s constitution only removed the term “&quot;Kirchhöri”&quot; as its description, which includes both church and government, in the year 2000.

From the 1850’s onwards, tourism began to gain importance as a source of income. In 1853, the municipality’s first bridge was inaugurated, and in1875 a first train stop was built. In the 20th century, especially the establishment of public transport connections were of significance.

<doc id="318567" wikidata="Q654204" url="?curid=318567" title="All Things Must Pass">
<text>All Things Must Pass is the third studio album by the English rock musician George Harrison. Released as a triple album in November 1970, it was Harrison&#x27;s first solo work after the break-up of the Beatles in April that year. It includes the hit singles &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; and &quot;What Is Life&quot;, as well as songs such as &quot;Isn&#x27;t It a Pity&quot; and the title track that had been overlooked for inclusion on releases by the Beatles. The album reflects the influence of Harrison&#x27;s musical activities with artists such as Bob Dylan, the Band, Delaney &amp; Bonnie and Friends and Billy Preston during 1968–70, and his growth as an artist beyond his supporting role to former bandmates John Lennon and Paul McCartney. &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; introduced Harrison&#x27;s signature slide guitar sound and the spiritual themes present throughout his subsequent solo work. The original vinyl release consisted of two LPs of songs and a third disc of informal jams titled &quot;Apple Jam&quot;. Several commentators interpret Barry Feinstein&#x27;s album cover photo, showing Harrison surrounded by four garden gnomes, as a statement on his independence from the Beatles.

Production began at London&#x27;s EMI Studios in May 1970, with extensive overdubbing and mixing continuing through October. Among the large cast of backing musicians were Eric Clapton and members of Delaney &amp; Bonnie&#x27;s Friends band – three of whom formed Derek and the Dominos with Clapton during the recording – as well as Ringo Starr, Gary Wright, Billy Preston, Klaus Voormann, John Barham, Badfinger and Pete Drake. The sessions produced a double album&#x27;s worth of extra material, most of which remains unissued.

&quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; was critically and commercially successful on release, with long stays at number one on charts worldwide. Co-producer Phil Spector employed his Wall of Sound production technique to notable effect; Ben Gerson of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described the sound as &quot;Wagnerian, Brucknerian, the music of mountain tops and vast horizons&quot;. Reflecting the widespread surprise at the assuredness of Harrison&#x27;s post-Beatles debut, &quot;Melody Maker&quot;″s Richard Williams likened the album to Greta Garbo&#x27;s first role in a talking picture and declared: &quot;Garbo talks! – Harrison is free!&quot; According to Colin Larkin, writing in the 2011 edition of his &quot;Encyclopedia of Popular Music&quot;, &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; is &quot;generally rated&quot; as the best of all the former Beatles&#x27; solo albums.

During the final year of his life, Harrison oversaw a successful reissue campaign to mark the 30th anniversary of the album&#x27;s release. After this reissue, the Recording Industry Association of America certified the album six-times platinum. It has since been certified seven-times platinum, with at least 7 million albums sold. Among its appearances on critics&#x27; best-album lists, &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; was ranked 79th on &quot;The Times&quot;″ &quot;The 100 Best Albums of All Time&quot; in 1993, while &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; placed it 368th on the magazine&#x27;s 2023 update of &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;. In 2014, &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

==Background==
Music journalist John Harris said George Harrison&#x27;s &quot;journey&quot; to making &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; started when he visited America in late 1968, after the acrimonious sessions for the Beatles&#x27; self-titled double album (also known as the &quot;White Album&quot;). At Woodstock in November, Harrison started a long-lasting friendship with Bob Dylan and experienced a creative equality with the Band that contrasted with John Lennon and Paul McCartney&#x27;s dominance in the Beatles. He also wrote more songs, renewing his interest in the guitar after three years studying the Indian sitar. As well as being one of the few musicians to co-write songs with Dylan, Harrison had recently collaborated with Eric Clapton on &quot;Badge&quot;, which became a hit single for Cream in the spring of 1969.
Once back in London, and with his compositions continually overlooked for inclusion on releases by the Beatles, Harrison found creative fulfilment in extracurricular projects that, in the words of his musical biographer, Simon Leng, served as an &quot;emancipating force&quot; from the restrictions imposed on him in the band. His activities during 1969 included producing Apple signings Billy Preston and Doris Troy, two American singer-songwriters whose soul and gospel roots proved as influential on &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; as the music of the Band. He also recorded with artists such as Leon Russell and Jack Bruce, and accompanied Clapton on a short tour with Delaney Bramlett&#x27;s soul revue, Delaney &amp; Bonnie and Friends. In addition, Harrison identified his involvement with the Hare Krishna movement as providing &quot;another piece of a jigsaw puzzle&quot; that represented the spiritual journey he had begun in 1966. As well as embracing the Vaishnavist branch of Hinduism, Harrison produced two hit singles during 1969–70 by the UK-based devotees, credited as Radha Krishna Temple (London). In January 1970, Harrison invited American producer Phil Spector to participate in the recording of Lennon&#x27;s Plastic Ono Band single &quot;Instant Karma!&quot; This association led to Spector being given the task of salvaging the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Get Back&quot; rehearsal tapes, released officially as the &quot;Let It Be&quot; album (1970), and later co-producing &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;.

Harrison first discussed the possibility of making a solo album of his unused songs during the ill-tempered &quot;Get Back&quot; sessions, held at Twickenham Film Studios in January 1969. On 25 February, his 26th birthday, Harrison recorded demos of &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; and two other compositions that had received little interest from Lennon and McCartney at Twickenham. With the inclusion of one of these songs – &quot;Something&quot; – and &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot; on the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Abbey Road&quot; album in September 1969, music critics acknowledged that Harrison had bloomed into a songwriter to match Lennon and McCartney. He began talking publicly about recording his own album from the autumn of 1969, but only committed to the idea after McCartney announced that he was leaving the Beatles in April 1970. Included as part of the promotional material for McCartney&#x27;s self-titled solo album, this announcement signalled the band&#x27;s break-up. Despite having already made &quot;Wonderwall Music&quot; (1968), a mostly instrumental soundtrack album, and the experimental &quot;Electronic Sound&quot; (1969), Harrison considered &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; to be his first solo album.

==Songs==

===Main body===

Spector first heard Harrison&#x27;s stockpile of unreleased songs early in 1970, when visiting his recently purchased home, Friar Park. &quot;It was endless!&quot; Spector later recalled of the recital, noting the quantity and quality of Harrison&#x27;s material. Harrison had accumulated songs from as far back as 1966; both &quot;Isn&#x27;t It a Pity&quot; and &quot;Art of Dying&quot; date from that year. He co-wrote at least two songs with Dylan while in Woodstock, one of which, &quot;I&#x27;d Have You Anytime&quot;, appeared as the lead track on &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;. Harrison also wrote &quot;Let It Down&quot; in late 1968.

He introduced the Band-inspired &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;, along with &quot;Hear Me Lord&quot; and &quot;Let It Down&quot;, at the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Get Back&quot; rehearsals, only to have them rejected by Lennon and McCartney. The tense atmosphere at Twickenham fuelled another &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; song, &quot;Wah-Wah&quot;, which Harrison wrote in the wake of his temporary departure from the band on 10 January 1969. Harrison later confirmed that the song was a &quot;swipe&quot; at McCartney.&lt;ref name=&quot;White/Musician p 55&quot;&gt;Timothy White, &quot;George Harrison – Reconsidered&quot;, &quot;Musician&quot;, November 1987, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Run of the Mill&quot; followed soon afterwards, its lyrics focusing on the failure of friendships within the Beatles amid the business problems surrounding their Apple organisation. Harrison&#x27;s musical activities outside the band during 1969 inspired other songs on the album: &quot;What Is Life&quot; came to him while driving to a London session that spring for Preston&#x27;s &quot;That&#x27;s the Way God Planned It&quot; album; &quot;Behind That Locked Door&quot; was Harrison&#x27;s message of encouragement to Dylan, written the night before the latter&#x27;s comeback performance at the Isle of Wight Festival; and Harrison began &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; as an exercise in writing a gospel song during Delaney &amp; Bonnie&#x27;s stopover in Copenhagen in December 1969.

&quot;I Dig Love&quot; resulted from Harrison&#x27;s early experiments with slide guitar, a technique to which Bramlett had introduced him, in order to cover for guitarist Dave Mason&#x27;s departure from the Friends line-up. Other songs on &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;, all written during the first half of 1970, include &quot;Awaiting on You All&quot;, which reflected Harrison&#x27;s adoption of chanting through his involvement with the Hare Krishna movement; &quot;Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp (Let It Roll)&quot;, a tribute to the original owner of Friar Park; and &quot;Beware of Darkness&quot;. The latter was another song influenced by Harrison&#x27;s association with the Radha Krishna Temple, and was written while some of the devotees were staying with him at Friar Park.

On 1 May 1970, shortly before beginning work on &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;, Harrison attended a Dylan session in New York, during which he acquired a new song of Dylan&#x27;s, &quot;If Not for You&quot;. Harrison wrote &quot;Apple Scruffs&quot;, which was one of a number of Dylan-influenced songs on the album, towards the end of production on &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;, as a tribute to the diehard fans who had kept a vigil outside the studios where he was working.

According to Leng, &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; represents the completion of Harrison&#x27;s &quot;musical-philosophical circle&quot;, in which his 1966–68 immersion in Indian music found a Western equivalent in gospel music. While identifying hard rock, country and Motown among the other genres on the album, Leng writes of the &quot;plethora of new sounds and influences&quot; that Harrison had absorbed through 1969 and now incorporated, including &quot;Krishna chants, gospel ecstasy, Southern blues-rock [and] slide guitar&quot;. The melodies of &quot;Isn&#x27;t It a Pity&quot; and &quot;Beware of Darkness&quot; have aspects of Indian classical music, and on &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot;, Harrison combined the Hindu bhajan tradition with gospel. Rob Mitchum of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; describes the album as &quot;dark-tinged Krishna folk-rock&quot;.

The recurrent lyrical themes are Harrison&#x27;s spiritual quest, as it would be throughout his solo career, and friendship, particularly the failure of relationships among the Beatles. Music journalist Jim Irvin says that Harrison sings of &quot;deep love – for his faith, for life and the people around him&quot;. He adds that the songs are performed with &quot;tension and urgency&quot; as if &quot;the whole thing is happening on the edge of a canyon, an abyss into which the &#x27;60s is about to topple&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Irvin/RBP&quot;&gt;Jim Irvin, &quot;George Harrison: &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; (Apple)&quot;, Rock&#x27;s Backpages, 2000 (subscription required; retrieved 28 November 2020).&lt;/ref&gt;

===&quot;Apple Jam&quot;===
On the original LP&#x27;s third disc, titled &quot;Apple Jam&quot;, four of the five tracks – &quot;Out of the Blue&quot;, &quot;Plug Me In&quot;, &quot;I Remember Jeep&quot; and &quot;Thanks for the Pepperoni&quot; – are improvised instrumentals built around minimal chord changes, or in the case of &quot;Out of the Blue&quot;, a single-chord riff. The title for &quot;I Remember Jeep&quot; originated from the name of Clapton&#x27;s dog, Jeep, and &quot;Thanks for the Pepperoni&quot; came from a line on a Lenny Bruce comedy album. In a December 2000 interview with &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine, Harrison explained: &quot;For the jams, I didn&#x27;t want to just throw [them] in the cupboard, and yet at the same time it wasn&#x27;t part of the record; that&#x27;s why I put it on a separate label to go in the package as a kind of bonus.&quot;

The only vocal selection on &quot;Apple Jam&quot; is &quot;It&#x27;s Johnny&#x27;s Birthday&quot;, sung to the tune of Cliff Richard&#x27;s 1968 hit &quot;Congratulations&quot;, and recorded as a gift from Harrison to Lennon to mark the latter&#x27;s 30th birthday. Like all the &quot;free&quot; tracks on the bonus disc, &quot;It&#x27;s Johnny&#x27;s Birthday&quot; carried a Harrison songwriting credit on the original UK release of &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith/NME&quot;&gt;Alan Smith, &quot;George Harrison: &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; (Apple)&quot;, &quot;NME&quot;, 5 December 1970, p. 2; available at Rock&#x27;s Backpages (subscription required; retrieved 15 July 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; while on the first US copies, the only songwriting information on the record&#x27;s face labels was the standard inclusion of a performing rights organisation, BMI. In December 1970, &quot;Congratulations&quot; songwriters Bill Martin and Phil Coulter claimed royalties, with the result that the composer&#x27;s credit for Harrison&#x27;s track was swiftly changed to acknowledge Martin and Coulter.

===Demo tracks and outtakes===
Aside from the seventeen songs issued on discs one and two of the original album, Harrison recorded at least twenty other songs – either in demo form for Spector&#x27;s benefit, just before recording got officially under way in late May, or as outtakes from the sessions. In a 1992 interview, Harrison commented on the volume of material: &quot;I didn&#x27;t have many tunes on Beatles records, so doing an album like &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; was like going to the bathroom and letting it out.&quot;

Harrison&#x27;s solo performance for Spector included six compositions that, until their inclusion on the Deluxe editions of the album&#x27;s 50th anniversary box set, were only available on bootleg compilations, such as &quot;Beware of ABKCO!&quot; The six songs are: &quot;Window, Window&quot;, another song turned down by the Beatles in January 1969; &quot;Everybody, Nobody&quot;, the melody of which Harrison adapted for &quot;Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp&quot;; &quot;Nowhere to Go&quot;, a second Harrison–Dylan collaboration from November 1968 (originally known as &quot;When Everybody Comes to Town&quot;); and &quot;Cosmic Empire&quot;, &quot;Mother Divine&quot; and &quot;Tell Me What Has Happened to You&quot;. Also from this performance were two tracks that Harrison returned to in later years. He completed &quot;Beautiful Girl&quot; for inclusion on his 1976 album &quot;Thirty Three &amp; 1/3&quot;. &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Do It&quot;, written by Dylan, was Harrison&#x27;s contribution to the soundtrack for the 1985 film &quot;Porky&#x27;s Revenge!&quot;

During the main sessions for &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;, Harrison taped or routined early versions of &quot;You&quot;, &quot;Try Some, Buy Some&quot; and &quot;When Every Song Is Sung&quot;. Harrison offered these three songs to Ronnie Spector in February 1971 for her proposed solo album on Apple Records. After releasing his own versions of &quot;Try Some, Buy Some&quot; and &quot;You&quot;, he offered &quot;When Every Song Is Sung&quot; (since retitled &quot;I&#x27;ll Still Love You&quot;) to former bandmate Ringo Starr for his 1976 album &quot;Ringo&#x27;s Rotogravure&quot;. &quot;Woman Don&#x27;t You Cry for Me&quot;, written in December 1969 as his first slide-guitar composition, was another song that Harrison revisited on &quot;Thirty Three &amp; 1/3&quot;. Harrison included &quot;I Live for You&quot; as the only all-new bonus track on the 2001 reissue of &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;. &quot;Down to the River&quot; remained unused until he reworked it as &quot;Rocking Chair in Hawaii&quot; for his final studio album, the posthumously released &quot;Brainwashed&quot; (2002).

Harrison recorded the following songs during the &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; sessions but, until their inclusion on some editions of the 50th anniversary box set, they had never received an official release:

==Contributing musicians==
The precise line-up of contributing musicians is open to conjecture. Due to the album&#x27;s big sound and the many participants on the sessions, commentators have traditionally referred to the grand, orchestral nature of this line-up. In 2002, music critic Greg Kot described it as &quot;a who&#x27;s who of the decade&#x27;s rock royalty&quot;, while Harris writes of the cast taking on &quot;a Cecil B. De Mille aspect&quot;.

The musicians included Bobby Whitlock, Jim Gordon, Carl Radle, Bobby Keys, Jim Price and Dave Mason, all of whom had recently toured with Delaney &amp; Bonnie. Along with Eric Clapton, there were also musicians whose link with Harrison went back some years, such as Ringo Starr, Billy Preston and German bassist Klaus Voormann, the latter formerly of Manfred Mann and a friend since the Beatles&#x27; years in Hamburg. Handling much of the keyboard work with Whitlock was Gary Wright, who went on to collaborate regularly with Harrison throughout the 1970s.

From within Apple&#x27;s stable of musicians, Harrison recruited the band Badfinger, future Yes drummer Alan White, and Beatles assistant Mal Evans on percussion. Badfinger drummer Mike Gibbins&#x27; powerful tambourine work led to Spector giving him the nickname &quot;Mr Tambourine Man&quot;, after the Dylan song. According to Gibbins, he and White played most of the percussion parts on the album, &quot;switch[ing] on tambourine, sticks, bells, maracas ... whatever was needed&quot;. Gibbins&#x27; bandmates Pete Ham, Tom Evans and Joey Molland provided rhythm acoustic-guitar parts that, in keeping with Spector&#x27;s Wall of Sound principles, were to be &quot;felt but not heard&quot;. Other contributors included Procol Harum&#x27;s Gary Brooker, on keyboards, and pedal steel player Pete Drake, the last of whom Harrison flew over from Nashville for a few days of recording.

Adding to his and Badfinger&#x27;s acoustic guitars on some &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; tracks, Harrison invited Peter Frampton to the sessions. Although uncredited for his contributions, Frampton also played acoustic guitar on the country tracks featuring Drake; he and Harrison later overdubbed further rhythm parts on several songs. Orchestral arranger John Barham also attended the sessions, occasionally contributing on harmonium and vibraphone. Simon Leng consulted Voormann, Barham and Molland for his chapter covering the making of &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; and credits Tony Ashton as one of the keyboard players on both versions of &quot;Isn&#x27;t It a Pity&quot;. Ginger Baker, Clapton&#x27;s former bandmate in Cream and Blind Faith, played drums on the jam track &quot;I Remember Jeep&quot;.

For contractual reasons, on UK pressings of &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;, Clapton&#x27;s participation on the first two discs remained unacknowledged for many years, although he was listed among the musicians appearing on the &quot;Apple Jam&quot; disc. A pre-Genesis Phil Collins played congas at a session for &quot;Art of Dying&quot;. Harrison gave him a credit on the 30th anniversary reissue of the album, but Collins&#x27; playing does not appear on the track. Unsubstantiated claims exist regarding guest appearances by John Lennon, Maurice Gibb and Pink Floyd&#x27;s Richard Wright. In addition, for some years after the album&#x27;s release, rumours claimed that the Band backed Harrison on the country-influenced &quot;Behind That Locked Door&quot;.

==Production==

===Initial recording===

Music historian Richie Unterberger comments that, typical of the Beatles&#x27; solo work, the precise dates for the recording of &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; are uncertain, a situation that contrasts with the &quot;meticulous documentation&quot; available for the band&#x27;s studio activities. According to a contemporaneous report in &quot;Beatles Monthly&quot;, pre-production began on 20 May 1970, the same day as the &quot;Let It Be&quot; film&#x27;s world premiere. Authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter cite this as the probable date for Harrison&#x27;s run-through of songs for Spector. John Leckie, who worked as an EMI tape operator in 1970, recalled that the sessions were preceded by a week of Harrison recording demos, accompanied by Starr and Voormann. The first formal recording session for the album took place at EMI Studios (now Abbey Road Studios) on 26 May, although Unterberger states that &quot;much or all&quot; of that day&#x27;s recording was not used.
The majority of the album&#x27;s backing tracks were taped on 8-track at EMI between late May and the second week of June. The recording engineer was Phil McDonald, with Leckie as his tape operator. Spector recorded most of the backing tracks live, in some cases featuring multiple drummers and keyboard players, and as many as five rhythm guitarists. In Whitlock&#x27;s description, the studio space was a &quot;massive room... two sets of drums on risers, a piano, organ and other keyboards to the wall on the left, up against the far wall on the right were Badfinger, and in the centre were George and Eric and the guitars&quot;. Molland recalled that, to achieve the resonant acoustic guitar sound on songs such as &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot;, he and his bandmates were partitioned off inside a plywood structure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Simons/AcousticGuitar&quot;&gt;David Simons, &quot;The Unsung Beatle: George Harrison&#x27;s behind-the-scenes contributions to the world&#x27;s greatest band&quot;, &quot;Acoustic Guitar&quot;, February 2003, p. 60 (archived version retrieved 6 May 2021).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Voormann, Harrison set up a small altar containing figurines and burning incense, creating an atmosphere in which &quot;everyone felt good.&quot; Having suffered in the Beatles at McCartney&#x27;s tendency to dictate how each musician should play, Harrison allowed the contributors the freedom to express themselves in their playing. All the participants later recalled the project favourably.

The first song recorded was &quot;Wah-Wah&quot;. During the playback, Harrison was shocked at the amount of echo Spector had added, since the performance had sounded relatively dry through the musicians&#x27; headphones.&lt;ref name=&quot;Snow/Mojo p 70&quot;&gt;Mat Snow, &quot;George Harrison: Quiet Storm&quot;, &quot;Mojo&quot;, November 2014, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Voormann immediately &quot;loved&quot; the sound, as did Clapton; Harrison later said: &quot;I grew to like it.&quot;

&quot;What Is Life&quot;, versions one and two of &quot;Isn&#x27;t It a Pity&quot;, and the songs on which Drake participated, such as &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; and &quot;Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp&quot;, were among the other tracks taped then. Preston recalled that Spector&#x27;s approach was to have several keyboards playing the same chords in different octaves, to strengthen the sound. Preston said he had reservations about this approach but &quot;with George&#x27;s stuff it was perfect.&quot; According to White, a &quot;really good bond&quot; formed among the musicians; the main sessions lasted three weeks and &quot;There was no mucking around.&quot; Badfinger participated in five sessions until early June, when they left for an engagement in Hawaii. Molland said they would record two or three songs each day, and that Harrison ran the sessions, rather than Spector. Wright recalls that as the project progressed, the large cast of musicians was pared down. He says that the later recording sessions featured a core group of himself, Harrison, Clapton, Starr or Gordon on drums, and Voormann or Radle playing bass.

The &quot;Apple Jam&quot; instrumentals &quot;Thanks for the Pepperoni&quot; and &quot;Plug Me In&quot;, featuring Harrison, Clapton and Mason each taking extended guitar solos, were recorded later in June, at the Beatles&#x27; Apple Studio, and marked the formation of Clapton, Whitlock, Radle and Gordon&#x27;s short-lived band Derek and the Dominos. Harrison also contributed on guitar to both sides of the band&#x27;s debut single, &quot;Tell the Truth&quot; and &quot;Roll It Over&quot;, which were produced by Spector and recorded at Apple on 18 June. The eleven-minute &quot;Out of the Blue&quot; featured contributions from Keys and Price, both of whom began working with the Rolling Stones around this time. According to Keys in his autobiography &quot;Every Night&#x27;s a Saturday Night&quot;, he and Price added their horns parts to songs such as &quot;What Is Life&quot; after the backing tracks had been recorded. He recalls that Harrison and Price worked out the album&#x27;s horn arrangements together in the studio.

===Delays and distractions===
In his 2010 autobiography, Whitlock describes the &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; sessions as &quot;spectacular in every way&quot;, although he says that the project was informed by Harrison&#x27;s preoccupation with his former bandmates and ongoing difficulties with Klein and Apple. Wright recalls Harrison&#x27;s discomfort when Lennon and Yoko Ono visited the studio, saying: &quot;His vibe was icy as he bluntly remarked, &#x27;What are you doing here?&#x27; It was a very tense moment...&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wright/DailyBeast&quot;&gt;Gary Wright, &quot;When Gary Wright Met George Harrison: Dream Weaver, John and Yoko, and More (Book Excerpt)&quot;, &quot;The Daily Beast&quot;, 29 September 2014 (archived version retrieved 30 October 2020).&lt;/ref&gt; According to Whitlock, Harrison played the couple some of his new music and Lennon &quot;got his socks blown off&quot;, much to Harrison&#x27;s satisfaction. The presence of Harrison&#x27;s friends from the Radha Krishna Temple caused disruption during the sessions, according to Gibbins and Whitlock. While echoing this view, Spector cited this as an example of how Harrison inspired tolerance, since the Temple devotees could be &quot;the biggest pain in the necks in the world&quot; yet Harrison &quot;was spiritual and you knew it&quot;, which &quot;made you like those Krishnas&quot;.
Although Harrison had estimated in a New York radio interview that the solo album would take no more than eight weeks to complete,&lt;ref name=&quot;ContraBand/Pity&quot;&gt;&quot;It&#x27;s Really a Pity&quot;, Contra Band Music, 15 March 2012 (retrieved 19 January 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; recording, overdubbing and mixing on &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; lasted for five months, until late October. Part of the reason for this was Harrison&#x27;s need to make regular visits to Liverpool to tend to his mother, who had been diagnosed with cancer. Spector&#x27;s erratic behaviour during the sessions was another factor affecting progress on the album. Harrison later referred to Spector needing &quot;eighteen cherry brandies&quot; before he could start work, a situation that forced much of the production duties onto Harrison alone. At one point, Spector fell over in the studio and broke his arm. He subsequently withdrew from the project due to what Madinger and Easter term &quot;health reasons&quot;.

Early in July, work on &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; was temporarily brought to a halt as Harrison headed north to see his dying mother for the last time. EMI&#x27;s growing concerns regarding studio costs added to the pressure on Harrison. A further complication, according to Harris, was that Clapton had become infatuated with Harrison&#x27;s wife, Pattie Boyd, and adopted a heroin habit as a means of coping with his guilt.

===Overdubbing===
In Spector&#x27;s absence, Harrison completed the album&#x27;s backing tracks and carried out preliminary overdubs, doing much of the latter work at Trident Studios with former Beatles engineer Ken Scott. Harrison completed this stage of the project on 12 August. He then sent early mixes of many of the songs to his co-producer, who was convalescing in Los Angeles, and Spector replied by letter dated 19 August with suggestions for further overdubs and final mixing. Among Spector&#x27;s comments were detailed suggestions regarding &quot;Let It Down&quot;, the released recording of which Madinger and Easter describe as &quot;the best example of Spector running rampant with the &#x27;Wall of Sound, and an urging that he and Harrison carry out further work on the songs at Trident because of its 16-track recording desk. Spector also made suggestions about overdubbing more instruments and orchestration on some tracks, but encouraged Harrison to focus on his vocals and avoid hiding his voice behind the instrumentation.

John Barham&#x27;s orchestrations were recorded during the next phase of the album&#x27;s production, starting in early September, along with many further contributions from Harrison, such as his lead vocals, slide guitar parts and multi-tracked backing vocals (the latter credited to &quot;the George O&#x27;Hara-Smith Singers&quot;). Barham stayed at Friar Park and created the music scores from melodies that Harrison sang or played to him on piano or guitar. Leng recognises the arrangements on &quot;pivotal&quot; songs such as &quot;Isn&#x27;t It a Pity&quot;, &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot;, &quot;Beware of Darkness&quot; and &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; as important elements of the album&#x27;s sound.

According to Scott, he and Harrison worked alone for &quot;weeks and months&quot; on the overdubs, as Harrison recorded the backing vocals and lead guitar parts. In some cases, they slowed the tape down to allow Harrison to sing the high-register vocal lines. Spector returned to London for the later mixing stage. Scott says that Spector would visit Trident for a few hours and make suggestions on their latest mixes, and that some of Spector&#x27;s suggestions were followed, others not.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fanelli/GW&quot;&gt;Damian Fanelli, &quot;Interview: Abbey Road Engineer Ken Scott Discusses Recording The Beatles&#x27; White Album, Says Sessions Were a &#x27;Blast&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Guitar World&quot;, 30 April 2012 (archived version retrieved 14 November 2020).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Burns/RBMA&quot;&gt;Todd L. Burns (host), &quot;Ken Scott: Red Bull Music Academy Lecture (New York)&quot;, redbullmusicacademy.com, 2013 (retrieved 14 November 2020).&lt;/ref&gt;

Spector has praised Harrison&#x27;s guitar and vocal work on the overdubs, saying: &quot;Perfectionist is not the right word. Anyone can be a perfectionist. He was beyond that ...&quot; Harrison&#x27;s approach to slide guitar incorporated aspects of both Indian music and the blues tradition; he developed a precise playing style and sound that partly evoked the fretless Indian sarod. From its introduction on &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;, Leng writes, Harrison&#x27;s slide guitar became his musical signature – &quot;as instantly recognisable as Dylan&#x27;s harmonica or Stevie Wonder&#x27;s&quot;.

===Final mixing and mastering===

On 9 October, while carrying out final mixing at EMI, Harrison presented Lennon with the recently recorded &quot;It&#x27;s Johnny&#x27;s Birthday&quot;. The track featured Harrison on vocals, harmonium and all other instruments, and vocal contributions from Mal Evans and assistant engineer Eddie Klein. That same month, Harrison finished his production work on Starr&#x27;s 1971 single &quot;It Don&#x27;t Come Easy&quot;, the basic track for which they had recorded with Voormann in March at Trident. Aside from his contributions to projects by Starr, Clapton, Preston and Ashton during 1970, over the following year Harrison would reciprocate the help that his fellow musicians on &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; had given him by contributing to albums by Whitlock, Wright, Badfinger and Keys.

On 28 October, Harrison and Boyd arrived in New York, where he and Spector carried out final preparation for the album&#x27;s release, such as sequencing. Harrison harboured doubts about whether all the songs they had finished were worthy of inclusion. Allan Steckler, Apple Records&#x27; US manager, was &quot;stunned&quot; by the quality of the material and assured Harrison that he should issue all the songs.

Spector&#x27;s signature production style gave &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; a heavy, reverb-oriented sound, which Harrison came to regret. Whitlock says that, typical of Spector&#x27;s Wall of Sound, there was some reverb on the original recordings but the effect was mostly added later. In music journalist David Cavanagh&#x27;s description, once abandoned by his co-producer midway through the summer, Harrison had &quot;proceeded to out-Spector Spector&quot; through the addition of further echo and multiple overdubs. Voormann has said that Harrison &quot;cluttered&quot; the album&#x27;s sound in this way, and &quot;admitted later that he put too much stuff on top&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cavanagh/Uncut p 41&quot;&gt;David Cavanagh, &quot;George Harrison: The Dark Horse&quot;, &quot;Uncut&quot;, August 2008, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Leckie, however, the reverb on tracks such as &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; and &quot;Wah-Wah&quot; was recorded onto tape at the time, because Spector insisted on hearing the effects in place as they worked on the tracks. Outtakes from the recording sessions became available on bootlegs in the 1990s. One such unofficial release, the three-disc &quot;The Making of All Things Must Pass&quot;, contains multiple takes of some of the songs on the album, providing a work-in-progress on the sequence of overdubs onto the backing tracks.

==Artwork==
Harrison commissioned Tom Wilkes to design a hinged box in which to house the three vinyl discs, rather than have them packaged in a triple gatefold cover. Apple insider Tony Bramwell later recalled: &quot;It was a bloody big thing ... You needed arms like an orang-utan to carry half a dozen.&quot; The packaging caused some confusion among retailers, who, at that time, associated boxed albums with opera or classical works.

The stark black-and-white cover photo was taken on the main lawn at Friar Park by Wilkes&#x27; Camouflage Productions partner, Barry Feinstein. Commentators interpret the photograph – showing Harrison seated in the centre of, and towering over, four comical-looking garden gnomes – as representing his removal from the Beatles&#x27; collective identity. The gnomes had recently been delivered to Friar Park and placed on the lawn; seeing the four figures there, and mindful of the message in the album&#x27;s title, Feinstein immediately drew parallels with Harrison&#x27;s former band. Author and music journalist Mikal Gilmore has written that Lennon&#x27;s initial negativity regarding &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; was possibly because he was &quot;irritated&quot; by this cover photo; Harrison biographer Elliot Huntley attributes Lennon&#x27;s reaction to envy during a time when &quot;everything [Harrison] touched turned to gold&quot;.

Apple included a poster with the album, showing Harrison in a darkened corridor of his home, standing in front of an iron-framed window. Wilkes had designed a more adventurous poster, but according to Beatles author Bruce Spizer, Harrison was uncomfortable with the imagery. Some of the Feinstein photographs that Wilkes had incorporated into this original poster design appeared instead on the picture sleeves for the &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; single and its follow-up, &quot;What Is Life&quot;.

==Release==
===Impact===
EMI and its US counterpart, Capitol Records, had originally scheduled the album for release in October 1970, and advance promotion began in September. An &quot;intangible buzz&quot; had been &quot;in the air for months&quot; regarding Harrison&#x27;s solo album, according to Alan Clayson, and &quot;for reasons other than still-potent loyalty to the Fab Four&quot;. Harrison&#x27;s stature as an artist had grown over the past year through the acclaim afforded his songs on &quot;Abbey Road&quot;, as well as the speculation caused by his and Dylan&#x27;s joint recording session in New York. Noting also Harrison&#x27;s role in popularising new acts such as the Band and Delaney &amp; Bonnie, and his association with Clapton and Cream, &quot;NME&quot; critic Bob Woffinden concluded in 1981: &quot;All in all, Harrison&#x27;s credibility was building to a peak.&quot;
&quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; was released on 27 November 1970 in the United States, and on 30 November in Britain, with the rare distinction of having the same Apple catalogue number (STCH 639) in both countries. Often credited as rock&#x27;s first triple album, it was the first triple set of previously unissued music by a single act, the multi-artist &quot;&quot; live album having preceded it by six months. Adding to the commercial appeal of Harrison&#x27;s songs, &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; appeared at a time when religion and spirituality had become a trend among Western youth. Apple issued &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; as the album&#x27;s first single, as a double A-side with &quot;Isn&#x27;t It a Pity&quot; in the majority of countries. Discussing the song&#x27;s cultural impact, Gilmore credits &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; with being &quot;as pervasive on radio and in youth consciousness as anything the Beatles had produced&quot;.

Another factor behind the album&#x27;s first weeks of release was Harrison&#x27;s meeting with McCartney in New York, the failure of which led to McCartney filing suit in London&#x27;s High Court to dissolve the Beatles&#x27; legal partnership. Songs such as &quot;Wah-Wah&quot;, &quot;Apple Scruffs&quot;, &quot;Isn&#x27;t It a Pity&quot; and &quot;Run of the Mill&quot; resonated with listeners as documents of the group&#x27;s dysfunction. In the fallout to the break-up, according to journalist Kitty Empire, Harrison&#x27;s triple album &quot;functioned as a kind of repository for grief&quot; for the band&#x27;s fans.

===Commercial performance===

&quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; was highly successful, topping singles charts around the world during the first few months of 1971. It was the first solo single by a former Beatle to be number 1 in the UK or the US, and became the most performed song of that year. Issued in February 1971, the second single, &quot;What Is Life&quot; backed with &quot;Apple Scruffs&quot;, also became an international hit.

&quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; was number 1 on the UK&#x27;s official albums chart for eight weeks, although until 2006, chart records incorrectly stated that it had peaked at number 4. On &quot;Melody Maker&quot;″s national chart, the album was also number 1 for eight weeks, from 6 February to 27 March, six of which coincided with &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; topping the magazine&#x27;s singles chart. In America, &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; spent seven weeks at number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LP&#x27;s chart, from 2 January until 20 February, and a similarly long period atop the listings compiled by &quot;Cash Box&quot; and &quot;Record World&quot;; for three of those weeks, &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; held the top spot on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. In Canada the album hit number 1 on just its 3rd week, was number 1 for 9 weeks, and was on the charts for 31 weeks, ending July 17, 1971.

The extent of Harrison&#x27;s success surprised the music industry and largely overshadowed Lennon&#x27;s concurrently released &quot;Plastic Ono Band&quot; album, which Spector also co-produced. Writing in the April 2001 issue of &quot;Record Collector&quot;, Peter Doggett described Harrison as &quot;arguably the most successful rock star on the planet&quot; at the start of 1971, with &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; &quot;easily outstripping other solo Beatles projects later in the year, such as [McCartney&#x27;s] &quot;Ram&quot; and [Lennon&#x27;s] &quot;Imagine&quot;&quot;. Harrison&#x27;s so-called &quot;&quot;Billboard&quot; double&quot; – whereby one artist simultaneously holds the top positions on the magazine&#x27;s albums and singles listings – was a feat that none of his former bandmates equalled until Paul McCartney and Wings repeated the achievement in June 1973. At the 1972 Grammy Awards, &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; was nominated for Album of the Year and &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; for Record of the Year, but Harrison lost out in both categories to Carole King.

&quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; was awarded a gold disc by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on 17 December 1970 and it has since been certified seven times platinum by the RIAA. In January 1975, the Canadian Recording Industry Association announced that it had been certified as a platinum album in Canada. According to John Bergstrom of &quot;PopMatters&quot;, as of January 2011, &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; had sold more than &quot;Imagine&quot; and McCartney and Wings&#x27; &quot;Band on the Run&quot; (1973) combined. Also writing in 2011, Lennon and Harrison biographer Gary Tillery describes it as &quot;the most successful album ever released by an ex-Beatle&quot;. According to Hamish Champ&#x27;s 2018 book &quot;The 100 Best-Selling Albums of the 70s&quot;, in the US, &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; is the 33rd-best-selling album from the 1970s.

==Critical reception==

===Contemporary reviews===
&quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; received almost universal critical acclaim on release – as much for the music and lyrical content as for the fact that, of all the former Beatles, it was the work of supposed junior partner George Harrison. Harrison had usually contributed just two songs to a Beatles album; in author Robert Rodriguez&#x27;s description, critics&#x27; attention was now centred on &quot;a major talent unleashed, one who&#x27;d been hidden in plain sight all those years&quot; behind Lennon and McCartney. &quot;That the Quiet Beatle was capable of such range&quot;, Rodriguez continues, &quot;from the joyful &#x27;What Is Life&#x27; to the meditative &#x27;Isn&#x27;t It a Pity&#x27; to the steamrolling &#x27;Art of Dying&#x27; to the playful &#x27;I Dig Love&#x27; – was revelatory.&quot; Most reviewers tended to discount the third disc of studio jams, accepting that it was a &quot;free&quot; addition to justify the set&#x27;s high retail price, although Anthony DeCurtis recognises &quot;Apple Jam&quot; as further evidence of the album&#x27;s &quot;bracing air of creative liberation&quot;.

Ben Gerson of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; deemed &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; &quot;both an intensely personal statement and a grandiose gesture, a triumph over artistic modesty&quot; and referenced the three-record set as an &quot;extravaganza of piety and sacrifice and joy, whose sheer magnitude and ambition may dub it the &quot;War and Peace&quot; of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll&quot;. Gerson also lauded the album&#x27;s production as being &quot;of classic Spectorian proportions, Wagnerian, Brucknerian, the music of mountain tops and vast horizons&quot;. In the &quot;NME&quot;, Alan Smith referred to Harrison&#x27;s songs as &quot;music of the mind&quot;, adding: &quot;they search and they wander, as if in the soft rhythms of a dream, and in the end he has set them to words which are often both profound and profoundly beautiful.&quot; &quot;Billboard&quot;″s reviewer hailed &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; as &quot;a masterful blend of rock and piety, technical brilliance and mystic mood, and relief from the tedium of everyday rock&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;BB review/google&quot;&gt;&quot;Album Reviews&quot;, &quot;Billboard&quot;, 19 December 1970, p. 50 (retrieved 28 November 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Melody Maker&quot;″s Richard Williams summed up the surprise many felt at Harrison&#x27;s apparent transformation: &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;, he said, provided &quot;the rock equivalent of the shock felt by pre-war moviegoers when Garbo first opened her mouth in a talkie: Garbo talks! – Harrison is free!&quot; In another review, for &quot;The Times&quot;, Williams opined that, of all the Beatles&#x27; solo releases thus far, Harrison&#x27;s album &quot;makes far and away the best listening, perhaps because it is the one which most nearly continues the tradition they began eight years ago&quot;. William Bender of &quot;Time&quot; magazine described it as an &quot;expressive, classically executed personal statement ... one of the outstanding rock albums in years&quot;, while Tom Zito of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; predicted that it would influence the discourse on &quot;the [real] genius behind the Beatles&quot;.

In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Don Heckman deemed the album &quot;a release that shouldn&#x27;t be missed&quot; and outlined his &quot;complex&quot; reaction to being presented with a sequence of Harrison songs for the first time: &quot;amazement at the range of Harrison&#x27;s talents; fascination at the effects of Phil Spector&#x27;s participation as the album&#x27;s producer; curiosity about the many messages that waft through the Harrison songs&quot;. John Gabree of &quot;High Fidelity&quot; described it as &quot;the big album of the year&quot; and a &quot;unified yet tremendously varied&quot; work. In response to rumours that the Beatles were due to reunite, Gabree said that, on the strength of the Harrison and Lennon solo albums, &quot;I, for one, don&#x27;t care if they ever do.&quot;

===Retrospective assessments===

While &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; was described as sounding contemporary in 1970, it was described by critics as dated and faddish later in the decade. &quot;Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau, having bemoaned in 1971 that it was characterised by &quot;overblown fatuity&quot; and uninteresting music, wrote in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981) of the album&#x27;s &quot;featurelessness&quot;, &quot;right down to the anonymity of the multitracked vocals&quot;. In their book &quot;The Beatles: An Illustrated Record&quot;, Roy Carr and Tony Tyler were likewise lukewarm in their assessment, criticising the &quot;homogeneity&quot; of the production and &quot;the lugubrious nature of Harrison&#x27;s composing&quot;. Writing in &quot;The Beatles Forever&quot; in 1977, however, Nicholas Schaffner praised the album as the &quot;crowning glory&quot; of Harrison&#x27;s and Spector&#x27;s careers, and highlighted &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; and &quot;Beware of Darkness&quot; as the &quot;two most eloquent songs ... musically as well as lyrically&quot;.

AllMusic&#x27;s Richie Unterberger views &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; as &quot;[Harrison&#x27;s] best ... a very moving work&quot;, and Roger Catlin of MusicHound describes the set as &quot;epic and audacious&quot;, its &quot;dense production and rich songs topped off by the extra album of jamming&quot;. Unterberger has also written that while the Beatles&#x27; break-up remains a source of sorrow for many listeners, &quot;it&#x27;s impossible not to rejoice in George&#x27;s greatest triumph&quot; and that, as further evidenced in the bootlegs of outtakes from the sessions, Lennon, McCartney and Beatles producer George Martin undervalued not just Harrison&#x27;s songwriting abilities but also his talent as a producer. &quot;Q&quot; magazine considers the album to be an exemplary fusion of &quot;rock and religion&quot;, as well as &quot;the single most satisfying collection of any solo Beatle&quot;. Filmmaker Martin Scorsese has written of the &quot;powerful sense of the ritualistic on the album&quot;, adding: &quot;I remember feeling that it had the grandeur of liturgical music, of the bells used in Tibetan Buddhist ceremonies.&quot; Writing for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 2002, Greg Kot described this grandeur as an &quot;echo-laden cathedral of rock in excelsis&quot; where the &quot;real stars&quot; are Harrison&#x27;s songs; in the same publication, Mikal Gilmore labelled the album &quot;the finest solo work any ex-Beatle ever produced&quot;.

In his 2001 review for &quot;Mojo&quot;, John Harris said that &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; &quot;remains the best Beatles solo album ... oozing both the goggle-eyed joy of creative emancipation and the sense of someone pushing himself to the limit&quot;. In another 2001 review, for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, Kot wrote: &quot;Neither Lennon nor McCartney, let alone Ringo Starr, ever put out a solo album more accomplished than &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;... In subsequent years, Lennon and McCartney would strive mightily to scale the same heights as &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; with solo works such as &quot;Imagine&quot; and &quot;Band on the Run&quot;, but they would never top it.&quot; Nigel Williamson of &quot;Uncut&quot; said that the album includes some of Harrison&#x27;s best songs in &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot;, &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; and &quot;Beware of Darkness&quot;, and stands as &quot;George&#x27;s finest... and arguably the best post-Beatles solo album of them all&quot;.

In &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (2004), Mac Randall writes that the album is exceptional, but &quot;a tad overrated&quot; by those critics who tend to overlook how its last 30 minutes comprise &quot;a bunch of instrumental blues jams that nobody listens to more than once&quot;. Unterberger similarly cites the inclusion of &quot;Apple Jam&quot; as &quot;a very significant flaw&quot;, while recognising that its content &quot;proved to be of immense musical importance&quot;, with the formation of Derek and the Dominos. Writing for &quot;Pitchfork&quot; in 2016, Jayson Greene said that Harrison was the only former Beatle who &quot;changed the terms of what an album could be&quot; since, although &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; was not the first rock triple LP, &quot;in the cultural imagination, it is &quot;the&quot; first triple album, the first one released as a pointed statement.&quot;

==Legacy==

Author Mark Ribowsky says that &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; &quot;forged the seventies first new rock idiom&quot;, while music historian David Howard writes that the album&#x27;s combination of expansive hard rock and &quot;intimate acoustic-confessionals&quot; made it the touchstone for the early 1970s rock sound. Another &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; critic, James Hunter, commented in 2001 on how &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; &quot;helped define the decade it ushered in&quot;, in that &quot;the cast, the length, the long hair falling on suede-covered shoulders ... foretold the sprawl and sleepy ambition of the Seventies.&quot;

In his &quot;PopMatters&quot; review, John Bergstrom likens &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; to &quot;the sound of Harrison exhaling&quot;, adding: &quot;He was quite possibly the only Beatle who was completely satisfied with the Beatles being gone.&quot; Bergstrom credits the album with heavily influencing bands such as ELO, My Morning Jacket, Fleet Foxes and Grizzly Bear, as well as helping bring about the dream pop phenomenon. In Harris&#x27; view, the &quot;widescreen sound&quot; used by Harrison and Spector on some of the tracks was a forerunner to recordings by ELO and Oasis.

Among Harrison&#x27;s biographers, Simon Leng views &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; as a &quot;paradox of an album&quot;: as eager as Harrison was to break free from his identity as a Beatle, Leng suggests, many of the songs document the &quot;Kafkaesque chain of events&quot; of life within the band and so added to the &quot;mythologized history&quot; he was looking to escape. Ian Inglis notes 1970&#x27;s place in an era marking &quot;the new supremacy of the singer-songwriter&quot;, through such memorable albums as Simon &amp; Garfunkel&#x27;s &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water&quot;, Neil Young&#x27;s &quot;After the Gold Rush&quot;, Van Morrison&#x27;s &quot;Moondance&quot; and Joni Mitchell&#x27;s &quot;Ladies of the Canyon&quot;, but that none of these &quot;possessed the startling impact&quot; of &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;. Harrison&#x27;s triple album, Inglis writes, &quot;[would] elevate &#x27;the third Beatle&#x27; into a position that, for a time at least, comfortably eclipsed that of his former bandmates&quot;.

Writing for &quot;Spectrum Culture&quot;, Kevin Korber describes the album as a celebration of &quot;the power that music and art can have if we are free to create it and experience it on our own terms&quot;, and therefore &quot;perhaps the greatest thing to come out of the breakup of the Beatles&quot;. Jim Irvin considers it to be &quot;a sharper clutch of songs than &quot;Imagine&quot;, more individual than &quot;Band on the Run&quot;&quot; and concludes, &quot;It&#x27;s hard to think of many bigger-hearted, more human and more welcoming records than this.&quot;

&quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; features in music reference books such as &quot;The Mojo Collection: The Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;, Robert Dimery&#x27;s &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot; and Tom Moon&#x27;s &quot;1,000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die&quot;. In 1999, &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; appeared at number 9 on &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s &quot;Alternative Top 100 Albums&quot; list, where the editor described it as the &quot;best, mellowest and most sophisticated&quot; of all the Beatles&#x27; solo efforts. In 2006, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; placed it at number 82 on the site&#x27;s &quot;Top 100 Albums of the 1970s&quot;. It was ranked 433rd on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; in 2012 and 368th on the 2020 updated list. &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; has also appeared in the following critics&#x27; best-album books and lists, among others: the Paul Gambaccini-compiled &quot;Critic&#x27;s Choice: Top 200 Albums&quot; (1978; ranked number 79), &quot;The Times&quot;″ &quot;100 Best Albums of All Time&quot; (1993; number 79), Allan Kozinn&#x27;s &quot;The 100 Greatest Pop Albums of the Century&quot; (published in 2000), &quot;Q&quot;″s &quot;The 50 (+50) Best British Albums Ever&quot; (2004), &quot;Mojo&quot;″s &quot;70 of the Greatest Albums of the 70s&quot; (2006), the &quot;NME&quot;″s &quot;100 Greatest British Albums Ever&quot; (2006; number 86), &quot;Paste&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;The 70 Best Albums of the 1970s&quot; (2012; number 27), and Craig Mathieson and Toby Creswell&#x27;s &quot;The 100 Best Albums of All Time&quot; (2013).

In January 2014, &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, an award bestowed by the Recording Academy &quot;to honor recordings of lasting qualitative or historical significance that are at least 25 years old&quot;. Colin Hanks titled his 2015 film &quot;All Things Must Pass: The Rise and Fall of Tower Records&quot; after the album and, with the blessing of Harrison&#x27;s widow, Olivia Harrison, used the title track over the end credits.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kubernik/MusicConnection&quot;&gt;Harvey Kubernik, &quot;George Harrison &#x27;All Things Must Pass&#x27; 50th Anniversary&quot;, &quot;Music Connection&quot;, 10 November 2020 (retrieved 12 November 2020).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent releases==

===2001===

To mark the 30th anniversary of the album&#x27;s release, Harrison supervised a remastered edition of &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;, which was issued in January 2001, less than a year before his death from cancer at the age of 58. Ken Scott engineered the reissue, which was remastered by Jon Astley. Harrison and Scott were shocked at the amount of reverb they had used in 1970 and were keen to remix the album, but EMI vetoed the idea.

The reissue appeared on Gnome Records, a label set up by Harrison for the project. Harrison also oversaw revisions to Wilkes and Feinstein&#x27;s album artwork, which included a colourised &quot;George &amp; the Gnomes&quot; front cover and, on the two CD sleeves and the album booklet, further examples of this cover image showing an imaginary, gradual encroachment of urbanisation on the Friar Park landscape. The latter series served to illustrate Harrison&#x27;s dismay at &quot;the direction the world seemed headed at the start of the millennium&quot;, Gary Tillery observes, a direction that was &quot;so far afield from the Age of Aquarius that had been the dream of the sixties&quot;. Harrison launched a website dedicated to the reissue, which offered, in the description of Chuck Miller of &quot;Goldmine&quot; magazine, &quot;graphics and sounds and little Macromedia-created gnomes dancing and giggling and playing guitars in a Terry Gilliam-esque world&quot;.

Titled &quot;All Things Must Pass: 30th Anniversary Edition&quot;, the new album contained five bonus tracks, including &quot;I Live for You&quot;, two of the songs performed for Spector at EMI Studios in May 1970 (&quot;Beware of Darkness&quot; and &quot;Let It Down&quot;) and &quot;My Sweet Lord (2000)&quot;, a partial re-recording of Harrison&#x27;s biggest solo hit. In addition, Harrison resequenced the content of &quot;Apple Jam&quot; so that the album closed with &quot;Out of the Blue&quot;, as he had originally intended. Assisting Harrison with overdubs on the bonus tracks were his son, Dhani Harrison, singer Sam Brown and percussionist Ray Cooper, all of whom contributed to the recording of &quot;Brainwashed&quot; around this time. According to Scott, Harrison had suggested they include a bonus disc containing recollections from some of the album&#x27;s contributors, starting with Ringo Starr. The idea was abandoned since Starr could not remember playing on the sessions at all.

With Harrison undertaking extensive promotional work, the 2001 reissue was a critical and commercial success. Having underestimated the album&#x27;s popularity, Capitol faced a back order of 20,000 copies in America. There, the reissue debuted at number 4 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top Pop Catalog Albums chart and topped the magazine&#x27;s Internet Album Sales listings. In the UK, it peaked at number 68 on the national albums chart. Writing in &quot;Record Collector&quot;, Doggett described this success as &quot;a previously unheard-of achievement for a reissue&quot;.

Following Harrison&#x27;s death on 29 November 2001, &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; returned to the US charts, climbing to number 6 and number 7, respectively, on the Top Pop Catalog and Internet Album Sales charts. With the release on iTunes of much of the Harrison catalogue, in October 2007, the album re-entered the US Top Pop Catalog chart, peaking at number 3.

===2010===
For the 40th anniversary of &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;, EMI reissued the album in its original configuration, in a limited-edition box set of three vinyl LPs, on 26 November 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;Glide/40Anniv&quot;&gt;&quot;George Harrison 40th Anniv &#x27;All Things Must Pass&#x27; 3 LP Collection&quot;, Glide Magazine, 4 November 2010 (retrieved 7 December 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Each copy was individually numbered. In what Bergstrom views as a contrast with the more aggressive marketing campaign run simultaneously by John Lennon&#x27;s estate, to commemorate Lennon&#x27;s 70th birthday, a digitally remastered 24-bit version of the album was made available for download from Harrison&#x27;s official website. The reissue coincided with the Harrison estate&#x27;s similarly low-key&lt;ref name=&quot;Marchese/Second Disc&quot;&gt;Joe Marchese, &quot;Review: Ravi Shankar and George Harrison, &#x27;Collaborations&#x27;&quot;, theseconddisc.com, 8 November 2010 (retrieved 10 March 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; release of the Ravi Shankar–George Harrison box set &quot;Collaborations&quot; and East Meets West Music&#x27;s reissue of &quot;Raga&quot;, the long-unavailable documentary on Shankar that Harrison had helped release through Apple Films in 1971.

===2014===
&quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; was remastered again for the eight-disc Harrison box set &quot;The Apple Years 1968–75&quot;, issued in September 2014.&lt;ref name=&quot;Horowitz/AmSong&quot;&gt;Hal Horowitz, &quot;George Harrison: &quot;The Apple Years, 1968–75&quot;&quot;, &quot;American Songwriter&quot;, 23 September 2014 (retrieved 4 October 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; Also available as a separate, double-CD release, the reissue reproduces Harrison&#x27;s 2001 liner notes&lt;ref name=&quot;Marchese/Review&quot;&gt;Joe Marchese, &quot;Review: The George Harrison Remasters – &#x27;The Apple Years 1968–1975&#x27;&quot;, theseconddisc.com, 23 September 2014 (retrieved 4 October 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; and includes the same five bonus tracks that appeared on the 30th anniversary edition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grow/RSonline&quot;&gt;Kory Grow, &quot;George Harrison&#x27;s First Six Studio Albums to Get Lavish Reissues&quot; , rollingstone.com, 2 September 2014 (retrieved 4 October 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the box set&#x27;s DVD contains the promotional film created for the 2001 reissue.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marchese/SecondDisc&quot;&gt;Joe Marchese, &quot;Give Me Love: George Harrison&#x27;s &#x27;Apple Years&#x27; Are Collected On New Box Set&quot;, theseconddisc.com, 2 September 2014 (retrieved 4 October 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

===2020–2021===
On 27 November 2020, the Harrison family released a stereo remix of the song &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; to mark the album&#x27;s 50th anniversary. Dhani Harrison described it as a prelude to further releases related to the anniversary. That same month, as part of its &quot;Archive on 4&quot; series, BBC Radio 4 broadcast &quot;All Things Must Pass at 50&quot;, a one-hour special presented by Nitin Sawhney.

On 10 June 2021, the release of a 50th anniversary edition was officially announced for 6 August. The reissue is available in seven varieties, from Standard vinyl and CD editions up to an Uber Deluxe Edition box set.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sinclair/SDE&quot;&gt;Paul Sinclair, &quot;George Harrison / All Things Must Pass 50th anniversary editions&quot;, &quot;Super Deluxe Edition&quot;, 10 June 2021 (retrieved 14 June 2021).&lt;/ref&gt; The most extensive editions contain 70 tracks across 5 CDs/8LPs, including outtakes, jams and 47 demos, 42 of which are previously unreleased, and a scrapbook containing archival notes and track-by-track annotation curated by Olivia Harrison. The Uber Deluxe set adds a 44-page book on the creation of the 1970 triple album,&lt;ref name=&quot;Friedman/Paste&quot;&gt;Jason Friedman, &quot;George Harrison&#x27;s &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; Getting 50th Anniversary Deluxe Reissue&quot;, &quot;Paste&quot;, 10 June 2021 (retrieved 10 June 2021).&lt;/ref&gt; along with scale replica figurines of Harrison and the Friar Park gnomes, an illustration by Voormann, and Paramahansa Yogananda&#x27;s text &quot;Light from the Great Ones&quot;, among other extras.

On Metacritic, the Super Deluxe Edition has an aggregate score of 92 out of 100, based on eight reviews – indicating what the website defines as &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. The release received maximum scores from &quot;Mojo&quot;, &quot;The Times&quot;, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, the &quot;Daily Express&quot;, &quot;Uncut&quot; and &quot;American Songwriter&quot;. It peaked at number 6 in the UK and number 7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in the US; in other &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, it topped the listings for Top Rock Albums, Catalog Albums and Tastemaker Albums, and placed at number 2 on Top Albums Sales. The 50th anniversary release also peaked at number 2 in Germany and number 3 in Switzerland, among other top-ten international chart placings. In 2022, the 50th anniversary box set won the Grammy Award for Best Boxed or Special Limited Edition Package.

<text>William Shankly (2 September 1913 – 29 September 1981) was a Scottish football player and manager who is best known for his time as manager of Liverpool. Shankly brought success to Liverpool, gaining promotion to the First Division and winning three League Championships and the UEFA Cup. He laid foundations on which his successors Bob Paisley and Joe Fagan were able to build by winning seven league titles and four European Cups in the ten seasons after Shankly retired in 1974. A charismatic, iconic figure at the club, his oratory stirred the emotions of the fanbase. In 2019, 60 years after Shankly arrived at Liverpool, Tony Evans of &quot;The Independent&quot; wrote, &quot;Shankly created the idea of Liverpool, transforming the football club by emphasising the importance of the Kop and making supporters feel like participants&quot;.

Shankly came from a small Scottish mining community and was one of five brothers who played football professionally. He played as a ball-winning right-half and was capped twelve times for Scotland, including seven wartime internationals. He spent one season at Carlisle United before spending the rest of his career at Preston North End, with whom he won the FA Cup in 1938. His playing career was interrupted by his service in the Royal Air Force during the Second World War. He became a manager after he retired from playing in 1949, returning to Carlisle United. He later managed Grimsby Town, Workington and Huddersfield Town before moving to become Liverpool manager in December 1959.

Shankly took charge of Liverpool when they were in the Second Division and rebuilt the team into a major force in English and European football. He led Liverpool to the Second Division Championship to gain promotion to the top-flight First Division in 1962, before going on to win three First Division Championships, two FA Cups, four Charity Shields and one UEFA Cup. It was during Shankly&#x27;s tenure that the club changed to an all-red home strip, and &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone&quot; became the club&#x27;s anthem. Shankly announced his surprise retirement from football a few weeks after Liverpool had won the 1974 FA Cup Final, having managed the club for 15 years, and was succeeded by his long-time assistant Bob Paisley. He led the Liverpool team out for the last time at Wembley for the 1974 FA Charity Shield. He died seven years later, aged 68. Considered one of the greatest football managers of all time, Shankly was among the inaugural inductees into the English Football Hall of Fame in 2002, and the Scottish Football Hall of Fame in 2004.

==Early life==

Bill Shankly was born in the small Scottish coal mining village of Glenbuck, Ayrshire, whose population in 1913, the year of Shankly&#x27;s birth, was around 700. People born there would often move to find work in larger coal mines. As a result, Glenbuck became largely derelict and by the time Shankly&#x27;s ghost writer John Roberts visited it in 1976, there were only 12 houses left, including a cottage owned by Shankly&#x27;s sister, Elizabeth, whom Roberts described as &quot;the last of the children of Glenbuck&quot;.

Shankly&#x27;s parents, John and Barbara, lived in one of the Auchenstilloch Cottages with their 10 children; five boys and five girls. William was the ninth child and the youngest boy. Although he was known as Bill throughout his football career, his name in the family was Willie, pronounced [&quot;Wullie&quot;]. His father was a postman who became a tailor of handmade suits. Despite the football pedigree in his family, he did not play himself.

All five Shankly brothers played professional football and Shankly claimed they could have beaten any five brothers in the world when they were all at their peaks. His brothers were Alec, known as Sandy by the family, who played for Ayr United and Clyde; Jimmy (1902–1972), who played for various clubs including Sheffield United and Southend United; John (1903–1960), who played for Portsmouth and Luton Town; and Bob (1910–1982), who played for Alloa Athletic and Falkirk. Bob became a successful manager, guiding Dundee to victory in the Scottish championship in 1962 and the semi-finals of the European Cup the following year. Their maternal uncles, Robert and William Blyth were professional players who both became club directors at Portsmouth and Carlisle United respectively.

Shankly wrote in his autobiography that times were hard during his upbringing and that hunger was a prevailing condition, especially during the winter months. He admitted that he and his friends used to steal vegetables from nearby farms; bread, biscuits and fruit from suppliers&#x27; wagons, and bags of coal from the pits. Shankly admitted the act was wrong but insisted it was done out of devilment only because the root cause was their constant hunger. He said that he and his friends learned from their mistakes and became better people in later years. He was at school from age five until 14. Discipline at both home and school was strict but Shankly said it was character-building. His favourite subject was geography and he played football as often as possible, especially in the school playground, but there was no organised school team.

After Shankly left school in 1928, he worked at a local mine alongside his brother Bob. He did this for two years until the pit closed and he faced unemployment. In his autobiography, he described the life of a miner at some length and mentioned many of the problems such as the sheer hard work, rats, the difficulties of eating and drinking at the coal face. The worst problem was the filth because the miners never felt really clean, even though they would go home to wash in a tub after each shift.

While Shankly was employed as a miner, he played football as often as possible and sometimes went to Glasgow to watch either Celtic or Rangers, sharing his allegiance between the two and ignoring the sectarianism that divides Glasgow. Shankly developed his skills to the point that he was unemployed for only a few months before Carlisle United signed him. He wrote that he had his football future worked out in his mind and that, even when working in the pit, he was only &quot;killing time&quot;. He always believed that it was only a matter of time before he became a professional player. He explained that, in football terms, he had always been an optimist with a belief in his destiny and that was the basis of his undying enthusiasm for the sport.

Shankly&#x27;s village team was called the Glenbuck Cherrypickers, a name probably derived from the 11th Hussars (the &quot;Cherry Pickers&quot;), but he said the club was near extinction when he had a trial and he never actually played for them. Shankly, aged 18, then played part of the 1931–32 season for Cronberry Eglinton, about 12 miles from Glenbuck. He used to cycle to and from the ground. Cronberry were in the Cumnock &amp; District League. Although Shankly had less than one full season at Cronberry, he acknowledged his debt to Scottish Junior Football as he learned a lot, mainly by listening to older players and especially his brothers.

==Playing career==

===Carlisle United===
Shankly had a single season, 1932–33, at Carlisle United, then relatively new to the Football League and playing in the Third Division North, their reserve side playing in the North Eastern League. Shankly was recommended by a scout called Peter Carruthers who had seen him playing for Cronberry. He was invited for a month&#x27;s trial and said it was the first time he had left Scotland. He was signed after just one trial match for Carlisle&#x27;s reserves against Middlesbrough reserves, even though Carlisle reserves lost the match 6–0. A local newspaper report said that he had worked hard and might develop into a useful left back. In fact, he developed into a top-class right-half.

Shankly made his senior debut on 31 December 1932 in a 2–2 draw against Rochdale and made 16 appearances for the first team. At the end of the season, the reserves won the North Eastern League Cup, defeating Newcastle United reserves 1–0 in the final. In his 1976 autobiography, Shankly stated that he still had the medal.

At this stage of his career, Shankly was assessed as &quot;a hard running, gritty right-half&quot; whose displays brought him much praise and credit. He was considered a promising key young player who was capable of taking Carlisle to greater things. He was paid four pounds ten shillings a week at Carlisle which he considered a good wage as the top rate at that time was eight pounds. Shankly was happy at Carlisle which was close to his home at Glenbuck and he had settled in well with almost a guarantee of first team football. When the opportunity came for him to move on, he was not convinced he wanted to leave.

===Preston North End===
Soon after the 1932–33 season ended, Shankly received a telegram from Carlisle United asking him to return as soon as possible because another club wanted to sign him. Arriving at Carlisle, he discovered that the interested club was Preston North End who had offered a transfer fee of £500. The terms for Shankly personally were a fee of £50 plus a £10 signing-on fee and wages of five pounds a week (). Shankly&#x27;s initial reaction was that it was not enough and the deal nearly fell through. His brother Alec pointed out to him that Preston were in the Second Division and a bigger club than Carlisle with the potential to regain First Division status. Alec persuaded him that the opportunity was more important than what he would be paid immediately, stressing that it was what he would get later that counted. Shankly took his brother&#x27;s advice and signed the Preston contract in a railway carriage.

Shankly began his Preston career in the reserves, who played in the Central League which was a higher standard than the North Eastern League. He made his first team debut on 9 December 1933, three months after his 20th birthday, against Hull City. Shankly created an early goal to help Preston win 5–0, earning him praise in a national newspaper for his &quot;clever passing&quot;. With his wholehearted attitude and commitment to the team, he quickly established himself as a first-team regular and became a crowd favourite. Preston fulfilled their potential and gained promotion to the First Division as runners-up to Grimsby Town. It was therefore a successful debut season for Shankly who stayed with Preston until he retired in 1949. His wage was increased to eight pounds a week with six pounds in the summer. In a summary of the 1933–34 season, a Preston correspondent, Walter Pilkington, wrote:

One of this season&#x27;s discoveries, Bill Shankly, played with rare tenacity and uncommonly good ideas for a lad of 20. He is full of good football and possessed with unlimited energy; he should go far.

In his autobiography, Shankly wrote that Preston had more than held their own in the 1934–35 season and the club was not relegated again until the end of the 1948–49 season in which he left them. Shankly developed into a tough half back, as good as any in the Football League. The outstanding Northern Ireland international Peter Doherty recalled how Shankly dogged his footsteps in one match and kept muttering: &quot;Great wee team, North End, great wee team&quot;, subduing Doherty completely as Preston defeated Manchester City 3–1.

In 1936–37, Preston reached the FA Cup Final but were well beaten 3–1 by Sunderland at Wembley Stadium. Preston recovered to reach the 1938 FA Cup Final in which they defeated Huddersfield Town 1–0 with a penalty scored by George Mutch in the final minute of extra time. As well as winning the FA Cup, Preston finished third in the league. That season marked the pinnacle of Shankly&#x27;s playing career.

Shankly had just reached his 26th birthday when the Second World War began and the war claimed the peak years of his playing career. He joined the Royal Air Force (RAF) and managed to play in numerous wartime league, cup and exhibition matches for Norwich City, Arsenal, Luton Town, Cardiff City, Lovell&#x27;s Athletic F.C. and Partick Thistle, depending on where he was stationed (winning the Summer Cup with the Glasgow club in 1945). On 30 May 1942, he played a single game for Liverpool in a 4–1 win over Everton at Anfield. Shankly was keen on boxing and fought as a middleweight in the RAF, winning a trophy when he was stationed in Manchester. He confirmed in his autobiography that his weight as an RAF boxer was 159 pounds (72 kg) and he was only six pounds (2.7 kg) heavier than that in 1976. Shankly met his wife, Nessie, in the RAF (she was in the WAAF and stationed at the same camp) and they married in 1944.

With the resumption of full League football again in the 1946–47 season, Shankly returned to Preston who held his registration, but he was now 33 and coming to the end of his playing days. By 1949, he was Preston&#x27;s club captain but had lost his place in the first team, which was struggling against relegation despite having Tom Finney in the side. Shankly was a qualified masseur and had decided he wanted to become a coach so, when Carlisle United asked him to become their manager in March of that year, he retired as a player and accepted the job. Shankly&#x27;s departure from Preston was resented by some at the club and he was refused a benefit match, to which he felt entitled. He described Preston&#x27;s attitude as the biggest let-down of his life in football.

Shankly had enormous admiration for Tom Finney and devotes more than three pages of his autobiography to Finney&#x27;s prowess as a footballer. In the 1970s, Shankly was asked how a current star compared to Finney and Shankly replied: &quot;Aye, he&#x27;s as good as Tommy – but then Tommy&#x27;s nearly 60 now&quot;. Another Preston player admired by Shankly was his Scottish international teammate Andy Beattie, with whom he would later work in management. Shankly was succeeded in the Preston team by Tommy Docherty and Shankly told Docherty that he should just put the number four shirt on and let it run round by itself because it knows where to go.

===Scotland===
Shankly played for Scotland 12 times from 1938 to 1943 in five full and seven wartime internationals. He spoke of his &quot;unbelievable pride&quot; when playing for Scotland against England and how, when confronted by the &quot;Auld Enemy&quot;, the Scottish players would become William Wallace or Robert the Bruce for 90 minutes after pulling on the blue jersey. Shankly himself certainly had that spirit when playing for Scotland as confirmed by Alex James, who said of Shankly: &quot;He is a real Scotland player who will fight until he drops&quot;.

Shankly made his international debut on 9 April 1938 against England at Wembley; Scotland winning the match 1–0 with a late goal by Tommy Walker. Nine of his Scotland appearances were against England and the others were against Northern Ireland, Wales and Hungary. He was Scotland&#x27;s captain in the wartime match against England at Hampden Park, attended by 78,000 people on 3 May 1941, but Scotland lost that game 1–3. Perhaps his most memorable international was the wartime game at Wembley on 18 April 1942 when Scotland won 5–4 and Shankly scored his only Scotland goal. A post-match report said that Scotland&#x27;s success was inspired by &quot;the Busby–Shankly victory service&quot; when Shankly and his future management rival Matt Busby combined to help Scotland&#x27;s cause. According to the Liverpool website, Shankly&#x27;s goal was &quot;probably the strangest national goal ever&quot;. He took a speculative shot towards goal from 50 yards and the ball bounced over the England goalkeeper&#x27;s head and into the net. In January 1973, when Shankly was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;, the goal was shown and Shankly commented that &quot;they all count and we won&quot;.

===Style and technique===
Shankly declared in his autobiography that he specialised in what he called &quot;the art of tackling&quot;, emphasising that it is an art. He wrote that he was never sent off or booked by a referee. In his view, the art of tackling is in the timing and the sole object is to win the ball. He wrote that even if the opponent is injured in the tackle, it is not a foul if you have timed everything right and you have won the ball. His philosophy, therefore, was to play hard but fair with no cheating. During his playing career, Shankly said he would not argue with referees. He realised after taking the advice of his brothers that it is a waste of time. The referee, he wrote, always wins in the end.

Shankly was always noted for his dedication to football and, in his playing days, would do his own training during the summer months. During the summer of 1933 when he returned to Glenbuck after completing his first season as a professional, he decided to develop his throw-in skills. He was an early exponent of the long throw-in – he practised by throwing balls over a row of houses and the small boys of the village helped by fetching them back for him.

==Management career==
Shankly wrote in his autobiography that he had long prepared himself for a career as a football manager. He had absorbed all the coaching systems with any useful qualifications and had full confidence in his ability and in himself to be a leader. For him, he had done the hard work and it was simply a question of waiting for an opportunity to present itself. Shankly summed up the essential criteria for success in football management when he claimed he could speak common sense about the game and could spot a good player. In spotting a player, he always applied a basic formula which was that, first and foremost, the player must have both ability and courage. Other attributes were physical fitness and willingness to work, especially to struggle against the odds.

===Carlisle United===
Shankly began his managerial career at Carlisle United, the club where his professional playing career had started. Carlisle in the 1948–49 season were struggling in the bottom half of the Third Division North and finding it difficult to attract southern-based players because of the town&#x27;s geographic remoteness in the far north of England. Shankly&#x27;s work ethic transformed the team who finished 15th in 1948–49 after he had been in charge for only the last few matches. They improved to ninth in 1949–50 and then to third in 1950–51, almost gaining promotion.

One of Shankly&#x27;s players at Carlisle was Geoff Twentyman, then a promising young centre half, who was later transferred to Liverpool. After he retired from playing, Twentyman became chief scout at Liverpool, working with Shankly and finding several outstandingly talented players.

Shankly used psychology to motivate his players, for example telling them that the opposition had had a very tiring journey and were not fit to play the match. He urged the local population to support the team and would use the public address system at matches to tell the crowd about his team changes and how his strategy was improving the team. Shankly recalled that Brunton Park was dilapidated, writing that the main stand was falling to pieces and the terraces derelict. He even burned all the kits. When the team was travelling to Lincoln City, he saw a sportswear shop in Doncaster and stopped the coach to buy a full set of kits in which the team played at Lincoln.

Season ticket sales in 1950–51 reached an all-time high and Carlisle challenged strongly for promotion as well as achieving a draw with Arsenal at Highbury in the FA Cup. It ended badly, however, because Shankly accused the club&#x27;s board of reneging on a bonus promise for the players should the team finish in the top three of the league. He resigned and accepted an offer from Grimsby Town. Shankly&#x27;s overall record in league football at Carlisle was 42 wins and 22 defeats from 95 matches.

===Grimsby Town===
After an unsuccessful interview at Liverpool, Shankly moved to manage Grimsby Town in June 1951. He said in his autobiography that there was greater potential at Grimsby than at Carlisle. His main problems were that Grimsby had been relegated twice in recent seasons, dropping from the First to the Third Division, and some good players had been transferred before he arrived. Even so, Shankly believed he still had good players to work with and was able to buy some additional players on the transfer market for low fees.

Grimsby made a strong challenge for promotion in 1951–52 but finished second, three points behind Lincoln City (only one team was promoted from Division Three North, with one from Division Three South). Shankly insisted in his autobiography that his Grimsby team was:

Pound for pound, and class for class, the best football team I have seen in England since the war. In the league they were in, they played football nobody else could play. Everything was measured, planned and perfected and you could not wish to see more entertaining football.

Shankly&#x27;s biographer Stephen Kelly quotes the &quot;pound for pound&quot; analysis but qualifies it as another of Shankly&#x27;s slight, though well-meant, exaggerations. Kelly added that this kind of talk by Shankly could only boost morale at the club.

Shankly made great use of five-a-side football in training at Grimsby, playing these games as if they were competitive cup or league matches. The games would last an hour each time. Shankly worked on set pieces such as throw-ins and tried to devise a method of counter-attacking from corners conceded.

Grimsby&#x27;s ageing team made a bright start in 1952–53 with five straight wins but eventually slipped and finished in fifth place. In 1953–54, Shankly became disillusioned when the board could not give him money to buy new players. He was reluctant to promote some promising reserves because of loyalty to the older players (a fault that was to resurface at Liverpool years later) and he finally resigned in January 1954, citing the board&#x27;s lack of ambition as his main reason. In his autobiography, he said that he and his wife were feeling homesick in Grimsby and, when an opportunity came to manage Workington, he was attracted to the challenge partly because they would be closer to Scotland. Shankly&#x27;s record in league football at Grimsby was 62 wins and 35 defeats from 118 matches.

===Workington===
Although the Workington team was close to the bottom of the Third Division North, Shankly saw it as a challenge and attacked the job with all of his usual enthusiasm and relish. Workington rose to 18th by the end of the 1953–54 season and so did not have to apply for re-election. In 1954–55, the team finished a creditable eighth and saw a rise in attendances from 6,000 to 8,000.

Workington operated on a shoestring and Shankly had to do much of the administration work himself, including answering the telephone and dealing with the mail by using an old typewriter to answer letters. In addition, he had the risky job of going to the bank each week to collect the payroll. One of his main problems was sharing the ground with the local rugby league club and Shankly was very concerned about the damage done to the playing surface by the rugby players. The situation led to numerous arguments with the club&#x27;s board which, as Kelly records, included a majority of rugby league men whose interest in football took second place to rugby.

Shankly resigned on 15 November 1955 to take up the post of assistant manager at Huddersfield Town, working with his old friend Andy Beattie. His record in league football at Workington was 35 wins and 27 defeats from 85 matches.

===Huddersfield Town===
Shankly&#x27;s initial role at Huddersfield was as reserve team coach. He found himself in charge of several promising youngsters who soon graduated to the first team after Town were relegated to the Second Division at the end of the 1955–56 season. Beattie resigned in the next season and, on 5 November 1956, Shankly succeeded him as manager. On Christmas Eve, he gave a first team debut to 16-year-old prospect Denis Law. Another prospect in his team was left back Ray Wilson who went on to become Huddersfield&#x27;s most capped player before joining Everton. Shankly did not gain promotion at Huddersfield, the team finishing 12th in 1956–57, ninth in 1957–58 and 14th in 1958–59.

Other players in Shankly&#x27;s Huddersfield team were Ken Taylor, who was an England Test cricketer; striker Les Massie and captain Bill McGarry. On 21 December 1957, Huddersfield lost 7-6 to Charlton Athletic, who played most of the match with ten men, after Huddersfield were leading 5–1 with just 27 minutes remaining. Shankly described it as one of the most amazing games he had ever seen. On another occasion, Huddersfield beat Liverpool 5–0 with ten men and Shankly recalled the Liverpool directors leaving the ground in single file as if they were in a funeral procession.

Disillusioned by a board that wanted to sell his best players without offering money to buy replacements, Shankly felt stifled by Huddersfield&#x27;s lack of ambition and was delighted in November 1959 to receive an approach for his services by Liverpool. He recalled how Liverpool chairman Tom (T.V.) Williams asked him if he would like to manage the best club in the country, to which Shankly replied: &quot;Why, is Matt Busby packing up?&quot; Shankly decided to think about the offer as he realised the great potential at Liverpool, who like Huddersfield were in the Second Division at that time. Rumours began and were fuelled by Liverpool&#x27;s visit to Leeds Road on 28 November. Although Huddersfield won the game 1–0, Shankly accepted the Liverpool offer and resigned his position as Huddersfield manager at a board meeting on 1 December 1959. His league record at Huddersfield was 49 wins and 47 defeats in 129 matches.

===Liverpool===

====Early years (1959–1964)====
When Shankly arrived at Anfield on Monday, 14 December 1959, Liverpool had been in the Second Division for five years, and had been defeated by non-league Worcester City in the 1958–59 FA Cup. Anfield itself was in disrepair with no means of watering the pitch and Shankly insisted the club spend £3,000 to rectify that. Shankly described the training ground at Melwood as &quot;a shambles&quot;. The Liverpool squad he inherited consisted largely of average players and some promising reserves.

In spite of the difficulties, Shankly quickly felt at home in his new club and believed he shared an immediate bond with the supporters, whom he saw as his kind of people. He quickly established working relationships with the coaching staff of Bob Paisley, Joe Fagan and Reuben Bennett who shared his views about loyalty to each other and to the club. Paisley&#x27;s influence at Liverpool was crucial for, as Kelly puts it, Shankly was &quot;the great motivating force behind Liverpool, but it was Paisley who was the tactician&quot;. One aspect of the quartet&#x27;s legacy to football was the conversion of an old storage room into what became known as the &quot;Boot Room&quot;, which was used for tactical discussion while cleaning and repairing boots. Although Shankly believed he had an excellent coaching staff, the playing staff were not so impressive – indeed, Shankly said of the latter:

After only one match I knew that the team as a whole was not good enough. I made up my mind that we needed strengthening through the middle, a goalkeeper and a centre half who between them could stop goals, and somebody up front to create goals and score them.

To deal with what he saw as a below average playing squad, he placed 24 players on the transfer list. All of them had left the club within one year. Shankly resolutely pursued his strength through the middle goal and always knew which three players he needed to achieve it.
Melwood was overgrown and had only an old wooden cricket pavilion. Shankly commented that one of the pitches looked as if bombs had been dropped on it and he asked if the Germans had been over in the war. He instituted a development programme to cultivate the site and modernise the facilities. In the meantime, he arranged for the players to meet and change at Anfield before going to and from Melwood by bus. According to Kelly, Liverpool&#x27;s eventual success was based on hard work done in the training system that Shankly, Paisley, Fagan and Bennett introduced at Melwood. Shankly deplored long-distance running on roads and insisted that, apart from warm-up exercises or any special exercises needed to overcome injuries, the players trained on grass using a ball. Everything was done systematically with players rotating through exercise routines in groups with the purpose of achieving set targets. These would first cycle through athletic exercises, like skipping or squats, before moving on to football-specific functions, such as a heading the ball or chipping it. Five-a-side games, as at all Shankly&#x27;s earlier clubs, were at the heart of the system and he again insisted on these being as competitive as league matches.

One particular routine designed to develop stamina, reflexes and ball skills was the &quot;sweat box&quot; which Shankly described as: &quot;using boards like the walls of a house with players playing the ball off one wall and on to the next; the ball was played against the boards, you controlled it, turned around and took it again&quot;. Shankly got the idea from a routine he had seen Tom Finney use at Preston to hone his skills. After experimenting with the routine, he set the players a limit of two minutes per session. The system was geared to Shankly&#x27;s simple philosophy of &quot;pass and move&quot;, which formed the basis of Liverpool&#x27;s strategy. Shankly insisted on suitable cooling-off periods after training (now called &quot;warming down&quot;) before the players took a bath and had a meal. The team changed the studs in their boots to suit all playing conditions. Shankly summarised the entire strategy in terms of attention to detail with nothing left to chance.

Liverpool&#x27;s recovery depended on new players being acquired and, in his autobiography, Shankly recalled the struggles he had with the board to make them realise the club&#x27;s potential and the need to spend money on good players. He said there were times when he felt like walking out. He found a valuable ally in Eric Sawyer, of the Littlewoods pools organisation, who joined the board not long after Shankly&#x27;s appointment and shared Shankly&#x27;s vision of Liverpool as the best club in England. At one board meeting in 1961 when Shankly insisted the club make offers for two players in Scotland, the board&#x27;s initial response was that they couldn&#x27;t afford them, but Sawyer stepped in and said: &quot;We can&#x27;t afford &quot;not&quot; to buy them&quot;.

The two Scottish players were centre half Ron Yeats and centre forward Ian St John from Dundee United and Motherwell respectively. With Sawyer&#x27;s help, Shankly signed them both in the spring of 1961 and challenged the Liverpool board to sack him if they couldn&#x27;t play. At a press conference when Yeats came to Liverpool, Shankly emphasised Yeats&#x27; height by inviting the journalists to &quot;go and walk round him; he&#x27;s a colossus!&quot; Goalkeeper Tommy Lawrence came through the club&#x27;s junior teams, so Shankly now had his &quot;strength through the middle&quot; and the team building continued with the acquisition of wing half Gordon Milne from Preston. Other players developed at Anfield were Jimmy Melia, Ronnie Moran, Alan A&#x27;Court and the future England internationals Gerry Byrne and Roger Hunt. Shankly said of goalscorer Hunt the first time he saw him: &quot;Christ, this one can play!&quot; Liverpool had finished third in both 1959–60 and 1960–61 (only the top two clubs were promoted); but the new team gained promotion in the 1961–62 season by winning the Second Division championship, Hunt scoring 41 goals.

Liverpool consolidated in 1962–63, finishing eighth in their first top flight season under Shankly&#x27;s management. Significant signings were wing half Willie Stevenson from Rangers in 1962 and left winger Peter Thompson from Preston in 1963. Shankly described the Thompson deal as &quot;daylight robbery&quot;. Liverpool&#x27;s youth system produced more future England internationals in Ian Callaghan, Tommy Smith and Chris Lawler. The hard work paid off in 1963–64 when Liverpool won their sixth League Championship title, ending the season with a 5–0 defeat of Arsenal at Anfield. According to Roger Hunt, the secret of Liverpool&#x27;s success was that, under Shankly, they were the fittest team in the country. In 1964, Jimmy Melia was transferred to Wolverhampton Wanderers; with Shankly buying Arsenal&#x27;s utility player Geoff Strong for £40,000 and this was Liverpool&#x27;s last significant transfer activity until 1967.

====1964 to 1970====
One of Shankly&#x27;s greatest ambitions when he joined Liverpool was to win the FA Cup and, after he signed Yeats and St John, he told the club directors that they would win it with these two players in the team. It was St John who scored the winning goal in May 1965 when Liverpool won the FA Cup for the first time in the club&#x27;s history with a 2–1 extra time victory over Leeds United at Wembley. In his autobiography, Shankly recounted that among his many achievements, winning the 1965 FA Cup final was his greatest day in football. Ahead of the final The Beatles had sent Shankly a telegram wishing the team luck, and Shankly appeared on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; where he picked the club&#x27;s anthem &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone&quot; as his eighth and final selection.
Liverpool made their European debut in 1964–65, competing in the European Cup and reaching the semi-finals. In the second round, the club was drawn against the formidable Anderlecht. Immediately before the match, Shankly decided to experiment with the Liverpool kit. Liverpool played in red shirts with white shorts and white socks with red stripes but Shankly and Ian St John had the idea of an all-red kit that would give the impression the players were taller. Liverpool played in all-red only for European matches but quickly adopted the colour permanently.

Three days after winning the FA Cup, Liverpool defeated European champions Inter Milan 3–1 at Anfield in the semi-final first leg with a performance that was saluted by Inter&#x27;s coach Helenio Herrera. The second leg at the San Siro remains controversial because, according to Shankly, the match was &quot;a war&quot; which Liverpool lost 3–0 and so were knocked out of the competition 4–3 on aggregate. Eleven years later, Shankly maintained that two of Inter&#x27;s goals were illegal. Even today, the Liverpool website describes the match by saying that Liverpool were denied at the semi-final stage by a dishonest referee in Milan. According to Kelly, however, video evidence shows that the two disputed goals were actually legitimate. Shankly said after the defeat in Milan that the Inter fans were going mad because they were so pleased to have beaten Liverpool and he insisted it proved the high standard to which the Liverpool team had raised itself. In the 1964–65 Football League Championship, Liverpool dropped from first to seventh with 13 fewer points than the previous season, perhaps due to the exertion of lengthy participation in the FA and European Cups.

In 1965–66, Liverpool regained the League Championship title and reached the final of the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup at Hampden Park, where they lost 2–1 in extra time to Borussia Dortmund. Shankly&#x27;s summary of that final, played on a wet night, was that the team didn&#x27;t play well and gave away &quot;two silly goals&quot;. Shankly and Paisley had learned a great deal about European football which Liverpool would eventually turn into trophies. Their strategy in two-legged ties would be containment away and attack at home. Shankly had applied the principle in a preliminary round tie against Juventus when Liverpool were away in the first leg. Despite Juventus taking the lead after 81 minutes, Shankly ordered his players to ensure the deficit was only one goal. Liverpool then switched to all-out attack in the second leg at Anfield and won 2–0 (2–1 aggregate).

Liverpool began the 1966–67 season by beating neighbours Everton in the FA Charity Shield match but the team were never really in contention for major honours that season, finishing fifth in the league. Shankly recognised the potential of Blackpool teenager Emlyn Hughes, a future England captain, and signed him for £65,000 in February 1967. Liverpool&#x27;s performance in the 1966–67 European Cup was poor and, after struggling to overcome FC Petrolul Ploiești in the first round, they were well beaten in the last 16 by Ajax Amsterdam, inspired by 19-year-old Johan Cruyff. Ajax won 7–3 on aggregate after defeating Liverpool 5–1 in Amsterdam. Several years later, in his autobiography, Shankly still complained that the match in Amsterdam should never have started because of fog and, although Liverpool lost 5–1, he still thought Liverpool would win the tie at Anfield. Although Shankly claimed to have been unworried about the Ajax defeat, he acknowledged that he was examining the team and planning ahead. The Liverpool site argues that Shankly was mistaken in his decision at this time to postpone team rebuilding.

Liverpool improved their league performances over the next two years, finishing third in 1967–68 and then second in 1968–69, although to Shankly himself it was &quot;a mediocre time in the late 1960s as we prepared for the 1970s&quot;. Shankly made two controversial signings in this period which did not turn out as he had hoped. In 1967, he signed striker Tony Hateley from Chelsea for a club record £96,000 and then felt obliged to transfer him to Coventry City only a year later. He wrote that bad luck and injuries disrupted the progress of two other prospects Alf Arrowsmith and Gordon Wallace; Shankly had compared the latter to Tom Finney. In September 1968, he paid £100,000 () to Wolverhampton Wanderers for their teenage striker Alun Evans who thus became &quot;football&#x27;s first £100,000 teenager&quot;. Evans started well and produced some outstanding performances during his four years at the club but Shankly eventually had to sell him to Aston Villa. He later recalled that Evans was scarred by a glass in a nightclub incident which, in Shankly&#x27;s opinion, had a detrimental impact on his career.

The only long-term success that Shankly had in the transfer market in the late 1960s was his signing of Emlyn Hughes, who went on to captain Liverpool to victory in the European Cup. Otherwise, he did not significantly change the team until the 1969–70 season when Liverpool finished fifth in the league championship, a long way behind the winners, their local rivals Everton. Shankly was characteristically defiant whenever Everton got the better of Liverpool and, although he liked and respected everyone connected with Everton, would always talk up Liverpool at Everton&#x27;s expense. Typical of this was his joke about the city having two great football teams – Liverpool and Liverpool reserves.

In the 1969–70 FA Cup quarter final, Liverpool played against struggling Second Division side Watford at Vicarage Road and lost 1–0 after a very poor performance. The Liverpool site records that the defeat signalled the end for St John, Hunt, Byrne, Yeats and Lawrence; the incomers included Ray Clemence, Alec Lindsay, Larry Lloyd, John Toshack, Brian Hall and Steve Heighway. Apart from Hall who graduated through the reserves, they were all signed from clubs in lower divisions or even, in the case of Heighway, from non-league football. Adding the new players to Tommy Smith, Ian Callaghan, Chris Lawler and Emlyn Hughes, Shankly formed the nucleus of a second great team which went on to dominate English and European football in the 1970s.

Many of the new players came to Liverpool because of a new scouting system created by Shankly in 1967 and placed under the control of new chief scout Geoff Twentyman, who had played for Shankly at Carlisle and had then spent several seasons at Liverpool, retiring shortly before Shankly&#x27;s appointment. According to Stephen Kelly, hiring Twentyman as chief scout was &quot;perhaps Shankly&#x27;s finest signing ever&quot;. It was through Twentyman that Liverpool found the new players and, after Shankly retired, Twentyman gave sterling service to Bob Paisley and Joe Fagan by finding players including Phil Neal, Alan Hansen and Ian Rush. As always, Shankly kept things simple and Twentyman was told to look for a prospect&#x27;s basic qualities which were the abilities to pass the ball and move into position to receive a pass. Shankly also wanted Twentyman to check the player&#x27;s personality and ensure he had the right attitude for a professional footballer. Above all, said Twentyman, &quot;he wanted to know if the lad had the heart to play for Liverpool&quot;. Although Shankly sometimes paid large transfer fees he was loath to do so and Twentyman&#x27;s brief was to find young players so he (Shankly) could mould them into what he wanted.

====1970 to 1974====
The new team began promisingly in 1970–71 by retaining fifth place in the league and reaching the semi-finals of the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup where they lost 0–1 to Leeds United. The highlight of Liverpool&#x27;s European campaign that season was a 4–1 aggregate victory in the quarter-final over Bayern Munich. For the first time since winning the competition in 1965, Liverpool reached the FA Cup Final but, as in the Fairs Cup, experience was the major factor and Shankly&#x27;s young team were beaten 2–1 by league champions Arsenal despite having taken the lead in extra time through a Steve Heighway goal. Watching from the sidelines was another new player whom Shankly had recently signed from Scunthorpe United for £35,000 on Twentyman&#x27;s recommendation. This was Kevin Keegan and he was such an important addition to the new Liverpool team that Shankly devoted an entire chapter of his autobiography to him entitled &quot;A Boy Called Keegan&quot;. Shankly summarised Keegan as &quot;the inspiration of the new team&quot;.

In Keegan&#x27;s first season, 1971–72, Liverpool missed out on winning the League Championship by a single point, the title going to Brian Clough&#x27;s Derby County. Shankly maintained that Liverpool were denied a definite penalty in their crucial away match against Derby and then had a good goal disallowed towards the end of their final match against Arsenal. Both decisions cost the team a vital point which would have been enough to claim first place. Shankly took encouragement from the team&#x27;s overall form, especially as they made a strong finish to the season, and he was confident of success in 1972–73.
Shankly had always been noted for his use of psychology, both to encourage his own players and to raise doubt in the minds of opponents. One of his lasting innovations is the &quot;THIS IS ANFIELD&quot; plaque secured to the wall above the players&#x27; tunnel. Coupled with the roar of the crowd, it was designed to intimidate. Shankly stated the plaque &quot;is to remind our lads who they&#x27;re playing for, and to remind the opposition who they&#x27;re playing against&quot;. In the first match after it was erected, Liverpool defeated Newcastle United 5–0 on 18 March 1972, despite an attempt by Malcolm Macdonald to joke about the sign. Shankly would try to boost the confidence of his own players by announcing that a key opponent was unfit. When Keegan was about to play against Bobby Moore for the first time, Shankly told him that Moore had been out at a night club and was hung over. Afterwards, Keegan having produced an outstanding performance against the equally outstanding Moore, Shankly told him that Moore had been brilliant that day and Keegan would never play against anyone better.

In 1972–73, Liverpool won the club&#x27;s eighth league title and their third under Shankly. On 30 December 1972 the team beat Crystal Palace at Anfield to make it 21 consecutive home wins in the league. This was the longest run in English top-flight history until it was surpassed by Jürgen Klopp&#x27;s Liverpool who made it 22 consecutive home wins in March 2020. A massive bonus for the club was winning the 1973 UEFA Cup, the club&#x27;s first European success. In the two-legged final they faced Borussia Mönchengladbach, whom Shankly rated the best team in Europe. The first leg at Anfield had to be played twice after an abandonment due to heavy rain which flooded the pitch. Shankly had left John Toshack out of the team but then, having studied the Borussia defence, recalled him for the rematch the following night. Toshack used his height and heading ability to great effect and created two goals for Keegan as Liverpool won 3–0. The second leg in Mönchengladbach was a different story as Borussia took an early 2–0 lead and Shankly admitted he thought the final was lost, but Liverpool held on to win the final by an aggregate score of 3–2. It was the first time an English club had won both the league title and a European trophy in the same season.

Liverpool were well beaten by Red Star Belgrade in the second round of the 1973–74 European Cup and lost out to Leeds in the League Championship, finishing second. In the third round of the FA Cup, Liverpool had to score a late equaliser to draw 2–2 at home against lowly Doncaster Rovers but recovered to win the replay and then go all the way to the final. In what proved to be Shankly&#x27;s last competitive game in charge, Liverpool produced a superb second half performance to defeat Newcastle 3–0 at Wembley.

===Relationship with fans===

In his autobiography, Shankly wrote: &quot;Right from the start as a manager [i.e., when he was at Carlisle] I tried to show that the fans are the people that matter. You&#x27;ve got to know how to treat them (and) have them on your side&quot;. This was particularly true at Liverpool and Shankly said he was made for Liverpool where the people that matter most are the ones who come through the turnstiles. He added that a manager has got to identify himself with the people because their team is something that really matters to them. In return, he said, the support of the Liverpool fans for their team had been incredible.

In April 1973, when Shankly and the team were showing off the League Championship trophy to the fans on the Kop, he saw a policeman fling aside a Liverpool scarf which had been thrown in Shankly&#x27;s direction. Shankly retrieved the scarf and wore it. He said to the policeman: &quot;Don&#x27;t you do that. That&#x27;s precious&quot;. Shankly saw the offer of the scarf as a mark of respect which deserved his respect in return.

Shankly emphasised the importance of communication with the supporters. At Carlisle he used to speak to them over the public address system before matches. Rather than just putting a few lines in the match programme, he preferred to speak and explain his team changes and his views about the previous match. At Workington, he would answer supporters&#x27; letters in person, using an old typewriter. He said he preferred to phone business people as he would put as little as possible in writing when dealing with them. He would readily obtain match tickets for fans whom he considered to be deserving cases and wrote in his autobiography that he would give people anything within reason.

Shankly formed a special bond with the Liverpool supporters and, at the end of the 1961–62 season when Liverpool won the Second Division championship, he told the &quot;Liverpool Echo&quot;: &quot;In all sincerity, I can say that they are the greatest crowd of supporters in the game&quot;. In Tommy Smith&#x27;s view, Shankly was completely in tune with the city of Liverpool; he loved the supporters and they loved him, mainly because they knew he understood them.

Regarded as a great orator who stirred emotions among the fanbase, following the 1971 FA Cup Final (which Liverpool lost to Arsenal), Shankly and the players toured the city of Liverpool where people turned out to greet the gallant losers. Standing on the steps of St George&#x27;s Hall, Shankly overlooked a crowd of over 100,000 Liverpool fans, and delivered one of his most famous speeches. &quot;&#x27;Since I&#x27;ve come here to Liverpool, to Anfield, I&#x27;ve drummed it into our players, time and again, that they are privileged to play for you. And if they didn&#x27;t believe me, they believe me now.&quot; Commenting on the mood of the crowd, a moved Peter Robinson, club secretary of Liverpool, told a reporter, &quot;Bill&#x27;s got such power of oratory that if he told them to march through the Mersey tunnel and pillage Birkenhead they&#x27;d do it&quot;.

==Retirement from Liverpool==
Shankly was 60 when Liverpool won the 1974 FA Cup final and said in his autobiography that, on returning to the dressing room at the end of the match, he felt tired from all the years. His mind was made up and he knew he was going to retire. His wife, Nessie, had asked him to retire a year earlier but he decided that was not the right time. Tommy Smith said that Shankly&#x27;s feelings for Nessie were undoubtedly a major reason for his decision. In 1974, he decided that he could leave Liverpool with pride in a job well done and only one regret, which was that he did not win the European Cup.

Shankly had considered retirement in previous years. The Liverpool secretary Peter Robinson was initially blasé in 1974 but, when he realised Shankly was serious this time, tried to make him change his mind. Shankly&#x27;s granddaughter, Karen Gill, said to &quot;The Observer&quot; in 2009: &quot;I think that perhaps it was tiredness, that football had taken its toll on him&quot;. In her 2006 book about her grandfather, Karen Gill said Shankly never professed anything privately about retirement that he did not declare publicly. She did not agree that there was any hidden motive behind his decision and she thought Brian Clough&#x27;s view about tiredness was probably correct.

Shankly&#x27;s retirement was officially and surprisingly announced at a press conference called by Liverpool on 12 July 1974. Chairman, John Smith, said in his opening address:

It is with great regret that I as chairman of Liverpool Football Club have to inform you that Mr Shankly has intimated that he wishes to retire from active participation in league football. And the board has with extreme reluctance accepted his decision. I would like to at this stage place on record the board&#x27;s great appreciation of Mr Shankly&#x27;s magnificent achievements over the period of his managership.

Shankly soon regretted his decision and tried to continue his involvement with the club, mainly by turning up for team training at Melwood. He said he still wanted the involvement as the club had become his life. He soon stopped going to Melwood because he felt there was some resentment and people were asking what he was doing there. He still attended matches, but sat in the stand away from the directors and staff. He was especially annoyed that Liverpool did not invite him to attend away matches as the club&#x27;s guest. When, finally, he was invited to travel with them to the away leg of the 1976 UEFA Cup Final in Bruges, he was accommodated in a separate hotel and said he found that insulting. Shankly contrasted Liverpool&#x27;s attitude with what he encountered at other clubs, including Liverpool&#x27;s great rivals Everton and Manchester United, where he was received warmly. He recalled Manchester United manager Tommy Docherty&#x27;s comment to a Liverpool director that he (Shankly) was welcome at Old Trafford. About Everton, once his greatest rivals, he wrote that he had been received more warmly by Everton than by Liverpool. He said it was a scandal that he needed to say that about the club he had helped to build.

From Liverpool&#x27;s point of view, the situation was that Shankly had retired and the club had to move on. Shankly did not understand that, by turning up for training at Melwood, he was effectively undermining Bob Paisley&#x27;s status as manager. On one visit to Melwood, a player opined to Shankly that Paisley had made a good start in the job. Shankly retorted: &quot;I could have left a monkey in charge!&quot; Shankly&#x27;s visits even went as far as actually taking over the training. Tommy Smith recalled that Shankly as manager never ran training and would only speak to Paisley, Fagan and Bennett about what needed to be done. As a visitor at Melwood, he began to intervene and Paisley&#x27;s initial pleasure on seeing him soon turned to polite embarrassment. Eventually, Paisley had to point out to Shankly that he did not work there any more, that it was now Paisley&#x27;s team and that he had things which he wanted to do with the team.

It is believed that Shankly wanted a seat on the Liverpool board, as Matt Busby had been given by Manchester United after he retired as their manager in 1969. Again, what Shankly did not understand was that his relations with the board had often been acrimonious with several resignation threats and a statement made by Shankly that:

At a football club, there&#x27;s a holy trinity – the players, the manager and the supporters. Directors don&#x27;t come into it. They are only there to sign the cheques.

Although some club officials like secretary Peter Robinson wanted bygones to be bygones, Tommy Smith summarised the board&#x27;s view as one of satisfaction that Shankly had gone at last. There was a perception that Shankly was an overbearing figure, who could use a position on the board to be a &quot;back-seat driver&quot;, and the board were well aware that Matt Busby&#x27;s time as a Manchester United director had been disastrous. Busby&#x27;s successors had complained about being undermined by his continued presence at United, who had been relegated in 1974. While Liverpool&#x27;s treatment of Shankly may have seemed disrespectful, they were acting in the best interests of the club and its new manager by pursuing the same relentless winning ethic that Shankly himself had instilled. In any event, their perceived ruthlessness was vindicated by the unprecedented haul of League Championship titles and European Cups won over the next decade under Bob Paisley and Joe Fagan.

Soon after Shankly&#x27;s retirement, Brian Clough – who himself had recently been sacked by Leeds United – was asked during a David Frost interview whom in football management he respected, to which Clough replied: &quot;Well, the guy who had my total respect finished a few months ago at Liverpool. He&#x27;s a one off, there&#x27;ll never be another one like Shanks. Never at all. He absolutely lives the game ... he was totally honest, he believed implicitly in what he was doing, and there was never, ever a doubt when you either talked to him, met him, or anything; he was above board. He was above board. He was one off.&quot;

==Later years==

Shankly was awarded the OBE in November 1974, four months after he retired as Liverpool manager. He and Nessie went to Buckingham Palace and, according to Kelly, that was a rare day out for them. They continued to live in the semi-detached house at West Derby, near the Everton training ground at Bellefield, which they bought when they moved to Liverpool in 1959. After Shankly&#x27;s death in 1981, Nessie lived there alone until she died in August 2002.

Shankly tried to keep busy in retirement and stay in touch with football. He worked for Radio City 96.7, a Liverpool station on which he presented his own chat show, once interviewing prime minister Harold Wilson, and was a pundit on its football coverage. He briefly took up advisory roles at Wrexham and then at Tranmere Rovers, helping former Liverpool captain Ron Yeats at the latter. In November 1976, the press speculated that Shankly would make a return to management as the successor to Dave Mackay at Derby County, but the position went to Colin Murphy instead. John Toshack recalled that Shankly was a great help to him when he went into management with Swansea City in 1978. Despite being in his sixties, Shankly kept himself fit and often took part in five-a-side football. If nothing else was available he would join teams of youngsters in kickabouts.

==Death and legacy==
On the morning of 26 September 1981, Bill Shankly was admitted to Broadgreen Hospital following a heart attack. His condition appeared to be stable and there was no suggestion that his life was in danger. On the following Monday morning, his condition suddenly deteriorated and he was transferred into intensive care. At 00:30 on 29 September, he suffered another cardiac arrest and was certified dead, twenty-seven days after his 68th birthday, at 01:20. He was cremated at the Anfield Crematorium on 2 October and his ashes were scattered on the Anfield pitch at the Kop end.

On the day of Shankly&#x27;s death, training was cancelled at both Melwood and Bellefield. The Labour Party conference stood in a minute&#x27;s silence for a man who had always been a socialist. Sir Matt Busby, the former Manchester United manager, was so upset that he refused to take any telephone calls from people asking him for a reaction. Tributes poured in from the world of football, especially from the former players of all Shankly&#x27;s clubs. Liverpool chairman John Smith summed them up with a simple but fitting: &quot;In my opinion, he was the most outstanding and dynamic manager of the century&quot;. On 3 October, Liverpool&#x27;s first home league game since his passing, Anfield celebrated his life, with one fan on the Kop holding aloft a homemade banner declaring &quot;Shankly Lives Forever&quot;.

Liverpool erected the 15-foot high cast-iron Shankly Gates in front of the Anfield Road stand. Inscribed &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone&quot;, they were opened by Nessie Shankly at a low-key ceremony in August 1982. In 1997, a seven-foot tall bronze statue of Shankly was unveiled outside the stadium. It bears the legend: &quot;He made the people happy&quot;. In 2016, a plinth to Shankly was installed on 96 Avenue outside Anfield. The inscription features details of Liverpool&#x27;s 1965 win over Inter Milan at Anfield, the club&#x27;s first great European night.

From the mid-1990s, Preston North End started a complete re-building of Deepdale to convert it into a modern all-seater stadium. When the former Spion Kop end was replaced by a new stand in 1998, it was named the Bill Shankly Kop and was designed with different coloured seats providing an image of Shankly&#x27;s head and shoulders.

Shankly was made an inaugural inductee of the English Football Hall of Fame in 2002, in recognition of his impact on the English game as a manager. In 2004, he was an inaugural inductee into the Scottish Football Hall of Fame. David Peace&#x27;s biographical novel &quot;Red or Dead&quot;, published in 2013, is a fictionalised account of Shankly&#x27;s career as Liverpool manager. The novel was short-listed for the inaugural Goldsmiths Prize (2013). A hotel and museum opened in Liverpool in August 2015 dedicated to the life and career of Bill Shankly. Shankly also features in the popular Liverpool chant &quot;Allez, Allez, Allez&quot;, which is frequently sung by Liverpool supporters, especially during European matches. Archived voice overs of Shankly (&quot;My idea was to build Liverpool into a bastion of invincibility&quot;) appear on the track &quot;Anfield Rap&quot;, a Liverpool FA Cup Final song from 1988.

==Personal life==
Shankly was married to his wife Agnes Wren-Fisher from 1944 until his death 37 years later. They had met earlier during World War II, when Bill was serving as a Corporal with the RAF and &quot;Nessie&quot;, who was six years younger, was serving with the WRAF. They had two daughters – Barbara (born 1945) and Jeanette (born 1951) – and eventually went on to have six grandchildren, although their youngest grandchild and only grandson was born several months after Bill Shankly&#x27;s death. Nessie survived her husband by more than 20 years, dying in August 2002 at the age of 82. On Shankly&#x27;s appointment as Liverpool manager in 1959, he and his family moved into a house in Bellefield Avenue, West Derby, Liverpool. Nessie Shankly was still living there at the time of her death more than 40 years later.

Upon his death in 1981 Shankly left £99,077 in his will ().

==Personality==
Stephen Kelly, in his 1997 biography of Shankly, calls him &quot;the ultimate obsessive&quot;. Shankly was fanatical about Liverpool and about football in general. From coaching his players and arguing with journalists to buttonholing fans in pubs, all Shankly ever wanted to do was talk about football and to be involved in football. As a result, he had few interests outside the game other than his family. His wife Nessie told Kelly that Shankly would spend time in the garden, mowing and weeding. She could rely on him to clean the cooker when Liverpool lost. Family holidays were limited to a week in Blackpool, where they always stayed at the Norbreck Hotel. One non-football activity that Shankly did enjoy was playing cards and Ian St John said he loved it, always taking part on long coach trips to away matches.

Shankly was noted for his charismatic personality and his wit; as a result, he is oft-quoted. His most famous quotation is probably one that is often paraphrased:

Some people believe football is a matter of life and death, I am very disappointed with that attitude. I can assure you it is much, much more important than that.

Kelly wrote that, although it was said half-jokingly, so far as Shankly was concerned there was a degree of truth in what he had said. Shankly had fully realised the importance of football to its die-hard fans, himself included. It had become too important. Ian St John agreed that much of Shankly&#x27;s behaviour was &quot;bizarre&quot;, but everything was done with a purpose because Shankly always knew what he was doing and what he was saying.
On how his tough, working class upbringing kept him grounded. &quot;Pressure is working down the pit. Pressure is having no work at all. Pressure is trying to escape relegation on 50 shillings a week. Pressure is not the European Cup or the Championship or the Cup Final. That&#x27;s the reward.&quot; On his belief in hard work, he referred to his time in the RAF: &quot;If I had a job to do, even if it was scrubbing the floor, I wanted my floor to be cleaner than yours. Now if everyone thinks along these lines and does all the small jobs to the best of their ability – that&#x27;s honesty, then the world would be better and football will be better. So, what I want is hard work. And no football club is successful without hard work.&quot;

In his autobiography, Shankly gave insights into his character such as his world-view as a socialist, explaining that the socialism he believed in was not about politics but about collectivism, with everyone working for each other and enjoying a share of the rewards. That was the basis of his approach to football which is a team game in which everyone works together and shares the rewards.

While he lived most of his life in the North of England, Shankly identified as a Scot, saying &quot;If Scotland went to war tomorrow, I&#x27;ll be the first one there.&quot; He admitted to idolising Robert Burns, whose birthplace was only 26 miles from Glenbuck, and he was inspired by many of Burns&#x27; philosophical quotations, such as his egalitarian statement that &quot;A Man&#x27;s A Man for A&#x27; That&quot;. Shankly had no time for bigotry or prejudice, especially arising from differences of religion. He compared the cities of Glasgow and Liverpool by saying that there is nothing like the Rangers–Celtic situation in Liverpool because the supporters of Liverpool and Everton are a mixed bunch whose religion is football.

Shankly&#x27;s public persona was that of a &quot;tough guy&quot; with the swagger of his favourite film star James Cagney but privately he was very different. Joe Mercer described his &quot;heart of gold&quot; and likened him to a Border Collie who drives his sheep but could never hurt them. Liverpool&#x27;s perceived failings in the late 1960s have been attributed to Shankly&#x27;s reluctance to drop his long-serving players even though they were past their best. Bob Paisley said it was Shankly&#x27;s one failing and it was because he was &quot;a softie at heart&quot;.

When asked by a TV interviewer how he would like to be remembered, Shankly replied: Basically as an honest man in a game that is sometimes short on honesty. That I&#x27;ve been working honestly for the people of Liverpool to try and give them entertainment.

<doc id="318570" wikidata="Q1442295" url="?curid=318570" title="Gairloch">
<text>Gairloch ( ; , meaning &quot;Short Loch&quot;) is a village, civil parish and community on the shores of Loch Gairloch in Wester Ross, in the North-West Highlands of Scotland. A tourist destination in the summer months, Gairloch has a golf course, a museum, several hotels, a variety of shops, takeaway restaurants, a community centre, a leisure centre with sports facilities, a local radio station (Radio Wester Ross), beaches and nearby mountains. Gairloch is one of the principal villages on the North Coast 500 route.

The parish of Gairloch extends over a much wider area, including the villages of Poolewe, Kinlochewe and Aultbea, and has a population of 950. The nearest railway station is located at Achnasheen, and the nearest mainland airport is in Inverness.

==Geography==
Gairloch is a loosely defined area of settlement along the shores of Loch Gairloch but primarily comprises three main clusters of shops, houses and amenities: the Harbour area (including Charlestown on the south side of the harbour), Achtercairn and Strath. Approaching from the south (on the A832 road via Kinlochewe), the B8056 turning for Badachro, Port Henderson and other settlements on the south side of the loch leaves left from the main road over a narrow &#x27;hump-backed&#x27; bridge. Continuing north on the A832 towards the Charlestown and the harbour are the first settlements of central Gairloch to be met. About further north, Achtercairn is centred on the road junction with the B8021 coastal road that leads west along the north shore of the loch to Strath and on towards Melvaig on the west coast. The main A832 road leaves Gairloch, heading steeply up Achtercairn Brae leading out of the village to the north and on to Poolewe.

The coastal climate is affected by the Gulf Stream, bringing relatively warm waters in summer. These warm waters are ideal for jellyfish which can swarm the local waters, although most species in the UK are harmless.

Following a community campaign against proposals by Scottish Water to replace the existing treatment works at Fhasaich and discharge minimally treated sewage effluent into the loch, the main Gairloch beach () and the Sands beach were given &quot;Designated Bathing Waters&quot; status for 2017, and Scottish Water was asked to revise its plans to take account of the need to maintain higher standards of seawater cleanliness in the area. In autumn 2017 it proposed additional filtering and sterilization of the effluent, but only during the peak bathing season in the summer, with basic septic tank treatment for the rest of the year.

Beyond Gairloch to the northwest, several small settlements can be found: Big Sand, North Erradale, and Melvaig. North of Sands campsite, the road becomes single-track for to Melvaig. Beyond Melvaig the road narrows to a private stretch (which is open to the public and has right of passage for cars) and ends close to the Rua Reidh Lighthouse. There is a small local authority car park in Melvaig for five cars where people park to walk out to the Lighthouse.

==Land ownership==
The lands around Gairloch have been mostly in the ownership of the Mackenzies of Gairloch since the 15th century, when they were acquired by Hector Roy Mackenzie (died 1528), with a family house in the sheltered glen of Flowerdale. The Mackenzies were clan leaders in the traditional sense and were known for their attachment to their tenants. During the 19th century, Sir Hector Mackenzie and his sons Sir Francis and Dr John Mackenzie refused to evict a single tenant during the clearances, despite the estate running at a loss. As a result, evicted Highlanders from other communities came to live in the area which has caused Gairloch to maintain a thriving community even today. The glen has a microclimate and vegetation that are home to a diverse range of natural life. Christina Byam Shaw states in her memoir &quot;Pigeonholes of Memory&quot;, that her father was able to grow fruiting peaches outdoors. Osgood Mackenzie created the Inverewe Garden in nearby Poolewe. There is a walk up the Flowerdale burn, going past the Mackenzie house, Tigh Digh, to a waterfall at the head of the glen. With the aid of public grants, new and refurbished footpaths have been established which allow residents and visitors to access the wooded areas, however access to the popular Cherry Tree Hill walk has been obstructed by the estate in 2024. The Estate has also developed several micro hydroelectric schemes to generate additional income.

==Fishing==

Gairloch and nearby Badachro on the south side (the &quot;overside&quot;) have a history of creel shellfish fishing as well as small-scale trawl fishing. The number of active boats has been in decline, however, and Gairloch has seen both of its shellfish processing businesses fall by the wayside over the last 10 years. There are still a few fishermen who work regularly for their living, but many have moved on; some have diversified into catering for tourism and visitor activities.

Boat fishing and marine wildlife trips can be arranged at the harbour, and there are many hill lochs in the area with trout fishing available. Trips are also available with a working creel boat based in Badachro.

==Amenities and tourism==

Shops are to be found in Strath, Achtercairn and Pier Road at the harbour. Also in the harbour area, near the golf course is a branch of the Bank of Scotland which has limited opening hours. A mobile Royal Bank of Scotland also visits the area weekly. Post Offices are located in local convenience stores at the harbour and in Achtercairn. Public services such as police station, leisure centre, schools, library and health centre, as well as a small supermarket and a home and garden centre, are in the central Achtercairn area. A small water sports centre, Gairloch Kayak Centre, is based at Shieldaig Lodge Hotel.

There is a tourist information service, a 24-hour filling station (card payment out of hours), and dual electric vehicle charging points are at the Gairloch Community Hall and in the Pier Road car park.

Two campsites take tents, caravans and motorhomes – one in Strath, Gairloch Holiday Park, and one to the west of Gairloch on Little Sand Farm, Sands Caravan &amp; Camping. Carn Dearg Youth Hostel, situated on the headland shortly before Sand, has views across the bay towards Skye. Overnight stays by recreational vehicles are permitted in the Pier Road car park. A free 24-hour chemical toilet emptying point is available beside the public toilet building in the harbour.

A Pictish stone, with a distinctive carving of a salmon, was found in Gairloch in 1880. This is one of the westernmost sites where such a discovery has been made. The stone is now on display in the Gairloch Heritage Museum. From 2013 to 2017 raised funds for a major project to relocate to a new home in the former Cold War Anti-Aircraft Operations Room building in Achtercairn. The museum reopened in the new building in July 2019 with expanded exhibits as well as a gallery and shop featuring work by local artists.

The site of a 1945 plane crash at the Fairy Lochs near Gairloch is now a designated war grave. The hilltop crash site, south of the road to Badachro, has been preserved as a memorial to the USAAF servicemen who lost their lives in the accident.

There is a single public bus service to and from Inverness on Monday, Tuesday, Friday and Saturday, plus once-a-week services to Ullapool and Dingwall.

==Education==
Early years, primary, secondary and further education are provided at the education campus in the central Achtercairn area. Gairloch Primary School provides both Gaelic and English medium learning and has an approximate roll of 75. Gairloch High School is a modern six-year secondary school with an approximate roll of 160. A limited range of further education courses is provided by the West Highland College UHI, part of the University of the Highlands and Islands.

==Media==
Gairloch is home to the UK&#x27;s smallest local radio station, Radio Wester Ross.

The village was featured on the BBC One TV series &quot;When Love Comes to Town&quot; in 2007.

The area has also been featured in several older educational and promotional films and TV programmes, including the 1955 film &quot;Crofter Boy&quot;, and the 1990s documentary &quot;Last Postbus to Gairloch&quot; (Channel 4), featuring the postbus (mini-van carrying passengers &amp; mail) that was an additional link for various parts of the nearby community, before being withdrawn by Royal Mail.

The area around Gairloch is also the outdoor location of films &quot;Stardust&quot; (2007), &quot;What We Did on Our Holiday&quot; (2014) and &quot;Out of Darkness&quot; (2022).

==Notable people==
* An annual festival used to be held in Gairloch commemorating John Mackay (1656–1754) piper to the Tacksman of Clan Mackenzie of Gairloch.
* Regarding Scottish Gaelic literature, Gairloch is important as the final resting place of former Church of Scotland parish schoolmaster and bard or William Ross (1762–1791), known as &#x27;the Gairloch bard&#x27;. His 1783 poem &quot;Moladh Gheàrrloch&quot; (&quot;In Praise of Gairloch&quot;) describes the Highland winter sport of shinty played upon New Year&#x27;s Day at ebb tide upon the Big Sand. It is, according to Ronald Black, &quot;as succinct a description as we have of the great festive shinty matches of the past.&quot;
*George McIver, a writer of science fiction in Australian literature, was born at Gairloch.
* Former footballer Harold Davis lived in the village in his later life, running a hotel.

<text>Herisau is a municipality and the capital of the canton of Appenzell Ausserrhoden in Switzerland. It is the seat of the canton&#x27;s government and parliament; the judicial authorities are situated in Trogen.

The central hamlet and the houses around the central square, the Protestant church of 1580, the houses &quot;Wetter&quot; and &quot;zur Rose&quot; (both 1737), the hamlet &quot;Schwänberg&quot; and the government building with the state archive are listed as heritage sites of national significance.

Together with other Alpine towns Herisau engages in the Alpine Town of the Year Association for the implementation of the Alpine Convention to achieve sustainable development in the Alpine Arc. 
Herisau was awarded Alpine Town of the Year 2003.

==History==

Herisau was first mentioned in 837 as &quot;Herinisauva&quot;, and its church is mentioned in 907. In 1084 Herisau was destroyed as part of battles around the monastery in St. Gallen. In 1248 and 1249 the town was destroyed again, this time by the monastery to establish loyalty. In 1401 Herisau joined an alliance with other places in Appenzell as part of the Appenzell Wars.

Between 1517 and 1518 Herisau managed to buy itself free from the monastery. The town hall was built in 1601. In 1606 the town was largely destroyed by a fire. In 1648 Schwellbrunn separated and became an independent village. Between 1798 and 1803 Herisau was the capital of the canton &quot;Säntis&quot;.

==Geography==

<text>Benjamin Lauder Nicholson, OM (10 April 1894 – 6 February 1982) was an English painter of abstract compositions (sometimes in low relief), landscapes, and still-life. He was one of the leading promoters of abstract art in England.

==Background and training==
Nicholson was born on 10 April 1894 in Denham, Buckinghamshire, the son of the painters Sir William Nicholson and Mabel Pryde, and brother of the artist Nancy Nicholson, the architect Christopher Nicholson and Anthony Nicholson. His maternal grandmother Barbara Pryde (née Lauder) was a niece of the famous artist brothers Robert Scott Lauder and James Eckford Lauder. The family moved to London in 1896. Nicholson was educated at Tyttenhangar Lodge Preparatory School, Seaford, at Heddon Court, Hampstead and then as a boarder at Gresham&#x27;s School, Holt, Norfolk. He trained as an artist in London at the Slade School of Fine Art between 1910 and 1911, where he was a contemporary of Paul Nash, Stanley Spencer, Mark Gertler, and Edward Wadsworth. According to Nash, with whom he formed a close friendship, Nicholson spent more time during his year at the Slade playing billiards than painting or drawing, since the abstract formality of the green baize and the constantly changing relationships of the balls were, he later claimed, of more appeal to his aesthetic sense.

Nicholson was married three times. His first marriage was to the painter Winifred Roberts; it took place on 5 November 1920 at St Martin-in-the-Fields Church, London. Nicholson and Winifred had three children: a son, Jake, in June 1927; a daughter, Kate (who later also became a painter), in July 1929; and a son, Andrew, in September 1931. They were divorced in 1938. His second marriage was to fellow artist Barbara Hepworth on 17 November 1938 at Hampstead Register Office. Nicholson and Hepworth had triplets, two daughters, Sarah and Rachel, and a son, Simon, in 1934. They were divorced in 1951. The third and final marriage was to Felicitas Vogler, a German photographer. They married in July 1957 and divorced in 1977.

==Life and works==

Nicholson&#x27;s first notable work was following a meeting with the playwright J. M. Barrie on holiday in Rustington, Sussex, in 1904. As a result of this meeting, Barrie used a drawing by Nicholson as the base for a poster for the play &quot;Peter Pan&quot;; his father William designed some of the sets and costumes.

Nicholson was exempted from World War I military service due to asthma. He travelled to New York in 1917 for an operation on his tonsils, then visited other American cities, returning to Britain in 1918. Before he returned, Nicholson&#x27;s mother died in July of influenza and his brother Anthony Nicholson was killed in action.

From 1920 to 1933, he was married to the painter Winifred Nicholson and lived in London. After Nicholson&#x27;s first exhibition of figurative works in London in 1922, his work began to be influenced by Synthetic Cubism, and later by the primitive style of Rousseau. In 1926, he became chair of the Seven and Five Society.

In London, Nicholson met the sculptors Barbara Hepworth (to whom he was married from 1938 to 1951) and Henry Moore. On visits to Paris, he met Mondrian, whose work in the neoplastic style was to influence him in an abstract direction, and Picasso, whose cubism would also find its way into his work. His gift, however, was the ability to incorporate these European trends into a new style that was recognizably his own. He first visited St Ives, Cornwall, in 1928 with his fellow painter Christopher Wood, where he met the fisherman and painter, Alfred Wallis. In Paris in 1933, he made his first wood relief, &quot;White Relief&quot;, which contained only right angles and circles. In 1937, he was one of the editors of &quot;&quot;, an influential monograph on constructivism. He believed that abstract art should be enjoyed by the general public, as shown by the Nicholson Wall, a mural he created for the garden of Sutton Place in Guildford, Surrey. Nicholson moved to St Ives in 1939 living at Trezion, Salubrious Place, for 19 years. In 1943, he joined the St Ives Society of Artists. In 1951 he and Barbara Hepworth divorced.

He won the prestigious Carnegie Prize in 1952 and in 1955 a retrospective exhibition of his work was shown at the Tate Gallery in London. In 1956, he won the first Guggenheim International painting prize and in 1957 the international prize for painting at the Sao Paulo Art Biennial.

Nicholson married the photographer Felicitas Vogler in 1957 and moved to Castagnola, Switzerland, in 1958. In 1968, he received the British Order of Merit (OM). In 1971, he separated from Vogler and moved to Cambridge. In 1977, they divorced.

Nicholson&#x27;s last home was in Pilgrim&#x27;s Lane, Hampstead. He died there on 6 February 1982 and was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium on 12 February 1982.

==Art market==
The highest price reached by one of his paintings in the art market was when &quot;April 57 (Arbia 2)&quot; (1957) sold for £3,749,000 (c. $4,659,407) at Christie&#x27;s London, on 23 November 2016.

==Public collections==
Some of Nicholson&#x27;s works can be seen at the Tate Gallery, Tate St Ives, Kettle&#x27;s Yard Art Gallery in Cambridge, The Hepworth Wakefield, Pallant House Gallery in Chichester and the Pier Arts Centre in Stromness, Orkney.

<text>The Cavendish experiment, performed in 1797–1798 by English scientist Henry Cavendish, was the first experiment to measure the force of gravity between masses in the laboratory and the first to yield accurate values for the gravitational constant. Because of the unit conventions then in use, the gravitational constant does not appear explicitly in Cavendish&#x27;s work. Instead, the result was originally expressed as the relative density of Earth, or equivalently the mass of Earth. His experiment gave the first accurate values for these geophysical constants.

The experiment was devised sometime before 1783 by geologist John Michell, who constructed a torsion balance apparatus for it. However, Michell died in 1793 without completing the work. After his death the apparatus passed to Francis John Hyde Wollaston and then to Cavendish, who rebuilt it, but kept close to Michell&#x27;s original plan. Cavendish then carried out a series of measurements with the equipment and reported his results in the &quot;Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society&quot; in 1798.

==The experiment==
The apparatus consisted of a torsion balance made of a wooden rod horizontally suspended from a wire, with two , lead spheres, one attached to each end. Two massive , lead balls, suspended separately, could be positioned away from or to either side of the smaller balls, away. The experiment measured the faint gravitational attraction between the small and large balls, which deflected the torsion balance rod by about 0.16&quot; (or only 0.03&quot; with a stiffer suspending wire).

The two large balls could be positioned either away from or to either side of the torsion balance rod. Their mutual attraction to the small balls caused the arm to rotate, twisting the suspension wire. The arm rotated until it reached an angle where the twisting force of the wire balanced the combined gravitational force of attraction between the large and small lead spheres. By measuring the angle of the rod and knowing the twisting force (torque) of the wire for a given angle, Cavendish was able to determine the force between the pairs of masses. Since the gravitational force of the Earth on the small ball could be measured directly by weighing it, the ratio of the two forces allowed the relative density of the Earth to be calculated, using Newton&#x27;s law of gravitation.

Cavendish found that the Earth&#x27;s density was times that of water (although due to a simple arithmetic error, found in 1821 by Francis Baily, the erroneous value appears in his paper). The current accepted value is 5.514 g/cm3.

To find the wire&#x27;s torsion coefficient, the torque exerted by the wire for a given angle of twist, Cavendish timed the natural oscillation period of the balance rod as it rotated slowly clockwise and counterclockwise against the twisting of the wire. For the first 3 experiments the period was about 15 minutes and for the next 14 experiments the period was half of that, about 7.5 minutes. The period changed because after the third experiment Cavendish put in a stiffer wire. The torsion coefficient could be calculated from this and the mass and dimensions of the balance. Actually, the rod was never at rest; Cavendish had to measure the deflection angle of the rod while it was oscillating.

Cavendish&#x27;s equipment was remarkably sensitive for its time. The force involved in twisting the torsion balance was very small, , (the weight of only 0.0177 milligrams) or about of the weight of the small balls. To prevent air currents and temperature changes from interfering with the measurements, Cavendish placed the entire apparatus in a mahogany box about 1.98 meters wide, 1.27 meters tall, and 14 cm thick, all in a closed shed on his estate. Through two holes in the walls of the shed, Cavendish used telescopes to observe the movement of the torsion balance&#x27;s horizontal rod. The key observable was of course the deflection of the torsion balance rod, which Cavendish measured to be about 0.16&quot; (or only 0.03&quot; for the stiffer wire used mostly). Cavendish was able to measure this small deflection to an accuracy of better than using vernier scales on the ends of the rod.
The accuracy of Cavendish&#x27;s result was not exceeded until C. V. Boys&#x27; experiment in 1895. In time, Michell&#x27;s torsion balance became the dominant technique for measuring the gravitational constant (&quot;G&quot;) and most contemporary measurements still use variations of it.

Cavendish&#x27;s result provided additional evidence for a planetary core made of metal, an idea first proposed by Charles Hutton based on his analysis of the 1774 Schiehallion experiment. Cavendish&#x27;s result of 5.4 g·cm−3, 23% bigger than Hutton&#x27;s, is close to 80% of the density of liquid iron, and 80% higher than the density of the Earth&#x27;s outer crust, suggesting the existence of a dense iron core.

==Reformulation of Cavendish&#x27;s result to &quot;G&quot; ==
The formulation of Newtonian gravity in terms of a gravitational constant did not become standard until long after Cavendish&#x27;s time. Indeed, one of the first references to &quot;G&quot; is in 1873, 75 years after Cavendish&#x27;s work.

Cavendish expressed his result in terms of the density of the Earth. He referred to his experiment in correspondence as &#x27;weighing the world&#x27;. Later authors reformulated his results in modern terms.
:formula_1
After converting to SI units, Cavendish&#x27;s value for the Earth&#x27;s density, 5.448 g cm−3, gives
:&quot;G&quot; = ,
which differs by only 1% from the 2014 CODATA value of .
Today, physicists often use units where the gravitational constant takes a different form. The Gaussian gravitational constant used in space dynamics is a defined constant and the Cavendish experiment can be considered as a measurement of this constant.
In Cavendish&#x27;s time, physicists used the same units for mass and weight, in effect taking &quot;g&quot; as a standard acceleration. Then, since &quot;R&quot; was known, &quot;ρ&quot; played the role of an inverse gravitational constant. The density of the Earth was hence a much sought-after quantity at the time, and there had been earlier attempts to measure it, such as the Schiehallion experiment in 1774.

==Derivation of &quot;G&quot; and the Earth&#x27;s mass==
The following is not the method Cavendish used, but describes how modern physicists would calculate the results from his experiment. From Hooke&#x27;s law, the torque on the torsion wire is proportional to the deflection angle formula_2 of the balance. The torque is formula_3 where formula_4 is the torsion coefficient of the wire. However, a torque in the opposite direction is also generated by the gravitational pull of the masses. It can be written as a product of the attractive force of a large ball on a small ball and the distance L/2 to the suspension wire. Since there are two balls, each experiencing force &quot;F&quot; at a distance from the axis of the balance, the torque due to gravitational force is &quot;LF&quot;. At equilibrium (when the balance has been stabilized at an angle formula_2), the total amount of torque must be zero as these two sources of torque balance out. Thus, we can equate their magnitudes given by the formulas above, which gives the following:

:formula_6

For &quot;F&quot;, Newton&#x27;s law of universal gravitation is used to express the attractive force between a large and small ball:

:formula_7

Substituting &quot;F&quot; into the first equation above gives

:formula_8

To find the torsion coefficient (formula_4) of the wire, Cavendish measured the natural resonant oscillation period &quot;T&quot; of the torsion balance:

:formula_10

Assuming the mass of the torsion beam itself is negligible, the moment of inertia of the balance is just due to the small balls. Treating them as point masses, each at L/2 from the axis, gives:

:formula_11,

and so:

:formula_12

Solving this for formula_4, substituting into (1), and rearranging for &quot;G&quot;, the result is:

:formula_14.

Once &quot;G&quot; has been found, the attraction of an object at the Earth&#x27;s surface to the Earth itself can be used to calculate the Earth&#x27;s mass and density:

:formula_15

:formula_16

:formula_17

<doc id="318580" wikidata="Q131389" url="?curid=318580" title="International Date Line">
<text>The International Date Line (IDL) is the line extending between the South and North Poles that is the boundary between one calendar day and the next. It passes through the Pacific Ocean, roughly following the 180.0° line of longitude and deviating to pass around some territories and island groups. Crossing the date line eastbound decreases the date by one day, while crossing the date line westbound increases the date.

The line is a cartographic convention and is not defined by international law. This has made it difficult for cartographers to agree on its precise course and has allowed countries through whose waters it passes to move it at times for their convenience.

==Geography==

===Circumnavigating the globe===

People traveling westward around the world must set their clocks: 
*Back by one hour for every 15° of longitude crossed, and 
*Forward by 24 hours upon crossing the International Date Line.

People traveling eastward must set their clocks: 
*Forward by one hour for every 15° of longitude crossed, and 
*Back by 24 hours upon crossing the International Date Line.

Moving forward or back 24 hours generally also implies a one day date change.

The 14th century Arab geographer Abulfeda predicted that circumnavigators would accumulate a one-day offset to the local date. This phenomenon was confirmed in 1522 at the end of the Magellan–Elcano expedition, the first successful circumnavigation. After sailing westward around the world from Spain, the expedition called at Cape Verde for provisions on Wednesday, 9 July 1522 (ship&#x27;s time). However, the locals told them that it was actually Thursday, 10 July 1522. The crew was surprised, as they had recorded each day of the three-year journey without omission. Cardinal Gasparo Contarini, the Venetian ambassador to Spain, was the first European to give a correct explanation of the discrepancy.

===Description===

:&quot;This description is based on the most common understanding of the &quot;de facto&quot; International Date Line. See below, and map above at right.&quot;
The IDL is roughly based on the meridian of 180° longitude, roughly down the middle of the Pacific Ocean, and halfway around the world from the IERS Reference Meridian, the successor to the historic Greenwich prime meridian running through the Royal Greenwich Observatory. In many places, the IDL follows the 180° meridian exactly. In other places, however, the IDL deviates east or west away from that meridian. These various deviations generally accommodate the political and/or economic affiliations of the affected areas.

Proceeding from north to south, the first deviation of the IDL from 180° is to pass to the east of Wrangel Island and the Chukchi Peninsula, the easternmost part of Russian Siberia. (Wrangel Island lies directly on the meridian at 71°32′N 180°0′E, also noted as 71°32′N 180°0′W.) It then passes through the Bering Strait between the Diomede Islands at a distance of from each island at 168°58′37″ W. It then bends considerably west of 180°, passing west of St. Lawrence Island and St. Matthew Island.

The IDL crosses between the U.S. Aleutian Islands (Attu Island being the westernmost) and the Commander Islands, which belong to Russia. It then bends southeast again to return to 180°. Thus, all of Russia is to the west of the IDL, and all of the United States is to the east except for the insular areas of Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and Wake Island, reaching the hypothetical, but not used UTC–13:00 time zone.

The IDL remains on the 180° meridian until passing the equator. Two U.S.-owned uninhabited atolls, Howland Island and Baker Island, just north of the equator in the central Pacific Ocean (and ships at sea between 172.5°W and 180°), have the &quot;earliest&quot; time on Earth (UTC−12:00 hours).

The IDL circumscribes Kiribati by swinging far to the east, almost reaching the 150°W meridian. Kiribati&#x27;s easternmost islands, the southern Line Islands south of Hawaii, have the &quot;latest&quot; time on Earth (UTC+14:00 hours).

South of Kiribati, the IDL returns westwards but remains east of 180°, passing between Samoa and American Samoa. Accordingly, Samoa, Tokelau, Wallis and Futuna, Fiji, Tonga, Tuvalu, and New Zealand&#x27;s Kermadec Islands and Chatham Islands are all west of the IDL and have the same date. American Samoa, the Cook Islands, Niue, and French Polynesia are east of the IDL and one day behind.

The IDL then bends southwest to return to 180°. It follows that meridian until reaching Antarctica, which has multiple time zones. Conventionally, the IDL is not drawn into Antarctica on most maps. (See below.)

===Facts dependent on the IDL===

According to the clock, the first areas to experience a new day and a New Year are islands that use UTC+14:00. These include portions of the Republic of Kiribati, including Millennium Island and Kiritimati in the Line Islands. The first major cities to experience a new day are Auckland and Wellington, New Zealand (UTC+12:00 or UTC+13:00 during daylight saving time).

A 1994 realignment of the IDL made Caroline Island one of the first points of land on Earth to reach January 1, 2000, on the calendar (UTC+14:00). As a result, this atoll was renamed Millennium Island.

Every day for 2 hours from 10:00 to 12:00 UTC there are 3 different days on earth. Example: On Tuesday 10:33 UTC it is Monday 22:33 on Baker Island(US), 23:33 on Midway(US), Pago Pago(American Samoa) and Alofi(Niue), Tuesday almost everywhere else on earth and Wednesday 00:33 in Kiritimati(Kiribati) in the Line Islands. Then 1 hour 11 minutes later at 11:44 UTC it is Monday 23:44 on Baker Island, Tuesday almost everywhere else on earth, Wednesday 01:44 in Kiritimati and 00:44 in Canton Island(Kiribati) in the Phoenix Islands, Apia(Samoa), Atafu(Tokelau) and Nukuʻalofa(Tonga) (also in Auckland during summer when NZDT is observed). Chatham Islands(NZ) are also nominally 2 days ahead of Baker Island for 45 minutes in the winter(CHAST) and 1 hour 45 minutes in the summer(CHADT).

The areas that are the first to see the daylight of a new day vary by the season. Around the June solstice, the first area would be any place within the Kamchatka Time Zone (UTC+12:00) that is far enough north to experience midnight sun on the given date. At the equinoxes, the first place to see daylight would be the uninhabited Millennium Island in Kiribati, which is the easternmost land located west of the IDL.

Near the December solstice, the first places would be Antarctic research stations using New Zealand Time (UTC+13:00) during summer that experience midnight sun. These include Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station, McMurdo Station, Scott Base and Zucchelli Station.

== De facto and de jure date lines ==

There are two ways time zones and thereby the location of the International Date Line are determined, one on land and adjacent territorial waters, and the other on open seas.

All nations unilaterally determine their standard time zones, applicable only on land and adjacent territorial waters. This date line can be called &quot;de facto&quot; since it is not based on international law, but on national laws. These national zones do not extend into international waters.

The nautical date line, not the same as the IDL, is a &quot;de jure&quot; construction determined by international agreement. It is the result of the 1917 Anglo-French Conference on Time-keeping at Sea, which recommended that all ships, both military and civilian, adopt hourly standard time zones on the high seas. The United States adopted its recommendation for U.S. military and merchant marine ships in 1920. This date line is implied but not explicitly drawn on time zone maps. It follows the 180° meridian except where it is interrupted by territorial waters adjacent to land, forming gaps—it is a pole-to-pole dashed line. The 15° gore that is offset from UTC by 12 hours is bisected by the nautical date line into two 7.5° gores that differ from UTC by ±12 hours.

In theory, ships are supposed to adopt the standard time of a country if they are within its territorial waters within of land, then revert to international time zones (15° wide pole-to-pole gores) as soon as they leave. In practice, ships use these time zones only for radio communication and similar purposes. For internal (within-ship) purposes, such as work and meal hours, ships use a time zone of their own choosing.

===Cartographic practice and convention===
The IDL on the map in this article and all other maps is based on the &quot;de facto&quot; line and is an artificial construct of cartographers, as the precise course of the line in international waters is arbitrary. The IDL does not extend into Antarctica on the world time zone maps by the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) or the United Kingdom&#x27;s His Majesty&#x27;s Nautical Almanac Office (HMNAO). The IDL on modern CIA maps now reflects the most recent shifts in the IDL (see below). The current HMNAO map does not draw the IDL in conformity with recent shifts in the IDL; it draws a line virtually identical to that adopted by the UK&#x27;s Hydrographic Office about 1900. Instead, HMNAO labels island groups with their time zones, which do reflect the most recent IDL shifts. This approach is consistent with the principle of national and nautical time zones: the islands of eastern Kiribati are actually &quot;islands&quot; of Asian date (west side of IDL) in a sea of American date (east side of IDL). Similarly, the western Aleutian Islands are islands of American date in a sea of Asian date.

No international organization, nor any treaty between nations, has fixed the IDL drawn by cartographers: the 1884 International Meridian Conference explicitly refused to propose or agree to any time zones, stating that they were outside its purview. The conference resolved that the Universal Day, midnight-to-midnight Greenwich Mean Time (now redefined and updated as Coordinated Universal Time, or UTC), which it did agree to, &quot;shall not interfere with the use of local or standard time where desirable&quot;. From this comes the utility and importance of UTC or &quot;Z&quot; (&quot;Zulu&quot;) time: it permits a single universal reference for time that is valid for all points on the globe at the same moment.

==Historic alterations==

===Philippines (1521 and 1844)===

Ferdinand Magellan claimed the Philippines for Spain on Saturday, , having sailed westwards from Seville across the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. As part of New Spain, the Philippines had its most important communication with Acapulco in Mexico, so it was on the eastern side of the IDL despite being on the western edge of the Pacific Ocean. As a result, the Philippines was one day behind its Asian neighbours for 323 years, 9 months and 4 days from Saturday, 16 March 1521 &quot;(Julian Calendar)&quot; until Monday, 30 December 1844 &quot;(Gregorian Calendar)&quot;.

After Mexico gained its independence from Spain on 27 September 1821, Philippine trade interests turned to Imperial China, the Dutch East Indies and adjacent areas, so the Philippines decided to join its Asian neighbours on the west side of the IDL. To advance the calendar by one day, on 16 August 1844 the then governor-general Narciso Claveria, ordered that Tuesday, should be removed from the calendar. Monday, was followed immediately by Wednesday, . The change also applied to the other remaining Spanish colonies in the Pacific: the Caroline Islands, Guam, Mariana Islands, Marshall Islands and Palau as part of the Captaincy General of the Philippines. European publications were generally unaware of this change until the early 1890s, so they erroneously gave the International Date Line a large western bulge for the next half century.

===Tahiti &amp; French Polynesia (early 1797 and late 1846)===
On 5 March 1797, missionaries of the London Missionary Society arrived on Tahiti from England. They had first tried to pass Cape Horn, but failing that, went along Cape of Good Hope and the Indian Ocean instead. As such, they introduced the date of the eastern hemisphere on the island. It was not until the ending of the Franco-Tahitian War and the restoration of the French Protectorate over the Tahitian Kingdom (which Tahitian nationalists had tried to fight off for two years of intense war with more than 1000 deaths) that the French commissioner Armand Joseph Bruat and the regent of the Tahitian Kingdom Paraita ordered that Tahiti had to follow the western hemisphere on 29 December 1846.
===Pitcairn Islands (1814)===

===Alaska (1867)===

Alaska was on the western side of the International Date Line, since Russian settlers reached Alaska from Siberia. In addition, the Russian Empire was still using the Julian calendar, which had fallen 12 days behind the Gregorian calendar. In 1867, the United States purchased Russian America and moved the territory to the east side of the International Date Line. The transfer ceremony took place at 3:30p.m. local mean time (00:31 GMT) in the capital of New Archangel (Sitka), on Saturday, (Julian), which was Saturday, (Gregorian) in Europe. Since Alaska moved to the eastern side of the International Date Line, the date and time also moved back to 3:30p.m. local time Friday, (00:31 GMT Saturday), now known as Alaska Day.

===Samoan Islands and Tokelau (1892 and 2011)===

The Samoan Islands, now divided into Samoa and American Samoa, were on the west side of the IDL until 1892. In that year, King Mālietoa Laupepa was persuaded by American traders to adopt the American date (three hours behind California) to replace the former Asian date (four hours ahead of Japan). The change was made by repeating , American Independence Day.

In 2011, Samoa shifted back to the west side of the IDL by removing Friday, from its calendar. This changed the time zone from UTC−11:00 to UTC+13:00 (UTC-10 to UTC+14 Dst ). Samoa made the change because Australia and New Zealand have become its biggest trading partners, and also have large communities of expatriates. Being 21 hours behind made business difficult because having weekends on backward days meant only four days of the week were shared workdays.

The IDL now passes between Samoa and American Samoa, which remains on the east (American) side of the line.

Tokelau is a territory of New Zealand north of Samoa whose principal transportation and communications links with the rest of the world pass through Samoa. For that reason, Tokelau crossed the IDL along with Samoa in 2011, albeit strictly speaking 1 hour later, as they did not do Summer Time (Daylight Saving Time in American English), which Samoa did then.

===Cook Islands and Niue (1899)===

===Kwajalein (c. 1945 and 1993)===
Kwajalein atoll, like the rest of the Marshall Islands, passed from Spanish to German to Japanese control during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. During that period it was west of the IDL. Although Kwajalein formally became part of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands with the rest of the Marshalls after World War II, the United States established a military installation there. Because of that, Kwajalein used the Hawaiian date, so was effectively east of the International Date Line (unlike the rest of the Marshalls). Kwajalein returned to the west side of the IDL by removing Saturday, from its calendar. Moreover, Kwajalein&#x27;s work week was changed to Tuesday through Saturday to match the Hawaiian work week of Monday through Friday on the other side of the IDL.

===Eastern Kiribati (1994)===

As a British colony, the Kiribati colony was centered in the Gilbert Islands, just west of the IDL of the time. Upon independence in 1979, it acquired the claim to the Phoenix and Line Islands, east of the IDL, from the United States. As a result, the country straddled the IDL. Government and commercial concerns on opposite sides of the line could only conduct routine business by radio or telephone on the four days of the week which were weekdays on both sides. To eliminate this anomaly, Kiribati introduced a change of date for its eastern half by removing Saturday, from its calendar. Because of this, Friday, 30 December 1994, was followed by Sunday, 1 January 1995. After the change, the IDL in effect moved eastwards to go around the entire country. Strictly legal, the 1917 nautical IDL convention is still valid. For example, when it is Monday on Kiribati&#x27;s islands, it is still Sunday in the surrounding ocean, though maps are usually not drawn this way.

As a consequence of the 1994 change, Kiribati&#x27;s easternmost territory, the Line Islands, including the inhabited island of Kiritimati (Christmas Island), started the year 2000 before any other country, a feature upon which the Kiribati government capitalized as a potential tourist draw.

==Date lines according to religious principles==

===Christianity===
Generally, the Christian calendar and Christian churches recognize the IDL. Christmas for example, is celebrated on 25 December (according to either the Gregorian or the Julian calendar, depending upon which of the two is used by the particular church) as that date falls in countries located on either side of the IDL. Thus, whether it is Western Christmas or Orthodox Christmas, Christians in Samoa, immediately west of the IDL, will celebrate the holiday a day before Christians in &quot;American&quot; Samoa, which is immediately &quot;east&quot; of the IDL.

A problem with the general rule above arises in certain Christian churches that solemnly observe a Sabbath day as a particular day of the week, when those churches are located in countries near the IDL. Notwithstanding the difference in dates, the same sunrise happened over American Samoa as happens over Samoa a few minutes later, and the same sunset happens over Samoa as happened over American Samoa a few minutes earlier. In other words, the secular days are &quot;legally&quot; different but they are &quot;physically&quot; the same; that causes questions to arise under religious law. Because the IDL is an arbitrary imposition, the question can arise as to which Saturday on either side of the IDL (or, more fundamentally, on either side of 180 degrees longitude) is the &quot;real&quot; Saturday. This issue (which also arises in Judaism) is a particular problem for Seventh Day Adventists, Seventh Day Baptists, and similar churches located in countries near the IDL.

In Tonga, Seventh Day Adventists (who usually observe Saturday, the seventh-day Sabbath) observe Sunday because Tonga lies east of the 180° meridian. Sunday as observed in Tonga (west of the IDL, as with Kiribati, Samoa, and parts of Fiji and Tuvalu) is considered by the Seventh-day Adventist Church to be the same day as Saturday observed east of the IDL.

Most Seventh Day Adventists in Samoa planned to observe Sabbath on Sunday after Samoa&#x27;s crossing the IDL in December 2011, but SDA groups in Samatau village and other places (approximately 300 members) decided to accept the IDL adjustment and observe the Sabbath on Saturday. Debate continues within the Seventh-day Adventist community in the Pacific as to which day is really the seventh-day Sabbath.

The Samoan Independent Seventh-day Adventist Church, which is not affiliated to the worldwide Seventh-day Adventist Church, has decided to continue worshiping on Saturday, after a six-day week at the end of 2011.

===Islam===
The Islamic calendar and Muslim communities recognize the convention of the IDL. In particular, the day for holding the &quot;Jumu&#x27;ah&quot; prayer appears to be local Friday everywhere in the world. The IDL is not a factor in the start and end of Islamic lunar months. These depend solely on sighting the new crescent moon. As an example, the fasts of the month of Ramadan begin the morning after the crescent is sighted. That this day may vary in different parts of the world is well known in Islam. (See .)

===Judaism===

The concept of an International Date Line in Jewish law is first mentioned by 12th-century decisors. But it was not until the introduction of improved transportation and communications systems in the 20th century that the question of an International Date Line truly became a question of practical Jewish law.

As a practical matter, the conventional International Date Line—or another line in the Pacific Ocean close to it—serves as a &quot;de facto&quot; date line for purposes of Jewish law, at least in existing Jewish communities. For example, residents of the Jewish communities of Japan, New Zealand, Hawaii, and French Polynesia all observe Shabbat on local Saturday. However, there is not unanimity as to how Jewish law reaches that conclusion. For this reason, some authorities rule that certain aspects of Sabbath observance are required on Sunday (in Japan and New Zealand) or Friday (in Hawaii and French Polynesia) in addition to Saturday. Additionally, there are differences of opinion as to which day or days individual Jews traveling in the Pacific region away from established Jewish communities should observe Shabbat.

For individuals crossing the IDL, the change of calendar date influences some aspects of practice under Jewish law. Yet other aspects depend on an individual&#x27;s experience of sunsets and sunrises to count days, notwithstanding the calendar date.

==Cultural references and traditions==
===&quot;The Island of the Day Before&quot;===
The IDL is a central factor in Umberto Eco&#x27;s book &quot;The Island of the Day Before&quot; (1994), in which the protagonist finds himself on a becalmed ship, with an island close at hand on the other side of the IDL. Unable to swim, the protagonist indulges in increasingly imaginative speculation regarding the physical, metaphysical and religious importance of the IDL.

===&quot;Around the World in Eighty Days&quot;===
The concept behind the IDL (though not the IDL itself, which did not yet exist) appears as a plot device in Jules Verne&#x27;s book &quot;Around the World in Eighty Days&quot; (1873). The main protagonist, Phileas Fogg, travels eastward around the world. He had bet with his friends that he could do it in 80 days. To win the wager, Fogg must return by 8:45 p.m. on Saturday, 21 December 1872. However, the journey suffers a series of delays and when Fogg reaches London, he believes it is 8:50 p.m. on Saturday, 21 December and that he has lost the wager by a margin of only five minutes. The next day, however, it is revealed that the day is Saturday, not Sunday, and Fogg arrives at his club just in time to win the bet. Verne explains:
In journeying eastward he had gone towards the sun, and the days therefore diminished for him as many times four minutes as he crossed degrees in this direction. There are three hundred and sixty degrees on the circumference of the earth; and these three hundred and sixty degrees, multiplied by four minutes, gives precisely twenty-four hours — that is, the day unconsciously gained. In other words, while Phileas Fogg, going eastward, saw the sun pass the meridian eighty times, his friends in London only saw it pass the meridian seventy-nine times.

Fogg had thought it was one day later than it actually was, because he had not accounted for this fact. During his journey, he had added a full day to his clock, at the rhythm of an hour per fifteen degrees, or four minutes per degree, as Verne writes. At the time, the concept of a &quot;de jure&quot; International Date Line did not exist. If it did, he would have been made aware that it would be a day less than it used to be once he reached this line. Thus, the day he would add to his clock throughout his journey would be thoroughly removed upon crossing this imaginary line. But a &quot;de facto&quot; date line did exist since the U.K., India, and the U.S. had the same calendar with different local times, and he should have noticed when he arrived in the U.S. that the local date was not the same as in his diary (his servant Jean Passepartout kept his watch set to London time, despite the clues from his surroundings).

===Line-crossing ceremonies relating to the IDL===

Ceremonies aboard ships to mark a sailor&#x27;s or passenger&#x27;s first crossing of the Equator, as well as crossing the International Date Line, have been long-held traditions in navies and in other maritime services around the world.

<text>Mya Marie Harrison (; born October 10, 1979), known professionally as Mýa, is an American singer, songwriter, dancer, record producer, and actress. Classified as a &quot;triple threat entertainer,&quot; she was born in Washington D.C. and studied ballet, jazz, and tap dance as a child. Her career began in television as a dance posse member, performing on BET&#x27;s &quot;Teen Summit&quot;. She signed with record executive A. Haqq Islam&#x27;s University Records, an imprint of Interscope Records to release her first album &quot;Mya&quot; (1998), which lyrically explored romance and coming-of-age scenarios. Met with critical and commercial success, the album was led by her first single, &quot;It&#x27;s All About Me&quot; (featuring Sisqo), which peaked within the top ten of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Her collaborative singles — &quot;Girls Dem Sugar&quot; (with Beenie Man), &quot;Ghetto Supastar (That Is What You Are)&quot; (with Pras and Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard), and &quot;Take Me There&quot; (with Blackstreet and Mase) — were also met with commercial success.

Her second studio album, &quot;Fear of Flying&quot; (2000) was met with further commercial success and presented a more mature sound and image. It peaked at number 15 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, received platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and was supported by the singles &quot;The Best of Me&quot; (featuring Jadakiss), &quot;Case of the Ex,&quot; and &quot;Free.&quot; The following year, Mya released the single &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; with singers Christina Aguilera, Pink and rapper Lil&#x27; Kim for the 2001 musical film &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot;. A cover of the namesake recording by funk rock band Labelle, it peaked atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and 12 international charts, and won Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals at the 44th Annual Grammy Awards. Taking a more active role in the production of her forthcoming releases, Mya was granted wider creative control of her third studio album, &quot;Moodring&quot; (2003). The album spawned two charting singles – &quot;My Love Is Like...Wo&quot; and &quot;Fallen&quot; — and received gold certification by the RIAA.

Following a departure from Interscope in favor of Universal Motown Records, her fourth studio album, &quot;Liberation&quot; (2007) was met with critical and commercial failure. Amid the leak of the album in Japan, she parted ways with the label following its release. In 2008, under the mentorship of J. Prince, Mya established her own label, Planet 9. Her fifth and sixth studio albums, &quot;Sugar &amp; Spice&quot; (2008) and &quot;K.I.S.S. (Keep It Sexy &amp; Simple)&quot; (2011) catered to the Japanese market as her most pop- and club-oriented releases. Beginning in 2014, she released a trio of R&amp;B–rooted extended plays (EPs) independently: &quot;With Love&quot; (2014), &quot;Sweet XVI&quot; (2014), and &quot;Love Elevation Suite&quot; (2015). In 2016, her seventh album, &quot;Smoove Jones&quot; received a nomination for Best R&amp;B Album at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards. Its follow-up, &quot;T.K.O. (The Knock Out)&quot; (2018), commemorated the twentieth anniversary of her debut album.

Aside from music, Mya ventured into acting across film, television, broadway, and gaming. She made her cinematic feature film debut in crime thriller &quot;In Too Deep&quot; (1999). Following her debut, she has appeared in minor or supporting roles in films and television series such as &quot;Chicago&quot; (2002), &quot;Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights&quot; (2004), &quot;Shall We Dance?&quot; (2004), &quot;1-800-Missing&quot; (2004), &quot;NCIS&quot; (2005), &quot;Cursed&quot; (2005), &quot;Girls Cruise&quot; (2019), and &quot;House Party&quot; (2023). In 2009, Mya competed in &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; season nine; finishing second place in the competition. Mya has sold 3.2 million albums in the U.S. and 20 million records worldwide. Her accolades include a Grammy Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award, a Critics&#x27; Choice Movie Award and two MTV Video Music Awards. &quot;Billboard&quot; listed her in the Hot 100 Artists of the 2000s listicle.

==Early life==
Mya Harrison, a native of Washington, D.C., is the eldest of three children. Her father Sherman &quot;Hajji&quot; Harrison is a singer and performs in an R&amp;B band, Jump Street and her mother Theresa worked as an accountant. She grew up in Prince George&#x27;s County with her two younger brothers Chaz and Nijel. In her youthful years, Mya dealt with bullying growing up as a biracial young person with a Black father and a white mother.

At the age of two, her father stood her in the Reflecting Pool between the Washington Monument and Lincoln Memorial, where she danced. She started ballet classes shortly afterward in 1982, followed by tap and jazz, but lost interest when she was eight. At 12, she found herself watching videos of her dancing and her interest in dance was rekindled.

Mya studied tapes of Tony Award winner Savion Glover, the tap dance prodigy now best known for the Broadway hit Bring in da Noise, Bring in da Funk, until she learned his routines and then joined the group T.W.A. (Tappers With Attitude). She was solo before heading to New York to study with Glover in a residency with the famed Dance Theater of Harlem. Soon after, she earned a reputation for improvisation and an impressed Glover gave her a solo spot during a Kennedy Center performance.

Mya subsequently appeared on BET&#x27;s &quot;Teen Summit&quot; and began to teach dance to children when she was 14. She also had taken violin lessons since the fourth grade. Her strict upbringing emphasized the value of school and working hard to get good grades. When her father first heard her sing, he had her record demo tapes and took them to a club where he was playing. There he met A. Haqq Islam, President and CEO of University Music. Islam listened to the tapes and agreed to come to Mya&#x27;s home, where she sang him two En Vogue songs. Impressed with her audition, Islam signed her to deal via his label and negotiated a distribution deal through Interscope Records.

After graduating from Eleanor Roosevelt High School in Greenbelt, Maryland at 16, she enrolled in the University of Maryland in speech communications. Mya left college after one semester to focus on preparing her debut album.

==Career==
===1996–1999: Debut with &quot;Mya&quot;===
After signing with major label Interscope Records, Mya spent the next two years recording her debut studio album. Using his connections, Islam was able to hire an elite team of collaborators to work with her, including Missy Elliott, Babyface, Diane Warren, Dru Hill, Darryl Pearson and Silkk Tha Shocker, while the staff at Interscope had envisioned to market Mya as their main female R&amp;B artist, competing with fellow teen singers Aaliyah, Brandy and Monica. Released in April 1998 to generally favorable reviews, &quot;Mya&quot; peaked at number 29 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and sold 1.4 million copies domestically. It received a platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), denoting shipments to US retailers of over 1,000,000 units. In total, the album sold two million copies worldwide. &quot;Mya&quot; yielded three successful singles, including her debut single, &quot;It&#x27;s All About Me&quot; featuring fellow R&amp;B singer Sisqó, which became a top-ten hit on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, as well as &quot;Movin&#x27; On&quot; and &quot;My First Night with You&quot;.

The album earned her several accolades, which included two Soul Train Music Award nominations for Best R&amp;B/Soul or Rap New Artist and Best R&amp;B/Soul Album – Female and an NAACP Image Award nomination for Outstanding New Artist. In addition to her solo work, Mya, along with Blackstreet, Blinky Blink, and Mase, was featured on &quot;Take Me There&quot; from the soundtrack of the Nickelodeon animated feature film &quot;The Rugrats Movie&quot; (1998). It reached number one in the New Zealand Singles Chart and became a top twenty hit in several nations, including the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Netherlands, and United States. Mya also appeared with rapper Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard on Pras&#x27; single &quot;Ghetto Supastar&quot;, recorded for his debut solo studio album, &quot;Ghetto Supastar&quot; (1998). A worldwide number-one hit, the song topped the charts in more than a dozen nations and earned Mya her first Grammy Award nomination in the Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group category. &quot;Ghetto Supastar&quot; was also featured on the soundtrack for the political satire film &quot;Bulworth&quot;. In 1999, Mya made her acting debut in the crime thriller film &quot;In Too Deep&quot;, directed by Michael Rymer. In the film, she played a young woman named Loretta starring opposite LL Cool J and Omar Epps. &quot;In Too Deep&quot; received generally mixed reviews, but managed to recoup its budget.

===2000–2002: &quot;Fear of Flying&quot; and &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot;===
Additionally in late 1999, Mya began production on an album that would eventually become &quot;Fear of Flying&quot;, which involved a variety of producers, including Rodney Jerkins, Swizz Beatz, Jimmy Jam &amp; Terry Lewis, and Wyclef Jean. The title was partially inspired by Erica Jong&#x27;s same-titled 1973 novel, which shared a lot of similarities toward female sexuality and development of second-wave feminism. Mya, who did some writing on her debut album, was heavily involved in the production of &quot;Fear of Flying&quot;, from writing and recording to producing, mixing, and mastering. Released in April 2000 to mixed reviews, &quot;Fear of Flying&quot; debuted at number 15 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with first week sales of 72,000 copies. Upon initial release, its first single &quot;The Best of Me&quot; featuring Jadakiss had underperformed on the charts and suffered from the dreaded sophomore slump. The album&#x27;s second single, the confrontational &quot;Case of the Ex&quot;, proved to be a different matter. &quot;Case of the Ex&quot; became Mya&#x27;s international breakthrough hit, topping the Australian Singles Chart for two consecutive weeks,
while reaching number two and three in the US and the United Kingdom, respectively, and in turn, solidified &quot;Fear of Flying&quot; as a hit.

With the success of &quot;Case of the Ex&quot;, Interscope re-released &quot;Fear of Flying&quot; in November 2000, with a revised track listing featuring two new songs, including the third single &quot;Free&quot;. &quot;Fear of Flying&quot; earned Mya a Soul Train Music Award nomination for R&amp;B/Soul Album – Female and a MOBO nomination for Best Album. A multiplatinum success, the album sold 1.2 million copies in the United States and eventually received a platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America. Subsequently, it earned gold certifications from Canadian Recording Industry Association and Australian Recording Industry Association.

In spring of 2001, Mya paid tribute to Janet Jackson at &quot;MTV Icon&quot;. She performed her own rendition of Jackson&#x27;s classic hit &quot;The Pleasure Principle&quot;. By mid 2001, she had already amassed an impressive nine Top 10 hits and sold more than six million albums worldwide. The same year, she was featured on the &quot;Atlantis: The Lost Empire&quot; soundtrack, performing the Diane Warren-penned pop ballad &quot;Where the Dream Takes You&quot;. The song was featured during the closing credits of the animated feature. Her next music project, Mya collaborated with singers Christina Aguilera, Lil&#x27; Kim, and Pink on the remake of Labelle&#x27;s 1975 hit &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot;, which served as the first single from the &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; soundtrack. A worldwide success, it reached number one in over fifteen countries, including the United States, where it spent five consecutive weeks at the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. At 2001 MTV Video Music Awards, &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; was nominated for six awards and won two for Best Video from a Film and Video of the Year. In 2002, the quartet performed &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; at the 44th Grammy Awards and won a Grammy for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals.

After the release and success of &quot;Fear of Flying&quot; and &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot;, Mya began to dabble into acting with a small supporting role in the musical film, &quot;Chicago&quot; (2002), based on the stage-musical of the same name. Directed by Rob Marshall, it grossed more than $306.8 million worldwide and was critically lauded, winning Mya several awards in the ensemble categories, including the Critics&#x27; Choice Movie Award and the Screen Actors Guild Award. In March 2003, Mya appeared on hip hop alternative group Jurassic 5&#x27;s remix version of the song &quot;Thin Line&quot;. Chosen as their second single and more R&amp;B driven, &quot;Thin Line&quot; addressed the tension that often exists in platonic male-female relationships.

===2003–2007: &quot;Moodring&quot; and &quot;Liberation&quot;===
 In July 2003, Interscope released Mya&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;Moodring&quot;. It sold more than 113,000 copies in its first week and peaked at number three on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, surpassing Mya&#x27;s previous effort first-week sales. The album displayed an array of different emotions exploring Mya&#x27;s playful and sexual side. The bulk of &quot;Moodring&quot; was co-written and co-produced by Mya and influenced by different subjects and music stylings including pop rock, soul, hip hop, R&amp;B, and quiet storm. The first single, the Missy Elliott-produced &quot;My Love Is Like ... Wo&quot; became a top twenty hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, while its accompanying music video showcased a more sexy and risqué side of the singer. The second single, mid tempo track &quot;Fallen&quot;, failed to duplicate the same success, but reached the top forty on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. &quot;Moodring&quot; stayed on the United States chart for eighteen non-consecutive weeks and went on to be certified gold, selling 589,000 copies to date.

In 2004, she had two small roles in the dance musical &quot;Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights&quot; and romantic comedy-drama film &quot;Shall We Dance?&quot;. In the films, she played a Latina lounge singer named Lola Martinez and the fiancée of a ballroom dancing student. While &quot;Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights&quot;, a re-imagining of the 1987 blockbuster &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot;, tanked at the box office, &quot;Shall We Dance?&quot;, a remake of the 1996 Japanese film of the same name, became a box office hit, grossing $170,128,460 worldwide. Subsequently, the same year, Mya began working on her fourth studio album. Originally conceived as a project called &quot;Control Freak&quot;, the album&#x27;s first version was actually scheduled for a mid-2005 release, but was eventually shelved when Mya decided to leave her management and A&amp;M Records in fall 2005. In 2005, she had a supporting role in Wes Craven&#x27;s horror film &quot;Cursed&quot;, starring Christina Ricci and Joshua Jackson. In the film, Mya played a young victim by the name of Jenny Tate. Although &quot;Cursed&quot; tanked at the box office, it earned her a nomination in the Best Frightened Performance category at the 2005 MTV Movie Awards. Mya guest starred in season two of &quot;NCIS&quot;. Also in 2005, Mya featured on rapper Cuban Link&#x27;s single &quot;Sugar Daddy&quot; from his album Chain Reaction. An official video was filmed in New York City and debuted on 106 &amp; Park.

In 2006, she co-starred in the romantic comedy drama &quot;The Heart Specialist&quot;, written, produced and directed by Dennis Cooper, and starred Wood Harris, Zoe Saldana, and Brian J. White. Originally released under the title &quot;Ways of the Flesh&quot;, it initially premiered at the 2006 Boston Film Festival however had remain unreleased until 2011, when it was granted a limited theatrical release. The same year, she signed a recording contract with Universal Motown and resumed work on her next album, which she completed within a three-month period. Classified as &quot;energetic [and] ghetto&quot; with a less classic R&amp;B edge, Mya renamed the project &quot;Liberation&quot;. In March 2007, the album&#x27;s lead single &quot;Lock U Down&quot;, a collaboration with Lil Wayne, was sent to radio. After its commercial failure, a second single entitled &quot;Ridin&#x27;&quot; was released, but it also underperformed. Due to budget cuts, the album suffered numerous pushbacks and in mid–2007, it accidentally leaked in Japan, prompting Universal Motown to release &quot;Liberation&quot; as a digital download only in October 2007. Next up in 2007, Mya co-starred in the independent romantic comedy film &quot;The Metrosexual&quot;, starring Shaun Benson in the title role. Screened at the Boston Film Festival, the movie received mixed reviews.

=== 2008–2013: &quot;Sugar &amp; Spice&quot;, &quot;Beauty &amp; the Streets&quot; and &quot;K.I.S.S. (Keep It Sexy &amp; Simple)&quot; ===
In 2008, Mya co-starred in the Bill Duke-directed drama thriller film &quot;Cover&quot; in which she portrayed an AIDS victim named Cynda. The film dealt with the subject of men who are on the down-low in society and opened at selective theaters and grossed $79,436 in the United States. Her next film, the direct-to-dvd romantic comedy film &quot;Love For Sale&quot;. Starring opposite Jackie Long and Jason Weaver, Mya played a college student named Kiely in a bad relationship. Following her departure from Universal Motown, Mya continued working on new material under her own independent imprint Planet 9 and contracted with Japanese R&amp;B label Manhattan Records, a division of Lexington Group, to release new material. Her fifth studio album and first project for the label, &quot;Sugar &amp; Spice&quot;, received a Japan-wide release in December 2008. Specifically recorded for the Asian music market, it was preceded by the single &quot;Paradise&quot; and spawned a reissue edition, released in 2009.

In 2009, Mya had a supporting role in the comedy drama indie film &quot;Bottleworld&quot;. It featured an ensemble cast of Anna Camp, Christopher Denham and Scott Wilson. Looking to release more new music, Mya signed a deal with Young Empire Music Group, and released her first mixtape called &quot;Beauty &amp; The Streets Vol.1&quot;. It debuted and peaked at number 55 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s US Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums. In fall 2009, Mya appeared as a contestant on season nine of the ABC reality show &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, partnered with professional dancer Dmitry Chaplin. One of the show&#x27;s frontrunners throughout the entire competition, she danced on a sprained ankle for the last five weeks and ultimately placed second behind singer Donny Osmond. In 2010, Mya was invited to be a featured guest vocalist on the number-one hit remake &quot;We Are the World 25 for Haiti&quot;. She appeared in &quot;The Penthouse&quot;, starring Rider Strong. The sex comedy earned largely negative reviews.

In early 2011, she appeared on French DJ and record producer Cedric Gervais&#x27;s single &quot;Love Is the Answer&quot;. Following the collaboration with Cedric Gervais, Mya released the solo single &quot;Fabulous Life&quot;, which served as the first single from the Japanese version of her sixth studio album titled &quot;K.I.S.S. (Keep It Sexy &amp; Simple)&quot;, released in April 2011 in Japan. Production on the project was primarily handled by Cleveland native producer Young Yonny with additional contributions from Japanese musicians Jeff Miyahara and Daisuke Imai, Chuck Harmony and longtime collaborators Carvin &amp; Ivan. As with &quot;Sugar &amp; Spice&quot;, Mya took full creative control of the album and lent a hand in the songwriting process, co-writing and executive producing. The album debuted at number 72 on the Oricon Albums Chart. A US version of &quot;K.I.S.S. (Keep It Sexy &amp; Simple)&quot;, featuring several new recordings, was released in December 2011 via iTunes, with up-tempo track &quot;Earthquake&quot; featuring Trina serving as the album&#x27;s lead single. It debuted and peaked at number 74 on the US Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums.

===2014–2018: &quot;Smoove Jones&quot; and &quot;T.K.O. (The Knock Out)&quot;===
Starting in 2014, Mya released a series of EPs on her independent label Planet 9. &quot;With Love&quot;, a four-track Valentine&#x27;s Day EP, was released in February 2014 to commemorate the release of her debut single &quot;It&#x27;s All About Me&quot; and sixteenth anniversary in the entertainment industry. It received largely positive review from music critics. In April 2014, Mya starred opposite Linda Hamilton in the Syfy original TV movie &quot;Bermuda Tentacles&quot;, which garnered negative reviews. The same month, her second EP &quot;Sweet XVI&quot; was released to commemorate the release of her debut studio album &quot;Mya&quot;. It was followed by her second Valentine&#x27;s Day EP, &quot;Love Elevation Suite&quot;, released in 2015.

Mya&#x27;s seventh studio album &quot;Smoove Jones&quot; was released on February 14, 2016. It was preceded by the singles &quot;Welcome to My World&quot; and &quot;Team You&quot;. &quot;Smoove Jones&quot; debuted at number 30 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart on March 5, 2016. A critical success, it received a Grammy Award nomination for Best R&amp;B Album at the 59th ceremony. In early September 2017, Mya announced the upcoming release of a new single entitled &quot;Ready for Whatever&quot;, but gave no date for the release. &quot;Ready for Whatever&quot; was released September 22, 2017, as the first single from her forthcoming studio project. Less than two months later, Mya released a remix titled, &quot;Ready, Part II&quot; on November 25, 2017. On February 14, 2018, Mya released &quot;You Got Me&quot; as her second single from her forthcoming studio album &quot;TKO (The Knock Out)&quot; to commemorate the twentieth anniversary of her debut single &quot;It&#x27;s All About Me&quot;.

==Artistry==
===Voice and songwriting===

Mya possesses a mezzo-soprano vocal range that spans four octaves with particularly the tonality and timbre of her voice being highlighted and described as &quot;very special&quot;. Writing for &quot;Slate&quot;, Sasha Frere-Jones acknowledged although Mya&#x27;s breathy voice suggests smallness, she easily accommodates with up-to-date melisma, unadorned legato, and quiet crooning. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic commented that Mya has a voice that is at once sounding &quot;innocent and knowing&quot;, while consistently &quot;upbeat and confident&quot;. Similarly, &quot;Billboard&quot; complimented her voice for having a &quot;smooth, sensitive, angelic tone&quot; to it who oozes with the confidence and stylistic flair of an artist twice her age.

Other music critics have referred to her voice as &quot;weak&quot; and &quot;thin&quot;. In reviewing for her second studio album &quot;Fear of Flying&quot;, Jon Azpiri of AllMusic commented that &quot;she is a promising young talent, but still has yet to develop the chops necessary to rank among the best of R&amp;B divas.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote, &quot;The signature quiver in Mya&#x27;s voice does give her some sonic identity, but otherwise this could be the music of Destiny&#x27;s Child, Aaliyah or any of the countless interchangeable hip-hop/R&amp;B divas.&quot;

In an interview with &quot;Yahoo! Music&quot; conducted in 2003, the singer defended her voice and commented, &quot;It&#x27;s not necessary to sing LOUD every song; I think people associate singing loud with being able to truly sing, and I don&#x27;t think that is true.&quot; She further mentions her Coca-Cola appearance and remarked, &quot;I think that when people heard me sing the Coca-Cola commercial they were like, &quot;Oh, I didn&#x27;t know she could sing!&quot; But that was just singing loud. So there are a lot of misconceptions just about singing, period.&quot; The singer concluded her notion with the statement, &quot;I&#x27;m just happy to be here. I like to sing loud, I like to sing soft, I just like to feel good, period. It&#x27;s not that serious.&quot;

Since the beginning of her career, Mya has always been artistically involved in her career. She writes the majority of her own material for her studio albums. In an interview, she explained she writes 99.9% of her albums, and when songs are submitted to her, if she feels the song is something that feels like something she can perform well and hits close to home, then she feels comfortable doing it. Her lyrics usually fall somewhere between hopeful and melancholy. The singer is also known for writing sexually-driven lyrics and female empowerment compositions with a bit of an edge to them through her love for free-spirited word play. Her music typically &quot;bridge the gap between&quot; pop/R&amp;B and &quot;street-level&quot; hip-hop. According to writer Cynthia Fuchs from &quot;PopMatters&quot; it&#x27;s difficult to categorize Mya, because she has a &quot;tendency to blend music genres&quot;. Her third album &quot;Moodring&quot;, consisted of various genres including, R&amp;B, hip hop, Techno, pop and reggae.

In an interview with &quot;People&quot;, she revealed she draws her musical inspirations from humming a melody off the note of a whirring fan or tapping her foot to the rhythm of the bathtub dripping; commenting she can hear melodies from natural sounds like birds chirping or the taxis and construction in Manhattan. Occasionally, Mya wishes she could stop the music. &quot;In the middle of a conversation, I&#x27;ll start humming or moving my feet, and my friends will say, &#x27;You can&#x27;t be serious, she notes. &quot;It&#x27;s such a reflex that I&#x27;m totally unaware I look like an idiot.&quot; Most of her songs are helmed from personal experiences in her life as well as friends&#x27; experiences.

Mya has co-produced most of her records since 2000. She has her own recording studio and label imprint, Planet 9 and is heavily involved in the production of her music and every single process, from writing and recording to producing, mixing, and mastering her own projects. Mya is very active in all aspects of her career from the actual production to the business; formulating the beat, creating the concept, and coming up with the melodies.

===Stage===
Mya has received praise for her stage presence and live performances. Author Stacy-Deanne opined that Mya had developed into a well rounded-performer with flexible abilities who was consistently a &quot;source of attraction&quot; on television and on tour. Staff writer Trish Davis of &quot;Hartford Courant&quot; described her presence as &quot;compelling&quot; while noting, &quot;With a voice that sends high notes with clarity and low ones with force, Mya&#x27;s live act is solid.&quot; Music writer Charles Passey commended the singer&#x27;s performance at SunFest and expressed approval of her artistry to &quot;offer a musical menu both bouncy and unpretentious&quot; and felt &quot;unlike a lot of female pop stars these days, she&#x27;s got a voice to go along with her moves.&quot; Journalist Jami Gordillo-Kerby of &quot;The Fresno Bee&quot; revered the singer&#x27;s concert at The Big Fresno Fair. She took noticed of how &quot;the singer kept the upper hand,&quot; commenting &quot;She was cool, confident and totally in control.&quot; On top of that, she applauded the singer&#x27;s prowess as a performer to continuously to &quot;engaged with her fans during her entire performance&quot; and was in awe by how &quot;the attention stayed on the confident diva who prowled the stage like she owned it,&quot; sharing — &quot;She lit up the place with her exuberance and singing and dancing skills.&quot; She concluded her review on this sentiment, &quot;Mya proved repeatedly in her Fresno concert that she has the voice to be a major force in R&amp;B for years to come.&quot; Reviewing for &quot;The Press of Atlantic City&quot;, staff writer Vincent Jackson was most impressed by &quot;how well the singer sings live&quot; and &quot;better than some of her entertainment contemporaries.&quot; He concluded his review commenting, &quot;She&#x27;s clearly an entertainer whose star is on the rise.&quot; &quot;The AU Review&quot;″s Chris Singh lauded her showmanship, which he recognized has not &quot;aged&quot; nor her &quot;dulcet notes&quot; that stole the show, citing Mya as &quot;versatile&quot; and a &quot;tough act to follow&quot;. Similarly, Kelefa Sanneh of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised her live performance, noting her dance movements in particular, which he described as &quot;sprightly&quot;, &quot;sexy&quot; and &quot;theatrical&quot;. Natasha Pinto of &quot;The Music&quot; commented, &quot;She possesses the dreamiest falsetto and commands attention with every note and step she takes&quot;, acknowledging Mya&#x27;s ability to perform with &quot;absolute ease&quot; and &quot;sultry sass&quot; who does not &quot;miss a beat&quot;. Senior music writer George Palathingal for &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; noted, &quot;whether performing slick routines alongside two booty-shaking dancers or accompanied only by an acoustic guitarist, Mya is all class.&quot; Sheldon Ang of &quot;Sheldon Ang Media&quot; commented, &quot;Mya&#x27;s live act is compelling, with a dose of sexiness, bounce and elasticity – ultimately oozing a sultry zest – yet, classy with the respectable &quot;je ne sais quoi&quot; that only a few could pull off.&quot;

===Influences===
Mya&#x27;s musical influences include Sade, Janet Jackson, Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder, Aretha Franklin, Prince, Chaka Khan, Minnie Riperton, and Madonna. Mya praises Stevie Wonder for his ability to hear music and play music and feel it and get other people to feel it, and Madonna for her boldness and courage. Mya calls Minnie Riperton her favorite female singer and Prince her musical hero, stating, &quot;He&#x27;s someone who takes risks. He&#x27;s an all-around entertainer, hell of a performer. He&#x27;s a genius.&quot;

Mya&#x27;s dance influences include Gregory Hines, Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson, Savion Glover, Jimmy Slyde, Electric Boogaloos, Rock Steady Crew, Cyd Charisse, Gene Kelly, Fred Astaire and Sammy Davis Jr.

She cites Lena Horne and Liza Minnelli as her role models.

===Alter ego===
Introduced to audiences through her song, &quot;Worth It&quot;, Mya credits notorious mob accountant Meyer Lansky for American Mafia, as inspiration for her new handle. The singer ties her low-key nature to his laid-back image and her independent artist status to his birthdate on the United States&#x27; Independence Day.

For Lan$ky&#x27;s blunt cadence, Mya cites conscious and classic hip-hop trailblazers such as Mos Def, Common, Digable Planets, Black Thought, André 3000, and Erykah Badu.

However, all influences aside, Lan$ky is an integral part of Mya, relying on her specifically during hard times. &quot;When I need a picker-upper, or somebody to be that mentor, someone to be that fighter, or somebody to be that person that will crack the whip and get me in shape, that&#x27;s who Mýa Lan$ky is.&quot;

While adding, &quot;The one that doesn&#x27;t let me slip up. The one that&#x27;s hard on me when I&#x27;m too vulnerable or hearing those voices, those outside forces. I get her together.&quot;

==Other ventures==
In 2008, Mya founded her own independent record label and company Planet 9. Following the mishap of events for her last major studio album, she parted ways with the major label system. At the advice and guidance of her mentor J. Prince, the singer established and developed her own independent label with a new business approach in mind to create and release music.

<doc id="318587" wikidata="Q2262336" url="?curid=318587" title="45 Grave">
<text>45 Grave is an American rock band from Los Angeles formed in 1979. The original group broke up in 1985, but vocalist Dinah Cancer subsequently revived the band.

== History ==
The band was founded during the punk rock movement by Paul B. Cutler in Los Angeles, California, alongside another band with almost the same lineup called Vox Pop, which produced two singles. 45 Grave&#x27;s original lineup consisted of Cancer (formerly of Castration Squad) on vocals, Cutler (formerly of the Consumers) on guitar, Rob Graves (also known as Rob Ritter, formerly of the Exterminators, the Bags and the Gun Club) on bass, and Don Bolles (of the Exterminators, the Germs and Nervous Gender) on drums. The name, according to Bolles, derived from a mysterious button Cutler found at a thrift store and gave to Bolles for Christmas that said &quot;WE DIG 45 GRAVE&quot;. Bolles stated that this needed to be the name of the band, and everyone agreed.

In 1980, 45 Grave recorded their first released song, &quot;Riboflavin&quot;, included on the Los Angeles Free Music Society compilation album &quot;Darker Skratcher&quot;. The song was a cover version of the novelty song &quot;Riboflavin-Flavored, Non-Carbonated, Polyunsaturated Blood&quot; originally performed by Don Hinson &amp; the Rigamorticians on their 1964 album release &quot;Monster Dance Party&quot;. The 45 Grave recording (as with the original, produced by Gary S. Paxton of Skip &amp; Flip) achieved cult status and became a signature song of the band&#x27;s live sets.

Early on, the band began by playing the Consumers songs that Cutler had written, with lyrics changed to fit Cancer&#x27;s singing style, before concentrating on composing new material like &quot;Black Cross&quot; (issued as a single in 1981, featuring Pat Smear of the Germs on guitar on the B-side &quot;Wax&quot;) and a fast-paced punk song called &quot;Partytime&quot; (which was later slowed down and reworked on their 1983 debut album and sole studio release, &quot;Sleep in Safety&quot;). Another signature 45 Grave track, &quot;Evil&quot;, was featured on MTV, and band members appeared as extras in Ridley Scott&#x27;s &quot;Blade Runner&quot;.

Despite never achieving major success, 45 Grave were recognized as being one of the first American gothic bands, predating the formation of Christian Death. The Grammy Museum in Los Angeles listed 45 Grave and Christian Death as &quot;early proponents of American Gothic Rock&quot;.

=== &quot;Return of the Living Dead&quot; ===

In 1985, a new, heavier version of &quot;Partytime&quot; was featured on the soundtrack to the film &quot;Return of the Living Dead&quot; along with tracks by bands such as T.S.O.L. and the Cramps.

The band reformed in 1988 for a brief tour, which was recorded and released as &quot;Only the Good Die Young&quot;. However, when Graves died in 1990 from an accidental drug overdose, the band broke up once again.

=== Reformation ===
In 2004, 45 Grave reformed to commemorate their 25th anniversary, with Cancer as the sole remaining member from previous incarnations. The lineup included bassist Lisa Pifer (of Snap-Her), guitarist Jamie Pina, drummer Mike &quot;Thrashhead&quot; Sullivan, and former Adolescents and Christian Death guitarist Rikk Agnew. Cancer posted on her MySpace blog, &quot;I&#x27;m building this to keep the spirit of 45 Grave alive, introduce its magic to new fans, and as a personal commemorative of my best memories being the driving force and front person of 45 Grave. This is a part of my life that indeed changed me forever&quot;.

By 2006, Agnew and Pina had been replaced by guitarists L. Ron Jeremy and Kenton Holmes, who remained with the band until 2010. Stevyn Grey replaced Sullivan on drums in 2007, and was in turn replaced by Tom Coyne in 2008. Brandden Blackwell replaced Pifer on bass in 2009.

In 2018 Blackwell moved to Las Vegas and was eventually replaced on bass by multi-instrumentalist and music historian Daniel Munoz in 2022.

&quot;Night of the Demons&quot;, a 2009 remake of the classic 1987 cult horror film, featured 45 Grave&#x27;s title track. In 2010, Rikk&#x27;s brother Frank Agnew (T.S.O.L., Social Distortion, the Adolescents) joined the band on guitar, replacing Jeremy. Mark Bolton joined on second guitar in 2011.

&quot;Pick Your Poison&quot;, 45 Grave&#x27;s first new album in 27 years, was released in 2012 on Frontier Records. The album contained a mix of new songs, unrecorded old songs and a remake of &quot;Night of the Demons&quot;, for which a video was produced.

Former Dickies guitarist Dylan Thomas joined in 2014, replacing Bolton.

In May of 2022, 45 Grave performed over two days at the Cruel World festival at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California. Also on the bill were Bauhaus, Devo, Blondie and Morrissey.

== Musical style ==
45 Grave&#x27;s musical style was rooted in punk rock with a darker edge/horror movie aesthetic, representative of the deathrock and horror punk genres. Compared to most punk bands of the era, 45 Grave songs included more stop-start mid-song tempo changes, instrumentals and aggressive musicianship accentuated by Cutler&#x27;s virtuoso guitar playing. Keyboards added to the spooky atmosphere of many songs and harkened back to proto-punk garage bands of the early 1960s. The band&#x27;s output also had elements of surf rock, manifested in the instrumental &quot;Surf Bat&quot; from &quot;Sleep in Safety&quot;. The band&#x27;s appearance drew from horror films to create a camp gothic aesthetic. However, the band&#x27;s lyrical themes often adopted a tongue-in-cheek manner instead.

<text>A gravel pit is an open-pit mine for the extraction of gravel.

Gravel pits often lie in river valleys where the water table is high, so they may naturally fill with water to form ponds or lakes. Gravel pit lakes are typically nutrient rich and can support thriving ecosystems, but can also present environmental issues such as the release of toxic metals into watersheds from the exposed rock. Old, abandoned gravel pits are normally used either as nature reserves, or as amenity areas for water sports, landfills and walking. In Germany former gravel or sand pits that have filled up with water are known as &quot;Baggersee&quot; (&quot;power dug lake&quot;) and popular for recreational use. In addition, many gravel pits in the United Kingdom have been stocked with freshwater fish such as the common carp to create coarse fishing locations. Gravel pit lakes have also been stocked with carp in Denmark, as well as rainbow trout.

== Products ==
Gravel pits are a main source of aggregates such as gravel and sand, which are extracted then processed extensively to be suitable for various uses. Aggregates are mined to make concrete, be crushed into construction aggregate, and for other industrial mineral uses. Gravel pits are located where there are rich sources of materials suitable to be crushed into aggregate, often at sites of fluvial, glacial, or floodplain geological deposits. Sedimentary and igneous rocks typically produce good quality aggregates of various sizes, but metamorphic rocks are rarely mined at gravel pits as they tend to have weaker geological structures. The strength of the aggregates mined at gravel pits is important to ensure that the products created using them have good structural integrity.

=== Production Process ===

Once a deposit of aggregate material is located (often in river valleys where rock has been carried downstream and settled overtime) the surface vegetation and topsoil is cleared to reveal the rock. Once a pit is dug into the aggregate, it can be lifted out by bulldozers that load it onto a conveyor or dredged out if the pit fills with water. It is then separated by particle size, crushed, and washed in preparation for use. Washing removes unwanted small particulate matter such as clay, silt, and sand, and is also a safety measure for dust control.

=== Product Uses ===
A major direct use of the aggregates produces at gravel pits is road construction. Road structure typically includes pavement and multiple sub-layers of aggregates of increasing sizes with depth beneath the pavement, up to several meters. All the layers of the road structure requires naturally occurring aggregates that are extracted from gravel pits or other surface material extraction sites. Beyond the initial construction of paved roads, gravel pits are important for the ongoing maintenance of unpaved roads because the surfaces of unpaved roads must be continually graded and re-surfaced with new loads of aggregate. In remote regions served by isolated unpaved roads, gravel pit operations are often located at strategic intervals every few hundred kilometers along the roadway in conjunction with road maintenance camps to provide the maintenance crews working out of these camps with the necessary materials. For example, along the Dempster Highway that stretches across the isolated northern region of Yukon Territory, Canada, there are several gravel pits in use for road maintenance and several more that have fallen into disuse. However, most are expected to be put back into operation in the near future as permafrost changes the road structure over time, which is a challenge affecting many isolated roads in the north, and one of the ways that gravel pits are particularly important to remote regions that face unique challenges.

== Issues Surrounding Gravel Pits ==

=== Environmental Impacts ===
Gravel pits disrupt the natural processes of the landscapes in which they are operating by displacing vegetation, soil, and rock. This in turn re-routes surface water flow changing runoff patterns, which can create further environmental problems for entire watersheds. Habitats are destroyed, displacing wildlife and removing plants, which changes the ecology of the region. Silica dust caused by aggregate extraction is stirred up and carried in the wind coating plant leaves and minimizing photosynthesis, which not only disrupts natural vegetative processes but also affects agriculture and can therefore disrupt rural economies. Environmental impact assessments must be conducted before such projects to mitigate negative affects, and rehabilitation efforts should be undertaken after projects to restore the natural ecosystem. Unfortunately, most old gravel pits have not been rehabilitated after aggregate extraction has ceased, and their potential to be restored to accommodate improved ecosystem function is wasted.
=== Human Health Impacts ===
The negative impacts on human health from gravel pit operations are well documented. Both workers of gravel pits and residents close to gravel pits are at risk of pulmonary issues ranging from shortness of breath and airway restriction to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and silicosis. The culprit of these issues is the fine silica dust created and stirred up by aggregate extraction processes and carried in the wind, which people breathe in and coats surfaces such as nearby homes and plants. There are also concerns that agricultural plants coated in dust from gravel pit operations pose a risk to human health through consumption if the plant contains the dust. There have been widespread movements by communities affected by gravel pit operations to have them moved away to less windy, residential, or agricultural areas, and for better safety precautions to be adopted for worker health.
== Rehabilitation Potential of Abandoned Gravel Pits ==
Once a gravel pit site is no longer producing aggregate it will often fall into disuse and be left abandoned. Many become informal recreation sites or transition into wetlands, lakes, or ponds as they fill with water, but remediation can help this process and reduce safety hazards they impose in their industrial state. Remediation programs can be undertaken to build abandoned gravel pits into sites of thriving wildlife habitats, parks or farmland, and/or be flooded and stocked for recreational fishing and to create aquatic ecosystems.

Stein is home to the &quot;Appenzell Folklore Museum&quot;, which is listed as a heritage site of national significance. The museum is devoted to Appenzell culture and handicrafts such as beltmaking, cowbells and carpentry. There is also an extensive display of traditional folk art, such as furniture decorated with scenes from daily scenes. The most prolific of these uncelebrated artists is Johannes Müller who also worked as a clockmaker.

Stein is also home to a show dairy. The various processes of cheesemaking can be watched from a gallery above the churns and vats.

The village center was built in the 18th century and includes the village church. The church was built in 1749 by Jakob and Hans Ulrich Grubenmann, and renovated in 1832/1833 by Gebhard Moosbrugger.

Between the hamlet of Störgel and the Haggen section of St. Gallen, is the highest foot bridge in Europe. The &quot;Ganggelibrugg&quot; (wacky bridge) stretches over the wide Sitter river canyon and is above the river. This bridge is the most used bridge in Switzerland for suicide.


===Heritage sites of national significance===
The Appenzeller Volkskunde-Museum, Eisensteg Zweibruggen (shared with St Gallen), Gmündertobel Bridge (with Teufen), Urnäschbrücke im Kubel (bridge shared with Herisau) and the Wattbach Bridge (shared with Teufen and St Gallen) are listed as heritage sites of national significance.

<text>Hans Poulsen Egede (31 January 1686 – 5 November 1758) was a Dano-Norwegian Lutheran missionary who launched mission efforts to Greenland, which led him to be styled the Apostle of Greenland. He established a successful mission among the Inuit and is credited with revitalizing Dano-Norwegian interest in the island after contact had been broken for about 300 years. He founded Greenland&#x27;s capital Godthåb, now known as Nuuk.

==Background==
Hans Egede was born into the home of a Danish-born civil servant, the priest son Povel Hansen Egede, and the Norwegian-born Kirsten Jensdatter Hind, daughter of a local merchant, in Harstad, Norway, nearly north of the Arctic Circle. His paternal grandfather had been a vicar in Vester Egede on southern Zealand, Denmark. Hans was schooled by an uncle, a clergyman in a local Lutheran Church. In 1704 he travelled to Copenhagen to enter the University of Copenhagen, where he earned a Bachelor&#x27;s degree in Theology. He returned to Hinnøya Island after graduation, and on 15 April 1707 he was ordained and assigned to a parish on the equally remote archipelago of Lofoten. Also in 1707 he married Gertrud Rasch (or &quot;Rask&quot;), who was 13 years his senior. Four children were born to the marriage – two boys and two girls.

==Greenland==
At Lofoten, Egede heard stories about the old Norse settlements on Greenland, with which contact had been lost centuries before. Beginning in 1711, he sought permission from Frederick IV of Denmark-Norway to search for the colony and establish a mission there, presuming that it had either remained Catholic after the Danish–Norwegian Reformation or been lost to the Christian faith altogether. Frederick gave consent at least partially to re-establish a colonial claim to the island.

Egede established the Bergen Greenland Company (&quot;&quot;) with $9,000 in capital from Bergen merchants, $200 from Frederick IV of Denmark and Norway, and a $300 annual grant from the Royal Mission College. The company was granted broad powers to govern the peninsula (as it was then considered to be), to raise its own army and navy, to collect taxes and to administer justice; the king and his council, however, refused to grant it monopoly rights to whaling and trade in Greenland out of a fear of antagonizing the Dutch.

&quot;Haabet&quot; (&quot;The Hope&quot;) and two smaller ships departed Bergen on 2 May 1721 bearing Egede, his wife and four children, and forty other colonists. On 3 July they reached Nuup Kangerlua and established Hope Colony (&quot;&quot;) with the erection of a portable house on Kangeq Island, which Egede christened the Island of Hope (&quot;Haabets Ø&quot;). Searching for months for descendants of the old Norse colonists, he found only the local Kalaallit people and began studying their language.

A common myth states that, as the Inuit had no bread nor any idea of it, Egede adapted the Lord&#x27;s Prayer as &quot;Give us this day our daily seal&quot;. Egede at first tried the word &quot;mamaq&quot; but it does not mean &quot;food&quot;, as Hans Egede thought, but &quot;how delicious!&quot; This first attempt stems from 1724, when he had only been in the country for three years and he has probably often heard someone say &quot;mamaq!&quot; It was not long before he came up with the word &quot;neqissat&quot;, &quot;food&quot;. When Egede&#x27;s son Poul published the four Gospels in print in 1744, he used the word &quot;timiusaq&quot;. This word was already written down by Hans in 1725 and is used by Greenlanders as an explanation of how bread looks. The old dictionaries suggest that at that time one could use the word “timia” in the sense of “bone marrow” or, as Samuel Kleinschmidt wrote in his dictionary in 1871, “the inner, porous part of the leg or Horn&quot;. “Timiusaq” therefore originally means “it which resembles bone marrow ”. Today, this word is used in it ecclesiastical languages in the sense of &quot;wafer&quot; and in North Greenland in the sense of &quot;ship&#x27;s biscuit&quot;.

By the end of the first winter, many of the colonists had been stricken with scurvy and most returned home as soon as they could. Egede and his family remained with a few others and in 1722 welcomed two supply ships the king had funded with the imposition of a new tax. His (now ship-borne) explorations found no Norse survivors along the western shore and future work was misled by the two mistaken beliefs both prevalent at the time that the Eastern Settlement would be located on Greenland&#x27;s east coast (it was later established it had been among the fjords of the island&#x27;s extreme southwest) and that a strait existed nearby communicating with the western half of the island. In fact, his 1723 expedition found the churches and ruins of the Eastern Settlement, but he considered them to be those of the Western. At the end of the year, he turned north and helped establish a whaling station on Nipisat Island. In 1724 he baptized his first child converts, two of whom would travel to Denmark and there inspire Count Zinzendorf to begin the Moravian missions.

In 1728, a royal expedition under Major Claus Paarss arrived with four supply ships and moved the Kangeq colony to the mainland opposite, establishing a fort named Godt-Haab (&quot;Good Hope&quot;), the future Godthåb. The extra supplies also allowed Egede to build a proper chapel within the main house. More scurvy led to forty deaths and abandonment of the site not only by the Danes but by the Inuit as well. Egede&#x27;s book &quot;The Old Greenland&#x27;s New Perlustration&quot; () appeared in 1729 and was translated into several languages, but King Frederick had lost patience and recalled Paarss&#x27;s military garrison from Greenland the next year. Egede, encouraged by his wife Gertrud, remained with his family and ten sailors.

A supply ship in 1733 brought three missionaries and news that the king had granted 2,000 rixdollars a year to establish a new company for the colony under Jacob Severin. The Moravians (their leader was Christian David) were allowed to establish a station at Neu-Herrnhut (which became the nucleus of modern Nuuk, Greenland&#x27;s capital) and in time a string of missions along the island&#x27;s west coast. The ship also returned one of Egede&#x27;s convert children with a case of smallpox. By the next year, the epidemic was raging among the Inuit and in 1735 it claimed Gertrud Egede. Hans carried her body back to Denmark for burial the next year, leaving his son Poul to carry on his work. In Copenhagen, he was named Superintendent of the Greenland Mission Seminary (&quot;Seminarium Groenlandicum&quot;) and in 1741 the Lutheran Bishop of Greenland. A catechism for use in Greenland was completed by 1747. He died on 5 November 1758 at the age of 72 in Stubbekøbing at Falster, Denmark.

==Legacy==
Egede holds the legacy of a national &quot;saint&quot; of Greenland. The town of Egedesminde ( &quot;Memory of Egede&quot;) commemorates him. It was established by Hans&#x27;s second son, Niels, in 1759 on the Eqalussuit peninsula. It was moved to the island of Aasiaat in 1763, which had been the site of a pre-Viking Inuit settlement. His grandson and namesake Hans Egede Saabye also became a missionary to Greenland and published a celebrated diary of his time there.

The Royal Danish Geographical Society established the Egede Medal in his honour in 1916. The medal is in silver and awarded &#x27;preferably for geographical studies and researches in the Arctic countries&#x27;.

A crater on the Moon is named after him: the Egede crater on the south edge of the Mare Frigoris (the Sea of Cold). The historical fiction novel &quot;The Prophets of Eternal Fjord&quot; narrates a tale of a missionary priest under Egede&#x27;s instruction embarking upon Greenland to convert its indigenous peoples to Christianity. 

Statues of Hans Egede stand watch over Greenland&#x27;s capital in Nuuk, outside of Vågan Church (&quot;Lofotkatedralen&quot;) in Kabelvåg and outside of Frederik&#x27;s Church (&quot;Marmorkirken&quot;) in Copenhagen. Egede&#x27;s statue at Frederick&#x27;s Church in Copenhagen was vandalized with the word &quot;decolonize&quot; spray-painted on its base on June 20, 2020, during worldwide protests against memorials of colonial figures. Another Egede statue in Nuuk, Greenland was likewise vandalized ten days later. In a subsequent vote, 921 voted to keep the statue while 600 wanted it removed.

Hans Egede gave one of the oldest descriptions of a sea serpent, now believed to have been a giant squid. On 6 July 1734 he wrote that his ship was off the Greenland coast when those on board &quot;saw a most terrible creature, resembling nothing they saw before. The monster lifted its head so high that it seemed to be higher than the crow&#x27;s nest on the mainmast. The head was small and the body short and wrinkled. The unknown creature was using giant fins which propelled it through the water. Later the sailors saw its tail as well. The monster was longer than our whole ship&quot;.

<text>Paxton Pits is an area of active and disused gravel pits at Little Paxton in Cambridgeshire, England. The pits are in the valley of the River Great Ouse.

The disused pits have been turned into a nature reserve with of lakes, meadow, grassland, scrub and woodland. The reserve is famous for its nightingales and cormorants and is home to a wide variety of other birds, insects, mammals and flora.

There are two marked self-guided walking routes around the reserve, together with the River Trail that follows the route of the Ouse Valley Way.

The circular Heron Trail (the first mile of which is a hard-surfaced track suitable for wheelchairs, pushchairs and all-season walking) goes past lakes, through woodland and along the river bank, and which has three bird hides to view the water birds.

The circular Meadow Trail goes through meadows and around lakes and is especially good for wildflowers in spring and summer and dragonflies on sunny days, although some of the paths become quite muddy in winter and during wet weather.

The reserve has free parking at the visitor and education centre, with a café and toilets.

<doc id="318597" wikidata="Q337272" url="?curid=318597" title="Commodore BASIC">
<text>Commodore BASIC, also known as PET BASIC or CBM-BASIC, is the dialect of the BASIC programming language used in Commodore International&#x27;s 8-bit home computer line, stretching from the PET (1977) to the Commodore 128 (1985).

The core is based on 6502 Microsoft BASIC, and as such it shares many characteristics with other 6502 BASICs of the time, such as Applesoft BASIC. Commodore licensed BASIC from Microsoft in 1977 on a &quot;pay once, no royalties&quot; basis after Jack Tramiel turned down Bill Gates&#x27; offer of a per unit fee, stating, &quot;I&#x27;m already married,&quot; and would pay no more than for a perpetual license.

The original PET version was very similar to the original Microsoft implementation with few modifications. BASIC 2.0 on the C64 was also similar, and was also seen on C128s (in C64 mode) and other models. Later PETs featured BASIC 4.0, similar to the original but adding a number of commands for working with floppy disks.

BASIC 3.5 was the first to really deviate, adding a number of commands for graphics and sound support on the C16 and Plus/4. BASIC 7.0 was included with the Commodore 128, and included structured programming commands from the Plus/4&#x27;s BASIC 3.5, as well as keywords designed specifically to take advantage of the machine&#x27;s new capabilities. A sprite editor and machine language monitor were added. The last, BASIC 10.0, was part of the unreleased Commodore 65.

==History==
Commodore took the source code of the flat-fee BASIC and further developed it internally for all their other 8-bit home computers. It was not until the Commodore 128 (with V7.0) that a Microsoft copyright notice was displayed. However, Microsoft had built an easter egg into the version 2 or &quot;upgrade&quot; Commodore Basic that proved its provenance: typing the command codice_1 would result in codice_2 appearing on the screen. (The easter egg was well-obfuscated—the message did not show up in any disassembly of the interpreter.)

The popular Commodore 64 came with BASIC v2.0 in ROM even though the computer was released after the PET/CBM series that had version 4.0 because the 64 was intended as a home computer, while the PET/CBM series were targeted at business and educational use where their built-in programming language was presumed to be more heavily used. This saved manufacturing costs, as the V2 fit into smaller ROMs.

==Technical details==
===Program editing===
A convenient feature of Commodore&#x27;s ROM-resident BASIC interpreter and KERNAL was the full-screen editor. Although Commodore keyboards only have two cursor keys which reversed direction when the shift key was held, the screen editor allowed users to enter direct commands or to input and edit program lines from anywhere on the screen. If a line was prefixed with a line number, it was tokenized and stored in program memory. Lines not beginning with a number were executed by pressing the key whenever the cursor happened to be on the line. This marked a significant upgrade in program entry interfaces compared to other common home computer BASICs at the time, which typically used line editors, invoked by a separate codice_3 command, or a &quot;copy cursor&quot; that truncated the line at the cursor&#x27;s position.

It also had the capability of saving named files to any device, including the cassette – a popular storage device in the days of the PET, and one that remained in use throughout the lifespan of the 8-bit Commodores as an inexpensive form of mass storage. Most systems only supported filenames on diskette, which made saving multiple files on other devices more difficult. The user of one of these other systems had to note the recorder&#x27;s counter display at the location of the file, but this was inaccurate and prone to error. With the PET (and BASIC 2.0), files from cassettes could be requested by name. The device would search for the filename by reading data sequentially, ignoring any non-matching filenames. The file system was also supported by a powerful record structure that could be loaded or saved to files. Commodore cassette data was recorded digitally, rather than less expensive (and less reliable) analog methods used by other manufacturers. Therefore, the specialized Datasette was required rather than a standard tape recorder. Adapters were available that used an analog-to-digital converter to allow use of a standard recorder, but these cost only a little less than the Datasette.

The command may be used with the optional parameter which will load a program into the memory address contained in the first two bytes of the file (these bytes are discarded and not retained in memory). If the parameter is not used, the program will load into the start of the BASIC program area, which widely differs between machines. Some Commodore BASIC variants supplied codice_4 and codice_5 commands that worked like their counterparts in Applesoft BASIC, loading or saving bitmaps from specified memory locations.

The PET does not support relocatable programs and the command will always load at the first two bytes contained in the program file. This created a problem when trying to load BASIC programs saved on other Commodore machines as they would load at a higher address than where the PET&#x27;s BASIC expected the program to be, there were workarounds to &quot;move&quot; programs to the proper location. If a program was saved on a CBM-II machine, the only way to load it on a PET was by modifying the first two bytes with a disk sector editor as the CBM-II series had their BASIC program area at $0, which would result in a PET attempting to load into the zero page and locking up.

Commodore BASIC keywords could be abbreviated by entering first an unshifted keypress, and then a shifted keypress of the next letter. This set the high bit, causing the interpreter to stop reading and parse the statement according to a lookup table. This meant that the statement up to where the high bit was set was accepted as a substitute for typing the entire command out. However, since all BASIC keywords were stored in memory as single byte tokens, this was a convenience for statement entry rather than an optimization.

In the default uppercase-only character set, shifted characters appear as a graphics symbol; e.g. the command, codice_6, could be abbreviated codice_7 (which resembled codice_8 onscreen). Most such commands were two letters long, but in some cases they were longer. In cases like this, there was an ambiguity, so more unshifted letters of the command were needed, such as codice_9 (codice_10) being required for codice_11. Some commands had no abbreviated form, either due to brevity or ambiguity with other commands. For example, the command, codice_12 had no abbreviation because its spelling collided with the separate codice_13 keyword, which was located nearer to the beginning of the keyword lookup table. The heavily used codice_14 command had a single codice_15 shortcut, as was common in most Microsoft BASIC dialects. Abbreviating commands with shifted letters is unique to Commodore BASIC.

This tokenizing method had a glitch such that if one included a codice_16 (BASIC statement to add a comment to the code) followed by a codice_17, when trying to view the program listing, the BASIC interpreter would immediately abort the listing, display a codice_18 and return to the codice_19 prompt. This glitch was used to some effect by programmers who wanted to try and protect their work, although it was fairly easy to circumvent.

By abbreviating keywords, it was possible to fit more code on a single program line (which could take up two screen lines on 40-column displays - i.e., C64 or PET, or four lines on the VIC-20&#x27;s 22-column display). This allowed for a slight saving on the overhead to store otherwise necessary extra program lines, but nothing more. All BASIC commands were tokenized and took up 1 byte (or two, in the case of several commands of BASIC 7 or BASIC 10) in memory no matter which way they were entered. Such long lines were a nuisance to edit. The codice_20 command displayed the entire command keyword - extending the program line beyond the 2 or 4 screen lines which could be entered into program memory.

===Performance===
Like the original Microsoft BASIC interpreter, Commodore BASIC is slower than native machine code. Test results have shown that copying 16 kilobytes from ROM to RAM takes less than a second in machine code, compared to over a minute in BASIC. To execute faster than the interpreter, programmers started using various techniques to speed up execution. One was to store often-used floating point values in variables rather than using literal values, as interpreting a variable name was faster than interpreting a literal number. Since floating point is default type for all commands, it&#x27;s faster to use floating point numbers as arguments, rather than integers. When speed was important, some programmers converted sections of BASIC programs to 6502 or 6510 assembly language that was loaded separately from a file or POKEd into memory from DATA statements at the end of the BASIC program, and executed from BASIC using the codice_21 command, either from direct mode or from the program itself. When the execution speed of machine language was too great, such as for a game or when waiting for user input, programmers could poll by reading selected memory locations (such as for the 64, or for the 128, denoting size of the keyboard queue) to delay or halt execution.

A unique feature of Commodore BASIC is the use of control codes to perform tasks such as clearing the screen or positioning the cursor within a program; these can be invoked either by issuing a command where X corresponds to the control code to be issued (for example, is the control code to clear the screen) or by pressing the key in question between quote marks, thus pressing following a quote mark will cause BASIC to display the visual representation of the control code (in this case, a reversed heart) which is then acted upon at program execution (directly printing out the control codes uses less memory and executes faster than invoking a function). This is in comparison to other implementations of BASIC which typically have dedicated commands to clear the screen or move the cursor.

BASIC 3.5 and up have proper commands for clearing the screen and moving the cursor.

Program lines in Commodore BASIC do not require spaces anywhere (but the command will always display one between the line number and the statement), e.g., , and it was common to write programs with no spacing. This feature was added to conserve memory since the tokenizer never removes any space inserted between keywords: the presence of spaces results in extra codice_22 bytes in the tokenized program which are merely skipped during execution. Spaces between the line number and program statement are removed by the tokenizer.

Program lines can be 80 characters total on most machines, but machines with 40 column text would cause the line to wrap around to the next line on the screen, and on the VIC-20, which had a 22 column display, program lines could occupy as many as four. BASIC 7.0 on the Commodore 128 increased the limit of a program line to 160 characters (four 40-column lines or two 80-column lines). By using abbreviations such as instead of , it is possible to fit even more on a line. BASIC 7.0 displays a error if the user enters a program line over 160 characters in length. Earlier versions do not produced an error and simply display the READY prompt two lines down if the line length is exceeded. The line number is counted in the number of characters in the program line, so a five digit line number will result in four fewer characters allowed than a one digit number.

The order of execution of Commodore BASIC lines was not determined by line numbering; instead, it followed the order in which the lines were linked in memory. Program lines were stored in memory as a singly linked list with a pointer (containing the address of the beginning of the next program line), a line number, and then the tokenized code for the line. While a program was being entered, BASIC would constantly reorder program lines in memory so that the line numbers and pointers were all in ascending order. However, after a program was entered, manually altering the line numbers and pointers with the POKE commands could allow for out-of-order execution or even give each line the same line number. In the early days, when BASIC was used commercially, this was a software protection technique to discourage casual modification of the program.

Line numbers can range from 0 to 65520 and take five bytes to store regardless of how many digits are in the line number, although execution is faster the fewer digits there are. Putting multiple statements on a line will use less memory and execute faster.

 and statements will search downward from the current line to find a line number if a forward jump is performed, in case of a backwards jump, they will return to the start of the program to begin searching. This will slow down larger programs, so it is preferable to put commonly used subroutines near the start of a program.

Variable names are only significant to 2 characters; thus the variable names codice_23, codice_24, and codice_25 all refer to the same variable.

Commodore BASIC also supports bitwise operators , and , although this feature was part of the core Microsoft 6502 BASIC code, it was usually omitted in other implementations such as Applesoft BASIC.

The native number format of Commodore BASIC, like that of its parent MS BASIC, was floating point. Most contemporary BASIC implementations used one byte for the characteristic (exponent) and three bytes for the mantissa. The accuracy of a floating point number using a three-byte mantissa is only about 6.5 decimal digits, and round-off error is common. 6502 implementations of Microsoft BASIC utilized 40-bit floating point arithmetic, meaning that variables took five bytes to store (four byte mantissa and one byte for the exponent) unlike the 32-bit floating point found in BASIC-80.

While 8080/Z80 implementations of Microsoft BASIC supported integer and double precision variables, 6502 implementations were floating point only.

Although Commodore BASIC supports signed integer variables (denoted with a percent sign) in the range -32768 to 32767, in practice they are only used for array variables and serve the function of conserving memory by limiting array elements to two bytes each (an array of 2000 elements will occupy 10,000 bytes if declared as a floating point array, but only 4000 if declared as an integer array). Denoting any variable as integer simply causes BASIC to convert it back to floating point, slowing down program execution and wasting memory as each percent sign takes one additional byte to store (since this also applies to integer arrays, the programmer should avoid using them unless very large arrays are used that would exceed available memory if stored as floating point). Also, it is not possible to or memory locations above 32767 with address defined as a signed integer.

A period (.) can be used in place of the number 0 (thus instead of or instead of ), this will execute slightly faster.

The statement, used to start machine language programs, was added by Commodore and was not in the original Microsoft BASIC code, which featured only the USR function for invoking machine language routines. It automatically loads the CPU&#x27;s registers with the values in (C64, varies on other machines)--this can be used to pass data to machine language routines or as a means of calling kernal functions from BASIC (as an example, clears the screen).

Since Commodore 8-bit machines other than the C128 cannot automatically boot disk software, the usual technique is to include a BASIC stub like to begin program execution. It is possible to automatically start software after loading and not require the user to type a statement, this is done by having a piece of code that hooks the BASIC &quot;ready&quot; vector at .

As with most other versions of Microsoft BASIC, if an array is not declared with a statement, it is automatically set to ten elements (in practice 11 since array elements are counted from 0). Larger arrays must be declared or BASIC will display an error when the program is run and an array cannot be re-dimensioned in a program unless all variables are wiped via a CLR statement. Numeric arrays are automatically filled with zeros when they are created, there may be a momentary delay in program execution if a large array is dimensioned.

String variables are represented by tagging the variable name with a dollar sign. Thus, the variables codice_26, codice_27, and codice_28 would each be understood as distinct. Array variables are also considered distinct from simple variables, thus and do not refer to the same variable. The size of a string array merely refers to how many strings are stored in the array, not the size of each element, which is allocated dynamically. Unlike some other implementations of Microsoft BASIC, Commodore BASIC does not require string space to be reserved at the start of a program.

Unlike other 8-bit machines such as the Apple II, Commodore&#x27;s machines all have a built-in clock that is initialized to 0 at power on and updated with every tick of the PIA/VIA/TED/CIA timer, thus 60 times per second. It is assigned two system variables in BASIC, and , which both contain the current time. TI is read-only and cannot be modified; doing so will result in a Syntax Error message. may be used to set the time via a six number string (an error results from using a string other than six numbers). The clock is not a very reliable method of timekeeping since it stops whenever interrupts are turned off (done by some kernal routines) and accessing the IEC (or IEEE port on the PET) port will slow the clock update by a few ticks.

The function in Commodore BASIC can use the clock to generate random numbers; this is accomplished by , however it is of relatively limited use as only numbers between 0 and 255 are returned. Otherwise, works the same as other implementations of Microsoft BASIC in that a pseudo-random sequence is used via a fixed 5-byte seed value stored at power on in memory locations on the C64 (the location differs on other machines). with any number higher than 0 will generate a random number amalgamated from the value included with the function and the seed value, which is updated by 1 each time an RND function is executed. with a negative number goes to a point in the sequence of the current seed value specified by the number.

Since true random number generation is impossible with the statement, it is more typical on the C64 and C128 to utilize the SID chip&#x27;s white noise channel for random numbers.

BASIC 2.0 notoriously suffered from extremely slow garbage collection of strings. Garbage collection is automatically invoked any time a function is executed and if there are many string variables and arrays that have been manipulated over the course of a program, clearing them can take more than an hour under the worst conditions. It is also not possible to abort garbage collection as BASIC does not scan the RUN/STOP key while performing this routine. BASIC 4.0 introduced an improved garbage collection system with back pointers and all later implementations of Commodore BASIC also have it.

The function in BASIC 2.0 suffered from another technical flaw in that it cannot handle signed numbers over 32768, thus if the function is invoked on a C64 (38k BASIC memory), a negative amount of free BASIC memory will be displayed (adding 65535 to the reported number will obtain the correct amount of free memory). The PET and VIC-20 never had more than 32k of total memory available to BASIC, so this limitation did not become apparent until the C64 was developed. The function on BASIC 3.5 and 7.0 corrected this problem and on BASIC 7.0 was also &quot;split&quot; into two functions, one to display free BASIC program text memory and the other to display free variable memory.

==Alternatives==
Many BASIC extensions were released for the Commodore 64, due to the relatively limited capabilities of its native BASIC 2.0. One of the most popular extensions was the DOS Wedge, which was included on the Commodore 1541 Test/Demo Disk. This 1 KB extension to BASIC added a number of disk-related commands, including the ability to read a disk directory without destroying the program in memory. Its features were subsequently incorporated in various third-party extensions, such as the popular Epyx FastLoad cartridge. Other BASIC extensions added additional keywords to make it easier to code sprites, sound, and high-resolution graphics like Simons&#x27; BASIC (1983) and Vision BASIC (2022).

Although BASIC 2.0&#x27;s lack of sound or graphics features was frustrating to many users, some critics argued that it was ultimately beneficial since it forced the user to learn machine language.

The limitations of BASIC 2.0 on the C64 led to use of built-in ROM machine language from BASIC. To load a file to a designated memory location, the filename, drive, and device number would be read by a call: ; the location would be specified in the X and Y registers: ; and the load routine would be called: .

A disk magazine for the C64, &quot;Loadstar&quot;, was a venue for hobbyist programmers, who shared collections of proto-commands for BASIC, called with the command.

From a modern programming point of view, the earlier versions of Commodore BASIC presented a host of bad programming traps for the programmer. As most of these issues derived from Microsoft BASIC, virtually every home computer BASIC of the era suffered from similar deficiencies. Every line of a Microsoft BASIC program was assigned a line number by the programmer. It was common practice to increment numbers by some value (5, 10 or 100) to make inserting lines during program editing or debugging easier, but bad planning meant that inserting large sections into a program often required restructuring the entire code. A common technique was to start a program at some low line number with an jump table, with the body of the program structured into sections starting at a designated line number like 1000, 2000, and so on. If a large section needed to be added, it could just be assigned the next available major line number and inserted to the jump table.

In addition, all variables are treated as global variables. Clearly defined loops beyond the FOR...NEXT construct are hard to create, often causing the programmer to rely on the command (this was later rectified in BASIC 3.5 with the addition of the , and commands). Flag variables often needed to be created to perform certain tasks. 

Later BASIC versions on Commodore and other platforms included a and command, as well as an AUTO line numbering command that would automatically select and insert line numbers according to a selected increment. Earlier BASICs from Commodore also lack debugging commands, meaning that bugs and unused variables are hard to trap. structures, a standard part of Z80 Microsoft BASICs, were added to BASIC 3.5 after being unavailable in earlier versions of Commodore BASIC.

==Use as user interface==
In common with other home computers, Commodore&#x27;s machines booted directly into the BASIC interpreter. BASIC&#x27;s file and programming commands could be entered in direct mode to load and execute software. If program execution was halted using the RUN/STOP key, variable values would be preserved in RAM and could be PRINTed for debugging. The 128 even dedicated its second 64k bank to variable storage, allowing values to persist until a codice_29 or codice_30 command was issued. This, along with the advanced screen editor included with Commodore BASIC gave the programming environment a REPL-like feel; programmers could insert and edit program lines at any screen location, interactively building the program. This is in contrast to business-oriented operating systems of the time like CP/M or MS-DOS, which typically booted into a command line interface. If a programming language was required on these platforms, it had to be loaded separately.

While some versions of Commodore BASIC included disk-specific codice_31 and codice_32 commands, the version built into the Commodore 64 lacked these, requiring the user to specify the disk drive&#x27;s device number (typically 8 or 9) to the standard codice_33 command, which otherwise defaulted to tape. Another omission from the Commodore 64s BASIC 2.0 was a codice_34 command to display a disk&#x27;s contents without clearing main memory. On the 64, viewing files on a disk was implemented as loading a &quot;program&quot; which when listed showed the directory as a pseudo BASIC program, with the file&#x27;s block size as the line number. This had the effect of overwriting the currently loaded program. Addons like the DOS Wedge overcame this by rendering the directory listing direct to screen memory.

<doc id="318598" wikidata="Q370085" url="?curid=318598" title="Paul Halmos">
<text>Paul Richard Halmos (; 3 March 3 1916 – 2 October 2006) was a Hungarian-born American mathematician and probabilist who made fundamental advances in the areas of mathematical logic, probability theory, operator theory, ergodic theory, and functional analysis (in particular, Hilbert spaces). He was also recognized as a great mathematical expositor. He has been described as one of The Martians.

==Early life and education==
Born in the Kingdom of Hungary into a Jewish family, Halmos immigrated to the United States at age 13. He obtained his B.A. from the University of Illinois, majoring in mathematics while also fulfilling the requirements for a degree in philosophy. He obtained the degree after only three years, and was 19 years old when he graduated. He then began a Ph.D. in philosophy, still at the Champaign–Urbana campus. However, after failing his masters&#x27; oral exams, he shifted to mathematics and graduated in 1938. Joseph L. Doob supervised his dissertation, titled &quot;Invariants of Certain Stochastic Transformations: The Mathematical Theory of Gambling Systems&quot;.

==Career==
Shortly after his graduation, Halmos left for the Institute for Advanced Study, lacking both job and grant money. Six months later, he was working under John von Neumann, which proved a decisive experience. While at the Institute, Halmos wrote his first book, &quot;Finite Dimensional Vector Spaces&quot;, which immediately established his reputation as a fine expositor of mathematics.

From 1967 to 1968 he was the Donegall Lecturer in Mathematics at Trinity College Dublin.

Halmos taught at Syracuse University, the University of Chicago (1946–60), the University of Michigan (~1961–67), the University of Hawaii (1967–68), Indiana University (1969–85), and the University of California at Santa Barbara (1976–78). From his 1985 retirement from Indiana until his death, he was affiliated with the Mathematics department at Santa Clara University (1985–2006).

==Accomplishments==
In a series of papers reprinted in his 1962 &quot;Algebraic Logic&quot;, Halmos devised polyadic algebras, an algebraic version of first-order logic differing from the better known cylindric algebras of Alfred Tarski and his students. An elementary version of polyadic algebra is described in monadic Boolean algebra.

In addition to his original contributions to mathematics, Halmos was an unusually clear and engaging expositor of university mathematics. He won the Lester R. Ford Award in 1971 and again in 1977 (shared with W. P. Ziemer, W. H. Wheeler, S. H. Moolgavkar, J. H. Ewing and W. H. Gustafson). Halmos chaired the American Mathematical Society committee that wrote the AMS style guide for academic mathematics, published in 1973. In 1983, he received the AMS&#x27;s Leroy P. Steele Prize for exposition.

In the &quot;American Scientist&quot; 56(4): 375–389 (Winter 1968), Halmos argued that mathematics is a creative art, and that mathematicians should be seen as artists, not number crunchers. He discussed the division of the field into and , further arguing that mathematicians and painters think and work in related ways.

Halmos&#x27;s 1985 &quot;automathography&quot; &quot;I Want to Be a Mathematician&quot; is an account of what it was like to be an academic mathematician in 20th century America. He called the book &quot;automathography&quot; rather than &quot;autobiography&quot;, because its focus is almost entirely on his life as a mathematician, not his personal life. The book contains the following quote on Halmos&#x27; view of what doing mathematics means:

In these memoirs, Halmos claims to have invented the &quot;iff&quot; notation for the words &quot;if and only if&quot; and to have been the first to use the &quot;tombstone&quot; notation to signify the end of a proof, and this is generally agreed to be the case. The tombstone symbol ∎ (Unicode U+220E) is sometimes called a &quot;halmos&quot;.

In 1994, Halmos received the Deborah and Franklin Haimo Award for Distinguished College or University Teaching of Mathematics.

In 2005, Halmos and his wife Virginia Halmos funded the Euler Book Prize, an annual award given by the Mathematical Association of America for a book that is likely to improve the view of mathematics among the public. The first prize was given in 2007, the 300th anniversary of Leonhard Euler&#x27;s birth, to John Derbyshire for his book about Bernhard Riemann and the Riemann hypothesis: Prime Obsession.

In 2009 George Csicsery featured Halmos in a documentary film also called &quot;I Want to Be a Mathematician&quot;.

<doc id="318600" wikidata="Q166468" url="?curid=318600" title="Hurricane Isabel">
<text>Hurricane Isabel was the strongest Atlantic hurricane since Mitch, and the deadliest, costliest, and most intense tropical cyclone in the 2003 Atlantic hurricane season. Hurricane Isabel was also the strongest hurricane in the open waters of the Atlantic, both by wind speed and central pressure, before being surpassed by hurricanes Irma and Dorian in 2017 and 2019, respectively. The ninth named storm, fifth hurricane, and second major hurricane of the season, Isabel formed near the Cape Verde Islands from a tropical wave on September 6, in the tropical Atlantic Ocean. It moved northwestward, and within an environment of light wind shear and warm waters, it steadily strengthened to reach peak winds of on September 11. After fluctuating in intensity for four days, during which it displayed annular characteristics, Isabel gradually weakened and made landfall on the Outer Banks of North Carolina, with winds of on September 18. Isabel quickly weakened over land and became extratropical over western Pennsylvania on the next day. On September 20, the extratropical remnants of Isabel were absorbed into another system over Eastern Canada.

In North Carolina, the storm surge from Isabel washed out a portion of Hatteras Island to form what was unofficially known as Isabel Inlet. Damage was greatest along the Outer Banks, where thousands of homes were damaged or even destroyed. The worst of the effects of Isabel occurred in Virginia, especially in the Hampton Roads area and along the shores of rivers as far west and north as Richmond and Baltimore. Virginia reported the most deaths and damage from the hurricane. About 64% of the damage and 69% of the deaths occurred in North Carolina and Virginia. Electric service was disrupted in areas of Virginia for several days, some more rural areas were without electricity for weeks, and local flooding caused thousands of dollars in damage.

Moderate to severe damage extended up the Atlantic coastline and as far inland as West Virginia. Roughly six million people were left without electric service in the eastern United States from the strong winds of Isabel. Rainfall from the storm extended from South Carolina to Maine, and westward to Michigan. Throughout the path of Isabel, damage totaled about $3.6 billion (2003 USD). 16 deaths in seven U.S. states were directly related to the hurricane, with 35 deaths in six states and one Canadian province indirectly related to the hurricane.

==Meteorological history==

A tropical wave moved off the western coast of Africa on September 1. An area of low pressure associated with the wave moved slowly westward, and its convection initially appeared to become better organized. On September 3, as it passed to the south of the Cape Verde islands, organization within the system degraded, though convection increased the next day. The system gradually became better organized, and Dvorak classifications began early on September 5. Based on the development of a closed surface circulation, it is estimated the system developed into Tropical Depression Thirteen early on September 6. Hours later, it intensified into Tropical Storm Isabel, though operationally the National Hurricane Center did not begin issuing advisories until 13 hours after it first developed.

Located within an area of light wind shear and warm waters, Isabel gradually organized as curved bands developed around a circular area of deep convection near the center. It steadily strengthened as it moved to the west-northwest, and Isabel strengthened to a hurricane on September 7 subsequent to the development of a large, yet ragged eye located near the deepest convection. The eye, overall convective pattern, and outflow steadily improved in organization, and deep convection quickly surrounded the -wide eye. Isabel intensified on September 8 to reach major hurricane status while located east-northeast of Barbuda. On September 9, Isabel reached an initial peak intensity of for around 24 hours, a minimal Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale.
Early on September 10, the eyewall became less defined, the convection near the eye became eroded, and northeasterly outflow became slightly restricted. As a result, Isabel weakened slightly to a Category 3 hurricane. The hurricane turned more to the west due to the influence of the Bermuda-Azores High. Later on September 10, Isabel restrengthened to a Category 4 hurricane after convection deepened near the increasingly organizing eyewall. The hurricane continued to intensify, and Isabel reached its peak intensity of and a minimum central pressure of 915 mbar (hPa; 27.02 inHg) on September 11, a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. Due to an eyewall replacement cycle, Isabel weakened slightly, though it retained Category 5 status for 24 hours. As Isabel underwent another eyewall replacement cycle, outflow degraded in appearance and convection around the eye weakened, and early on September 13, Isabel weakened to a strong Category 4 hurricane. A weakness in the ridge to its north allowed the hurricane to turn to the west-northwest. After completing the replacement cycle, the hurricane&#x27;s large wide eye became better defined, and late on September 13, Isabel re-attained Category 5 status. During this time, Isabel attained annular characteristics, becoming highly symmetrical in shape and sporting a wide eye. Hurricane Isabel also displayed a &quot;pinwheel&quot; eye, a rare feature that is found in some annular tropical cyclones. A NOAA Hurricane Hunter Reconnaissance Aircraft flying into the hurricane launched a dropsonde which measured an instantaneous wind speed of , the strongest instantaneous wind speed recorded in an Atlantic hurricane. Cloud tops warmed again shortly thereafter, and Isabel weakened to a strong Category 4 hurricane early on September 14. Later that day, it re-organized, and for the third time, Isabel attained Category 5 status while located north of San Juan, Puerto Rico.
Cloud tops around the center warmed again early on September 15, and Isabel weakened to a Category 4 hurricane. Later that day, the inner core of deep convection began to deteriorate, while the eye decayed in appearance. As a ridge to its northwest built southeastward, it resulted in Isabel decelerating as it turned to the north-northwest. Increasing vertical wind shear contributed in weakening the hurricane further, and Isabel weakened to a Category 2 hurricane on September 16, while located southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. Convection remained minimal, though outflow retained excellent organization, and Isabel remained a Category 2 hurricane for two days, until it made landfall between Cape Lookout and Ocracoke Island on September 18, with winds of . Isabel was a large hurricane at landfall, with a windfield of . The system weakened after it made landfall, though due to its fast forward motion, Isabel remained a hurricane until it reached western Virginia, early on September 19. After passing through West Virginia as a tropical storm, Isabel became extratropical over Western Pennsylvania, near Pittsburgh. The system continued turned northward, and crossed Lake Erie into Canada. Early on September 20, the extratropical remnant of Isabel was absorbed by a larger extratropical storm, over the Cochrane District of Ontario.

==Preparations==

Two days before Isabel made landfall, the National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane watch from Little River, South Carolina to Chincoteague, Virginia, including the Pamlico and Albemarle Sounds and the lower Chesapeake Bay. The NHC also issued a tropical storm watch south of Little River, South Carolina to the mouth of the Santee River, as well as from Chincoteague, Virginia northward to Little Egg Inlet, New Jersey. Hurricane and tropical storm warnings were gradually issued for portions of the East Coast of the United States. By the time Isabel made landfall, a tropical storm warning existed from Chincoteague, Virginia to Fire Island, New York and from Cape Fear, North Carolina to the mouth of the Santee River in South Carolina, and a hurricane warning existed from Chincoteague, Virginia to Cape Fear. Landfall forecasts were very accurate; from three days prior, the average track forecast error for its landfall was only , and for 48 hours in advance the average track error was .

Officials declared mandatory evacuations for 24 counties in North Carolina, Virginia, and Maryland, though in general not many left. According to a survey conducted by the United States Department of Commerce, evacuation rates were estimated as follows; 45% in the Outer Banks, 23% in the area around the Pamlico Sound, 23% in Virginia, and about 15% in Maryland. The threat of Isabel resulted in the evacuation of hundreds of thousands of residents, primarily in North Carolina and Virginia, and included more than 12,000 residents staying in emergency shelters.

19 major airports along the East Coast of the United States were closed, with more than 1,500 flights canceled. The Washington Metro and Metrobus system closed prior to the arrival of the storm, and Amtrak canceled nearly all trains south of the nation&#x27;s capital. Schools and businesses throughout its path closed prior to Isabel&#x27;s arrival to allow time to prepare; hardware and home improvement stores reported brisk business of plywood, flashlights, batteries, and portable generators, as residents prepared for the storm&#x27;s potential impact. The federal government was closed excluding emergency staff members. The United States Navy ordered the removal of 40 ships and submarines and dozens of aircraft from naval sites near Norfolk, Virginia.

A contingency plan was established at the Tomb of the Unknowns at Arlington National Cemetery that, should the winds exceed , the guards could take positions in the trophy room (above the Tomb Plaza and providing continual sight of the Tomb) but the plan was never implemented. However, it spawned an urban legend that the Third Infantry sent orders to seek shelter, orders that were deliberately disobeyed.

News stations were stationed with crews along the Jersey shore several days in advance of Isabel to provide breaking news and live conditions. Many residents prepared their houses by boarding windows and purchasing emergency supplies. The Sussex County chapter of the American Red Cross advised local high schools to be on stand-by as potential shelters in the event evacuation occurred. Emergency coordinators in several counties were on alert, though none issued evacuations. In preparation for anticipated power outages, the Jersey Central Power and Light company arranged to receive more electrical crews from its parent company, FirstEnergy. Other utility workers from various locations as far as Canada left for the state in the event of power outages. Several flights in and out of the state were delayed or canceled, and the Cape May-Lewes Ferry canceled travel across the Delaware Bay during the duration of Isabel. In Atlantic City, casino workers prepared for coastal flooding by placing sandbags at boardwalk entrances. New Jersey Transit workers secured its buses, railways, and light rail equipment. To ensure service would remain accessible during and after the hurricane, NJ Transit prepared backup generators, pumps, and chainsaws, with workers inspecting trains and the paths of the lines. FEMA mobilized and dispatched an Urban Search and Rescue Task Force of 28 people to the state for possible rescue duty. Days before the storm made landfall, the Salvation Army prepared food and aid for potentially affected citizens. In anticipation for the effects of Isabel, Governor Jim McGreevey declared a state of emergency, which allowed the Federal Emergency Management Agency to deal with the situation.

The threat of the hurricane canceled some flights in and out Pennsylvania. To compensate, Delta Air Lines allowed those flying to or from Philadelphia, Allentown, and Harrisburg to reschedule to a later date. American Airlines offered a similar option. United Airlines and United Express opted to waive charging fees for travelers in and out of the state. Prior to the arrival of Isabel, Governor Ed Rendell declared a state of emergency for the state. The Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency activated a support team to assist Urban Search and Rescue operations as part of the threat from the storm. The state&#x27;s National Guard placed 2,990 guardsmen on Emergency Condition 5 status to be deployed anywhere in the state for emergency support, with other guardsmen readying equipment such as generators, heavy trucks, water trailers, and engineer equipment for deployment. State police officers were readied for deployment, while the state health department contacted hospitals to ensure generators were in working condition. The state Environmental Protection Agency prepared for the storm by monitoring the status of all dams, water treatment facilities, and nuclear plants. In addition, the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission stationed extra workers to patrol the highways in poor drainage areas, with extra equipment prepared for quick response for potential road blockage. Prior to the arrival of the storm, officials from PECO Energy prepared its largest workforce in its history with 1,500 workers, including employees from Commonwealth Edison in Illinois and Detroit Edison.

In New York, Governor George Pataki urged residents to purchase emergency supplies and to fill cars with gasoline. The State Emergency Management Office began preparing for the hurricane about a week before it moved ashore. The office also issued a Level 1 emergency activation, with a planning unit readying contingency plans and in coordinating the efforts of other state offices. The state&#x27;s National Guard began preliminary preparations for possible support efforts by reviewing the list of personnel able to be mobilized in the event of an emergency. Army and Air National Guard officials identified needed equipment in the event of an emergency, such as helicopters, generators, high-axle vehicles, and communications equipment. State police officers established contingency plans for personnel and equipment to assist as needed. The State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation ensured needed equipment were operational, and also secured buildings with sandbags to prevent flooding. 

On September 18, the Canadian Hurricane Centre issued heavy rainfall and wind warnings for portions of southern Ontario. A gale warning was also issued for Lake Ontario, eastern Lake Erie, the Saint Lawrence River and Georgian Bay. A news report on September 14 warned conditions could be similar to the disaster caused by Hurricane Hazel 49 years prior, resulting in widespread media coverage on the hurricane. Researchers on a Convair 580 flight studied the structure of Isabel transitioning into an extratropical storm, after two similar studies for Hurricane Michael in 2000 and Tropical Storm Karen in 2001. While flying in a thunderstorm, ice accumulation forced the plane to descend.

==Impact==

Strong winds from Isabel extended from North Carolina to New England and westward to West Virginia. The winds, combined with previous rainfall which moistened the soil, downed many trees and power lines across its path, leaving about 6 million electricity customers without power at some point. Parts of coastal Virginia, especially in the Hampton Roads and Northeast North Carolina areas, were without electricity for almost a month. Coastal areas suffered from waves and its powerful storm surge, with areas in eastern North Carolina and southeast Virginia reporting severe damage from both winds and the storm surge. Throughout its path, Isabel resulted in $5.5 billion in damage (2003 USD) and 51 deaths, of which 16 were directly related to the storm&#x27;s effects.

The governors of Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey, and Delaware declared states of emergency. Isabel was the first major hurricane to threaten the Mid-Atlantic States and the Upper South since Hurricane Floyd in September 1999. Isabel&#x27;s greatest effect was due to flood damage, the worst in some areas of Virginia since 1972&#x27;s Hurricane Agnes. More than 60 million people were affected to some degree—a similar number to Floyd but more than any other hurricane in recent memory.

===Caribbean and Southeast United States===

Powerful surf affected the northern coastlines of the islands in the Greater Antilles. Strong swells also lashed the Bahamas. During most hurricanes, the location of the Bahamas prevents powerful swells of Atlantic hurricanes from striking southeast Florida. However, the combination of the location, forward speed, and strength of Isabel produced strong swells through the Providence Channel onto a narrow stretch of the southeastern Florida coastline; wave heights peaked at at Delray Beach. The swells capsized a watercraft and injured its two passengers at Boynton Beach, and a swimmer required assistance to be rescued near Juno Beach. Minor beach erosion was reported in Palm Beach County. In the northern portion of the state, waves reached up to in height at Flagler Beach, causing the Flagler Beach Pier to be closed due to damaged boards from the waves. Rip currents from Isabel killed a surfer at an unguarded beach in Nassau County, with an additional six people requiring rescue from the currents. The beaches were later closed during the worst of the rough surf.

In northeastern South Carolina, the outer rainbands produced moderate winds reaching at Myrtle Beach. Rainfall was light, peaking at in Loris.

===North Carolina===

Isabel produced moderate to heavy damage across eastern North Carolina, totaling $450 million (2003 USD). Damage was heaviest in Dare County, where storm surge flooding and strong winds damaged thousands of houses. The storm surge produced a wide inlet on Hatteras Island, unofficially known as Isabel Inlet, isolating Hatteras by road for two months. Strong winds downed hundreds of trees of across the state, leaving up to 700,000 residents without power. Most areas with power outages had power restored within a few days. The hurricane directly killed one person and indirectly killed two in the state.

===Virginia===

The storm surge assailed much of southeastern Virginia causing the worst flooding seen in the area since the 1933 Chesapeake–Potomac hurricane, peaking at an estimated in Richmond along the James River. The surge caused significant damage to homes along river ways, especially along the middle reaches of the James River basin. The strong storm surge surpassed the floodgate to the Midtown Tunnel while workers attempted to close the gate; about of water flooded the tunnel entirely in just 40 minutes, with the workers barely able to escape. The damage to the electrical grid and flooding kept Old Dominion University, Norfolk State University, Virginia Commonwealth University, University of Richmond, The College of William &amp; Mary and many of the region&#x27;s other major educational institutions closed for almost a week. Further inland, heavy rainfall was reported, peaking at in Sherando, Virginia, causing damage and severe flash flooding. Winds from the hurricane destroyed over 1,000 houses and damaged 9,000 more; damage in the state totaled over $1.85 billion (2003 USD), among the costliest tropical cyclones in Virginia history. The passage of Isabel also resulted in 32 deaths in the state, 10 directly from the storm&#x27;s effects and 22 indirectly related.

===Mid-Atlantic===

About 1.24 million people lost power throughout Maryland and Washington, D.C. The worst of Isabel&#x27;s effects came from its storm surge, which inundated areas along the coast and resulted in severe beach erosion. In Eastern Maryland, hundreds of buildings were damaged or destroyed by the storm surge and related tidal flooding. The most severe flooding occurred in the southern portions of Dorchester and Somerset counties and on Kent Island in Queen Anne&#x27;s County. Thousands of houses were affected in Central Maryland, with severe storm surge flooding reported in Baltimore and Annapolis. Washington, D.C. sustained moderate damage, primarily from the winds. Throughout Maryland and Washington, damage totaled about $945 million (2003 USD), with only one direct fatality due to flooding.

The effects of the hurricane in Delaware were compounded by flooding caused by the remnants of Tropical Storm Henri days before. Moderate winds of up to in Lewes downed numerous trees, tree limbs, and power lines across the state, leaving at least 15,300 without power. Numerous low-lying areas were flooded due to high surf, strong storm surge, or run-off from flooding further inland. The passage of Hurricane Isabel resulted in $40 million in damage (2003 USD) in Delaware.
The passage of Isabel through Pennsylvania resulted in two deaths and about $160 million in damage. One person suffered from carbon monoxide poisoning, believed to be caused due to improperly ventilated generators in an area affected by the power outages. 

Moderate winds left about 1.4 million customers without power across the state as a result of trees falling into power lines, with dozens of houses and cars damaged by the trees.

Upon making landfall, Isabel produced a storm surge that tracked up the Delaware River, with a station along the river in Philadelphia reporting a storm tide of . There, the surge flooded low-lying areas along the river. The large circulation of the hurricane produced moderate winds throughout the state, with wind gusts in the southeastern portion of the state reaching in Forks Township. Philadelphia, Pennsylvania also recorded a wind gust of , which contributed to severe delays at the Philadelphia International Airport. The moderate wind gust downed thousands of trees, tree limbs, and power lines. PECO energy reported their worst power outage on record with about 572,425 customers losing electricity. The company estimated it would cost at least $20 million (2003 USD, $23 million 2008 USD) for it to install about of new cable and install about 7,600 new fuses and circuit breakers. The Metropolitan Edison power company reported 300,000 customers without power, with 500,000 Pennsylvania Power and Light customers losing electricity. Wind gusts reached in northeastern Pennsylvania, resulting in scattered reports of downed trees and power lines. Tens of thousands were left without power. A few downed trees hit cars and houses, with damage totaling about $350,000 (2003 USD, $410,000 in 2008 USD). The fallen trees also closed some roads. In the central portion of the state, the storm dropped moderate precipitation of over , while wind gusts reached at a station in Lancaster County. The combination of the wind gusts and moist grounds from previous rainfalls resulted in hundreds of downed tree limbs, primarily in Dauphin and Lancaster Counties. Lancaster County reportedly suffered the worst wind damage since Hurricane Hazel in 1954. The falling trees downed power lines and poles, causing power outages and some property damage due to the trees and poles hitting houses. One indirect fatality occurred when a motorist drove into a downed tree. Two other vehicles in Franklin County and a fire truck in York were hit and greatly damaged by trees. Downed wires set a Family Dollar on fire in Paradise Township and was believed to have started a fire in a church in Ringtown. Falling trees hit at least eleven houses, with one tree severely damaging a mobile home in Bellwood. Damage directly from the wind was generally minor, and included a house losing a chimney in Camp Hill, a carport being blown over in New Oxford, and at least four houses reporting roof or siding damage. The hurricane also damaged corn fields near Lancaster. Downed trees closed or disrupted traffic on at least 56 roads in the region, including U.S. Routes 6 and 322, as well as Interstate 83 in York County. Pittsburgh reported of precipitation from Isabel. The storm produced wind gusts of up to across the southwestern portion of the state, knocking down trees and power lines. Allegheny Energy reported 31,184 customers in the southwest portion of the state lost power, primarily in McConnellsburg, State College, and Waynesboro. 

Isabel produced a storm surge along the New Jersey coastline of up to in Cape May. Higher amounts occurred along the Delaware River, peaking in the state at in Burlington. At its closest approach, Isabel passed within about of the state, and as a result the outer rainbands produced light rainfall. Wildwood along the southeast coast reported of rain, while Lincoln Park in the northern portion of the state recorded of precipitation. The large wind field of the hurricane produced moderate winds across the state. A shoal in the Delaware Bay experienced sustained winds of with gusts to . Cape May reported tropical storm force winds with gusts to , while Newark in the northern portion of the state experienced gusts to . Hurricane Isabel produced slightly above normal tides and rough surf along the Jersey shore, killing one surfer off of Wildwood Crest. The combination of gusty winds and the heavy surf produced moderate beach erosion along much of the coastline, primarily to beaches facing southeastward. In the Delaware Bay and River area, no significant erosion was reported, though coastal flooding from the hurricane washed out a road and destroyed the deck of a house in Baypoint. In Cape May County waves eroded the beaches by up to in Ocean City and Avalon, with several cities experiencing a loss of dunes and geotubes in Whale Beach being exposed. Waves from Isabel in Atlantic County resulted in light damage, minor coastal flooding, and slight beach erosion. The beaches of southern Ocean County experienced a loss of of sand, while locations further to the north experienced only minor erosion. Most coastal areas of Monmouth County reported eroded beaches by up to , with Union Beach losing about 5,000 sq. feet (465 sq. m) of sand. Moderate wind gusts throughout the state downed hundreds of trees, tree limbs, and power lines. Over 382,000 people were without power, one of the worst power outages on record for area utilities. Downed trees and power lines closed major streets and schools in Union County. One downed tree greatly damaged a house in Middletown, and in Hudson County several trees fell onto and damaged cars. A downed tree in Englewood injured a woman when she was struck, and a woman in Independence Township was killed when a fallen tree landed on the vehicle she was driving. Strong winds from Isabel blew out the windows in an office building in East Rutherford, causing injuries to two women when they were struck. Throughout the state, damage totaled to about $50 million (2003 USD

The pressure gradient between a ridge and Isabel produced strong northeast winds of at least tropical storm force across southeastern New York. Shinnecock Inlet recorded a peak gust of . A station at LaGuardia Airport recorded a wind gust of , where airplane flights averaged a 90-minute delay. The strongest winds occurred in the outer rainbands, during which many trees, tree limbs, and power lines fell across the region. In the New York metropolitan area, moderate winds downed 640 trees and 801 tree limbs. A man driving through Great Neck Estates was critically injured when a tree limb fell onto the car. Additionally, a falling tree branch hit a man in the head, resulting in a serious head injury. In and around New York City, about 1.1 million customers were left without power, though most outages were fixed by the day after the hurricane passed through the region. Offshore of Long Beach, rough waves killed a man while bodysurfing. Further to the northwest the winds were not as severe, though in some places in the south-central portion of the state the winds downed some trees. A falling tree hit and damaged a car in Cobleskill. The winds also knocked out power to about 3,000 customers in the Schoharie and eastern Mohawk Valleys. In the northeast portion of the state, a few trees and power lines were blown down in Moriah, Westport, and Lewis. Precipitation was generally light in the state, with a few scattered locations reporting over . In Livingston County, the rainfall overflowed the reservoir, causing moderate flood damage. Initially, gasoline futures on the New York Stock Exchange rose in anticipation of a threat from the hurricane, though later dropped when the storm failed to disrupt oil refining facilities. The hurricane brought unusual birds to the western portion of the state, including petrels and shearwaters normally found in salt-water regions or over the open ocean. Most of the birds died within a few days due to the sudden change in habitat. In Cayuga County, downed power lines lit one building on fire, causing minor smoke and water damage though no injuries. Damage in the state totaled $90 million (2003 USD).

===Elsewhere===
In West Virginia, the storm produced moderate rainfall across the state that peaked at near Sugar Grove. The rainfall resulted in mudslides and flash flooding, covering several roads and washing away two bridges. The South Branch Potomac River crested at , above flood state near Springfield. The flooding broke a levee at Michael Field, and in Mineral County one school and 14 basements were flooded. In Jefferson County, two people required rescue after a car drove into floodwaters. Although sustained winds were weak in the state, wind gusts reached at Martinsburg. With the wet grounds, the wind gusts toppled thousands of trees, which fell onto homes, roads, and power lines. About 1.4 million residents across the state were left without power. Damage in the state totaled $20 million (2003 USD). No deaths were reported, and three were injured from the hurricane.

Isabel dropped light to moderate precipitation across the eastern half of Ohio, with isolated locations reporting over . Moisture from Isabel dropped light rainfall across eastern Michigan and peaked at at Mount Clemens. Additionally, Doppler weather radar estimated rainfall approached in St. Clair County. No damage was reported from Isabel in the region.

Rainfall reached in portions of western Connecticut and Massachusetts. Strong surf from Isabel caused a man to drown after losing his footing along the beach near Narragansett, Rhode Island, and being swept out to sea. Officials in Connecticut contacted a water company in Watertown and a grocer in Cheshire for donations to assist the residents affected in North Carolina. A few days after Isabel moved ashore, the officials sent a tractor trailer truck with 2,000 gallons (7570 L) of water and of ice to North Carolina. In Vermont, the strong pressure gradient produced a peak wind gust of in Pleasant Valley, causing sporadic downed trees and power lines throughout the state. In Richmond, trees fell on and damaged three trucks, and in Salisbury a falling tree damaged a car. Damage in the state totaled about $100,000 (2003 USD, $117,000 in 2008 USD). Rainfall reached in various portions of New Hampshire and Maine.

Swells from Isabel produced moderate surf along the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia, particularly in the Gulf of Maine. Isabel also produced rough surf in Lake Ontario, with waves reaching along the western portion. At Hamilton, the waves surpassed seawalls and produced spray onto coastal streets. Rainfall peaked at , which caused minor flooding and led to one traffic fatality. About 27,000 people lost power, mostly near Toronto. The strong pressure gradient between Isabel and a high pressure system over eastern Canada produced strong easterly winds across lakes Ontario and Erie. A buoy in Lake Ontario reported a peak gust of , and gusts reached as strong as at Port Colborne, Ontario.

==Aftermath==

By about a week after the passage of the hurricane, President George W. Bush declared disaster areas for 36 North Carolina counties, 77 counties and independent cities in Virginia, the entire state of Maryland, all three counties in Delaware and six West Virginia counties. The disaster declaration allocated the use of federal funds for rebuilding and providing aid in the aftermath of hurricane Isabel. By about four months after the passage of the hurricane, disaster aid totaled about $516 million (2003 USD), primarily in North Carolina and Virginia. Over 166,000 residents applied for individual assistance, with about $117 million (2003 USD) approved for residents to assist with temporary housing and home repairs. About 50,000 business owners applied for Small Business Administration loans, with about $178 million (2003 USD) approved for the assistance loans. About 40,000 people visited local disaster recovery centers, designed to provide additional information regarding the aftermath of the hurricane.

In North Carolina, hundreds of residents were stranded in Hatteras following the formation of Isabel Inlet. People who were not residents were not allowed to be on the Outer Banks for two weeks after the hurricane due to damaged road conditions. When visitors were allowed to return, many ventured to see the new inlet, despite a 1-mile (1.6-km) walk from the nearest road. Initially, long-term solutions to the Isabel Inlet such as building a bridge or a ferry system were considered, though they were ultimately canceled in favor of pumping sand and filling the inlet. Coastal geologists were opposed to the solution, stating the evolution of the Outer Banks is dependent on inlets from hurricanes. Dredging operations began on October 17, about a month after the hurricane struck. The United States Geological Survey used sand from the ferry channel to the southwest of Hatteras Island, a choice made to minimize the impact to submerged aquatic vegetation and due to the channel being filled somewhat during the hurricane. On November 22, about two months after the hurricane struck, North Carolina Highway 12 and Hatteras Island were reopened to public access. On the same day, the ferry between Hatteras and Ocracoke was reopened.

Power workers immediately began repairing the power failures by clearing tree branches and replacing fuses and circuit breakers. Peco energy restored power to 72% of the affected customers by two days after the storm, with 85% restored by two nights. By two days after the storm, Pennsylvania Power and Light restored power to about 80% of its impacted customers, with about 93% restored by two nights after the storm. By five days after Isabel, most power outages in southeastern Pennsylvania were repaired, with all outages restored by a week after the hurricane. Allegheny Power restored power to about 20% of its customers by two days after the storm. Most power outages for the company were restored by five days after the hurricane, with all power completely restored by a week after Isabel.

On September 26, President Bush declared Chester County as a disaster area following the damage of previous Henri, Isabel, and severe flooding unrelated to either tropical cyclone. Officials opened a disaster recovery center in West Chester to provide additional information to disaster victims. By a month after the declaration, 342 homeowners and business owners applied for disaster aid, totaling to around $600,000 (2003 USD).

In West Virginia, the power outages were restored within a week. Power workers throughout Canada assisted the severely affected power companies from Maryland to North Carolina. Hydro-Québec sent 25 teams to the New York City area to assist in power outages.

===Retirement===

Because of widespread property damage and extensive death toll, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name &quot;Isabel&quot; in the spring of 2004, and it will never again be used for a North Atlantic tropical cyclone. It was replaced with &quot;Ida&quot; for the 2009 season.

<text>Thomas Rocco Barbella (January 1, 1919 – May 22, 1990), better known as Rocky Graziano, was an American professional boxer and actor who held the World Middleweight title. Graziano is considered one of the greatest knockout artists in boxing history, often displaying the capacity to take his opponent out with a single punch. He was ranked 23rd on &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine list of the greatest punchers of all time. He fought many of the best middleweights of the era including Sugar Ray Robinson. He was the subject of the 1956 film, &quot;Somebody Up There Likes Me&quot;, based on his 1955 autobiography, starring Paul Newman as Graziano.

==Early life==
Graziano was the son of Ida Scinto and Nicola Barbella. The elder Barbella, nicknamed &quot;Fighting Nick Bob&quot;, was a boxer with a brief fighting record. Born in Brooklyn, New York City, Rocky later moved to an Italian enclave centered on East 10th Street, between First Avenue and Avenue A in Manhattan&#x27;s East Village. He grew up as a street fighter and learned to look after himself before he could read or write. He spent years in reform school, jail, and Catholic protectories. Barbella Sr., who got occasional work as a horseback rider, kept boxing gloves around the house and encouraged Rocky and his brothers to fight one another. When he was three years old, Barbella would make Rocky and his brother, Joe (three years his senior), fight almost every night. At age 18 Rocky won the Metropolitan A.A.U. welterweight championship. Despite the fame and money that professional fighting seemed to offer, Rocky did not want to become a serious prize fighter. He did not like the discipline of training any more than he liked the discipline of school or the Army.

Graziano heard from a couple of his friends about a tournament going on with a gold medal for the winner. He fought four matches and ended up winning the New York Metropolitan Amateur Athletic Union Boxing Competition (1939). He sold the gold medal for $15 and decided that boxing was a good way to make cash.
In 1940, just weeks into his amateur fighting career, Graziano was arrested for stealing from a school. He went to Coxsackie Correctional Facility, where he spent three weeks with boyhood friend Jake LaMotta, and then he went on to the New York City Reformatory, where he spent five months. After he got out of the reformatory, he headed back to the gym to earn money, and while there met Eddie Cocco who started his professional career. He entered the ring under the name Robert Barber. A couple of weeks later, Graziano was charged with a probation violation and sent back to reform school where he was charged with starting a minor riot. He was then sent to Rikers Island.

When Graziano got out of jail, he enlisted in the military but went AWOL after punching a captain. He escaped from Fort Dix in New Jersey and started his real boxing career under the name of &quot;Rocky Graziano.&quot; He won his first couple of bouts. After gaining popularity under the name of Graziano, he was found by the military. After his fourth bout, he was called into a manager&#x27;s office to speak with a couple of military personnel. Expecting to be prosecuted and sent back to the military or jail, he fled. He returned to the military a week later. In 1941, he turned himself in, was court-martialed and dishonorably discharged from the Army, then sent to the Federal Penitentiary (nicknamed the &quot;Big Top&quot; for its dome), founded in 1875 as a military prison (now known as USP Leavenworth). Fort Leavenworth is where Rocky Graziano started his boxing career while housed at the FCP (minimum/low) building adjacent to the main facility.

Ultimately he was pardoned and given the opportunity to fight under the Army&#x27;s aegis.

==Professional career==
 Around the time he absconded from military service, Barbella began boxing under the management of Irving Cohen, a relationship that would endure for the remainder of his professional career. Cohen arranged a debut bout and billed the young fighter under his grandfather&#x27;s surname as Rocky Graziano. Despite his notoriously lax approach to training, Graziano leveraged his untutored, brawling style and powerful punching ability to win by knockout. Cohen scheduled fights against increasingly challenging opponents with the apparent goal of overmatching Graziano to teach him the value of conditioning. He even demanded a match against Sugar Ray Robinson.

In March 1945 at Madison Square Garden in New York City Graziano scored a major upset over Billy Arnold, whose style was similar to that of Sugar Ray Robinson: he was a slick boxer with lightning-fast combinations and a knockout punch. &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine and various newspapers across the United States touted Arnold as the next Joe Louis or Sugar Ray Robinson. Arnold was a heavy favorite to defeat Graziano and to then fight for the world title. Graziano absorbed a beating in the early going, before going on to batter and knock Arnold out in the third round of the scheduled eight-round bout. Following his loss to Graziano, Arnold was never the same.

Graziano fought three middleweight title bouts against Tony Zale, losing the first before capturing then surrendering the championship.

In their first match (September 27, 1946), after flooring Graziano in the first round, Zale took a savage beating from him and was on the verge of losing the fight by TKO. However, Zale rallied and knocked him out in the sixth round to retain his title.

The rematch, a year later in Chicago (July 16, 1947), was a mirror image of their first fight. The referee almost stopped the second fight in the third round because of a severe cut over Graziano&#x27;s left eye, but Graziano&#x27;s cutman, Morris (&quot;Whitey&quot;) Bimstein, was able to stop the bleeding. Battered around the ring, his eye closed and appearing ready to lose by a knockout, Graziano rallied to knock Zale out in the sixth, earning the title.

Their last fight was held in New Jersey June 10, 1948. Zale regained his crown, winning the match by a knockout in the third round. The knockout blows consisted of a perfect combination of a right to Graziano&#x27;s body, then a left hook to his jaw, knocking him unconscious.

Graziano&#x27;s last shot at the middleweight title came against Sugar Ray Robinson in April 1952. He dropped Robinson to his knee with a right in the third round. Less than a minute later, Robinson KO&#x27;d him with a right to the jaw.

Graziano retired after losing his very next fight, a 10-round decision to Chuck Davey.

==Suspensions==
In 1946, Graziano was suspended by the New York State Athletic Commission (NYSAC) for failure to report a bribe attempt. In 1948 Graziano was suspended for &quot;running out&quot; on a scheduled December 1 bout with Ruben Shank. Abe Green, then-National Boxing Association&#x27;s President, announced that they were indefinitely suspending him in all parts of the world under NBA supervision, following similar action by the California State Athletic Commission. The suspension covered all of the American States, Great Britain, the European Boxing Federation, Cuba, Mexico, and Canada. Boxing promoter Ralph Tribuani got him a license to box in Delaware, which led to his reinstatement by both the NBA and NYSAC and Rocky&#x27;s return to the ring.

==Post-boxing career==
After his retirement from boxing, Graziano cohosted a short-lived series, &quot;The Henny and Rocky Show&quot; (1955) with famous comedian Henny Youngman. He was a semi-regular on &quot;The Martha Raye Show&quot;, as Raye&#x27;s boyfriend. He appeared as a regular on the United Artists TV series &quot;Miami Undercover&quot; for its entire run, and appeared in several series and shows, including &quot;The Pat Boone Chevy Showroom&quot;, &quot;Car 54, Where Are You?&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot;, and &quot;Naked City&quot;. He portrayed Packy, an ex-boxer, in the 1967 film &quot;Tony Rome&quot;.

In the 1960s, Graziano opened a pizza restaurant, &quot;Rocky Graziano&#x27;s Pizza Ring&quot;, on Second Avenue in Kips Bay, Manhattan, creating a modest franchise for the restaurant in the New York City area. He briefly operated a bowling alley in North Babylon, New York.

==Personal life==
Graziano married Norma Unger, of German-Jewish descent, on August 10, 1943. By all accounts, the two had a very happy marriage, and they remained together until his death from cardiopulmonary failure on May 22, 1990, in New York City at age 71. According to his biographer, Graziano remained faithful to his wife during the entirety of their marriage, something which was not particularly common among celebrities. They had two children, both of whom married and had children. Graziano&#x27;s funeral was held at St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral. He is interred at the Locust Valley Cemetery along with his wife, who died in 2009.

==Legacy==
* Graziano is a member of the International Boxing Hall of Fame.
* Graziano was named to &quot;Ring&quot; magazine&#x27;s 100 Greatest Punchers of all time.
* In 2007, Graziano was inducted into the Nassau County Sports Hall of Fame.

<text>Speicher is a municipality in the canton of Appenzell Ausserrhoden, in Switzerland.

==History==
Speicher is first mentioned in 1309 as &quot;Spicher&quot;. The name originated in the Middle Ages, during the heyday of the Abbey of Saint Gall. At that time the village church served as a granary of the monastery. The first battle of the Appenzell Wars was fought at the village of Vögelinsegg, near Speicher in 1403. A monument to the battle, a pointing Appenzell farmer with a morning star, was built in 1903 on the ridge of Vögelinsegg.

A right of way had to be blasted through the rock at Vögelinsegg to lay the track for the &quot;Trogenerbahn&quot; in 1900.

<text>Abraham Colles (23 July 1773 – 16 November 1843) was an Irish surgeon and physician who served as Professor of Anatomy, Surgery and Physiology at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI) and the President of the RCSI in 1802 and 1830. A prestigious Colles Medal &amp; Travelling Fellowship in Surgery is awarded competitively annually to an Irish surgical trainee embarking on higher specialist training abroad before returning to establish practice in Ireland.

==Life==

Descended from a Worcestershire family, some of whom had sat in Parliament, he was born to William Colles and Mary Anne Bates of Woodbroak, County Wexford. The family lived near Millmount, a townland near Kilkenny, Ireland, where his father owned and managed his inheritance which was the extensive Black Quarry that produced the famous Black Kilkenny Marble. His father died when Colles was 6, but his mother took over the management of the quarry and managed to give her children a good education. While at Kilkenny College, a flood destroyed a local physician&#x27;s house. Abraham found an anatomy book belonging to the doctor in a field and returned it to him. Sensing the young man&#x27;s interest in medicine, the physician let Abraham keep the book.

He went on to enroll in Trinity College Dublin, in 1790 and was indentured to Philip Woodroffe, studying at Dr Steevens&#x27; Hospital, The Foundlings&#x27; Hospital and the House of Industry Hospitals. He received the Licentiate Diploma of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1795. Colles went on to study medicine at Edinburgh Medical School, receiving his MD degree in 1797. Afterwards, he lived in London for a short period, working with the famous surgeon Sir Astley Cooper in his dissections of the inguinal region.
Following his return to Dublin, in 1799, he was elected to the staff at Dr Steevens&#x27; Hospital where he served for the next 42 years. In October 1803, Colles was appointed Surgeon to Cork-street 
Fever Hospital, and subsequently became Consulting Surgeon to the Rotunda, City of Dublin, and Victoria Lying-in Hospitals. He was a well-regarded surgeon and was elected as president of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI) in 1802 at the age of 28 years, subsequently also serving as president in 1830.
In 1804, he was appointed Professor of Anatomy, Physiology, and Surgery at RCSI.

In 1811, he wrote an important treatise on surgical anatomy and some terms he introduced have survived in surgical nomenclature until today. He is remembered as a skilful surgeon and for his 1814 paper &quot;On the Fracture of the Carpal Extremity of the Radius&quot;; this injury continues to be known as Colles&#x27; fracture. This paper, describing distal radial fractures, was far ahead of its time, being published decades before X-rays came into use. He also described the membranous layer of subcutaneous tissue of the perineum, which came to be known as Colles&#x27; fascia. He also extensively studied the inguinal ligament, which is sometimes called Colles&#x27; ligament. He is regarded as the first surgeon to successfully ligate the subclavian artery.

In 1837, he wrote &quot;&quot; in which he introduced the hypothesis of maternal immunity of a syphilitic infant when the mother had not shown signs of the disease. Colles&#x27; principal textbook was the two-volume Colles&#x27;s writings are important, though not voluminous. Some of his papers were collected and edited by his son, Mr. William Colles, and published in the Dublin Journal of Medical Science. &quot;,&quot; chiefly relative to the venereal disease and the use of mercury, comprise Volume XCII of the Library of the New Sydenham Society, published in 1881. They are edited and annotated by one of the most distinguished Fellows of the RCSI, Mr. Robert M&#x27;Donnell. Colles&#x27;s &quot;&quot; were edited by Simon M&#x27;Coy, and published in 1850. In tribute to his distinguished career, Professor Colles was offered a baronetcy in 1839, which he refused.

Upon his retirement as Professor of Surgery, the Members of RCSI passed a resolution which included &quot; We have also to assure you that it is the unanimous feeling of the College, that the exemplary and efficient manner in which you have filled this chair for thirty-two years, has been a principal cause of the success and consequent high character of the School of Surgery in this country.&quot;

Abraham Colles and died on 16 November 1843, from gout. He was buried in Mount Jerome Cemetery, Dublin.

==Family==
In 1807, he married Miss Sophia Cope, with whom he had six sons and five daughters. His son William followed in his footsteps, being elected to the Chair of Anatomy in the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland in 1863. Another of his sons Henry married Elizabeth Mayne, a niece of Robert James Graves. His grandson was the eminent music critic and lexicographer H. C. Colles. His granddaughter Frances married the judge Lord Ashbourne; her sister Anna married his colleague Sir Edmund Thomas Bewley.

<text>Trogen is a municipality in the canton of Appenzell Ausserrhoden in Switzerland. The town is the seat of the canton&#x27;s judicial authorities.

==History==
The first mentioning of Trogen was in 1168 (&quot;Trugin&quot;). The name Trogen refers to a number of fountains (&quot;Trögen&quot;) which is reflected in the coat of arms.

After the Appenzell Wars, the &quot;Rhode&quot; Trogen was created in 1429 which included the territories of the municipalities Oberegg as well as parts of Bühler and Gais. Trogen joined the Reformation in 1525. When Appenzell split into the half-cantons Appenzell Innerrhoden and Appenzell Ausserrhoden in 1597, it became the administrative center of Appenzell Ausserrhoden. From then on, Trogen&#x27;s territory progressively shrunk as different municipalities within built their own churches within the Rhode and thus became independent. Until 1658, the municipalities of Grub, Walzenhausen, Heiden, Wolfhalden and Lutzenberg had emerged from Trogen.

From the 16th century until the Industrial Revolution, Trogen accumulated most of its wealth through the sales of weaved and embroidered fabrics. This enrichment was driven mainly by the trade of canvases by the Zellweger-family. The Zellweger trading house was founded in the 17th century by the father of the family Conrad Zellweger-Rechsteiner and his son Conrad Zellweger-Tanner. The so-called &quot;Zellweger-Paläste&quot; (Zellweger-palaces)&quot;,&quot; which are built around the town center, &quot;Landsgemeindeplatz,&quot; of Trogen, were built by the different members and generations of the family. The buildings led to inner tensions within the Zellweger-family and partial dissolutions of business alliances, as every new building was meant to outdo the previous palaces. The last Zellweger-owned business went bankrupt in 1817, and since 1866, the &quot;Landsgemeindeplatz&quot; has remained unmodified. A renovation of the town center and the palaces was voted for in 2011 and executed from 2019 to 2021. The grammar school (&quot;Kantonsschule&quot;) that is today the only grammar school in the canton was also founded by the family in 1821.

In the beginning of the 20th century, Trogen&#x27;s main source of income was the textile industry, as 66% of its inhabitants were active in this sector. At the same time, the village began to expand its sources of income by slowly developing its health and ski resort infrastructure, which also led to the foundation of the &quot;Strassenbahn St. Gallen–Speicher–Trogen&quot; in 1900 and the inauguration of the &quot;Trogenerbahn&quot; three years later. During the interwar period from 1918 to 1939, Trogen&#x27;s number of inhabitants sank drastically. Although the economy recovered thereafter, the maximum value of inhabitants of 1850 (cf. Demographics) was since then never surpassed.

Trogen has been the home of the &quot;Kinderdorf Pestalozzi&quot; since 1946. Further, Trogen has been an &quot;Energiestadt&quot; since 2014&quot;.&quot;The label attests that the municipality is making particular efforts in climate protection such as more ecological transportation, investments in renewable energy sources and more efficient usage of energy.

<text>The 20th government of Ireland (10 March 1987 – 12 July 1989) was the government of Ireland formed after the 1987 general election to the 25th Dáil on 17 February 1987. It was a minority Fianna Fáil government which had the qualified support of Fine Gael, the main opposition party, an arrangement known as the Tallaght Strategy after a speech by its leader Alan Dukes. The national debt had doubled under the previous government. The government introduced budget cuts in all departments. The taxation system was also reformed. One of the major schemes put forward was the establishment of the International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) in Dublin. During this period the Government organised the 1,000-year anniversary of the founding of Dublin.

It lasted from its appointment until the resignation of Haughey on 29 June 1989, and continued to carry out its duties for a further 13 days until the appointment of the successor government, giving a total of .

==Nomination of Taoiseach==
The 25th Dáil first met on 10 March 1987. In the debate on the nomination of Taoiseach, leader of Fine Gael and outgoing Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald, leader of Fianna Fáil Charles Haughey, and leader of the Progressive Democrats Desmond O&#x27;Malley were each proposed. FitzGerald was defeated with 51 votes in favour to 114 against, while there was an equal number of votes of 82 cast in favour and against Haughey. The proposal was carried on the casting vote of the Ceann Comhairle. Haughey was appointed as Taoiseach by president Patrick Hillery.

==Government ministers==
After his appointment as Taoiseach by the president, Haughey proposed the members of the government and they were approved by the Dáil. They were appointed by the president on the same day.

;Changes to Departments
==Attorney General==
On 10 March 1987 John L. Murray SC was appointed by the president as Attorney General on the nomination of the Taoiseach.

==Ministers of state==
On 10 March 1987, the Government appointed Vincent Brady, Michael Smith, Joe Walsh, Séamus Brennan, Seán McCarthy and Séamus Kirk as Ministers of State on the nomination of the Taoiseach. On 12 March 1987, the Government appointed the other Ministers of State on the nomination of the Taoiseach.
==Government policy==
===Economy===

The 20th government passed three budgets through the 1987, 1988 and 1989 Finance Acts The Finance minister Ray MacSharry committed himself to bringing order to the public finances and the poor economic situation. His cutting of state spending earned him the nickname &quot;Mack the Knife&quot;.

During this time he came to be identified as Haughey&#x27;s heir apparent as Taoiseach and Fianna Fáil leader. MacSharry, however wanted to leave politics by the time he was forty-five. He was fifty and had achieved some of the highest offices in the Irish government. In 1988 MacSharry was appointed European Commissioner, ending his domestic political career.

The Minister for Industry and Commerce Albert Reynolds blocked the hostile takeover of Irish Distillers by Grand Metropolitan. The company was eventually sold to Pernod Ricard for $440 million.

===Health===
During this period major industrial action was taken by junior doctors. 1,800 doctors went on strike to protest their lack of job security and the governments cuts to the health budget.

During this period a large number of haemophiliacs contracted HIV and Hepatitis C from contaminated blood products supplied by the Blood Transfusion Service Board.

===Justice===
In 1988 the Irish Prison officers association went on strike. The government had to use 1,000 Gardaí and 300 soldiers to guard the prisons.

===Northern Ireland===

During this period the government faced serious difficulties dealing with Northern Ireland and the IRA. After the signing of the Anglo-Irish Agreement Relations improved between the Republic and Britain. However, there were tensions between the governments over the imprisonment of the Birmingham Six and the apparent shoot-to-kill policy in Northern Ireland policy of the security forces in Northern Ireland. Formal protest was made by the government following the Loughgall ambush where eight IRA members and a civilian were killed by a SAS unit.

Relations improved with the extradition of Paul Kane. His appeal to the justice minister for freedom was rejected. Kane escaped from the Maze Prison in 1983 after being convicted of firearm offences.

During this period the IRA managed to smuggle a gun into the Four Courts in an attempted prison escape.

==Constitutional amendment==
On 26 May 1987 the Tenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland was approved by referendum. This permitted the state to ratify the Single European Act.

==Dissolution and resignation==
On 25 May 1989, the president dissolved the Dáil on the advice of Haughey. The general election was held on 15 June, the same date as the European Parliament election.

The 26th Dáil first met on 26 June 1989. The Dáil did not successfully nominate anyone for the position of Taoiseach on that day, with Charles Haughey, Alan Dukes and Dick Spring being defeated. This was the first time that this occurred on the first sitting of the Dáil after a general election. Haughey resigned as Taoiseach on 29 June but under the provisions of Article 28.11 of the Constitution, the members of the government continued to carry out their duties until their successors were appointed. The 21st government of Ireland was formed on 12 July 1989 as a coalition between Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, with Charles Haughey again serving as Taoiseach.

<text>Milton is a town in Norfolk County, Massachusetts, United States, and a suburb of Boston. The population was 28,630 at the 2020 census.

Milton is located in the relatively hilly area between the Neponset River and Blue Hills, bounded by Brush Hill to the west, Milton Hill to the east, Blue Hills to the south and the Neponset River to the north. It is also bordered by Boston&#x27;s Dorchester and Mattapan neighborhoods to the north and its Hyde Park neighborhood to the west; Quincy to the east; Randolph to the south, and Canton to the west.

==History==
===Indigenous peoples===
The area now known as Milton was inhabited for more than ten thousand years prior to European colonization. The Paleoamerican archaeological site Fowl Meadows lies within the bounds of present-day Milton, with charcoal remains dated to 10,210±60 years before present in 1994, later calibrated to 12,140 years before present.

At the time of European exploration and settlement in the early 1600s, the area was inhabited by the Neponset tribe of the Massachusett, an Algonquian people, who referred to the area that would become Milton as &quot;&#x27;Unquatiquisset&quot;,&#x27; meaning &#x27;Lower Falls&#x27;, denoting the place where the rapids of the Neponset River meet Massachusetts Bay.

According to local traditions and 19th-century accounts, several Native American graves and ceremonial pits may have been uncovered during construction along Canton Avenue in Milton. These discoveries, which were reported in local newsletters and oral histories, are believed to have belonged to members of the Ponkapoag tribe, who historically inhabited the area. Graves found during roadwork were said to have been oriented east to west, potentially reflecting cultural or religious practices of the tribe. Nearby pits, possibly used for cooking or religious ceremonies, were also reported, and evidence of long-term use, such as fire-scorched rocks and charcoal, was observed.

The namesake of the Massachusett people was the indigenous name for the Great Blue Hill, &quot;Massachusett&quot; meaning &#x27;at the great hill&#x27;. The hills had a religious significance to the Massachusett, who extensively mined rhyolite to make weaponry thought to be imbued with divine strength from the sacred hills. 
Local residents have also shared anecdotal reports of finding arrowheads and other Native American artifacts in the area throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, further corroborating the area’s long-standing significance to Indigenous peoples.

The Ponkapoag tribe largely resided in the surrounding areas, including Canton and Stoughton, though some members, such as Mingo and his descendants, are recorded as having lived in Milton well into the 18th century.

===English colonization===
The area that became Milton began to be sparsely settled by English colonists in the late 1620s and early 1630s as a part of Dorchester, formally established as an organized settlement in 1640 by Puritans from England. Richard Collicott, one of the first English settlers, built a trading post near the Neponset River, and negotiated the purchase of Milton from Sachem Cutshamekin. John Eliot, an English missionary, published a Massachusett translation of the Bible in 1640, facilitating rapid conversion of indigenous inhabitants to convert to Christianity and assimilate to the ideologies and culture of the colonists. 

Many of the initial English settlers arrived during the 1650s, fleeing the aftermath of Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s deposition from power and the English Civil War.

Several early Puritan families of Milton would later become influential in the culture and politics of Massachusetts Bay Colony, these families including the Sumners, Houghtons, Hutchinsons, Stoughtons, Tuckers, Voses, Glovers, and Babcocks. The original name for the area, translated to &quot;Lower Falls&quot; was adapted as &quot;Lower Mills&quot; after the establishment of Israel Stoughton&#x27;s Grist Mill in 1634, the earliest mill in the United States. Furthermore, in 1640, English settlers began shipbuilding at Gulliver&#x27;s Creek, a tributary of the Neponset, using the innumerable quantity of Eastern white pines found in early Milton&#x27;s dense forests.

In 1662, &quot;that part of the Town of Dorchester which is situated on the south side of the Neponset River commonly called &#x27;Unquatiquisset&#x27; was incorporated as an independent town and named Milton in honor of Milton Abbey, Dorset, England.&quot; 

After incorporation, the population continued to increase during the late 17th century in the wake of King Philip’s War which had devastated much of New England. The town was unscathed by the war due to several factors including the strategic location between hills, proximity to the well fortified capital Boston and most notably, the effective decimation of the indigenous inhabitants of the area by the 1660s as a result of disease and violent encroachment by colonists and the pacification of surviving Massachusett via mass conversions to Christianity and relocation to praying towns. Those who did resist were swiftly executed or sent to the West Indies as slaves. By the 1670s, the threat of violent resistance from the Massachusett was effectively eliminated, affording the developing town comparative safety and consequent prosperity compared to other regions of New England. As a result of this, colonists fleeing the villages and towns destroyed in the war settled in the town, establishing farms and nascent industries. This wave of migration from the rest of the colony marked the settlement of several prominent families in the town. For example, Ralph Houghton, a Puritan from England who had helped establish the town of Lancaster fled to Milton with his family after Lancaster was destroyed by the indigenous Nashua people who razed the town and massacred almost every inhabitant during the war. The Houghton family would later become prominent not just in Milton, but Massachusetts as a whole. 

A powder mill established in 1674 may have been the earliest powder mill in the colonies, taking advantage of the town&#x27;s water power sites. Boston investors, seeing the potential of the town and its proximity to the city, provided the capital to develop 18th-century Milton as an industrial area, including an iron slitting mill and sawmills, and the first chocolate factory in New England (the Walter Baker Chocolate Factory) in 1764, which was converted from the old Stoughton Grist Mill. Through the efforts of Daniel Henchman the first paper mill to appear in New England was at Milton on the Neponset River in 1729. From its earliest days, Milton&#x27;s favorable location at the rapids of the Neponset River made it one of the earliest and most active industrial areas in the United States.

The Suffolk Resolves, one of the earliest attempts at negotiations by the American colonists with the British Empire were signed in Milton in 1774, and were used as a model by the drafters of the Declaration of Independence in 1776. The Suffolk Resolves House, where the Resolves were passed, still stands and it is maintained as the headquarters of the Milton Historical Society. At the time of the Resolves it was owned by Capt. Daniel Vose, a well-known businessman, and later a representative to the Provincial Congress. The house was moved to a new location at 1370 Canton Avenue in Western Milton in order to save it from demolition at its previous location in &quot;Milton Village&quot; at Lower Mills. They were the &quot;Suffolk Resolves&quot; because Milton was part of Suffolk County until 1793, when Norfolk County split off, leaving only Boston and Chelsea in Suffolk County.

Milton became an active site for important power players in colonial Massachusetts. John Hancock purchased a large hill, today called Hancock Hill, in the Blue Hills Reservation and planted orchards as well as harvested wild blueberries which grow abundantly at the summit. Two royal governors of Massachusetts, Jonathan Belcher and Thomas Hutchinson, had houses in Milton. The Governor Belcher House dates from 1777, replacing the earlier home destroyed by a fire in 1776, and it is privately owned on Governor Belcher Lane in East Milton.

Thomas Hutchinson maintained a summer estate called Unquity at the peak of Milton Hill, and during the increasingly violent revolutionary insurrections in Boston, he fled to Milton after his townhouse in the North End was burned by a mob and he was driven from the city after citizens learned he supported the suppression of Massachusetts by the British following the Boston Tea Party. Although Hutchinson&#x27;s mansion house was demolished in 1947, Governor Hutchinson&#x27;s Field, owned by the Trustees of Reservations today is a meadow on Milton Hill, with a view of the Neponset River estuary and the skyscrapers of Boston six miles (10 km) away. Both the neighboring house in which Hutchinson lived during the construction of his mansion and the barn of the estate still stand and are both privately owned. The last remnant of Unquity is the ha-ha wall, once a part of the estate&#x27;s opulent gardens. Both Governor Belcher&#x27;s house and Governor Hutchinson&#x27;s field are on the National Register of Historic Places.

===After American independence===

Following the revolution, Milton continued to be a thriving agricultural and industrial town, greatly influenced both socially and economically by the prosperity of Boston and the newly-forged American identity.

The town grew extremely wealthy in the late 18th and early 19th century with the booming China Trade and the industrialization of Massachusetts during the early Industrial Revolution. As a result, much of Boston&#x27;s elite built opulent country estates set on vast grounds throughout the idyllic hills and meadows of the town&#x27;s more rural sections. Like many other coastal American cities, high society would leave the cities for the summer, and in the case of Boston, many would move to Milton due to its rural qualities, proximity to Boston, its highly active mercantile wharf, and the families&#x27; factories in Lower Mills which allowed the tycoons to continue business in the summer months. Most of these estates were concentrated on Milton Hill, Brush Hill, and Upper Canton Avenue. Among the last remaining of these estates that is entirely intact is the W.E.C Eustis Estate at the base of the Blue Hills on Canton Avenue.

The town was also home to America&#x27;s first piano factory. Revolutionary Milton is the setting of the opening of the 1940 bestselling historical novel &quot;Oliver Wiswell&quot; by Kenneth Roberts. The Blue Hill Meteorological Observatory is located in the town, home of the nation&#x27;s oldest continuously kept meteorological records.

The Granite Railway passed from granite quarries in Quincy to the wharf of Milton on the Neponset River, beginning in 1826. It is often called the first commercial railroad in the United States, as it was the first chartered railway to evolve into a common carrier without an intervening closure. A centennial historic plaque from 1926 and an original switch frog and section of track from the railway can be found in the gardens on top of the Southeast Expressway (Interstate 93) as it passes under East Milton Square. The frog had been displayed at the Chicago World&#x27;s Fair in 1893.

East Milton Square developed as a direct result of the Granite Railway. Quincy granite was seen as of remarkably high quality, and there was an incredibly high demand for it not only in Boston but abroad. Four sheds in East Milton were used to dress the raw granite stone prior to it being brought by rail to the wharf for transfer to boats to send the stones to the Port of Boston to be sent abroad. East Milton Square was originally termed the &quot;Railway Village&quot; and a train station was located there after 1871 when the Granite Railway became a passenger line of the Old Colony Railroad. The Blue Bell Tavern, which was also a hotel, served as the headquarters of the Granite Railway and it was later named the Russell House. It was located on the site of the current United States Post Office in East Milton Square.

In 1801 Josiah Bent began a baking operation in Milton, selling &quot;water crackers&quot; or biscuits made of flour and water that would not deteriorate during long sea voyages from the Port of Boston. A crackling sound occurred during baking, hence the common American term &quot;cracker&quot;. His company later sold the original hardtack crackers used by troops during the American Civil War due to their low potential for spoil. The company, Bent&#x27;s Cookie Factory, is still located in Milton and continues to sell these items to Civil War reenactors and others. However, the original 1801 mill has been turned into residential and commercial space.

Robert Bennet Forbes, a descendant of an old Massachusetts family, was a noted China Trade merchant, sea captain, and philanthropist during the Irish Famine, supporting the large influx of Irish immigrants in Boston despite the elites&#x27; distaste for the immigrants. He built a Greek Revival mansion in 1833 at 215 Adams Street on Milton Hill, adjacent to the former site of Thomas Hutchinson&#x27;s estate. As a prominent example of Greek Revival architecture and possessing many artifacts from the China Trade period, the Captain Robert Bennet Forbes House is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is open for tours. The museum&#x27;s grounds include a log cabin replica and a collection of Lincoln memorabilia acquired by the daughter of Forbes as a result of her adoration and admiration of Abraham Lincoln.

Milton adopted restrictive zoning regulations in 1913, which were pushed by anti-immigration crusaders and proponents of eugenics. The restrictive regulations sought to prohibit the kind of housing affordable to immigrants and minorities, which would serve to keep undesirable groups out of the town. In 1937, the town adopted a more restrictive zoning regulation to prevent smaller units of housing.

During the mid to late 20th century, the character of the town changed from that of agriculture, industry, and rural retreat for the wealthy to suburban. The population of the town exploded following World War II as the suburbs of America grew rapidly. By the 1950s, many of the big estates were broken into subdivisions as the town&#x27;s residential growth continued to this day.

George Herbert Walker Bush was born at 173 Adams Street on Milton Hill on June 12, 1924. He became the 41st President of the United States, serving from 1989 to 1993, and his son would become the 43rd President. Coincidentally, Adams Street is named for the family of Presidents John Adams and John Quincy Adams, who lived on the same street just a few miles southeast in Quincy, Massachusetts. The 19th-century Victorian house where President Bush was born is now privately owned and not open to the public.

There are no official wards or neighborhoods defined in the town&#x27;s governance and community planning processes.

===Climate===
Milton, as with most of Massachusetts and New England, has a warm-summer humid continental climate with hot, humid summers, severely cold, snowy winters, mild, wet springs and chilly, brisk falls. It is also often cited as being the windiest city in the United States, with an annual average wind speed of measured at the Blue Hill Meteorological Observatory.

<text>Alexandra Palace is an entertainment and sports venue in North London, situated between Wood Green and Muswell Hill in the London Borough of Haringey. A Grade II listed building, it is built on the site of Tottenham Wood and the later Tottenham Wood Farm. Originally built by John Johnson and Alfred Meeson, it opened in 1873 but following a fire two weeks after its opening, was rebuilt by Johnson. Intended as &quot;The People&#x27;s Palace&quot; and often referred to as &quot;Ally Pally&quot;, its purpose was to serve as a public centre of recreation, education and entertainment; North London&#x27;s counterpart to the Crystal Palace in South London.

At first a private venture, in 1900, the owners planned to sell it and Alexandra Park for development. A group of neighbouring local authorities managed to acquire it. An Act of Parliament created the Alexandra Palace and Park Trust. The Act required the trustees to maintain the building and park and make them available for the free use and recreation of the public forever. The present trustee is the London Borough of Haringey, whose coat of arms shows lightning bolts depicting Alexandra Palace&#x27;s pioneering role in the development of television.

In 1935, the trustees leased part of the Palace to the BBC for use as the production and transmission centre for their new television service. In 1936, it became the home of the BBC&#x27;s first regular public television service. The broadcasting system was 405-line monochrome analogue television – the first fully electronic television system to be used in regular broadcasting. Although other facilities soon superseded it after the Second World War, Alexandra Palace continued to be used by the BBC for many years and its radio and television mast is still in use.

The original studios &#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;B&#x27; still survive in the southeast wing with their producers&#x27; galleries and are used for exhibiting original historical television equipment. The original Victorian Alexandra Palace Theatre with its stage machinery also survives and as of 2019, is back in use. The theatre and stage structure is on English Heritage&#x27;s Buildings at Risk register. Alexandra Palace became a listed building in 1996, at the instigation of the Hornsey Historical Society. A planned commercial development of the building into a mixed leisure complex including a hotel, replacement ice-skating rink, cinema, ten-pin bowling alley and exhibition centre, encountered opposition from public groups and was blocked by the High Court in 2007.

The Great Hall and West Hall are typically used for exhibitions, music concerts, and conferences, operated by the trading arm of the charitable trust that owns the building and park on behalf of the public. There is also a pub, ice rink, palm court, and a panoramic view of central London.

In 2013, Alexandra Park was declared a local nature reserve and is also a Site of Borough Importance for Nature Conservation, Grade 1.

The nearest railway stations are the Alexandra Palace with Great Northern services from Moorgate and London Underground station Wood Green on the Piccadilly line. Alexandra Palace is also served by London Buses route W3.

==History==
===19th century===
The &quot;Palace of the People&quot; was conceived by Owen Jones in 1859. The Great Northern Palace Company had been established by 1860, but was initially unable to raise financing for the construction of the Palace. Construction materials were acquired and recycled from the large 1862 International Exhibition building in South Kensington after it was demolished: the government had declined to take it over. In 1863 Alexandra Park Co. Ltd. acquired the land of Tottenham Wood Farm for conversion to a park and to build the People&#x27;s Palace, on a site that stands on a ridge more than high, part of Muswell Hill. Alexandra Park was opened to the public on 23 July 1863.

The planned building was originally named &quot;The Palace of the People&quot;; it and its park were renamed to honour the popular new Princess of Wales, Alexandra of Denmark, who had married Prince Albert Edward on 10 March 1863. The Palace of the People, or the People&#x27;s Palace, remained as alternative names. In September 1865, construction commenced but to a design by John Johnson and Alfred Meeson rather than the glass structure initially proposed by Jones.

In 1871, work started on the Edgware, Highgate and London Railway to connect the site to Highgate station. Work on both the railway and the Palace was completed in 1873 and, on 24 May of that year, Alexandra Palace and Park was opened. The structure covers some . The Palace was built by Kelk and Lucas, who also built the Royal Albert Hall in South Kensington at around the same time. Sims Reeves sang on the opening day before an audience of 102,000. Only 16 days later, Alexandra Palace was destroyed by a fire which also killed three members of staff. Only the outer walls survived; a loan exhibition of a collection of English pottery and porcelain, comprising some 4,700 items of historic and intrinsic value, was also destroyed.

The Palace was quickly rebuilt and reopened on 1 May 1875. The new Alexandra Palace contained a concert hall, art galleries, a museum, lecture hall, library, banqueting room and large theatre. The stage of the theatre incorporated machinery which enabled special effects for the pantomimes and melodramas then popular – artists could disappear, reappear and be propelled into the air. The theatre was also used for political meetings. An open-air swimming pool was constructed at the base of the hill in the surrounding park; it is long since closed and little trace remains except some reeds.

The grounds included a horse racing course with grandstand (named Alexandra Park Racecourse and nicknamed the &quot;Frying Pan&quot; and the &quot;Pan Handle&quot; because of its layout), which was London&#x27;s only racecourse from 1868 until its closure in 1970, a Japanese village, a switchback ride, a boating lake and a 9-hole pitch-and-putt golf course. Alexandra Park cricket and football clubs have also played within the grounds (in the middle of the old racecourse) since 1888. A Henry Willis organ installed in 1875, vandalised in 1918 and restored and reopened in 1929, survives. In its 1929 restored form, Willis&#x27;s masterpiece was declared by Marcel Dupré to be the finest concert organ in Europe.

===20th century===
In 1900, the owners of Alexandra Palace and Park were threatening to sell them for redevelopment, but a consortium of public-spirited men in the district, headed by Mr. Henry Burt JP, a member of the Middlesex County Council and of Hornsey District Council, at once embraced the opportunity of securing the Palace and the beautiful grounds for the people of London. A committee was formed by Burt and the consortium managed to raise enough money to purchase them just in time. By the (63 &amp; 64 Vict. c. cclix), a charitable trust was created; representatives of the purchasing local authorities became the trustees with the duty to keep both building and park &quot;available for the free use and recreation of the public forever&quot;.

In 1921 a plaque was erected at the entrance of the south terrace in honour of Burt. The Palace passed into the hands of the Greater London Council in 1967, with the proviso that it should be used entirely for charitable purposes, and their trusteeship was transferred to Haringey council in 1980.

During the First World War the park was closed; the Palace and grounds were firstly used as a refugee camp for displaced Belgians, and then later from 1915 to 1919 as an internment camp for German and Austrian civilians. The camp commandant was Lt. Col. R. S. F. Walker until his death in May 1917.

The theatre was greatly altered in the early 1920s, with the general manager, W. J. MacQueen-Pope, spending the war reparation money on refurbishing the auditorium. He abandoned the understage machinery that produced the effects necessary in Victorian melodrama; some of the machinery is preserved, and there is a project to restore some of it to working order. After these changes, the theatre was leased by Archie Pitt, then husband of Gracie Fields, who appeared in the theatre. Fields also drew an audience of 5,000 people to the hall for a charity event.
In 1935, the trustees leased part of the Palace to the BBC for use as the production and transmission centre for their new BBC Television service. The antenna was designed by Charles Samuel Franklin of the Marconi Company. The world&#x27;s first public broadcasts of (then) &quot;high-definition&quot; television were made from Alexandra Palace in November 1936, an event which is alluded to by the rays in the modern coat of arms of the London Borough of Haringey. Two competing systems, Marconi-EMI&#x27;s 405-line system and John Logie Baird&#x27;s 240-line system, were installed, each with its own broadcast studio and were transmitted on alternate weeks until the 405-line system was chosen in 1937. After the BBC leased the eastern part of the Palace the theatre was only used for props storage space.
The Palace continued as the BBC&#x27;s main transmitting centre for London until 1956, interrupted only by the Second World War when the transmitter found an alternative use jamming German bombers&#x27; navigation systems. In 1944, a German doodlebug exploded just outside the organ end of the Great Hall and the Rose Window was blown in, leaving the organ exposed to the elements. In 1947 some of the pieces of the shattered rose window were incorporated in a new design by architect E.T. Spashett during renovation of bomb-damaged public buildings by the Ministry of Works. During the 1940s and 1950s the Palace also housed a public roller-skating rink and the Alexandra Palace Roller Skating Club.

In the early 1960s, an outside broadcast was made from the top of the tower, in which the first passage of a satellite across the London sky was watched and described. It continued to be used for BBC News broadcasts until 1969, and for the Open University until 1981. The antenna mast still stands and is used for local terrestrial television transmission, local commercial radio and DAB broadcasts. The main London television transmitter is now at Crystal Palace in south London. The GLC considered a £20 million proposal in 1977 to redevelop the Alexandra Palace grounds into a multi-sport complex constructed around a shared football ground for North London clubs Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur. The 75,000-seat stadium would have required a new transit connection—either a monorail line or a branch of the Piccadilly line—and private funding. The proposal was rejected by the GLC after local opposition cited the potential for hooliganism in the area.

Early in 1980, Haringey council took over the trusteeship of Alexandra Palace from the GLC, insuring it for £31 million, intending to refurbish the building but just six months later, during Capital Radio&#x27;s Jazz Festival, a fire started under the organ and quickly spread. It destroyed half the building. Again the outer walls survived and the eastern parts, including the theatre and the BBC Television studios and aerial mast, were saved. Parts of the famous organ were destroyed, though it had been dismantled for repairs so some parts (including nearly all the pipework) were away from the building in store. Some of the damage to the Palace was repaired immediately but Haringey council overspent on the restoration, creating a £30 million deficit. It was then reopened to the public in 1988 under a new management team headed by Louis Bizat. Later the council was heavily criticised for the overspend in a report by Project Management International.

In 1991, the attorney-general stated that the overspending by the council as trustee was unlawful, and so could not be charged to the charity.&lt;ref name=&quot;independent.co.uk/1346025&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The council for some years did not accept this politically embarrassing finding and instead maintained that the charity &quot;owed&quot; the council £30 million, charged compound interest on what it termed a &quot;debt&quot; (which eventually rose to a claim of some £60 million), and to recoup it tried to offer the whole palace for sale.&lt;ref name=&quot;google/books=FOQoDAAAQBAJ&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;independent.co.uk/1348398&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

An ice rink was installed at Alexandra Palace in 1990. Primarily intended for public skating, it has also housed ice hockey teams including the Harringay Racers, the Haringey Greyhounds, the London Racers and now the Haringey Huskies, as well as a figure skating club, the Alexandra Palace Amateur Ice Skating Club.

===21st century===
In June 2004, the first performances for about 70 years took place in the theatre, first in its foyer then in July in the theatre itself. Although conditions were far from ideal, the audience was able to see the potential of this very large space – originally seating 3,000, it could not be licensed for more than a couple of hundred. It was intended that the theatre would reopen, but much costly restoration would be required first. It will never again reach a seating capacity of 3,000 (not least because one balcony was removed in the early part of the 20th century as a fire precaution, when films started to be shown there). A major season of the theatre company Complicité was planned for 2005 but the project, which would have included some repair and access work, was cancelled due to higher-than-anticipated costs.

Plans by the current trustees, Haringey Council, to replace all the charitable uses by commercial ones by a commercial lease of the entire building, including a casino, encountered considerable public and legal opposition, and on 5 October 2007, in the High Court, Mr. Justice Sullivan granted an application by Jacob O&#x27;Callaghan, a London resident, to quash the Charity Commission&#x27;s order authorising a 125-year lease of the entire building to Firoka Ltd.

In September 2009, Alexandra Palace main hall was allowed 2,000 more occupation, up to 10,250 (&quot;still saddled by a £37 million debt it owes its guardian, Haringey Council&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;thetottenhamindependent.co.uk/4591297&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

A masterplan for the future of the site was drawn up in 2012, comprising six &#x27;big ideas&#x27; to restore and redevelop the Palace. The first of these to be implemented aims to transform the derelict eastern end of the Palace, making accessible the Victorian theatre and historic BBC Studios. In 2013 the Heritage Lottery Fund awarded a Round 1 pass to develop the proposals, creating a new entrance in the restored East Court, re-establishing the theatre as a flexible performance space and re-opening the BBC Studios as a visitor attraction. There was controversy regarding plans to demolish the brick infills in the colonnade on the south-east face of the building, which the BBC constructed after 1936 to form their television studios within. Following a public consultation and advice from English Heritage, Planning and Listed Building Consent was given for the proposals and in March 2015 HLF awarded Round 2 major grant funding securing a positive future for the historic areas.

In 2018, Feilden Clegg Bradley Studios made a £27m refurbishment of the long-abandoned Alexandra Palace theatre and east wing.&lt;ref name=&quot;thespaces/restored-alexandra-palace-theatre&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dezeen/alexandra-renovation-studios&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;theguardian/alexandra-reopen&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, it was announced that the Theatre would open for a BBC Proms performance on 1 September before officially reopening to the public on 1 December 2018 following the completion of the East Wing Restoration Project by the contractor Willmott Dixon. The opening programme included performances from Dylan Moran, Horrible Histories, Gilbert &amp; George, Gareth Malone and an evening of jazz presented by Ronnie Scott&#x27;s.

During the coronavirus pandemic, Alexandra Palace was used as a food distribution hub by &quot;Edible London&quot; for local residents.

<text>Michael, also called Saint Michael the Archangel, Archangel Michael and Saint Michael the [[Taxiarch]] is an archangel in Christianity, Judaism, Islam, and the Baháʼí Faith. The earliest surviving mentions of his name are in third- and second-century BC Jewish works, often but not always apocalyptic, where he is the chief of the angels and archangels, and he is the guardian prince of Israel and is responsible for the care of the people of Israel. Christianity conserved nearly all the Jewish traditions concerning him, and he is mentioned explicitly in Revelation 12:7–12, where he does battle with Satan, and in the Epistle of Jude, where the archangel and the devil dispute over the body of Moses.

== Old Testament and Apocrypha==
The Book of Enoch lists him as one of seven archangels (the remaining names are Uriel, Raguel, Raphael, Sariel, Gabriel, and Remiel), who, in the Book of Tobit, “stand ready and enter before the glory of the Lᴏʀᴅ”. The fact that Michael is introduced implies the knowledge of him and the other named angels. He is mentioned again in last chapters of the Book of Daniel, a Jewish apocalypse composed in the second century BCE although set in the sixth, in which a man clothed in linen (never identified, but probably the archangel Gabriel) tells Daniel that he and “Michael, your prince” are engaged in a battle with the “prince of Persia”, after which, at the end-time, “Michael, the great prince who protects your people, will arise”.

Enoch was instrumental in establishing the pre-eminent place of Michael among the angels or archangels, and in later Jewish works, he is said to be their chief, mediating the Torah (the Law of God), and standing at the right hand of the throne of God. In the traditions of the Qumran community, he defends or leads the people of God in the eschatological (i.e., end-time) battle. And in other writings, he is responsible for the care of Israel (and he may be the “one like a son of man” mentioned in Daniel 7:13–14) and the commander of the heavenly armies; he is Israel&#x27;s advocate contesting Satan&#x27;s claim to the body of Moses; he intercedes between God and humanity and serves as High Priest in the heavenly sanctuary; and he accompanies the souls of the righteous dead to Paradise.

== New Testament ==
The seven archangels (or four, as traditions differ but always include Michael) were associated with the branches of the menorah, the sacred seven-branched lampstand in the Temple as the seven spirits before the throne of God, and this is reflected in the Book of Revelation 4:5 (“From the throne came flashes of lightning, and rumblings and peals of thunder, and before the throne were burning seven torches of fire, which are the seven spirits of God” – ESV). Michael is mentioned explicitly in Revelation 12:7–12, where he does battle with Satan and casts him out of heaven so that he no longer has access to God as accuser (his formal role in the Old Testament). The fall of Satan at the coming of Jesus marks the separation of the New Testament from Judaism. In Luke 22:31, Jesus tells Peter that Satan has asked God for permission to “sift” the disciples, the goal being to accuse them, but the accusation is opposed by Jesus, who thus takes on the role played by angels, and especially by Michael, in Judaism.

Michael is mentioned by name for the second time in the Epistle of Jude, which is an impassioned plea for the believers to engage in battle against the incursion of the error. In verses 9–10, the author denounces the heretics by contrasting them with the archangel Michael, who, in disputing with Satan over the body of Moses, “did not presume to pronounce the verdict of &#x27;slander&#x27; but said, &#x27;The Lᴏʀᴅ punish you!&#x27;”

==Judaism==

According to rabbinic tradition, Michael acted as the advocate of Israel, and sometimes had to fight with the princes of the other nations (Daniel 10:13) and particularly with the angel Samael, Israel&#x27;s accuser. Their enmity dates from the time Samael was thrown from heaven and tried to drag Michael down with him, necessitating God&#x27;s intervention.

The idea that Michael was the advocate of the Jews became so prevalent that in spite of the rabbinical prohibition against appealing to angels as intermediaries between God and his people, he held a place in the Jewish liturgy: &quot;When a man is in need he must pray directly to God, and neither to Michael nor to Gabriel.&quot; Jeremiah addresses a prayer to him.

The rabbis declare that Michael entered into his role of defender at the time of the biblical patriarchs. Rabbi Eliezer ben Jacob said he rescued Abraham from the furnace into which he had been thrown by Nimrod (Midrash Genesis Rabbah xliv. 16). Some say he was the &quot;one that had escaped&quot; (Genesis ), who told Abraham that Lot had been taken captive (Midrash Pirke R. El.), and who protected Sarah from defilement by Abimelech.

Michael prevented Isaac from sacrifice by his father by substituting a ram in his place. He saved Jacob, while yet in his mother&#x27;s womb, from death by Samael. He later prevented Laban from harming Jacob.(&quot;Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer&quot;, xxxvi).

The midrash &quot;Exodus Rabbah&quot; holds that Michael exercised his function of advocate of Israel at the time of the Exodus and destroyed Sennacherib&#x27;s army.
==Christianity==
===Early Christian views and devotions===

Michael was venerated as a healer in Phrygia (modern-day Turkey).

The earliest and most famous sanctuary to Michael in the ancient Near East was the &quot;Michaelion,&quot; also associated with healing waters. It was built in the early fourth century by Constantine the Great at Chalcedon, on the site of an earlier temple called &quot;Sosthenion&quot;.

Epiphanius of Salamis (c. 310–320 – 403) in his Coptic-Arabic &quot;Hexaemeron&quot; referred to Michael as a replacement of Satan. Accordingly, after Satan fell, Michael was appointed to the function Satan served when he was still one of the noble angels.

A painting of the Archangel slaying a serpent became a major art piece at the &quot;Michaelion&quot; after Constantine defeated Licinius near there in 324. This contributed to the standard iconography that developed of the Archangel Michael as a warrior saint slaying a dragon. The Michaelion was a magnificent church and in time became a model for hundreds of other churches in Eastern Christianity; these spread devotions to the Archangel.

In the fourth century, Saint Basil the Great&#x27;s homily (&quot;De Angelis&quot;) placed Saint Michael over all the angels. He was called &quot;Archangel&quot; because he heralds other angels, the title Ἀρχαγγέλος (&quot;archangelos&quot;) applied to him in Jude 1:9. Into the sixth century, the view of Michael as a healer continued in Rome; after a plague, the sick slept at night in the church of &quot;Castel Sant&#x27;Angelo&quot; (dedicated to him for saving Rome), waiting for his manifestation.

In the sixth century, the growth of devotions to Michael in the Western Church was expressed by the feasts dedicated to him, as recorded in the Leonine Sacramentary. The seventh-century Gelasian Sacramentary included the feast &quot;S. Michaelis Archangeli&quot;, as did the eighth-century Gregorian Sacramentary. Some of these documents refer to a &quot;Basilica Archangeli&quot; (no longer extant) on via Salaria in Rome.

The angelology of Pseudo-Dionysius, which was widely read as of the sixth century, gave Michael a rank in the hierarchy of angels. Later, in the thirteenth century, others such as Bonaventure believed him to be Prince of the Seraphim, the first of the nine angelic orders. According to Thomas Aquinas (&quot;Summa&quot; Ia. 113.3), he is Prince of the last and lowest choir, the Angels.

===Catholicism===

Catholics often refer to Michael as “Holy Michael, the Archangel” or “Saint Michael”. He is generally referred to in Christian litanies as “Saint Michael”, as in the Litany of the Saints. In the shortened version said at the Easter Vigil, he alone of the angels and archangels is mentioned by name, omitting Saints Gabriel and Raphael.

In Roman Catholic teachings, Saint Michael has four main roles or offices. His first role is the leader of the Army of God and the leader of celestial forces in triumphing over the powers of Hell. He is viewed as the angelic model for the virtues of the “spiritual warrior”, his conflict with evil taken as “the battle within”.

The second and third roles of Michael in Catholic teachings deal with death. In his second role, he is the angel of death, carrying the souls of Christians to Heaven. Catholic prayers often refer to this role of Michael. In his third role, he weighs souls on his perfectly balanced scales, a common object he holds in art.

In his fourth role, Saint Michael, the special patron of the Chosen People in the Old Testament, is also Guardian of the Church. Saint Michael was revered by the military orders of knights during the Middle Ages. The names of villages around the Bay of Biscay reflect that history. Moreover, doubtless for the same motive he was considered the patron saint of a number of cities and countries.

Catholic tradition includes also elements such as the &quot;Prayer to Saint Michael&quot;, which specifically asks the saint to “defend” the faithful from evil. The &quot;Chaplet of Saint Michael&quot; consists of nine salutations, one for each choir of angels.

====Saint Michael the Archangel prayer====


===Eastern and Oriental Orthodoxy===
The Eastern Orthodox accord Michael the title &quot;Archistrategos&quot;, or “Supreme Commander of the Heavenly Hosts”. The Eastern Orthodox pray to their guardian angels and above all, to Michael and Gabriel.

The Eastern Orthodox have always had strong devotions to angels. In contemporary times, they are referred to by the term of “Bodiless Powers”. A number of feasts dedicated to Archangel Michael are celebrated by the Eastern Orthodox throughout the year.

Archangel Michael is mentioned in a number of Eastern Orthodox hymns and prayer, and his icons are widely used within Eastern Orthodox churches. In many Eastern Orthodox icons, Christ is accompanied by a number of angels, Michael being a predominant figure among them.

In Russia, many monasteries, cathedrals, court and merchant churches are dedicated to the Chief Commander Michael; most Russian cities have a church or chapel dedicated to the Archangel Michael.

In Ukraine, the Archangel Michael is the patron saint of the capital city, Kyiv. He became popular since the time of Prince Vsevolod of Kievan Rus&#x27;.

While in the Serbian Orthodox Church Saint Sava has a special role as the establisher of its autocephaly and the largest Belgrade church is devoted to him, the capital Belgrade&#x27;s Orthodox cathedral, the see church of the patriarch, is devoted to Archangel Michael (in Serbian: &quot;Арханђел Михаило&quot; / &quot;Arhanđel Mihailo&quot;).

The place of Michael in the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria is as a saintly intercessor. He is the one who presents to God the prayers of the just, who accompanies the souls of the dead to heaven, who defeats the devil. He is celebrated liturgically on the 12th of each Coptic month. In Alexandria, a church was dedicated to him in the early fourth century on the 12th of the month of Paoni. The 12th of the month of Hathor is the celebration of Michael&#x27;s appointment in heaven, where Michael became the chief of the angels.

===Protestantism===
Protestants recognize Michael as an archangel. The Anglican and Methodist traditions recognize four archangels: Michael, Raphael, Gabriel, and Uriel. The controversial Anglican bishop Robert Clayton (d. 1758) proposed that Michael was the Logos and Gabriel the Holy Spirit. Controversy over Clayton&#x27;s views led the government to order his prosecution, but he died before his scheduled examination.

The Lutheran Churches of St. Michael&#x27;s Church, Hamburg and St. Michael&#x27;s Church, Hildesheim are named for Michael. In Bach&#x27;s time, the annual feast of Michael and All the Angels on 29 September was regularly celebrated with a festive service in Lutheran churches, for which Bach composed several cantatas, for example the chorale cantata &quot;Herr Gott, dich loben alle wir, BWV 130&quot; in 1724, &quot;Es erhub sich ein Streit&quot;, BWV 19, in 1726 and &quot;Man singet mit Freuden vom Sieg&quot;, BWV 149, in 1728 or 1729.

Many Protestant theologians identify a relationship, (e.g. typological or identical), between Michael with Christ, including:

Martin Luther Ernst Wilhelm Hengstenberg, Andrew Willet Herman Witsius W. L. Alexander, Jacobus Ode, Campegius Vitringa, Philip Melanchthon, Hugh Broughton, Franciscus Junius, Hävernick Amandus Polanus, Johannes Oecolampadius, Samuel Horsely, William Kincaid John Calvin Isaac Watts, John Brown, and James Wood.

Charles Spurgeon once stated that Jesus is &quot;the true Michael&quot; and &quot;the only Archangel&quot;.

John Gill comments on Jude 9, &quot;&#x27;Yet Michael the archangel ...&#x27; By whom is meant, not a created angel, but an eternal one, the Lord Jesus Christ ...&quot;

===Restorationism===
====Seventh-day Adventists====

Seventh-day Adventists believe that &quot;Michael&quot; is but one of the many titles applied to the pre-existent Christ, or Son of God. According to Adventists, such a view does not in any way conflict with the belief in the full deity and eternal preexistence of Jesus Christ, nor does it in the least disparage his person and work. According to Adventist theology, Michael was considered the &quot;eternal Word&quot;, and the one by whom all things were created. The Word was then born incarnate as Jesus.

They believe that name &quot;Michael&quot; signifies &quot;One Who Is Like God&quot; and that as the &quot;Archangel&quot; or &quot;chief or head of the angels&quot; he led the angels and thus the statement in identifies/refers to Jesus as Michael.

====Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses====

Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses believe Michael to be another name for Jesus in heaven, in his pre-human and post-resurrection existence. They say the definite article at Jude 9—referring to &quot;Michael the archangel&quot;—identifies Michael as the only archangel. They consider Michael to be synonymous with Christ, described at 1 Thessalonians 4:16 as descending &quot;with a cry of command, with the voice of an archangel, and with the sound of the trumpet&quot;.

They believe the prominent roles assigned to Michael at Daniel 12:1, Revelation 12:7, Revelation 19:14, and Revelation 16 are identical to Jesus&#x27; roles, being the one chosen to lead God&#x27;s people and as the only one who &quot;stands up&quot;, identifying the two as the same spirit being. Because they identify Michael with Jesus, he is therefore considered the first and greatest of all God&#x27;s heavenly sons, God&#x27;s chief messenger, who takes the lead in vindicating God&#x27;s sovereignty, sanctifying his name, fighting the wicked forces of Satan and protecting God&#x27;s covenant people on earth. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses also identify Michael with the &quot;Angel of the Lord&quot; who led and protected the Israelites in the wilderness. Their earliest teachings stated that Archangel Michael was not to be worshipped.
====The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints====

Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints believe that Michael is Adam, the Ancient of Days (Dan. 7), a prince, and the patriarch of the human family. They also hold that Michael assisted Jehovah (the pre-mortal form of Jesus) in the creation of the world under the direction of God the Father (Elohim); under the direction of the Father, Michael also cast Satan out of heaven.

==Islam==
In Islam, Michael, or Mīkāʾīl, is the angel said to effectuate God&#x27;s providence as well as natural phenomena, such as rain. He is one of the four archangels along with Jibril (Gabriel, whom he is often paired with), ʾIsrāfīl (trumpeter angel) and ʿAzrāʾīl (angel of death).

Michael in Islam is said to be friendly, asking God for mercy toward humans and is, according to Muslim legends, one of the first to obey God&#x27;s orders to bow before Adam. From the tears of Michael, angels are created as his helpers.

Consensus of Islamic scholars and clerics has enclosed various hadiths as interpretation material for the verse of that Gabriel, Michael, Raphael and thousands of best angels from third level of sky, all came to the battle of Badr. Various hadith traditions linked to the , has stated that those angels has taken form of Zubayr ibn al-Awwam, companion of Muhammad.

In a version of a hadith by an-Nasāʾi, Muhammad is quoted as saying that Gabriel and Michael came to him, and when Gabriel had sat down at his right and Michael at his left, Gabriel told him to recite the Qurʾān in one mode, and Michael told him to ask more, till he reached seven modes, each mode being sufficiently health-giving. According to another hadith in Sahih Muslim, Michael, along with Gabriel both dressed in white, were reported to have accompanied Muhammad on the day of the Battle of Uhud. Safiur Rahman Mubarakpuri has recorded in his historiography works of Quran and Hadith revelation in Prophetic biography, that Sa&#x27;d ibn Abi Waqqas testified has saw Jibril and Mikail during that battle.

In Shia Islam, in Dua Umm Dawood, a supplication reportedly handed down by the 6th Imam Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq, the reciter sends blessing upon Michael (with his name spelled as Mīkā&#x27;īl):

O Allah! Bestow your blessing on Michael-angel of Your mercy and created for kindness and seeker of pardon for and supporter of the obedient people.

In the creation narrative of Adam he was sent to bring a handful of earth, but the Earth did not yield a piece of itself, some of which will burn. This is articulated by Al-Tha&#x27;labi, whose narrative states that God tells Earth that some will obey him and others will not.

Michael is called Mika&#x27;il or Mikha&#x27;il in Muslim works generally, but in the one instance in which he is mentioned in the Quran he is called Mīkāl. The single Quranic mention comes in the QS 2:98, when the Jews of Medina challenged Muhammed to tell them the name of the angel (malaika = creature with a knowledge) from whom he received his revelations; when he told them it was Gabriel, the Jews said that Gabriel was their enemy, and that revelations came from Michael. The hadith (sayings of and about the Prophet collected by his followers) quote Muhammed mentioning both Gabriel and Michael as two angels who showed him Paradise and hell, and in the early years of Islam the Muslims recited the names of both in the obligatory daily prayers (the salat). The place of Michael, and some of the other archangels, is not clearly identified in the major sources, and among ordinary Muslims knowledge of them is drawn from non-Islamic sources, notably Jewish.

==Baháʼí Faith==
The archangel Michael seems to have never been mentioned publicly by Baha&#x27;u&#x27;llah, &#x27;Abdu&#x27;l-Baha, Shoghi Effendi, or even the Universal House of Justice. Baháʼí publications interpreting the Book of Revelation from the New Testament say Baha&#x27;u&#x27;llah was a chief prince of Persia foretold as Michael who would win &quot;final victory over the dragon&quot;. Or, Michael, &quot;One like God&quot;, is thought to be Baha&#x27;u&#x27;llah, as archangel Michael is thought to be an emanation of Hod or &quot;glory&quot; in Jewish Mysticism – because &quot;Baha&#x27;u&#x27;llah&quot; means splendor or glory of God.

==Gnosticism==
In the Secret Book of John, a second-century text found in the Nag Hammadi codices of Gnosticism, Michael is placed in control of the demons who help Yaldabaoth create Adam, along with six others named Uriel, Asmenedas, Saphasatoel, Aarmouriam, Richram, and Amiorps. According to Origen of Alexandria in his work Against Celsus, Michael was represented as a lion on the Ophite Diagram.

==Feasts==
In the General Roman Calendar, the Anglican Calendar of Saints, and the Lutheran Calendar of Saints, the archangel&#x27;s feast is celebrated on Michaelmas Day, 29 September. The day is also considered the feast of Saints Michael, Gabriel, and Raphael, in the General Roman Calendar and the Feast of Saint Michael and All Angels according to the Church of England.

In the Eastern Orthodox Church, Saint Michael&#x27;s principal feast day is 8 November (those that use the Julian calendar celebrate it on what in the Gregorian calendar is now 21 November), honouring him along with the rest of the &quot;Bodiless Powers of Heaven&quot; (i.e. angels) as their Supreme Commander (Synaxis of the Archangel Michael and the Other Bodiless Powers), and the &quot;Miracle at Chonae&quot; is commemorated on 6 September.

In the calendar of the Church of England diocese of Truro, 8 May is the feast of &quot;St. Michael, Protector of Cornwall&quot;. The archangel Michael is one of the three patron saints of Cornwall. The feast of the Appearing of S. Michael the Archangel is observed by Anglo-Catholics on 8 May. From medieval times until 1960 it was also observed on that day in the Roman Catholic Church; the feast commemorates the archangel&#x27;s apparition on Mount Gargano in Italy.

In the Coptic Orthodox Church, the main feast day in 12 Hathor and 12 Paoni, and he is celebrated liturgically on the 12th of each Coptic month.

On 7 April, the Oriental Orthodox Church commemorates the deliverance of prophet Jeremiah from prison by Michael.

==Patronages and orders==

In late medieval Christianity, Michael, together with Saint George, became the patron saint of chivalry and is now also considered the patron saint of police officers, paramedics and the military.

Since the victorious Battle of Lechfeld against the Hungarians in 955, Michael was the patron saint of the Holy Roman Empire and still is the patron saint of modern Germany and other German-speaking regions formerly covered by the realm.

In mid- to late fifteenth century, France was one of only four courts in Western Christendom without an order of knighthood. Later in the fifteenth century, Jean Molinet glorified the primordial feat of arms of the archangel as &quot;the first deed of knighthood and chivalrous prowess that was ever achieved.&quot; Thus Michael was the natural patron of the first chivalric order of France, the Order of Saint Michael of 1469. In the British honours system, a chivalric order founded in 1818 is also named for these two saints, the Order of St Michael and St George (&quot;see also&quot;: Order of Saint Michael).

Prior to 1878, the Scapular of St. Michael the Archangel could be worn as part of a Roman Catholic Archconfraternity. Presently, enrollment is authorized as this holy scapular remains as one of the 18 approved by the Church.

Apart from his being a patron of warriors, the sick and the suffering also consider Archangel Michael their patron saint. Based on the legend of his eighth-century apparition at Mont Saint-Michel, France, the Archangel is the patron of mariners in this famous sanctuary. After the evangelisation of Germany, where mountains were often dedicated to pagan gods, Christians placed many mountains under the patronage of the Archangel, and numerous mountain chapels of St. Michael appeared all over Germany.

Similarly, the Sanctuary of St. Michel (San Migel Aralarkoa), the oldest Christian building in Navarre (Spain), lies at the top of a hill on the Aralar Range, and harbours Carolingian remains. St. Michel is an ancient devotion of Navarre and eastern Gipuzkoa, revered by the Basques, shrouded in legend, and held as a champion against paganism and heresy. It came to symbolize the defense of Catholicism, as well as Basque tradition and values during the early twentieth century.He has been the patron saint of Brussels since the Middle Ages. The city of Arkhangelsk in Russia is named for the Archangel. Ukraine and its capital Kyiv also consider Michael their patron saint and protector. 
In Linlithgow, Scotland, St. Michael has been the patron saint of the town since the thirteenth century, with St. Michael&#x27;s Parish Church being originally constructed in 1134. 
Since the fourteenth century, Saint Michael has been the patron saint of Dumfries in Scotland, where a church dedicated to him was built at the southern end of the town, on a mound overlooking the River Nith.

An Anglican sisterhood dedicated to Saint Michael under the title of the Community of St Michael and All Angels was founded in 1851. The Congregation of Saint Michael the Archangel (CSMA), also known as the &quot;Michaelite Fathers&quot;, is a religious order of the Roman Catholic Church founded in 1897. The Canons Regular of the Order of St Michael the Archangel (OSM) are an Order of professed religious within the Anglican Church in North America, the North American component of the Anglican realignment movement.

The city of Arkhangelsk, Russia, and the federal subject Arkhangelsk Oblast are named after Michael the Archangel.

In the United States military, Saint Michael is considered to be a patron of paratroopers and, in particular, the 82nd Airborne Division. One of the first battles where the unit first was combat christened is the Battle of Saint-Mihiel during World War I.

The beret insignia of the French paratroopers is a winged arm grasping a dagger, representing Saint Michael.
Saint Michael is the patronus of Italian special forces 9° Reggimento &quot;Col Moschin&quot; and the Italian state police. Saint Michael () is patron of Croatian Police and Croatian Army, his feast day being also celebrated as the Police day in Croatia.

==Legends==

===Judaism===
There is a legend which seems to be of Jewish origin, and which was adopted by the Copts, to the effect that Michael was first sent by God to bring Nebuchadnezzar (c. 600 BC) against Jerusalem, and that Michael was afterward very active in freeing his nation from Babylonian captivity.
According to midrash Genesis Rabbah, Michael saved Hananiah and his companions from the fiery furnace. Michael was active in the time of Esther: &quot;The more Haman accused Israel on earth, the more Michael defended Israel in heaven&quot;. It was Michael who reminded Ahasuerus that he was Mordecai&#x27;s debtor; and there is a legend that Michael appeared to the high priest Hyrcanus, promising him assistance.

According to &quot;Legends of the Jews&quot;, archangel Michael was the chief of a band of angels who questioned God&#x27;s decision to create man on Earth. The entire band of angels, except for Michael, was then consumed by fire.

===Christianity===
The Eastern Orthodox Church celebrates the Miracle at Chonae on September 6. The pious legend surrounding the event states that John the Apostle, when preaching nearby, foretold the appearance of Michael at Cheretopa near Lake Salda, where a healing spring appeared soon after the Apostle left; in gratitude for the healing of his daughter, one pilgrim built a church on the site. Local pagans, who are described as jealous of the healing power of the spring and the church, attempt to drown the church by redirecting the river, but the Archangel, &quot;in the likeness of a column of fire&quot;, split the bedrock to open up a new bed for the stream, directing the flow away from the church. The legend is supposed to have predated the actual events, but the fifth- to seventh-century texts that refer to the miracle at Chonae formed the basis of specific paradigms for &quot;properly approaching&quot; angelic intermediaries for more effective prayers within the Christian culture.

 in Cornwall, England, that the Archangel appeared to fishermen on St Michael&#x27;s Mount. According to author Richard Freeman Johnson, this legend is likely a nationalistic twist to a myth. Cornish legends also hold that the mount itself was constructed by giants and that King Arthur battled a giant there.

The legend of the apparition of the Archangel at around AD 490 at a secluded hilltop cave on Monte Gargano in Italy gained a following among the Lombards in the immediate period thereafter, and by the eighth century, pilgrims arrived from as far away as England. The Tridentine calendar included a feast of the apparition on 8 May, the date of the 663 victory over the Greek Neapolitans that the Lombards of Manfredonia attributed to Saint Michael. The feast remained in the Roman liturgical calendar until removed in the revision of Pope John XXIII. The Sanctuary of Monte Sant&#x27;Angelo at Gargano is a major Catholic pilgrimage site.

According to Roman legends, Archangel Michael appeared with a sword over the mausoleum of Hadrian while a devastating plague persisted in Rome, in apparent answer to the prayers of Pope Gregory I the Great (c. 590–604) that the plague should cease. After the plague ended, in honor of the occasion, the pope called the mausoleum &quot;Castel Sant&#x27;Angelo&quot; (Castle of the Holy Angel), the name by which it is still known.

According to Norman legend, Michael is said to have appeared to St Aubert, Bishop of Avranches, in 708, giving instruction to build a church on the rocky islet now known as Mont Saint-Michel. In 960 the Duke of Normandy commissioned a Benedictine abbey on the mount, and it remains a major pilgrimage site.

A Portuguese Carmelite nun, Antónia d&#x27;Astónaco, reported an apparition and private revelation of the Archangel Michael who had told to this devoted Servant of God, in 1751, that he would like to be honored, and God glorified, by the praying of nine special invocations. These nine invocations correspond to invocations to the nine choirs of angels and origins the famous Chaplet of Saint Michael. This private revelation and prayers were approved by Pope Pius IX in 1851.

From 1961 to 1965, four young schoolgirls had reported several apparitions of the Archangel Michael in the small village of Garabandal, Spain. At Garabandal, the apparitions of the Archangel Michael were mainly reported as announcing the arrivals of the Virgin Mary. The Catholic Church has neither approved nor condemned the Garabandal apparitions.

==In literature, music, and art==

===Literature===
In the 1667 English epic poem &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; by John Milton, Michael commands the army of angels loyal to God against the rebel forces of Satan. Armed with a sword from God&#x27;s armory, he bests Satan in personal combat, wounding his side.

In Henry Wadsworth Longfellow&#x27;s translation of the mid-thirteenth century &quot;The Golden Legend&quot;, Michael is one of the angels of the seven planets. He is the angel of Mercury.

===Music===
Marc-Antoine Charpentier, &quot;Praelium Michaelis Archangeli factum in coelo cum dracone&quot;, H.410, oratorio for soloists, double chorus, strings and continuo (1683).

===Artistic depictions===

In Christian art, Archangel Michael may be depicted alone or with other angels such as Gabriel. Some depictions with Gabriel date back to the eighth century, e.g. the stone casket at Notre Dame de Mortain church in France.

The widely reproduced image of &quot;Our Mother of Perpetual Help&quot;, an icon of the Cretan school, depicts Michael on the left carrying the lance and sponge of the crucifixion of Jesus, with Gabriel on the right side of Mary and Jesus.

In many depictions, Michael is represented as an angelic warrior, fully armed with helmet, sword, and shield. The shield may bear the Latin inscription &quot;Quis ut Deus&quot; or the Greek inscription &quot;Christos Dikaios Krites&quot; or its initials. He may be standing over a serpent, a dragon, or the defeated figure of Satan, whom he sometimes pierces with a lance. The iconography of Michael slaying a serpent goes back to the early fourth century, when Emperor Constantine defeated Licinius at the Battle of Adrianople in AD 324, not far from the &quot;Michaelion&quot;, a church dedicated to Archangel Michael.

Constantine felt that Licinius was an agent of Satan and associated him with the serpent described in the Book of Revelation (). After the victory, Constantine commissioned a depiction of himself and his sons slaying Licinius represented as a serpent a symbolism borrowed from the Christian teachings on the Archangel to whom he attributed the victory. A similar painting, this time with the Archangel Michael himself slaying a serpent, then became a major art piece at the Michaelion and eventually lead to the standard iconography of the Archangel Michael as a warrior saint.

In less common depiction, Michael holds a pair of scales, weighs the souls of the departed and holds the book of life (as in the Book of Revelation) to show he partakes in the judgment. Michelangelo depicted this scene on the altar wall of the Sistine Chapel.

In Byzantine art, Michael was often shown as a princely court dignitary rather than a warrior who battled Satan or with scales for weighing souls on the Day of Judgement.

<doc id="318642" wikidata="Q1547759" url="?curid=318642" title="Lord Steward">
<text>The Lord Steward or Lord Steward of the Household is one of the three Great Officers of the Household of the British monarch. He is, by tradition, the first great officer of the Court and he takes precedence over all other officers of the household. 

Historically the Lord Steward oversaw over the Household &#x27;below stairs&#x27;. He also presided at the Board of Green Cloth, which in early centuries had a financial, administrative and judicial role (latterly the Board retained a vestigial legal remit, until it was finally abolished in a 2004 reform of local government licensing). Prior to 1924 the Lord Steward was always a member of the Government, and until 1782 the office had been one of considerable political importance and carried Cabinet rank. In the modern period, Lord Stewards (up to and including Hugh Percy, 10th Duke of Northumberland in 1973) were invariably made Privy Counsellors on appointment.

Over time the domestic responsibilities of the office came increasingly to be carried out by a subordinate officer: the Master of the Household. In the Royal Household reforms of the 1920s, the Lord Steward&#x27;s Department was renamed the Master of the Household&#x27;s Department. At the same time, Lord Steward ceased to be a political appointment and instead became a largely titular office in the gift of the monarch. 

The Lord Steward continues to be in regular attendance on State and other ceremonial occasions (including State visits, State banquets, the State Opening of Parliament, State Funerals and Coronations). Holders of the office are always peers, usually of or above the degree of an Earl. Each Lord Steward receives his appointment from the Sovereign in person and bears a white staff as the emblem and warrant of his authority. The incumbent Lord Steward (appointed in 2023) is Peter St Clair-Erskine, 7th Earl of Rosslyn (who additionally serves as Personal Secretary to Their Majesties The King and Queen).

==History==

Within the &quot;Curia Regis&quot;, the office of Steward of the King&#x27;s Household was indistinguishable from that of Lord (High) Steward of England, which had first been introduced to the realm under William the Conqueror (and which was by the end of the 12th century an hereditary office). As late as 1221 the hereditary stewardship was still being referred to as a &#x27;stewardship of the royal household&#x27;.

Under King John, however, the holder of the hereditary office (Simon de Montfort, 5th Earl of Leicester) resided in France, and after his death in 1218 the Earldom went into &#x27;virtual abeyance&#x27; until Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester had his claim to it confirmed in 1239. By that time it had become the norm to appoint separate Stewards of the Household to undertake the practical duties of the office (so de Montfort came to be referred to, by contrast, as &#x27;Steward of all England&#x27;). For the rest of the 13th century there were normally two Stewards of the Household appointed, until 1292 when Walter de Beauchamp continued in office alone after his co-steward Peter de Champvent had been made Chamberlain. Since then every Steward of the Household has served singly.

During the minority of King Richard II, the Crown assented to a proposal that the Chancellor and Treasurer of England, the Keeper of the Privy Seal and the Steward and Chamberlain of the Household should be chosen by Parliament &#x27;from the ablest persons in the Realm&#x27;, and remain in office until the next Parliament (in contrast to the hereditary offices of State).

During the reign of King Edward IV, the duties, privileges and precedence of the Lord Steward were comprehensively enumerated in the Black Book of the Household (compiled in the early 1470s). In it he is described as having, under the King, the &#x27;secondary estate and rule&#x27; of the Royal Household, which is &#x27;wholly committed to be ruled and guided by his reason&#x27;. 

In 1540 the Lord Steward was redesignated Great Master of the King&#x27;s Household by the King&#x27;s Household Act 1540 (32 Hen. 8. c. 39), but that office was discontinued and the office of Lord Steward revived by the Lord Steward Act 1554 (which remains on the statute book). 

===The Lord Steward&#x27;s Department===
&quot;[The] Steward of Household receiveth his charge of the King&#x27;s high and proper person, and the staff of Household, by these words following: &quot;Seneschall tenez le baton de notre hostiell&quot;&quot; (&quot;The Black Book of the Household&quot;, 1471–72).

As steward, the Lord Steward presided over the Household &#x27;below stairs&#x27; (while the Lord Chamberlain presided over the Household &#x27;above stairs&#x27;). The sub-departments below stairs were mostly concerned with catering, including the royal kitchens and cellars, and various provisioning departments such as the buttery, spicery, confectionery, bakehouse, scalding house and so forth. Each was managed by its own staff of yeomen and grooms, and headed by a gentleman or sergeant; the Lord Steward exercised rights of patronage over these positions. Over time (particularly in the late 18th and early 19th centuries) the number of sub-departments was significantly reduced as items began to be sourced from outside vendors. 

At the demise of the monarch the Lord Steward would break his white staff over the coffin, &#x27;and thereby discharge all the Officers under his Jurisdiction&#x27;.

===The Board of Green Cloth===

&quot;...they sit with him at the Board of Doom within the Household, that is, at the Green Cloth in the Counting-house, as recorders and witnesses to the truth&quot; (&quot;The Black Book of the Household&quot;, 1471-72).

In the 14th century, the King&#x27;s Wardrobe, previously an independent and powerful financial office, was absorbed into the King&#x27;s Household and its officers and responsibilities were placed under the authority of the Lord Steward. Thus the Lord Steward&#x27;s Department gained increased financial and administrative responsibilities. Its officers met in the counting-house where they sat at a green cloth-covered table, by which they came to be known as the Board of Green Cloth.

The officers under the Lord Steward were listed in the 15th century as: the Treasurer of the Household and the Comptroller of the Household (both of whom would deputise for the Lord Steward in his absence), the Cofferer of the Household, two Clerks of the Green Cloth and the Chief Clerk of the Controlment; all of whom had their origins in the Wardrobe. Added to their number in the Tudor period was the Master of the Household (who took precedence after the Cofferer). 

By the time of the Restoration, the administration of the Lord Steward&#x27;s Department was for the most part delegated to the Board of Green Cloth, which served as the central accounting and organisational facility. Apart from the Lord Steward, the Board consisted of the Treasurer, the Comptroller and the Master of the Household (all of which were sinecure positions in the 17th and 18th centuries), the Cofferer (who had executive financial and accounting responsibilities), and a number of clerks and clerk comptrollers (who, in consultation with the Lord Steward, managed the day-to-day running of the household below stairs). 

===Judicial functions===
&quot;...by which he is also forthwith Steward of the whole Court of Marshalsea, that is, the Court of Household, in which he is Judge of life and limb&quot; (&quot;The Black Book of the Household&quot;, 1471-72).
By the early years of the thirteenth century, the Steward of the Household was seen as having &#x27;a special judicial role within the household, of which he was the appointed head&#x27;; and by the 1290s a distinct court of law had emerged, with its own personnel, procedures and jurisdiction, described by &quot;Fleta&quot; as &#x27;the king&#x27;s court in his hall before his steward&#x27;. In the 14th century it was termed the Court of the Steward and Marshal of the King&#x27;s House, but was more commonly known as the Marshalsea Court.

On this basis the Lord Steward acted as principal judge for all offences committed within the Verge of the Royal Court, having both civil and (in earlier years) criminal jurisdiction. He sat as a judge in the Marshalsea Court, and also in the Palace Court (created by Letters Patent of Charles I in 1630), and in this role he was assisted by the Knight Marshal and his men, by the Steward of the Marshalsea (always a qualified lawyer) and by the Coroner of the Verge. In the absence of the Lord Steward the Treasurer and Comptroller of the Household were empowered to sit as judges, along with the Steward of the Marshalsea; by the 19th century the latter had come to be, in practice, the only sitting judge of the court. The Marshalsea and Palace Courts were abolished in 1849.

The Board of Green Cloth had its own jurisdiction, with powers to maintain the peace within the Verge and to deal with offenders. 

By virtue of the Coroners Act 1988, the lord steward continued to appoint the Coroner of the Queen&#x27;s Household until the office was abolished in 2013 by the Coroners and Justice Act 2009.

===Parliamentary functions===

&quot;He hath the office to call the names of Knights, Citizens and Burgesses, at the Parliament door, the first day of commencement, and to amerce such as fail by the certificate&quot; (&quot;The Black Book of the Household&quot;, 1471–72).

Until 1831, the Lord Steward or his deputies presided over the swearing of oaths by members of the House of Commons. (These oaths were sworn in the lobby of the house, or another convenient room designated for the purpose, and were the same as, but sworn separately from, the oaths taken in the chamber itself.) In the Tudor period he was responsible for taking the roll call of all the Knights and Burgesses who had been elected to represent the Commons in Parliament, prior to each State Opening. 

By long tradition, the &#x27;Lords with White Staves&#x27; are called upon if required to deliver messages between the House of Lords and the Sovereign.

===Reforms===
For some centuries the role of the Lord Steward remained much as it had been in the late Middle Ages. In 1727, the office of Lord Steward was described in the following terms:&quot;To him is committed the State of the King&#x27;s House, to be ordered and guided according to his Discretion: He hath Authority over all Officers and Servants of the King&#x27;s House, except those of the Royal Chapel, Chamber, Stable, &amp;c. He by Vertue of his Office judgeth of all Treasons, Murthers, Felonies and other Enormities committed within the Verge of the King&#x27;s Court [...]. At the Beginning of Parliaments he attends the King&#x27;s Person, and administers the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy to the several Members of the House of Commons, and at the Ends of Parliaments, he adjudgeth the Parliamentary Expenses &amp;c.&quot;

The Lord Steward&#x27;s developing role in government, however, led to increased absences from the Court, which (among other things) led to a number of reforms being introduced.

In 1782 the financial independence of the Lord Steward&#x27;s Department was reduced (as the Treasury began to take a greater hand in Civil list expenditure), and the office of Cofferer was replaced by that of Paymaster of the Household (an officer with much reduced status and more limited responsibilities). At the same time the Master of the Household was made responsible for the executive management of the Lord Steward&#x27;s Department.

Following Queen Victoria&#x27;s accession to the throne, her husband Prince Albert took a keen interest in reforming the Royal Household of its complexities and inefficiencies. In 1841 Baron Stockmar was commissioned to draw up a memorandum on the matter; he summed up the problem with the observation that even simple tasks were the responsibility of more than one master: &#x27;the Lord Steward found the fuel and laid the fire, while the Lord Chamberlain lighted it&#x27;. As a result, towards the end of 1844, authority over the whole internal economy of the palace was conferred upon the Master of the Household, who became a permanent, resident officer. The titular heads (the Lord Steward, Lord Chamberlain and Master of the Horse) were retained, but their duties with regard to the Household were in this way delegated. Thus the office of Lord Steward came to be regarded as &#x27;purely an honorary one&#x27;.

In 1924, in line with these reforms, the Lord Steward&#x27;s Department (Board of Green Cloth) was formally renamed the Master of the Household&#x27;s Department (Board of Green Cloth). A few years earlier, in 1920, some residual executive and ceremonial duties had been transferred from the Lord Steward to the Lord Chamberlain.
