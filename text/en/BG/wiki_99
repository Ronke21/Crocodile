<text>Jean-Baptiste Bessières, duc d&#x27;Istrie (; 6 August 1768 – 1 May 1813) was a French military leader of the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars. He was made a Marshal of the Empire by Emperor Napoleon in 1804.

Born into the &quot;petite bourgeoisie&quot;, Bessières began his military career during the French Revolution and was promoted to captain in the 22nd Chasseur à cheval Regiment. He was noticed during the Italian campaign of 1796–1797 by General Napoleon Bonaparte, who appointed him commander of the corps of mounted guides. In this capacity, Bessières participated in the Egyptian campaign until 1799, before being made a general under the Consulate for his distinguished service at the Battle of Marengo. He was elevated to the dignity of Marshal of the Empire in 1804 and took command of the cavalry of the Imperial Guard.

A brilliant cavalry officer, Bessières distinguished himself in most of the major battles of the Napoleonic Wars, notably at Austerlitz, Eylau, Aspern-Essling and Wagram. In 1808, he played an active role in the Peninsular War, scoring a victory at Medina de Rioseco early in the conflict, the consequences of which were nevertheless short-lived. His performance three years later at the Battle of Fuentes de Oñoro, where his support for Masséna was lacking, generated controversy. He nevertheless took part in the Russian campaign in 1812, during which he saved Napoleon from a Cossack attack, and was given command of the entire French cavalry at the start of the German campaign. Bessières was killed by a cannonball on 1 May 1813 at Rippach, near Weißenfels, the day before the Battle of Lützen.

Bessières was, according to Napoleon, &quot;a reserve officer full of vigor, but prudent and circumspect.&quot; A mediocre commander-in-chief, he was, on the other hand, an excellent cavalry general, capable of initiative and who often personally led charges. The death of this cultivated, pious and popular man within the Guard was keenly felt by the Emperor, who declared of him: &quot;he lived like Bayard, he died like Turenne.&quot;

==Early life and career==

Jean-Baptiste Bessières was born on 6 August 1768 in Prayssac, in the province of Quercy. He was the eldest of eight children of Mathurin Bessières, a barber-surgeon belonging to the local bourgeoisie, and Antoinette Lemozy, who came from an old Guyennais bourgeois family. Educated in his childhood by a priest, Bessières later studied at the Collège Saint-Michel in Cahors, where he received a solid education. It was also there that he met Joachim Murat, with whom he became friends. In order to follow his father&#x27;s profession, Bessières prepared to take courses at the medical school of Montpellier, but his family suddenly found itself in a difficult financial situation, and he had to learn by experience under the guidance of his father and one of his cousins. Thanks to his education, he participated in the drafting of his town&#x27;s &quot;cahiers de doléances&quot; in 1788, and became second-in-command of the local National Guard when the French Revolution broke out.

On 8 February 1792, Bessières was designated by his fellow citizens to serve in King Louis XVI&#x27;s Constitutional Guard in Paris, which he joined on 7 April. Each department was required to supply it with a certain number of young men, who were selected from families considered as still being loyal to the king. Among others sent by the department of Lot for the Guard were Joachim Murat and Jean-Jacques Ambert. Despised for its royalist nature, the Constitutional Guard was disbanded by the revolutionary government on 29 May 1792, less than three months after its formation. After his discharge, Bessières joined the &quot;Jacobins Saint-Dominique&quot; battalion of the Parisian National Guard. Although he adhered to the ideas of the Revolution, Bessières disapproved of its radical turn which clashed with his Catholic convictions deeply tinged with conservatism. Remaining loyal to the king, he tried to take part in the defense of the Tuileries Palace during the Insurrection of 10 August and, as a precaution, had to hide for a time at the residence of the Duke of La Rochefoucauld.

==French Revolutionary Wars==

Bessières gave a fresh start to his military career on 1 November 1792, when he enlisted in the French Revolutionary Army as a simple cavalryman in the Legion of the Pyrenees, which later became the 22nd Chasseur à cheval Regiment. The regiment was sent to the Army of the Eastern Pyrenees, and for the next three years Bessières fought in the War of the Pyrenees. His advancement was reasonably rapid; he was promoted to &quot;adjudant sous-officier&quot; on 1 December 1792, to second lieutenant on 16 February 1793, to lieutenant on 10 May, and finally to captain on 8 May 1794. Serving successively under generals La Barre and Dugua, he notably participated in the Battle of Boulou, where the charge of the 22nd Chasseurs was decisive in dispersing the more numerous Spanish cavalry. Next he took part in the Battle of the Black Mountain under the command of General Dugua, and distinguished himself at Bascara in 1795.

In August 1795, Bessières was transferred with his regiment to the Army of Italy. This army was soon placed under the command of General Napoleon Bonaparte, who had as one of his aides-de-camp none other than his friend Murat. Bessières distinguished himself at the start of the campaign by capturing on foot, and with the help of two of his chasseurs, an Austrian artillery piece after having his horse shot from under him. He quickly acquired a reputation for bravery, which earned him his appointment by Bonaparte as head of the corps of mounted guides of the Army of Italy. On 4 September 1796, at the Battle of Rovereto, he spotted an Austrian battery with six of his chasseurs and seized two of its cannons. The same day, he was provisionally promoted to the rank of &quot;chef d&#x27;escadron&quot;, which was confirmed on 4 March 1797. He then distinguished himself at the Battle of Rivoli on 14 January 1797, then at that of La Favorita two days later, and was given the honor of bringing to the Directory the enemy standards captured during the last engagements. He then returned to Italy and joined Bonaparte&#x27;s inner circle. He was appointed &quot;chef de brigade&quot; on 9 March 1797.

As the commander of the guides of Bonaparte, now commander-in-chief of the Army of the Orient, in May 1798 Bessières departed for the expedition to Egypt. His men, almost entirely deprived of mounts, played no role in the first phase of the campaign. He followed Bonaparte to Syria and distinguished himself at the Siege of Acre and then, after the withdrawal of French forces to Egypt, at the Battle of Abukir (25 July 1799) where he joined Murat in leading a series of cavalry charges that helped drive their adversaries back into the sea. In the official report on the battle that he sent to the Directory on 27 July 1799, Bonaparte noted: &quot;&quot;chef de brigade&quot; Bessières, at the head of the guides, upheld the reputation of his corps&quot;. Having helped Bonaparte to reassert his authority when it was being contested during the campaign, Bessières was part of the small retinue that accompanied the commander-in-chief on his return to France in August 1799.

==Under the Consulate==

Back in France, Bessières was present at the coup d&#x27;état of 18 Brumaire during which, according to Jacques Garnier, he &quot;stayed constantly with Bonaparte&quot;. On 11 November 1799, he was appointed second-in-command of the Consular Guard by Bonaparte, now First Consul of the French Republic. He was also designated tutor to Eugène de Beauharnais, Bonaparte&#x27;s adoptive son.

On 14 June 1800, Bessières took part in the Battle of Marengo. When the tide turned against the First Consul, Desaix and the Boudet division arrived on the battlefield. To support their movement, the Kellermann brigade deployed on the right flank while Bessières mounted a massive charge on the left flank with the entire cavalry of the Consular Guard, sowing panic among the Austrians. The grenadiers à cheval, in particular, took possession of three enemy standards. Although successful, the charge&#x27;s effect on the battle was not as decisive as Bonaparte pretended. After the fighting, Bessières was praised by the First Consul, who told him: &quot;under your command, the Guard covered itself with glory, it could not have done better in the given circumstances.&quot; He was successively promoted to general of brigade on 18 July 1800 and to general of division on 13 September 1802.

==Marshal of the Empire==
===Early Empire and the charge at Austerlitz===

With the establishment of the imperial regime, Bessières was elevated to the dignity of Marshal of the Empire on 19 May 1804. On 14 June, he was made a Grand Officer of the Legion of Honour, then Colonel General of the cavalry of the Imperial Guard on 20 July. This latter function allowed Bessières to exercise considerable influence within the Imperial Guard, which he set about reforming and disciplining. Leading the Guard cavalry during parades and on the battlefields, his important military functions led him to be among the Emperor&#x27;s intimates, whom he very often accompanied on his travels. However, this prestigious appointment aroused the jealousy of other marshals, and Bessières&#x27; accession to the marshalate appeared to be an unjustified favour in view of his service record, which was less brilliant than that of many others. General Auguste de Marmont, a future marshal, said that if Bessières could be made a marshal, then anyone could become one as well. In fact, despite his undeniable bravery, Bessières owed his marshal&#x27;s baton more to his loyalty to Napoleon than to his talents on the battlefield. On 2 February 1805, he received the insignia of the Grand Eagle of the Legion of Honour.

Bessières took part in the German campaign of the War of the Third Coalition in command of all the units of the Imperial Guard. While the chasseurs à cheval of the Guard were sent as an advance guard, the marshal escorted Napoleon with the grenadiers à cheval and the Mamelukes. On 20 November, when Murat&#x27;s cavalry had just been overwhelmed on the road to Olmütz by its Russian counterpart, Bessières restored the situation by counterattacking with four squadrons of the Imperial Guard, jointly with General d&#x27;Hautpoul&#x27;s cuirassiers, and push his adversaries back to Raußnitz. A few days later, on 2 December, at the Battle of Austerlitz, Bessières led the charge of the chasseurs à cheval and grenadiers à cheval of the Guard, which routed the Russian Imperial Guard. While Napoleon planned to break the Austro-Russian center in order to divide the enemy forces and the situation was rather to his advantage, a potentially dangerous event for the French occurred when the Russian Imperial Guard, under the command of Grand Duke Konstantin, attacked the soldiers of the Vandamme division around Stary Vinohrady with the support of their artillery. The French 4th Line Regiment and 24th Light Infantry Regiment suffered heavy losses (over 400 men), with the 4th Line losing its eagle.

Napoleon then decided to send Bessières and the Guard cavalry, composed of the chasseurs à cheval and the Mamelukes (four squadrons), the grenadiers à cheval (four squadrons), as well as two batteries of horse artillery of the Guard to support them. An initial charge executed by two squadrons of horse chasseurs à cheval, supported by three squadrons of grenadiers à cheval, dispersed the Tsar&#x27;s cavalry and allowed the infantry of the Russian Guard to be engaged. However, the arrival of seven squadrons of Cossacks and Chevalier Guards as reinforcements reversed the situation. To support the cavalry, the Emperor first sent the remainder of the chasseurs à cheval and the Mamelukes, followed by the last squadron of grenadiers à cheval. The Russian cavalry was driven back and suffered heavy losses, with the Chevalier Guards losing more than 200 men, including Prince Repnin-Volkonsky. The total casualties of the Guard cavalry amounted to around 140 men. The charges of the Guard cavalry led by Bessières allowed this final Russian attack on the Pratzen heights to be repelled, leaving the French in control of the plateau until the end of the battle. Returning to Vienna with the Emperor and the Guard, Bessières returned to France after the signing of the Treaty of Pressburg in late December.

===Prussian and Polish campaigns===

On 14 October 1806, Bessières was present the Battle of Jena without taking an active part. Shortly afterwards he took part in the triumphant entry of the French Army into Berlin, where he paraded at the head of the Imperial Guard cavalry, and was entrusted with several administrative and organizational tasks. He spent the rest of the Prussian campaign attached to the Emperor&#x27;s headquarters. Operations continued against the Russians, and around mid-December, Bessières obtained command of the II Cavalry Corps, comprising two dragoon divisions, one cuirassier division and three light cavalry regiments, totalling 7,500 cavalrymen.

Crossing the Vistula on 17 December, Bessières&#x27; cavalry advanced with caution into Polish territory and pushed the enemy back beyond the Wkra. Attacked on 23 December at Bieżuń when he had only two companies of light infantry to support his cavalry, Bessières managed to withstand the attacks of several Prussian and Russian columns of around 5,000 to 6,000 men. He then gained the upper hand, took two standards, five cannons and a number of prisoners of war. The next day, Bessières charged several Prussian squadrons and seized multiple artillery pieces. Remaining with Bernadotte&#x27;s I Corps on the banks of the Wkra, Bessières, poorly informed by Tilly&#x27;s light cavalry, lingered for three days at Bieżuń while the French army had launched its offensive against the Russians. He finally resumed his advance on 27 December towards Mława, but the campaign was interrupted shortly afterwards when Napoleon put his troops into winter quarters. Bessières&#x27; corps was dissolved on 12 January and he returned with the Emperor to Warsaw, where he retook command of the Imperial Guard.

On 8 February 1807, at the Battle of Eylau, Augereau&#x27;s corps had its advance derailed by a snowstorm and was crushed by Russian artillery fire. Bennigsen&#x27;s cavalry attempted to exploit this success, but was repelled thanks to a charge by the Guard&#x27;s chasseurs à cheval led by Bessières. Napoleon then ordered Marshal Murat to launch all the reserve cavalry in a massive charge. The French cavalry broke through the first Russian line, then the second, before finding themselves behind the enemy ranks, threatened with encirclement. As a result, the Emperor ordered Bessières to assist the reserve cavalry with that of the Guard. A second charge was executed by the chasseurs à cheval of the Guard followed by 5th Cuirassiers and the grenadiers à cheval, who broke through the enemy lines but, lost in a snowstorm, narrowly escaped being captured. The charge of the Guard cavalry finally allowed the reserve cavalry to avoid encirclement and return to its initial positions.

Following the French tactical victory at Eylau, Bessières remained by Napoleon&#x27;s side and focused on reinforcing his troops, which had been worn down by the last campaign. In May, the Imperial Guard counted approximately 8,500 men. With the resumption of hostilities, Bessières served at the Battle of Heilsberg on 10 June, where his chief of staff, General , was killed by a cannonball, and at the Battle of Friedland on the 14th, which resulted in a decisive victory for Napoleon. Bessières was present alongside Napoleon at the meeting of 25 June 1807 with Tsar Alexander I of Russia on the Niemen, where a draft of the Treaty of Tilsit was drawn up. He left Tilsit on 9 July with the Emperor and the Guard and began the return march to Berlin and then Paris. Bessières was then tasked with negotiating the marriage of Princess Catharina of Württemberg to the Emperor&#x27;s brother Jérôme Bonaparte, King of Westphalia. Once this mission was accomplished, Bessières returned to Paris, where he attended from 25 to 28 November the festivities organized for the return of the Imperial Guard.

===First campaign in the Iberian Peninsula===

Following the Dos de Mayo Uprising in Madrid on 2 May 1808, Napoleon sent Bessières to Spain to reinforce the French occupation troops. The marshal, exercising independent command for the first time, took command of the units of the Imperial Guard and the Observation Corps of the Western Pyrenees, with which he established himself in Burgos while awaiting the arrival of Joseph Bonaparte, who had been designated by his brother to take the throne of Spain. The troops placed under Bessières&#x27; orders mainly comprised conscript units, formed into provisional regiments of little value, with only four battalions of experienced troops. Occupying from May the provinces of Navarre and Gipuzkoa, Bessières seized the cities of Logroño and Torquemada on 6 June, then Segovia on 7 June.

In July, the Spanish Army of Galicia commanded by Generals Blake and Cuesta marched against the French. Bessières went to meet this army with all available troops, or about 15,600 men, and faced it at the Battle of Medina de Rioseco on 14 July. Judging it preferable to attack his adversaries separately in order to defeat them in detail, Bessières ordered General Merle, supported by Lasalle, to attack Blake&#x27;s army while General Mouton&#x27;s division was tasked with distracting Cuesta. An initial assault on Mount Moclín by the brigade failed, and it was only on the second attempt that the French managed to take control of the position. Bessières then had the Valdecuevas plateau bombarded and then assaulted by the Sabatier, Darmagnac and brigades. Blake repelled the first attack, but at that moment made the mistake of detaching one of his divisions to Cuesta, dangerously weakening his left wing. Lasalle&#x27;s light cavalry charged this weak sector of the Spanish line, dispersed the enemy infantry and, in a few minutes, swept into the Valdecuevas heights.

Bessières now turned his attention to Cuesta. Portago&#x27;s Spanish division launched a counterattack on the plateau and initially met some success, but was finally repelled by the French infantry&#x27;s own counterattack. Cuesta&#x27;s troops were no more fortunate against Mouton; battered by musket fire and a charge by the imperial cavalry, they joined the general debacle despite the resilience of a few rearguard units. The battle ended around 3 p.m. with a clear French victory, Bessières&#x27; first as commander-in-chief of an independent force. French losses were around 1,000 men compared to nearly 8,000 killed, wounded, captured or missing among the Spanish. The timid French pursuit was halted by the presence of the guerrillas, but the victory at Medina de Rioseco eradicated the regular Spanish army from the northern provinces and opened the way to Madrid for King Joseph. Napoleon, receiving the news, exclaimed: &quot;This is a second battle of Villaviciosa; Bessières has placed my brother Joseph on the throne of Spain&quot;.

Bessières followed up his success by pushing towards Mayorga, which he entered on 22 July. He wrote to Blake to urge him to lay down his arms, arguing that his cause was futile, and ordered the release of several hundred prisoners taken at Medina de Rioseco as a gesture of goodwill. The strategic advantages gained over the Spanish as a result of this battle were, however, overshadowed by General Dupont&#x27;s defeat at Bailén, which forced the French to recross the Ebro. Bessières&#x27; corps withdrew towards Briviesca while awaiting the arrival of the Emperor, who had decided to intervene personally in Spain. Once he arrived, Bessières received the order to advance on Burgos but lost time, either because he overestimated the enemy forces or because he had known since 6 November that he was to be replaced by Marshal Soult at the head of the II Corps. On 9 November, he handed over his command to the latter, while retaining that of the Imperial Guard and the reserve cavalry. In accordance with the Emperor&#x27;s orders, the two marshals marched on Burgos and clashed with the Spanish army of the Count of Belveder in front of the city, at the Battle of Gamonal. The decisive action of the French infantry against the Spanish lines was completed by a heavy cavalry attack led by Bessières, which cut down fleeing soldiers and seized numerous artillery pieces.

Bessières directed the French pursuit and fought at the Battle of Somosierra on 30 November alongside the Emperor, where the Polish light cavalrymen of the Guard seized a defile guarded by a Spanish army and sixteen artillery pieces. The defenders were pushed back to Madrid, to which Bessières, arriving on 2 December with the Guard cavalry and the La Houssaye and Latour-Maubourg dragoon divisions, sent an initial order for surrender. His offer was rejected, but the Spanish capital was finally forced to capitulate on 4 December to the Emperor himself. Bessières then contributed to the destruction of General Castaños&#x27; forces, which he harassed along the way until the Andalusian border. On that date, he was recalled to Madrid by Napoleon to join the pursuit of General John Moore&#x27;s British army, which was retreating in northern Spain. He led the cavalry to Villafranca del Bierzo before returning to Valladolid with Napoleon, who had decided to return to France to prepare for an imminent war with Austria. Bessières was appointed governor of Spain&#x27;s northern provinces on 17 January 1809 and returned to France on 9 March.

===Essling and Wagram===

Recalled by the Emperor for the War of the Fifth Coalition, Bessières was entrusted from 10 April with the cavalry reserve of the Army of Germany. This consisted of the Lasalle and Montbrun light cavalry divisions, the Beaumont dragoon division and the Nansouty heavy cavalry division, for a total of around 15,000 cavalrymen. On 21 April, marching in the vanguard with the Bavarian cavalry and the Nansouty and Saint-Sulpice divisions, Bessières defeat the Austrian cavalry in front of Landshut. On the night of the 22nd, Napoleon ordered him to pursue Hiller&#x27;s Austrian corps, defeated the previous day at Landshut. The Marshal&#x27;s forces for this mission were composed of the Bavarian Wrede division of the VII Corps, the Molitor infantry division and the Marulaz cavalry division, both belonging to the IV Corps. Bessières arrived at Neumarkt-Sankt Veit on 22 April, accompanied by the Wrede division and Marulaz&#x27;s cavalry, which was sent in a reconnaissance on the banks of the Inn. A first contact between the two armies took place on 23 April: the next day, Hiller launched a counterattack and quickly put the Franco-Bavarian troops in a difficult situation, despite the resistance of the Wrede division on the hills southeast of Neumarkt. Threatened with encirclement, Bessières ordered a retreat early in the afternoon. This defeat cost him 2,600 men killed, wounded or captured, compared to only 800 Austrians casualties.

Bessières then fought at the Battle of Aspern-Essling, which took place from 21 to 22 May. His 7,000 cavalrymen, linking the troops of Masséna and Lannes, were deployed on the plain between Aspern and Essling. These villages were the scene of bloody clashes which included repeated charges of Bessières&#x27; cavalrymen. A controversy then arose between him and Lannes, under whose orders he had been placed, who accused him of not committing himself sufficiently against the Austrians; at the time, Bessières ignored this but a lively argument between the two men ensued that same evening at the bivouac. On the second day, the French, despite their resistance, were overwhelmed by superior numbers and Napoleon had to order a retreat towards the island of Lobau. In the mean time, tasked with containing the Austrian pressure with his cavalry, Bessières kept Archduke Charles&#x27; troops at a distance and allowed the army to retire in good order. He was made &quot;duc d&#x27;Istrie&quot; (Duke of Istria) on 28 May 1809. ´This was a duché grand-fief, a rare, nominal, but hereditary honor (extinct in 1856) in Napoleon&#x27;s own Kingdom of Italy.

At the Battle of Wagram on 6 July, with the situation on the French left rapidly deteriorating, Napoleon ordered Marshal Bessières to charge the Austrian formations threatening his left wing. With time against him, Bessières chose not to wait for the arrival of the Guard cavalry and, with his two other heavy cavalry divisions engaged elsewhere, he decided to conduct his attack with the Nansouty division alone. The charge was carried out under a hail of cannonballs and grapeshot. Having located a weak point in the Austrian line, the French cavalrymen pierced and pushed back the enemy infantry that had formed into squares, cutting down a battalion of Grenzers in the process. However, a large part of the French cavalry was hampered by the masses of Austrian infantry and the attack lost much of its momentum. Bessières and Nansouty then turned to the right and charged the artillery of the Prince of Liechtenstein, but the Austrian cavalry intervened almost immediately and pushed the French cavalrymen back to their lines.

Bessières, whose determination had not been weakened by this first failure, was preparing to launch a new assault, this time with the support of part of the Guard cavalry, when he was knocked unconscious after his horse was struck dead by cannonball. The Imperial Guard, which adored him and believed him dead, was distressed. Napoleon later told him: &quot;That was a fine shot, Bessières, it made my Guard cry.&quot; Without news of his commander, Nansouty decided to break off the engagement in order to preserve his already heavily battered division. Bessières&#x27; charge, although carried out in haste with a single division, had the important tactical consequence of giving Napoleon valuable time, allowing him to regain the initiative in the battle. After having filled the gap created by the advance of the Macdonald column, in the evening Bessières&#x27; cavalry launched itself against the retreating Austrian lines, but did not inflict any serious damage. Bessières was treated in Vienna and returned to France once his healing was complete.

===Peacetime and return to Spain===

Shortly afterwards, on 8 August 1809, Bessières was appointed commander of the 16th military division, then of the three divisions of National Guards assembled at Ostende (then part of the department of Lys), Saint-Omer and Lille on 20 August. Around the same time, a British expeditionary force landed on the island of Walcheren and seized the town of Vlissingen, threatening Antwerp. A French army under Bernadotte&#x27;s command was assembled to face the British, but the latter, plagued by fever, were repatriated at the end of August, with the exception of a garrison that remained in Vlissingen. On 11 September, Bessières replaced Bernadotte at the head of the Army of the North and reoccupied Vlissingen and Walcheren, which had been definitively evacuated by the British.

Back in Paris, Bessières coldly received Napoleon&#x27;s divorce from Joséphine, which he had opposed in the past, but this did not prevent the Emperor from spending a few days at the Marshal&#x27;s estate, the . Bessières was named commander of the Imperial Guard in Paris on 19 January 1810; two months later, on 19 March, he was made governor of Strasbourg and in this capacity welcomed the new empress Marie Louise of Austria when she arrived on French soil. After attending the religious wedding of the imperial couple on 2 April, Bessières divided his time between Grignon and Paris and essentially occupied himself with the administration of the Guard.

On 15 January 1811, Bessières was made commander-in-chief of the Army of the North of Spain. With around 66,000 men, it operated over a very large territory stretching from Navarre to Asturias, which led to a large dispersion of troops and significant logistical issues. Bessières&#x27; mission was to support the led by Marshal Masséna. The latter, after failing to expel the Anglo-Portuguese troops of General Wellington from the peninsula, retreated to the Spanish border and requested Bessières&#x27; assistance, particularly in order to be supplied with horses and food. He also sought to regroup his forces in order to lift the Anglo-Portuguese blockade of Almeida. As the requests from the commander-in-chief of the Army of Portugal became increasingly urgent, Bessières highlighted his own difficulties, showed little inclination to cooperate and expressed his doubts about the strategy adopted by Prince of Essling. He also wrote to Major-General Berthier to inform him of the worrying material situation in which the Army of Portugal found itself. As a result, Masséna was forced to postpone his offensive twice before Bessières, realizing the need for immediate intervention to save Almeida and Ciudad Rodrigo, decided to send as reinforcements the Wathier and Lepic cavalry brigades (1,500 men) with six cannons and thirty carts. These troops, personally led by the Duke of Istria, joined Masséna on 1 May 1811.

A battle began on 3 May at Fuentes de Oñoro, in the province of Salamanca, that lasted three days. On the 5th, Wellington found himself in a delicate position in face of the French. Despite the meager reinforcements sent by Bessières, Masséna did indeed succeed in exploiting a weakness in Wellington&#x27;s line, and the latter was on the verge of defeat. Masséna ordered his aide-de-camp, Charles Oudinot, to find Lepic and the Guard cavalry, with the order to charge immediately. However, Oudinot soon returned with bad news, reporting that Lepic only recognized Bessières as his commander and would not charge without his order. With Bessières nowhere to be found, the opportunity to finish off Wellington&#x27;s army was lost. Later that day, Bessières opposed the use of his carts which Masséna wanted to direct to Ciudad Rodrigo in order to resupply the army with munitions. Ultimately, the battle ended in a major French strategic failure. Informed of the events, Napoleon told Bessières, through Berthier: &quot;you have been useless to the Army of Portugal.&quot;

Following this defeat, Masséna was recalled to France and was replaced at the head of the Army of Portugal by Marshal Marmont, to whom Bessières had wheat, horses and supplies sent. Although he had initially opposed the movement conceived by Marmont to help Soult in Extremadura, by refusing to lead troops to Salamanca, he ended up giving his agreement and sending the requested troops. Bessières was replaced in his command in Spain on 8 July 1811 by General Dorsenne. Without assignment, he remained in Paris for a whole year and also took the opportunity to visit his father in his native Prayssac.

===Russian campaign===

Bessières rejoined the &quot;Grande Armée&quot; in preparation for the Russian campaign in 1812 and once again took command of the cavalry of the Imperial Guard. At the time, this 6,000 men-strong elite formation consisted of General Walther&#x27;s grenadiers à cheval, General Lefebvre-Desnouettes&#x27; horse and Mameluke chasseurs, two regiments of lancers under Generals Krasiński and Colbert, a regiment of dragoons and two squadrons of elite gendarmes. This appointment netherless seemed to be a disavowal, since Bessières was deprived of command of an army corps. Between February and March, the Guard units headed for Germany, then from mid-April, towards Poland. On 23 June, French troops reached the banks of the Niemen which was crossed the next day, marking the beginning of the invasion.

Bessières followed the Emperor with the Guard during the first part of the campaign, entering Vilnius with him on 28 June and then Vitebsk on 28 July. The operations were challenging and the &quot;Grande Armée&quot; was greatly weakened by disease and desertion; however, the Guard cavalry was still little affected thanks to the good dispositions made by Bessières. After crossing the Dnieper and capturing Smolensk in mid-August, Napoleon hesitated to continue his march towards Moscow. Bessières was among those who encouraged him not to go further, but the Emperor finally decided to resume the offensive. The Russians, who until then had withdrawn almost without a fight before the French, accepted the confrontation at the Battle of the Moskowa, on 7 September 1812. Throughout the day, Bessières&#x27; cavalry was held in reserve along with the rest of the Imperial Guard. The French attacks had been continuing since the morning and managed, at the cost of enormous losses, to disrupt the center of the Russian position. At this moment, Murat and Ney expressly asked the Emperor to deploy the Imperial Guard, who refused to do so despite Bessières&#x27; favorable opinion. With the situation in the center having evolved, the two marshals renewed their request which was once again rejected by Napoleon, this time supported in this sense by the Duke of Istria. In the evening, the latter proposed in vain to his sovereign to deploy the Guard against the retreating Russian army.

The French entered Moscow on 15 September and Bessières set up camp with his troops near the Kremlin, where the Emperor resided. During the burning of Moscow, he managed to convince Napoleon to leave the palace. A few days later, the marshal was sent to the vanguard in support of Murat with an army corps comprising, in addition to the two lancer regiments of the Guard, light cavalry, dragoons, the division from the I Corps and Poniatowski&#x27;s Polish infantry. Crossing the Desna, he forced the Russian general Miloradovich to retreat and camped with Murat in front of Kutuzov&#x27;s army at Tarutino, where the lack of fodder and supplies was sorely felt, particularly among the cavalry units. On 18 October, the two marshals were attacked by the Russians at the Battle of Vinkovo and had to retreat to Voronovo. They rejoined Napoleon shortly after when the retreat from Russia had just begun. On 25 October, the day after the Battle of Maloyaroslavets, the Emperor&#x27;s staff was attacked by Cossacks at . Bessières, with the Guard cavalrymen that were standing nearby, restored the situation and repelled the assailants to the Luga. In the words of a biographer: &quot;Bessières had saved the Emperor: the Bulletin of the &quot;Grande Armée&quot; made this known to all of Europe.&quot; At the war council that followed this event, the Duke of Istria advised retreating towards Smolensk via Mozhaysk; Napoleon ended up choosing the shortest route, which already been taken during the advance into Russia.

During the retreat, Bessières marched at the head of the army with the Imperial Guard, crossing successively Mozhaysk on 29 October, Viazma on 1 November, Dorogobuzh on the 5th and Smolensk on the 9th. At the Battle of Krasnoi on 15 November, the Guard attempted to contain the Russian assaults to allow the rest of the army to continue its retreat. When he reached Orsha on the 19 November, Bessières had no more than some 1,000 Guard cavalrymen under his command, half of whom were dismounted. After the crossing of the Berezina, the retreat of the French troops continued until Königsberg and, at the end of December, Bessières was recalled to France to oversee the reconstitution of the Guard and the cavalry reserve.

===Death in combat===

In 1813, when the German campaign began, the Emperor entrusted the Duke of Istria with the command of the entire cavalry of the army, that is, in addition to the squadrons of the Guard, the I Cavalry Corps of General Latour-Maubourg, the two cavalry regiments of General Kellermann and some foreign cavalry units. On the morning of 1 May 1813, on the eve of the Battle of Lützen, the Marshal burned his wife&#x27;s letters that he had until then piously preserved and, having reluctantly agreed, faced with the insistence of his officers, to take a light snack, he then said: &quot;if a cannonball is to take me this morning, I do not want it to take me on an empty stomach.&quot; Shortly afterwards, at around 12:55 p.m., while he was leading an attack near Weißenfels, a cannonball decapitated his orderly, a Polish lancer. A second cannonball ricocheted off a wall, shattered Bessières&#x27; hand and pierced his chest, killing him instantly. Napoleon, for whom Bessières&#x27; death was an immense loss, commented: &quot;Bessières lived like Bayard and he died like Turenne.&quot;

==Personal life==
Jean-Baptiste Bessières was the elder brother of General of Brigade Bertrand Bessières (1773-1854), who attained this rank after Austerlitz and distinguished himself in Spain, Russia and Germany. He ended his career with the rank of lieutenant-general under the Restoration. The prefect and diplomat Julien Bessières (1777-1840) was his cousin.

On 27 October 1801, Bessières married Marie-Jeanne Lapeyrière, the daughter of Jean-Louis Lapeyrière, a tax collector for the clergy in Cahors, and sister of art collector , at the chapel of the Château de Canussel in Lacour. The couple had known each other since childhood. They had one child, Napoléon Bessières, who left no issue. Gentle, pious and reserved, Lapeyrière did not hesitate to oppose Napoleon head-on, particularly on the religious question. Bessières also had a mistress, Virginie Oreille, a young dancer at the Paris Opera.

Bessières left no fortune on his death and Napoleon took charge of settling his debts, while his widow obtained in 1815, from the Emperor of Austria, an annuity of 20,000 francs as a compensation for the loss of her endowment as Duchess of Istria, as the territory was returned to Austria at the Congress of Vienna. Their son Napoléon was made a member of the Chamber of Peers by Louis XVIII. Lapeyrière died on 4 June 1840, twenty-seven years after her husband.

== Legacy ==

As a commander, Bessières proved out of his depth when leading armies. His background as the commander of Napoleon&#x27;s headquarters guard, the Guides of the Army of Italy, deprived him of the wide experience his fellow marshals had earned before assuming high command. Like Murat, he was however an excellent cavalry commander and he also proved an able administrator of the Imperial Guard. His few attempts at independent command were not a success however and Napoleon thereafter preferred using Bessières as a cavalry commander.

Bessières was not of high birth but he adopted the manners and looks of a gentleman as befitting Napoleon&#x27;s closest Guard commander. He typically wore the uniform of Napoleon&#x27;s old guides of the Army of Italy with marshal&#x27;s distinctions and wore his hair long with white powder in &quot;ancien régime&quot; style, even when the latter went out of fashion. He was known to be well mannered and kind and generous to subordinates but very touchy about his privileges and position.

<text>Liriodendron tulipifera—known as the tulip tree, American tulip tree, tulipwood, tuliptree, tulip poplar, whitewood, fiddletree, lynn-tree, hickory-poplar, and yellow-poplar—is the North American representative of the two-species genus &quot;Liriodendron&quot; (the other member is &quot;Liriodendron chinense&quot;). It is native to eastern North America from Southern Ontario and possibly southern Quebec to west to Illinois, and east to southwestern Massachusetts, then south to central Florida and Louisiana.

Tulip tree is the tallest tree of the temperate deciduous forest. It can grow to more than in virgin cove forests of the Appalachian Mountains, often with no limbs until it reaches in height, making it a very valuable timber tree. 
This species is also fast-growing, without the common problems of weak wood strength and short lifespan often seen in fast-growing species. In 2024 the unusual combination of fast-growing with strong wood was explained. No longer called a hardwood, the term &quot;midwood&quot; was created expressly for the wood of tulip tree.

The tulip tree is the state tree of Indiana, Kentucky, and Tennessee.

== Description ==
The tulip tree is one of the largest of the native trees of eastern North America, known in an extraordinary case to reach the height of with the next-tallest known specimens in the range. These heights are comparable to the very tallest known eastern white pines, another species often described as the tallest in eastern North America. 

The trunk on large examples is typically in diameter, though it can grow much broader. Its ordinary height is and it tends to have a pyramidal crown. It prefers deep, rich, and rather moist soil; it is common throughout the Southern United States. Growth is fairly rapid.
The bark is brown, furrowed, aromatic and bitter. The branchlets are smooth, and lustrous, initially reddish, maturing to dark gray, and finally brown. The wood is light yellow to brown, and the sapwood creamy white; light, soft, brittle, close, straight-grained. Specific gravity: 0.4230; density: .

Winter buds are dark red, covered with a bloom, obtuse; scales becoming conspicuous stipules for the unfolding leaf, and persistent until the leaf is fully grown. Flower-bud enclosed in a two-valved, caducous bract.

The alternate leaves are simple, pinnately veined, measuring long and wide. They have four lobes, and are heart-shaped or truncate or slightly wedge-shaped at base, entire, and the apex cut across at a shallow angle, making the upper part of the leaf look square; midrib and primary veins prominent. They come out of the bud recurved by the bending down of the petiole near the middle bringing the apex of the folded leaf to the base of the bud, light green, when full grown are bright green, smooth and shining above, paler green beneath, with downy veins. In autumn they turn a clear, bright yellow. Petiole long, slender, angled.

April marks the start of the flowering period in the Southern United States (except as noted below); trees at the northern limit of cultivation begin to flower in June. The flowers are pale green or yellow (rarely white), with an orange band on the tepals; they yield large quantities of nectar.

* Flowers: May. Perfect, solitary, terminal, greenish yellow, borne on stout peduncles, long, cup-shaped, erect, conspicuous. The bud is enclosed in a sheath of two triangular bracts which fall as the blossom opens.
* Calyx: Sepals three, imbricate in bud, reflexed or spreading, somewhat veined, early deciduous.
* Corolla: Cup-shaped, petals six, long, in two rows, imbricate, hypogynous, greenish yellow, marked toward the base with yellow. Somewhat fleshy in texture.
* Stamens: Indefinite, imbricate in many ranks on the base of the receptacle; filaments thread-like, short; anthers extrorse, long, two-celled, adnate; cells opening longitudinally.
* Pistils: Indefinite, imbricate on the long slender receptacle. Ovary one-celled; style acuminate, flattened; stigma short, one-sided, recurved; ovules two.
* Fruit: Narrow light brown cone, formed from many overlapping samaras which are dispersed by wind, leaving the axis persistent all winter. September, October.

== Taxonomy ==

Originally described by Carl Linnaeus, &quot;Liriodendron tulipifera&quot; is one of two species (see also &quot;L. chinense&quot;) in the genus &quot;Liriodendron&quot; in the magnolia family. The name &quot;Liriodendron&quot; is Greek for &quot;lily tree&quot;. It is also called the tuliptree Magnolia, or sometimes, by the lumber industry, as the tulip-poplar or yellow-poplar. However, it is not closely related to true lilies, tulips or poplars.

The tulip tree has impressed itself upon popular attention in many ways, and consequently has many common names. The tree&#x27;s traditional name in the Miami-Illinois language is . Native Americans so habitually made their dugout canoes of its trunk that the early settlers west of the Appalachian Mountains called it Canoewood. The color of its wood gives it the name Whitewood. In areas near the Mississippi River it is called a poplar largely because of the fluttering habits of its leaves, in which it resembles trees of that genus. It is sometimes called &quot;fiddle tree,&quot; because its peculiar leaves, with their arched bases and in-cut sides, suggest the violin shape.

The external resemblance of its flowers to tulips named it the Tulip-tree. In their internal structure, however, they are quite different. Instead of the triple arrangements of stamens and pistil parts, they have indefinite numbers arranged in spirals.

== Distribution and habitat ==
In the Cretaceous age the genus was represented by several species, and was widely distributed over North America and Europe. Its remains are also found in Tertiary rocks.

Today the tulip tree is one of the largest and most valuable hardwoods of eastern North America, thriving in temperate deciduous forests east of the Mississippi River. It prefers rolling hills or mountains with moist, well-drained soil and is rarely found on coastal plains. 
It is native southern Ontario and northern Ohio south to the Gulf of Mexico and from extreme southern New York and Connecticut south to Louisiana and northern Florida. It extends south to north Florida, and is rare west of the Mississippi River, but is found occasionally for ornamentals. Its finest development is in the Southern Appalachian mountains, where trees may exceed in height. It was introduced into Great Britain before 1688 in Bishop Compton&#x27;s garden at Fulham Palace and is now a popular ornamental in streets, parks, and large gardens. The Appalachian Mountains and adjacent Piedmont running south from Pennsylvania to Georgia contained 75 percent of all yellow-poplar growing stock in 1974.

Parts of east-central Florida near Orlando have an ecotype with similar-looking leaves to the coastal plain variant of the Carolinas; it flowers much earlier (usually in March, although flowering can begin in late January), with a smaller yellower bloom than other types. This east central Florida ecotype/Peninsular allozyme group seems to have the best ability to tolerate very wet conditions, where it may grow short pencil-like root structures (pneumatophores) similar to those produced by other swamp trees in warm climates. Superior resistance to drought, pests and wind is also noted. Some individuals retain their leaves all year unless a hard frost strikes. Places where it may be seen include Dr. Howard A. Kelly Park, Lake Eola Park, Spring Hammock Preserve, Big Tree Park and the University of Central Florida Arboretum.

== Ecology ==
&quot;Liriodendron tulipifera&quot; is generally considered to be a shade-intolerant species that is most commonly associated with the first century of forest succession. In Appalachian forests, it is a dominant species during the 50–150 years of succession, but is absent or rare in stands of trees 500 years or older. One particular group of trees survived in the grounds of Orlagh College, Dublin for 200 years, before having to be cut down in 1990. On mesic, fertile soils, it often forms pure or nearly pure stands. It can and does persist in older forests when there is sufficient disturbance to generate large enough gaps for regeneration. Individual trees have been known to live for up to around 500 years.

All young tulip trees and most mature specimens are intolerant of prolonged inundation; however, a coastal plain swamp ecotype in the southeastern United States is relatively flood-tolerant. This ecotype is recognized by its blunt-lobed leaves, which may have a red tint.
&quot;Liriodendron tulipifera&quot; produces a large amount of seed, which is dispersed by wind. The seeds typically travel a distance equal to 4–5 times the height of the tree, and remain viable for 4–7 years. The seeds are not one of the most important food sources for wildlife, but they are eaten by a number of birds and mammals.

Vines, especially wild grapevines, are known to be extremely damaging to young trees of this species. Vines are damaging both due to blocking out sunlight, and increasing weight on limbs which can lead to bending of the trunk and/or breaking of limbs.

=== Host plant ===
In terms of its role in the ecological community, &quot;L. tulipifera&quot; does not host a great diversity of insects, with only 28 species of moths associated with the tree. Among specialists, &quot;L. tulipifera&quot; is the sole host plant for the caterpillars of &quot;C. angulifera&quot;, a giant silkmoth found in the eastern United States. Several generalist species use &quot;L. tulipifera&quot;. It is a well-known host for the large, green eggs of the &quot;Papilio glaucus&quot;, the eastern tiger swallowtail butterfly, which are known to lay their eggs exclusively among plants in the magnolia and rose families of plants, primarily in mid-late June through early August, in some states.

== Notable specimens ==

* The tallest individual at the present time (2021) is one called the Fork Ridge Tulip Tree at a secret location in the Great Smoky Mountains of North Carolina. Repeated measurements by laser and tape-drop have shown it to be in height.
* Walt Whitman in 1879 described a tulip tree near Woodstown, NJ whose trunk was 20 feet around with a cavity large enough so that, 25 years prior, 9 men ate dinner inside. Whitman assumed that by that time, in 1879, 12 to 15 men could stand within it.
* The Queens Giant is a tulip tree that is the oldest living thing in the New York Metropolitan area at 350–450 years old ( tall).

== Use ==
&quot;Liriodendron tulipifera&quot; is cultivated, and grows readily from seeds. These should be sown in fine soft soil in a cool and shady area. If sown in autumn they come up the succeeding spring, but if sown in spring they often remain a year in the ground. John Loudon noted that seeds from the highest branches of old trees are most likely to germinate. It is readily propagated from cuttings and easily transplanted.

=== In landscape ===
Tulip trees make magnificently shaped specimen trees, and are very large, growing to about in good soil. They grow best in deep well-drained loam which has thick dark topsoil. They show stronger response to fertilizer compounds (those with low salt index are preferred) than most other trees, but soil structure and organic matter content are more important. In the wild it is occasionally seen around serpentine outcrops. The southeastern coastal plain and east central Florida ecotypes occur in wet but &quot;not stagnant&quot; soils which are high in organic matter. All tulip trees are unreliable in clay flats which are subject to ponding and flooding.

Like other members of the Magnoliaceae family, they have fleshy roots that are easily broken if handled roughly. Transplanting should be done in early spring, before leaf-out; this timing is especially important in the more northern areas. Fall planting is often successful in Florida. The east central Florida ecotype may be more easily moved than other strains because its roots grow over nine or ten months every year—several months longer than other ecotypes. Most tulip trees have low tolerance of drought, although Florida natives (especially the east central ecotype) fare better than southeastern coastal plain or northern inland specimens.

It is recommended as a shade tree. The tree&#x27;s tall and rapid growth is a function of its shade intolerance. Grown in the full sun, the species tends to grow shorter, slower, and rounder, making it adaptable to landscape planting. In forest settings, most investment is made in the trunk (i.e., the branches are weak and easily break off, a sign of axial dominance) and lower branches are lost early as new, higher branches closer to the sun continue the growth spurt upward. A tree just 15 years old may already reach in height with no branches within reach of humans standing on the ground.

In the UK the species and its variegated cultivar &#x27;Aureomarginatum&#x27; have both gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

&quot;Liriodendron tulipifera&quot; has been introduced to many temperate parts of the world, at least as far north as Sykkylven, Norway and Arboretum Mustila, Finland. A few nurseries in Finland offer this species even though it is not fully hardy there and tends to be held to shrub form.

It is occasionally cultivated in tropical highlands, as in Costa Rica and Colombia. In the latter nation it is a street tree at Bogota.

=== Honey ===
Nectar is produced in the orange part of the flowers. The species is a significant honey plant in the eastern United States, yielding a dark reddish, fairly strong honey unsuitable for table honey but claimed to be favorably regarded by some bakers One 20-year-old tree produces enough nectar for of honey.

=== Wood ===
Though not a poplar at all, the soft, fine-grained wood of tulip trees is known by that name (short for yellow poplar) in the U.S., but marketed abroad as &quot;American tulipwood&quot; or by other names. It is very widely used where a cheap, easy-to-work and stable wood is needed. The sapwood is usually a creamy off-white color. While the heartwood is usually a pale green, it can take on streaks of red, purple, or even black; depending on the extractives content (i.e. the soil conditions where the tree was grown, etc.). It is clearly the wood of choice for use in organs, due to its ability to take a fine, smooth, precisely cut finish and so to effectively seal against pipes and valves. It is also commonly used for siding clapboards. Its wood may be compared in texture, strength, and softness to white pine.

Used for interior finish of houses, for siding, for panels of carriages, for coffin boxes, pattern timber, and wooden ware. During scarcity of the better qualities of white pine, tulip wood has taken its place to some extent, particularly when very wide boards are required.

It also has a reputation for being resistant to termites, and in the Upland South (and perhaps elsewhere) house and barn sills were often made of tulip wood beams.

Tulip poplar wood is one of the favorites for wood carvers Wilhelm Schimmel and Shields Landon Jones.

== In popular culture ==

* The tulip tree is a plot element in Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s short story &quot;The Gold-Bug&quot; (1843).
* Walt Whitman observed in 1876-77 a 70 foot tall tulip tree and how &quot;from top to bottom, seeking the sweet juice in the blossoms, it swarms with myriads of these wild bees, whose loud and steady humming makes an undertone to the whole.&quot; He referred to the tulip tree as &quot;the Apollo of the woods — tall and graceful, yet robust and sinewy, inimitable in hang of foliage and throwing-out of limb ; as if the beauteous, vital, leafy creature could walk, if it only would.&quot;
* The tulip tree has been referenced in many poems and the namesakes of other poems, such as William Stafford&#x27;s &quot;Tulip Tree&quot; (1964).

<text>The Geoemydidae (formerly known as Bataguridae) are one of the largest and most diverse families in the order Testudines (turtles), with about 70 species. The family includes the Eurasian pond and river turtles and Neotropical wood turtles.

==Characteristics==
Geoemydidae are turtles of various sizes (from about in length) with often a high degree of sexual dimorphism. They usually have webbed toes, and their pelvic girdles articulate with their plastrons flexibly. Their necks are drawn back vertically. Their carapaces have 24 marginal scutes. The plastron is composed of 12 scutes and has no mesoplastron; the pectoral and abdominal scutes contact the marginal scutes.

Some other features include a single articulation between the fifth and sixth cervical vertebrae, the lack of a hyomandibular branch of the facial nerve, and an epipterygoid bone in the skull.

==Ecology==
Geoemydidae live in tropics and subtropics of Asia, Europe and North Africa; the only genus in Central and South America is &quot;Rhinoclemmys&quot;. Their habitats include freshwater ecosystems, coastal marine areas, and tropical forests. Most are herbivorous, but some are omnivorous or carnivorous species. In mating, the males are usually much more active than females. A relatively small number of eggs per clutch is common, produced several times a year. Some species have a temperature-dependent sex determination system, while others possess different sex chromosomes; one known species (&quot;Siebenrockiella crassicolis&quot;) exhibits XX/XY sex determination, while another species (&quot;Pangshura smithii&quot;) exhibits ZZ/ZW sex determination.

About 70% of the extant species have been reported to be in endangered or vulnerable condition.

==Systematics and evolution==

Traditional systematics placed the geoemydids in the family Emydidae as the subfamily Batagurinae. In the 1980s, the subfamily was elevated to the family status and renamed to Geoemydidae according to the ICZN rules.

Most fossil and molecular data support their close relationship to the family Testudinidae.

The intrafamilial taxonomy is not well established yet, due to the large number and diversity of species. The family is usually divided into two subfamilies and 19 genera. Several species are known to give viable hybrids, which makes the systematics even more complicated.

==Conservation==
As of the early 2013, six species of the family Geoemydidae are on the CITES Appendix I, and 30 more are on the treaty&#x27;s Appendix II.
A joint China-US proposal for a March 2013 CITES participants&#x27; conference seeks to add 15 more Geoemydidae species to the convention&#x27;s Appendix II.

<text>William Andrew Pogany (born Vilmos András Feichtmann (or Feuchtmann); August 24, 1882 – July 30, 1955) was a prolific Hungarian illustrator of children&#x27;s and other books. His contemporaries include C. Coles Phillips, Joseph Clement Coll, Edmund Dulac, Harvey Dunn, Walter Hunt Everett, Harry Rountree, Sarah Stilwell Weber, and N.C. Wyeth. He is best known for his pen and ink drawings of myths and fables. A large portion of Pogany&#x27;s work is described as Art Nouveau. Pogany&#x27;s artistic style is heavily fairy-tale orientated and often feature motifs of mythical animals such as nymphs and pixies. He paid great attention to botanical details. He used dreamy and warm pastel scenes with watercolors, oil paintings, and especially pen and ink.

==Background==
Pogany was born in Szeged, Austria-Hungary as Vilmos Feichtmann (aka Feuchtmann) to Heléne (née Kolisch) and Joseph Feichtmann. He studied at Budapest Technical University and in Munich and Paris. He spent his early childhood with his brothers and sisters in a large farmhouse full of chickens, ducks, geese, dogs, pigs, and horses.

When he was six, his parents took him to Budapest where he would later be sent to school. He had early ambitions on becoming an engineer in the hopes of looking after his mother after his father died. He especially liked to row and to play soccer. In his spare time, he drew pictures and painted. He enjoyed painting and drawing so much he decided to be an artist. He attended Budapest Technical School for less than a year, during this time he took art classes for six weeks. He sold his first painting to a wealthy patron for $24. In 1903, both he and his sister Paula legally changed their surname to Pogány and the Szeged City Council requested the rabbinate to correct their registration in the official Jewish records.

He spent his early twenties attending art school and would later travel to Munich, Paris, and London before coming to the United States in 1914. When Pogany went to Paris to study and paint, he was unable to secure much attention or income, was often poor and went hungry. Pogany spent two years in Paris.
When he finally saved up some money from his work, he left Paris to go to London. In 1906, Arthur Rackham&#x27;s &quot;Rip Van Winkle&quot; gained massive popularity, sparking a demand for artists in London. At this point Pogany was hired to provide the design For &quot;The Welsh Fairy Book&quot; by T. Fisher Unwin, including over 100 plates, illustrations, vignettes, chapter heads and tails, and initials. He also did 48 illustrations for &quot;Milly and Olly&quot;, 70 for &quot;The Adventures of a Dodo&quot; and 39 for &quot;Faust&quot;.
After ten years in London, Pogany emigrated to America. Besides book illustration, pictures, mural paintings, portraits, etchings, and sculptures, Pogany became interested in theatre and designed stage settings and costumes for different shows and the Metropolitan Opera House. He eventually moved to Hollywood to serve as an art director for several film studios during the 1930s and 1940s.

==Career==

In London, he crafted his quartet of masterpieces: The Rime of the Ancient Mariner (1910), Tannhauser (1911), Parsifal (1912) and Lohengrin (1913). Each of these was designed completely by Pogany, from the covers and endpapers to the text written in pen and ink, pencil, wash, color and tipped-on plates.

The Ancient Mariner, a large book 9.5&quot; by 11.75&quot;. is recognized as his masterpiece. Each page has at least two colors, sometimes with gilt plate accompanied by intricate borders. The initials are elaborate, starting each page and with ornate capitals at the beginning of every line. The illuminated title page, 18 color plates, the second color through black-and-white plates, the flowing calligraphic text, and the pen-and-ink drawings throughout the pages make this a stand out among Pogany&#x27;s works.

The Rime&#x27;s beauty is accentuated by its soft ivory paper and subtle lavender borders. The three gray stocks on Wagner&#x27;s book add depth towards his presentation.

In Lohengrin, Pogany set his soft color pencil drawings against the grays.
In Tannhauser, Pogany used paper color for further additional dimension.
From soft pastel pencil drawings to watercolor paintings and pen and ink, Pogany utilized a variety of media in his illustrations.

Pogany&#x27;s beautiful and bizarre illustrations for Padraic Colum&#x27;s The King of Ireland&#x27;s Son use brilliant color and startlingly modern styles of seeing to show the magical journey of the hero, his beloved Fedelma and the second hero Flann. A horse-headed giant has the great patient head of a Clydesdale plough horse; a girl bathes naked while the hero steals the swan skin that would allow her to transform and take flight, the young man leads a fine steed with Fedelma mounted on it as they are attacked by a cloud of crows – strange, dreamy, beautiful images.

Pogany worked as an art director on several Hollywood films, including &quot;Fashions of 1934&quot; and &quot;Dames&quot;. He began his involvement in motion picture set design in 1924 and worked in film until the end of the 1930s. He was commissioned by John Ringling, Ettenger, Reiner and William Randolph Hearst&#x27;s Wyntoon Estate, painted for the Barrymore family, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Carole Lombard, Enrico Caruso, Miriam Hopkins, and many others. In 1939, Pogany designed an animated cartoon, &quot;Scrambled Eggs (1939 film)&quot;, based on a story by his wife Elaine, for producer Walter Lantz. The star character of the Lantz cartoon, Peterkin, became the title character of a children&#x27;s book the Poganys released the next year.

Pogany was awarded gold medals in Budapest and Leipzig Expo as well as the London Masonic Medal, and became a Fellow of the London Royal Society of Art. The New York Society of Architects gave him a silver medal for his mural in the August Heckscher&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Theatre showing Cinderella, Hansel and Gretel, and Jack in the Beanstalk. He won a gold medal in 1915 at the Panama Pacific Expo for his work The ValCares. and was also awarded the Hungarian Silver Blue Medal.

In 1914, Pogany&#x27;s illustrations appeared on the cover of Metropolitan Magazine, Ladies Home Journal, Harper&#x27;s Weekly, Hearst&#x27;s Town and Country, Theatre Magazine and American Weekly. In 1917 to 1921, he worked for the Metropolitan Opera designing sketches, scenery and costumes. In 1918 he illustrated a children&#x27;s retelling of Homer, &quot;The Adventures of Odysseus and the Tale of Troy&quot; written by Padraic Colum.

==Lawsuit==
In his 1952 autobiography &quot;Witness&quot;, Whittaker Chambers erroneously described &quot;Willi Pogany&quot; (&quot;long a scene designer at the Metropolitan Opera House&quot;) as the brother of Joseph Pogany.

Willy Pogany sued Chambers for $1 million but lost in court and appeals. According to &quot;Time&quot; magazine, &quot;A lower court had found that Chambers, in his mistaken identification, had not maliciously implied that Willy was closely associated with &#x27;a Communist leader and spy&#x27;,&quot; who had been &quot;once (until Stalin liquidated him) Communist Hungary&#x27;s puppet Commissar of War.&quot;

==Personal life==
Pogany married Lillian Rose Doris in 1908 in London, and had two sons with her: Peter and John Pogany. They moved to New York City in 1914 and he was naturalized in 1921. In 1933 they divorced. The following year, he married writer Elaine Cox. He died in New York City on July 30, 1955.

Asked how his name was pronounced, he told the &quot;Literary Digest&quot; that in America it was po-GAH-ny. &quot;However, in my native Hungary this name is pronounced with the accent on the first syllable with a slightly shorter &quot;o&quot; and the &quot;gany&quot; is as the French &quot;-gagne&quot; (the &quot;y&quot; is silent)&quot;: PO-gahn.

==Works==
Pogany&#x27;s public art appears on walls of the John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art (formerly Ringling Mansion) in Sarasota, Florida, in New York City at the El Museo del Barrio theater (1230 Fifth Avenue), P.S. 43 Jonas Bronck in Mott Haven, and the Bernard B. Jacobs Theatre (45th Street) and in The Strand Theatre at The Appell Center for the Performing Arts in York, PA.

<doc id="322551" wikidata="Q390835" url="?curid=322551" title="Emydidae">
<text>Emydidae (Latin &quot;emys&quot; (freshwater tortoise) + Ancient Greek εἶδος (&quot;eîdos&quot;, “appearance, resemblance”)) is a family of testudines (turtles) that includes close to 50 species in 10 genera. Members of this family are commonly called terrapins, pond turtles, or marsh turtles. Several species of Asian box turtles were formerly classified in the family; however, revised taxonomy has separated them to a different family (Geoemydidae). As currently defined, the Emydidae are entirely a Western Hemisphere family, with the exception of two species of pond turtle.

==Description==

The upper shell (carapace) of most emydids is the shape of a low arch, although in some species, it is domed. The upper shell may have one or two ridges that run from front to the back of the animal (a projection commonly called a &quot;keel&quot;), or such a feature may be absent. A prominent bridge often connects the top shell to the bottom shell (plastron). Emydids have large bottom shells, and some members of the family have a movable hinge that separates pectoral and abdominal segments (scutes). The skull is small.

The limbs of these turtles are adapted for swimming, with every member having some level of toe webbing.

Most species exhibit temperature-dependent sex determination, as is typical of turtles; however, one species (the wood turtle) is known to have genetic sex determination.

==Behavior==
Food habits range from strictly carnivorous to strictly herbivorous. The carnivores feed on annelids, crustaceans, and fish. In several species, a shift from carnivory in juveniles to herbivory in adults occurs. Small mammals, especially raccoons, are responsible for the destruction of many emydid nests. The wide range of sizes in mature animals leads to an assortment of predators. While snapping turtles are responsible for predation in some smaller species (e.g., &quot;Glyptemys muhlenbergii&quot;), they cannot eat larger species. Alligators pose a risk to adults of several species.

Knowledge of reproductive behavior ranges from some of the most detailed, long-term study of any taxon (&quot;Chrysemys picta&quot; in Michigan) to a total lack of information. In many species, dimorphisms include elongated foreclaws or a concave plastron in the male. The longer claws are used in a courtship routine in which the male faces the female and fans her face. The concave plastron allows the male to mount females in species with more domed carapaces (e.g., &quot;Terrapene&quot;). Reproduction is on an annual cycle, and multiple clutches may be produced in a single season. Clutch size is quite variable, ranging from as few as two to more than 30 eggs.

==Threats==
Emydids are the turtles most commonly sold through the pet trade. The pond slider (&quot;Trachemys scripta&quot;) has expanded its range through the careless release of pets into the wild. Many Asian species are threatened by over-collection of animals for sale in markets and into the pet trade. The North American species &quot;Clemmys muhlenbergii&quot; is listed as an Appendix II species by CITES and is considered threatened or endangered in many states. This status is the result of habitat degradation and over-collection.

==Systematics and evolution==

The Emydidae are most closely related to the tortoises (Testudinidae) and are included along with that family in the Testudinoidea. Shared features include a lack of inframarginal scutes, the shape and muscle attachment of the ilium, and the shape of the eighth cervical vertebra (biconvex). Within the Emydidae, two subfamilies were recognized along biogeographic lines. The Emydidae as understood today contain New World species (except &quot;Emys&quot;), while the former Batagurinae, today a separate family Geoemydidae, contain Old World species (except &quot;Rhinoclemmys&quot;). Osteological characters, such as the construction of the mandible and articulations of the cervical vertebrae distinguish the two families.

The enigmatic big-headed turtle (&quot;Platysternon megacephalum&quot;) was for some time considered a specialized, but still very primitive early offshoot of the Emydidae. With the Geoemydidae being split off, though, it is better reinstated as its own family, the Platysternidae, though it seems very close to the emydid-geoemydid group.

===Fossil record===
Presumed emydids are well represented in the fossil record. &quot;Gyremys sectabilis&quot; and &quot;Clemmys backmani&quot; are both North American species that date from the Upper Cretaceous and Paleocene, respectively. These are the two oldest fossil species. Many other extinct species traditionally placed in the Emydidae are known from the Eocene of North America, Asia, and Europe, but the Old World taxa are likely to be more properly Geoemydidae. The North American genus &quot;Palaeochelys&quot; and probably the trans-Atlantic &quot;Echmatemys&quot;, too, would seem to be Emydidae, but their precise relationships to the living genera are indeterminate.

===Classification===
The two subfamilies and genera are arranged as follows:
*Subfamily Emydinae
**&quot;Clemmys&quot;
**&quot;Emys&quot; 
**&quot;Actinemys&quot;
**&quot;Emydoidea&quot;

<doc id="322553" wikidata="Q189389" url="?curid=322553" title="Aneurysm">
<text>An aneurysm is an outward bulging, likened to a bubble or balloon, caused by a localized, abnormal, weak spot on a blood vessel wall. Aneurysms may be a result of a hereditary condition or an acquired disease. Aneurysms can also be a (starting point) for clot formation (thrombosis) and embolization. As an aneurysm increases in size, the risk of rupture, which leads to uncontrolled bleeding, increases. Although they may occur in any blood vessel, particularly lethal examples include aneurysms of the circle of Willis in the brain, aortic aneurysms affecting the thoracic aorta, and abdominal aortic aneurysms. Aneurysms can arise in the heart itself following a heart attack, including both ventricular and atrial septal aneurysms. There are congenital atrial septal aneurysms, a rare heart defect.

==Etymology==
The word is from Greek: ἀνεύρυσμα, aneurysma, &quot;dilation&quot;, from ἀνευρύνειν, aneurynein, &quot;to dilate&quot;.

==Classification==
Aneurysms are classified by type, morphology, or location.

===True and false aneurysms===
A true aneurysm is one that involves all three layers of the wall of an artery (intima, media and adventitia). True aneurysms include atherosclerotic, syphilitic, and congenital aneurysms, as well as ventricular aneurysms that follow transmural myocardial infarctions (aneurysms that involve all layers of the attenuated wall of the heart are also considered true aneurysms).

A false aneurysm, or pseudoaneurysm, is a collection of blood leaking completely out of an artery or vein but confined next to the vessel by the surrounding tissue. This blood-filled cavity will eventually either thrombose (clot) enough to seal the leak or rupture out of the surrounding tissue.

Pseudoaneurysms can be caused by trauma that punctures the artery, such as knife and bullet wounds, as a result of surgical procedures such as coronary angiography or arterial grafting, or use of an artery for injection.

===Morphology===

Aneurysms can also be classified by their macroscopic shapes and sizes and are described as either saccular or fusiform. The shape of an aneurysm is not specific for a specific disease. The size of the base or neck is useful in determining the chance of for example endovascular coiling.

Saccular aneurysms, or &quot;berry&quot; aneurysms, are spherical in shape and involve only a portion of the vessel wall; they usually range from in diameter, and are often filled, either partially or fully, by a thrombus.Saccular aneurysms have a &quot;neck&quot; that connects the aneurysm to its main (&quot;parent&quot;) artery, a larger, rounded area, called the dome.

Fusiform aneurysms (&quot;spindle-shaped&quot; aneurysms) are variable in both their diameter and length; their diameters can extend up to . They often involve large portions of the ascending and transverse aortic arch, the abdominal aorta, or, less frequently, the iliac arteries.

===Location===
Aneurysms can also be classified by their location:

* Arterial and venous, with arterial being more common.
* The heart, including coronary artery aneurysms, ventricular aneurysms, aneurysm of sinus of Valsalva, and aneurysms following cardiac surgery.
* The aorta, namely aortic aneurysms including thoracic aortic aneurysms and abdominal aortic aneurysms.
* The brain, including cerebral aneurysms, berry aneurysms, and Charcot–Bouchard aneurysms.
* The legs, including the popliteal arteries.
* The kidney, including renal artery aneurysms and intraparenchymal aneurysms.
* Capillary aneurysms are flesh-colored solitary lesions, resembling an intradermal nevus, which may suddenly grow larger and darker and become blue-black or black as a result of thrombosis.
* The large vessels such as external and internal jugular veins

Cerebral aneurysms, also known as intracranial or brain aneurysms, occur most commonly in the anterior cerebral artery, which is part of the circle of Willis. This can cause severe strokes leading to death. The next most common sites of cerebral aneurysm occurrence are in the internal carotid artery.

===Size===

Abdominal aortic aneurysms are commonly divided according to their size and symptomatology. An aneurysm is usually defined as an outer aortic diameter over 3 cm (normal diameter of the aorta is around 2 cm), or more than 50% of normal diameter that of a healthy individual of the same sex and age. If the outer diameter exceeds 5.5 cm, the aneurysm is considered to be large.

The common iliac artery is classified as:
==Signs and symptoms==
Aneurysm presentation may range from life-threatening complications of hypovolemic shock to being found incidentally on X-ray. Symptoms will differ by the site of the aneurysm and can include:

===Cerebral aneurysm===

Symptoms can occur when the aneurysm pushes on a structure in the brain. Symptoms will depend on whether an aneurysm has ruptured or not. There may be no symptoms present at all until the aneurysm ruptures. For an aneurysm that has not ruptured the following symptoms can occur:
* Fatigue
* Loss of perception
* Loss of balance
* Speech problems
* Double vision
For a ruptured aneurysm, symptoms of a subarachnoid hemorrhage may present:
* Severe headaches
* Loss of vision
* Double vision
* Neck pain or stiffness
* Pain above or behind the eyes

===Abdominal aneurysm===

Abdominal aortic aneurysm involves a regional dilation of the aorta and is diagnosed using ultrasonography, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging. A segment of the aorta that is found to be greater than 50% larger than that of a healthy individual of the same sex and age is considered aneurysmal. Abdominal aneurysms are usually asymptomatic but in rare cases can cause lower back pain or lower limb ischemia.

===Renal (kidney) aneurysm===
* Flank pain and tenderness
* Hypertension
* Haematuria
* Signs of hypovolemic shock

==Risk factors==
Risk factors for an aneurysm include diabetes, obesity, hypertension, tobacco use, alcoholism, high cholesterol, copper deficiency, increasing age, and tertiary syphilis infection. Connective tissue disorders such as Loeys-Dietz syndrome, Marfan syndrome, and certain forms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome are also associated with aneurysms. Aneurysms, dissections, and ruptures in individuals under 40 years of age are a major diagnostic criteria of the vascular form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (vEDS).

Specific infective causes associated with aneurysm include:
* Advanced syphilis infection resulting in syphilitic aortitis and an aortic aneurysm
* Tuberculosis, causing Rasmussen&#x27;s aneurysms
* Brain infections, causing infectious intracranial aneurysms

A minority of aneurysms are associated with genetic factors. Examples include:
* Berry aneurysms of the anterior communicating artery of the circle of Willis, associated with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease
* Familial thoracic aortic aneurysms
* Cirsoid aneurysms, secondary to congenital arteriovenous malformations

==Pathophysiology==
Aneurysms form for a variety of interacting reasons. Multiple factors, including factors affecting a blood vessel wall and the blood through the vessel, contribute.

The pressure of blood within the expanding aneurysm may also injure the blood vessels supplying the artery itself, further weakening the vessel wall. Without treatment, these aneurysms will ultimately progress and rupture.

Infection. A mycotic aneurysm is an aneurysm that results from an infectious process that involves the arterial wall. A person with a mycotic aneurysm has a bacterial infection in the wall of an artery, resulting in the formation of an aneurysm. One of the causes of mycotic aneurysms is infective endocarditis. The most common locations include arteries in the abdomen, thigh, neck, and arm. A mycotic aneurysm can result in sepsis, or life-threatening bleeding if the aneurysm ruptures. Less than 3% of abdominal aortic aneurysms are mycotic aneurysms.

Syphilis. The third stage of syphilis also manifests as aneurysm of the aorta, which is due to loss of the vasa vasorum in the tunica adventitia.

Copper deficiency. A minority of aneurysms are caused by copper deficiency, which results in a decreased activity of the lysyl oxidase enzyme, affecting elastin, a key component in vessel walls. Copper deficiency results in vessel wall thinning, and thus has been noted as a cause of death in copper-deficient humans, chickens, and turkeys.

=== Mechanics ===
Aneurysmal blood vessels are prone to rupture under normal blood pressure and flow due to the special mechanical properties that make them weaker. To better understand this phenomenon, we can first look at healthy arterial vessels which exhibit (for a biomaterial &quot;in vivo&quot;). Unlike crystalline materials whose linear elastic region follows Hooke&#x27;s Law under uniaxial loading, many biomaterials exhibit a J-shaped stress-strain curve which is non-linear and concave up. The blood vessel can be under large strain, or the amount of stretch the blood vessel can undergo, for a range of low applied stress before fracture, as shown by the lower part of the curve. The area under the curve up to a given strain is much lower than that for the equivalent Hookean curve, which is correlated to toughness. Toughness is defined as the amount of energy per unit volume material can absorb before rupturing. Because the amount of energy released is proportional to the amount of crack propagation, the blood vessel wall can withstand pressure and is &quot;tough&quot;. Thus, healthy blood vessels with the mechanical properties of the J-shaped stress-strain curve have greater stability against aneurysms than materials with linear elasticity.

Blood vessels with aneurysms, on the other hand, are under the influence of an S-shaped stress-strain curve. As a visual aid, aneurysms can be understood as a long, cylindrical balloon. Because it&#x27;s a tight balloon under pressure, it can pop at any time stress beyond a certain force threshold is applied. In the same vein, an unhealthy blood vessel has elastic instabilities that lead to rupture. Initially, for a given radius and pressure, stiffness of the material increases linearly. At a certain point, the stiffness of the arterial wall starts to decrease with increasing load. At higher strain values, the area under the curve increases, thus increasing the impact on the material that would promote crack propagation. The differences in the mechanical properties of the aneurysmal blood vessels and the healthy blood vessels stem from the compositional differences of the vessels. Compared to normal aortas, aneurysmal aortas have a much higher volume fraction of collagen and ground substance (54.8% vs. 95.6%) and a much lower volume fraction of elastin (22.7% vs. 2.4%) and smooth muscles (22.6% vs. 2.2%), which contribute to higher initial stiffness. It was also found that the ultimate tensile strength, or the strength to withstand rupture, of aneurysmal vessel wall is 50% lower than that of normal aortas. The wall strength of ruptured aneurysmal aortic wall was also found to be 54.2 N/cm2, which is much lower than that of a repaired aorta wall, 82.3 N/cm2. Due to the change in composition of the arterial wall, aneurysms overall have much lower strength to resist rupture. Predicting the risk of rupture is difficult due to the regional anisotropy the hardened blood vessels exhibit, meaning that the stress and strength values vary depending on the region and the direction of the vessel they are measured along.

==Diagnosis==

Diagnosis of a ruptured cerebral aneurysm is commonly made by finding signs of subarachnoid hemorrhage on a computed tomography (CT) scan. If the CT scan is negative but a ruptured aneurysm is still suspected based on clinical findings, a lumbar puncture can be performed to detect blood in the cerebrospinal fluid. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) is an alternative to traditional angiography and can be performed without the need for arterial catheterization. This test combines a regular CT scan with a contrast dye injected into a vein. Once the dye is injected into a vein, it travels to the cerebral arteries, and images are created using a CT scan. These images show exactly how blood flows into the brain arteries.

==Treatment==
Historically, the treatment of arterial aneurysms has been limited to either surgical intervention or watchful waiting in combination with control of blood pressure. At least, in the case of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), the decision does not come without significant risk and cost, hence, there is a great interest in identifying more advanced decision-making approaches that are not solely based on the AAA diameter, but involve other geometrical and mechanical nuances such as local thickness and wall stress. In recent years, endovascular or minimally invasive techniques have been developed for many types of aneurysms. Aneurysm clips are used for surgical procedure i.e. clipping of aneurysms.

=== Intracranial ===

There are currently two treatment options for brain aneurysms: surgical clipping or endovascular coiling. There is currently debate in the medical literature about which treatment is most appropriate given particular situations.

Surgical clipping was introduced by Walter Dandy of the Johns Hopkins Hospital in 1937. It consists of a craniotomy to expose the aneurysm and closing the base or neck of the aneurysm with a clip. The surgical technique has been modified and improved over the years.

Endovascular coiling was introduced by Italian neurosurgeon Guido Guglielmi at UCLA in 1989. It consists of passing a catheter into the femoral artery in the groin, through the aorta, into the brain arteries, and finally into the aneurysm itself. Platinum coils initiate a clotting reaction within the aneurysm that, if successful, fills the aneurysm dome and prevents its rupture. A flow diverter can be used, but risks complications.

===Aortic and peripheral===
For aneurysms in the aorta, arms, legs, or head, the weakened section of the vessel may be replaced by a bypass graft that is sutured at the vascular stumps. Instead of sewing, the graft tube ends, made rigid and expandable by nitinol wireframe, can be easily inserted in its reduced diameter into the vascular stumps and then expanded up to the most appropriate diameter and permanently fixed there by external ligature. New devices were recently developed to substitute the external ligature by expandable ring allowing use in acute ascending aorta dissection, providing airtight (i.e. not dependent on the coagulation integrity), easy and quick anastomosis extended to the arch concavity Less invasive endovascular techniques allow covered metallic stent grafts to be inserted through the arteries of the leg and deployed across the aneurysm.

===Renal===
Renal aneurysms are very rare consisting of only 0.1–0.09% while rupture is even more rare. Conservative treatment with control of concomitant hypertension being the primary option with aneurysms smaller than 3 cm. If symptoms occur, or enlargement of the aneurysm, then endovascular or open repair should be considered. Pregnant women (due to high rupture risk of up to 80%) should be treated surgically.

== Epidemiology ==
Incidence rates of cranial aneurysms are estimated at between 0.4% and 3.6%. Those without risk factors have expected prevalence of 2–3%. In adults, females are more likely to have aneurysms. They are most prevalent in people ages 35 – 60 but can occur in children as well. Aneurysms are rare in children with a reported prevalence of .5% to 4.6%. The most common incidence is among 50-year-olds, and there are typically no warning signs. Most aneurysms develop after the age of 40. 

===Pediatric aneurysms===
Pediatric aneurysms have different incidences and features than adult aneurysms. Intracranial aneurysms are rare in childhood, with over 95% of all aneurysms occurring in adults.

===Risk factors===
Incidence rates are two to three times higher in males, while there are more large and giant aneurysms and fewer multiple aneurysms. Intracranial hemorrhages are 1.6 times more likely to be due to aneurysms than cerebral arteriovenous malformations in whites, but four times less in certain Asian populations.

Most patients, particularly infants, present with subarachnoid hemorrhage and corresponding headaches or neurological deficits. The mortality rate for pediatric aneurysms is lower than in adults.

=== Modeling ===

Modeling of aneurysms consists of creating a 3D model that mimics a particular aneurysm. Using patient data for the blood velocity, and blood pressure, along with the geometry of the aneurysm, researchers can apply computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to predict whether an aneurysm is benign or if it is at risk of complication. One risk is rupture. Analyzing the velocity and pressure profiles of the blood flow leads to obtaining the resulting wall shear stress on the vessel and aneurysm wall. The neck of the aneurysm is the most at risk due to the combination of a small wall thickness and high wall shear stress. When the wall shear stress reaches its limit, the aneurysm ruptures, leading to intracranial hemorrhage. Conversely, another risk of aneurysms is the creation of clots. Aneurysms create a pocket which diverts blood flow. This diverted blood flow creates a vortex inside of the aneurysm. This vortex can lead to areas inside of the aneurysm where the blood flow is stagnant, which promotes formations of clots. Blood clots can dislodge from the aneurysm, which can then lead to an embolism when the clot gets stuck and disrupts blood flow. Model analysis allows these risky aneurysms to be identified and treated.

In the past, aneurysms were modeled as rigid spheres with linear inlets and outlets. As technology advances, the ability to detect and analyze aneurysms becomes easier. Researchers are able to CT scan a patient&#x27;s body to create a 3D computer model that possesses the correct geometry. Aneurysms can now be modeled with their distinctive &quot;balloon&quot; shape. Nowadays researchers are optimizing the parameters required to accurately model a patient&#x27;s aneurysm that will lead to a successful intervention. Current modeling is not able to take into account all variables though. For example, blood is considered to be a non-Newtonian fluid. Some researchers treat blood as a Newtonian fluid instead, as it sometimes has negligible effects to the analysis in large vessels. When analyzing small vessels though, such as those present in intracranial aneurysms. Similarly, sometimes it is difficult to model the varying wall thickness in small vessels, so researchers treat wall thickness as constant. Researchers make these assumptions to reduce computational time. Nonetheless, making erroneous assumptions could lead to a misdiagnosis that could put a patient&#x27;s life at risk.

<text>Ectasia (), also called ectasis (), is dilation or distention of a tubular structure, either normal or pathophysiologic but usually the latter (except in atelectasis, where absence of ectasis is the problem).

==Specific conditions==

* Bronchiectasis, chronic dilatation of the bronchi
* Duct ectasia of breast, a dilated milk duct. Duct ectasia syndrome is a synonym for nonpuerperal (unrelated to pregnancy and breastfeeding) mastitis.
* Dural ectasia, dilation of the dural sac surrounding the spinal cord, usually in the very low back.
* Pyelectasis, dilation of a part of the kidney, most frequently seen in prenatal ultrasounds. It usually resolves on its own.
* Rete tubular ectasia, dilation of tubular structures in the testicles. It is usually found in older men.
* Corneal ectasia (secondary keratoconus), a bulging of the cornea.

;Vascular ectasias
* Most broadly, any abnormal dilatation of a blood vessel, including aneurysms
* Annuloaortic ectasia, dilation of the aorta. It can be associated with Marfan syndrome.
* Dolichoectasias, weakening of arteries, usually caused by high blood pressure.
* Intracranial dolichoectasias, dilation of arteries inside the head.
* Gastric antral vascular ectasia, dilation of small blood vessels in the last part of the stomach.
* Telangiectasias are small dilated blood vessels found anywhere on the body, but commonly seen on the face around the nose, cheeks, and chin.
* Venous ectasia, dilation of veins or venules, such as:
** Chronic venous insufficiency, often in the leg
** Jugular vein ectasia, in the jugular veins returning blood from the head

<text>Trionychidae is a family of turtles, commonly known as softshell turtles or simply softshells. The family was described by Leopold Fitzinger in 1826. Softshells include some of the world&#x27;s largest freshwater turtles, though many can adapt to living in highly brackish waters. Members of this family occur in Africa, Asia, and North America, with extinct species known from Australia. Most species have traditionally been included in the genus &quot;Trionyx&quot;, but the vast majority have since been moved to other genera. Among these are the North American &quot;Apalone&quot; softshells that were placed in &quot;Trionyx&quot; until 1987.

==Characteristics==
Turtles of the family Trionychidae are called &quot;softshell&quot; because their carapaces lack horny scutes (scales), though the spiny softshell, &quot;Apalone spinifera&quot;, does have some scale-like projections, to which its common name refers. The carapace is leathery and pliable, particularly at the sides. The central part of the carapace has a layer of solid bone beneath it, as in other turtles, but this is absent at the outer edges. Some species also have dermal bones in the plastron, but these are not attached to the bones of the shell. The light and flexible shell of these turtles allows them to move more easily in open water or in muddy lake bottoms. Having a soft shell also allows them to move much faster on land than most turtles. Their feet are webbed and three-clawed, hence the family name &quot;Trionychidae,&quot; which means &quot;three-clawed&quot;. The carapace color of each type of softshell turtle tends to match the sand or mud color of its geographical region, assisting in their &quot;lie in wait&quot; feeding methodology.

These turtles have many characteristics pertaining to their aquatic lifestyle. Many must be submerged in order to swallow their food. They have elongated, soft, snorkel-like nostrils. Their necks are disproportionately long in comparison to their body sizes, enabling them to breathe surface air while their bodies remain submerged in the substrate (mud or sand) a foot or more below the surface.

Females can grow up to several feet in carapace diameter, while males stay much smaller; this is their main form of sexual dimorphism. &quot;Pelochelys cantorii&quot;, found in southeastern Asia, is the largest softshell turtle.
Most are strict carnivores, with diets consisting mainly of fish, aquatic crustaceans, snails, amphibians, and sometimes birds and small mammals.

Softshells are able to &quot;breathe&quot; underwater with rhythmic movements of their mouth cavity, which contains numerous processes copiously supplied with blood, acting similarly to gill filaments in fish. This enables them to stay underwater for prolonged periods. Moreover, the Chinese softshell turtle has been shown to excrete urea while &quot;breathing&quot; underwater; this is an efficient solution when the animal does not have access to fresh water, e.g., in brackish-water environments.

According to Ditmars (1910): &quot;The mandibles of many species form the outer border of powerful crushing processes—the alveolar surfaces of the jaws&quot;, which aids the ingestion of tough prey such as molluscs. These jaws make large turtles dangerous, as they are capable of amputating a person&#x27;s finger, or possibly their hand.

Unlike the temperature-dependent sex determination of most turtles, Trionychids have ZZ/ZW genetic sex determination; microchromosomes play a role in determining sex.

== As food ==
=== In East Asia ===
Softshell turtles are eaten as a delicacy in most parts of their range, particularly in East Asia. A Chinese dish stews them with chicken. According to a 1930 report by Soame Jenyns, Guangdong restaurants had them imported from Guangxi in large numbers; &quot;eaten stewed with almonds, roast with chili sauce or fried with bamboo shoots, they [were] considered a great delicacy.&quot;

Worldwide, the most commonly consumed softshell species is the Chinese softshell &quot;Pelodiscus sinensis&quot;. As a noted Japanese biologist pointed out in 1904, the Japanese variety of this turtle, which at time was classified as &quot;Trionyx japonicus&quot;, occupied a place in Japanese cuisine as esteemed as the diamondback terrapin in the United States or the green turtle in England. The farming of this &quot;luscious reptile&quot;, known in Japan as &quot;suppon&quot;, was already developed on an industrial scale in that country by the late 19th century.

Due to rising demand and overhunting, the price of &quot;Pelodiscus sinensis&quot; in China skyrocketed by the mid-1990s; large-scale turtle farming in China and neighboring countries; raising this species by hundreds of millions was the response, with prices soon returning to a more affordable level. Another species, &quot;Palea steindachneri&quot;, is farmed in China, as well, but on a much smaller scale (with farm herds measured in hundreds of thousands, rather than hundreds of millions).

=== In the United States ===
In the United States, harvesting softshells (e.g. &quot;Apalone ferox&quot;) was, until recently, legal in Florida. Environmental groups have been advocating the authorities&#x27; banning or restricting the practice. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission responded by introducing the daily limit of 20 turtles for licensed harvesters—a level which the turtle advocates consider unsustainable, as there may be between 100 and 500 hunters statewide. While some catch was consumed locally, most was exported; the Commission estimated (2008) around 3,000 pounds of softshell turtles were exported to China each week via Tampa International Airport.

New rules, in effect as of July 20, 2009, restrict collecting any wild turtles to one turtle per person per day, completely prohibit collection of softshells (&quot;Apalone&quot;) in May through July, and prohibit trade in turtles caught from the wild. An exemption is provided for licensed turtle farms that need to catch turtles in the wild to serve as their breeding stock.

Some other US states, too, have already adopted strict limitations on wild turtle trade. In 2009, South Carolina passed a law (Bill H.3121) restricting interstate and international export of wild-caught turtles (both soft-shell and some other species) to 10 turtles per person at one time, and 20 turtles per person per year.

<text>The hickatee (Dermatemys mawii) or in Spanish tortuga blanca (&#x27;white turtle&#x27;), also called the Central American river turtle, is the only living species in the family Dermatemydidae. The species is found in the Atlantic drainages of Central America, specifically Belize, Guatemala, southern Mexico,and probably Honduras. It is a relatively large-bodied species, with records of straight carapace length and weights of ; although most individuals are smaller. This is a herbivorous and almost completely aquatic turtle that does not even surface to bask. Bizarrely for reptiles, the eggs can remain viable even after being underwater for weeks -in the recent past, some scientists mistakenly claimed it nests underwater, likely due to visiting Central America during a frequent flood, when nests are often submerged.

In the culture of the Ancient Mayan civilisation this species and turtles in general had numerous uses such as being used in warfare, as musical instruments and as food, with this species likely being consumed by the elites during feasts. The Maya probably exported these turtles to areas where they do not occur, based on their shell remains in kitchen middens. There is genetic evidence that the Mayans and other ancient peoples may have hunted the turtle to local extinction in areas it now occurs in, and that some modern turtle populations stem from turtles introduced into waterways from elsewhere. The turtle also had mythological symbolism, although the true nature of Ancient Mayan myth has been largely obscured by time. Among the modern communities inheriting this land the turtle continues to be eagerly sought as a dish eaten during important cultural events. The meat of this turtle is said to be very tasty. It has thus had a long history of exploitation.

This has prompted Western conservationists to declare this use unsustainable, and that the turtle is now &#x27;critically endangered&#x27;, especially singling out the people of Tabasco as the culprits. In Belize, the only country where it is still legal to hunt these animals, it is still common in some areas, but populations are depressed in areas where people live. In Mexico the state of the population is unclear -it was said to be almost extirpated from Mexico in 2006 based on an entry in a book from the 1970s, but reasonable amounts are still caught in areas such as Tabasco and Quintana Roo. In Guatemala the species is abundant in some areas, but uncommon elsewhere.

Although in the 1990s scientists dismissed breeding this species as impracticable, it is now known they can reproduce in even quite poor waters, and as a generalist herbivorous species fodder costs are low. Much has been discovered regarding their animal husbandry, with some US scientists now musing that commercial breeding might be cost effective using experimental polyculture systems with the turtles as a secondary income source. The Mexican government already stimulated the farming of this species in the 2000s, there are now likely a few thousand kept in captivity there. The health of these captive animals is not ideal, and the success of these operations is unclear.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Dermatemys mawii&quot; is the only living species in the family Dermatemydidae. Its closest relatives are only known from fossils with some 19 genera described from a worldwide distribution in the Jurassic and Cretaceous.

===Etymology===
The specific name, &quot;mawii&quot;, is in honour of the collector of the type specimen, Lieutenant Mawe of the British Navy.

This species is usually vernacularly called &quot;tortuga blanca&quot; in Spanish, because it can be readily distinguished when prepared as food. When the meat of this turtle is cooked, it turns a white colour, unlike the more common turtle meat (&quot;Trachemys scripta&quot;), which colours dark.

===Genetics===
Many species sharing a similar distribution have phylogeographic structure revealed in their genomes, with the population often being split into at least three subgroups representing the three main Atlantic hydrological basins of this region, the Papaloapan, Coatzacoalcos and Grijalva-Usumacinta. A 2011 study of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of extant populations throughout the range of this species, however, revealed a less clear differentiation. Although some genetic structure was evident, most locations showed a high rate of mixing of different lineages, with two main closely related mitochondrial haplotypes dominating the population. Three divergent mitochondrial lineages were found: an extremely rare one dubbed &#x27;1D&#x27; only found in four samples from Sarstún and Salinas on the southeast edge of the Grijalva-Usumacinta basin, a second northernmost &#x27;Papaloapan&#x27; lineage restricted to the Papaloapan basin in the state of Veracruz, to the west of the Sierra de Santa Marta and the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, and a third widespread &#x27;central&#x27; lineage that was found in all studied localities. It appeared as if a formerly clear phylogeographical pattern had been obscured by transport and introductions of turtle populations from one waterway to another, i.e. secondary blurring by large-scale gene flow between populations. Low haplotype diversity at some localities indicated prehistoric population bottlenecks, possibly after a drastic cull from over-harvesting, followed by population expansions. As it is almost certain the Ancient Maya were engaged in long distance trade in this turtle species and consumed large amounts, it was deemed most probable that the Maya were responsible for this (see section on interaction with humans below). Even today, turtles have been found trapped in small isolated ponds (called &quot;aguadas&quot; in Guatemala) where they would be unlikely to naturally disperse to, or in areas they do not naturally occur, likely moved there by people in order to harvest them at a later date.

Although most haplotypes were relatively closely related, there was one highly divergent haplotype which only showed up in four samples from Sarstún and Salinas, divergent enough to represent a possible new hyper-critically endangered cryptic species. Hydrological reproductive barriers between populations may have led to the main lineages splitting in the Pliocene to Pleistocene (3.73–0.227 million years ago), generally enough time to accumulate the genetic divergences for speciation to occur. The sampling locations, however, also contained the common central haplotypes. The existence of such divergent genes led Vogt &quot;et al&quot;. to recommended splitting up the taxon into three evolutionary significant units, corresponding to the Sarstun, Salinas, and Papaloapan populations, and something called a &#x27;management unit&#x27; for the locations where all of the 238 turtles tested in 2011 had the more common central mitochondria, for conservation purposes. Although mtDNA can reveal deep genetic structure in populations, as it is only inherited via the mother, it does not show insofar different subpopulations are independently evolving units, because different populations may interbreed without this showing in the mtDNA of individuals. A subsequent 2013 study of eight loci of the nuclear DNA aimed to resolve this.

This 2013 study found no sign of a recent bottleneck in the fifteen locations sampled, indicating that harvesting going for the past half century had not yet had an effect on genomic diversity, possibly a long generation time and delayed sexual maturity of &quot;D. mawii&quot; buffering against loss of genetic diversity despite population size reduction. The Sarstún and Salinas populations in general were not strongly differentiated from the neighbouring populations, but the four individuals from Sarstún and Salinas with divergent mitochondria did have divergent microsatellite loci sequences in varying amounts according to the individual, with three rare alleles only found in this subpopulation of four. The samples from Papaloapan locations were highly differentiated compared to almost all other populations, and also were rich in unique alleles. However, individuals carrying Papaloapan-type mtDNA haplotypes did not appear differentiated from the central type individuals, and these individuals occurred at relatively low frequencies amongst the central type haplotypes shared with adjacent populations to the east of the isthmus, indicating significant gene flow of mitochondrial lineages westwards across the isthmus. At the same time nuclear microsatellites appear to show gene flow in the other direction. Such conflicting signals could be caused by different episodes, or be due to a sex bias in dispersal. Also the populations from Sibun River, Lake Salpetén and Laguna Sacnab, all near the eastern edge of the distribution, were relatively well-differentiated from the remaining populations. This was thought to be due to losses of genetic variability from recent genetic drift and/or demographic isolation. All the other populations had high levels of gene flow, even between areas separated by geographic distances of more than 300 km. The study found that this suggests likely thousands of years of human-mediated trade, but that it might also just mean that this species is capable of moving great distances during its life. Besides microsatellite regions another part of the nuclear DNA was looked at, a 779 bp fragment of first intron of the RNA protein R35, with four haplotypes found. This revealed no phylogeographic structure: the main haplotype was common across the distribution, and the four individuals from Sarstún and Salinas all had this haplotype.

The overall pattern is completely different in the alligator snapping turtle (&quot;Macrochelys temminckii&quot;), which is also often caught, but in which gene flow between populations is very low, but the mixed lineages are somewhat similar to the diamondback terrapin (&quot;Malaclemys terrapin&quot;), with translocations during the early twentieth century, or the radiated tortoise (&quot;Geochelone radiata&quot;) and gopher tortoises (&quot;Gopherus polyphemus&quot;), which show contemporary population structuring influenced by recent releases.

The 2013 study concluded that as there was evidence of substantial genetic mingling the species was best regarded as a single cohesive &#x27;management unit&#x27; for conservation purposes, as opposed to Vogt &quot;et al&quot;. in 2011. The sample size of the individuals with the 1D mitochondria was too small to calculate insofar they represent a taxonomically relevant cryptic species.

==Description==

&quot;D. mawii&quot; It is a relatively large-bodied species, with historical records of straight carapace length and weights of ; however, more recent records have found few individuals over in Mexico or in Guatemala. It has a low, flattened, smooth carapace with a median keel present in juveniles, it is usually a uniform brown, almost black, grey or olive in colour. The plastron is usually white to yellow, though may acquire substrate staining in some areas. In juveniles, a distinctive keel is found down the centre of the carapace, and the outer edges have serrations. These features are lost as the turtle ages. Its skin is predominantly the same colour as the shell, with reddish or peach-coloured markings around the neck and underside.

Adult males can often be differentiated from females by yellow (although sometimes cream or reddish-brown) markings on the top of their heads, as opposed to the uniformly dull-coloured heads of females, and longer, thicker tails.

==Distribution==
&quot;D. mawii&quot; lives in Atlantic-draining larger rivers and lakes in Central America, from southern Mexico through Belize to the Guatemalan-Honduran border. In Mexico it occurs in the states of Veracruz, Tabasco, Campeche, the north of Oaxaca, the north of Chiapas and the south of Quintana Roo, primarily in the hydrological basins of the Papaloapan, Coatzacoalcos and Grijalva-Usumacinta River systems.

In Guatemala the species occurs from southern and central Petén Department, south to Lago de Izabal and the rivers which drain into it. The presence and status in the Río Motagua bordering Honduras was unknown in 2011. It is reasonably common in the Pasión River and its tributaries as well as several lakes in Petén as of 1998. It was once common in Lake Petén Itzá, but by 1998 had become rarer there. It is well protected in Yaxhá Lake. In 2007 it was found to occur throughout northern Petén in the area corresponding to the Maya Biosphere Reserve, with the researchers reporting that it was quite common almost everywhere, and extending the known distribution somewhat with the Río Azul in Mirador-Río Azul National Park and Playa Grande, Quiche. Based on an extrapolation of the turtle densities obtained in this survey, 4,081 turtles are estimated to currently exist within this area. This number is clearly an extreme underestimate, as only the surface area of large water bodies and rivers was taken into account, and the lowest densities found in the area were used in the calculations in order to be conservative. Very high turtle densities were captured in Laguna Peru in 2007 and 2009.

==Ecology==
&quot;D. mawii&quot; is a nocturnal, completely aquatic turtle that does not bask or leave the water, except to lay eggs.

The most significant predator is the otter (&quot;Lontra longicaudis&quot;). Vogt &quot;et al&quot;. stated in 2011 that these otters are known to be able to keep turtle populations low in some cases by hindering recruitment, whereas Platt and Rainwater in 2011 claim that they are the first to register otter predation in this species, and note that because other otter species in Canada or Europe are not significant predators of other species of turtles and turtles are not believed to form a major part of the otter diets, they hypothesise that otter predation is not significant, and also state that while there was ample evidence for otter predation in one part of Belize, this was the only place they had seen it occur. Campbell in 1998 notes that the otter is itself not common enough for this to be an issue. Especially large juveniles and subadults are preyed upon by otters in Belize. Otter predation can be recognised by the manner by which they typically chew off the heads, tail and limbs, sometimes slurping out the entrails, but leave the shell intact.

The crocodiles &quot;Crocodylus moreletii&quot; and &quot;C. acutus&quot; usually feed on juveniles and hatchlings, or intermediate-sized turtles. Crocodiles crush the shell and swallow the turtle whole. The indigo snake &quot;Drymarchon melanurus&quot; preys on the eggs and hatchlings. According to one report raccoons (&quot;Procyon lotor&quot;) have a similar feeding strategy as otters, and typically target nesting females, other reports has them as predators of the eggs and hatchlings. Other predators of the eggs and hatchlings are coati (&quot;Nasua narica&quot;) and birds are also known to eat the eggs and hatchlings, namely the rails &quot;Aramides cajanea&quot; and &quot;Rallus longirostris&quot;, limpkins (&quot;Aramus guarauna&quot;) and the herons &quot;Butorides virescens&quot;, &quot;Nycticorax nycticorax&quot; and &quot;Nyctanassa violacea&quot;. A possible predator is the jaguar (&quot;Panthera onca&quot;), which feeds on turtles in general by cracking the shell open to scoop out the contents.

&quot;D. mawii&quot; hosts a number of specialised parasites. The fluke &quot;Caballerodiscus resupinatus&quot; is found in the intestine and &quot;C. tabascensis&quot; in the intestine and stomach, both have been found in Tabasco and Veracruz, &quot;Parachiorchis parviacetabulatus&quot; recorded from the intestine was only found once in Veracruz, &quot;Pseudocleptodiscus margaritae&quot; recorded from the intestine was only found twice in Tabasco, &quot;Dermatemytrema trifoliatum&quot; in the intestine and stomach from Oaxaca, Tabasco and Veracruz, &quot;Octangioides skrjabini&quot; was recorded from the intestine and only found once in Tabasco, whereas &quot;O. tlacotalpensis&quot; was recorded from the intestine and only found in two localities in Veracruz, and lastly &quot;Choanophorus rovirosai&quot; was recorded from the intestine in Tabasco and Veracruz. All of these eight fluke species are only known to be hosted by &quot;D. mawii&quot;. &quot;Serpinema trispinosum&quot; is a parasitic nematode (also see entry on diet below) which has been recovered from a wide variety of freshwater turtles in North and Central America. Species of &quot;Placobdella&quot;, a type of leech, have been Chiapas found to suck blood from the skin of these turtles, as well as a number of other &quot;Kinosternon&quot; mud turtles in other parts of southern Mexico. A study on the blood of turtles collected in the wild in Pantanos de Centla Biosphere Reserve and a turtle breeding farm, both located in Tabasco, found 100% of the wild turtles were infected with a species of &quot;Haemogregarina&quot;, a protozoan parasite inhabiting the red blood cells of turtles and spread by leeches. The protozoan was more prevalent during the rainy season. 27% of the wild turtles had leeches feeding off them, with no apparent detrimental effect on the hosts. The captive turtles were uninfected by both, but more unhealthy in other ways, wild turtles were better fed, bigger, and exhibited no real damage to the shell or major wounds.

On a turtle farm in Veracruz it was noticed that turtles kept out of water for any period were highly susceptible to a bacterial lung infection.

===Diet===
&quot;D. mawii&quot; is herbivorous; it is a generalist, feeding on aquatic plants, floating plants, shoreline emergents, bank vegetation and grasses depending on the habitat. Typically, these include Russell river grass (&quot;Paspalum paniculatum&quot;), among others. It will also eat fruit and flowers opportunistically. During the rainy season the waters rise a few metres, sometimes many, in some places this brings the leaves and branches of terrestrial trees within the jaws of this turtle and it will largely browse on this during this season, in other places the water floods pastures, and the turtle will primarily graze upon the submerged grass. The habitat appears to be the main factor impacting diet -in many rivers the water is too strong or the waters to muddy to sustain aquatic plant-life, and in these waters the turtles feed on plants growing on the banks. Where the banks are too steep for such plants, here the turtles feed on leaves of overhanging branches.

It feeds during the night, spending most of the day underwater, generally in the deepest parts, usually near or under large branches and likewise, and often half-buried in the mud.

Because leafy vegetables are low-energy foods requiring extensive digestion, and reptiles are cold-blooded, herbivorous reptiles usually try to speed things up by basking in the sun -water turtles plopping back into the water as one walks past a lake is a common experience in tropical and subtropical climates. This species does not bask, maintaining the same body temperature as the waters which surround it. Thus this means that it likely has a specialised gut flora to help it break down its food, but the particulars of this have not adequately been explored. One experiment found that symbiotic microorganisms must aid in digestion -when eggs from the same nest were incubated and separated into two groups, with the hatchlings in one group being fed adult faeces and other group lacking this food additive, found that the young which snacked on excrement grew much faster than their peers. In green iguanas the behaviour of young feeding on adult dung is known to be important, but it is unknown if this means that turtle hatchlings also exhibit this behaviour in the wild. The intestines of these turtles are commonly swarming with nematodes-again, in iguanas of the &quot;Cyclura&quot; genus similar worms appear to aid in digestion, but in this case it is unknown if they are parasites, commensals or symbionts.

Captured &quot;D. mawii&quot; will occasionally, however, eat fish. Juveniles in captivity tend to more readily accept animal matter as food which may show that young &quot;D. mawii&quot; are more apt to be carnivorous.

===Reproduction===
The exact reproductive season for this species, &quot;D. mawii&quot;, has been confused in the literature. However, it is possible that a combination of a diapause and variable local reproductive cues is responsible for this. There appears to be a primary breeding season timed with the later part of the rainy season (September to December) and a secondary one at the beginning of the dry season (January to February). The species can lay up to 4 clutches per year with an average of 2–20 eggs per clutch; clutch sizes over 15, however, were not common.

As this species often buries its eggs in more than one nests with a rather random spatial distribution within one to three metres along a constantly shifting shoreline, the nests are extremely difficult to locate for humans, and finding eggs is very uncommon. In 1989 and 1990, despite nightly searches by a team during two seasons, only two nests were located. Polisar was never able to witness nesting himself, but three accounts from local hunters had the animals nesting within 1.5 metres from the shoreline.

In 1996 Polisar published that it was quite possible that the turtles nest underwater like the Australian &quot;Chelodina rugosa&quot;, a claim repeated as a certainty in later works, but in 2011 Vogt &quot;et al&quot;. dismiss the claim as invented by &#x27;locals&#x27; confused by the constantly rising and falling waters of their homeland.

==Interaction with humans==
&quot;D. mawii&quot; has been hunted for food for millennia. Archaeologists have recovered the remains of what appear to be Ancient Mayan feasts, wherein large numbers of turtles were roasted. Such remains are also found in areas, such as the eastern and northern Yucatán, where the species is not believed to occur today. This could be due to import during Mayan times, or represent a distribution it is now extirpated from, or modern scientists simply have not looked properly here. A 2011 study of the mtDNA of extant populations throughout the range of this species indicated that the population was likely highly impacted during Mayan times, and may have even been extirpated from certain areas, only to be restocked from other waterways. The mitochondrial divergences likely represent hydrological reproductive barriers between populations that may have existed for up to three million years, but there is an absence of a clear phylogeographical pattern between the lineages and the collection localities, with different mitochondrial lineages interspersed amongst each other, which shows probable large-scale gene flow between populations. This can be explained by colonisation of the area by imported animals. Haplotype diversity was furthermore found to be quite low in some populations, which was explained as likely the result of bottlenecks resulting from over-harvesting during Mayan followed by population expansions. A later genetic study refined this story and largely supported it, but proposed alternate explanations. Bottlenecks were not found to be caused by &quot;recent&quot; hunting pressure in this study (see genetics section above). According to a study by Götz which looked at the contents of different kitchen middens in the Yucatán, it is clear that although all species of turtles were eaten, &quot;D. mawii&quot; was a luxury product of the elites. Some time later, in the mid-16th century, Spanish explorers of the Gulf Coast of Mexico relate that turtles were a common meal for them there.

The turtles were also used for warfare by the Mayans, the carapace being used as a shield by Mayan warriors.

Today the turtle remains much loved as a traditional feast food in the Tabasco community, where it is considered a mark of cultural identity. &quot;D. mawii&quot; is primarily prepared for the religious festivities of Lent and &quot;Semana Santa&quot;.

In Belize these turtles are a culturally important food and popularly served as a traditional dish especially around the festivities of Easter, Christmas and La Ruta Maya, which is a canoe race in March attended by many people. A recipe from the 1950s or 1960s advises pouring boiling water over the chopped pieces of hickatee to remove the thin skin, seasoning the meat with thyme, black pepper, onion, garlic and vinegar and letting it marinate overnight, cooking in hot oil, mixing with coconut cream and serving with rice.

In the Petén highlands of Guatemala it is the most esteemed turtle because of its delicious flesh.

==Conservation==
&quot;D. mawii&quot; is a heavily exploited turtle; it is primarily harvested for its meat, exploitation of nesting females and their eggs is inconsequential because the nests are extremely hard to find. The species has been overhunted because it is valued by local people as a food, thus the meat fetches good prices.

The turtle is now uncommon from much of its former range in southern Mexico. It was assessed by the IUCN as being a critically endangered species in 2006 and is listed as endangered under the US Endangered Species Act. It is listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meaning international trade is regulated by the CITES permit system, and local laws are in place to control hunting.

===Conservation efforts in Belize===
The non-governmental conservation organisation the Turtle Survival Alliance (TSA) has conducted at least two hickatee workshops in Belize in the early 2010s where attendees were taught net capture techniques, measuring captured turtles and recording the information on standard collection sheets.

A countrywide survey of the population in Belize in 1983 and 1984 found that the species was common and abundant in some areas, but declining in population in more human-populated areas. Research in north-central Belize from 1989 through 1991 determined that harvesting rates in human-populated areas were unsustainable. As such, in 1993 the government of Belize instituted a number of new laws meant to control hunting and forbid trade. Hunting was forbidden in a certain closed season, hunters were allowed to bag no more than three turtles, and females above a certain size have to be released. A series of protected zones were established in a number of the major waterways in northern Belize. A 1998 and 1999 survey in north-central Belize found that the species was still common in remote areas, but was also still declining in more populated areas. A 2010 countrywide survey indicated that the population was much the same as in the previous surveys, depressed in human-populated areas, but healthy populations continue to exist in more remote areas. Although there was not much difference between the situation of the population in 2010 compared to the 1980s, there was a general decrease in overall numbers and sighting localities. Interviews with locals indicate the 1993 laws are largely ineffective, hunting continues to be performed with in some areas with hundreds of turtles being caught in small parts of the Belize River, and the traditional Easter dish of the country continues to be served in rural restaurants.

=== Captive breeding ===
In 1997 Polisar claimed it was rarely found in captivity, and that breeding would probably be impractical because he thought the nesting behaviour was complicated in this species. He seems to be somewhat wrong in this. The first turtle farm in Mexico has been operating in Nacajuca, Tabasco, since the 1980s when it began as a rescue centre. It is the largest captive breeding facility for &quot;Dermatemys&quot; today, with a population of about 700 individuals in 2006, and 800 in 2011. The turtles were three times a week fed with commercial pellets for tilapia fish, &quot;Melampodium divaricatum&quot; and &quot;Eichhornia crassipes&quot;, sometimes with the odd vegetable. The reproductive adult females were injected with calcium supplements twice a year (March, after the end of the oviposition period, and June–July at the beginning of the courtship period). The Mexican government has stimulated the breeding of this species in captivity, and as of 2009 fourteen farms were officially registered with the Secretaría del Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales, holding a few dozen to a few hundred turtles each.

As a generalist herbivore fodder costs are low. However, growth rates are low. In 2011 some US scientists mused that commercial breeding might be cost effective using experimental aquatic polyculture systems with the turtles as a secondary income source, and shrimp as the main crop. The turtles could graze on weeds and grasses, and do not harm the shrimp. A three year pilot study was done in Veracruz, after the pond weeds were consumed the turtles were fed grass clippings, and the turtles reproduced each year.

A project conducted by TSA on Belize Foundation for Research and Environmental Education property began in early 2011 focused on generating food plants and exploring husbandry details, such as egg laying and incubation. Located in southern Belize along the Bladen River, the property is situated among four protected areas (Bladen Nature Reserve, Cockscomb Basin Jaguar Reserve, Deep River Forest Reserve and Maya Mountain Forest Reserve). The goal of the program was to generate hatchlings and release them for stocking purposes.

As of 2006 it was kept at the following zoos: Veracruz Aquarium, Chicago Zoo, Detroit Zoo, Philadelphia Zoo (with the most specimens), and the Guatemala City Zoo (with only one).

<text>Harry &quot;Sweets&quot; Edison (October 10, 1915 – July 27, 1999) was an American jazz trumpeter and a member of the Count Basie Orchestra. His most important contribution was as a Hollywood studio musician, whose muted trumpet can be heard backing singers, most notably Frank Sinatra.

==Biography==
Edison was born in Columbus, Ohio, United States. He spent his early childhood in Louisville, Kentucky, being introduced to music by an uncle. After moving back to Columbus at the age of twelve, the young Edison began playing the trumpet with local bands.

In 1933, he became a member of the Jeter-Pillars Orchestra in Cleveland. Afterwards, he played with the Mills Blue Rhythm Band and Lucky Millinder. In 1937, he moved to New York and joined the Count Basie Orchestra. His colleagues included Buck Clayton, Lester Young (who named him &quot;Sweets&quot;), Buddy Tate, Freddie Green, Jo Jones, and other original members of that famous band. Speaking in 1956 with &quot;Down Beat&#x27;s&quot; Don Freeman, Edison explained the origin of his nickname:
&quot;Well, this happened one day in March back in &#x27;37. All of us in the Basie band were sitting around the lobby of the Woodside Hotel in New York. It was snowing outside, and we were waiting for the bus to go on a tour of one-nighters. We were all like brothers in that band. I was kind of the baby of the band and took a lot of the ribbing. So this time Lester Young was joshing me about my &#x27;sweet&#x27; style and he said: &quot;We&#x27;re going to call you &#x27;Sweetie Pie.&#x27;&quot; They did, too, for a few months. Then they shortened it to &quot;Sweets.&quot; The nickname has kind of lasted a long time&quot;.

&quot;Sweets&quot; Edison came to prominence as a soloist with the Basie Band and as an occasional composer/arranger for the band. He also appeared in the 1944 film &quot;Jammin&#x27; the Blues&quot;.

Edison spent thirteen years with Basie until the band was temporarily disbanded in 1950. Edison thereafter pursued a varied career as leader of his own groups, traveling with Jazz at the Philharmonic and freelancing with other orchestras. In the early 1950s, he settled on the West Coast and became a highly sought-after studio musician, making important contributions to recordings by such artists as Billie Holiday, Frank Sinatra, Nat King Cole, Billy Daniels, Margaret Whiting, Bing Crosby and Ella Fitzgerald. He worked closely with the arranger Nelson Riddle, who gave Edison a microphone that was separate from the rest of the trumpet section. He made use of a Harmon mute to improvise his solos and obbligatos. In 1956, he recorded the first of three albums with Ben Webster.

According to the &quot;Encyclopedia of Jazz in the Seventies&quot;, Edison in the 1960s and 1970s continued to work in many orchestras on television shows, including &quot;Hollywood Palace&quot; and &quot;The Leslie Uggams Show&quot;, specials with Frank Sinatra; prominently featured on the sound track and in the sound track album of the film &quot;Lady Sings the Blues&quot;. From 1973, Edison acted as Musical Director for Redd Foxx on theatre dates, at concerts, and in Las Vegas. He appeared frequently in Europe and Japan until shortly before his death. He was the Los Angeles Jazz Society&#x27;s first Tribute Honoree.

Edison died of prostate cancer at his home in Columbus, Ohio at the age of 83.

<text>The Kinosternidae are a family of mostly small turtles that includes the mud turtles and musk turtles. The family contains 25 species within four genera, but taxonomic reclassification is an ongoing process, so many sources vary on the exact numbers of species and subspecies. They inhabit slow-moving bodies of water, often with soft, muddy bottoms and abundant vegetation.

== Description ==
Most kinosternids are small turtles, in carapace length. The highly domed carapace has a distinct keel down its center. The genus &quot;Staurotypus&quot; gets much larger, to . Females are generally larger than males, but males have much longer tails. Kinosternids can be black, brown, green, or yellowish in color. Most species do not have shell markings, but some species have radiating black markings on each carapace scute. Some species have distinctive yellow striping along the sides of the head and neck.

The musk turtles are so named because they are capable of releasing a foul-smelling musk from glands under the rear of their shells when disturbed. They are native to North America and South America.

== Diet ==
All members of the family are carnivorous, feeding on crustaceans, aquatic insects, mollusks, annelids, amphibians, small fish, and sometimes carrion. They also eat vegetation such as aquatic plants. In captivity they can eat red and green leaf lettuce.

== Reproduction ==
Kinosternids lay about four hard-shelled eggs during the late spring and early summer. After hatching, some species overwinter in a subterranean nest, emerging the following spring. Some adults also spend the winter on land, constructing a burrow with a small air hole used on warm days.

Kinosternids contain the only species of turtle known, or at least suspected, to exhibit parental care. Studies of the yellow mud turtle in Nebraska, United States, suggest females sometimes stay with the nest and may urinate on the eggs long after laying, to either keep them moist or to protect them from snake predation (by making them less palatable).

Some kinosternids, particularly those in the genera &quot;Claudius&quot; and &quot;Staurotypus&quot;, exhibit genetic sex determination; in &quot;Staurotypus&quot; this is XY sex determination, and the same is suspected to be true of &quot;Claudius&quot; as well. &quot;Kinosternon&quot; and &quot;Sternotherus&quot; have temperature-dependent sex determination as is typical of turtles.

<doc id="322569" wikidata="Q2266155" url="?curid=322569" title="Kim Beazley Sr.">
<text>Kim Edward Beazley (30 September 1917 – 12 October 2007) was an Australian politician who served as a member of the House of Representatives from 1945 to 1977, representing the Labor Party. He was Minister for Education in the Whitlam government from 1972 to 1975.

==Early life and education==
Beazley, the youngest of seven children, was born in Northam, Western Australia. He was the son of Alfred Beazley, a storeman and packer, and his wife Mary Wright.

Beazley grew up in Fremantle. He attended the academically selective Perth Modern School (1933–1935), where he topped the state in history and English. He went on to Claremont Teachers College, and first worked as a teacher at the Richmond State School East Fremantle, and then Arthur River, Midland Junction, and Claremont. Beazley later studied politics at the University of Western Australia (UWA), and tutored at Claremont Teachers College and at UWA. He was later to gain an MA from the Australian National University.

==Career==

Beazley was active in the Labor Party, and the elegance of his writings and the eloquence of his speeches marked him out as a rising star. He served as vice president of the State School Teachers&#x27; Union and as a member of the State Executive of the Party.

On the death in office of Prime Minister John Curtin in 1945, the 27-year-old Beazley was preselected for, and won, Curtin&#x27;s Federal Parliament seat of Fremantle. He was the youngest member of the federal parliament when elected, and was known as &quot;the student prince&quot;. He became the Father of the House in 1975, and held his seat until he retired in 1977.

A committed Christian (he was brought up and baptised in the Church of Christ), and member of Moral Rearmament, Beazley was prominent on the right-wing of the Labor Party during the ideological battles of the 1950s and 1960s. He claimed a central role in the events leading to the Labor Party&#x27;s fateful 1954 split and harboured lifelong regret that he failed to help avert the split when he felt it had been in his power to do so. During the leadership of Arthur Calwell (from 1960 to 1967) he was considered a possible future leader of the party, but his right-wing views, particularly his support for the U.S. Alliance, cost him support, and Gough Whitlam emerged as Calwell&#x27;s successor.

Beazley was the education minister in the Whitlam government from 1972 to 1975. Though afflicted with severe illness for part of his tenure, he carried out important reforms in the education field, such as abolishing university fees and introducing needs-based funding for all schools through the Schools Commission. According to an article by C. J. Coventry, Beazley had been an informer for the U.S..

===Later life and death===
After the defeat of the Whitlam government in 1975, Beazley was elected to the Labor front bench, but resigned when it was revealed that Gough Whitlam and Bill Hartley, with the ALP national secretary, David Combe, had been seeking money from the Iraqi Ba&#x27;ath Party to pay for the party&#x27;s election campaign. He retired from politics in 1977. At the time of his death he was the last parliamentary survivor of the Chifley government, as well as the earliest surviving member of the Commonwealth Parliament. He died in Perth on 12 October 2007, and was accorded a state funeral on 20 October.

His memoirs were published posthumously in February 2009 with a foreword by his son Kim Christian Beazley who himself had a distinguished career as a Labor politician and party leader. The Beazley Medal, annual awards to the top secondary students in WA, were named in his honour.

Kim Edward Beazley&#x27;s death came almost a year after the death of his other son, David.

==Personal life==
Beazley married Betty Judge, a fellow teacher, union official and an athlete (she was Australian women&#x27;s 880 yards champion), on 7 February 1948, at Claremont. They had two sons, including Rhodes Scholar, Deputy Prime Minister and Governor of Western Australia Kim Christian Beazley, and one daughter.

<text>HSBC Holdings plc (; initialism from its founding member [[The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation]]) is a British universal bank and financial services group headquartered in London, England, with historical and business links to East Asia and a multinational footprint. It is the largest Europe-based bank by total assets under management (AUM), ahead of BNP Paribas, with US$3.098 trillion as of September 2024. Also putting it as the 7th largest bank in the world by AUM behind Bank of America, and the 3rd largest non-state owned bank in the world. 

In 2021, HSBC had $10.8 trillion in assets under custody (AUC) and $4.9 trillion in assets under administration (AUA). 

HSBC traces its origin to a &quot;hong&quot; trading house in British Hong Kong. The bank was established in 1865 in Hong Kong and opened branches in Shanghai in the same year. It was first formally incorporated in 1866. In 1991, the present parent legal entity, HSBC Holdings plc, was established in London and the historic Hong Kong–based bank from whose initials the group took its name became that entity&#x27;s fully-owned subsidiary. The next year (1992), HSBC took over Midland Bank and thus became one of the largest domestic banks in the United Kingdom.

HSBC has offices, branches and subsidiaries in 62 countries and territories across Africa, Asia, Oceania, Europe, North America, and South America, serving around 39 million customers. As of 2023, it was ranked no. 20 in the world in the Forbes rankings of large companies ranked by sales, profits, assets, and market value. HSBC has a dual primary listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the Hang Seng Index and the FTSE 100 Index. It has secondary listings on the New York Stock Exchange, and the Bermuda Stock Exchange.

==History==

=== Foundation ===



After the British established Hong Kong as a crown colony in the aftermath of the First Opium War, merchants from other parts of the British Empire, now in Hong Kong, felt the need for a bank to finance the growing trade, through Hong Kong and sometimes also through Shanghai, between China and India, the rest of the British Empire and Europe, of goods, produces and merchandises of all kinds, but especially opium, cultivated in or transited (re-exported) through &quot;the Raj&quot;.

The founder, Thomas Sutherland of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, wanted a bank operating on &quot;sound Scottish banking principles&quot;. Still, the original location of the bank was considered crucial and the founders chose Wardley House in Hong Kong since the construction was based on some of the best feng shui in colonial Hong Kong.

After raising a capital stock of HK$5 million, the bank commenced operations on 3 March 1865. It opened a branch in Shanghai in April of that year and started issuing locally denominated banknotes in both the Crown Colony and Shanghai soon afterwards. The bank was incorporated in Hong Kong as The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation by &quot;the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank Ordinance&quot; (Numbers 2 and 5 of 1866), and a branch in Japan was also established in Yokohama in 1866. Shares of the bank were one of 13 securities initially traded on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, and were traded on that exchange until the Japanese closed the exchange in 1941.

===Business development===

Sir Thomas Jackson became chief manager in 1876. During his twenty-six-year tenure, the bank became a leader in Asia. A period of expansion followed, with new buildings constructed in Bangkok (1921), Manila (1922) and Shanghai (1923), and a new head office building in Hong Kong in 1935. Bank note issuance displaced other forms of the era and of the region, such as silver taels, due to political and economic instability. HSBC gained significant influence as a result.

===International expansion===

Michael Turner became chief manager in 1953 and set about diversifying the business. His tenure came to an end in 1962 having established The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation of California 1955 and having acquired The British Bank of the Middle East and the Mercantile Bank (based in India) in Aug 1959. Turner was succeeded in 1962 by Jake Saunders. In 1964 the Chief Managership was superseded as the top executive role in the bank by an Executive Chairmanship.

During the Konfrontasi period in the 1960s, a group of Indonesian forces bombed the MacDonald House building in Singapore (at the time used by HSBC) just a few months after Singapore was granted its independence from Malaysia. Three people were killed, 33 injured, and the two Indonesian military officers responsible for the bombing were tried and executed.

The present building in Hong Kong was designed by Sir Norman Foster and was held as one of the most expensive and technologically advanced buildings in the world in 1986, costing HK$5.3 billion.

===Creation of the HSBC Group===
On 6 October 1989, it was registered as a regulated bank with the Banking Commissioner of the Government of Hong Kong.

HSBC Holdings plc, originally incorporated in England and Wales, was a non-trading, dormant shelf company when it completed its transformation on 25 March 1991 into the parent holding company to the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited now as a subsidiary, in preparation for its purchase of the UK-based Midland Bank and the impending transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong to China. HSBC Holdings&#x27; acquisition of Midland Bank was completed in 1992 and gave HSBC a substantial market presence in the United Kingdom. As part of the takeover conditions for the acquisition of the bank thereof, HSBC Holdings plc was required to relocate its world headquarters from Hong Kong to London in 1993.

Major acquisitions in South America started with the purchase of the Banco Bamerindus of Brazil for $1 billion in March 1997 and the acquisition of Roberts SA de Inversiones of Argentina for $600 million in May 1997. In May 1999, HSBC expanded its presence in the United States with the purchase of Republic National Bank of New York for $10.3 billion.

===2000 to 2010===

Expansion into Continental Europe took place in April 2000 with the acquisition of Crédit Commercial de France, a large French bank, for £6.6 billion. In July 2001 HSBC bought Demirbank, an insolvent Turkish bank. In July 2002, Arthur Andersen announced that HSBC USA, Inc., through a new subsidiary, Wealth and Tax Advisory Services USA Inc. (WTAS), would purchase a portion of Andersen&#x27;s tax practice. The new HSBC Private Client Services Group would serve the wealth and tax advisory needs of high-net-worth individuals. Then in August 2002 HSBC acquired Grupo Financiero Bital, SA de CV, Mexico&#x27;s third largest retail bank for $1.1 billion.

In November 2002, HSBC expanded further in the United States. Under the chairmanship of John Bond, it spent £9 billion (US$15.5 billion) to acquire Household Finance Corporation (HFC), a US credit card issuer and subprime lender. In a 2003 cover story, &quot;The Banker&quot; noted &quot;when banking historians look back, they may conclude that [it] was the deal of the first decade of the 21st century&quot;. Under the new name of HSBC Finance, the division was the second largest subprime lender in the United States.

The new headquarters of HSBC Holdings at 8 Canada Square, London officially opened in April 2003.

In July 2003, HSBC announced that it had agreed to acquire 82.19% of the Korean fund administrator, Asset Management Technology (AM TeK), for $12.47 million in cash; it was the largest fund administrator in South Korea, with $24 billion of assets under administration. In September 2003 HSBC bought Polski Kredyt Bank SA of Poland for $7.8 million. In June 2004 HSBC expanded into China buying 19.9% of the Bank of Communications of Shanghai. In the United Kingdom HSBC acquired Marks &amp; Spencer Retail Financial Services Holdings Ltd for £763 million in December 2004. Acquisitions in 2005 included Metris Inc, a US credit card issuer for $1.6 billion in August and 70.1% of Dar es Salaam Investment Bank of Iraq in October. In April 2006, HSBC bought the 90 branches in Argentina of Banca Nazionale del Lavoro for $155 million. In December 2007 HSBC acquired the Chinese Bank in Taiwan. In May 2008, HSBC acquired IL&amp;FS Investment, an Indian retail broking firm. On August 3, 2008, HSBC began its banking operations in Algeria with the opening of a branch in Algiers.

In 2005, Bloomberg Markets magazine accused HSBC of money laundering for drug dealers and state sponsors of terrorism. Then-CEO Stephen Green said that &quot;This was a singular and wholly irresponsible attack on the bank&#x27;s international compliance procedures&quot;, but subsequent investigation indicated that it was accurate and proved that the bank was involved in money laundering for the Sinaloa Cartel and throughout Mexico.

In July 2006, HSBC announced that it would acquire Westpac&#x27;s sub-custody operations in Australia and New Zealand for $112.5 million, making HSBC the leading sub-custody and clearing player in Australia and New Zealand.

In 2007, HSBC wrote down its holdings of subprime-related mortgage securities by $10.5 billion, becoming the first major bank to report its losses due to the unfolding subprime mortgage crisis.

According to Bloomberg, &quot;HSBC is one of world&#x27;s strongest banks by some measures&quot;. When HM Treasury required all UK banks to increase their capital in October 2007, the group transferred £750 million to London within hours, and announced that it had just lent £4 billion to other UK banks.

In March 2009, HSBC announced that it would shut down the branch network of its HSBC Finance arm in the United States, leading to nearly 6,000 job losses and leaving only the credit card business to continue operating. Chairman Stephen Green stated, &quot;HSBC has a reputation for telling it as it is. With the benefit of hindsight, this is an acquisition we wish we had not undertaken.&quot; According to analyst Colin Morton, &quot;the takeover was an absolute disaster&quot;.

In March 2009, it announced that it had made US$9.3 billion of profit in 2008 and announced a £12.5 billion (US$17.7 billion; HK$138 billion) rights issue to enable it to buy other banks that were struggling to survive. However, uncertainty over the rights issue&#x27;s implications for institutional investors caused volatility in the Hong Kong stock market: on 9 March 2009 HSBC&#x27;s share price fell 24.14%, with 12 million shares sold in the last few seconds of trading.

===2010 to 2013===

On 25 April 2011, HSBC decided to shut down its retail banking business in Russia and reduce its private banking presence to a representative office.

HSBC announced renaming of its Personal Financial Services (PFS) business group to Retail Banking and Wealth Management (also known as RBWM) on HSBC&#x27;s 2011 Investor Day. 

On 11 May 2013, the new chief executive Stuart Gulliver announced that HSBC would refocus its business strategy and that a large-scale retrenchment of operations, particularly in respect of the retail sector, was planned. HSBC would no longer seek to be &#x27;the world&#x27;s local bank&#x27;, as costs associated with this were spiraling and US$3.5 billion needed to be saved by 2013, with the aim of bringing overheads down from 55% of revenues to 48%. In 2010, then-chairman Stephen Green planned to depart HSBC to accept a government appointment in the Trade Ministry. Group Chief Executive Michael Geoghegan was expected to become the next chairman. However, while many current and former senior employees supported the tradition of promoting the chief executive to chairman, many shareholders instead pushed for an external candidate. HSBC&#x27;s board of directors had reportedly been split over the succession planning and investors were alarmed that the row would damage the company.

On 23 September 2010, Geoghegan announced he would step down as chief executive of HSBC. He was succeeded as chief executive by Stuart Gulliver, while Green was succeeded as chairman by Douglas Flint; Flint was serving as HSBC&#x27;s finance director (chief financial officer). August 2011: Further to CEO Stuart Gulliver&#x27;s plan to cut $3.5 billion in costs over the next two years, HSBC announced that it will cut 25,000 jobs and exit from 20 countries by 2013 in addition to 5,000 job cuts announced earlier in the year. The consumer banking division of HSBC will focus on the UK, Hong Kong, high-growth markets such as Mexico, Singapore, Turkey, and Brazil, and smaller countries where it has a leading market share. According to Reuters, Chief Executive Stuart Gulliver told the media, &quot;There will be further job cuts. There will be something like 25,000 roles eliminated between now and the end of 2013.&quot;

In August 2011 &quot;to align our U.S. business with our global network and meet the local and international needs of domestic and overseas clients&quot;, HSBC agreed to sell 195 branches in New York and Connecticut to First Niagara Financial Group Inc, and divestitures to KeyCorp, Community Bank, N.A. and Five Star Bank for around $1 billion, and announced the closure of 13 branches in Connecticut and New Jersey. The rest of HSBC&#x27;s U.S. network will only be about half from a total 470 branches before divestments. On 9 August 2011, Capital One Financial Corp. agreed to acquire HSBC&#x27;s U.S. credit card business for $2.6 billion, netting HSBC Holdings an estimated after-tax profit of $2.4 billion. In September it was announced that HSBC sought to sell its general insurance business for around $1 billion.

In 2012, HSBC was the subject of hearings of the U.S. Senate permanent subcommittee for investigations for severe deficiencies in its anti-money laundering practices (see Controversies). On 16 July the committee presented its findings. Among other things, it concluded that HSBC had been transferring $7 billion in banknotes from its Mexican to its US subsidiary (much of it related to drug dealing), was disregarding terrorist financing links and was actively circumventing US safeguards designed to prevent transactions involving terrorists, drug lords and rogue regimes, including hiding $19.4 billion in transactions with Iran. This investigation followed on from a probe by the US Federal Reserve and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency found that there was &quot;significant potential for unreported money laundering or terrorist financing&quot;.

On 11 December 2012, HSBC agreed to pay a record $1.92 billion fine in this money laundering case. It was reported that bank officials consistently overlooked internal warnings about the inadequacy of HSBC&#x27;s monitoring systems, according to the Justice Department. For example, in 2008, the CEO of HSBC Mexico was reportedly informed by Mexican law enforcement about a recording of a Mexican drug lord, who indicated that HSBC Mexico was a preferred location for money laundering. The United States Department of Justice, however, decided not to pursue criminal penalties, a decision which the &quot;New York Times&quot; labelled a &quot;dark day for the rule of law.&quot; HSBC chief executive Stuart Gulliver said: &quot;We accept responsibility for our past mistakes. We have said we are profoundly sorry for them, and we do so again.&quot;

===Since 2013===

In July 2013, Alan Keir was appointed chief executive of HSBC Bank plc after Brian Robertson&#x27;s resignation. Keir&#x27;s duties include overseeing the firm&#x27;s UK, European, Middle Eastern, and African divisions.

In June 2014, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary HSBC Life (UK) Limited agreed to sell its £4.2 billion UK pensions business to Swiss Re. In February 2015 the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists released information about the business conduct of HSBC under the title &quot;Swiss Leaks&quot; based on the 2007 hacked HSBC account records from whistle-blower Hervé Falciani. The ICIJ alleges that the bank profited from doing business with corrupt politicians, dictators, tax evaders, dealers of blood diamonds, arms dealers and other clients. US Senate investigators in 2012 had sought the hacked HSBC account records from Falciani and French authorities, but never received the data.

HSBC announced in August 2015 that it would be selling its Brazilian unit to Banco Bradesco for $5.2 billion following years of disappointing performance. In 2015, HSBC was recognised as the most trusted foreign bank in India by The Brand Trust Report 2015.

In 2016, the bank was mentioned numerous times in connection with the Panama Papers investigation. Many Syrians were angered when their accounts were judged high-risk and closed, despite the bank reportedly telling Mossack Fonseca it was &quot;comfortable&quot; with Rami Makhlouf as a customer, even though US Treasury sanctions against him were in effect at the time.

On 20 March 2017, the British newspaper &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that hundreds of banks had helped launder KGB-related funds out of Russia, as uncovered by an investigation named Global Laundromat. HSBC was listed among the 17 banks in the UK that were &quot;facing questions over what they knew about the international scheme and why they did not turn away suspicious money transfers,&quot; as HSBC &quot;processed $545.3m in Laundromat cash, mostly routed through its Hong Kong branch.&quot; Other banks facing scrutiny under the investigation included the Royal Bank of Scotland, NatWest, Lloyds, Barclays and Coutts. In response, HSBC stated that it was against financial crime, and that the case &quot;highlights the need for greater information sharing between the public and private sectors.&quot;

On 1 October 2017, Mark Tucker succeeded Douglas Flint as group chairman of HSBC, the first non-executive and outside chairman appointed by the group. Also in October 2017, HSBC announced that John Flint, chief executive of Retail Banking and Wealth Management, would succeed Stuart Gulliver as Group Chief Executive on 21 February 2018. It was further announced on 5 August 2019 that Flint was leaving and his role would be filled on a temporary basis by Noel Quinn, head of HSBC&#x27;s global commercial bank. Noel Quinn was subsequently appointed to the role on a permanent basis in March 2020.

In February 2020, HSBC announced it would cut 35,000 jobs worldwide after it was announced corporate profits decreased by 33% in 2019.

In 2020, HSBC announced merging two of its business lines: Retail Banking and Wealth Management &amp; Global Private Banking to form a new business unit as Wealth and Personal Banking.

In October 2020, HSBC committed to achieve zero-emission by 2050, e.g., by this year it would not only become carbon neutral by itself but also will work only with carbon-neutral clients. It also committed to providing 750–1,000 billion dollars to help clients make the transition. It also pledged to achieve carbon neutrality in his own operations by 2030.

In January 2021, HSBC announced that it would be closing 82 branches in Britain. In May 2021, HSBC announced the exit of US retail banking business by selling 10 California branches to Cathay Bank and 80 branches to Citizens Financial Group and closing the remaining branches. The bank said it intends to focus on the banking and wealth management needs of globally connected affluent and high net worth clients.

In May 2021, HSBC committed to end the financing of the coal industry, with a commitment to publish a new coal policy and provide further detail on its climate strategy by the end of 2021. The organisation&#x27;s &quot;Thermal Coal Phase-Out Policy&quot; was published in December 2021.

In August 2021, HSBC announced the acquisition of AXA Singapore. HSBC Insurance (Asia-Pacific) Holdings Ltd, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of HSBC would acquire 100% of the issued share capital of AXA Singapore for $575m. In December 2021, HSBC Asset Management (India) Private Ltd, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of HSBC announced it would acquire L&amp;T Investment Management for $425 million from L&amp;T Finance Holdings.

In June 2022, HSBC announced its intention to sell its business in Russia. This requires approval from the Russian government, and the deal is expected to close in the first half of 2024. The projected loss is $300 million. A possible buyer is the Russian Expobank. In February 2024, the President of Russia allowed HSBC and Expobank to carry out this transaction.

In July 2022, HSBC became the first foreign lender to open a Chinese Communist Party (CCP) committee in its Chinese investment banking subsidiary. The subsidiary, HSBC Qianhai Securities, is a 90% HSBC-owned joint venture.

In November 2022, HSBC announced its intention to exit the Canadian market. Royal Bank of Canada would acquire 100% of the common shares of HSBC Canada for an all-cash purchase price of $13.5 billion, 9.4 times HSBC Canada&#x27;s estimated 2024 earnings. Completion of the transaction is expected by late 2023, subject to regulatory approvals. HSBC has been under pressure to cut costs and divest non-Asian businesses.

In February 2023, HSBC announced that its profits for the last quarter of 2022 had almost doubled compared to those at the same time the previous year. However, its pre-tax profit actually fell because it absorbed the cost of selling its French retail banking operations. The bank also announced that they were closing 114 branches in the United Kingdom. The move came as more people were using online banking since the pandemic, reducing the need for physical branches. The move has been criticized by Unite.

As interest rates increased globally in May 2023, HSBC Holdings reported a 212% increase in quarterly profit.

In May 2023, HSBC defeated a proposal, backed by its largest stakeholder Chinese insurer Ping An, to consider spinning off its Asia business into a Hong Kong-listed entity.

In December 2023, HSBC Asset Management announced they would be acquiring the Singapore Based Investment manager, Silkroad Property Partners. The proposed acquisition includes Singapore-based SilkRoad Property Partners Pte Ltd, along with its subsidiaries in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Tokyo, and the five general partner entities associated with its active funds. Terms of the agreement were not disclosed. The deal would expand HSBC&#x27;s real estate fund management capabilities in the region by bringing on board a business with an estimated $2 billion in assets under management, primarily in value-add strategies, as well as a senior team with experience executing deals in the region&#x27;s major cities.

HSBC announced, in December 2023, that it intended to move its head office from 8 Canada Square to 81 Newgate Street when the lease on the former building expires in 2027.

In 2024, HSBC, as part of the Hong Kong Association of Banks, began developing a roadmap to phase out cheques in the city and switch to electronic payments. 
According to Hong Kong Interbank Clearing Limited, cheque transactions in Hong Kong fell to HK$488.6 billion (US$62.5 billion) in December, down 13 percent year-on-year.

In 2024, HSBC announced an international payments app, Zing, a competitor to Revolut and Wise apps. It will also focus on retail customers and low-cost currency exchange. In January 2025, HSBC decided to shut down the app only one year after its launch, as part of a cost-cutting drive.

In 2024, HSBC Philippines launched &quot;Omni Collect&quot; to allow companies to connect to HSBC&#x27;s single API to offer and manage payments across multiple channels. &quot;It supports multiple online and offline payment options for customers and delivers transaction data through HSBC’s global digital platform, HSBCnet,&quot; the bank Head Art Tanseco said.

On 9 April 2024, HSBC announced the sale of its Argentina business to Galicia for $550 million. HSBC said that the deal awaited government approval but was expected to be finalized by the year-end. HSBC was also approved to exit its Armenia holdings by the central bank in a sale to Ardshinbank on 27 August.

In January 2025, HSBC announced the closure of some of its investment banking units in Europe, UK and US as part of the ongoing restructuring effort by its CEO Georges Elhedery, followed by a new round of investment bank job cuts. These significant revamps were expected to bring $1.8 billion cost savings by the end of 2026.

==Operations==



HSBC has its world headquarters at 8 Canada Square in Canary Wharf, London. In June 2023, the bank announced its intentions to exit this building when its lease expires in 2027, stating their intention to move to a building in the City of London near St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.

===Size, profit and auditors===

* As of 2014, according to Relsbank, HSBC was the fourth-largest bank in the world by assets (with $2,670.00  billion), the second largest in terms of revenues (with $146.50 billion) and the largest in terms of market value (with $180.81 billion).
* It was also the most profitable bank in the world with $19.13 billion in net income in 2007 (compared to Citigroup&#x27;s $3.62 billion and Bank of America&#x27;s $14.98 billion in the same period). 
* In June 2006, The Economist stated that since the end of 2005 HSBC has been rated the largest banking group in the world by Tier 1 capital. In June 2014 The Banker ranked HSBC first in Western Europe and 5th in the world for Tier 1 capital. 
* In February 2008, HSBC was named the world&#x27;s most valuable banking brand by &quot;The Banker&quot; magazine.
* HSBC has been audited by PwC, one of the Big Four auditors since 2015.
* Despite being domiciled in the UK, HSBC generates around two-thirds of its profits in Asia, with China contributing 44% of the bank&#x27;s profit in 2022.
===Principal business groups and divisions===
HSBC organises its customer-facing activities within three business groups: Commercial Banking (CMB); Global Banking and Markets (GBM); Wealth and Personal Banking (WPB).

====Commercial Banking====
Commercial Banking group has more than 2 million commercial banking customers, including sole proprietors, partnerships, clubs and associations, incorporated businesses and publicly quoted companies.

====Wealth and Personal Banking====
Wealth and Personal Banking group helps customers to take care of their day-to-day finances and to manage, protect and grow their wealth. HSBC provides more than 54 million such customers. It is focused on three operational divisions: Wealth Management, Global Asset Management, and Global Private Banking.

Retail Banking and Wealth Management (also known as RBWM) was previously referred to as Personal Financial Services (PFS). This rename was announced during HSBC&#x27;s 2011 Investor Day. In 2020, HSBC announced merging two of its business lines: Retail Banking and Wealth Management &amp; Global Private Banking to form a new business unit as Wealth and Personal Banking.

====Group service centers====
COO Alan Jebson said in March 2005 that he would be very surprised if fewer than 25,000 people were working in the centers over the next three years: &quot;I don&#x27;t have a precise target but I would be surprised if we had less than 15 (global service centers) in three years&#x27; time.&quot; He went on to say that each centre cost the bank from $20m to $30m to set up, but that for every job moved the bank saves about $20,000 (£10,400). Trades unions, particularly in the UK and US, blame these centers for job losses and also for the effective imposition of wage caps on their members.

==Controversies==
HSBC has been implicated in a number of controversies and the bank has been repeatedly fined for money laundering (sometimes in relation to major criminal organizations such as the Sinaloa cartel) or setting up large scale tax avoidance schemes.

===Money laundering===
In both 2003 and 2010, U.S. regulators ordered HSBC to strengthen its anti-money laundering practices. In October 2010, the United States OCC issued a Cease and Desist Order requiring HSBC to strengthen multiple aspects of its Anti-Money Laundering (AML) program. The identified problems included a once massive backlog of over 17,000 alerts identifying suspicious activity, failure to file timely suspicious activity reports with U.S. law enforcement, failure to conduct any due diligence to assess risks to HSBC affiliates before opening correspondent accounts for them, a three-year failure by HBUS from mid-2006 to mid-2009 to conduct any AML of $15 billion in bulk cash transactions from those same HSBC affiliates, failure to monitor $60 trillion in annual wire transfers by customers in countries rated lower risk by HBUS, and inadequate and unqualified AML staffing, resources, and leadership. It was noted that HSBC fully cooperated with the Senate investigation.

In 2012, HSBC was fined by $14 million by Argentina for failure to report suspicious transactions in the country in 2008.

On 19 July 2012, India investigated alleged violation of safety compliance, in which Indian employees were believed to be involved. On 9 November 2012, Indian activist and politician Arvind Kejriwal said he had details of 700 Indian bank accounts hiding black money with a total value of with HSBC in Geneva. In June 2013, a media outlet in India did an undercover expose where HSBC officers were caught on camera agreeing to launder &quot;black money.&quot; HSBC placed these employees on leave pending their own internal investigation.

In November 2012, it was reported that HSBC had set up offshore accounts in Jersey for suspected drug-dealers and other criminals, and that HM Revenue and Customs had launched an investigation following a whistle blower leaking details of £700 million allegedly held in HSBC accounts in the Crown dependency.

Following search warrants and raids beginning in January 2013, in mid-March 2013 Argentina&#x27;s main taxing authority accused HSBC of using fake receipts and dummy accounts to facilitate money laundering and tax evasion.

In early February 2013, appearing before UK&#x27;s Parliamentary Banking Standards Commission, CEO Stuart Gulliver acknowledged that the structure of the bank had been &quot;not fit for purpose.&quot; He also stated, &quot;Matters that should have been shared and escalated were not shared and escalated.&quot; HSBC has also been accused of laundering money for terrorist groups.

In June 2015, HSBC was fined by the Geneva authorities after an investigation into money laundering within its Swiss subsidiary. The fine was 40 million Swiss Francs.

In 2018, HSBC was fined 15 million rand by South Africa&#x27;s central bank for weaknesses in its processes meant to detect money laundering and terrorism financing, though it also added that HSBC was not found to have facilitated any transactions involving money laundering or the financing of terrorism in South Africa.

In 2020, HSBC told AUSTRAC that it may have broken Australia&#x27;s anti money laundering and counter-terrorism laws after allegedly failing to report thousands of transactions to AUSTRAC.

In July 2021, HSBC disclosed that in 2016 it discovered a suspected money laundering network that received $4.2 billion worth of payments which has raised questions over whether it disclosed this appropriately to US monitors as the bank was still under probation by U.S. authorities over anti-money laundering concerns.

In December 2021, HSBC was fined 64 million pounds ($85 million) by British regulators for failings in its anti-money laundering processes spanning eight years.

====US Senate investigation (2012)====
In July 2012, a US Senate committee issued a report which stated that HSBC had been in breach of money-laundering rules, and had assisted Iran and North Korea to circumvent US nuclear-weapons sanctions.

In December 2012, Assistant U.S. Attorney General Lanny Breuer suggested that the U.S. government might resist criminal prosecution of HSBC which could lead to the loss of the bank&#x27;s U.S. charter. He stated, &quot;Our goal here is not to bring HSBC down, it&#x27;s not to cause a systemic effect on the economy, it&#x27;s not for people to lose thousands of jobs.&quot;

In December 2012, HSBC was penalised $1.9 billion (US), the largest fine under the Bank Secrecy Act, for violating four U.S. laws designed to protect the U.S. financial system. HSBC had allegedly laundered at least $881 million in drugs proceeds through the U.S. financial system for international cartels, as well as processing an additional $660 million for banks in US sanctioned countries. According to the report, &quot;The U.S. bank subsidiary [also] failed to monitor more than $670 billion in wire transfers and more than $9.4 billion in purchases of physical dollars from its Mexico unit.&quot; As part of the agreement deferring its prosecution, HSBC acknowledged that for years it had ignored warning signs that drug cartels in Mexico were using its branches to launder millions of dollars, and also acknowledged that HSBC&#x27;s international staff had stripped identifying information on transactions made through the United States from countries facing economic sanctions such as Iran and Sudan.

A December 2012 &quot;CNNMoney&quot; article compared the 1.9 billion dollar fine to HSBC&#x27;s profit &quot;last year&quot; (2011) of 16.8 billion.

In 2016, HSBC was sued by American families involved in deaths by organized-crime gangs for processing funds (&quot;money laundering&quot;) for the Sinaloa cartel.

==== FinCEN Files (2020) ====
The FinCEN Files showed that HSBC continued to serve alleged criminals and corporations involved in government corruption, including $292 million for the Waked Family company Viva Panama between 2010 and 2016 before the United States Department of the Treasury declared it a drug money-laundering organization. HSBC&#x27;s activities took place while the bank was under probation from the U.S. government; six former HSBC employees reported to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists that the deferred prosecution agreement for HSBC marked a &quot;cultural shift&quot; in the organization toward profit-making motives. Employees working in compliance at HSBC also expressed concern to Buzzfeed about what they felt were inadequate efforts to combat money laundering, including hasty investigations and unachievable internal investigation quotas. In response to the report HSBC said it is &quot;continually seeking ways to improve&quot; its financial crime compliance regime.

===Forex, Libor and Euribor scandals (2014)===
The bank was fined US$275m by the US CFTC in 2014 for taking part in the Forex scandal. The bank also settled for US$18m in the related Libor scandal and EUR 33m for the Euribor rate scandal (relative to other banks a small amount). In October 2020 HSBC was fined about $2.2 million over the Euribor rate scandal in Switzerland.

=== Belgian tax fraud, money laundering charges (2014) ===
In November 2014, HSBC was accused of tax fraud and money laundering by Belgian Prosecutors for helping hundreds of clients move money into offshore tax havens.

In August 2019, HSBC agreed to pay $336 million to settle the case.

===Tax avoidance schemes (2015)===
In February 2015, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists released information about the bank&#x27;s business conduct under the title &quot;Swiss Leaks&quot;. The ICIJ alleges that the bank profited from doing business with tax evaders and other clients. The BBC reported that the bank had put pressure on media not to report about the controversy, with British newspaper &quot;The Guardian&quot; claiming bank advertising had been put &quot;on pause&quot; after &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s coverage of the matter. Peter Oborne, chief political commentator at &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, resigned from the paper and in an open letter claimed the newspaper suppressed negative stories and dropped investigations into HSBC because of the bank&#x27;s advertising.

In November 2017, HSBC agreed to pay $352 million to settle a French investigation into the case.

In August 2019, the former head of HSBC Swiss from 2000 to 2008, Peter Braunwalder pleaded guilty in a French court for helping wealthy clients hide $1.8 billion. He was fined $560,000 and received a one-year suspended jail sentence.

In December 2019, HSBC Swiss agreed to pay a $192 million United States fine for the case.

===$3.5 billion currency scheme (2016)===
In July 2016, the United States Department of Justice charged two executives from HSBC Bank over an alleged $3.5 billion currency scheme which defrauded HSBC clients and &quot;manipulated the foreign exchange market to benefit themselves and their bank&quot;. &quot;Mark Johnson and Stuart Scott, both British citizens, are being accused.&quot; &quot;Johnson was arrested late Tuesday [19 July 2016] at JFK International Airport in New York City.&quot; &quot;Stuart Scott, who was HSBC&#x27;s European head of foreign exchange trading in London until December 2014, is accused of the same crimes.&quot; A warrant was issued for Scott&#x27;s arrest, but he fled to Britain. In July 2018 the High Court of Justice ruled against extraditing him to the United States since most of the alleged crimes took place in Britain and because Scott has no significant connection to the United States.

Mark Johnson was later convicted of nine counts of wire fraud and conspiracy to defraud related to front running the currency trades of HSBC clients and sentenced to two years in federal prison. He was released after serving three months in prison and was allowed to return home to the U.K. while he pursued an appeal. November 2020 the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal of his 2017 conviction, which was previously upheld by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. It meant he would have to return to the U.S. to serve his sentence. In February 2021 a judge ruled that Johnson would not need to report to prison until he is vaccinated against COVID-19. In January 2018 HSBC agreed to pay a $101.5 million fine over the case.

===Defense industry (2018)===
In December 2018, &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot; reported that HSBC confirmed that the bank would divest from Elbit Systems Ltd., Israel&#x27;s largest non-government-owned military contractor, active in numerous defence-related industries. HSBC justified its decision by claiming it &quot;strongly supports observance of international human rights principles as they apply to business.&quot; In response, the group Palestine Solidarity Campaign (PSC) released a press release in which it &quot;declared a victory&quot; and quoted PSC director Ben Jamal saying the decision demonstrates &quot;the effectiveness of Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions as a tactic.&quot; JewishPress.com reported that multiple sources claimed HSBC&#x27;s decision was not influenced by the BDS movement but was an &quot;investment decision.&quot;

In an editorial titled &quot;Bad Banking&quot;, &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot; wrote, &quot;HSBC, if this is your final decision, you will go down on the wrong side of history. Do you understand that Israel is using Elbit technology to protect itself against Palestinian terror, and not to undermine the rights of the Palestinian people? If you are really concerned about human rights, perhaps you might consider using some of your own income to invest in the Palestinian economy, and boost cooperation between Israeli and Palestinian institutions.&quot;

=== Housing crisis fine (2018) ===
In 2018, HSBC agreed to pay a $765 million fine to settle claims it mis-sold Residential mortgage-backed securities between 2005 and 2007. Forbes noted the settlement was the lowest of 11 banks that settled with the Department of Justice. HSBC has said in statement that it has been improving relevant control mechanisms since the financial crisis.

===Support for China&#x27;s Security Law for Hong Kong (2020)===
In June 2020, on the eve of the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square protests, HSBC took the rare step of wading into political issues by publicly backing Beijing&#x27;s controversial new national security law for Hong Kong. The chief executive for HSBC&#x27;s Asia-Pacific division, Peter Wong, signed a petition supporting the law and stated in a post on Chinese social media that HSBC &quot;respects and supports all laws that stabilise Hong Kong&#x27;s social order.&quot;

Though HSBC moved its headquarters to London in 1993, Hong Kong remains its largest market accounting for 54% of its profit, a third of its global revenue, and 50,000 local staff. In response, Joshua Wong, a top Hong Kong pro-democracy activist decried the bank&#x27;s position stating that HSBC&#x27;s stance demonstrates &quot;how China will use the national security law as new leverage for more political influence over foreign business community in this global city.&quot; Alistair Carmichael, the U.K. chairman of the All Parliamentary Group on Hong Kong, said HSBC made a serious error by bending to China&#x27;s will regarding the security law, calling it &quot;a colossal misjudgment&quot; since it would be seen as a large British corporation advocating for &quot;a fairly flagrant breach of international law&quot; when banks rely on a rules-based system. Human Rights Watch alleged that &quot;the new national security law will deal the most severe blow to the rights of people in Hong Kong since the territory&#x27;s transfer to China in 1997.&quot;

British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab also commented on HSBC&#x27;s stance, saying &quot;Businesses will make their own judgment calls, but let me just put it this way – we will not sacrifice the people of Hong Kong over the altar of banker bonuses&quot;.

Since August 2020, HSBC has frozen the accounts of numerous pro-democratic organizations and activists, and their families, including Jimmy Lai, Ted Hui and the Good Neighbour North District Church.

In January 2021, the CEO of HSBC defended its relationship with Chinese authorities in Hong Kong and freezing of Ted Hui&#x27;s account to the United Kingdom&#x27;s parliamentary foreign affairs committee.

In February 2021, more than 50 members of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China called for the immediate unfreezing of funds belonging to Ted Hui and his family,

In 2023 an All-party parliamentary group released a report regarding the actions of the bank&#x27;s operations in Hong Kong. The report found that HSBC was complicit in human rights abuses by bank&#x27;s cutting off the pension plan after the Hong Kong authority cut off pension funding for those that fled the anti-democratic crackdown on the region. The group was chaired by Alistair Carmichael who stated that the bank has been &quot;complicit in the repression of the human rights of innocent Hong Kongers&quot;.

===Sterling Lads (2021)===

EU antitrust regulators fined HSBC 174.3 million euros for foreign exchange market rigging by exchanging sensitive information and trading plans through an online chat room dubbed &quot;Sterling Lads&quot;.

===Other===

====Data loss (2008)====
In 2008, HSBC issued a statement confirming it had lost a disc containing details of 370,000 customers of its life insurance business. HSBC said the disc had failed to arrive in the post between offices and it was not encrypted. The bank was later fined over £3 million by the Financial Services Authority for failing to exercise reasonable care with regards to data protection in connection with this and other lost customer information.

====Breaching Iran sanctions for Huawei (2009–2014)====
From 2009 to 2014, in breach of United States sanctions on Iran, the bank facilitated money transfers in Iran on behalf of the Chinese company Huawei.

====Gaddafi Libya claims (2011)====
According to Global Witness and cited by BBC, &quot;billions of dollars of assets&quot; were held by the bank for the Libyan Investment Authority, controlled by Colonel Muammar Gaddafi. Following Gaddafi&#x27;s overthrow the bank declined to reveal information about the funds citing customer confidentiality.

====Deforestation claims (2012, 2018)====
In the report titled &quot;In the Future There Will Be No Forests Left&quot; produced by Global Witness, the bank was accused of supporting the seven largest Malaysian timber conglomerates, which are responsible for deforestation in the Malaysian state of Sarawak. The bank declined to divulge its clients, citing client confidentiality, but maintains that the accusations are not accurate. The environmentalist group Greenpeace has also alleged that the bank is contributing to the deforestation in Indonesia and subsequent hazardous impacts in the region by providing funds to palm oil producers for new plantations. The bank has denied these claims, citing its sustainability policy that prohibits the bank from financing projects that &quot;damage high conservation value forest.&quot;

====Money-laundering policies (2014)====
The bank was reported to have refused large cash withdrawals for customers without a third-party letter confirming what the money would be used for. Douglas Carswell, the Conservative MP for Clacton, was alarmed by the policy: &quot;All these regulations which have been imposed on banks allow enormous interpretation. It basically infantilises the customer. In a sense, your money becomes pocket money and the bank becomes your parent.&quot;

====Payments-processing failures (2015)====
In August 2015, the bank failed to process BACS payments resulting in thousands of salaries not paid, house purchase and payment for essential home care failures.

==== Spam phone calls (2020) ====
In January 2020, HSBC agreed to pay a $2.4 million settlement for a lawsuit filed in 2015 by customers who stated they received spam phone calls from the company.

====Racism report (2021)====
HSBC banker Ian Clarke alleged a failure of HSBC to retain or promote black and other ethnic minority staff, a lack of such people in senior positions, and insufficient policies to address these problems. HSBC did not address the specifics of Clarke&#x27;s assertions and he resigned shortly thereafter.

====Climate change (2022)====
Stuart Kirk, the bank&#x27;s global head of responsible investing, was suspended in May due to his speech in which he said &quot;There&#x27;s always some nut job telling me about the end of the world.&quot; He quit his position in July, criticising the &quot;cancel culture&quot; in his Linkedin post, and blaming it for his suspension and resignation. In October, the company had its two advertisements banned due to being misleading about the company&#x27;s activities for reducing the effects of climate change. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), who was behind the ban, stated that the posters omitted material information about how HSBC planned to tackle the climate change and reduce its impact.

==Logo==

The group announced in November 1998 that the HSBC brand and the hexagon symbol would be adopted as the unified brand in all the markets where HSBC operates, with the aim of enhancing recognition of the group and its values by customers, shareholders and staff throughout the world. The hexagon symbol was originally adopted by the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation as its logo in 1983. It was developed from the bank&#x27;s house flag, a white rectangle divided diagonally to produce a red hourglass shape. Like many other Hong Kong company flags that originated in the 19th century, and because of its founder&#x27;s nationality, the design was based on the cross of Saint Andrew. The logo was designed by Austrian graphic artist Henry Steiner.

In 2018, HSBC made minor changes to their logo. The wordmark was repositioned from left to the right, resized to be smaller, and was switched from Serif to a licensed custom font called Univers Next for HSBC. The logo red was made slightly darker red.

==Sponsorships==

Having sponsored the Jaguar Racing Formula One team since the days of Stewart Grand Prix, HSBC ended its relationship with motorsport after seven years when Red Bull purchased Jaguar Racing from Ford.

In the mid-2000s, HSBC switched its focus to golf, taking title sponsorship of several events such as the HSBC World Match Play Championship, HSBC Women&#x27;s World Match Play Championship (now defunct), WGC-HSBC Champions, Abu Dhabi HSBC Golf Championship, HSBC Women&#x27;s Champions, HSBC Golf Business Forum and HSBC Golf Roots (a youth development programme). HSBC was named the &#x27;Official Banking Partner&#x27; of the Open Championship, in a five-year deal announced in 2010.

In October 2010, the International Rugby Board announced that they had concluded a 5-year deal with HSBC which granted them status as the first-ever title sponsor of the World Sevens Series. Through the accord, HSBC is paying more than $100 million for the title naming rights to all the tournaments. HSBC opted to sub-license the naming rights to all but one of the individual tournaments while retaining its name sponsorship of the overall series and the Hong Kong Sevens. The company also sponsors the Hong Kong Rugby Union and the New South Wales Waratahs team in Super Rugby. It sponsored British &amp; Irish Lions during their 2009 tour to South Africa and 2013 tour to Australia.

HSBC is the official banking partner of the Wimbledon Championships tennis tournament, providing banking facilities on site and renaming the junior event as the HSBC Road to Wimbledon National 14 and Under Challenge.

HSBC&#x27;s other sponsorships are mainly in the area of education, health and the environment. In November 2006, HSBC announced a $5 million partnership with SOS Children as part of Future First.

In 2022, it was announced that Zhou Guanyu, the first Chinese F1 driver in history who made his debut a few months earlier, became an ambassador for the Chinese subsidiary of HSBC.

<text>Cheloniidae is a family of typically large marine turtles that are characterised by their common traits such as, having a flat streamlined wide and rounded shell and almost paddle-like flippers for their forelimbs. They are the only sea turtles to have stronger front limbs than back limbs. The six species that make up this family are: the green sea turtle, loggerhead sea turtle, olive ridley sea turtle, hawksbill sea turtle, flatback sea turtle and the Kemp&#x27;s ridley sea turtle.

==Morphology==
In contrast to their earth-bound relatives, tortoises, sea turtles do not have the ability to retract their heads into their shells. Their plastron, which is the bony plate making up the underside of a turtle or tortoise&#x27;s shell, is comparably more reduced from other turtle species and is connected to the top part of the shell by ligaments without a hinge separating the pectoral and abdominal plates of the plastron. Sizes among the seven species of sea turtles range from 71 to 213 cm; for example, the smallest turtle species in the family Cheloniidae, the Kemp&#x27;s Ridley, only has a shell size of about 75 cm and a weight of 50 kg. All species have a distinct hardened shell.

==Reproduction and life cycle==

Reproductive behaviors among the different species of sea turtles are similar, with slight differences in each of the species. The females come to shore and bury their clutch of eggs on beaches or sandy environments typically at night and well away from the high tide line of the shore. Most females nest only once every three to four years and most species have two to four egg laying time periods per nesting season, which is from spring to late fall. A common number of eggs laid in a nest is often about 100 eggs per clutch. The incubation period of some turtles can range anywhere from 50 to 60 days. The development of the eggs is dependent on the temperature of the environment that they were buried in, with warmer climates bringing about an earlier emergence by the hatchlings. The timing of sea turtle hatching tends to be almost synchronous among the whole clutch of eggs, with just about all the eggs in the nest hatching within the same time. This is thought to aid the process of the hatchlings unburying themselves from the sand and most often occurs at night time. Temperature has also been linked to the likeliness of hatching&#x27;s sex, warmer temperature more likely to produce females and colder temperatures more commonly producing males.

==Habitat and ecology==

The habitat range of sea turtles, in general, is known to be far reaching into warmer temperatures and the tropical and subtropical areas of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans and is even also found in warmer seas such as the Mediterranean Sea. Within these temperamental biomes, sea turtles frequent near by the coastlines when nesting, and spend most of their lives swimming out in waters over the continental shelf when feeding. Travelling throughout the oceans has been reported in olive ridley sea turtles but more often than not, they tend to frequent bays and estuaries. The diets of all the sea turtle species, except for the Green Sea Turtle, which is only herbivorous from hatchling to juvenile, are mostly carnivorous, with some herbivorous tendencies. Sea turtles feed mainly on sea sponges, jellyfish, mollusks and barnacles, sea urchins, and even fish. The green sea turtle, on the other hand, feeds primarily on many different types of sea grasses.

==Conservation status and significance to humans==

The conservation status of each of the seven turtle species are either endangered, threatened or data deficient (Flatback). The green and loggerhead sea turtles are categorized as endangered, olive ridley are classified as vulnerable, Kemp&#x27;s ridley, and hawksbill sea turtles are critically endangered and the flatback sea turtle does not have enough data to draw an accurate conclusion on conservation status.

Most do not reach sexual maturity before becoming prey to other organisms, or being caught by humans either intentionally or as bycatch by commercial fishing operations. Their slow maturity rate, which most of the time means about 10 or 15 years, does not allow the turtles which have been caught to have fully reproductively matured and to have produced hatchlings of their own. International legislation has been put into place to attempt to reduce the number of sea turtle deaths but this does not deter the demand for the consumption of turtle eggs around the world, and some are hunted for their shells.

In addition to this, turtles face another threat which has been theorized as being linked to human pollution. A growing number of turtles have been found with fibropapillomatosis, fibrous tumor growths on their skin, mouths, and even internal organs. In some areas the number of infected turtles is over 70%. It is unknown what the effects of the growths will have in the long term for sea turtle populations.

Sea turtles play a very important part in marine ecosystems. They maintain the balance of health of sea grasses and reefs, which in turn benefit the likes of shrimp, lobsters, and tunas. They are also the last living members of the seafaring category of marine reptiles that have been in existence on Earth for at least the past 100 million years. They are also highly significant to multiple cultures and are also popular animals in tourism, which gives a higher importance to their conservation.

<text>The Kzinti (singular: Kzin) are an alien cat-like species developed by Larry Niven in his &quot;Known Space&quot; series.

The Kzinti were initially introduced in Niven&#x27;s story &quot;The Warriors&quot; (originally in &quot;Worlds of If&quot; (1966), collected in &quot;Tales of Known Space&quot; (1975)) and &quot;The Soft Weapon&quot; (1967), collected in &quot;Neutron Star&quot; (1968). A Kzin character, Speaker-to-Animals (later known as Chmeee), subsequently played a significant role in Niven&#x27;s Hugo and Nebula award-winning &quot;Ringworld&quot; (1970) and &quot;Ringworld Engineers&quot; (1980), giving considerably more background on the Kzinti and their interactions with human civilizations. Following &quot;Ringworld&quot;, Niven permitted several friends to write stories taking place in the time following &quot;The Warriors&quot; but before &quot;The Soft Weapon&quot;; These stories (including a handful by Niven) were collected in some volumes of &quot;The Man-Kzin Wars&quot;, which eventually reached fourteen volumes, the first published in June 1988. Kzinti also appears in &quot;Juggler of Worlds&quot; (2008) and &quot;Fate of Worlds&quot; (2012), novels within the Fleet of Worlds series (cowritten with Edward M. Lerner).

The Kzinti were also written by Niven into the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe, appearing first in &quot;Star Trek: The Animated Series&quot;. Similar characters also appeared in &quot;Star Trek: Lower Decks&quot; and in &quot;Star Fleet Universe&quot;, as well as material for &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; that was never produced because of the series&#x27; cancellation.

== Background and history ==
Kzinti evolved from a plains-hunting felid, on a planet slightly colder and drier than Earth. The Kzin word for their home planet translates as Homeworld, often known as Kzinhome, among the Kzinti themselves. It is the third planet orbiting the star 61 Ursae Majoris.

The Kzin civilization was at an iron-age technological level, when an alien race called the Jotoki landed, and made stealthy first contact with a tribe of primitive hunter/gatherer Kzinti: they were interstellar merchants, looking for a species they could use as mercenaries.

Once the Jotok had taught the Kzinti how to use high-tech weapons, and other devices (including spacecraft), the Kzin rebelled, and made their former masters into slaves -- as well as the occasional meal. The crest of the Riit (Royal) family appears to be a bite mark -- though it is in fact a dentate leaf, with the words &quot;From mercenary to master.&quot;, written around it in Kzinti script.

Kzin society is extremely male-dominated. The leader of the race is called the Patriarch, and is a hereditary title. The Kzinti call themselves &quot;heroes&quot; or the &quot;Hero Race&quot;, and because they believe themselves to be &quot;heroes&quot;, their society places a very high value on &quot;acting Heroic&quot;, and behaving in a heroic fashion.

To Kzin society, &quot;heroic&quot; means being honorable, and having integrity. Kzin honor, called &quot;strakh&quot;, is similar in many ways to the samurai code of Bushido. &quot;Strakh&quot; serves as almost a sort of currency or favor system, since their culture has no analog for money. For example, if the Patriarch gets meat from a seller&#x27;s market stand, the seller gains considerable &quot;strakh&quot;, which will bring honor to the seller, aiding him to attract better customers, gaining &quot;strakh&quot;, i.e. higher status within the community.

Once Kzinti gained access to genetic-manipulation technology, they used to bring out the most &quot;heroic&quot; qualities, and reduce the undesired ones. To this end -- and because females are not valued except as bearers of children -- the male-dominated Kzin society bred (most of) their own females into sub-sapience.

Kzinti are often described as &quot;anthropomorphic tigers,&quot; but there are significant, and visible, differences. Kzinti are larger than humans, standing around tall, and weighing around . These tiger-sized bipeds have large and membranous ears, a barrel-chested torso, with a flexible spine, and large fangs and claws. One human gave an apt description of Kzin as &quot;eight feet of death.&quot;

Unlike some popularly depicted anthropomorphic animals, Kzinti stand on two legs as do humans; they lack digitigrade (&quot;backward-bending&quot;) legs. Hands have three fingers, and an opposable thumb, each with a retractable claw.

Kzinti are covered with a thick coat of long fur, which comes in various combinations of orange, yellow, and black. (Full black coats are rare.) Their tails are naked, and similar in appearance to a rat&#x27;s tail; their noses are black. Kzinti ears have fur, but only on the outside of the ear, and only about halfway up the ear itself, usually appear pink, and are shaped like a segment of a Chinese parasol (or cocktail umbrella; they are also sometimes described as &quot;bat-winged&quot;). They can fold back flat against the head for protection during a fight.

Kzinti speak in a hissing language they call the &quot;Hero&#x27;s Tongue&quot;, which in its written form resembles commas and periods.

Kzinti cubs are tested by the Black Priests. Females are tested for intelligence; those who fail their tests by revealing too much intelligence are killed. Males are tested for telepathy; the ones who exhibit telepathic ability are forced into addiction of a drug derived from the lymph of an animal called a &quot;sthondat&quot;, which significantly increases telepathic ability. However, it is addictive and toxic, with long-term use, causing muscle atrophy, and thinning fur. The black-fur gene and the telepath gene are mutually exclusive; no completely black-furred Kzin is telepathic. All such cubs are taken by the Black Priests and raised within their cult.

Telepaths are tolerated by the warrior class, due to the specialized use of their skill; otherwise, they endure a low-caste position in society, just above the status of slaves; occasional a slave is considered of a higher social status. Telepaths rarely, if ever, earn a name, and they are legally forbidden to breed.

Most Kzin females (&quot;s.&quot; Kzin&quot;rret&quot;, &quot;pl.&quot; Kzin&quot;rretti&quot;) are sub-sapient, with a vocabulary of fewer than a hundred word/sounds, and primarily instinct-driven behavior, and are treated as chattel by males. (&quot;s.&quot; Kzin&quot;tosh&quot;, &quot;pl.&quot; Kzin&quot;toshi&quot;) This was not always the case: archaic Kzinrretti were sapient, until the Kzin used Jotoki biotechnology to reduce them to their current state, and also boosted the martial prowess in the males. Kzin society explains this, by stating that the (perhaps male?) Fanged God removed the Kzinrretti souls, as punishment for an attempted rebellion against him, shortly after he created the Kzinti. Nevertheless, even by the period of the novels, certain bloodlines still produce sentient females (as do some, if not most, primitive tribes). These tribes, long isolated from the patriarchy, avoided genetic modifications; at least two sentient females exist on Wunderland, and a population also exist on the Ringworld.

In the Known Space universe, the Kzinti are the first ongoing alien contact that humanity has met. The first contact with humanity ends the human golden era of peace -- where even history has been rewritten with a non-violent whitewash; organized violence was virtually eliminated, being reduced to roughly 1 in 1000 people, and interpersonal violence was unknown, except for occasional outbursts in the asteroid belt, where both medical and psychological care were thinly spread.

==Naming convention==
Kzintoshi are born without names, which they must earn through valorous deeds. They are originally known by their relation to their father when they are kittens. After maturity, they are known by their rank or occupation. A Kzin who has performed a great deed will be granted a partial name by a superior; a further, greater deed earns a full name, the second of which is the family name.

In rare instances, a sufficiently illustrious accomplishment will earn a nameless one a full name in one fell swoop. An example of this is the granting of a full name to Trainer-of-Slaves, who single-handedly delivered a fully working hyperdrive to the Patriarchy in the novella &quot;The Heroic Myth of Lieutenant Nora Argamentine&quot; by Donald Kingsbury (appearing in&quot; Man-Kzin Wars VI&quot; (1994)), thus earning the full name Graaf-Nig.

An exception to this rule seems to accrue to the members of the Riit family, who have held the office of Kzinti Patriarch for uncounted generations. These appear to earn names upon reaching adulthood. However, in the 2006 novel &quot;Destiny&#x27;s Forge&quot; by author Paul Chafe, the heir apparent to the Riit throne, &quot;Pouncer&quot;, does not receive a name until it is earned by deed. (Under normal circumstances Pouncer would have received his Name automatically; however, in his position after the death of his father, earning his Name traditionally was essential to establishing his &quot;strakh&quot; as the heir to the Patriarchy.)

Only those Heroes who have earned a full name are allowed to breed. There seem to be exceptions to this, such as the reference made to Kzaargh-Commodore&#x27;s harem in the novella &quot;Catspaws&quot; by Hal Colebatch (appearing in &quot;Man-Kzin Wars XI, 2005&quot;) despite his not having yet earned a full name.

An example of a Kzin&#x27;s naming transition would be:
* Birth description: Third-Son of Khral-Hrag
* Occupation description: Weapons-Technician
* Partial name: Frep-Technician
* Full name: Frep-Hrag

==The Man-Kzin Wars==

In several different stories by other authors writing in the universe, we see references to a total of five Man-Kzin wars taking place. The net effect of these wars is summed up by a retrospective comment from Beowulf Schaeffer in the short story &quot;Grendel&quot;: &quot;The Kzinti aren&#x27;t really a threat.&quot; They&#x27;ll &quot;always&quot; attack before they&#x27;re ready&quot;, because the more certain one&#x27;s victory is before a fight begins, the less honor is to be had from it. With decreasingly impressive logistical and technological advantages, each Man-Kzin War results in the confiscation or liberation of one or more Kzinti colony planets by the humans. In this way, humanity contacts the Pierin and Kdatlyno, former slave species, and takes over worlds such as Canyon (formerly Warhead) and Fafnir (formerly Shasht). Several of the stories of the Man-Kzin Wars depict the nearest human colony at Alpha Centauri, called Wunderland, which was occupied by the Kzinti for over 50 years.

Eventually (in &quot;Ringworld),&quot; we learn that the Kzin reverses were deliberately engineered by the Pierson&#x27;s puppeteers, who lured the Outsiders to We Made It in the first place. This allowed the mayor of We Made It to purchase a faster-than-Light drive on credit from the Outsiders. Once the humans had FTL warships, the Kzinti couldn&#x27;t defeat the humans in space combat. The puppeteers had hoped that the culling of a quarter to a third of the more aggressive members of the Kzinti with every war would result in a more peaceful race, or at least one that was capable of coexisting with other species without instantly trying to kill and eat them. This shift in Kzin attitudes succeeded spectacularly, although the Kzinti themselves do not think very highly of the changes, nor of the price they paid to achieve them. In fact, a fringe faction of the Kzinti known as the Kdaptists, frustrated with the reversals their race had suffered against humanity, went so far as to adopt the human concept that God had created humanity (not the Kzinti) in His image, and that He favors and protects humans over other races.

As the puppeteers expected, a form of &quot;natural&quot; selection occurred, with the more mindlessly aggressive Kzinti dying in the wars with humans and the more moderate, intelligent, and &quot;cautious&quot; Kzinti surviving, presumably to think long and hard about the consequences of starting yet another pointless war. By the time the Kzinti attained the level of sophistication and foresight needed to win against humans, they no longer had the numbers or the drive to do so.

At one point, Louis Wu, while visiting the Kzin homeworld and given access to the Kzinti Patriarch&#x27;s game preserve, was confronted by a young Kzin and his father. When the youngster asked, &quot;Are they good to eat?&quot;, Louis Wu responded with a Kzin grin (baring of the teeth being a Kzin challenge to battle), and the older Kzin responded &quot;NO&quot;. Wu muses that the Kzin have learned that it would be safer for the young Kzin to eat arsenic than a human being.

One of the reasons humanity is such a dangerous enemy is the psychological blind spot the Kzinti have toward human females. Since the Kzinti have bred intelligence out of their own females, an inexperienced Kzin is sometimes careless enough to leave human females to their own devices, usually with fatal results for that particular Kzin. It has been further described in the novels that a combat-trained human female is a hero&#x27;s worst nightmare. The Kzinti term for any particularly competent human female soldier is &quot;Manrret&quot; (singular) or &quot;Manrretti&quot; (plural), so named out of a sense of gallows humor regarding lethal encounters with the same. From the Kzinti point of view a Manrret&#x27;s stamina, speed, reflexes, pain tolerance, and reasoning capability (enhanced intuition by virtue of increased interconnectedness between the left and right halves of the human female brain) are far superior to a man&#x27;s. This gives some Kzin reason for considering each of the genders of humanity to be a separate alien species.

On Wunderland, the leader of Kzin has developed a bond with a human female that only they understand.

== Kdaptist ==
The &quot;Kdaptists&quot; are a religious sect of the Kzin. Prior to contacting humans, the predatory Kzin had conquered every species they had encountered, but humans—who, at the time of first contact, were believed by the Kzin to be unarmed pacifists—have consistently defeated the Kzinti. This was baffling and humiliating to the Kzinti, whose own religion told them that they were the pinnacle of creation.

During the first Man-Kzin War, a fighter pilot named Kdapt-Captain was captured by the &quot;Catskinner&quot;, an artificial intelligence sent by the Terrans to the Alpha Centauri system. Kdapt-Captain was kept in near-total sensory deprivation, except for the smell of his dead and rotting shipmates. He suffered from dehydration and starvation for several days, and when he was finally rescued (by humans), claimed to have seen God.

Changing his name to Kdapt-Preacher, he settled on Wunderland and lived as a hermit, telling whomever he met that God made Man, not Kzin, in his own image. He began wearing a mask of human skin during his prayers, so that God might think he was one of His human children.

By the time of the events in &quot;Ringworld&quot;, Kdaptism had become a minor, if not tolerated, religion. Speaker-to-Animals, when confronted, tells Louis Wu that he was raised by Kdaptists but that it &#x27;didn&#x27;t take&#x27;.

==Homeworld==
The Kzin homeworld is called &quot;Kzin&quot; by all other races save the Kzinti, who call it &quot;Homeworld&quot; or &quot;Kzinhome&quot;. It orbits the star 61 Ursae Majoris and has stronger surface gravity and both a longer day and year than Earth. The Patriarch rules from a large palace on the planet. At the end of the last Man-Kzin War, around 2618, Kzin was occupied and disarmed by human armies.

==Patriarch ==
The Kzinti Patriarch is the leader of the Kzin race. As with other facets of the Kzinti culture, natural selection is used to choose the Patriarch through combat. Throughout the range of the Known Space books, the patriarchy is held by the Riit family. The patriarch has a range of privileges, including a protected hunting reserve and the authority to assign full names to Kzin who have brought glory or honor to the Kzinti empire. There are in fact two Patriarchs as the smaller, lost colony of Kzinti on the Ringworld also has a patriarch in addition to the main Kzinti empire.

== In other science fiction ==

===&quot;Star Trek&quot;===
The Kzinti appeared, along with allusions to slavers and stasis boxes, in &quot;The Slaver Weapon&quot;, an episode of &quot;Star Trek: The Animated Series&quot; adapted by Niven from his short story &quot;The Soft Weapon&quot;. &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; producer Manny Coto wanted to include the Kzinti in an episode called &quot;Kilkenny Cats&quot;, had the series continued beyond its fourth season. The Kzinti are also mentioned in dialog in the seventh episode of &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot;.

The Kzinti were incorporated into the Star Fleet Universe where they control a powerful empire known as the Kzinti Hegemony, mortal enemies of that universe&#x27;s Lyran Star Empire. It is alluded that the Kzinti and Lyrans share common ancestry, a claim both sides violently reject.

The Kzinti are also represented in the lore of the Star Fleet Battles universe tabletop gaming system, with a number of scenarios and starship sheets devoted to them.

The &quot;Star Trek Log&quot; series, written by Alan Dean Foster, hints that the Caitians are an offshoot race of archaic Kzinti (where both genders are intelligent) who have renounced conquest. According to a memory of Lieutenant M&#x27;Ress, the secondary communications officer in &quot;Star Trek Logs&quot;, the Caitian and Kzinti languages are similar enough that M&#x27;Ress can pass as a Kzin just long enough for her to send off a distress call from a Kzinti raiding ship.

The Kzinti reappear in the comic &quot;The Wristwatch Plantation&quot;, also by Niven (and which included the Bebebebeque from his &quot;Draco Tavern&quot; stories). Kzin appeared on a star map seen in several episodes of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, and a triple-breasted feline stripper from &quot;Star Trek V: The Final Frontier&quot; was referred to backstage as a &quot;Kzinrrett&quot;. The name of the Tzenkethi, mentioned in &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;, was rumored to be an almost-anagram of &quot;Kzinti&quot;.

The instruction manual for the PC game &quot;Star Trek: Starfleet Command&quot; clearly refers to the Kzinti by name in the background story for the rival race, the Lyrans. This race is introduced in &quot;Star Trek: Starfleet Command II: Empires at War&quot; by simply changing the Kzinti Hegemony to the Mirak Star League.

On May 17, 2012, the MMORPG &quot;Star Trek Online&quot; introduced the Ferasans as a playable race for the in-game Klingon Empire faction. The Ferasans were based upon the Kzinti from &quot;The Slaver Weapon&quot;, but the alternate name &quot;Ferasan&quot; had to be chosen due to legal issues.

On March 6, 2020, the Kzinti were mentioned in the seventh episode of &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot;, where William Riker mentions that they have been causing problems on the planet Nepenthe.

A Kzin crewman appears in &quot;Star Trek: Lower Decks&quot; as a minor character in several episodes starting in Season 2. In the episode &quot;The Spy Humungous&quot;, he briefly assumes a pose similar in appearance to the Kzinti design seen in &quot;The Animated Series&quot; before straightening his back into a proper humanoid posture, which he explained as essential to maintaining a commanding presence.

===&quot;Star Fleet Universe&quot;===
The Kzintis in the SFU, who have traits setting them apart (e.g., no bat ears, sentient females, Kzinti/Kzintis as singular/plural) from the Kzinti of Niven&#x27;s works, have fought wars with all of their neighbors: the Federation, the Klingon Empire, and their perennial nemesis, the Lyran Star Empire, and are long-standing allies – or more accurately, co-belligerents – of the Hydran Kingdom. The Hegemony eventually formed a tentative accord with the Federation and allied with them in the General War, but they have been involved in major wars with the Klingons and Lyrans, such as the Four Powers War and the General War itself, in which a substantial region of their territory was occupied by their Coalition enemies and two full-scale assaults were made on the Kzinti homeworld of Kzintai. Eventually, with Federation assistance, they forced the Coalition forces from their territory, but after the war ended, they were involved in a civil war as a disgruntled faction, which had been opposed to the Hegemony&#x27;s ruling Patriarch and sought refuge and developed a power base in the WYN Cluster, launched an attempted coup of the Hegemony itself in the WYN War of Return.

In the fictional variant of the Star Fleet Universe as represented in the games &quot;Star Trek: Starfleet Command II: Empires at War&quot; and &quot;Star Trek: Starfleet Command: Orion Pirates&quot; from Taldren, the Kzintis were renamed as the Mirak.

<text>Taiwan News (formerly China News) is an English and Chinese-language online newspaper and former print newspaper in the Republic of China (Taiwan). It was purchased by I-Mei Foods in the 1997, who eventually transitioned the publication to a fully online venture. I-Mei also publishes the Chinese-language news weekly of the same name.

The publication has a roster of foreign and Taiwanese reporters. It has business partnerships with Media Outreach, PR Newswire, Reuters, and Report Ocean.

== Editorial position ==
Under the ownership of I-Mei Foods, &quot;Taiwan News&quot; changed its editorial stance from being pro-KMT to being in favor of the Pan-Green coalition and Taiwan independence. According to former editor Anthony Lawrance, &quot;Taiwan News&quot; opposes autocracies and the People&#x27;s Republic of China. In the late 1990s, &quot;Taiwan News&quot; rejected Chinese unification as advocated by the Kuomintang and associations of Taiwan with the People&#x27;s Republic of China under the &quot;one country, two systems&quot; principle.

==History==
&quot;China News&quot; was founded on 6 June 1949 in Taipei by James Wei, a journalist with close ties to the KMT and former employee of the Ministry of Information. The newspaper was established to cater for foreign residents and the local population in Taiwan. At the time it was the only English-language daily newspaper in Taiwan and it was a newspaper published in the afternoon. Later on, in order to compete with its new competitor, &quot;China News&quot; had to change and was published in the morning in order not to lose its advertisements.

In 1960, the newspaper switched to block printing in a full-size page format.

Wei left the newspaper in 1965. Wei was also a Reuters correspondent and deputy director of the Central News Agency. During his later years he was the sixth Director of the Government Information Office, serving from October 31, 1966, to June 1, 1972. Wei was a close advisor to Chiang Ching-kuo.

&quot;China News&quot; ran into financial difficulties in 1996 and received capital injection from I-Mei Foods, but the management of the newspaper was unchanged. In May 1999, I-Mei Foods acquired 50 percent stake in the newspaper for NTD$60 million (US$1.8 million). The newspaper&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Taiwan News&quot; to reflect the newspaper&#x27;s new focus on readers in Taiwan and to avoid confusion with &quot;China Daily&quot; and China News Service. After the change in ownership, &quot;Taiwan News&quot; increased its page count and lowered staff wages. Under the ownership of I-Mei Foods, Simone Wei became the newspaper&#x27;s chairperson and I-Mei CEO Kao Chih-ming became the publisher.

By 1998, 63 percent of &quot;Taiwan News&quot;&#x27; readership were local readers and the rest were businesspeople, diplomats, academics, teachers and students from outside Taiwan. Former editor Anthony Lawrance said in 2001 that &quot;Taiwan News&quot; mainly republished wire stories and had few articles with original reporting due to a lack of financial resources to hire English-speaking journalists and produce good translations from Chinese news articles, the high turnover of foreign editorial staff and the absence of an English speaking environment in Taiwan.

In 2010, &quot;Taiwan News&quot; went digital and simultaneously ended its weekly financial and cultural magazine. In 2015, &quot;Taiwan News&quot; became an all-digital publication when it ended all print editions.

<text>The leatherback sea turtle (Dermochelys coriacea), sometimes called the lute turtle, leathery turtle or simply the luth, is the largest of all living turtles and the heaviest non-crocodilian reptile, reaching lengths of up to and weights of . It is the only living species in the genus Dermochelys and family Dermochelyidae. It can easily be differentiated from other modern sea turtles by its lack of a bony shell; instead, its carapace is covered by oily flesh and flexible, leather-like skin, for which it is named. Leatherback turtles have a global range, although there are multiple distinct subpopulations. The species as a whole is considered vulnerable, and some of its subpopulations are critically endangered.

==Taxonomy and evolution==

===Taxonomy===
&quot;Dermochelys coriacea&quot; is the only species in genus &quot;Dermochelys&quot;. The genus, in turn, contains the only extant member of the family Dermochelyidae.

Domenico Agostino Vandelli named the species first in 1761 as &quot;Testudo coriacea&quot; after an animal captured at Ostia and donated to the University of Padua by Pope Clement XIII. In 1816, French zoologist Henri Blainville coined the term &quot;Dermochelys&quot;. The leatherback was then reclassified as &quot;Dermochelys coriacea&quot;. In 1843, the zoologist Leopold Fitzinger put the genus in its own family, Dermochelyidae. In 1884, the American naturalist Samuel Garman described the species as &quot;Sphargis coriacea schlegelii&quot;. The two were then united in &quot;D. coriacea&quot;, with each given subspecies status as &quot;D. c. coriacea&quot; and &quot;D. c. schlegelii&quot;. The subspecies were later labeled invalid synonyms of &quot;D. coriacea&quot;.

Both the turtle&#x27;s common and scientific names come from the leathery texture and appearance of its carapace (&quot;Dermochelys coriacea&quot; literally translates to &quot;Leathery Skin-turtle&quot;). Older names include &quot;leathery turtle&quot; and &quot;trunk turtle&quot;. The common names incorporating &quot;lute&quot; and &quot;luth&quot; compare the seven ridges that run the length of the animal&#x27;s back to the seven strings on the musical instrument of the same name, but are more likely derived from the lute&#x27;s ribbed back which is in the form of a shell.

===Evolution===
Relatives of modern leatherback turtles have existed in relatively the same form since the first true sea turtles evolved over 110 million years ago during the Cretaceous period. The dermochelyids are relatives of the family Cheloniidae, which contains the other six extant sea turtle species. However, their sister taxon is the extinct family Protostegidae that included other species that did not have a hard carapace.

==Anatomy and physiology==

Leatherback turtles have the most hydrodynamic body of any sea turtle, with a large, teardrop-shaped body. A large pair of front flippers powers the turtles through the water. Like other sea turtles, the leatherback has flattened forelimbs adapted for swimming in the open ocean. Claws are absent from both pairs of flippers. The leatherback&#x27;s flippers are the largest in proportion to its body among extant sea turtles. Leatherback&#x27;s front flippers can grow up to in large specimens, the largest flippers (even in comparison to its body) of any sea turtle.

The leatherback has several characteristics that distinguish it from other sea turtles. Its most notable feature is the lack of a bony carapace. Instead of scutes, it has thick, leathery skin with embedded minuscule osteoderms. Seven distinct ridges rise from the carapace, crossing from the cranial to caudal margin of the turtle&#x27;s back. Leatherbacks are unique among reptiles in that their scales lack β-keratin. The entire turtle&#x27;s dorsal surface is colored dark grey to black, with a scattering of white blotches and spots. Demonstrating countershading, the turtle&#x27;s underside is lightly colored. Instead of teeth, the leatherback turtle has points on the tomium of its upper lip, with backwards spines in its throat (esophagus) to help it swallow food and to stop its prey from escaping once caught. 
&quot;D. coriacea&quot; adults average in curved carapace length (CCL), in total length, and in weight. In the Caribbean, the mean size of adults was reported at in weight and in CCL. Similarly, those nesting in French Guiana, weighed an average of and measured in CCL. The largest verified specimen ever found was discovered on the Pakistani beach of Sandspit and measured in CCL and in weight. A previous contender, the &quot;Harlech turtle&quot;, was purportedly in CCL and in weight, however recent inspection of its remains housed at the National Museum Cardiff have found that its true CCL is closer to , casting doubt on the accuracy of the claimed weight, as well. On the other hand, one scientific paper has claimed that the species can weigh up to without providing more verifiable detail. The leatherback turtle is scarcely larger than any other sea turtle upon hatching, as they average in carapace length and weigh around when freshly hatched.

&quot;D. coriacea&quot; exhibits several anatomical characteristics believed to be associated with a life in cold waters, including an extensive covering of brown adipose tissue, temperature-independent swimming muscles, countercurrent heat exchangers between the large front flippers and the core body, and an extensive network of countercurrent heat exchangers surrounding the trachea.

=== Mechanical properties ===
The carapace of the leatherback sea turtle has a unique design which enables the sea turtles to withstand high hydrostatic pressures as they dive to depths of 1200 m. Unlike other sea turtles, the leatherback sea turtle has a soft, leathery skin which covers the osteoderms rather than a hard keratinous shell. The osteoderms are made up of bone-like hydroxyapatite/collagen tissue and have jagged edges, referred to as teeth. These osteoderms are connected by a configuration of interpenetrating extremities called sutures that provide flexibility to the carapace, enabling in plane and out of plane movement between osteoderms. This is important since the lungs, and thus the carapace, expand when taking in air and contract when deep diving.

The sutures connect rigid elements and flexible joints in a zig-zag configuration, so there is no region where teeth can easily penetrate the carapace. There are two main failure mechanisms for the tires in tension: tooth failure corresponding to mineral-brittle failure; and interfacial failure between teeth corresponding to collagen-ductile failure. The triangular tooth geometry is able to evenly distribute load and absorb energy. This leads to a high strength in tension since this geometry takes advantage of the tensile strength of bone and the interface. Additionally, the carapace is tough because sutures prevent crack propagation.  Under load, cracks interact with the sutures which can resist crack growth via crack bridging. This phenomenon was observed in sequential compression of osteoderm samples.

===Physiology===
Leatherbacks have been viewed as unique among extant non-avian reptiles for their ability to maintain high body temperatures using metabolically generated heat, or endothermy. Initial studies on their metabolic rates found leatherbacks had resting metabolisms around three times higher than expected for reptiles of their size. However, recent studies using reptile representatives encompassing all the size ranges leatherbacks pass through during ontogeny discovered the resting metabolic rate of a large &quot;D. coriacea&quot; is not significantly different from predicted results based on allometry.

Rather than using a high resting metabolism, leatherbacks appear to take advantage of a high activity rate. Studies on wild &quot;D. coriacea&quot; discovered individuals may spend as little as 0.1% of the day resting. This constant swimming creates muscle-derived heat. Coupled with their countercurrent heat exchangers, insulating fat covering, and large size, leatherbacks are able to maintain high temperature differentials compared to the surrounding water. Adult leatherbacks have been found with core body temperatures that were above the water in which they were swimming.

Leatherback turtles are one of the deepest-diving marine animals. Individuals have been recorded diving to depths as great as .
Typical dive durations are between 3 and 8 minutes, with dives of 30–70 minutes occurring infrequently.

They are also the fastest-moving non-avian reptiles. The 1992 edition of the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; lists the leatherback turtle moving at in the water. More typically, they swim at .

==Distribution==
The leatherback turtle is a species with a cosmopolitan global range. Of all the extant sea turtle species, &quot;D. coriacea&quot; has the widest distribution, reaching as far north as Alaska and Norway and as far south as Cape Agulhas in Africa and the southernmost tip of New Zealand. The leatherback is found in all tropical and subtropical oceans, and its range extends well into the Arctic Circle.

The three major, genetically distinct populations occur in the Atlantic, eastern Pacific, and western Pacific Oceans. While nesting beaches have been identified in the region, leatherback populations in the Indian Ocean remain generally unassessed and unevaluated.

Recent estimates of global nesting populations are that 26,000 to 43,000 females nest annually, which is a dramatic decline from the 115,000 estimated in 1980.

===Atlantic subpopulation===
The leatherback turtle population in the Atlantic Ocean ranges across the entire region. They range as far north as the North Sea and to the Cape of Good Hope in the south. Unlike other sea turtles, leatherback feeding areas are in colder waters, where an abundance of their jellyfish prey is found, which broadens their range. However, only a few beaches on both sides of the Atlantic provide nesting sites.

Off the Atlantic coast of Canada, leatherback turtles feed in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence near Quebec and as far north as Newfoundland and Labrador. The most significant Atlantic nesting sites are in Suriname, Guyana, French Guiana in South America, Antigua and Barbuda, and Trinidad and Tobago in the Caribbean, and Gabon in Central Africa. The beaches of Mayumba National Park in Mayumba, Gabon, host the largest nesting population on the African continent and possibly worldwide, with nearly 30,000 turtles visiting its beaches each year between October and April. Off the northeastern coast of the South American continent, a few select beaches between French Guiana and Suriname are primary nesting sites of several species of sea turtles, the majority being leatherbacks. A few hundred nest annually on the eastern coast of Florida. In Costa Rica, the beaches of Gandoca and Parismina provide nesting grounds.

===Pacific subpopulation===
Pacific leatherbacks divide into two populations. One population nests on beaches in Papua, Indonesia, and the Solomon Islands, and forages across the Pacific in the Northern Hemisphere, along the coasts of California, Oregon, and Washington in North America. The eastern Pacific population forages in the Southern Hemisphere, in waters along the western coast of South America, nesting in Mexico, Panama, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica, as well as eastern Australia.

The continental United States offers two major Pacific leatherback feeding areas. One well-studied area is just off the northwestern coast near the mouth of the Columbia River. The other American area is located in California. Further north, off the Pacific coast of Canada, leatherbacks visit the beaches of British Columbia.

Estimates by the WWF suggest only 2,300 adult females of the Pacific leatherback remain, making it the most endangered marine turtle subpopulation.

===South China Sea subpopulation===
A third possible Pacific subpopulation has been proposed, those that nest in Malaysia. This subpopulation, however, has effectively been eradicated. The beach of Rantau Abang in Terengganu, Malaysia, once had the largest nesting population in the world, hosting 10,000 nests per year. The major cause of the decline was egg consumption by humans. Conservation efforts initiated in the 1960s were ineffective because they involved excavating and incubating eggs at artificial sites which inadvertently exposed the eggs to high temperatures. It only became known in the 1980s that sea turtles undergo temperature-dependent sex determination; it is suspected that nearly all the artificially incubated hatchlings were female. In 2008, two turtles nested at Rantau Abang, and unfortunately, the eggs were infertile. Additionally, there are small nesting sites in southern Thailand where 18 turtles nested in 2021.

===Indian Ocean subpopulation===
While little research has been done on &quot;Dermochelys&quot; populations in the Indian Ocean, nesting populations are known from Sri Lanka and the Nicobar Islands. These turtles are proposed to form a separate, genetically distinct Indian Ocean subpopulation.

==Ecology and life history==
===Habitat===
Leatherback sea turtles can be found primarily in the open ocean. Scientists tracked a leatherback turtle that swam from Jen Womom beach of Tambrauw Regency in West Papua of Indonesia to the US in a foraging journey over a period of 647 days. Leatherbacks follow their jellyfish prey throughout the day, resulting in turtles &quot;preferring&quot; deeper water in the daytime, and shallower water at night (when the jellyfish rise up the water column). This hunting strategy often places turtles in very frigid waters. One individual was found actively hunting in waters where temperatures were as low as . Following each foraging dive, the leatherback would return to warmer () surface waters to regain body heat before continuing to dive into near freezing waters. Leatherback turtles are known to pursue prey deeper than 1000 m—beyond the physiological limits of all other diving tetrapods except for beaked whales and sperm whales.

Their favored breeding beaches are mainland sites facing the deep water, and they seem to avoid those sites protected by coral reefs.

===Feeding===
Adult &quot;D. coriacea&quot; turtles subsist almost entirely on jellyfish. Due to their obligate feeding nature, leatherbacks help control jellyfish populations. Leatherbacks also feed on other soft-bodied organisms, such as other cnidarians (siphonophores), tunicates (salps and pyrosomas) and cephalopods (squid). They are also believed to feed on small crustaceans (amphipods and crabs), fish (possibly symbiotes with jellies), sea urchins, snails, seagrasses, and algae.

Pacific leatherbacks migrate about across the Pacific from their nesting sites in Indonesia to eat California jellyfish. During these long traveling periods, &quot;Remora remora&quot; (common Remoras) will latch onto leatherbacks and display phoresis behavior or &#x27;hitchhiking&#x27; this represents commensalism, where one species is benefiting, while the other species is not gaining or losing anything. One cause for their endangered state is plastic bags floating in the ocean. Pacific leatherback sea turtles mistake these plastic bags for jellyfish; an estimated one-third of adults have ingested plastic. Plastic enters the oceans along the west coast of urban areas, where leatherbacks forage, with Californians using upward of 19 billion plastic bags every year. Plastic bags were banned in California in 2016.

Several species of sea turtles commonly ingest plastic marine debris, and even small quantities of debris can kill sea turtles by obstructing their digestive tracts. Nutrient dilution, which occurs when plastics displace food in the gut, affects the nutrient gain and consequently the growth of sea turtles. Ingestion of marine debris and slowed nutrient gain leads to increased time for sexual maturation that may affect future reproductive behaviors. These turtles have the highest risk of encountering and ingesting plastic bags offshore of San Francisco Bay, the Columbia River mouth, and Puget Sound.

===Lifespan===
Very little is known of the species&#x27; lifespan. Some reports claim &quot;30 years or more&quot;, while others state &quot;50 years or more&quot; and upper estimates exceed 100 years. 
In 2020, researchers from CSIRO, Australia&#x27;s National Science Agency, developed a method to calculate the natural lifespan of vertebrate animals by leveraging genetic markers and known lifespans of various species. From the genomic sequencing of DNA samples taken from five different marine turtle species, the natural lifespan of the Leatherback turtle was calculated at 90.4 years.

===Death and decomposition===
Dead leatherbacks that wash ashore are microecosystems while decomposing. In 1996, a drowned carcass held sarcophagid and calliphorid flies after being picked open by a pair of &quot;Coragyps atratus&quot; vultures. Infestation by carrion-eating beetles of the families Scarabaeidae, Carabidae, and Tenebrionidae soon followed. After days of decomposition, beetles from the families Histeridae and Staphylinidae and anthomyiid flies invaded the corpse, as well. Organisms from more than a dozen families took part in consuming the carcass.

===Life history===

====Predation====
Leatherback turtles face many predators in their early lives. Eggs may be preyed on by a diversity of coastal predators, including ghost crabs, monitor lizards, raccoons, coatis, dogs, coyotes, genets, mongooses, and shorebirds ranging from small plovers to large gulls. Many of the same predators feed on baby turtles as they try to get to the ocean, as well as frigatebirds and varied raptors. Once in the ocean, young leatherbacks face predation from cephalopods, requiem sharks, and various large fish. Despite their lack of a hard shell, the huge adults face fewer serious predators, though they are occasionally overwhelmed and preyed on by very large marine predators such as killer whales, great white sharks, and tiger sharks. Nesting females have been preyed upon by jaguars in the American tropics. Nesting females in Papua New Guinea are also attacked by saltwater crocodiles.

The adult leatherback has been observed aggressively defending itself at sea from predators. A medium-sized adult was observed chasing a shark that had attempted to bite it and then turned its aggression and attacked the boat containing the humans observing the prior interaction. &quot;Dermochelys&quot; juveniles spend more of their time in tropical waters than do adults.

Adults are prone to long-distance migration. Migration occurs between the cold waters where mature leatherbacks feed, to the tropical and subtropical beaches in the regions where they hatch. In the Atlantic, females tagged in French Guiana have been recaptured on the other side of the ocean in Morocco and Spain.

====Mating====
Mating takes place at sea. Males never leave the water once they enter it, unlike females, which nest on land. After encountering a female (which possibly exudes a pheromone to signal her reproductive status), the male uses head movements, nuzzling, biting, or flipper movements to determine her receptiveness. Males can mate every year but the females mate every two to three years. Fertilization is internal, and multiple males usually mate with a single female. This polyandry does not provide the offspring with any special advantages.
Female leatherbacks are known to nest up to 10 times in a single nesting season giving them the shortest internesting interval of all sea turtles.

====Offspring====

While other sea turtle species almost always return to their hatching beach, leatherbacks may choose another beach within the region. They choose beaches with soft sand because their softer shells and plastrons are easily damaged by hard rocks. Nesting beaches also have shallower approach angles from the sea. This is a vulnerability for the turtles because such beaches easily erode. They nest at night when the risk of predation and heat stress is lowest. As leatherback turtles spend the vast majority of their lives in the ocean, their eyes are not well adapted to night vision on land. The typical nesting environment includes a dark forested area adjacent to the beach. The contrast between this dark forest and the brighter, moonlit ocean provides directionality for the females. They nest towards the dark and then return to the ocean and the light. The mean time it takes to complete a nesting event from landing to departure is 108.1 minutes.
Females excavate a nest above the high-tide line with their flippers. One female may lay as many as nine clutches in one breeding season. About nine days pass between nesting events. Average clutch size is around 110 eggs, 85% of which are viable. After laying, the female carefully back-fills the nest, disguising it from predators with a scattering of sand. With the average clutch size being around 110, around 50 percent of the eggs do not even develop into hatchlings. This only causes more concern for the species, because it makes management much harder to determine.

====Development of offspring====
Cleavage of the cell begins within hours of fertilization, but development is suspended during the gastrulation period of movements and infoldings of embryonic cells, while the eggs are being laid. Development then resumes, but embryos remain extremely susceptible to movement-induced mortality until the membranes fully develop after incubating for 20 to 25 days. The structural differentiation of body and organs (organogenesis) soon follows. The eggs hatch in about 60 to 70 days. As with other reptiles, the nest&#x27;s ambient temperature determines the sex of the hatchings. After nightfall, the hatchings dig to the surface and walk to the sea. The morphology of offspring has been found to vary with nest incubation temperatures. Higher temperatures resulted in lower mass, smaller appendages, narrower carapace widths, and shorter flipper lengths while lower temperatures resulted in greater mass, wider appendage widths, wider carapace widths, and longer flipper lengths.

Leatherback nesting seasons vary by location; it occurs from February to July in Parismina, Costa Rica. Farther east in French Guiana, nesting is from March to August. Atlantic leatherbacks nest between February and July from South Carolina in the United States to the United States Virgin Islands in the Caribbean and to Suriname and Guyana.

==Importance to humans==
People around the world still harvest sea turtle eggs. Asian exploitation of turtle nests has been cited as the most significant factor for the species&#x27; global population decline. In Southeast Asia, egg harvesting in countries such as Thailand and Malaysia has led to a near-total collapse of local nesting populations. In Malaysia, where the turtle is practically locally extinct, the eggs are considered a delicacy. In the Caribbean, some cultures consider the eggs to be aphrodisiacs.

They are also a major jellyfish predator, which helps keep populations in check. This bears importance to humans, as jellyfish diets consist largely of larval fish, the adults of which are commercially fished by humans.

=== Cultural significance ===

The turtle is known to be of cultural significance to tribes all over the world. The Seri people, from the Mexican state of Sonora, find the leatherback sea turtle culturally significant because it is one of their five main creators. The Seri people devote ceremonies and fiestas to the turtle when one is caught and then released back into the environment. The Seri people have noticed the drastic decline in turtle populations over the years and created a conservation movement to help this. The group, made up of both youth and elders from the tribe, is called Grupo Tortuguero Comaac. They use both traditional ecological knowledge and Western technology to help manage the turtle populations and protect the turtle&#x27;s natural environment.

In the Malaysian state of Terengganu, the turtle is the state&#x27;s main animal and is usually seen in tourism ads.

On the South Island of New Zealand&#x27;s Banks Peninsula the leatherback turtle has great spiritual significance to the Koukourārata hapū of te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu, as well as wider significance in Te Ao Māori and to the peoples of greater Polynesia according to the protocols of each rohe. In 2021, a leatherback sea turtle was laid to rest by New Zealand&#x27;s Department of Conservation in a hilltop cave on the Peninsula&#x27;s Horomaka Island dug by hapū and in accordance with their rohe&#x27;s ley lines, according to New Zealand&#x27;s state broadcaster, Radio New Zealand.

==Conservation==
Leatherback turtles have few natural predators once they mature; they are most vulnerable to predation in their early life stages. Birds, small mammals, and other opportunists dig up the nests of turtles and consume eggs. Shorebirds and crustaceans prey on the hatchlings scrambling for the sea. Once they enter the water, they become prey to predatory fish and cephalopods.

Leatherbacks have slightly fewer human-related threats than other sea turtle species, however, turtle-fishery interactions may play a larger role than previously recognized. Their flesh contains too much oil and fat to be considered palatable, reducing the demand. However, human activity still endangers leatherback turtles in direct and indirect ways. Directly, a few are caught for their meat by subsistence fisheries. Nests are raided by humans in places such as Southeast Asia. In the state of Florida, there have been 603 leatherback strandings between 1980 and 2014. Almost one-quarter (23.5%) of leatherback strandings are due to vessel-strike injuries, which is the highest cause of strandings. 
Light pollution is a serious threat to sea turtle hatchlings which have a strong attraction to light. Human-generated light from streetlights and buildings causes hatchlings to become disoriented, crawling toward the light and away from the beach. Hatchlings are attracted to light because the lightest area on a natural beach is the horizon over the ocean, the darkest area is the dunes or forest. On Florida&#x27;s Atlantic coast, some beaches with high turtle nesting density have lost thousands of hatchlings due to artificial light.

Many human activities indirectly harm &quot;Dermochelys&quot; populations. As a pelagic species, &quot;D. coriacea&quot; is occasionally caught as bycatch. Entanglement in lobster pot ropes is another hazard the animals face. As the largest living sea turtles, turtle excluder devices can be ineffective with mature adults. In the eastern Pacific alone, a reported average of 1,500 mature females were accidentally caught annually in the 1990s. Pollution, both chemical and physical, can also be fatal. Many turtles die from malabsorption and intestinal blockage following the ingestion of balloons and plastic bags which resemble their jellyfish prey. Chemical pollution also has an adverse effect on &quot;Dermochelys&quot;. A high level of phthalates has been measured in their eggs&#x27; yolks. Leatherback sea turtles ranging from 1885 to 2007 were autopsied for the existence of plastic in the gastrointestinal tract. It was discovered that 34% of the cases had plastic blockage.

Due to their diet consisting of gelatinous zooplankton, the leatherback sea turtle consumes high amounts of salt. Different life stages of dead individuals from the western Atlantic Ocean were used to test the concentrations of various contaminants found in the salt glands and red blood cells. These contaminants include arsenic, cadmium, lead, mercury, and selenium. The contaminants were found in higher concentrations in the blood compared to the salt gland secretions. The length of the curve in the carapace of a turtle had a direct correlation with cadmium and mercury concentrations. Salt glands and red blood cells are potentially susceptible to high levels of contaminants being found in the oceans.

===Global initiatives===
&quot;D. coriacea&quot; is listed on CITES Appendix I, which makes export/import of this species (including parts) illegal. It has been listed as an EDGE species by the Zoological Society of London.

The species is listed in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species as VU (Vulnerable), and additionally with the following infraspecific taxa assessments:
* East Pacific Ocean subpopulation: CR (Critically Endangered)
* Northeast Indian Ocean subpopulation: DD (Data Deficient)
* Northwest Atlantic Ocean subpopulation: EN (Endangered)
* Southeast Atlantic Ocean subpopulation: DD (Data Deficient)
* Southwest Atlantic Ocean subpopulation CR (Critically Endangered)
* Southwest Indian Ocean subpopulation CR (Critically Endangered)
* West Pacific Ocean subpopulation CR (Critically Endangered)

Conserving Pacific and Eastern Atlantic populations were included among the top-ten issues in turtle conservation in the first State of the World&#x27;s Sea Turtles report published in 2006. The report noted significant declines in the Mexican, Costa Rican, and Malaysian populations. The eastern Atlantic nesting population was threatened by increased fishing pressures from eastern South American countries.

The Leatherback Trust was founded specifically to conserve sea turtles, specifically its namesake. The foundation established a sanctuary in Costa Rica, the Parque Marino Las Baulas.

===National and local initiatives===
The leatherback sea turtle is subject to different conservation laws in various countries.

The United States listed it as an endangered species on 2 June 1970. The passing of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 ratified its status. In 2012, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration designated 41,914 square miles of Pacific Ocean along California, Oregon, and Washington as &quot;critical habitat&quot;. In Canada, the Species at Risk Act made it illegal to exploit the species in Canadian waters. The Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada classified it as endangered. Ireland and Wales initiated a joint leatherback conservation effort between Swansea University and University College Cork. Funded by the European Regional Development Fund, the Irish Sea Leatherback Turtle Project focuses on research such as tagging and satellite tracking of individuals.

Earthwatch Institute, a global nonprofit that teams volunteer with scientists to conduct important environmental research, launched a program called &quot;Trinidad&#x27;s Leatherback Sea Turtles&quot;. This program strives to help save the world&#x27;s largest turtle from extinction in Matura Beach, Trinidad, as volunteers work side by side with leading scientists and a local conservation group, Nature Seekers. This tropical island off the coast of Venezuela is known for its vibrant ethnic diversity and rich cultural events. It is also the site of one of the most important nesting beaches for endangered leatherback turtles, enormous reptiles that can weigh a ton and dive deeper than many whales. Each year, more than 2,000 female leatherbacks haul themselves onto Matura Beach to lay their eggs. With leatherback populations declining more quickly than any other large animal in modern history, each turtle is precious. On this research project, Dennis Sammy of Nature Seekers and Scott Eckert of Wider Caribbean Sea Turtle Conservation Network work alongside a team of volunteers to help prevent the extinction of leatherback sea turtles.

Several Caribbean countries started conservation programs, such as the St. Kitts Sea Turtle Monitoring Network, focused on using ecotourism to highlight the leatherback&#x27;s plight. On the Atlantic coast of Costa Rica, the village of Parismina has one such initiative. Parismina is an isolated sandbar where a large number of leatherbacks lay eggs, but poachers abound. Since 1998, the village has been assisting turtles with a hatchery program. The Parismina Social Club is a charitable organization backed by American tourists and expatriates, which collects donations to fund beach patrols. In Dominica, patrollers from DomSeTCo protect leatherback nesting sites from poachers.

Mayumba National Park in Gabon, Central Africa, was created to protect Africa&#x27;s most important nesting beach. More than 30,000 turtles nest on Mayumba&#x27;s beaches between September and April each year.

In mid-2007, the Malaysian Fisheries Department revealed a plan to clone leatherback turtles to replenish the country&#x27;s rapidly declining population. Some conservation biologists, however, are skeptical of the proposed plan because cloning has only succeeded on mammals such as dogs, sheep, cats, and cattle, and uncertainties persist about cloned animals&#x27; health and lifespans. Leatherbacks used to nest in the thousands on Malaysian beaches, including those at Terengganu, where more than 3,000 females nested in the late 1960s. The last official count of nesting leatherback females on that beach was recorded to be a mere two females in 1993.

In Brazil, reproduction of the leatherback turtle is being assisted by the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources&#x27; &quot;projeto TAMAR&quot; (TAMAR project), which works to protect nests and prevent accidental kills by fishing boats. The last official count of nesting leatherback females in Brazil yielded only seven females. In January 2010, one female at Pontal do Paraná laid hundreds of eggs. Since leatherback sea turtles had been reported to nest only at Espírito Santo&#x27;s shore, but never in the state of Paraná, this unusual act brought much attention to the area, biologists have been protecting the nests and checking their eggs&#x27; temperature, although it might be that none of the eggs are fertile.

Australia&#x27;s Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 lists &quot;D. coriacea&quot; as vulnerable, while Queensland&#x27;s Nature Conservation Act 1992 lists it as endangered.

<text>China Post, officially the China Post Group Corporation, is the national postal service corporation of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. It is incorporated as a state-owned enterprise.

China Post shares its office with the sub-ministry-level government agency State Post Bureau, which regulates the national postal industry.

== History ==
The current postal service of People&#x27;s Republic of China was established in 1949. It replaced the Chunghwa Post in mainland China in 1949, as well as in the Universal Postal Union in 1972. It was formerly administered by the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications. China Post is directly supervised by the State Post Bureau which has overall responsibility for regulating postal service in China. The State Post Bureau is an agency reporting to the Ministry of Information Industry of the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

== Organizational structure ==

After the separation from the State Post Bureau and several re-organization, China Post is currently organized along the following structure.
* General Office
* Department of Strategic Planning (Legal Affairs)
* Department of Market
* Department of Financial Service
** Postal Savings Bank of China
** China Post Life Insurance
** China Post Securities
** China Post Capital Management
* Department of Finance
* Department of Human Resources
* Department of Planning and Construction
* Department of Procurement Management
* Department of Audit
* Department of Party Building Work
* Office of Inspection
* China Post Trade Union
* Unit of Parcel, Express and Logistics Business (China Postal Express and Logistice Co., Ltd.)
* China National Philatelic Corporation
* China Post Culture and History Center (China National Post and Postage Stamp Museum)
* China Post News Press
* Postage Stamp Printing Bureau (Beijing Stamp Factory)
* Shijiazhuang Posts and Telecommunications Technical College (China Post Training Center &amp; Party School)
* China Post Group IT (Beijing) Co., Ltd.
* China Post E-commerce Co.
* China Post Advertising Co., Ltd.
* Other province-level, prefecture-level and county-level branches

==China Post Service==
International services for China Post include Small Parcel, Large Package and EMS. The Small parcel and large package of China Post can be tracked if registered. According to transportation methods, it can be divided into three categories: Air Parcel, Surface Air Lift (SAL) Parcel, and Surface Parcel. China Post air mail/parcel is the most popular because it is cheap and convenient. EMS is faster than China Post Mail but more expensive.

The average delivery speed depends on the type of service and the trade and communication links with the destination country of the cargo or parcel. For instance, the delivery time for cargo from China to the USA, regardless of the service type, is approximately 19 days.

China Post does currently not offer shipping by boat to the United States from Mainland China. This policy went into effect November 2021.

<doc id="322580" wikidata="Q583074" url="?curid=322580" title="Chelidae">
<text>Chelidae is one of three living families of the turtle suborder Pleurodira, and are commonly called Austro-South American side-neck turtles. The family is distributed in Australia, New Guinea, parts of Indonesia, and throughout most of South America. It is a large family of turtles with a significant fossil history dating back to the Cretaceous. The family is entirely Gondwanan in origin, with no members found outside Gondwana, either in the present day or as a fossil.

==Description==

Like all pleurodirous turtles, the chelids withdraw their necks sideways into their shells, differing from cryptodires that fold their necks in the vertical plane. They are all highly aquatic species with webbed feet and the capacity to stay submerged for long periods of time. The snake-necked species (genera &quot;Chelus&quot;, &quot;Chelodina&quot;, and &quot;Hydromedusa&quot;) are largely strike-and-gape hunters or foragers feeding on fish, invertebrates, and gastropods. The short-necked forms are largely herbivorous or molluscivorous, but are also opportunistic, with several species having specialized to eating fruits.

The highly aquatic nature of the group is typified by the presence of cloacal breathing in some species of the genera &quot;Elseya&quot; and &quot;Rheodytes&quot;. However, some species, such as the eastern long-neck turtle (&quot;Chelodina longicollis&quot;) from Australia spend significant periods of time on land and are considered highly terrestrial.

The smaller members of the family include the Macleay River turtle (&quot;Emydura macquarii&quot;) at around 16 cm, twist-necked turtle (&quot;Platemys platycephala&quot;) at 18 cm and the western swamp turtle (&quot;Pseudemydura umbrina&quot;) at 15 cm, whereas the larger species such as the &quot;mata mata&quot; (&quot;Chelus fimbriata&quot;) and the white-throated snapping turtle (&quot;Elseya albagula&quot;) both exceed 45 cm in shell length.

Chelids exhibit XX/XY genetic sex determination, in contrast to most other turtles, which have temperature-dependent sex determination.

==Shell morphology==

Chelid turtles have unique shell morphology. The carapace often has reduced surface exposure of neural bones, or even none at all. This is due to less requirement for enlarged longissimus dorsi muscles in side-necked turtles.

The inside of the carapace is often heavily buttressed. This has sometimes been seen as a defense mechanism, that is it increases the strength of the shell against biting force, however Thomson (2003) demonstrated it is linked to feeding methods and the prevention of internal torsion of the shell. Chelids also lack mesoplastra, which separates them from the Pelomedusidae.

The cervical scute is usually present, though it is absent in some species of &quot;Elseya&quot; and &quot;Myuchelys&quot;. Otherwise, the carapace has the usual complement of four costals, five vertebrals and twelve marginals (per side). Internally, the carapace is made of eight pleurals (per side), eleven peripherals (per side), a nuchal at the front and a suprapygal and pygal at the rear of the shell. As noted earlier, neurals, although always present, often exist as subsurface elements above the vertebral column.

The plastron of chelids does not contain any hinges as can appear in some cryptodire turtles. The scute pattern is a unique feature of Pleurodira and can be used to immediately identify a shell as belonging to this suborder. All cryptodires have 12 plastral scutes, whereas pleurodires have thirteen. The extra scute is called the intergular. The rest of the scutes and the skeletal structure beneath them are the same as all turtles: paired gulars, humerals, pectorals, abdominals, and anals. The skeletal elements consist of a single entoplastron, as well as paired epiplastra, entoplastra, hyoplastra, hypoplastra and xiphiplastra (Pritchard &amp; Trebbau, 1984).

== Evolutionary history ==
The oldest records of Pan-Chelidae (the clade containing Chelidae and all other species more closely related to Chelidae than other pleurodires) first appear in the mid Cretaceous in South America and Australia, represented by &quot;Prochelidella cerrobarcinae&quot; from the Cerro Barcino Formation of Argentina, which dates from 118 to 110 million years ago, and indeterminate remains from the Griman Creek Formation, of New South Wales, Australia, dating to around 100 million years ago.

==Classification==
A number of theories of the relationships within the large chelid family have been posited. Using shared derived characters, an early attempt in the 1970s used strict parsimony to determine the three long-necked genera (&quot;Chelodina&quot;, &quot;Chelus&quot;, and &quot;Hydromedusa&quot;) were each other&#x27;s closest relatives. This was accepted for some time, but brought into scrutiny, because the major differences between the genera showed they all appeared to have evolved independently of each other, hinging on the fact that although they had long necks, how they used them and their structures were different.

A number of additional data sets were developed that used electrophoresis and nuclear and mtDNA analysis; these all agreed on the independent evolution of the three long-necked clades. This was culminated in a reanalysis of the morphological data which demonstrated the convergence of the clades on a sweep of distinctive features needed for their piscivorous diets, Thomson, 2000. The subfamilies within Chelidae show the monophyly of the majority of the South American species and all the Australian species, with the far more ancient &quot;Hydromedusa&quot; as sister taxon to both these other groups.

The family Chelidae contains about 60 species within around twenty genera:

==Phylogeny==

Relationships of the living forms based on Georges et al., 2014.

The species in the family Chelidae are distributed across Australia, New Guinea, and South America. Over time they were required to disperse out of concerns of food shortage, habitat destruction, and weather disruptions. In all of these warmer climates, they can be found in turbid waters covered by muck and the root-mats of underwater vegetation. The waters that they are found in often lack large species of fish that would put them at risk of predation.

<text>Phan Văn Khải (; 25 December 1933 – 17 March 2018) was a Vietnamese politician who served as the fifth Prime Minister of Vietnam from 25 September 1997 until his resignation on 27 June 2006. He is considered a technocratic, innovative and benevolent leader.

He was born in the countryside of Củ Chi, Ho Chi Minh City, in a family with a tradition of patriotism and fighting foreign invaders. Khải had a patriotic heart from a very early age and worked through two wars against France and the United States. Phan Văn Khải took office as prime minister on 25 September 1997. Following the path of his predecessor Võ Văn Kiệt, Khải promoted extensive international integration and led Vietnam to overcome the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis. He is a technocratic leader with more expertise in economic management and is more open-minded than his predecessors and supports Vietnam&#x27;s accession to the WTO. Due to failure to resolve the corruption situation, on 27 June 2006, Khải, together with President Trần Đức Lương and Chairman of the National Assembly Nguyễn Văn An, Voluntarily submitted a resignation letter before finishing their term.

==Life and career==
Phan Văn Khải was born on 25 December 1934 in Tan Thong Hoi commune, Củ Chi District, Saigon in French Indochina. Already during his youth he worked in revolutionary organizations. After the end of the first Indochina War and the subsequent partition of the country, Pham Van Khai took the opportunity to emigrate to North Vietnam.

Phan Văn Khải joined the revolution in 1947 and became member of the Communist Party of Vietnam on 15 July 1959.

From 1954 to 1959, he studied and worked on land reform in North Vietnam, he then studied languages, at the University of Economics in Moscow Soviet Union, until 1965.

After the war Phan Văn Khải was temporarily mayor of Ho Chi Minh City. From September 24, 1997 to June 24, 2006, he served as Prime Minister of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. He became the first Prime Minister of Vietnam to visit United States, meeting with President George W. Bush. On June 24, 2006, he announced his resignation, along with President Trần Đức Lương.

In the period from 15 December 1998 to 5 November 2001 he also served as chairman of ASEAN.

Phan Văn Khải was considered as a moderate reformer who acted in support of the country&#x27;s economic opening within the political range of Vietnam. He died on 17 March 2018 at his home in Ho Chi Minh City.

==Prime Minister (1997-2006)==

Phan Van Khai is considered a technocratic leader and has more professional capacity in economic management than his predecessors. He is the first Prime Minister of Vietnam to be trained professionally. He has an in-depth understanding of the field of macroeconomic management and also has a deeper understanding of the market economy than previous and current leaders at that time.

===Promote private economic development===

Before the period when he took over as prime minister, Vietnam&#x27;s economy was struggling to cope with the difficulties and challenges of the times, especially the fierce ideological conflicts when the leaders in the Party were still in power. Many doubts and distinctions between state-owned enterprises and private enterprises. It is these different viewpoints that have negatively affected Vietnam&#x27;s reform and opening-up process. In that context, Phan Văn Khải made great efforts to lobby the Politburo to change its view on the private economy and self-employment. He made a historic contribution by presenting the 1999 Enterprise Law to the National Assembly. The law has liberated the private economy. As head of the Government, he issued a series of important decisions, abolishing many licenses (Khải signed a decision to cancel 268/560-580 sub-licenses), and administrative procedures. cumbersome policies to create favorable conditions for the private economy to have opportunities to develop, those policies have also contributed to protecting healthy and fair competition between state-owned enterprises and private enterprise. Therefore, during his 9-year term, the private economy has had a strong rise, a series of non-state-owned companies, enterprises, and factories have gradually dominated the market and made the consumer market stronger. Domestic consumption is increasingly vibrant.

===Leading Vietnam out of the economic crisis===
In the early stages of Khải&#x27;s term as prime minister, the regional economic situation was very unstable, the 1997 Asian financial crisis had a strong impact on the Vietnamese economy. Due to the impact of the crisis, Vietnam&#x27;s economic growth was at a high level in the period 1995–1997, but in 1998 it only increased by 5.76%, in 1999 it only increased by 4.77%. Registered foreign direct investment capital in 1995 reached over 6.9 billion USD, in 1996 it reached nearly 10.2 billion USD, in 1997 it was nearly 5.6 billion USD, in 1998 it was nearly 5.1 billion USD, In 1999, it was nearly 2.6 billion USD.

Inflation if in 1996 was at 4.5%, in 1997 at 3.6%, then in 1998 it was at 9.2%. If the USD price decreased by 0.6% in 1995, increased by 1.2% in 1996, then increased by 14.2% in 1997, increased by 9.6% in 1998, etc. The growth rate of export turnover in 1996 was at 33 2%, in 1997 it was 26.6%, by 1998 it was only 1.9%. If imports increased by 36.6% in 1996, then in 1997 it would only increase by 4%, in 1998 it would decrease by 0.8%, and in 1999 it would only increase by 2.1%. Because the openness of Vietnam&#x27;s economy is not high at this time (exports compared to GDP have only reached 30%, the currency has not been converted), because there is already crude oil, rice, export exporting in large volumes, due to proactive response from within the country, Phan Van Khai has applied these factors very successfully. He has also issued many timely decisions to combat and control and restrained the crisis from spreading. As a result, not only was Vietnam not caught up in this storm of crisis, but in the following years, in the period 2001–2006, the economy prospered and inflation decreased. Controlled at a low level, the growth rate was high (over 8%/year) and kept stable for many years, causing the average economic growth rate of Vietnam during his time as prime minister to reach more than 7.1 per year.

===Promoting the process of deep integration ===

Khải is considered a leader with a moderate and progressive ideology. He has inherited and promoted many policies and strong innovative thinking of previous Prime Minister Võ Văn Kiệt. Although Vietnam officially joined the WTO not during his time in power, during his term, it was Khải and Advisor Vo Van Kiet who were the strongest supporters of the negotiation process. negotiations to join the WTO, in fact, all the most difficult and difficult conditions and preparation procedures for this event were resolved by Khải before handing over the government. to his successor Nguyễn Tấn Dũng.

===Made many important trips===
In his role as Prime Minister of Vietnam, Khải has made many official visits for the first time to many countries, especially Western countries such as Canada,Sweden, England... but most notable is his trip to the United States as a leader of a unified Vietnam, the first Vietnamese Prime Minister to make a trip to the United States. historic official visit to United States from 20 June to 25 June 2005. This trip marked a new milestone in the relationship between the two countries, especially in the economic field, many large contracts were signed.

On 21 June 2005, Khải and President of United States George W. Bush had a very successful meeting. The two leaders overcame the obstacles of cultural differences, war legacy issues, as well as different approaches to some sensitive issues.

The meeting (40 minutes) lasted 15 minutes longer than expected. President Bush, with a conciliatory attitude, highly appreciated Vietnam&#x27;s innovation achievements. The fact that the US leader acknowledged the progress in religion and human rights in Vietnam recently, affirmed his strong support for Vietnam&#x27;s accession to the WTO, and accepted the invitation to visit Vietnam in 2006 was something 10 years ago. year no one thought of. 

His trips have contributed to deepening international friendship and have also brought about many beneficial agreements for Vietnam.

===Initiation of the Prime Minister&#x27;s Advisory Committee===
During Khải&#x27;s term as prime minister, he officially established a separate advisory board for the Prime Minister and greatly trusted the organization that gathered many leading scientists in this field.

During this period, before promulgating or deciding on any important issue, he sent documents to the consulting group for consideration before and after listening to the advice, he officially made a decision. Since then, successive prime ministers after Khải have maintained the activities of this advisory group.

===Corruption problem===
Although he made great efforts to prevent corruption, in general during his 9-year term, Phan Van Khai was unable to control the evil of bureaucratic corruption, which became increasingly complex and worse. Worse, the most prominent scandal during his time as prime minister was PMU Case 18, a scandal related to corruption in the Ministry of Transport Transport (GTVT) in early 2006. This case caused a stir in public opinion in Vietnam as well as countries and organizations providing official development aid (ODA ) for Vietnam, causing Minister of Transport Đào Đình Bình to be dismissed and Permanent Deputy Minister Nguyễn Việt Tiến to be imprisoned. Prime Minister Nguyễn Tấn Dũng at the inauguration ceremony said:

&quot;I resolutely and fiercely fight corruption. If I cannot fight corruption, I will resign immediately&quot;

His quote is also related to this incident. When Khải resigned, he also apologized to the people for allowing serious corruption to take place.

===Resignation===
On 16 June 2006, he decided to retire from his position one year before the end of his term, after the Party Congress, at the National Assembly session (along with Trần Đức Lương, Nguyễn Văn An). This position is replaced by Nguyễn Tấn Dũng. In his closing speech, he apologized to the people for allowing serious corruption to take place: &quot;&quot;For serious corruption, I apologize to the people&quot;. &quot;What I am concerned about is why some weaknesses in the socio-economic and public apparatus have been recognized for a long time, and many policies and measures have been proposed to overcome them, but the change is very slow, even Even if you&#x27;re present, things will get worse.&quot;

==Personal life==
His wife was Nguyễn Thị Sáu, former deputy director of Ho Chi Minh City&#x27;s Planning and Investment Department. She died in 2012. According to the media, he has a son, Phan Minh Hoan, and a daughter, Phan Thi Bach Yen.

Phan Văn Khải passed away on March 17, 2018, at his home in Tân Thông Hội commune, Củ Chi district, Ho Chi Minh City. The visitation was held on March 20 and 21 at the Reunification Hall and the International Conference Center in Hanoi according to national mourning protocols. The memorial service took place on March 22, after which the casket was taken by hearse for burial, following his last wishes and his family&#x27;s desires.

<doc id="322582" wikidata="Q7162080" url="?curid=322582" title="PenPoint OS">
<text>The PenPoint OS was one of the earliest operating systems written specifically for graphical tablets and personal digital assistants. It was a product of GO Corporation. PenPoint OS ran on a number of Intel x86-powered tablet PCs including IBM&#x27;s ThinkPad 700T series, NCR&#x27;s 3125, 3130 and some of GRiD Systems&#x27; pen-based portables; it was later ported to the Hobbit chip in AT&amp;T Corporation&#x27;s EO Personal Communicator. PenPoint was never widely adopted.

Developers of the PenPoint OS included Robert Carr, who was involved with the Alto computer at Xerox PARC. He commissioned Dr. Tinker, the naming service company of Mark Beaulieu who generated the name &#x27;PenPoint&#x27;, using proprietary algorithms. 

==Awards and innovation==
Byte magazine awarded PenPoint best Operating System in the 1992 Byte Awards. PenPoint won in the Standards and Operating Systems category in PC Magazine&#x27;s 1991 Technical Excellence awards.

The PenPoint operating system had novel early implementations of several computing advances, including:
* a large set of gestures such as circle to edit, X to delete, and caret to insert
* using the same gestures at all levels of the operating system and applications
* press and hold for moving any selection, which showed the selection as a floating icon to drag and drop into a destination
* a rich notebook user interface metaphor: Documents existed as pages in a notebook with tabs (this was not new in PenPoint, but PenPoint was the first to make it a primary OS interface; Microsoft later did it in Windows for Pen Computing)
* a document architecture where each document was a directory nested in another document&#x27;s directory (in some sense, this was an extension of the document architecture on Multics)
* dynamic toolkit layout: this allowed applications to rescale for landscape and portrait orientation
* a system-wide pluggable address book

In April 2008, as part of a larger federal court case, the gesture features of the Windows/Tablet PC operating system and hardware were found to infringe on a patent by GO Corp. concerning user interfaces for the PenPoint OS.

==Third-party applications==
The novel user interface of PenPoint and the mobile form factor of pen computers inspired many startup software companies, including:
* Inkwriter by Aha! Software which was purchased by Microsoft and became the basis for Microsoft&#x27;s Windows Journal
* FutureWave Software (SmartSketch, a vector-drawing program that evolved into Adobe Flash)
* Glyphic Technology (Glyphic Script prototype-based programming language, with Codeworks direct interactive programming environment)
* PenMagic (Numero spreadsheet and LetterExpress document fill-in templates)
* Pensoft (Perspective personal data manager, winner of a BYTE award in 1992). Pensoft was acquired by Eo.
* Slate (several pen applications). Slate&#x27;s founders included industry luminaries Dan Bricklin and Bob Frankston.
* Gaia Software (&quot;Personal Media&quot; personal productivity applications)
* Conic Systems (LocatorGIS survey/mapping application that briefly went into production at Ordnance Survey in the UK)
* Ink Development released InkWare NoteTaker and InkWare Photo. Pierre Omidyar and Greg Stein were two of the founders. Ink Development renamed themselves eShop when they pivoted to electronic commerce software and was later acquired by Microsoft.
* Marathon Development created QuikScript, the original script handwriting word processor. QuikScript was later ported to Palm and Windows devices under the name PenScript. Patents acquired by Microsoft.

<text>:&quot;Alternatively, &quot;Pelomedusidae&quot; may refer to the Pelomedusoidea. See below for details.&quot;
Pelomedusidae is a family of freshwater turtles endemic to sub-Saharan Africa, including Madagascar, São Tomé, and the Seychelles (although this population may have been introduced by humans). They range in size from in carapace length, and are generally roundish in shape. They are unable to fully withdraw their heads into their shells, instead drawing them to the side and folding them beneath the upper edge of their shells, hence are called African side-necked turtles.

The family contains two living genera, &quot;Pelomedusa&quot; and &quot;Pelusios&quot;. They are distinguished from their closest relatives by a hinge in the front section of the plastron.

Pelomedusids spends most of their time in the mud at the bottom of rivers or shallow lakes, where they eat invertebrates, such as insects, mollusks, and worms. Many species aestivate through the dry season, burying themselves in the mud.

== Systematics and taxonomy ==
Within Pleurodira, Pelomedusidae is more closely related to the South American and Malagasy Podocnemididae than to the South American and Australian Chelidae, with the clade containing both Pelomedusidae and Podocnemididae to the exclusion of Chelidae dubbed Pelomedusoides.

Within Pelomedusidae are 2 genera and 27 extant species.

* Pelomedusa
** &quot;Pelomedusa barbata&quot;
** &quot;Pelomedusa galeata&quot;
** &quot;Pelomedusa gehafie&quot;
** &quot;Pelomedusa kobe&quot;
** &quot;Pelomedusa neumanni&quot;
** &quot;Pelomedusa olivacea&quot;
** &quot;Pelomedusa schweinfurthi&quot;
** &quot;Pelomedusa somalica&quot;
** &quot;Pelomedusa subrufa&quot;
** &quot;Pelomedusa variabilis&quot;
* Pelusios
** &quot;Pelusios adansonii&quot;
** &quot;Pelusios bechuanicus&quot;
** &quot;Pelusios broadleyi&quot;
** &quot;Pelusios carinatus&quot;
** &quot;Pelusios castaneus&quot;
** &quot;Pelusios castanoides&quot;
** &quot;Pelusios chapini&quot;
** &quot;Pelusios cupulatta&quot;
** &quot;Pelusios gabonensis&quot;
** &quot;Pelusios marani&quot;
** &quot;Pelusios nanus&quot;
** &quot;Pelusios niger&quot;
** &quot;Pelusios rhodesianus&quot;
** &quot;Pelusios sinuatus&quot;
** &quot;Pelusios subniger&quot;
** &quot;Pelusios upembae&quot;
** &quot;Pelusios williamsi&quot;
&quot;Pelusios seychellensis&quot; was originally described as an endemic species to the Seychelles based on Museum specimens from the 19th century. However, this species was never found again and thus listed as Extinct by the IUCN. However, mitochondrial evidence proved the specimens to actually be from &quot;P. castaneus&quot; thus revoking the species status of &quot;P. seychellensis&quot;.

<text>Podocnemididae is a family of pleurodire (side-necked) turtles, once widely distributed. Most of its 41 genera and 57 species are now extinct. Seven of its eight surviving species are native to South America: the genus &quot;Peltocephalus&quot;, with two species, only one of which is extant (&quot;P. dumerilianus&quot;, the Big-headed Amazon River turtle); and the genus &quot;Podocnemis&quot;, with six living species of South American side-necked river turtles and four extinct. There is also one genus native to Madagascar: &quot;Erymnochelys&quot;, the Madagascan big-headed turtle, whose single species &quot;E. madagascariensis&quot;.

Like other pleurodire turtles, podocs have a &quot;side-necked&quot; defensive posture, turning the head sideways to hide it under the shell. Another characteristic of pleurodires is that the pelvis is fused to the shell which prevents pelvic motion, making it difficult to walk on land. Podocnemididae turtles live in aquatic environments and have shells streamlined to aid in swimming.

The family notably contains the largest freshwater turtle to have ever lived, &quot;Stupendemys&quot;, which lived in South America during the Miocene epoch.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
According to Ferreira et al. (2015), the family name derives from two Greek words: &quot;podos&quot; (foot) and &quot;cnemis&quot; (leg armor worn by Roman soldiers.)

To clarify some closely related names: 
* Podocnemidae (Baur, 1893) is an alternate but less commonly-used name for the same biological group as family Podocnemididae (Cope, 1868).
* Epifamily Podocnemidinura: The family Podocnemididae has two sister families (Hamadachelys and Brasilemys); the relationship of these three families is sometimes recognized by grouping them as the epifamily Podocnemidinura. 
* Superfamily Podocnemidoidea: At a higher level yet, the epifamily Podocnemidinura is grouped with the family Bothremydidae to form the superfamily Podocnemidoidea.
* Podocnemidinae: An earlier classification, rejected by Gaffney, treated Podocnemididae as a subfamily (Podocnemidinae) within the closely related family Pelomedusidae.)

According to Gaffney et al. (2011), the family Podocnemididae can be diagnosed from its cranial traits including &quot;the unique possession of a cavum pterygoidei formed by the basisphenoid, pterygoid, prootic, and quadrate [bones], underlain by the pterygoid and basisphenoid.&quot;

The pocnemid family dates to the late Cretaceous; it includes 20 genera and 30 species. Only three genera (and eight species) survive.

The three living genera of Podocnemididae (one of which is monotypic) are:
* &quot;Erymnochelys&quot; – Madagascan big-headed turtle
*&quot;Peltocephalus&quot;
**&quot;Peltocephalus dumerilianus&quot; – Big-headed Amazon River turtle
**†&quot;Peltocephalus maturin&quot; Late Pleistocene
* &quot;Podocnemis&quot; – South American side-necked river turtles

=== Taxonomy ===
Fossils show that podocnemidids were once found in Europe, Asia, North America, and Africa. &quot;Stupendemys&quot; lived around 5.5 million years ago in northern South America, and was the largest freshwater turtle with a carapace length of , the largest of any known turtle and is the largest pleurodire known. While &quot;Peltocephalus&quot; and &quot;Erymnochelys&quot; have often been recovered as more closely related to each other than to &quot;Podocnemis&quot; in morphological analyses, genetic studies have found &quot;Erymochelys&quot; to be more closely related to &quot;Podocnemis&quot; than to &quot;Peltocephalus.&quot;

All extant podocnemidids inhabit freshwater environments, as did most fossil members, but the extinct tribe Stereogenyini are though to have inhabited marine environments, although they appear to have been restricted to shallow coastal habitats. This is comparable to the Bothremydidae, another extinct group of side-necked turtles that are also known to have inhabited marine environments.

<text>The Liberty Times is a national newspaper published in Taiwan. Founded by Lin Rong-San, it is published by the Liberty Times Group. The newspaper was first published on 17 April 1980, as Liberty Daily, before adopting its current name in 1987. In 1999, they launched their English language version, the &quot;Taipei Times&quot;.

It is one of the four most influential newspapers in Taiwan, the other three being the &quot;Apple Daily&quot;, the &quot;China Times&quot;, and the &quot;United Daily News&quot;. While the &quot;United Daily News&quot; is regarded as taking an editorial line that supports a Pan-Blue political stance, the &quot;Liberty Times&quot; is thought to take a Pan-Green pro-independence political stance.

== History ==

=== Early history ===
In 1946, the Three Principles of the People Youth League established a newspaper in Taitung, called &quot;Taitung Daobao&quot;. Initially on the verge of closure in 1948, it was taken over by Chen Zhen-zong and renamed &quot;Taitung Xinbao&quot;, becoming the first newspaper in eastern Taiwan. However, due to insufficient funding, the publication ceased in October 1950. It resumed operations in July 1952 and was later privatised by Wu A-ming in early 1961, eventually relocating to Changhua and rebranding as the &quot;Ziqiang Ribao&quot;.

=== Foundation and early development ===
The &quot;Liberty Daily&quot; was founded in April 1980 by Lin Rong-San, following his acquisition of &quot;Ziqiang Ribao&quot; for 40 million NT dollars. Despite significant investment, the paper initially suffered monthly losses of around 20 million NT.

To establish itself in the market, &quot;Liberty Daily&quot; dramatically reduced the price of small ads from 35 NT to 5 NT, attracting advertisements and filling a gap left by larger newspapers due to limited space. The paper also capitalised on the rise of lotteries, publishing columns that predicted winning numbers, which not only boosted readership but also significantly increased revenue from small ads related to lotteries. This strategy helped the paper balance its finances, with circulation rising from 30,000 to 40,000 copies and monthly ad revenue exceeding a million NT.

Government measures later restricted the paper’s lottery-related content, leading to a decline in circulation and advertising revenue. In 1986, &quot;Liberty Daily&quot; relocated to Taipei and underwent a major reform, shifting its focus towards promoting &quot;Taiwan&quot; over the &quot;Republic of China&quot; and prioritising local perspectives, with the slogan &quot;Taiwan above all, priority to freedom.&quot;

=== Post-media control era ===
In 1988, Taiwan lifted media controls, and &quot;Liberty Daily&quot; was rebranded as &quot;Liberty Times&quot;. Immediately following the liberalisation, the &quot;United Daily News&quot; and the &quot;China Times&quot; faced a steep decline in sales after raising their prices. In contrast, &quot;Liberty Daily&quot;, which kept its price at NT$10, saw its readership surge from 14.2% to 21.7%. The paper adopted an aggressive distribution policy, including recruiting employees from the &quot;United Daily News&quot; and the &quot;China Times&quot; distribution networks by offering better pay.

The paper experienced rapid growth, with circulation increasing from 185,000 in 1988 to over a million by 1996, becoming Taiwan&#x27;s most popular newspaper. On June 15, 1999, Lin launched the &quot;Taipei Times&quot;, an English-language daily, establishing the Liberty Times group. After 1996, &quot;Liberty Times&quot; remained the leading Taiwanese daily, but from 1999 onwards, its readership began to erode. Additionally, its advertising revenue remained smaller than that of its competitors: in 2001, it accounted for 18% of the market, compared to 25% for &quot;United Daily News&quot; and 24% for &quot;China Times&quot;.

In 2003, the launch of &quot;Apple Daily&quot; in Taiwan shook the existing newspaper landscape, quickly attracting a significant readership. However, &quot;Liberty Times&quot; retained its position as the leading newspaper, with a readership of 19.1%. By 2009, it had become the second most popular newspaper after Apple Daily, with a readership of 25%.

== Political positions ==
The &quot;Liberty Times&quot; has been notably partisan, at times opportunistically aligning with the prevailing political forces. In 2000, it supported the Kuomintang (KMT) presidential candidate Lien Chan, but by 2004, it shifted its support to the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)&#x27;s candidate, Chen Shui-bian. The &quot;Liberty Times&quot; developed strong connections with the newly elected DPP government after 2000, effectively transitioning from backing the liberal faction of the KMT to supporting the DPP. Meanwhile, its chief competitors, &quot;United Daily News&quot; and &quot;China Times&quot;, faced growing commercial pressure to increase their coverage of issues important to the increasingly assertive pro-independence movement. 

Since 2008, the newspaper has consistently supported the DPP and its agenda to promote the Taiwan identity. In a survey published in 2022, the newspaper was believed to support the Pan-Green Coalition and had a China-critical leaning. It is regarded as a major propaganda outlet of hardline Taiwan independence activists, which also criticised even the moderate policies of President Tsai Ing-wen from the DPP.

== Reputations ==
In 2024, a survey conducted by the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism found that 41% of respondents trusted the &quot;Liberty Times&quot;, while 25% expressed distrust. In comparison, the most trusted media outlets garnered 59% trust, whereas the least trusted had a trust level of 38%.

<text>GO Corporation was a company founded in 1987 to create pen-based portable computers, and a pen-based operating system and software. It was a pioneer of pen-based computing and was one of the most well-funded start-up companies of its time.

Its founders were Jerry Kaplan, Robert Carr, and Kevin Doren. Mr. Kaplan subsequently chronicled the history of the company in his book &quot;Startup: A Silicon Valley Adventure&quot;. Omid Kordestani, former Senior VP of Global Business at Google, began his startup career with GO Corporation. Other notable GO alumni include CEO Bill Campbell (who later became chairman of Intuit), VP Sales Stratton Sclavos (took VeriSign public as its CEO), CFO and VP of Business Operations Randy Komisar (became CEO of LucasArts), and VP Marketing Mike Homer (was VP Marketing at time of Netscape&#x27;s IPO in 1995).

==History==
GO developed the PenPoint OS software, and an Intel 286-based lightweight &quot;Go Computer&quot; specifically for developers and evaluators; the company emphasized end users would run PenPoint OS on third-party hardware. PenPoint OS ran on a number of Intel x86-powered tablet PCs from IBM (the first use of the &quot;ThinkPad&quot; brand name), NCR, and others, and on AT&amp;T&#x27;s EO Personal Communicator.

The company enjoyed high levels of public awareness and generally positive attention from industry press, but it ran into fierce competition, first from Microsoft (whose Pen Services for Windows were later the subject of an FTC investigation and patent violation suits by GO), and later from Apple&#x27;s Newton project, and others. The company lined up software development partners but struggled to deliver the hardware and software on their intended schedule. In 1991, they spun off their hardware unit under the name EO Inc. In 1993 EO was acquired by AT&amp;T Corporation, who hoped that its devices would showcase their AT&amp;T Hobbit microprocessors. This sale raised much-needed cash but introduced new problems, as EO then ceased to coordinate well with GO&#x27;s management, even considering adopting competing operating systems. Facing a cash crisis, GO agreed to sell itself to AT&amp;T as well, bringing the two halves of the company back under one roof as of January 1994.

Despite some success in vertical markets, consumers in the 1990s did not adopt tablet computing as enthusiastically as GO management had expected. In January 1994, only two weeks after acquiring GO, AT&amp;T decided to cancel the Hobbit product line, leaving it no reason to continue to support EO or GO. They had by then ceased to develop for other chips, and sales on the other platforms were small anyway. Co-founder Jerry Kaplan says that in its lifetime, the company generated &quot;no meaningful sales&quot;. The loss of AT&amp;T&#x27;s support left GO with little chance of future revenue and, after burning through $75 million of venture funding, the company closed in July 1994.

==Lawsuits==
On 29 June 2005, Kaplan filed an antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft, alleging that Microsoft technicians had stolen technology from GO that had been shown to them under a non-disclosure agreement.

In a separate legal matter, in April 2008 certain features of the Microsoft&#x27;s Windows/Tablet PC operating system and hardware were found to infringe on a patent by GO Corporation concerning user interfaces for pen computers.

<text>A steam brig is a two-masted sailing ship with auxiliary steam power. The advantage was supposed to be that the ship could sail up-wind when it was convenient, and additionally, it could use the steam power to move relative to the wind to obtain a more advantageous angle to the wind.

In practice, the disadvantages combined rather than the advantages. The type had great wind-resistance, leading to an increased use of fuel up-wind compared to a pure steam ship. At the same time, the requirement to store coal reduced the cargo space over that of a sailing ship. It thus combined the slow speed, high maintenance and poor righting (ability to resist capsize and wind) of a sailing ship with the small cargo space and fuel expense of a steam ship.

<doc id="322604" wikidata="Q191102" url="?curid=322604" title="Agamidae">
<text>Agamidae is a family containing 64 genera, 582 species of iguanian lizards indigenous to Africa, Asia, Australia, and a few in Southern Europe. Many species are commonly called dragons or dragon lizards.

==Overview==
Phylogenetically, they may be sister to the Iguanidae, and have a similar appearance. Agamids usually have well-developed, strong legs. Their tails cannot be shed and regenerated like those of geckos (and several other families such as skinks), though a certain amount of regeneration is observed in some. Many agamid species are capable of limited change of their colours to regulate their body temperature. In some species, males are more brightly coloured than females, and colours play a part in signaling and reproductive behaviours. Although agamids generally inhabit warm environments, ranging from hot deserts to tropical rainforests, at least one species, the mountain dragon, is found in cooler regions. They are particularly diverse in Australia.

This group of lizards includes some more popularly known, such as the domesticated bearded dragon, Chinese water dragon, and &quot;Uromastyx&quot; species.

One of the key distinguishing features of the agamids is their teeth, which are borne on the outer rim of their mouths (acrodonts), rather than on the inner side of their jaws (pleurodonts). This feature is shared with the chameleons and the tuatara, but is otherwise unusual among lizards. Agamid lizards are generally diurnal, with good vision, and include a number of arboreal species, in addition to ground- and rock-dwellers. Most need to bask in the sun to maintain elevated body temperatures, meaning they are heliothermic. They generally feed on insects and other arthropods (such as spiders), although for some larger species, their diet may include small reptiles or mammals, nestling birds, and flowers or other vegetable matter.

== Reproduction ==
The great majority of agamid species are oviparous. The eggs are mostly found in damp soil or rotting logs to retain enough moisture during the incubation period. The clutch size varies from four to 10 eggs for most species, and incubation period lasts around 6–8 weeks. Specifically in the Leiolepidinae subfamily of agamids, all species use a burrowing system that reaches moist soil, where eggs are deposited in late spring/early summer or at the beginning of the dry season. The Leiolepidinae burrow system is also used for daily or seasonal retreats, as it allows them to regulate their body temperature or act as a refuge from predators.

==Systematics and distribution==

Very few studies of Agamidae have been conducted. The first comprehensive assessment was by Moody (1980) followed by a more inclusive assessment by Frost and Etheridge (1989). Subsequent studies were based on mitochondrial DNA loci by Macey &quot;et al.&quot; (2000) and Honda &quot;et al.&quot; (2000) and also by sampling across the Agamidae by Joger (1991). Few other studies focused on clades within the family, and Agamidae have not been as well investigated as Iguanidae.

The agamids show a curious distribution. They are found over much of the Old World, including continental Africa, Australia, southern Asia, and sparsely in warmer regions of Europe. They are absent from Madagascar and the New World. The distribution is the opposite of that of the iguanids, which are found in just these areas, but absent in areas where agamids are found. A similar faunal divide is found in between the boas and pythons.

===Further classification===
Among Agamidae, six subfamilies are generally recognized:

* Agaminae (Africa, Europe and south Asia)
* Amphibolurinae (Australia and New Guinea, one species in Southeast Asia)
* Draconinae (South and Southeast Asia)
* Hydrosaurinae (&quot;Hydrosaurus&quot;, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, and Indonesia)
* Leiolepidinae (&quot;Leiolepis&quot;, Southeast Asia)
* Uromastycinae (&quot;Saara&quot; and &quot;Uromastyx&quot;, Africa and South Asia)

== Evolutionary history ==
The oldest known unambiguous agamid is &quot;Protodraco&quot; from the mid-Cretaceous (early Cenomanian) aged Burmese amber of Myanmar, dating to around 99 million years ago. It is similar to primitive living Southeast Asian agamids. &quot;Gueragama&quot; from the Late Cretaceous of Brazil may also be an agamid. &quot;Jeddaherdan&quot;, a supposed agamid from the Late Cretaceous of Morocco, was later shown to be actually a young subfossil of the living genus &quot;Uromastyx&quot;.

==Predator responses==
Body temperature helps determine the physiological state of agamids and affects their predator responses. A positive correlation is seen between a flight response (running speed) and body temperature of various agamid species. At higher body temperatures, these lizards tend to flee quickly from predators, whereas at lower temperatures, they tend to have a reduced running speed and show an increased fight response, where they are more likely to be aggressive and attack predators.

Certain physical features of some lizards of these species, such as frilled-neck lizards, play a role in their defensive responses, as well. During the mating season, males tend to display more of their frill, and give fight responses more often. Both males and females display their frills when they are threatened by predators, and during social interactions.

<text>James Ingram Merrill (March 3, 1926 – February 6, 1995) was an American poet. He was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for poetry in 1977 for &quot;Divine Comedies.&quot; His poetry falls into two distinct bodies of work: the polished and formalist lyric poetry of his early career, and the epic narrative of occult communication with spirits and angels, titled &quot;The Changing Light at Sandover&quot; (published in three volumes from 1976 to 1980), which dominated his later career. Although most of his published work was poetry, he also wrote essays, fiction, and plays.

==Early life==
James Ingram Merrill was born in New York City, to Charles E. Merrill (1885–1956), the founding partner of the Merrill Lynch investment firm, and Hellen Ingram Merrill (1898–2000), a society reporter and publisher from Jacksonville, Florida. He was born at a residence which would become the site of the Greenwich Village townhouse explosion, which Merrill would lament in the poem &quot;18 West 11th Street&quot; (1972).

Merrill&#x27;s parents married in 1925, the year before he was born; he would grow up with two older half siblings from his father&#x27;s first marriage, Doris Merrill Magowan and Charles E. Merrill, Jr. As a boy, Merrill enjoyed a highly privileged upbringing in educational and economic terms. His father&#x27;s 30-acre estate in Southampton, New York, for example, known as &quot;The Orchard,&quot; had been designed by Stanford White with landscaping by Frederick Law Olmsted. (The property was developed in 1980 with 29 luxury condominiums flanking the central gardens, while the home&#x27;s vast ballroom and first-floor public reception areas were preserved.) Merrill&#x27;s childhood governess taught him French and German, an experience Merrill wrote about in his 1974 poem &quot;Lost in Translation&quot;. From 1936 to 1938, Merrill attended St. Bernard&#x27;s, a prestigious New York grammar school.

&quot;I found it difficult to &quot;believe&quot; in the way my parents lived. They seemed so utterly taken up with engagements, obligations, ceremonies,&quot; Merrill would tell an interviewer in 1982. &quot;The excitement, the emotional quickening I felt in those years came usually through animals or nature, or through the servants in the house ... whose lives seemed by contrast to make such perfect &quot;sense&quot;. The gardeners had their hands in the earth. The cook was dredging things with flour, making pies. My father was merely making money, while my mother wrote names on place-cards, planned menus, and did her needlepoint.&quot; Merrill&#x27;s parents separated when he was eleven, then divorced when he was thirteen. As a teenager, Merrill boarded at the Lawrenceville School, where he befriended future novelist Frederick Buechner, began writing poetry, and undertook early literary collaborations. When Merrill was 16 years old, his father collected his short stories and poems and published them as a surprise under the name &quot;Jim&#x27;s Book.&quot; Initially pleased, Merrill would later regard the precocious book as an embarrassment. Today, it is considered a literary treasure worth thousands of dollars.

==&quot;The Black Swan&quot;==
Merrill was drafted in 1944 into the United States Army and served for eight months. His studies interrupted by war and military service, Merrill returned to Amherst College in 1945 and graduated &quot;summa cum laude&quot; and Phi Beta Kappa in 1947. Merrill&#x27;s senior thesis on French novelist Marcel Proust heralded his literary talent, and his English professor upon reading it declared to the Amherst graduating class that Jim (as he was known there) was &quot;destined for some sort of greatness.&quot; &quot;The Black Swan&quot;, a collection of poems Merrill&#x27;s Amherst professor (and lover) Kimon Friar published privately in Athens, Greece, in 1946, was printed in just one hundred copies when Merrill was 20 years old. Merrill&#x27;s first mature work, &quot;The Black Swan&quot; is among Merrill&#x27;s scarcest titles. Merrill&#x27;s first commercially published volume was &quot;First Poems&quot;, issued in 990 numbered copies by Alfred A. Knopf in 1951.

==&quot;A Different Person&quot;==
Merrill&#x27;s partner of three decades was David Jackson, a writer and artist. Merrill and Jackson met in New York City after a performance of Merrill&#x27;s play &quot;The Bait&quot; at the Comedy Club in 1953. (Poet Dylan Thomas and playwright Arthur Miller walked out of the performance.) Together, Jackson and Merrill moved to Stonington, Connecticut in 1955, purchasing a property at 107 Water Street (now the site of writer-in-residency program, the James Merrill House, which until 2024 was sponsored by the Stonington Village Improvement Association in Stonington Borough, and is now part of the James Merrill House Foundation). For most of two decades, the couple spent winters in Athens at their home at 44 Athinaion Efivon. Greek themes, locales, and characters occupy a prominent position in Merrill&#x27;s writing. In 1979, Merrill and Jackson largely abandoned Greece and began spending part of each year at Jackson&#x27;s home in Key West, Florida.

In his 1993 memoir &quot;A Different Person&quot;, Merrill revealed that he suffered writer&#x27;s block early in his career and sought psychiatric help to overcome its effects (undergoing analysis with Thomas Detre in Rome). &quot;Freedom to be oneself is all very well,&quot; he would write. &quot;The greater freedom is not to be oneself.&quot; Merrill painted a candid portrait in his memoir of gay life in the early 1950s, describing friendships and relationships with several men including Dutch poet Hans Lodeizen, Italian journalist Umberto Morra, U.S. writer Claude Fredericks, art dealer Robert Isaacson, David Jackson, and his partner from 1983 onward, actor Peter Hooten. 
==The Ingram Merrill Foundation==

A prodigious correspondent and the keeper of many confidences, Merrill&#x27;s &quot;chief pleasure was friendship&quot;. Answering to &quot;Jim&quot; in his youth and to &quot;James&quot; in published adulthood (and to &quot;JM&quot; in letters from readers), he was called &quot;Jimmy&quot;, a childhood nickname, by friends and family until the end of his life. Despite great personal wealth derived from an unbreakable trust made early in his childhood, Merrill lived modestly. (Before his father&#x27;s death, Merrill and his two siblings renounced any further inheritance from their father&#x27;s estate in exchange for $100 &quot;as full quittance&quot;; as a result, most of Charles Merrill&#x27;s estate was donated to charity, including &quot;The Orchard.&quot;)

A philanthropist in his own right, Merrill created the Ingram Merrill Foundation in the 1950s, the name of which united his divorced parents. The private foundation operated throughout the poet&#x27;s lifetime and subsidized literature, the arts, and public television, with grants directed particularly to writers and artists showing early promise. Merrill met filmmaker Maya Deren in 1945 and the poet Elizabeth Bishop a few years later, giving critical financial assistance to both and providing funds to hundreds of other writers, often anonymously.

Merrill served as a Chancellor of the Academy of American Poets from 1979 until his death. While wintering in Arizona, he died on February 6, 1995, from a heart attack related to HIV/AIDS. His ashes and the remains of David Jackson are buried side by side at Evergreen Cemetery, Stonington. Jackson&#x27;s former wife and Merrill&#x27;s friend, Doris Sewell Jackson is buried behind them.

In tribute to Merrill, &quot;The New Yorker&quot; republished his 1962 poem, &quot;The Mad Scene&quot;, in its March 19, 1995 edition.

==Awards==
Beginning with the prestigious Glascock Prize, awarded for &quot;The Black Swan&quot; when he was an undergraduate, Merrill would go on to receive every major poetry award in the United States, including the 1977 Pulitzer Prize for Poetry for &quot;Divine Comedies&quot;. Merrill was honored in mid-career with the Bollingen Prize in 1973.

Merrill received the National Book Critics Circle Award in 1983 for his epic poem &quot;The Changing Light at Sandover&quot; (composed partly of supposedly supernatural messages received via the use of a Ouija board). In 1990, he received the first Bobbitt National Prize for Poetry awarded by the Library of Congress for &quot;The Inner Room&quot;. He garnered the National Book Award for Poetry twice, in 1967 for &quot;Nights and Days&quot; and in 1979 for &quot;&quot;.
He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1978. In 1991, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

==Style==
A writer of elegance and wit, highly adept at wordplay and puns, Merrill was a master of traditional poetic meter and form who also wrote a good deal of free and blank verse. (Asked once if he would prefer a more popular readership, Merrill replied &quot;Think what one has to &quot;do&quot; to get a mass audience. I&#x27;d rather have one perfect reader. Why dynamite the pond in order to catch that single silver carp?&quot;) Though not generally considered a Confessionalist poet, James Merrill made frequent use of personal relationships to fuel his &quot;chronicles of love &amp; loss&quot; (as the speaker in &quot;&quot; called his work). The divorce of Merrill&#x27;s parents — the sense of disruption, followed by a sense of seeing the world &quot;doubled&quot; or in two ways at once — figures prominently in the poet&#x27;s verse. Merrill did not hesitate to alter small autobiographical details to improve a poem&#x27;s logic, or to serve an environmental, aesthetic, or spiritual theme.

As Merrill matured, the polished and taut brilliance of his early work yielded to a more informal, relaxed, and conversational tone. Already established in the 1970s among the finest poets of his generation, Merrill made a surprising detour when he began incorporating extensive occult messages into his work (although a poem from the 1950s, &quot;Voices from the Other World,&quot; foreshadows the practice). The result, a 560-page apocalyptic epic published as &quot;The Changing Light at Sandover&quot; (1982), documents two decades of messages dictated from otherworldly spirits during Ouija séances hosted by Merrill and his partner David Jackson. &quot;The Changing Light at Sandover&quot; is one of the longest epics in any language, and features the voices of recently deceased poet W. H. Auden, Merrill&#x27;s late friends Maya Deren and Greek socialite Maria Mitsotáki, as well as heavenly beings including the Archangel Michael. Channeling voices through a Ouija board &quot;made me think twice about the imagination,&quot; Merrill later explained. &quot;If the &quot;spirits&quot; aren&#x27;t external, how astonishing the &quot;mediums&quot; become! Victor Hugo said of his voices that they were like his own mental powers multiplied by five.&quot;

In Langdon Hammer&#x27;s &quot;James Merrill: Life and Art&quot;, Hammer quoted Alison Lurie&#x27;s writing of her experience with the Ouija board in &quot;Familiar Spirits: A Memoir of James Merrill and David Jackson&quot; as:

Lurie&#x27;s response after reading Merrill and Jackson&#x27;s collaborative effort in &quot;The Changing Light at Sandover&quot;: &quot;I sometimes had the feeling that my friend&#x27;s mind was intermittently being taken over by a stupid and possibly even evil intelligence&quot;. According to Stoker Hunt, author of &quot;Ouija: The Most Dangerous Game&quot;, before his death Merrill warned against the use of the Ouija board.

Following the publication of &quot;The Changing Light at Sandover&quot;, Merrill returned to writing shorter poetry which could be both whimsical and nostalgic: &quot;Self-Portrait in TYVEK Windbreaker&quot; (for example) is a conceit inspired by a windbreaker jacket Merrill purchased from &quot;one of those vaguely imbecile / Emporia catering to the collective unconscious / Of our time and place.&quot; The Tyvek windbreaker — &quot;DuPont contributed the seeming-frail, / Unrippable stuff first used for Priority Mail&quot; — is &quot;white with a world map.&quot; &quot;A zipper&#x27;s hiss, and the Atlantic Ocean closes / Over my blood-red T-shirt from the Gap.&quot;

<text>The International Boxing Organization (IBO) is a US based corporation that sanctions professional boxing matches and awards world and regional championships.

It is an independent organization not recognized by the &quot;big four&quot; governing bodies (WBA, WBC, IBF and WBO), who only recognize each other in their rankings and title unification rules. Despite this, as of 2023, IBO titles have been unified with titles of the other bodies in several weight divisions.
The WBC website highlights the importance of title recognition and the implications of multiple governing bodies in boxing. While the IBO operates independently, its titles being unified with the WBA, IBF, and WBO in certain divisions demonstrates how these organizations work together despite initial rivalries.

== History ==
The IBO was founded in 1988 and incorporated in Illinois in 1992 by John W. Daddono. The organization was later moved to Florida in 1997 and incorporated in Florida at that time. Ed Levine, who continues to serve as the organization&#x27;s President became a partner and President of the IBO at that time.

The organization implemented a computerized system &#x27;The Independent World Boxing Rankings&#x27; in the late 1990s that removed subjective elements from the ratings in an effort to bring more credibility to the sport. From 2014 the organization now employs Boxrec, the independent boxing records keeper and computerized rankings website to produce IBO&#x27;s rankings.

The IBO permits only one world champion per weight division. &quot;We have never had more than one champion per weight division nor will we&quot;, according to its president Ed Levine.

In addition to world champions, IBO recognizes regional champions, including the Inter-Continental champion. If an IBO Inter-Continental champion successfully defends his title three times, he may receive a mandatory opportunity for the world title.
== Characteristics ==
=== Championship format ===
One of the biggest differences between organizations is the IBO&#x27;s policy to recognize only one world champion in each weight division. In contrast, other organizations like the WBA have been criticized for having multiple championship titles in the same division, confusing fans and fighters alike. For example, the WBA often has &quot;super&quot; champions and regular champions, which muddies the waters of title recognition.

=== Regional titles ===
The IBO recognizes regional champions, including the Inter-Continental champion, and provides a clear pathway for these fighters to challenge for the world title after successful defenses.

=== Credibility and transparency ===
IBO claims their use of technology in rankings improves transparency and credibility in boxing. The other sanctioning bodies, such as the WBC and WBA, have long and storied histories, but both have come under fire for some of their rankings, which many argue are more reflective of promoters&#x27; and political influences than fighters&#x27; actual abilities. 

== Notable past IBO champions ==

<doc id="322617" wikidata="Q437310" url="?curid=322617" title="William Edward Parry">
<text>Sir William Edward Parry (19 December 1790 – 8 July 1855) was a Royal Navy officer and explorer best known for his 1819–1820 expedition through the Parry Channel, probably the most successful in the long quest for the Northwest Passage, until it was finally negotiated by Roald Amundsen in 1906. In 1827, Parry attempted one of the earliest expeditions to the North Pole. He reached 82° 45&#x27; N, setting a record for human exploration Farthest North that stood for nearly five decades before being surpassed at 83° 20&#x27; N by Albert Hastings Markham in 1875.

== Early life ==
Parry was born in Bath, Somerset, the son of Caleb Hillier Parry and Sarah Rigby. He was educated at King Edward&#x27;s School.

At the age of thirteen he joined the flagship of Admiral Sir William Cornwallis in the Channel fleet as a first-class volunteer, in 1806 became a midshipman, and in 1810 received promotion to the rank of lieutenant in the frigate &quot;Alexander&quot;, which spent the next three years in the protection of the Spitsbergen whale fishery.

Parry took advantage of this opportunity for the study and practice of astronomical observations in northern latitudes, and afterwards published the results of his studies in a small volume on &quot;Nautical Astronomy by Night&quot;. From 1813 to 1817 he served on the North American Station.

== Arctic exploration ==


=== 1818: Baffin Bay ===
In 1818 he received command of the brig in the Arctic expedition under Captain John Ross. This expedition followed the coast of Baffin Bay without making any new discoveries.

=== 1819: Halfway across the Arctic ===
Parry and many others thought that Ross was wrong to turn back after entering Lancaster Sound at the north end of Baffin Island. Partly as a result, Parry was given command of a new expedition in , accompanied by the slower under Matthew Liddon. Others on the expedition were Edward Sabine, science officer and Frederick William Beechey. For protection from ice the ships were clad with oak, had iron plates on their bows and internal cross-beams.

They also carried food in tin cans, an invention so new that there were as yet no can openers. Instead of taking Ross&#x27;s route anti-clockwise around Baffin Bay (which Ross was charting) he was able to cross the bay straight to Lancaster Sound. Fighting his way through ice he reached clear water on 28 July and entered Lancaster Sound. He passed Ross&#x27;s farthest west and kept going. Blocked by heavy ice, they went south for more than into Prince Regent Inlet before turning back.

Continuing west they passed 110° W (about west of Lancaster Strait) which entitled them to a £5,000 award offered by Parliament. Finally blocked by ice they turned back to a place Parry called Winter Harbour on the south shore of Melville Island, somewhere near 107- or 108° W. Cutting their way through new ice the ships reached anchorage on 26 September.

Here they were frozen in for the next 10 months. There were three months of total darkness and in the new year the temperature dropped to . The men were kept busy with regular exercise while the officers put on plays and produced a newspaper. The first case of scurvy was reported in January and by March fourteen men were on the sick list, about half with mild scurvy. Parry carried mustard and cress seeds and planted them in his cabin. The leaves seemed to help.

There was some excitement in early March when the first melt water appeared, but by the end of the month the ice was still thick. In June Parry led a group of men dragging a wooden cart to the north shore of the island which he named Hecla and Griper Bay. It was the first of August before the ships were able to float out of the harbour. They got as far west as 113°46&#x27;W before turning back. It was too late in the season and new ice was already beginning to form. They reached England in October 1820 having lost one man.

Parry&#x27;s voyage, which had taken him through the Parry Channel three-quarters of the way across the Canadian Arctic Archipelago was probably the single most productive voyage in the quest for the Northwest Passage. Luck was on their side; 1819 was unusually ice-free and no ship was able to travel so far west until Edward Belcher&#x27;s expedition in 1850. A narrative of the expedition, entitled &quot;Journal of a Voyage to discover a North-west Passage&quot;, appeared in 1821, publisher John Murray paying 1,000 guineas for it. Upon his return Lieutenant Parry received promotion to the rank of commander. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in February 1821.

=== 1821: West side of Foxe Basin ===
In April 1821 he again left for the Arctic commanding accompanied by under George Francis Lyon. Others with him were George Fisher, scientist and chaplain, William Hooper, purser and diarist, lieutenant Henry Parkyns Hoppner and then midshipmen Francis Crozier and James Clark Ross. Experience from the previous voyage led to improvements. The two vessels were nearly identical since &quot;Gripper&quot; had not been able to keep up with &quot;Hecla&quot;, and all the equipment was made to be entirely interchangeable. They had cork insulation, cork plugs for the portholes and an improved heating system, coal-burning stove, placed in the lowest deck to deal with cold and condensation. The men were issued better clothing and lemon juice was stored in kegs rather than glass bottles.

The goal this time was to find a passage near the northwest end of Hudson Bay. After working slowly through the ice of Hudson Strait he headed directly west to Frozen Strait which Christopher Middleton had found impassable in 1742. He passed Frozen Strait in a fog and found himself in Repulse Bay which he re-checked and found land-locked. He then ran northeast and mapped the coast of the Melville Peninsula and wintered at the southeast corner of Winter Island. From the Inuit he learned that northward the coast turned west.

In March and May Lyon led two sledging expeditions into the interior. Freed from the ice in July they then went north and found the Fury and Hecla Strait, which was ice-filled. They waited for the ice to clear, but it did not. In September Lieutenant Reid trekked west along the Strait to the ice-filled Gulf of Boothia, the north end of which Parry had approached in 1819. When new ice began to form they went a short distance southeast and wintered at Igloolik.

The ship was not freed from ice until 8 August. Since it was late in the season and there were signs of scurvy, Parry turned for home and reached Shetland in mid-October 1823. During his absence, he had been promoted to post rank in November 1821, and shortly after his return he was appointed acting Hydrographer of the Navy. His &quot;Journal of a Second Voyage, &amp;c.&quot;, appeared in 1824.

=== 1824: Loss of &quot;Fury&quot; at Prince Regent Inlet ===

In May 1824 he left London in the &quot;Hecla&quot; accompanied by Henry Parkyns Hoppner in the &quot;Fury&quot;. With them were Horatio Thomas Austin, James Clark Ross, Francis Crozier and William Hooper. The goal this time was Prince Regent Inlet at the west end of Baffin Island where he had been blocked by ice in 1819. It was a bad year for ice and he did not reach Lancaster Sound until 10 September. He entered Prince Regent Inlet but after of ice he was forced to winter at a place he called Port Bowen on the eastern shore.

In late July 1825 they freed themselves from the ice, but further south they were caught by wind and ice and the &quot;Fury&quot; was driven against the western shore and damaged by the ensuing pressure. After 48 hours work on the pumps they made an attempt to deliberately beach the ship for repairs. Stores were unloaded, but by 25 August it was clear that the keel was broken and the advancing ice forced them to abort further efforts. Most of the stores were left on the beach and the crew taken on board the &quot;Hecla&quot; which reached England in October 1825. Parry thought he could see open water south of the wreck site. He published an account of this voyage in 1826.

The wreck site, Fury Beach, near where the coast turns west became an important landmark. Sir John Ross reached it in 1829. He found the hulk gone and many stores, &quot;Fury&quot;″s boats and anchors piled on the beach. When his ship was frozen in further south he depended on those stores before being rescued. In 1850, Charles Codrington Forsyth reached it but was blocked by ice.

=== Farthest North record ===
In the following year Parry obtained the sanction of the Admiralty for an attempt on the North Pole from the northern shores of Spitsbergen at Sjuøyane. On , Parry married Isabella Louisa Stanley, daughter of John Stanley, 1st Baron Stanley of Alderley, before undertaking the expedition.

In 1827, he reached 82°45′N, which remained the highest latitude attained for the next 49 years. He published an account of this journey under the title of &quot;Narrative of the Attempt to reach the North Pole, &amp;c.&quot;.

== Later career ==

In April 1829 he was knighted. Parry served as Commissioner of the Australian Agricultural Company based at Tahlee on the northern shore of Port Stephens, New South Wales, from .

Parry was subsequently selected for the post of comptroller of the newly created department of steam machinery of the Navy, and held this office until his retirement from active service in 1846, when he was appointed captain-superintendent of Haslar Hospital. He reorganised the packet service, which had been transferred from the Post Office to the Admiralty in January 1837. Steamship companies were contracted to carry the mail, instead of naval vessels, on a regular schedule.

He attained the rank of rear-admiral in 1852, and in the following year became a governor of Greenwich Hospital, and retained this post until his death.

He died after a long illness at Bad Ems in Germany on , but his body was returned to London for burial. He is buried in Greenwich Hospital Cemetery. The cemetery is now largely cleared to create a pocket park but he is named on the west face of the Officers Monument in the centre of the area.

== Legacy ==
Parry&#x27;s character was influenced by his religiousness, and besides the journals of his different voyages he also wrote a &quot;Lecture to Seamen&quot;, and &quot;Thoughts on the Parental Character of God&quot; (1878, co-author). He was noted as &quot;an evangelical [Christian] and an ardent advocate of moral reform in the navy.&quot;

Parry also pioneered the use of canning techniques for food preservation on his Arctic voyages. However, his techniques were not infallible: in 1939 viable spores of certain heat-resistant bacteria were found in canned roast veal that had travelled with Parry to the Arctic Circle in 1824.

The crater Parry on the Moon was named after him, as were Parry County, New South Wales, Parry Sound, Ontario, and the optical phenomenon Parry arc, documented by him during the 1819–1821 expedition.

In 1930, a large sandstone rock at Winter Harbour on Melville Island marking Parry&#x27;s 1819 wintering site, approximately and , was designated a National Historic Site of Canada.

Parry Street in Cooks Hill is named after him due to his work at the A A Company.

<doc id="322619" wikidata="Q1388459" url="?curid=322619" title="H. V. Evatt">
<text>Herbert Vere &quot;Doc&quot; Evatt, (30 April 1894 – 2 November 1965) was an Australian politician and judge. He served as a justice of the High Court of Australia from 1930 to 1940, Attorney-General and Minister for External Affairs from 1941 to 1949, and leader of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) and Leader of the Opposition from 1951 to 1960. Evatt is considered one of Australia&#x27;s most prominent public intellectuals of the twentieth century.

Evatt was born in East Maitland, New South Wales, and grew up on Sydney&#x27;s North Shore. He studied law at the University of Sydney, attaining the degree of Doctor of Laws (LL.D.) in 1924. After a period in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly (1925–1930), Evatt was appointed to the High Court in 1930 by the Scullin government. He was 36 years old, and remains the youngest appointee in the court&#x27;s history. He was considered an innovative judge, but left the court to seek election to federal parliament at the 1940 federal election.

In 1941, the ALP returned to government under Prime Minister John Curtin. Evatt was appointed Attorney-General and Minister for External Affairs, positions he held under Curtin and Ben Chifley until the government&#x27;s defeat at the 1949 federal election. He served as President of the United Nations General Assembly from 1948 to 1949, and helped to draft the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. After Chifley&#x27;s death in 1951, Evatt was elected as his successor as ALP leader. Internal tensions over the party&#x27;s attitude to communism during the Cold War culminated in a party split in 1955. The ALP was defeated at three consecutive federal elections under Evatt&#x27;s leadership, in 1954, 1955 and 1958. He faced three leadership spills before being convinced to retire from politics in 1960 and accept the post of Chief Justice of New South Wales.

==Early life==
Evatt was born on 30 April 1894 at the Bank Hotel in East Maitland, New South Wales. He was the fifth of eight sons born to Jane Sophia (known as &quot;Jeanie&quot;) and John Ashmore Hamilton Evatt; two of his older brothers died in infancy. On his father&#x27;s side, Evatt was descended from an Anglo-Irish family with a history of military service – his paternal grandfather was Captain George Evatt of the 70th (Surrey) Regiment of Foot, while an uncle was Major-General Sir George Evatt. His father was born in Cawnpore (now Kanpur), India, but grew up in Dublin, Ireland. He arrived in Australia at the age of 16, and eventually settled in Morpeth, where in 1882 he married Jeanie Gray, the daughter of a marine engineer from Sydney. Evatt&#x27;s maternal grandfather was born in Shoreditch, London, England, while his maternal grandmother was born in County Limerick, Ireland. His parents – both Anglicans – moved to East Maitland in 1885, where they managed the Hunter River Hotel until 1891 and then took over the smaller Bank Hotel.

Evatt began his education at a local state school. His father suffered a protracted bout of ill health and died in October 1901, when his son was seven. The family stayed in Maitland for three more years, but eventually moved to Sydney to be closer to his mother&#x27;s family, who lived on the North Shore. She bought a home in Milsons Point overlooking Sydney Harbour, within walking distance of her parents&#x27; home in Kirribilli. The house was later demolished to make way for the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Evatt was enrolled in the Fort Street Model School, located directly across the harbour on Observatory Hill. He attended the school from 1905 to 1911, in his final year serving as head prefect and captain of the cricket and rugby union teams. He finished second in the state senior examinations, and was dux of his school.

==University==
In 1912, Evatt began studying at the University of Sydney, where he was a resident of St Andrew&#x27;s College. He graduated in 1919 with a Bachelor of Arts in mathematics, Logic, Philosophy and English with (Triple) First-Class Honours and the University Medal in Philosophy in 1915, a Master of Arts in 1916, and a Bachelor of Laws with First-Class Honours and the University Medal in 1918. At university Evatt played cricket, rugby league football, hockey and baseball. He was also the Editor of &quot;Hermes&quot;, the annual student literary journal, was a Tutor at St Andrew&#x27;s College, and the President of the University of Sydney Union from 1916 to 1917. He graduated Legum Doctor (LLD) in 1924 from the University of Sydney with a thesis on the royal prerogative. Evatt remained involved with the university after his graduation, staying on as the patron of the University Amateur Rugby League club.

==State politics==
Because of poor eyesight, Evatt was unable to serve in the First World War, in which two of his brothers were killed. He became a prominent industrial lawyer in Sydney, working mainly for trade union clients. In 1925 Evatt was elected as an Australian Labor Party member for Balmain in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly. Re-elected as an &quot;Independent Labor&quot; candidate in 1927, Evatt served in the Legislative Assembly until 1930.

==High Court (1930–1940)==
In 1930 the Labor government headed by James Scullin appointed Evatt as the youngest-ever justice of the High Court of Australia. Regarded by some as a brilliant and innovative judge, he delivered a number of minority judgments, several of which were adopted by High Court majorities decades later. Evatt could, however, be partial on the bench. Sir Owen Dixon noted in &quot;Australian Woollen Mills Ltd v F.S. Walton &amp; Co. Ltd&quot; (1937 58 CLR 641) that Evatt was on that occasion &quot;full of antagonism to the respondent ... Most unjudicial.&quot; Whenever Evatt was not particularly interested in a case he appears to have generally gone along with Dixon.

Evatt was one of six justices of the High Court who had served in the Parliament of New South Wales, along with Edmund Barton, Richard O&#x27;Connor, Adrian Knox, Albert Piddington and Edward McTiernan. In 1934 Evatt played an important part in the Egon Kisch exclusion when he ruled that the Lyons government&#x27;s ban on Kisch entering Australia had been incorrectly executed and that Kisch was free to enter the country.

==Federal politics==
In 1940, Evatt resigned from the High Court to return to politics, and was elected federal MP for the Sydney seat of Barton in the House of Representatives. . When Labor came to power under John Curtin in 1941, Evatt became Attorney-General and Foreign Minister. He became deputy leader of the Labor Party and &quot; de facto &quot; Deputy Prime Minister after the 1946 election, under the leadership of Ben Chifley. 

While in London, Evatt acted as the spokesperson for the Australian Board of Control for International Cricket and made personal representations to the Marylebone Cricket Club who were reluctant to send a cricket team to tour Australia so soon after the war. He put forward convincing arguments as to the need to re-establish sporting relations and the financial benefits of the tour and the MCC agreed to the 1946–47 Ashes series. Don Bradman would later aver that the &quot;quick resumption of Anglo-Australian Tests had justified itself in every way, psychologically, technically, financially&quot;.

Evatt was a defender of the White Australia Policy. There was a strong view in Australia that any softening of the White Australia stance might result in cheaper labour being imported from overseas. Another prevailing sentiment was that multiculturalism resulted in instability. Evatt, opposing resolutions which could have led to more Asian immigration to Australia, told the Chinese delegation at San Francisco: 
You have always insisted on the right to determine the composition of your own people. Australia wants that right now. What you are attempting to do now, Japan attempted after the last war [the First World War] and was prevented by Australia. Had we opened New Guinea and Australia to Japanese immigration then the Pacific War by now might have ended disastrously and we might have had another shambles like that experienced in Malaya.

===President of the UN General Assembly===

Evatt joined the diplomatic councils of the allies during World War II. In 1945, he played a leading role in the founding of the UN. He was President of the United Nations General Assembly from 1948 to 1949 as part of the third session of the United Nations General Assembly, and was prominent in the negotiations that led to the creation of Israel as chair of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Palestinian Question. He helped draft the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

===Leader of the Opposition (1951–1960)===

In the 1949 election, Labor was defeated by Menzies&#x27; new Liberal Party. At this election, Evatt faced war hero Nancy Wake and suffered a massive swing in his own electorate, seeing his majority reduced from a very safe 66.9 percent to an extremely marginal 53.2 percent. He faced Wake again in the double dissolution election of 1951 and was nearly defeated, seeing her off by only 243 votes (out of more than 41,600 cast). When Ben Chifley (still Labor leader) suddenly died several months later, Evatt was elected unopposed as his successor. At first his leadership went well. He campaigned successfully against Menzies&#x27; attempt to amend the Constitution to ban the Communist Party. Many convinced anti-Communists in the Labor Party believed this was both bad politics and bad policy because of the active Communist infiltration of numerous trade unions, and because of the threat to national security posed by Communism. None of the anti-Communists, aside from Stan Keon, openly censured Evatt&#x27;s stance. 

Evatt campaigned well in the 1954 election and came within four seats of defeating the Menzies government. The Labor Party actually achieved a higher two-party-preferred vote in the election than the governing Liberal-Country Coalition, but the uneven distribution of votes meant that the Coalition retained more seats and were able to hold onto government. Evatt believed that the Petrov Affair, involving the defection of a Soviet diplomat and his wife during the election campaign, had been contrived through Menzies&#x27;s conspiring with security services with the specific purpose of discrediting Evatt. In the ensuing Royal Commission on Espionage, documents tendered were alleged to provide evidence of an extensive Soviet spy ring in Australia, and named (among many others), two of Evatt&#x27;s staff members. Evatt appeared before the Royal Commission as attorney for his staff members. His cross-examination of the key ASIO operative Michael Bialoguski transformed the commission&#x27;s hearings and greatly perturbed the government. The Royal Commission quickly withdrew Evatt&#x27;s leave to appear. Evatt claimed this denial was because of judicial bias in favour of the Menzies government. 

Evatt&#x27;s loss of the election and his belief that Menzies had conspired with ASIO to contrive Petrov&#x27;s defection led to criticism within the Labor Party of his decision to appear before the Royal Commission. He compounded this by writing to the Soviet Foreign Minister, Vyacheslav Molotov, asking if allegations of Soviet espionage in Australia were true. When Molotov replied, naturally denying the allegations, Evatt read the letter out in Parliament, bringing the House into silence momentarily before both sides of Parliament began laughing.

Evatt also blamed the Catholic-dominated &quot;Groupers&quot; in the Labor Party for sabotaging his election campaign. He later publicly attacked The Groupers, who had infiltrated the Victorian Labor Party, thus precipitating a split in the party, with most of the &quot;Groupers&quot; leaving or being expelled. The disaffected formed the Democratic Labor Party, which directed its preferences against Labor at subsequent elections. This, together with an obsessive hatred of Menzies, led Evatt into a number of unforced errors. Due to these factors, Labor was roundly defeated in the 1955 election, suffering an 11-seat swing. Evatt himself was nearly defeated in Barton after almost three-quarters of independents&#x27; preferences flowed to his Liberal opponent. For the 1958 election, he transferred to Hunter, one of the few safe country seats for Labor. He offered to resign as leader if the DLP would return to the party. The offer was rejected and Labor was soundly defeated again. 

==Chief Justice of New South Wales (1960–1962)==
In 1960, the Labor government in New South Wales appointed Evatt the Chief Justice of New South Wales, an appointment that was widely seen as a means of giving him a dignified exit from politics.

===Health===
Recent biographies of Evatt agree that his behaviour became more eccentric from the late 1950s. Pat Fiske and David McKnight, in their 1995 television documentary &quot;Doc&quot;, attributed what they described as Evatt&#x27;s &quot;deteriorating mental functioning&quot; to arteriosclerosis.

In 1962, Evatt was suffering from stress and was persuaded to retire from the bench. He died from pneumonia in Canberra on 2 November 1965, aged 71.

==Personal life==

Two years after being admitted to the New South Wales Bar, Evatt, an Anglican, married Mary Alice Sheffer at the Congregational Church in Mosman, New South Wales on 27 November 1920. Even with his sometimes turbulent nature, the relationship was one of devotion. The couple had two children, Peter and Rosalind, whom they adopted due to Mary Alice&#x27;s serious gynaeocological issues.

Peter Evatt became an Olympic rower, who was 1953 national sculling champion and represented Australia in rowing at the 1956 Olympic Games in Melbourne. Peter was a member of the ALP, like his father, and stood for the seat of Bennelong at the 1969 federal elections.

In 1972, aged 50, Peter died by accidental electrocution while trying to repair a faulty electric toaster. He was survived by his six children. His death was reported by &quot;The Age&quot; on 27 December 1972.

In 1953, Rosalind Evatt married Peter Carrodus, the assistant manager of a Canberra radio station, 2CA.

===Relatives===
Evatt&#x27;s youngest brother was Clive R. Evatt, whose three children are noted below:

*Evatt&#x27;s niece, Penelope Seidler, an architect, married Harry Seidler in 1958.
*Evatt&#x27;s niece, Elizabeth Evatt, was a barrister and judge.
*Evatt&#x27;s nephew, Clive A. Evatt, was a defamation barrister.

==Literary works==
During his life, Evatt had a varied career as a writer, covering such topics as law and labour history. His book on the politics of the Rum Rebellion is still considered relevant, although others disagree with Evatt&#x27;s view. Evatt contributed an article on &quot;Cricket and the British Commonwealth&quot; to the 1949 edition of the &quot;Wisden Cricketer&#x27;s Almanack&quot;.

His publications include:
*H. V. Evatt, &quot;Australian Labour Leader: The Story Of W.A. Holman and the Labour Movement&quot;, 1954
*H. V. Evatt, &quot;The King and His Dominion Governors,&quot; 1936
*H. V. Evatt, &quot;Injustice within the Law. A study of the case of the Dorsetshire Labourers&quot;, 1937
*H. V. Evatt, &quot;The Royal Prerogative&quot;, 1930 (this was his LLD thesis)
*H. V. Evatt, &quot;Rum Rebellion: A Study of the Overthrow of Governor Bligh by John Macarthur and the New South Wales Corps&quot;, 1943
*H. V. Evatt, &quot;Liberalism in Australia: An Historical Sketch of Australian Politics down to the year 1915,&quot; 1918

==Honours==
*In 1924 Evatt was awarded the degree LLD, for his dissertation on prerogative powers of Governors in the British legal system.
*The Evatt Foundation, a research institute for the labour movement, is named in his honour.
*The suburb of Evatt, which lies in the Belconnen district of Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, is also named in his honour.
*One of the high schools (Maitland Boys High School) in his home town of Maitland was briefly renamed Evatt High School in his honour, before being renamed Maitland High School when it became unisex some years later.
*In November 1965, the NSW State Government opened Evatt Park in Lugarno, which is still used frequently for recreation.
*United Nations Youth Australia runs an annual national high schools Model United Nations Security Council competition, the Evatt Cup, which has rounds in every state and territory.
*Evatt was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1950 and 1953, but was not selected in both instances.

<text>Hang Seng Bank Limited () is a Hong Kong–based banking and financial services company with headquarters in Central, Hong Kong. It is one of Hong Kong&#x27;s leading public companies in terms of market capitalisation and is part of the HSBC Group, which holds a majority equity interest in the bank.

Hang Seng Bank is a commercial bank whose major business activities include retail banking, wealth management, commercial banking, treasury services, and private banking. Hang Seng Bank operates a network of around 260 service outlets in Hong Kong. It also has a wholly owned subsidiary in mainland China, Hang Seng Bank (China) Limited, which has a network of 46 branches and sub branches.

It established the Hang Seng Index as a public service in 1969 and this stock market index is now generally known as the primary indicator of the Hong Kong stock market.

== History ==

In 1933, business partners Lam Bing Yim (林炳炎), Ho Sin Hang, Sheng Tsun Lin (盛春霖), and Leung Chik Wai (梁植偉) founded Hang Seng Ngan Ho, the predecessor of Hang Seng Bank, in Hong Kong. Hang Seng means &quot;ever-growing&quot; in Cantonese. It commenced business as a simple money-changing shop at 70 Wing Lok Street, Sheung Wan, on 3 March 1933. In 1952, Hang Seng Bank became a private company and embarked on commercial banking. Hang Seng Bank converted into a public company in 1960. In 1965, Hang Seng Bank suffered a bank run which depleted almost one-quarter of its reserves. As a result, The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) acquired a controlling 51% interest in Hang Seng Bank, which it later increased to 62.14%.

In 1969, the Hang Seng Index was introduced as a public service. The index is now generally known as an indicator of the Hong Kong stock market. Hang Seng Bank was listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 1972. In 1981, Hang Seng Bank was given permission to run branches in MTR stations. Hang Seng Bank began to extend its business to China in 1985, with the opening of a representative office in Shenzhen. Ten years later, Hang Seng Bank opened its first Chinese branch in Guangzhou.

In 2002, Hang Seng Bank launched personal e-banking in Mainland China. Hang Seng Bank opened its branch in Macau in 2003. In 2006, Hang Seng Bank received authorisation to get ready for the formation of its mainland China subsidiary bank. Within the same year, Hang Seng Bank introduced a brand revitalisation program and presented a new company slogan – Managing wealth for you, with you.

2007 was significant to Hang Seng Bank: the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) authorised the formation of Hang Seng Bank (China) Limited, the mainland China subsidiary bank of Hang Seng Bank which was established on 28 May 2007. In November, Hang Seng Bank opened its new Hong Kong office at MegaBox, Kowloon Bay. Hang Seng Bank became the first bank in Hong Kong to fix the renminbi (RMB) prime rate in 2010.

In February 2012, Hang Seng Bank introduced the world&#x27;s first RMB gold exchange-traded fund (ETF). The brand value of Hang Seng Bank was ranked 65th globally in the 2012 Brand Finance Banking 500, the highest ranking for Hong Kong banks.

<doc id="322623" wikidata="Q191853" url="?curid=322623" title="Zermelo set theory">
<text>Zermelo set theory (sometimes denoted by Z-), as set out in a seminal paper in 1908 by Ernst Zermelo, is the ancestor of modern Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (ZF) and its extensions, such as von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory (NBG). It bears certain differences from its descendants, which are not always understood, and are frequently misquoted. This article sets out the original axioms, with the original text (translated into English) and original numbering.

== The axioms of Zermelo set theory ==

The axioms of Zermelo set theory are stated for objects, some of which (but not necessarily all) are sets, and the remaining objects are urelements and not sets. Zermelo&#x27;s language implicitly includes a membership relation ∈, an equality relation = (if it is not included in the underlying logic), and a unary predicate saying whether an object is a set. Later versions of set theory often assume that all objects are sets so there are no urelements and there is no need for the unary predicate.

# AXIOM I. Axiom of extensionality (&quot;Axiom der Bestimmtheit&quot;) &quot;If every element of a set &quot;M&quot; is also an element of &quot;N&quot; and vice versa ... then &quot;M&quot; formula_1 &quot;N&quot;. Briefly, every set is determined by its elements.&quot;
# AXIOM II. Axiom of elementary sets (&quot;Axiom der Elementarmengen&quot;) &quot;There exists a set, the null set, ∅, that contains no element at all. If &quot;a&quot; is any object of the domain, there exists a set {&quot;a&quot;} containing &quot;a&quot; and only &quot;a&quot; as an element. If &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are any two objects of the domain, there always exists a set {&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;} containing as elements &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; but no object &quot;x&quot; distinct from them both.&quot; See Axiom of pairs.
# AXIOM III. Axiom of separation (&quot;Axiom der Aussonderung&quot;) &quot;Whenever the propositional function –(&quot;x&quot;) is defined for all elements of a set &quot;M&quot;, &quot;M&quot; possesses a subset &quot;M&#x27; &quot; containing as elements precisely those elements &quot;x&quot; of &quot;M&quot; for which –(&quot;x&quot;) is true.&quot;
# AXIOM IV. Axiom of the power set (&quot;Axiom der Potenzmenge&quot;) &quot;To every set &quot;T&quot; there corresponds a set &quot;T&#x27; &quot;, the power set of &quot;T&quot;, that contains as elements precisely all subsets of &quot;T&quot; .&quot;
# AXIOM V. Axiom of the union (&quot;Axiom der Vereinigung&quot;) &quot;To every set &quot;T&quot; there corresponds a set &quot;∪T&quot;, the union of &quot;T&quot;, that contains as elements precisely all elements of the elements of &quot;T&quot; .&quot;
# AXIOM VI. Axiom of choice (&quot;Axiom der Auswahl&quot;) &quot;If &quot;T&quot; is a set whose elements all are sets that are different from ∅ and mutually disjoint, its union &quot;∪T&quot; includes at least one subset &quot;S&quot;1 having one and only one element in common with each element of &quot;T&quot; .&quot;
# AXIOM VII. Axiom of infinity (&quot;Axiom des Unendlichen&quot;) &quot;There exists in the domain at least one set &quot;Z&quot; that contains the null set as an element and is so constituted that to each of its elements &quot;a&quot; there corresponds a further element of the form {&quot;a&quot;}, in other words, that with each of its elements &quot;a&quot; it also contains the corresponding set {&quot;a&quot;} as element.&quot;

== Connection with standard set theory ==
The most widely used and accepted set theory is known as ZFC, which consists of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory including the axiom of choice (AC). The links show where the axioms of Zermelo&#x27;s theory correspond. There is no exact match for &quot;elementary sets&quot;. (It was later shown that the singleton set could be derived from what is now called the &quot;Axiom of pairs&quot;. If &quot;a&quot; exists, &quot;a&quot; and &quot;a&quot; exist, thus {&quot;a&quot;,&quot;a&quot;} exists, and so by extensionality {&quot;a&quot;,&quot;a&quot;} = {&quot;a&quot;}.) The empty set axiom is already assumed by axiom of infinity, and is now included as part of it.

Zermelo set theory does not include the axioms of replacement and regularity. The axiom of replacement was first published in 1922 by Abraham Fraenkel and Thoralf Skolem, who had independently discovered that Zermelo&#x27;s axioms cannot prove the existence of the set {&quot;Z&quot;0, &quot;Z&quot;1, &quot;Z&quot;2, ...} where &quot;Z&quot;0 is the set of natural numbers and &quot;Z&quot;&quot;n&quot;+1 is the power set of &quot;Z&quot;&quot;n&quot;. They both realized that the axiom of replacement is needed to prove this. The following year, John von Neumann pointed out that the axiom of regularity is necessary to build his theory of ordinals. The axiom of regularity was stated by von Neumann in 1925.

In the modern ZFC system, the &quot;propositional function&quot; referred to in the axiom of separation is interpreted as &quot;any property definable by a first-order formula with parameters&quot;, so the separation axiom is replaced by an axiom schema. The notion of &quot;first order formula&quot; was not known in 1908 when Zermelo published his axiom system, and he later rejected this interpretation as being too restrictive. Zermelo set theory is usually taken to be a first-order theory with the separation axiom replaced by an axiom scheme with an axiom for each first-order formula. It can also be considered as a theory in second-order logic, where now the separation axiom is just a single axiom. The second-order interpretation of Zermelo set theory is probably closer to Zermelo&#x27;s own conception of it, and is stronger than the first-order interpretation.

Since formula_2—where formula_3 is the rank-formula_4 set in the cumulative hierarchy—forms a model of second-order Zermelo set theory within ZFC whenever formula_5 is a limit ordinal greater than the smallest infinite ordinal formula_6, it follows that the consistency of second-order Zermelo set theory (and therefore also that of first-order Zermelo set theory) is a theorem of ZFC. If we let formula_7, the existence of an uncountable strong limit cardinal is not satisfied in such a model; thus the existence of &quot;&amp;beth;ω&quot; (the smallest uncountable strong limit cardinal) cannot be proved in second-order Zermelo set theory. Similarly, the set formula_8 (where &quot;L&quot; is the constructible universe) forms a model of first-order Zermelo set theory wherein the existence of an uncountable weak limit cardinal is not satisfied, showing that first-order Zermelo set theory cannot even prove the existence of the smallest singular cardinal, formula_9. Within such a model, the only infinite cardinals are the aleph numbers restricted to finite index ordinals.

The axiom of infinity is usually now modified to assert the existence of the first infinite von Neumann ordinal formula_6; the original Zermelo axioms cannot prove the existence of this set, nor can the modified Zermelo axioms prove Zermelo&#x27;s axiom of infinity. Zermelo&#x27;s axioms (original or modified) cannot prove the existence of formula_11 as a set nor of any rank of the cumulative hierarchy of sets with infinite index. In any formulation, Zermelo set theory cannot prove the existence of the von Neumann ordinal formula_12, despite proving the existence of such an order type; thus the von Neumann definition of ordinals is not employed for Zermelo set theory.

Zermelo allowed for the existence of urelements that are not sets and contain no elements; these are now usually omitted from set theories.

== Mac Lane set theory ==
Mac Lane set theory, introduced by , is Zermelo set theory with the axiom of separation restricted to first-order formulas in which every quantifier is bounded.
Mac Lane set theory is similar in strength to topos theory with a natural number object, or to the system in Principia mathematica. It is strong enough to carry out almost all ordinary mathematics not directly connected with set theory or logic.

== The aim of Zermelo&#x27;s paper ==
The introduction states that the very existence of the discipline of set theory &quot;seems to be threatened by certain contradictions or &quot;antinomies&quot;, that can be derived from its principles – principles necessarily governing our thinking, it seems – and to which no entirely satisfactory solution has yet been found&quot;. Zermelo is of course referring to the &quot;Russell antinomy&quot;.

He says he wants to show how the original theory of Georg Cantor and Richard Dedekind can be reduced to a few definitions and seven principles or axioms. He says he has &quot;not&quot; been able to prove that the axioms are consistent.

A non-constructivist argument for their consistency goes as follows. Define &quot;V&quot;α for α one of the ordinals 0, 1, 2, ...,ω, ω+1, ω+2..., ω·2 as follows:
* V0 is the empty set.
* For α a successor of the form β+1, &quot;V&quot;α is defined to be the collection of all subsets of &quot;V&quot;β.
* For α a limit (e.g. ω, ω·2) then &quot;V&quot;α is defined to be the union of &quot;V&quot;β for β&lt;α.
Then the axioms of Zermelo set theory are consistent because they are true in the model &quot;V&quot;ω·2. While a non-constructivist might regard this as a valid argument, a constructivist would probably not: while there are no problems with the construction of the sets up to &quot;V&quot;ω, the construction of &quot;V&quot;ω+1 is less clear because one cannot constructively define every subset of &quot;V&quot;ω. This argument can be turned into a valid proof with the addition of a single new axiom of infinity to Zermelo set theory, simply that &quot;V&quot;ω·2 &quot;exists&quot;. This is presumably not convincing for a constructivist, but it shows that the consistency of Zermelo set theory can be proved with a theory which is not very different from Zermelo theory itself, only a little more powerful.

== The axiom of separation ==
Zermelo comments that Axiom III of his system is the one responsible for eliminating the antinomies. It differs from the original definition by Cantor, as follows.

Sets cannot be independently defined by any arbitrary logically definable notion. They must be constructed in some way from previously constructed sets. For example, they can be constructed by taking powersets, or they can be &quot;separated&quot; as subsets of sets already &quot;given&quot;. This, he says, eliminates contradictory ideas like &quot;the set of all sets&quot; or &quot;the set of all ordinal numbers&quot;.

He disposes of the Russell paradox by means of this Theorem: &quot;Every set formula_13 possesses at least one subset formula_14 that is not an element of formula_13 &quot;. Let formula_14 be the subset of formula_13 which, by AXIOM III, is separated out by the notion &quot;formula_18&quot;. Then formula_14 cannot be in formula_13. For

# If formula_14 is in formula_14, then formula_14 contains an element &quot;x&quot; for which &quot;x&quot; is in &quot;x&quot; (i.e. formula_14 itself), which would contradict the definition of formula_14.
# If formula_14 is not in formula_14, and assuming formula_14 is an element of &quot;M&quot;, then formula_14 is an element of &quot;M&quot; that satisfies the definition &quot;formula_18&quot;, and so is in formula_14 which is a contradiction.

Therefore, the assumption that formula_14 is in formula_13 is wrong, proving the theorem. Hence not all objects of the universal domain &quot;B&quot; can be elements of one and the same set. &quot;This disposes of the Russell antinomy as far as we are concerned&quot;.

This left the problem of &quot;the domain &quot;B&quot;&quot; which seems to refer to something. This led to the idea of a proper class.

== Cantor&#x27;s theorem ==
Zermelo&#x27;s paper may be the first to mention the name &quot;Cantor&#x27;s theorem&quot;.
Cantor&#x27;s theorem: &quot;If &quot;M&quot; is an arbitrary set, then always &quot;M&quot; &lt; P(&quot;M&quot;) [the power set of &quot;M&quot;]. Every set is of lower cardinality than the set of its subsets&quot;.

Zermelo proves this by considering a function φ: &quot;M&quot; → P(&quot;M&quot;). By Axiom III this defines the following set &quot;M&#x27; &quot;:

:&quot;M&#x27; &quot; = {&quot;m&quot;: &quot;m&quot; ∉ φ(&quot;m&quot;)}.

But no element &quot;m&#x27; &quot; of &quot;M &quot; could correspond to &quot;M&#x27; &quot;, i.e. such that φ(&quot;m&#x27; &quot;) = &quot;M&#x27; &quot;. Otherwise we can construct a contradiction:

# If &quot;m&#x27; &quot; is in &quot;M&#x27; &quot; then by definition &quot;m&#x27; &quot; ∉ φ(&quot;m&#x27; &quot;) = &quot;M&#x27; &quot;, which is the first part of the contradiction
# If &quot;m&#x27; &quot; is not in &quot;M&#x27; &quot; but in &quot;M &quot; then by definition &quot;m&#x27; &quot; ∉ &quot;M&#x27; &quot; = φ(&quot;m&#x27; &quot;) which by definition implies that &quot;m&#x27; &quot; is in &quot;M&#x27; &quot;, which is the second part of the contradiction.

so by contradiction &quot;m&#x27; &quot; does not exist. Note the close resemblance of this proof to the way Zermelo disposes of Russell&#x27;s paradox.

<text>A Fairlie locomotive is a type of articulated steam locomotive that has the driving wheels on bogies. It was invented by Robert Francis Fairlie. The locomotive may be double-ended (a double Fairlie) or single ended (a single Fairlie). Most double-ended Fairlies had wheel arrangements of or . All were tank locomotives.

While Fairlie locomotives are now used only on heritage railways, the majority of diesel and electric locomotives in the world follow the basic form of the Fairlie — two power trucks with all axles driven. Many also follow the Fairlie&#x27;s double-ended concept, capable of being driven equally well in both directions.

== Development of the design ==
In 1864, the Scottish engineer Robert Francis Fairlie published a pamphlet detailing his plans for a new type of articulated locomotive. He had become convinced that the conventional pattern of locomotive could be improved on, and that his proposed design would have higher tractive effort as all the locomotive&#x27;s weight was on the driving wheels, was able to traverse sharper curves than a non-articulated locomotive of the same length, would be better at producing steam from its double boilers and would not need turntables because it could be driven in either direction. He received a patent for this design in May 1864.

Fairlie&#x27;s design was a double-ended steam locomotive that carried all its fuel and water on the locomotive and had every axle driven. It had a double-ended boiler, with one firebox in the centre and a smokebox at each end.

=== Predecessors ===
Fairlie was not the first engineer to design and build a double-engine. In 1850, the Belgian company John Cockerill &amp; Co built a double-boiler locomotive called &quot;Seraing&quot; which featured two independently articulated driving bogies. It had several differences from Fairlie&#x27;s design, notably the buffers were fixed to the carrying frame, not the bogies, and the bogies were attached to the frame using four carrying pins, which restricted the degree of articulation. &quot;Seraing&quot; was a failure and Robert Fairlie was likely unaware of it when he produced his design in the 1860s. In the early 1860s, Archibald Sturrock, the locomotive superintendent of the Great Northern Railway, experimented with powered bogies under the tenders of GNR steam locomotives. While these were not ultimately successful, Fairlie was influenced by Sturrock&#x27;s work, and by the use of back-to-back locomotives on the Bhor Ghat incline on the Great Indian Peninsula Railway starting in 1856.

=== Firebox ===

The first locomotive was &quot;The Progress&quot;, built in 1865 by James Cross and Company for the Neath and Brecon Railway. However, having the draught from both halves of the boiler through one firebox was unsuccessful. There was a tendency for most of the hot gases from the fire to go through one half of the boiler, so the other half made little contribution to steam-raising and was inefficient. The first, Festiniog Railway Little Wonder, had separate fireboxes with a water jacket between them and proved far more successful.

=== Controls ===
The locomotive driver (US: engineer) worked on one side of the locomotive, and the fireman on the other; the fireboxes separated them. The regulators for both power bogies were located above the centre of the fireboxes, with the steam brake valve at one end.

=== Power bogies ===
Underneath, the locomotive was supported on two swivelling powered bogies (US: trucks), with all wheels driven; smaller locomotives had four-wheel bogies, while larger had six-wheel. The cylinders on each power bogie pointed outward, towards the locomotive ends. Couplers and buffers (where fitted) were mounted on the bogies, not on the locomotive frame, so that they swivelled with the curvature of the track.

=== Steam supply ===
Steam was delivered to the cylinders via flexible tubing. Initially, this was a coiled copper tube but this would fracture after a period of use. Later locomotives had rigid connecting tubes with the necessary flexibility provided by metal ball-and-socket joints similar to those used in laboratory glassware.

=== Fuel and water ===
Fuel and water were carried on the locomotive, in side tanks beside each boiler for the water, and bunkers for the fuel above them.

== Examples in use ==
Armed with the success of &quot;Little Wonder&quot; on the Ffestiniog, Fairlie staged a series of very successful demonstrations on the Ffestiniog line in February 1870 to high-powered delegations from the many parts of the world. This sold his invention (and the concept of the narrow-gauge railway on which it was based) around the world.

Locomotives were built for many British colonies, for the Russian Empire, and even one example for the United States.

In 1879, the first government railway line in Western Australia from Geraldton to Northampton utilised two double Fairlies as its third and fourth items of motive power, respectively, but without much success. The only really successful uses of the Fairlie locomotive, other than on the Ffestiniog Railway, were in Mexico, New Zealand, and Russia (on the Transcaucasian Railway).

===Wales===

In 1869, Robert Fairlie&#x27;s company built a locomotive named &quot;Little Wonder&quot; for the Ffestiniog Railway, a narrow-gauge slate railway in North Wales. The Ffestiniog was the first gauge railway to use locomotives. The Fairlie design meant that the fireboxes and ashpans were not restricted by frame or track width, but only by the overall loading gauge. &quot;Little Wonder&quot; was such a success that Fairlie gave the Festiniog Railway Company a perpetual licence to use his locomotive patent without restriction, in return for using the line and the success of its Fairlie locomotives in his publicity. During its original operation, the Ffestiniog owned a total of five Fairlie locomotives (four Double and one Single), one of which is on display in the UK National Collection. Since the reopening of the railway in presentation, their Boston Lodge workshops have built three new Double Fairlies, the most recent being &quot;James Spooner II&quot; which entered service in 2023 to replace &quot;Earl of Merioneth&quot;.

===United States===

The locomotive sold in the US was ordered for the newly built Denver and Rio Grande Railroad in 1872, and was named &quot;Mountaineer&quot;. It was the only Double Fairlie to operate on an American narrow-gauge railway. This was a smaller locomotive with four-wheel bogies, giving it a configuration. The railroad&#x27;s experience with the locomotive was typical, and an indication of the fact that, though Fairlie had eliminated several problems of the conventional locomotive, he had introduced new ones of his own. At least one double Fairlie &quot;Janus&quot; (pictured) was built by the Mason Machine Works in Taunton, Massachusetts and worked on the Lehigh Valley Railroad.

=== Canada ===
Five narrow-gauge Fairlie Patent locomotives were built by the Avonside Engine Company, Bristol in the early 1870s for use by Canadian railways.

The Toronto and Nipissing Railway used a single gauge Fairlie from 1871 until the line was converted to in 1883.

The Toronto, Grey and Bruce Railway of Ontario also used one gauge Fairlie locomotive, delivered in 1872.

In Cape Breton Island, three gauge Fairlie Patent locomotives built by Bristol&#x27;s Avonside Company were used to haul coal between Sydney and Reserve Mines from 1872 until 1902. Herb MacDonald&#x27;s book &quot;Cape Breton Railways: An Illustrated History&quot; (Cape Breton University Press, 2012) states that &quot;a railway industry journal published early in 1903 stated that &#x27;the old double-end locomotives... have recently been taken apart at the Reserve, and will be disposed of as old junk. The machinists who took them apart say it was the hardest job they ever tackled, as the engines were very strongly built and the parts mostly forge-made&#x27;.&quot;

=== Mexico ===

In Mexico, the Ferrocarril Mexicano (FCM) used Fairlies on a mountainous stretch of line between Mexico City and Veracruz, where 49 enormous Fairlies weighing about apiece were imported from England. The largest and most powerful locomotives built there up to then, they were used until the line was electrified in the 1920s. The tractive effort figures (see table below) are notably high compared to relatively modern locomotives (such as the BR Standard Class 9F).

Rolt wrote:

&quot;...it was the Mexican Railway that became Fairlie&#x27;s most devoted adherent. Three twelve-wheeled Avonside Fairlies were built for this Company in 1871 to work traffic on the steeply graded section of the main line between Cordoba and the . Boca del Monte, Mexico summit in the Orizaba mountains, a distance of . So successful were they that they were the forerunners of no less than fifty Fairlies supplied to Mexico by Avonside and other British builders over a period of forty years.&quot;
Durrant took a more sceptical view:
&quot;The largest Fairlies built were... examples for the Mexicano Railway...Despite their impressive proportions, these engines were devoid of superheaters or modern valve arrangements and were soon replaced by electrification.&quot;
This table shows brief details of the locomotives. Detailed specifications can be found at steamlocomotive.com 

Key:
* Date = building date of first locomotive in batch. Delivery may have been spread over several years
* n/k = not known
* T.E. = tractive effort

Durrant shows a photograph (credited to English Electric) of FCM number 184, built by Vulcan Foundry (VF) in 1911. This is of typically British appearance apart from the sanding dome which, curiously, is provided at one end only. This photograph of FCM number 183
shows a locomotive of distinctly American appearance. If it is one of the VF engines, it has certainly been heavily re-built.

The VF engines were almost certainly built as oil-fired. The photograph in Durrant&#x27;s book looks like a works photograph showing the engine in new condition and there are rectangular tanks on top of the boilers, which was the usual arrangement on oil-fired Fairlies. Heat from the boilers kept the oil warm and prevented it from becoming too viscous in cold weather.

=== Ireland ===

* The Great Southern and Western Railway had two single Fairlies.

=== New Zealand ===
In New Zealand, the R class and S class single Fairlies and the B class and E class double Fairlies were ordered in the 1870s for use on the narrow-gauge () system built under Julius Vogel&#x27;s 1870 &quot;Great Public Works&quot; programme to open up the country. Three of the S class Fairlies were sold to Western Australian Government Railways in 1891.

===Russia===

In Russia, Fairlies were used on a gauge Imperial Linvy Railway between Tambov and Saratov (1871–1887) and on Surami Pass of the Transcaucasian Railway (from 1872). These locomotives, like the ones used in Mexico were an configuration. The first of them were built in England (Avonside Engine Company, Yorkshire Engine Company and Sharp, Stewart and Company), the second tranche were made by German factories (1879), the last – 17 for the Russian State Railways by the Kolomensky Works, Kolomna (1884) under licence. The largest locomotives weighed 90 tons and were oil-fired. In 1912 all Fairlies in Russia were included in &quot;series F&quot; and used until 1934, when the line through Surami pass was electrified.

=== India and Burma===
In 1879, the Avonside Engine Company built 25 Double Fairlies intended for service in the Third Anglo-Afghan War. The order was cancelled in 1880, but 17 locomotives had already been built and they were purchased by India, though one was lost at sea during transit to India. The remaining locomotives worked on the Bolān Pass Railway but were not successful and were put into storage in 1887. Ten went to Burma in 1896 and four others were sent to the Nilgiri Mountain Railway in 1907. The Nilgiri locomotives worked there until at least 1914.

==Problems with the design==

===Fuel and water===
Capacity for fuel and water is limited by the layout of the locomotive. Fairlie&#x27;s design has less room for fuel supplies than a normal tank locomotive, that can be fitted with a bunker at the back of the cab. Solid fuel can&#x27;t be carried in a tender because there is no access from the central cab. As was later the case with Bulleid&#x27;s Leader class locomotives, limited fuel supplies would not have been a problem if fuel oil had been used instead of coal. Some of the large Fairlies for Mexico (see above) were oil-fired and oil-firing has, in recent times, been used on the Ffestiniog Railway.

===Steam pipes===
The flexible steam pipes to and from the cylinders of each swivelling engine were prone to leakage which wasted power. These problems were partially solved. It is recorded by Rolt that difficulties encountered in 1909 with the design and construction of steam-tight flexible steam connections for the Garratt locomotive were solved by Beyer, Peacock &amp; Company&#x27;s designers after studying the spherical steam joints on a Fairlie locomotive built for the Ffestiniog Railway.

===Power bogies===
Unpowered wheels on a steam locomotive reduce its tendency to wander or &#x27;hunt&#x27; when rolling on straight track, and lead the locomotive into curves, thereby reducing derailments. Early Fairlies had a tendency to be rough on the track, and more prone to derailment than they should have been. The Festiniog Railway&#x27;s first Fairlie &quot;Little Wonder&quot; was worn out after less than twenty years&#x27; use. To a large extent the problem was not the use of power bogies but faults in their design and especially the absence of weights on the trailing ends of the bogies to counterbalance the cylinders. Subsequent FR engines were much easier on the track. All FR Fairlies have had a reputation for a smooth footplate ride when compared with the original George England and Co. built 0-4-0 engines.

===Visibility===
The driver is on one side of the firebox and the fireman on the other. As a result, the locomotive is left-hand drive going in one direction and right-hand drive in the other. This potentially reduces the visibility of signals.

== Single Fairlie locomotive ==


A variation of the Fairlie that enjoyed some popularity, especially in the United States, was the single Fairlie, essentially half a double Fairlie, with one boiler, a cab at one end, and a single articulated power bogie combined with an unpowered bogie under the cab, maintaining the ability to negotiate sharp turns. This design abandoned the bidirectional nature of the double Fairlie but gained back the ability to have a large bunker and water tank behind the cab, and the possibility of using a trailing tender if necessary. The single conventional boiler made maintenance cheaper and did away with the crew&#x27;s separation.

The first Single Fairlie locomotive was an designed and constructed by Alexander McDonnell for the Great Southern &amp; Western Railway in 1869.

The design was especially popular with William Mason, Fairlie&#x27;s licensee in the United States, who built 146 or so Mason Bogie locomotives, which were a variant on this design. In the UK, a single Fairlie was used by the Swindon, Marlborough and Andover Railway and three s by the North Wales Narrow Gauge Railways. As well as their iconic double Fairlies, the Ffestiniog railway also has a single Fairlie loco, the power bogie of which is essentially the same as those used by their double Fairlies.

In both the UK and the USA, single Fairlies were the first locomotives in each country to use the European Walschaerts valve gear. The Stephenson link gear, which was usual at the time, used multiple eccentrics between the frames but the Walschaerts gear was mounted &quot;outboard&quot; of the frames and connecting rods. This was advantageous because the Fairlie system required this space between the frames for the bogie pivot.

== Péchot-Bourdon locomotive ==
The Péchot-Bourdon locomotive was the final development of the Fairlie type. The Péchot-Bourdon was developed by Captain Péchot of the French artillery to operate on gauge railways associated with field artillery and fortresses. The design was chosen with the belief that if one boiler or set of valve gear was damaged by enemy fire, the loco could continue to operate. The primary difference between a Fairlie and the Péchot-Bourdon is that the latter only had one steam dome. Only one design was constructed, an . About fifty examples were constructed in 1906, and a further 280 were constructed during World War I, some by the American Baldwin Locomotive Works.

;Preservation
Two examples are preserved, one in Frankfurter Feldbahnmuseum on loan from Dresden Transport Museum, Germany, and one in Serbia at Pozega Railway Museum.

;Models
A 1:32 scale model of the Péchot-Bourdon locomotive is produced by Scalelink.
== Modified Fairlie locomotive ==

The Modified Fairlie was introduced by the North British Locomotive Company to the South African Railways in 1924. It was similar in appearance to a Garratt locomotive but the boiler, fuel and water tanks were all mounted on a single frame which was pivoted on the power bogies. This arrangement differs from the Garratt in which the fuel and water tanks are mounted directly on the power bogies.

== Fairlies today ==

===Operational===
The Ffestiniog Railway in Wales still uses Fairlie locomotives. It has three double Fairlies in running condition. The most recent of these, &quot;James Spooner&quot;, was built in 2023 in the Ffestiniog&#x27;s Boston Lodge works on the 153rd anniversary of &quot;Little Wonder&quot;&#x27;s trials of 1870. &quot;Merddin Emrys&quot; of 1879 was the first engine to be built at Boston Lodge. The Ffestiniog also owned and operated &quot;Taliesin&quot;, a single Fairlie, from 1876 to 1927. It was scrapped in 1935 but a replica was built at Boston Lodge in 1999.

The Fairlies on the Ffestiniog Railway were designed to burn coal. Following trials in 1971, in common with most other Ffestiniog engines, they were modified to burn oil. In 2005, &quot;Earl of Merioneth&quot; was converted to coal having been built as an oil burner. The success of this conversion resulted in &quot;Merddin Emrys&quot;, the oldest of the FR Fairlies, being converted back to coal burning in 2007.

The oldest Fairlie still in operation is a Mason Bogie preserved at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan. The locomotive was built in 1873 and still hauls passengers on a tourist train during the summer season.

===Non-operational===

Double Fairlie locomotive The Earl of Merioneth is now preserved, at Boston Lodge works where it was built in 1979. It was withdrawn from service on the 8 April 2018. Double Fairlie &quot;Josephine&quot; (Dunedin &amp; Port Chalmers Railway #2, NZR E 175, PWD #504) is preserved at Dunedin, New Zealand&#x27;s, Otago Settlers&#x27; Museum, and R 28 a single Fairlie, at Reefton. R 28 is the only original British Single Fairlie to have survived, the Festinog&#x27;s &quot;Taliesin&quot; is a replica built in 1999. The remains of another, R class number 271, was dumped at Oamaru to protect the railway yards against coastal erosion in 1930, and has since passed into the ownership of the Oamaru Steam &amp; Rail Restoration Society. Two more R class boilers, and two power bogies from one each B and E class double Fairlies are held by the Canterbury Railway Society at its Ferrymead Railway in Christchurch.

A double Fairlie tramway type engine is also preserved in Eastern Germany, and one of the original Festiniog locomotives, &quot;Livingston Thompson&quot; of 1885, is in the National Railway Museum in York.

== In fiction ==
In the children&#x27;s television series &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends&quot;, based on the Rev. W. Awdry&#x27;s &quot;The Railway Series&quot;, Mighty Mac is a double Fairlie on the narrow-gauge Skarloey Railway.

<text>Corytophanidae is a family of iguanian lizards, also called casquehead lizards or helmeted lizards, endemic to the New World. Nine species of casquehead lizards from three genera are recognized.

==Geographic range==
Corytophanids are found from Mexico, through Central America, and as far south as Ecuador.

Certain species are now extant in South Florida and are considered invasive.

==Description==
The casquehead lizards are moderately sized lizards, with laterally compressed bodies, and typically have well-developed head crests in the shape of a casque helmet. This crest is a sexually dimorphic characteristic in males of &quot;Basiliscus&quot;, but is present in both sexes of &quot;Corytophanes&quot; and &quot;Laemanctus&quot;.
In past years there has been evidence of corytophanids in the Eocene of North America. The greatest percentage of omnivorous species (&gt; 10% plant diet), over 30% in each, and the highest mean percentage of plant matter in the diet are corytophanids.

==Behavior==
In &quot;Corytophanes&quot;, the head crests are used in defensive displays, where the lateral aspect of the body is brought about to face a potential predator in an effort to look bigger. Unlike many of their close relatives, they are unable to break off their tails when captured, probably because the tail is essential as a counterbalance during rapid movement.

==Habitat==
Casquehead lizards are forest-dwelling. All corytophanids are excellent climbers, and they are usually found in trees or low bushes.

==Reproduction==
Despite the small number of species in the family Corytophanidae, it includes both egg-laying species and species that give birth to live young.

==Genera and species==
Family Corytophanidae
&quot;Nota bene&quot;: In the following lists, a binomial authority in parentheses indicates that the species was originally described in a different genus.

<doc id="322628" wikidata="Q256400" url="?curid=322628" title="Basiliscus (lizard)">
<text>Basiliscus is a genus of large corytophanid lizards, commonly known as basilisks, which are endemic to southern Mexico, Central America, and northern South America. The genus contains four species, which are commonly known as the Jesus Christ lizard, or simply the Jesus lizard, due to their ability to run across water for significant distances before sinking due to the large surface area of their feet.

==Taxonomy and etymology==
Both the generic name, &quot;Basiliscus&quot;, and the common name, &quot;basilisk&quot;, derive from the Greek &quot;basilískos&quot; (βασιλίσκος) meaning &quot;little king&quot;. The specific epithet, &quot;vittatus&quot;, which is Latin for &quot;striped&quot;, was given in Carl Linnæus&#x27; 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturæ&quot;.

==Description==
Basilisks on average measure in total length (including tail). Their growth is perpetual, fast when they are young and nonlinear for mature basilisks. Their skin is shed in pieces.

Basilisks are oviparous and lay 8–18 eggs.

==Running on water==
Basilisks sometimes run bipedally. Basilisks have the ability to &quot;run&quot; on water, and because of this, they have been dubbed the &quot;Jesus Christ lizard&quot; in reference to the biblical passage of Jesus walking on water. On water, basilisks can run at a velocity of per second for approximately before sinking on all fours and swimming. Flaps between their toes help support basilisks, creating a larger surface and pockets of air, giving them the ability to run across water.

A similar behavior, running bipedally across water, is known from the sailfin lizards and a few species of anole lizards.

==Other defense mechanisms==
Basilisks can burrow into sand to hide from predators; a ring of muscles around both nostrils prevents sand from entering the nose.

==Habitat and geographic range==
Basilisks are abundant in the tropical rain forests of Central and South America, from southern Mexico to Ecuador and Venezuela.

==Invasive species==
The species &quot;Basiliscus vittatus&quot; (brown basilisk) has been introduced to Florida. It has adapted to the colder winters by burrowing into leaf litter for warmth. Current reports sight the brown basilisk as far north as Fort Pierce, on the state&#x27;s East Coast, where small groups have crept up the North Fork of the Saint Lucie River. Mainly it has been seen in Boca Raton and other cities in Palm Beach County. as seen in this photo taken in West Palm Beach, Florida.

==Classification==
Genus &quot;Basiliscus&quot; has four extant species:

<text>Real Club Deportivo Mallorca, [[Sociedad Anónima Deportiva|S.A.D.]] (, , &quot;Royal Sporting Club Mallorca&quot;), commonly known as Real Mallorca or RCD Mallorca, is a Spanish professional football club based in Palma on the island of Mallorca in the Balearic Islands. Founded on 5 March 1916, they currently compete in La Liga, holding home games at the Estadi Mallorca Son Moix with a 23,142-seat capacity.

The club had its peak in the late 1990s and early 2000s, reaching a best-ever third place in La Liga in 1999 and 2001 and winning the Copa del Rey in 2003 following final defeats in 1991, 1998 and 2024. Mallorca also won the 1998 Supercopa de España and reached the 1999 UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup final.

Mallorca traditionally play in red shirts with black shorts and socks.

==History==

=== The early years ===

Founded on 5 March 1916, what would later become RCD Mallorca was registered at the Spanish Football Federation under the name of Alfonso XIII Foot-Ball Club.

Weeks after its establishment, the club wasted little time forming the directors of Alfonso XIII FBC, headed by engineer Adolfo Vázquez Humasqué and eight other football fans. 

Their first stadium, the Buenos Aires field, was inaugurated with a competitive fixture against FC Barcelona just 20 days after registering further fast-tracked development. 

Despite the fixture ending in a disappointing 8–0 defeat, it was not long before King Alfonso XIII himself requested the royal adoption of ‘Real’ in the team&#x27;s title, therefore becoming Real Sociedad Alfonso XIII Foot-Ball Club.
In 1917, the Catalan Federation granted Real Sociedad Alfonso XIII admission into the second-tier league championship as an unofficial champion of the Balearic Islands. Booking a place in the final, Los Bermellones went on to record their first title with a resounding 3–1 victory over Futbol Club Palafrugell, in Barcelona.

Until the 1930s, the board of directors managed to organise fixtures against peninsular clubs such as RCD Espanyol and Real Murcia, while also hosting rare exhibitions against foreign sides including: Ajax in 1923, Uruguay&#x27;s national team in 1925, Chilean outfit Colo-Colo in 1927 and one of the Czech Republic&#x27;s oldest teams, Prague Meteor, in 1930, the latter under coach Jack Greenwell, and with Antolín Arnau, Felipe Ferrer, and Pedro Pizá among its players.

In 1931, following the establishment of the Second Spanish Republic which prohibited any form of reference to monarchy, the club was renamed to Club Deportivo Mallorca.

Although major fixtures and competitions across Spain were soon interrupted by the outbreak of the Civil War in 1936, the squad enjoyed a highly successful spell by winning every possible championship they entered into, as football on the island remained resistant to the deferral experienced throughout the country. 

When the war finally ended, matches with teams from the Peninsula were quick to resume and the Second Division was inaugurated, based on five groups of eight teams each.

It was during a period in the Second Division that, on 22 September 1945, the time had come to wave goodbye to Buenos Aires Field and up sticks to Es Fortí, a 16,000-maximum capacity stadium which would be called home for over half a century and undergo several expansions. 

A line-up featuring forward Sebastián Pocoví, defender Saturnino Grech and goalkeeper Antoni Ramallets beat Jerez 3–0 on the opening game of the new campaign the following day, with Carlos Sanz scoring Es Fortí&#x27;s first goal in front of packed-out terraces. 

The title Es Fortí was short-lived however, with the board later changing the name of the stadium to Lluís Sitjar, in honour of the man who had driven the construction of the field.

During the 1949–1950 season, the Balearic club recovered their &quot;Real&quot; title, becoming Real Club Deportivo Mallorca

===1960–1990===

On 17 April 1960 Mallorca beat Levante 2-1 which confirmed promotion to La Liga for the first time in the clubs 44 year history.

In their first season in the Spanish First Division, the 1960/61 season, Mallorca finished 9th out of 16 teams, on 28 points just 2 points Oviedo in the relegation playoffs. They were knocked out of the Copa Del Rey in the round of 16 to Sevilla 4-3 across two legs.

Mallorca were then relegated back down to the Segunda Division after finishing 13th in the 1962/63 season, losing to Espanyol in the playoffs.

After finishing first in the 1964/65 Segunda Division season they were relegated again in the 1965/66 La Liga season after finishing a disappointing 15th, tied on points with Sabadell in 14th and Real Betis in 16th.

Mallorca would spend a few more seasons which saw them finish in the top 5 every season but were not promoted until the 1968/69 season which saw them finish 3rd, just 3 points off of first place Sevilla. 

Despite this, Mallorca once again were relegated immediately, ending the 1969/70 La Liga season in 15th, only above Pontevedra who finished on just 13 points.

Mallorca would then sit in the lower half of the Segunda Division until the 1974/75 season which saw them finish a lowly 17th and ultimately being relegated to the Tercera División for the 1975/76 season, in which they finished 8th in their group. 

Mallorca would then fall further down the Spanish football divisions being relegated to the 4th division for the 1978/79 season. 

These tough times would not last however, as Mallorca would get back-to-back promotions, finishing first in the 1979/80 fourth division season and then again in the 1980/81 Tercera División.

Mallorca continued this streak of form with another promotion back to La Liga after finishing third in the 1982/83 Segunda Division. 

These good times would end as Mallorca would end up relegated again after finishing the 1983/84 La Liga season in 17th on a mere 21 points.

Once again, Mallorca would come back after finishing the 1985/86 Segunda Division in 3rd, gaining promotion to La Liga for the 1986/87 season.

===1990s and 2000s: Peak===

In 1990–91, despite finishing the season 15th, Mallorca reached the Copa del Rey final for the first time, losing by one goal to Atlético Madrid.

Argentine Héctor Cúper was hired as manager in 1997. In his first season, the club reached the 1998 Copa del Rey Final, and lost on penalties to FC Barcelona after a 1–1 draw in Mestalla. 

However, as Barcelona also won the league, Mallorca were their opponents in the 1998 Supercopa de España and won 3–1 on aggregate for their first major honour. 

Barcelona&#x27;s double also meant Mallorca entered the 1998–99 UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, the final staging of the tournament – they lost the final with a 2–1 score to Lazio at Villa Park.

In 1999, Mallorca also finished a best-ever 3rd and qualified for the first time to the UEFA Champions League, but were eliminated on the away goals rule by Molde FK of Norway before the group stage. Luis Aragonés matched 3rd place in 2001, before leaving for an Atlético Madrid still in the second tier.

Mallorca&#x27;s 2001–02 season was turbulent, with the club going through three different coaches and finishing 16th in the table. 

For the 2002–03 season, Gregorio Manzano was appointed as the club&#x27;s manager. Mallorca finished ninth in the table with inconsistent form. That season Mallorca won their first Copa del Rey title; in their route to the final, they beat Real Madrid in the quarterfinals 4-0, and then eliminated defending champions Deportivo La Coruña. 

In the final on 28 June 2003, Mallorca beat Recreativo de Huelva 3–0 in Elche with goals scored by Walter Pandiani and Samuel Eto&#x27;o. The Copa Del Rey title gave the club a berth in the UEFA Cup; they progressed through three rounds before being eliminated by Newcastle 7-1 on aggregate. 

In the next few seasons the club comfortably finished mid-table; in the 2009–10 season the club had a great campaign and finished 5th while making the Copa del Rey quarter-finals. However, their Europa League spot was ceded to Villarreal due to Mallorca&#x27;s economic difficulties.

=== 2010s: Decline and return ===

Mallorca was relegated from La Liga on the last day of the 2012–13 season. 

In January 2016, with the team at risk of relegation to the third tier, American investor Robert Sarver and former NBA player Steve Nash bought the club for just over €20 million.

On 4 June 2017, Mallorca fell into the third tier for the first time since 1981, with one game of the season still to play. A year later, they bounced back in the 2017–18 season after winning the play-off final against CF Rayo Majadahonda, under new manager Vicente Moreno. 

In June 2019, Mallorca secured a second consecutive promotion to the 2019–20 La Liga, following a 3–2 win on aggregate over Deportivo de La Coruña in the 2019 Segunda División play-offs – having lost the first game 2–0. However, they were relegated a year later. 

A year later, Mallorca bounced back to the top tier following an Almería defeat to Cartagena. 

In 2024, Mallorca reached the Copa del Rey final for the first time since last winning the competition in 2003.

<text>The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) is a federal public health agency within the United States Department of Health and Human Services&#x27; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The agency focuses on minimizing human health risks associated with exposure to hazardous substances. It works closely with other federal, state, and local agencies; tribal governments; local communities; and healthcare providers. Its mission is to &quot;Serve the public through responsive public health actions to promote healthy and safe environments and prevent harmful exposures.&quot; ATSDR was created as an advisory, nonregulatory agency by the Superfund legislation and was formally organized in 1985.

Although ATSDR is an independent operating agency within the Department of Health and Human Services, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) performs many of its administrative functions. The CDC director also serves as the ATSDR administrator, and ATSDR has a joint Office of the Director with the National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH). The ATSDR headquarters are located in Atlanta, Georgia, at the CDC Chamblee campus. In fiscal year 2010, ATSDR had an operating budget of $76.8 million and had roughly 300 full-time employees (not including contractors).

The ATSDR is formally and administratively overseen by the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), currently Mandy Cohen since July 10, 2023 Direction is provided by ATSDR&#x27;s Director, currently Patrick N. Breysse, who ranks below the Administrator, and ATSDR&#x27;s Associate Director, currently Christopher M. Reh.

== Overview ==
ATSDR is an agency within the US Department of Health and Human Services concerned with the effects of hazardous substances on human health. ATSDR is charged with assessing the presence and nature of health hazards at specific Superfund sites, as well as helping prevent or reduce further exposure and the illnesses that can result from such exposures. ATSDR is an oversight agency created to ensure that public health protection and environmental regulation work hand in hand.

ATSDR functions include public health assessments of National Priority List (NPL or Superfund) hazardous waste sites; petitioned health consultations or assessments concerning specific waste sites or industrial facilities that US citizens have requested further action upon; the conduct of health studies (including surveillance and registries) to determine the long-term impact of these facilities; response to emergency releases of hazardous substances, applied research in support of public health assessments, information development and dissemination, and education and training concerning hazardous substances. ATSDR also prepares toxicological profiles for hazardous substances found at National Priorities List sites, as well as at federal sites administered by the Department of Defense and Department of Energy.

== Goals ==
ATSDR has seven goals:
# Protect the public from environmental hazards and toxic exposures.
# Promote healthy environments.
# Advance the science of environmental public health.
# Support environmental public health practice.
# Educate communities, partners, and policy makers about environmental health risks and protective measures.
# Promote environmental justice and reduce health disparities associated with environmental exposures.
# Provide unique scientific and technical expertise to advance public health science and practice.

== Authority ==
Unlike the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), ATSDR is an advisory, nonregulatory agency. ATSDR conducts research on the health impacts of hazardous waste sites and provides information and recommendations to federal and state agencies, community members, and other interested parties. However, ATSDR is not involved in cleanup of those sites, nor can ATSDR provide or fund medical treatment for people who have been exposed to hazardous substances.

==History==

In response to the environmental disasters at Love Canal and Times Beach, Missouri, Congress passed the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), commonly known as the Superfund legislation. CERCLA gave EPA primary responsibility for identifying, investigating, and cleaning up hazardous waste sites. CERCLA also authorized the establishment of ATSDR to assess the presence and nature of health hazards to communities living near Superfund sites, to help prevent or reduce harmful exposures, and to expand the knowledge base about the health effects that result from exposure to hazardous substances. 

A 1982 lawsuit litigated by Chemical Manufacturers Association and the American Petroleum Institute forced the creation of ATSDR, which was created as an agency under the Department of Health and Human Services on April 19, 1983. James O. Mason served as the agency&#x27;s first administrator. The Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) gave ATSDR additional authority related to hazardous waste storage facilities. ATSDR was charged with conducting public health assessments at these sites when requested by EPA, states, or individuals, as well as assisting EPA to determine which substances should be regulated and the levels at which chemicals may pose a threat to human health. ATSDR was formally organized as an agency on June 11, 1985. The Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA) broadened ATSDR&#x27;s responsibilities in the areas of public health assessments, establishment and maintenance of toxicological databases, information dissemination, and medical education. 

In 2003, the position of assistant administrator was replaced with a director who is shared with NCEH.

==Organization==

===Administration===
CDC Director Mandy Cohen serves concurrently/&quot;ex officio&quot; as ATSDR administrator and CDC director, heading the Office of the Administrator. Patrick N. Breysse, PhD. serves as director of NCEH/ATSDR, heading the Office of the Director. The ATSDR administrator/CDC director, who provides overall leadership of the agency, is appointed by the president of the United States; the appointment does not require Senate approval. The ATSDR administrator appoints the NCEH/ATSDR director, who is responsible for managing the agency&#x27;s programs and activities.

===Organizational structure===
* Office of the Administrator (also CDC Director)
* Office of the Director (also NCEH (National Center for Environmental Health) head)
** Office of Communications
** Office of Science

** Office of Policy, Partnerships, and Planning
* Office of the Associate Director
** Office of Innovation and Analytics (OIA)
** Office of Community Health Hazard Assessment (OCHHA)
** Office of Capacity Development and Applied Prevention Science (OCDAPS)

The Office of the Director (of ASTDR) is joint with that of NCEH; it also contains seven functional units, five offices, five program-specific divisions to support and implement six program areas:

* Public Health Assessments

* Toxicological Profiles

* Emergency Response

* Exposure and Disease Registries

==Programs==
===Public health assessments and health consultations===
One of ATSDR&#x27;s primary responsibilities is conducting public health assessments and health consultations. The agency conducts public health assessments for all current or proposed sites on the National Priorities List (commonly known as Superfund sites). The purpose of public health assessments is to examine whether hazardous substances at a site pose a human health hazard and to issue recommendations about limiting or stopping exposure to those substances. ATSDR also conducts health consultations, often in response to requests from EPA and state and local agencies. Health consultations examine specific health questions, such as the health effects of exposure to a specific chemical at a site. Health consultations are more limited in scope than public health assessments. ATSDR also conducts public health assessments and health consultations in response to petitions from members of the public. To conduct public health assessments and health consultations, ATSDR relies on its own scientists or establishes cooperative agreements with states, providing technical assistance to state health departments. ATSDR issued more than 200 public health assessments in 2009 and provides about 1,000 health consultations each year.

When investigating sites, ATSDR examines environmental data, health data, and information from community members about how the site affects their quality of life. ATSDR normally does not collect its own environmental data; rather, it usually relies on partner organizations, such as EPA, to conduct testing and gather data. This environmental data provides information on the amount of contamination and possible ways humans could be exposed to the hazardous substances at the site. The health data provides information on rates of illness, disease, and death in the local community. Since ATSDR is an advisory agency, the conclusions in its public health assessments and health consultations are often in the form of recommendations to state and national environmental and health agencies, such as EPA, that have regulatory authority. Other agencies and the general public rely on ATSDR to provide trusted information on the health effects of hazardous substances at contaminated sites.

===Toxicology research===
Another major responsibility of ATSDR is producing toxicological profiles for the most common substances that are found at Superfund sites. The toxicological profiles summarize important studies on the substances&#x27; health effects. ATSDR also publishes ToxFAQs, ToxGuides, and public health statements, which summarize the health information in toxicological profiles for use by the general public and health professionals. The agency maintains a Toxic Substances Portal that compiles all of the agency&#x27;s toxicology information and allows users to search by chemical. ATSDR has published toxicological profiles for more than 250 hazardous substances.

ATSDR has a computational toxicology laboratory that conducts research and modeling on the effects of toxic substances on human health. The agency&#x27;s toxicology work involves pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling, quantitative structure–activity relationship methods, and benchmark dose modeling, as well as establishing minimal risk levels for human exposure to hazardous substances. One model developed by the toxicology laboratory showed that children were much more susceptible than adults to chemical exposure from inhalation and oral exposure. In the aftermath of chemical spills and emergencies, the laboratory also conducts research for state and local health departments on the health effects of the chemicals involved.

===Health registries===
ATSDR maintains registries of people who were exposed to certain toxic substances or have certain diseases. Participation in these registries is voluntary, and individual data and personal information is kept private. The information collected is used by epidemiologists and other researchers to examine long-term health outcomes or risk factors for illness. It can also help doctors diagnose those health conditions in other individuals and treat them earlier. The agency also uses registries to contact registered individuals with important health information.

====Tremolite Asbestos Registry====
The Tremolite Asbestos Registry contains people who lived in or worked in Libby, Montana, while vermiculite was mined there; these people were at risk for exposure to the tremolite asbestos that was naturally occurring in the vermiculite. ATSDR began addressing public health concerns in Libby in 1999 and created the registry in 2004. The purpose of the registry was to monitor the long-term health effects of people in Libby exposed to tremolite asbestos and to assist with communicating important health information to registrants. Researchers have used the registry to study how asbestos exposure affects human health. This research has yielded several important findings. Registry data was used to conduct the first study of the relationship between asbestos exposure and respiratory problems in children. Another study using registry data found a significant relationship between asbestos exposure and death from cardiovascular disease.

====World Trade Center Health Registry====
The World Trade Center Health Registry was established in 2002 by ATSDR and the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to track the long-term physical and mental health effects of the September 11 attacks. The registry contains more than 71,000 people who lived, worked, or went to school near the World Trade Center site, as well as emergency response personnel who were involved in rescue and recovery efforts. It is the largest post-disaster health registry in the United States. Researchers use the registry to study the health effects of the disaster and to develop public health recommendations for future disasters. A 2009 study based on registry data found that posttraumatic stress disorder and asthma were the two most commonly reported conditions among registry participants five to six years after the disaster. The study found that 19% of adult participants reported new posttraumatic stress symptoms, and 10% of adult participants reported developing new asthma.

====ALS Registry====
As of 2008, ATSDR is starting a new registry for people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (also known as ALS or Lou Gehrig&#x27;s Disease). President George W. Bush signed the ALS Registry Act, which provided for establishment of the registry, on October 8, 2008. It is hoped that the registry will provide information on the prevalence of ALS and lead to a better understanding of factors that may be associated with the disease. The agency began registering people for the registry on October 20, 2010.

===Surveillance===
ATSDR conducts surveillance by maintaining projects to collect and analyze information on diseases and chemical exposures. Research using that information and data can then be used to prevent future and control injury, disease, and death.

====Hazardous Substances Emergency Events Surveillance Program====
One of the most notable surveillance projects was the Hazardous Substances Emergency Events Surveillance (HSEES) program, which lasted from 1990 to 2009. ATSDR partnered with 15 states to collect information for HSEES in order to track, report, and study chemical spills. The information in the HSEES system was used to plan for emergency events involving hazardous substances (including terrorist attacks). States also used the information to develop policies and programs to strengthen public health and reduce illnesses and deaths that can result from exposure to hazardous substances. For example, states used HSEES data to support legislation addressing the problem of hazardous chemicals at illegal methamphetamine labs. Other states used HSEES data to implement programs designed to minimize exposure to hazardous chemicals and mercury at schools. More than 50 published studies were conducted using HSEES data.

====National Toxic Substance Incidents Program====
As a successor to the HSEES program, ATSDR launched the National Toxic Substance Incidents Program (NTSIP) in 2009. One aspect of NTSIP is a national database of information related to chemical spills. NTSIP also has Assessment of Chemical Exposure teams to assist state and local health departments in the aftermath of toxic spills. These teams interview people who were exposed to the hazardous substances and collect samples to test the level of contamination in the environment and in people.

===Emergency response===
ATSDR represents the Department of Health and Human Services on the National Response Team and works with other agencies to provide technical assistance during emergencies involving hazardous substances, such as chemical spills. In July 2007, for example, ATSDR responded to the Verdigris River flood in Coffeyville, Kansas, after an oil refinery spilled crude oil into the floodwaters, contaminating many homes in the city. ATSDR worked with EPA and state and local authorities to provide health information to local residents and advised those agencies during the clean-up process. ATSDR also assists with responding to terrorism incidents, which have included the September 11 attacks and the 2001 anthrax attacks. ATSDR responded to 132 chemical emergency events in 2008.

In addition to working with communities and other agencies in the aftermath of chemical emergencies, ATSDR has developed the Managing Hazardous Materials Incidents series, which includes several tools to assist emergency medical services personnel and hospital emergency departments during chemical emergencies. This includes important information on emergency planning, emergency response, and rescuer protection. Another tool is the Medical Management Guidelines, which summarize important information on exposure to common chemicals and provide suggestions for safely treating and decontaminating patients.

===Brownfield/land reuse initiative===
ATSDR works closely with communities to evaluate the public health effects related to redevelopment of brownfields properties. These are sites that were formerly used for industrial purposes and may still be contaminated with hazardous substances. ATSDR has worked at more than 400 brownfield or land reuse sites to assess health effects of potential exposure to hazardous substances. The agency has created resources to provide guidance to communities when planning redevelopment projects, including tools to evaluate the potential threat of chemicals at development sites. In addition to evaluating the health effects of contamination at specific brownfield sites, ATSDR encourages communities to monitor community health. One of the agency&#x27;s brownfields projects was the Menomonee Valley in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where the agency evaluated potential health effects of contamination at the site and worked closely with developers and the city.

===Community partnerships===
A major focus of the work ATSDR does involves interacting with communities. ATSDR often establishes partnerships with state and local health departments to assist them with their public health duties. In 2008, ATSDR had cooperative agreements with 29 states and one tribal government, providing technical assistance to help those partners address local environmental health concerns. ATSDR also creates community assistance panels to solicit feedback and community health concerns from local residents when the agency works at sites to evaluate health effects resulting from exposure to toxic substances.

===National Conversation on Public Health and Chemical Exposures===
In June 2009, ATSDR and NCEH launched a joint project, the National Conversation on Public Health and Chemical Exposures. The goal of the National Conversation is to develop recommendations for ways ATSDR and other government agencies can improve their efforts to protect the public from harmful chemical exposures. To foster a productive dialogue, ATSDR encouraged broad public participation in the National Conversation and welcomed involvement from all interested stakeholders, including government agencies, public health professionals, environmental organizations, community leaders, business and industry representatives, tribal groups, and other interested citizens. The National Conversation is led by a 40-person Leadership Council that includes experts in various areas related to environmental public health. In addition, there are six work groups, which also have a diverse membership, to research and propose recommendations on certain key areas. To encourage involvement from community groups, interested citizens, and the general public, ATSDR developed a community toolkit to assist community leaders in holding discussions to solicit feedback and ideas for the National Conversation. ATSDR plans to release its final action agenda in early 2011.

==Quality of work==
ATSDR prides itself on using &quot;the best science.&quot; And in 2003, BBC News described ATSDR as &quot;widely regarded as the world&#x27;s leading agency on public health and the environment.&quot;

However, ATSDR has also been the focus of scrutiny from Congress and other groups. Much of the criticism is due to the fact that the agency has been overtasked yet understaffed and underfunded for much of its history.
* In August 1991, the General Accounting Office (now the Government Accountability Office) published a report that faulted the quality of ATSDR&#x27;s original public health assessments and questioned their usefulness. It also placed part of the blame on the deadlines and requirements that Congress imposed with SARA: &quot;SARA’s requirement that ATSDR quickly assess 951 Superfund sites came at a time when the agency was still relatively new and ... not staffed or organized for the job.&quot; The report also noted that after meeting the SARA deadline, ATSDR was able to increase the rigor of its public health assessments.
* In May 1992, the Environmental Health Network and the National Toxics Campaign Fund published &quot;Inconclusive by Design,&quot; a report which noted structural limitations to the work of CDC and ATSDR.
* In April 2008, the United States House of Representatives Committee on Science and Technology Subcommittee on Investigations and Oversight held a hearing on formaldehyde exposures in trailers that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) provided as temporary housing to people displaced by Hurricane Katrina. A report based on the hearing, issued by the subcommittee&#x27;s Democratic majority staff in September 2008, noted shortcomings in the agency’s original health consultation that examined the health risks of formaldehyde in the FEMA trailers.
* In March 2009, the Democratic majority staff of the Subcommittee on Investigations and Oversight issued another report on ATSDR, which called for leadership changes within the agency. The report stated: &quot;Time and time again ATSDR appears to avoid clearly and directly confronting the most obvious toxic culprits that harm the health of local communities throughout the nation. Instead, they deny, delay, minimize, trivialize or ignore legitimate concerns and health considerations of local communities and well respected scientists and medical professionals.&quot;
In the March 12, 2009, congressional hearing, the subcommittee chairman, Congressman Brad Miller, characterized ATSDR as keen to &quot;please industries and government agencies&quot; and referred to ATSDR&#x27;s reports as &quot;jackleg assessments saying &#x27;not to worry.&#x27;&quot; In defense of ATSDR&#x27;s work, director Howard Frumkin noted that ATSDR&#x27;s staff has declined from 500 to about 300, and that often communities expect &quot;definitive answers about the links between exposures and illnesses,&quot; but expectations can be unmet due to scientific uncertainty. However, Frumkin also acknowledged the possibility that some assessments did not use the best data or monitoring techniques.

===Vieques, Puerto Rico===
In 2003, ATSDR released public health assessments that evaluated the potential health effects of pollution left behind by the United States Navy in Vieques, Puerto Rico. The public health assessments noted that residents of the island were exposed to environmental contamination at such low levels that no harmful health effects were expected, and the agency concluded that there was &quot;no apparent public health hazard.&quot; In 2009, however, ATSDR announced that it had identified gaps in environmental data and planned to take a &quot;fresh look&quot; at Vieques by reviewing studies on the island.

=== West Lake Landfill, Missouri ===
In 2015, ATSDR released a report, based on EPA data, declaring no health risk to communities near West Lake Landfill. The agency&#x27;s assessment contradicted findings from scientific investigations initiated by the Missouri attorney general and affected residents, who started organizing in 2012 when an underground fire in the landfill raised awareness of radioactive material and high rates of childhood cancer. Republic Services, one of the parties responsible for the landfill, has cited the report to argue against the removal of toxic waste.

<text>Porthmadog (), spelt Portmadoc until 1972 and known locally as &quot;Port&quot;, is a coastal town and community in the Eifionydd area of Gwynedd, Wales, and the historic county of Caernarfonshire. It lies east of Criccieth, south-west of Blaenau Ffestiniog, north of Dolgellau and south of Caernarfon. The community population was 4,185 in the 2011 census and was put at 4,134 in 2019. It grew in the 19th century as a port for local slate, but as the trade declined, it continued as a shopping and tourism centre, being close to Snowdonia National Park and the Ffestiniog Railway. The 1987 National Eisteddfod was held there. It includes nearby Borth-y-Gest, Morfa Bychan and Tremadog.

==History==
Porthmadog came about after William Madocks built a sea wall, the Cob, in 1808–1811 to reclaim much of Traeth Mawr from the sea for farming use. Diversion of the Afon Glaslyn caused it to scour out a new natural harbour deep enough for small ocean-going sailing ships, and the first public wharves appeared in 1825. Quarry companies followed, with wharves along the shore almost to Borth-y-Gest, while slate was carted from Ffestiniog down to quays along the Afon Dwyryd, then boated to Porthmadog for transfer to seagoing vessels.
In the later 19th century, Porthmadog flourished as a port, its population rising from 885 in 1821 to over 3,000 by 1861. The rapidly growing cities of England needed high-quality roofing slate, which was brought to the new port by tramway from quarries in Ffestiniog and Llanfrothen. The Ffestiniog Railway opened in 1836, followed by the Gorseddau Tramway in 1856 and the Croesor Tramway in 1864. By 1873 over 116,000 tons (117,800 t) were exported through Porthmadog in over a thousand ships. Several shipbuilders were active at this time. They were known particularly for their three-masted schooners called Western Ocean Yachts, the last of which was launched in 1913.

By 1841 the trackway across the reclaimed land had been straightened. It would develop into Stryd Fawr, the main commercial street of the town, with a range of shops and public houses and a post office, but the open green retained. A mineral railway to Tremadog ran along what would become Heol Madog. To the north was an industrial area of foundries, timber saw mills, slate works, a flour mill, a soda-pop plant and gasworks.

Porthmadog&#x27;s role as a commercial port, already reduced by the opening of the Aberystwith and Welsh Coast Railway in 1867, was effectively ended by the First World War, when the lucrative German market for slate collapsed. The 19th-century wharves survive, but the slate warehouses have been replaced by holiday apartments and the harbour is used by leisure yachts.

==Etymology==
The name Porthmadog derives from its English spelling, Portmadoc, the official name until 1972. This was a conjunction of Port and Madocks, although some believe it is named after a folklore character, Madog ab Owain Gwynedd, whose name appears also in &quot;Ynys Fadog&quot; (&quot;Madog Island&quot;).

The earliest references to &quot;Port Madoc&quot; are from the 1820s in reference to shipping, well before the opening of the Ffestiniog Railway and the town&#x27;s later growth. The name first appeared on an Ordnance Survey map in 1838.

==Governance==

There are two tiers of local government covering Porthmadog, at community (town) and county level, with both councils using Welsh as their primary language: Cyngor Tref Porthmadog (Porthmadog Town Council) and Cyngor Gwynedd (Gwynedd Council). The town council meets at Y Ganolfan, a community centre on High Street adjoining the harbour bridge. The building also incorporates the town&#x27;s tourist information centre.

From 1950 to 2010, Porthmadog was part of Caernarfon parliamentary constituency. In 2010 the town became part of the Dwyfor Meirionnydd constituency. In the Senedd, it has since 2007 formed part of Dwyfor-Meirionnydd constituency. It is represented by Mabon ap Gwynfor. It forms part of the electoral region of &quot;Mid and West Wales&quot;.

===Administrative history===
The Porthmadog area historically formed part of the parish of Ynyscynhaiarn (or Ynyscynhaearn). The parish church was St Cynhaearn&#x27;s Church, which stands in an isolated location west of Porthmadog. The parish was in two separate parts: an eastern part including the Porthmadog and Tremadog area, and a western part which included the parish church and the village of Pentrefelin. The small parish of Treflys separated the two parts of Ynyscynhaiarn parish. Ynyscynhaiarn formed part of the ancient commote of Eifionydd, which in 1284 was made part of the new county of Caernarfonshire under the Statute of Rhuddlan.

Following the development of Porthmadog and neighbouring Tremadog in the early nineteenth century, there was a need for more formal structures of local government. In 1858 the parish of Ynyscynhaiarn was made a local board district, governed by an elected local board. Such local board districts were reconstituted as urban districts under the Local Government Act 1894. In 1896 the western part of Ynyscynhaiarn, which was known as the township of Uwchyllyn, was transferred to the parish of Treflys, leaving the reduced parish and urban district of Ynyscynhaiarn just covering the eastern part of the old parish, which included Porthmadog and Tremadog.

In 1915 the county council changed the urban district&#x27;s name from Ynyscynhaiarn to Portmadoc at the urban district council&#x27;s request. In 1934 part of the area was transferred to Dolbenmaen and a smaller area was taken in from Treflys, which was abolished. The urban district council changed the official spelling of the name from Portmadoc to Porthmadog at a meeting on 9 May 1972.

Porthmadog Urban District was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. A community called Porthmadog was created instead, covering the area of the abolished urban district. District-level functions passed to Dwyfor District Council, which was in turn replaced in 1996 by Gwynedd Council.

==Geography==
Porthmadog lies in Eifionydd, on the estuary of the Afon Glaslyn, where it runs into Tremadog Bay. The estuary, filled with sediment deposited by rivers emptying from the melting glaciers at the end of the last ice age, is a haven for migrating birds. Oystercatchers, redshanks and curlews are common, as are summer flocks of sandwich terns. To the west looms Moel y Gest, rising above the town as a Marilyn.

The town&#x27;s temperate maritime climate is influenced by the Gulf Stream.


===Villages===
====Borth-y-Gest====
Borth-y-Gest, south of Porthmadog, is built in a shallow bowl sweeping down to a sheltered bay, with hidden sandy coves and cliffs. Ships were built here before Porthmadog was established and houses, still known as &quot;pilot houses&quot;, were erected at the mouth of the harbour so that pilots could watch for ships needing them. The village and its rows of Victorian houses have retained much of its atmosphere and charm. Stryd Mersey leads up from the bay, flanked by terraced cottages.

Before Porthmadog was developed, this was the starting point of a major crossing over the wide and dangerous Glaslyn estuary. Locals earned money by guiding travellers across the treacherous sands of Traeth Mawr to Harlech.

Parc y Borth is a local nature reserve in deciduous woodland dominated by ancient Welsh oaks. Green woodpeckers, tawny owls and pied flycatchers can be seen among the branches.

On the shore is another nature reserve, Pen y Banc, a mixture of coastal rocks, secluded sandy coves and mixed woodland. Established in 1996, it is a good spot to see wading birds. Its beaches attract many visitors. The mild climate results in a wide variety of vegetation, from gorse and heather through to blackthorn, crab apple, and birch.

====Morfa Bychan====

Morfa Bychan, south-west of Porthmadog, has a wide beach, Black Rock Sands (Welsh: Traeth Morfa Bychan), with Graig Ddu, a rocky headland, at its western end. At low tide, rock pools and caverns are exposed. The beach is popular with windsurfers, and is unusual in allowing vehicles onto the sands.

Sand dunes behind the beach form part of Morfa Bychan and Greenacres Nature Reserve. Standing in a field is Cist Cerrig, a dolmen, near which are rocks containing cup marks.

In 1996 there were protests backed by Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg against the building of 800 houses at Morfa Bychan. These followed a High Court decision that planning permission granted in 1964 remained valid. The owners of the site later entered a legal agreement with Cyngor Gwynedd, allowing a caravan site and nature reserve to be placed on part of the site, which ensured that the 1964 permit could no longer be implemented. The council also settled a compensation claim by developers for the way the matter had been handled.

====Tremadog====
Tremadog, a planned settlement north of Porthmadog, was built on land reclaimed from Traeth Mawr by William Madocks. In 1805 the first cottages appeared in what Madocks called Pentre Gwaelod (&quot;Bottom Village&quot;), which was designed to give an impression of a borough, with a central Town Hall and Dance Room. Industry included in the plan consisted of a Manufactory, Loomery, fulling mill and corn mill, all worked by water power.

To the north is Tan-yr-Allt, a property bought by Madocks for the first Regency house in Gwynedd. The sloping garden consists mainly of lawns planted with trees and shrubs. It includes a memorial to Percy Bysshe Shelley.

==Demography==
At the 2001 census, Porthmadog had a population of 4,187, of whom 18.2 per cent were below the age of 16 and 23.6 per cent were over 65 years of age; 69.5 per cent of households were in owner-occupied accommodation and 24.6 per cent were renting. Holiday homes accounted for 12.5 per cent of dwellings.

According to the 2011 census, 71% of residents were born in Wales and 24.5% in England.

==Economy==
At the 2001 census, 44.3 per cent of the working-age population were employed, 11.5 per cent self-employed, 5.3 per cent unemployed and 20.4 per cent retired. Of the employed, 33.0 per cent worked in the distribution, hotel and catering trades and 23.5 per cent in public administration, education and health.
Porthmadog expanded rapidly as a slate-exporting port. Slate had already reached King&#x27;s Lynn and the Port of Wisbech by 1830 and was shipped further inland in barges for use in late Georgian era development. Welsh slate was also in high demand as a construction material in the English industrial cities and transported to the new port by horse-drawn tramways. The Ffestiniog Railway, opened in 1836 as a gravity railway with horses hauling empty slate waggons back up to the quarries, was converted to steam operation in 1863; trains ran straight onto the wharves. By 1873 116,000 tons (117,800 t) of slate were being shipped out of Porthmadog and other trade developed. The Carnarvonshire and Merionethshire Steamship Company formed in 1864 purchased the &quot;Rebecca&quot; to carry stores from Liverpool to supply the growing town. The First World War marked the end of Porthmadog&#x27;s exports. No new ships were built, several were sunk by enemy action, and most of the survivors were sold. The arrival at Blaenau Ffestiniog of the LNWR in 1879 and the GWR in 1883 brought a steady decline in the slate traffic carried by the Festiniog Railway and Portmadoc shipping. Some slate had been carried via the Festiniog Railway, the Croesor &amp; Portmadoc Railway and the Cambrian Railways after the latter&#x27;s line had been opened between Barmouth and Pwllheli in 1867; this traffic was diverted to the exchange yard established between the Festiniog Railway and the Cambrian Railways at Minffordd in 1872. By 1925 less than five per cent of Ffestiniog&#x27;s slate output went out by sea. The final load of slate delivered by rail left by sea from Porthmadog in 1946. Two months later the railway ceased commercial operations.

Before construction of the Cob in 1812, ships had been built at locations round Traeth Mawr. As the town developed, several shipbuilders from the Meirionnydd side moved to the new port, building brigs, schooners, barquentines and brigantines. After the arrival of the railway there was a reduction in trade, but a new type of ship, the &quot;Western Ocean Yacht&quot;, was developed for the salt cod industry in Newfoundland and Labrador. Shipbuilding came to an end in 1913, the last vessel built being the &quot;Gestiana&quot;, which was lost on its maiden voyage.

In the 19th-century Porthmadog had at least three iron foundries. The Glaslyn Foundry opened in 1848, and the Union Iron Works in 1869. The Britannia Foundry, opposite Porthmadog Harbour Railway Station appeared in 1851 and grew rapidly with the town&#x27;s prosperity. It supplied slate-working machinery and railway equipment to all but one of the slate quarries operating in England and Wales. A lucrative sideline was the production of drains and manhole covers for Caernarfonshire&#x27;s roads.

==Culture==
Porthmadog is a mainly Welsh-speaking community: 74.9 per cent of the inhabitants speak it regularly. The highest proportion of Welsh speakers is in the 10–14 age range at 96.3 per cent. Almost all community activities are held in Welsh. Porthmadog hosted the National Eisteddfod in 1987.

Y Ganolfan on Stryd Fawr, built in 1975, is a venue for concerts, exhibitions and other community events. It has also hosted televised wrestling matches.

Porthmadog Maritime Museum on Oakley Wharf occupies an old slate shed. It has displays of schooners built in the town and the men who sailed them.

==Landmarks==

The Cob is a prominent embankment built across the Glaslyn estuary in 1811 by William Madocks to reclaim land at Traeth Mawr for agriculture. It opened with a four-day feast and Eisteddfod celebrating the roadway connecting Caernarfonshire to Meirionnydd, which figured in Madocks&#x27;s plans for a road from London to his proposed port at Porthdinllaen. Three weeks later, the embankment was breached by high tides and Madocks&#x27;s supporters had to drum up money and men from all Caernarfonshire to repair the breach and strengthen the whole embankment. By 1814 it was open again, but Madocks&#x27;s finances were in ruins. By 1836 the Ffestiniog Railway had opened its line across the embankment. It then become the main route for Ffestiniog slate to reach the new port at Porthmadog. In 1927 the Cob was breached again and took several months to repair. In 2012, 260 metres of the embankment were widened on the seaward side of the Porthmadog end to allow a second platform to be added to the Ffestiniog Railway&#x27;s Harbour Station.

The former tollhouse at the north-western end of the Cob has slate-clad walls. It is one of few buildings to retain the interlocking slate ridge-tiles devised by Moses Kellow, manager of &quot;Croesor Quarry&quot;. The toll was abolished in 2003 when the Welsh Assembly Government bought the Cob.

Pen Cei, to the west of the harbour was a centre of the harbour&#x27;s commercial activities. Boats were built and repaired. There were slate wharves for each quarry company with tracks connecting to the railway. Bron Guallt, built in 1895, was the Oakeley Quarry shipping agent&#x27;s house. Grisiau Mawr (&quot;Big Steps&quot;) connected the quay to Garth and houses were built for the ship owners and sea captains. A School of Navigation was also built.

Melin Yr Wyddfa (&quot;Snowdon Mill&quot;) on Heol Y Wyddfa is a former flour mill built in 1862. A scheme of renovation and conversion to luxury flats began there, but has yet to reach completion.

The Welsh Highland Heritage Railway, not to be confused with Welsh Highland Railway, is a three-quarter-mile (1.2 km) heritage railway. It includes an award-winning miniature railway, a heritage centre, a shop and a cafe.

Kerfoots, in a Victorian building on Stryd Fawr, is a small department store founded in 1874. It contains a unique spiral staircase, chandeliers and slender cast-iron columns to support the upper floors. The Millennium Dome, constructed by local craftsmen in 1999 to mark the store&#x27;s 125th anniversary, is made of stained glass depicting scenes from Porthmadog in 1874.

The Royal Sportsman Hotel (Welsh: Gwesty&#x27;r Heliwr) on Stryd Fawr was built in 1862 as a staging post on the turnpike road to Porthdinllaen. The arrival of the railway five years later brought rising numbers of tourists, and the hotel soon became famous for its liveried carriage and horses to take guests to local sightseeing spots. The building is of Ffestiniog slate; the original stone and slate fireplaces remain.

The War Memorial stands on top of Ynys Galch, one of the former islands reclaimed from Traeth Mawr. Taking the form of a Celtic cross and standing high, it was fashioned from Trefor granite and unveiled &quot;in memory of ninety-seven fallen war heroes of Madoc Vale&quot; in 1922.

On Moel y Gest, a hill above the town, is an Iron Age stone-walled hill fort.

==Education==
The town has three local primary schools. The bilingual Ysgol Eifion Wyn in Stryd Fawr, named after a local poet, Eliseus Williams (Eifion Wyn), has 204 pupils. It moved into new premises in 2003. There are units for children with special educational needs or with language difficulties. At the last school inspection by Estyn in 2004, 9 per cent of pupils were entitled to free school meals and 72 per cent came from homes where Welsh was the main spoken language.

Ysgol Borth-y-Gest in Stryd Mersey, Borth-y-Gest, is the smallest of the three with 70 pupils. A 2009 report by Cyngor Gwynedd, Excellent Primary Education For Children In Gwynedd, set out the future for county primary schools. That of Ysgol Borth-y-Gest, built in 1880, had been in doubt. In 2006, at the last inspection by &quot;Estyn&quot;, 3 per cent of pupils were entitled to free school meals and 20 per cent came from homes where Welsh was the main spoken language.

Ysgol y Gorlan in Tremadog has 122 pupils. When Estyn last inspected in 2008, ten per cent of pupils were entitled to free school meals and some 50 per cent came from homes where Welsh was the main spoken language.

Ysgol Eifionydd in Stryd Fawr is a bilingual comprehensive school for ages 11–16, founded about 1900. It has 484 pupils. At the last Estyn inspection, in 2006, 8 per cent of pupils were entitled to free school meals and Welsh was the main home spoken language of about 50 per cent. One per cent had an ethnic minority background.

==Transport==
Porthmadog lies on the A487 trunk road between the Fishguard and Bangor. The A498 runs north from Porthmadog to Beddgelert, for access to Snowdonia. The A497 runs west through the southern Llŷn Peninsula to Criccieth and Pwllheli. In 2008 the Welsh Assembly Government issued plans for a A487 Porthmadog, Minffordd and Tremadog Bypass to reduce through traffic. This officially opened on 17 October 2011.
Of the town&#x27;s three railway stations, Porthmadog on the Cambrian Coast Line between Pwllheli and Machynlleth is served by Transport for Wales for Shrewsbury, Wolverhampton and Birmingham. Porthmadog Harbour at the southern end of Stryd Fawr, has been the Ffestiniog Railway terminus since passenger services started in 1865. Since 2011 it is also the southern terminus of the rebuilt Welsh Highland Railway from Caernarfon. The Welsh Highland Heritage Railway has its main station and visitor centre near the north end of Stryd Fawr on the former Cambrian Railways sidings opposite the mainline station. Trains run to Pen-y-Mount.

Buses are run by Arriva Buses Wales, Gwynfor Coaches, Lloyds Coaches and Caelloi Motors, to Aberystwyth, Bangor, Beddgelert, Blaenau Ffestiniog, Caernarfon, Criccieth, Dolgellau, Machynlleth, Morfa Bychan, Penrhyndeudraeth, Pen-y-Pass, Portmeirion, Pwllheli, Rhyd and Tremadog.

==Sport==
Porthmadog Football Club, founded in 1872, is one of the oldest in Wales. It plays at Y Traeth. The club won the North Wales League in 1902/1903 and reached the final of the Welsh Amateur Cup in 1905/1906. It again won the league championship in 1937/1938 and was Welsh Amateur Cup winner in 1955/56 and 1956/57. It was league champion for three successive seasons in 1966/69, and twice so in the 1970s. In 1989/1990 it topped the Welsh Alliance League and gained a place in the new Cymru Alliance. The club became an inaugural member of the League of Wales in 1992, in the first season finishing ninth. The following year Porthmadog striker Dave Taylor was the highest scoring player in Europe. The club nearly folded in 1995/96 for financial reasons and lost its place in the League of Wales in 1998. It played the following year in the Cymru Alliance, winning the League Cup, but not until 2002/03 did it gain a 19-point lead over its nearest rivals to regain the Welsh Premier League. The club was heavily fined and had points deducted by the &quot;Football Association of Wales&quot; in 2007 after a referee was racially abused by a supporter, but an appeal to an independent tribunal reduced the fine and the points were reinstated. In the 2008/2009 season Porthmadog narrowly avoided relegation, finishing 16th.

Clwb Rygbi Porthmadog, based at Clwb Chwaraeon Madog, plays rugby union in WRU Division 3 North organised by the Welsh Rugby Union, having gained promotion from the Gwynedd league in the 2011/2012 season.
Porthmadog Golf Club at Morfa Bychan opened in 1906 on land rented from a farmer. The original tenancy agreement stipulated that golfers must take no game, hares, rabbits or wildfowl and pay compensation for any sheep or cattle killed or injured. The landlord agreed not to turn on to the land any bull or savage cattle. Created by James Braid, five times winner of the &quot;British Open&quot;, the course is a mixture of heath and links. The first nine holes head inland over heathland. The final nine, heading back towards the sea, are pure links. The 14th hole, &quot;The Himalayas&quot;, is a par 4 with a huge natural bunker hiding the green from the tee.

Porthmadog Sailing Club, formed in 1958, initially operated from a marquee in a field. In 1964 the club merged with Trawsfynydd Sailing Club and a clubhouse was built. Weekend dinghy racing is run and facilities are provided for cruisers.

Madoc Yacht Club, founded in 1970, is based in the former harbourmaster&#x27;s office and has an extensive cruising and racing programme, including two races to Ireland. In 2001 a Celtic longboat was purchased and a sea-rowing section formed, which now has four boats. The club competes as part of the Welsh Sea Rowing Association 

Glaslyn Leisure Centre on Stryd y Llan has a 25-metre swimming pool and sports hall, badminton, squash and tennis courts, a sauna, a five-a-side football pitch and a dance studio.

Sea angling is popular in the coast villages. Borth-y-Gest offers flounder, bass, mullet, whiting and mackerel. Morfa Bychan provides bass, flounder, eel, whiting and occasional turbot. Bass, flounder and huge schools of whiting are found at &quot;Black Rock Sands&quot;, along with thornback ray, mackerel and garfish. Bass, flatfish, eel and some very large mullet can be caught in &quot;Porthmadog Harbour&quot;, in the heart of the town, though care must be taken to avoid taking the poisonous lesser weever.
Glaslyn Angling Association controls fishing rights on most of Afon Glaslyn up to Beddgelert. It mainly holds sea trout, but salmon and brown trout appear. The river had suffered from acid rain and afforestation, but its water quality has improved. &quot;Glan Morfa Mawr Trout Fishery&quot; at Morfa Bychan is stocked with rainbow trout

A cycle route crosses the Cob as part of , the Welsh national route from Holyhead in the north to either Cardiff or Chepstow in the south. It is long and crosses three mountain ranges.

Tremadog&#x27;s quality rock climbing brings climbers from all over Britain, the dolerite cliffs often being dry when it is too wet to climb in the mountains of Snowdonia. &quot;Craig Bwlch y Moch&quot; is seen as one of the best crags in Wales.

A fell race on the slopes of &quot;Moel y Gest&quot; known as &quot;Râs Moel y Gest&quot; is held each year, starting in the town.

Bathing is popular at the broad beach of Black Rock Sands, with a predicted water quality of &quot;excellent&quot;. Borth-y-Gest has a sand-and-pebble beach where bathing is safe inshore, but there are fast currents further out.

<text>William George Hayden (23 January 1933 – 21 October 2023) was an Australian politician who served as the 21st governor-general of Australia from 1989 to 1996. He was Leader of the Labor Party and Leader of the Opposition from 1977 to 1983, and served as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade from 1983 to 1988 under Bob Hawke and as Treasurer of Australia in 1975 under Gough Whitlam.

Hayden was born in Brisbane, Queensland. He attended Brisbane State High School and then joined the Queensland Police, working as a police officer for eight years while studying economics part-time at the University of Queensland. Hayden was elected to the House of Representatives at the 1961 federal election, aged 28 – along with Manfred Cross and Doug McClelland, Hayden was the earliest elected Labor MP still alive at the time of his death. When Gough Whitlam led the Labor Party to victory in 1972, Hayden was made Minister for Social Security. He replaced Jim Cairns as Treasurer in 1975, but served for only five months before the government was dismissed.

In early 1977, Hayden challenged Whitlam for the party leadership and was defeated by just two votes. He defeated Lionel Bowen to succeed Whitlam as Leader of the Opposition at the end of the year, following Labor&#x27;s defeat at the 1977 election. Hayden led the party to the 1980 election, recording a substantial swing but falling short of victory. He was replaced by Bob Hawke just a few weeks before the 1983 election, after months of speculation. Hayden served as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade from 1983 to 1988, then left parliament to assume the governor-generalship. He held that position for seven years, with only Lord Gowrie having served for longer.

==Early life==
Hayden was born on 23 January 1933 at the Lady Bowen Lying-In Hospital in Spring Hill, Queensland. He was the first child born to Violet Quinn and George Hayden, who married a few weeks after his birth. He had a younger brother and two younger sisters, as well as an older half-brother from his mother&#x27;s first marriage who was raised by an aunt. His parents both had prior marriages which ended in widowhood.

Hayden&#x27;s father was an American seaman, probably born in California, who jumped ship in Sydney a few years before World War I. He worked as a piano-tuner and musical instrument salesman, moving to Rockhampton, Queensland, in the early 1920s. He held radical political views and was a member of the Industrial Workers of the World. Hayden&#x27;s mother was born in Brandon, Queensland, to a working-class family of Irish descent. After the death of her first husband, a shearer, she worked in Rockhampton as a barmaid. The couple moved to Brisbane during the Great Depression.

Hayden spent his first year at a boardinghouse in Fortitude Valley, before the family moved to a rented cottage in the working-class area of Highgate Hill. The family became more financially stable after his father enlisted in the army in 1941. He began his education at St Ita&#x27;s Catholic Primary School in South Brisbane, but was withdrawn from the school when it rescinded his father&#x27;s contract to tune the school pianos. He switched to Dutton Park State School and was later highly critical of the quality of education that he received. Hayden went on to South Brisbane Intermediate School, where he passed the state scholarship exam in 1947. This allowed him to complete his secondary education at Brisbane State High School in 1948 and 1949. After leaving school, he found work as a junior clerk in the State Government Stores, where he worked until joining the police. He was conscripted to the Royal Australian Navy for six months following the passage of the &quot;National Service Act 1951&quot;, having earlier unsuccessfully applied to join the Royal Australian Air Force as an 18-year-old.

==Policing career==
Hayden joined the Queensland Police Force in 1953 following his father&#x27;s death. He completed his training in Brisbane and the following year was transferred to Mackay in North Queensland. He was briefly stationed in the small country towns of Calen and Sarina. As he was supporting his mother and younger siblings, he also worked a second full-time job driving a milk truck and various seasonal jobs on rural properties. In 1956, Hayden was transferred back to Brisbane and worked as a plainclothes constable at the Criminal Investigation Branch (CIB). He was later moved to police headquarters on Roma Street where he was rostered on at Government House, guarding the governor of Queensland. He was transferred again in 1957 to the two-man police station at Redbank, on the outskirts of Ipswich.

==Politics (1961–1988)==

Hayden held far-left views as a young man and attempted to join the Communist Party of Australia, but was refused membership due to his police ties. He first attempted to join the ALP in South Brisbane in 1953, but was also regarded with suspicion in the context of the ALP split of the mid-1950s. He was ultimately recruited to the Redbank branch of the ALP in 1957. Hayden became &quot;an active and energetic party worker, closely aligned with the left-wing Trades Hall faction that now controlled the Queensland ALP&quot;. He became secretary of the electoral executive committee for the state seat of Bremer and president of the divisional executive for the federal seat of Oxley. In 1960 he began attending adult matriculation classes with a view towards attending university. He also attended political science lectures given by Max Poulter at the Brisbane Trades Hall.

In October 1960, Hayden won ALP preselection for the federal seat of Oxley, running as the Trades Hall candidate against Australian Workers&#x27; Union (AWU) candidate Bert Warren. At the 1961 federal election he unexpectedly defeated incumbent Liberal MP and cabinet minister Donald Cameron, winning 53 percent of the primary vote on an 11-point swing. Hayden&#x27;s win was part of a 15-seat swing to Labor that nearly brought down the Menzies government.

Overcoming initial resistance to his membership of the Labor party, Hayden was soon popularly elected as one of the then youngest members of the federal parliament (only 28 years old at the time he entered it). He proved to be a diligent, well-spoken parliamentarian. In 1969, he became a member of the Opposition front bench.

===Whitlam government (1972–1975)===

When Labor won the 1972 election under Gough Whitlam, Hayden was appointed Minister for Social Security, and in that capacity, among other efforts to promoting reform, introduced the single mothers pension and Medibank, Australia&#x27;s first system of universal health insurance. On 6 June 1975, he succeeded Jim Cairns as Treasurer, a position he held until the Whitlam government was dismissed by the Governor-General, Sir John Kerr, on 11 November 1975. Labor suffered its worst-ever defeat in the election held a month later, and Hayden was left as the only Labor MP from Queensland.

===Opposition leader (1977–1983)===
When Labor lost the 1977 election in another landslide, Whitlam retired as leader. In the ensuing leadership ballot Hayden was elected over Lionel Bowen to succeed him; Bowen was then elected as Hayden&#x27;s deputy. Aged almost 45, he was the youngest person to be elected leader of the Labor Party since Chris Watson in 1901. His political views had become more moderate, and he advocated economic policies which encompassed the private sector and the American alliance.

At the 1980 election, Labor finished a mere 0.8 percent behind Fraser&#x27;s government on the two-party vote, having gained a nationwide swing of over four percent. Yet, due to the geographically uneven nature of the swing (strong in Victoria and, to a lesser degree, Western Australia and New South Wales, but comparatively weak everywhere else), Labor fell 12 seats short of making Hayden Prime Minister. Hayden did, however, regain much of what Labor had lost in the landslides of 1975 and 1977. He also slashed Fraser&#x27;s majority in half, from 23 seats to 11.

By 1982, it was evident that Fraser was manoeuvring to call an early election. But the main threat to Hayden came less from Fraser than from elements in Hayden&#x27;s own party. Bob Hawke, a former union leader who had been elected to Parliament two years earlier, began mobilising his supporters to challenge Hayden&#x27;s leadership. On 16 July 1982 Hayden narrowly defeated a challenge by Hawke in a party ballot but Hawke continued to plot against Hayden.

In December, Labor surprised many pundits by its failure to win the vital Flinders by-election in Victoria, further raising doubts about Hayden&#x27;s ability to lead the ALP to power. On 3 February 1983, in a meeting in Brisbane, various leading Labor figures, including Paul Keating and Senator John Button, told Hayden that he must resign. He reluctantly accepted their advice. Hawke was then elected leader on 8 February, unopposed.

Fraser had been well aware of the infighting within Labor and wanted to call an election before the party could replace Hayden with Hawke. He believed that if he put Parliament into &quot;caretaker mode&quot; early enough, Labor would essentially be frozen with Hayden as its leader. On the same morning that Hayden resigned, Fraser asked for, and was granted, an election for 5 March. Unknown to Fraser, however, Hayden resigned two hours before Fraser travelled to Yarralumla. He only learned of Hayden&#x27;s resignation a few hours before the election writs were issued. At a press conference that afternoon Hayden, still chagrined, said that &quot;a drover&#x27;s dog could lead the Labor Party to victory, the way the country is&quot;. Hayden&#x27;s quip about a &quot;drover&#x27;s dog&quot; became part of Australian political history. Hayden himself referred to it good-humouredly many years later when he said, &quot;There are so many things I did in my political life that I am very proud of. ... But the one thing I am remembered for is damn well saying &#x27;A drover&#x27;s dog could win the next election&#x27;. It seems to have settled into political idiom. The only person who didn&#x27;t like it was Bob Hawke.&quot;

===Foreign minister (1983–1988)===
Labor won the 1983 election in a rout, handing the Coalition what is still the worst defeat of a sitting non-Labor government since Federation. Hayden became Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. In that post, he advocated closer integration between Australia and its Asian neighbours. In a 1983 interview, he stated: &quot;Australia is changing. We&#x27;re an anomaly as a European country in this part of the world. There&#x27;s already a large and growing Asian population in Australia and it is inevitable in my view that Australia will become an Eurasian country over the next century or two. Australian Asians and Europeans will marry another and a new race will emerge: I happen to think that&#x27;s desirable.&quot;

As Foreign Minister, Hayden had oversight of the Australian foreign aid program. He pursued efforts to engage Vietnam and Cambodia despite vehement opposition from allied nations and key stakeholders. In 1983, Hayden announced a review of the Australian foreign aid program (known as the &quot;Jackson Review&quot; after the chair, Sir Gordon Jackson), which reported in March 1984. The main recommendations of the report, which were directed at improving the professional quality of the Australian aid program, were accepted by the Government. During the next few years, in various speeches, Hayden set out the foreign aid priorities of the government.

==Governor-General (1989–1996)==

After winning the 1987 election, Prime Minister Hawke announced that Queen Elizabeth II, Queen of Australia had approved of Hayden&#x27;s appointment as Governor-General of Australia. This was widely viewed as a consolation on Hawke&#x27;s part for replacing Hayden earlier as Labor Leader in 1983 and thus denying him the chance to become prime minister. The Queen&#x27;s appointment of Hayden as Governor-General to succeed Sir Ninian Stephen was announced in mid-1988. On 17 August, Hayden resigned from Parliament, becoming the last MP to leave Parliament before the recently opened New Parliament House began sitting the following week. He also severed his political connections with the Labor Party. He took up the post of Governor-General in early 1989 and served during the period of transition from the Hawke government to the Keating government in December 1991. The usual term served by a Governor-General was five years but, by agreement between the government and Hayden, his term was extended for an additional two years to early 1996.

Upon his appointment as Governor-General, he became, &quot;ex officio&quot;, Chancellor and Principal Companion of the Order of Australia.

Other Governor-Generals had been appointed by The Scout Association as its Chief Scout of Australia but Hayden declined because he was an atheist, which was incompatible with the Scout Promise. Instead, The Scout Association of Australia appointed him as its national patron.

==Later life==

By the late 1990s, Hayden joined the board of &quot;Quadrant&quot;. In the debate preceding the 1999 republic referendum, he rejected the specific proposal and sided with the monarchists, stating he supported the direct election of a president.

After retiring from the position of Governor-General, Hayden continued to contribute to public policy discussion in Australia. While on the board of &quot;Quadrant&quot;, he took time to lend personal support to the publication and wrote a tribute to its editor P.P. McGuinness on his death in 2008. He also continued to write opinion and comment pieces for other magazines and newspapers in Australia about current social, economic and political issues including foreign affairs.

==Personal life==
In May 1960, Hayden married Dallas Broadfoot (born 28 September 1936), the daughter of a miner from Ipswich. They initially lived in a rented cottage in Dinmore before building a house in Ipswich&#x27;s western suburbs. The couple had three daughters and a son. Their oldest daughter Michaela died in 1966 at the age of five after being struck by a car. 

In September 2018, Hayden was baptized as a Roman Catholic at St Mary&#x27;s Church, Ipswich. He told &quot;The Catholic Leader&quot; that &quot;there&#x27;s been a gnawing pain in my heart and soul about what is the meaning of life&quot;. The baptismal ceremony was attended by a gathering of family, friends, and former colleagues. Hayden&#x27;s siblings, Patricia Oxenham, John Hayden, and Joan Moseman, along with other members of family, were present for the event.

===Death===
Hayden died in Queensland on 21 October 2023, after a long illness at the age of 90; nine years to the day after Gough Whitlam&#x27;s death. His death was commemorated by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, who announced Hayden would be honoured with a state funeral.

Hayden&#x27;s wife, Dallas, a Member of the Order of Australia, died less than 3 months after her husband, on 15 January 2024.

==Honours==
By virtue of being Governor-General, Hayden was the Chancellor of the Order of Australia and its Principal Companion (AC). In 1999, Latvia awarded him the Order of the Three Stars 3rd Class.

Hayden received an Honorary Doctorate of Laws from the University of Queensland in 1990 for his distinguished contributions to Australian life. Other awards included admission to the Order of St John Australia and also the Gwanghwa Medal of the Korean Order of Diplomatic Merit.

In 1996, Hayden was recognised as the Australian Humanist of the Year by the Council of Australian Humanist Societies. In 2007 at the 45th State Conference of the Queensland Branch of the Australian Labor Party, Hayden was made a Life Member of the party.

In September 2017, in delivering the second Hayden Oration at the University of Southern Queensland in Ipswich, former Australian prime minister Paul Keating spoke at length of Hayden&#x27;s contribution to the Labor Party. Keating spoke, in particular, of the reform period during the Hawke Labor government in the 1980s in Australia. He noted that the foundations for the reforms had been set down before the Labor Party won office in 1983 during the period when Hayden was Leader of the Opposition and was working to prepare the Party for government. &quot;Those great reforms&quot;, Keating said, &quot;began with the frameworks Bill Hayden brought to the front bench, the day he became Leader of the Labor Party.&quot;

<text>The Australian Alps montane grasslands is a montane grassland ecoregion of south-eastern Australia, restricted to the montane regions above 1300 metres (the upper altitudinal limit of &quot;Eucalyptus pauciflora&quot;).
 
==Location and description==
The Australian Alps occupy less than 0.3% of the Australian landmass and run for 600 km from the Brindabella Ranges near Canberra along the borders of the Australian Capital Territory, New South Wales and Victoria almost as far as Melbourne. The highest point is Mount Kosciuszko (2,228 m) in the Snowy Mountains. On the Australian mainland these are the south-eastern section of the country&#x27;s Great Dividing Range while there are also significant elements of montane grassland in Tasmania. These mountain areas are notable in Australia, which is mostly flat and dry, and the Alps receive almost a quarter of the country&#x27;s rainfall and are the water source for almost half of the population. Winters are dark, cold and windy with snow on the ground, with Mount Kosciuszko for example only having 10 frost-free days per year.

On the mainland, the Australian Alps montane grasslands are surrounded at lower elevations by the Southeast Australia temperate forests ecoregion.

==Flora==
The montane grasslands are a mixed habitat of grassland, heath and bog that is home to a rich collection of Alpine and other plants adapted to the cold climate, snow and harsh dry winters. The ecoregion can be sub-categorised in to montane (between 1,100 m and 1,400 m), subalpine (between 1,400 m and 1,850 m), and alpine (normally above 1,850 m) bands. At lower elevations a number of different types of eucalyptus species including mountain ash &quot;&#x27;(Eucalyptus regnans)&quot; grow on the rich soils of the mountain valleys and Alpine Ash (&quot;Eucalyptus delagatensis&quot;) on the slopes. Meanwhile, the trees of the subalpine elevations are snow gum&quot; (Eucalyptus pauciflora)&quot;and black sallee&quot; (Eucalyptus stellulata)&quot; with a ground cover of heath shrubs. The tree line is between 1600 and 1800 m and above that the alpine flora consists predominantly of species of&quot; Poa &quot;(snow grass), usually associated with closed and open shrublands of orites, &quot;Grevillea, Prostanthera&quot;, and &quot;Hovea&quot;. At the highest alpine elevations, these mosaics may give way to a feldmark or, in zones where snow lies into the summer months, to a snow patch community. Sphagnum bog communities of &quot;Sphagnum cristatum&quot; and &quot;Empodisma minus&quot; (spreading rope-rush) occur in stream beds or other low-lying areas.

The occurrence of grasslands represents an ecological climax condition, the culmination of a cycle of colonisation of bare ground by woody shrubs which provide protection for seedlings of grass species. The shrubs senesce after 40 to 50 years, leaving a closed canopy.

==Fauna==
Although this is a harsh environment there is much endemic wildlife in the Alps including the chameleon-like Alpine thermocolour grasshopper (&quot;Kosciuscola tristis&quot;), mountain pygmy possum (&quot;Burramys parvus&quot;) and the corroboree frog (&quot;Pseudophryne corroboree&quot;). One particularly restricted range species is the Baw Baw frog (&quot;Philoria frosti&quot;) which only lives on the Baw Baw Plateau in Victoria. The larger mammals of the lower elevations include red-necked wallaby &quot;(Macropus rufogriseus)&quot;, swamp wallaby &quot;(Wallabia bicolor)&quot;, common wombat &quot;(Vombatus ursinus)&quot;, tiger quoll &quot;(Dasyurus maculatus)&quot;, short-beaked echidna &quot;(Tachyglossus aculeatus)&quot; and platypus &quot;(Ornithorhynchus anatinus)&quot;.

==Threats and preservation==

This ecoregion is generally thought to have experienced long periods of minimal disturbance prior to European settlement. Since the nineteenth century, grazing and an increased incidence of fire resulted in a reduction in range condition, and extensive damage to bog communities, from which plant communities have been slow to recover. Fires have become increasingly common in south-eastern Australia during periods of extended hot, dry weather. Numerous studies indicate that fire frequency and severity are likely to increase in the coming century due to climate change. 

The Alps have long been protected as national parkland in order to preserve the water sources and most of the region is now contained in large contiguous National Parks. These include Brindabella and Namadgi National Park and Bimberi and Scabby Range Nature Reserves near Canberra, Kosciuszko in New South Wales, and Alpine and Snowy River National Parks and the Avon Wilderness Park in Victoria. This parkland which does suffer litter, trampling of wildlife and other damage associated with tourism including the clearance of parkland to create ski resorts.

<text>The President of the National Council of Switzerland (; , ; ) presides over the National Council and Federal Assembly. The National Council President is often colloquially referred to as the &quot;highest Swiss person&quot; (), as the highest ranking person subject to the people&#x27;s vote. However, this is an honorary title and the president is not the head of state; the head of state is the entire Federal Council. In the official order of precedence, she or he ranks behind the members of the Federal Council, but ahead of the President of the Swiss Council of States.

The President of the National Council also chairs the United Federal Assembly which meets to set elections, decides conflicts of jurisdiction between federal authorities and issues pardons. The officeholder is elected by the National Council for a term of one year without the possibility and may not be elected for a second consecutive term, but may be elected to the post in the future.

<text>The Crotaphytidae, or collared lizards, are a family of desert-dwelling reptiles native to the Southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Alternatively they are recognized as a subfamily, Crotaphytinae, within the clade Pleurodonta. They are very fast-moving animals, with long limbs and tails; some species are capable of achieving bipedal running at top speed. This species is carnivorous, feeding mainly on insects and smaller lizards. The two genera contain 12 species.

They may be related to the extinct Arretosauridae of Paleogene Asia due to similar jaw morphologies, though other studies classify the Arretosauridae in Acrodonta with other Old World iguanians.

==Technical characters==
*Femoral pores present
*Interparietal scale small (distinctly smaller than ear opening)
*Never have an enlarged middorsal scale row or fringe
*Never have a divided rostral scale
*No bony spines or projecting ridges on their heads
*No scales projecting over their ears, and no scales forming a prominent fringe on sides of toes as in Phrynosomatidae

==Species==
&quot;Nota bene&quot;: A binomial authority in parentheses indicates that the species was originally described in different genus.

<text>Sir John Ross (24 June 1777 – 30 August 1856) was a Scottish Royal Navy officer and polar explorer. He was the uncle of Sir James Clark Ross, who explored the Arctic with him, and later led expeditions to Antarctica.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
John Ross was born in Balsarroch, West Galloway, Scotland, on , the son of the Reverend Andrew Ross of Balsarroch, Minister of Inch in Wigtownshire, and Elizabeth Corsane, daughter of Robert Corsane, the Provost of Dumfries. His family home was on the shore of Loch Ryan, at Stranraer.

=== Naval career ===
In 1786, aged nine, Ross joined the Royal Navy as a first-class volunteer and was assigned to . It soon sailed to the Mediterranean Sea, where it remained until 1789. He then served aboard for several months before a transfer to the merchant marine for eight years. In September 1799 he was recalled to the Navy and appointed midshipman on HMS &quot;Weazel&quot;, which shortly joined in the Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland.

Short periods of service on and followed, during which he acted as a lieutenant.

From 1803, he served on various vessels; mainly with the Baltic station. This included a period on and , the flagship of the commander of the Baltic fleet, Rear Admiral James Saumarez. During his service, Ross was wounded several times, the most severe of these being in 1806 when boarding a Spanish vessel; he received wounds inflicted by a sabre and bayonet, and also suffered broken legs and a broken arm. In late 1808, Ross was seconded to the Swedish Navy. In 1812, he was promoted to commander.

=== Arctic expeditions ===

==== 1818: First Arctic expedition ====
In 1818, Ross received the command of an Arctic expedition organised by the British Admiralty, the first of a new series of attempts to answer the question of a North West Passage. This entailed going around the extreme north-east coast of America and sailing to the Bering Strait. He was also to note the currents, tides, the state of ice and magnetism and to collect specimens he found on the way.

The expedition left London in April, with Ross commanding , a vessel that the Admiralty had hired, and accompanied by , another hired vessel, under Lieutenant William Edward Parry. Ross sailed anti-clockwise around Baffin Bay repeating the observations made by William Baffin two hundred years before. In August, he entered Lancaster Sound at the north end of Baffin Island; this later proved to be the eastern gate of the Northwest Passage. He sailed a number of miles west but went no further, for he was misled by a mirage that appeared to show mountains at the end of the strait. He named the apparent mountains &quot;Croker Mountains&quot;, in honour of John Wilson Croker, then first secretary of the Admiralty. He then returned to England despite the protests of several of his officers, including Parry and Edward Sabine, who thought he should have more thoroughly examined the &quot;mountains&quot;.

The account of his voyage published a year later, brought to light their disagreement, and the ensuing controversy over the existence of Croker Mountains ruined his reputation. This expedition failed to discover much that was new. Its main effect was to open a route for whale ships to the northern Baffin Bay and provoke Parry to re-explore Lancaster Sound and find a major portion of the North West Passage. Ross attained the rank of captain on his return to Scotland, and about this time built the house North West Castle, in Stranraer, south-west Scotland.

==== 1829: Second Arctic expedition ====

Parry, his lieutenant on the previous expedition, returned to the Arctic in 1819, and sailed west beyond the &quot;Croker Hills&quot;, thereby discovering the Parry Channel – the main axis of the North West Passage. Partly to redeem his reputation, Ross proposed to use a shallow-draft steamship to break through the ice. The Admiralty was not interested, but he was able to convince the gin magnate Felix Booth to finance this second Arctic expedition, which began in 1829. His ship was the &quot;Victory&quot;, a side-wheel steamer with paddles that could be lifted away from the ice and an experimental high-pressure boiler built by John Ericsson. The &quot;Victory&quot; had been built in 1826 and previously had served as a ferry between Liverpool and the Isle of Man. The engine caused trouble and during the first winter, it was dumped on the shore. The ship carried four officers – John Ross, James Clark Ross, William Thom, surgeon George McDiarmid – and 19 men. The goal was Prince Regent Inlet at the west end of Baffin Island where Parry had lost his ship, the &quot;Fury&quot;, in 1825.

Ross left the Thames on 23 May 1829. Baffin Bay was unusually ice-free and on 6 August, he passed the point where he had turned back 10 years before. On 11 August, he turned south into Prince Regent Inlet, and on 13 August, reached Fury Beach, where Parry had abandoned his ship. The hulk was gone but there were heaps of stores on the beach, some of which he took. Continuing south he became the first European in the Gulf of Boothia, but by the end of September, he was blocked by ice south of Fury Beach. He took winter quarters at Felix Harbour at the eastern tip of the Boothia Peninsula. In January 1830, a group of Netsilik Inuit arrived and provided food and information. For one of them, the ship&#x27;s carpenter made a wooden leg.

In the spring of 1830, James Clark Ross made several trips west into the interior. On 9 April, he reached the west side of the Boothia Peninsula and in May crossed over ice to the north west shore of King William Island, assuming it was part of the mainland. It was mid-September before the ice broke part of its grip. The crew sawed through the shore ice and warped the ship into open water, but it was soon caught in the ice. October was spent warping and sawing the ship into Sheriff Bay where they spent their second winter only from Felix Harbour. No Inuit arrived until the following April 1831. James Clark Ross crossed the Boothia Peninsula, and, on 1 June 1831, became the first European to reach the North Magnetic Pole. In August, the ship began to move but only managed to travel before it got trapped in Victoria Harbour. By January 1832, it was clear that the ship would never get out. Ross&#x27;s plan was to drag the ship&#x27;s boats north to Fury Beach, collect provisions there, find open water and hope to be rescued by a whaler.
They left &quot;Victory&quot; on 29 May 1832. Ten days later, James Clark Ross returned from Fury Beach and reported that &quot;Fury&quot;″s boats were repairable, which spared them the labour of dragging the boats. They reached Fury Beach on 1 July, left in three boats on 1 August, and reached Barrow Strait at the end of August. Finding an unbroken field of ice, they waited four weeks for the ice to melt, gave up, returned south, left their boats at Batty Bay, and walked to Fury Beach. On 8 July 1833, they left for Batty Bay and on 14 August, saw open water for the first time. They left the next day and reached the head of Prince Regent Inlet. On 26 August, they spotted a ship but it passed by. A few hours later, they were seen by another ship, which turned out to be &quot;Isabella&quot; which he had commanded in 1819. Had it not been for his 1819 discovery there would have been no whalers in the area. By October they were back in England.

The expedition had cost three lives. Ross was presented to King William IV and given a knighthood. The crew were given double pay for the entire four years by the Admiralty even though they were not in the Royal Navy. This impressive experience, as well as the scientific and ethnological information gathered by Ross&#x27;s team, brought him the renown that he had long sought. In comparison with other contemporary arctic explorers, this was a feat of heroic proportions and was probably due to the fact that Ross befriended and learned from the Inuit.

Once again, however, Ross encountered controversy with his cartography. In 1830, during the expedition, James Clark Ross had charted three islands in James Ross Strait and named them the Beaufort Islands. John Ross never saw the islands. Later, back in England, John Ross, using his authority as expedition leader, renamed the islands as the Clarence Islands, and even added a number of fictional islands to the group, in an apparent attempt to impress the new king, William IV. In 1833, Ross received the Royal Premium from the Royal Geographical Society and a gold medal from the French geographical society, and various foreign orders, including Knight of the Royal Order of the Polar Star of Sweden, and in the following year, received a knighthood and was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in Britain. He was appointed as British consul at Stockholm in 1839, and remained at this post until 1846.

==== 1850: Final Arctic expedition ====

In 1850, at the age of 72, Ross undertook a third voyage to the Arctic regions, this time in search of the expedition party of Sir John Franklin which had not been heard from for four years. With financial support from HBC, he sailed a private vessel, the schooner &quot;Felix&quot;, to Lancaster Sound. His vessel was not particularly robust and other ships in the area had to provide food to help Ross combat scurvy which had set in amongst his crew.

Failing to find Franklin or any of his men, Ross returned to England in October 1851 by way of Greenland, where he encountered rumours that Franklin and his party were all dead. Although most people disregarded these, Ross stood by them.

=== Later life ===
While he had been searching for Franklin, Ross was promoted to rear admiral. Retiring to Stranraer, Scotland, he never sailed again. His knowledge of the Swedish and Danish languages saw him consulting for the government about the Baltic regions as tensions with Russia increased and his later years were spent writing. He published several pamphlets, including one critical of the efforts to rescue Franklin.

He also futilely hoped for a reconciliation with his wife and pestered the Admiralty on various matters, one being the quality of its maps. He died on while visiting London, where he is buried at Kensal Green Cemetery.

<text>The Opluridae, or Madagascan iguanas, are a family of moderately-sized lizards native to Madagascar and Grande Comore. There are eight species across two genera, with most of them being under &quot;Oplurus&quot;. The other genus, &quot;Chalarodon&quot;, is easily distinguishable from Oplurus as it contains species with a dorsal crest, particularly distinct in males, and has a smoother tail covered in similarly sized scales. Genus &quot;Oplurus&quot; has large segmented spiny scales, and no dorsal crest along the spine. 

The Opluridae, along with the banded iguanas and their kin (family Iguanidae) of Fiji, are the only extant members of the Pleurodonta that are found outside of the Americas. The Opluridae family includes terrestrial species that live amongst rocks and canyons, along with some that are arboreal, and two that prefer sandier habitats. All of the species are oviparous, or egg-layers, and have teeth that resemble those of the true iguanas. A study to identify the primary foraging methods of the &quot;Oplurus&quot; genus indicated that ambush hunting was preferred due to the reptiles&#x27; low movement-per-minute (MPM) and percent-time-spent-moving (PTM) rates, especially during the very rainy and very dry seasons of the Ampijoroa Forest and Ankarafantsika.

Previously, due to their physical isolation from all other iguanids, it was thought that oplurids had very ancient/basal origins; a study of mitochondrial DNA sequences had put the split between Opluridae and Iguanidae—within which Opluridae is occasionally classified as subfamily Oplurinae—at about 165 million years ago (MYA), during the Middle Jurassic. This study supported the monophyly of the expanded Iguanidae, thus placing Oplurinae in the basal position—consistent with a vicariant origin of the Madagascan iguanians, as Madagascar is believed to have separated from Africa some 140 MYA during the breakup of Gondwana. However, a 2022 study found Opluridae to be the sister group to the Leiosauridae, a family of iguanids found only in South America. Both groups were found to have only diverged during the Paleocene, about 60 MYA. As this divergence was too recent to be a result of vicariance, it was proposed that the Opluridae colonized Madagascar via oceanic dispersal, floating on uprooted trees, shrubbery and other amalgamated natural objects directly to Madagascar from South America. Alternate theories see the reptiles reaching mainland Africa first, before later making their way to Madagascar, or floating from South America to Madagascar with Antarctica as a stopping-point (as the continent was not yet glaciated at the time).

<text>Willapa Bay () is a bay located on the southwest Pacific coast of Washington state in the United States. The Long Beach Peninsula separates Willapa Bay from the greater expanse of the Pacific Ocean. With over of surface area Willapa Bay is the second-largest riverine estuary on the Pacific coast of the continental United States. Early settlers called the bay Shoalwater Bay and this name is found on old maps and charts of the region.

Willapa Bay is fairly shallow: more than half of its surface area lies in the intertidal zone, and half of the volume of water inside it enters and leaves with every tide. The bay is an estuary formed when the Long Beach Peninsula, a long sand spit from the Columbia River to the south, partially enclosed the estuaries of several smaller rivers. It is a ria, which formed after the rise in sea level at the end of the last ice age flooded several small river valleys. The North River, Willapa River, and Naselle River provide most of the freshwater input into the bay. Other rivers that empty into Willapa Bay include the Bone River, Niawiakum River, Palix River, Cedar River and Bear River, among others.

The bay is bordered by several smaller towns and unincorporated communities such as Raymond and South Bend, both on the Willapa River; Oysterville, Nahcotta, Bay Center and Tokeland are on the bay itself. The bay is entirely located within Pacific County, Washington and is home to a local oyster and seafood processing industry: approximately 9% of all oysters in the U.S. are grown there.

Willapa Bay is known for its biodiversity and much of it, including the entirety of Long Island, has been set aside as part of the Willapa National Wildlife Refuge. The oyster beds help the ecosystem by providing habitats and filtering water, improving the quality of the water. The bay&#x27;s ecology was threatened in the 1990s by the rapid spreading of Atlantic cordgrass (&quot;Spartina alterniflora&quot;), a non-native species of grass introduced possibly to help preserve wetlands and marsh areas, and possibly simply by accident as packing material in crates of oysters from the East Coast. The State of Washington has been spraying an herbicide thought not to threaten other species since about 2005, and the &quot;Spartina&quot; threat is much reduced.

<text>The Phrynosomatidae are a diverse family of lizards, sometimes classified as a subfamily (Phrynosomatinae), found from Panama to the extreme south of Canada. Many members of the group are adapted to life in hot, sandy deserts, although the spiny lizards prefer rocky deserts or even relatively moist forest edges, and the short-horned lizard lives in prairie or sagebrush environments. The group includes both egg-laying and viviparous species, with the latter being more common in species living at high elevations.

The earliest fossil remains of this group are known from the Late Cretaceous of Mongolia and belong to the genus &quot;Desertiguana&quot;. As phrynosomatids are only known from North America, these remains indicate that phrynosomatids likely had a wider distribution in prehistoric times.

==Genera==
The Phrynosomatidae are organised into nine genera.

The earless taxa (&quot;Cophosaurus&quot; and &quot;Holbrookia&quot;) are sister genera.

Family Phrynosomatidae
* &quot;Callisaurus&quot; – zebra-tailed lizards
* &quot;Cophosaurus&quot; – greater earless lizards
* &quot;Holbrookia&quot; – earless lizards
* &quot;Petrosaurus&quot; – California rock lizards
* &quot;Phrynosoma&quot; – horned lizards 
* &quot;Sceloporus&quot; – spiny lizards (or sator)
* &quot;Uma&quot; – fringe-toed lizards 
* &quot;Urosaurus&quot; – tree and brush lizards
* &quot;Uta&quot; – side-blotched lizards
