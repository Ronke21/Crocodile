<text>Habitat conservation is a management practice that seeks to conserve, protect and restore habitats and prevent species extinction, fragmentation or reduction in range. It is a priority of many groups that cannot be easily characterized in terms of any one ideology.

==History of the conservation movement==
For much of human history, &quot;nature&quot; was seen as a resource that could be controlled by the government and used for personal and economic gain. The idea was that plants only existed to feed animals and animals only existed to feed humans. The value of land was limited only to the resources it provided such as fertile soil, timber, and minerals.

Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, social views started to change and conservation principles were first practically applied to the forests of British India. The conservation ethic that began to evolve included three core principles: 1) human activities damage the environment, 2) there was a civic duty to maintain the environment for future generations, and 3) scientific, empirically-based methods should be applied to ensure this duty was carried out. Sir James Ranald Martin was prominent in promoting this ideology, publishing numerous medico-topographical reports that demonstrated the damage from large-scale deforestation and desiccation, and lobbying extensively for the institutionalization of forest conservation activities in British India through the establishment of Forest Departments.

The Madras Board of Revenue started local conservation efforts in 1842, headed by Alexander Gibson, a professional botanist who systematically adopted a forest conservation program based on scientific principles. This was the first case of state conservation management of forests in the world. Governor-General Lord Dalhousie introduced the first permanent and large-scale forest conservation program in 1855, a model that soon spread to other colonies, as well to the United States, where Yellowstone National Park was opened in 1872 as the world&#x27;s first national park.

Rather than focusing on the economic or material benefits from nature, humans began to appreciate the value of nature itself and the need to protect it. By the mid-20th century, countries such as the United States, Canada, and Britain instigated laws and legislation in order to ensure that the most fragile and beautiful environments would be protected for posterity. 
Today, with the help of NGO&#x27;s and governments worldwide, a strong movement is mobilizing with the goal of protecting habitats and preserving biodiversity on a global scale. The commitments and actions of small volunteer associations in villages and towns, that endeavour to emulate the work of well known conservation organisations, are paramount in ensuring generations that follow understand the importance of natural resource conservation.

== Values of natural habitat ==
Natural habitats can provide Ecosystem services to humans, which are &quot;any positive benefit that wildlife or ecosystems provide to people.&quot; The natural environment is a source for a wide range of resources that can be exploited for economic profit, for example timber is harvested from forests and clean water is obtained from natural streams. However, land development from anthropogenic economic growth often causes a decline in the ecological integrity of nearby natural habitat. For instance, this was an issue in the northern Rocky Mountains of the US.

However, there is also the economic value in conserving natural habitats. Financial profit can be made from tourist revenue, for example in the tropics where species diversity is high, or in recreational sports which take place in natural environments such as hiking and mountain biking. The cost of repairing damaged ecosystems is considered to be much higher than the cost of conserving natural ecosystems.

Measuring the worth of conserving different habitat areas is often criticized as being too utilitarian from a philosophical point of view.

== Biodiversity ==
Habitat conservation is important in maintaining biodiversity, which refers to the variability in populations, organisms, and gene pools, as well as habitats and ecosystems. Biodiversity is also an essential part of global food security. There is evidence to support a trend of accelerating erosion of the genetic resources of agricultural plants and animals. An increase in genetic similarity of agricultural plants and animals means an increased risk of food loss from major epidemics. Wild species of agricultural plants have been found to be more resistant to disease, for example the wild corn species Teosinte is resistant to 4 corn diseases that affect human grown crops. A combination of seed banking and habitat conservation has been proposed to maintain plant diversity for food security purposes. It has been shown that focusing conversation efforts on ecosystems &quot;within multiple trophic levels&quot; can lead to a better functioning ecosystem with more biomass.

== Classifying environmental values ==
Pearce and Moran outlined the following method for classifying environmental uses:
* Direct extractive uses: e.g. timber from forests, food from plants and animals
* Indirect uses: e.g. ecosystem services like flood control, pest control, erosion protection
* Optional uses: future possibilities e.g. unknown but potential use of plants in chemistry/medicine
* Non-use values:
**Bequest value (benefit of an individual who knows that others may benefit from it in future)
**Passive use value (sympathy for natural environment, enjoyment of the mere existence of a particular species)

== Impacts ==

=== Natural causes ===
Habitat loss and destruction can occur both naturally and through anthropogenic causes. Events leading to natural habitat loss include climate change, catastrophic events such as volcanic explosions and through the interactions of invasive and non-invasive species. Natural climate change, events have previously been the cause of many widespread and large scale losses in habitat. For example, some of the mass extinction events generally referred to as the &quot;Big Five&quot; have coincided with large scale such as the Earth entering an ice age, or alternate warming events. Other events in the big five also have their roots in natural causes, such as volcanic explosions and meteor collisions. The Chicxulub impact is one such example, which has previously caused widespread losses in habitat as the Earth either received less sunlight or grew colder, causing certain fauna and flora to flourish whilst others perished. Previously known warm areas in the tropics, the most sensitive habitats on Earth, grew colder, and areas such as Australia developed radically different flora and fauna to those seen today. The big five mass extinction events have also been linked to sea level changes, indicating that large scale marine species loss was strongly influenced by loss in marine habitats, particularly shelf habitats. Methane-driven oceanic eruptions have also been shown to have caused smaller mass extinction events.

=== Human impacts ===
Humans have been the cause of many species’ extinction. Due to humans’ changing and modifying their environment, the habitat of other species often become altered or destroyed as a result of human actions. The altering of habitats will cause habitat fragmentation, reducing the species&#x27; habitat and decreasing their dispersal range. This increases species isolation which then causes their population to decline. Even before the modern industrial era, humans were having widespread, and major effects on the environment. A good example of this is found in Aboriginal Australians and Australian megafauna. Aboriginal hunting practices, which included burning large sections of forest at a time, eventually altered and changed Australia&#x27;s vegetation so much that many herbivorous megafauna species were left with no habitat and were driven into extinction. Once herbivorous megafauna species became extinct, carnivorous megafauna species soon followed.
In the recent past, humans have been responsible for causing more extinctions within a given period of time than ever before. Deforestation, pollution, anthropogenic climate change and human settlements have all been driving forces in altering or destroying habitats. The destruction of ecosystems such as rainforests has resulted in countless habitats being destroyed. These biodiversity hotspots are home to millions of habitat specialists, which do not exist beyond a tiny area. Once their habitat is destroyed, they cease to exist. This destruction has a follow-on effect, as species which coexist or depend upon the existence of other species also become extinct, eventually resulting in the collapse of an entire ecosystem. These time-delayed extinctions are referred to as the extinction debt, which is the result of destroying and fragmenting habitats.
As a result of anthropogenic modification of the environment, the extinction rate has climbed to the point where the Earth is now within a sixth mass extinction event, as commonly agreed by biologists. This has been particularly evident, for example, in the rapid decline in the number of amphibian species worldwide.

== Approaches and methods of habitat conservation ==
Adaptive management addresses the challenge of scientific uncertainty in habitat conservation plans by systematically gathering and applying reliable information to enhance conservation strategies over time. This approach allows for adjustments in management practices based on new insights, making conservation efforts more effective. Determining the size, type and location of habitat to conserve is a complex area of conservation biology. Although difficult to measure and predict, the conservation value of a habitat is often a reflection of the quality (e.g. species abundance and diversity), endangerment of encompassing ecosystems, and spatial distribution of that habitat.

== Habitat Restoration ==
Habitat restoration is a subset of habitat conservation and its goals include improving the habitat and resources ranging from one species to several species The Society for Ecological Restoration&#x27;s International Science and Policy Working Group define restoration as &quot;the process of assisting the recovery of an ecosystem that has been degraded, damaged, or destroyed.&quot; The scale of habitat restoration efforts can range from small to large areas of land depending on the goal of the project. Elements of habitat restoration include developing a plan and embedding goals within that plan, and monitoring and evaluating species. Considerations such as the species type, environment, and context are aspects of planning a habitat restoration project. Efforts to restore habitats that have been altered by anthropogenic activities has become a global endeavor, and is used to counteract the effects of habitat destruction by humans. Miller and Hobbs state three constraints on restoration: &quot;ecological, economic, and social&quot; constraints. Habitat restoration projects include Marine Debris Mitigation for Navassa Island National Wildlife Refuge in Haiti and Lemon Bay Preserve Habitat Restoration in Florida.

== Identifying priority habitats for conservation ==
Habitat conservation is vital for protecting species and ecological processes. It is important to conserve and protect the space/ area in which that species occupies. Therefore, areas classified as ‘biodiversity hotspots’, or those in which a flagship, umbrella, or endangered species inhabits are often the habitats that are given precedence over others. Species that possess an elevated risk of extinction are given the highest priority and as a result of conserving their habitat, other species in that community are protected thus serving as an element of gap analysis. In the United States of America, a Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP) is often developed to conserve the environment in which a specific species inhabits. Under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) the habitat that requires protection in an HCP is referred to as the ‘critical habitat’. Multiple-species HCPs are becoming more favourable than single-species HCPs as they can potentially protect an array of species before they warrant listing under the ESA, as well as being able to conserve broad ecosystem components and processes . As of January 2007, 484 HCPs were permitted across the United States, 40 of which covered 10 or more species. The San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan (MSCP) encompasses 85 species in a total area of 26,000-km2. Its aim is to protect the habitats of multiple species and overall biodiversity by minimizing development in sensitive areas.

HCPs require clearly defined goals and objectives, efficient monitoring programs, as well as successful communication and collaboration with stakeholders and land owners in the area. Reserve design is also important and requires a high level of planning and management in order to achieve the goals of the HCP. Successful reserve design often takes the form of a hierarchical system with the most valued habitats requiring high protection being surrounded by buffer habitats that have a lower protection status. Like HCPs, hierarchical reserve design is a method most often used to protect a single species, and as a result habitat corridors are maintained, edge effects are reduced and a broader suite of species are protected.

== How much habitat is needed ==
A range of methods and models currently exist that can be used to determine how much habitat is to be conserved in order to sustain a viable population, including Resource Selection Function and Step Selection models. Modelling tools often rely on the spatial scale of the area as an indicator of conservation value. There has been an increase in emphasis on conserving few large areas of habitat as opposed to many small areas. This idea is often referred to as the &quot;single large or several small&quot;, SLOSS debate, and is a highly controversial area among conservation biologists and ecologists. The reasons behind the argument that &quot;larger is better&quot; include the reduction in the negative impacts of patch edge effects, the general idea that species richness increases with habitat area and the ability of larger habitats to support greater populations with lower extinction probabilities. Noss &amp; Cooperrider support the &quot;larger is better&quot; claim and developed a model that implies areas of habitat less than 1000ha are &quot;tiny&quot; and of low conservation value. However, Shwartz suggests that although &quot;larger is better&quot;, this does not imply that &quot;small is bad&quot;. Shwartz argues that human induced habitat loss leaves no alternative to conserving small areas. Furthermore, he suggests many endangered species which are of high conservation value, may only be restricted to small isolated patches of habitat, and thus would be overlooked if larger areas were given a higher priority. The shift to conserving larger areas is somewhat justified in society by placing more value on larger vertebrate species, which naturally have larger habitat requirements.

== Examples of current conservation organizations ==

=== The Nature Conservancy ===
Since its formation in 1951 The Nature Conservancy has slowly developed into one of the world&#x27;s largest conservation organizations. Currently operating in over 30 countries, across five continents worldwide, The Nature Conservancy aims to protect nature and its assets for future generations. The organization purchases land or accepts land donations with the intention of conserving its natural resources. In 1955 The Nature Conservancy purchased its first 60-acre plot near the New York/Connecticut border in the United States of America. Today the Conservancy has expanded to protect over 119 million acres of land, 5,000 river miles as well as participating in over 1,000 marine protection programs across the globe .
Since its beginnings The Nature Conservancy has understood the benefit in taking a scientific approach towards habitat conservation. For the last decade the organization has been using a collaborative, scientific method known as &quot;Conservation by Design.&quot; By collecting and analyzing scientific data The Conservancy is able to holistically approach the protection of various ecosystems. This process determines the habitats that need protection, specific elements that should be conserved as well as monitoring progress so more efficient practices can be developed for the future.

The Nature Conservancy currently has a large number of diverse projects in operation. They work with countries around the world to protect forests, river systems, oceans, deserts and grasslands. In all cases the aim is to provide a sustainable environment for both the plant and animal life forms that depend on them as well as all future generations to come.

=== World Wildlife Fund (WWF) ===
The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) was first formed in after a group of passionate conservationists signed what is now referred to as the Morges Manifesto. WWF is currently operating in over 100 countries across 5 continents with a current listing of over 5 million supporters. 
One of the first projects of WWF was assisting in the creation of the Charles Darwin Research Foundation which aided in the protection of diverse range of unique species existing on the Galápagos’ Islands, Ecuador. It was also a WWF grant that helped with the formation of the College of African Wildlife Management in Tanzania which today focuses on teaching a wide range of protected area management skills in areas such as ecology, range management and law enforcement.
The WWF has since gone on to aid in the protection of land in Spain, creating the Coto Doñana National Park in order to conserve migratory birds and The Democratic Republic of Congo, home to the world&#x27;s largest protected wetlands. The WWF also initiated a debt-for-nature concept which allows the country to put funds normally allocated to paying off national debt, into conservation programs that protect its natural landscapes. Countries currently participating include Madagascar, the first country to participate which since 1989 has generated over $US50 million towards preservation, Bolivia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Gabon, the Philippines and Zambia.

=== Rare Conservation ===
Rare has been in operation since 1973 with current global partners in over 50 countries and offices in the United States of America, Mexico, the Philippines, China and Indonesia. Rare focuses on the human activity that threatens biodiversity and habitats such as overfishing and unsustainable agriculture. By engaging local communities and changing behaviour Rare has been able to launch campaigns to protect areas in most need of conservation.
The key aspect of Rare&#x27;s methodology is their &quot;Pride Campaigns&quot;. For example, in the Andes in South America, Rare has incentives to develop watershed protection practices. In the Southeast Asia&#x27;s &quot;coral triangle&quot; Rare is training fishers in local communities to better manage the areas around the coral reefs in order to lessen human impact. Such programs last for three years with the aim of changing community attitudes so as to conserve fragile habitats and provide ecological protection for years to come.

=== WWF Netherlands ===
WWF Netherlands, along with ARK Nature, Wild Wonders of Europe, and Conservation Capital have started the Rewilding Europe project. This project intents to rewild several areas in Europe.

<text>Fairfield is a town in Utah County, Utah, United States. It is part of the Provo–Orem, Utah Metropolitan Statistical Area. It is located in the southwest corner of Cedar Valley about southwest of Salt Lake City and south of Cedar Fort on Utah State Route 73, west of Utah Lake. The population was 119 at the 2010 census.

==History==

The town was founded in 1855 when John Carson, his four brothers, and others settled in the Cedar Valley. The settlement was soon known as Frogtown. The population ballooned after the arrival of Johnston&#x27;s Army in 1858-59, sent to Utah to suppress the rumored rebellion there. The army established a nearby camp called Camp Floyd, and the population grew to over 7,000, including 3,500 troops (nearly one-third of the entire U.S. Army at that time), teamsters, gamblers, and camp followers of various persuasions. With no rebellion taking place, the troops were recalled in 1861 and sent east to fight for the Union with the outbreak of the Civil War.

Frogtown became Fairfield in 1861, named after Amos Fielding, who had participated in establishing the community.

The Stagecoach Inn, located in Fairfield and now a museum, was used by travelers passing through via stagecoach, military personnel, and riders on the Pony Express trail.

Fairfield was incorporated in 2004 due to concerns about growth from surrounding communities. Besides agriculture, the town is a destination for Camp Floyd tourists and home to a large construction landfill.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2010, 119 people lived in the town. There were 41 housing units. The racial makeup was 95.8% White, 1.7% from some other race, and 2.5% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 4.2% of the population.

==Climate==
Fairfield has a continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;) bordering a semi-arid climate (&quot;BSk&quot;).

<text>Christopher Papazoglou (born 25 January 1950), known professionally as Christopher Ryan, is a British actor best known for his roles as Mike The Cool Person in the BBC comedy series &quot;The Young Ones&quot;, Dave Hedgehog in the BBC comedy series &quot;Bottom&quot;, Tony Driscoll in the BBC comedy series &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot;, and as Edina Monsoon&#x27;s ex-husband Marshall Turtle in the BBC sitcom &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot;. He has also appeared as the McKendrick twins in &quot;One Foot in the Grave&quot;, and in Doctor Who played the Mentor Kiv in Trial of a Time Lord in 1986 and Sontaran General Staal in 2008 and 2010.

==Early life==
Ryan was born Christopher Papazoglou in Bayswater, London to an English mother and a Greek father. He trained at East 15 Acting School from 1968 to 1971, then began his professional acting career with Glasgow Citizens&#x27; Theatre.

==Career==
===&quot;The Young Ones&quot;===
Ryan was the only &quot;Young Ones&quot; cast member who was not already well known in British comedy circles, the other principal parts being taken by The Comic Strip members Rik Mayall, Adrian Edmondson, Nigel Planer, and Alexei Sayle. He was a last-minute replacement for Peter Richardson, for whom the &quot;straight man&quot; role of &quot;Mike The Cool Person&quot; was originally intended.

In 1986, Ryan reunited with the rest of the cast for the comedic charity single and music video for Cliff Richard&#x27;s hit song &quot;Living Doll&quot;, with Richard himself, for Comic Relief.

===Later career===
In 1987, he starred in the short-lived BBC sitcom &quot;A Small Problem&quot;. He played Lucky in Samuel Beckett&#x27;s &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; at the Queen&#x27;s Theatre in the West End in 1991, alongside Mayall and Edmondson. He later played Dave Hedgehog in &quot;Bottom&quot;, and Marshall Turtle, one of Edina&#x27;s unloved ex-husbands, on &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot;. He has also appeared in two major sitcoms: he played one of the Driscoll brothers in an episode of &quot;Only Fools And Horses&quot; and spin-off &quot;The Green Green Grass&quot;, a pair of identical twin builders in the &quot;One Foot in the Grave&quot; episode &quot;Hole in the Sky&quot;, and a plumber in the episode &quot;The Valley of Fear&quot;. He appeared in &quot;Back to School Mr. Bean&quot;, &quot;My Family&quot; and &quot;Saxondale.&quot; He joined up again with Jennifer Saunders for two episodes of &quot;The Life and Times of Vivienne Vyle&quot;.

In 1986, he appeared in the science fiction series &quot;Doctor Who&quot; as the alien creature Lord Kiv in the serial &quot;The Trial of a Time Lord&quot;, and as one of the rose-painting playing cards in the 1999 TV version of &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;. In 2008, he again guest-starred in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; in the episodes &quot;The Sontaran Stratagem&quot; and &quot;The Poison Sky&quot;, as the Sontaran leader &quot;General Staal&quot;, and in the 2010 episode &quot;The Pandorica Opens&quot;, playing another Sontaran character, &quot;Commander Stark&quot;. In 2012 he appeared in the role of Marshall in Episode 3 &quot;Olympics&quot; of the &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot; 20th-anniversary specials.

Although so far his film appearances have been few, he has played small roles in &quot;Santa Claus: The Movie&quot; (1985) playing Vout the elf, and in the film &quot;Dirty Weekend&quot; (1993), directed by Michael Winner playing a character credited as Small One.

Ryan starred as Baron Hardup in the pantomime of Cinderella at the Theatre Royal, Norwich from 17 December 2013 to 19 January 2014.

<doc id="320041" wikidata="Q5027175" url="?curid=320041" title="Camp Floyd State Park Museum">
<text>Camp Floyd State Park Museum (formerly known as Camp Floyd / Stagecoach Inn State Park and Museum) is a state park in the Cedar Valley in Fairfield, Utah, United States. The park includes a small part of the former Camp Floyd site, the Stagecoach Inn, and the Fairfield District School.

==Description==
The park headquarters are located at 69 West Main Street (at the Stagecoach Inn), with all areas of the park less than away. The park consists of Camp Floyd (including the Camp Floyd Cemetery), Fairfield District School, and the Stagecoach Inn. All three components are listed separately on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).

The heritage park reflects the settlement of Utah and its resolution of ongoing conflicts with the federal government. It is open Monday through Saturday from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., year round, and from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. on Sundays during the summer (from Memorial Day through Labor Day). While open most holidays, it is closed on Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year&#x27;s Day.

==History==
The Carson family donated the Stagecoach Inn to the state government on January 29, 1958, with the understanding that the Utah State Park and Recreation Commission would restore the building for use as a museum. The state also acquired the Walker Brothers&#x27; commissary building and post cemetery. By the 1950s, the commissary building was in ruins, with the locals having dismantled parts of it (the roof was gone by 1948).

The renovated cemetery was dedicated on June 11, 1960. The renovation and restoration of both the inn and commissary were completed in the summer of 1960, but the park was not officially dedicated and opened until May 16, 1964.

==Camp Floyd==

Established in July 1858 by a U.S. Army detachment under the command of Brevet Brig. Gen. Albert Sidney Johnston, Camp Floyd was named for then Secretary of War John B. Floyd. The detachment consisted of more than 3,500 military and civilian employees, including cavalry, artillery, infantry and support units. This unit, the largest single troop concentration then in the United States, was sent by President James Buchanan to stop a perceived Mormon rebellion, which came to be known as the Utah War.

From Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, the army marched to Fort Bridger, Wyoming where it spent the winter of 1857. Troops arrived in Salt Lake City, Utah in June 1858. Soon after their arrival, troops settled in the Cedar Valley area and eventually Fairfield, where 400 buildings were constructed by November 1858. A series of photographs of Camp Floyd, taken by Samuel C. Mills in January 1859, show the post as a cluster of adobe buildings including barracks, officers quarters, warehouses and other sundry structures. Enough civilians soon followed to increase the town size to 7000, almost half that of Salt Lake City. The rebellion never took place, leaving the army with routine garrison duty that included protecting the stagecoach and Pony Express routes, preventing Indian marauding, and mapping and surveying responsibilities.

Supplying the large garrison, from Fort Leavenworth, was costly. It was rumored to be an attempt by Secretary of War Floyd (a known southern sympathizer) to drain the federal treasury. A contract with the firm of Russell, Majors and Waddell for delivery of of freight required 3,500 wagons, 40,000 oxen, 1,000 mules and more than 4,000 men. This same company formed the Pony Express, which had a station in Fairfield.

After Secretary of War Floyd resigned on Dec. 29, 1860 (becoming a Confederate), Camp Floyd was renamed Fort Crittenden, after Kentucky&#x27;s Senator John J Crittenden, who worked to prevent Kentucky&#x27;s secession from the Union. Camp Floyd/Crittenden was abandoned in July 1861 with the garrison being called east for the American Civil War. Equipment and buildings were sold, destroyed or transported. All that remain today are the military cemetery and one commissary building. Two months after the army&#x27;s departure, only 18 families remained in Fairfield.

A area was listed on the NRHP as Camp Floyd Site November 11, 1974. The only vestige of the post in 1974 was a cemetery.

==Fairfield District School==
The Fairfield District School is a historic schoolhouse that was built in 1898, that was added to the NRHP August 6, 1987. It is located at 59 North Church Street.

==Stagecoach Inn==
The Stagecoach Inn has also been known as John Carson House. It served as a hotel and as a stop on the overland stagecoach until the transcontinental railroad opened in 1869. It was the first stop south of Salt Lake City on the overland route. During 1860–1861 the inn was also a Pony Express stop. The area immediately surrounding is also known as the Stage Coach Inn State Historical Site. It was added to the NRHP May 14, 1971.

<text>The Catalan Countries (, ) are those territories where the Catalan language is spoken. They include the Spanish regions of Catalonia, the Balearic Islands, Valencian Community, and parts of Aragon (&quot;La Franja&quot;) and Murcia (Carche), as well as the Principality of Andorra, the department of Pyrénées-Orientales (aka Northern Catalonia, including Cerdagne, Roussillon, and Vallespir) in France, and the city of Alghero in Sardinia (Italy). It is often used as a sociolinguistic term to describe the cultural-linguistic area where Catalan is spoken. In the context of Catalan nationalism, the term is sometimes used in a more restricted way to refer to just Catalonia, Valencia and the Balearic Islands. The Catalan Countries do not correspond to any present or past political or administrative unit, though most of the area belonged to the Crown of Aragon in the Middle Ages. Parts of Valencia (Spanish) and Catalonia (Occitan) are not Catalan-speaking.

The &quot;Catalan Countries&quot; have been at the centre of both cultural and political projects since the late 19th century. Its mainly cultural dimension became increasingly politically charged by the late 1960s and early 1970s, as Francoism began to die out in Spain, and what had been a cultural term restricted to connoisseurs of Catalan philology became a divisive issue during the Spanish Transition period, most acrimoniously in Valencia during the 1980s. Modern linguistic and cultural projects include the Institut Ramon Llull and the Fundació Ramon Llull, which are run by the governments of the Balearic Islands, Catalonia and Andorra, the Department Council of the Pyrénées-Orientales, the city council of Alghero and the Network of Valencian Cities. Politically, it involves a pan-nationalist project to unite the Catalan-speaking territories of Spain and France, often in the context of the independence movement in Catalonia, but it is also simply a project for cultural unity, so that the linguistic area can have barriers to communication and interchange removed. The marginal political project of independence under Catalonia does not currently enjoy wide support, particularly outside Catalonia, where some sectors view it as an expression of pancatalanism. Linguistic unity is widely recognized, except for the followers of a political movement known as Blaverism, which understands Valencian as a different language.

==Different meanings==
&quot;Països Catalans&quot; has different meanings depending on the context. These can be roughly classified in two groups: linguistic or political, the political definition of the concept being the widest, since it also encompasses the linguistic side of it.

As a linguistic term, &quot;Països Catalans&quot; is used in a similar fashion to the English Anglosphere, the French Francophonie, the Portuguese Lusofonia or the Spanish Hispanophone territories. However, it is not universally accepted, even as a linguistic concept, in the territories it purports to unite.

As a political term, it refers to a number of political projects as advocated by supporters of Catalan independence. These, based on the linguistic fact, argue for the existence of a common national identity that would surpass the limits of each territory covered by this concept and would apply also to the remaining ones. These movements advocate for &quot;political collaboration&quot; amongst these territories. This often stands for their union and political independence. As a consequence of the opposition these political projects have received –notably in some of the territories described by this concept – some cultural institutions avoid the usage of &quot;Països Catalans&quot; in some contexts, as a means to prevent any political interpretation; in these cases, equivalent expressions (such as &quot;Catalan-speaking countries&quot;) or others (such as &quot;the linguistic domain of Catalan language&quot;) are used instead.

==Component territories==
Catalan and its variants are spoken in:

* the Spanish Autonomous Communities of
** Catalonia – even though in the &quot;comarca&quot; of Val d&#x27;Aran, Occitan is considered the language proper to that territory;
** Aragon, in a Catalan-speaking area known as &quot;La Franja de Ponent&quot; (&quot;Western Strip&quot;);
** the Balearic Islands and
** as &quot;Valencian&quot;, in the Valencian Community, with the exception of some western and southern territories where Spanish is the only language spoken;
*** Carche, small Valencian-speaking area in the Spanish autonomous community of Murcia where some of its 600 inhabitants still speak Valencian due to immigration during the 19th century;
* Andorra, a European sovereign state where Catalan is the national and only official language.
* most of the French department of the Pyrénées-Orientales, also called &quot;Le Pays Catalan&quot; (The Catalan Country) in French or &quot;Catalunya (del) Nord&quot; (Northern Catalonia) in Catalan;
* the Italian city of Alghero, in the island of Sardinia, where a variant of Catalan is spoken.

Catalan is the official language of Andorra, co-official with Spanish and Occitan in Catalonia, co-official with Spanish in the Balearic Islands and the Valencian Community—with the denomination of &quot;Valencian&quot; in the latter—and co-official with Italian in the city of Alghero. It is also part of the recognized minority languages of Italy along with Sardinian, also spoken in Alghero.

It is not official in Aragon, Murcia or the Pyrénées-Orientales, even though on 10 December 2007 the General Council of the Pyrénées-Orientales officially recognized Catalan, along with French, as a language of the department. In 2009, the Catalan language was declared &quot;llengua pròpia&quot; (with the Aragonese language) of Aragon.



==Cultural dimension==
There are several endeavors and collaborations amongst some of the diverse government and cultural institutions involved. One such case is the Ramon Llull Institute (IRL), founded in 2002 by the government of the Balearic Islands and the government of Catalonia. Its main objective is to promote the Catalan language and culture abroad in all its variants, as well as the works of writers, artists, scientists and researchers of the regions which are part of it. The Xarxa Vives d&#x27;Universitats (Vives Network of Universities), an association of universities of Catalonia, Valencia, the Balearic Islands, Northern Catalonia and Andorra founded in 1994, was incorporated into the IRL in 2008. Also in 2008, in order to extend the collaboration to institutions from all across the &quot;Catalan Countries&quot;, the IRL and the government of Andorra (which formerly had enjoyed occasional collaboration, most notably in the Frankfurt Book Fair of 2007) created the Ramon Llull Foundation (FRL), an international cultural institution with the same goals as the IRL. In 2009, the General Council of the Pyrénées-Orientales, the city council of Alghero and the Network of Valencian Cities (an association of a few Valencian city councils) joined the FRL as well. In December 2012 the government of the Balearic islands, dominated by the conservative and pro-Spain Partido Popular (PP), announced that the representatives of the Balearic islands were withdrawing from the Llull institute.

A number of cultural organizations, specifically Òmnium Cultural in Catalonia, Acció Cultural del País Valencià in Valencia, and Obra Cultural Balear in the Balearic islands (collectively the &quot;Llull Federation&quot;), advocate independence as well as the promotion of Catalan language and culture.

==Political dimension==
The political projects that centre on the Catalan Countries have been described as a &quot;hypothetical and future union&quot; of the various territories. In many cases it involves the Spanish autonomous communities of Catalonia, Valencia and the Balearics. The 2016 electoral programme of Valencian parties Compromís and Podemos spoke of a &quot;federation&quot; between the Valencian Community, the Balearic Islands and Catalonia. They are to campaign for an amendment to article 145 of the Spanish constitution, which forbids federation of autonomous communities. The territories concerned may also include Roussillon and &quot;La Franja&quot;.

Many in Spain see the concept of the &quot;Països Catalans&quot; as regional exceptionalism, counterpoised to a centralizing Spanish and French national identity. Others see it as an attempt by a Catalonia-proper-centered nationalism to lay a hegemonic claim to Valencia, the Balearic Islands or Roussillon, where the prevailing feeling is that they have their own respective historical personalities, not necessarily related to Catalonia&#x27;s. The Catalan author and journalist Valentí Puig described the term as &quot;inconvenient&quot;, saying it has generated more reactions against it than adhesions.

The concept has connotations that have been perceived as problematic and controversial when establishing relations between Catalonia and other areas of the Catalan linguistic domain. It has been characterised as a &quot;phantom reality&quot; and an &quot;unreal and fanciful space&quot;. The pro-Catalan independence author Germà Bel called it an &quot;inappropriate and unfortunate expression lacking any historic, political or social basis&quot;, while Xosé Manoel Núñez Seixas spoke of the difficulties in uniting a historicist concept linked to common membership of the Crown of Aragon with a fundamentally linguistic construct.

In many parts of the territories designated by some as &quot;Països Catalans&quot;, Catalan nationalist sentiment is uncommon. For example, in the Valencian Community&#x27;s case, the &quot;Esquerra Republicana del País Valencià&quot; (ERPV) is the most relevant party explicitly supportive of the idea but its representation is limited to a total of four local councilors elected in three municipalities (out of a total of 5,622 local councilors elected in the 542 Valencian municipalities). At the regional level, it has run twice (2003 and 2007) to the regional Parliament election, receiving less than 0.50% of the total votes. In all, its role in Valencian politics is currently marginal.

There are other parties which sporadically use this term in its cultural or linguistical sense, not prioritizing a national-political unity, as in the case of the Bloc Nacionalista Valencià. The Valencian Nationalist Bloc ( or &quot;BNV&quot;; ) is the largest Valencian nationalist party in the Valencian Country, Spain. The Bloc&#x27;s main aim is, as stated in their guidelines, &quot;to achieve full national sovereignty for the Valencian people, and make it legally declared by a Valencian sovereign Constitution allowing the possibility of association with the countries which share the same language, history and culture&quot;. Since 2011, they are part of the Coalició Compromís coalition, which won six seats in the 2011 Valencian regional elections and 19 in the 2015 elections, becoming the third largest party in the regional parliament.

Some of the most vocal defenders or promoters of the &quot;Catalan Countries&quot; concept (such as Joan Fuster, Josep Guia or Vicent Partal) were Valencian.

The subject became very controversial during the politically agitated Spanish Transition in what was to become the Valencian Community, especially in and around the city of Valencia. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, as the Spanish Autonomous Communities system took shape, the controversy reached its height. Various Valencian right-wing politicians (originally from Unión de Centro Democrático) fearing what was seen as an annexation attempt from Catalonia, fueled a violent Anti-Catalanist campaign against local supporters of the concept of the &quot;Països Catalans&quot;, which even included a handful of unsuccessful attacks with explosives against authors perceived as flagships of the concept, such as Joan Fuster or Manuel Sanchis i Guarner. The concept&#x27;s revival during this period was behind the formation of the fiercely opposed and staunch anti-Catalan blaverist movement, led by Unió Valenciana, which, in turn, significantly diminished during the 1990s and the 2000s as the &quot;Països Catalans&quot; controversy slowly disappeared from the Valencian political arena.

This confrontation between politicians from Catalonia and Valencia very much diminished in severity during the course of the late 1980s and, especially, the 1990s as the Valencian Community&#x27;s regional government became consolidated. Since then, the topic has lost most of its controversial potential, even though occasional clashes may appear from time to time, such as controversies regarding the broadcasting of Catalan television in Valencia—and vice versa—or the usage by Catalan official institutions of terms which are perceived in Valencia as Catalan nationalistic, such as &quot;Països Catalans&quot; or &quot;País Valencià&quot; (&quot;Valencian Country&quot;).

A 2004 poll in Valencia found that a majority of the population in this region considered Valencian to be a different language to Catalan. This position is especially supported by people who do not use Valencian regularly. Furthermore, the data indicate that younger people educated in Valencian are much less likely to hold these views. According to an official poll in 2014, 52% of Valencians considered Valencian to be a language different from Catalan, while 41% considered the languages to be the same. This poll showed significant differences regarding age and level of education, with a majority of those aged 18–24 (51%) and those with a higher education (58%) considering Valencian to be the same language as Catalan. This can be compared to those aged 65 and above (29%) and those with only primary education (32%), where the same view has its lowest support.

In 2015, the Spanish newspaper &quot;ABC&quot; reported that the Catalan government of Artur Mas had spent millions of euros to promote Catalanism in Valencia over the previous three years.

As for the other territories, there are no political parties even mentioning the &quot;Països Catalans&quot; as a public issue neither in Andorra, nor in &quot;la Franja&quot;, Carche or Alghero. In the Balearic islands, support for parties related to Catalan nationalism is around 10% of the total votes. Reversely, the Popular Party –which is a staunch opponent of whatever political implications for the &quot;Països Catalans&quot; concept– is the majority party in Valencia and the Balearic islands.

Even though the topic has been largely absent from the political agenda as of late, in December 2013 the regional Parliament of the Balearic islands passed an official declaration in defence of its autonomy and in response to a prior declaration by the Catalan regional Parliament which included reference to the term in question. In the declaration of the Balearic islands parliament, it was stated that the so-called &quot;&quot;Països Catalans&quot; do not exist and the Balearic islands do not take part in any &#x27;Catalan country&#x27; whatsoever&quot;.

In August 2018, the ex-mayor of Alghero, Carlo Sechi, defined algherese identity as part of the Catalan culture whilst politically defining Alghero as part of the Sardinian nation.

The Spanish Constitution of 1978 contains a clause forbidding the formation of federations amongst autonomous communities. Therefore, if it were the case that the &quot;Països Catalans&quot; idea gained a majority democratic support in future elections, a constitutional amendment would still be needed for those parts of the &quot;Països Catalans&quot; lying in Spain to create a common legal representative body, even though in the addenda to the Constitution there is a clause allowing an exception to this rule in the case of Navarre, which can join the Basque Country should the people choose to do so.
Catalans in the French territory of Northern Catalonia, although proud of their language and culture, are not committed to independence. Jordi Vera, a CDC councillor in Perpignan, has said that his party favoured closer trade and transport relationships with Catalonia, and that he believed Catalan independence would improve the prospects of that happening, but that secession from France was &quot;not on the agenda&quot;. When Catalans took to the streets in 2016 under the banner of &quot;&quot; (&quot;Yes to the Catalan Country&quot;) to protest the French government&#x27;s decision to combine , the region which contained Northern Catalonia, with to create a new region to be called , the French magazine said that the movement was &quot;completely unrelated to the situation on the other side of the border&quot;, and that it was &quot;more directed against Toulouse [the chief city of ] than against Paris or for Barcelona.&quot; , which stood in the 2017 French legislative election, said that&#x27;s its aim is a &quot;territorial collectivity&quot; within the French Republic on the same lines as Corsica. Every year, though, there are between 300 and 600 people in a demonstration to commemorate the 1659 Treaty of the Pyrenees, that separated Northern Catalonia from the South.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;Països Catalans&quot; was first documented in 1876 in &quot;Historia del Derecho en Cataluña, Mallorca y Valencia. Código de las Costumbres de Tortosa, I&quot; (History of the Law in Catalonia, Majorca and Valencia. Code of the Customs of Tortosa, I) written by the Valencian Law historian Benvingut Oliver i Esteller.

The term was both challenged and reinforced by the use of the term &quot;Occitan Countries&quot; from the Oficina de Relacions Meridionals (Office of Southern Relations) in Barcelona by 1933. Another proposal which enjoyed some popularity during the Renaixença was &quot;Pàtria llemosina&quot; (Limousine Fatherland), proposed by Víctor Balaguer as a federation of Catalan-speaking provinces; both these coinages were based on the theory that Catalan is a dialect of Occitan.

None of these names reached widespread cultural usage and the term nearly vanished until it was rediscovered, redefined and put in the center of the identity cultural debate by Valencian writer Joan Fuster. In his book &quot;Nosaltres, els valencians&quot; (&quot;We, the Valencians&quot;, published in 1962) a new political interpretation of the concept was introduced; from the original, meaning roughly &quot;Catalan-speaking territories&quot;, Fuster developed a political inference closely associated to Catalan nationalism. This new approach would refer to the Catalan Countries as a more or less unitary nation with a shared culture which had been divided by the course of history, but which should logically be politically reunited. Fuster&#x27;s preference for &quot;Països Catalans&quot; gained popularity, and previous unsuccessful proposals such as &quot;Comunitat Catalànica&quot; (&quot;Catalanic Community&quot;) or &quot;Bacàvia&quot; (after Balearics-Catalonia-Valencia) diminished in use.

Today, the term is politically charged, and tends to be closely associated with Catalan nationalism and supporters of Catalan independence. The idea of uniting these territories in an independent state is supported by a number of political parties, ERC being the most important in terms of representation (32 members in the Parliament of Catalonia) and CUP (10 members). ERPV, PSAN (currently integrated in SI), Estat Català also support this idea to a greater or lesser extent.

<text>Santiago de Querétaro (; Otomi: Dähnini Maxei), most commonly known as Querétaro, is the capital and largest city of the state of Querétaro, located in central Mexico. It is part of the macroregion of Bajío. It is northwest of Mexico City, southeast of San Miguel de Allende and south of San Luis Potosí. It is also the seat of the municipality of Querétaro, divided into seven boroughs. In 1996, the historic center of Querétaro was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.

The city is a strong business and economic center and a vigorous service center that is experiencing an ongoing social and economic revitalization. All this has resulted in high levels of migration from other parts of Mexico.

Querétaro has seen outstanding industrial and economic development since the mid-1990s. The Querétaro metropolitan area has the second highest per capita GDP among Mexico&#x27;s metropolitan areas with US$20,000 after Monterrey. The city is the fastest-growing in the country, basing its economy on IT and data centers, logistics services, aircraft manufacturing and maintenance, call centers, the automotive and machinery industries, and the production of chemicals and food products. The region of Querétaro has a rapidly growing vineyards agriculture and hosts the famous wine producer from Spain Freixenet. Wine production in the state of Querétaro is now the second largest in Mexico after that of the Baja California region.

Major international corporations in the aerospace, electronics, automotive, chemical, food, and financial areas have their national headquarters in Querétaro.

==Etymology==
In the Otomi language, it is referred to as &quot;Maxei&quot; or &quot;Ndamaxei&quot;, which means ball game and the grand ball game respectively. In the Mendocino Codex the town is called Tlaschco or Tlaxco, from the Nahuatl word for ball game. However, Querétaro most likely comes from k&#x27;eri ireta rho, meaning place of the great people, especially since during Aztec times about 15,000 people lived here. Querétaro has an Aztec glyph to represent it as it was a tributary province. In 1655, it received a coat of arms from the Spanish Crown.

The word &quot;Querétaro&quot; was voted by 33,000 participants as &quot;the most beautiful word in the Spanish language&quot;, before being approved by the Instituto Cervantes. In Pre-Columbian terminology, Querétaro literally means &quot;the island of the blue salamanders&quot;. Nevertheless, other scholars suggest that it can mean &quot;place of the reptiles&quot; or &quot;place of the giant rocks&quot;.

==History==

=== Pre-Foundation ===
The area was settled around AD 200 by Mesoamerican groups moving north, and archeological sites here show Teotihuacan influences. From the Classic Period, there were two population centers in this area called Toluquilla and Las Ranas. The mountain now known as El Cerrito was a ceremonial center, but was later abandoned for unknown reasons.
In the later pre-Hispanic period, the area was populated by the Otomi, who had become sedentary urban dwellers with sophisticated politics by the time of the Aztec Empire, who referred to them as the Tlacetilli Otomi or &quot;Otomi Nation/State&quot; . This area was under control of the Otomi dominion of Xilotepeque in the 1440s, which in turn was subject to the Aztec Empire of Mexihco-Tenochtitlan. Under the reign of Ahuizotl in the late 15th century, the Aztecs administered the area directly, considering it a bulwark against the Chichimeca lands to the north. The Otomi were the most populous ethnicity in Xilotepec although there were other groups, primarily Chichimeca as well. These two groups are still found here today. During the pre-Hispanic and colonial times, the Otomi were organized into familial clan like groups with defined territories, living in stone, wood or adobe dwellings. They were sedentary farmers, who fought, but unlike the Aztecs, did not make warfare a large part of their culture.

=== Foundation ===

The Spanish city of Santiago de Querétaro was founded on 25 July 1531, when Spaniard Hernán Pérez Bocanegra y Córdoba arrived with the allied Otomi leader Conín (later named Hernando de Tapia) who was the administrative head of the Otomi peoples living in Aztec controlled territory. On this date, the Spanish and their Nahuan allies were battling the local insurgent Otomi and Chichimecas at a hill now known as Sangremal and which was called Ynlotepeque and considered sacred in pre-Hispanic times. Chronicles of this event, such as that written by Friar Isidro Félix de Espinoza, state that the Chichimeca were at the point of winning when a total eclipse of the sun occurred. This supposedly scared the Chichimeca and the Spanish claimed to have seen an image of Saint James (the patron saint of Spain) riding a white horse carrying a rose-colored cross. This event caused the Chichimeca to surrender. This event is why the city is called Santiago (Saint James) de Querétaro, with James as patron saint. A stone cross imitating the one the Spanish supposedly saw was erected on the hill, which later was accompanied by a church and monastery.

Spanish dominion, however, grew gradually, and was definitively not won through just a single battle. In the 1520s, the Otomis and many Chichimecas of what is now southern Querétaro and northern Mexico State allied with Hernán Cortés under the control of the lord of Xilotepeque, who still maintained a certain amount of control of the old dominion. The first Spanish arrived between 1526 and 1529, headed by Hernán Pérez de Bocanegra. Bocanegra at first tried non-violent means of subduing the area and founding a Spanish city. However, the initial attempts to establish the city of Querétaro were repelled by the locals, forcing Bocanegra south and establishing the cities of Huimilpan and Acámbaro.

Bocanegra continued negotiating with the lord of Xilotepeque, Conín. The lord&#x27;s cooperation was gained, for which he was eventually credited for bringing an end to the Spanish-Chichime/Otomi conflict and was made the Spanish governor of the area. However, most of Querétaro&#x27;s early colonial history was marked by skirmishes between the remaining Chichimeca insurgency and the Spanish authorities, with one of the first being over the establishment of encomiendas. Conín separated the indigenous and Spanish residents of the new city, with the indigenous on and around Sangremal hill and the Spanish around where the current historic center is. The Spanish part of the city was laid out by D. Juan Sanchez de Alaniz, and the indigenous section was laid out in the traditional Otomi manner. The first city council convened in 1535, and the settlement was named a Pueblo de Indios (Indian Village) in 1537, ending the encomiendas. During this time, the Franciscans arrived for missionary work, who were later joined by the Jesuits, the Augustinians and other who built monasteries such as the Monastery of San Francisco, Lima and the Monastery of Santa Cruz.

=== Peak of colonial era ===

The settlement was declared a town in 1606 and by 1655, only Spaniards were living in the city proper. In 1656, it was decreed as the &quot;Muy Noble y Leal Ciudad de Santiago de Querétaro&quot; (Very Noble and Loyal City of Santiago de Querétaro). This honor was solicited by Viceroy Luis de Velasco, in recognition of Querétaro&#x27;s growth, agricultural production, industry and educational institutions. By the 18th century, it was informally known as the &quot;Pearl of the Bajío&quot; and &quot;The Third City of the Viceroyalty&quot;.

By the 17th century, the Franciscans had been joined by the Dieguinos, who built the monastery of San Antonio, the Jesuits, who built the Colleges of San Ignacio and San Francisco Javier as well as the Dominicans, the Carmelites and the Royal Convent of Santa Clara de Asís, which was one of the largest and most opulent in New Spain. Querétaro was also the site for the training of many of the missionaries who went north as far as Texas and California. Most of these were educated at the Colegio de Propagación de la Fe (College for the Propagation of the Faith), which was established at the monastery of Santa Cruz in 1683. Some of its graduates even went as far as South America. Few of the buildings from the 16th century have remained intact, due to the violence during the city&#x27;s initial development, which reached its peak in the 17th century. As a result, most of the city&#x27;s oldest structures are of Baroque style.

=== Independence and capital status ===

Querétaro is considered to be one of the cradles of Mexican Independence and much of the credit is given to Josefa Ortiz de Domínguez. She was the wife of the city&#x27;s mayor, called a &quot;corregidor&quot;, at the beginning of the 19th century. She used her prominent position to gather intelligence for the nascent insurgency.

Literary circles called &quot;tertulias&quot; were a popular pastime for the upper Creole classes, as they also served as a relatively safe place to discuss politics. One such occurred regularly at the house of José María Sánchez, with the name of the Asociación de Apatistas, which became a group dedicated to independence and winning supporters to the cause. Members included licenciados Lorenzo de la Parra, Juan Nepomuceno Mier y Altamirano, Manuel Ramírez de Arellano y Mario Lazo de la Vega José María Sánchez, Fray José Lozano, Antonio Tellez, don Emeterio y Epigmenio González, José Ignacio de Villaseñor Cervantes y Aldama, Dr. Manuel Marciano Iturriaga, Pedro Antonio de Septién Montero y Austri, Luis Mendoza, Juan José García Rebollo, Francisco Lojero, Ignacio Gutiérrez, Mariano Hidalgo, Mariano Lozada, José María Buenrostro, Manuel Delgado, Francisco Araujo, Felipe Coria, Francisco Lanzagorta, Ignacio Villaseñor and José María Sotelo. The group was visited on occasion by Ignacio Allende, Juan Aldama, Josefa Ortiz de Domínguez, Miguel Domínguez and Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla. This associación was important for the early organisation of those seeking independence for Mexico.

However the most famous of the tertulias was hosted by Josefa Ortiz de Domínguez herself at what is now the Palace of the Corregidora. Originally, they were open to both creoles and Spanish-born but after an altercation between Ignacio Allende and the Spaniard Crisóstomo López y Valdez, only creoles attended. The tertulias of Josefa Ortiz de Domínguez culminated in the Conspiracy of 1810, which was discovered before they had planned to act.
On 13 September 1810, Epigmenio González was arrested for having stockpiled weapons for an insurgency and the next day Mayor Miguel Domínguez and his wife Josefa Ortiz de Domínguez were arrested for their roles in the Conspiracy of 1810. With the conspiracy discovered, she still managed to get a warning to Miguel Hidalgo. He eluded capture and rushed to Dolores, where he gave his famous grito (the cry for independence). For her actions, La Corregidora was imprisoned several times between 1810 and 1817. She died impoverished and forgotten, but was later remembered when she became the first woman to appear on a Mexican coin. Once the armed battle began, the city was taken by the royalist army and was the last major city to be taken by the insurgents.

After the end of the war, Santiago de Querétaro became the capital of the state of Querétaro in 1823, with the first state congress convening at the Auditorium of the Instituto de Bellas Artes de la Universidad Autónoma de Querétaro in the city. The state&#x27;s first constitution was promulgated in the city in 1825, with the city as head of one of the state&#x27;s six districts. In 1847, it was declared the capital of Mexico when U.S. forces invaded the country. One year later, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was signed in this city, ceding almost half of Mexico&#x27;s territory and ending the war. In 1854, another treaty signed here led to the Gadsden Purchase.

In 1867, Maximilian I of Mexico was defeated at the Siege of Querétaro, where the liberals took him prisoner along with Generals Miguel Miramón and Tomás Mejía. In May 1867, the emperor was sentenced to death along with Mejía and Miramón in the Cerro de las Campanas.
From 1869 to 1879, the districts were subdivided into municipalities, which the city of Querétaro as seat of both the municipality of Querétaro and the district of Querétaro. In the 20th century, the original municipality of Querétaro divided into three: Querétaro, El Marqués and Corregidora. The district system as a political entity was abolished after the Mexican Revolution, with the municipality as the base of local government. The first municipal president was Alfonso Camacho who took office in 1917.
No major battles were fought here during the Mexican Revolution but various of the factions passed through here given the state&#x27;s location between the northern states and Mexico City.

=== 20th century ===

On 2 February 1916, the city was named the provisional capital of the country by President Venustiano Carranza on account of the Constituent Congress that was to convene there and that enacted the Political Constitution of the United Mexican States on 5 February the following year. This constitution still remains the law of the land.

On 10 September 1996, the Legislature of Querétaro amended the state constitution to restore &quot;Santiago de Querétaro&quot; as the capital&#x27;s official name.

==Economy==

Economic growth has been outstanding during the last decade. Today, Querétaro is a middle class city in terms of PPP GDP, with $20,000, The municipality of Querétaro was ranked 23rd in Mexico on the United Nations Index of Human Development. Querétaro debuted in 13th place in the 2006 rankings of the &quot;Best Cities to do Business in Latin America&quot; in América Economía, a leading economic magazine. In the 2007 rankings, it is considered the second best place in Mexico to do business, after Monterrey and the fifth best in Latin America, ahead of Miami in 6th place. The ranking takes into account variables such as telecommunications, innovation, quality of life, urban expansion, and crime statistics. In its 2007 survey entitled &quot;Cities of the Future&quot;, FDI magazine ranked Querétaro as having the third highest cost effectiveness of all North American cities between 500,000 and two million people. In the overall classification of large cities, Querétaro was ranked sixth.

Until the 1970s, agriculture had been the overwhelming basis of the economy of the municipality outside the city and commerce within it. Since then, the expansion of industry and the growth of the city, which started in the 1950s, have diminished the importance of agriculture and the land available for it. It now only employs .01% of the municipality&#x27;s population. Major employers now are the industrial parks that surround the city and extend to San Juan del Río. These include the Zona Industrial Benito Juarez, Parque Industrial Querétaro, Parque Industrial Jurica Parque La Montaña and the Querétaro-San Juan del Río Industrial Corridor. Most of the businesses operating here are foreign-owned or were built with foreign investment funds. Industries include machine and auto parts, food processing, paper products, printing, chemicals and glass.

Querétaro&#x27;s economic growth is above the national average, due in part, the city believes, to the investment that it makes in infrastructure, public services and the creation of parks as well as sports and cultural facilities.
The economy spurs immigration to the city, which has seen a population growth of more than 3.5 percent a year. The industrialization of the area has attracted a large number of migrants from poorer areas of Mexico but many of these are unemployed or under-employed. This has led to an explosion of informal markets and other businesses in and around the city. Also a large number of those seeking to migrate to the northern Mexican states or to the United States pass through here. This has led to commerce being the largest economic activity in the municipality.
Tourism has grown as a sector of the economy, especially in the city proper, and is now one of the most important, accounting for 21 percent of the gross product of the city.
Both Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s and the newspaper &quot;Reforma&quot; have ranked Querétaro as one of the safest cities to live in with the highest quality of life in Mexico. According to the Secretaría de Desarrollo Sustenable Municipal, the city is expected to increase in size 35 percent over the next 20 to 25 years. Economic growth for 2009 and 2010 was predicted to be between one and two percent due to the worldwide economic downturn.
Especially changes like the deconcentration of the economic activities (industry and service) and the emergence of a housing market lead to significant growth in cities like Querétaro.
Major corporations headquartered in Querétaro include Bombardier Aerospace (an airplane manufacturing facility in Mexico), Kellogg&#x27;s, Samsung Electronics, Daewoo, and Colgate-Palmolive. Harman International Industries, General Electric, Michelin, Tetra Pak, Siemens Mexico, New Holland, Faurecia, ABC Group, Autoliv, TRW Automotive, Tremec, Valeo, Funai, Procter &amp; Gamble, Nestlé, Pilgrim&#x27;s Pride, Santander Bank&#x27;s call center for Latin America, Mabe Mexico, Irizar, Scania, Hitachi, Kostal, Aernnova, Dana, Dow Chemical, Bose, Alpha Hilex, Saint-Gobain, Flex-N-Gate, ThyssenKrupp, and TCS.

==Festival of Santiago de Querétaro==

The Festival of Santiago de Querétaro is an annual arts and cultural event that takes place in the city for eight days during Holy Week. It is sponsored by the city of Querétaro along with CONACULTA and the Secretary of Tourism for the state of Querétaro. Each year the event has a theme, which was being &quot;Arte in Todos los Sentidos&quot; (Art in All Senses) in 2009. The events are held in various locations, such as the City Museum, the Guerrero Garden, the Zenea Garden and the Rosalio Solano Theatre as well as the various plazas around the city center. The festival is held during Holy Week holiday to attract Mexican and international visitors to the city. The event starts with an inaugural parade through the streets of the historic center, starting from Corregidora Street to Constituyentes, Angela Peralta, Juárez, Madera, and Guerrero streets. The parade ends at the site where public officials open the event.

Over the eight days, both Mexican and international artists perform and exhibit their work. Events include music, painting, dance, photography, literature, special workshops and a children&#x27;s pavilion. One final day, there is a culinary event were visitors can sample regional cuisine from restaurants of the city.

Featured Mexican artists included Pindekuechua, a traditional music group from Morelia, Grupo Esparza from Guanajuato and Jazzcorps from Toluca.

== Metropolitan area ==
According to the latest definitions by the National Population Council (CONAPO), the Metropolitan Area of Querétaro spans over an area of , comprising the municipalities of Querétaro, Corregidora, El Marqués and Huimilpan in the state of Querétaro, and Apaseo el Alto in the state of Guanajuato. With a total population of 1,594,212 in 2020, it is the 8th largest metro area in Mexico, as well as the 128th largest in the largest metropolitan areas in the Americas.

The metropolitan area of Querétaro has seen a high population growth since the second half of the 1990s, making it the second fastest-growing in the country, just behind Cancún. The municipality of El Marqués has the highest rate of population growth in the state, after almost doubling its population in the last ten years. Most of the population growth is due to migration with people relocating from Mexico City, State of Mexico, Guanajuato, Michoacán and Veracruz. It is estimated that in 2005 alone, 10,465 people migrated to the metropolitan area.

Due to factors as diverse as education, economy, security, and quality of life, migration flows from the north and center of the country to the city of Santiago de Querétaro have been noticeable in the recent years. Especially the cities&#x27; high security reason also attracts people from other countries like Venezuela, Colombia, Brazil, Spain and many others. Due to the high number of migrants, the municipality is currently considering implementing the Institute for Migrant Assistance to make migration more visible and hence increase structure, legality and safety.

Querétaro is among the top five most competitive metropolitan areas in Mexico.

In January 2008, the government of the border municipality of Apaseo el Alto in the state of Guanajuato announced the construction of an urbanization for 120,000 inhabitants, which will be part of the metropolitan area of Santiago de Querétaro.

== Transportation ==
===Roads===
Querétaro is the crossroads of Mexico. Federal Highway 57, which runs from Mexico City to Piedras Negras, Coahuila, crosses Querétaro. Federal Highway 45 leaves Querétaro westbound, towards Guanajuato. The part of Federal Highway 57 that crosses the city is called Blvd. Bernardo Quintana, and this is the main road of the city, stretching from its southernmost part near City Hall, to the new industrial areas northwest of downtown. Federal Highway 45 crosses the city, south of downtown. Cinco de Febrero Ave joins them in a north–south route. The three of them form a sort of ring road around downtown. The railway line that connects Mexico City with western Mexico bisects the city.

The &quot;Libramiento Sur-Poniente&quot; is a new ring road under construction, though parts of it already exist. When completed, it will join Bernardo Quintana on its southeastern part, go around the city in its southwestern and western parts, and reach the northern suburb of Santa Rosa Jauregui. Currently, there is work in progress that aims to extend Bernardo Quintana on its northwestern end to this ring road.

Another freeway, named after missionary Junípero Serra who founded the Missions of the Sierra Gorda, creates another ring road. It goes from northeast Querétaro around the old airport, reaches the northern suburb of Juriquilla and goes southwards down to the Libramiento Sur-Poniente.

===Public transport===
Querétaro&#x27;s public transportation consists of private owned bus companies that pick up and drop off over a specific route. These cover 123 authorized routes all neighborhoods of the city. There are also conventional taxis. The city also has a large inter-city bus terminal.

===Air===
Querétaro International Airport began operations in 2004, replacing the old Ing. Fernando Espinoza Gutiérrez International Airport in the city. The airport handles passengers and freight of both transport and private airplanes, and in recent years became of the fastest growing airports in Mexico in terms of passengers. Plans to convert the old airport into an international one began in 1999, after studies indicated the need for such. Construction of infrastructure began in 2002.

Other major cities in the municipality are Juriquilla (39,244), San Pedro Mártir (31,677), San José el Alto (29,758) and Santa Rosa Jáuregui (22,168).
=== Boroughs ===
The municipality of Querétaro is divided into seven boroughs, called &quot;delegaciones&quot;:
* Centro Histórico: it includes downtown and nearby areas, it is surrounded by the city&#x27;s main thoroughfares (Blvd. Bernardo Quintana, 5 de Febrero Ave. and the Mexico City–Querétaro Highway). Most of the city&#x27;s monuments are located here, including the UNESCO World Heritage Site designated areas, and the &quot;Cerro de las Campanas&quot; where Emperor Maximilian of Habsburg was executed. The northwestern corner is home to industrial establishments, mainly food related (Gerber, Nestlé, Pilgrim&#x27;s Pride).
* Santa Rosa Jáuregui: it consists mainly of rural areas, where the production of eggs, poultry and livestock are important. However, the borough includes larger towns such as Santa Rosa Jáuregui and Juriquilla. It is home to the largest water reservoir in the municipality, the &quot;Presa de Santa Catarina&quot;. A relatively new state of the art industrial park has been built here (Samsung).
* Felix Osores Sotomayor: most of the recent growth in the city has taken place here, the population growth rate estimated at 6%. The largest industrial area of Querétaro is located here, where many multinational companies have operations (Michelin, Philips). The beautiful neighborhood of Jurica is located in this borough.
* Epigmenio González: a mostly residential zone on hilly terrain. The former airport will become the third campus of the Universidad Autónoma de Querétaro. (pop. 125,000; area 68 km2)
* Josefa Vergara y Hernández: on the slopes of the Cerro del Cimatario, its easternmost area is known as &quot;Centro Sur&quot;, where the Stadium, Bus Station and City Hall are located. (pop. 200,000; area 33 km2)
* Felipe Carrillo Puerto: the western part consists mainly of rural areas, where the town of Tlacote is located, famous for its allegedly miraculous water springs. The eastern area is urban and integrated with the rest of the city, with industrial zones (Kellogg&#x27;s) and military facilities.
* Cayetano Rubio: residential area, it includes the town of Hercules, a village-like area, nestled between steep slopes along the riverway of the Río Querétaro.
The mayor of each borough, called &quot;delegado&quot;, is appointed by the mayor of the city, although there have been attempts to make these posts popularly elected.

== UNESCO World Heritage Site ==

In 1996, the historic center of Querétaro was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. According to UNESCO&#x27;s website, the &quot;old colonial town of Querétaro is unusual in having retained the geometric street plan of the Spanish conquerors side by side with the twisting alleys of the Otomi quarters. The Otomi, the Tarasco, the Chichimeca and the Spanish lived together peacefully in the town with similar standards of living, a rare occurrence at a time when the Indigenous and Hispanic were usually separated by a large income gap and at odds with one another in other parts of the nation.

This peace and similarity of social integration is largely attributed to the fact that the local Indigenous ethnicities and Spanish reached peace early after contact and both functioned concurrently with the Indigenous retaining their own economic and social systems while the Criollos operated in a separate but integrated society within the city. The city is notable for the many ornate civil and religious Baroque monuments from its golden age in the 17th and 18th centuries&quot; In 2008, &quot;National Geographic Traveler&quot; listed Querétaro as one of the top 15 historic destinations of the world.

==Notable sites==
The most prominent feature of the city is the enormous aqueduct of Querétaro, consisting of seventy-four arches, each twenty meters wide with a total extension of 1,280 meters and an average height of 23 meters. It was built by the Marquis Juan Antonio de Urrutia y Arana between 1726 and 1738 at the request of the nuns of the Santa Clara Convent to bring water to the residents of the city from La Cañada.

Most of the rest of Querétaro&#x27;s notable sites are located in the historic center, which is pedestrian-friendly and filled with colonial architecture. The local government maintains this area well, with cleaning crews to keep the streets clean and regulating vendors so that they do not block streets and sidewalks. In the evening, the area fills with people strolling the plazas and walkways and frequenting the area&#x27;s restaurants, cafes and food stands. One way to see this part of town is the Noche de Leyendas (Night of Legends), which is a hybrid between interactive theater and a recounting of history. A group of actors guide visitors through the streets of the city narrating stories about what has happened in these places. This event begins at the main plaza, the Plaza de Armas in the center of the city with a reenactment of the legend of Carambada. Then the show wanders the street all the while telling tales related to bandits, loves and myths. These tales demand audience participation providing lines and provoking debate.

In the center of downtown is the Church of San Francisco, finished at the beginning of the 18th century and from then on the most important in town, serving as the cathedral until the 20th century. It and the attached cloister is all that is left of a large complex that included several chapels and an orchard that extended for blocks to the east and south. On the facade, there is a depicting of Saint James fighting the Moors, cutting the head off of one. The main altar is Neoclassic, and replaced what reputedly was a masterpiece of Baroque design. This has happened frequently in the city; those Baroque altars not plundered over the course of Mexican history were replaced by newer designs. Older Baroque side altarpieces are still here, and are covered in gold leaf. Other notable pieces here include a large Baroque music stand and the seating of the choir section both done by architect Francisco Eduardo Tresguerras of Celaya in the 18th century. There are also sculptures done by Mariano Montenegro and Mariano Arce.

The church&#x27;s cloister is now the Museo Regional (Regional Museum). Built between 1660 and 1698, the monastery it houses was the first in the city, built by Franciscans to evangelize the native populations here. The architecture is representative of Franciscan style, with simple lines and decoration. The museum exhibits artifacts from the pre-Hispanic, colonial and post-Independence eras of this region&#x27;s history. The Plaza de la Constitución and Jardin Zenea plaza (named after liberal governor Benito Zenea) were part of the atrium of the church and monastery. This area is crowded every night and all day on Sunday, when the municipal band plays dance music from the 1940s to the 1960s.
The Plaza de Independencia or Plaza de Armas is the oldest part of the city, and is filled with Indian laurel trees, surrounded by outdoor restaurants and colonial mansions. Streets here are made of cobblestone and have names such as La Calle de Bimbo and the Callejón del Ciego. In the middle of this plaza is a fountain that honors Juan Antonio de Urrutia y Arana, who built that large aqueduct to bring water to the city. Around the plaza is the Galeria Libertad (Libertad Gallery) and the Casa de Ecala (Ecala House), which is a baronial mansion from the 18th century with large balconies and wrought ironwork. However, the best-known structure on this plaza is the Palacio de la Corregiadora.

The Palacio de la Corregidora was originally called the Casas Reales y Cárceles (Royal Houses and Jails). Today it houses the government of the state of Querétaro. Its name comes from its most famous occupant, Josefa Ortiz de Domínguez, who was the wife of the mayor or corregidor of the city. Ortiz de Domínguez is a heroine of the Mexican War of Independence and the Conspiracy of 1810 that led to the start of the war which occurred here. Her final resting place is the Mausoleum of the Corregidora.
The Church and ex-monastery of San Felipe Neri was built between 1786 and 1805. It was opened and blessed by Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, who also officiated the first Mass. In 1921, this church was declared the Cathedral of Querétaro by Pope Benedict XV. The church is constructed of tezontle and has altarpieces of cantera stone. The facade shows the transition between Baroque and Neoclassical architecture, and is considered to be the last Baroque facade in the city. Inside the nave is sober, austere and completely Neoclassical. The old monastery complex now houses the Ministry of Urban Development and Public Works. It is more commonly referred to as the Palace of Conín.
The Church and ex-convent of Santa Rosa de Viterbo is attributed to Alarife Ignacio Maraiano de las Casas and financed by José Velasquez de Lorea, finished in 1752. The church has twin entrances, which was common with convent churches. The two arches are decorated with mocking faces put there by Casas to those who did not think he could manage the building of the institution. The outside is flanked by scroll-shaped flying buttresses, which only serve as decoration and are unique to Querétaro. The tower has a unique shape and is topped with a pyramid-shaped crest. There is an inner doorway decorated in Churrigueresque style and an image of Saint Rose. Inside, the most outstanding feature is the pulpit inlaid with ivory, nacre, turtle shell and silver, and its altarpieces are gold covered in Querétaro Baroque style. The entrance to the sacristy contains paintings of José Velazquez de Lore and Sor Ana María de San Francisco y Neve. The convent complex was later amplified by Juan Caballero y Osio. The nuns began to dedicate themselves to primary education and by 1727 it became the Royal College of Santa Rosa. The convent was closed in 1861 due to the Reform Laws and was subsequently used as a hospital for about 100 years. Today the convent portion is home to the Centro de Estudios de Diseño y Artes Graficas Mexico-Italiano.

The church and monastery of La Santa Cruz is on Sangremal Hill, where the appearance of Saint James is said to have occurred at the founding of the city and the cross commemorating the event is kept. Both the church and the monastery are Franciscan, and in one of the few monasteries to be in operation in Mexico. This was also the site of the Colegio de la Propagación de la Fe, the first missionary school established in the Americas. From here, missionaries such as Junípero Serra set out on foot, as required by the Order, to establish missions as far away as Texas and California. During the early War of Independence, Miguel Domínguez, Querétaro&#x27;s mayor and part of the 1810 Conspiracy was imprisoned here. The church has been completely restored and its main attraction is the pink stone cross that was placed on this hill in the 16th century. Its altarpieces are also of pink stone and are a mix of Baroque and Neoclassical. Tours are available here and feature how the aqueduct brought water here to cisterns, from which the residents of the city would fill their buckets. There is also a thorn tree said to have grown from the walking stick of Friar Antonio Margil de Jesús, and is considered miraculous as the thorns grow in the shape of a cross.

The Museo de Arte (Museum of Art) is located in the former monastery of San Agustín. The building is considered one of the major Baroque works of art in Mexico, built in the 18th century and is attributed to Ignacio Mariano de la Casa. It has a facade of cantera stone in which an image of a crucified Christ is surrounded by grapevines. The niches around the main portal contain images of Saint Joseph, Our Lady of Sorrows, Saint Monica and others. Its cupola contains life-sized images of angels, but its bell tower was never finished. The monastery was occupied by Augustine friars starting in 1743 and is considered to be one of the finest Baroque monasteries in the Americas. Its fame as such comes from the decoration of the arches and columns that surround the inner courtyard. On the ground floor, there are faces with fierce expressions, while those on the upper floor have more serene expressions. Surrounding both sets of faces are chains linking the images. The museum contains one of the most important collections of colonial-era art and is organized by painting style. Some European works are here but the focus is on the painters of New Spain, including some of the most famous. The museum also sponsors temporary exhibits, theatrical works, as well as literary, photography and musical events.
The Museo de la Ciudad (City Museum) is in the former Royal Convent of Santa Clara. In the 18th century, sisters of the Capuchin order moved from Mexico City to Querétaro to occupy this complex, which was built by the city for them. This was done to show the city&#x27;s economic strength as well as secure its social position in New Spain. After the Reform Laws, this building had a number of uses, as a prison with Maximilian I as its most famous prisoner, a military barracks and offices. Today it is home to a cultural center. In 1997, the Museo de la Ciudad (Museum of the city), which belongs to the Instituto Queretano de la Cultura y las Artes (Querétaro Institute of Culture and the Arts) was moved to this building, and is mostly dedicated to contemporary art. In addition to the permanent collection, the museum sponsors temporary exhibitions of drawings, photographs, sculptures, etc. as well as recitals in dance, music and other arts. The museum has exchange programs with Sweden and has established the Children&#x27;s Library of the Museum of the city. Its goal is to interest children in the arts through books, workshops and other activities. The Church of Santa Clara maintains its religious function. Inside are six Baroque altarpieces and a choir loft, all of which are covered in gold leaf. On the altarpieces sculptures and paintings of saints appear, as well as the faces of angels among the thickly textured ornamentation covering the altarpieces.

The Teatro de la Republica (Theatre of the Republic) was built between 1845 and 1852 and originally called Teatro Iturbide. In 1867, the court martial of Maximiliano I and his generals, Miguel Miramón and Tomás Mejía sentenced the three to death. The Constitution of 1917 was promulgated here. In 1922, the governor of Querétaro state changed the name to its current one in honor of the 1917 event. The theatre is primarily used for acts and ceremonies on the state, national and international levels, such as the swearing in of the state&#x27;s governor.

The city still contains a number of mansions from the colonial era, most of which have been converted into a number of uses. One of these is the La Casa de la Zacatecana (The Zacatecana House) on Independencia 51, which has been restored as a museum to show what many of these mansions were like. Associated with this house as well as others are stories about love, murder and retribution. Another of these houses is the La Casa de la Marquesa (Marquesa House), which was an opulent residence that now serves as a hotel. The courtyard is in the Mudéjar or Spanish Moorish style, with Moorish arches and patterned walls. This area serves as the hotel&#x27;s lobby.

The Emperor Maximilian Memorial Chapel is on top of the Hill of Bells where Emperor Maximilian died.

<text>The C Eighth Avenue Local is a rapid transit service in the B Division of the New York City Subway. Its route emblem, or &quot;bullet&quot;, is since it is a part of the IND Eighth Avenue Line in Manhattan.

The C operates during daytime hours only between 168th Street in Washington Heights, Manhattan and Euclid Avenue in East New York, Brooklyn, making all stops along the full route; overnight service is replaced by the train, which makes all stops along the C&#x27;s route.

Historically, most C service ran only during rush hours, along the IND Concourse Line to Bedford Park Boulevard in the Bronx and later along the IND Rockaway Line to Rockaway Park–Beach 116th Street in Queens. Prior to 1985, the local C service was referred to as the CC, with the C designation reserved for a complementary express service that was discontinued in 1949. The CC was once the only route to serve the Bronx, Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens in a single trip. Outside of rush hour, local service in Manhattan was usually provided by the AA, later relabeled K, which ran between 168th Street and Chambers Street/World Trade Center. In 1988, the K and C were consolidated into one service, and during the 1990s, the C&#x27;s routing was altered to create the current service pattern. A 2015 study of the route found that the C had a daily ridership of 250,000.

== History ==
===Original IND service===
The AA and CC services were the predecessors to the current C service. A and AA service began on September 10, 1932, with the opening of the first line of the Independent Subway System (IND), the Eighth Avenue Line. The IND used single letters to refer to express services and double letters for local services. The A ran express and the AA ran local from 168th Street to Chambers Street/World Trade Center, known at the time as Hudson Terminal. The AA ran at all times, and it was extended to 207th Street during nights and on Sundays when the A did not run. On February 1, 1933, the AA was extended to the newly-opened Jay Street–Borough Hall station when the A did not run, continuing to terminate at Chambers Street when the A did run.

The C and CC services began operation on July 1, 1933, when the IND Concourse Line opened. The CC provided local service between Bedford Park Boulevard and Hudson Terminal during rush hours, and was extended to 205th Street during non-rush hours. It replaced the AA as Eighth Avenue Local. The C ran express, from 205th Street to Bergen Street in Brooklyn during rush hours, running express on the Concourse Line in the peak direction. C trains left Bergen Street between 3:30 p.m. and 6:50 p.m., and left 205th Street between 6:33 a.m. and 11:26 a.m. C trains ran every 4 minutes during rush hours in the peak direction, and every 5 minutes in the reverse-peak direction, and ran with 6- and 7-car trains. During morning rush hours, CC trains operated to 205th Street until 7:30 a.m., and to Tremont Avenue between 7:30 a.m. and 11:30 a.m.. PM rush hour CC trains terminated at Bedford Park Boulevard, and several other trains terminated and originated at Bedford Park Boulevard. CC trains ran every 4 minutes during rush hours, 5 minutes during middays, every 5 and 6 trains during evenings, and every 12 minutes overnight. Trains ran with 5 cars during rush hours, and with 3 cars other times. On August 17, 1933, CC trains stopped terminating at Tremont Avenue. Beginning August 19, 1933, C service was cut back from Bergen Street, but started operating during non-rush hours. At the same time, CC service was cut back from 205th Street during non-rush hours.

On January 1, 1936, C service was extended to Jay Street–Borough Hall. On April 9, 1936, C service was extended to Hoyt–Schermerhorn Streets. After July 1, 1937, a few C trains continued to run to Bergen Street southbound in the morning rush hour and northbound in the evening rush hour. Also on the same date, weekend C service was discontinued, and CC service was extended to 205th Street to compensate.

===IND Sixth Avenue Line opens===

On December 15, 1940, the IND Sixth Avenue Line opened. Two new services, the BB (later ) and , began running. These lines ran on the Eighth Avenue Line in upper Manhattan, switching to the Sixth Avenue Line in Midtown. The BB ran local to 168th Street during rush hours. The D joined the C as the peak direction Concourse Express. CC trains now ran between Hudson Terminal and Bedford Park during rush hours and on Saturdays and during other times, the D made local stops in the Bronx, replacing CC service. On the same date, limited morning rush hour service began between 205th Street, Bronx and Utica Avenue, Brooklyn, making local stops on the IND Fulton Street Line. AA service was reinstated during this time, but only during off-peak hours (non-rush hours, late Saturday afternoons and Sundays) when the BB and CC did not operate. The CC would provide Eighth Avenue Line local service during rush hours, with the AA replacing it during off-peak hours, mostly unchanged until 1988.

In the 1940s, C trains ran every 10 minutes during rush hour, CC trains ran every 4 minutes, and D trains ran every 5 minutes.

On October 24, 1949, C express service was discontinued. Additional D service was added to offset this loss. The CC, which only ran during rush hours, began terminating at Broadway–Lafayette Street Mondays to Fridays, and on Saturdays CC service continued to operate to Hudson Terminal. On December 29, 1951, Saturday CC service was discontinued. Weekday CC service returned to its previous terminal at Hudson Terminal on October 30, 1954.

On August 30, 1976, the CC train replaced the train as the rush-hour local along the IND Fulton Street Line and IND Rockaway Line, running from Rockaway Park–Beach 116th Street in Queens through Brooklyn and Manhattan to Bedford Park Boulevard in the Bronx, making it the only service to run through all four boroughs served by the subway. The Rockaway Park Shuttle HH was renamed CC. This shuttle ran between Broad Channel and Rockaway Park during off-peak hours, except late nights. With this, all daytime service to and from Rockaway Park was named CC. Late nights, the shuttle ran between Euclid Avenue, Rockaway Park and Far Rockaway–Mott Avenue via Hammels Wye, and was labeled A.

On August 28, 1977, late night AA service was eliminated. The A began making local stops in Manhattan during late nights, when the AA was not running.

On May 6, 1985, the IND practice of using double letters to indicate local service was discontinued. The AA was renamed the K and rush hour CC service was renamed C. The off-peak Rockaway Park Shuttle was renamed . This change was not officially reflected in schedules until May 24, 1987.


===Modern service consolidations===
On December 10, 1988, the K designation was discontinued and merged into the C, which now ran at all times except late nights. The C ran from Bedford Park Boulevard to Rockaway Park during rush hours, 145th Street to Euclid Avenue during middays, and from 145th Street to World Trade Center during evenings and weekends. The A now ran express in Brooklyn during middays, and the B was extended to 168th Street during middays and early evenings.

In January 1991, a reduction of service along the Central Park West, Eighth Avenue and Fulton Street corridors to remove excess capacity was proposed. Initially, the C designation would be eliminated, being replaced by the A making local stops in Manhattan and Brooklyn between 168th Street and Euclid Avenue. The service change was later amended to retain the C designation but with a new service pattern: service would operate local between 168th Street and Euclid Avenue during weekday rush hours and middays, with weekday evening and weekend daytime service extended beyond 168th Street and originate and terminate at 207th Street, and daily late night service extended beyond Euclid Avenue to operate to and from Mott Avenue in Queens. This service change would have been implemented in October 1991, pending approval from the MTA board.

On October 23, 1992, rush hour C service was cut back from Rockaway Park–Beach 116th Street to Euclid Avenue. The 1992 change introduced five A trips in each direction run from 59th Street–Columbus Circle to Rockaway Park during rush hours, with the Rockaway Park Shuttle (renamed from H to S) operating between Broad Channel and Rockaway Park at all times.

On May 29, 1994, weekend service between 7 a.m. and 11 p.m. was extended to Washington Heights–168th Street (effectively recreating the old AA) to allow A trains to run express. Beginning April 30, 1995, C service was extended to 168th Street during middays as construction on the Manhattan Bridge cut B service from Manhattan. On November 11, 1995, midday service was cut back to 145th Street after B service to 168th Street was restored.

The B and the C, which both ran local along Central Park West, switched northern terminals on March 1, 1998, ending the connection between the C and the Bronx. Instead of alternating between three different terminals depending on the time of day, all C service now terminated at 168th Street. The change was made to reduce crowding on the C and to reduce passenger confusion about the C&#x27;s route.

Starting on May 1, 1999, C trains were extended to Euclid Avenue on evenings and weekends. The 1999 change had the C run local in Brooklyn and Manhattan and the A run express at all times except late nights. This service change was made due to construction taking place on the Williamsburg Bridge, which prohibited the J, M, and Z from entering Manhattan; as a result, service on the C, as well as the A and lines were increased. This service change to the C was made permanent after the Williamsburg Bridge reopened to J, M and Z trains.

In the wake of the September 11, 2001, attacks, World Trade Center station was temporarily not usable as a terminal for the E. C service was suspended until September 24. Local service along Central Park West was replaced by the A and D, and the E was extended from Canal Street to Euclid Avenue replacing C service in Brooklyn.

On January 23, 2005, a fire at the Chambers Street signal room crippled A and C service. C service was suspended until February 2 and was replaced by the A, B, D, E, and V along different parts of its route. Initial assessments suggested that it would take several years to restore normal service, but the damaged equipment was replaced with available spare parts, allowing normal service to resume on April 21.

From March 29, 2020, to April 29, 2020, C trains were suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City, and A trains to Lefferts Boulevard ran local in their place. The cutbacks meant that wait times during rush hours increased from 8 to 12 minutes. In March 2021, TWU 100, the union for subway workers, sued the MTA in order to prevent the reduced frequencies from being permanent. That same month, the MTA decided to bring back full C service; full service was restored in mid-2021.

==Maintenance and rider issues==
===Criticism===
In August 2012, the Straphangers Campaign rated the C train the worst of the city&#x27;s subway services for the fourth straight year. No other service had ranked worst for more than three years in a row. The group found that the C performed worst in three of the six categories in its annual &quot;State of the Subways Report Card&quot;: amount of scheduled service, interior cleanliness, and breakdown rate. It also ranked next-to-worst in car announcement quality, after the 7, but performed above average in regularity of service and crowding. &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the C the &quot;least loved of New York City subway lines&quot;, citing its fleet of R32s, which were almost 50 years old at the time the &quot;Times&quot; reported on the issue. &quot;The New York Times&quot; has also stated that the C train &quot;rattled and clanked along the deteriorating maze of tracks beneath the city, tin-clad markers of years of neglect.&quot; In 2017, the &quot;Times&quot; referred to the R32s on the C as the world&#x27;s oldest subway cars &quot;in continuous daily operation&quot;. The R32s were initially retired in late April 2020, but were temporarily pressed back into service from July through October 2020 and finally retired in early January 2022.

===Improvements===

In 2011, problems with the R32s were at a peak as the fleet&#x27;s failure rate was rising steadily. In 2012, money was directed to replace the R32 with the R179. Bombardier Transportation won the $600 million contract to build 300 new cars. The R179s were expected to replace the R32s with some being allocated to the C. However, delivery of the R179s was delayed until 2017 and the R32s momentarily remained in service after the order was completed, so stopgap measures were implemented.

In the 2010s, all trains on the C were only long, partially due to lower ridership levels on the route, according to NYC Transit&#x27;s Rapid Transit Loading Guideline. This contrasted with trains on the rest of the mainline B Division (except for the Eastern Division and the train), which are long. During summer 2010, some 600-foot-long R44 trains ran on the C, displacing some R32s, whose air conditioning units were repaired. In the summers of 2011 and 2012, some 600-foot-long R46 trains were used on the C, while the R32s were used on the A, which had significant outdoor sections where the air conditioning units did not have to be used. In the summers of 2013 and 2014 as well as from May 2015 to February 2019, some 480-foot-long R160As ran on the C, covering half of its fleet, because of the R32s&#x27; continuously aging air compressors caused by the entirely underground C route. Concurrently, some R32s in exchange were transferred to East New York Yard, where they were used on the mostly outdoor . In late 2017, after several failed proposals to permanently lengthen C trains as ridership increased, some 600-foot-long R46 trains were reassigned to the C, displacing some more R32s to the A.

On November 6, 2018, some 480-foot-long R179 trains started running on the C, gradually displacing the R160As back to East New York Yard by February 6, 2019. The R179s periodically experienced major mechanical and technical issues, forcing the MTA to remove them from service. The R211 fleet, which is being delivered , also runs on the C; two 600-foot-long R211T trains with open gangways began running on the C in February 2024.

Service frequencies on the C were increased after the New York state government provided funding for the changes in mid-2023. On August 7 of that year, midday service was increased to run every eight minutes instead of every ten minutes. There was supposed to be another service increase during the evening starting in December 2023, but , this service increase has not happened.

<text>Tisquantum (; 1585 (±10 years?) – November 30, 1622 O.S.), more commonly known as Squanto (), was a member of the Patuxet tribe of Wampanoags, best known for being an early liaison between the Native American population in Southern New England and the &quot;Mayflower&quot; Pilgrims who made their settlement at the site of Tisquantum&#x27;s former summer village, now Plymouth, Massachusetts. The Patuxet tribe had lived on the western coast of Cape Cod Bay, but were wiped out by an epidemic, traditionally assumed to be smallpox brought by previous European explorers; however, recent findings suggest that the disease was Leptospirosis, a bacterial infection transmitted to humans typically via &quot;dirty water&quot; or soil contaminated with the waste product of infected, often domestic animals. 

Tisquantum was kidnapped by English explorer and slaver Captain Thomas Hunt, who trafficked him to Spain, where he sold him in the city of Málaga. He was among several captives traditionally claimed to have been ransomed by local Franciscan friars who focused on their education and evangelization. Tisquantum is said to have been baptized a Catholic, although no known primary sources support this claim. He eventually travelled to England and from there returned to his native village in America in 1619, only to find that an epidemic infection had wiped out his tribe; Tisquantum was the last of the Patuxet and went to live with the Wampanoags.

The &quot;Mayflower&quot; landed in Cape Cod Bay in 1620, and Tisquantum worked to broker peaceable relations between the Pilgrims and the local Pokanokets. He played a crucial role in the early meetings in March 1621, partly because he spoke English. He then lived with the Pilgrims for 20 months as an interpreter, guide, and advisor. He introduced the settlers to the fur trade and taught them how to sow and fertilize native crops; this proved vital because the seeds the Pilgrims had brought from England mostly failed. As food shortages worsened, Plymouth Colony Governor William Bradford relied on Tisquantum to pilot a ship of settlers on a trading expedition around Cape Cod and through dangerous shoals. During that voyage, Tisquantum contracted what Bradford called an &quot;Indian fever&quot;. Bradford stayed with him for several days until he died, which Bradford described as a &quot;great loss&quot;.

== Name ==

Documents from the 17th century variously render the spelling of Tisquantum&#x27;s name as &quot;Tisquantum&quot;, &quot;Tasquantum&quot;, and &quot;Tusquantum&quot;, and alternately call him &quot;Squanto&quot;, &quot;Squantum&quot;, &quot;Tantum&quot;, and &quot;Tantam&quot;. Even the two &quot;Mayflower&quot; settlers who dealt with him closely spelled his name differently; Bradford nicknamed him &quot;Squanto&quot;, while Edward Winslow invariably referred to him as &quot;Tisquantum&quot;, which historians believe was his proper name. One suggestion of the meaning is that it is derived from the Algonquian expression for &quot;the rage of the Manitou&quot;, &quot;the world-suffusing spiritual power at the heart of coastal Indians&#x27; religious beliefs&quot;. Manitou was &quot;the spiritual potency of an object&quot; or &quot;a phenomenon&quot;, the force which made &quot;everything in Nature responsive to man&quot;. Other suggestions have been offered, but all involve some relationship to beings or powers that the colonists associated with the devil or evil. It is, therefore, unlikely that it was his birth name rather than one that he acquired or assumed later in life, but there is no historical evidence on this point. The name may suggest, for example, that he underwent special spiritual and military training and was selected for his role as liaison with the settlers in 1620 for that reason.

==Early life==
Almost nothing is known of Tisquantum&#x27;s life before his first contact with Europeans, and even when and how that first encounter took place is subject to contradictory assertions. First-hand descriptions of him written between 1618 and 1622 do not remark on his youth or old age, and Salisbury has suggested that he was in his twenties or thirties when he was captured and taken to Spain in 1614. If that was the case, he would have been born around 1585 (±10 years).

===Native culture===

The tribes who lived in southern New England at the beginning of the 17th century referred to themselves as &quot;Ninnimissinuok&quot;, a variation of the Narragansett word &quot;Ninnimissinnȗwock&quot; meaning &quot;people&quot; and signifying &quot;familiarity and shared identity&quot;. Tisquantum&#x27;s tribe of the Patuxets occupied the coastal area west of Cape Cod Bay, and he told an English trader that the Patuxets once numbered 2,000. They spoke a dialect of Eastern Algonquian common to tribes as far west as Narragansett Bay. The various Algonquian dialects of Southern New England were sufficiently similar to allow effective communications. The term &quot;patuxet&quot; refers to the site of Plymouth, Massachusetts, and means &quot;at the little falls&quot; referencing Morison. Morison gives &quot;Mourt&#x27;s Relation&quot; as authority for both assertions.

The annual growing season in southern Maine and Canada was not long enough to produce maize harvests. Indian tribes in those areas were required to live a fairly nomadic existence, while the southern New England Algonquins were &quot;sedentary cultivators&quot; by contrast. They grew enough for their own winter needs and for trade, especially to northern tribes, and enough to relieve the colonists&#x27; distress for many years when their harvests were insufficient.

The groups that made up the Ninnimissinuok were presided over by one or two sachems. The chief functions of the sachems were to allocate land for cultivation, to manage the trade with other sachems or more distant tribes, to dispense justice (including capital punishment), to collect and store tribute from harvests and hunts, and leading in war.

Sachems were advised by &quot;principal men&quot; of the community called &quot;ahtaskoaog&quot;, generally called &quot;nobles&quot; by the colonists. Sachems achieved consensus through the consent of these men, who probably also were involved in the selection of new sachems. One or more principal men were generally present when sachems ceded land. There was a class called the &quot;pniesesock&quot; among the Pokanokets which collected the annual tribute to the sachem, led warriors into battle, and had a special relationship with their god Abbomocho (Hobbomock) who was invoked in &quot;pow wows&quot; for healing powers, a force that the colonists equated with the devil. The priest class came from this order, and the shamans also acted as orators, giving them political power within their societies. Salisbury has suggested that Tisquantum was a &quot;pniesesock&quot;. This class may have produced something of a praetorian guard, equivalent to the &quot;valiant men&quot; described by Roger Williams among the Narragansetts, the only Southern New England society with an elite class of warriors. In addition to the class of commoners (&quot;sanops&quot;), there were outsiders who attached themselves to a tribe. They had few rights except the expectation of protection against any common enemy.

==Contact with Europeans==
The Ninnimissinuok had sporadic contact with European explorers for nearly a century before the landing of the &quot;Mayflower&quot; in 1620. The fishermen off the Newfoundland banks from Bristol, Normandy, and Brittany began making annual spring visits beginning as early as 1581 to bring cod to Southern Europe. These early encounters had long-term effects. Europeans very likely introduced diseases for which the Indian population had no resistance. When the &quot;Mayflower&quot; arrived, the Pilgrims discovered that an entire village was devoid of inhabitants. European fur traders traded goods with different tribes, and this exacerbated intertribal rivalries and hostilities.

===First kidnappings===

In 1605, George Weymouth set out on an expedition to explore the possibility of settlement in upper New England, sponsored by Henry Wriothesley and Thomas Arundell. They had a chance encounter with a hunting party, then decided to kidnap a number of Indians. The capture of Indians was &quot;a matter of great importance for the full accomplement of our voyage&quot;.

They took five captives to England and gave three to Sir Ferdinando Gorges. Gorges was an investor in the Weymouth voyage and became the chief promoter of the scheme when Arundell withdrew from the project. Gorges wrote of his delight in Weymouth&#x27;s kidnapping, and named Tisquantum as one of the three given to him.

Captain George Weymouth, having failed at finding a Northwest Passage, happened into a River on the Coast of &quot;America&quot;, called &quot;Pemmaquid&quot;, from whence he brought five of the Natives, three of whose names were &quot;Manida&quot;, &quot;Sellwarroes&quot;, and &quot;Tasquantum&quot;, whom I seized upon, they were all of one Nation, but of severall parts, and severall Families; This accident must be acknowledged the meanes under God of putting on foote, and giving life to all our Plantations.

However, it is unlikely that the &quot;Tasquantum&quot; identified by Gorges refers to the same man. Circumstantial evidence makes this nearly impossible. The Indians taken by Weymouth and given to Gorges were Eastern Abenaki from Maine, whereas the subject Tisquantum was Patuxet, a Southern New England Algonquin. He lived in Plymouth, and the &quot;Archangel&quot; did not sail that far south on the voyage of 1605. Adams maintains that &quot;it is not supposable that a member of the Pokánoket [Patuxet] tribe would be passing the summer of 1605 in a visit among his deadly enemies the Tarratines, whose language was not even intelligible to him ... and be captured as one of a party of them in the way described by Rosier.&quot; No modern historian entertains this supposition.

===Abduction===

In 1614, an English expedition headed by John Smith sailed along the coast of Maine and Massachusetts Bay collecting fish and furs. Smith returned to England in one of the vessels and left Thomas Hunt in command of the second ship. Hunt was to complete the haul of cod and proceed to Málaga, Spain, where there was a market for dried fish, but Hunt decided to enhance the value of his shipment by adding human cargo. He sailed to Plymouth harbor ostensibly to trade with the village of Patuxet, where he lured 20 Indians aboard his vessel under promise of trade, including Tisquantum. Once aboard, they were confined and the ship sailed across Cape Cod Bay where Hunt abducted seven more from the Nausets. He then set sail for Málaga.

Smith and Gorges both disapproved of Hunt&#x27;s decision to enslave the Indians. Gorges worried about the prospect of &quot;a warre now new begun between the inhabitants of those parts, and us&quot;, although he seemed mostly concerned about whether this event had upset his gold-finding plans with Epenow on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard. Smith suggested that Hunt got his just deserts because &quot;this wilde act kept him ever after from any more imploiment to those parts.&quot;
According to Gorges, Hunt took the Indians to the Strait of Gibraltar where he sold as many as he could. But the &quot;Friers (&quot;sic&quot;) of those parts&quot; discovered what he was doing, and they took the remaining Indians to be &quot;instructed in the Christian Faith; and so disappointed this unworthy fellow of his hopes of gaine&quot;. 

No truly primary sources of Tisquantum&#x27;s arrival in Spain were known to exist until Spanish researcher Ms. Purificación Ruiz uncovered two deeds in public archives in Málaga, documenting the facts with original notarial records. It turns out that on October 22nd, 1614 one Thomas Hunt sold a grand total of twenty-five Native Americans to Juan Bautista Reales, a larger-than-life adventurer well known to historians for having been at the same time Catholic priest, businessman and spy. The sale of the captives was thinly disguised owing to its illegal nature, because while slavery of North African captives was rampant, enslavement of Native Americans was against the law. Further research by Ms. Ruiz indeed found two more notarial records showing that only two weeks later Málaga&#x27;s &quot;Corregidor&quot; had regained control of twenty captives and distributed them among a number of local notables, with orders to have them educated in the Catholic faith and local mores. No further documents have been found but research continues and there is some hope that any hitherto undocumented involvement of Spanish friars or other individuals may be brought to light.

No records show how long Tisquantum lived in Spain, what he did there, or how he &quot;got away for England&quot;, as Bradford puts it. Prowse asserts that he spent four years in slavery in Spain and was then smuggled aboard a ship belonging to Guy&#x27;s colony, taken to England, and then to Newfoundland. Smith attested that Tisquantum lived in England &quot;a good time&quot;, although he does not say what he was doing there. Plymouth Governor William Bradford knew him best and recorded that he lived in Cornhill, London with &quot;Master John Slanie&quot;. Slany was a merchant and shipbuilder who became another of the merchant adventurers of London hoping to make money from colonizing projects in America and was an investor in the East India Company.

===Return to New England===
According to the report by the Plymouth Council for New England in 1622, Tisquantum was in Newfoundland &quot;with Captain &quot;Mason&quot; Governor there for the undertaking of that Plantation&quot;. Thomas Dermer was at Cuper&#x27;s Cove in Conception Bay, an adventurer who had accompanied Smith on his abortive 1615 voyage to New England. Tisquantum and Dermer talked of New England while in Newfoundland, and Tisquantum persuaded him that he could make his fortune there, and Dermer wrote Gorges and requested that Gorges send him a commission to act in New England.
Toward the end of 1619, Dermer and Tisquantum sailed down the New England coast to Massachusetts Bay. They discovered that all inhabitants had died in Tisquantum&#x27;s home village at Patucket, so they moved inland to the village of Nemasket. Dermer sent Tisquantum to the village of Pokanoket near Bristol, Rhode Island, seat of Chief Massasoit. A few days later, Massasoit arrived at Nemasket along with Tisquantum and 50 warriors. It is not known whether Tisquantum and Massasoit had met prior to these events, but their interrelations can be traced at least to this date.

Dermer returned to Nemasket in June 1620, but this time he discovered that the Indians there bore &quot;an inveterate malice to the English&quot;, according to a June 30, 1620, letter transcribed by Bradford. This sudden and dramatic change from friendliness to hostility was due to an incident the previous year, when a European coastal vessel lured some Indians on board with the promise of trade, only to mercilessly slaughter them. Dermer wrote that &quot;Squanto cannot deny but they would have killed me when I was in Nemask, had he not entreated hard for me.&quot;

Some time after this encounter, Indians attacked Dermer, Tisquantum and their party on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard. Dermer received &quot;14 mortal wounds in the process&quot;. He fled to Virginia where he died. Sometime after this, Tisquantum fell in with the Pokanokets (neighbors of his native village), and was living with them by March 1622 when he was introduced to the Pilgrims.

==Plymouth Colony==
The Massachusett Indians were north of Plymouth Colony, led by Chief Massasoit, and the Pokanoket tribe were north, east, and south. Tisquantum was living with the Pokanokets, as his native tribe of the Patuxets had been effectively wiped out prior to the arrival of the &quot;Mayflower&quot;; indeed, the Pilgrims had established the Patuxets former habitation as the site of Plymouth Colony. The Narragansett tribe inhabited Rhode Island.

Massasoit was faced with the dilemma whether to form an alliance with the Plymouth colonists, who might protect him from the Narragansetts, or try to put together a tribal coalition to drive out the colonists. To decide the issue, according to Bradford&#x27;s account, &quot;they got all the Powachs of the country, for three days together in a horrid and devilish manner, to curse and execrate them with their conjurations, which assembly and service they held in a dark and dismal swamp.&quot; Philbrick sees this as a convocation of shamans brought together to drive the colonists from the shores by supernatural means. Tisquantum had lived in England, and he told Massassoit &quot;what wonders he had seen&quot; there. He urged Massasoit to become friends with the Plymouth colonists, because his enemies would then be &quot;Constrained to bowe to him&quot;. Also connected to Massasoit was Samoset, a minor Abenaki sachem who hailed from the Muscongus Bay area of Maine. Samoset (a mispronunciation of Somerset) had learned English in England as a captive of the Merchant Tailors Guild.
On Friday, March 16, 1621 (Old Style), the settlers were conducting military training when Samoset &quot;boldly came alone&quot; into the settlement. The colonists were initially alarmed, but he immediately set their fears at ease by asking for beer. He spent the day giving them intelligence of the surrounding tribes, then stayed for the night, leaving on Saturday morning. The next day, Samoset returned with five men all bearing deer skins and one cat skin. The settlers entertained them but refused to trade with them because it was Sunday, although they encouraged them to return with more furs. All left but Samoset who lingered until Wednesday, feigning illness. He returned once more on Thursday, March 22, 1621, this time with Tisquantum. The men brought important news: Massasoit, his brother Quadrquina, and all of their men were close by. After an hour&#x27;s discussion, the sachem and his train of 60 men appeared on Strawberry Hill. Both the colonists and Massasoit&#x27;s men were unwilling to make the first move, but Tisquantum shuttled between the groups and effected the simple protocol which permitted Edward Winslow to approach the sachem. Winslow, with Tisquantum as translator, proclaimed the loving and peaceful intentions of King James and the desire of their governor to trade and make peace with him. After Massasoit ate, Miles Standish led him to a house which was furnished with pillows and a rug. Governor Carver then came &quot;with Drumme and Trumpet after him&quot; to meet Massasoit. The parties ate together, then negotiated a treaty of peace and mutual defense between the Plymouth settlers and the Pokanoket people. According to Bradford, &quot;all the while he sat by the Governour, he trembled for feare&quot;. Massasoit&#x27;s followers applauded the treaty, and the peace terms were kept by both parties during Massasoit&#x27;s lifetime.

=== Guide to frontier survival ===
Massasoit and his men left the day after the treaty, but Samoset and Tisquantum remained. Tisquantum and Bradford developed a close friendship, and Bradford relied on him heavily during his years as governor of the colony. Bradford considered him &quot;a special instrument sent of God for their good beyond their expectation&quot;. Tisquantum instructed them in survival skills and acquainted them with their environment. &quot;He directed them how to set their corn, where to take fish, and to procure other commodities, and was also their pilot to bring them to unknown places for their profit, and never left them till he died.&quot;

The day after Massasoit left Plymouth, Tisquantum spent the day at Eel River treading eels out of the mud with his feet. The bucketful of eels he brought back were &quot;fat and sweet&quot;. Collection of eels became part of the settlers&#x27; annual practice. But Bradford makes special mention of Tisquantum&#x27;s instruction concerning local horticulture. He had arrived at the time of planting for that year&#x27;s crops, and Bradford said that &quot;Squanto stood them in great stead, showing them both the manner how to set it, and after how to dress and tend it.&quot; Bradford wrote that Squanto showed them how to fertilize exhausted soil:

He told them, except they got fish and set with it [corn seed] in these old grounds it would come to nothing. And he showed them that in the middle of April they should have store enough [of fish] come up the brook by which they began to build, and taught them how to take it, and where to get other provisions necessary for them. All of which they found true by trial and experience.

Edward Winslow made the same point about the value of Indian cultivation methods in a letter to England at the end of the year:

We set the last Spring some twentie Acres of &quot;Indian&quot; Corne, and sowed some six Acres of Barly and Pease; and according to the manner of the &quot;Indians&quot;, we manured our ground with Herings or rather Shadds, which we have in great abundance, and take with great ease at our doores. Our Corn did prove well, &amp; God be praysed, we had a good increase of &quot;Indian&quot;-Corne, and our Barly indifferent good, but our Pease were not worth the gathering, for we feared they were too late sowne.

The method shown by Tisquantum became the regular practice of the settlers. Tisquantum also showed the Plymouth colonists how they could obtain pelts with the &quot;few trifling commodities they brought with them at first&quot;. Bradford reported that there was not &quot;any amongst them that ever saw a beaver skin till they came here and were informed by Squanto&quot;. Fur trading became an important way for the colonists to pay off their financial debt to their financial sponsors in England.

===Role in settler diplomacy===

Thomas Morton stated that Massasoit was freed as a result of the peace treaty and &quot;suffered [Tisquantum] to live with the English&quot;, and Tisquantum remained loyal to the colonists. One commentator has suggested that the loneliness occasioned by the wholesale extinction of his people was the motive for his attachment to the Plymouth settlers. Another has suggested that it was self-interest that he conceived while in the captivity of the Pokanoket. The settlers were forced to rely on Tisquantum because he was the only means by which they could communicate with the surrounding Indians, and he was involved in every contact for the 20 months that he lived with them.

====Mission to Pokanoket====
Plymouth Colony decided in June that a mission to Massasoit in Pokatoket would enhance their security and reduce visits by Indians who drained their food resources. Winslow wrote that they wanted to ensure that the peace treaty was still valued by the Pokanoket and to reconnoiter the surrounding country and the strength of the various tribes. They also hoped to show their willingness to repay the grain that they took on Cape Cod the previous winter, in the words of Winslow to &quot;make satisfaction for some conceived injuries to be done on our parts&quot;.
Governor Bradford selected Edward Winslow and Stephen Hopkins to make the journey with Tisquantum. They set off on July 2 carrying a &quot;Horse-mans coat&quot; as a gift for Massasoit made of red cotton and trimmed &quot;with a slight lace&quot;. They also took a copper chain and a message expressing their desire to continue and strengthen the peace between the two peoples and explaining the purpose of the chain. The colony was uncertain of their first harvest, and they requested that Massasoit restrain his people from visiting Plymouth as frequently as they had—though they wished always to entertain any guest of Massasoit. So if he gave anyone the chain, they would know that the visitor was sent by him and they would always receive him. The message also attempted to explain the settlers&#x27; conduct on Cape Cod when they took some corn, and they requested that he send his men to the Nauset to express the settlers&#x27; wish to make restitution. They departed at 9 a.m., and traveled for two days meeting friendly Indians along the way. When they arrived at Pokanoket, Massasoit had to be sent for, and Winslow and Hopkins gave him a salute with their muskets when he arrived, at Tisquantum&#x27;s suggestion. Massasoit was grateful for the coat and assured them on all points that they made. He assured them that his 30 tributary villages would remain in peace and would bring furs to Plymouth. The colonists stayed for two days, then sent Tisquantum off to the various villages to seek trading partners for the English while they returned to Plymouth.

====Mission to the Nauset====
Winslow writes that young John Billington had wandered off and had not returned for five days. Bradford sent word to Massasoit, who made inquiry and found that the child had wandered into a Manumett village, who turned him over to the Nausets. Ten settlers set out and took Tisquantum as a translator and Tokamahamon as &quot;a special friend,&quot; in Winslow&#x27;s words. They sailed to Cummaquid by evening and spent the night anchored in the bay. In the morning, the two Indians on board were sent to speak to two Indians who were lobstering. They were told that the boy was at Nauset, and the Cape Cod Indians invited all the men to take food with them. The Plymouth colonists waited until the tide allowed the boat to reach the shore, and then they were escorted to sachem Iyanough who was in his mid-20s and &quot;very personable, gentle, courteous, and fayre conditioned, indeed not like a Savage&quot;, in Winslow&#x27;s words. The colonists were lavishly entertained, and Iyanough even agreed to accompany them to the Nausets. While in this village, they met an old woman, &quot;no lesse then an hundred yeeres old&quot;, who wanted to see the colonists, and she told them of how her two sons were kidnapped by Hunt at the same time that Tisquantum was, and she had not seen them since. Winslow assured her that they would never treat Indians that way and &quot;gave her some small trifles, which somewhat appeased her&quot;. After their lunch, the settlers took the boat to Nauset with the sachem and two of his band, but the tide prevented the boat from reaching shore, so the colonists sent Inyanough and Tisquantum to meet Nauset sachem Aspinet. The colonists remained in their shallop and Nauset men came &quot;very thick&quot; to entreat them to come ashore, but Winslow&#x27;s party was afraid because this was the very spot of the First Encounter. One of the Indians whose corn they had taken the previous winter came out to meet them, and they promised to reimburse him. That night, the sachem came with more than 100 men, the colonists estimated, and he bore the boy out to the shallop. The colonists gave Aspinet a knife and one to the man who carried the boy to the boat. By this, Winslow considered that &quot;they made peace with us.&quot;

The Nausets departed, but the colonists learned (probably from Tisquantum) that the Narragansetts had attacked the Pokanokets and taken Massasoit. This caused great alarm because their own settlement was not well guarded given that so many were on this mission. The men tried to set off immediately, but they had no fresh water. After stopping again at Iyanough&#x27;s village, they set off for Plymouth. This mission resulted in a working relationship between the Plymouth settlers and the Cape Cod Indians, both the Nausets and the Cummaquid, and Winslow attributed that outcome to Tisquantum. Bradford wrote that the Indians whose corn they had taken the previous winter came and received compensation, and peace generally prevailed.

====Action to save Tisquantum in Nemasket====

The men returned to Plymouth after rescuing the Billington boy, and it was confirmed to them that Massasoit had been ousted or taken by the Narragansetts. They also learned that Corbitant, a Pocasset sachem formerly tributary to Massasoit, was at Nemasket attempting to pry that band away from Massasoit. Corbitant was reportedly also railing against the peace initiatives that the Plymouth settlers had just had with the Cummaquid and the Nauset. Tisquantum was an object of Corbitant&#x27;s ire because of his role in mediating peace with the Cape Cod Indians, but also because he was the principal means by which the settlers could communicate with the Indians. &quot;If he were dead, the English had lost their tongue,&quot; he reportedly said. Hobomok was a Pokanoket &quot;pniese&quot; residing with the colonists, and he had also been threatened for his loyalty to Massasoit. Tisquantum and Hobomok were evidently too frightened to seek out Massasoit, and instead went to Nemasket to find out what they could. Tokamahamon, however, went looking for Massasoit. Corbitant discovered Tisquantum and Hobomok at Nemasket and captured them. He held Tisquantum with a knife to his breast, but Hobomok broke free and ran to Plymouth to alert them, thinking that Tisquantum had died.

Governor Bradford organized an armed task force of about a dozen men under the command of Miles Standish, and they set off before daybreak on August 14 under the guidance of Hobomok. The plan was to march the 14 miles to Nemasket, rest, and then take the village unawares in the night. The surprise was total, and the villagers were terrified. The colonists could not make the Indians understand that they were only looking for Corbitant, and there were &quot;three sore wounded&quot; trying to escape the house. The colonists realized that Tisquantum was unharmed and staying in the village, and that Corbitant and his men had returned to Pocaset. The colonists searched the dwelling, and Tisquantum came out after Hobomok called him from the top of the building. The settlers commandeered the house for the night. The next day, they explained to the village that they were interested only in Corbitant and those supporting him. They warned that they would exact retribution if Corbitant continued threatening them, or if Massasoit did not return from the Narragansetts, or if anyone attempted harm to any of Massasoit&#x27;s subjects, including Tisquantum and Hobomok. They then marched back to Plymouth with Nemasket villagers helping bear their equipment.

Bradford wrote that this action resulted in a firmer peace, and that &quot;divers sachems&quot; congratulated the settlers and more came to terms with them. Even Corbitant made his peace through Massasoit. Nathaniel Morton later recorded that nine sub-sachems came to Plymouth on September 13, 1621, and signed a document declaring themselves &quot;Loyal Subjects of King &quot;James&quot;, King of &quot;Great Britain&quot;, &quot;France&quot; and &quot;Ireland&quot;&quot;.

====Mission to the Massachuset people====
The Plymouth colonists resolved to meet with the Massachusetts Indians who had frequently threatened them. On August 18, a crew of ten settlers set off around midnight, with Tisquantum and two other Indians as interpreters, hoping to arrive before daybreak. But they misjudged the distance and were forced to anchor off shore and stay in the shallop over the next night. Once ashore, they found a woman coming to collect the trapped lobsters, and she told them where the villagers were. Tisquantum was sent to make contact, and they discovered that the sachem presided over a considerably reduced band of followers. His name was Obbatinewat, and he was a tributary of Massasoit. He explained that his current location within Boston harbor was not a permanent residence since he moved regularly to avoid the Tarentines and the &quot;Squa Sachim&quot; (the widow of Nanepashemet). Obbatinewat agreed to submit himself to King James in exchange for the colonists&#x27; promise to protect him from his enemies. He also took them to see the &quot;squa sachem&quot; across the Massachusetts Bay. 

On Friday, September 21, the colonists went ashore and marched a house where Nanepashemet was buried. They remained there and sent Tisquantum and another Indian to find the people. There were signs of hurried removal, but they found the women together with their corn and later a man who was brought trembling to the settlers. They assured him that they did not intend harm, and he agreed to trade furs with them. Tisquantum urged the colonists to simply &quot;rifle&quot; the women and take their skins on the ground, that &quot;they are a bad people and oft threatned you,&quot; but the colonists insisted on treating them fairly. The women followed the men to the shallop, selling them everything that they had, including the coats off their backs. As the colonists shipped off, they noticed that the many islands in the harbor had been inhabited, some cleared entirely, but all the inhabitants had died. They returned with &quot;a good quantity of beaver&quot;, but the men who had seen Boston Harbor expressed their regret that they had not settled there.

===Peace regime===
During the fall of 1621, the Plymouth settlers had every reason to be contented with their condition, less than one year after the &quot;starving times&quot;. Bradford expressed the sentiment with biblical allusion that they found &quot;the Lord to be with them in all their ways, and to bless their outgoings and incomings ...&quot; Winslow was more prosaic when he reviewed the political situation with respect to surrounding natives in December 1621: &quot;Wee have found the &quot;Indians&quot; very faithfull in their Covenant of Peace with us; very loving and readie to pleasure us ...,&quot; not only the greatest, Massasoit, &quot;but also all the Princes and peoples round about us&quot; for fifty miles. Even a sachem from Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, who they never saw, and also seven others came in to submit to King James &quot;so that there is now great peace amongst the &quot;Indians&quot; themselves, which was not formerly, neither would have bin but for us ...&quot;

====Thanksgiving====

Bradford wrote in his journal that come fall together with their harvest of Indian corn, they had abundant fish and fowl, including many turkeys they took in addition to venison. He affirmed that the reports of plenty that many report &quot;to their friends in England&quot; were not &quot;feigned but true reports&quot;. He did not, however, describe any harvest festival with their native allies. Winslow, however, did, and the letter which was included in &quot;Mourt&#x27;s Relation&quot; became the basis for the tradition of &quot;the first Thanksgiving&quot;.

Winslow&#x27;s description of what was later celebrated as the first Thanksgiving was quite short. He wrote that after the harvest (of Indian corn, their planting of peas were not worth gathering and their harvest of barley was &quot;indifferent&quot;), Bradford sent out four men fowling &quot;so we might after a more special manner rejoice together, after we had gathered the fruit of our labours ...&quot; The time was one of recreation, including the shooting of arms, and many Natives joined them, including Massasoit and 90 of his men, who stayed three days. They killed five deer which they presented to Bradford, Standish and others in Plymouth. Winslow concluded his description by telling his readers that &quot;we are so farre from want, that we often wish you partakers of our plentie.&quot;

====The Narragansett threat====
The various treaties created a system where the English settlers filled the vacuum created by the epidemic. The villages and tribal networks surrounding Plymouth now saw themselves as tributaries to the English and (as they were assured) King James. The settlers also viewed the treaties as committing the Natives to a form of vassalage. Nathaniel Morton, Bradford&#x27;s nephew, interpreted the original treaty with Massasoit, for example, as &quot;at the same time&quot; (not within the written treaty terms) acknowledging himeself &quot;content to become the Subject of our Sovereign Lord the King aforesaid, His Heirs and Successors, and gave unto them all the Lands adjacent, to them and their Heirs for ever&quot;. The problem with this political and commercial system was that it &quot;incurred the resentment of the Narragansett by depriving them of tributaries just when Dutch traders were expanding their activities in the [Narragansett] bay&quot;. In January 1622 the Narraganset responded by issuing an ultimatum to the English.
In December 1621 the &quot;Fortune&quot; (which had brought 35 more settlers) had departed for England. Not long afterwards rumors began to reach Plymouth that the Narragansett were making warlike preparations against the English. Winslow believed that that nation had learned that the new settlers brought neither arms nor provisions and thus in fact weakened the English colony. Bradford saw their belligerency as a result of their desire to &quot;lord it over&quot; the peoples who had been weakened by the epidemic (and presumably obtain tribute from them) and the colonists were &quot;a bar in their way&quot;. In January 1621/22 a messenger from Narraganset sachem Canonicus (who travelled with Tokamahamon, Winslow&#x27;s &quot;special friend&quot;) arrived looking for Tisquantum, who was away from the settlement. Winslow wrote that the messenger appeared relieved and left a bundle of arrows wrapped in a rattlesnake skin. Rather than let him depart, however, Bradford committed him to the custody of Standish. The captain asked Winslow, who had a &quot;speciall familiaritie&quot; with other Indians, to see if he could get anything out of the messenger. The messenger would not be specific but said that he believed &quot;they were enemies to us.&quot; That night Winslow and another (probably Hopkins) took charge of him. After his fear subsided, the messenger told him that the messenger who had come from Canonicus last summer to treat for peace, returned and persuaded the sachem on war. Canonicus was particularly aggrieved by the &quot;meannesse&quot; of the gifts sent him by the English, not only in relation to what he sent to colonists but also in light of his own greatness. On obtaining this information, Bradford ordered the messenger released.

When Tisquantum returned he explained that the meaning of the arrows wrapped in snake skin was enmity; it was a challenge. After consultation, Bradford stuffed the snake skin with powder and shot and had a Native return it to Canonicus with a defiant message. Winslow wrote that the returned emblem so terrified Canonicus that he refused to touch it, and that it passed from hand to hand until, by a circuitous route, it was returned to Plymouth.

===Double dealing===
Notwithstanding the colonists&#x27; bold response to the Narragansett challenge, the settlers realized their defenselessness to attack. Bradford instituted a series of measures to secure Plymouth. Most important they decided to enclose the settlement within a pale (probably much like what was discovered surrounding Nenepashemet&#x27;s fort). They shut the inhabitants within gates that were locked at night, and a night guard was posted. Standish divided the men into four squadrons and drilled them in where to report in the event of alarm. They also came up with a plan of how to respond to fire alarms so as to have a sufficient armed force to respond to possible Native treachery. The fence around the settlement required the most effort since it required felling suitable large trees, digging holes deep enough to support the large timbers and securing them close enough to each other to prevent penetration by arrows. This work had to be done in the winter and at a time too when the settlers were on half rations because of the new and unexpected settlers. The work took more than a month to complete.

====False alarms====
By the beginning of March, the fortification of the settlement had been accomplished. It was now time when the settlers had promised the Massachuset they would come to trade for furs. They received another alarm however, this time from Hobomok, who was still living with them. Hobomok told of his fear that the Massachuset had joined in a confederacy with the Narraganset and if Standish and his men went there, they would be cut off and at the same time the Narraganset would attack the settlement at Plymouth. Hobomok also told them that Tisquantum was part of this conspiracy, that he learned this from other Natives he met in the woods and that the settlers would find this out when Tisquantum would urge the settlers into the Native houses &quot;for their better advantage&quot;. This allegation must have come as a shock to the English given that Tisquantum&#x27;s conduct for nearly a year seemed to have aligned him perfectly with the English interest both in helping to pacify surrounding societies and in obtaining goods that could be used to reduce their debt to the settlers&#x27; financial sponsors. Bradford consulted with his advisors, and they concluded that they had to make the mission despite this information. The decision was made partly for strategic reasons. If the colonists cancelled the promised trip out of fear and instead stayed shut up &quot;in our new-enclosed towne&quot;, they might encourage even more aggression. But the main reason they had to make the trip was that their &quot;Store was almost emptie&quot; and without the corn they could obtain by trading &quot;we could not long subsist ...&quot; The governor therefore deputed Standish and 10 men to make the trip and sent along both Tisquantum and Hobomok, given &quot;the jealousy between them&quot;.

Not long after the shallop departed, &quot;an Indian belonging to Squanto&#x27;s family&quot; came running in. He betrayed signs of great fear, constantly looking behind him as if someone &quot;were at his heels&quot;. He was taken to Bradford to whom he told that many of the Narraganset together with Corbitant &quot;and he thought Massasoit&quot; were about to attack Plymouth. Winslow (who was not there but wrote closer to the time of the incident than did Bradford) gave even more graphic details: The Native&#x27;s face was covered in fresh blood which he explained was a wound he received when he tried speaking up for the settlers. In this account he said that the combined forces were already at Nemasket and were set on taking advantage of the opportunity supplied by Standish&#x27;s absence. Bradford immediately put the settlement on military readiness and had the ordnance discharge three rounds in the hope that the shallop had not gone too far. Because of calm seas Standish and his men had just reached Gurnet&#x27;s Nose, heard the alarm and quickly returned. When Hobomok first heard the news he &quot;said flatly that it was false ...&quot; Not only was he assured of Massasoit&#x27;s faithfulness, he knew that his being a &quot;pniese&quot; meant he would have been consulted by Massasoit before he undertook such a scheme. To make further sure Hobomok volunteered his wife to return to Pokanoket to assess the situation for herself. At the same time Bradford had the watch maintained all that night, but there were no signs of Natives, hostile or otherwise.

Hobomok&#x27;s wife found the village of Pokanoket quiet with no signs of war preparations. She then informed Massasoit of the commotion at Plymouth. The sachem was &quot;much offended at the carriage of Tisquantum&quot; but was grateful for Bradford&#x27;s trust in him [Massasoit]. He also sent word back that he would send word to the governor, pursuant to the first article of the treaty they had entered, if any hostile actions were preparing.

====Allegations against Tisquantum====
Winslow writes that &quot;by degrees wee began to discover &quot;Tisquantum&quot;,&quot; but he does not describe the means or over what period of time this discovery took place. There apparently was no formal proceeding. The conclusion reached, according to Winslow, was that Tisquantum had been using his proximity and apparent influence over the English settlers &quot;to make himselfe great in the eyes of&quot; local Natives for his own benefit. Winslow explains that Tisquantum convinced locals that he had the ability to influence the English toward peace or war and that he frequently extorted Natives by claiming that the settlers were about to kill them in order &quot;that thereby hee might get gifts to himself to work their peace ...&quot;

Bradford&#x27;s account agrees with Winslow&#x27;s to this point, and he also explains where the information came from: &quot;by the former passages, and other things of like nature&quot;, evidently referring to rumors Hobomok said he heard in the woods. Winslow goes much further in his charge, however, claiming that Tisquantum intended to sabotage the peace with Massasoit by false claims of Massasoit aggression &quot;hoping whilest things were hot in the heat of bloud, to provoke us to march into his Country against him, whereby he hoped to kindle such a flame as would not easily be quenched, and hoping if that blocke were once removed, there were no other betweene him and honour&quot; which he preferred over life and peace. Winslow later remembered &quot;one notable (though) wicked practice of this &quot;Tisquantum&quot;&quot;; namely, that he told the locals that the English possessed the &quot;plague&quot; buried under their storehouse and that they could unleash it at will. What he referred to was their cache of gunpowder.

====Massasoit&#x27;s demand for Tisquantum====
Captain Standish and his men eventually did go to the Massachuset and returned with a &quot;good store of Trade&quot;. On their return, they saw that Massasoit was there and he was displaying his anger against Tisquantum. Bradford did his best to appease him, and he eventually departed. Not long afterward, however, he sent a messenger demanding that Tisquantum be put to death. Bradford responded that although Tisquantum &quot;deserved to die both in respect of him [Massasoit] and us&quot;, but said that Tisquantum was too useful to the settlers because otherwise, he had no one to translate. Not long afterward, the same messenger returned, this time with &quot;divers others&quot;, demanding Tisquantum. They argued that Tisquantum being a subject of Massasoit, was subject, pursuant to the first article of the Peace Treaty, to the sachem&#x27;s demand, in effect, rendition. They further argued that if Bradford would not produce pursuant to the Treaty, Massasoit had sent many beavers&#x27; skins to induce his consent. Finally, if Bradford still would not release him to them, the messenger had brought Massasoit&#x27;s own knife by which Bradford himself could cut off Tisquantum&#x27;s head and hands to be returned with the messenger. Bradford avoided the question of Massasoit&#x27;s right under the treaty but refused the beaver pelts saying that &quot;It was not the manner of the &quot;English&quot; to sell men&#x27;s lives at a price ...&quot; The governor called Tisquantum (who had promised not to flee), who denied the charges and ascribed them to Hobomok&#x27;s desire for his downfall. He nonetheless offered to abide by Bradford&#x27;s decision. Bradford was &quot;ready to deliver him into the hands of his Executioners&quot; but at that instance, a boat passed before the town in the harbor. Fearing that it might be the French, Bradford said he had to first identify the ship before dealing with the demand. The messenger and his companions, however, &quot;mad with rage, and impatient at delay&quot; left &quot;in great heat&quot;.

===Final mission with the settlers===
====Arrival of the &quot;Sparrow&quot;====
The ship the English saw pass before the town was not French, but rather a shallop from the &quot;Sparrow&quot;, a shipping vessel sponsored by Thomas Weston and one other of the Plymouth settlement&#x27;s sponsors, which was plying the eastern fishing grounds. This boat brought seven additional settlers but no provisions whatsoever &quot;nor any hope of any&quot;. In a letter they brought, Weston explained that the settlers were to set up a salt pan operation on one of the islands in the harbor for the private account of Weston. He asked the Plymouth colony, however, to house and feed these newcomers, provide them with seed stock and (ironically) salt, until he was able to send the salt pan to them. The Plymouth settlers had spent the winter and spring on half rations in order to feed the settlers that had been sent nine months ago without provisions. Now Weston was exhorting them to support new settlers who were not even sent to help the plantation. He also announced that he would be sending another ship that would discharge more passengers before it would sail on to Virginia. He requested that the settlers entertain them in their houses so that they could go out and cut down timber to lade the ship quickly so as not to delay its departure. Bradford found the whole business &quot;but cold comfort to fill their hungry bellies&quot;. Bradford was not exaggerating. Winslow described the dire straits. They now were without bread &quot;the want whereof much abated the strength and the flesh of some, and swelled others&quot;. Without hooks or seines or netting, they could not collect the bass in the rivers and cove, and without tackle and navigation rope, they could not fish for the abundant cod in the sea. Had it not been for shellfish which they could catch by hand, they would have perished. But there was more, Weston also informed them that the London backers had decided to dissolve the venture. Weston urged the settlers to ratify the decision; only then might the London merchants send them further support, although what motivation they would then have he did not explain. That boat also, evidently, contained alarming news from the South. John Huddleston, who was unknown to them but captained a fishing ship that had returned from Virginia to the Maine fishing grounds, advised his &quot;good friends at Plymouth&quot; of the massacre in the Jamestown settlements by the Powhatan in which he said 400 had been killed. He warned them: &quot;Happy is he whom other men&#x27;s harms doth make to beware.&quot; This last communication Bradford decided to turn to their advantage. Sending a return for this kindness, they might also seek fish or other provisions from the fishermen. Winslow and a crew were selected to make the voyage to Maine, 150 miles away, to a place they had never been. In Winslow&#x27;s reckoning, he left at the end of May for Damariscove. Winslow found the fishermen more than sympathetic and they freely gave what they could. Even though this was not as much as Winslow hoped, it was enough to keep them going until the harvest.

When Winslow returned, the threat they felt had to be addressed. The general anxiety aroused by Huddleston&#x27;s letter was heightened by the increasingly hostile taunts they learned of. Surrounding villagers were &quot;glorying in our weaknesse&quot;, and the English heard threats about how &quot;easie it would be ere long to cut us off&quot;. Even Massasoit turned cool towards the English, and could not be counted on to tamp down this rising hostility. So they decided to build a fort on burying hill in town. And just as they did when building the palisade, the men had to cut down trees, haul them from the forest and up the hill and construct the fortified building, all with inadequate nutrition and at the neglect of dressing their crops.

====Weston&#x27;s English settlers====
They might have thought they reached the end of their problems, but in June 1622 the settlers saw two more vessels arrive, carrying 60 additional mouths to feed. These were the passengers that Weston had written would be unloaded from the vessel going on to Virginia. That vessel also carried more distressing news. Weston informed the governor that he was no longer a part of the company sponsoring the Plymouth settlement. The settlers he sent just now, and requested the Plymouth settlement to house and feed, were for his own enterprise. The &quot;sixty lusty men&quot; would not work for the benefit of Plymouth; in fact he had obtained a patent and as soon as they were ready they would settle an area in Massachusetts Bay. Other letters also were brought. The other venturers in London explained that they had bought out Weston, and everyone was better off without him. Weston, who saw the letter before it was sent, advised the settlers to break off from the remaining merchants, and as a sign of good faith delivered a quantity of bread and cod to them. (Although, as Bradford noted in the margin, he &quot;left not his own men a bite of bread.&quot;) The arrivals also brought news that the &quot;Fortune&quot; had been taken by French pirates, and therefore all their past effort to export American cargo (valued at £500) would count for nothing. Finally Robert Cushman sent a letter advising that Weston&#x27;s men &quot;are no men for us; wherefore I prey you entertain them not&quot;; he also advised the Plymouth Separatists not to trade with them or loan them anything except on strict collateral.&quot;I fear these people will hardly deal so well with the savages as they should. I pray you therefore signify to Squanto that they are a distinct body from us, and we have nothing to do with them, neither must be blamed for their faults, much less can warrant their fidelity.&quot; As much as all this vexed the governor, Bradford took in the men and fed and housed them as he did the others sent to him, even though Weston&#x27;s men would compete with his colony for pelts and other Native trade. But the words of Cushman would prove prophetic.
Weston&#x27;s men, &quot;stout knaves&quot; in the words of Thomas Morton, were roustabouts collected for adventure and they scandalized the mostly strictly religious villagers of Plymouth. Worse, they stole the colony&#x27;s corn, wandering into the fields and snatching the green ears for themselves. When caught, they were &quot;well whipped&quot;, but hunger drove them to steal &quot;by night and day&quot;. The harvest again proved disappointing, so that it appeared that &quot;famine must still ensue, the next year also&quot; for lack of seed. And they could not even trade for staples because their supply of items the Natives sought had been exhausted. Part of their cares were lessened when their coasters returned from scouting places in Weston&#x27;s patent and took Weston&#x27;s men (except for the sick, who remained) to the site they selected for settlement, called Wessagusset (now Weymouth). But not long after, even there they plagued Plymouth, who heard, from Natives once friendly with them, that Weston&#x27;s settlers were stealing their corn and committing other abuses. At the end of August a fortuitous event staved off another starving winter: the &quot;Discovery&quot;, bound for London, arrived from a coasting expedition from Virginia. The ship had a cargo of knives, beads and other items prized by Natives, but seeing the desperation of the colonists the captain drove a hard bargain: He required them to buy a large lot, charged them double their price and valued their beaver pelts at 3s. per pound, which he could sell at 20s. &quot;Yet they were glad of the occasion and fain to buy at any price ...&quot;

====Trading expedition with Weston&#x27;s men====
The &quot;Charity&quot; returned from Virginia at the end of September–beginning of October. It proceeded on to England, leaving the Wessagusset settlers well provisioned. The &quot;Swan&quot; was left for their use as well. It was not long after they learned that the Plymouth settlers had acquired a store of trading goods that they wrote Bradford proposing that they jointly undertake a trading expedition, they to supply the use of the &quot;Swan.&quot; They proposed equal division of the proceeds with payment for their share of the goods traded to await arrival of Weston. (Bradford assumed they had burned through their provisions.) Bradford agreed and proposed an expedition southward of the Cape.

Winslow wrote that Tisquantum and Massasoit had &quot;wrought&quot; a peace (although he doesn&#x27;t explain how this came about). With Tisquantum as guide, they might find the passage among the Monomoy Shoals to Nantucket Sound; Tisquantum had advised them he twice sailed through the shoals, once on an English and once on a French vessel. The venture ran into problems from the start. When in Plymouth Richard Green, Weston&#x27;s brother-in-law and temporary governor of the colony, died. After his burial and receiving directions to proceed from the succeeding governor of Wessagusset, Standish was appointed leader but twice the voyage was turned back by violent winds. On the second attempt, Standish fell ill. On his return Bradford himself took charge of the enterprise. In November they set out. When they reached the shoals, Tisquantum piloted the vessel, but the master of the vessel did not trust the directions and bore up. Tisquantum directed him through a narrow passage, and they were able to harbor near Mamamoycke (now Chatham).

That night Bradford went ashore with a few others, Tisquantum acting as translator and facilitator. Not having seen any of these Englishmen before, the Natives were initially reluctant. But Tisquantum coaxed them and they provided a plentiful meal of venison and other victuals. They were reluctant to allow the English to see their homes, but when Bradford showed his intention to stay on shore, they invited him to their shelters, having first removed all their belongings. As long as the English stayed, the Natives would disappear &quot;bag and baggage&quot; whenever their possessions were seen. Eventually Tisquantum persuaded them to trade and as a result, the settlers obtained eight hogsheads of corn and beans. The villagers also told them that they had seen vessels &quot;of good burthen&quot; pass through the shoals. And so, with Tisquantum feeling confident, the English were prepared to make another attempt. But suddenly Tisquantum became ill and died.

==Death==
The sickness seems to have greatly shaken Bradford, for they lingered there for several days before he died. Bradford described his death in some detail:

In this place Tisquantum fell sick of Indian fever, bleeding much at the nose (which the Indians take as a symptom of death) and within a few days died there; desiring the Governor to pray for him, that he might go to the Englishmen&#x27;s God in Heaven; and bequeathed sundry of his things to English friends, as remembrances of his love; of whom they had a great loss.

Without Tisquantum to pilot them, the English settlers decided against trying the shoals again and returned to Cape Cod Bay.

The English Separatists were comforted by the fact that Tisquantum had become a Christian convert. William Wood writing a little more than a decade later explained why some of the Ninnimissinuok began recognizing the power of &quot;the &quot;Englishmens&quot; God, as they call him&quot;: &quot;because they could never yet have power by their conjurations to damnifie the &quot;English&quot; either in body or goods&quot; and since the introduction of the new spirit &quot;the times and seasons being much altered in seven or eight years, freer from lightning and thunder, and long droughts, suddaine and tempestuous dashes of rain, and lamentable cold Winters&quot;.

Philbrick speculates that Tisquantum may have been poisoned by Massasoit. His bases for the claim are (i) that other Native Americans had engaged in assassinations during the 17th century; and (ii) that Massasoit&#x27;s own son, Metacomet, may have assassinated John Sassamon, an event that led to the bloody King Philip&#x27;s War a half-century later. He suggests that the &quot;peace&quot; Winslow says was lately made between the two could have been a &quot;rouse&quot; but does not explain how Massasoit could have accomplished the feat on the very remote southeast end of Cape Cod, more than 85 miles distant from Pokanoket.

Tisquantum is reputed to be buried at Burial Hill in the village of Chathamport, a headland burial ground above and just north of William Nickerson&#x27;s 1656 homesite.

==Assessment, memorials, representations, and folklore==
===Historical assessment===
Because almost all the historical records of Tisquantum were written by English Separatists and because most of that writing had the purpose to attract new settlers, give account of their actions to their financial sponsors or to justify themselves to co-religionists, they tended to relegate Tisquantum (or any other Native American) to the role of assistant to them in their activities. No real attempt was made to understand Tisquantum or Native culture, particularly religion. The closest that Bradford got in analyzing him was to say &quot;that Tisquantum sought his own ends and played his own game, ... to enrich himself&quot;. But in the end, he gave &quot;sundry of his things to sundry of his English friends&quot;.

Historians&#x27; assessment of Tisquantum depended on the extent they were willing to consider the possible biases or motivations of the colonial witnesses. Earlier historians tended to take the colonists&#x27; statements at face value. Current historians, especially those familiar with ethnohistorical research, have given a more nuanced view of Tisquantum, among other Native Americans. 

Adams (writing in 1892) characterized Tisquantum as &quot;a notable illustration of the innate childishness of the Indian character&quot;. By contrast, Shuffelton (writing in 1976) said that &quot;in his own way, [he] was quite as sophisticated as his English friends, and he was one of the most widely traveled men in the New England of his time, having visited Spain, England, and Newfoundland, as well as a large expanse of his own region.&quot; Early Plymouth historian Judge John Davis (writing in 1826) also saw Tisquantum as a &quot;child of nature&quot;, but was willing to grant him some usefulness to the enterprise: &quot;With some aberrations, his conduct was generally irreproachable, and his useful services to the infant settlement, entitle him to grateful remembrance.&quot; Adolf (writing in 1964) was much harder on the character of Tisquantum (&quot;his attempt to aggrandize himself by playing the Whites and Indians against each other indicates an unsavory facet of his personality&quot;) but gave him more importance (without him &quot;the founding and development of Plymouth would have been much more difficult, if not impossible.&quot;). Most have followed the line that Baylies early took when (writing in 1836) he acknowledged the alleged duplicity but also the significant contribution to the settlers&#x27; survival: &quot;Although Squanto had discovered [= revealed] some traits of duplicity, yet his loss was justly deemed a public misfortune, as he had rendered the English much service.&quot;

===Memorials and landmarks===
As for monuments and memorials, although many (as Willison put it) &quot;clutter up the Pilgrim towns there is none to Squanto...&quot; The first settlers may have named after him the peninsula called Squantum once in Dorchester, now in Quincy, during their first expedition there with Tisquantum as their guide. Thomas Morton refers to a place called &quot;Squanto&#x27;s Chappell&quot;, but this is probably another name for the peninsula.

===Literature and popular entertainment===
Tisquantum rarely makes appearances in literature or popular entertainment. Of all the 19th-century New England poets and story tellers who drew on pre-Revolution America for their characters, only one seems to have mentioned Tisquantum. And while Henry Wadsworth Longfellow himself had five ancestors aboard the &quot;Mayflower&quot;, &quot;The Courtship of Miles Standish&quot; has the captain blustering at the beginning, daring the savages to attack, yet the enemies he addresses could not have been known to him by name until their peaceful intentions had already been made known:

Tisquantum is almost equally scarce in popular entertainment, but when he appeared it was typically in implausible fantasies. Very early in what Willison calls the &quot;Pilgrim Apotheosis&quot;, marked by the 1793 sermon of Reverend Chandler Robbins, in which he described the &quot;Mayflower&quot; settlers as &quot;pilgrims&quot;, a &quot;Melo Drama&quot; was advertised in Boston titled &quot;The Pilgrims, Or the Landing of the Forefathrs at Plymouth Rock&quot; filled with Indian threats and comic scenes. In Act II Samoset carries off the maiden Juliana and Winslow for a sacrifice, but the next scene presents &quot;A dreadful Combat with Clubs and Shileds, between Samoset and Squanto&quot;. Nearly two centuries later Tisquantum appears again as an action figure in the Disney film &quot;&quot; (1994) with not much more fidelity to history. Tisquantum (voiced by Frank Welker) appears in the first episode (&quot;The Mayflower Voyagers&quot;, aired October 21, 1988) of the animated mini-series &quot;This Is America, Charlie Brown&quot;. A more historically accurate depiction of Tisquantum (as played by Kalani Queypo) appeared in the National Geographic Channel film &quot;Saints &amp; Strangers&quot;, written by Eric Overmyer and Seth Fisher, which aired the week of Thanksgiving 2015.
A brief story of Squanto appears in the novel &quot;Dark Tides&quot; by Philippa Gregory (Apria Books, 2020). Focus on the Family created an audio drama entitled, &quot;The Legend of Squanto&quot; in 1997 with Peter Brook portraying Squanto. The story focuses on Squanto&#x27;s early life as well as his life interactions with the Pilgrims.

===Didactic literature and folklore===
Where Tisquantum is most encountered is in literature designed to instruct children and young people, provide inspiration, or guide them to a patriotic or religious truth. This came about for two reasons. First, Lincoln&#x27;s establishment of Thanksgiving as a national holiday enshrined the New England Anglo-Saxon festival, vaguely associated with an American strain of Protestantism, as something of a national origins myth, in the middle of a divisive Civil War when even some Unionists were becoming concerned with rising non-Anglo-Saxon immigration. This coincided, as Ceci noted, with the &quot;noble savage&quot; movement, which was &quot;rooted in romantic reconstructions of Indians (for example, &quot;Hiawatha&quot;) as uncorrupted natural beings—who were becoming extinct—in contrast to rising industrial and urban mobs&quot;. She points to the Indian Head coin first struck in 1859 &quot;to commemorate their passing.&#x27;&quot; Even though there was only the briefest mention of &quot;Thanksgiving&quot; in the Plymouth settlers&#x27; writings, and despite the fact that he was not mentioned as being present (although, living with the settlers, he likely was), Tisquantum was the focus around which both storylines could be wrapped. He is, or at least a fictionalized portrayal of him, thus a favorite of certain politically conservative American Protestant groups.

The story of the selfless &quot;noble savage&quot; who patiently guided and occasionally saved the &quot;Pilgrims&quot; (to whom he was subservient and who attributed their good fortune solely to their faith, all celebrated during a bounteous festival) was thought to be an enchanting figure for children and young adults. Beginning early in the 20th century Tisquantum entered high school textbooks, children&#x27;s read-aloud and self-reading books, more recently learn-to-read and coloring books and children&#x27;s religious inspiration books. Over time and particularly depending on the didactic purpose, these books have greatly fictionalized what little historical evidence remains of Tisquantum&#x27;s life. Their portraits of Tisquantum&#x27;s life and times spans the gamut of accuracy. Those intending to teach a moral lesson or tell history from a religious viewpoint tend to be the least accurate even when they claim to be telling a true historical story. Recently there have been attempts to tell the story as accurately as possible, without reducing Tisquantum to a mere servant of the English. There have even been attempts to place the story in the social and historical context of fur trade, epidemics and land disputes. Almost none, however, have dealt with Tisquantum&#x27;s life after &quot;Thanksgiving&quot; (except occasionally the story of the rescue of John Billington). An exception to all of that is the publication of a &quot;young adult&quot; version of Philbrick&#x27;s best-selling adult history. Nevertheless, given the sources which can be drawn on, Tisquantum&#x27;s story inevitably is seen from the European perspective.

* The book was first published in . An annotated version is contained in .
* This is the modern critical edition of the manuscript by William Bradford entitled simply &quot;Of plimouth plantation&quot;. In the notes and references the manuscript (as opposed to the printed versions) is sometimes referred to as OPP. The first book of the manuscript had been copied into Plymouth church records by Nathaniel Morton, Bradford&#x27;s nephew and secretary, and it was this version that was annotated and printed in , the original at a time having been missing since the beginning of the American Revolution. In the decade after the publication by Young, the original manuscript was discovered to be in the library of the Bishop of London in Fulham Palace. The Massachusetts Historical Society arranged for a longhand copy to be made. That version was published in Volume III of the Fourth Series of the &quot;Collections&quot; of the Massachusetts Historical Society (1856), which volume is hosted by the Internet Archive. When the manuscript was returned to Massachusetts at the end of the 19th century, the Massachusetts legislature commissioned a new transcription to be published. While the version that resulted was more faithful to the idiosyncratic orthography of Bradford, it contained, according to Morison, many of the same mistakes as the transcription published in 1856. The legislature&#x27;s version was published in 1898. A copy is hosted by the Internet Archive. That version was the basis of the annotated version published as The 1982 Barnes &amp; Noble reprint of this edition can be found online at HathiTrust. A digitized version with most of Davis&#x27;s annotations and notes removed is hosted at the University of Maryland&#x27;s Early Americas Digital Archive. The most amply annotated and literrally transcribed edition of the work is . The history of the manuscript is described in the Editorial Preface to the 1856 publication by the Massachusetts Historical Society and more fully in the Introduction of Morison&#x27;s edition (pp. xxvii–xl), which also contains a history of the published editions of the manuscript (pp. xl–xliii).

<text>Pyrex (trademarked as &quot;PYREX&quot; and &quot;pyrex&quot;) is a brand introduced by Corning Inc. in 1915, initially for a line of clear, low-thermal-expansion borosilicate glass used for laboratory glassware and kitchenware. It was later expanded in the 1930s to include kitchenware products made of soda–lime glass and other materials. Its name has become famous for making rectangular glass roasters.

In 1998, the kitchenware division of Corning Inc. responsible for the development of Pyrex spun off from its parent company as Corning Consumer Products Company, subsequently renamed Corelle Brands. Corning Inc. no longer manufactures or markets consumer products, only industrial ones.

== History ==

Borosilicate glass was first made by German chemist and glass technologist Otto Schott, founder of Schott AG in 1893, 22 years before Corning produced the Pyrex brand. Schott AG sells the product under the name &quot;Duran&quot;.

In 1908, Eugene Sullivan, director of research at Corning Glass Works, developed Nonex, a borosilicate low-expansion glass, to reduce breakage in shock-resistant lantern globes and battery jars. Sullivan had learned about Schott&#x27;s borosilicate glass as a doctoral student in Leipzig, Germany. Jesse Littleton of Corning discovered the cooking potential of borosilicate glass by giving his wife Bessie Littleton a casserole dish made from a cut-down Nonex battery jar. Corning removed the lead from Nonex and developed it as a consumer product. Pyrex made its public debut in 1915 during World War I, positioned as an American-produced alternative to Duran.

A Corning executive gave the following account of the etymology of the name &quot;Pyrex&quot;:

Corning purchased the Macbeth-Evans Glass Company in 1936 and their Charleroi, PA plant was used to produce Pyrex opal ware bowls and bakeware made of tempered soda–lime glass. In 1958 an internal design department was started by John B. Ward. He redesigned the Pyrex ovenware and Flameware. Over the years, designers such as Penny Sparke, Betty Baugh, Smart Design, TEAMS Design, and others have contributed to the design of the line.

Corning divested itself of the Corning Consumer Products Company (now known as Corelle Brands) in 1998 and production of consumer Pyrex products went with it. Its previous licensing of the name to Newell Cookware Europe remained in effect.

France-based cookware maker Arc International acquired Newell&#x27;s European business in early 2006 to own rights to the brand in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. In 2007, Arc closed the Pyrex soda–lime factory in Sunderland, UK moving all European production to France. The Sunderland factory had first started making Pyrex in 1922.

In 2014, Arc International sold off its Arc International Cookware division which operated the Pyrex business to Aurora Capital for its Resurgence Fund II. The division was renamed the International Cookware group. London-based private equity firm Kartesia purchased International Cookware in 2020.

In 2021, Pyrex rival Duralex was acquired by International Cookware group for €3.5 million (US$4.2m).

In March 2019, Corelle Brands, the makers of Pyrex in the United States, merged with Instant Brands, the makers of the Instant Pot. On June 12, 2023, Instant Brands filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy after high interest rates and waning access to credit hit its cash position and made its debts unsustainable. The company emerged from bankruptcy on February 27, 2024 under the previous Corelle Brands moniker, after having sold off its appliance business (&quot;Instant&quot; branded products).

== Trademark ==
In Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, a variation of the PYREX (all uppercase) trademark is licensed by International Cookware for bakeware that has been made of numerous materials including borosilicate and soda–lime glass, stoneware, metal, plus vitroceramic cookware. The pyrex (all lowercase, introduced in 1975) trademark is now used for kitchenware sold in the United States, South America, and Asia. In the past, the brand name has also been used for kitchen utensils and bakeware by other companies in regions such as Japan and Australia.

It is a common misconception that the logo style alone indicates the type of glass used to manufacture the bakeware. Additionally, Corning&#x27;s introduction of soda-lime-glass-based Pyrex in the 1940s predates the introduction of the all lowercase logo by nearly 30 years.

== Composition ==
Older clear-glass Pyrex manufactured by Corning, Arc International&#x27;s Pyrex products, and Pyrex laboratory glassware are made of borosilicate glass. According to the National Institute of Standards and Technology, borosilicate Pyrex is composed of (as percentage of weight): 4.0% boron, 54.0% oxygen, 2.8% sodium, 1.1% aluminum, 37.7% silicon, and 0.3% potassium.

According to glass supplier Pulles and Hannique, borosilicate Pyrex is made of Corning 7740 glass and is equivalent in formulation to Schott Glass 8330 glass sold under the &quot;Duran&quot; brand name. The composition of both Corning 7740 and Schott 8330 is given as 80.6% , 12.6% , 4.2% , 2.2% , 0.1% , 0.1% , 0.05% , and 0.04% .

In the late 1930s and 1940s, Corning also introduced new product lines under the Pyrex brand using different types of glass. Opaque tempered soda–lime glass was used to create decorated opal ware bowls and bakeware, and aluminosilicate glass was used for Pyrex Flameware stovetop cookware. The latter product had a bluish tint caused by the addition of alumino-sulfate.

Beginning in the 1980s, production of clear Pyrex glass products manufactured in the USA by Corning was also shifted to tempered soda–lime glass, like their popular opal bakeware. This change was justified by stating that soda–lime glass has higher mechanical strength than borosilicatemaking it more resistant to physical damage when dropped, which is believed to be the most common cause of breakage in glass bakeware. The glass is also cheaper to produce and more environmentally friendly. Its thermal shock resistance is lower than borosilicate&#x27;s, leading to potential breakage from heat stress if used contrary to recommendations. Since the closure of the soda–lime plant in England in 2007, European Pyrex has been made solely from borosilicate.

The differences between Pyrex-branded glass products has also led to controversy regarding safety issuesin 2008, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission reported it had received 66 complaints by users reporting that their Pyrex glassware had shattered over the prior ten years yet concluded that Pyrex glass bakeware does not present a safety concern. The consumer affairs magazine &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; investigated the issue and released test results, in January 2011, confirming that borosilicate glass bakeware was less susceptible to thermal shock breakage than tempered soda lime bakeware. They admitted their testing conditions were &quot;contrary to instructions&quot; provided by the manufacturer. STATS analyzed the data available and found that the most common way that users were injured by glassware was via mechanical breakage, being hit or dropped, and that &quot;the change to soda lime represents a greater net safety benefit.&quot;

== Use in telescopes ==
Because of its low expansion characteristics, borosilicate glass is often the material of choice for reflective optics in astronomy applications.

In 1932, George Ellery Hale approached Corning with the challenge of fabricating the telescope mirror for the California Institute of Technology&#x27;s Palomar Observatory project. A previous effort to fabricate the optic from fused quartz had failed, with the cast blank having voids. The mirror was cast by Corning during 1934–1936 out of borosilicate glass. After a year of cooling, during which it was almost lost to a flood, the blank was completed in 1935. The first blank now resides in the Corning Museum of Glass.

<text>Chartreuse (, , ) is a French herbal liqueur available in green and yellow versions that differ in taste and alcohol content. The liqueur has been made by Carthusian monks since 1737, reportedly according to instructions set out in a manuscript given to them by François Annibal d&#x27;Estrées in 1605. It was named after the monks&#x27; Grande Chartreuse monastery, located in the Chartreuse Mountains north of Grenoble. Today the liqueur is produced in their distillery in nearby Aiguenoire. It is composed of distilled alcohol aged with 130 herbs, plants and flowers, and sweetened.

The color chartreuse takes its name from the drink.

==History==


According to tradition, a marshal of artillery to French king Henry IV, François Hannibal d&#x27;Estrées, presented the Carthusian monks at Vauvert, near Paris, with an alchemical manuscript that contained a recipe for an &quot;elixir of long life&quot; in 1605. The recipe eventually reached the religious order&#x27;s headquarters at the Grande Chartreuse monastery, north of Grenoble. The formula is said to include 130 herbs, plants and flowers and secret ingredients combined in a wine alcohol base. The recipe was further enhanced in 1737 by Brother Gérome Maubec.

The beverage soon became popular, and in 1764 the monks adapted the elixir recipe to make what is now called the &quot;Elixir Végétal de la Grande Chartreuse&quot;.

In 1793, the monks were expelled from France along with all other religious orders and manufacture of the liqueur ceased. A copy of the manuscript was made and kept at the monastery. The original left with the monks. On the way there, the monk was arrested and sent to prison in Bordeaux. He was not searched and was able to secretly pass the manuscript to one of his friends: Dom Basile Nantas. This friend was convinced that the order would remain in Spain and never come back and that the manufacturing of the liqueur would cease. He sold the manuscript to a pharmacist in Grenoble, Monsieur Liotard. In 1810, Napoleon ordered that all &quot;secret&quot; recipes of medicine be sent to the Ministry of Interior for review. The manuscript was sent and returned as &quot;Refused&quot; as it was not a secret but well known. After the death of the pharmacist, his heirs returned the manuscript to the monks who had been back at the monastery since 1816.

In 1840, they developed a milder version called Green Chartreuse and a sweeter version called Yellow Chartreuse.

The monks were again expelled from the monastery following a French law in 1903, and their real property, including the distillery, was confiscated by the government. The monks took their secret recipe to their refuge in Tarragona, Catalonia, and began producing their liqueurs with the same label, but with an additional label which said &quot;Liqueur fabriquée à Tarragone par les Pères Chartreux&quot; (&quot;liqueur manufactured in Tarragona by the Carthusian Fathers&quot;). At the same time, the &quot;Compagnie Fermière de la Grande Chartreuse&quot;, a corporation in Voiron that obtained the Chartreuse assets, produced a liqueur without benefit of the monks&#x27; recipe which they sold as Chartreuse. While the French corporation was acting legally in France, the monks successfully prevented the export of the liqueur to many other countries, since the order retained ownership of its foreign trademark registrations, largely because the recipe had been kept secret. One dispute was litigated in the United States, in which the monks won a lawsuit defending their trademark in &quot;Baglin v. Cusenier&quot;.

Sales at the French company were very poor, and by 1929, it faced bankruptcy. A group of local businessmen in Voiron bought all the shares at a low price and sent them as a gift to the monks in Tarragona.
After regaining possession of the distillery, the Carthusian brothers returned to the monastery with the tacit approval of the French government and began to produce Chartreuse once again. Despite the eviction law, when a mudslide destroyed the distillery in 1935, the French government assigned army engineers to relocate and rebuild it at a location near Voiron where the monks had previously set up a distribution point. After World War II, the government lifted the expulsion order, making the Carthusian brothers legal French residents once again.

Until the 1980s, there was another distillery at Tarragona in Spain.

In 2017 the distillery moved from Voiron to nearby Aiguenoire due to safety concerns.

Today, the liqueurs are produced using the herbal mixture prepared by two monks at Grande Chartreuse. They are the only ones to know the secret recipe. The marketing, bottling, packaging, management of the distillery and tours are done by &quot;Chartreuse Diffusion&quot;, a company created in 1970. Other related alcoholic beverages are manufactured in the same distillery (e.g. Génépi).

===21st century: popularity and scarcity===

Chartreuse increased in popularity during the craft cocktail movement of the early 2000s, due to its bittersweet profile and effective marketing of its romantic history. Cocktails such as the Last Word were popularized by mixologists. In 2020, the trend toward at-home cocktail making during the COVID-19 pandemic doubled worldwide demand for the liqueur. Global sales of Chartreuse sales reached over US$30 million in 2022.

Meanwhile, in a separate decision, the Carthusian monks decided in 2019 to limit Chartreuse production to 1.6 million bottles per year, citing the environmental impacts of production, and the monks&#x27; desire to focus on solitude and prayer. The combination of fixed production and increased demand has resulted in shortages of Chartreuse across the world.

==Ingredients==
The book &quot;The Practical Hotel Steward&quot; (1900) states that Green Chartreuse contains &quot;cinnamon, mace, lemon balm, dried hyssop flower tops, peppermint, thyme, costmary, arnica flowers, genepi, and angelica roots&quot;, and that yellow chartreuse is &quot;similar to above, adding cardamom seeds and socctrine aloes.&quot; The monks intended their liqueur to be used as medicine. The exact recipes for all forms of Chartreuse remain trade secrets and are known at any given time only to the three monks who prepare the herbal mixture. The only formally known element of the recipe is that it uses 130 different plants.

Chartreuse is commonly used as an ingredient in cocktails, such as a Cloister and Last Word.

==Types==
===Green Chartreuse===
Green Chartreuse (110 proof or 55% ABV) is a naturally green liqueur made from 130 herbs and other plants macerated in alcohol and steeped for about eight hours. A last maceration of plants gives its color to the liqueur. The first version of the liqueur was devised in 1825, with the modern version first released in 1840.

===Yellow Chartreuse===
Yellow Chartreuse (86 proof or 43%) has a milder and sweeter flavor and aroma than Green Chartreuse, and is lower in alcohol content.

===Chartreuse VEP===
VEP stands for &quot;Vieillissement Exceptionnellement Prolongé&quot;, meaning &quot;exceptionally prolonged aging&quot;. It is made using the same processes and the same secret formula as the traditional liqueur, and by extra long aging in oak casks it reaches an exceptional quality. Chartreuse VEP comes in both yellow and green.

===Élixir Végétal de la Grande-Chartreuse===

Élixir Végétal de la Grande-Chartreuse (138 proof or 69%) has the same base of about 130 medicinal and aromatic plants and flowers but is more alcoholic. It can be described as a cordial or a liqueur, and is claimed to be a tonic. It is sold enclosed in small wooden bottles.

===Liqueur du 9° Centenaire===
Liqueur du 9° Centenaire (47%) was created in 1984 to commemorate the 900th anniversary of the founding of the abbey. It is similar to Green Chartreuse, but slightly sweeter.

===Chartreuse 1605 – Liqueur d&#x27;Elixir===
Chartreuse 1605 – Liqueur d&#x27;Elixir (56%) was created to commemorate the return of a mysterious manuscript concerning an elixir of long life to the Carthusian monks by Marshal François Annibal d&#x27;Estrées.

===White Chartreuse===
White Chartreuse (30% ABV) was produced and sold between 1860 and 1880, and again from 1886 to 1903.

===Génépi===
The monks make a Génépi which is the general term in the Alps for a homemade or local liqueur based on Alpine Artemisia flowers. There are hundreds or even thousands of different Génépi liqueurs made, many simply by families for their own use each year. As they have been making Chartreuse from local plants for centuries, the monks started in the 2000s to make a Génépi as a sideline product. It is labeled &quot;Génépi des Pères Chartreux&quot; and is generally only available locally in a 70 cl bottle, usually labeled 40% alcohol.

===Cuvée des Meilleurs Ouvriers de France===

In 2007, a special edition was created by the Meilleurs Ouvriers de France (Best Craftsmen of France) in partnership with the Chartreuse distillery. It is yellow in color (45% alcohol).

==Flavor==
Chartreuse has a very strong characteristic taste. It is very sweet, but becomes both spicy and pungent. It is comparable to other herbal liqueurs such as Galliano, Liquore Strega or Kräuterlikör, though it is distinctively more vegetal, or herbaceous. Like other liqueurs, its flavor is sensitive to serving temperature. If straight, it can be served very cold, but is often served at room temperature. It is also featured in some cocktails. Some mixed drink recipes call for only a few drops of Chartreuse due to its strong flavor. It is popular in French ski resorts where it is mixed with hot chocolate and called &quot;verte chaud&quot;, translating to &quot;hot green&quot;.

Chartreuse is one of a handful of liqueurs that continue to age and improve in the bottle.

==Accolades==
Chartreuse liqueurs generally have performed well at international spirit ratings competitions. The basic green offering has won silver and double gold medals from the San Francisco World Spirits Competition. It has also earned an above-average score of 93 from the Beverage Testing Institute and has been given scores in the 96-100 interval by Wine Enthusiast. The VEP Green and VEP Yellow have generally earned similarly impressive scores. The basic Yellow Chartreuse has received more modest (though still average or above) ratings.

==Influence on color==
Chartreuse gives its name to the color chartreuse, which was first used as a term of color in 1884. Chartreuse yellow is a color originally named &quot;chartreuse&quot; in 1892 after Yellow Chartreuse liqueur, but since 1987 it has been called &quot;chartreuse yellow&quot; to avoid confusion with the green version of chartreuse.

<text>Grande Chartreuse () is the head monastery of the Carthusian religious order. It is located in the Chartreuse Mountains, north of the city of Grenoble, in the commune of Saint-Pierre-de-Chartreuse (Isère), France.

==History==

Originally, the château belonged to the See of Grenoble. In 1084, Saint Hugh gave it to hermit Saint Bruno and his followers who founded the Carthusian Order.

The recipe of the alcoholic beverage Chartreuse is said to have been given to the monks of Grande Chartreuse in 1605 by the French Marshal François Annibal d&#x27;Estrées. For over a century, the monks worked on perfecting the 130-ingredient recipe. In 1764, the monks expanded their distillery for the first time to meet the demand of their popular &quot;Elixir Végétal de la Grande Chartreuse&quot;. The distillery has then been moved several times in more remote areas because it represents a major explosion hazard for the surrounding habitations.

The château went through many severe casualties, reconstructions and renovations. The current building was erected in 1688. In 1790, following the French Revolution, the monks were expelled from the monastery, and waited until 1838 to be reauthorized on the premises.

The massive collection of 400 manuscripts and 3,500 printed documents (including 300 incunabula) taken from the Grande Chartreuse during the French Revolution is curated and protected in the bibliothèque d’étude et du patrimoine of Grenoble, and an online scanned version of the documents is available on the digital platform of the library, Pagella, for researchers and interested people alike. 

Following the establishment of the Association Law of 1901 and its interpretation that effectively banned religious associations en masse, many notable religious institutions across France, including the Grande Chartreuse, were closed by the French government. While some monks found refuge in Italy until 1929, others settled in the Tarragona region of Spain and relaunched the monastery&#x27;s famous liqueur-producing activity. The Grande Chartreuse was sold in 1927 to a group of local entrepreneurs who invited the monks back to their monastery.

In 1940, the Grande Chartreuse was reopened under the Petain regime. At the end of World War II, the Grande Chartreuse was used as a hospital by the Allied Forces.

==Description==

Visitors are not permitted at the Grande Chartreuse, and motor vehicles are prohibited on the surrounding roads.

A museum of the Carthusian order and the lives of its monks and nuns is located about two kilometers away. The order is supported by the sales of Chartreuse liqueur which has been popular in France and later around the world since the early 18th century. In 2015, the order sold 1.5 million bottles of Chartreuse (50 euros a bottle), and all the proceedings went into financing the order and its charity projects. 

==In popular culture==

=== Literature ===
The Italian canon Antonio de Beatis described the former monastery in his 1517-1518 travel journal; he wrote that the original monastery was destroyed in an avalanche long before, killing many of the monks. English poet Matthew Arnold wrote one of his finest poems, &quot;Stanzas from the Grande Chartreuse&quot;, while briefly staying at the monastery around 1850. The Grande Chartreuse was also described by William Wordsworth in his 1792 &quot;Descriptive Sketches&quot; (lines 53-73), and in the 1850 revision of &quot;The Prelude, Book VI&quot; (lines 416-18), (Wordsworth visited the monastery in 1790, but he describes the 1792 expulsion of the monks by French forces); and John Ruskin&#x27;s &quot;Praeterita&quot;.
Alice Muriel Willamson, in her 1905 travel romance novel &quot;The Princess Passes&quot; chapter 28, had her characters visit the recently abandoned monastery, seeing and describing the cells, gardens, and kitchen ware still in place, and described the empty place as a body without a soul.

=== Film ===
&quot;Into Great Silence&quot;, a documentary by Philip Gröning on the monastery, was released in 2005.

<doc id="320060" wikidata="Q5129884" url="?curid=320060" title="Clay Davenport">
<text>Clay Davenport is a baseball sabermetrician who co-founded Baseball Prospectus (BP) in 1996. He co-edited several of the &quot;Baseball Prospectus&quot; annual volumes and is a writer for BaseballProspectus.com. Much of his work for BP was behind the scenes, where he maintained and implemented advanced statistics for the website.

For most of the time during which he contributed to Baseball Prospectus, Davenport&#x27;s main employment was as a meteorologist. In March 2010, it was announced that he had moved to full-time status at Baseball Propectus. In 2011, he departed Baseball Prospectus, but maintains his own website &quot;ClayDavenport.com&quot; on which he continues to publish baseball analysis and projections. As he commented there in May 2011:As my title indicates, this is a place for me to keep some statistics I happen to care about. These are statistics that I&#x27;ve run at Baseball Prospectus for many years, but BP has decided to discontinue them – or at least transform into something I no longer recognize.

Baseball Prospectus was founded on the premise that, since no one was publishing the baseball book we wanted to read, we would print one ourselves. In that same spirit, since BP is not publishing the stats I want to see, the way I want to see them, I&#x27;ll put them up myself.

In a later post, he characterized the reason for his departure from BP:I&#x27;m Clay Davenport, one of the founders of Baseball Prospectus. I still have a (looser than before) affiliation with BP, so don&#x27;t expect to see me using this site to dish dirt or run anybody into the ground. I&#x27;m old enough and stubborn enough to have my own way of doing things, and some of those things are contrary to the way BP wants to do things, which is why I wound up out here.

Davenport is a native of Hampton, Virginia and now lives in Maryland.

==Baseball analysis and sabermetrics==
Davenport is known for creating the Pythagenport Formula, (designed to find the best exponent for the Pythagoras winning percentage equation), for inventing the statistic Equivalent Average (EqA) (now called &quot;True Average&quot; or &quot;TAv&quot;), and for the &quot;Davenport Translations&quot; or DT&#x27;s. The DT&#x27;s are estimated Major League equivalent performance statistics based on player statistics from minor league and international baseball. DT&#x27;s were first published by Davenport on the rec.sports.baseball Usenet site in 1995, before Baseball Prospectus was founded.

The DT&#x27;s are also used to standardize the records of players who played in different eras and playing conditions, not only in different leagues and levels of baseball. This allows comparison, for example, of the number of home runs hit by Babe Ruth and modern players, to estimate how many each would have hit in a season or a lifetime if they had all played under the same playing conditions (parks, leagues, levels of competition, and eras).

Davenport introduced the DT&#x27;s to the on-line baseball research community in 1995 as follows:

Hello. My name is Clay Davenport, and I attend the University of Chicago as a physics genius.
While these Translations look like player stats, they are NOT the players&#x27; actual statistics. The Translations are an attempt to show how well the player would have performed in a standard league (the American League of 1992), knowing how well he played in his actual league. We know that some leagues are tougher than others; that&#x27;s why we have the majors, AAA, AA, and so on. We know that some leagues are easier to hit in; we know that some parks favor the pitchers; and we know that these effects are not constant from one year to the next. We can estimate how big a difference each of those makes and correct for them, and that is what the Translations try to do. How well they work I shall leave for you to judge.

==Meteorology==
A graduate of the University of Chicago, Davenport was employed for many years as a software contractor with the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in the Satellite and Information Service, where he developed models for predicting rainfall from satellite imagery. He has likened some of that work to his baseball analysis: &quot;The biggest similarity between handling the two types of statistics is that they each involve making forecasts that are there for everyone to see, and you end up being wrong a lot,&quot; Davenport said. &quot;You learn to develop a thick skin.&quot;

In 2000, Davenport developed the Hydro-Estimator, a set of computer programs to estimate precipitation in real time.

&quot;The Hydro-Estimator (H-E) version of the Auto-Estimator (AE) was developed by Clay Davenport, a contractor working for the ORA Hydrology Team under the direction of Dr. Rod Scofield. The Hydro-Estimator algorithm differs from the original AE by using a brightness temperature screening technique. It adjusts the rain rate assigned to each picture element (pixel) according to the surrounding pixel temperatures. This helps separate raining and non-raining pixels and decreases the need for radar screening. It also helps focus rainfall estimate totals into more clearly defined maxima. There is less of a tendency for overestimating for very cold cloud tops using the H-E, and it does a much better job of estimating for large mesoscale convective complexes (MCC&#x27;s). The H-E also has a different way of handling the moisture corrections, and also produces more frequent products every 15 minutes for all except the 24-hour totals. The 1 hour H-E totals are available on the NWS AWIPS system as a graphic for the whole CONUS every hour.&quot;

Because of these programs, according to Davenport, &quot;we are now capable of producing rainfall estimates for every system visible from satellite, which allows it to be used for other purposes in the United States and around the world, for example, drought monitoring in Africa, forest fire protection in Brazil and landslide studies in Venezuela.&quot;

<text>The Chartreuse Mountains ( ) are a mountain range in southeastern France, stretching from the city of Grenoble in the south to the Lac du Bourget in the north. They are part of the French Prealps, which continue as the Bauges to the north and the Vercors to the south.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Chartreuse&quot; is derived from the village now known as Saint-Pierre-de-Chartreuse, earlier &quot;Catorissium&quot;, &quot;Cantourisa&quot;, &quot;Caturissium&quot;, and &quot;Chatrousse&quot;. It appears to be of Gaulish origin; and is perhaps related to the name of the Caturiges tribe.

==Geography==
The mountain range rises between Grenoble (south), Chambéry (north), Voiron and Saint-Laurent-du-Pont (west) and Grésivaudan (&quot;Isère valley&quot;, east)

*, long, deep.
* Réseau de la Dent de Crolles - about long, deep.
* Système du Granier, long, deep.
* Réseau de malissard, long, deep.
* Système Pinet-Brouillard, long, deep.

==Geology==
The lithology is dominated by limestone, and several hundred kilometres of cave passages lie beneath the hills, including the world-famous 60 km long Dent de Crolles system.


==Winter sports resorts==
Chartreuse winter sports resorts include :
* Le Désert d&#x27;Entremont, where the use of snowshoes has been particularly developed
* Granier en Chartreuse

==Environment==
* The Parc Naturel Régional de la Chartreuse was founded in May 1995.
* The Réserve Naturelle des Hauts de Chartreuse was founded in 1997. It includes seven Isère townships and four Savoie townships.

==Miscellaneous==
The Chartreuse Mountains gave their name to the monastery of the Grande Chartreuse, the monastic Carthusian Order takes its name from these mountains, where its first hermitage was founded in 1084. Also derived from the mountain range&#x27;s name is that of the alcoholic cordial Chartreuse produced by the monks since the 1740s, and of the chartreuse colour, greenish hue of the Chartreuse liqueur, named after the drink.

<doc id="320062" wikidata="Q1435063" url="?curid=320062" title="Vercors massif">
<text>The Vercors massif (; ) is a mountain range in eastern France consisting of rugged plateaus and mountains straddling the &quot;départements&quot; of Isère and Drôme in the French Prealps. It lies west of the Dauphiné Alps, from which it is separated by the rivers Drac and Isère. The cliffs at the massif&#x27;s eastern limit face the city of Grenoble.

==Background==
Over time, various features of the complex geography have been recognised including, the Quatre Montagnes (four mountains), the Coulmes (gorges), the Vercors Drômois (Drome Vercors), the Hauts-Plateaux (high plateaus) and, in the foothills, Royans, Gervanne, Diois, and Trièves.

The massif is sometimes called the &quot;fortress&quot;. The movement of people tends to be between the massif and the surrounding plains rather than between the various parts of the massif itself.

Until the mid twentieth century, the name &quot;Vercors&quot; was used to describe only the township of La Chapelle-en-Vercors (with Royans), and the northern area around Lans-en-Vercors, Villard-de-Lans, Autrans, and Méaudre (with Grenoble) and was known as the &quot;Four Mountains&quot; area.

In June and July 1944, the massif became important in World War II with the establishment of the Free Republic of Vercors, led by the Maquis du Vercors, a base for the French Resistance against German occupation.

The Vercors includes the largest alpine karst area in the Northern French pre-alps, and contains a number of large and deep cave systems. These include Gouffre Berger, which is over deep, and the Réseau de Coufin-Chevaline (grotte de Choranche), a show cave in the Bourne Gorge which has almost of mapped passages.

The Vercors has several resorts for cross-country skiing and for down-hill skiing. Villard-de-Lans is the biggest down-hill ski resort.

This sporting area is environmentally protected, and although the natural environment has been drastically altered throughout history for the purposes of agriculture and forestry, plans for afforestation will make it one of the major forests of Metropolitan France and a reserve for species such as the southern tulip and black grouse, two symbols of the park, as well as the re-introduced griffon vulture and the alpine ibex. The differences in climate and altitude across the Vercors are reflected in the high level of diversity in the fauna and flora.

Members of the cult the Order of the Solar Temple infamously committed mass murder-suicide in the Vercors in 1995.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Massif du Vercors&quot; is derived from the name of a local tribe who lived in the area at the time of the Roman conquest of Gaul, who were known as the Vertamocorii (also spelled Vertamocori, Vertacomicorii, or Vertacomocorii), meaning &quot;excellent troops&quot; or &quot;troops of the summit&quot;. Modern inhabitants are referred to as &quot;Vertacomiriens&quot;.

Prior to the 1900s, the name Vercors referred only to the upper valleys of the Vernaison near the township of La Chapelle-en-Vercors. At the beginning of the 20th century, Henri Ferrand explored the massif, taking numerous photographs, publishing books, and describing the geology of the mountains. Ferrand was the first to use the term &quot;Vercors&quot; in its extended contemporary sense. The geographers Raoul Blanchard and Jules Blache, popularised the term in the late 1920s and early 1930s. By the 1950s, the term was ubiquitous.

==Geography==

===Location===
The Vercors Massif lies in the Prealps, in the south-east France, straddling the departments of Drôme and Isère, both of which are part of the Rhône-Alpes region, about south-east of Lyon. The massif covers with a north–south length of and an east–west width of .

The massif is surrounded by the Chartreuse Mountains to the north, the Matheysine area of the Dauphiné Alps to the east, and the Diois Massif to the south. In the far south-east, the massif joins with the col de Menée.

The massif is drained in the north-east and the north-west by the Isère, in the east by the Drac, and in the south by the Drôme. The western side overlooks the Rhône Valley.

===Topography===

====Geomorphology====

The Vercors Massif is known as &quot;the fortress&quot; or as &quot;the French dolomites&quot; because of its geomorphology. The massif is likened to a plateau: the fall from the massif to its inner valleys is a few hundred metres, while the fall to the surrounding areas is between and .

The crest of the eastern edge has several summits over . The interior varies between and . The massif also has wide valleys including the valley of Lans-en-Vercors, the regions around Autrans, and La Chapelle-en-Vercors, and plateaus including forêt des Coulmes, forêt de Lente, and the high plateau. There are a number of deeply incised gorges, including the Bourne and Furon Gorges. These have imposing cliffs often exceeding such as the Combe Laval and the Cirque d&#x27;Archiane.

Mont Aiguille stands apart from the rest of the massif as the result of erosion. Other parts are isolated from the rest of the massif due to its relief. For example, to reach Gresse-en-Vercors in the south, one must travel via the col de Rousset or journey via Saint-Nizier-du-Moucherotte in the north. The villages at the far northern end were isolated by a landslide near the Mortier tunnel. Another example is the Peuil plateau in the east. During the Ice Age, the Grésivaudan glacier reached the Peuil plateau leaving a marsh.

====Sub-divisions====

The central part of the Vercors Massif is divided into several regions.

The Coulmes, in the north-west, are heavily covered in forest. Folds of Urgonian limestone are rounded, making the area appear mountainous.

The four mountains area has been developed for tourism and skiing but is also known for its traditional activities such as the breeding of dairy cows and cheese making. The main villages, Autrans, Méaudre, Lans-en-Vercors, and Villard-de-Lans, are spread over two plateaus covered by wooded hills.

The Drômois Vercors is an area made up of a number of smaller plateaus. In the north of the Drômois Vercors there are several gorges which are traversed by roads cut into the cliffs. Grassy areas are used as pastures in the summer months, and the biannual migration (transhumance) of animals is a period of celebration for the people of Die.

The &quot;Haut-Plateaux&quot; (high plateaus) are the highest wilderness areas of the massif. The area is managed and the pastures are used for grazing in the summer.

At the fringes of the massif, the Vercors regional park has four geographical areas. The Royans, the north-west foothills are the location of walnuts growing. Three valleys descend to the edge of the Royans: the Gorges de la Bourne, the cirque of the Combe Laval, and the Échevis valley, including the Grands and the Petits Goulets.

The Gervanne, in the south-west, is a rugged area of hills at the foot of the plateau, with picturesque villages. It looks towards Crest.

The Diois is a part of the Drôme valley around Die. This region has a Mediterranean character, with vineyards and fields of lavender. It acts as a buffer between Gervanne and the interior of the massif.

The Trièves, in the east, is a low hilly plateau, which lies between the highest summits of the Vercors and the gorge carved out by the Drac.

The Tunnel du Mortier links Montaud with Autrans, at an altitude of . It was closed on 20 April 1992 after a landslide of 20,000 m3 of rock which involved part of the slope to the north of the route. The instability of the slopes have proved an impediment for the realisation of further work below the site, particularly work on the gorges d&#x27;Engins to Sassenage road, the D531.

==Climate==
The climate of the Vercors due to its elevation is much more rigorous than the lowlands surrounding the massif. The village of La-Chapelle-en-Vercors, approximately in the center of the massif, has a Dfb climate under the Köppen Classification system. Winters are cold; summers are warm; and precipitation, often snow in the winter, is abundant in all seasons.

===Geology===
The constituent rocks of the Vercors were formed by sedimentation about 165 million years ago, in the middle Jurassic period, at the bottom of the Piemont-Liguria Ocean. The deposition of animal material formed limestone, with detritus rocks, formed primarily from the erosion of marl from the Variscan orogeny formed the massif in a period marked by changing climatic conditions and ocean depth. At Diois and Trièves is a layer of the massif, formed in the Tithonian age. 
Then, about 130 million years ago, in the Cretaceous period, a rise in temperatures combined with shallow waters led to the development of coral reefs, which abounded with molluscs, particularly rudists. These were the origin of the Urgonian Limestone which forms the upper part of the massif, more prominently in the northern half. This primitive fauna left numerous fossils, some of which have been found at a site near Rencurel in the Coulmes.

In the Paleogene period, the Tethys ocean closed up and at the start of the Miocene, the raising of the Alps involved the thrusting of a nappe to the west. Sedimentary rocks were raised above the current location of the Massif des Écrins and faulted and folded in the process.

Subsequent marine transgressions were responsible for secondary sedimentation in the basins. There was widening of the gorges and erosion of the cliffs from runoff, leading to the formation of the molasse in the Royans and also in the valleys of Lans, Autrans, and Rencurel. At the close of the Miocene, a new period of uplifting brought about the final receding of the sea.

Once formed, the massif underwent severe erosion, which accentuated the relief. The different synclines grew larger, eventually forming valleys including those of Autrans, Méaudre and Lans, Villard, Corrençon, the Col de Romeyère and the Col de Rousset. The water hollowed out the cirque of Archiane, the steephead valley of Bournillon, and the Combe Laval.

==In popular culture==
The Vercors have appeared in many films, including;
* &quot;La Bride sur le cou&quot; (1961)
* &quot;Wish Me Luck&quot; (1987) Season 3
* &quot;Une hirondelle a fait le printemps&quot; (2001)
* &quot;The Butterfly&quot; (2002)
* &quot;To Paint or Make Love&quot; (2006)
* &quot;My son&quot; (2017)

<text>Anthropological linguistics is the subfield of linguistics and anthropology which deals with the place of language in its wider social and cultural context, and its role in making and maintaining cultural practices and societal structures. While many linguists believe that a true field of anthropological linguistics is nonexistent, preferring the term linguistic anthropology to cover this subfield, many others regard the two as interchangeable.

== History ==
Although researchers studied the two fields together at various points in the nineteenth century, the intersection of anthropology and linguistics significantly grew in prominence during the early twentieth century. As American scholarship became increasingly interested in the diversity of Native American societies in the New World, anthropologists and linguists worked in conjunction to analyze Native American languages and to study how language related to the origins, distribution, and characteristics of these indigenous populations.

This interdisciplinary approach distinguished American anthropology from its European counterpart; while European anthropology largely focused on ethnography, American anthropology began to integrate linguistics and other disciplines. Anthropological linguistics initially focused largely on unwritten language, but now examines languages both with and without written traditions.

Early anthropological linguists primarily focused on three major areas: linguistic description, classification, and methodology.

* Linguistic Description: Scholars such as Franz Boas, Edward Sapir, Leonard Bloomfield, and Mary Haas drafted descriptions of linguistic structure and the linguistic characteristics of different languages. They conducted research as fieldwork, using recordings of texts from native speakers and performing analysis to categorize the texts by linguistic form and genre.
* Classification: Classification involved outlining the genetic relationships among languages. Linguistic classifications allowed anthropological linguists to organize large amounts of information about specific populations. By classifying language, scholars could systematize and order data from their ethnographic work.
* Methodology: By analytically breaking down language, anthropological linguistics could use the constituent parts to derive social and cultural information. It also made pattern-identification possible, with Boas and Sapir using these procedures to show that linguistic patterning was unrealized among speakers of a given language.

== Overview ==

Anthropological linguistics is one of many disciplines which studies the role of languages in the social lives of individuals and within communities. To do this, experts have had to understand not only the logic behind linguistic systems – such as their grammars – but also record the activities in which those systems are used. In the 1960s and 1970s, sociolinguistics and anthropological linguistics were often viewed as one single field of study, but they have since become more separate as more academic distance has been put between them. Though there are many similarities and a definite sharing of topics – such as gender and language – they are two related but separate entities. Anthropological linguistics came about in the United States as a subfield of anthropology, when anthropologists were beginning to study the indigenous cultures, and the indigenous languages could no longer be ignored, and quickly morphed into the subfield of linguistics that it is known as today.

Anthropological linguistics has had a major impact in the studies of such areas as visual perception (especially colour) and bioregional democracy, both of which are concerned with distinctions that are made in languages about perceptions of the surroundings.

Conventional linguistic anthropology also has implications for sociology and self-organization of peoples. Study of the Penan people, for instance, reveals that their language employs six different and distinct words whose best English translation is &quot;we&quot;. Anthropological linguistics studies these distinctions, and relates them to types of societies and to actual bodily adaptation to the senses, much as it studies distinctions made in languages regarding the colours of the rainbow: seeing the tendency to increase the diversity of terms, as evidence that there are distinctions that bodies in this environment &quot;must&quot; make, leading to situated knowledge and perhaps a situated ethics, whose final evidence is the differentiated set of terms used to denote &quot;we&quot;.

The two branches of anthropological linguistics are nomenclatural/classificational and ethnographic/sociolinguistics.

Indexicality refers to language forms that is tied to meaning through association of specific and general, as opposed to direct naming. For example, an anthropological linguist may utilize indexicality to analyze what an individual&#x27;s use of language reveals about his or her social class. Indexicality is inherent in form-function relationships.

== Distinction from other subfields ==
Although the terms anthropological linguistics and linguistic anthropology are often viewed as being synonymous, specialists often make a distinction between them. While anthropological linguistics is considered a subfield of linguistics, linguistic anthropology is generally considered to be a subfield of anthropology. Anthropological linguistics also uses more distinctly linguistic methodology, and studies languages as &quot;linguistic phenomena.&quot; Ultimately, anthropological linguistics focuses on the cultural and social meaning of language, with more of an emphasis on linguistic structure. Conversely, linguistic anthropology uses more anthropological methods (such as participant observation and fieldwork) to analyze language through a cultural framework and determine the rules of its social use.

While anthropological linguistics uses language to determine cultural understandings, sociolinguistics views language itself as a social institution. Anthropological linguistics is largely interpretative, striving to determine the significance behind the use of language through its forms, registers, and styles. Sociolinguistics instead examines how language relates to various social groups and identities like race, gender, class, and age.

== Structures ==

=== Phonology ===
A common variation of linguistics that focuses on the sounds within speech of any given language. It outlines why phonetic features identify words.

Phonology puts a large focus on the systematic structure of the sounds being observed.

=== Morphology ===
Morphology in linguistics commonly looks at the structure of words within a language to develop a better understanding for the word form being used. It is the branch of linguistics that deals with words, their internal structure, and their formation. Morphology looks broadly at the connection of word forms within a specific language in relation to the culture or environment it is rooted within.

=== Methodology ===
There are two major trends in the theoretical and methodological study of attitudes in the social sciences - mentalist and behaviorist. The mentalist trend treats attitude as a mediating concept while the behaviorist trend operationally defines it as a probability concept, though in research practice both derive their attitude measures from response variation. While there are many different views concerning the structure and components of attitudes, there is, however, an overwhelming agreement that attitudes are learned, lasting, and positively related to behavior. Methodology in attitude studies includes direct and indirect measures of all kinds, but language attitude studies have tended to make more use of questionnaires than of other methods. The matched guise technique - a sociolinguistic experimental technique used to determine the true feelings of an individual or community towards a specific language, dialect, or accent - has been extensively used for studies relating to the social significance of languages and language varieties. A special adaptation of this technique, called mirror image, appears promising for measuring consensual evaluations of language switching at the situational level. Situational based self-report instruments such as those used by Greenfield and Fishman also promise to be very effective instruments for studies pertaining to normative views concerning the situational use of languages and language varieties. The commitment measure has been found to be particularly suited for collecting data on behavioral tendencies. Data obtained through interviewing may be difficult to process and score – and may provide bias from those being interviewed – but the research interview can be particularly effective for attitude assessment, especially when used to complement the observational method. Data collected through the observational method can be formally processed like data obtained through more formalized instruments if attempts are made to record the data in more public forms instead of only through the approach most characteristic for this kind of data have used so far.

Many linguists believe that comparisons of linguistic and social behavior have been blocked by the fact that linguistic and anthropological studies are rarely based on comparable sets of data. While an anthropologist&#x27;s description refers to specific communities, linguistic analysis refers to a single language or dialect, and the behaviors formed through verbal signs and structural similarities. The process of linguistic analysis is oriented towards the discovery of unitary, structurally similar wholes. The effect of these procedures is the selection of one single variety out of the many varieties that characterize everyday speech and behavior. English is often thought of as one single language, as though people forget the many dialects and accents that come with it. English spoken in the United States of America will not be the same English spoken in Australia, or in the countries of Africa. Even American English spoken in New York will not be exactly the same as American English spoken in Alabama.

== Code-switching ==
While code-switching, a situation in which a speaker alternates between two or more languages, or language varieties, in the context of a single conversation, is not the only form of linguistic variability to carry a social, or referential meaning, it does provide a particularly clear approach to understanding the relationship between social processes and linguistic forms, because both the social and the linguistic boundaries in question tend to be most evident than in other monolingual settings. In anthropological linguistics, code-switching has been approached as a structurally unified phenomenon whose significance comes from a universal pattern of relationships between form, function, and context. Many linguists are approaching code-switching as a form of verbal strategy, which represents the ways in which the linguistic resources available to individuals may vary according to the nature of their social boundaries within their communities. While the emphasis is on language use in social interaction as the preferred focus for examining exactly how those processes work, it is clear that future research must take into account the situation of that interaction within the specific community, or across communities. The study of code-switching will increasingly be able to contribute to an understanding of the nature of speech communities.

== Related fields ==

Anthropological linguistics is concerned with

* Descriptive (or synchronic) linguistics: Describing dialects (forms of a language used by a specific speech community). This study includes phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, and grammar.
* Historical (or diachronic) linguistics: Describing changes in dialects and languages over time. This study includes the study of linguistic divergence and language families, comparative linguistics, etymology, and philology.
* Ethnolinguistics: Analyzing the relationship between culture, thought, and language.
* Sociolinguistics: Analyzing the social functions of language and the social, political, and economic relationships among and between members of speech communities.

<text>Old French (, , ; ) was the language spoken in most of the northern half of France approximately between the late 8th and mid-14th centuries. Rather than a unified language, Old French was a group of Romance dialects, mutually intelligible yet diverse. These dialects came to be collectively known as the , contrasting with the , the emerging Occitano-Romance languages of Occitania, now the south of France.

The mid-14th century witnessed the emergence of Middle French, the language of the French Renaissance in the Île-de-France region; this dialect was a predecessor to Modern French. Other dialects of Old French evolved themselves into modern forms (, Gallo, Norman, Picard, Walloon, etc.), each with its linguistic features and history.

The region where Old French was spoken natively roughly extended to the northern half of the Kingdom of France and its vassals (including parts of the Angevin Empire), and the duchies of Upper and Lower Lorraine to the east (corresponding to modern north-eastern France and Belgian Wallonia), but the influence of Old French was much wider, as it was carried to England and the Crusader states as the language of a feudal elite and commerce.

==Areal and dialectal divisions==

The area of Old French in contemporary terms corresponded to the northern parts of the Kingdom of France (including Anjou and Normandy, which in the 12th century were ruled by the Plantagenet kings of England), Upper Burgundy and the Duchy of Lorraine. The Norman dialect was also spread to England and Ireland, and during the Crusades, Old French was also spoken in the Kingdom of Sicily, and in the Principality of Antioch and the Kingdom of Jerusalem in the Levant.

As part of the emerging Gallo-Romance dialect continuum, the were contrasted with the , at the time also called &quot;Provençal&quot;, adjacent to the Old French area in the southwest, and with the Gallo-Italic group to the southeast. The Franco-Provençal group developed in Upper Burgundy, sharing features with both French and Provençal; it may have begun to diverge from the as early as the late 8th century and is attested as a distinct Gallo-Romance variety by the 12th century.

Dialects or variants of Old French include:
* Burgundian in Burgundy, then an independent duchy whose capital was at Dijon;
* Picard of Picardy and Romance Flanders, with Lille, Amiens and Arras as some of the more prominent cities. It was said that the Picard language began at the east door of Notre-Dame de Paris, so far-reaching was its influence. It would also spread northwards in the area of Boulogne-sur-Mer that had a strong presence of Old Dutch and Middle Dutch;
* Old Norman, in Normandy, whose principal cities were Caen and Rouen. The Norman Conquest of England brought many Norman-speaking aristocrats into Britain. Most of the older Norman (sometimes called &quot;French&quot;) words in English reflect its influence, which became a conduit for the introduction into the Anglo-Norman realm, as did Anglo-Norman control of Anjou and Gascony and other continental possessions. Anglo-Norman was a language that reflected a shared culture on both sides of the English Channel. Ultimately, the language declined and fell, becoming Law French, a jargon spoken by lawyers that was used in English law until the reign of Charles II of England; however, Norman varieties still survive in Normandy and the Channel Islands as regional languages: Jèrriais, Guernésiais, Sercquiais, and Auregnais
* Walloon, around Namur, now in Wallonia, Belgium;
* Gallo of the Duchy of Brittany;
* Lorrain of the Duchy of Lorraine.

Some modern languages are derived from Old French dialects other than Classical French, which is based on the Île-de-France dialect. They include Angevin, Berrichon, Bourguignon-Morvandiau, Champenois, Franc-Comtois, Gallo, Lorrain, Norman, Picard, Poitevin, Saintongeais, and Walloon.

==History==
===Evolution and separation from Vulgar Latin===
Beginning with Plautus&#x27; time (254–184 ), one can see phonological changes between Classical Latin and what is called Vulgar Latin, the common spoken language of the Western Roman Empire. Vulgar Latin differed from Classical Latin in phonology and morphology as well as exhibiting lexical differences; however, they were mutually intelligible until the 7th century when Classical Latin &quot;died&quot; as a daily spoken language, and had to be learned as a second language (though it was long thought of as the formal version of the spoken language). Vulgar Latin was the ancestor of the Romance languages, including Old French.

By the late 8th century, when the Carolingian Renaissance began, native speakers of Romance idioms continued to use Romance orthoepy rules while speaking and reading Latin. When the most prominent scholar of Western Europe at the time, English deacon Alcuin, was tasked by Charlemagne with improving the standards of Latin writing in France, not being a native Romance speaker himself, he prescribed a pronunciation based on a fairly literal interpretation of Latin spelling. For example, in a radical break from the traditional system, a word such as now had to be read aloud precisely as it was spelled rather than (later spelled as ).

Such a radical change had the effect of rendering Latin sermons completely unintelligible to the general Romance-speaking public, which prompted officials a few years later, at the Third Council of Tours, to instruct priests to read sermons aloud in the old way, in or &#x27;plain Roman[ce] speech&#x27;.

As there was now no unambiguous way to indicate whether a given text was to be read aloud as Latin or Romance, various attempts were made in France to devise a new orthography for the latter; among the earliest examples are parts of the Oaths of Strasbourg and the &quot;Sequence of Saint Eulalia&quot;.

===Non-Latin influences===
==== Gaulish ====
Some Gaulish words influenced Vulgar Latin and, through this, other Romance languages. For example, classical Latin was uniformly replaced in Vulgar Latin by &#x27;nag, work horse&#x27;, derived from Gaulish (cf. Welsh , Breton ), yielding , Occitan (), Catalan , Spanish , Portuguese , Italian , Romanian , and, by extension, English &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot; (both via different forms of [Old] French: Old Norman and Francien).
An estimated 200 words of Gaulish etymology survive in Modern French, for example 
 and .

Within historical phonology and studies of language contact, various phonological changes have been posited as caused by a Gaulish substrate, although there is some debate. One of these is considered certain, because this fact is clearly attested in the Gaulish-language epigraphy on the pottery found at la Graufesenque ( 1st century).
There, the Greek word (written in Latin) appears as . The consonant clusters /ps/ and /pt/ shifted to /xs/ and /xt/, e.g. &gt; &quot;*kaxsa&quot; &gt; &quot;caisse&quot; ( Italian )
or &quot;captīvus&quot; &gt; &quot;*kaxtivus&quot; &gt; (mod. &quot;chétif&quot;; cf. Irish &quot;cacht&quot; ; ≠ Italian , Portuguese , Spanish ).
This phonetic evolution is common in its later stages with the shift of the Latin cluster /kt/ in Old French ( &gt; &quot;fait&quot;, ≠ Italian , Portuguese , Spanish ; or &quot;lactem&quot;* &gt; &quot;lait&quot;, ≠ Italian , Portuguese , Spanish ). 
This means that both /pt/ and /kt/ must have first merged into /kt/ in the history of Old French, after which this /kt/ shifted to /xt/. In parallel, /ps/ and /ks/ merged into /ks/ before shifting to /xs/, apparently under Gaulish influence.

The Celtic Gaulish language is thought to have survived into the 6th century in France, despite considerable cultural Romanization.
Coexisting with Latin, Gaulish helped shape the Vulgar Latin dialects that developed into French, with effects including loanwords and calques 
(including , the word for &quot;yes&quot;), sound changes shaped by Gaulish influence, 
and influences in conjugation and word order. 
A computational study from 2003 suggests that early gender shifts may have been motivated by the gender of the corresponding word in Gaulish.

==== Frankish ====
The pronunciation, vocabulary, and syntax of the Vulgar Latin spoken in Roman Gaul in late antiquity were modified by the Old Frankish language, spoken by the Franks who settled in Gaul from the 5th century and conquered the future Old French-speaking area by the 530s. The word itself is derived from the Late Latin name for the Franks.

The Old Frankish language had a definitive influence on the development of Old French, which partly explains why the earliest attested Old French documents are older than the earliest attestations in other Romance languages (e.g. Strasbourg Oaths, Sequence of Saint Eulalia). It is the result of an earlier gap created between Classical Latin and its evolved forms, which slowly reduced and eventually severed the mutual intelligibility between the two. 
The Old Low Franconian influence is also believed to be responsible for the differences between the and the 
 (Occitan), being that various parts of Northern France remained bilingual between Latin and Germanic for some time, and these areas correspond precisely to where the first documents in Old French were written.

This Germanic language shaped the popular Latin spoken here and gave it a very distinctive identity compared to the other future Romance languages. The first noticeable influence is the substitution of the Latin melodic accent with a Germanic stress and its result was diphthongization, differentiation between long and short vowels, the fall of the unaccented syllable and of the final vowels:
* , &quot;-a&quot; &gt; &gt; French (&gt; English &quot;dime&quot;; Italian , Spanish )
* &quot;dignitate&quot; &gt; (&gt; English &quot;dainty&quot;; Italian , Romanian )
* &quot;catena&quot; &gt; (&gt; English &quot;chain&quot;; Italian , Spanish , Occitan , Portuguese )

Additionally, two phonemes that had long since died out in Vulgar Latin were reintroduced: and (&gt; &quot;g(u)-&quot;, &quot;w-&quot; cf. Picard &quot;w-&quot;):
* &quot;altu&quot; &gt; (influenced by Old Low Frankish [] &quot;*hōh&quot; ; ≠ Italian, Portuguese , Catalan , Old Occitan )
* &gt; &quot;wespe&quot;, , French , Picard , Walloon , all (influenced by ; ≠ Occitan , Italian , Spanish )
* &gt; French (influenced by with analogous fruits, when they are not ripe; ≠ Occitan , Italian )
* &quot;vulpiculu&quot; (from ) &gt; &quot;golpilz&quot;, Picard (influenced by ; ≠ Occitan , Old Italian &quot;volpiglio&quot;, Spanish )

In contrast, the Italian, Portuguese and Spanish words of Germanic origin borrowed from French or directly from Germanic retain ~ , e.g. Italian, Spanish , alongside in French ). These examples show a clear consequence of bilingualism, that sometimes even changed the first syllable of the Latin words.
One example of a Latin word influencing an loan is &quot;framboise&quot; , from , from (cf. Dutch &quot;braambes&quot;, &quot;braambezie&quot;; akin to German , English dial. &quot;bramberry&quot;) blended with &quot;fraga&quot; or , which explains the replacement &gt; and in turn the final &quot;-se&quot; of &quot;framboise&quot; added to to make &quot;freise&quot;, modern (≠ Walloon , Occitan , Romanian , Italian , &quot;fravola&quot; ).

Mildred Pope estimated that perhaps still 15% of the vocabulary of Modern French derives from Germanic sources. This proportion was larger in Old French, because Middle French borrowed heavily from Latin and Italian.
===Earliest written Old French===
The earliest documents said to be written in the Gallo-Romance that prefigures French – after the Reichenau and Kassel glosses (8th and 9th centuries) – are the Oaths of Strasbourg (treaties and charters into which King Charles the Bald entered in 842):

The second-oldest document in Old French is the Eulalia sequence, which is important for linguistic reconstruction of Old French pronunciation due to its consistent spelling.

The royal House of Capet, founded by Hugh Capet in 987, inaugurated the development of northern French culture in and around Île-de-France, which slowly but firmly asserted its ascendency over the more southerly areas of Aquitaine and Tolosa (Toulouse); however, the Capetians&#x27; , the forerunner of modern standard French, did not begin to become the common speech of all of France until after the French Revolution.

===Transition to Middle French===
In the Late Middle Ages, the Old French dialects diverged into a number of distinct , among which Middle French proper was the dialect of the Île-de-France region.
During the Early Modern period, French was established as the official language of the Kingdom of France throughout the realm, including the –speaking territories in the south.
It was only in the 17th to 18th centuries – with the development especially of popular literature of the &quot;Bibliothèque bleue&quot; – that a standardized Classical French spread throughout France alongside the regional dialects.

==Literature==
The material and cultural conditions in France and associated territories around the year 1100 triggered what Charles Homer Haskins termed the &quot;Renaissance of the 12th century&quot;, resulting in a profusion of creative works in a variety of genres. Old French gave way to Middle French in the mid-14th century, paving the way for early French Renaissance literature of the 15th century.

The earliest extant French literary texts date from the ninth century, but very few texts before the 11th century have survived. The first literary works written in Old French were saints&#x27; lives. The &quot;Canticle of Saint Eulalie&quot;, written in the second half of the 9th century, is generally accepted as the first such text. Further, some of the earliest medieval music has lyrics in Old French, composed by the earliest composers known by name.

At the beginning of the 13th century, Jean Bodel, in his &quot;Chanson de Saisnes&quot;, divided medieval French narrative literature into three subject areas: the Matter of France or Matter of Charlemagne; the Matter of Rome (romances in an ancient setting); and the Matter of Britain (Arthurian romances and Breton lais). The first of these is the subject area of the (&quot;songs of exploits&quot; or &quot;songs of (heroic) deeds&quot;), epic poems typically composed in ten-syllable assonanced (occasionally rhymed) &quot;laisses&quot;. More than one hundred have survived in around three hundred manuscripts. The oldest and most celebrated of the is &quot;The Song of Roland&quot; (earliest version composed in the late 11th century).

Bertrand de Bar-sur-Aube in his &quot;Girart de Vienne&quot; set out a grouping of the into three cycles: the &quot;Geste du roi&quot; centering on Charlemagne, the &quot;Geste de Garin de Monglane&quot; (whose central character was William of Orange), and the &quot;Geste de Doon de Mayence&quot; or the &quot;rebel vassal cycle&quot;, the most famous characters of which were Renaud de Montauban and Girart de Roussillon.

A fourth grouping, not listed by Bertrand, is the &quot;Crusade cycle&quot;, dealing with the First Crusade and its immediate aftermath.

Jean Bodel&#x27;s other two categories—the &quot;Matter of Rome&quot; and the &quot;Matter of Britain&quot;—concern the French romance or &quot;roman&quot;. Around a hundred verse romances survive from the period 1150–1220. From around 1200 on, the tendency was increasingly to write the romances in prose (many of the earlier verse romances were adapted into prose versions), although new verse romances continued to be written to the end of the 14th century.

The most important romance of the 13th century is the &quot;Romance of the Rose&quot;, which breaks considerably from the conventions of the chivalric adventure story.

Medieval French lyric poetry began in the late 11th century, arising from the poetic and cultural traditions in Southern France and Provence—including Toulouse and the Aquitaine region, and flourished until the end of the 13th century. 
These first lyric poets composed and performed in Old Provençal (Old Occitan) and were called from the verb &quot;to compose, to discuss, to invent&quot;. The French word is borrowed from this Occitan word. Inspired by the Provençal poets, lyric poetry spread to their Northern French counterparts, who instead spoke and were known as . 
It is thought that the Provençal troubadours were originally influenced by music and poetry from the Hispano-Arab world.

By the late 13th century, the poetic tradition in France had begun to develop in ways that differed significantly from the troubadour poets, both in content and in the use of certain fixed forms. The new poetic (and musical) tendencies are apparent in the &quot;Roman de Fauvel&quot; in 1310 and 1314, a satire on abuses in the medieval church, filled with medieval motets, lais, rondeaux and other new secular forms of poetry and music (mostly anonymous, but with several pieces by Philippe de Vitry, who would coin the expression &quot;ars nova&quot; to distinguish the new musical practice from the music of the immediately preceding age). The best-known poet and composer of &quot;ars nova&quot; secular music and chansons of the incipient Middle French period was Guillaume de Machaut. 

Discussions about the origins of non-religious theater ()—both drama and farce—in the Middle Ages remain controversial, but the idea of a continuous popular tradition stemming from Latin comedy and tragedy to the 9th century seems unlikely.

Most historians place the origin of medieval drama in the church&#x27;s liturgical dialogues and &quot;tropes&quot;. Mystery plays were eventually transferred from the monastery church to the chapter house or refectory hall and finally to the open air, and the vernacular was substituted for Latin. In the 12th century one finds the earliest extant passages in French appearing as refrains inserted into liturgical dramas in Latin, such as a Saint Nicholas (patron saint of the student clerics) play and a Saint Stephen play.
An early French dramatic play is () written in octosyllabic rhymed couplets with Latin stage directions (implying that it was written by Latin-speaking clerics for a lay public).

A large body of fables survive in Old French; these include (mostly anonymous) literature dealing with the recurring trickster character of Reynard the Fox. Marie de France was also active in this genre, producing the &quot;Ysopet&quot; (Little Aesop) series of fables in verse. Related to the fable was the more bawdy , which covered topics such as cuckolding and corrupt clergy. These would be an important source for Chaucer and for the Renaissance short story ( or ).

Among the earliest works of rhetoric and logic to appear in Old French were the translations of &quot;Rhetorica ad Herennium&quot; and Boethius&#x27; &quot;De topicis differentiis&quot; by John of Antioch in 1282.

In northern Italy, authors developed Franco-Italian, a mixed language of Old French and Venetian or Lombard used in literary works in the 13th and 14th centuries.

==Phonology==

Old French was constantly changing and evolving; however, the form in the late 12th century, as attested in a great deal of mostly poetic writings, can be considered standard. The writing system at this time was more phonetic than that used in most subsequent centuries. In particular, all written consonants (including final ones) were pronounced, except for &quot;s&quot; preceding non-stop consonants and &quot;t&quot; in &quot;et&quot;, and final &quot;e&quot; was pronounced . The phonological system can be summarised as follows:

===Consonants===
Notes:
* All obstruents (plosives, fricatives and affricates) were subject to word-final devoicing, which was usually indicated in the orthography.
* The affricates , , , became fricatives (, , , ) in Middle French.
** had three spellings – &quot;c&quot; before &quot;e&quot; or &quot;i&quot;, &quot;ç&quot; before other vowels, or &quot;z&quot; at the end of a word – as seen in cent&quot;, &quot;chançon&quot;, &quot;priz (&quot;a hundred, song, price&quot;).
** was written as &quot;z&quot;, as in &quot;doze&quot; , and occurred only in the middle of the word.
* (&quot;l mouillé&quot;), as in &quot;conseil&quot;, &quot;travaillier&quot; (&quot;advice, to work&quot;), became in Modern French.
* appeared not only in the middle of a word but also at the end, as in &quot;poing&quot; . At the end of a word, was later lost, leaving a nasalized vowel.
* was found only in Germanic loanwords or words influenced by Germanic (cf. &quot;haut, hurler&quot;). It was later lost as a consonant, though it was transphonologized as the so-called aspirated h that blocks liaison. In native Latin words, had been lost early on, as in &quot;om&quot;, &quot;uem&quot;, from &quot;homō&quot;.
* Intervocalic from both Latin and was lenited to in the early period (cf. contemporary Spanish: &quot;amado&quot; ). At the end of words, it was also devoiced to . In some texts it was sometimes written as &quot;dh&quot; or &quot;th&quot; (&quot;aiudha, cadhuna, Ludher, vithe&quot;). By 1100 it disappeared altogether.

===Vowels===
In Old French, the nasal vowels were not separate phonemes but only allophones of the oral vowels before a nasal consonant. The nasal consonant was fully pronounced; was pronounced ( ). Nasal vowels were present even in open syllables before nasals where Modern French has oral vowels, as in &quot;bone&quot; ( ).

===Monophthongs===
Notes:
* had formerly existed but then closed to ; the original Western Romance having previously been fronted to across most of what is now France and northern Italy.
** would later appear again when monophthongized and also when closed in certain positions (such as when it was followed by original or but not by , which later became ).
** may have similarly become closed to , in at least in some dialects, since it was borrowed into Middle English as &gt; ( &gt; &gt; English &quot;count&quot;; &gt; &gt; English &quot;round&quot;; &gt; &gt; English &quot;bounty&quot;). In any case, traces of such a change were erased in later stages of French, when the close nasal vowels were opened to become .
* may have existed in the unstressed third-person plural verb ending &quot;-ent&quot;, but it may have already passed to , which is known to have happened no later than the Middle French period.

===Diphthongs and triphthongs===
Notes:
* In Early Old French (up to about the mid-12th century), the spelling represented a diphthong instead of the later monophthong , and represented the diphthong , which merged with in Late Old French (except when it was nasalized).
* In Early Old French, the diphthongs described above as &quot;rising&quot; may have been falling diphthongs (, , ). In earlier works with vowel assonance, the diphthong written did not assonate with any pure vowels, which suggests that it cannot have simply been .
* The pronunciation of the vowels written and is debated. In the first records of Early Old French, they represented and were written as , and by Middle French, they had both merged as , but the transitional pronunciations are unclear.
* Early Old French had additional triphthongs and (equivalent to diphthongs followed by ); these soon merged into and respectively.
* The diphthong was rare and had merged into by Middle French ( &gt; ; &gt; Late &quot;suire&quot; &gt; ).

===Hiatus===
In addition to diphthongs, Old French had many instances of hiatus between adjacent vowels because of the loss of an intervening consonant. Manuscripts generally do not distinguish hiatus from true diphthongs, but modern scholarly transcription indicates it with a diaeresis, as in Modern French:
* *&quot;vidūta&quot; &gt; &quot;&quot; ( &quot;vue&quot;)
* &gt; &quot;&quot;, ( &quot;reine&quot;)
* &gt; &quot;&quot; ( &quot;pays&quot;)
* &gt; &quot;&quot; ( &quot;août&quot;)
* &gt; &quot;&quot; ( &quot;poêle&quot;)
* &quot;quaternum&quot; &gt; &quot;&quot; ( &quot;cahier&quot;)
* &quot;aetāticum&quot; &gt; &#x27;, &#x27; ( )

=== Sample text ===
Presented below is the first laisse of &quot;The Song of Roland&quot; along with a broad transcription reflecting reconstructed pronunciation .
==Grammar==
===Nouns===
Old French maintained a two-case system, with a nominative case and an oblique case, for longer than some other Romance languages as Spanish and Italian did. Case distinctions, at least in the masculine gender, were marked on both the definite article and the noun itself. Thus, the masculine noun was declined as follows:

In later Old French, the distinctions had become moribund. As in most other Romance languages, it was the oblique case form that usually survived to become the Modern French form: represents the old oblique (Latin accusative &quot;īnfantem&quot;); the nominative was ( &quot;īnfāns&quot;). There are some cases with significant differences between nominative and oblique forms (derived from Latin nouns with a stress shift between the nominative and other cases) in which either it is the nominative form that survives or both forms survive with different meanings:
* , (reflecting respectively *&quot;seiior&quot;, *&quot;seiiore&quot;) as well as (nom. †), originally &quot;senior&quot;, &quot;seniōrem&quot;, survive in the vocabulary of later French (, , ) as different ways to refer to a feudal lord.
* is the nominative form ( &lt; Latin nominative &quot;soror&quot;); the oblique form (&lt; Latin accusative &quot;sorōrem&quot;) no longer survives.
* is the nominative form ( &lt; &quot;presbyter&quot;); the oblique form , later (&lt; &quot;presbyterem&quot;) survives only in the Paris street name &quot;Rue des Prouvaires&quot;.
* indefinite pronoun continues Old French nominative (&lt; &quot;homō&quot;); continues the oblique form ( &lt; &quot;hominem&quot;).

In a few cases in which the only distinction between forms was the nominative &quot;-s&quot; ending, the &quot;-s&quot; was preserved. An example is &quot;&quot; (&lt; Latin nominative &quot;fīlius&quot;). It is irregular that the &quot;-s&quot; in the word is still pronounced today; but this has to do with later developments — namely the Middle French and Early Modern French system of pausal pronunciations.

As in Spanish and Italian, the neuter gender was eliminated, and most old neuter nouns became masculine. Some Latin neuter plurals, which ended in &quot;-a&quot;, were reanalysed as feminine singulars: was more widely used in the plural form , which was taken for a singular in Vulgar Latin and ultimately led to (feminine singular).

Nouns were declined in the following declensions:

Class I is derived from the Latin first declension. Class Ia mostly comes from Latin feminine nouns in the third declension. Class II is derived from the Latin second declension. Class IIa generally stems from second-declension nouns ending in &quot;-er&quot; and from third-declension masculine nouns; in both cases, the Latin nominative singular did not end in &quot;-s&quot;, which is preserved in Old French.

The classes show various analogical developments: Class I nominative plural &quot;-es&quot; from the accusative instead of &quot;-∅&quot; (&quot;-e&quot; after a consonant cluster) in Class I nominative plural ( &quot;-ae&quot;, although there is evidence to suggest this analogy had already occurred in VL), &quot;li pere&quot; instead of &quot;*li peres&quot; ( ) in Class IIa nominative plural, modelled on Class II, etc.

Class III nouns show a separate stem in the nominative singular that does not occur in any of the other forms:
* IIIa nouns are agent nouns that ended in &quot;-ātor&quot;, &quot;-ātōrem&quot; in Latin and preserve the stress shift.
* IIIb nouns also had a stress shift, from &quot;-ō&quot; to &quot;-ōnem&quot; although several IIIb nouns actually continue Frankish weak nouns with a similar inflection: Frankish becomes &quot;ber&quot; ~ &quot;baron&quot;.
* IIIc nouns are an Old French creation and have no clear Latin antecedent.
* IIId nouns represent various other third-declension Latin nouns with stress shift or a change of consonant (&quot;soror&quot;, &quot;sorōrem; īnfāns, īnfāntem; presbyter, presbyterem; seiior, seiiōrem; comes, comitem&quot;).

Regular feminine forms of masculine nouns are formed by adding an &quot;-e&quot; to the masculine stem unless the masculine stem already ends in &quot;-e&quot;. For example, becomes ( and ).

===Adjectives===
Adjectives agree in terms of number, gender and case with the noun that they are qualifying. Thus, a feminine plural noun in the nominative case requires any qualifying adjectives to be feminine, plural and nominative. For example, in , has to be in the feminine plural form.

Adjectives can be divided into three declensional classes:
* Class I corresponding roughly to Latin 1st- and 2nd-declension adjectives
* Class II corresponding roughly to Latin 3rd-declension adjectives
* Class III containing primarily the descendants of Latin synthetic comparative forms in &quot;-ior&quot;, &quot;-iōrem&quot;.

Class I adjectives have a feminine singular form (nominative and oblique) ending in &quot;-e&quot;. They can be further subdivided into two subclasses, based on the masculine nominative singular form. Class Ia adjectives have a masculine nominative singular ending in &quot;-s&quot;:
:

For Class Ib adjectives, the masculine nominative singular ends in &quot;-e&quot;, like the feminine. There are descendants of Latin second- and third-declension adjectives ending in &quot;-er&quot; in the nominative singular:
:

For Class II adjectives, the feminine singular is not marked by the ending &quot;-e&quot;:
:
An important subgroup of Class II adjectives is the present participial forms in &quot;-ant&quot;.

Class III adjectives have a stem alternation, resulting from stress shift in the Latin third declension and a distinct neuter form:
:

In later Old French, Classes II and III tended to be moved across to Class I, which was complete by Middle French. Modern French thus has only a single adjective declension, unlike most other Romance languages, which have two or more.

===Verbs===
Verbs in Old French show the same extreme phonological deformations as other Old French words; however, morphologically, Old French verbs are extremely conservative in preserving intact most of the Latin alternations and irregularities that had been inherited in Proto-Romance. Old French has much less analogical reformation than Modern French has and significantly less than the oldest stages of other languages (such as Old Spanish) despite that the various phonological developments in Gallo-Romance and Proto-French led to complex alternations in the majority of commonly-used verbs.

For example, the verb ( &quot;lavāre&quot;) is conjugated , , in the present indicative and , , in the present subjunctive, in both cases regular phonological developments from Latin indicative &quot;lavō&quot;, &quot;lavās&quot;, &quot;lavat&quot; and subjunctive &quot;lavem&quot;, &quot;lavēs&quot;, &quot;lavet&quot;. The following paradigm is typical in showing the phonologically regular but morphologically irregular alternations of most paradigms:
* The alternation ~ is a regular result of the final devoicing triggered by loss of final /o/ but not /a/.
* The alternation ~ is a regular result of the diphthongization of a stressed open syllable /a/ into /ae/ &gt; &gt; .
* The alternation ~ ~ in the subjunctive is a regular result of the simplification of the final clusters /fs/ and /ft/, resulting from loss of /e/ in final syllables.
Modern French, on the other hand, has , , in both indicative and subjunctive, reflecting significant analogical developments: analogical borrowing of unstressed vowel /a/, analogical &quot;-e&quot; in the first singular (from verbs like , with a regular &quot;-e&quot; ) and wholesale replacement of the subjunctive with forms modelled on &quot;-ir&quot;/&quot;-oir&quot;/&quot;-re&quot; verbs. 
All serve to eliminate the various alternations in the verb paradigm. Even modern &quot;irregular&quot; verbs are not immune from analogy: For example, , , (&quot;vivre&quot; ) has yielded to modern , , , eliminating the unpredictable &quot;-f&quot; in the first-person singular.

The simple past also shows extensive analogical reformation and simplification in Modern French, as compared with Old French.

The Latin pluperfect was preserved in very early Old French as a past tense with a value similar to a preterite or imperfect. For example, the Sequence of Saint Eulalia (878 AD) has past-tense forms such as (&lt; ), (&lt; ), alternating with past-tense forms from the Latin perfect (continued as the modern &quot;simple past&quot;). Old Occitan also preserved this tense, with a conditional value; Spanish still preserves this tense (the &quot;-ra&quot; imperfect subjunctive), as does Portuguese (in its original value as a pluperfect indicative).

====Verb alternations====
In Latin, stress was determined automatically by the number of syllables in a word and the weight (length) of the syllables. That resulted in certain automatic stress shifts between related forms in a paradigm, depending on the nature of the suffixes added. For example, in &quot;pensō&quot; , the first syllable was stressed, but in &quot;pensāmus&quot; , the second syllable was stressed. In many Romance languages, vowels diphthongized in stressed syllables under certain circumstances but not in unstressed syllables, resulting in alternations in verb paradigms: Spanish vs. ( ), or vs. ( ).

In the development of French, at least five vowels diphthongized in stressed, open syllables. Combined with other stress-dependent developments, that yielded 15 or so types of alternations in so-called strong verbs in Old French. For example, diphthongized to before nasal stops in stressed, open syllables but not in unstressed syllables, yielding ( &quot;amō&quot;) but ( &quot;amāmus&quot;).

The different types are as follows:
In Modern French, the verbs in the &quot;-er&quot; class have been systematically . Generally, the &quot;weak&quot; (unstressed) form predominates, but there are some exceptions (such as modern ). The only remaining alternations are in verbs like and , with unstressed alternating with stressed and in (largely-learned) verbs like , with unstressed alternating with stressed . Many of the non-&quot;er&quot; verbs have become obsolete, and many of the remaining verbs have been levelled; however, a few alternations remain in what are now known as irregular verbs, such as , ; , ; and , .

Some verbs had a more irregular alternation between different-length stems, with a longer, stressed stem alternating with a shorter, unstressed stem. That was a regular development stemming from the loss of unstressed intertonic vowels, which remained when they were stressed:
* &lt; &quot;adiūtō&quot;, &quot;adiūtāre&quot;
* &lt; &quot;adratiōnō&quot;, &quot;adratiōnāre&quot;
* &lt; dēratiōnō&quot;, &quot;dēratiōnāre&quot;
* &lt; &quot;disiēiūnō&quot;, &quot;disiēiūnāre&quot;
* &lt; &quot;mandūcō&quot;, &quot;mandūcāre&quot;
* &lt; &quot;*paraulō&quot;, &quot;*paraulāre&quot; &lt; &quot;parabolō&quot;, &quot;parabolāre&quot;

The alternation of &quot;je desjun&quot;, &quot;disner&quot; is particularly complicated; it appears that:

Both stems have become full verbs in Modern French: and . Furthermore, does not derive directly from (&lt; , with total loss of unstressed &quot;-ēi-&quot;). Instead, it comes from , based on the alternative form (&lt; , with loss of only &quot;-i-&quot;, likely influenced by &lt; &lt; &lt; : &quot;iē-&quot; is an initial rather than intertonic so the vowel &quot;-ē-&quot; does not disappear).

<text>The First Dynasty of ancient Egypt (Dynasty I) covers the first series of Egyptian kings to rule over a unified Egypt. It immediately follows the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt, by Menes, or Narmer, and marks the beginning of the Early Dynastic Period, when power was centered at Thinis.

The date of this period is subject to scholarly debate about the Egyptian chronology. It falls within the early Bronze Age and is variously estimated to have begun anywhere between the 34th and the 30th centuriesBC. In a 2013 study based on radiocarbon dates, the accession of Hor-Aha, the second king of the First Dynasty, was placed between 3111 and 3045 BC with 68% confidence, and between 3218 and 3035 with 95% confidence. The same study placed the accession of Den, the sixth king of the dynasty, between 2928 and 2911 BC with 68% confidence, although a 2023 radiocarbon analysis placed Den&#x27;s accession potentially earlier, between 3011 and 2921, within a broader window of 3104 to 2913.

==The dynasty==

Information about this dynasty is derived from a few monuments and other objects bearing royal names, the most important being the Narmer Palette and Narmer Macehead, as well as Den and Qa&#x27;a king lists. No detailed records of the first two dynasties have survived, except for the terse lists on the Palermo Stone. The account in Manetho&#x27;s &quot;Aegyptiaca&quot; contradicts both the archeological evidence and the other historical records: Manetho names nine rulers of the First Dynasty, only one of whose names matches the other sources, and offers information for only four of them. Egyptian hieroglyphs were fully developed by then, and their shapes would be used with little change for more than three thousand years.

Alena Buis noted: 

A study on First Dynasty crania from the royal tombs in Abydos generally demonstrated greater affinity with Kerma Kushites, and Upper Nile Valley groups. Moreover, the analysis too found clear change from earlier craniometric trends, as &quot;lower Egyptian, Maghrebian, and European patterns are observed also, thus making for great diversity&quot;. The gene flow and movement of northern officials to the important southern city may explain the findings. 

==Human sacrifice==

Human sacrifice was practiced as part of the funerary rituals associated with all of the pharaohs of the first dynasty. It is clearly demonstrated as existing during this dynasty by retainers being buried near each pharaoh&#x27;s tomb as well as animals sacrificed for the burial. The tomb of Djer is associated with the burials of 338 individuals. The people and animals sacrificed, such as donkeys, were expected to assist the pharaoh in the afterlife. For unknown reasons, this practice ended with the conclusion of the dynasty.

According to historian and linguist Christopher Ehret, the ritual practice of retainer sacrifice originated from the southern region in the Middle Nile. Ehret also stated that this cultural practice was shared with the Kerma kingdom of the Upper Nubian Nile region.

<text>Kōkei (also Kogei; 皇慶: 977?–1049), the author of the &quot;Enoshima Engi&quot;, was an eminent Japanese Buddhist monk. He is said to have commenced his career as a monk at the age of seven, when he climbed Mt. Hiei to Enryakuji Monastery, one of the centers of Japanese Buddhism.

Kōkei is credited with the building of the Enryuji (円隆寺) Temple in Tango (丹後; ancient name for region to the north of Kyoto on the Sea of Japan) during the period 995–998. In the year 1003 AD, he boarded a vessel in an attempt to travel to Song dynasty China to study Buddhism, however, the vessel was unable to depart, and he gave up that ambition. Around 1026, he left Enryakuji and built a thatched hermitage in the Tanba region north of Kyoto at Ikegami (池上). It is said to have been the predecessor of the Ikegami-in (池上院) sub-temple. In reference to this hermitage, he was also known as &quot;Ikegami Ajari&quot; (池上阿闍梨: &quot;The Master-teacher of Ikegami&quot;). He remained at Ikegami until he received a dream sent by the guardian deity of Enryakuji, who commanded him to return to Enryakuji. He died in Enryakuji at the age of seventy-seven (or seventy-three according to other sources).

As the seventh generation disciple in a direct line from Ennin (圓仁), he was a learned monk who played an important role in the rise of the Tendai sect. The &quot;Enoshima Engi&quot;, which he completed two years before his death, presented the goddess Benzaiten both as a protector of the state (in keeping with the Sutra of Golden Light) and as a savior of the people, thus expanding her role. He is also the author of &quot;Zuiyoki&quot; (随要記), a treatise on a consecration ceremony in which water is sprinkled on the head of a disciple by a master, thereby upgrading the disciple&#x27;s status.

He is considered the founder of the Tani school of Taimitsu.

<text>Programmed input–output (also programmable input/output, programmed input/output, programmed I/O, PIO) is a method of data transmission, via input/output (I/O), between a central processing unit (CPU) and a peripheral device, such as a Parallel ATA storage device. Each data item transfer is initiated by an instruction in the program, involving the CPU for every transaction. In contrast, in direct memory access (DMA) operations, the CPU is uninvolved in the data transfer.

The term can refer to either memory-mapped I/O (MMIO) or port-mapped I/O (PMIO). PMIO refers to transfers using a special address space outside of normal memory, usually accessed with dedicated instructions, such as &lt;samp&gt;IN&lt;/samp&gt; and &lt;samp&gt;OUT&lt;/samp&gt; in x86 architectures. MMIO refers to transfers to I/O devices that are mapped into the normal address space available to the program. PMIO was very useful for early microprocessors with small address spaces, since the valuable resource was not consumed by the I/O devices.

The best known example of a PC device that uses programmed I/O is the Parallel AT Attachment (PATA) interface; however, the AT Attachment interface can also be operated in any of several DMA modes. Many older devices in a PC also use PIO, including legacy serial ports, legacy parallel ports when not in ECP mode, keyboard and mouse PS/2 ports, legacy MIDI and joystick ports, the interval timer, and older network interfaces.

== PIO mode in the ATA interface ==
The PIO interface is grouped into different modes that correspond to different transfer rates. The electrical signaling among the different modes is similar — only the cycle time between transactions is reduced in order to achieve a higher transfer rate. All ATA devices support the slowest mode — Mode 0. By accessing the information registers (using Mode 0) on an ATA drive, the CPU is able to determine the maximum transfer rate for the device and configure the ATA controller for optimal performance.

The PIO modes require a great deal of CPU overhead to configure a data transaction and transfer the data. Because of this inefficiency, the DMA (and eventually Ultra Direct Memory Access (UDMA)) interface was created to increase performance. The simple digital logic needed to implement a PIO transfer still makes this transfer method useful today, especially if high transfer rates are unneeded as in embedded systems, or with field-programmable gate array (FPGA) chips, where PIO mode can be used with no significant performance loss.

Two additional advanced timing modes have been defined in the CompactFlash specification 2.0. Those are PIO modes 5 and 6. They are specific to CompactFlash.

=== PIO Mode 5 ===
A PIO Mode 5 was proposed with operation at 22 MB/s, but was never implemented on hard disks because CPUs of the time would have been crippled waiting for the hard disk at the proposed PIO 5 timings, and the DMA standard ultimately obviated it. While no hard disk drive was ever manufactured to support this mode, some motherboard manufacturers preemptively provided BIOS support for it. PIO Mode 5 can be used with CompactFlash cards connected to ATA via CF-to-ATA adapters.

<doc id="320092" wikidata="Q5506417" url="?curid=320092" title="Fruit tree pollination">
<text>Pollination of fruit trees is required to produce seeds with surrounding fruit. It is the process of moving pollen from the anther to the stigma, either in the same flower or in another flower. Some tree species, including many fruit trees, do not produce fruit from self-pollination, so pollinizer trees are planted in orchards.

The pollination process requires a carrier for the pollen, which can be animal, wind, or human intervention (by hand-pollination or by using a pollen sprayer). Cross pollination produces seeds with a different genetic makeup from the parent plants; such seeds may be created deliberately as part of a selective breeding program for fruit trees with desired attributes. Trees that are cross-pollinated or pollinated via an insect pollinator produce more fruit than trees with flowers that just self-pollinate. In fruit trees, bees are an essential part of the pollination process for the formation of fruit.

Pollination of fruit trees around the world has been highly studied for hundreds of years. Much is known about fruit tree pollination in temperate climates, but much less is known about fruit tree pollination in tropical climates. Fruits from temperate climates include apples, pears, plums, peaches, cherries, berries, grapes, and nuts which are considered dry fruits. Fruits from tropical climates include bananas, pineapples, papayas, passion fruit, avocado, mango, and members of the genus &quot;Citrus&quot;.

==Temperate fruits==

===Apples===

Most apple plants/trees are self-incompatible, that is, they do not produce fruit when pollinated from a flower of the same tree or from another tree of the same cultivar, and must be cross pollinated. A few are described as &quot;self-fertile&quot; and are capable of self-pollination, although even those tend to carry larger crops when cross pollinated from a suitable pollenizer. A relatively small number of cultivars are &quot;triploid&quot;, meaning that they provide almost no viable pollen for themselves or other apple trees. Apples that can pollinate one another are grouped by the time they flower so cross-pollinators are in bloom at the same time. Pollination management is an important component of apple culture. Before planting, it is important to arrange for pollenizers – varieties of apple or crabapple that provide plentiful, viable and compatible pollen. Orchard blocks may alternate rows of compatible varieties, or may plant crabapple trees, or graft on limbs of crabapple. Some varieties produce very little pollen, or the pollen is sterile, so these are not good pollenizers. Good-quality nurseries have pollenizer compatibility lists. Growers with old orchard blocks of single varieties sometimes provide bouquets of crabapple blossoms in drums or pails in the orchard for pollenizers. Home growers with a single tree and no other variety in the neighborhood can do the same on a smaller scale.

During the bloom each season, commercial apple growers usually provide pollinators to carry the pollen. Honeybee hives are most commonly used in the United States, and arrangements may be made with a commercial beekeeper who supply hives for a fee. Honeybees of the genus &quot;Apis&quot; are the most common pollinator for apple trees, although members of the genera &quot;Andrena&quot;, &quot;Bombus&quot;, &quot;Halictus&quot;, and &quot;Osmia&quot; pollinate apple trees in the wild. Solitary bees or wild bees such as ground-nesting mining bees (&quot;Andrena&quot;) may play a far bigger role in pollination than at one time suspected, and are alternative pollinators in orchards. Bumble bees are sometimes present in orchards, but not usually in enough quantity to be significant pollinators; in the home garden with only a few trees, their role may be much greater. Apple growers also rely on several species of wild bees for pollination in their orchard.

Increasingly Orchard bees (spring mason bees, genus &quot;Osmia&quot;) are being used in fruit tree pollination. According to British writer Christopher O&#x27;Toole in his book &quot;The Red Mason Bee&quot;, &quot;Osmia rufa&quot; is a much more efficient pollinator of orchard crops (in Europe) than honey bees. Both &quot;O. rufa&quot; and &quot;O. cornuta&quot; are used in Europe, while in western North America, the &quot;Blue Orchard Bee&quot; (&quot;Osmia lignaria&quot;, more black than blue in color) is a proven orchard pollinator. In Japan, the Japanese Orchard Bee—the hornfaced bee, &quot;Osmia cornifrons&quot;—provides up to 80% of the apple pollination.
Beyond Japan, &quot;Osmia cornifrons&quot; is also used increasingly in the eastern US, because like other mason bees it is up to 100 times more efficient than the honeybee—a mere 600 hornfaced bees being required per hectare, as opposed to tens of thousands of honeybees. Home growers may find these more acceptable in suburban locations because they rarely sting.

Symptoms of inadequate pollination are small and misshapen apples, and slowness to ripen. The seeds can be counted to evaluate pollination. Well-pollinated apples have best quality, and will have seven to ten seeds. Apples with fewer than three seeds will usually not mature and will drop from the trees in the early summer. Inadequate pollination can result from either a lack of pollinators or pollenizers, or from poor pollinating weather at bloom time. Multiple bee visits are usually required to deliver sufficient grains of pollen to accomplish complete pollination.

===Pears===

Like apples, pears are self-incompatible and need to attract insects in order to be pollinated and produce fruit. One notable difference from apples is that pear blossoms are much less attractive to honeybees due to their pale coloring and light odor. Bees may abandon the pear blossoms to visit dandelions or a nearby apple orchard. The majority of pollinators of pear trees are honey bees, although pears are also visited by blow flies and hoverflies. In some areas, such as the Emilia-Romagna area of Italy, honeybees could not be used to pollinate pears due to the spread of fireblight in the 1990s, and &quot;Osmia cornuta&quot; were used as pollinators instead. A way to combat the low attraction of honey bees to pear blossoms is to use bee attractants to entice the bees to pollinate the flowers.Bee attractants may include pheromones that mimic the brood pheromone or the juvenile pheromone, or other attractants. There are also other methods for attracting honey bees to pear blossoms. One is saturation pollination, that is to stock so many bees that all area blossoms are worked regardless of the attractiveness to the bees. Another method is to delay the movement of the beehives into the orchards until there is about 30 percent bloom. The bees are moved into the orchard during the night and will usually visit the pear blossoms for a few hours until they discover the richer nectar sources. The recommended number of hives per acre is one.

===Plums and prunes===

Most Asian plums require a second variety for cross-pollination, whereas most European plums are self-fertile. European plums that dry well are also called prunes, the common name for the dry fruit. Several of the Asian plums bloom early and pollinator management is similar to apricots. However the fruiting wood especially of Asian plums can be brittle and over-pollination requires aggressive thinning of fruits.

===Apricots===

Apricots are botanically similar to almonds and like almonds they can bloom early, making pollinator management similar except that a tree can overcrop if the fruit is not thinned.

===Peaches and Nectarines===

Most peaches and nectarines are self fertile and thus require fewer pollinators than apples and pears. 

===Cherries===
Pie cherries, also called sour cherries, are self-fertile. In some varieties, fruit yield could increased by utilizing pollinators. Most sweet cherries need a second variety for pollination, and even self-fertile varies have improved fruit-set with a second variety. Pie cherries can pollinate sweet cherries. Cherries do not need thinning.

===Figs===

Some figs produce fruit without pollination. Figs that are pollinated rely on fig wasps.

==Temperate nuts==

===Almonds===

The blossoms of most California [Almond] varieties are self-incompatible, requiring cross-pollination with other varieties to produce a crop. The single most important factor determining a good yield is pollination during the bloom period. More than a million colonies of honey bees are placed in California Almond orchards at the beginning of the bloom period to pollinate the crop. California beekeepers alone cannot supply this critical need, which is why honey bees travel across the country to the San Joaqin Valley each year. Although the recommended number of hives per acre is 2 to 3, due to the high demand in conjunction with the reduced availability of commercial beehives, many almond growers have to make do with a lower hive density during pollination. These growers started using semiochemical formulations, like SPLAT Bloom, to compensate for the low hive density. SPLAT Bloom manipulates the behavior of the bees, inciting them to spend more time foraging, and thus pollinating flowers in the entire almond orchard (increasing pollination and fruit set), not only close to the hive.

Research into self-fertile almonds has led to the development of several almond varieties that do not need a pollinator tree. Working from an old Spanish variety, &quot;Tuono&quot;, researchers in 2008 started making available new self-fertile varieties that more closely match the qualities of the popular &quot;Nonpareil&quot; almond—including varieties &quot;Lone Star&quot; and &quot;Independence&quot;. While self-fertile trees do not require pollen from a second tree variety for fruit / nut set, they still depend upon insect pollination for good production. Almond growers with self-fertile almonds report excellent nut set with half (or less) the number of bees in the field.

===Wind-pollinated nuts===

Hazelnuts (filberts), walnuts, pecans, and chestnuts are all wind-pollinated temperate-zone nuts. Mostly these wind-pollinated nuts are selected varieties that need two different varieties (and favorable winds) for cross-pollination. Insects and birds may visit and consume the pollen, but are not a factor in pollination.

Edible seeds from wind-pollinated coniferous trees such as pine, ginkgo, and monkey-puzzle trees are also harvested and the seeds are colloquially called nuts.

==Tropical fruits and nuts==

===Citrus===

Many citrus cultivars are seedless and are produced parthenocarpically without pollination. Some cultivars may be capable of producing fruit either way, having seeds in the segments, if pollinated, and no seeds if not. Citrus that requires pollination may be self-compatible, thus pollen must be moved only a short distance from the anther to the stigma by a pollinator. Some citrus, such as Meyer Lemons, are popular container plants. When these bloom indoors, they often suffer from blossom drop because no pollinators have access. Hand pollination by a human pollinator is a solution.

A few citrus, including some tangelos and tangerines, are self-incompatible, and require cross pollination. Pollinizers must be planned when groves are planted. Managed honeybee hives at bloom time are often used to ensure adequate pollination.

===Papayas===
Most varieties of papaya are dioecious, having both male and female flowers on separate plants. Plants of each type must be present for these to produce fruit.  Some papaya plants are capable of self-pollination, producing flowers that are either female or hermaphrodite with both male and female parts on the same flower.  Hawaiian and Brazilian papayas and nearly half of those produced in Australia are able to set fruit without the need of staminate plants. A fully developed fruit may contain 1,000 seeds so well over 1,000 grains of pollen must be received by a receptive stigma. An exact list of actors involved in natural papaya pollination does not exist. Large insects play an important role in most regions with hawkmoths, sphinx moths and possibly hummingbirds as primary pollinators. Honey bees are attracted to nectar and pollen from the staminate and hermaphrodite papaya flowers, but narrow tubes and deep flowers may limit the effectiveness of bees as primary pollinators. Even so, pollen requirements for healthy and consistent fruit motivate growers to locate honeybees within their groves to pollinate in any capacity.  Early researchers believed wind and gravity played significant roles pollinating this tropical fruit but modern studies fail to confirm either one. 

===Passion fruit===
Most edible passion fruit varieties are self fertile. Since each flower is only open for 1–2 days and may not get the chance to be pollinated by insects, fruit set can improved by hand pollinating.

===Avocados===
Most avocados are pollinated using bees. There is often not enough local pollinators in order to pollinate the large amount of avocado trees found in orchards, so beehives must be transported from elsewhere. Some people consider migratory beekeeping to be exploitative towards bees.

===Mangoes===
Mangoes are usually self pollinating and also grown by grafting

<doc id="320098" wikidata="Q5154716" url="?curid=320098" title="Community Development Block Grant">
<text>The Community Development Block Grant (CDBG), one of the longest-running programs of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, funds local community development activities with the stated goal of providing affordable housing, anti-poverty programs, and infrastructure development. CDBG, like other block grant programs, differs from categorical grants, made for specific purposes, in that they are subject to less federal oversight and are largely used at the discretion of the state and local governments and their subgrantees.

==History==
The CDBG program was enacted in 1974 by President Gerald Ford through the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 and took effect in January 1975. Most directly, the law was a response to the Nixon administration&#x27;s 1973 funding moratorium on many Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) programs. 

President Ford emphasized the bill&#x27;s potential for reducing inefficient bureaucracy, as the grant replaced seven previous programs that were &quot;too fragmented to provide comprehensive solutions to complex local needs&quot;. He also noted its potential for improving government effectiveness by &quot;replacing Federal judgments on local development with the judgments of the people who live and work there&quot;: placing more decision-making power on local funding choices in the hands of local governments who &quot;are most familiar with local needs&quot;. The CDBG was presented as explicitly meant to &quot;redistribute influence from the federal bureaucracies to local governments&quot; - in Ford&#x27;s words, to &quot;return power from the banks of the Potomac to people in their own communities&quot;.

It had bipartisan support, reportedly because liberal legislators shared its goal of extinguishing poverty and &quot;urban blight&quot; and conservative legislators appreciated the control the program placed in the hands of private investors and the reduction it made in the role of the United States government. Decentralizing control over community development appealed to some Democrats because the central administration of previous programs meant benefits often did not reach the targeted low-income communities, while Republicans appreciated that the program was represented as meant to &quot;limit the powers of the federal bureaucracy&quot;, a political and ideological presentation reflective of &quot;growing public resentment of big government and big bureaucracy&quot;.

The law ultimately passed both houses with large bipartisan majorities.
Later Congressional changes created additional small CDBG set-asides that fund programs in minority-serving universities (Section 107), in US territories such as Guam, and for large-scale rehabilitation loans (Section 108).

==Allocation of funds==
CDBG funds are allocated on a formula basis.

Upon reauthorizing CDBG in 1978, Congress instituted a dual formula to strengthen controls on how money was spent and to better serve communities with different types of problems. A city&#x27;s proportion of the overall CDBG allocation is either the average of the area&#x27;s fractions of the US&#x27;s total population, total poverty and total amount of housing overcrowding, or the average of the area&#x27;s fractions of the country&#x27;s total growth lag, total poverty, and total age of housing. Formula A typically benefits rapidly growing cities with high poverty that lack affordable housing. Formula B tends to benefit cities with large shares of old housing and low growth, including many affluent suburbs.

HUD calculates both formulas for all entitlement grantees and awards the larger amount, but Congressional appropriation has ultimate determination on program funding. These formulas have become less well matched to community need over time, and improvements or revisions have been proposed by several analytical reports.

More than 1,100 local and state governments, called &quot;entitlement communities&quot;, automatically qualify for the grant. Cities qualify if they have populations of at least 50,000 or are the principal city of a Metropolitan Area, as determined by the Office of Management and Budget. Counties qualify if they have populations of at least 200,000, excluding any entitlement cities, and are in a metropolitan area. They are required to submit allocation reports (showing to whom and where the money was spent) and quarterly reports to the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. First, &quot;not less than 70 percent of CDBG funds must be used for activities that benefit low- and moderate-income persons&quot;. Secondly, funds must be spent on eligible activities, which are broadly defined as including &quot;community development activities directed toward neighborhood revitalization, economic development, and improved community facilities and services&quot;. Such activities may include &quot;Acquisition of real property, Relocation and demolition, Rehabilitation of residential and non-residential structures, Construction of public facilities and improvements&quot;, and more. Third, governments must follow a plan of project selection that includes citizen participation, especially by citizens who live in &quot;areas in which the grantee proposes to use CDBG funds&quot;.

There are a number of other distribution methods of CDBG funds besides entitlement communities. The 1978 re-authorization also required HUD to award 30% of all CDBG funds to states for grants to municipalities and counties that are not entitlement communities. This is often called the &quot;Small Cities&quot; program, because it includes many small cities and rural counties. Other programs include the CDBG Insular Area Program (for American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands), the CDBG Program Colonias Set-Aside, and the Neighborhood Stabilization Program.

Nominal levels of CDBG funding have remained fairly constant over time, but they have dramatically declined over the course of the program&#x27;s existence in inflation-adjusted terms, as can be seen in the figure to the right.

==Administration==
Proposed CDBG projects must be consistent with broad national priorities for CDBG: activities that benefit low- and moderate-income people, the prevention or elimination of slums or blight, or other community development activities to address an urgent threat to health or safety. CDBG funds may be used for community development activities (such as real estate acquisition, relocation, demolition, rehabilitation of housing and commercial buildings), construction of public facilities and improvements (such as water, sewer, and other utilities, street paving, and sidewalks), construction and maintenance of neighborhood centers, and the conversion of school buildings, public services, and economic development and job creation/retention activities. CDBG funds can also be used for preservation and restoration of historic properties in low-income neighborhoods.

From the federal level, the Department of Housing and Urban Development has set three goals for Community Planning and Development (CPD) Programs – &quot;To ensure decent housing; To create and maintain a suitable living environment; and To expand economic opportunities&quot;, that are taken directly from the Housing and Community Development Act. On the local level, however, each city is allowed to select their own objectives and priorities underneath each of those goals that they believe will best meet the needs of their community.

Local governments receiving CDBG funds must submit two annual performance and evaluation reports. First, an Annual Action Plan for the upcoming fiscal year that also serves as an application for funds is due to HUD in mid-May. This plan includes the area&#x27;s expected funding resources and stated community development goals and provides information about planned projects including their geographic distribution and the activity categories and development objectives they fall under. The creation of the Action Plans includes community outreach, public meetings, and the solicitation of Requests for Proposals from city government departments and local nonprofits of activities that could be funded. Additionally, every five years the Annual Action Plan is submitted alongside a Consolidated Plan that outlines the area&#x27;s long-term community development needs, priorities, and strategic plan. Second, a Consolidated Annual Performance Evaluation Report (CAPER) covering the previous fiscal year is submitted to HUD at the end of September to ensure the cities are meeting objectives. The CAPER includes &quot;a description of the progress made in accomplishing the objectives&quot; of the CDBG, and &quot;a summary of the use of such funds during the preceding fiscal year&quot;.

Nationally, CDBG funds were spent for the following purposes in 2011:
* Public infrastructure (32.7%)
* Housing (24.8%)
* Administrative and planning (15.1%)
* Public services (11.4%)
* Economic development (7.3%)
* Property acquisition (4.9%)
* Other (3.8%)

In Fiscal Year 2017, the largest categories of CDBG spending were:
* Public infrastructure (36.0%)
* Housing (24.7%)
* Administrative and planning (14.2%)
* Public services (10.5%)
* Economic development (6.3%)
* Acquisition (4.9%)
* Other (4.0%)

==Relations with other programs==
The CDBG shares some features of the Urban Development Action Grants (UDAG). UDAG, along with urban renewal and other previous federal attempts to alleviate poverty and blight in US cities, was criticized as being a &quot;top-down&quot; approach. For these programs, federal planners would dictate how and where funds were spent. In contrast, CDBG was constructed to be a &quot;bottom-up&quot; approach.

In order to receive CDBG funds, applicants must identify urgent needs of the community, and solicit project ideas and plans from citizens and local organizations that address those needs. Thus, the CDBG program represents a significant shift in how the federal government addresses poverty and blight. 

Some researchers argue that because CDBG is a bottom-up program it is significantly more successful than previous programs. Others have said CDBG&#x27;s scope of allowed activities is too broad, making it difficult to measure program performance.

<doc id="320100" wikidata="Q15527274" url="?curid=320100" title="John Bindon">
<text>John Dennis Arthur Bindon (4 October 1943 – 10 October 1993) was an English actor and bodyguard who had close links with the London underworld. 

The son of a London cab driver, Bindon was frequently in trouble as a youth for getting into fights, and spent two periods in borstal. He was spotted in a London pub by Ken Loach, who asked him to appear in his film &quot;Poor Cow&quot; (1967). Other film and television productions followed, with Bindon sought after to play gangsters or tough police detectives. He played a violent mobster alongside Mick Jagger in &quot;Performance&quot; (1970), a London crime boss in &quot;Get Carter&quot; (1971), and a prisoner with Paul Newman in &quot;The Mackintosh Man&quot; (1973). Philip Hoare described Bindon as &quot;the archetypal actor-villain, and an all-round &#x27;good geezer.

Bindon was also known for having many socialite girlfriends, such as Christine Keeler, the former &quot;Playboy&quot; &quot;Bunny Girl&quot; Serena Williams, and Vicki Hodge, who had a 12-year abusive relationship with Bindon, which ended in 1981. Through Hodge, the daughter of a baronet, Bindon gained access to British aristocratic circles, which culminated with his meeting Princess Margaret in the late 1960s, at her home on Mustique in the Caribbean.

Bindon lived his hard man persona on and off screen. He was believed to be running protection rackets in west London pubs and was alleged to have connections to the Kray twins and the Richardson Gang. In the late 1970s, in addition to acting work, he provided security for actors and musicians, most notoriously for Led Zeppelin on their 1977 US tour, where he was dismissed for brawling backstage. 

In 1978, Bindon was tried for the murder of London gangster Johnny Darke. Bindon pleaded self-defence and was acquitted, but the case damaged his reputation, and that, coupled with being seen by directors as difficult to work with, meant his acting career declined. In the 1980s, Bindon became reclusive; he died in 1993.

==Early life==

John Bindon was born in Fulham, London, and was the son of Dennis Bindon, a merchant seaman and engineer turned cab driver. The second eldest in a working-class family of three children, Bindon attended Henry Compton School in Fulham, but left at the age of 15. He was given the nickname &quot;Biffo&quot; for starting or getting into fights.

As a teenager, he served time in a borstal for possessing live ammunition. After jobs ranging from laying asphalt to dealing in antiques (his best friend for several years was the antiques dealer John Hobbs), Bindon pursued a career in acting.

==Acting and associations==
Director Ken Loach, spotting him in a London pub in 1966, considered him perfect for the role of a rough husband in the film, &quot;Poor Cow&quot; (1967). His next big break came the following year with a role in &quot;Performance&quot; (not released until 1970) alongside Mick Jagger, where he played a violent mobster. His portrayal earned him critical praise and typecast him for future roles. Bindon was awarded the Queen&#x27;s Award for Bravery, a police bravery medal, for diving off Putney Bridge into the River Thames to rescue a drowning man, in 1968, although some said he had pushed the man in and only rescued him when a policeman appeared.

In 1968, he met Vicki Hodge, a baronet&#x27;s daughter turned model and actress, who introduced him to British aristocracy. However, he had been previously invited to the Caribbean island resort of Mustique, where Bindon claimed to have had sex with Princess Margaret. A biographer of the Princess, Noel Botham, firmly believed Bindon had an affair with her. Returning to Mustique for a second time in 1969, he took girlfriend Hodge with him. The princess later denied meeting Bindon, despite pictures of them next to one another. During this time Bindon gained the nickname &quot;Big John&quot;, due to the reported size of his penis. Apparently demonstrated on multiple occasions over decades, when inebriated, Bindon was able to hang five half-pint beer glasses from his manhood.

Bindon&#x27;s name was also linked with a succession of models, including Christine Keeler, the former &quot;Playboy&quot; &quot;Bunny Girl&quot; Serena Williams, and also Angela Barnett, then girlfriend and future wife of pop star David Bowie.

Bindon had a violent temper and a naturally intimidating personality. He was accused of running a protection racket in west London, targeting pubs, restaurants and cafés. There were also suggestions of connections to the Richardson Gang and the Kray twins, who supported his control of west London, as well as rivalries with gangs from south London. The south London rivalries were suggested to have contributed to his bankruptcy, when he accrued drug debts. The extent of his involvement in the English underworld has not been reliably established.

Bindon&#x27;s best known film roles were his appearance in &quot;Get Carter&quot; (1971) and the Who&#x27;s film &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; (1979) as a drug dealer. He also appeared in television series such as &quot;Public Eye&quot;, &quot;The Gold Robbers&quot;, &quot;Department S&quot;, &quot;Dixon of Dock Green&quot;, &quot;Z-Cars&quot;, &quot;Paul Temple&quot;, &quot;Special Branch&quot;, &quot;Softly, Softly: Taskforce&quot; and &quot;Hazell&quot; playing out his usual tough-guy roles. Despite a productive film and television career, Bindon felt he needed a break from acting, and went into organising security. It was to be a move which would have disastrous personal and financial consequences.

==Oakland incident==

In early 1977, Bindon was hired by Peter Grant on advice from tour manager Richard Cole as security coordinator for the rock group Led Zeppelin during their concert tour of the United States. He had previously provided security for actors Ryan and Tatum O&#x27;Neal (he had appeared in &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot; in a scene with Ryan). An incident involving Bindon occurred at the band&#x27;s concert at the Oakland Coliseum on 23 July 1977, near the end of their US tour. Upon arrival at the stadium, it is alleged that Bindon pushed a member of promoter Bill Graham&#x27;s stage crew out of the way as the band entered via a backstage ramp. As a result, tension had been simmering between Graham&#x27;s staff and Led Zeppelin&#x27;s security team during the day, and as Grant and Bindon were walking down the ramp near the end of the concert, words were exchanged with stage crew chief Jim Downey, which resulted in Bindon knocking Downey unconscious. Bindon maintained that he was goaded into the fight after Graham&#x27;s crew referred to him as &quot;a weak limey fuck&quot;.

Just minutes later a separate off-stage incident occurred. Bill Graham&#x27;s security man Jim Matzorkis was accused of slapping Peter Grant&#x27;s 11-year-old son Warren for taking a dressing room sign, and was savagely beaten up. Led Zeppelin&#x27;s second Oakland show took place only after Bill Graham signed a letter of indemnification, absolving Led Zeppelin from responsibility for the previous night&#x27;s incident. However, Graham refused to honour the letter and assault charges were laid against Grant, Cole, Bindon and John Bonham when the band arrived back at their hotel. The four received bail and later pleaded no contest, receiving suspended sentences. Bindon was dismissed by the band and returned to England. Grant later said that allowing Bindon to be hired was the biggest mistake he made as manager.

==Darke murder trial==

In 1978, Bindon became involved in a fight with John Darke, a London gangster, outside the Ranelagh Yacht Club, in Fulham, London. Darke was stabbed nine times, resulting in his death, and Bindon managed to flee to Dublin with his own knife wounds covered up. He gave himself up to police and was subsequently tried at the Old Bailey in October 1979. The prosecution claimed that this was a £10,000 contract killing over drugs, with the fight as a cover for the death. However, the defence argued that Darke&#x27;s death was in self-defence, saying Bindon was in fear of his life as he was being blackmailed about losing drug money and cocaine worth thousands of pounds. 

Bindon was acquitted of Darke&#x27;s murder in November 1979. It was reported that the &quot;substantial appearance&quot; of actor Bob Hoskins as a character witness at the trial helped sway the jury&#x27;s verdict and that the judge, Sir William Mars-Jones, &quot;had been sympathetic towards Bindon in his summing-up and unhappy with the ragbag of witnesses produced by the prosecution&quot;.

Media reports of the trial, along with the Oakland incident, seriously damaged Bindon&#x27;s reputation and he found it increasingly difficult to find work in the entertainment industry.

==Later years and death==

During the 1980s, Bindon became a reclusive figure, spending more of his time at his Belgravia flat. He died on 10 October 1993, aged 50. According to Philip Hoare&#x27;s obituary in &quot;The Independent&quot;, he died from cancer.

==References in popular culture==

In 2002, a Carlton Television documentary of Bindon&#x27;s life entitled &quot;Real Crime: Starring John Bindon&quot; was screened in the UK on ITV. It featured archival footage of Bindon behind the scenes and interviews with Angie Bowie, Vicki Hodge, Billy Murray, George Sewell and James Whitaker. Bindon also featured in the Carlton documentary for ITV, &quot;The Secret Life of Princess Margaret&quot;, broadcast in 2005. Bindon&#x27;s relationship with Princess Margaret was the subject of Channel 4&#x27;s documentary &quot;The Princess and the Gangster&quot;, which was broadcast on 9 February 2009.

In 2010, Bindon was the subject of &quot;Ten Men: The Lives of John Bindon&quot;, a one-man verse play written and directed by Franklyn McCabe, with Matthew Houghton playing Bindon. The play was performed at the Open House pub theatre as part of the Brighton Fringe Festival in 2010.

Bindon appeared as a character played by the actor Jason Merrells in the stage play &quot;A Princess Undone&quot; which opened at the Cambridge Arts Theatre in October 2016.

<doc id="320102" wikidata="Q1858597" url="?curid=320102" title="Pallas (band)">
<text>Pallas are a Scottish progressive rock band from Aberdeen. They were one of the bands at the vanguard of what was termed neo-prog during progressive rock&#x27;s second-wave revival in the early 1980s. Other major UK acts included Marillion, IQ, Twelfth Night, Pendragon and Solstice.

==History ==
Formed in 1974 as &#x27;Rainbow&#x27;, they dropped the name after Ritchie Blackmore left Deep Purple and called his new band Rainbow. Pallas began hitting the club circuit at the beginning of a grassroots revival of full-blown progressive rock, which, at the time, was extremely unfashionable due to the overwhelming influence of pop and new wave. Ignoring prevailing trends, the band even directly imitated older progressive rock bands, with vocalist Brian Wood mimicking the voice and hairstyle of Peter Gabriel, keyboardist Mike Stobbie donning a Rick Wakeman-style cape, and drummer Derek Forman constructing a helmet for himself out of sheet metal. The band temporarily changed their name to Pallas Athene during this time. However, their debut EP (featuring tracks such as &quot;Reds Under the Beds&quot;) saw them attempting to fit in with the ongoing punk rock movement by emphasising harder rock and deliberately avoiding signature progressive rock elements such as Mellotron and twelve-string guitar.

An upheaval in the band&#x27;s ranks during 1979 saw most of the original members leave, with only Forman and bassist Graeme Murray remaining alongside the new recruits. Murray contacted Marillion vocalist Fish through an advertisement in &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, establishing a relationship between the two progressive rock bands that led to a nationwide tour of small venues which enabled Pallas to establish a following in England, where they were previously unknown (and similarly enabled Marillion to break in to the Scotland market). They secured a successful headlining run at London&#x27;s Marquee Club (a hotbed for the neo-prog revival). A highlight of their set at that time and also a highlight of the early Marquee shows (until the Marquee threatened to ban the band if they did not stop playing it) was a track called &quot;The Ripper&quot;, a fifteen-minute epic about child abuse, insanity, rape and murder. The climax of &quot;The Ripper&quot; featured new lead singer Euan Lowson dressed half as an old man, half as a woman, acting out a rape on stage (the Yorkshire Ripper case was still, at the time, a fresh news item).

The Marillion association and Pallas&#x27;s relentless gigging (which included a spot on the bill at the 1983 Reading Music Festival) made Pallas a hot property. After releasing a self-produced LP entitled &quot;Arrive Alive&quot; (recorded in Scotland in 1981), Pallas was courted by EMI Records (who had just signed Marillion) and went into the recording studio with Yes/Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer engineer Eddy Offord to record &quot;The Sentinel&quot;. The plan was that &quot;The Sentinel&quot; would be a recorded version of &quot;The Atlantis Suite&quot;, an epic centrepiece of the band&#x27;s live performances at the time based around a futuristic version of the story of Atlantis, with plenty of references to the Cold War.

In order to increase the commercial potential of the group&#x27;s major label debut the running order was changed, adding more commercial songs and removing much of the &quot;Atlantis Suite&quot; material. The excised &quot;Atlantis Suite&quot; tracks were issued as B-sides on singles at the time of the album&#x27;s release, and in 2004 a remastered version of the album was released with the &quot;Atlantis Suite&quot; intact as the band intended it.

Some elaborately staged shows in the UK (using &quot;The Sentinel&quot; concept as the theme, and featuring props by the special effects team from &quot;Doctor Who&quot;) failed to generate the needed interest, and by the time the band was ready to record their second album for EMI, Lowson decided to leave the band. In the wake of Lowson&#x27;s departure the band recorded the &quot;Knightmoves&quot; EP with new singer Alan Reed, former vocalist and frontman with Abel Ganz (cf. Abel Gance). The centre-piece of the EP was the epic &quot;Sanctuary&quot;, and early editions of the EP also included a bonus 7&quot; featuring two tracks recorded as demos.

The band went on to record a second EMI album, &quot;The Wedge&quot;. &quot;The Wedge&quot; was selling well in Europe, but upon returning from a tour Pallas learned that all of their friends and associates at EMI had either left the company or been fired, and that EMI was withdrawing all promotion for the album.

The band fell into a semi-dormant state for a number of years, but CD reissues of the back catalogue, with extra tracks and re-engineered versions of &quot;The Sentinel&quot;, kept interest alive. Pallas persevered on and off for several years, and in 1999 released a comeback album, &quot;Beat the Drum&quot;. This featured a harder sound, returning to the band&#x27;s classic rock roots, but still retained a progressive sound with glimpses of the epic on tracks such as album closer, &quot;Fragments of The Sun&quot;. Interest in the band revived, and the internet became an important component in their career. By now the band was a spare time activity for its members, but they managed regular studio output and occasional short tours of Europe and North America. &quot;The Cross &amp; the Crucible&quot;, a loose concept album exploring the historical tension between religion and science was released in 2001. &quot;The Dreams of Men&quot; was released in 2005, supplemented by Paul Anderson on violin and classical singer Pandy Arthur.

In spite of being largely ignored by major record labels and the mainstream music press, with the support of the German independent record label InsideOut the band continued to record and play regular live dates, particularly in Northern Europe. There were also a number of supplementary releases, such as two from the Radio Clyde River Sessions series, a double live collection, several official bootleg recordings and &quot;Mythopoeia&quot;, an archive CD-ROM of audio and video material from the band&#x27;s history.

With effect from 28 January 2010, lead singer Alan Reed left the band he had fronted for the past 26 years. He has been replaced by Paul Mackie.

On 27 July 2010, the band announced they had signed a record deal for three albums with Music Theories/Mascot Records. The new album, &quot;XXV&quot;, was released 27 January 2011. The band confirmed that the album will be the successor to their 1984 release &quot;The Sentinel&quot;, thematically.

On 24 July 2011, Pallas opened the Prog Stage at the High Voltage Festival in London. Their half-an-hour set largely contained material from &#x27;XXV&#x27;, plus the song &#x27;Eyes in the Night (Arrive Alive)&#x27;. Concert Live recorded the performance.

On 30 November 2013, Pallas played a full gig in Glasgow. The set contained not only known songs from the past albums, but also featured two new ones from the album &quot;Wearewhoweare&quot;, scheduled for release in 2014. At the end of the set, former frontman Euan Lowson appeared on stage for two songs.

In June 2018, Graeme Murray, posting from the band&#x27;s Facebook account, stated: &quot;I think there has been a long enough silence on the PALLAS front. The band I suppose is not DEAD, as we are all still alive, just not necessarily on the same continent, or wavelength. BUT not totally dead. Lets just say &quot;in a state of suspended animation&quot;. the patient may come back to life!!!&quot;

In December 2023 Pallas released new album The Messenger with returning singer Alan Reed replacing Paul Mackie.

*&quot;Atlantean&quot; (2011) – download only single from the band&#x27;s homepage; non-album track. This instrumental track is used as the intro on the 2011 tour, meant as a prelude to the opening track of &quot;XXV&quot;, &quot;Falling Down&quot;.
*&quot;Black Moon&quot; (December 2011) – download only single from the band&#x27;s homepage as a Christmas gift to the fans. This track was recorded in March 2010 shortly after Paul Mackie joined the band. The song was originally recorded by Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer for their 1994 album &quot;Black Moon&quot;. Pallas was asked to contribute to a planned ELP tribute compilation in spring of 2010, but the project folded prior to realisation, due to business issues. So the band shelved the track without initial intention of release.
*&quot;Monster (Big Band Version)&quot; (6 January 2012) – download only single from the band&#x27;s homepage. This was the result of a little experimental excursion on several tracks from the &quot;XXV&quot; album that took place in the fall of 2011.
*&quot;XXV Mega-mix&quot; (15 February 2012) – bonus track on the &quot;Live At Lorelei&quot; CD and also available as a free download from the band&#x27;s homepage. Orchestral re-arrangement of the album track laid out as a medley of &quot;Alien Messiah&quot;, &quot;XXV Part I&quot; and &quot;XXV Part II&quot; with 11+ mins. of playing time. Several British prog / rock magazines featured the track on their magazine&#x27;s freebie CD.

** black and white picture sleeve, Spanish titles on the label and the cover (EMI P-040)

=== EPs ===
*&quot;PALLAS EP&quot; a.k.a. &quot;Sue-I-Cide EP&quot; (1978) – debut recording privately released in February 1978 on the mini label Sue-I-Cide from Aberdeen. Manufactured in a quantity of 1,000 items of which around 700 were sold at gigs. The tracks comprised &quot;Reds under the Beds&quot;, &quot;Wilmot (Dove House)&quot;, &quot;Thought Police&quot; and &quot;C.U.UK&quot; which are all exclusive to this release. Comes in a plain white paper sleeve with a name/logo stamp in one corner.

Unlike the later releases this debut effort features a totally different musical style. Whereas Pallas has been compared with their contemporary competitors Marillion regularly, this EP is more in the verve of early material by The Police.

*&quot;Complimentary Tape 25/04/98&quot; (1998) – given out to fans who wanted to attend Pallas&#x27; gig on 25 April 1998 at the Day of Dreams festival at the Hedon club in Zwolle that was cancelled on short notice, as a compensation for the inconvenience caused. The blank tape contains demo versions of &quot;Beat The Drum&quot; and &quot;Blood And Roses&quot; from the then-to-be-released album, &quot;Beat The Drum&quot;, plus an alternate take of &quot;Refugee&quot; from the never released &quot;Voices In The Dark&quot; album. Due to the circumstances of its existence this tape is – apart from the 1978 &quot;Sui-I-Cide EP&quot; – the most scarce item in Pallas&#x27; discography. The tape was re-issued in 2003 with a different J-card design and called &quot;PALLAS Sampler Tape&quot;. The three tracks saw a broader release through the &quot;Mythopoeia&quot; compilation in 2000.

=== Compilation appearances ===
*&quot;SI Magazine: Compilation Disc&quot; (1991) – CD
** Pallas contributed &quot;War Of Words&quot; from the unreleased &quot;Voices In The Dark&quot; album to this compilation of the Dutch progressive rock magazine &quot;SI&quot;.
*&quot;SI Magazine: Compilation Disc&quot; (1993) – CD
** Pallas contributed &quot;Never Too Late&quot; from the unreleased &quot;Voices In The Dark&quot; album to this compilation of the Dutch progressive rock magazine &quot;SI&quot;.

Both aforementioned tracks saw a re-release on the &quot;Mythopoeia&quot; compilation in 2000.

*&quot;Mannerisms – A Celebration of the Music of Geoff Mann&quot; (1994) – CD
** Pallas contributed &quot;What In The World&quot; to this tribute compilation to the work of the late neo-prog artist Geoff Mann, who died the previous year. Other notable bands on the album include IQ, Galahad, Pendragon, Jadis, Eden Burning, and Mann&#x27;s own band Twelfth Night.
** In addition, Alan Reed, the Pallas vocalist, collaborated with Clive Nolan (Pendragon, Arena) on another track on the compilation, &quot;Love Song&quot;.

<doc id="320104" wikidata="Q1174685" url="?curid=320104" title="David Hackworth">
<text>Colonel David Haskell Hackworth (November 11, 1930 – May 4, 2005) was a United States Army officer and journalist, who was highly decorated in both the Korean War and Vietnam War. Hackworth is known for his role in the formation and command of Tiger Force, a military unit from the 101st Airborne Division that used guerrilla warfare tactics against Viet Cong in South Vietnam.

He was the youngest US colonel in Vietnam at the time of his promotion. He was described by General Creighton Abrams, who commanded all US military operations from 1968 to 1972 in Vietnam, as &quot;the best battalion commander I ever saw in the United States Army.&quot;

==Early life==
Hackworth was born in Ocean Park, California (now part of Santa Monica), on November 11, 1930, the son of Leroy E. Hackworth and Lorette (Kensly) Hackworth. His parents both died before he was a year old, so he and his brother and sister were raised by Ida Stedman, their paternal grandmother.

The family had to rely on government aid during the Great Depression, and his grandmother, who had been married to a Colorado gold miner, brought them up on tales of her Old West experiences and her Revolutionary War ancestors. While attending school in Santa Monica, Hackworth and a friend earned money by shining the shoes of soldiers stationed at bases in the area. 

==Military career==
Imbued with a sense of adventure, at age 14, Hackworth lied about his age and paid a transient to pose as his father so he could claim to be old enough to join the United States Merchant Marine with parental consent.
In 1945 he served aboard a Merchant Marine ship in the South Pacific Ocean during the final months of World War II. After he returned home to California he decided to join the United States Army. In 1946, he used his Merchant Marine documents to enlist for three years. After completing his initial training, he was assigned to post-war occupation duty as a rifleman in the 351st Infantry Regiment, 88th Infantry Division. Based in Trieste, his unit was part of Trieste United States Troops. While serving in Trieste, Hackworth earned his General Educational Development high-school equivalency diploma.

===Korea===
Hackworth fought with the 25th Reconnaissance Company and the 27th Infantry (Wolfhound) Regiment of the 25th Infantry Division during the Korean War. He gained a battlefield commission as a second lieutenant in 1951 and was awarded three Silver Stars for heroism and three Purple Hearts. After a successful raid on Hill 1062 and battlefield promotion to first lieutenant, the commander of the 27th Infantry Regiment offered Hackworth command of a new volunteer raider unit. Hackworth created the 27th Wolfhound Raiders and led them from August to November 1951. He subsequently volunteered for a second tour in Korea, this time with the 40th Infantry Division. Hackworth was promoted to the rank of captain.

===Cold War===

Hackworth was demobilized after the Korean Armistice Agreement in 1954. But he quickly became bored with civilian life, so after two years of college he re-joined the U.S. Army as a captain in 1956.

When Hackworth returned to active duty, the Cold War substantially changed the structure of the army from what he had known. Initially posted to 77th Antiaircraft Artillery Battalion in Manhattan Beach, California, Hackworth was eventually assigned to Germany, initially in staff roles, but returning to infantry in the early 1960s as a company commander under Colonel Glover S. Johns. He was involved in a number of fire drills around the Berlin Crisis of 1961. He recounted his experiences with the Soviet guard and his views on military history in his book &quot;About Face&quot;.

After completing an associate of arts degree at Los Angeles Harbor College, and completing additional courses at several other colleges, in 1964, Hackworth graduated from Austin Peay State University with a Bachelor of Science degree in history, after which he attended the Command and General Staff College.

===Vietnam ===
When President John F. Kennedy announced that a large advisory team was being sent to South Vietnam, Hackworth immediately volunteered for service. His request was denied, on the grounds that he had too much frontline experience, and that others who had seen less fighting (or none) should have an opportunity to acquire experience in combat.

In 1965, he deployed to Vietnam at the rank of Major, serving as an operations officer and battalion commander in the 101st Airborne Division. In November 1965, Hackworth founded a platoon-sized unit designated as Tiger Force to &quot;out guerrilla the guerrillas&quot;. The unit carried out long-range reconnaissance patrol duties, suffering heavy casualties; it was eventually awarded the Presidential Unit Citation. However, after Hackworth was promoted out of Vietnam, the unit committed a series of war crimes, with U.S. Army investigative records estimating that Tiger Force soldiers killed hundreds of noncombatants. Hackworth later stated in an interview with the &quot;Toledo Blade&quot; that he was unaware of the war crimes the unit carried out and refused to speculate on why they occurred.

Hackworth quickly developed a reputation as an eccentric but effective soldier, becoming a public figure in several books authored by General S. L. A. &quot;Slam&quot; Marshall. Following a stateside tour at the Pentagon and promotion to lieutenant colonel, Hackworth co-wrote &quot;The Vietnam Primer&quot; with Marshall after returning to Vietnam in the winter of 1966–67 on an Army-sponsored tour with the famous historian and commentator. The book advised counter-insurgency fighters to adopt some of the guerrilla tactics used by Mao Zedong, Che Guevara, and Ho Chi Minh. Hackworth described the strategy as &quot;out-G-ing the G.&quot; His personal and professional relationship with Marshall soured as Hackworth became suspicious of his methods and motivation.

However, both his assignment with &quot;Slam&quot; Marshall and his time on staff duty at the Pentagon soured Hackworth on the Vietnam War. One aspect of the latter required him to publicly defend the U.S. position on the war in a speaking tour. Even with his reservations concerning the conflict, he refused to resign, feeling it was his duty as a field grade officer to wage the campaign as best he could.
Hackworth was assigned to a training battalion at Fort Lewis, Washington, and then returned to Vietnam to lead elements of the 9th Infantry Division, turning his theories about guerrilla warfare and how to counter it into practice with the 4th Battalion, 39th Infantry Regiment (4-39 Infantry) in the Mekong Delta, an underperforming unit made up largely of conscripts which Hackworth transformed into the counter-insurgent &quot;Hardcore&quot; Battalion (Recondo) from January to late May 1969.

Hackworth next served as a senior military adviser to the ARVN, the South Vietnamese army. His view that the U.S. Army was not learning from its mistakes, and that ARVN officers were essentially corrupt and ineffective, created friction with Army leadership.

In early 1971, Hackworth was promoted to the rank of colonel and received orders to attend the Army War College, an indication that he was being groomed for the general officer ranks. He had declined a previous opportunity to go to the War College, and turned down this one, as well, indicating his lack of interest in becoming a general and demonstrating his discontent with the war and the Army&#x27;s leaders.

===Criticism===
Hackworth&#x27;s dissatisfaction ultimately culminated in a television interview with ABC. On June 27, 1971, he appeared on the program &quot;Issues and Answers&quot; and strongly criticized U.S. commanders in Vietnam, said the war could not be won and called for U.S. withdrawal. The interview enraged senior U.S. Army officers at the Pentagon.

He subsequently retired as a colonel. Senior Army leaders investigated Hackworth, who avoided them for several weeks. He was nearly court-martialed for various allegations during his Vietnam service, such as running a brothel, running gambling houses, and exploiting his position for personal profit by manipulating the scrip in which soldiers were paid and the limited U.S. currency available in the war zone. Ultimately, Secretary of the Army Robert Froehlke opted not to press charges, deciding that Hackworth&#x27;s career accomplishments outweighed his supposed misdeeds and that prosecuting an outspoken war hero would result in unneeded bad publicity for the Army.

==Post-military career==
===Australia===
After leaving the Army, Hackworth settled on the Australian Gold Coast near Brisbane. He soon made a fortune through profitable ventures that included real estate investing, a duck farm, and a popular restaurant called Scaramouche. He was also active in the Australian antinuclear movement.

===Writing ===
Hackworth returned to the U.S. in the mid-1980s and began working as a contributing editor on defense issues for &quot;Newsweek&quot;. He also made regular television appearances to discuss various military-related topics, and the shortcomings of the military. His commentary on the psychological effects of post-traumatic stress disorder, based on his own experiences in overcoming it, resonated with disabled veterans.

In the mid-1990s, Hackworth investigated Admiral Jeremy Michael Boorda, then Chief of Naval Operations. Hackworth, through his &quot;Newsweek&quot; articles, questioned Boorda&#x27;s longtime wearing of two bronze &quot;valor pins&quot; (in the Navy, the &quot;V&quot; device was worn on certain decorations to denote valor in combat or direct combat participation with the enemy) on his Navy Commendation Medal and Navy Achievement Medal service ribbons, generating much controversy. Boorda committed suicide before he could be interviewed by Hackworth, who had received at least one Army Commendation Medal and other decorations with the &quot;V&quot; device from the U.S. Army in the Vietnam War (in the Army, the &quot;V&quot; device denoted valor in combat only). The Navy reviewed the matter and determined afterwards that the two &quot;Combat Distinguishing Devices&quot; (Combat &quot;V&quot;&#x27;s) that Boorda had worn on two of his uniform service ribbons since the Vietnam War and until almost a year before Hackworth&#x27;s and &quot;Newsweek&#x27;s&quot; intervention, were both unauthorized despite the fact Boorda and some others serving on Boorda&#x27;s destroyer had been given verbal authorization for the devices by Admiral Elmo Zumwalt during the war.

Hackworth&#x27;s last assignment in a combat/conflict zone was with &quot;Newsweek&quot; during the initial deployment of US forces into Bosnia and Herzegovina as part of the Implementation Force in February 1996. Hackworth joined 3rd Battalion, 5th Cavalry of the 1st Brigade, 1st Armored Division near the disputed village of Brcko. Hackworth interviewed a number of officers and enlisted soldiers, reinforcing his historical tenure as a seasoned combat veteran of previous wars and as a well-known and respected journalist.

Hackworth appeared on countless television and radio talk shows and formed his own website, Soldiers for the Truth, continuing to be the self-proclaimed voice of the &quot;grunts&quot; (ground troops) until his death.

King Features Syndicate distributed Hackworth&#x27;s weekly column &quot;Defending America&quot;. Many of his columns discussed the War on Terrorism and the Iraq War and were concerned with the policies of the American leadership in conducting the wars, as well as the conditions of the soldiers serving. Hackworth continued the column until his death from bladder cancer in May 2005. Associates believe that his cancer was caused by exposure to Agent Blue (a defoliant used in Vietnam), and are lobbying the United States government to have the substance labeled a known carcinogen like the more famous Agent Orange.

==Military decorations and awards==
Hackworth earned over 90 U.S. and foreign military awards and frequently wore a CIB lapel pin on his civilian sport jackets.

His military awards include:



==Distinguished Service Cross citations==
== Admiral Boorda accusations and Media apologies over Hackworth reporting==
In 1996, Hackworth accused Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Michael Boorda of wearing two unauthorized service ribbons on his uniform denoting valor in combat. Boorda committed suicide during Hackworth&#x27;s investigation. In 1997, Hackworth was accused of wearing unauthorised decorations: an extra Distinguished Flying Cross and a Ranger Tab. An audit later proved it was a US Army administrative error and not the fault of Hackworth.

In response to Hackworth&#x27;s investigation of Admiral Boorda, CNN and the &quot;CBS Evening News with Dan Rather&quot; questioned the accuracy of Hackworth&#x27;s own military decorations. In particular, the reports accused Hackworth of claiming a Ranger Tab to which he was not entitled and an extra Distinguished Flying Cross listed on his website. Hackworth threatened to sue CBS and requested a formal audit of his military records. In response to the findings made from the military audit, the executive producer of CBS News sent a letter to Hackworth that stated:

In 2002, Hackworth was asked about the controversy in an interview with &quot;Proceedings&quot;. In the interview, he stated:

<text>Acoustic Control Corporation was a manufacturer of instrument amplifiers, founded by Steve Marks (with the help of his father) and based in Van Nuys, California. Its original location was a shack on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles, California.

==History==
Most of the amplifiers produced by ACC were solid-state, but a few models later in production were valve amps. The company is remembered in particular for its Acoustic 361 bass stack, consisting of an Acoustic 360 bass pre-amplifier and one or two Acoustic 361 W-bins, each featuring a built-in 200-watt RMS power amplifier and a rear-facing 18&quot; Cerwin-Vega loudspeaker. 

Acoustic also produced the &quot;Black Widow&quot; electric guitar and electric bass 1972 - 1975. The guitars and basses were based on designs used by Paul Barth for his Bartell guitars and basses. The majority of the guitars were built in Japan although Semi Moseley (of Mosrite fame) claimed to have built the last 200 guitars. One user associated with this guitar was jazz guitarist Larry Coryell who had an endorsement deal. Jimmy Nolen of James Brown&#x27;s band was also a &quot;Black Widow&quot; user.

Robby Krieger of The Doors was the most high-profile early user of the Acoustic 260 head and 261 cabinet—the first models ever produced by ACC. Krieger&#x27;s Acoustic amps were a major public-relations boost for the fledgling company. Albert King and Chuck Berry also used the 260 and 261. Canadian guitar virtuoso Frank Marino used the 270 model amplifier as did Frank Zappa, Pete Townshend and Ernie Isley. Pat Metheny used the Acoustic 134 model combo guitar amplifier. Bassist Jaco Pastorius was a famous user of Acoustic bass amplifiers, using two 360/361 units onstage. Other bass amp users included Gary Thain from Uriah Heep, Larry Graham, Jimmie Randall, John Paul Jones, Carl Radle, Kelly Groucutt, Ric Grech, John McVie, Tony Stevens, Peter &quot;Overend&quot; Watts, Danny Sheridan, Rod Ellicott (Cold Blood), Flea, John Deacon, and Kirk Powers, the last two using an Acoustic 371 (combination of the 370 amp &amp; 301 bass cabinet). The Mahavishnu Orchestra members (bass, keyboards, violin excluding John McLaughlin) used Acoustic amplifiers. Verden Allen, organist with Mott the Hoople used a 260 head amp. In the early &#x27;70s the Dutch band Focus used the 271 and 371 models while on the tour following the release of their &quot;Focus II&quot; LP.

Acoustic Control Corporation went out of business in the 1980s, then returned under the name True Tone Audio as a manufacturer of P.A. amplifiers.

Latter-day employee and designer Steve Rabe went on to establish specialist bass amplifier manufacturer SWR (now owned by Fender Musical Instruments Corporation) in 1984, then Raven Labs in 1998.

Acoustic returned in 2007 under the name Acoustic Amplification, starting with the models B20 and AB50.

In 2011 another branch of Acoustic, Acoustic USA founded by George Grexa and manufactured by The G.P.G. Co, launched a new version of the 360/361 bass amplifier as well as various speaker cabinets and a power amplifier. The new re-designed version of the historic Acoustic 360/361 has immediately featured bassists like Flea, Antonio Iorio and many others.

<text>Stone Mountain is a quartz monzonite dome monadnock and the site of Stone Mountain Park, east of Atlanta, Georgia. Outside the park is the city of Stone Mountain, Georgia. The park is the most visited tourist site in the state of Georgia.

The park is owned by the state of Georgia. At its summit, the elevation is above sea level and above the surrounding area. Stone Mountain is well known for not only its geology, but also the enormous rock relief on its north face, the largest bas-relief artwork in the world. The carving, completed in 1972, depicts three Confederate leaders, Jefferson Davis, Robert E. Lee, and Stonewall Jackson.

Stone Mountain, once owned by the Venable Brothers, was seen from the outset &quot;as a memorial to the Confederacy.&quot; Stone Mountain Park officially opened on April 14, 1965 – 100 years to the day after Lincoln&#x27;s assassination, although the park had already been in use for a few years.

The mountain, which ranges in composition from quartz monzonite to granite and granodiorite, is more than in circumference at its base. The summit of the mountain can be reached by a walk-up trail on the west side of the mountain or by the Skyride aerial tram.

==Geology==

Stone Mountain is a pluton, a type of igneous intrusion. Primarily composed of quartz monzonite, the dome of Stone Mountain was formed during the formation of the Blue Ridge Mountains around 300–350 million years ago (during the Carboniferous period), part of the Appalachian Mountains. It formed as a result of the upwelling of magma from within the Earth&#x27;s crust. This magma solidified to form granite within the crust below the surface.

The Stone Mountain pluton continues underground at its longest point into Gwinnett County. Numerous reference books and Georgia literature have dubbed Stone Mountain as &quot;the largest exposed piece of granite in the world&quot;. This misconception is most likely a result of misrepresentation by granite companies and early park administration. Stone Mountain, though often called a pink granite dome, actually ranges in composition from quartz monzonite to granite and granodiorite.

The minerals within the rock include quartz, plagioclase feldspar, microcline, and muscovite, with smaller amounts of biotite and tourmaline. The tourmaline is mostly black in color, and the majority of it exists as optically continuous skeletal crystals, but much larger, euhedral pegmatitic tourmaline crystals can also be found in the mountain&#x27;s numerous, cross-cutting felsic dikes.
Embedded in the granite are xenoliths or pieces of foreign rocks entrained in the magma.

The granite intruded into the metamorphic rocks of the Piedmont region during the last stages of the Alleghenian Orogeny, which was the time when North America and North Africa collided. Over time, erosion eventually exposed the present mountain of more resistant igneous rock. This intrusion of granite also gave rise to Panola Mountain and Arabia Mountain, both in DeKalb County, smaller outcroppings farther south of Stone Mountain.

==Natural history==
The top of the mountain is a landscape of bare rock and rock pools, and it provides views of the surrounding area including the skyline of downtown Atlanta, often Kennesaw Mountain, and on very clear days even the Appalachian Mountains. On some days, the top of the mountain is shrouded in a heavy fog, and visibility may be limited to only a few feet.

The clear freshwater pools on the summit form by rainwater gathering in eroded depressions, and are home to unusual clam shrimp and fairy shrimp. The tiny shrimp appear only during the rainy season. Through the process of cryptobiosis, the tiny shrimp eggs (or cysts) can remain dormant for years in the dried out depressions, awaiting favorable conditions. These vernal pools are also home to several federally listed rare and endangered plant species, such as black-spored quillwort (&quot;Isoetes melanospora&quot;) and pool sprite (also called snorkelwort, &quot;Gratiola amphiantha&quot;).

The mountain&#x27;s lower slopes are wooded. The rare Georgia oak was first discovered at the summit, and several specimens can easily be found along the walk-up trail and in the woods around the base of the mountain. In the fall, the Confederate yellow daisy (&quot;Helianthus porteri&quot;) flowers appear on the mountain, growing in rock crevices and in the large wooded areas. More than 120 wildflowers, most of them native to the Southern Appalachians and including several rare or federally protected species, have been identified on the mountain.
==Confederate Memorial Carving==



The largest bas-relief sculpture in the world, the Confederate Memorial Carving depicts three Confederate leaders of the Civil War: President Jefferson Davis and Generals Robert E. Lee and Thomas J. &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson (on their favorite horses, Blackjack, Traveller, and Little Sorrel, respectively). The sculpture was cut deep into the mountain, measures in height and in width, and lies above the ground.

David Freeman, writing on the origins of the memorial, states: &quot;Who first conceived of a Confederate memorial on the side of Stone Mountain has long been a matter of debate... The written evidence...points to Francis Ticknor, a nineteenth-century physician and poet from Jones County, Georgia...in an 1869 poem... William H. Terrell, an Atlanta attorney and son of a Confederate veteran, ...suggested it publicly on May 26, 1914 in an editorial for the &quot;Atlanta Constitution&quot;.&quot; Three weeks later, Georgian John Temple Graves, editor of the &quot;New York American&quot;, suggested it should have a statue of Robert E. Lee.

The project was greatly advanced by C. Helen Plane, a charter member of the United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC) and first president and Honorary Life President of the Georgia State Division. After obtaining the approval of the Georgia UDC, she set up the UDC Stone Mountain Memorial Association in 1914, when she was 85 years old. She convinced Samuel Venable of the Venable Brothers Granite Company, an active Klan member and owner of the mountain, to deed one side of the mountain for the project. She chose the sculptor Gutzon Borglum for the project and invited him to visit the mountain (although, despite his Ku Klux Klan involvement, she &quot;would not shake his hand—he was, after all, a Yankee&quot;). She met him at the Atlanta train station, took him to her family&#x27;s summer home, Mont Rest, at the foot of the mountain, and introduced him to Samuel Venable. Borglum also enlisted Luigi Del Bianco, whom he would also involve in Mount Rushmore.

Borglum&#x27;s original plan was having five groups of figures, sixty-five mounted officers representing the states (to be chosen by the states), General Nathan Bedford Forrest and his cavalry—some 700 to 1,000 figures, each from to high. In addition, Borglum planned a room cut into the mountain, wide, and high, faced by 13 columns.

Venable deeded the north face of the mountain to the UDC in 1916, on the condition that it complete a sizable Civil War monument in 12 years. Finances as well as technical problems slowed progress. The U.S. Mint issued a 1925 Commemorative silver U.S. half dollar, bearing the words &quot;Stone Mountain&quot;, as a fundraiser for the monument. This issue, which required the approval of both the 1926 Congress and President Calvin Coolidge, was the largest issue of commemorative coins by the U.S. government up to that time.

Financial conflicts between Borglum and the Association led to his firing in 1925. Borglum destroyed his models, claiming that they were his property, but the Association disagreed and had a warrant issued for his arrest. He was warned of the arrest and narrowly escaped to North Carolina, whose governor, Angus McLean, refused to extradite him, though he could not return to Georgia. The affair was highly publicized and there was much discussion and discord, including discord between Sam Venable, the Association and Association president Hollins Randolph. The face of Lee that Borglum had partially completed was blasted off the mountain in 1928.

After a number of sculptors turned them down, Augustus Lukeman took up the work in 1925, with a different, smaller design. Fundraising was even more difficult after the public debate and name-calling, and work stopped in 1928. In 1941, segregationist Governor Eugene Talmadge formed the Stone Mountain Memorial Association (SMMA) to continue work on the memorial, but the project was delayed once again by the United States&#x27; entry into World War II (1941–45).

In response to the 1954 &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; Supreme Court ruling and the birth of the civil rights movement, in 1958, at the urging of segregationist Governor Marvin Griffin, the Georgia legislature approved a measure to purchase Stone Mountain at a price of $1,125,000. In 1963, Walker Hancock was selected to complete the carving, and work began in 1964. The carving was dedicated in a ceremony on May 9, 1970. The carving was completed by Roy Faulkner on March 3, 1972. Faulkner in 1985 opened the Stone Mountain Carving Museum (now closed) on nearby Memorial Drive commemorating the carving&#x27;s history. An extensive archival collection related to the project is now at Emory University, with the bulk of the materials dating from 1915 to 1930; the finding aid provides a history of the project, and an index of the papers contained in the collection.

Four flags of the Confederacy are flown at the site. The Stone Mountain Memorial Lawn &quot;contains...thirteen terraces—one for each Confederate state... Each terrace flies the flag that the state flew as member of the Confederacy.&quot;

===The Replica Plantation===
In 1963, there opened beneath the sculpture a replica plantation, where slave quarters were described as &quot;neat&quot; and &quot;well furnished&quot; in promotional materials. The slaves were called &quot;hands&quot; or &quot;workers&quot;, and black actress Butterfly McQueen (from &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;) was hired to guide and inform visitors. The park states that the plantation was inspired by &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;. &quot;Historic Square was opened in 1963 and was originally known as Stone Acres Plantation and later as the Antebellum Plantation before being renamed Historic Square... Historic Square&#x27;s clapboard slave cabins were moved intact from the Graves Plantation near Covington, Georgia, where they were built between 1825 and 1840&quot;.

===Involvement of the Ku Klux Klan===
According to sociologist James W. Loewen, Stone Mountain was &quot;&quot;the&quot; sacred site to members of the second and third national klans.&quot; Loewen describes how the rebirth of the Ku Klux Klan—the second Klan—was inspired by D. W. Griffith&#x27;s 1915 Klan-glorifying film, &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot;. That was followed in August by the highly publicized lynching of Leo Frank, who had been convicted of murder, in nearby Marietta, Georgia. On November 25 of the same year, Thanksgiving Day, a small group, including fifteen robed and hooded &quot;charter members&quot; of the new organization, met at the summit of Stone Mountain to create a new iteration of the Klan. Led by William J. Simmons, it included two elderly members of the original Klan. As part of their ceremony, they set up on the summit an altar covered with a flag, opened a Bible, and burned a cross.

James R. Venable attended the 1915 revival of the KKK on top of Stone Mountain and later became an Imperial Wizard of the National Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, which was one of the later KKK factions. He owned land at the base of the mountain that he had inherited from his ancestors, and in October 1923 he granted the Klan an easement with perpetual right to hold celebrations as they desired. However, the property was condemned in 1960 at the behest of the Stone Mountain Memorial Association.

The Klan also held cross-burnings at the summit of the mountain on different occasions from 1915 onward. This practice came to an end in 1962, when the Klan attempted to hold a mountaintop cross-burning in response to the NAACP holding its national convention in Atlanta. The Stone Mountain Memorial Association did not want either group using state property for demonstrations, and convinced Governor Ernest Vandiver to order state troopers to stop the event. Seventy troopers attempted to stop several hundred Klansmen gathered at the base of the mountain from climbing to the summit, but the Klansmen were armed with billy clubs, flashlights, and stones, and greatly outnumbered the officers. The police negotiated a truce with the local Klan Grand Dragon, under which the Klansmen would refrain from further violence, but 20 of their number would be allowed to climb the mountain for a &quot;religious ceremony&quot;, and the cross-burning was substituted with the lighting of a flare.

In August 2017, the Klan was denied a permit for a mountaintop cross-burning.

Fundraising for the monument resumed in 1923. The influence of the UDC continued, in support of Mrs. Plane&#x27;s vision of a carving explicitly for the purpose of creating a Confederate memorial. She suggested in a letter to the first sculptor, Gutzon Borglum:

The UDC established the Stone Mountain Confederate Memorial Association (SMCMA) for fundraising and on-site supervision of the project. Venable and Borglum, both closely associated with the Klan, arranged to pack the SMCMA with Klan members. The SMCMA, along with the United Daughters of the Confederacy, continued fundraising efforts. Of the $250,000 (~$ in ) raised, part came from the federal government, which in 1925 issued commemorative fifty-cent coins with the soldiers Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson on them. The image on the back of the coin was based on &quot;The Last Meeting of Lee and Jackson&quot;, executed in 1869 by Everett B. D. Fabrino Julio, itself an icon of Lost Cause mythology; it is now in the American Civil War Museum (until 2012 the Museum of the Confederacy). When the state completed the purchase in 1960, it condemned the property to void Venable&#x27;s agreement to allow the Klan perpetual right to hold meetings on the premises.

===Proposed removal of the carving===

After the Charleston church shooting in mid-2015, Stone Mountain was the subject of a political debate related to the removal of symbols of the Confederacy. This controversy was stimulated by a movement in other states to remove the Confederate battle flag and statues of Confederate leaders from public areas.

In July 2015, the Atlanta NAACP proposed removing the Confederate carving from Stone Mountain Park. However, this would require the approval of the Georgia Legislature, as would any change to a &quot;military monument&quot; in the state.

On October 11, 2015, &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; reported the park was considering a proposal of a permanent &quot;Freedom Bell&quot; honoring Martin Luther King Jr. and the line &quot;Let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia&quot;, from King&#x27;s 1963 &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech. The proposed monument is inspired by a bell-ringing ceremony held in 2013 honoring the 50th anniversary of King&#x27;s speech. It is not supported by the NAACP or King-founded Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), who want the Confederate symbols removed rather than a King symbol added. Advance Local reported in 2015 that both the DeKalb County branch of the NAACP and the Sons of Confederate Veterans were opposed to the bell because it would have been put next to a Confederate monument. Representatives of the NAACP were quoted in the article saying &quot;It&#x27;s an attempt to gain support from blacks to keep these racist and demeaning symbols.&quot;

In August 2017, after the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia—a white nationalist protest against the removal of the Robert E. Lee monument and Stonewall Jackson sculpture in the city—turned violent, many people across the country again demanded the removal of Confederate monuments and memorials as part of a national political debate. Georgia State Representative and Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams called for the removal, by sandblasting, of Stone Mountain&#x27;s carving. She called it &quot;a blight upon our state&quot;.

On July 5, 2020, 100 to 200 armed protesters came to Stone Mountain to call for the carving&#x27;s removal. Known as the Not Fucking Around Coalition (NFAC), it was a protest against both overt and systemic racism, calling out white supremacists, with the location being chosen in part due to its history as the place where the Ku Klux Klan was re-formed.

On August 15, 2020, the park administration temporarily closed its gates in reaction to a gathering of white nationalists planned there, and the city&#x27;s public buses were suspended for the day. Nevertheless, a fight broke out downtown between groups of white supremacists, Black Lives Matter counter-protestors, and people who wish to keep Confederate monuments in place, though no injuries were reported.

==History==

Human habitation of Stone Mountain and its surroundings date back into prehistory. When the mountain was first encountered by European explorers, its summit was encircled by a rock wall, similar to that still to be found on Georgia&#x27;s Fort Mountain. The wall is believed to have been built by early Native American inhabitants of the area, although its purpose remains unclear. By the beginning of the 20th century, the wall had disappeared, the rocks having been taken away by early visitors as souvenirs, rolled down the rockface, or removed by the commercial quarrying operation. The mountain was the eastern end of the Campbellton Trail, a Native American path that ran through what is now the Atlanta area.
Europeans first learned of the mountain in 1567, when Spanish explorers were told of a mountain farther inland which was &quot;very high, shining when the sun set like a fire.&quot; By this time, the Stone Mountain area was inhabited by the Creek and (to a lesser extent) Cherokee peoples.

In the early 19th century, the area was known as Rock Mountain. After the founding of DeKalb County and the county seat of Decatur in 1822, Stone Mountain was a natural recreation area; it was common for young couples on dates to ride to the mountain on horseback. The mountain is easy to climb and there has been a path since the nineteenth century.
Entrepreneur Aaron Cloud built a wooden observation tower at the summit of the mountain in 1838, but it was destroyed by a storm and replaced by a much smaller tower in 1851. Visitors to the mountain would travel to the area by rail and road, and then walk up the mountaintop trail to the top, where Cloud also had a restaurant and club.
Granite quarrying started at Stone Mountain in the 1830s, but became a major industry following the completion of a railroad spur to the quarry site in 1847. This line was rebuilt by the Georgia Railroad in 1869. Over the years, Stone Mountain granite was used in many buildings and structures, including the locks of the Panama Canal, the steps to the East Wing of the United States Capitol and the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo. In recent years, granite suppliers in Georgia sent stone samples cut from Stone Mountain to the group responsible for planning the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial in Washington, D.C.; the foundation later chose to use granite imported from China. Quarrying during earlier periods also destroyed several spectacular geological features on Stone Mountain, such as the Devil&#x27;s Crossroads, which was located on top of the mountain.
In 1887, Stone Mountain was purchased for $45,000 by the Venable Brothers of Atlanta, who quarried the mountain for 24 more years, and descendants of the Venable family would retain ownership of the mountain until it was purchased by the State of Georgia in 1958.

Martin Luther King Jr. mentioned the monument in his &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech at the August 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, when he said &quot;let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia!&quot;

During the 1996 Summer Olympics, Stone Mountain Park provided venues for Olympic events in tennis, archery and track cycling. The venues for archery and cycling were temporary and are now part of the songbird and habitat trail.

Some of the outdoor scenes for the Netflix series &quot;Stranger Things&quot; were filmed in the park.

===Aviation incidents===
According to George Weiblen&#x27;s annotated calendar for Monday, May 7, 1928: &quot;Mail plane crashed on mountain at 8:00 P.M.&quot; The pilot, Johnny S. Kytle (1905–1931), not only survived the crash, but managed to grab the mail and walk down the mountain.

Around dusk on September 16, 2003, in clear weather, a small airplane circled the mountain five times, crashed headlong into the south side, and burst into flames. The pilot was killed. A witness testifying at the NTSB investigation stated that the pilot, a 69-year-old accountant, had threatened on multiple occasions to commit suicide by flying into the mountain. The official NTSB accident report lists the probable cause as &quot;The pilot&#x27;s intentional flight into the ground for the purpose of suicide while impaired by alcohol.&quot;

===Governance===
Stone Mountain Park, which surrounds the Confederate Memorial, is owned by the state of Georgia and managed by the Stone Mountain Memorial Association, a Georgia state authority. As of August, 2022, the board entered a 10-year contract (with the option to renew for up to 30 years) with Thrive Attractions Management Group, LLC, to operate park attractions. The Stone Mountain Memorial Association retains ownership, while Thrive keeps 2% of the annual gross revenues from the park&#x27;s hotels and 3% of gross revenues from other areas.

From 1999 to 2022, park attractions were managed by Herschend Family Entertainment Corporation, which had a 30-year contract to operate attractions. Under terms of a 1999 agreement, Herschend paid the state of Georgia $11 million (~$ in ) annually, while the Stone Mountain Memorial Association had the right to reject any project deemed unfit. In 2018, Herschend Family Entertainment Corporation decided to end their contract early after only 20 years due to record losses in 2017 and 2018, citing decreased revenues and &quot;protests and division&quot; fueled by the park&#x27;s ubiquitous Confederate imagery as factors. Bids for a new management company for Stone Mountain Park were submitted in October 2021. Thrive Attractions Management Group, LLC, started by the previous Vice President of Herschend Family Entertainment Corporation and general manager of Stone Mountain Park for 10 years, Michael Dombrowski, submitted the only bid to the Mountain Memorial Association, which was approved on May 23, 2022.

==Places of interest==

Confederate Hall, operated directly by the Stone Mountain Memorial Association (SMMA), is a museum that educates students and park guests on the geology and ecology of Stone Mountain as well as historical aspects of the area. A small theater shows a historical documentary about the Civil War in Georgia called &quot;The Battle for Georgia&quot;.

The education department is host to thousands of students each school year, teaching the subjects of geology, ecology, and history. Classes are designed to meet the Georgia Performance Standards and the North American Association for Environmental Education guidelines.

Historic Square (formerly The Antebellum Plantation and Farmyard) is an open-air museum composed of 19 historic buildings, built between 1790 and 1875, that have been re-erected on the site to represent a pre-Civil War Georgia plantation. The historic houses have been furnished with an extensive collection of period furniture and decorations. The farm features a petting zoo.

A grist mill dates from 1869 and was moved to the park in 1965. A covered bridge dates from 1892 and originally spanned the Oconee River in Athens, Georgia.

The park provides daily concerts on a large carillon that originated at the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair. The instrument consists of 732 bell-tone rods, electronically amplified through 60 speakers in a decorative 13-story structure.

===Broadcast tower===

The short broadcast tower on the top of the mountain transmits two non-commercial stations: television station WGTV TV 8, and weather radio station KEC80 on 162.55 MHz. FM radio station WABE FM 90.1 was located on this tower from 1984 until 2005, when it was required to relocate to accommodate WGTV&#x27;s digital conversion. W266BW FM 101.1 now has a permit as well. Atop the tower also sits the W4BOC amateur radio repeater, which operates on a frequency of 146.760 MHz. The tower is also used for the park&#x27;s Project 25 two-way radio systems.

===Scenic railroad===
===Stone Mountain trails===

Walk Up Trail is a trail to the top of Stone Mountain ascending in elevation to a height of . The trail is steep, but spectacular panoramic views and cool winds await hikers at the top.

Cherokee Trail is an National Recreation Trail. It loops around the mountain base, with a mile section going up and over the west side of the mountain (crosses Walk Up Trail). It passes primarily through an oak-hickory forest, but views of the lakes, streams, and mountain are common.

Nature Garden Trail is a scenic loop trail through a mature oak-hickory forest community, it is excellent for viewing shade-loving native plants. A small garden with interpretive native plant signs is at the entrance to the trail.

Songbird Habitat Trails comprise two loop trails each running . The field trail is a birding spot and the woodland trail provides shade and numerous native plants. Dogs are not allowed.

===Park attractions===
The park features several attractions that are operated by Herschend Family Entertainment Corporation. The Skyride, a Swiss-built cable car to the summit of the mountain, passes by the carving on the way up.

Historic Square is a collection of historic buildings relocated from around the state of Georgia, including three plantation houses dating from 1794, 1850 and 1845; two slave cabins; a barn; and other outbuildings. The Historic Square Farmyard features historic breeds of sheep, goats and pigs. Atlanta architect James Means, investor Christie Bell Kennedy, and antiques dealer Kenneth Garcia chose, moved, arranged, altered, and decorated the buildings between 1960 and 1963. Modeled after Colonial Williamsburg, the commercial concession originally opened as the &quot;Antebellum Plantation&quot;.

Crossroads is a recreation of an 1872 Southern town with several attractions that include a modern 4-D movie theater, an adventure mini-golf course and a duck-tour ride. The duck boats have been replaced by the Rockin&#x27; Land and Lake Tour in 2019 due to several deaths in other locations caused by duck-boat accidents. The tour includes a ride on a double-decker open-top bus and a pontoon boat ride at the marina. There are stores and restaurants. Craft demonstrators include glass blowing and candy-making.

The Dinotorium is a children&#x27;s activity area that features 65 interactive games, climbing structures, trampoline floors and slides. Sky Hike is a family ropes adventure course; Geyser Towers is a playground featuring a large fountain at the entrance.

On summer evenings, the mountain hosts the Stone Mountain Laser Show Spectacular, a fireworks and laser lighting display. The laser light show projects images of the Deep South as well as Georgia history onto the Confederate Memorial carving. During Memorial Day Weekend of 2011, Stone Mountain unveiled its overhaul of the laser show, dubbed Mountainvision, which incorporates digital projections, lasers, special effects, and pyrotechnics. On Memorial Day Weekend of 2023 Stone Mountain park officially retired the Laser Show to make way for the brand new Music Across America Light Show. The Laser Show currently runs on selected nights as of 2023.

<text>An electronic keyboard, portable keyboard, or digital keyboard is an electronic musical instrument based on keyboard instruments. Electronic keyboards include synthesizers, digital pianos, stage pianos, electronic organs and digital audio workstations. In technical terms, an electronic keyboard is a rompler-based synthesizer with a low-wattage power amplifier and small loudspeakers.

Electronic keyboards offer a diverse selection of instrument sounds (piano, organ, violin, etc.) along with synthesizer tones. Designed primarily for beginners and home users, they generally feature unweighted keys. While budget models lack velocity sensitivity, mid-range options and above often include it.  These keyboards have limited sound editing options, focusing on preset sounds. Casio and Yamaha are major manufacturers in this market, known for popularizing the concept since the 1980s.

==Terminology==

An electronic keyboard may also be called a digital keyboard, or home keyboard, the latter often refers to less advanced or inexpensive models intended for beginners. The obscure term &quot;portable organ&quot; was widely used in Asian countries to refer to electronic keyboards in the 1990s, due to the similar features between electronic keyboards and electronic home organs, the latter of which were popular in the late 20th century.

In Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, most types of electronic keyboards (including digital pianos and stage pianos) were simply often referred to as a &quot;synthesizer&quot; (Russian: синтезатор, &quot;sintezator&quot;), usually with no other term to distinguish them from actual digital synthesizers.

The term &quot;electronic keyboard&quot; may also be used to refer to a synthesizer or digital piano in colloquial usage

==Components==
The major components of a typical modern electronic keyboard are:
* Musical keyboard: Electronic keyboards typically use unweighted keys for portability and affordability. In contrast, digital pianos have weighted or semi-weighted keys to replicate the feel of acoustic pianos.
* Firmware: A program (usually embedded in a computer chip) which handles user interaction with controllers such as the musical keyboard, menus, and buttons. These controllers enable the user to select different instrument sounds (e.g., piano, guitar, strings, drum kit), digital effects (reverb, echo, chorus or sustain), and other features (e.g., transposition, accompaniments, sequencer, recording, external media, etc.). The user interface system usually includes an LCD screen that gives the user information about the synthesized sound they have selected like tempo, or effects that are activated (e.g., reverb) and other features.
* Computerized musical arranger: A software program which produces rhythms and chords by the means of computerized commands, typically MIDI. Electronic hardware can also do this. Most computerized arrangers can play a selection of rhythms (e.g., rock, pop, jazz).
* Sound generator: A rompler, typically contained within an integrated Read-only memory (ROM), which is capable of accepting MIDI commands and producing sounds. Electronic keyboard romplers usually incorporate sample-based synthesis, but more advanced keyboards might sometimes feature physical modeling synthesis.
* Amplifier and speakers: an internal audio power amplifier, typically ranging from less than 2.5 to over 30 watts, connected to the sound generator chip. The amplifier is then connected to small, low-powered speakers that reproduce the synthesized sounds so that the listener can hear them. Older and less expensive keyboards may have a single mono speaker. Most keyboards usually have two speakers producing stereo sound, often with bass ports and tweeters for more advanced models.
* Power supply: Keyboards may or may not have an internal power supply system built to the main circuit board, but most modern keyboards are often equipped with an included AC adapter.
* MIDI terminals: Most keyboards usually incorporate 5-pin MIDI connections for data communication, typically so the keyboard can be connected with either a computer or another electronic musical instrument, such as a synthesizer, a drum machine or a sound module, allowing it to be used as a MIDI controller. Not all keyboards have conventional MIDI terminals and connector. The least expensive models may have no MIDI connections. Post-2000s keyboards may have a USB-B instead, which serve as both input and output in a single connection. Since the 2010s, MIDI in/out terminals are only available in professional-grade keyboards, stage pianos and high-end synthesizers, while low-cost home keyboards, digital pianos, and lower-end synthesizers use USB as the only connection available. 
* Flash memory: Some electronic keyboards have a small amount of onboard memory (usually in several megabytes) for storing data such as recorded songs, MIDI files, and other proprietary files.
* External storage device: Usually available on professional-grade keyboards and synthesizers, this allows the user to store data in externally connected storage media such as ROM cartridges, floppy disks, memory cards and USB flash drives. Floppy disks and cartridges were obsolete by the early 2000s, with memory cards starting to replace them shortly afterwards. USB storage was popularized by Yamaha&#x27;s lineup of high-end electronic keyboards in the mid-2000s and has become a standard feature since. Most keyboards since the 2010s use USB storage, with the exception of certain Casio models, which use SD cards instead.
* Music stand: A metal or plastic rack for holding sheet music or music books upright. The music stand is usually removable to facilitate storage and transportation.
* Sustain pedal: If a home keyboard has a sustain feature, replicating the similar device used on acoustic pianos, 1/4&quot; jack is provided for this purpose. By comparison, on a digital piano, a sustain pedal is often built into the frame, usually with a proprietary connector. The least expensive home keyboards do not have a sustain function or a sustain pedal jack, which limits their use to early beginners.

==History==

Keyboard instruments trace back to the ancient hydraulis in the 3rd century BCE, later evolving into the pipe organ and smaller portative and positive organs. The clavichord and harpsichord emerged in the 14th century CE, Technological strides brought more advanced keyboards, including the modern 12-tone version. Initially, instruments like the pipe organ and harpsichord could only produce single-volume sounds. The 18th-century innovation of the pianoforte, with hammers striking metal strings via key pressure, enabled dynamic sound variation.

Electric keyboards began with applying electric sound technology. The first was the Denis d&#x27;or stringed instrument, made by Václav Prokop Diviš in 1748, with 700 electrified strings. In 1760, Jean Baptiste Thillaie de Laborde introduced the clavecin électrique, an electrically activated keyboard without sound creation. Elisha Gray invented the musical telegraph in 1874, producing sound through electromagnetic vibrations. Gray later added a single-note oscillator and a diaphragm-based loudspeaker for audibility.

In 1973, the Yamaha GX-1 introduced an early polyphonic synthesizer with eight voices. The EP-30 by Roland Corporation in 1974 became the first touch-sensitive keyboard. Roland also released early polyphonic string synthesizers, the RS-101 in 1975 and RS-202 in 1976.

In 1975, Moog&#x27;s Polymoog merged a synthesizer with an organ, offering full polyphony through individual circuit boards. Crumar&#x27;s &quot;Multiman&quot; organ with synthesizer arrived, and ARP Omni combined a synthesizer with a string machine and bass in 1976. Korg&#x27;s PE-1000 that year featured a dedicated saw oscillator for each note.

In 1977, Yamaha CS-60 and CS-80 polyphonic synthesizers introduced &#x27;memory&#x27;. In 1978, Oberheim&#x27;s OB-1 brought electronic storage of sound settings. That year, Sequential Circuits Prophet-5 offered the feature in a five-voice polyphonic synthesizer. Fender&#x27;s Rhodes Chroma, the first computer-controlled keyboard, resulted from ARP&#x27;s engineers being acquired by Fender in 1979. Its successor, the Chroma Polaris, released in 1984, featured the &#x27;Chroma&#x27; port.
==Classifications==
Conventional home keyboards differ from other electronic keyboards due to the design, features and target market:
* Digital piano - Electronic keyboards designed to sound and feel like an ordinary acoustic piano. They typically contain an amplifier and loudspeakers built into the instrument. In most cases they can fully replace acoustic pianos and provide several features, such as recording and saving files to a computer. Many digital pianos can imitate the sounds of several instruments, including a grand piano, electric piano, pipe organ, Hammond organ and harpsichord. They are not sensitive to the climate or humidity changes in a room and there is also no need for tuning, as with acoustic pianos. Digital pianos are often mounted on stands with a fixed sustain (or other) pedal attached to the frame; as such, most are not designed for transportation. The target market is mid-level to advanced pianists.
* Stage piano - A type of high-quality digital piano with weighted keys, designed for professional touring use on stage or in a recording studio. Compared to digital pianos, stage pianos usually emphasize on higher-quality electric piano and Hammond organ sounds.
* Synthesizer - Electronic keyboards that use various sound synthesis technologies to produce a wide variety of electronic sounds.
* Workstation - Professional electronic keyboards that combine the features of a synthesizer and a conventional home keyboard. Workstations have a range of high-quality sampled instrument sounds, as well as extensive editing/recording capability, computer connectivity, high-powered speakers, and often include external memory storage for storing customized data, MIDI sequences, and even additional instrument samples. A higher-end workstation keyboard may include several features similar to a digital audio workstation software, allowing an even more advanced features such as mixing, mastering, sound design, creating loops and patterns, composing electronic music, etc.
* MIDI controller - An electronic keyboard that does not produce a sound of its own. It is used to trigger sounds from a sound module or software synthesizer by means of MIDI cable and connections. MIDI controllers often provide other sliders, knobs and buttons, which enable the player to control elements such as volume.
* Keytar - A small synthesizer that resembles a guitar which can be played in similar position as an electric guitar: worn on a strap over the shoulders, enabling the performer to move around on a stage. The name is a portmanteau of &quot;keyboard&quot; and &quot;guitar&quot;.

Compared to digital pianos or stage pianos, digital home keyboards are usually much lower in cost, as they have unweighted keys. Like digital pianos, they usually feature on-board amplifiers and loudspeakers. Stage pianos, however, typically do not have integrated amplifiers and speakers, as these instruments are normally plugged into a keyboard amplifier in a professional concert setting. Unlike synthesizers, the &quot;primary&quot; focus of home electronic keyboards is not on detailed control or creation of sound synthesis parameters. Most home electronic keyboards offer little or no control or editing of the sounds (although a selection of 128 or more preset sounds is typically provided).

==Concepts and definitions==

* Auto accompaniment / chord recognition: Auto accompaniment allows single key presses to trigger entire chords, often within a specific rhythm and style (e.g., rock, pop). Many keyboards can automatically play these chords in tempo with an onboard rhythm track, and offer the ability to form complex chords like inversions.
* Demonstration: Most keyboards come with demo songs showcasing various sounds and effects.  These can be used by salespeople, for self-learning with lighted keys highlighting the correct notes, or simply for enjoyment.
* Velocity sensitivity (or touch sensitivity) allows keyboards to mimic the sound variations caused by how hard a key is pressed. Cheaper keyboards offer basic volume control, while more expensive models replicate the tonal changes of acoustic instruments. This can be done with multiple sensors, multiple samples per key, or by modeling the sound behavior (ADSR envelope).
* After-touch: A feature brought in the late 1980s (although synthesizers like the CS-80 extensively used by artists like Vangelis featured after-touch as early as 1977) whereby dynamics are added after the key is hit, allowing the sound to be modulated in some way (such as fade away or return), based upon the amount of pressure applied to the keyboard. For example, in some synth voices, if the key continues to be pressed hard after the initial note has been sounded, the keyboard will add an effect such as vibrato or sustain. After-touch is found on many mid-range and high-range synthesizers, and is an important modulation source on modern keyboards. After-touch is most prevalent in music of the mid to late 1980s, such as the opening string-pad on Cock Robin&#x27;s &quot;When Your Heart Is Weak&quot;, which is only possible with the use of after-touch (or one hand on the volume control). After-touch is not normally found on inexpensive, beginner-level home keyboards.
* Polyphony: In digital music terminology, polyphony refers to the maximum number of notes that can be produced by the sound generator at once. Polyphony allows significantly smoother and more natural transitions between notes. Inexpensive toy electronic keyboards designed for children can usually only play five to ten notes at a time. Many low priced keyboards can perform 24 or 32 notes at a time. More advanced keyboards can perform over 48 notes at a time with 64 or 128 notes being common. Digital pianos, has more complex polyphonic system and could perform by up to 256 notes.
* Multi-timbre: The ability to play more than one kind of instrument sound at the same time, such as with the Roland MT-32&#x27;s ability to play up to eight different instruments at once.
* Split point: The point on a keyboard where the choice of instrument can be split to allow two instruments to be played at once. In the late 1980s it was common to use a MIDI controller to control more than one keyboard from a single device. The MIDI controller had no sound of its own, but was designed for the sole purpose of allowing access to more sound controls for performance purposes. MIDI controllers allowed one to split the keyboard into two or more sections and assign each section to a MIDI channel, to send note data to an external keyboard. Many consumer keyboards offer at least one split to separate bass or auto-accompaniment chording instruments from the melody instrument.

* Minikeys: Most electronic keyboards have keys that are similar to the size of keys on an acoustic piano. Some electronic keyboards have minikeys, either because they are targeted at child users or to make the instrument smaller and more portable. 
* Accompaniment backing tracks: Pre-programmed musical accompaniment tracks (also called rhythm pattern or rhythm style by some manufacturers), consist of a variety of genres for the player to use (e.g., pop, rock, jazz, country, reggae). The keyboard plays a chord voicing and rhythm which is appropriate for the selected genre. In general, programmed backing tracks usually imitate the sound of a rhythm section or an ensemble. Certain keyboards may include a feature that allows the performer to create, compose and customize their own accompaniments. This feature is usually called a pattern sequencer, rhythm composer, or a style creator.
** In addition to the basic accompaniment tracks, some keyboards have an extra feature to play different loops in conjunction with the backing track itself.
* Accompaniment sections and synchronization: Usually, backing tracks comprises two to four sections, as well as fill-in patterns, introduction/ending patterns, and various synchronizations to improve the effects of the accompaniment.
* Tempo: A parameter that determines the speed of rhythms, chords and other auto-generated content on electronic keyboards. The unit of this parameter is &quot;beats per minute&quot;. Many keyboards feature audio or visual metronomes (using graphics on a portion of the display) to help players keep time.
* Auto harmonization: A feature of some keyboards that automatically adds secondary tones to a note based upon chords given by the accompaniment system, to make harmony easier for players who lack the ability to make complex chord changes with their left hand.
* Wheels and knobs: Used to add effects to a sound that are not present by default, such as vibrato, panning, envelope, tremolo, pitch bending, portamento and so on. A common control on contemporary keyboards is the pitch bend wheel, adjusting the pitch of a note usually in the range of 2 semitones. The pitch bend wheel is usually on the left of the keyboard and is a spring-loaded potentiometer. Some keyboards include a joystick, which often combines all the aforementioned functions in one control unit.
* Drawbars: Usually found only on high-end, expensive keyboards and workstations, this feature allows the performer to emulate digitally-modeled sounds of a tonewheel organ (hence &quot;drawbar&quot;). It consists of nine editable virtual sliders that resemble the drawbars of a tonewheel organ, and features various effects such as rotary speaker, percussion, and tremolo.
* Piano simulation: A common feature of the digital piano, stage piano, and high-end workstations that allows real-time simulation of a sampled piano sound. It provides various piano-related effects, such as room reverberation, sympathetic resonance, piano lid position (as on a grand piano), and settings to adjust the tuning and overall sound quality.
* Keyboard action describes the mechanism and feel of the keyboard. Keyboards can be roughly divided into &quot;non-weighted&quot; and &quot;weighted.&quot;
** Non-weighted keyboards have a light, springy feel to their keys, similar to the action of an organ. The least expensive keyboards, often with non-full size keys, use keys that are mounted on soft rubber pads that also act as electronic switches. Most electronic keyboards use spring-loaded keys that make some kinds of playing techniques, such as backhanded sweeps, impossible, but make the keyboards lighter and easier to transport. Players accustomed to acoustic piano keys may find non-weighted spring-action keyboards uncomfortable and difficult to play effectively. Conversely, keyboard players accustomed to the non-weighted action may encounter difficulty and discomfort playing on an acoustic piano.
** Weighted keyboards indicate that some kind of effort has been made to give the keyboard more resistance and responsive feel similar to that of an acoustic piano.
*** &quot;Semi-weighted keys&quot; is a term applied to keyboards with spring action like a non-weighted keyboard but that have extra weight added to the keys to give them more resistance and responsive feel.
*** &quot;Hammer action keys&quot; use some kind of mechanism to replicate the action of a mechanical piano. This is often achieved with some kind of lever mechanism connected to the key.
*** &quot;Graded hammer action keys&quot; do what hammer action keys do, but also has a different feel on the low versus high notes as on a mechanical piano keyboard. The lower note keys have a higher resistance than the higher note keys.

==MIDI controls==

MIDI, Musical Instrument Digital Interface, is a serial data connection which operates with any make or model of instrument which provides for it. Electronic keyboards use MIDI, a universal language for digital instruments. MIDI transmits which notes are played, their duration, and often velocity (how hard a key is pressed). Keyboards translate key pressure into MIDI velocity data, which controls the loudness of the generated sound.

MIDI data can also be used to add digital effects to the sounds played, such as reverb, chorus, delay and tremolo. These effects are usually mapped to three of the 127 MIDI controls within the keyboard&#x27;s infrastructure – one for reverb, one for chorus and one for other effects – and are generally configurable through the keyboard&#x27;s graphical interface. Additionally, many keyboards have &quot;auto-harmony&quot; effects which will complement each note played with one or more notes of higher or lower pitch, to create an interval or chord.

DSP effects can also be controlled on the fly by physical controllers. Electronic keyboards often have two wheels on the left hand side, generally known as a &quot;pitch bend&quot; and a &quot;modulation wheel&quot;. The difference between these is that the pitch bend wheel always flicks back to its default position – the center – while the modulation wheel can be placed freely. By default, the pitch bend wheel controls the pitch of the note in small values, allowing the simulation of slides and other techniques which control the pitch more subtly. The modulation wheel is usually set to control a tremolo effect by default. However, on most electronic keyboards, the user will be able to map any MIDI control to these wheels. Professional MIDI controller keyboards often also have an array of knobs and sliders to modulate various MIDI controls, which are often used to control DSP effects.

Most electronic keyboards also have a socket at the back, into which a foot switch can be plugged. The most common function is to simulate the sustain on a piano by turning on and off the MIDI control which adds sustain to a note. However, since they are also simple MIDI devices, foot switches can usually be configured to turn on and off any MIDI controlled function, such as switching one of the DSP effects, or the auto-harmony.

==Keyboard ensemble==
In live performances, multiple electronic keyboards could be played together at one time, each by one musician, forming a keyboard ensemble. Keyboard ensembles are mostly performed within a band on an elaborate stage, while some can even serve as a simpler substitute to the more conventional orchestra, replacing stringed and wind instruments.

<text>The United Auto Workers (UAW), fully named International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America, is an American labor union that represents workers in the United States (including Puerto Rico) and southern Ontario, Canada. It was founded as part of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) in the 1930s and grew rapidly from 1936 to the 1950s. The union played a major role in the liberal wing of the Democratic Party under the leadership of Walter Reuther (president 1946–1970). It was known for gaining high wages and pensions for automotive manufacturing workers, but it was unable to unionize auto plants built by foreign-based car makers in the South after the 1970s, and it went into a steady decline in membership; reasons for this included increased automation, decreased use of labor, mismanagement, movements of manufacturing (including reaction to NAFTA), and increased globalization. After a successful strike at the Big Three in 2023, the union organized its first foreign plant (VW) in 2024.

UAW members in the 21st century work in industries including autos and auto parts, health care, casino gambling, and higher education. The union is headquartered in Detroit, Michigan. As of February 24, 2022, the UAW has more than 391,000 active members and more than 580,000 retired members in over 600 local unions and holds 1,150 contracts with some 1,600 employers. It holds assets amounting to just over $1billion.

==History==
===Background and founding===
For most of its history, the American Federation of Labor (AFL) had only focused on organizing skilled workers practicing specific trades, an approach known as craft unionism. Most automobile workers were not skilled, so they were largely unorganized. This changed following the passage of the National Industrial Recovery Act in 1933. AFL president William Green decided to begin an organizing drive among unskilled and semi-skilled workers. Green planned to recruit workers at each factory into a temporary &quot;federal labor union&quot; (FLU), whose members would then be divided up amongst the AFL&#x27;s various craft unions. He sent William Collins to Detroit to organize automobile workers. Collins&#x27; efforts were hampered by an insufficiently militant program, a lack of organizing funds, fear of retaliation among the workers, distrust from Black and foreign workers, and strong opposition from the automobile companies. By 1935 the majority of members had been recruited by militant local activists taking their own initiative at plants outside Michigan. Many of these militant local unions opposed the AFL&#x27;s plan to divide their members into different craft unions. They began advocating for the immediate creation of an automobile workers&#x27; union covering the entire industry. After the Toledo local led an unauthorized but successful strike against General Motors (GM), the AFL caved to pressure and called for a convention.

The UAW&#x27;s founding convention began on August 26, 1935 in Detroit. The total membership of its constituent unions was 25,769. The AFL attempted to keep control of the union by pushing through a charter that denied the rank-and-file the right to elect their own officers. Militant local unions quickly managed to overturn that situation, and the struggle alienated the UAW from the AFL leadership. The UAW joined John L. Lewis&#x27;s caucus of industrial unions, the Committee for Industrial Organization, in 1936. When the AFL expelled the industrial unions in 1938, it joined the new Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO).

===Organizing the Big Three===

The UAW&#x27;s fortunes began to improve after it began organizing on an industrial basis. The union found rapid success with the sitdown strike, a tactic where workers &quot;sit down&quot; at their work stations to occupy a factory. Sitdown strikes enabled small numbers of workers to interrupt the assembly line and stop production across an entire plant. Likewise, it projected power outwards from the factory across the entire supply chain: &quot;just as a militant minority could stop production in an entire plant, so if the plant was a key link in an integrated corporate empire, its occupation could paralyze the corporation.&quot; After winning sitdown strikes at General Motors (GM) plants in Atlanta and Kansas City, the UAW began to demand to represent General Motors workers nationwide. Their efforts culminated in the famous Flint sit-down strike, which began on December 30, 1936. By January 25, strikes and the effects of production shutdowns idled 150,000 workers at fifty General Motors plants from California to New York. Strikers repelled the efforts of the police and National Guard to retake them. On February 11, 1937, General Motors agreed to bargain with the UAW, and eventually recognized the UAW as a bargaining agent under the newly adopted National Labor Relations Act. This recognition marked a turning point in the growth of the UAW and organized labor unions more generally. The next month, auto workers at Chrysler won recognition of the UAW as their representative in a sitdown strike. By mid-1937 the new union claimed 150,000 members and was spreading through the auto and parts manufacturing towns of Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois.

The Ford Motor Company was the last of the &quot;Big Three&quot; automakers to recognize the UAW. Henry Ford and his security manager, Harry Bennett, used brute force to keep the union out of Ford. They set up the Ford Service Department to spy on and intimidate workers. At the Battle of the Overpass, Ford Service Department personnel beat union organizers in front of news photographers. Despite Ford&#x27;s attempts to destroy them, photographs of the incident reached the press and helped turn public opinion against the company. However, Ford continued to refuse to sign a contract. The UAW&#x27;s cause was hindered by its weakness with Black workers. Older Black workers felt loyalty to Henry Ford because he had hired and paid them well at a time when other auto companies would not. Furthermore, many feared that Black workers were being asked to risk their jobs but would be &quot;pushed aside and ignored&quot; once the union had secured their votes. It took four years of organizing efforts for the UAW to win the right to represent Ford employees. On May 21, 1941, following a strike at Ford&#x27;s Rouge plant, a decisive majority of employees, including most Black employees, voted to join the UAW. The UAW extracted a better deal from Ford than from other automakers, including pay increases, a closed shop, and rehiring of pro-union workers. The agreement also included a non-discrimination clause drafted by Shelton Tappes, a Black foundryman who had served on the UAW negotiating team.

Communists provided many of the organizers and led some key union locals, especially Local 600 which represented the largest Ford plants. The Communist faction had some key positions in the union, including the directorship of the Washington office, the research department, and the legal office. Walter Reuther at times cooperated closely with the Communists, but he and his allies formed strategically an anticommunist current within the UAW. The UAW discovered that it had to be able to uphold its side of a bargain if it was to be a successful bargaining agency with a corporation, which meant that wildcat strikes and disruptive behavior by union members had to be stopped by the union itself. According to one writer, many UAW members were extreme individualists who did not like being bossed around by company foremen or by union agents. Leaders of the UAW realized that they had to control the shop floor, as Reuther explained in 1939: &quot;We must demonstrate that we are a disciplined, responsible organization; we not only have power, but that we have power under control.&quot;.

===World War II===
World War II dramatically changed the nature of the UAW&#x27;s organizing. The UAW&#x27;s executive board voted to make a &quot;no strike&quot; pledge to ensure that the war effort would not be hindered by strikes. A vehement minority opposed the decision, but the pledge was later reaffirmed by the membership. As war production ramped up and auto factories converted to tank building, the UAW organized new locals in these factories and airplane manufacturers across the country and hit a peak membership of over a million members in 1944. That same year, Lillian Hatcher was appointed the first Black female international representative of the UAW.

===Postwar===

The UAW struck GM for 113 days, beginning in November 1945, demanding a greater voice in management. GM would pay higher wages but refused to consider power sharing; the union finally settled with an eighteen-and-a-half-cent wage increase but little more. The UAW went along with GM in return for an ever-increasing packages of wage and benefit hikes through collective bargaining, with no help from the government.

===New leadership===
Walter Reuther won the election for president at the UAW&#x27;s constitutional convention in 1946 and served until his death in an airplane accident in May 1970. Reuther led the union during one of the most prosperous periods for workers in U.S. history. Immediately after the war, left-wing elements demanded &quot;30–40&quot;, which is a 30-hour week for 40 hours pay. Reuther rejected 30–40 and decided to concentrate on total annual wages, displaying a new corporatist mentality that accepted management&#x27;s argument that shorter hours conflicted with wage increases and other job benefits and abandoning the old confrontational syndicalist position that shorter hours drove up wages and protected against unemployment. The UAW delivered contracts for his membership through negotiation. Reuther would pick one of the Big Three automakers (General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler), and if it did not offer concessions, he would strike it and let the other two absorb its sales. Besides high hourly wage rates and paid vacations, in 1950, Reuther negotiated an industry first contract with General Motors known as Reuther&#x27;s Treaty of Detroit. The UAW negotiated employer-funded pensions at Chrysler, medical insurance at GM, and in 1955 supplementary unemployment benefits at Ford. Many smaller suppliers followed suit with benefits.

Reuther tried to negotiate lower automobile prices for the consumer with each contract, with limited success. An agreement on profit sharing with American Motors led nowhere, because profits were small at this minor player. The UAW expanded its scope to include workers in other major industries such as the aerospace and agricultural-implement industries.

The UAW disaffiliated from the AFL–CIO on July 1, 1968, after Reuther and AFL–CIO President George Meany could not come to agreement on a wide range of policy issues or reforms to AFL–CIO governance. On July 24, 1968, just days after the UAW disaffiliation, Teamsters General President Frank Fitzsimmons and Reuther formed the Alliance for Labor Action as a new national trade union center to organize unorganized workers and pursue leftist political and social projects. Meany denounced the ALA as a dual union, although Reuther argued it was not. The Alliance&#x27;s initial program was ambitious. Reuther&#x27;s death in a plane crash on May 9, 1970, near Black Lake, Michigan, dealt a serious blow to the Alliance, and the group halted operations in July 1971 after the Auto Workers (almost bankrupt from a lengthy strike at General Motors) was unable to continue to fund its operations.

In 1948, the UAW founded the radio station WDET 101.9 FM in Detroit. It was sold to Wayne State University for $1 in 1952.

===Politics and dissent===
The UAW leadership supported the programs of the New Deal Coalition, strongly supported civil rights, and strongly supported Lyndon Johnson&#x27;s Great Society. The UAW became strongly anti-communist after it expelled its Communist leaders in the late 1940s following the Taft–Hartley Act, and supported the Vietnam War and opposed the antiwar Democratic candidates.

According to political scientist Charles Williams, the UAW used the rhetoric of civic or liberal nationalism to fight for the rights of Black workers and other workers of color between the 1930s and 1970s. At the same time, it used this rhetoric to simultaneously rebuff the demands and limit the organizing efforts of Black workers seeking to overcome institutional racial hierarchies in the workplace, housing, and the UAW. The UAW leadership denounced these demands and efforts as antidemocratic and anti-American. Three examples, Williams argues, show how the UAW&#x27;s use of working class nationalism functioned as a counter subversive tradition within American liberalism: the UAW campaign at the Ford plant in Dearborn, Michigan, in the late 1930s, the 1942 conflict in Detroit over the black occupancy of the Sojourner Truth housing project, and the responses of the UAW under the conservative leadership of Reuther to the demands of Black workers for representation in UAW leadership between the mid-1940s and the 1960s. See also League of Revolutionary Black Workers and Dodge Revolutionary Union Movement for the history of Black workers who questioned the corrupt leadership of the UAW in the 1960s and the 1970s.

The UAW was the most instrumental outside financial and operational supporter of the first Earth Day in 1970. According to Denis Hayes, Earth Day&#x27;s first national coordinator, &quot;Without the UAW, the first Earth Day would have likely flopped!&quot;

===1970-2010===
With the 1973 oil embargo, rising fuel prices caused the U.S. auto makers to lose market share to foreign manufacturers who placed more emphasis on fuel efficiency. This started years of layoffs and wage reductions, and the UAW found itself in the position of giving up many of the benefits it had won for workers over the decades. By the early 1980s, auto producing states, especially in the Midwestern United States and Canada, had been impacted economically from losses in jobs and income. This peaked with the near-bankruptcy of Chrysler in 1979. In 1985 the union&#x27;s Canadian division disaffiliated from the UAW over a dispute regarding negotiation tactics and formed the Canadian Auto Workers as an independent union. Specifically the Canadian division claimed they were being used to pressure the companies for extra benefits, which went mostly to the American members.

The UAW saw a loss of membership after the 1970s. Membership topped 1.5 million in 1979, falling to 540,000 in 2006. With the late-2000s recession and automotive industry crisis of 2008–10, GM and Chrysler filed for Chapter 11 reorganization. Membership fell to 390,000 active members in 2010, with more than 600,000 retired members covered by pension and medical care plans.

===Early 21st century===
UAW has been credited for aiding in the auto industry rebound in the 21st century and blamed for seeking generous benefit packages in the past which in part led to the automotive industry crisis of 2008–10. UAW workers receiving generous benefit packages when compared with those working at non-union Japanese auto assembly plants in the U.S., had been cited as a primary reason for the cost differential before the 2009 restructuring. In a November 2008 &quot;New York Times&quot; editorial, Andrew Ross Sorkin claimed that the average UAW worker was paid $70 per hour, including health and pension costs, while Toyota workers in the US receive $10 to $20 less. The UAW asserts that most of this labor cost disparity comes from legacy pension and healthcare benefits to retired members, of which the Japanese automakers have none.

The Big Three already sold each of their cars for about $2,500 less than equivalent cars from Japanese companies, analysts at the International Motor Vehicle Program said. According to the 2007 GM Annual Report, typical autoworkers earned a base wage of approximately $28 per hour. Following the 2007 National Agreement, the base starting wage was lowered to about $15 per hour. A second-tier wage of $14.50 an hour, which applies only to newly hired workers, is lower than the average wage in non-union auto companies in the Deep South.

One of the benefits negotiated by the United Auto Workers was the former jobs bank program, under which laid-off members once received 95 percent of their take-home pay and benefits. More than 12,000 UAW members were paid this benefit in 2005. In December 2008, the UAW agreed to suspend the program as a concession to help U.S. automakers during the auto industry crisis.

UAW leadership granted concessions to its unions in order to win labor peace, a benefit not calculated by the UAW&#x27;s many critics. The UAW has claimed that the primary cause of the automotive sector&#x27;s weakness was substantially more expensive fuel costs linked to the 2003-2008 oil crisis which caused customers to turn away from large sport utility vehicles (SUVs) and pickup trucks, the main market of the American Big Three. In 2008, the situation became critical because the Great Recession significantly impaired the ability of consumers to purchase automobiles. The Big Three also based their respective market strategies on fuel-inefficient SUVs, and suffered from lower quality perception (vis-a-vis automobiles manufactured by Japanese or European car makers). Accordingly, the Big Three directed vehicle development focused on light trucks (which had better profit margins) in order to offset the considerably higher labor costs, falling considerably behind in the sedan market segments to Japanese and European automakers.

The UAW has tried to expand membership by organizing the employees outside of the Big Three. In 2010, Bob King hired Richard Bensinger to organize Japanese, Korean, and German transplant factories in the United States.

In a representational election following a majority of the workers signing cards asking for UAW representation, in February 2014 workers at Volkswagen&#x27;s Chattanooga, Tennessee plant narrowly voted down the union 712 to 626. However, the UAW organized a minority union Local 42, which was voluntary and does not collect dues. After the close vote against the UAW, Volkswagen announced a new policy allowing groups representing at least 15% of the workforce to participate in meetings, with higher access tiers for groups representing 30% and 45% of employees. This prompted anti-UAW workers who opposed the first vote to form a rival union, the American Council of Employees. In December 2014 the UAW was certified as representing more than 45% of employees.

The union engages in Michigan state politics. President King was a vocal opponent of the right-to-work legislation that passed over the objection of organized labor in December 2012. The UAW also remains a major player in the state Democratic Party.

In March 2020, the Detroit United Auto Workers union announced that after discussion with the leaders of General Motors, Ford, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, the carmakers would partially shut down factories on a &quot;rotating&quot; basis to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.

Though primarily known for autoworkers, academic staff comprised one quarter of UAW membership in 2022, and the 2022 University of California academic workers&#x27; strike achieved higher pay for that UAW affiliate.

===Corruption and reform===
A corruption probe by the Justice Department against UAW and 3 Fiat Chrysler executives was conducted during 2020 regarding several charges such as racketeering, embezzlement, and tax evasion. It resulted in convictions of 12 union officials and 3 Fiat Chrysler executives, including two former Union Presidents, UAW paying back over $15 million in improper chargebacks to worker training centers, payment of $1.5 million to the IRS to settle tax issues, commitment to independent oversight for six years, and a referendum that reformed the election mode for leadership. The &quot;One Member One Vote&quot; referendum vote in 2022 determined that UAW members could directly elect the members of the UAW International Executive Board (IEB), the highest ruling body of the UAW.

Shawn Fain was elected president in March 2023.

=== 2023 strike ===
A strike against all big three automakers began on September 15, 2023, for the first time in UAW history. After nearly a month and a half of strikes, UAW was able to reach an agreement with all three carmakers after securing record concessions from them. After the success of the strike, in November 2023, the UAW announced that it was launching a simultaneous campaign to unionize 150,000 workers at other automakers with plants in the United States: BMW, Honda, Hyundai, Lucid, Mazda, Mercedes, Nissan, Rivian, Subaru, Tesla, Toyota, Volkswagen, and Volvo. The UAW represented 145,000 at GM, Ford &amp; Stellantis.

In April 2024, after two failed attempts, 73% of workers at the Volkswagen (VW) Chattanooga, Tennessee plant voted to join the UAW, the union&#x27;s first victory in the South outside Detroit&#x27;s Big Three.

==Technical, Office, and Professional (TOP) workers==
District 65, a former affiliate of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union that included as a predecessor the United Office and Professional Workers of America, merged into the UAW in 1989.

In 2008, the 6,500 postdoctoral scholars (postdocs) at the ten campuses of the University of California, who, combined, account for 10% of the postdocs in the US, voted to affiliate with the UAW, creating the largest union for postdoctoral scholars in the country: UAW Local 5810. The expansion of UAW to academic circles, postdoctoral researchers in particular, was significant in that the move helped secure advances in pay that made unionized academic researchers among the best compensated in the country in addition to gaining unprecedented rights and protections.

<text>Samoset (also Somerset, – ) was an Abenaki sagamore and the first American Indian to make contact with the Pilgrims of Plymouth Colony in New England. He startled the colonists on March 16, 1621 by walking into Plymouth Colony and greeting them in English, saying &quot;Welcome, Englishmen.&quot;

==History==
Samoset was a sagamore, or subordinate chief, of an Eastern Abenaki tribe that resided in Maine. An English fishing camp had been established in the Gulf of Maine, where Samoset learned some English from fishermen who came to fish off Monhegan Island, coming to know most local ship captains by name.

The Abenaki language is an Algonquian language related to the Massachusett language of the Nauset and Wampanoag people of the area around Plymouth Colony, and Samoset was visiting Wampanoag chief Massasoit at the time of the historic event. He entered the settlement at Plymouth on March 16, 1621, greeted the colonists in English, and asked for beer. He spent the night with the Pilgrims on that occasion, then returned at another time with five other Indians who brought deer skins to trade. It was a Sunday and the colonists declined to trade that day, but they offered the men some food. Samoset came back on March 22, 1621 with Squanto, the last remaining member of the Patuxet tribe. Squanto spoke much better English than Samoset, and he arranged a meeting with Massasoit. 

In 1624, English Captain Christopher Levett entertained Samoset and other Indian leaders in the harbor of Portland, Maine. Samoset is believed to have died around 1653 in Pemaquid.

==Name==
The orthography of Samoset&#x27;s name varied depending on who was discussing him. He appeared as &quot;Samoset&quot; in some accounts and as &quot;Somerset&quot; in others. This is probably a folk etymology from Somerset in the West Country of England, home of many sailors.

== Meeting with colonists ==
&quot;Mourt&#x27;s Relation&quot;, a 1622 account of the early days of Plymouth Colony, describes Samoset&#x27;s visit:

Friday the 16th a fair warm day towards; this morning we determined to conclude of the military orders, which we had begun to consider of before but were interrupted by the savages, as we mentioned formerly; and whilst we were busied hereabout, we were interrupted again, for there presented himself a savage, which caused an alarm. He very boldly came all alone and along the houses straight to the rendezvous, where we intercepted him, not suffering him to go in, as undoubtedly he would, out of his boldness. He saluted us in English, and bade us welcome, for he had learned some broken English among the Englishmen that came to fish at Monchiggon, and knew by name most of the captains, commanders, and masters that usually come. He was a man free in speech, so far as he could express his mind, and of a seemly carriage. We questioned him of many things; he was the first savage we could meet withal. He said he was not of these parts, but of Morattiggon, and one of the sagamores or lords thereof, and had been eight months in these parts, it lying hence a day&#x27;s sail with a great wind, and five days by land. He discoursed of the whole country, and of every province, and of their sagamores, and their number of men, and strength. The wind being to rise a little, we cast a horseman&#x27;s coat about him, for he was stark naked, only a leather about his waist, with a fringe about a span long, or little more; he had a bow and two arrows, the one headed, and the other unheaded. He was a tall straight man, the hair of his head black, long behind, only short before, none on his face at all; he asked some beer, but we gave him strong water and biscuit, and butter, and cheese, and pudding, and a piece of mallard, all which he liked well, and had been acquainted with such amongst the English. He told us the place where we now live is called Patuxet, and that about four years ago all the inhabitants died of an extraordinary plague, and there is neither man, woman, nor child remaining, as indeed we have found none, so as there is none to hinder our possession, or to lay claim unto it. All the afternoon we spent in communication with him; we would gladly have been rid of him at night, but he was not willing to go this night. Then we thought to carry him on shipboard, wherewith he was well content, and went into the shallop, but the wind was high and the water scant, that it could not return back. We lodged him that night at Stephen Hopkins&#x27; house, and watched him.

The next day he went away back to the Massasoits, from whence he said he came, who are our next bordering neighbors. They are sixty strong, as he saith. The Nausets are as near southeast of them, and are a hundred strong, and those were they of whom our people were encountered, as before related. They are much incensed and provoked against the English, and about eight months ago slew three Englishmen, and two more hardly escaped by flight to Monchiggon; they were Sir Ferdinando Gorges his men, as this savage told us, as he did likewise of the huggery, that is, fight, that our discoverers had with the Nausets, and of our tools that were taken out of the woods, which we willed him should be brought again, otherwise, we would right ourselves. These people are ill affected towards the English, by reason of one Hunt, a master of a ship, who deceived the people, and got them under color of trucking with them, twenty out of this very place where we inhabit, and seven men from Nauset, and carried them away, and sold them for slaves like a wretched man (for twenty pound a man) that cares not what mischief he doth for his profit.

Saturday, in the morning we dismissed the savage, and gave him a knife, a bracelet, and a ring; he promised within a night or two to come again, and to bring with him some of the Massasoits, our neighbors, with such beavers&#x27; skins as they had to truck with us.
Other sources reiterate that Samoset asked the pilgrims for beer.

<text>Sir Ferdinando Gorges ( – 24 May 1647) was a naval and military commander and governor of the important port of Plymouth in England. He was involved in Essex&#x27;s Rebellion against the Queen, but escaped punishment by testifying against the main conspirators. His early involvement in English trade with and settlement of North America as well as his efforts in founding the Province of Maine in 1622 earned him the title of the &quot;Father of English Colonization in North America,&quot; even though Gorges himself never set foot in the New World.

==Origins==
Ferdinando Gorges was born between 1565 and 1568, probably in Clerkenwell, in Middlesex where the family maintained their London town house, but possibly at the family&#x27;s manor of Wraxall, in Somerset. He was the second son of Edward Gorges of Wraxall, by his wife Cicely Lygon. The circumstances of his father&#x27;s death aged 31 suggested to Baxter (Gorges&#x27;s first biographer) that Ferdinando was born at about the time of his father&#x27;s death on 29 August 1568. Edward Gorges, however, evidently realizing that his illness was fatal, prepared his will on 10 August 1568, (and proved on 17 September of the same year) in which Edward bequeathed to Ferdinando a 23-ounce gold watch and devised to him the manor of Birdcombe, Wraxall, for a term of 24 years. The terms of the testamentary gifts led an earlier memorialist to conclude that Ferdinando had been born sometime between 1565 and 1567.

===Ancestry===

Ferdinando Gorges was by blood in the male line a member of the Russell family of Kingston Russell, Dorset and of Dyrham in Gloucestershire, an early member of which was Sir John Russell (died c. 1224) of Kingston Russell, a household knight of King John (1199–1216), and of the young King Henry III (1216–1272), to whom he also acted as steward. However, the last male of the ancient Anglo-Norman Gorges family, about to die childless, bequeathed his estates, including Wraxall, to Theobald Russell, a younger son of his sister Eleanor Russell, on condition that he should adopt the name and arms of Gorges. Ferdinando was a descendant of this Theobald Russell &quot;Gorges&quot;.

The Gorges family arrived in England with the Norman Conquest. The male line of the Gorges family died out in 1331 on the death of Ralph de Gorges, 2nd Baron Gorges (d.1331), of Knighton, Isle of Wight. They were said to have lived in Somersetshire from the time of King Henry I and held their estates in Wraxall since the time of King Edward II. The Gorges were recipients of many royal appointments and privileges since Edward&#x27;s time.

Ferdinando&#x27;s great-great-grandfather married the eldest daughter of John Howard, 1st Duke of Norfolk, from which connection they claim royal descent. Ferdinando&#x27;s father Edward Gorges, as first born, became the heir of the family estate in Wraxal when his father died in 1558 when he was 21. Notwithstanding the family tradition in royal offices, neither Edward nor his father Edmund took part in public affairs (the early deaths of both of them may have been a partial explanation).

Ferdinando&#x27;s mother was Cecily Lygon, a daughter of William Lygon of Madresfield, Worcestershire (1512-1567), (whose ancestors&#x27; connection with the throne could be traced back to King Richard II), by his wife Eleanor Denys, a daughter of Sir William Denys (d.1533) of Dyrham, High Sheriff of Gloucestershire, whose family was the heir of the Russells of Dyrham, a descendant of which family in a direct male line was Ferdinando Gorges. Among their descendants were the Earls Beauchamp. Ferdinando Gorges was named after his mother&#x27;s brother, Ferdinando Lygon. After the death of Edward Gorges, Cecily married John Vivian of Brydges.

Ferdinando&#x27;s only sibling was his older brother Edward, who was baptised at Wraxall on 5 September 1564. Edward entered Hart Hall, Oxford, in 1582.

==Early life and education==
Very little documentation exists regarding his early life and education. He was brought up at Nailsea Court at Kenn near Wraxall. Although as far as is known Ferdinando had no direct connection with the Court in his youth, he could not have been impervious to two great cultural currents of the time: the growing resistance to the absolute power of the monarchy, particularly in ecclesiastical matter, sometimes subsumed under the concept of &quot;Puritanism&quot;, and the beginnings of English exploration and exploitation of the Western Hemisphere, the latter especially owing to his distant family connections with Humphrey Gilbert and his half-brother Walter Raleigh.

==Military career==
No documentary evidence records Gorges&#x27;s activities before 1587 (when he was around 20), but because in that year he is referred to as a captain, it is probable that he took up the profession of arms several years before then, perhaps in his mid-teens (not uncommon in England at the time). It is likely that he was engaged in active duty shortly after the outbreak of the Anglo-Spanish War in 1585. 

In 1587, he was one of the &quot;several eminent chieftains&quot; commanding the 800 soldiers sent from Flushing by Sir William Russell to aid the Earl of Leicester&#x27;s attempt to relieve the Siege of Sluis laid by the Spanish Governor General of the Netherlands, whose revolt against the Spanish Habsburg rule England had pledged to aid. Gorges fought under the command of Lord Willoughby, whose family he developed a close connection with. 

It is unknown whether he was captured during that engagement or later, but by September 1588 he was listed as among the prisoners at Lisle, for his name is among those English prisoners who friends in England petitioned to have Spanish prisoner exchanged for. In 1589 Gorges was wounded at the siege of Paris. He was knighted at the siege of Rouen in 1591. He was rewarded for his services by the post of Governor of the Fort at Plymouth, which he held for many years. 

During the Spanish Armada of 1597 Gorges was able to raise the alarm that enabled the defence of the country, but autumn storms made sure that the Spanish fleet was dispersed.

In 1601, he became involved in the Essex Conspiracy and later testified against its leader, Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex.

In 1633 he was Colonel of a regiment of Devon Trained Band Horse.

==Colonization efforts in North America==
With the end of the Anglo-Spanish War in 1604, there was a renewed interest in colonization projects from various ports, including Bristol, with which he was closely associated. Gorges&#x27; interest in colonization was said to have been stimulated when Captain George Weymouth presented him with three captured American Indians, who later learnt English and told him about their country. According to Gorges one of these captives was Tisquantum or &quot;Squanto&quot; of the Patuxet, but this claim has been disputed by historians.

In 1607, as a shareholder in the Plymouth Company, he helped fund the failed Popham Colony, in present-day Phippsburg, Maine.

In 1622, Gorges received a land patent, along with John Mason, from the crown&#x27;s Plymouth Council for New England for the Province of Maine, the original boundaries of which were between the Merrimack and Kennebec rivers. &quot;Ye Province of Maine&quot; had its birth in this charter, dated 10 August 1622, in the reign of England&#x27;s King James I. A reconfirmed and enhanced 1639 charter from England&#x27;s King Charles I, gave Sir Ferdinando Gorges increased powers over this new province and stated that it &quot;shall forever hereafter, be called and named the PROVINCE OR COUNTIE OF MAINE, and not by any other name or names whatsoever...&quot; 

In 1629, he and Mason divided the colony, with Mason&#x27;s portion south of the Piscataqua River becoming the Province of New Hampshire. Gorges and his nephew established Maine&#x27;s first court system. Capt. Christopher Levett, early English explorer of the New England coast, was an agent for Gorges, as well as a member for the Plymouth Council for New England. 
Levett&#x27;s attempt to establish a colony in Maine ultimately failed, and he died aboard ship returning to England after meeting with Governor John Winthrop in the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1630.

Gorges&#x27;s son was Robert Gorges, Governor-General of New England from 1623 to 1624. But Robert Gorges was seen with some suspicion by American colonists, who were sceptical of Gorges&#x27; almost feudal idea of governance and settlement, and ultimately Gorges returned to England. In the 1630s Ferdinando Gorges attempted to revive the moribund claims of the Plymouth Company. In concert with colonists banished from the Massachusetts Bay Colony, he formally questioned the issuance of its royal charter in 1632, and forwarded complaints and charges made by the disaffected colonists to the Privy Council of Charles I. His efforts were ultimately unsuccessful.

==Marriages and children==
He married four times:
*Firstly in 1589 at St. Margaret&#x27;s, Westminster to Ann Bell (d. 1620) who is buried at St Sepulchre Church, Holborn, London, a daughter of Edward Bell of Writtle, Essex, by whom he had two sons and two daughters:
**John Gorges;
**Robert Gorges;
**Ellen Gorges;
**Honoria Gorges, who died young. 
*Secondly in 1621, he married Mary Fulford, 3rd daughter of Sir Thomas Fulford (1553–1610) of Great Fulford in Devon, and widow of Thomas Achims (&quot;alias&quot; Asham) of Hall, in Cornwall. 
*Thirdly in 1627, at Ladock in Cornwall, to Elizabeth Gorges (d. 1629), who died a few weeks after the marriage, a daughter of Tristam Gorges of St. Budeaux (a direct descendant in the male line of the Norman Gorges family) and widow firstly of Edward Courteney (d.1622) of Landrake and of Trethurffe, Ladock, both in Cornwall (descended from the Courtenay Earls of Devon), and secondly of William Bligh.
*Fourthly, at Wraxall in 1629, to Elizabeth Gorges, Lady Smyth, widow of Sir Hugh Smyth of Ashton Court (near Wraxall) and daughter of Sir Thomas Gorges and Helena, Marchioness of Northampton.

==Death and succession==
Sir Ferdinando Gorges died on 24 May 1647, at his wife&#x27;s home in Long Ashton (then known as Ashton-Phillips), and is buried in the Smyth crypt, All Saint&#x27;s Church, Long Ashton, without markings due to the circumstances of the time. His eldest son, John, inherited his Province of Maine, of which Robert, his younger son, had been for such a short time Governor. In May 1677 his grandson Ferdinando Gorges finally sold all his rights to Maine for £1,250, to the state of Massachusetts.

The epilogue to Sir Ferdinando Gorges&#x27; story is very brief. Although his grandson eventually accepted a paltry sum after many years of trying to secure the good name of his grandfather, he proceeded to acquire some validity of his grandfather&#x27;s claims by the Puritans. This sale finally extinguished the interests of the Gorges family in those American lands which Sir Ferdinando had labored to develop as a proprietary province owing to a close relationship to the English Crown. New England was left to follow a very different destiny from that to which Sir Ferdinando had devoted so much of his life. It was not until 1820 that Maine achieved separate statehood.

<text>The willow ptarmigan ( ); Lagopus lagopus) is a bird in the grouse subfamily Tetraoninae of the pheasant family Phasianidae. It is also known as the willow grouse. The willow ptarmigan breeds in birch and other forests and moorlands in northern Europe, the tundra of Scandinavia, Siberia, Alaska and Canada, in particular in the provinces of Newfoundland and Labrador and Quebec. It is the state bird of Alaska.

In the summer the birds are largely brown, with dappled plumage, while in the winter they are white with some black feathers in their tails. The species has remained little changed from the bird that roamed the tundra during the Pleistocene. Nesting takes place in the spring when clutches of four to ten eggs are laid in a scrape on the ground. The chicks are precocial and soon leave the nest. While they are young, both parents play a part in caring for them. The chicks eat insects and young plant growth while the adults are completely herbivorous, eating leaves, flowers, buds, seeds and berries during the summer and largely subsisting on the buds and twigs of willow and other dwarf shrubs and trees during the winter.

==Taxonomy==
The willow ptarmigan was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Tetrao lagopus&quot;. He specified the type locality as &quot;Europae alpinis&quot; but this has been restricted to Sweden. The willow ptarmigan is now one of four species placed in the genus &quot;Lagopus&quot; that was introduced in 1760 by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson. The word &quot;lagopus&quot; is Latin for a ptarmigan. The word original came from Ancient Greek λαγωπους/&quot;lagōpous&quot; meaning &quot;hare-footed&quot;, from λαγως/&quot;lagōs&quot; meaning &quot;hare&quot; and πους/&quot;pous&quot;, ποδος/&quot;podos&quot; meaning &quot;foot&quot;.

The taxonomy is confused, partly because of the complicated changes in plumage several times a year and the differing color and pattern of the summer plumage:

Fifteen subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;L. l. variegata&quot; Salomonsen, 1936 – islets off west Norway
* &quot;L. l. lagopus&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758) – Scandinavia and north Russia
* &quot;L. l. rossica&quot; Serebrovski, 1926 – Baltic States to central Russia
* &quot;L. l. koreni&quot; Thayer &amp; Bangs, 1914 – Siberia to Kamchatka Peninsula
* &quot;L. l. maior&quot; Lorenz, T, 1904 – north Kazakhstan and southwest Siberia
* &quot;L. l. brevirostris&quot; Hesse, 1912 – east Kazakhstan to central south Siberia and west Mongolia
* &quot;L. l. kozlowae&quot; Portenko, 1931 – north Mongolia and south Siberia
* &quot;L. l. sserebrowsky&quot; Domaniewski, 1933 – northeast Mongolia to southeast Siberia and northeast China
* &quot;L. l. okadai&quot; Momiyama, 1928 – Sakhalin (Russia)
* &quot;L. l. alascensis&quot; Swarth, 1926 – Alaska (USA)
* &quot;L. l. alexandrae&quot; Grinnell, 1909 – Aleutian Islands, Kodiak Island, south, southeast Alaskan islands (USA) and northwest British Columbia (Canada)
* &quot;L. l. leucoptera&quot; Taverner, 1932 – northernmost Canada and its Arctic islands
* &quot;L. l. alba&quot; (Gmelin, JF, 1789) – north Canada
* &quot;L. l. ungavus&quot; Riley, 1911 – northeast Canada
* &quot;L. l. alleni&quot; Stejneger, 1884 – Newfoundland (Canada)

The willow ptarmigan often hybridises with the black grouse (&quot;Tetrao tetrix&quot;) and the hazel grouse (&quot;Tetrastes bonasia&quot;) and occasionally with the western capercaillie (&quot;Tetrao urogallus&quot;), the spruce grouse (&quot;Falcipennis canadensis&quot;) and the rock ptarmigan (&quot;Lagopus muta&quot;).

During the Pleistocene, the willow ptarmigan widely occurred in continental Europe. Authors who recognize paleosubspecies have named the Pleistocene willow ptarmigan &quot;L. l. noaillensis&quot; (though the older name &quot;medius&quot; might be the correct one). These marginally different birds are said to have gradually changed from the earlier (Pliocene) &quot;Lagopus atavus&quot; into the present-day species &quot;L. lagopus&quot;. Pleistocene willow ptarmigan are recorded from diverse sites until the end of the Vistulian glaciation about 10,000 years ago, when the species, by then all but identical with the living birds, retreated northwards with its tundra habitat. Additionally, mitochondrial DNA of the willow ptarmigan has been recovered from permafrost in the Yukon Territory.

==Description==
The willow ptarmigan is a medium to large ground-dwelling bird and is the most numerous of the three species of ptarmigan. Males and females are about the same size, the adult length varying between with a wingspan ranging from . The weight is . It is deep-chested and has a fairly long neck, a broad bill, short feathered legs and a moderately short rounded tail. In the summer, the male&#x27;s plumage is marbled brown, with a reddish hue to the neck and breast, a black tail and white wings and underparts. It has a red semicircular comb above each eye, which become red and prominent in the breeding season. The female is similar in appearance but with much smaller eye combs and has brown feathers scattered among the white feathers on her belly. During winter, the body plumage and two central tail feathers of both sexes becomes completely white, except for the black outer rectrices. Their wing feathers remain white all year round. Immature birds resemble the adults.
The willow ptarmigan can be distinguished from the closely related rock ptarmigan (&quot;Lagopus muta&quot;) by its larger size and thicker bill and by the fact that it is not generally found above the tree line while the rock ptarmigan prefers more elevated, barren habitat. The summer plumage is browner and in the winter, the male willow ptarmigan lacks the rock ptarmigan&#x27;s black stripe between the eyes and bill. The white-tailed ptarmigan (&quot;Lagopus leucura&quot;) in North America is smaller, has a white tail and finely-barred greyer plumage and lives permanently above the tree line. The distinctive red grouse of the British Isles was once considered to be a subspecies. This moorland bird is reddish brown all over, except for its white feet.

The voice is low-pitched and guttural and includes chuckles, repeated clucking sounds, and expostulations. When displaying, the male makes rattles and barking noises.


==Distribution and habitat==
The willow ptarmigan has a circum-boreal distribution. It is native to Canada and the United States, China, Mongolia, the Russian Federation, Kazakhstan, the Czech Republic, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Germany, the United Kingdom and Ireland. It primarily occupies subalpine and subarctic habitats such as sparse pine and birch forests, thickets with willow and alder trees, heather moors, tundra and mountain slopes. In the winter, females and sub-adults may move to lower altitudes and seek shelter in valleys or in more densely vegetated areas, but adult males usually remain in the subalpine region. The red grouse is common on heather-clad moorland across the north and west of Great Britain and in localised areas of Ireland.

==Diet==

The willow ptarmigan has a varied and seasonal diet. The bird is herbivorous for most of its life and subsists on various plant materials. As juveniles, they may feed on insects due to an inability to digest plant material caused by underdeveloped cecums. In the summer, their diet is highly varied and may consist of berries, flowers, leaves, twigs and seeds.

In Alaska, the main dietary item of the adults at all times of year is willows such as the Alaska willow &quot;Salix alaxensis&quot;, with leaves being eaten in summer and buds, twigs and catkins supplying the birds&#x27; main nutritional needs in winter and early spring. In the early twenty-first century, there has been an increase in shrub expansion in arctic Alaska that is thought to be greatly affecting the willow ptarmigan&#x27;s winter diet. Because of the way they browse, ptarmigan help shape the landscape of the area. After heavy snowfalls, the birds cannot access the shorter shrubs as they are blanketed with snow, so they will eat the taller species that poke through. In one study it was found that 90% of the buds of the Alaska willow within their reach had been browsed. This will stunt the willows and create a feedback cycle extending through the entire ecosystem. However, in winters with below average snowfall, the browsing of ptarmigans will not have such a drastic effect as their feeding will be spread out across a range of lower plant species. It is also believed that the greening of parts of the Arctic is affecting willow ptarmigan populations by altering the shape and size of the shrubs they are able to feed on.

== Behavior ==
Male willow ptarmigans are territorial birds. Males arrive in the breeding areas and set up territories in April and May, aggressively defending them against male interlopers. When the females arrive a few weeks later, the male performs courtship displays such as aerial manoeuvres, strutting and tail-fanning. When she has chosen a mate and a nesting site, the female lays a clutch of six to ten eggs in a shallow depression on the ground. The nest site is usually in a hidden location at the edge of a clearing.

A small minority of male willow ptarmigan are polygynous but most are monogamous. They are assiduous at guarding both nest and mate, particularly early in the incubation period and when the eggs are nearly ready to hatch. During this time, the greatest danger may be from conspecifics. Although adult willow ptarmigans are herbivores, the newly hatched young also feed on insects. In most other species of grouse, only the female takes care of the young, but the male willow ptarmigan also helps with feeding the brood and protecting them. He may take over completely if the female dies. In particular, the male defends the young from predators and both he and his mate can dive-bomb intruders or lure attackers away by pretending to have a broken wing. Nevertheless, the chicks face many dangers which range from attacks by foxes or birds of prey, to getting separated from the rest of the brood, bad weather, and coccidiosis. Fewer than 35% of chicks survive to eleven months and only a minority of these reach maturity. Despite this, in favourable seasons, many juveniles may survive and the population of willow ptarmigan is prone to wide fluctuations in size. By September, families begin to form flocks. The females and young migrate to lower altitudes and may overwinter from their breeding grounds in wooded valleys and hilly country. The males also congregate in small groups but do not usually travel as far as the females.

== Cold adaptations ==
The willow ptarmigan has several behavioral and physiological adaptations that help it survive the long Arctic winter, such as large pectoral muscles that aid in the process of shivering. Researchers have found that these pectoral muscles grow quickly during the first few days of the ptarmigan&#x27;s life, meaning that the ptarmigan chicks go from having no thermoregulatory ability at hatch to being able to maintain their normal body temperature for hours at 10 °C when they are two weeks old. The rapid increase in pectoralis size is caused by increases in muscle fiber diameters (hypertrophy), and cold exposure is not necessary for this muscle development to occur. Ptarmigan also have thick plumage with feather barbules that contain air-filled cavities, contributing to a low heat loss, which aids in thermoregulation while the bird is roosting in burrows in the snow. Ptarmigan can withstand the severe cold because the ambient temperature in the sheltered microclimate of their snow burrows typically exceeds their lower critical temperature.
==Status==
Widespread and not uncommon in its remote habitat, the willow ptarmigan is classified as a species of &quot;Least Concern&quot; by the IUCN. This is because, even if, as is suspected, numbers are declining slightly, it has a very wide range with a total population estimated at forty million individuals.

==Title bird==
The willow ptarmigan was adopted as the state bird of Alaska in 1955. It is also the regional bird of Southern Lapland.

<doc id="320155" wikidata="Q808974" url="?curid=320155" title="Barron v. Baltimore">
<text>Barron v. Baltimore, 32 U.S. (7 Pet.) 243 (1833), is a landmark United States Supreme Court case in 1833, which helped define the concept of federalism in US constitutional law. The Court ruled that the Bill of Rights did not apply to the state governments, establishing a precedent until the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Barron v Baltimore is also significant for highlighting the separation between federal government and state government.

== Background ==
The city of Baltimore, Maryland initiated a public works project that involved the modification of several streams that emptied into Baltimore Harbor. City construction resulted in large amounts of sediment being deposited into the streams, which then emptied into the harbor near a profitable wharf owned and operated by John Barron. The material settled into the water near the wharf, decreasing the depth of the water to a point where it was nearly impossible for ships to approach it. As it was no longer easily accessible for ships, the business&#x27;s profitability declined substantially. Barron sued the City of Baltimore for losses, arguing that he was deprived of his property without the due process afforded him by the Fifth Amendment. Barron was awarded $4,500 in compensation by the trial court, but a Maryland appellate court reversed the decision.

== Decision ==
The Supreme Court heard arguments on the case on February 8 and 11 and decided on February 16, 1833. It held that the Bill of Rights, such as the Fifth Amendment&#x27;s guarantee of just compensation for takings of private property for public use, are restrictions on the federal government alone. Writing for a unanimous court, Chief Justice John Marshall held that the first ten &quot;amendments contain no expression indicating an intention to apply them to the State governments. This court cannot so apply them.&quot;

To demonstrate that Constitutional limits did not apply to states unless expressly stated, Marshall used the example of Article I, Sections 9 and 10:
==Aftermath==
The case was particularly important in terms of American government because it stated that the Bill of Rights did not restrict the state governments.

The decision was initially ignored by the growing abolitionist movement, some of whom maintained that Congress could constitutionally abolish slavery, under the Bill of Rights. The case was largely unknown in the 1860s; during a debate in Congress on the Fourteenth Amendment, Congressman John Bingham had to read part of Marshall&#x27;s opinion aloud to the Senate.

Later Supreme Court rulings would return to &quot;Barron&quot; to reaffirm its central holding, most notably in &quot;United States v. Cruikshank&quot;, 92 U.S. 542 (1876). However, since the early 20th century, the Supreme Court has used the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which was interpreted to have the same meaning as the Fifth Amendment, to apply most of the Bill of Rights to the states by selective incorporation. Therefore, as to most of the Bill of Rights, &quot;Barron&quot; and its progeny have been circumvented, if not actually overruled.

Barron v. Baltimore clarified federalism and highlighted the need for constitutional protections, which helped allow for the Fourteenth Amendment to extend the Bill of Rights to the states.

<text>Arthur Robert Ashe Jr. (July 10, 1943 – February 6, 1993) was an American professional tennis player. He won three Grand Slam titles in singles and two in doubles. Ashe was the first Black player selected to the United States Davis Cup team, and the only Black man ever to win the singles titles at Wimbledon, the US Open, and the Australian Open. He retired in 1980.

Ashe was ranked world No. 1 by Rex Bellamy, Bud Collins, Judith Elian, Lance Tingay, &quot;World Tennis&quot; and &quot;Tennis Magazine&quot; (U.S.) in 1975. That year, Ashe was awarded the &#x27;Martini and Rossi&#x27; Award, voted for by a panel of journalists, and the ATP Player of the Year award. In the ATP computer rankings, he peaked at world No. 2 in May 1976.

Ashe is believed to have acquired HIV from a blood transfusion he received during heart bypass surgery in 1983. He publicly announced his illness in April 1992, and began working to educate others about HIV and AIDS. He founded the Arthur Ashe Foundation for the Defeat of AIDS and the Arthur Ashe Institute for Urban Health before his death from AIDS-related pneumonia at the age of 49 on February 6, 1993. On June 20, 1993, he was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by United States President Bill Clinton. The Arthur Ashe Stadium, the main court for the US Open and the largest tennis arena in the world, is named in his honor.
==Early life, education, and early tennis experience==
Arthur Ashe was born in Richmond, Virginia, to Arthur Ashe Sr. (d. 1989) and Mattie Cordell Cunningham Ashe on July 10, 1943. He had a brother, Johnnie, who was five years younger than him. The brothers were born into a family that claimed direct descent from Amar, a West African woman who was enslaved and brought to America in 1735 aboard a ship called &quot;The Doddington&quot;. Ashe family members were enslaved by North Carolina Governor Samuel Ashe.

In March 1950, Ashe&#x27;s mother, Mattie, died from complications related to a toxemic pregnancy (now known as pre-eclampsia) at the age of 27, when Ashe was 6. Ashe and his brother were raised by their father, who worked as a handyman and salaried caretaker/Special Policeman for Richmond&#x27;s recreation department.

Ashe Sr. was a caring father and strict disciplinarian who encouraged Ashe to excel both in school and in sports, but forbade him to play American football, a popular game for many boys, due to his son&#x27;s slight build, something that meant Arthur&#x27;s childhood nicknames were &quot;Skinny&quot; and &quot;Bones&quot;. The Ashes lived in the caretaker&#x27;s cottage in the grounds of 18-acre Brookfield park, Richmond&#x27;s largest blacks-only public playground, which had basketball courts, four tennis courts, a pool, and three baseball diamonds. Ashe started playing tennis at seven years of age and began practicing on the courts where his natural talent was spotted by Virginia Union University student and part-time Brookfield tennis instructor Ron Charity, who as the best black tennis player in Richmond at the time began to teach Ashe the basic strokes and encouraged him to enter local tournaments.

Ashe attended Maggie L. Walker High School in Richmond, Virginia, where he continued to practice tennis. Ron Charity brought him to the attention of Robert Walter Johnson, a physician, and the coach of Althea Gibson, who founded and funded the Junior Development Program of the American Tennis Association (ATA). Ashe was coached and mentored by Johnson at his tennis summer-camp home in Lynchburg, Virginia, from 1953 when Ashe was aged 10, until 1960. Johnson helped fine-tune Ashe&#x27;s game and taught him the importance of racial socialization through sportsmanship, etiquette, and the composure that would later become an Ashe hallmark. He was told to return every ball that landed within two inches of a line and never to argue with an umpire&#x27;s decision. In 1958, Ashe became the first African American to play in the Maryland boys&#x27; championships. It was also his first integrated tennis competition.

In 1960, Ashe was precluded from competing against White youths in segregated Richmond during the school year, and unable to use the city&#x27;s indoor courts that were closed to Black players. He accepted an offer from Richard Hudlin, a 62-year-old St. Louis teacher, tennis coach, and friend of Johnson, to move to St. Louis and spend his senior year attending Sumner High School, where he could compete more freely. Ashe lived with Hudlin and his family for the year, during which time Hudlin coached and encouraged him to develop the serve-and-volley game that Ashe&#x27;s now-stronger physique allowed. Ashe was able to practice at the National Guard Armory indoor courts and in 1961, after lobbying by Johnson, was granted permission to compete in the previously segregated U.S. Interscholastic tournament and won it for the school.

In December 1960 and again in 1963, Ashe was featured in &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, appearing in their Faces in the Crowd segment. He became the first African American to win the National Junior Indoor tennis title.

== Higher education and military service ==
Ashe was awarded a tennis scholarship to the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in 1963. During his time at UCLA, he was coached by J. D. Morgan and practiced regularly with his sporting idol, Pancho Gonzales, who lived nearby and helped hone his game. Ashe was also a member of the ROTC, which required him to enter active military service after graduation in exchange for money for tuition. He was active in other organizations, later pledging the Upsilon chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity and becoming a member/brother of the fraternity.

After graduating with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Business Administration, Ashe joined the United States Army on August 4, 1966. He completed his basic training in Washington and was later commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Adjutant General Corps. He was assigned to the United States Military Academy at West Point where he worked as a data processor. During his time at West Point, Ashe headed the academy&#x27;s tennis program. He was promoted to 1st Lieutenant on February 23, 1968, and was honorably discharged from the Army on February 22, 1969, as a 1st Lieutenant. He was awarded the National Defense Service Medal for his service.

==Tennis career==
===1960s===
In 1961, Ashe won the Eastern Clay Court Championships defeating George Ball and Bob Barker in close five set matches in the semifinal and final.

In 1963, Ashe won the Pacific Southwest Championships in Los Angeles on concrete defeating Rafael Osuna and Whitney Reed in the final two rounds. The following season he won the 1964 Eastern Grass Court Championships at South Orange, New Jersey defeating Dennis Ralston, Gene Scott, and Clark Graebner in close matches.

In 1963, Ashe became the first black player ever selected for the United States Davis Cup team. In 1965, ranked the number 3 player in the United States, Ashe won both the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) singles title and the doubles title (with Ian Crookenden of New Zealand), helping UCLA win the NCAA team tennis championship.

In 1966 and 1967, Ashe reached the final of the Australian Championship but lost on both occasions to Roy Emerson. He won the 1967 U.S. Men&#x27;s Clay Court Championships in Milwaukee defeating Marty Riessen in the final.

In 1968, Ashe won the United States Amateur Championships against Davis Cup teammate Bob Lutz, and the first US Open of the open era, becoming the first black male to capture the title and the only player to have won both the amateur and open national championships in the same year.

In order to maintain Davis Cup eligibility and have time away from army duty for important tournaments, Ashe was required to maintain his amateur status. Because of this, he could not accept the $14,000 first-prize money, which was instead given to runner-up Tom Okker, while Ashe received just $20 daily expenses for his historic triumph. His ability to compete in the championship (and avoid the Vietnam War) arose from his brother Johnnie&#x27;s decision to serve an additional tour in Vietnam in Arthur&#x27;s place.

In December 1968, Ashe helped the U.S. team become Davis Cup champions after victory in the final in Adelaide against defending champions, Australia. His only loss in the 12 Davis Cup tournament singles matches he played that year, was in the last dead rubber game after the U.S. team had already clinched victory. The season closed with Ashe the winner of 10 of 22 tournaments with a 72–10 win-loss match record.

In September 1969, the U.S. Davis Cup team retained the cup, beating Romania in the final challenge round, with Ashe winning both his singles matches. The same year, Ashe applied for a visa to play in the South African Open but was denied the visa by the South African government who enforced a strict apartheid policy of racial segregation.

He continued to apply for visas in the following years and the country continued to deny him one. In protest, he used this example of discrimination to campaign for U.S. sanctions against South Africa and the expulsion of the nation from the International Lawn Tennis Federation (ILTF) but, in defense of the individual South African players, refused the call from activists to forfeit matches against them.

===1970s===
In January 1970, Ashe won his second Grand Slam singles title at the Australian Open. With the competition somewhat depleted by the absence of some world-class National Tennis League (NTL) professional players barred by their league from entering because the financial guarantees were deemed too low, Ashe defeated Dick Crealy in straight sets in the final to become the first non-Australian to win the title since 1959.

In March 1970, triggered by South Africa&#x27;s refusal to grant Ashe a visa to play there, the country was expelled from the Davis Cup competition for its racial policy. In September 1970, Ashe helped the U.S. Davis cup team defeat West Germany in the challenge round to win their third consecutive Davis Cup. Ashe then turned professional, signing a five-year contract with Lamar Hunt&#x27;s World Championship Tennis.

In March 1971, Ashe reached the final of the Australian Open again but lost in straight sets to Ken Rosewall. In June that year, Ashe won the French Open men&#x27;s doubles with partner Marty Riessen.

In 1972, due to a dispute between the ILTF and the WCT, Ashe, as one of the 32 contracted WCT players, was barred from taking part in any ILTF Grand Prix tennis circuit tournaments from January to July. This ban meant Ashe was unable to play at the French Open and Wimbledon Grand Slam tournaments.

In September, Ashe reached the final of the US Open for the second time. After leading his opponent, Ilie Năstase by 2 sets to 1 and with a break point to take a 4–1 lead in the fourth set, he eventually lost in five sets. The loss from such a winning position was the biggest disappointment of Ashe&#x27;s professional tennis career. At the post-match award ceremony, irritated by some of Năstase&#x27;s on-court antics during the game, Ashe praised Năstase as a tough opponent and &#x27;colourful&#x27; player, then suggested, &quot;... and when he brushes up on some of his court manners, he is going to be even better&quot;.

At this tournament, concerned that men&#x27;s tennis professionals were not receiving winnings commensurate with the sport&#x27;s growing popularity and to protect players from promoters and associations, Ashe supported the founding of the Association of Tennis Professionals. He went on to become its elected president in 1974.

In June 1973, as a result of an ATP boycott, Ashe was one of 13 seeded players and 81 players in total who withdrew from the Wimbledon tournament to much public criticism. The catalyst for the boycott was that Yugoslavian ATP member Niki Pilić had been suspended for nine months by his tennis federation after allegedly refusing to represent them in a Davis Cup tie against New Zealand in May, something Pilić denied.

The ban was upheld by the ILTF though they reduced it to just one month. The ATP contested the ban but lost a lawsuit to force Pilić&#x27;s participation at Wimbledon during the ban period. As a member of the ATP board, Ashe voted to boycott the tournament, a vote that was only narrowly passed when ATP chairman, Cliff Drysdale abstained. Commentators considered that the boycott demonstrated the power of the fledgling ATP, and showed the tennis associations that professional players could no longer be dictated to.

In November 1973, with the South African government seeking to end their Olympic ban and re-join the Olympic movement, Ashe was finally granted a visa to enter the country for the first time, to play in the South African Open. He lost in the final to Jimmy Connors, but won the doubles with partner Tom Okker.

Despite boycotts against South African sport, Ashe believed that his presence could help break down stereotypes and that by competing and winning the tournament, it would stand as an example of the result of integration, and help bring about change in apartheid South Africa. He reached the singles final again in 1974, losing in straight sets to Connors for the second consecutive year.

In 1977, Ashe addressed a small crowd of boycott supporters at the U.S. Open and admitted that he had been wrong to participate in South Africa and once again supported the boycott of South African players after he had tried to purchase tickets for some young Africans for a tennis match in South Africa, and was told to use an &quot;Africans only&quot; counter. In the media, Ashe called for South Africa to be expelled from the professional tennis circuit and Davis Cup competition.

In May 1975, Ashe beat Björn Borg to win the season-ending championship WCT Finals in Dallas. On July 5, 1975, in the first all-American Wimbledon final since 1947, Ashe, seeded sixth and just a few days short of his 32nd birthday, won Wimbledon at his ninth attempt, defeating the overwhelming favorite and defending champion, Jimmy Connors.

Ashe had never beaten Connors in any of their previous encounters and Connors had not dropped a set in any of the six earlier rounds, but Ashe played an almost perfect game of tactical tennis to win in four sets. In the lead-up to the final, the two players&#x27; relationship was already strained. Connors was suing the ATP, with Ashe as its president, for $10 million for alleged restraint of trade after opposition from the ATP and French officials meant he was refused entry to the 1974 French Open as a contracted member of World Team Tennis (WTT).

Just two days before the start of the Wimbledon tournament, it had been announced that Connors was now suing Ashe for $5 million for comments in a letter Ashe had written to ATP members in his role as president, criticizing Connors&#x27; insistence that Davis Cup captain Dennis Ralston should be fired and Connors&#x27; &quot;unpatriotic&quot; boycott of the competition which had started after Ralston left him out of the team against the West Indies in Jamaica in March 1972.

On the final day, Ashe pointedly and symbolically wore red, white and blue wristbands throughout the match and wore his U.S.-emblazoned Davis Cup warm-up jacket when walking out onto Centre Court and during the award ceremony while receiving the trophy and winner&#x27;s cheque for GBP £10,000 (1975 equivalent US$23,000). Soon after the final, Connors dropped the libel suit.

Ashe played for a few more years and won the Australian Open doubles with Tony Roche in January 1977, but a left foot heel injury requiring surgery a month later and subsequent long-term rehabilitation saw his world ranking drop to a lowly 257th before a remarkable comeback saw him rise back to 13th in the world again the following year at the age of 35. However, after undergoing heart surgery in December 1979, Ashe officially retired on April 16, 1980, at the age of 36. His career record was 818 wins, 260 losses, and 51 titles.

== Post-tennis career and activism ==

After his retirement, Ashe took on many roles, including writing for &quot;Time&quot; magazine and &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, commentating for ABC Sports and HBO from the early 1980s until a few months before his death, founding the National Junior Tennis League, and serving as captain of the U.S. Davis Cup team from 1981 to 1985. He was elected to the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1985.

Ashe was an active civil rights supporter. In 1982, he joined with Harry Belafonte to form the group Artists and Athletes Against Apartheid, which called for a cultural boycott of South Africa. Ashe was arrested on January 11, 1985, for protesting outside the Embassy of South Africa, Washington, D.C., during an anti-apartheid rally. Six year later, he joined musician and producer Quincy Jones as part of a delegation of 31 prominent African Americans who visited South Africa in 1991 to observe political change in the country as it approached racial integration. He was arrested again on September 18, 1992, outside the White House for protesting with TransAfrica on the recent crackdown on Haitian refugees.

In 1988, Ashe published a three-volume book titled &quot;A Hard Road to Glory: A History of the African-American Athlete&quot;, after working with a team of researchers for nearly six years. Ashe stated that the book was more important than any tennis titles.

After Ashe publicly acknowledged that he had contracted HIV, he founded the Arthur Ashe Foundation for the Defeat of AIDS, working to raise awareness about the virus and advocated teaching sex education and safe sex. He also fielded questions about his own diagnosis and attempted to clear up the misconception that only homosexual and bisexual men or IV drug users were at risk for contracting HIV. In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly on World AIDS Day, December 1, 1992, he addressed the growing need for AIDS awareness and increased research funding, saying: &quot;We want to be able to look back and say to all concerned that we did what we had to do, when we had to do it, and with all the resources required.&quot;

Two months before his death, he founded the Arthur Ashe Institute for Urban Health to help address issues of inadequate health care delivery and was named &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; magazine&#x27;s Sportsman of the Year. He also spent much of the last years of his life writing his memoir, &quot;Days of Grace&quot;, finishing the manuscript less than a week before his death.

== Personal life ==
In October 1976, Ashe met photographer and graphic artist Jeanne Moutoussamy at a United Negro College Fund benefit. Moutoussamy, who is of Afro-Guadeloupean and African-American heritage, is the daughter of architect John Moutoussamy. On February 20, 1977, they were married in the Church Center for the United Nations in New York City in a ceremony officiated by Andrew Young, the United States Ambassador to the United Nations.

In December 1986, Ashe and Moutoussamy adopted a daughter. They named their daughter Camera, after her mother&#x27;s professional instrument.

=== Health ===
In July 1979, at the age of 36, Ashe suffered a heart attack while holding a tennis clinic in New York. In view of his high level of fitness as an athlete, his condition drew attention to the hereditary aspect of heart disease; his mother already had cardiovascular disease at the time of her death at age 27, and his father had suffered his first heart attack at age 55, and a second, at age 59, just a week before Ashe&#x27;s own attack. Cardiac catheterization revealed one of Ashe&#x27;s arteries was completely closed, another was 95 percent closed, and a third was closed 50 percent in two places. He underwent a quadruple bypass operation performed by John Hutchinson on December 13, 1979.

A few months after the operation, Ashe was on the verge of making his return to professional tennis. However, during a family trip in Cairo, Egypt, he developed chest pains while running. He stopped running and returned to see a physician accompanied by his close friend Douglas Stein. Stein urged him to return to New York City so he could be close to his cardiologist, his surgeon and top-class medical facilities. In 1983, he underwent a second round of heart surgery to correct the previous bypass surgery. After the surgery, Ashe became national campaign chairman for the American Heart Association.

In September 1988, Ashe was hospitalized after experiencing paralysis in his right arm. After undergoing exploratory brain surgery and a number of tests, doctors discovered that he had toxoplasmosis, a parasitic disease that is commonly found in people infected with HIV. A subsequent test later revealed that he was HIV-positive. Ashe and his doctors believed he contracted the virus from blood transfusions he received during his second heart surgery. He and his wife decided to keep his illness private for the sake of their daughter, who was then two years old.

In September 1992, Ashe suffered a mild heart attack.

In 1992, a friend of Ashe who worked for &quot;USA Today&quot; heard that he was ill and called him to confirm the story. Ashe decided to preempt &quot;USA Today&quot;″s plans to publish the story about his illness and, on April 8, 1992, publicly announced he had contracted HIV. He blamed &quot;USA Today&quot; for forcing him to go public with the news but also stated that he was relieved that he no longer had to lie about his illness. After the announcement, hundreds of readers called or wrote letters to &quot;USA Today&quot; criticizing their choice to run the story about Ashe that forced him to publicize his illness.

===Death===
On February 6, 1993, Ashe died from AIDS-related pneumonia at New York Hospital at 3:13 p.m., at age 49. His funeral was held at the Arthur Ashe Athletic Center in Richmond, Virginia, on February 10. Governor Douglas Wilder, who was a friend of Ashe&#x27;s, allowed his body to lie in state at the Governor&#x27;s Mansion in Richmond. More than 5,000 people lined up to walk past the casket. Andrew Young, who had performed the service for Ashe&#x27;s wedding in 1977, officiated at his funeral. Over 6,000 mourners attended. Ashe requested that he be buried alongside his mother in Woodland Cemetery in Richmond, Virginia.

On February 12, 1993, a memorial service for Ashe was held at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in Manhattan.

== Legacy ==
Ashe remains the only Black man to win the singles title at Wimbledon, the US Open, or Australian Open. He is one of only two men of black African ancestry to win any Grand Slam singles title, the other being France&#x27;s Yannick Noah, who won the French Open in 1983. He also led the United States to victory for three consecutive years (1968–70) in the Davis Cup.

In his 1979 autobiography, Jack Kramer, the long-time tennis promoter and a world no. 1 player himself in the 1940s, ranked Ashe as one of the 21 best players of all time.

<text>The grey reef shark or gray reef shark (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos, sometimes misspelled &quot;amblyrhynchus&quot; or &quot;amblyrhinchos&quot;) is a species of requiem shark, in the family Carcharhinidae. One of the most common reef sharks in the Indo-Pacific, it is found as far east as Easter Island and as far west as South Africa. This species is most often seen in shallow water near the drop-offs of coral reefs. It has the typical &quot;reef shark&quot; shape, with a broad, round snout and large eyes. It can be distinguished from similar species by the plain or white-tipped first dorsal fin, the dark tips on the other fins, the broad, black rear margin on the tail fin, and the lack of a ridge between the dorsal fins. Most individuals are less than long.

The grey reef shark is a fast-swimming, agile predator that feeds primarily on free-swimming bony fishes and cephalopods. Its aggressive demeanor enables it to dominate many other shark species on the reef, despite its moderate size. Many grey reef sharks have a home range on a specific area of the reef, to which they continually return. However, they are social rather than territorial. During the day, these sharks often form groups of five to 20 individuals near coral reef drop-offs, splitting up in the evening as the sharks begin to hunt. Adult females also form groups in very shallow water, where the higher water temperature may accelerate their growth or that of their unborn young. Like other members of its family, the grey reef shark is viviparous, meaning the mother nourishes her embryos through a placental connection. Litters of one to six pups are born every other year.

The grey reef shark was the first shark species known to perform a threat display, a stereotypical behavior warning that it is prepared to attack. The display involves a &quot;hunched&quot; posture with characteristically dropped pectoral fins, and an exaggerated, side-to-side swimming motion. Grey reef sharks often do so if they are followed or cornered by divers to indicate they perceive a threat. This species has been responsible for a number of attacks on humans, and should be treated with caution, especially if it begins to display. It has been caught in many fisheries and is susceptible to local population depletion due to its low reproduction rate and limited dispersal. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed this species as endangered.

==Taxonomy and phylogeny==
Dutch ichthyologist Pieter Bleeker first described the grey reef shark in 1856 as &quot;Carcharias (Prionodon) amblyrhynchos&quot;, in the scientific journal &quot;Natuurkundig Tijdschrift voor Nederlandsch-Indië&quot;. Later authors moved this species to the genus &quot;Carcharhinus&quot;. The type specimen was a -long female from the Java Sea. Other common names used for this shark around the world include black-vee whaler, bronze whaler, Fowler&#x27;s whaler shark, graceful shark, graceful whaler shark, grey shark, grey whaler shark, longnose blacktail shark, school shark, and shortnose blacktail shark. Some of these names are also applied to other species.

In older literature, the scientific name of this species was often given as &quot;C. menisorrah&quot;. The blacktail reef shark (&quot;C. wheeleri&quot;), native to the western Indian Ocean, is now regarded as the same species as the grey reef shark by most authors. It was originally distinguished from the grey reef shark by a white tip on the first dorsal fin, a shorter snout, and one fewer upper tooth row on each side. Based on morphological characters, vertebral counts, and tooth shapes, Garrick (1982) concluded the grey reef shark is most closely related to the silvertip shark (&quot;C. albimarginatus&quot;). This interpretation was supported by a 1992 allozyme phylogenetic analysis by Lavery.

==Description==
The grey reef shark has a streamlined, moderately stout body with a long, blunt snout and large, round eyes. The upper and lower jaws each have 13 or 14 teeth (usually 14 in the upper and 13 in the lower). The upper teeth are triangular with slanted cusps, while the bottom teeth have narrower, erect cusps. The tooth serrations are larger in the upper jaw than in the lower. The first dorsal fin is medium-sized, and no ridge runs between the second dorsal fin and it. The pectoral fins are narrow and falcate (sickle-shaped).

The coloration is grey above, sometimes with a bronze sheen, and white below. The entire rear margin of the caudal fin has a distinctive, broad, black band. Dusky to black tips are on the pectoral, pelvic, second dorsal, and anal fins. Individuals from the western Indian Ocean have a narrow, white margin at the tip of the first dorsal fin; this trait is usually absent from Pacific populations. Grey reef sharks that spend time in shallow water eventually darken in color, due to tanning. Most grey reef sharks are less than long. The maximum reported length is and the maximum reported weight is .

==Distribution and habitat==

The grey reef shark is native to the Indian and Pacific Oceans. In the Indian Ocean, it occurs from South Africa to India, including Madagascar and nearby islands, the Red Sea, and the Maldives. In the Pacific Ocean, it is found from Southern China to northern Australia and New Zealand, including the Gulf of Thailand, the Philippines, and Indonesia. This species has also been reported from numerous Pacific islands, including American Samoa, the Chagos Archipelago, Easter Island, Christmas Island, the Cook Islands, the Marquesas Islands, the Tuamotu Archipelago, Guam, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, New Caledonia, the Marianas Islands, Palau, the Pitcairn Islands, Samoa, the Solomon Islands, Tuvalu, the Hawaiian Islands, and Vanuatu.

Generally a coastal, shallow-water species, grey reef sharks are mostly found in depths less than . However, they have been known to dive to . They are found over continental and insular shelves, preferring the leeward (away from the direction of the current) sides of coral reefs with clear water and rugged topography. They are frequently found near the drop-offs at the outer edges of the reef, particularly near reef channels with strong currents, and less commonly within lagoons. On occasion, this shark may venture several kilometers out into the open ocean.

==Biology and ecology==

Along with the blacktip reef shark (&quot;C. melanopterus&quot;) and the whitetip reef shark (&quot;Triaenodon obesus&quot;), the grey reef shark is one of the three most common sharks inhabiting Indo-Pacific reefs. They actively expel most other shark species from favored habitats, even species larger in size. In areas where this species co-exists with the blacktip reef shark, the latter species occupies the shallow flats, while the former stays in deeper water. Areas with a high abundance of grey reef sharks tend to contain few sandbar sharks (&quot;C. plumbeus&quot;), and &quot;vice versa&quot;; this may be due to their similar diets causing competitive exclusion. The consumptive influence of grey reef sharks on reef fish communities is likely to vary depending on whether sharks forage within the reef environment, or on pelagic resources (like they have been observed to do at Palmyra Atoll).

On the infrequent occasions when they swim in oceanic waters, grey reef sharks often associate with marine mammals or large pelagic fishes, such as sailfish (&quot;Istiophorus platypterus&quot;). One account has around 25 grey reef sharks following a large pod of bottlenose dolphins (&quot;Tursiops&quot; sp.), along with 25 silky sharks (&quot;C. falciformis&quot;) and a single silvertip shark. Rainbow runners (&quot;Elagatis bipinnulata&quot;) have been observed rubbing against grey reef sharks, using the sharks&#x27; rough skin to scrape off parasites.

Grey reef sharks are themselves prey for larger sharks, such as the silvertip shark. At Rangiroa Atoll in French Polynesia, great hammerheads (&quot;Sphyrna mokarran&quot;) feed opportunistically on grey reef sharks that are exhausted from pursuing mates. Known parasites of this species include the nematode &quot;Huffmanela lata&quot; and several copepod species that attach to the sharks&#x27; skin, and juvenile stages of the isopods &quot;Gnathia trimaculata&quot; and &quot;G. grandilaris&quot; that attach to the gill filaments and septa (the dividers between each gill).

===Feeding===

Grey reef sharks feed mainly on bony fishes, with cephalopods such as squid and octopus being the second-most important food group, and crustaceans such as crabs and lobsters making up the remainder. The larger sharks take a greater proportion of cephalopods. These sharks hunt individually or in groups, and have been known to pin schools of fish against the outer walls of coral reefs for feeding. Hunting groups of up to 700 grey reef sharks have been observed at Fakarava atoll in French Polynesia. They excel at capturing fish swimming in the open, and they complement hunting whitetip reef sharks, which are more adept at capturing fish inside caves and crevices. Their sense of smell is extremely acute, being capable of detecting one part tuna extract in 10 billion parts of sea water. In the presence of a large quantity of food, grey reef sharks may be roused into a feeding frenzy; in one documented frenzy caused by an underwater explosion that killed several snappers, one of the sharks involved was attacked and consumed by the others.

===Life history===
During mating, the male grey reef shark bites at the female&#x27;s body or fins to hold onto her for copulation. Like other requiem sharks, it is viviparous; once the developing embryos exhaust their supply of yolk, the yolk sac develops into a placental connection that sustains them to term. Each female has a single functional ovary (on the right side) and two functional uteri. One to four pups (six in Hawaii) are born every other year; the number of young increases with female size. Estimates of the gestation period range from 9 to 14 months. Parturition is thought to take place from July to August in the Southern Hemisphere and from March to July in the Northern Hemisphere. However, females with &quot;full-term embryos&quot; have also been reported in the fall off Enewetak. The newborns measure long. Sexual maturation occurs around seven years of age, when the males are long and females are long. Females on the Great Barrier Reef mature at 11 years of age, later than at other locations, and at a slightly larger size. The lifespan is at least 25 years.

==Behavior==

Grey reef sharks are active at all times of the day, with activity levels peaking at night. At Rangiroa, groups of around 30 sharks spend the day together in a small part of their collective home range, dispersing at night into shallower water to forage for food. Their home range is about . At Enewetak in the Marshall Islands, grey reef sharks from different parts of the reef exhibit different social and ranging behaviors. Sharks on the outer ocean reefs tend to be nomadic, swimming long distances along the reef, while those around lagoon reefs and underwater pinnacles stay within defined daytime and nighttime home ranges. Where strong tidal currents occur, grey reef sharks move against the water, toward the shore with the ebbing tide and back out to sea with the rising tide. This may allow them to better detect the scent of their prey, or afford them the cover of turbid water in which to hunt.

Little evidence of territoriality is seen in the grey reef shark; individuals tolerate others of their species entering and feeding within their home ranges. Off Hawaii, individuals may stay around the same part of the reef up to three years, while at Rangiroa, they regularly shift their locations up to . Individual grey reef sharks at Enewetak become highly aggressive at specific locations, suggesting they may exhibit dominant behavior over other sharks in their home areas.

===Sociality===

Social aggregation is well documented in grey reef sharks. In the northwestern Hawaiian Islands, large numbers of pregnant females have been observed slowly swimming in circles in shallow water, occasionally exposing their dorsal fins or backs. These groups last from 11:00 to 15:00, corresponding to peak daylight hours. Similarly, at Sand Island off Johnston Atoll, females form aggregations in shallow water from March to June. The number of sharks per group differs from year to year. Each day, the sharks begin arriving at the aggregation area at 09:00, reaching a peak in numbers during the hottest part of the day in the afternoon, and dispersing by 19:00. Individual sharks return to the aggregation site every one to six days. These female sharks are speculated to be taking advantage of the warmer water to speed their growth or that of their embryos. The shallow waters may also enable them to avoid unwanted attention by males.

Off Enewetak, grey reef sharks exhibit different social behaviors on different parts of the reef. Sharks tend to be solitary on shallower reefs and pinnacles. Near reef drop-offs, loose aggregations of five to 20 sharks form in the morning and grow in number throughout the day before dispersing at night. In level areas, sharks form polarized schools (all swimming in the same direction) of around 30 individuals near the sea bottom, arranging themselves parallel to each other or slowly swimming in circles. Most individuals within polarized schools are females, and the formation of these schools has been theorized to relate to mating or pupping.

===Threat display===

The &quot;hunch&quot; threat display of the grey reef shark is the most pronounced and well-known agonistic display (a display directed toward competitors or threats) of any shark. Investigations of this behavior have been focused on the reaction of sharks to approaching divers, some of which have culminated in attacks. The display consists of the shark raising its snout, dropping its pectoral fins, arching its back, and curving its body laterally. While holding this posture, the shark swims with a stiff, exaggerated side-to-side motion, sometimes combined with rolls or figure-8 loops. The intensity of the display increases if the shark is more closely approached or if obstacles are blocking its escape routes, such as landmarks or other sharks. If the diver persists, the shark may either retreat or launch a rapid, open-mouthed attack, slashing with its upper teeth.

Most observed displays by grey reef sharks have been in response to a diver (or submersible) approaching and following it from a few meters behind and above. They also perform the display toward moray eels, and in one instance toward a much larger great hammerhead (which subsequently withdrew). However, they have never been seen performing threat displays toward each other. This suggests the display is primarily a response to potential threats (i.e. predators) rather than competitors. As grey reef sharks are not territorial, they are thought to be defending a critical volume of &quot;personal space&quot; around themselves. Compared to sharks from French Polynesia or Micronesia, grey reef sharks from the Indian Ocean and western Pacific are not as aggressive and less given to displaying.

==Human interactions==
Grey reef sharks are often curious about divers when they first enter the water and may approach quite closely, though they lose interest on repeat dives. They can become dangerous in the presence of food, and tend to be more aggressive if encountered in open water rather than on the reef. There have been several known attacks on spearfishers, possibly by mistake, when the shark struck at the speared fish close to the diver. This species will also attack if pursued or cornered, and divers should immediately retreat (slowly and always facing the shark) if it begins to perform a threat display. Photographing the display should not be attempted, as the flash from a camera is known to have incited at least one attack. Although of modest size, they are capable of inflicting significant damage: during one study of the threat display, a grey reef shark attacked the researchers&#x27; submersible multiple times, leaving tooth marks in the plastic windows and biting off one of the propellers. The shark consistently launched its attacks from a distance of , which it was able to cover in a third of a second. As of 2008, the International Shark Attack File listed seven unprovoked and six provoked attacks (none of them fatal) attributable to this species.

Although still abundant in pristine sites, grey reef sharks are susceptible to localized depletion due to their slow reproductive rate, specific habitat requirements, and tendency to stay within a certain area. The IUCN has assessed the grey reef shark as endangered; this shark is taken by multispecies fisheries in many parts of its range and used for various products such as shark fin soup and fishmeal. Another threat is the continuing degradation of coral reefs from human development. There is evidence of substantial declines in some populations. Anderson &quot;et al.&quot; (1998) reported, in the Chagos Archipelago, grey reef shark numbers in 1996 had fallen to 14% of 1970s levels. Robbins &quot;et al.&quot; (2006) found grey reef shark populations in Great Barrier Reef fishing zones had declined by 97% compared to no-entry zones (boats are not allowed). In addition, no-take zones (boats are allowed but fishing is prohibited) had the same levels of depletion as fishing zones, illustrating the severe effect of poaching. Projections suggested the shark population would fall to 0.1% of pre-exploitation levels within 20 years without additional conservation measures. One possible avenue for conservation is ecotourism, as grey reef sharks are suitable for shark-watching ventures, and profitable diving sites now enjoy protection in many countries, such as the Maldives.

<text>The red grouse (Lagopus scotica) is a medium-sized bird of the grouse family which is found in heather moorland in Great Britain and Ireland.

It was formerly classified as a subspecies of the willow ptarmigan (&quot;Lagopus lagopus&quot;) but is now considered to be a separate species. It is also known as the moorcock, moorfowl or moorbird. &quot;Lagopus&quot; is derived from Ancient Greek (), meaning &quot;hare&quot;, + (), &quot;foot&quot;, in reference to the feathered feet and toes typical of this cold-adapted genus, and &quot;scoticus&quot; is &quot;of Scotland&quot;.

The red grouse is the logo of The Famous Grouse whisky and an animated bird is a character in a series of its adverts. The red grouse is also the emblem of the journal &quot;British Birds&quot;.

==Description==
The red grouse is differentiated from the willow ptarmigan and rock ptarmigan by its plumage being reddish brown, and not having a white winter plumage. The tail is black and the legs are white. There are white stripes on the underwing and red combs over the eye. Females are less reddish than the males and have less conspicuous combs. Young birds are duller and lack the red combs.

Birds in Ireland are sometimes thought to belong to a separate subspecies &quot;L. l. hibernica&quot;. They are slightly paler than those in Britain and the females have yellower plumage with more finely barred underparts. This may be an adaptation to camouflage them in moorland with higher grass and sedge content and less heather.

It is identified by its ″&quot;chut!chut!chut!chut!chut!chuttt...&quot;″ call, or the ″&quot;Goback, goback, goback&quot;″ vocalisation. The wings make a whirring sound when the bird is disturbed from a resting place.

Grouse populations display periodic cycling, where the population builds up to very high densities only to crash a few years later, and then recover. The main driver of this cyclic pattern is thought to be the parasitic nematode worm &quot;Trichostrongylus tenuis&quot;.

However, in his book, V. C. Wynne-Edwards suggests that the primary reason for mortality in grouse population is homeostasis depending largely on food availability and that the &#x27;Grouse disease&#x27;, due to the parasitic worm &quot;Trichostrongylus tenuis&quot; is a mistaken diagnosis of the after effects of social exclusion.

==Distribution and habitat==
The red grouse is endemic to the British Isles; it has developed in isolation from other subspecies of the willow ptarmigan which are widespread in northern parts of Eurasia and North America.

It is found across most parts of Scotland, including Orkney, Shetland and most of the Outer Hebrides. They are only absent from urban areas, such as in the Central Belt.

In Wales there are strong populations in places but their range has retracted. They are now largely absent from the far south, their main strongholds being Snowdonia, the Brecon Beacons and the Cambrian Mountains.

In England it is mainly found in the north – places such as the Lake District, Northumberland, County Durham, much of Yorkshire, the Pennines and the Peak District, as far south as the Staffordshire Moorlands. There is an isolated introduced population on Dartmoor, and overspill Welsh birds visit the Shropshire Hills such as Long Mynd, where they breed. The Exmoor population would now appear to be extinct, with the last birds sighted as recently as 2005. An introduced population in Suffolk died out by the early 20th century, though a population on Cannock Chase in Staffordshire lasted longer.

In Ireland it is found locally in most parts of the country: it is commonest in County Mayo, where the population is increasing, and on the County Antrim plateau, with other healthy populations in the Slieve Bloom Mountains and the Knockmealdown Mountains; There is still a small
population in south County Dublin.

The small population in the Isle of Man is mostly concentrated in the southern hills but conservation work is ongoing throughout the uplands to ensure the species&#x27; continued viability.

Its typical habitat is upland heather moors away from trees. It can also be found in some low-lying bogs and birds may visit farmland during hard weather.

The British population is estimated at 250,000 pairs with around 1–5,000 pairs in Ireland. Numbers have declined in recent years and birds are now absent in areas where they were once common. Reasons for the decline include loss of heather due to overgrazing, creation of new conifer plantations and a decline in the number of upland gamekeepers. Some predators such as the hen harrier feed on grouse and there is ongoing controversy as to what effect these have on grouse numbers.

Red grouse have been introduced to the Hautes Fagnes region of Belgium but the population there died out in the early 1970s.

==Behaviour==

===Diet===
The red grouse is herbivorous and feeds mainly on the shoots, seeds and flowers of heather. It will also feed on berries, cereal crops and sometimes insects.

===Breeding===
The birds begin to form pairs during the autumn and males become increasingly territorial as winter progresses. The nest is a shallow scrape up to across which is lined with vegetation. About six to nine eggs are laid, mainly during April and May. They are oval, glossy and pale yellow with dark brown blotches. The eggs are incubated for 19 to 25 days, the chicks can fly after 12 to 13 days after hatching and are fully grown after 30 to 35 days.

==Conservation==
Member States of the European Union are obliged by virtue of Council Directive 2009/147/EC on the conservation of wild birds (popularly called the Birds Directive) to take the requisite measures for the protection of the red grouse; but as it is a species to which Annex II of the Directive applies, Article 7 permits hunting under national law, provided population levels are not threatened as a result. In 2002, Ireland was found by the European Court of Justice to be in breach of its obligations under an earlier Birds Directive to protect the red grouse, in that it had allowed a crucial breeding ground to become degraded through overgrazing by sheep. Conservation measures taken on foot of the judgment have seen the population in the area double from c.400 to 800.

==As a game bird==
The red grouse is considered a game bird and is shot in large numbers during the shooting season which traditionally starts on August 12, known as the Glorious Twelfth. There is a keen competition among some London restaurants to serve freshly killed grouse on August 12, with the birds being flown from the moors and cooked within hours.
Shooting can take the form of &#x27;walked up&#x27; (where shooters walk across the moor to flush grouse and take a shot) or &#x27;driven&#x27; (where grouse are driven, often in large numbers, by &#x27;beaters&#x27; towards the guns who are hiding behind a line of &#x27;butts&#x27;). Many moors are managed to increase the density of grouse. Areas of heather are subjected to controlled burning; this allows fresh young shoots to regenerate, which are favoured by the grouse. Extensive predator control is a feature of grouse moor management: foxes, stoats and crows are usually heavily controlled on grouse moors. The extent to which it occurs on grouse moors is hotly contested between conservation groups and shooting interests, and the subject generates a lot of media attention in relation to grouse moors and shooting.

In recent decades the practice of using medicated grit and direct dosing of birds against an endoparasite, the strongyle worm or threadworm (&quot;Trichostrongylus tenuis&quot;), has become part of the management regime on many moors.

== As food ==
The flavour of grouse, like most game birds, develops if the bird is hung for a few days after shooting and before eating. Roasting is the most common way to cook a grouse.

&quot;The Cookery Book of Lady Clark of Tillypronie&quot; (1909) has 11 recipes for using grouse. The recipe &quot;To cook old birds&quot; runs as follows:
==Scientific study==
Because of their economic and social importance and some interesting aspects of their biology, red grouse have been widely studied. They were the subject of some of the earliest studies of population biology in birds, as detailed in&quot; The Grouse in Health and in Disease&quot; by Lord Lovat in 1911. Since the mid-20th century they have been subject to ongoing study by many organisations and individuals. Much work has been conducted by the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology in the eastern Cairngorms, and by the Game &amp; Wildlife Conservation Trust in the Central Highlands. There are a wide range of research activities still going on today and a wealth of published literature exists on all aspects of grouse biology.

==Parasites and viruses==

The red grouse may be infected by parasites and viruses which severely affect populations. Strongylosis or &#x27;grouse disease&#x27; is caused by the strongyle worm, which induces damage and internal bleeding after burrowing into the caecum. This endoparasite is often eaten with the tops of young heather shoots and can lead to mortality and poor condition, including a decrease in the bird&#x27;s ability to control the scent it emits.

First diagnosed in the UK in 2010, respiratory cryptosporidiosis, caused by &quot;Cryptosporidium baileyi&quot;, is present in approximately half the grouse moors in northern England, where it reduces natural survival and productivity of red grouse. 

Louping ill virus is a flavivirus (RNA virus), also known as sheep encephalomyelitis virus. Flaviviruses are transmitted by arthropods, and louping ill virus is transmitted by ticks. In red grouse, this virus can cause mortality as high as 78%. The main tick vector is the sheep tick &quot;Ixodes ricinus&quot;. Although traditionally tick-borne diseases are thought to be caused when the parasite bites its host, it has been shown that red grouse chicks can be affected when they eat ticks with which they come into contact. This virus may be a significant factor in red grouse populations.

<doc id="320166" wikidata="Q2872456" url="?curid=320166" title="Pre-ignition">
<text>Pre-ignition (or preignition) in a spark-ignition engine is a technically different phenomenon from engine knocking, and describes the event wherein the air/fuel mixture in the cylinder ignites before the spark plug fires. Pre-ignition is initiated by an ignition source other than the spark, such as hot spots in the combustion chamber, a spark plug that runs too hot for the application, or carbonaceous deposits in the combustion chamber heated to incandescence by previous engine combustion events.

The phenomenon is also referred to as &#x27;after-run&#x27;, or &#x27;run-on&#x27; or sometimes dieseling, when it causes the engine to carry on running after the ignition is shut off. This effect is more readily achieved on carbureted gasoline engines, because the fuel supply to the carburetor is typically regulated by a passive mechanical float valve and fuel delivery can feasibly continue until fuel line pressure has been relieved, provided the fuel can be somehow drawn past the throttle plate. The occurrence is rare in modern engines with throttle-body or electronic fuel injection, because the injectors will not be permitted to continue delivering fuel after the engine is shut off, and any occurrence may indicate the presence of a leaking (failed) injector.

In the case of highly supercharged or high compression multi-cylinder engines, pre-ignition can quickly melt or burn pistons since the power generated by other still functioning pistons will force the overheated ones along no matter how early the mix pre-ignites. Many engines have suffered such failure where improper fuel delivery is present. Often one injector may clog while the others carry on normally allowing mild detonation in one cylinder that leads to serious detonation, then pre-ignition.

The challenges associated with pre-ignition have increased in recent years with the development of highly boosted and &quot;downspeeded&quot; spark ignition engines. The reduced engine speeds allow more time for autoignition chemistry to complete thus promoting the possibility of pre-ignition and so called &quot;mega-knock&quot;. Under these circumstances, there is still significant debate as to the sources of the pre-ignition event.

Pre-ignition and engine knock both sharply increase combustion chamber temperatures. Consequently, either effect increases the likelihood of the other effect occurring, and both can produce similar effects from the operator&#x27;s perspective, such as rough engine operation or loss of performance due to operational intervention by a powertrain-management computer. For reasons like these, a person not familiarized with the distinction might describe one by the name of the other. Given proper combustion chamber design, pre-ignition can generally be eliminated by proper spark plug selection, proper fuel/air mixture adjustment, and periodic cleaning of the combustion chambers.

==Causes of pre-ignition==
Causes of pre-ignition include the following:
* Carbon deposits form a heat barrier and can be a contributing factor to pre-ignition. Other causes include: An overheated spark plug (too hot a heat range for the application). Glowing carbon deposits on a hot exhaust valve (which may mean the valve is running too hot because of poor seating, a weak valve spring or insufficient valve lash)
* A sharp edge in the combustion chamber or on top of a piston (rounding sharp edges with a grinder can eliminate this cause)
* Sharp edges on valves that were reground improperly (not enough margin left on the edges)
* A lean fuel mixture or excessive amount of oxygen in the combustion chamber
* An engine that is running hotter than normal due to a cooling system problem (low coolant level, slipping fan clutch, inoperative electric cooling fan or other cooling system problem)
* Auto-ignition of engine oil droplets (Can be solved by using an oil catch tank)
* Insufficient oil in the engine
* Ignition timing too far advanced
* Too much air/too little fuel (octane) to withstand pressures (too much air causes too much pressure for the octane to handle, too little fuel reduces the octane to handle the pressurized air) 

==Detonation induced pre-ignition==
Because of the way detonation breaks down the boundary layer of protective lubricant surrounding components in the cylinder, such as the spark plug electrode, these components can start to get very hot over sustained periods of detonation and glow. Eventually this can lead to the far more catastrophic pre-Ignition as described above.

While it is not uncommon for an automobile engine to continue on for thousands of kilometers with mild detonation, pre-ignition can destroy an engine in just a few strokes of the piston.

<text>USS &quot;Agamenticus was one of four s built for the [[United States Navy]] during the [[American Civil War]]. [[Ship commissioning|Commissioned]] as the war was ending in May 1865, the [[ironclad warship|ironclad]] saw no combat and was [[Ship decommissioning|decommissioned]] in September and placed in [[Reserve fleet|reserve]]. The ship was reactivated in 1870, having been renamed Terror&quot; the previous year, and was assigned to the North Atlantic Fleet where she served in the Caribbean Sea. The monitor was decommissioned again in 1872 and was sold for scrap two years later. The Navy Department evaded the Congressional refusal to order new ships by claiming that the Civil War-era ship was being repaired while building a new monitor of the same name.

==Description==
The &quot;Miantonomoh&quot; class was designed by John Lenthall, Chief of the Bureau of Construction and Repair, although the ships varied somewhat in their details. &quot;Agamenticus&quot; was long overall, had a beam of and had a draft of . The ship had a depth of hold of , a tonnage of 1,564 tons burthen and displaced . She was fitted with a breakwater to protect the forward gun turret from flooding in high seas. Her crew consisted of 150 officers and enlisted men.

&quot;Agamenticus&quot; was powered by a pair of two-cylinder horizontal vibrating-lever steam engines, each driving one four-bladed propeller about in diameter using steam generated by four Martin vertical water-tube boilers. The engines were rated at and gave the ship a top speed of . She was designed to carry of coal.

===Armament and armor===
Her main battery consisted of four smoothbore, muzzle-loading, Dahlgren guns mounted in two twin-gun turrets, one each fore and aft of the single funnel. Each gun weighed approximately . They could fire a shell up to a range of at an elevation of +7°.

The sides of the hull of the &quot;Miantonomoh&quot;-class ships were protected by five layers of wrought-iron plates that tapered at their bottom edge down to total of , backed by of wood. The armor of the gun turret consisted of ten layers of one-inch plates and the pilot house had eight layers. The ship&#x27;s deck was protected by armor thick. The bases of the funnel and the ventilator were also protected by unknown thicknesses of armor.

==Construction and career==

&quot;Agamenticus&quot; was named after Mount Agamenticus in York County, Maine.
The monitor was laid down in 1862 at the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine and launched on 19 March 1863. To speed her construction, her hull was built from green wood. While still building in early 1864, she was modified with the addition of a turret-roof-height &quot;hurricane deck&quot; that stretched between the two turrets and around the funnel and main ventilator to improve her navigational facilities. &quot;Agamenticus&quot; was commissioned on 5 May 1865 and was prepared to fight the Confederate ironclad CSS &quot;Stonewall&quot; that was at sea somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean at that time. &quot;Stonewall&quot; went elsewhere and the monitor operated off the northeastern coast of the United States until she was decommissioned at the Boston Navy Yard on 30 September. &quot;Agamenticus&quot; remained laid up for nearly five years and was renamed &quot;Terror&quot; on 15 June 1869.

Before she was formally recommissioned on 27 May 1870, the ship was tasked in January to join a small group of ships under the command of Admiral David Farragut that escorted the British ironclad to Portland, Maine, as it ferried the body of the philanthropist George Peabody from London to his final resting place. &quot;Terror&quot; was assigned to the North Atlantic Fleet when she was reactivated. At that time it mostly operated in the Caribbean Sea, protecting American citizens and interests during the Ten Years&#x27; War in Spanish Cuba and unrest in the West Indies.

The monitor was relieved of her assignment at Key West, Florida, on 17 May 1872 and she was towed to the Philadelphia Navy Yard, Pennsylvania, by the tugboat . &quot;Terror&quot; was again laid up on 10 June. Around this time the ship was fitted with an elevated wooden pilot house above the armored pilot house on the forward turret. Two years later, her wooden hull was rotting and she was sold for scrap. Although Congress was informed by the Navy Department that the Civil War-era ship was being repaired, a new iron-hulled monitor of the same name was built with repair money and the proceeds of her sale because Congress refused to fund any new construction at this time.

<text>Joyce Carol Oates (born June 16, 1938) is an American writer. Oates published her first book in 1963, and has since published 58 novels, a number of plays and novellas, and many volumes of short stories, poetry, and nonfiction. Her novels &quot;Black Water&quot; (1992), &quot;What I Lived For&quot; (1994), and &quot;Blonde&quot; (2000), and her short story collections &quot;The Wheel of Love&quot; (1970) and &quot;Lovely, Dark, Deep: Stories&quot; (2014) were each finalists for the Pulitzer Prize. She has won many awards for her writing, including the National Book Award, for her novel &quot;Them&quot; (1969), two O. Henry Awards, the National Humanities Medal, and the Jerusalem Prize (2019).

Oates taught at Princeton University from 1978 to 2014, and is the Roger S. Berlind &#x27;52 Professor Emerita in the Humanities with the Program in Creative Writing. From 2016 to 2020, she was a visiting professor at the University of California, Berkeley, where she taught short fiction in the spring semesters. She now teaches at Rutgers University, New Brunswick.

Oates was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2016.

==Early life and education==
Oates was born in Lockport, New York, the eldest of three children of Carolina (&quot;née&quot; Bush), a homemaker of Hungarian descent, and Frederic James Oates, a tool and die designer. She grew up on her parents&#x27; farm outside the town.

Her brother, Fred Jr., and sister, Lynn Ann, were born in 1943 and 1956, respectively. Lynn Ann has autism and is institutionalized, and Oates has not seen her since 1971. Oates grew up in the working-class farming community of Millersport, New York. She characterized hers as &quot;a happy, close-knit and unextraordinary family for our time, place and economic status&quot;, but her childhood as &quot;a daily scramble for existence&quot;. Her widowed paternal grandmother, Blanche Woodside, lived with the family and was &quot;very close&quot; to Joyce. After Blanche&#x27;s death, Joyce learned that Blanche&#x27;s father had killed himself. Oates eventually drew on aspects of her grandmother&#x27;s life in writing the novel &quot;The Gravedigger&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (2007).

Violence marred the lives of Oates and her recent ancestors: Oates&#x27;s mother&#x27;s biological father was murdered in 1917, which led to Oates mother&#x27;s informal adoption. At age fourteen, Oates&#x27;s paternal grandmother Blanche survived an attempted murder-suicide at the hands of her own father. He did kill himself. When Oates was a child, her next-door neighbor pleaded guilty to charges of arson and attempted murder of his family, and was sentenced to a prison term at Attica Correctional Facility.

Oates attended the same one-room school her mother had attended as a child. She became interested in reading at an early age and remembers Blanche&#x27;s gift of Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; (1865) as &quot;the great treasure of my childhood, and the most profound literary influence of my life. This was love at first sight!&quot; In her early teens, she read the work of Charlotte Brontë, Emily Brontë, Fyodor Dostoevsky, William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway, and Henry David Thoreau, writers whose &quot;influences remain very deep&quot;.

Oates began writing at the age of 14, when Blanche gave her a typewriter. Oates later transferred to several bigger, suburban schools and graduated from Williamsville South High School in 1956, where she worked for her high school newspaper. She was the first in her family to complete high school.

As a teen, Oates also received early recognition for her writing by winning a Scholastic Art and Writing Award.

==University==
Oates earned a scholarship to attend Syracuse University, where she joined Phi Mu. She found Syracuse to be &quot;a very exciting place academically and intellectually&quot;, and trained herself by &quot;writing novel after novel and always throwing them out when I completed them&quot;. It was at this point that Oates began reading the work of Franz Kafka, D. H. Lawrence, Thomas Mann, and Flannery O&#x27;Connor, and she noted, &quot;these influences are still quite strong, pervasive&quot;. At the age of 19, she won the &quot;college short story&quot; contest sponsored by &quot;Mademoiselle&quot;. Oates was elected to Phi Beta Kappa as a junior and graduated valedictorian from Syracuse University with a B.A. &quot;summa cum laude&quot; in English in 1960, and received her M.A. from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1961. She was a Ph.D. student at Rice University but left to become a full-time writer.

Evelyn Shrifte, president of the Vanguard Press, met Oates soon after Oates received her master&#x27;s degree. &quot;She was fresh out of school, and I thought she was a genius&quot;, Shrifte said. Vanguard published Oates&#x27; first book, the short-story collection &quot;By the North Gate&quot;, in 1963.

==Career==
The Vanguard Press published Oates&#x27; first novel, &quot;With Shuddering Fall&quot; (1964), when she was 26 years old. In 1966, she published &quot;Where Are You Going, Where Have You Been?&quot;, a short story dedicated to Bob Dylan and written after listening to his song &quot;It&#x27;s All Over Now, Baby Blue&quot;. The story is loosely based on the serial killer Charles Schmid, also known as &quot;The Pied Piper of Tucson&quot;. It has been anthologized many times and adapted as a 1985 film, &quot;Smooth Talk&quot;, which starred Laura Dern. In 2008, Oates said that of all her published work, she is most noted for &quot;Where Are You Going, Where Have You Been?&quot;

Another early short story, &quot;In a Region of Ice&quot; (&quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;, August 1966), features a young, gifted Jewish-American student. It dramatizes his drift into protest against the world of education and the sober, established society of his parents, his depression, and eventually murder-cum-suicide. It was inspired by a real-life incident (as were several of her works) and Oates had been acquainted with the model of her protagonist. She revisited this subject in the title story of her collection &quot;Last Days: Stories&quot; (1984). &quot;In the Region of Ice&quot; won the first of her two O. Henry Awards.

Oates’s second novel was &quot;A Garden of Earthly Delights&quot; (1967), first of the so-called Wonderland Quartet published by Vanguard 1967–71. All were finalists for the annual National Book Award. The third novel in the series, &quot;them&quot; (1969), won the 1970 National Book Award for Fiction. It is set in Detroit during a time span from the 1930s to the 1960s, most of it in black ghetto neighborhoods, and deals openly with crime, drugs, and racial and class conflicts. Again, some of the key characters and events were based on real people whom Oates had known or heard of during her years in the city. Since then, she has published an average of two books a year. Frequent topics in her work include rural poverty, sexual abuse, class tensions, desire for power, female childhood and adolescence, and occasionally the &quot;fantastic&quot;. Violence is a constant in her work, even leading Oates to have written an essay in response to the question: &quot;Why Is Your Writing So Violent?&quot;

In 1990, Oates discussed her novel, &quot;Because It Is Bitter, and Because It Is My Heart&quot;, which also deals with themes of racial tension, and described &quot;the experience of writing [it]&quot; as &quot;so intense it seemed almost electric&quot;. She is a fan of poet and novelist Sylvia Plath, describing Plath&#x27;s sole novel &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; as a &quot;near perfect work of art&quot;, but though Oates has often been compared to Plath, she disavows Plath&#x27;s romanticism about suicide, and among her characters, she favors cunning, hardy survivors, both women and men. In the early 1980s, Oates began writing stories in the Gothic and horror genres; in her foray into these genres, Oates said she was &quot;deeply influenced&quot; by Kafka and felt &quot;a writerly kinship&quot; with James Joyce.

In 1996, Oates published &quot;We Were the Mulvaneys&quot;, a novel following the disintegration of an American family, which became a best-seller after being selected by Oprah&#x27;s Book Club in 2001. &quot;We Were the Mulvaneys&quot; was eventually turned into a TV movie, which was nominated for several awards. In the 1990s and early 2000s, Oates wrote several books, mostly suspense novels, under the pen names Rosamond Smith and Lauren Kelly.

Since at least the early 1980s, Oates has been rumored to be a favorite to win the Nobel Prize in Literature by oddsmakers and critics. Her papers, held at Syracuse University, include 17 unpublished short stories and four unpublished or unfinished novellas. Oates has said that most of her early unpublished work was &quot;cheerfully thrown away&quot;.

One review of Oates&#x27;s 1970 story collection &quot;The Wheel of Love&quot; characterized her as an author &quot;of considerable talent&quot; but at that time &quot;far from being a great writer&quot;.

Oates&#x27;s 2006 short story &quot;Landfill&quot; was criticized because it drew on the death, several months earlier, of John A. Fiocco Jr., a 19-year-old New Jersey college student.

In 1998, Oates received the F. Scott Fitzgerald Award for Achievement in American Literature, which is given annually to recognize outstanding achievement in American literature.

===&quot;Ontario Review&quot;===
Oates founded &quot;The Ontario Review&quot;, a literary magazine, in 1974 in Canada, with Raymond J. Smith, her husband and fellow graduate student, who would eventually become a professor of 18th-century literature. Smith served as editor of this venture, and Oates served as associate editor. The magazine&#x27;s mission, according to Smith, the editor, was to bridge the literary and artistic culture of the US and Canada: &quot;We tried to do this by publishing writers and artists from both countries, as well as essays and reviews of an intercultural nature.&quot; In 1978, Sylvester &amp; Orphanos published &quot;A Sentimental Education&quot;, a collection of short stories.

In 1980, Oates and Smith founded Ontario Review Books, an independent publishing house. In 2004, Oates described the partnership as &quot;a marriage of like minds – both my husband and I are so interested in literature and we read the same books; he&#x27;ll be reading a book and then I&#x27;ll read it – we trade and we talk about our reading at meal times ...&quot;.

===Teaching career===
Oates taught in Beaumont, Texas, for a year, then moved to Detroit in 1962, where she began teaching at the University of Detroit. Influenced by the Vietnam War, the 1967 Detroit race riots, and a job offer, Oates moved across the river into Canada in 1968 with her husband, to a teaching position at the University of Windsor in Ontario. In 1978, she moved to Princeton, New Jersey, and began teaching at Princeton University.

Among others, Oates influenced Jonathan Safran Foer, who took an introductory writing course with Oates in 1995 as a Princeton undergraduate. Foer recalled later that Oates took an interest in his writing and his &quot;most important of writerly qualities, energy&quot;, noting that she was &quot;the first person to ever make me think I should try to write in any sort of serious way. And my life really changed after that.&quot; Oates served as advisor for Foer&#x27;s senior thesis, which was an early version of his novel &quot;Everything Is Illuminated&quot; (published to acclaim in 2002).

Oates retired from teaching at Princeton in 2014 and was honored at a retirement party in November of that year.

Oates has taught creative short fiction at UC Berkeley since 2016 and offers her course in spring semesters.

==Views==
===Religion===
Oates was raised Catholic, but as of 2007 she identified as an atheist. In an interview with &quot;Commonweal&quot; magazine, Oates stated: &quot;I think of religion as a kind of psychological manifestation of deep powers, deep imaginative, mysterious powers which are always with us.&quot;

===Politics===
Oates self-identifies as a liberal, and supports gun control. She was a vocal critic of US President Donald Trump and his policies during his first term, both in public and on Twitter.

Oates opposed the shuttering of cultural institutions on Trump&#x27;s first inauguration day as a protest against the President, stating that this &quot;would only hurt artists. Rather, cultural institutions should be sanctuaries for those repelled by the inauguration.&quot;

In January 2019, Oates stated that &quot;Trump is like a figurehead, but I think what really controls everything is just a few really wealthy families or corporations.&quot;

==Productivity==

Oates writes in longhand, working from &quot;8 till 1 every day, then again for two or three hours in the evening.&quot; Her prolificacy has become one of her best-known attributes, although often discussed disparagingly. &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote in 1989 that Oates&#x27;s &quot;name is synonymous with productivity.&quot; Martyn Bedford wrote in &quot;Literary Review&quot; that &quot;perhaps she is a victim of her own productivity.&quot; In 2004, &quot;The Guardian&quot; noted that, &quot;Nearly every review of an Oates book, it seems, begins with a list [of her publication totals]&quot;.

In a journal entry written in the 1970s, Oates sarcastically addressed her critics, writing, &quot;So many books! so many! Obviously JCO has a full career behind her, if one chooses to look at it that way; many more titles and she might as well... what?... give up all hopes for a &#x27;reputation&#x27;? […] but I work hard, and long, and as the hours roll by I seem to create more than I anticipate; more, certainly, than the literary world allows for a &#x27;serious&#x27; writer. Yet I have more stories to tell, and more novels […] &quot;. In &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot; in 2007, Michael Dirda suggested that disparaging criticism of Oates &quot;derives from reviewer&#x27;s angst: How does one judge a new book by Oates when one is not familiar with most of the backlist? Where does one start?&quot;

Several publications have published lists of what they deem the best Joyce Carol Oates books, designed to help introduce readers to the author&#x27;s daunting body of work. In a 2003 article entitled &quot;Joyce Carol Oates for dummies&quot;, &quot;The Rocky Mountain News&quot; recommended starting with her early short stories and the novels &quot;A Garden of Earthly Delights&quot; (1967), &quot;them&quot; (1969), &quot;Wonderland&quot; (1971), &quot;Black Water&quot; (1992), and &quot;Blonde&quot; (2000). In 2006, &quot;The Times&quot; listed &quot;them&quot;, &quot;On Boxing&quot; (1987), &quot;Black Water&quot;, and &quot;High Lonesome: New &amp; Selected Stories, 1966–2006&quot; (2006) as &quot;The Pick of Joyce Carol Oates&quot;. In 2007, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; listed its Oates favorites as &quot;Wonderland&quot;, &quot;Black Water&quot;, &quot;Blonde&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ll Take You There&quot; (2002), and &quot;The Falls&quot; (2004). In 2003, Oates herself said that she thinks she will be remembered for, and would most want a first-time Oates reader to read, &quot;them&quot; and &quot;Blonde&quot;, although she &quot;could as easily have chosen a number of titles.&quot;

In a 2025 interview with &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, the novelist Garth Risk Hallberg suggested that &quot;a new [Oates] reader should begin with the collection &quot;High Lonesome.&quot;&quot; He also deemed the novels &quot;them&quot;, &quot;I Lock My Door Upon Myself&quot; (1990), and &quot;Blonde&quot; &quot;essential&quot; Oates works.

==Personal life==

Oates met Raymond J. Smith, a fellow graduate student, at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, and they married in 1961. Smith became a professor of 18th-century literature and, later, an editor and publisher. Oates described the partnership as &quot;a marriage of like minds...&quot; and &quot;a very collaborative and imaginative marriage&quot;. Smith died of complications from pneumonia on February 18, 2008, and the death affected Oates profoundly. In April 2008, Oates wrote to an interviewer, &quot;Since my husband&#x27;s unexpected death, I really have very little energy [...] My marriagemy love for my husbandseems to have come first in my life, rather than my writing. Set beside his death, the future of my writing scarcely interests me at the moment.&quot;

After six months of near suicidal grieving for Smith, Oates met Charles Gross, a professor in the Psychology Department and Neuroscience Institute at Princeton, at a dinner party at her home. In early 2009, Oates and Gross were married. On April 13, 2019, Oates announced via Twitter that Gross had died at the age of 83.

As a diarist, Oates began keeping a detailed journal in 1973, documenting her personal and literary life; it eventually grew to &quot;more than 4,000 single-spaced typewritten pages&quot;. In 2008, Oates said she had &quot;moved away from keeping a formal journal&quot; and instead preserved copies of her e-mails.

As of 1999, Oates remained devoted to running, of which she has written: &quot;Ideally, the runner who&#x27;s a writer is running through the land- and cityscapes of her fiction, like a ghost in a real setting.&quot; While running, Oates mentally envisions scenes in her novels and works out structural problems in already-written drafts; she formulated the germ of her novel &quot;You Must Remember This&quot; (1987) while running, when she &quot;glanced up and saw the ruins of a railroad bridge&quot;, which reminded her of &quot;a mythical upstate New York city in the right place&quot;.

Oates was a member of the board of trustees of the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation from 1997 to 2016. She is an honorary member of the Simpson Literary Project, which annually awards the $50,000 Simpson/Joyce Carol Oates Literary Prize to a mid-career writer. She has served as the Project&#x27;s artist-in-residence several times.

==Bibliography==
Oates&#x27;s extensive bibliography contains poetry, plays, criticism, short stories, eleven novellas, and sixty novels, including &quot;Them&quot;, &quot;Blonde&quot;, &quot;Because It Is Bitter, and Because It Is My Heart&quot;, &quot;Black Water&quot;, &quot;Mudwoman&quot;, &quot;Carthage&quot;, &quot;The Man Without a Shadow&quot;, and &quot;A Book of American Martyrs&quot;. She has published several novels under the pseudonyms Rosamond Smith and Lauren Kelly.
