<text>In computer science, a smart pointer is an abstract data type that simulates a pointer while providing added features, such as automatic memory management or bounds checking. Such features are intended to reduce bugs caused by the misuse of pointers, while retaining efficiency. Smart pointers typically keep track of the memory they point to, and may also be used to manage other resources, such as network connections and file handles. Smart pointers were first popularized in the programming language C++ during the first half of the 1990s as rebuttal to criticisms of C++&#x27;s lack of automatic garbage collection.

Pointer misuse can be a major source of bugs. Smart pointers prevent most situations of memory leaks by making the memory deallocation automatic. More generally, they make object destruction automatic: an object controlled by a smart pointer is automatically destroyed (finalized and then deallocated) when the last (or only) owner of an object is destroyed, for example because the owner is a local variable, and execution leaves the variable&#x27;s scope. Smart pointers also eliminate dangling pointers by postponing destruction until an object is no longer in use.

If a language supports automatic garbage collection (for example, Java or C#), then smart pointers are unneeded for reclaiming and safety aspects of memory management, yet are useful for other purposes, such as cache data structure residence management and resource management of objects such as file handles or network sockets.

Several types of smart pointers exist. Some work with reference counting, others by assigning ownership of an object to one pointer.

== History ==
Even though C++ popularized the concept of smart pointers, especially the reference-counted variety, the immediate predecessor of one of the languages that inspired C++&#x27;s design had reference-counted references built into the language. C++ was inspired in part by Simula67. Simula67&#x27;s ancestor was Simula I. Insofar as Simula I&#x27;s &quot;element&quot; is analogous to C++&#x27;s pointer without &quot;null&quot;, and insofar as Simula I&#x27;s process with a dummy-statement as its activity body is analogous to C++&#x27;s &quot;struct&quot; (which itself is analogous to C. A. R. Hoare&#x27;s &quot;record&quot; in then-contemporary 1960s work), Simula I had reference counted elements (i.e., pointer-expressions that house indirection) to processes (i.e., records) no later than September 1965, as shown in the quoted paragraphs below.

Processes can be referenced individually. Physically, a process reference is a pointer to an area of memory containing the data local to the process and some additional information defining its current state of execution. However, for reasons stated in the Section 2.2 process references are always indirect, through items called &quot;elements.&quot; Formally a reference to a process is the value of an expression of type &quot;element&quot;.&lt;br&gt;
…&lt;br&gt;
&quot;element&quot; values can be stored and retrieved by assignments and references to &quot;element&quot; variables and by other means.&lt;br&gt;
The language contains a mechanism for making the attributes of a process accessible from the outside, i.e., from within other processes. This is called remote access- ing. A process is thus a referenceable data structure.&lt;br&gt;

It is worth noticing the similarity between a process whose activity body is a dummy statement, and the record concept recently proposed by C. A. R. Hoare and N. Wirth

Because C++ borrowed Simula&#x27;s approach to memory allocationthe &quot;new&quot; keyword when allocating a process/record to obtain a fresh &quot;element&quot; to that process/recordit is not surprising that C++ eventually resurrected Simula&#x27;s reference-counted smart-pointer mechanism within &quot;element&quot; as well.

== Features ==
In C++, a smart pointer is implemented as a template class that mimics, by means of operator overloading, the behaviors of a traditional (raw) pointer, (e.g. dereferencing, assignment) while providing additional memory management features.

Smart pointers can facilitate intentional programming by expressing, in the type, how the memory of the referent of the pointer will be managed. For example, if a C++ function returns a pointer, there is no way to know whether the caller should delete the memory of the referent when the caller is finished with the information.
SomeType* AmbiguousFunction(); // What should be done with the result?
Traditionally, naming conventions have been used to resolve the ambiguity, which is an error-prone, labor-intensive approach. C++11 introduced a way to ensure correct memory management in this case by declaring the function to return a codice_1,
std::unique_ptr&lt;SomeType&gt; ObviousFunction();
The declaration of the function return type as a codice_1 makes explicit the fact that the caller takes ownership of the result, and the C++ runtime ensures that the memory will be reclaimed automatically. Before C++11, unique_ptr can be replaced with auto_ptr, which is now deprecated.

== Creating new objects ==
To ease the allocation of a std::shared_ptr&lt;SomeType&gt;C++11 introduced:
auto s = std::make_shared&lt;SomeType&gt;(constructor, parameters, here);
and similarly std::unique_ptr&lt;some_type&gt;Since C++14 one can use:
auto u = std::make_unique&lt;SomeType&gt;(constructor, parameters, here);
It is preferred, in almost all circumstances, to use these facilities over the codice_3 keyword.

== unique_ptr ==
C++11 introduces , defined in the header .

A is a container for a raw pointer, which the codice_1 is said to own. A codice_1 explicitly prevents copying of its contained pointer (as would happen with normal assignment), but the function can be used to transfer ownership of the contained pointer to another . A codice_1 cannot be copied because its copy constructor and assignment operators are explicitly deleted.
std::unique_ptr&lt;int&gt; p1(new int(5));
std::unique_ptr&lt;int&gt; p2 = p1; // Compile error.
std::unique_ptr&lt;int&gt; p3 = std::move(p1); // Transfers ownership. p3 now owns the memory and p1 is set to nullptr.

p3.reset(); // Deletes the memory.
p1.reset(); // Does nothing.
codice_7 is deprecated under C++11 and completely removed from C++17. The copy constructor and assignment operators of do not actually copy the stored pointer. Instead, they transfer it, leaving the prior object empty. This was one way to implement strict ownership, so that only one object can own the pointer at any given time. This means that should not be used where copy semantics are needed. Since already existed with its copy semantics, it could not be upgraded to be a move-only pointer without breaking backward compatibility with existing code.

== shared_ptr and weak_ptr ==
C++11 introduces and , defined in the header . C++11 also introduces ( was introduced in C++14) to safely allocate dynamic memory in the RAII paradigm.

A is a container for a raw pointer. It maintains reference counting ownership of its contained pointer in cooperation with all copies of the . An object referenced by the contained raw pointer will be destroyed when and only when all copies of the have been destroyed.
std::shared_ptr&lt;int&gt; p0(new int(5)); // Valid, allocates 1 integer and initialize it with value 5.
std::shared_ptr&lt;int[]&gt; p1(new int[5]); // Valid, allocates 5 integers.
std::shared_ptr&lt;int[]&gt; p2 = p1; // Both now own the memory.

p1.reset(); // Memory still exists, due to p2.
p2.reset(); // Frees the memory, since no one else owns the memory.
A is a container for a raw pointer. It is created as a copy of a codice_8. The existence or destruction of copies of a codice_8 have no effect on the codice_8 or its other copies. After all copies of a codice_8 have been destroyed, all codice_12 copies become empty.
std::shared_ptr&lt;int&gt; p1 = std::make_shared&lt;int&gt;(5);
std::weak_ptr&lt;int&gt; wp1 {p1}; // p1 owns the memory.
 std::shared_ptr&lt;int&gt; p2 = wp1.lock(); // Now p1 and p2 own the memory.
 // p2 is initialized from a weak pointer, so you have to check if the
 // memory still exists!
 if (p2) {
 DoSomethingWith(p2);
}
// p2 is destroyed. Memory is owned by p1.

p1.reset(); // Free the memory.

std::shared_ptr&lt;int&gt; p3 = wp1.lock(); 
// Memory is gone, so we get an empty shared_ptr.
if (p3) { // code will not execute
 ActionThatNeedsALivePointer(p3);


Because the implementation of uses reference counting, circular references are potentially a problem. A circular codice_8 chain can be broken by changing the code so that one of the references is a codice_12.

Multiple threads can safely simultaneously access different and objects that point to the same object.

The referenced object must be protected separately to ensure thread safety.

 and are based on versions used by the Boost libraries. C++ Technical Report 1 (TR1) first introduced them to the standard, as general utilities, but C++11 adds more functions, in line with the Boost version.

== Other types of smart pointers ==
There are other types of smart pointers (which are not in the C++ standard) implemented on popular C++ libraries or custom STL, some examples include hazard pointer and intrusive pointer.

<text>Wendover is a town and civil parish at the foot of the Chiltern Hills in Buckinghamshire, England. It is situated at the point where the main road across the Chilterns between London and Aylesbury intersects with the once important road along the foot of the Chilterns. The town is north west of London and south east of Aylesbury. 

The parish has an area of and had, at the time of the 2011 census, a population of 7,399. Outside Wendover, the parish is mainly arable and also contains several hamlets in the surrounding hills. Wendover has a weekly market, and has had a market charter since 1464.

== Etymology ==

The name is likely of Brythonic Celtic origin. The initial part of the name could be related to &quot;wyn&quot; or &quot;gwyn&quot;, as in modern Welsh, meaning white. The second part of the name &quot;dwr&quot; could derive from &quot;dwfr&quot; meaning &quot;water&quot;. The Brythonic ancestor to the Welsh &quot;dwr&quot; is also the etymology of the city of Dover. 

== History ==
The first known documentary reference to Wendover, then known as &quot;Wændofron&quot;, is in the will of Ælfheah, the ealdorman of Hampshire, and dates from between 965 and 971. Prior to the Norman Conquest, the manor, which at the time measured 24 hides in area, was held by Edward the Confessor. The settlement appears to have been centred some to the south of the present-day focus of the town, near the current location of the parish church of St Mary. By 1086, the manor of &quot;Wendovre&quot; was in the hundred of Aylesbury, with William the Conqueror as its tenant in chief.

The manor remained in royal ownership until 1154, and then passed back and forth between royal and private ownership several times. Wendover was granted a market charter in 1214, and had become a borough by 1228, although it does not appear to have achieved any degree of self-government. It is likely that around this time the focus moved north to its current location, allowing the market to cater to traffic on the road running along the Chilterns between Chinnor and Tring, as well as that crossing the Chilterns between London and Aylesbury. The current layout of the older parts of the town show clear signs of medieval town planning, especially the presence of long, narrow and rectilinear burgage plots.

Both parliamentary and royalist forces visited the town during the Civil War, with looting reported by both sides. Many of the buildings in the town centre, and especially on High Street, Pound Street, and Aylesbury Road, date from the 17th century. It is not known whether this is because they needed rebuilding after civil war damage, or is an indication of the prosperity of the town at the time.
In 1721, the Wendover to Buckingham Turnpike Trust was established, and Wendover became a stop for coach routes to and from London. It is likely that at this time a number of new inns and hostelries were built along the High Street. The Wendover Arm of the Grand Union Canal was built between 1793 and 1797 and served local industries whilst also providing a water supply for the parent canal. In September 1892, the railway reached the town with the opening of Wendover railway station on the Metropolitan Railway&#x27;s line to Aylesbury. Responsibility for the station was transferred from London Transport, who had inherited it from the Metropolitan Railway, to British Railways, in 1961.

The 1841 census reveal the population that year was 1,877.

Robert Louis Stevenson, the writer of famous works such as &quot;Treasure Island&quot; and the &quot;Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde&quot;, stayed a night at The Red Lion, in October 1874, which he wrote about in an essay called &quot;An Autumn Effect&quot;.

In 1913 Alfred de Rothschild invited the Royal Flying Corps to conduct manoeuvres on his land in the adjacent manor of Halton, and the land continued to be used by the British Army throughout the First World War. In 1916 the Royal Flying Corps moved its air mechanics school from Farnborough, Hampshire to Halton, and in 1917, the school was permanently accommodated there, in what was to become the current RAF Halton. Whilst the base is not in the parish of Wendover, its close proximity impacted on the town, and the surrounding landscape, due to the associated population increases and deforestation to provide wood for construction work.

In the latter part of the twentieth century, a number of large scale residential developments appeared, particularly to the north of the town. In 1998, the Wendover bypass was built, moving the A413 road west of the town centre, paralleling the railway line. Property values rose significantly in the years after the completion of the bypass, which removed a lot of traffic from the town&#x27;s narrow streets. In 2010, the proposed route the High Speed 2 rail line (HS2) from London to the Midlands was published, showing it taking a route in tunnel to the west of the bypass and town centre. As part of a wider campaign against the route, a Wendover lobby group was formed, with a 300 strong protest filmed by the BBC in December 2010. However, despite the opposition, the HS2 bill was passed in 2016. In 2017, construction contracts were signed.

In 2019, the Wendover community launched WRAP (Wendover Resettlement Assistance Project), a project in partnership with CitizensUK.

==Geography ==

Wendover lies at approximately above sea level. It occupies a prime position at the northern end of a natural crossing point through the Chiltern Hills, which wrap around the west, south and east of the town. To the north the land slopes gently downwards towards the flat, agricultural land of the Aylesbury Vale. To the west the town is overlooked by Coombe Hill () and to the east by Wendover Woods ().
The gap through the Chilterns that Wendover sits astride has long been an important communications route. It is used by the A413 road between London and Aylesbury, the London to Aylesbury railway line, and the new high speed rail link between London and the North that is now under construction. At Wendover this route is crossed by the route of the ancient Icknield Way, running along the line of the Chilterns, that has connected Wiltshire to Norfolk since prehistoric times.

Besides the town itself, the civil parish includes the hamlets of: 
*Dean, located south of Wendover on Smalldean Lane between the hamlets of Smalldean and Little London.
*Kings Ash or Kingsash, located south-south east of Wendover on the Chesham Lane between the A413 road and the hamlet of Lee Gate.
*Little London, located south of Wendover on Smalldean Lane between the hamlet of Dean and the village of Dunsmore.
*Lower Bacombe, located south of Wendover on the lane between the main town and Upper Bacombe.
*Smalldean, located south of Wendover on Smalldean Lane, between the southernmost roundabout of the Wendover bypass and the hamlet of Dean.
*The Hale, located east of Wendover along Hale Lane.
*Upper Bacombe, located south-south west of Wendover on Bacombe Hill, close of the parish boundary.
*Wendover Dean, located south of Wendover on the A413 road, between Cobblershill Lane and Bowood Lane.

== Governance ==

Wendover was represented by its own parliamentary constituency, intermittently from 1300 and continuously from 1660, until the seat was abolished by the Reform Act of 1832. The town and parish now form part of the Aylesbury parliamentary constituency. This seat had elected a Conservative Member of Parliament from 1924 until 2024, when the seat was won by Laura Kyrke-Smith of the Labour Party.

There are two tiers of local government covering Wendover, at parish and unitary authority level: Wendover Parish Council and Buckinghamshire Council. The parish council is based at the Clock Tower on High Street.

==Economy==
Facilities in the town centre include a post office, several hairdressers, a community library (run by volunteers), multiple delis and cafés, a pharmacy and a charity shop. There is a weekly open market on Thursdays.

Wendover&#x27;s pubs include The Red Lion, The George &amp; Dragon, The White Swan, The King and Queen, The Pack Horse, and The Shoulder of Mutton. The Red Lion pub was home to &#x27;Britain&#x27;s Oldest Barmaid&#x27;, 100-year-old Dolly Saville, who worked at the pub for 74 years.

==Landmarks==

There are 113 listed buildings in Wendover, of which five are listed at the higher grade II* and the remainder are all listed at grade II. The five grade II* buildings are the parish church, the lychgate of that church, Bank Farmhouse, the Hale and the Red House.

There is a distinctive red brick, spired clock tower at the junction of High Street and Tring Road in the centre of the town, built in 1842. The ground floor of the tower serves as the office of the parish council. The tree-lined Aylesbury Street includes the 16th-century timber framed Chiltern House and 18th-century Red House.

To the north of the town centre is the terminus of the Wendover Arm of the Grand Union Canal, which joins Tring summit level of the Grand Union main line beside Marsworth top lock. Disused for over a century, the arm is in the course of being restored by the Wendover Arm Trust. Remote and rural for almost all its length, the canal attracts much local wildlife, including a colony of mandarin ducks. It is possible to walk along the canal for about from the centre of Wendover, to Tring.
To the south of town centre lie the open spaces of Witchell Meadow, Hampden Meadow and Rope Walk Meadow, the latter hosting the new Wendover Community Orchard in memory of the First World War. These are bounded to the east by the Heron Stream and to the south by Hampden Pond, both feeders to the canal. On the southern side of the pond lies Wendover&#x27;s parish church, which is dedicated to St Mary, and which marks the site of the original settlement.
The town is sited in a gap in the Chiltern Hills and a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The ancient Ridgeway National Trail, an 85-mile walking route from Avebury to Ivinghoe, passes along Wendover High Street. Apart from the Ridgeway Trail there are 33 miles of public rights of way and bridleways criss-crossing the parish and leading to the open chalk downland of Coombe Hill, Buckinghamshire, home to Britain&#x27;s longest surviving geocache, and a monument to the Buckinghamshire men who died in the Boer War. Wendover Woods on Haddington Hill and Boddington Hill belong to Forest Enterprise England. There are routes for mountain bikers, and walking trails for walkers of various abilities as well as barbecue sites and play areas for children. On Boddington Hill are the remains of an Iron Age hill fort, Boddington Camp.

Wendover and the surrounding villages including Aston Clinton, Ellesborough and Weston Turville, are widely regarded as exceptionally desirable places to reside and the town was named one of the best places to live in Britain by &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; in 2018.

==Transport==
The town has rail access to London and is served by Wendover station which is served by Chiltern Railways services to and from London Marylebone on the London to Aylesbury Line.

Wendover has two bus routes passing through it: the 8 travels between Aylesbury and RAF Halton and the 55 travels between Aylesbury and Chesham. The 8 is run by Arriva, and the 55 is run by Red Rose Travel.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are BBC South and ITV Meridian. Television signals are received from the Oxford TV transmitter. 

Local radio stations are BBC Three Counties Radio, Heart East (formerly 97.6 Chiltern FM), Greatest Hits Radio Bucks, Beds and Herts (formerly Mix 96) and Red Kite Radio, a community based radio station that broadcast from Aylesbury. 

The town is served by the local newspapers, Bucks Herald, Bucks Free Press and Wendover News. 

==Education==
There are four schools in the town: 
* The John Hampden School, named after politician and English Civil War participant John Hampden, a community infant school with about 275 pupils aged 4–7,

Maccabi Haifa is one of the &quot;Big Four&quot; clubs in Israeli football. The meaning of the name Maccabi – &#x27;there is no one like you among the gods&#x27; – also refers to the Star of David in the team&#x27;s logo. The side has won fifteen league titles, second only to the club&#x27;s biggest rivals, Maccabi Tel Aviv, six State Cups and five Toto Cups. Maccabi Haifa has won the championship and the cup in the same season (referred to as winning the &quot;double&quot;) once, and was the first Israeli club to qualify for the group stage of the UEFA Champions League, in the 2002–03 UEFA Champions League season.

In 2020–21, Maccabi Haifa won the Israeli Premier League, their first championship in a decade. The club won the next two titles on their way to three consecutive championships.

Maccabi Haifa is currently coached by Barak Bakhar, who returned to the team after a short journey in the Serbian League, the same coach the led the club to three league titles in a row along with qualification for the Champions League group stages in 2022.

==History==

===Early years===
Maccabi Haifa Football Club was established in 1913 in the port city of Haifa in the Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem (present-day Israel). As the local football association wasn&#x27;t founded in Mandatory Palestine until July 1928, there were no officially organized competitions during the season, and the club played only friendly matches.

After a period of inactivity, the club was re-organized in February 1923. The club playing a handful of matches during the season, including taking part in a cup competition which was called &quot;The Hebrew Cup&quot;. Due to its distance, the club was given a bye to the final, which it lost to Maccabi Nes Tziona 0–2.

The club was overshadowed by its city rival Hapoel Haifa, but even in its first years adopted a very adventurous and offensive style of play based on technique and short passes.

In 1942, the club reached the Israel State Cup final, but was defeated 12–1 by Beitar Tel Aviv in the final.
Maccabi Haifa remained a small, struggling club that spent most of its time shifting between Liga Leumit and the lower leagues.

In 1962, the team defeated Maccabi Tel Aviv 5–2 in the State Cup final, and won the first title of the club. In 1963 it reached the final again, but lost to Hapoel Haifa 1–0 in the first Haifa derby in State Cup final.

===The 1980s===
In the 1980s Maccabi Haifa finally entered the &#x27;Israeli&#x27; champions&#x27; club, clinching the title thrice (in 1983–84, 1984–85 and 1988–89 seasons).

In the 1983–84 season Maccabi Haifa won its first ever championship, under coach Shlomo Sharf and general manager Yochanan Vollach, overcoming Beitar Jerusalem and Hapoel Tel Aviv. The &quot;Yerukim&quot; (Greens) were known for their &quot;all-around-offense&quot; and flashy technique football style, often resulting in bad defensive formation and resultant losses.

Sharf&#x27;s team played with 4 strikers, including: Moshe Selecter, Zahi Armeli and Ronny Rosenthal who were positioned at point and midfield and managed to build their defense around the legendary goalkeeper Avi Ran.

A year later, Maccabi Haifa won a second championship in a decisive performance. In 1986 Maccabi Haifa lost the championship in a controversial final match against runners-up Hapoel Tel Aviv. The single goal scored in that match by Gili Landau was said to be scored from a passive offside position, which by the rules of the time should have resulted in a disqualification of the goal and a scoreless draw, guaranteeing Maccabi Haifa the title. Due to poor TV coverage, the issue has never been resolved.

In 1988, Maccabi Haifa decimated Maccabi Tel Aviv 10–0 to earn its biggest win ever. That game, one of the more famous in Israeli&#x27;s football lore, wasn&#x27;t even televised. Furthermore, it probably was the beginning of the intense rivalry between the two clubs. In 1989, under the capable hands of Amazzia Levkovic, the club won another championship.

===The 1990s===

In the 1990s Maccabi Haifa established itself as a dominant club in Israel. It began by winning the Double – League championship and the national cup in the 1990–1 season and continued with the introduction of three talented young players: Eyal Berkovic, Reuven Atar and Tal Banin.

In 1992, Maccabi Haifa was purchased by Ya&#x27;akov Shahar, who became the owner and president of the club. Under Shahar&#x27;s management, Maccabi Haifa enjoyed financial stability and professional working regulations on a par with European football clubs&#x27; standards. Maccabi Haifa&#x27;s highlight season was 1993–94. After winning the 1993 cup, Maccabi Haifa gave a stunning performance in the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup (CWC), beating Torpedo Moscow 3–1 and Parma 1–0 in the last 16, only to lose on penalties. During the season in the domestic league (then called Liga Leumit), the team became the first and only in Israeli football history to go unbeaten for the entire season, with an overall unbeaten streak of 48 games, thus winning a spectacular championship, and breaking many Israeli records. The Maccabi Haifa 1993–94 squad including Eyal Berkovic, Reuven Atar, Alon Mizrahi and Serhiy Kandaurov, and is considered one of, if not the best squads in Israeli football history.

In 1995, Maccabi Haifa begun a period of seven years without winning the league championship, and most of its popular soccer superstar were sold to Europe. In 1996, Eyal Berkovic and Haim Revivo, the latter had joined the team the previous season, both left Haifa for European clubs. While the two gained great personal success there, Maccabi Haifa went into a slump. The team&#x27;s standards of maintaining the services of the manager for multiple seasons was thrown as the team went through several managers during 4 years. As result, the team failed to win the national championship title, despite securing the National cup in 1998.

In 1999, under the guidance of the Czech manager Dušan Uhrin, Maccabi Haifa beat French giants Paris Saint-Germain and Austrian club SV Ried to reach the quarter-final of the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup. In the middle of the season, Haifa&#x27;s excellent striker Alon Mizrahi left for French club Nice resulting in a defeat in the CWC quarter-final and a slump in the club&#x27;s league performance. The club&#x27;s winning record continued to falter until the arrival of Avram Grant.

===2000 and beyond===
Former Maccabi Tel Aviv Manager Avram Grant was appointed in 2000 as manager of Maccabi Haifa. Under Grant&#x27;s guidance, the team regained its dominating offensive style. Grant, along with a much improved squad, led the club with an almost unstoppable team, winning the championship. At the center of attention were a series of virtuoso performances by Yossi Benayoun, including what some consider to be several of the finest goals in Israeli league history. A spontaneous burst of celebrating fans onto the pitch caused a tragic disaster. A young fan, Amir Rand, was crushed against the guarding rails and left comatose.

A year later, Grant won a second championship, relying on a veteran Israeli defense: Alon Harazi, Arik Benado and Adoram Keise, and on a trio of foreign footballers: Giovanni Rosso (Croatia), Raimondas Žutautas (Lithuania) and the young Nigerian striker Yakubu. Following the 2nd championship, Avraham Grant left Haifa for the Israeli national team and was replaced by then Israel U-21 manager Itzhak Shum.

In 2002, Haifa made Israeli club history by becoming the first Israeli team to qualify for the group phase of the UEFA Champions League. In the group phase, the team defeated Olympiacos and Manchester United. Haifa managed 7 points overall scoring 12 goals, and finished in 3rd place, securing a place in the UEFA Cup.

In the 2003–04 season Maccabi Haifa, led by ex-Maccabi Haifa footballer Ronny Levy, won the championship mainly due to the poor showing of the other league teams. Maccabi Haifa youth club (ages 16–18) won the domestic championship, and an Israel national kids team of Maccabi Haifa players won Fox Kids World Cup for 12-year-olds.

History was made during the 2005–06 season. After months of indecision regarding the contract of Ronny Levy, it was renewed and Levy guided the club to 11 straight victories in the first 11 games of the Israeli Premier League season. This was also the key to Maccabi Haifa taking the league title after building a strong lead. While the club enjoyed great domestic success, it was not as fortunate in European play. Though Haifa was a seeded team for the UEFA Champions League second qualifying round, it drew the strong Swedish club, Malmö FF. Haifa lost 3–2 in Sweden, and drew 2–2 at home.

In the 2006–07 season, the club played against Liverpool.
In the 1st game of the 3rd round of the qualifying matches held in England, Haifa&#x27;s Gustavo Boccoli scored on the 29th minute, an advantage that lasted just 4 minutes. Craig Bellamy evened the score and in front of 40,000 local fans, Haifa stood bravely up to the 88th minute when Mark González scored the winning goal for the hosts. Due to the security situation in Israel, the return match was not held in Ramat Gan but in Kyiv, Ukraine, at the Valery Lobanovsky stadium, with 1,700 spectators. The game ended in a 1–1 tie. The last twenty minutes of the game were stressful for Rafa Benitez&#x27;s players. After Peter Crouch gave the guests the advantage (54) and an away goal, but Roberto Colautti (63) tied the score and from here on the movement towards the host&#x27;s goalpost became one-sided. The tie score sent Haifa to compete in the UEFA Cup.

In the return match in Bulgaria against Litex Lovech, Haifa played well: Xavier Dirceu scored an impressive goal from distance, Alain Masudi and Roberto Colautti left Eljendario Sanderinio one honor goal. In the group stage, Haifa faced strong opponents: The Scottish Rangers, the Serbian Partizan Belgrade, the French Auxerre and the Italian Serie A team Livorno. In the 88th minute, the Scots succeeded in doubling the score from another penalty kick given away by a Haifa defender. This time Charlie Adam scored and sealed the victory. Haifa returned home and hosted Partizan Belgrade. An early goal by Anderson Xavier, the Brazilian midfielder, put Haifa in an excellent place with six points. Haifa needed one point in the away game in Italy against Livorno to complete the task successfully. At this stage Haifa was drawn against CSKA Moscow. The game was moved to the Spartak stadium in Vladikavkaz due to extreme weather in Moscow. 30,000 Russian fans crowded the stadium. Torpedo beat Haifa 1–0 and Lokomotiv beat it 3–0. Again Haifa did not score an away goal, but the result (0–0) signaled that Haifa might use its home advantage in the return match.

In the 2007–08 season, Maccabi Haifa finished 5th place in the league and was eliminated in the last-16 phase of the State Cup. Ronny Levy announced that he was leaving. Haifa won the Toto Cup after a 2–0 victory over Bnei-Sakhnin.

Haifa opened the 2008–09 season with hopes of remaining a top team. At the end of the season, coach Elisha Levy won his first personal title and Haifa made Israeli soccer history, winning six championships in one decade.
Maccabi Haifa returned to the Champions League for the 2009–10 season. A 3–0 win over FC Red Bull Salzburg ensured its second win in the span of seven years, with goals by Dvalishvili, Golasa and Ghadir. Haifa entered the 2009–10 Champions League group stage in Group A, competing against Bayern Munich, Juventus and Bordeaux. Haifa finished the competition with a record of 6 losses, conceding 8 goals and without scoring. The club subsequently lost the championship title to Hapoel Tel Aviv on the last day of the season.

In the 2010–11 Israeli Premier League season, Maccabi Haifa has won the Israeli Championship title but lost the chance to achieve the Double by losing to rivals Hapoel Tel Aviv in the State Cup final.

The 2011–12 season was a disappointing one. After winning the League title in the previous season, the team started the season with qualification
matches in the UEFA Champions League, but eliminated after a penalty defeat to the Belgian club Genk.
Domestically, it was another disappointment. Maccabi Haifa struggled for the European football spot, and a draw
in the last round wasn&#x27;t enough, as Maccabi Haifa finished in a disappointing 5th place.
Another failure was at the State Cup as the team lost in the Final to rivals Hapoel Tel Aviv from a controversial 93rd-minute goal.
The disappointing season caused owner Ya&#x27;akov Shahar to appoint former player and club icon Reuven Atar as the manager for the next season instead of Elisha Levi, who left the club after clinching 2 championship titles in 4 years with the club.

With Reuven Atar on the sidelines, Haifa opened the season with 1 win, 4 draws, and 4 losses and was next to last, the worst start in club history. After the 9th round, Atar was fired and replaced by Arik Benado, the youth team coach and former team captain. Under Benado, Haifa returned to the top of the table and showed good performances during the season. Haifa gave fight to Maccabi Tel Aviv but finished 2nd.

On 25 July 2013, Maccabi Haifa defeated Khazar Lankaran 8–0 in the 2nd qualifying round of UEFA Europa League. thus setting a new record for the largest win by an Israeli club in European competition.

On 24 May 2016, Maccabi Haifa defeated Maccabi Tel Aviv 1–0 in the Israel State Cup Final, winning for the 1st time in 18 years and, thus, returning to European competition after 3 years.
In the start of the 2020/21 season, Maccabi Haifa reached the UEFA Europa League play-off round, beating Kairat Almaty and FC Rostov in the qualifying rounds. In the play-off round, the team lost 2–7 to Tottenham Hotspur, its biggest defeat ever in the tournament, and were eliminated.
On 30 May 2021, after 10 long tough years full of disappointments for the club and its fans, Maccabi Haifa has won the Israeli Premier league championship, its 13th in total, defeating Hapoel Be&#x27;er Sheva 3–2 in the final fixture. Haifa&#x27;s players Josh Cohen, Neta Lavi and Dolev Haziza won the league MVP titles, awarded by 3 major Israeli football organizations. Josh Cohen was voted footballer of the year, and the team&#x27;s coach, Barak Bakhar, won the &quot;coach of the year&quot; title unequivocally.

In the start of the 2021/22 season, the team was eliminated by Kairat in the early qualifying rounds of the UEFA Champions League. Two weeks later, the team won the 2021 Israel Super Cup, after a 2–0 victory against the state cup winner Maccabi Tel Aviv. Despite its early elimination from the Champions League qualifiers, the team entered the Europa Conference League qualifiers, and qualified to the group stage after beating Neftci Baku in the play-off round. The team finished the UEFA Europa Conference League group stage in third place and did not advance to the knockout phase.

The club went on to win the league cup, and at the end of the season it won the 2021-22 Israeli Premier League championship, its second championship title in a row and 14th in total. Omer Atzili finished as the top scorer (20 goals) and top assister (10 assists), and was voted footballer of the year. The team reached the Israel State Cup final, but lost to Hapoel Be&#x27;er Sheva in a penalty shoot-out, and lost to Hapoel Be&#x27;er Sheva in penalty shoot-out again in the 2022 Israel Super Cup.

In August 2022 the club advanced to the UEFA Champions League group stage for the third time in its history, after beating Olympiacos and Apollon Limassol in the qualifying rounds, and beating Red Star Belgrade in the play-off round. In the group stage, the club was drawn into Group H with European giants Paris Saint-Germain, Juventus and Benfica. In matchday 2, Maccabi Haifa scored its first UEFA Champions League goal in 20 years, when Tjaronn Chery scored the opener against Paris Saint-Germain, a match which ended in a 1–3 loss. In matchday 4, Maccabi Haifa beat Juventus 2–0. In matchday 5, the team suffered a 7–2 defeat to Paris Saint-Germain, its biggest defeat ever in the tournament, and were eliminated.

On 15 May 2023, the team won the 2022–23 Israeli Premier League championship, the club&#x27;s third championship title in a row and 15th in total, after a 1–5 victory over Maccabi Netanya, and became the first Israeli club to do so in a season which it also reached the UEFA Champions League group stage.

==Sponsorships, fan base and rivalries==

The club is sponsored by Ya&#x27;akov Shahar, chairman of Mayer&#x27;s Cars and Trucks Ltd., the official importer to Israel of Volvo and Honda. The fan base is mainly in Haifa and northern Israel, although the club is one of the most popular in Israel. Average attendance in the home matches since the move to Sammy Ofer Stadium in 2015 is approximately 24,000 fans, the most in Israel.
According to a survey which had been conducted in 2010, Maccabi Haifa has the biggest number of fans of all the teams in Israel, approximately 25.8% of Israeli football fans. 2

Another survey had been conducted in March 2012 by Yedioth confirmed that Maccabi Haifa is the most popular team among Israeli football fans (28%), female football fans (33%) and Arab citizens of Israel. Same survey revealed that 75% of Haifa residents support the team.

Historically, the most loyal fans at home games in Kiryat Eliezer Stadium were concentrated at stands 11–12, called also &quot;Yetzia Gimel (יציע ג&#x27;)&quot; – C Block – a term which has become synonymous with the most hardcore and dedicated fans.

In 1994, Uzi Hitman composed and wrote the team&#x27;s championship song titled &quot;Green in the eyes&quot; (ירוק בעיניים) and gave it to Haim Moshe, the song was a major hit amongst the club&#x27;s fanbase and was later covered by Eden Ben Zaken in 2021 once again as a championship song. In 2004, following Hitman&#x27;s death, a minute of silence was given to Hitman during a match against Bnei Yehuda Tel Aviv, which was followed by supporters singing the chorus of the famous championship song.

In 2002, The fans established an organization named Green Apes, which supports both soccer and basketball. Members usually sit in the bleachers section 11.

In addition, Maccabi Haifa has an official fan club which was founded in the first decade of the 21st century, and has about 20,000 members. The club is also supported overseas and is able to keep in touch with supporters overseas via the club website and online store.

===City rivalry with Hapoel Haifa===

===The rivalry with Maccabi Tel Aviv===

The strong rivalry between the two Israeli football clubs (sometimes called “the Israeli Classico” and “the derby of Israel”) is about the dominance among the various Maccabi football clubs, as well as in Israeli football in general, and the title of the best football club in Israel.

Maccabi Haifa aspires to oust Maccabi Tel Aviv from this position, which is the club with the largest number of titles in Israel, and to become the leading club in Israel by winning many titles and qualifying for the European Cup stages (Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, UEFA Cup). Haifa and Tel Aviv have competed against each other for the championship title, and Haifa beat Maccabi Tel Aviv in a number of games, including a 10–0 win in 1988 - a game seen as a &quot;revenge&quot; for the loss of 2–10 in 1949 (another large defeat, at 0–7, took place in 1952). Haifa beat Tel Aviv 5–0 in the 1993–94 season (in which Haifa won the championship without a single defeat, but was eliminated from the State Cup competition three days later following Maccabi Tel Aviv&#x27;s 1–1 draw at Kiryat Eliezer). Maccabi Haifa became dominant in the Israeli Premier League in the first decade of the 21st century, as Maccabi Tel Aviv&#x27;s positions weakened (except for the 2002–03 season). The rivalry between them somewhat cooled down at the end of that decade due to the renewed rise of Hapoel Tel Aviv, which competed at the top of the table during this period and won several championship titles. The rivalry focus thus briefly shifted to Hapoel Tel Aviv.

In the 2019–20 season, the rivalry between the two heated up once again, as after almost a decade of Macabbi Tel Aviv&#x27;s dominance exacerbated by Maccabi Haifa&#x27;s series of failures, the teams competed head-to-head for the championship. It ended with Maccabi Tel Aviv winning that year&#x27;s campaign. In the following 2020–21 season, the two teams battled out for the league title once again, this time ending with Maccabi Haifa winning the championship. During the past few years, the two have produced some unforgettable matches, including a dramatic 4–3 win for Maccabi Tel Aviv and an incredible 3–2 win for Maccabi Haifa after a big comeback.

== Club crest ==
The origin of the club crest is the World Zionist sports organization &quot;Maccabi&quot;. The basis of the crest is the stylized Hebrew word מכבי (&quot;Maccabi&quot;) in the shape of the Star of David, symbolizing Judaism. This is in common with most other Maccabi teams in Israel and worldwide, which all use this symbol in one way or another. In most years only this stylized &quot;Maccabi&quot; star with the word חיפה (&quot;Haifa&quot;) beneath it was the emblem of the club. Depending on the kit, it was green on white or white on green. With the success of the club at the end of the 1980s, an image of a lion was added next to the symbol, but this figure was removed later. At the beginning of the 1990s, after the club began competing in the European arena, the crest assumed its modern form - the image of a football inside a circular green band with the words מכבי חיפה מכ (&quot;Maccabi Haifa FC&quot;) in Hebrew and English on it, with the original Maccabi symbol at the top right corner. At the end of 2005/2006 season, when the team won its 10th championship, a gold star was added above the symbol. At the end of the 2009 season winning its 11th championship, the team played its inaugural game with the traditional symbol of the club as it was in the early &#x27;80s. At the end of the 2013 season (on the 100th anniversary of the club&#x27;s foundation), laurel leaves were temporarily added around the emblem, symbolizing victory and glory. In addition, a golden plaque was added indicating the year of the establishment of the club and the current year (100th club).
After the 2019/20 season, the Israel Football Association administration decided that each championship star on the member clubs&#x27; crests should represent 5 championship titles. Since Maccabi has won 12 championships in total until then, the crest was updated with another championship star. After winning its 15th championship title at the end of the 2022-23 Israeli Premier League season, the club added a third star to its crest.

==Grounds==

===Kiryat Eliezer Stadium===
Maccabi Haifa originally played in Kiryat Haim, which is the main training grounds of Hapoel Haifa. In 1955, a gift from the Italian Labour Union was a football pitch in the heart of the city of Haifa, which would become the new home of Maccabi Haifa. The opening match was a Haifa derby, won by Maccabi Haifa 4–1 over Hapoel Haifa.

Kiryat Eliezer missed out on staging a historic event when Maccabi Haifa reached the group stage of the UEFA Champions League. It was the first time an Israeli club had made it that far in the competition, though the lucrative gate receipts expected to have been made by hosting matches in Israel were lost when UEFA forced Maccabi Haifa to look for an alternative in Europe but outside of Israel because of security concerns. The choice was to host the matches at Neo GSP Stadium in Nicosia, Cyprus.
After Israel had increased the security and proved stability, Maccabi Haifa was allowed to play their European matches in the State of Israel. Because Kiryat Eliezer was not up to par with UEFA&#x27;s demands, the team played their European home matches in Tel Aviv District at Bloomfield Stadium, as well as Ramat Gan Stadium due to the high demand of Maccabi Haifa fans wanting to attend the matches. Finally, Maccabi Haifa was allowed to host European matches at Kiryat Eliezer Stadium. In 2013, Maccabi Haifa played in the Europa League against PAOK (Greece), AZ Alkmaar (Netherlands), and Shakhter Karagandy (Kazakhstan).

On 14 May 2014, the last match was played in the stadium, in which Maccabi Haifa hosted Maccabi Tel Aviv in the Israeli Premier League.

===Sammy Ofer Stadium===

Due to the recent success of the club in European competitions, the municipality of Haifa offered the club land by the beach for a brand new stadium at the southern entrance to the city. In the fall of 2008, the final plans were approved. Sammy Ofer Stadium was completed in November 2013. Constructions costs are estimated $135,000,000.00 with a seating capacity of 30,942.
The stadium is named after naval-mogul Sammy Ofer, who donated $20,000,000 to build the stadium and the rights to name it after himself. The Sammy Ofer Stadium is developed and built by the Haifa Economic Corporation and managed by Adv. Gal Peleg. It is the home ground of Maccabi Haifa, Hapoel Haifa. It also hosts the international matches of the Israel national football team along with Teddy Stadium.
===Kfar Galim Training Facility===
Kfar Galim training facility is a training ground for Maccabi Haifa. It is located in Kfar Galim village.

<doc id="319881" wikidata="Q676191" url="?curid=319881" title="Vaginitis">
<text>Vaginitis, also known as vulvovaginitis, is inflammation of the vagina and vulva. Symptoms may include itching, burning, pain, discharge, and a bad smell. Certain types of vaginitis may result in complications during pregnancy.
The three main causes are infections, specifically bacterial vaginosis, vaginal yeast infection, and trichomoniasis. Other causes include allergies to substances such as spermicides or soaps or as a result of low estrogen levels during breast-feeding or after menopause. More than one cause may exist at a time. The common causes vary by age. Prepubescent girls are often at risk for development of vulvovaginitis because of low amounts of estrogen and an underdeveloped labia minora.
Diagnosis generally include examination, measuring the pH, and culturing the discharge. Other causes of symptoms such as inflammation of the cervix, pelvic inflammatory disease, cancer, foreign bodies, and skin conditions should be ruled out.
Treatment depends on the underlying cause. Infections should be treated. Sitz baths may help with symptoms. Soaps and feminine hygiene products such as sprays should not be used. About a third of women have vaginitis at some point in time. Women of reproductive age are most often affected.

==Signs and symptoms==

A woman may have vaginal irritation, itching, or burning or may notice a foul-smelling or abnormal discharge that could appear green or yellow.

The following signs or symptoms may indicate the presence of infection:

*Irritation or itching of the genital area
*inflammation (irritation, redness, and swelling caused by the presence of extra immune cells) of the labia majora, labia minora, or perineal area
*vaginal discharge
*foul vaginal odor
*pain/irritation with sexual intercourse

===Complications===
Vaginal infections left untreated can lead to further complications, especially for the pregnant woman. For bacterial vaginosis, these include &quot;premature delivery, postpartum infections, clinically apparent and subclinical pelvic inflammatory disease, [as well as] postsurgical complications (after abortion, hysterectomy, caesarian section), increased vulnerability to HIV infection and, possibly, infertility&quot;. Studies have also linked trichomoniasis with increased likelihood of acquiring HIV; theories include that &quot;vaginitis increases the number of immune cells at the site of infection, and HIV then infects those immune cells.&quot; Other theories suggest that trichomoniasis increases the amount of HIV genital shedding, thereby increasing the risk of transmission to sexual partners. While the exact association between trichomoniasis infection and HIV genital shedding has not been consistently demonstrated, &quot;there is good evidence that TV treatment reduces HIV genital shedding. Five studies were reported in the literature and, of these, four found a decrease in HIV genital shedding after TV treatment.&quot;

Further, there are complications which lead to daily discomfort such as:

* persistent discomfort
* superficial skin infection (from scratching)
* complications of the causative condition (such as gonorrhea and candida infection)

==Causes==
===Infection===
Vaginitis is often caused by an infection or the disruption of the healthy vaginal flora. The vaginal flora consists of those organisms which generally do not cause symptoms and is dominated mainly by &quot;Lactobacillus&quot; species. Disruption of the normal flora can cause a vaginal yeast infection. Vaginal yeast infection can affect women of all ages and is very common. The yeast &quot;Candida albicans&quot; is the most common cause of vaginitis. Specific forms of vaginal inflammation include the following types:

Infectious vaginitis accounts for 90% of all cases in reproductive age women:
* Candidiasis: vaginitis caused by proliferation of &quot;Candida albicans&quot;, &quot;Candida tropicalis&quot;, &quot;Candida krusei&quot;
* Bacterial vaginosis: vaginitis caused by increased growth of &quot;Gardnerella&quot; (a bacterium).
* Aerobic vaginitis

Other less common infections are caused by gonorrhea, chlamydia, &quot;Mycoplasma&quot;, herpes, &quot;Campylobacter&quot;, improper hygiene, and some parasites, notably &quot;Trichomonas vaginalis&quot;. Rare cases of amebic vaginitis have been reported, primarily in tropical, developing countries. Women who have diabetes develop infectious vaginitis more often than women who do not.

Further, either a change in pH balance or introduction of foreign bacteria in the vagina can lead to infectious vaginitis. Physical factors that have been claimed to contribute to the development of infections include the following: constantly wet vulva due to tight clothing, chemicals coming in contact with the vagina via scented tampons, antibiotics, birth control pills, or a diet favoring refined sugar and yeast.

===Hormonal===
Hormonal vaginitis includes atrophic vaginitis usually found in postmenopausal women.

===Irritation/allergy===
Irritant vaginitis can be caused by allergies or reactions to vaginal sprays, douches, spermicides, soaps, detergents, or fabric softeners. It can also be caused by hot tubs, abrasion, tissue, tampons, or topical medications.

Foreign body vaginitis (most common foreign bodies are retained tampons or condoms) may cause extremely malodorous vaginal discharges. Treatment consists of removal, for which ring forceps may be useful. Further treatment is generally not necessary.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is typically suspected based on a women&#x27;s symptoms. Diagnosis is made with microscopy (mostly by vaginal wet mount) and culture of the discharge after a careful history and physical examination have been completed. The color, consistency, acidity, and other characteristics of the discharge may be predictive of the causative agent. Determining the agent is especially important because women may have more than one infection, or have symptoms that overlap those of another infection, which dictates different treatment processes to cure the infection. For example, women often self-diagnose for yeast infections but due to the 89% misdiagnosis rate, self-diagnoses of vaginal infections are highly discouraged.

Another type of vaginitis, called desquamative inflammatory vaginitis (DIV) also exists. The cause behind this type is still poorly understood. DIV corresponds to the severe forms of aerobic vaginitis. About 5 to 10% of women are affected by aerobic vaginitis.

The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems codes for the several causes of vaginitis are:

==Prevention==
Prevention of candidiasis, the most common type of vaginitis, includes using loose cotton underwear. The vaginal area should be washed with water. Perfumed soaps, shower gels, and vaginal deodorants should be avoided. Douching is not recommended. The practice upsets the normal balance of yeast in the vagina and does more harm than good.

Prevention of bacterial vaginosis includes healthy diets and behaviors as well as minimizing stress as all these factors can affect the pH balance of the vagina.

Prevention of trichomoniasis revolves around avoiding other people&#x27;s wet towels and hot tubs, and safe-sex procedures, such as condom use.
Some women consume good bacteria in food with live culture, such as yogurt, sauerkraut and kimchi, or in probiotic supplements either to try to prevent candidiasis, or to reduce the likelihood of developing bacterial vaginitis following antibiotic treatment. There is no firm evidence to suggest that eating live yogurt or taking probiotic supplements will prevent candidiasis.

Studies have suggested a possible clinical role for the use of standardized oral or vaginal probiotics in the treatment of bacterial vaginosis, either in addition to or in place of the typical antibiotic regimens. However, recent articles question their efficacy in preventing recurrence compared with other means, or conclude that there is insufficient evidence for or against recommending probiotics for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis.

==Treatment==
The cause of the infection determines the appropriate treatment. It may include oral or topical antibiotics and/or antifungal creams, antibacterial creams, or similar medications. A cream containing cortisone may also be used to relieve some of the irritation. If an allergic reaction is involved, an antihistamine may also be prescribed. For women who have irritation and inflammation caused by low levels of estrogen (postmenopausal), a topical estrogen cream might be prescribed.

The following are typical treatments for trichomoniasis, bacterial vaginosis, and yeast infections:

* Trichomoniasis: Oral treatment with either metronidazole or tinidazole. &quot;Sexual partner(s) should be treated simultaneously. Patients should be advised to avoid sexual intercourse for at least 1 week and until they and their partner(s) have completed treatment and follow-up.&quot;
* Bacterial vaginosis: The most commonly used antibiotics are metronidazole, available in both pill and gel form, and clindamycin available in both pill and cream form.
* Yeast infections: Local azole, in the form of ovula and cream. All agents appear to be equally effective. These anti-fungal medications, which are available in over the counter form, are generally used to treat yeast infections. Treatment may last anywhere between one, three, or seven days.

===Aerobic vaginitis===

Treatment can include topical steroids to diminish the inflammation. Antibiotics to diminish the proportion of aerobic bacteria is still a matter of debate. The use of local antibiotics, preferably local non-absorbed and broad spectrum, covering enteric gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes, can be an option. In some cases, systemic antibiotics can be helpful, such as amoxicillin/clavulanate or moxifloxacin. Vaginal rinsing with povidone iodine can provide relief of symptoms but does not provide long-term reduction of bacterial loads. Dequalinium chloride can also be an option for treatment.

===Mixed infectious vaginitis===
Mixed infectious vaginitis is a condition caused by multiple pathogens, leading to significant alterations in the vaginal environment, including a decrease in lactic acid bacteria, an increase in vaginal pH, and a reduction in local defenses. The term &quot;mixed&quot; refers to the involvement of multiple pathogens in causing the condition. The female vagina hosts a diverse array of over 50 different microorganisms that interact and coexist in a complex microecological environment. When the balance among these microorganisms is disrupted, it can lead to mixed infectious vaginitis, with the specific pathogens involved varying based on individual cases and environmental factors. This condition often results in distressing symptoms like vulvar itching, burning pain, and urethral irritation, and can be complicated by increasing drug resistance and recurrence rates, particularly in patients with ineffective treatment, long-term contraceptive use, or compromised sexual hygiene. Mixed infectious vaginitis is a condition characterized by the simultaneous infection of two or more types of pathogens, which may include Chlamydia, Mycoplasma, anaerobic bacteria, and aerobic bacteria. Additionally, this mixed infection can also involve yeast, further contributing to the complexity of the condition.

An effective treatment option for mixed infectious vaginitis is a combination of clotrimazole and metronidazole.

== In children ==
Vulvovaginitis in children may be &quot;nonspecific&quot;, or caused by irritation with no known infectious cause, or infectious, caused by a pathogenic organism. Nonspecific vulvovaginitis may be triggered by fecal contamination, sexual abuse, chronic diseases, foreign bodies, nonestrogenized epithelium, chemical irritants, eczema, seborrhea, or immunodeficiency. It is treated with topical steroids; antibiotics may be given in cases where itching has resulted in a secondary infection.

Infectious vulvovaginitis can be caused by group A beta-hemolytic &quot;Streptococcus&quot; (7-20% of cases), &quot;Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Shigella, Yersinia&quot;, or common STI organisms (&quot;Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Trichomonas vaginalis&quot;, herpes simplex virus, and human papillomavirus)&quot;.&quot; Symptoms and treatment of infectious vulvovaginitis vary depending on the organism causing it. &quot;Shigella&quot; infections of the reproductive tract usually coexist with infectious of the gastrointestinal tract and cause mucous, purulent discharge. They are treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. &quot;Streptococcus&quot; infections cause similar symptoms to nonspecific vulvovaginitis and are treated with amoxicillin. STI-associated vulvovaginitis may be caused by sexual abuse or vertical transmission, and are treated and diagnosed like adult infections.

<text>The 2nd government of Ireland (30 June 1938 – 1 July 1943) was the government of Ireland formed after the 1938 general election to the 10th Dáil held on 17 June. It was a single-party Fianna Fáil government led by Éamon de Valera as Taoiseach. Fianna Fáil had been in office since the 1932 general election. It lasted for .

==Nomination of Taoiseach==
The 10th Dáil first met on 30 June 1938. In the debate on the nomination of Taoiseach, Fianna Fáil leader and outgoing Taoiseach Éamon de Valera was proposed. The motion was approved by 75 to 45. De Valera was appointed as Taoiseach by President Douglas Hyde. This occurred five days after the inauguration of Hyde as the first President of Ireland on 25 June.

==Members of the government==
After his appointment as Taoiseach by the president, Éamon de Valera proposed the members of the government and they were approved by the Dáil. They were appointed to office by the president.
==Parliamentary secretaries==
On 30 June 1938, the Government appointed Parliamentary secretaries on the nomination of the Taoiseach.
==Constitutional amendments==
During the first three years of the term of office of the first President of Ireland, the Oireachtas could pass amendments to the Constitution of Ireland without a referendum. This period lasted from 25 June 1938 to 24 June 1941. The First Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland was introduced and signed into law on 2 September 1939, allowing the Oireachtas to resolve that a state of emergency exists when an armed conflict exists outside of the state. The Emergency was declared on the same day, and the emergency powers lapsed on 2 September 1946. The Second Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland was signed into law on 30 May 1941 and was an omnibus amendment with 40 separate changes across the text of the Constitution. Both amendments were proposed by the Taoiseach.

<text>A (; ) is a specialized top-level educational institution in France and some other previous French colonies such as Morocco and Tunisia. are part of an alternative educational system that operates alongside the mainstream French public university system, and take the shape of institutes dedicated to teaching, research and professional training in either pure natural and social sciences, or applied sciences such as engineering, architecture, business administration, or public policy and administration. 

Similar to the Ivy League in the United States, Oxbridge in the UK, and C9 League in China, &quot;Grandes écoles&quot; are elite academic institutions that admit students through an extremely competitive process. primarily admit students based on their national ranking in written and oral exams called , which are organized annually by the French Ministry of Education. While anyone can register for , successful candidates have almost always completed two or three years of dedicated preparatory classes () prior to admission. 

As they are separate from universities, most of them do not deliver the undergraduate degree of the &quot;Licence&quot; (the bachelor&#x27;s degree in France) but deliver master&#x27;s &quot;grande école&quot; degrees such as the Engineer&#x27;s Diploma and the Accredited Diploma (for example, delivered with a &quot;Programme Grande École&quot; in business schools). Admission to the is extremely selective. 

 are generally publicly funded and therefore have limited tuition costs. Some, especially business schools (), are organised privately and therefore have more costly tuition.

== Classification of &quot;grandes écoles&quot; ==

=== Origins ===
The term &quot;grande école&quot; originated in 1794 after the French Revolution, when the National Convention created the , the mathematician Gaspard Monge and Lazare Carnot created the &quot;École centrale des travaux publics&quot; (later the &quot;École polytechnique&quot;), and the abbot Henri Grégoire created the .

The model was probably the military academy at Mézières, of which Monge was an alumnus. The selective admission opens up to higher education based on academic merit.

Some schools included in the category have roots in the 17th and 18th centuries and are older than the term &quot;grande école&quot;, which dates to 1794. Their forerunners were schools aimed at graduating civil servants, such as technical officers (École d&#x27;Arts et Métiers, renamed Arts et Métiers ParisTech, established in 1780), mine supervisors (École des mines de Paris, established in 1783), bridge and road engineers (École royale des ponts et chaussées, established in 1747), and shipbuilding engineers (École des ingénieurs-constructeurs des vaisseaux royaux, established in 1741).

Five military engineering academies and graduate schools of artillery were established in the 17th century in France, such as the école de l&#x27;artillerie de Douai (established in 1697) and the later école du génie de Mézières (established in 1748), wherein mathematics, chemistry and sciences were already a major part of the curriculum taught by first-rank scientists such as Pierre-Simon Laplace, Charles Étienne Louis Camus, Étienne Bézout, Sylvestre-François Lacroix, Siméon Denis Poisson, Gaspard Monge (most of whom were later to form the teaching corps of École Polytechnique during the Napoleonic era).

In 1802, Napoleon created the École spéciale militaire de Saint-Cyr, which is also considered a &quot;grande école&quot;, although it trains only army officers.

During the 19th century, a number of higher-education grandes écoles were established to support industry and commerce, such as École nationale supérieure des Mines de Saint-Étienne in 1816, École supérieure de Commerce de Paris (today ESCP Business School, founded in 1819), L&#x27;institut des sciences et industries du vivant et de l&#x27;environnement (Agro ParisTech) in 1826, and École centrale des Arts et Manufactures (École centrale Paris) in 1829. 

During the latter part of the 19th century and in the 20th century, more grandes écoles were established for education in businesses as well as newer fields of science and technology, including Rouen Business School (NEOMA Business School) in 1871, Sciences Po Paris in 1872, École nationale supérieure des télécommunications in 1878, Hautes Études commerciales in 1881, École supérieure d&#x27;électricité in 1894, Ecole des hautes Etudes commerciales du Nord in 1906 , Ecole Supérieure des Sciences économiques et commerciales in 1907, and Supaero in 1909.

Since then, France has had a unique dual higher education system, with small and middle-sized specialized graduate schools operating alongside the traditional university system. Some fields of study are nearly exclusive to one part of this dual system, such as medicine in &quot;universités&quot; only, or architecture in &quot;écoles&quot; only.

The grande école (and &quot;prépa&quot;) system also exists in former French colonies, Switzerland, and Italy (Napoleon, as king of Italy for ten years, established the French system there). The influence of this system was strong in the 19th century throughout the world, as can be seen in the original names of many world universities (Caltech was originally &quot;Polytechnic Institute&quot;, as was ETH Zürich—&quot;the Polytechnicum&quot;—in addition to the Polytechnique in Montréal. Some institutions in China, Russia, the UK, and the US also have names of some French grandes écoles, adapted to their languages). The success of the German and Anglo-Saxon university models from the late 19th century reduced the influence of the French system in some of the English-speaking world.

=== Today ===

There is no standard definition or official list of grandes écoles. The term &quot;grande école&quot; is not employed in the French education code, with the exception of a quotation in the social statistics. It generally employs the expression of &quot;écoles supérieures&quot; to indicate higher educational institutions that are not universities.

The &quot;Conférence des grandes écoles (CGE)&quot; (&quot;Grandes Écoles&quot; Conference) is a non-profit organization. It uses a broad definition of &quot;grande école&quot;, which is not restricted to the school&#x27;s selectivity or the prestige of the diploma awarded. The members of CGE have not made an official or &quot;accepted&quot; list of grandes écoles. For example, some engineering school members of the CGE cannot award state-recognized engineering degrees.

== Admission to &quot;grandes écoles&quot; ==

The admissions process for grandes écoles differs greatly from those of other French universities. To be admitted into most French grandes écoles, most students study in a two-year preparatory program in one of the CPGEs (see below) before taking a set of competitive national exams. Different exams are required by groups (called &quot;banques&quot;) of different schools. The national exams are sets of written tests, given over the course of several weeks, that challenge the student on the intensive studies of the previous two years. During the summer, those students who succeed in the written exams then take a further set of exams, usually one-hour oral exams, during which they are given a problem to solve. After 20 minutes of preparation, the candidate presents the solution to a professor, who challenges the candidate on the answer and the assumptions being made. Afterwards, candidates receive a final national ranking, which determines admission to their grande école of choice.

=== Preparatory classes for grandes écoles (CPGE) ===


Classes préparatoires aux Grandes Écoles (CPGE), or &quot;prépas&quot; (preparatory classes for grandes écoles), are two-year classes, in either sciences, literature, or economics. These are the traditional way in which most students prepare to pass the competitive recruitment examination of the main grandes écoles. Most are held in state lycées (high schools); a few are private. Admission is competitive and based on the students&#x27; lycée grades. Preparatory classes with the highest success rates in the entrance examinations of the top grandes écoles are highly selective. Students who are not admitted to the grande école of their choice often repeat the second year of preparatory classes and attempt the exam again the following year.

There are five categories of &quot;prépas&quot;:

* Scientifiques: These prepare for the engineering schools and teach mathematics, physics, chemistry, and technology. They are broken down in sub-categories according to the emphasis of their dominant subject: they are mainly focused on mathematics and either physics (MP), industrial sciences and technologies (TSI), physics and chemistry (PC), physics and engineering science (PSI), physics and technology (PT) and chemistry, physics and technology (TPC) .
* BCPST: biology, chemistry, physics, geology, and mathematics. Commonly called &quot;Agro-Véto&quot;, these classes prepare students primarily for agricultural and veterinary schools, but also for schools in geology, hydrology, and forestry, as well as for research and teaching careers via the &quot;Écoles normales supérieures&quot;.
* Lettres: humanities, essentially for the &quot;Écoles normales supérieures&quot; (students can also compete to enter business schools, but represent a small minority of those admitted). There are two main sub-categories: &quot;Lettres&quot;, in either &quot;A/L&quot; (with Ancient Greek and/or Latin) or LSH (with geography), and B/L (with mathematics and social sciences).
* Économique et commerciale: mathematics and economics. These prepare for the entrance exams to the French business schools, and are subdivided between science (mathematics) and economics tracks - a third track also exists for students with a &quot;technological&quot;, i.e. applied background.
* Chartes: humanities, with an emphasis on philology, history and languages, named after the school École nationale des Chartes. By far the smallest &quot;prépa&quot; in number of students.

=== Recruitment at &quot;baccalauréat&quot; level ===

Some schools are accessible after a selection based on the grades of the two last years of lycée (High school) and/or the baccalaureate (High school diploma) results. For example, in engineering, the most attractive and selective ones are the seven schools composing the Institut National des Sciences Appliquées (INSA network), but there are dozens of selective and less selective engineering schools accessible directly after the baccalaureate. Some other famous highly selective engineering school are the three Universités de Technologie. It is also possible to join these schools in third year after a preparatory class or university and then the recruitment is based on a contest or the student results.

Most of these five-year grandes écoles are public, with very low admission fees (between 601€ and 2,350€ per year), and are free for national scholarship holders. A few others are either private or public with very high admission fee (up to 10,000€ per year, without exoneration for scholarship holders). These are usually the least selective ones and offer five-year training to students who otherwise could not have enrolled in a five-year curriculum directly after High school.

The top three public engineering grandes écoles with standard admission fees (among 70), according to the French magazine L&#x27;Étudiant noir, are in 2023 the Institut National des Sciences Appliquées de Lyon (INSA Lyon), Institut National des Sciences Appliquées de Toulouse (INSA Toulouse) and École des Mines de Douai (IMT Nord Europe). However, the rankings may differ significantly between years, magazines, and the metric of interest (academic excellence, employability, diversity, ...).

Most of them simply include the two-year preparatory class in their program while others like INSA Toulouse chose the Bachelor&#x27;s master&#x27;s doctorate system (BMD or LMD in French) to start the specialization earlier. Most students choose to get their licence, master or doctorate close to home.

These years of preparation can be highly focused on the school program so students have a greater chance of succeeding in the admission exam or contest in their school if there is one, but they are not prepared to take the examinations for other schools so their chance of success in these other examinations is low.

The advantage is that instead of studying simply to pass the admission exams, the student will study topics more targeted to their training and future specialization. The main advantage is that students choose their speciality more according to their interests and less according to their rank. (Indeed, the rank obtained after standard preparatory classes determines a list of schools with their specialities).

On another note, the selection process during the first preparatory year is considered less stressful than in a standard first preparatory class, and the first year often offers broader scientific training since it does not specifically prepare students for competitions. Nevertheless, the selection percentage are often the same order as during standard preparatory classes. The top-ranking five year grandes écoles also recruit some of the best students who followed one or two years of CPGE, through parallel admission procedures.

=== Parallel admission ===

The &quot;prépa&quot; years are not required to sit the entrance exams. Moreover, in many schools, there is also the possibility of “parallel admission” to a grande école. Parallel admissions are open to university students or students from other schools that decide not to take the entrance exams. This method of recruitment is proving increasingly popular, with many students choosing to first go to a university and then enroll in a grande école.

Some grandes écoles have a dual diploma arrangement in which a student can switch establishments in the last year to receive diplomas from both establishments.

== Degrees awarded ==

=== Historically ===
The French &quot;Grandes écoles&quot; mostly do not fit into the international, Anglo-American framework regarding their diplomas, nor in the European Bologna system. In 2007, the OECD remarked in a report that &quot;their diplomas do not fit easily into the increasingly standardised international nomenclature for academic study ... Instead, students effectively study for five years and are then awarded a masters degree, with no intermediate diploma&quot;.

However, some &quot;Grandes écoles&quot; have decided to adopt the standard, European Bologna system of diplomas recently in order to better integrate themselves in the international academic competition. In their 2008 book &quot;European Universities in Transition&quot;, Carmelo Mazza, Paolo Quattrone and Angelo Riccaboni underlined that &quot;the vast majority of Grandes Ecoles do not give any degree&quot; upon completion of undergraduate studies, but that &quot;[i]n practice, for accreditation or student exchange purposes, they grant a certificate of &#x27;equivalence to a bachelor&#x27;s degree&#x27;&quot;.

=== In engineering &quot;Grandes écoles&quot; ===
For their engineering programs, the &quot;Grandes écoles&quot; award an &quot;&quot;Diplôme d&#x27;Ingénieur&quot;, similar to a Master of Engineering degree. This engineer&#x27;s degree, required to use the engineer title in France, is strictly protected and can only be awarded by state-accredited &quot;Grandes écoles&quot;, via the Engineering Accreditation Commission (CTI).

=== In &quot;Grandes écoles&quot; business schools ===
In France, the majority of business schools are private or semi-private. For their programs, business schools that are &quot;Grandes écoles&quot; (like HEC or ESCP) offer a &quot;Programme Grande École&quot;&quot; or &quot;PGE&quot; (generally translated into English as &quot;Master in Management&quot;, or &quot;Grande École program&quot;), which delivers a state-accredited diploma that is considerably more prestigious than a French master&#x27;s degree in management delivered by university schools of management (IAE) or management faculties in the mainstream French university system. 

In France, only public &quot;Grandes écoles&quot; and universities can award licences, masters and doctorates. For example, the semi-private ESCP Business School has signed a partnership agreement to award a PhD in management from Panthéon-Sorbonne University. The semi-private school HEC has done the same, along with the Polytechnic Institute of Paris (a public research university which consists of six public &quot;grandes écoles&quot;).

== Faculty in &quot;Grandes écoles&quot; ==

=== Full-time researchers and teaching faculty ===
Full-time faculty researchers to assume their responsibility as teaching staff by giving lectures, accompanying students in their projects, participating in the campus life and representing the school during symposia.

Their contractual number of working hours is defined at the beginning of each academic year in a lump sum workload timetable.

Full-time faculty/teaching are in charge of giving lectures, but also shoulder pedagogic coordination. As such, they are deeply involved in their respective campus&#x27; life and accountable for the teaching quality as well as the pedagogic continuous improvement of the School.

Prominent professors: according to L&#x27;Etudiant, a prominent professor is permanent professor, holding a PhD from a French or foreign Higher Education Institution which is AACSB- or EQUIS-accredited and ranked amongst the Shanghai 2019 top 500 ranking.

=== Adjunct professors ===
Adjunct Professors hold chair in another Higher Education Institution. Their teaching conditions are various, but not always stipulated in a contractual form.

Visiting professors are teaching staff which hold a chair along another activity, e.g. a consultant or entrepreneur giving lectures once or twice a week.

Guest professors are international professors who take part in special lectures, classes or programme.

== Categories ==

Grandes écoles can be classified into following broad categories:

=== Écoles normales supérieures ===
These schools train researchers and professors and may be a beginning for executive careers in public administration or business. Many French Nobel Prize and Fields Medal laureates were educated at the &quot;École Normale Supérieure&quot; in Paris, Lyon or Paris-Saclay. There are four ENS:

* the &quot;École Normale Supérieure&quot; of PSL University, nicknamed &quot;Ulm&quot; from its address &quot;rue d&#x27;Ulm&quot; in Paris (sciences and humanities);
* the &quot;École Normale Supérieure de Lyon&quot; in Lyon (sciences and humanities);
* the &quot;École Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay&quot;, near Paris (sciences, engineering, social sciences, economics and management, foreign languages), a constituent &quot;grande école&quot; of Paris-Saclay University.
* the &quot;École Normale Supérieure de Rennes&quot; near Rennes (sciences, engineering, social sciences, economics and management, sport), a constituent &quot;grande école&quot; of the University of Rennes.

Until recently, unlike most other grandes écoles, &quot;écoles normales supérieures&quot; (ENS) did not award specific diplomas. Students who completed their curriculum were entitled to be known as &quot;ENS alumni&quot; or &quot;normaliens&quot;. The schools encourage their students to obtain university diplomas in partner institutions while providing extra classes and support. Many ENS students obtain more than one university diploma. &quot;Normaliens&quot; from France and other European Union countries are considered civil servants in training (unless they were recruited by parallel admission), and as such are paid a monthly salary in exchange for agreeing to serve France for ten years, including those years spent as students.

=== Engineering schools (&quot;grandes écoles d&#x27;ingénieurs&quot;) ===

Many engineering schools recruit most of their students who have completed their education in scientific preparatory classes (2 years of post-baccalaureat study). Many are also joint graduate schools from several regional universities, sometimes in association with other international higher education networks.

In France, the term &#x27;engineer&#x27; has a broader meaning compared to the one understood in most other countries and can imply a person who has achieved a high level of study in both fundamental and applied sciences, as well as business management, humanities and social sciences. The best engineering schools will often provide such a general and very intensive education, although this is not always the case. Most of the schools of the following first four groups train the so-called &#x27;generaliste&#x27; engineers:

=== Military officer academies ===
Today, there are only 3 grandes écoles that are officially denominated as military academies of the French Republic.
* The &quot;École Spéciale Militaire de Saint-Cyr&quot;, formerly located in Saint-Cyr-l&#x27;École but now in Coëtquidan in Brittany, is the Army Academy. Nicknamed &quot;Saint-Cyr&quot;, its graduates and students are &quot;cyrards&quot; but are generally referred to as &quot;saint-cyriens&quot;;
* The &quot;École de l&#x27;Air&quot; (&quot;EA&quot;) is the Air Force Academy, located in Salon-de-Provence;
* The &quot;École Navale&quot; (&quot;EN&quot;) is nicknamed &quot;Navale&quot; and its graduates and students are &quot;Bordaches&quot;. It is located in Brest.

While &quot;École polytechnique&quot; is also under supervision of the French Ministry of Defence, it is no longer officially a military academy. Only a small number of its students progress to military careers, while between a fifth and a quarter choose to remain in France to work for the state&#x27;s technical administrations.

There are also other specialized military &quot;grandes écoles&quot;:

* The &quot;École de santé des armées,&quot; located in Lyon for the training of army doctors and pharmacists.
* The &quot;École nationale de la sécurité et de l&#x27;administration de la mer&quot; for the military officers and civil servants of the French Maritime Administration
* The &quot;École des commissaires des armées&quot; (ECA), training military officers in charge of all the support functions (management, purchasing, finance, human support, human resources, legal advice, decision support, logistics)

== Facts and influence in French culture ==

Altogether, grandes écoles awarded approximately 60,000 master&#x27;s degrees in 2013, compared with 150,000 master&#x27;s degrees awarded by all French higher institutions in the same year, including universities.

Grande école graduates in 2013 represent 10% of the French population graduating from high school 5 years before (600,000 in 2008).

Some grandes écoles are renowned in France for their selectivity and the complexity of their curriculum. In the press, they are usually called the &quot;A+&quot; schools, referring to the grade given by some rankings. These elite schools represent less than 1% of the higher education students in France.

Admission to a certain number of these institutions (e.g. l&#x27;Ecole Nationale de la Magistrature in Bordeaux) is reserved only to French citizens, raising questions relating to European mobility and institutional reciprocity.

Since 1975, the &quot;Comité d&#x27;études sur les formations d&#x27;ingénieurs&quot; has studied the questions of training and job placement for engineers graduating from grandes écoles.

=== Notable alumni ===

Of the 29 persons who have served as President of France, 17 attended a Grande école.
Many winners of the Nobel prize attended a Grande école

<text>Blame is the act of censuring, holding responsible, or making negative statements about an individual or group that their actions or inaction are socially or morally irresponsible, the opposite of praise. When someone is morally responsible for doing something wrong, their action is blameworthy. By contrast, when someone is morally responsible for doing something right, it may be said that their action is praiseworthy. There are other senses of praise and blame that are not ethically relevant. One may praise someone&#x27;s good dress sense, and blame their own sense of style for their own dress sense.

== Philosophy ==

Philosophers discuss the concept of blame as one of the reactive attitudes, a term coined by P. F. Strawson, which includes attitudes like blame, praise, gratitude, resentment, and forgiveness. In contrast to physical or intellectual concepts, reactive attitudes are formed from the point of view of an active participant regarding objects. This is to be distinguished from the objective standpoint.

== Neurology ==
Blaming appears to relate to include brain activity in the temporoparietal junction (TPJ). The amygdala has been found to contribute when we blame others, but not when we respond to their positive actions.

==Sociology and psychology==
Humans—consciously and unconsciously—constantly make judgments about other people. The psychological criteria for judging others may be partly ingrained, negative, and rigid, indicating some degree of grandiosity.

Blaming provides a way of devaluing others, with the result that the blamer feels superior, seeing others as less worthwhile and/or making the blamer &quot;perfect&quot;. Off-loading blame means putting the other person down by emphasizing their flaws.

Victims of manipulation and abuse frequently feel responsible for causing negative feelings in the manipulator/abuser towards them and the resultant anxiety in themselves. This self-blame often becomes a major feature of victim status.

The victim gets trapped into a self-image of victimization. The psychological profile of victimization includes a pervasive sense of helplessness, passivity, loss of control, pessimism, negative thinking, strong feelings of guilt, shame, remorse, self-blame, and depression. This way of thinking can lead to hopelessness and despair.

===Self-blame===
Two main types of self-blame exist:

# behavioral self-blame – undeserved blame based on actions. Victims who experience behavioral self-blame feel that they should have done something differently, and therefore feel at fault.
# characterological self-blame – undeserved blame based on character. Victims who experience characterological self-blame feel there is something inherently wrong with them which has caused them to deserve to be victimized.

Behavioral self-blame is associated with feelings of guilt within the victim. While the belief that one had control during the abuse (past control) is associated with greater psychological distress, the belief that one has more control during the recovery process (present control) is associated with less distress, less withdrawal, and more cognitive reprocessing.

Counseling responses found helpful in reducing self-blame include:

* supportive responses
* psychoeducational responses (for example, learning about rape trauma syndrome)
* responses addressing the issue of blame.

A helpful type of therapy for self-blame is cognitive restructuring or cognitive–behavioral therapy. Cognitive reprocessing is the process of taking the facts and forming a logical conclusion from them that is less influenced by shame or guilt.

===Victim blaming===

Victim blaming is holding the victims of a crime, an accident, or any type of abusive maltreatment to be entirely or partially responsible for the incident that has occurred. The fundamental attribution error concept explains how people tend to blame negative behavior more on the victims traits than the situation at the time of the event.

===Individual blame versus system blame===
In sociology, individual blame is the tendency of a group or society to hold the individual responsible for their situation, whereas system blame is the tendency to focus on social factors that contribute to one&#x27;s fate.

===Blame shifting===

Blaming others can lead to a &quot;kick the dog&quot; effect where individuals in a hierarchy blame their immediate subordinate, and this propagates down a hierarchy until the lowest rung (the &quot;dog&quot;). A 2009 experimental study has shown that blaming can be contagious even for uninvolved onlookers.

In complex international organizations, such as enforcers of national and supranational policies and regulations, the blame is usually attributed to the last echelon, the implementing actors.

===As a propaganda technique===

Labeling theory accounts for blame by postulating that when intentional actors act out to continuously blame an individual for nonexistent psychological traits and for nonexistent variables, those actors aim to induce irrational guilt at an unconscious level. Blame in this case becomes a propaganda tactic, using repetitive blaming behaviors, innuendos, and hyperbole in order to assign negative status to normative humans. When innocent people are blamed fraudulently for nonexistent psychological states and nonexistent behaviors, and there is no qualifying deviance for the blaming behaviors, the intention is to create a negative valuation of innocent humans to induce fear, by using fear mongering. For centuries, governments have used blaming in the form of demonization to influence public perceptions of various other governments, as well as to induce feelings of nationalism in the public. Blame can objectify people, groups, and nations, typically negatively influencing the intended subjects of propaganda, compromising their objectivity. Blame is utilized as a social-control technique.

=== In organizations ===

The flow of blame in an organization may be a primary indicator of that organization&#x27;s robustness and integrity. Blame flowing downwards, from management to staff, or laterally between professionals or partner organizations, indicates organizational failure. In a blame culture, problem-solving is replaced by blame-avoidance. Blame coming from the top generates &quot;fear, malaise, errors, accidents, and passive-aggressive responses from the bottom&quot;, with those at the bottom feeling powerless and lacking emotional safety. Employees have expressed that organizational blame culture made them fear prosecution for errors and/or accidents and thus unemployment, which may make them more reluctant to report accidents, since trust is crucial to encourage accident reporting. This makes it less likely that weak and/or long-term indicators of safety threats get picked up, thus preventing the organization from taking adequate measures to prevent minor problems from escalating into uncontrollable situations. Several issues identified in organizations with a blame culture contradict the best practices adopted by high reliability organizations. Organisational chaos, such as confused roles and responsibilities, is strongly associated with blame culture and workplace bullying. Blame culture promotes a risk aversive approach, which prevent organizations and their agents from adequately assessing risks.

According to Mary Douglas, blame is systematically used in the micro-politics of institutions, with three latent functions: explaining disasters, justifying allegiances, and stabilizing existing institutional regimes. Within a politically stable regime, blame tends to be asserted on the weak or unlucky one, but in a less stable regime, blame shifting may involve a battle between rival factions. Douglas was interested in how blame stabilizes existing power structures within institutions or social groups. She devised a two-dimensional typology of institutions, the first attribute being named &quot;group&quot;, which is the strength of boundaries and social cohesion, the second &quot;grid&quot;, the degree and strength of the hierarchy. According to Douglas, blame will fall on different entities depending on the institutional type. For markets, blame is used in power struggles between potential leaders. In bureaucracies, blame tends to flow downwards and is attributed to a failure to follow rules. In a clan, blame is asserted on outsiders or involves allegations of treachery, to suppress dissidence and strengthen the group&#x27;s ties. In the 4th type, isolation, the individuals are facing the competitive pressures of the marketplace alone; in other words, there is a condition of fragmentation with a loss of social cohesion, potentially leading to feelings of powerlessness and fatalism, and this type was renamed by various other authors into &quot;donkey jobs&quot;. It is suggested that the progressive changes in managerial practices in healthcare is leading to an increase in donkey jobs.

The requirement of accountability and transparency, assumed to be key for good governance, worsen the behaviors of blame avoidance, both at the individual and institutional levels, as is observed in various domains such as politics and healthcare. Indeed, institutions tend to be risk-averse and blame-averse, and where the management of societal risks (the threats to society) and institutional risks (threats to the organizations managing the societal risks) are not aligned, there may be organizational pressures to prioritize the management of institutional risks at the expense of societal risks. Furthermore, &quot;blame-avoidance behaviour at the expense of delivering core business is a well-documented organizational rationality&quot;. The willingness of maintaining one&#x27;s reputation may be a key factor explaining the relationship between accountability and blame avoidance. This may produce a &quot;risk colonization&quot;, where institutional risks are transferred to societal risks, as a strategy of risk management. Some researchers argue that there is &quot;no risk-free lunch&quot; and &quot;no blame-free risk&quot;, an analogy to the &quot;no free lunch&quot; adage.

<doc id="319904" wikidata="Q1605137" url="?curid=319904" title="Hendrix College">
<text>Hendrix College is a private liberal arts college in Conway, Arkansas. Approximately 1,000 students are enrolled, mostly undergraduates. While affiliated with the United Methodist Church, the college offers a secular curriculum and has a student body composed of people from many different religious backgrounds. Hendrix is a member of the Associated Colleges of the South.

==History==
Hendrix College was founded as a primary school called Central Institute in 1876 at Altus, Arkansas, by Rev. Isham L. Burrow. In 1881 it was renamed Central Collegiate Institute when secondary and collegiate departments were added. The next year the first graduating collegiate class, composed of three women, were awarded Mistress of English Literature degrees. In 1884, three conferences of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South purchased the school. This began the school&#x27;s relationship with the Methodist Episcopal Church, South and later The Methodist Church and the United Methodist Church. The Central Collegiate Institute was renamed Hendrix College in 1889 in honor of Rev. Eugene Russell Hendrix, a presiding bishop over three Arkansas Methodist conferences. This same year, the primary school was discontinued.

Hendrix College was initially designated a male college, but by the time of the name change in 1889, the college allowed for the enrollment of women who were interested in the college&#x27;s course of study.
In 1890, after receiving bids from seven other Arkansas towns, the Hendrix Board of Trustees chose Conway as the new location for the college. College literary societies thrived at Hendrix from the 1890s through the 1930s, and they included the Harlan Literary Society, its rival—the Franklin Literary Society, and for women—the Hypatian Literary Society. Secondary education was discontinued in 1925. In 1929 the college merged with Henderson-Brown College, a private school in Arkadelphia, Arkansas now known as Henderson State University, which briefly created Hendrix-Henderson College. Two years later the name reverted to Hendrix College. The merger resulted in Hendrix Bull Dogs becoming the Hendrix Warriors, and the college newspaper, the &quot;Bull Dog,&quot; being renamed the &quot;College Profile.&quot;

The newly expanded college planned to move to Little Rock, Arkansas, but the city of Conway was able to raise $150,000 to keep the school. In 1930 the name was briefly changed to Trinity College but reverted to Hendrix College after opposition by students, alumni and townspeople. The financially troubled Galloway Woman&#x27;s College in Searcy, Arkansas was absorbed by Hendrix in 1933 during the Great Depression.

W. Ellis Arnold III became the college’s twelfth president on December 31, 2019.

==Student life==

Hendrix is a primarily undergraduate institution with 34 majors and 38 minors, including a master&#x27;s of accounting degree. The student body is about 1400, with students coming from most U.S. states and from over a dozen foreign countries. Notable are the Rwandan Presidential Scholars. Hendrix is the lead institution in a consortium of 19 private and public higher education institutions that together host over 220 students from Rwanda.

The Student Senate is the governing body of the student association. It has officers that are elected campus-wide along with representatives from each class, residence hall and apartment building.

Hendrix has no social fraternities or sororities. There are 65 student organizations that offer a wide range of activities, funded by a student activity fee. The largest student organization is Social Committee, or SoCo, which plans the major events on campus. The Office of Student Activities organizes weekend and Wednesday evening events. Major social events are usually held in &quot;The Brick Pit,&quot; an outdoor area in the center of the campus. The most famous event is &quot;Shirttails,&quot; a freshman dance-off that includes a serenade by the men&#x27;s dorms.

Hendrix College has its own radio station. Founded in 1971 and first broadcasting in 1973, KHDX-FM 93.1 is Hendrix College&#x27;s student-run radio station, with a 10-watt broadcast that reaches Hendrix Campus and the surrounding Conway area. Additionally, as of 2017, KHDX Radio is a founding member of the Arkansas College Radio Association.

==Recognition==
In fall 2013, Hendrix was recognized as one of the country&#x27;s top &quot;Up and Coming&quot; liberal arts colleges for the sixth consecutive year by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;. The 2014 &quot;US News Best Colleges&quot; guide lists Hendrix as No. 11 in a group of liberal arts colleges that demonstrate &quot;A Strong Commitment to Teaching.&quot; Hendrix is the only Arkansas institution to appear in the 2014 &quot;US News Best Colleges&quot; ranking of the top 100 private national liberal arts colleges. Hendrix was listed among the top liberal arts colleges &quot;based on their contribution to the public good&quot; by &quot;Washington Monthly&quot;. Hendrix is among the country&#x27;s top 100 most financially fit private colleges, according to a list published by &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine and is ranked No. 158 on the magazine&#x27;s list of America&#x27;s Top Colleges and No. 115 in a list of private colleges in the nation.&quot; Hendrix is among the top colleges profiled in &quot;The Princeton Review&quot;&#x27;s &quot;The Best 378 Colleges&quot; (2014). Hendrix was selected for inclusion in the &quot;Fiske Guide to Colleges 2014&quot; based on academic ratings, price category, and quality of student life on campus.

Hendrix was named in 2010 as one of &quot;The Top 50 Schools That Produce Science PhDs&quot; by &quot;CBS MoneyWatch.com&quot; which compiled its rankings using data from The National Science Foundation. The Institute of International Education awarded Hendrix with a 2012 Andrew Heiskell Award for International Exchange Partnerships as project coordinators of the Rwanda Presidential Scholars Program. Hendrix has ties with Rwanda going back to 2007, and in 2019 announced annual assistance to two graduates of Gashora Girls Academy of Science and Technology to attend Hendrix.

<doc id="319921" wikidata="Q1146358" url="?curid=319921" title="Paper tiger">
<text>&quot;Paper tiger&quot; is a calque of the Chinese phrase zhǐlǎohǔ (). The term refers to something or someone that claims or appears to be powerful or threatening but is actually ineffectual and unable to withstand challenge.

The expression became well known internationally as a slogan used by Mao Zedong, former chairman of the Chinese Communist Party and paramount leader of China, against his political opponents, particularly the United States. It has since been used in various capacities and variations to describe many other opponents and entities.

==Origin==
&quot;Zhilaohu&quot; is an ancient phrase. Robert Morrison, the British missionary and lexicographer, translated the phrase as &quot;a paper tiger&quot; in &quot;Vocabulary of the Canton Dialect&quot; in 1828. John Francis Davis translated the Chinese phrase as &quot;paper tiger&quot; in a book on Chinese history published in 1836. In a meeting with Henry Kissinger in 1973, Mao Zedong claimed in a humorous aside to have coined the English phrase.

==Use==
Mao Zedong first introduced his idea of paper tigers to Americans in an August 1946 interview with American journalist Anna Louise Strong:

In a 1956 interview with Strong, Mao used the phrase &quot;paper tiger&quot; to describe American imperialism again:
In 1957, Mao reminisced about the original interview with Strong:
In this view, &quot;paper tigers&quot; are superficially powerful but are prone to overextension that leads to sudden collapse. When Mao criticized Soviet appeasement of the United States during the Sino-Soviet split, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev reportedly said, &quot;the paper tiger has nuclear teeth&quot;.

The term was frequently used in Chinese Internet discourse regarding the trade war begun by United States President Donald Trump. Internet users referred to Trump as a paper tiger, frequently observing that the United States economy depends heavily on Chinese companies for a host of necessities, electronics, and raw components.

==Other uses==
In &quot;The Resistance to Theory&quot; (1982), Paul de Man used the phrase to reflect upon the threat of literary theory to traditional literary scholarship in American academia. He said, &quot;If a cat is called a tiger it can easily be dismissed as a paper tiger; the question remains however why one was so scared of the cat in the first place&quot;.

Osama bin Laden described U.S. soldiers as &quot;paper tigers&quot;. This statement may reflect the influence of Maoism on the formation of the Taliban.

The phrase was used in a 2006 speech by then-Senator Joe Biden to describe North Korea after a series of missile launches from the country that same year, defying the warnings of the international community while still incapable of directly harming the United States.

China itself has been called a paper tiger. In 2021, Michael Beckley argued in his book &quot;Unrivaled: Why America Will Remain the World’s Sole Superpower&quot; that China would not be able to overtake the United States, and that believing China is stronger than it really is, is detrimental to American perceptions and policy. According to Beckley, this is because &quot;China’s economic, financial, technological, and military strength is hugely exaggerated by crude and inaccurate statistics&quot;: for example, Beckley states that high-scoring Chinese education statistics are actually cherry-picked, that the People&#x27;s Liberation Army is not as strong as the United States Armed Forces due to their differing focuses, and that China&#x27;s large GDP does not equate to their actual strength or power.

Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Russian Armed Forces was described by many commentators as a paper tiger. Steve Day, a retired Canadian Armed Forces Joint Task Force 2 commander, described Russian command and control as a &quot;bit more of a paper tiger&quot; than previously thought as it was &quot;utterly inept&quot; and suggested that the Russian military &quot;may not be as invincible as we&#x27;ve believed for a number of decades&quot;. &quot;The New Yorker&quot; described Russia as a paper tiger and analysed their performance during the 2008 Russo-Georgian War. The paper said that the Russian military suffered from &quot;disunity of command; logistical weaknesses; poorly trained, poorly motivated, poorly led troops; very poor quality of officer corps; very poor quality of campaign design and ability to plan&quot;, as well as &quot;very poor integration within and among the armed services, including the synchronization of air and ground operations&quot;.

<text>Juan Luis Guerra Seijas (born 7 June 1957) is a Dominican musician, singer, composer, and record producer. Throughout his career, he has won numerous awards including 28 Latin Grammy Awards, three
Grammy Awards, and one Latin Billboard Music Award. He won 3 Latin Grammy Awards in 2010, including Album of the Year. In 2012, he won the Latin Grammy Award for Producer of the Year. He has sold 15 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling Latin music artists.

Guerra is one of the most internationally recognized Latin artists of recent decades. His popular style of merengue and Latin fusion has garnered him considerable success throughout Latin America. He is also credited for popularizing bachata music on a global level and is often associated with the genre, although his distinct style of bachata features a more traditional bolero rhythm and aesthetic mixed with bossa-nova influenced melodies and harmony in some of his songs. He does not limit himself to one style of music, instead, his music incorporates a wide arrange of diverse rhythms such as merengue, bachata, bolero, balada, fusion, salsa, cumbia, mambo, cha-cha-cha, pop, rock and roll, reggae, classical, R&amp;B, folk, blues, jazz, funk, soul, rock, hip-hop/rap, son cubano, and religious, amongst many others. &quot;Ojalá Que Llueva Café&quot; is one of his most critically acclaimed pieces.

==Early life==
Born Juan Luis Guerra Seijas, his parents were Gilberto Guerra Pacheco, and Olga Seijas Herrero. He has two brothers, José Gilberto, a plastic surgeon, and Diego Esteban, a graduate in business administration. He was a student at La Salle and Santa Teresita school, where he stood out for his love of sports. Before becoming interested in music, Guerra studied Philosophy and Literature at the Universidad Autónoma de Santo Domingo. He later studied guitar and music theory at the Dominican Republic&#x27;s Conservatorio Nacional de Música (National Conservatory of Music) in Santo Domingo, and then decided to go to the United States to attend the Berklee College of Music in Boston, from which he graduated in 1982 with a diploma in jazz composition. He then returned to the Dominican Republic and formed a band with local musicians from his community.

==Career==
===1980s===
Guerra released his first album, &quot;Soplando&quot; (1984), with local musicians who became known as Juan Luis Guerra y 440. The number refers to the standard tuning of A440. The band&#x27;s name in Spanish is &quot;Cuatro Cuarenta&quot; (&quot;Four Forty&quot;). According to Guerra, this first album was based on jazz tunes and concepts he had learned at Berklee, and it &quot;wasn&#x27;t intended to be a commercial hit.&quot; Subsequently, however, he began to write more merengues.

In 1983, after a performance in front of the Dominican entrepreneur Bienvenido Rodríguez, Juan Luis Guerra was signed to Karen Records. This marked a radical shift in Guerra&#x27;s musical style toward merengue. In this period, he recorded two albums, Mudanza y Acarreo in 1985 and Mientras Más Lo Pienso...Tú in 1987. These works gained more recognition, and the band was nominated to attend the OTI (Organization of Iberoamerican Television) Festival to represent the Dominican Republic.

In 1988, during the recording of the album Ojalá Que Llueva Café, Guerra became the dominant vocalist of 440. This album also began his international recognition; the album&#x27;s sales topped the charts in many Latin American countries.

===1990s===
In 1990, 440 released their next album, &quot;Bachata Rosa&quot;, which became a major hit and earned Guerra his first Grammy award. With sales over five million, the album let Guerra keep touring Latin America, US and Europe. It contains memorable love songs such as &quot;Burbujas de amor&quot; (Bubbles of Love), &quot;Bachata Rosa&quot;, &quot;Rosalía&quot;, &quot;Como abeja al panal&quot; (Like a Bee to the Honeycomb), &quot;A pedir su mano&quot; (Asking For Her Hand), &quot;Carta de amor&quot; (Love Letter), and &quot;Estrellitas y duendes&quot; (Little stars and elves).

Guerra attracted controversy in 1992 after he released his next album, &quot;Areíto&quot; (which is a Taíno word for &quot;song and dance&quot;). It featured the hit single &quot;El costo de la vida&quot;, a song that decries corruption in Latin America and the rising costs of living as a consequence. Other songs included in this album protest the poor conditions in many Latin American countries, the celebration of the &#x27;discovery&#x27; of the Americas (&quot;1492&quot;), and the double standards of first-world nations. &quot;El costo de la vida&quot; was his first number-one hit in the Hot Latin Tracks.

His next album, &quot;Fogaraté&quot; (1994) avoided such controversy. It focuses on more rural and lesser known types of Dominican music, like &quot;Perico Ripiao&quot;.

Guerra&#x27;s 1998 release &quot;Ni es lo mismo ni es igual&quot; (Neither The Same Nor Equal) won three Latin Grammys in 2000 for Best Merengue Performance, Best Tropical Song, and Best Engineered Album. Its hits include &quot;Mi PC&quot; (lit. &quot;My PC&quot;, ), &quot;Palomita Blanca&quot; (Little White Dove), and &quot;El Niágara en Bicicleta&quot; (The Niagara on Bicycle).

===2000s===
In 2004, Guerra signed a one-off deal with Vene music and released his first new album in six years. Entitled &quot;Para Tí&quot; (For you), the album&#x27;s songs are mostly Christian, it debuted at number one in &quot;US Top Latin Albums&quot; and at 110 of US Billboard 200. It was three times certified platinum by the RIAA for selling 300,000 copies and sold half a million copies worldwide. It was certified gold in Argentina and Central America and as platinum in Venezuela. This album won two awards at the 2005 &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards, in the categories of Gospel-Pop and Tropical-Merengue, for the hit single &quot;Las Avispas&quot; (The wasps), the first time ever that one song has won these two categories at the same time. Other hits included &quot;Para Tí&quot; and &quot;Soldado&quot; (&quot;Soldier&quot;). In the same ceremony, Guerra was awarded Spirit of Hope Award for his philanthropic work. At the same time, Guerra was honored with the Latino Special Award for the Music Academy of Spain for his contributions to the music of his country and the Caribbean in the last 20 years. In the same year, Guerra embarked on his 20-year anniversary tour, &quot;Tour 20 años&quot;. In the United States, he visited cities including Miami, Chicago, Washington D.C., Orlando, Boston and a concert at New York`s Madison Square Garden. In November 2005, Guerra was awarded with two awards at the 6th Annual Latin Grammy Awards for Best Christian Album (Spanish Language) and Best Tropical Song for &quot;Las Avispas&quot;.

In January 2006, Guerra performed at Berklee&#x27;s 60th anniversary, along with other artists such as Paul Simon, Herbie Hancock, Michel Camilo and Chiara Civello. That same year, he recorded with Diego Torres in &quot;Abriendo Caminos&quot; (Opening roads) and with Maná in &quot;Bendita Tu Luz&quot; (Blessed Be Your Light). On 6 April 2006, Guerra was honored as a BMI Icon at the 13th annual BMI Latin Awards. Named BMI&#x27;s 1995 Latin Songwriter of the Year, Guerra&#x27;s songwriting has garnered 14 BMI Latin Awards.

Guerra set records for the highest-grossing music tour when he opened for The Rolling Stones&#x27; A Bigger Bang Tour at their San Juan, Puerto Rico show in February 2006. He was also invited by Sting to sing with him at a concert at &quot;Altos de Chavón&quot;, La Romana in the Dominican Republic in 2006.

At the &quot;Premio Lo Nuestro&quot; awards in 2007, he was given the honorary lifetime achievement award. He also performed the lead single of his new album, &quot;La Llave De Mi Corazón&quot;, released in March 2007. Guerra won more than 20 awards with this CD, including 5 Latin Grammy Awards, 6 Premios Casandra awards, 4 billboard Awards, 2 lo nuestro, and one Grammy Award.

In 2007,Guerra was awarded the Excellence Award at the 2007 Lo Nuestro Awards. Guerra was honored at the Latin Grammy Awards in the same year with 5 awards, sweeping each category he was nominated in: Record of the Year, Album of the Year, Song of the Year, Best Tropical Song, and Best Merengue Album. Its engineers, Allan Leschhorn, Luis Mansilla, Ronnie Torres, and Adam Ayan, were also awarded Best Engineered Album. The night before the Latin Grammy Awards, he received the Academy&#x27;s Person of the Year Award for his contribution to Latin music and for his philanthropy.

On 10 March 2008, Guerra was honored with 6 awards in los Premios Casandra, the most important award event in the Dominican Republic. He won for Orchestrator of the year, Outstanding artist abroad, Music album of the year for &quot;La Llave de mi Corazón&quot; (The Key to My Heart) and &quot;El Soberano&quot; (The Sovereign).

On 16 March 2008, he and other artists participated in the &quot;Paz Sin Fronteras&quot; concert organized by Juanes, celebrating the end of the 2008 Andean diplomatic crisis between Colombia, Venezuela, and Ecuador.

On 11 April 2008, Guerra was the Billboard Latin awards big winner, with 7 nominations and 3 awards.

On 15 September 2008 Guerra was named a UNESCO Artist for Peace &quot;in recognition of his efforts for the benefit of children with disabilities and children in need.&quot;

On 9 May 2009, Guerra was awarded an honorary doctorate from his alma mater, Berklee College of Music at its commencement ceremony.

===2010s===
On 5 April 2010, Guerra released the official video for his new single &quot;Bachata en Fukuoka&quot;. The video was filmed in various locations in the city of Los Angeles, and was directed by Colombian director Simon Brand. On 8 June 2010, Guerra released A son de Guerra which contains eight musical rhythms (bachata, merengue, bolero, Mambo, funk, Rock, Jazz, reggae) and includes the collaboration of Juanes among others. The album contains hits including &quot;La Guagua&quot;, &quot;La Calle&quot;, and &quot;Bachata en Fukuoka&quot;. The first single from his new production, &quot;Bachata en Fukuoka&quot;, placed in the # 1 position on the Hot Latin Tracks, Tropical Songs, and Latin Pop Airplay Songs of the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. Simultaneously, the collaboration of Guerra with Enrique Iglesias on &quot;Cuando me Enamoro&quot; was in the #2 spot on the Rhythm Airplay Chart.

In January 2012, the video for his single &quot;En el cielo no hay Hospital&quot; premiered on YouTube. This song belonged to his new album &quot;Colección Cristiana&quot;. Later that year, he collaborated with the Spanish singer Miguel Bosé on his album Papitwo, in the song &quot;Yo creo en Ti&quot;.

On 25 April 2014, &quot;Tus Besos&quot; was released. It is a bachata song with a music video inspired by the rock and roll of the 1950s. This video was directed by his son Jean Gabriel.

In 2019 during the Carnival of Santa Cruz de Tenerife in Spain, Juan Luis Guerra surpassed the record reached in 1987 by Celia Cruz by bringing together more than 400,000 people as the largest congregation of people in an open-air plaza to attend a concert.

==Singing in other languages==
Guerra has recorded several songs in English, like &quot;July 19th&quot; on his 1994 album &quot;Fogaraté&quot;, and more recently &quot;Medicine for My Soul&quot; and &quot;Something Good&quot; with Italian singer Chiara Civello. Some of his songs have verses in both English and Spanish such as &quot;Woman del Callao&quot;, &quot;Guavaberry&quot;, &quot;Señorita&quot; on his 1995 compilation album &quot;Grandes Exitos&quot; as a bonus track and more recently &quot;&quot;La Llave de Mi Corazón&quot;. The album &quot;Areíto&quot; featured two songs, the cover-title song &quot;Areíto&quot; and &quot;Naboria daca, mayanimacaná&quot;, which are sung in the Arawak language of the extinct Taino natives of Hispaniola. Juan Luis Guerra also recorded the album &quot;Bachata Rosa&quot; in Portuguese. He uses Japanese words in &quot;Bachata en Fukuoka&quot; (Bachata in Fukuoka), 2010 Latin Grammy winner for Best Tropical Song.

==As a composer for other artists==
In 1988, he made his debut as a songwriter for other artists such as fellow Dominican musician Taty Salas, for whom he wrote the music for &quot;De tu boca&quot;, a song with which he participated in the now defunct OTI Festival, reaching the top 3 category. He also composed songs for Mexican artists like Emmanuel (&quot;No he podido verte&quot;, recorded in 1990) and Luis Miguel (&quot;Hasta que me olvides&quot; 1993 and &quot;Te necesito&quot; 2003). He also composed for the Puerto Rican salsa singer Gilberto Santa Rosa in 1994 (&quot;Te Propongo&quot;).

==Lyrical style==
Being a native Dominican, his music is heavily influenced by native Caribbean rhythms, such as merengue and bachata.

His lyrics are often charged with intentionally simple, heavily metaphorical, or popular expressions, such as &quot;Burbujas de Amor&quot; (Bubbles of Love). His lyrics also reflect in political issues, but from a deeply human perspective, that is, centering the lyrics in the human drama that social injustice generates. This is seen in &quot;Visa Para un Sueño&quot; about the broken dream of a visit to America. &quot;El Niágara en Bicicleta&quot; — a title based on the Cuban idiom, &quot;al pasar el Niagara en bicicleta&quot;, meaning a difficult task — describes the negligence that destroys the social health services. &quot;El Costo de La Vida&quot; describes the effects of globalization and government corruption on the working-class people; &quot;Acompáñeme Civil&quot;&quot; (&quot;Accompany me Civilian&quot;) is about police and military corruption that exploits the people that they should care for.

<text>Celanova is a municipality in the province of Ourense, in the autonomous community of Galicia, Spain. It belongs to the comarca of Terra de Celanova. Situated near the border with Portugal, the municipality is bordered by Ramirás, Cartelle, A Merca, A Bola, Verea and Quintela de Leirado.

The Arnoia river crosses the southern limits of the township. The municipality has 6,020 inhabitants. The provincial capital Ourense is located 23 km away on highway N-540 (Ourense to Portugal via Lindoso).

The Monastery of San Salvador de Celanova is the most important building in a well-preserved historical center. It was founded by St. Rudesind (San Rosendo) in 936. The nave is considered the most perfect Galician Baroque church. In the garden of the monastery can be found the pre-Romanesque chapel of San Miguel, one of the oldest in Spain.

The town preserves ancient streets, with several houses that display coats of arms. One of these mansions was the birthplace of the great poet of the Galician Rexurdimento (Rebirth), Manuel Curros Enríquez.

Nearby can be found the castro (pre-Roman citadel) of Castromao. The visitor can still see the circular dwellings and defensive walls built by the Romans.

A few kilometres from the town lies the village of Vilanova dos Infantes with a medieval tower from the 14th century. It belonged to the Counts of Monterrey. Close to this perfectly restored village is the sanctuary of La Virgen del Cristal, in which can be seen a strange transparent stone, perhaps a meteorite, containing what some believe to be the image of the Virgin Mary.

<doc id="319941" wikidata="Q24775038" url="?curid=319941" title="Thaumatin">
<text>Thaumatin (also known as talin) is a low-calorie sweetener and taste modifier. The protein is often used primarily for its flavor-modifying properties and not exclusively as a sweetener.

The thaumatins were first found as a mixture of proteins isolated from the katemfe fruit (&quot;Thaumatococcus daniellii&quot;) (Marantaceae) of West Africa. Although very sweet, thaumatin&#x27;s taste is markedly different from sugar&#x27;s. The sweetness of thaumatin builds very slowly. Perception lasts a long time, leaving a liquorice-like aftertaste at high concentrations. Thaumatin is highly water soluble, stable to heating, and stable under acidic conditions.

== Biological role ==
Thaumatin production is induced in katemfe in response to an attack upon the plant by viroid pathogens. Several members of the thaumatin protein family display significant &quot;in vitro&quot; inhibition of hyphal growth and sporulation by various fungi. The thaumatin protein is considered a prototype for a pathogen-response protein domain. This thaumatin domain has been found in species as diverse as rice and &quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot;.
Thaumatins are pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins, which are induced by various agents ranging from ethylene to pathogens themselves, and are structurally diverse and ubiquitous in plants: They include thaumatin, osmotin, tobacco major and minor PR proteins, alpha-amylase/trypsin inhibitor, and P21 and PWIR2 soybean and wheat leaf proteins. The proteins are involved in systematically-acquired stress resistance and stress responses in plants, although their precise role is unknown. Thaumatin is an intensely sweet-tasting protein (on a molar basis about 100,000 times as sweet as sucrose) found in the fruit of the West African plant &quot;Thaumatococcus daniellii&quot;: it is induced by attack by viroids, which are single-stranded unencapsulated RNA molecules that do not code for protein. The thaumatin protein I consists of a single polypeptide chain of 207 residues.

Like other PR proteins, thaumatin is predicted to have a mainly beta structure, with a high content of beta-turns and little helix. Tobacco cells exposed to gradually increased salt concentrations develop a greatly increased tolerance to salt, due to the expression of osmotin, a member of the PR protein family. Wheat plants attacked by barley powdery mildew express a PR protein (PWIR2), which results in resistance against that infection. The similarity between this PR protein and other PR proteins and the maize alpha-amylase/trypsin inhibitor has suggested that PR proteins may act as some form of inhibitor.

Within West Africa, the katemfe fruit has been locally cultivated and used to flavour foods and beverages for some time. The fruit&#x27;s seeds are encased in a membranous sac, or aril, that is the source of thaumatin. In the 1970s, Tate and Lyle began extracting thaumatin from the fruit. In 1990, researchers at Unilever reported the isolation and sequencing of the two principal proteins found in thaumatin, which they dubbed thaumatin I and thaumatin II. These researchers were also able to express thaumatin in genetically engineered bacteria.

Thaumatin has been approved as a sweetener in the European Union (E957), Israel, and Japan. In the United States, it is generally recognized as safe as a flavouring agent (FEMA GRAS 3732) but not as a sweetener.

==Crystallization==

Since thaumatin crystallizes very quickly and easily in the presence of tartrate ions, thaumatin-tartrate mixtures are frequently used as model systems to study protein crystallization. The solubility of thaumatin, its crystal habit, and mechanism of crystal formation are dependent upon the chirality of precipitant used. When crystallized with L- tartrate, thaumatin forms bipyramidal crystals and displays a solubility that increases with temperature; with D- and meso-tartrate, it forms stubby and prismatic crystals and displays a solubility that decreases with temperature. This suggests control of precipitant chirality may be an important factor in protein crystallization in general.

== Characteristics ==
As a food ingredient, thaumatin is considered to be safe for consumption. In a chewing gum production plant, thaumatin has been identified as an allergen. Switching from using powdered thaumatin to liquid thaumatin reduced symptoms among affected workers. Additionally, eliminating contact with powdered gum arabic (a known allergen) resulted in the disappearance of symptoms in all affected workers.

Thaumatin interacts with human TAS1R3 receptor to produce a sweet taste. The interacting residues are specific to old world monkeys and apes (including humans); only these animals can perceive it as sweet.

<doc id="319947" wikidata="Q1365715" url="?curid=319947" title="Kwame Kilpatrick">
<text>Kwame Malik Kilpatrick (born June 8, 1970) is an American former politician and convicted felon who served as the 72nd mayor of Detroit from 2002 to 2008. A member of the Democratic Party, he previously represented the 9th district in the Michigan House of Representatives from 1997 to 2002. Kilpatrick resigned as mayor in September 2008 after being convicted of perjury and obstruction of justice. He was sentenced to four months in jail and was released on probation after serving 99 days.

In May 2010, Kilpatrick was sentenced to eighteen months to five years in state prison for violating his probation, and served time at the Oaks Correctional Facility in northwest Michigan. In March 2013, he was convicted on 24 federal felony counts, including mail fraud, wire fraud, and racketeering. In October 2013, Kilpatrick was sentenced to 28 years in federal prison, and was incarcerated at the Federal Correctional Institution in El Reno, Oklahoma. In January 2021, after Kilpatrick had served 76 months of his 336-month sentence, President Donald Trump commuted his sentence.

==Early life, education, and family==
Kwame Malik Kilpatrick was born June 8, 1970, to Bernard Kilpatrick and Carolyn Cheeks Kilpatrick. His parents divorced in 1981. Kilpatrick attended Detroit&#x27;s Cass Technical High School and graduated from Florida A&amp;M University with a Bachelor of Science degree in political science in 1992. While at FAMU, he played football under NFL Hall of Famer Ken Riley as an offensive tackle and was team captain. On September 9, 1995, he married Carlita Poles in Detroit. They have three children together, Jalil, Jonas, and Jelani. In 1999 he received a Juris Doctor from Detroit College of Law-Michigan State University He has a sister Ayanna and a half-sister, Diarra.

Kilpatrick&#x27;s mother Carolyn was a career politician, representing Detroit in Michigan House of Representatives from 1979 to 1996 and serving in the United States House of Representatives for Michigan&#x27;s 13th congressional district from 1996 to 2010. She was not re-elected to office because she lost her primary election in August 2010 to State Senator Hansen Clarke. NPR and CBS News both noted that throughout her re-election campaign, Carolyn was dogged by questions about Kilpatrick following his tenure as mayor of Detroit.

Kilpatrick&#x27;s father Bernard was a semi-professional basketball player and politician. He was elected to the Wayne County Commission, served as head of Wayne County Health and Human Services Department from 1989 to 2002, and as chief of staff to former Wayne County Executive Edward H. McNamara. Later he operated a Detroit consulting firm called Maestro Associates.

Kilpatrick filed for divorce from Carlita in 2018. In July 2021 he married Laticia Maria McGee at Historic Little Rock Missionary Baptist Church in Detroit.

==Michigan state representative==
Kilpatrick was elected to the Michigan House of Representatives in 1996 after his mother vacated her Detroit-based seat to mount a successful bid for Congress. Kilpatrick&#x27;s campaign staff consisted of high school classmates Derrick Miller and Christine Beatty, who became his legislative aide; later, Kilpatrick had an affair with Beatty. According to Kilpatrick, the campaign was run on a budget of $10,000 and did not receive endorsements from trade unions, congressional districts, or the Democratic establishment.

Kilpatrick was elected minority floor leader for the Michigan Democratic Party, serving in that position 1998 to 2000. He was subsequently elected as house minority leader in 2001, the first African-American to hold that position. Later in 2001, Kilpatrick ran for mayor of Detroit, hiring Berg/Muirhead Associates for his campaign. They were retained as his public relations firm upon his election. During the 2000 presidential election, Kilpatrick was a Michigan state co-chair of GoreNet. GoreNet was a group that supported Al Gore&#x27;s presidential campaign with a focus on grassroots and online organizing as well as hosting small dollar donor events.

In 2001, Kilpatrick used his influence while in the Michigan legislature to funnel state grant money to two organizations that were vague on their project description. The groups were run by friends of Kilpatrick and both agreed to subcontract work to U.N.I.T.E., a company owned by Kilpatrick&#x27;s wife Carlita. Carlita was the firm&#x27;s only employee, and the firm received $175,000 from the organizations. Detroit 3D was one of the groups and the State canceled its second and final installment of $250,000 because 3D refused to divulge details on how the funds were being spent.

==Mayor of Detroit (2002–2008)==
===First term===
On New Year’s Day 2002, Kilpatrick became the youngest mayor of Detroit when he took office at age 31.

During his first term, Kilpatrick was criticized for using city funds to lease a Lincoln Navigator for use by his family and using his city-issued credit card to charge thousands of dollars&#x27; worth of spa massages, extravagant dining, and expensive wines. Kilpatrick paid back $9,000 of the $210,000 credit card charges. Meanwhile, Kilpatrick closed the century-old Belle Isle Zoo and Belle Isle Aquarium because of the city&#x27;s budget problems. The City Council overrode his funding veto for the zoo and gave it a budget of $700,000.

In 2005, &quot;Time&quot; magazine named Kilpatrick as one of the worst mayors in America.

====Special administratorship====
Since the 1970s, a federal judge had made the mayor of Detroit the special administrator of the Detroit Water Department because of severe pollution issues. When serious questions about water department contracts came to light in late 2005, Judge Feikens ended Kilpatrick&#x27;s special administratorship in his capacity as mayor. In January 2006, &quot;The Detroit News&quot; reported that, &quot;Kilpatrick used his special administrator authority to bypass the water board and City Council on three controversial contracts.&quot; These included a $131 million radio system for the city&#x27;s police and fire departments, as well as a no-bid PR contract to a close personal aide. But Judge Feikens praised Kilpatrick&#x27;s work as steward of the department, referring questions on the contracts to the special master in charge of that investigation.

====Rumored Manoogian Mansion party and Greene killing====

In the fall of 2002, it was alleged that Kilpatrick had held a wild party involving strippers at the Manoogian Mansion, the city-owned residence of the mayor of Detroit. Former members of the Executive Protection Unit (EPU), the mayor&#x27;s police security detail, alleged that Carlita Kilpatrick, Kilpatrick&#x27;s wife, came home unexpectedly and physically attacked an exotic dancer, Tamara Greene. Officer Harold C. Nelthrope contacted the Internal Affairs unit of the Detroit Police Department in April 2003 to recommend that they investigate abuses by the EPU. Kilpatrick denied any wrongdoing. An investigation by Michigan Attorney General Cox and the Michigan State Police found no evidence that the party took place.

Greene was murdered on April 30, 2003, at around 3:40 a.m., near the intersection of Roselawn and West Outer Drive while sitting in her car with her 32-year-old boyfriend. She was shot multiple times with a .40 caliber Glock pistol. At the time, this was the same model and caliber firearm as those officially issued by the Detroit Police Department. The family believed the killing to have been a &quot;deliberate hit&quot;.

Greene&#x27;s family filed a $150 million lawsuit against the city of Detroit in federal court, claiming she was murdered to prevent her testimony about the Manoogian Mansion party. In late 2011, Judge Gerald Ellis Rosen granted summary judgment in favor of the city. Greene&#x27;s children appealed the decision, but the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the district-court decision. Several affidavits were filed in the lawsuit prior to its dismissal; in his summary-judgment order, Judge Rosen wrote, &quot;[I]t is fair to say that the parties—and, in particular, Plaintiffs—were given wide latitude to pursue any and all matters that were arguably relevant to their claims or defenses&quot;. Many affidavits related to whether the party took place and whether Carlita and Greene had been in an altercation. Detroit Police lieutenant Alvin Bowman stated that he had suspected the shooter was a Detroit law-enforcement officer and claimed that high-ranking Detroit Police personnel, including Cummings, deliberately sabotaged his investigation, stating that he was eventually transferred out of the Homicide Division because he had asked too many questions about the Greene murder and the Manoogian Mansion party. Mayer Morganroth, the lawyer representing the city, said, &quot;The Bowman affidavit is a little less than idiotic and more than absurd.&quot;

====Denial of courtesy protection in Washington, D.C.====
In 2002, the Washington D.C. police announced that they would only offer professional courtesy protection to Kilpatrick while he was conducting official business in the nation&#x27;s capital. D.C. police no longer provided after-hours police protection to Kilpatrick because of his inappropriate partying during past visits. Sergeant Tyrone Dodson of Washington D.C. explained by saying &quot;we arrived at this decision because we felt that the late evening partying on the part of Mayor Kilpatrick would leave our officers stretched too thin and might result in an incident at one of the clubs.&quot; The Kilpatrick administration alleged that the statements and actions of the Washington D.C. police were part of a political conspiracy to &quot;ruin&quot; the mayor.

====2005 re-election campaign====

At a campaign rally in May 2005, Kilpatrick&#x27;s father Bernard adamantly argued that allegations that the Mayor had held a party at the Manoogian Mansion were a lie, likening such statements to the false scapegoating of Jewish people by the Nazis. Bernard later apologized. In October 2005, a third-party group supporting Kilpatrick, named Citizens for Honest Government, generated controversy by its print advertisement that compared media criticism of the mayor to lynch mobs and accused his mayoral challenger, Freman Hendrix, as a collaborator in suburban exploitation of Detroit. The PAC treasurer for Citizens for Honest Government, Bill Miller, said his group wasn’t responsible for the ad and that he had no idea who placed it. The Michigan Secretary of State declined to investigate who placed the ad.

Kilpatrick and Hendrix, both Democrats, each initially claimed victory. However, as the votes were tallied, it became clear that Kilpatrick had come back from his stretch of unpopularity to win a second term in office. Three months previously, most commentators declared his political career over after he was the first incumbent mayor of Detroit to come in second in a primary. Pre-election opinion polls predicted a large win for Hendrix; however, Kilpatrick won with 53% of the vote.

===Second term===
In July 2006, Kilpatrick was hospitalized and diagnosed with diverticulitis while in Houston, Texas. His personal physician indicated that Kilpatrick&#x27;s condition may have been caused by a high-protein weight-loss diet. That month, Detroit&#x27;s City Council had voted unanimously to approve Kilpatrick&#x27;s tax plan, with which he intended to offer homeowners some relief from the city&#x27;s high property tax rates. The cuts ranged from 18% to 35%, depending on the property&#x27;s value.

====Audit reports====
The city of Detroit was fourteen months late in filing its 2005–2006 audit. In March 2008, officials estimated the audit would cost an additional $2.4 million because of new auditing requirements that were not addressed by the city. The 2006–2007 fiscal year audit due on December 31, 2007, was expected to be eleven months late.

The state treasury chose to withhold $35 million of its monthly revenue sharing to the city and required Detroit to receive approval before selling bonds to raise money. Kilpatrick told the City Council that he would take partial blame for the late audits because he laid off too many accountants, but he also blamed the firm hired to replace them.

====Abuse of power allegations====
It was revealed on July 15, 2008, by WXYZ reporter Steve Wilson that, in 2005, Kilpatrick, Christine Beatty, and the chief of police Ella Bully-Cummings allegedly used their positions to help an influential Baptist minister arrested for soliciting a prostitute get his case dismissed. The arresting officer, Antoinette Bostic, was told by her supervisors that Mangedwa Nyathi was a minister (Assistant Pastor at Hartford Memorial Baptist Church on Detroit&#x27;s west side), and that the mayor and police chief were calling to persuade Bostic not to show up to court, in which case the judge would be forced to dismiss the case against Nyathi. Bostic ignored her supervisors and appeared in court.

The defense lawyer, Charles Hammons, had the case postponed a couple of times and stated in court that &quot;The mayor told me yesterday that this case is not gonna go forward.&quot; Hammons admitted to Wilson that this was the fact and that this was how many cases for people who know the mayor in Detroit are handled. Bully-Cummings angrily denied that she had ever asked her officers to perform such acts of impropriety. Kilpatrick stated that Wilson of WXYZ &quot;was just making up stories again.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;preacher/prostitute&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reporting on nepotism and preferential hiring of friends and family====
A 2008 &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; article revealed that at any given time there were about 100 Kilpatrick appointees were employed with the city. &quot;The Detroit Free Press&quot; examined city records and found that 29 of Kilpatrick&#x27;s closest friends and family were appointed to positions in various city departments. This hiring practice came to be known as &#x27;the friends and family plan.&#x27; Some appointees had little or no experience, while others including Kilpatrick&#x27;s uncle Ray Cheeks and cousin Nneka Cheeks, falsified their résumés. Kilpatrick&#x27;s cousin Patricia Peoples was appointed deputy director of human resources, giving her the ability to hire more of Kilpatrick&#x27;s friends and family without the hirings being viewed as mayoral appointments. Although political appointments are not illegal, the sheer volume of Kilpatrick&#x27;s appointments compared to appointments made by predecessor mayors since 1970, along with Kilpatrick&#x27;s elimination of thousands of city jobs, made his appointments controversial.

The jobs held by friends and family ranged from secretaries to department heads. The appointees had an average salary increase of 36% compared with a 2% raises in 2003 and 2004 for fellow city workers. Some of the biggest salary increases were for April Edgar, half-sister of Christine Beatty, whose pay increased 86% over 5 years. One of Kilpatrick&#x27;s cousins, Ajene Evans, had a 77% salary increase during this 5-year period. The biggest salary increase among the 29 appointees was that of LaTonya Wallace-Hardiman who went from $32,500 staff secretary, to an executive assistant making $85,501—163% in five years.

====2008 assault of a police officer====
On July 24, 2008, at approximately 4 p.m., Wayne County Sheriff&#x27;s Detective Brian White and Joanne Kinney, an investigator from Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy&#x27;s office, went to the home of Kilpatrick&#x27;s sister to serve a subpoena. While on the front porch of the home, Kilpatrick exited the house with his bodyguards and pushed the sheriff&#x27;s deputy, as Sheriff Warren Evans said, &quot;with significant force to make [the deputy] bounce into the prosecutor&#x27;s investigator.&quot; The mayor yelled at Kinney &quot;How can a black woman be riding in a car with a man named White?&quot;

Evans went on to say &quot;There were armed executive protection officers. My officers were there armed. And all of them had the consummate good sense not to let it escalate&quot;... and &quot;the two officers &#x27;wisely&#x27; left the property and returned to their office to report on the incident.&quot;

Sheriff Evans stated that due to the &quot;politically charged nature&quot; of the incident, the case was transferred to the Michigan State Police to investigate. Evans&#x27;s daughter, who was on Kilpatrick&#x27;s staff, resigned shortly thereafter.

====Events leading to resignation====
=====Text-messaging scandal and coverup=====

In 2003, a civil lawsuit was filed against Kilpatrick by ex-bodyguard Harold Nelthrope and former Deputy Police Chief Gary Brown, who claimed they were fired in retaliation for an internal-affairs investigation. Brown had led the investigation, and Nelthrope had told investigators about the aforementioned rumors of a party that occurred at the Mayor&#x27;s mansion. Both claimed that Kilpatrick was motivated, in part, by his concern that the probe would uncover his extramarital affairs. The trial began in August 2007. Kilpatrick and his chief of staff, Christine Beatty, both testified under oath that they were not involved in an extramarital affair. In September 2007, after three hours of deliberation, the jury found in favor of Nelthrope and Brown, awarding $6.5 million in damages. After the verdict was read, Kilpatrick said that the racial composition of the jury—which was mostly white and suburban—had played a role in the outcome and vowed an appeal.
In October, plaintiffs&#x27; attorney Mike Stefani received thousands of text messages he had been endeavoring to obtain via subpoena—the messages indicated an affair between Kilpatrick and Beatty. A day after he presented the files to the city&#x27;s attorneys, Kilpatrick announced that he had agreed to settle the case, and the city counsel approved the $8.4 million deal, which included a proviso that Stefani would turn the files over to the mayor. After the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; filed a Michigan Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, the proviso was removed from the main settlement document and put into a confidential supplement. But the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; and &quot;The Detroit News&quot; filed a FOIA suit, seeking all settlement-related documents, and, in February 2008, the Michigan Supreme Court ordered the settlement documents be turned over to the plaintiffs. The bulk of the text messages were released in late October 2008 by Circuit Court Judge Timothy Kenny, who instructed that some portions be redacted.

Beatty resigned from her position as Kilpatrick&#x27;s chief of staff. The City Council requested that Kilpatrick resign as mayor and that Governor Granholm use her authority to remove him from office. Granholm said the inquiry was like a trial and that her role would be &quot;functioning in a manner similar to that of a judicial officer.&quot; Kilpatrick said he had paid back the $8.4 million through &quot;hard work for the city&quot; and dismissed any intentions of removing himself from office as &quot;political rhetoric&quot;.

=====2008 State of the City address=====
In March 2008, Kilpatrick delivered his seventh &quot;State of the City&quot; address to the city of Detroit. The speech marked a turning point in his career. The majority of the 70-minute speech focused on positive changes occurring throughout Detroit and future plans. Kilpatrick specifically noted increased police surveillance, new policing technologies, and initiatives to rebuild blighted neighborhoods. He received repeated standing ovations from the invitation-only audience.

Toward the end of the speech, Kilpatrick deviated from the transcript given to the media and posted on his official website to address the scandals and controversies surrounding his years in office, saying that the media had focused on those controversies only to increase their viewership, and that their focus had led to racist attacks against him and his family.

Kilpatrick&#x27;s comments generated many negative responses. Michigan Governor and fellow Democrat Jennifer Granholm issued a statement in which she condemned the use of the N-word in any context. Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox stated on WJR talk radio that he thought that using the N-word was &quot;reprehensible&quot;, saying, &quot;I thought his statements were race-baiting on par with David Duke and George Wallace, all to save his political career. I&#x27;m not a Detroiter, but last night crossed the line ... those statements not only hurt Detroit, [but] as long as the mayor is there, he will be a drag on the whole region.&quot; Cox said that whether Kilpatrick is criminally charged or not, he should resign as mayor. Former Kilpatrick political adviser Sam Riddle labeled the address a race-baiting speech. &quot;It&#x27;s an act of desperation to use the N-word,&quot; said Riddle. &quot;He&#x27;s attempting to regain his base of support by playing the race card. He&#x27;s gone to that well one too many times.&quot;

=====Recall campaign=====
The Wayne County Election Committee approved a recall petition to remove Kilpatrick as mayor based, in part, on the accusation that Kilpatrick misled the City Council into approving the settlement. The recall petition was filed by Douglas Johnson, a city council candidate. Kilpatrick appealed to the commission to reconsider its decision on the grounds that Johnson was not a resident of Detroit. Johnson also requested that Jennifer Granholm use her power as Governor to remove Kilpatrick from office.

On March 12, 2008, at the request of the Mayor&#x27;s office, Wayne County Election Commission rescinded its earlier approval for the recall. The Mayor&#x27;s office argued that there was not any evidence that the organizer, Douglas Johnson, actually resided within the city limits of Detroit. Johnson stated that his group would refile using another person whose residency would not be an issue. On March 27, 2008, a second recall petition was filed against Kilpatrick by Angelo Brown. Brown stated in his filing that Kilpatrick is too preoccupied with his legal problems to be effective. Kilpatrick&#x27;s spokesman James Canning again dismissed this latest recall by saying: &quot;It&#x27;s Mr. Brown&#x27;s right to file a petition, but it&#x27;s just another effort by a political hopeful to grab headlines.&quot;

On May 14 the Detroit City Council voted to request that the governor of Michigan, Jennifer Granholm, remove Kilpatrick from office.

==Criminal charges and resignation ==
On March 24, 2008, Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy announced a twelve-count criminal indictment against Kilpatrick and Beatty, charging Kilpatrick with eight felonies and Beatty with seven. Charges for both included perjury, misconduct in office, and obstruction of justice. Worthy suggested that others in the Kilpatrick administration could also be charged.
The preliminary examination scheduled for September 22, 2008, was waived by both defendants, thereby allowing the case to proceed directly to trial.

In July 2008, Kilpatrick violated the terms of his bail by briefly traveling to Windsor, Ontario, where he met with Windsor mayor Eddie Francis concerning a deal to have the city of Windsor take over operational control of the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel in exchange for a $75 million loan. As a result, on August 7, 2008, Kilpatrick was remanded to spend a night in the Wayne County Jail. It was the first time in history that a sitting Detroit mayor had been ordered to jail. In issuing the order, Chief Judge Ronald Giles stated that he could not treat the mayor differently from &quot;John Six-Pack.&quot; On August 8, 2008, after arguments on Kilpatrick&#x27;s behalf by attorneys Jim Parkman and Jim Thomas, Judge Thomas Jackson reversed the remand order and permitted Kilpatrick to be released on posting a $50,000 cash bond and the further condition that the mayor not travel, and wear an electronic tracking device.

The same day Kilpatrick was released under the second bail agreement, Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox announced that two new felony counts had been filed against the mayor for assaulting or interfering with a law officer. The new charges arose out of allegations that Kilpatrick on July 24, 2008, shoved two Wayne County Sheriff&#x27;s Deputies who were attempting to serve a subpoena on Bobby Ferguson, a Kilpatrick ally, and a potential witness in the mayor&#x27;s then-upcoming perjury trial.

On September 4, 2008, Kilpatrick announced his resignation as mayor, effective September 18, and pleaded guilty to two felony counts of obstruction of justice and pleaded no contest to assaulting the deputy. Kilpatrick had agreed to resign as part of the plea agreement, in which he also agreed to serve four months in the Wayne County Jail, pay one million dollars of restitution to the city of Detroit, surrender his license to practice law, submit to five years probation and not run for public office during his probation period, and surrender his state pension from his six years&#x27; service in the Michigan House of Representatives before being elected mayor. In an allocution given as part of his plea, Kilpatrick admitted that he lied under oath several times.

In the separate assault case, he pleaded no contest to one felony count of assaulting and obstructing a police officer in exchange for a second assault charge being dropped. This deal also required his resignation and 120 days in jail, to be served concurrently with his jail time for the perjury counts. Kilpatrick was sentenced on October 28, 2008. The judge ordered that Kilpatrick not be given an opportunity for early release, but instead serve the entire 120 days in jail.

Detroit City Council President Kenneth Cockrel, Jr. replaced Kilpatrick as mayor at 12:01 a.m. September 19, 2008.

===First sentencing===
Judge David Groner sentenced Kilpatrick to four months in jail on October 28, 2008, calling him &quot;arrogant and defiant&quot; and questioning the sincerity of a guilty plea that ended his career at City Hall. The punishment was part of a plea agreement worked out a month earlier. &quot;When someone gets 120 days in jail, they should get 120 days in jail,&quot; Groner said. Kilpatrick also was given a 120-day concurrent sentence for assaulting a sheriff&#x27;s officer who was trying to deliver a subpoena in July. He was seen smirking, laughing, and even calling the sentencing a &quot;joke&quot;.

Wayne County Sheriff Warren Evans said that they take 40,000 prisoners into the prison annually, but that Kilpatrick would be kept separate from the general population and &quot;won&#x27;t be treated any worse or any better than other prisoners.&quot;
He was housed in a secured, 15 feet by 10 feet cell with a bed, chair, toilet and a shower, spending approximately 23 hours a day there. At 12:35 a.m. on Tuesday, February 3, 2009, Kilpatrick left jail after serving 99 days. He boarded a privately chartered Lear jet and landed in Texas that evening. He was supposed to join his family in a $3,000 per month rental house in Southlake, Texas.

Within a couple of weeks, Kilpatrick was hired by Covisint, a Texas subsidiary of Compuware, headquartered in Detroit. CEO of Compuware Peter Karmanos, Jr. was one of the parties who loaned large sums of money to Kilpatrick in late 2008. Kilpatrick was let go from Compuware in May 2010 after being sentenced to prison.

====Restitution hearing====
Kilpatrick claimed poverty to Judge David Groner. He said he only had $3,000 per month (later lowered to $6) for the restitution payments.

Judge Groner requested detailed financial records for Kilpatrick, his wife, their children, etc. By November 2009, Kilpatrick was on the stand in Detroit to explain his apparent poverty. He claimed to have no knowledge about who paid for his million-dollar home, Cadillac Escalades, and other lavish expenses. The former mayor also denied any knowledge of his wife&#x27;s finances, or even whether she was employed. During this hearing, it was revealed that Peter Karmanos Jr., Roger Penske and other business leaders had provided substantial monies to the Kilpatricks to convince the mayor to resign his office and plead guilty. On January 20, 2010, Judge Groner ruled that Kilpatrick pay the sum of $300,000 to the city of Detroit within 90 days.

===Second sentencing===
On February 19, 2010, Kilpatrick missed a required restitution payment of $79,000. The court received only $14,000 on February 19 and then only another $21,175 on February 22. On February 23, Judge Groner approved a warrant for Kilpatrick and ruled in April that he had violated the terms of his probation. On May 25, 2010, Kilpatrick was sentenced to one and a half to five years with the Michigan Department of Corrections (with credit for 120 days previously served) for violation of probation, and was afterwards taken back into correctional custody. He was housed for fourteen days in the hospital unit of the state prisoner reception center. Kilpatrick was later housed in the Oaks Correctional Facility.

After he was indicted in federal court for additional crimes related to alleged misuse of his campaign funds, Kilpatrick lobbied for a transfer from the Oaks Correctional Facility. On July 11, 2010, he was transferred into the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP). Kilpatrick was incarcerated in the Milan Federal Prison near Milan, Michigan. He was released from federal custody on April 6, 2011. During his final 118 days of state imprisonment, Kilpatrick resided in the Cotton Correctional Facility. Kilpatrick was released on parole on August 2, 2011. In August 2011 the court ordered Kilpatrick to pay for his incarceration costs.

==Second criminal trial and conviction==
On December 14, 2010, Kilpatrick was again indicted on new corruption charges, in what a federal prosecutor called a &quot;pattern of extortion, bribery and fraud&quot; by some of the city&#x27;s most prominent officials. His father, Bernard Kilpatrick, was also indicted, as was contractor Bobby Ferguson; Kilpatrick&#x27;s aide, Derrick Miller; and Detroit water department chief Victor Mercado. The original 38-charge indictment listed allegations of 13 fraudulent schemes in awarding contracts in the city&#x27;s Department of Water and Sewerage, with pocketed kickbacks of nearly $1,000,000. He was arraigned on January 10, 2011, on charges in the 89-page indictment. Federal prosecuting attorneys proposed a trial date in January 2012, but defense attorneys asked for a trial date in the summer of 2012.

Opening statements in the trial began on September 21, 2012. Prosecutors soon brought forth a large number of witnesses who gave damaging testimony. Mercado took a plea deal while the trial was in progress. On March 11, 2013, in spite of a vigorous defense that cost taxpayers more than a million dollars, Kilpatrick was found guilty by a jury on two dozen counts including those for racketeering, extortion, mail fraud, and tax evasion, among others. Shortly after conviction, speaking about Kilpatrick, Judge Nancy Edmunds ruled in favor of remand saying &quot;detention is required in his circumstance&quot;.

He was sentenced to 28 years in prison on October 10, 2013. Kilpatrick, Federal Bureau of Prisons Register #44678-039, was serving his sentence at Federal Correctional Institution, Oakdale, a low-security prison in Oakdale, Louisiana. There is no parole in the federal prison system. However, with time off for good behavior, his earliest possible release date was August 1, 2037—when he would be 67 years old.

Mercado pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy, Bobby Ferguson was sentenced to 21 years in prison, Derrick Miller pleaded guilty to tax evasion and was sentenced to three years supervision, the first year in a halfway house. Bernard Kilpatrick was sentenced to 15 months in prison. Emma Bell received two years probation and was fined $330,000 in back taxes as part of a plea deal where she testified that she frequently handed Kilpatrick large amounts of cash skimmed from campaign accounts.

First Independence Bank, used by Kilpatrick and Ferguson, was fined $250,000 for failing to follow anti-money-laundering regulations. 14 companies were suspended from bidding on contracts with the water department in the wake of the scandal. Inland Waters Pollution Control Inc. paid $4.5 million in the settlement of a lawsuit over their involvement with Kilpatrick, Ferguson and the Detroit Water Board. Lakeshore TolTest Corp. reached a $5 million settlement with the Water Board to avoid litigation.

In August 2015, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit upheld his convictions but ordered that the amount of restitution be recalculated. In June 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court denied his appeal.

In June 2018 Kilpatrick began seeking a pardon from President Donald Trump. His application was opposed by the U.S. Attorney&#x27;s Office for southeast Michigan. Restitution claims and other civil lawsuits accumulated claimed $10 million in debts, for which Kilpatrick is responsible. Kilpatrick has no assets to settle these claims.

===Commutation of sentence===
On January 20, 2021, President Donald Trump commuted Kilpatrick&#x27;s sentence with less than 12 hours remaining before he was due to leave office as president. The White House statement on the commutation of Kilpatrick reads: &quot;Mr. Kilpatrick has served approximately 7 years in prison for his role in a racketeering and bribery scheme while he held public office. During his incarceration, Mr. Kilpatrick has taught public speaking classes and has led Bible Study groups with his fellow inmates.&quot;

President Trump&#x27;s commutation allowed Kilpatrick to gain release 20 years early, though it did not vacate his conviction. The commutation left in place the almost $4.8 million in restitution and the three-year probation. Kilpatrick will not be able to run for office in Michigan until 2033 as a felon is excluded from politics for 20 years after conviction under Michigan law.

==Other post-mayoral legal developments==
In 2012, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Kilpatrick and former city treasurer Jeffrey W. Beasley for having received $180,000 in travel, hotel rooms, and gifts from a company seeking investments from the city pension fund. Chauncey C. Mayfield and his company were also brought before administrative proceedings. The company received a $117 million investment in a real estate investment trust that it controlled. MayfieldGentry proceeded to misappropriate $3.1 million from the pension fund which was revealed during the influence peddling investigation. Mayfield pleaded guilty in 2013. The case was scheduled for June 2014.

According to &quot;The Detroit News&quot; (June 24, 2010), Kilpatrick, his father Bernard, and the Kilpatrick Civic Fund may have been important figures in the sludge hauling contract that saw city council president Monica Conyers (wife of Rep. John Conyers) and her chief of staff Sam Riddle convicted for conspiracy and bribery. &quot;Kilpatrick and his father also figured, but have not been charged, in evidence surrounding a bribery-tainted, $1.2 billion sewage sludge contract the Detroit City Council awarded to Synagro Technologies Inc. in 2007. According to court documents and people familiar with the case, former Synagro official James Rosendall made large contributions to the Kilpatrick Civic Fund and gave Kilpatrick free flights to Las Vegas and Mackinac Island. Rosendall also told investigators he made cash payments to Bernard N. Kilpatrick, who told Rosendall he got him access to City Hall, records show.&quot; Rosendall and a Synagro consultant Rayford Jackson were also convicted of bribery.

==Memoir==
Kilpatrick co-wrote a memoir about his life and political experiences titled &quot;Surrendered: The Rise, Fall, &amp; Revelation of Kwame Kilpatrick&quot;. The book was originally scheduled for release on August 2, 2011, a date that would have just barely preceded his scheduled release from a Michigan prison. However, the publisher delayed the release to August 9, almost a week after Kilpatrick was paroled. Kilpatrick appeared at public events in Michigan and elsewhere to promote his book.

The public prosecutor in Wayne County, Michigan has asked the state courts to order the book&#x27;s publisher, Tennessee-based Creative Publishing Consultants Inc., to remit Kilpatrick&#x27;s share on the book&#x27;s proceeds for payment toward Kilpatrick&#x27;s criminal restitution and his cost of incarceration. On November 16, 2011, the publisher&#x27;s attorney failed to appear at a hearing on the matter in Wayne County Circuit Court. A bench warrant was issued for the attorney, Jack Gritton, and was forwarded to authorities in Tennessee, where Gritton&#x27;s practice is based.

== Post-release activities ==
Since release, Kilpatrick has worked as an &quot;ordained minister, motivational speaker, consultant, and certified character coach&quot;. In April 2023, Kilpatrick was a guest speaker at the &quot;Black Agenda Movement&quot; conference, organized by YouTuber Michelle R. Kulczyk (Meechi X).

On June 15, 2024, Kilpatrick endorsed Donald Trump in the 2024 United States presidential election.

===Affiliations===
As a politician, Kilpatrick was a member of the Democratic Party.

Kilpatrick was a member of the Mayors Against Illegal Guns Coalition, a bi-partisan anti-gun group with a stated goal of &quot;making the public safer by getting illegal guns off the streets.&quot; The Coalition was co-chaired by Mayor Thomas Menino of Boston and Michael Bloomberg of New York City. Following Kilpatrick&#x27;s conviction in 2013 on federal charges, his membership status in the organization was initially not clear. As of September 2010, there had been no announcement of his resignation from Mayors Against Illegal Guns; however, by December 2012, he was no longer listed as a member.

<text>Kladno (; ) is a city in the Central Bohemian Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 69,000 inhabitants. It is the largest city in the region and has a rich industrial history.

==Administrative division==
Kladno consists of six municipal parts (in brackets population according to the 2021 census):

*Kladno (22,585)
*Dubí (2,059)
*Kročehlavy (34,972)
*Rozdělov (2,678)
*Švermov (5,038)
*Vrapice (424)
==Etymology==
The name Kladno is derived from the Czech word &quot;kláda&quot;, meaning &quot;log&quot;. In Old Czech, the word &quot;kladno&quot; denoted a mature forest from which logs were obtained.

==Geography==
Kladno is located about northwest of Prague. It lies in a mostly flat landscape of the Prague Plateau, albeit in the north the terrain becomes hillier. The highest point is at above sea level, and the lowest at above sea level. There are no large bodies of water within city limits, only several small creeks. The city limits contain two nature monuments: Žraločí zuby and Krnčí a Voleška.

==History==
The first written mention of Kladno is from 1318, when it was a property of the Kladenský of Kladno noble family. After 1543, when the Kladenský of Kladno family died out, it became a property of the Žďárský of Žďár family. In 1561, the settlement was granted the town status.

In 1566, the Žďárskýs of Žďár rebuilt the local fort into a Renaissance castle. The town walls were built in the following decades. The town prospered until the Battle of White Mountain in 1620, when it was looted by Polish Cossacks. However, during the rule of Florián Jetřich Žďárský, the town began to prosper again. After the Bohemian branch of the Ždárský family died out in 1670, the town changed hands several times before it was bought by the Benedictine Břevnov Monastery in 1705.

In the 18th century, the town began to expand beyond its walls. In 19th century, the town developed into a significant agricultural and industrial centre. Bituminous coal was first discovered within the present city limits in 1775, but significant mining activity only started in 1850 and intensified over the following decades. In 1855–1856, the city was connected to the railway network. The coal reserves began attracting the iron working industry, the largest of which eventually became the Poldi steelworks, founded in 1899. The growth of industrial activity spurred a massive population growth. In 1870, Kladno was promoted to a city by Emperor Franz Joseph I, and in 1898 it was awarded the honorary title of &quot;royal mining town&quot;.

Until 1918, Kladno was head of the Kladno district in Austria-Hungary, one of the 94 &quot;Bezirkshauptmannschaften&quot; in Bohemia. In the 20th century, the city was one of the centres of the Czech labor movement, with frequent strikes, protests and labor action.

The city&#x27;s prosperity was once again interrupted by World War II, when it was ruled by the Nazis. In 1941, several surrounding municipalities (Kročehlavy, Rozdělov, Dubí, Dříň and Újezd) were annexed to Kladno. Vrapice was annexed in 1950 and the town of Švermov in 1980.

The post-war history of Kladno was influenced by the philosophy of the communist regime. The city&#x27;s development was determined by migration of labor forces unrelated to the city, by the construction of unified large housing estates and by an effort to erase the original buildings of the city centre. The focus on industrial production resulted in environmental damages. On 21 August 1968, Kladno was occupied for the second time in thirty years, this time by the Soviet Army.

After the socialist regime fell in 1989, Kladno struggled to adapt to a market economy. The operations of previously prosperous companies were terminated. In 2000, Kladno became a statutory city.

==Demographics==
==Economy==

Kladno was one of the historical birthplaces of heavy industry in Bohemia. For years, the city was home to the Poldi steel factory, the region&#x27;s largest employer. Since economic restructuring in the 1990s, the heavy industry has largely been replaced by services and light industry.

A number of companies has established production in Kladno, including Lego, NKT Cables, La Lorraine, Hanon Systems and Dr. Oetker. Lego is one of the largest employers in the region with more than 3,000 employees.

==Transport==
Kladno is located at a railway junction. It lies on the railway lines Prague–Kralupy nad Vltavou and Kladno–Rakovník. The city is served by six stations and stops.

==Sport==
The city is known as the home of many internationally known ice hockey players, such as Jaromír Jágr and Tomáš Plekanec. Its ice hockey club, Rytíři Kladno, was successful in the past and is connected with many famous players of Czech ice hockey history, including 1998 Olympic gold medalists Jaromír Jágr, Pavel Patera, Martin Procházka, Libor Procházka and Milan Hnilička. The club plays in the top tier, with Jaromír Jágr as its owner and president.

The local football club SK Kladno played in the Czech First League in 2006–2010, but since 2013 has played in the fourth tier.

The city hosts various athletic events including the TNT – Fortuna Meeting in June, and the Kladno Marathon in September each year.

==Sights==
The Kladno Castle was originally a Gothic fortress, rebuilt in the Renaissance style in the 1560s, then completely rebuilt into a Baroque castle in 1737–1740 by the architect Kilian Ignaz Dientzenhofer. Today it houses a museum and gallery. Next to the castle is a castle park with a beararium built in 2001.

There are several major landmarks of Kladno on the Starosty Pavla Square. The Church of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary was built in the Neo-Romanesque style in 1897–1899. It was built on the site of a Gothic church from the 1350s. The city hall is a Neo-Renaissance house, which was built in 1897–1898. The Marian sculpture group was created according to the design by K. I. Dietzenhofer in 1739–1741. This late Baroque columns stands on the site where the pillory used to be. Notable is also the Archdeaconry building, originally a rectory built in 1804–1807.

The Chapel of Saint Florian is a significant Baroque chapel. It is the last project of K. I. Dietzenhofer before his death. The construction started in 1751 and after being interrupted, it was completed in 1827.

The former synagogue is a Neo-Renaissance building from 1884. Today it serves as a prayer house of the Czechoslovak Hussite Church.

There are four churches in the local parts of Kladno. The Church of Saint John the Baptist in Dubí was originally a Gothic church, first documented in 1352. In 1861, it was rebuilt into its current form with a Neogothic tower. It is a pilgrimage site. The Church of Saint Nicholas in Vrapice was a Romanesque rotunda from the early 13th century, rebuilt in the Gothic style around 1400. It was then rebuilt and extended in 1858. The Church of Saint Wenceslaus in Rozdělov is modern, built in 1925–1927. The Church of Saint Nicholas in Švermov, built in 1912–1913, is a mixture of Art Nouveau and Modernism.

<text>Aaron Bank (November 23, 1902 – April 1, 2004) was a United States Army colonel who founded the US Army Special Forces, commonly known as the &quot;Green Berets&quot;. He is also known for his exploits as an OSS officer during World War II, when he parachuted into France to coordinate the French Resistance and organizing an operation intended to capture Adolf Hitler. In retirement, Bank warned about terrorism and modern technology. He is largely responsible for the high level of security at U.S. nuclear power plants since the early 1970s.

==Biography==

===World War II career===
Bank grew up in New York City, the son of Russian Jewish immigrants. His father died in 1904 and his widowed mother raised him while earning a living by teaching French, German, and piano. As a young man, Bank worked as a life guard on Long Island, NY and in the Bahamas and later on he was chief life guard at an upscale resort in Biarritz.

He enlisted in the Army on August 19, 1942, then volunteered for special operations work. He was in his late thirties, and thought &quot;too old&quot; for combat, but he was an unusually athletic man and so was accepted into the Office of Strategic Services (OSS).

The OSS conducted espionage operations (SI Branch) and special operations (SO Branch) for sabotage and guerrilla warfare. Bank was assigned to SO and the Operational Group Command, and on July 31, 1944, led the Jedburgh Team PACKARD, parachuting into Lozère Department of France and linking up with French Resistance.

At the time of &quot;Operation Anvil&quot;, also known as &quot;Operation Dragoon&quot; (the Allied invasion of Southern France about six weeks after the D-Day invasion at Normandy), Bank and his French partisans drove the German forces away from the beachhead ahead of the Allied troops, liberating a number of French towns before the regular forces arrived.

In late 1944 and early 1945, Bank led &quot;Operation Iron Cross,&quot; which evolved into a plan to capture or kill Adolf Hitler. The OSS recruited German POWs who were opposed to Hitler, finding many volunteers among former German soldiers, primarily former German Communists, and German Jews who had taken refuge in the Wehrmacht, posing as Gentiles. They formed a special forces unit trained as parachute infantry. Outfitted with SS uniforms and trained for &quot;raid and snatch&quot; missions, they were intended for insertion into the expected &quot;Alpine Redoubt&quot; on the Austrian/German border, where senior Nazi officials were planning to make their last stand against the advancing Allied armies.

Hitler was expected to flee from Berlin and retire to the Alpine Redoubt before the Soviets could enter the capital city, so General William Joseph Donovan, head of the OSS, issued this order: &quot;Tell Bank to get Hitler.&quot;

&quot;Iron Cross&quot; was canceled almost on the eve of execution because intelligence showed that Hitler had remained in Berlin. (He committed suicide in his Berlin bunker on April 30, 1945.) Additionally, the 101st Airborne and 7th Army divisions were advancing so rapidly they were expected to capture the non-existent Alpine Redoubt before &quot;Iron Cross&quot; could be executed. (Bank&#x27;s enemy-uniformed volunteers would also be prime targets for allied forces.)

With the capitulation of Germany in May 1945, Bank was reassigned to the Pacific theater, where he was inserted into Indochina and linked up with Ho Chi Minh, then leading the resistance to the Japanese. Bank spent considerable time traveling through Vietnam with Ho and was impressed with Ho&#x27;s manifest popularity among the Vietnamese population. Bank advised the OSS of Ho&#x27;s great popularity, recommended that Ho be allowed to form a coalition government, and predicted that Ho would win a popular election overwhelmingly if one was conducted.

It is not known whether Bank&#x27;s recommendations reached President Harry S. Truman, but American policy was contrary: Ho was a long-time Communist, having joined the party in the 1920s in Paris, and therefore was considered unacceptable as leader of a coalition government. Some French &quot;Vichy&quot; military forces remained in Indochina, and the United States now consented to the use of these residual forces to block Ho and reinstate Indochina as a French colony. President Truman and later President Dwight D. Eisenhower provided financial support to the French, thus leading to the Indochina War and ultimately the Vietnam War.

Bank was accused by French officials of proliferating anti-French propaganda amongst Lao Issara and Viet Minh nationalist groups. These events reached a climax on September 27, 1945, when a British party, led by Peter Kemp crossed the Mekong from their base in northeast Thailand and were surrounded by an armed Viet Minh patrol, who demanded the surrender of a French lieutenant. The Viet Minh assassinated the French lieutenant, even though he was under the protection of the British. An American OSS officer, Lt. Reese, was with Kemp and the French officer and stood aside, stating that he was &quot;neutral&quot;. Kemp believed that had Reese shown some mettle the French officer would not have been killed. Bank and the OSS mission were recalled by authorities in Kunming.

===Post-war activities and the founding of the Special Forces===
After the war Bank remained in the Army and became a leading advocate for the formation of a professional special forces (unconventional warfare) division, equivalent to the SO branch of OSS. Along with Colonel Russell W. Volckmann, who had been a guerrilla in the Philippines, they argued for deploying this force behind the &quot;Iron Curtain,&quot; in the Eastern European nations dominated by the Soviet Union, where there was a real possibility of a local resistance movement arising.

In 1952, Bank became the first commander of the Army&#x27;s first Special Forces unit, called the 10th Special Forces Group, a number which was selected to confound the Russians with suspicions of nine more such units. In establishing the 10th, he was as flexible as he had been with &quot;Iron Cross&quot;, drawing upon former members of the &quot;1st Special Service Force&quot; known as the Devil&#x27;s Brigade, as well as veterans of the OSS, the Parachute Infantry units, and guerrilla elements in the Pacific.

Using the training and strategies and the lessons learned during World War II, Bank created an elite unit of men skilled in foreign languages (to interface with foreign insurgents), the arts of sabotage and stealth tactics, the use of explosives for demolition, amphibious warfare, rock climbing, jungle warfare, mountain fighting and as ski troops.

Special Forces today are still all volunteer and organized into &quot;A teams,&quot; as Bank organized his men in the 10th Special Forces group in 1952, with two experts in every specialty. They still undergo an arduous training process in which large numbers of men fail or quit, as Bank required of the men of &quot;Operation Iron Cross&quot;.

Bank was commended by President George W. Bush in 2002, the year he celebrated his hundredth birthday, for developing the unconventional warfare programs and techniques that were used in toppling the Taliban.

===Later years===
Bank retired from the Army in 1958, and remained a vigorous man well into his eighties, swimming several miles a day in the Pacific Ocean near his home in San Clemente, California.

In the early 1970s, Bank began a personal investigation of the lack of security at the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station, which is a few miles south of San Clemente. Bank determined that the San Onofre plant was protected by one private security guard with a sidearm, as if the only concern was civilian theft. Bank concluded that a single special forces soldier could overcome this guard, seize the plant and destroy it with a small quantity of explosives. The consequence could be a Chernobyl-type accident, whereby the damaged plant would emit radioactivity into the atmosphere and contaminate thousands of square miles, including the nearby Los Angeles Basin.

Bank became alarmed at the recklessness of the civilian operators of San Onofre, and actively lobbied, then testified before a closed session of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, warning of the dangers of terrorist sabotage at San Onofre. As one of the world&#x27;s leading experts on the sabotage of electric generating facilities, Bank spoke with great authority, but the AEC ultimately ignored these efforts and did not change the policy of the plant.

Bank then shared his concerns with an investigative journalist, who wrote an exposé of poor security at San Onofre for the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists in 1974. This led to a Congressional investigation and further secret testimony by Bank before a Congressional committee. This time, Bank&#x27;s testimony was heeded, and Congressional pressure forced the AEC and its successor, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, to act. The U.S. nuclear power industry was ordered to spend billions of dollars implementing anti-terrorist security measures at commercial nuclear reactors nationwide, including on-site security squads with automatic weapons, remote scram capabilities (to take control of the plant from a distance and shut it down in the event of an attack) and the use of &quot;red teams&quot; to probe defenses and thereby eliminate vulnerabilities.

He served in the late 1970s as the chief of Security for the Capistrano Bay Community Services District on Beach Road, a private community of homes along Capistrano Beach, next to Dana Point, California.

==Personal life==
Bank married German-born Catherine Suzanne Wagner on August 4, 1948, in Munich, and they had two daughters, Linda and Alexandra. He wrote two books, first, &quot;From OSS to Green Berets: the Birth of Special Forces,&quot; which describes his exploits in France and Indochina and his role in founding the Special Forces and then &quot;Knight&#x27;s Cross&quot;, a fictionalized account of a completed Operation Iron Cross which was co-written with E. M. Nathanson. He died on April 1, 2004, in Dana Point, California, at the age of 101. He is buried at Riverside National Cemetery in Riverside, California.

<doc id="319973" wikidata="Q768155" url="?curid=319973" title="1967 Detroit riot">
<text>The 1967 Detroit riot, also known as the 12th Street Riot and the Detroit Uprising, was the bloodiest of the urban riots in the United States during the &quot;long, hot summer of 1967&quot;. Composed mainly of confrontations between African American residents and the Detroit Police Department, it began in the early morning hours of Sunday July 23, 1967, in Detroit, Michigan.

The precipitating event was a police raid of an unlicensed, after-hours bar, known as a &quot;blind pig&quot;, on the city&#x27;s Near West Side. It exploded into one of the deadliest and most destructive social insurgences in American history, lasting five days and surpassing the scale of Detroit&#x27;s 1943 race riot 24 years earlier.

Governor George W. Romney ordered the Michigan Army National Guard into Detroit to help end the disturbance. President Lyndon B. Johnson sent in the United States Army&#x27;s 82nd and 101st Airborne divisions. The riot resulted in 43 deaths, 1,189 injured, over 7,200 arrests, and more than 400 buildings destroyed.

The scale of the riot was the worst in the United States since the 1863 New York City draft riots during the American Civil War, and it was not surpassed until the 1992 Los Angeles riots 25 years later.

The riot was prominently featured in the news media, with live television coverage, extensive newspaper reporting, and extensive stories in &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Life&quot; magazines. The staff of the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; won the 1968 Pulitzer Prize for general local reporting for its coverage.

Canadian folk singer Gordon Lightfoot wrote and recorded the song &quot;Black Day in July&quot;, which recounts these events, for his 1968 album &quot;Did She Mention My Name?&quot;. The song was subsequently banned by radio stations in 30 American states. &quot;Black Day in July&quot; was later covered by The Tragically Hip on the 2003 anthology &quot;Beautiful: A Tribute to Gordon Lightfoot&quot;.

== Background ==
=== Racial segregation ===
In the early 20th century, when African Americans migrated to Detroit in the Great Migration, the city experienced a rapidly increasing population and a shortage of housing. African Americans encountered strong discrimination in housing. Both racial covenants and unspoken agreements among whites kept black people out of certain neighborhoods and prevented most African Americans from buying their own homes. The presence of Ku Klux Klan members throughout Michigan furthered racial tensions and violence. Malcolm X&#x27;s father, Earl Little, was killed in a streetcar accident in 1931, although X stated in his autobiography that he believed the Klan&#x27;s Black Legion in East Lansing was involved. In addition, a system of redlining was instituted, which made it nearly impossible for black Detroiters to purchase a home in most areas of the city, effectively locking black residents into lower-quality neighborhoods. These discriminatory practices and the effects of the segregation that resulted from them contributed significantly to the racial tensions in the city before the riot. Segregation also encouraged harsher policing in African American neighborhoods, which escalated black Detroiters&#x27; frustrations leading up to the riot.

Patterns of racial and ethnic segregation persisted through the mid-20th century. In 1956, mayor Orville Hubbard of Dearborn, part of Metro Detroit, boasted to the &quot;Montgomery Advertiser&quot; that &quot;Negroes can&#x27;t get in here...These people are so anti-colored, much more than you in Alabama.&quot;[48]

=== Recent reforms ===
The election of Mayor Jerome Cavanagh in 1961 brought some reform to the police department, led by new Detroit Police Commissioner George Edwards. Detroit had acquired millions in federal funds through President Johnson&#x27;s Great Society programs and invested them almost exclusively in the inner city, where poverty and social problems were concentrated. By the 1960s, many black people had advanced into better union and professional jobs. The city had a prosperous black middle class; higher-than-normal wages for unskilled black workers due to the success of the auto industry; two black Congressmen (half of the black Congressmen at the time); three black judges; two black members on the Detroit Board of Education; a housing commission that was forty percent black; and twelve black representatives representing Detroit in the Michigan legislature.[49] The city had mature black neighborhoods such as Conant Gardens. In May 1967, the federal administration ranked housing for the black community in Detroit above that of Philadelphia, New York City, Chicago, and Cleveland. Nicholas Hood, the sole black member of the nine-member Detroit Common Council, praised the Cavanagh administration for its willingness to listen to concerns of the inner city. Weeks prior to the riot, Mayor Cavanagh had said that residents did not &quot;need to throw a brick to communicate with City Hall.&quot;[50]

There were still signs of black disaffection, however; In 1964, Rosa Parks, who had moved to Detroit in the late fifties, told an interviewer: &quot;I don&#x27;t feel a great deal of difference here [from Alabama]...Housing segregation is just as bad, and it seems more noticeable in the larger cities.&quot;[42] The improvements mostly benefited wealthier black Detroiters, and poor black Detroiters remained frustrated by the social conditions in Detroit. Despite the modest improvements described above, segregation, police brutality and racial tension were rampant in 1960s Detroit and played a large role in inciting the riot.

=== Policing issues ===
The Detroit Police Department was administered directly by the Mayor. Prior to the riot, Mayor Cavanagh&#x27;s appointees, George Edwards and Ray Girardin, worked for reform. Edwards tried to recruit and promote black police officers, but he refused to establish a civilian police review board, as African Americans had requested. In trying to discipline police officers accused of brutality, he turned the police department&#x27;s rank-and-file against him. Many whites perceived his policies as &quot;too soft on crime&quot;. The Community Relations Division of the Michigan Civil Rights Commission undertook a study in 1965 of the police, published in 1968. It claimed the &quot;police system&quot; was at fault for racism. The police system was blamed for recruiting &quot;bigots&quot; and reinforcing bigotry through the department&#x27;s &quot;value system&quot;. A survey conducted by President Johnson&#x27;s Kerner Commission found that prior to the riot, 45 percent of police working in black neighborhoods were &quot;extremely anti-Negro&quot; and an additional 34 percent were &quot;prejudiced&quot;.

In 1967, 93% of the force was still white, although 30% of the city residents were black. Incidents of police brutality caused black residents to feel at risk. They resented many police officers who they felt talked down to them, addressing men as &quot;boys&quot; and women as &quot;honey&quot; and &quot;baby.&quot; Police made street searches of groups of young men, and single women complained of being called prostitutes for simply walking on the street. The police frequently arrested people who did not have proper identification. The local press reported several questionable shootings and beatings of black citizens by officers in the years before 1967. After the riot, a &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; survey showed that residents reported police brutality as the number one problem they faced in the period leading up to the riot.

Black citizens complained that the police did not respond to their calls as quickly as to those of white citizens. They believed that the police profited from vice and other crime in black neighborhoods, and press accusations of corruption and connections to organized crime weakened their trust in the police. According to Sidney Fine, &quot;the biggest complaint about vice in the ghetto was prostitution.&quot; The black community leadership thought the police did not do enough to curb white johns from exploiting local women. In the weeks leading up to the riot, police had started to work to curb prostitution along Twelfth Street. On July 1, a prostitute was killed, and rumors spread that the police had shot her. The police said that she was murdered by local pimps. Detroit police used &quot;Big 4&quot; or &quot;Tac&quot; squads, each made up of four police officers, to patrol Detroit neighborhoods, and such squads were used to combat soliciting.

Black residents felt police raids of after-hours drinking clubs were racially biased actions. Since the 1920s, such clubs had become important parts of Detroit&#x27;s social life for black citizens; although they started with Prohibition, they continued because of discrimination against black people in service at many Detroit bars, restaurants, and entertainment venues.

=== Employment and unemployment ===
In the postwar period, the city had lost nearly 150,000 jobs to the suburbs. Factors were a combination of changes in technology, increased automation, consolidation of the auto industry, taxation policies, the need for different kinds of manufacturing space, and the construction of the highway system that eased transportation. Major companies like Packard, Hudson, and Studebaker, as well as hundreds of smaller companies, went out of business. In the 1950s, the unemployment rate hovered near 10 percent. Between 1946 and 1956, GM spent $3.4 billion on new plants, Ford $2.5 billion, and Chrysler $700 million, opening a total of 25 auto plants, all in Detroit&#x27;s suburbs. As a result, workers who could do so left Detroit for jobs in the suburbs. Other middle-class residents left the city for newer housing, in a pattern repeated nationwide. In the 1960s, the city lost about 10,000 residents per year to the suburbs. Detroit&#x27;s population fell by 179,000 between 1950 and 1960, and by another 156,000 residents by 1970, which affected all its retail businesses and city services.

By the time of the riot, unemployment among black men was more than double that among white men in Detroit. In the 1950s, 15.9 percent of blacks were unemployed, but only 6 percent of whites were unemployed. This was partially due to the union seniority system of the factories. Except for Ford, which hired a significant number of black workers for their factories, the other automakers did not hire black workers until World War II resulted in a labor shortage. With lower seniority, black workers were the first to be laid off in job cutbacks after the war. Moreover, black labor was &quot;ghettoized&quot; into the &quot;most arduous, dangerous and unhealthy jobs.&quot;

When the auto industry boomed again in the early 1960s, only Chrysler and the Cadillac Division of General Motors assembled vehicles in the city of Detroit. The black workers they hired got &quot;the worst and most dangerous jobs: the foundry and the body shop.&quot;

A prosperous, black educated class had developed in traditional professions such as social work, ministry, medicine, and nursing. Many other black citizens working outside manufacturing were relegated to service industries as waiters, porters, or janitors. Many black women were limited to work in domestic service. Certain business sectors were known to discriminate against hiring black workers, even at entry-level positions. It took picketing by Arthur Johnson and the Detroit chapter of the NAACP before First Federal Bank hired their first black tellers and clerks.

=== Housing developments and discrimination ===

Housing in Detroit had been a major problem due to the industrial boom that started in the early 20th century. Several urban renewal projects after World War II, intended to improve housing, dramatically changed neighborhood boundaries and ethnic composition. Affordability for industrial workers and the sheer number of new people in the city resulted in a housing shortage, ultimately fostering the need to establish federal loan systems and invest in public housing, especially for minority populations. Detroit undertook a series of urban renewal projects that disproportionately affected black people, who occupied some of the oldest housing.

Racial discrimination in housing was federally enforced by redlining and restrictive covenants in the mid-20th century. They played an important role in segregating Detroit and escalating racial tensions in the city. The Home Owners&#x27; Loan Corporation was in charge of assigning ratings of &quot;A&quot; (green) through &quot;D&quot; (red) to all of the neighborhoods in major U.S. cities based on the conditions of the buildings, the infrastructure and most importantly, the racial composition of the area. Residents of a neighborhood with a &quot;C&quot; or &quot;D&quot; rating struggled to get loans, and almost all neighborhoods with any African American population were rated &quot;D&quot;, effectively segregating the city by race. This effectively limited options for African Americans to purchase houses outside of these areas, or acquire resources to repair their already damaged homes in these areas. In fact, only 0.8% of all new construction in the city was available to African Americans. Black Bottom and Paradise Valley (located on Detroit&#x27;s lower east side, south of Gratiot) were examples of African-American neighborhoods that formed as a result of these government restrictions.

Examples of city projects for housing include the massive Gratiot Redevelopment Project, planned as early as 1946. It was planned eventually to cover a site on the lower east side that included Hastings Street – the center of Paradise Valley. Other public housing projects also resulted in more tension between white and black people in the city. Although it seemed positive for working-class individuals, the negative effects can still be felt today. Projects like Sojurner Truth were erected in 1941 to account for the unfair bias against African Americans in their housing search. However, it ended up concentrating the African Americans in areas where city whites did not want them, only furthering the racial tension in the city.

The city&#x27;s goals were to &quot;arrest the exodus of business from the central city, to convert slum property to better housing, and to enlarge the city&#x27;s tax base.&quot; Bolstered by successive federal legislation, including the 1941, 1949, 1950, 1954 versions of the &quot;Housing Act&quot; and its amendments through the 1960s, the city acquired funds to develop the Detroit Medical Center complex, Lafayette Park, Central Business District Project One, and the Chrysler Freeway, by appropriating land and &quot;clearing slums&quot;. Money was included for replacement housing in the legislation, but the goal of urban renewal was to physically reshape the city; its social effects on neighborhoods was not well understood. As older neighborhoods were demolished, black people, and people of every color from Detroit&#x27;s skid row, moved to areas north of Black Bottom along Grand Boulevard, but especially to the west side of Woodward, along Grand Boulevard and ultimately the 12th Street neighborhood. As Ze&#x27;ev Chafets wrote in &quot;Devil&#x27;s Night and Other True Tales of Detroit&quot; (1990s), in the 1950s the area around 12th Street rapidly changed from a community of ethnic Jews to a predominantly black community, an example of white flight. Jewish residents had moved to the suburbs for newer housing, but they often retained business or property interests in their old community. Thus, many of the blacks who moved to the 12th Street area rented from absentee landlords and shopped in businesses run by suburbanites. Crime rates rose in the 12th Street area.

By 1967, distinct neighborhood boundaries were known, whether visible (as the case on Eight Mile and Wyoming), or invisible (as the case of Dequindre Road). With white and black people culturally and physically separated, racial tensions were high in the city. As a result, African American neighborhoods were overrun, high in density, and often poor in health quality. For example, the neighborhood around 12th Street had a population density that was twice the city average. After the riot, respondents to a &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; poll listed poor housing as the second most important issue leading up to the riot, behind police brutality.

=== Education ===

Detroit Public Schools suffered from underfunding and racial discrimination before the riots. Underfunding was a function of a decreasing tax base as the population shrank while the numbers of students rose. From 1962 to 1966, enrollment grew from 283,811 to 294,653, but the loss of tax base made less funding available. At the same time, middle-class families were leaving the district, and the numbers of low-scoring and economically disadvantaged students, mostly black, were increasing. In 1966–67, the funding per pupil in Detroit was $193 compared to $225 per pupil in the suburbs. Exacerbating this inequity were the challenges in educating disadvantaged students. The Detroit Board of Education estimated it cost twice as much to educate a &quot;ghetto child properly as to educate a suburban child&quot;. According to Michigan law in 1967, class sizes could not exceed thirty-five students, but in inner-city schools they did, sometimes swelling to forty students per teacher. To have the same teacher/student ratio as the rest of the state, Detroit would have to hire 1,650 more teachers for the 1966–67 school year.

In 1959, the Detroit School Board passed a bylaw banning discrimination in all school operations and activities. From 1962 to 1966, black organizations continued to work to improve the quality of education of black students. Issues included class size, school boundaries, and the ways in which white teachers treated black students. The Citizens Advisory Committee on Equal Educational Opportunities reported a pattern of discrimination in the assignment of teachers and principals in Detroit schools. It also found &quot;grave discrimination&quot; in employment, and in training opportunities in apprenticeship programs. It was dissatisfied with the rate of desegregation in attendance boundaries. The school board accepted the recommendations made by the committee, but faced increasing community pressure. The NAACP demanded affirmative action hiring of school personnel and increased desegregation through an &quot;open schools&quot; policy. Foreshadowing the break between black civil rights groups and black nationalists after the riot, a community group led by Rev. Albert Cleage, Group of Advanced Leadership (GOAL), emphasized changes in textbooks and classroom curriculum as opposed to integration. Cleage wanted black teachers to teach black students in black studies, as opposed to integrated classrooms where all students were held to the same academic standards.

In April and May 1966, a student protest at Detroit Northern High School made headlines throughout the city. Northern was 98% black and had substandard academic testing scores. A student newspaper article, censored by the administration, claimed teachers and the principal &quot;taught down&quot; to blacks and used social promotion to graduate kids without educating them. Students walked out and set up a temporary &quot;Freedom School&quot; in a neighborhood church, which was staffed by many volunteer Wayne State University faculty. By May sympathy strikes were planned at Eastern, and Rev. Albert Cleage had taken up the cause. When the school board voted to remove the principal and vice principal, as well as the single police officer assigned to Northern, whites regarded the board&#x27;s actions as capitulation to &quot;threats&quot; and were outraged the &quot;students were running the school&quot;. City residents voted against a school-tax increase.

Under the Cavanagh administration, the school board created a Community Relations Division at the deputy superintendent level. Arthur L. Johnson, the former head of the Detroit chapter of the NAACP, was hired in 1966 to advance community involvement in schools, and improve &quot;intergroup relations and affirmative action.&quot; Black dominated schools in the city continued to be overcrowded as well as underfunded.

=== Retail stores and services ===
Customer surveys published by the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; indicated that blacks were disproportionately unhappy with the way store owners treated them compared to whites. In stores serving black neighborhoods, owners engaged in &quot;sharp and unethical credit practices&quot; and were &quot;discourteous if not abusive to their customers&quot;. The NAACP, Trade Union Leadership Council (TULC), and Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) all took up this issue with the Cavanagh administration before the riot. In 1968, the Archdiocese of Detroit published one of the largest shopper surveys in American history. It found that the inner-city shopper paid 20% more for food and groceries than the suburbanite. Some of the differences were due to economies of scale in larger suburban stores, as well as ease in transportation and delivery of goods.

Shortly after the Detroit riot, Mayor Jerome Cavanagh lashed out at the &quot;profiteering&quot; of merchants and asked the city council to pass an anti-gouging ordinance.

== Events ==
The crimes reported to police included looting, arson, and sniping, and took place in many different areas of Detroit: on the west side of Woodward Avenue, extending from the 12th Street neighborhood to Grand River Avenue and as far south as Michigan Avenue and Trumbull, near Tiger Stadium. East of Woodward, the area around East Grand Boulevard, which goes east/west then north–south to Belle Isle, was involved. However, the entire city was affected between Sunday, July 23, and Thursday, July 27.

=== July 23 ===
==== Arrest of party guests ====
In the early hours of Sunday (3:45 a.m.), July 23, 1967, Detroit Police Department (DPD) officers raided an unlicensed weekend drinking club (known locally as a blind pig) in the office of the United Community League for Civic Action, above the Economy Printing Company, at 9125 12th Street. They expected a few revelers inside, but instead found a party of 82 people celebrating the return of two local GIs from the Vietnam War. The police decided to arrest everyone present. While they were arranging for transportation, a sizable crowd of onlookers gathered on the street, having witnessed the raid. Later, in a memoir, William Walter Scott III, a doorman whose father was running the raided blind pig, took responsibility for starting the riot by inciting the crowd and throwing a bottle at a police officer.

==== Beginning of looting ====
After the DPD left, the crowd began looting an adjacent clothing store. Shortly thereafter, full-scale looting began throughout the neighborhood. The Michigan State Police, Wayne County Sheriff&#x27;s Department, and the Michigan Army National Guard were alerted, but because it was Sunday, it took hours for Police Commissioner Ray Girardin to assemble sufficient manpower. Meanwhile, witnesses described seeing a &quot;carnival atmosphere&quot; on 12th Street. The DPD, inadequate in number and wrongly believing that the rioting would soon expire, just stood there and watched. Police did not make their first arrest until 7 a.m., three hours after the raid on the blind pig. To the east, on Chene Street, reports said the crowd was of mixed composition. The pastor of Grace Episcopal Church along 12th Street reported that he saw a &quot;gleefulness in throwing stuff and getting stuff out of buildings&quot;. The police conducted several sweeps along 12th Street, which proved ineffective because of the unexpectedly large numbers of people outside. The first major fire broke mid-afternoon in a grocery store at the corner of 12th Street and Atkinson. The crowd prevented firefighters from extinguishing it, and soon more smoke filled the skyline.

==== Local responses ====
The local news media initially avoided reporting on the disturbance so as not to inspire copy-cat violence, but the rioting started to expand to other parts of the city, including looting of retail and grocery stores elsewhere. By Sunday afternoon, news had spread, and people attending events such as a Fox Theater Motown revue and Detroit Tigers baseball game were warned to avoid certain areas of the city. Motown&#x27;s Martha Reeves was on stage at the Fox, singing &quot;Jimmy Mack,&quot; and was asked to tell people to leave quietly, as there was trouble outside. After the game, Tigers left fielder Willie Horton, a Detroit resident who had grown up not far from 12th Street, drove to the riot area and stood on a car in the middle of the crowd while still in his baseball uniform. Despite Horton&#x27;s impassioned pleas, he could not calm the crowd.

Mayor Jerome Cavanagh stated that the situation was &quot;critical&quot; but not yet &quot;out of control.&quot; At 7:45 p.m. that first (Sunday) night, Cavanagh enacted a citywide 9:00 p.m. – 5:30 a.m. curfew, prohibited sales of alcohol and firearms, and informally curtailed business activity in recognition of the serious civil unrest engulfing sections of the city. A number of adjoining communities also enacted curfews. There was significant white participation in the rioting and looting, raising questions as to whether the event fits into the classical race riot category.

=== July 24 ===
==== Police crackdowns ====
Michigan State Police and the Wayne County Sheriff&#x27;s Department were called in to Detroit to assist an overwhelmed Detroit police force. As the violence spread, the police began to make numerous arrests to clear rioters off the streets, housing the detainees in makeshift jails. Beginning Monday, people were detained without being brought to Recorder&#x27;s Court for arraignment. Some gave false names, making the process of identifying those arrested difficult because of the need to take and check fingerprints. Windsor Police were asked to help check fingerprints.

Police began to take pictures of looters arrested, the arresting officer, and the stolen goods, to speed up the process and postpone the paperwork. More than eighty percent of those arrested were black. About twelve percent were women. Michigan National Guardsmen were not authorized to arrest people, so state troopers and police officers made all arrests without discriminating between civilians and criminals.

==== Partisan political responses ====
Michigan Governor George Romney and President Lyndon B. Johnson initially disagreed about the legality of sending in federal troops. Johnson said he could not send federal troops in without Romney&#x27;s declaring a &quot;state of insurrection&quot;, to meet compliance with the Insurrection Act.

As the historian Sidney Fine details in &quot;Violence in the Model City&quot;, partisan political issues complicated decisions, as is common in crisis. George Romney was expected to run for the Republican presidential nomination in 1968, and President Johnson, a Democrat, did not want to commit troops solely on Romney&#x27;s direction. Added to this was Mayor Jerome Cavanagh&#x27;s own political and personal clash with Romney. Cavanagh, a young Irish Catholic Democrat who had cultivated harmonious relations with black leaders, both inside and outside the city, was initially reluctant to ask Romney, a Republican, for assistance.

==== Chaos ====

The violence escalated throughout Monday, resulting in some 483 fires, 231 incidents reported per hour, and 1,800 arrests. Looting and arson were widespread. Black-owned businesses were not spared. One of the first stores looted in Detroit was Hardy&#x27;s drug store, owned by black people and known for filling prescriptions on credit. Detroit&#x27;s leading black-owned women&#x27;s clothing store was burned, as was one of the city&#x27;s best-loved black restaurants. In the wake of the riots, a black merchant said, &quot;you were going to get looted no matter what color you were.&quot; Firefighters of the Detroit Fire Department who were attempting to fight the fires were shot at by rioters. During the riots, 2,498 rifles and 38 handguns were stolen from local stores. It was obvious that the City of Detroit, Wayne County, and State of Michigan forces were unable to restore order.

==== John Conyers speech ====
On Monday, U.S. Representative John Conyers (D-Michigan), who was against federal troop deployment, attempted to ease tensions by driving along 12th Street with a loudspeaker asking people to return to their homes. Reportedly, Conyers stood on the hood of the car and shouted through a bullhorn, &quot;We&#x27;re with you! But, please! This is not the way to do things! Please go back to your homes!&quot; But the crowd refused to listen. Conyers&#x27; car was pelted with rocks and bottles.

=== July 25 ===

==== Military occupation ====
Shortly before midnight on Monday, July 24, President Johnson authorized the use of federal troops in compliance with the Insurrection Act of 1807, which authorizes the President to call in armed forces to fight an insurrection in any state against the government. This gave Detroit the distinction of being the only domestic American city to have been occupied by federal troops three times. The United States Army&#x27;s 82nd Airborne Division and 101st Airborne Division had earlier been positioned at nearby Selfridge Air Force Base in suburban Macomb County. Starting at 1:30a.m. on Tuesday, July 25, some 8,000 Michigan Army National Guardsmen were deployed to quell the disorder. Later, their number would be augmented with 4,700 paratroopers from both the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions, and 360 Michigan State Police officers.

Chaos continued; the police were overworked and tired. Detroit Police were found to have committed many acts of abuse against both blacks and whites who were in their custody.

Although only 26 of the over 7,000 arrests involved snipers, and not one person accused of sniping was successfully prosecuted, the fear of snipers precipitated many police searches. The &quot;searching for weapons&quot; caused many homes and vehicles to be scrutinized. Curfew violations were also common sparks to police brutality. The Detroit Police&#x27;s 10th Precinct routinely abused prisoners; as mug shots later proved, many injuries came after booking. Women were stripped and fondled while officers took pictures. White landlords from New York City visiting their building were arrested after a sniper call and beaten so horribly that &quot;their testicles were still black and blue two weeks after the incident.&quot;

==== Death of Tanya Blanding ====
A four-year-old girl named Tanya Blanding was shot and killed during the riot while she huddled in the living room of her second-floor apartment, a few steps from the intersection of 12th and Euclid, in the heart of the original riot area (precinct 10).

Sporadic sniper fire had been reported in the immediate area earlier in the evening and on the previous night. Guardsmen reported one of their units under fire at the intersection and believed they had pinpointed it as coming from the apartment in which Tanya and her family lived.

As a tank of the National Guard was being moved into position directly in front of the building, one of the occupants of the Blanding apartment was said to light a cigarette. Guardsmen opened fire on the apartment with rifles and the tank&#x27;s .50 caliber machine gun. At 1:20 a.m. Tanya Blanding was dead.

Sergeant Mortimer J. LeBlanc, 41, admitted firing the burst into the windows of the apartment where Tanya was found, after another Guardsman told him that sniper fire had come from there. Tanya&#x27;s mother, June, filed a lawsuit for $100,000 in damages, on the grounds that Sgt. LeBlanc fired negligently into the apartment. He was exonerated.

=== July 26 ===

==== Quelling unrest ====
Some analysts believed that violence escalated with the deployment of troops, although they brought rioting under control within 48 hours. Nearly all of the Michigan Army National Guard were exclusively white, inexperienced militarily, and did not have urban backgrounds, while the Army paratroopers were racially integrated and had seen service in Vietnam. As a result, the Army paratroopers were at ease and able to communicate easily in the city while the National Guardsmen were not as effective. The National Guardsmen engaged in what they said were firefights with locals, resulting in the death of one Guardsman. Of the 12 people that troops shot and killed, only one was shot by a federal soldier. Army paratroopers were ordered not to load their weapons except under the direct order of an officer. The Cyrus Vance report made afterward criticized the actions of the National Guardsmen, who shot and killed nine civilians.

Tanks and machine guns were used in the effort to keep the peace. Film footage and photos that were viewed internationally showed a city on fire, with tanks and combat troops in firefights in the streets.

==== Michigan Civil Rights Commission ====
The Michigan Civil Rights Commission intervened in the riot to try to protect the rights of arrestees. The arrival of the CRC was &quot;not well received&quot; by the police, who said the observers were interfering with police work. The Detroit Police Officers Association protested to Romney, &quot;We resent the Civil Rights Commission looking over our shoulders, just waiting for some officer to stub his toe.&quot; At one precinct, a white officer &quot;bitterly abused&quot; a black CRC observer, saying that &quot;all people of his kind should be killed.&quot;

==== Interracial relief organizations ====
United Press International (UPI) said that &quot;the riots brought out the best, as well as the worst, in people.&quot;

As Louis Cassells reported on the ground for UPI:

&quot;At a moment when race relations might seem to have sunk to the lowest possible level, whites and Negroes were working together, through their churches, to minister to the hungry and homeless. The effort transcended denominational lines. By Wednesday [July 26, 1967], Protestants, Catholics and Jews had established an interfaith emergency center to coordinate the relief work. District collection centers were set up at scores of churches and synagogues across the city. The food, clothing, bedding and cash contributed through them brought to the interfaith center, from which aid was distributed strictly according to need, without regard for race, creed, or color.&quot;

&quot;Acts of kindness and generosity were not confined to religious groups. Unions, led by the United Auto Workers and the Teamsters, joined with industrial firms in setting up a truck pool to transport relief supplies into the riot area. It was not just a matter of white people being kind to black people. Often it was the other way around, I saw Negro families bringing cool drinks of water to white National Guardsmen standing post in blazing sun. On several occasions, white reporterstrapped on the streets during wild gun battles between Guardsmen and sniperswere taken into the relative safety of nearby Negro homes, even though opening the door to admit them was a real risk to the Negro family. People can be pretty wonderfuleven in a riot.&quot;

=== July 27–28 ===
By Thursday, July 27, sufficient order had returned to the city that officers withdrew ammunition from the National Guardsmen stationed in the riot area and ordered them to sheath their bayonets. Troop withdrawal began on Friday, July 28, the day of the last major fire in the riot. The Army troops were completely withdrawn by Saturday, July 29. 

== Reactions ==
=== Nationwide violence ===
The Detroit riot was a catalyst to unrest elsewhere as the riot spread from the city into adjoining suburbs and to other areas of Michigan. Minimal rioting was reported in Highland Park and River Rouge, a heavier police presence was required after a bomb threat was phoned in to an E.J. Korvette store in Southgate and very minimal violence was reported in Hamtramck. The state deployed National Guardsmen or state police to other Michigan cities as simultaneous riots erupted in Pontiac, Flint, Saginaw, and Grand Rapids, as well as in Toledo and Lima, Ohio; New York City and Rochester, New York; Cambridge, Maryland; Englewood, New Jersey; Houston, Texas; and Tucson, Arizona. Disturbances were reported in more than two dozen cities.

=== Local perceptions ===
Blacks and whites in Detroit viewed the events of July 1967 in very different ways. Part of the process of comprehending the damage was to survey the attitudes and beliefs of people in Detroit. Sidney Fine&#x27;s chapter, &quot;The Polarized Community,&quot; cites many of the academic and &quot;Detroit Free Press-&quot;financed public opinion surveys conducted in the wake of the riot. Although Black Nationalism was thought to have been given a boost by the civil strife, as membership in Albert Cleage&#x27;s church grew substantially and the New Detroit committee sought to include black leadership like Norvell Harrington and Frank Ditto, it was whites who were much more likely to support separation.

One percent of Detroit blacks favored &quot;total separation&quot; between the races in 1968, whereas 17 percent of Detroit whites did. African-Americans supported &quot;integration&quot; by 88 percent, while only 24 percent of whites supported integration. Residents of the 12th Street area differed significantly from blacks in the rest of the city however. For example, 22 percent of 12th Street blacks thought they should &quot;get along without whites entirely&quot;. Nevertheless, the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; survey of black Detroiters in 1968 showed that the highest approval rating for people was given to conventional politicians like Charles Diggs (27 percent) and John Conyers (22 percent) compared to Albert Cleage (4 percent).

== Damages ==
In Detroit, an estimated 10,000 people participated in the riots, with an estimated 100,000 gathering to watch. Thirty-six hours later, 43 were dead, 33 of whom were black and 10 white. More than 7,200 people were arrested, most of them black. Mayor Jerome Cavanagh lamented upon surveying the damage, &quot;Today we stand amidst the ashes of our hopes. We hoped against hope that what we had been doing was enough to prevent a riot. It was not enough.&quot;

The scale of the riot was the worst in the United States since the 1863 New York City draft riots during the American Civil War, and was not surpassed until the 1992 Los Angeles riots 25 years later.

=== Injuries ===
1,189 people were injured: 407 civilians, 289 suspects, 214 Detroit police officers, 134 Detroit firefighters, 55 Michigan National Guardsmen, 67 Michigan State Police officers, 15 Wayne County Sheriff deputies, and 8 federal soldiers.

=== Arrests ===
7,231 people were arrested: 6,528 adults and 703 juveniles; the youngest was 4 and the oldest was 82. Many of those arrested had no criminal record: 251 whites and 678 black. Of those arrested, 64% were accused of looting and 14% were charged with curfew violations.

=== Economic damage ===
2,509 businesses reported looting or damage, 388 families were rendered homeless or displaced, and 412 buildings were burned or damaged enough to be demolished. Dollar losses from property damage ranged from $40 million to $45 million.

==== Joe&#x27;s Record Shop ====
Joe&#x27;s Record Shop on 8434 12th Street, owned by Joe Von Battle, was one of the businesses that was destroyed in the 1967 Detroit Riot. The business was founded in 1945, on 3530 Hastings Street, where Battle sold records and recorded music with artists like John Lee Hooker, The Reverend C.L. Franklin and Aretha Franklin. He operated from the Hastings store until 1960 when the street was razed in order to build the Chrysler Freeway. Battle along with other business owners on Hastings St. moved to 12th Street, where his shop operated until the events of July 23, 1967. During the &#x27;67 riots, Battle stood guard in front of his shop with his gun and his &quot;Soul Brother&quot; sign. After the first day of rioting, police authorities no longer permitted business owners to guard their shops. Days later, Battle returned to his record shop with his daughter Marsha Battle Philpot and they were met with &quot;wet, fetid debris of what had been one of the most seminal record shops in Detroit.&quot; Joe&#x27;s Record Shop and much of the stock withinincluding tapes and recordings of musicianswere ruined. Ultimately, Battle&#x27;s store was unable to reopen due to the damage caused by the 1967 riot.

=== Deaths ===
A total of 43 people died: 33 were black and 10 were white. Among the black deaths, 14 were shot by police officers; 9 were shot by National Guardsmen; 6 were shot by store owners or security guards; 2 were killed by asphyxiation from a building fire; 1 was killed after stepping on a downed power line; and 1 was shot by a federal soldier. The National Guardsmen and Detroit Police were found to have engaged in &quot;uncontrolled and unnecessary firing&quot; that endangered civilians and increased police chaos. It has been suggested that the presence of snipers was imagined or exaggerated by officials, and some of the military and law enforcement casualties could have instead been friendly fire.

One black civilian, Albert Robinson, was killed by a National Guardsman responding with Detroit Police to an apartment building on the city&#x27;s west side. Ernest Roquemore, a black teenager who was the last to die in the civil unrest, was killed by Army paratroopers on July 29 when caught in their crossfire directed toward someone else. The police shot three other individuals during the same firefight, with one victim needing his leg amputated. Jack Sydnor was a black sniper who fired upon police and wounded one police officer in the street. The police came close to the building where the sniper lived and ambushed in the 3rd story building room by shooting him, making Sydnor the only sniper killed during the riot.

Among the whites who died were 5 civilians, 2 firefighters, 1 looter, 1 police officer, and 1 Guardsman. Of the white sworn personnel killed, 2 firefighters died, with 1 stepping on a downed power line during attempts to extinguish a fire started by looters, while the other was shot while organizing fire units at Mack and St. Jean streets; 1 officer was shot by a looter while struggling with a group of looters; and 1 Guardsman was shot by fellow Guardsmen while being caught in the crossfire by fellow National Guardsmen firing on a vehicle which failed to stop at the roadblock. Of the white civilians killed, 2 were shot by National Guardsmen, of whom 1 was staying at her hotel room and was mistaken for a sniper; 1 was shot as she and her husband tried to drive away from a group of black rioters beating a white civilian; 1 was shot by police while working as a security guard trying to protect a store from looters; and 1 was beaten to death by a black rioter after confronting looters in his store. Only 1 white looter was killed by police while trying to steal a car part at a junkyard on the outskirts of the city.

=== List of deaths ===

== Effects ==
=== Local political strife ===
One of the criticisms of the New Detroit committee, an organization founded by Henry Ford II, J.L. Hudson, and Max Fisher while the embers were still cooling, was that it gave credibility to radical black organizations in a misguided attempt to listen to the concerns of the &quot;inner-city Negro&quot; and &quot;the rioters.&quot; Moderate black leaders such as Arthur L. Johnson were weakened and intimidated by the new credibility the rebellion gave to black radicals, some of whom favored &quot;a black republic carved out of five southern states&quot; and supported &quot;breaking into gun shops to seize weapons.&quot;

The Kerner Commission deputy director of field operations in Detroit reported that the most militant organizers in the 12th Street area did not consider it immoral to kill whites.

Adding to the criticism of the New Detroit committee in both the moderate black and white communities was the belief that the wealthy, white industrial leadership were giving voice and money to radical black groups as a sort of &quot;riot insurance.&quot; The fear that &quot;the next riot&quot; would not be localized to inner city black neighborhoods but would include the white suburbs was common in the black middle class and white communities. White groups like &quot;Breakthrough&quot; started by city employee Donald Lobsinger, a Parks and Recreation Department employee, wanted to arm whites and keep them in the city because if Detroit &quot;became black&quot; there would be &quot;guerrilla warfare in the suburbs&quot;.

=== Racial and economic shifts ===

Detroit Councilman Mel Ravitz said the riot divided not only the races – since it &quot;deepened the fears of many whites and raised the militancy of many blacks&quot; – but it opened up wide cleavages within black and white communities as well. Moderate liberals of each race were faced with new political groups that voiced extremist solutions and fueled fears about future violence. Compared to the rosy newspaper stories before July 1967, the &quot;London Free Press&quot; reported in 1968 that Detroit was a &quot;sick city where fear, rumor, race prejudice and gun-buying have stretched black and white nerves to the verge of snapping.&quot; Sidney Fine wrote that if the riot is interpreted as a protest, or a way for black grievances to be heard and addressed, it was partly successful.

The riot markedly increased the pace of Detroit&#x27;s white residents moving out of the city. From 1967 to 1969, 173,000 white residents left, and from 1967 to 1978, Detroit public schools lost 74% of its white students.

The black community in Detroit received much more attention from federal and state governments after 1967, and although the New Detroit committee ultimately shed its black membership and transformed into the mainstream Detroit Renaissance group, money did flow into black-owned enterprises after the riot. However, the most significant black politician to take power in the shift from a white majority city to a black majority city, Coleman Young, Detroit&#x27;s first black mayor, wrote in 1994:

In 2010, Thomas Sowell, a conservative and senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, wrote in an opinion article for a website created by The Heritage Foundation:

=== Riot control strategies ===
Nationally, the riot confirmed for the military and the Johnson administration that military occupation of American cities would be necessary. In particular, the riot confirmed the role of the Army Operations Center as the agent to anticipate and combat domestic guerrilla warfare.

=== Minority hiring ===
State and local governments responded to the riot with a dramatic increase in minority hiring. On August 18, 1967, the State Police department swore in the first black trooper in the fifty-year history of the organization. In May 1968, Detroit Mayor Cavanaugh appointed a Special Task Force on Police Recruitment and Hiring. Thirty-five percent of the police hired by Detroit in 1968 were black, and by July 1972, blacks made up 14 percent of the Detroit police, more than double their percentage in 1967. The Michigan government used its reviews of contracts issued by the state to secure an increase in nonwhite employment. Minority group employment by the contracted companies increased by 21.1 percent.

In the aftermath of the turmoil, the Greater Detroit Board of Commerce launched a campaign to find jobs for ten thousand &quot;previously unemployable&quot; persons, a preponderant number of whom were black. By October 12, 1967, Detroit firms had reportedly hired about five thousand African-Americans since the beginning of the jobs campaign; according to Professor Sidney Fine, &quot;that figure may be an underestimate.&quot; In a &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; survey of residents of the riot areas in the late summer of 1968, 39 percent of the respondents thought that employers had become &quot;more fair&quot; since the riot as compared to 14 percent who thought they had become &quot;less fair.&quot;

After the riot, in one of the biggest changes, automakers and retailers lowered the entry-level job requirements. A Michigan Bell employment supervisor commented in 1968 that &quot;for years businesses tried to screen people out. Now we are trying to find reasons to screen them in.&quot;

=== Housing laws ===
Prior to the disorder, Detroit enacted no ordinances to end housing segregation, and few had been enacted in the state of Michigan at all. Some liberal politicians had worked for fair housing over the years, but white conservative resistance to it was organized and powerful. The reactionary movement began to wither after the insurrection. Sidney Fine noted that:

Governor Romney immediately responded to the turmoil with a special session of the Michigan legislature, where he forwarded sweeping housing proposals that included not only fair housing, but &quot;important relocation, tenants&#x27; rights and code enforcement legislation.&quot; Romney had supported such proposals before in 1964 and 1965, but abandoned them in the face of organized opposition. In the aftermath of the insurrection, the proposals again faced resistance from organized white homeowners and the governor&#x27;s own Republican party, which once again voted down the legislation in the House. This time, however, Romney did not relent and once again proposed the housing laws at the regular 1968 session of the legislature.

The governor publicly warned that if the housing measures were not passed, &quot;it will accelerate the recruitment of revolutionary insurrectionists.&quot; He urged &quot;meaningful fair housing legislation&quot; as &quot;the single most important step the legislature can take to avert disorder in our cities.&quot; This time the laws passed both houses of the legislature. The &quot;Michigan Historical Review&quot; wrote that:

=== Stop the Robberies, Enjoy Safe Streets (STRESS) ===

Two years after the end of the 1967 riot, Wayne County Sheriff Roman Gribbs, who was seen by many white Detroiters as their last &quot;white hope&quot; in a city with a growing black population, created the Stop the Robberies, Enjoy Safe Streets (STRESS) campaign, a secret and elite police unit that enabled police brutality.

STRESS used a tactic called &quot;decoy operation&quot;, in which police officers tried to entrap potential criminals in an undercover sting. From its inception, STRESS all but ignored white criminals, instead focusing their operations on black communities, and increased confrontations between the black community and police. During its first year of operation, the Detroit Police Department had the &quot;highest number of civilian killings per capita of any American police department.&quot; The unit was accused of conducting 500 raids without the use of search warrants and killing 20 people within 30 months, and this fostered an unhealthy fear and hatred between the black community and the police force.

Community groups did not take long to start responding to STRESS&#x27;s activities. On September 23, 1971, the State of Emergency Committee was formed to protest the killings, and thousands of people marched to demand the abolition of STRESS.

Following Senator Richard Austin, the first black person in various political and professional positions, came Senator Coleman Young. In contrast to Senator Austin&#x27;s quiet and accommodating political style, Young developed a liberal, combative political style in the labor and black radical movements of the late 1930s. Young helped organize the National Negro Labor Council (NNLC) and became its executive director. Finding himself in a position of national power, he said to his committee: &quot;I am a part of the Negro people. I am now in process of fighting against what I consider to be attacks and discrimination against my people. I am fighting against un-American activities such as lynching and denial of the vote. I am dedicated to that fight and I don&#x27;t think I have to apologize or explain it to anybody&quot; (Foner, 1981; Young and Wheeler, 1995: 128). This statement really reflected the views of the black people in Detroit at this time. With his position and emerging national attention, the black community began rallying behind Young for mayor in place of Roman Gribbs. Young began building part of his campaign upon what he believed to be one of the major problems for a city divided by race: STRESS. Young said, &quot;one of the problems is that the police run the city... STRESS is responsible for the explosive polarization that now exists; STRESS is an execution squad rather than an enforcement squad. As mayor, I will get rid of STRESS&quot; (Detroit Free Press, May 11, 1973). He added, &quot;the whole attitude of the whole Police Department, historically, has been one of intimidation and that citizen can be kept in line with clubs and guns rather than respect.&quot; When Young was elected into office, he represented the fear and loathing of STRESS in the city that would have to be terminated.

STRESS inadvertently promoted black political power, and the abolishment of the STRESS unit initiated the beginning of bringing black people into the police department.

This matters in a larger context than simply the immediate implications of STRESS. This unit instigated the mayoral campaign and eventual candidacy of Mayor Coleman Young, who would go on to spend the next 20 years fighting for black rights and reframing the relationship between the police force and the black community. While the STRESS campaign was important on its own in terms of the individuals killed or families of these individuals, it became radically important for the cultural shift that Mayor Coleman Young would facilitate.

The global context of this campaign changed the trajectory of black political and professional power and opportunity.

=== Other political impacts ===
In the wake of the riots, a group of several hundred African American activists met in Detroit, where they declared the Republic of New Africa and a provisional government for it. It was the first separate nation declared by African Americans in the United States.

=== African-American social advances ===
In light of the event, faults in the existing system became apparent and measures were taken to solve the problems. In 1970, First Independence National Bank (now First Independence Bank) gave African Americans capital which was generally inaccessible due to redlining; this provided social mobility and better living conditions.

Others worked with the government to understand the problem, and this research provided the basis for solutions. Wayne State University partnered with the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare to create the Developmental Career Guidance Project, which studied improving the potential for poor students. Its report helped form the backbone of a number of educational programs. Other efforts to heal came from organizations like the Interfaith Action Council, which sought to bring people of different races and religions together to encourage dialogue about racial inequality.

The 1967 riot inspired active measures to overturn stereotypes and solve day-to-day problems, with African Americans resisting inequality in their lives. William Cunningham and Eleanor Josaitis founded HOPE, an organization which targeted hunger and workplace inequality, in 1968. HOPE evolved to provide skills training for young people. General Baker and Ron March led the Dodge Revolutionary Union Movement, seeking a voice in the workplace; Alvin Bush and Irma Craft guided the Career Development Center to provide basic skills training and job placement; and the Volunteer Placement Corps assisted African Americans to obtain a college education.

The most influential change came from African Americans in powerful positions. The riot contributed to African Americans becoming the majority in Detroit, and gave them political power. For the first time in the city&#x27;s history, African Americans could affect municipal policy. Political figures such as Mayor Coleman Young enacted policies which attempted to integrate the city. Young began with changes to the police and fire departments, implementing a two-list system which gave African Americans an equal chance of promotion; his goal was to balance the departments&#x27; racial and gender makeup. Young sought the backing of President Jimmy Carter, allowing money to flow into Detroit for improvements in education and housing. In 1972 the Detroit Common Council elected its first African American president, Erma Henderson, who fought insurance redlining and discrimination in the judicial system and public spaces.

=== Public opinion ===
A poll conducted by EPIC-MRA, a survey research firm, in July 2016 focused on the evolution of black–white relations since the riots. The poll surveyed 600 residents of Macomb, Oakland, and Wayne counties. The poll took place from July 14–19, a time period the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; noted was &quot;during the ongoing national furor over police shooting of African-American civilians, and retaliatory attacks on officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge.&quot;

The respondents of the Detroit poll were more optimistic about race relations compared to the national averages. A national Washington Post/ABC News poll found that only 32% of the people they polled believed race relations were good, as opposed to the 56% and 47% of the white and black Detroiters surveyed, respectively. This was unsurprising to Reynold Farley, a retired University of Michigan sociology professor and expert on Detroit racial demographics. &quot;I think it&#x27;s easier for people in the Detroit area to have some familiarity with race relations than people in a state like Maine, where there&#x27;s virtually no black population at all and the information comes from seeing violent incidents on television&quot;, he explained. In the following question, Farley&#x27;s claim was validated as the stark contrast in national vs. Detroiter perception of what the future would be like was apparent. As just 10% of those polled by the Washington Post/ABC News believed that race relations we getting better, whereas 33% of white and 22% of black Detroiters thought they had improved over the past 10 years and 50% of white and 41% of blacks believed they would improve over the next five.

Although these responses were encouraging signs of a diminishing racial gap in Detroit, and a heightened attunement to race relations in the city compared to the rest of the nation, other questions concerning Detroiters&#x27; perception of the riots and how the improvement of race relations are actualized in their everyday life show there is still much mending to be done. When asked which word they would use to describe the 1967 riots – riot, rebellion or uprising – the white response was 61%, 12%, 12% and blacks, 34%, 27%, 24%, respectively. The majority of respondents did agree, however, that since the riots they believed there had been significant progress made vs little or no progress Unfortunately, many black Detroiters still feel as if they are facing the type of discrimination that led to the riots in the first place. The polled black Detroiters reporting that in the past 12 months 28% felt they had been unfairly treated in hiring, pay, or promotion, double the rate of their white counterparts. 73% also believed that they were treated less fairly than whites when attempting to find a &quot;good job&quot;.

== In popular culture ==

Several songs directly refer to the riot. The most prominent was &quot;Black Day in July&quot;, written and sung by Canadian singer-songwriter Gordon Lightfoot for his 1968 album &quot;Did She Mention My Name?&quot;. Others include the 1967 song &quot;The Motor City Is Burning&quot; by John Lee Hooker, which was also recorded by the MC5 on their 1969 album &quot;Kick Out the Jams&quot;; &quot;Panic in Detroit&quot;, from David Bowie&#x27;s 1973 album &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot;; The Temptations&#x27; 1970 single &quot;Ball of Confusion (That&#x27;s What The World Is Today)&quot;; The Spinners&#x27; 1973 single &quot;Ghetto Child&quot;; Marvin Gaye&#x27;s &quot;What&#x27;s Happening Brother&quot; from his 1971 album &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot;; the title track from Detroit producer and DJ Moodymann&#x27;s 2008 EP &quot;Det.riot &#x27;67&quot;, which sampled audio recordings from news reels talking about the riot; and &quot;Detroit &#x27;67&quot; by Canadian singer-songwriter Sam Roberts from his 2008 album &quot;Love at the End of the World&quot;.

An episode of &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot;, &quot;Let That Be Your Last Battlefield&quot;, used footage of burning buildings from the 1967 Detroit Riot to dramatize a planetary war between two alien races. One was colored black on the left side white on the right, and the other the opposite. The two alien races were represented by guest stars Frank Gorshin and Lou Antonio.

Judy Blume&#x27;s 1970 novel &quot;Iggie&#x27;s House&quot;, which dealt with issues of racial hatred arising from a black family&#x27;s moving into a predominantly white neighborhood, also referenced the riot. The book&#x27;s protagonist, Winnie, unintentionally gets off to a bad start with her new neighbors, the Garbers (who have just moved from Detroit), by asking the family&#x27;s three children if they participated in any of the looting.

The riots were also depicted in the films &quot;Dreamgirls&quot;, &quot;Across the Universe&quot; and &quot;Detroit&quot;.

The December 7, 2010, episode of &quot;Detroit 1-8-7&quot; on ABC aired archive footage and photos of Detroit during the 1967 riots. The episode&#x27;s primary storyline depicted a 2010 discovery of a black male body and a white female body in a fallout shelter constructed under a building that burned down during the riots. In reality, there were two people, listed above, who lost their lives in a basement of a building that was burned down.

Jeffrey Eugenides&#x27; 2002 novel &quot;Middlesex&quot; has a detailed retelling of, and makes some social commentary on, the riot. Joyce Carol Oates&#x27;s 1969 novel &quot;them&quot; climaxes with the riot. John Hersey&#x27;s 1968 nonfiction book &quot;The Algiers Motel Incident&quot; is a true crime account of an incident that occurred during the riots, and the 2017 film &quot;Detroit&quot;, written by Mark Boal and directed by Kathryn Bigelow, was a dramatization based on that incident. Survivors of the incident participated in the production of the film.

== Art influenced by the riots ==
=== Fine art ===
Many artworks were created in response to the 1967 events, a number of which were included in the 2017 exhibition &quot;Art of Rebellion: Black Art of the Civil Rights Movement&quot;, curated by Valerie J. Mercer for the Detroit Institute of Arts. &quot;Black Attack (1967)&quot; was painted by Detroit abstract artist Allie McGhee immediately following the event. The work includes &quot;broad strokes of color that appear spontaneous, give form to the artists memories of strength and resolve of black people facing intense opposition to change.&quot;

In 2017, Detroit based artist Rita Dickerson created &quot;1967: Death in the Algiers Motel and Beyond.&quot; In the work Dickerson &quot;depicts the Algiers Motel and portraits of three young Black men killed there by police. Below the portraits are the names of men and women who have died in recent years in encounters with police, underscoring the fact that police brutality continues to cost black people their lives.&quot;

=== Literary art ===
Bill Harris, a Detroit-based poet, playwright, and educator, wrote about the condition of the Detroit black community – referred to by him as the DBC – after July 1967 in &quot;Detroit: a young guide to the city&quot;. The book was edited by Sheldon Annis and published by Speedball Publications in 1970.

=== Performing arts ===
Two plays based on firsthand accounts were performed in 2017. &quot;Detroit &#x27;67&quot; presented recollections from five metro Detroiters at the Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History by the Secret Society of Twisted Storytellers. &quot;AFTER/LIFE&quot;, performed at the Joseph Walker Williams Recreation Center, presented the events from the perspectives of women and girls.

<text>The Albany Attack was the name of a franchise which played in the National Lacrosse League (NLL) from the 2000 season through the 2003 season. The Attack played in the former Pepsi Arena in Albany, New York (now known as the Times Union Center). After the 2003 season, the franchise was sold and moved to San Jose, California and renamed the San Jose Stealth. The current incarnation of the franchise, now owned by Canucks Sports &amp; Entertainment, is the Vancouver Warriors.

The 2002 (called then the 2001–2002) Albany Attack team was the most successful Attack team during the franchise&#x27;s four years in Albany, New York. It is the only Attack team to have made the NLL playoffs. (Note: The San Jose Stealth made the NLL playoffs in their inaugural season, 2004, as well as the 2007 and 2008 seasons.) The team went 14–2 in the regular season winning the Central Division championship, and went 15–3 overall having lost to the Toronto Rock in the 2002 NLL Champion&#x27;s Cup Game in Albany.

* Before the season began, head coach Terry Sanderson left the Albany Attack to become the head coach of the expansion Montréal Express. He was replaced by Bob McMahon.
* The 2002 season began in Albany on November 16, 2001. On that date, the Albany Attack defeated the expansion New Jersey Storm, who were playing their first game. Storm owner and former NBA star Jayson Williams was in attendance.
*With a regular season record of 14–2, and overall record of 15–3, the Albany Attack established new NLL records for most regular season wins and most overall wins.
*The Attack finished first in the Central Division, one game ahead of the Rochester Knighthawks who had finished with a regular season record of 13–3, the second best in the NLL that season. Ironically, those two Attack regular season losses were both to Rochester; one game in Albany and another in Rochester.
*In the playoffs, the Albany Attack (the #1 seed) had a bye during the first round. They then hosted and defeated the Rochester Knighthawks (the #4 seed), 14–10, in a semifinal game with an attendance of 5074. On Saturday April 13, 2002, the Albany Attack hosted the #2 seed Toronto Rock for the Champion&#x27;s Cup, but they lost to Toronto by a score of 13–12 in front of 9289 fans.
*Head Coach Bob McMahon was named NLL Head Coach of the Year.

==Attendance problems==
For various reasons, the Albany Attack were plagued by poor attendance most of their existence with average attendances in the 3000–4000 range which was not enough for the franchise to be profitable.

On June 14, 2001, Albany Attack owner Herb Chorbajian, a banker with CharterOne Bank, and Albany River Rats owner Walter Robb announced an agreement in which Robb would purchase a minority equity share in the Albany Attack. Given both teams played in the Pepsi Arena, the purpose of the agreement was to establish marketing and promotional synergy.

Despite the agreement, the Albany Attack was still not profitable so, throughout the 2002 season, Herb Chorbajian considered selling the Albany Attack. However, the success of the playoffs encouraged him to keep the team for another season. Furthermore, in the summer of 2002, the Albany Attack Pack, the Official Fan Club of the Albany Attack, was created by several fans with hopes of improving attendance.

In the 2003 season, according to Albany Attack General Manager Michael DeRossi, season ticket sales did go up considerably over the previous season, but the marketing effort actually decreased. Furthermore, the Attack went only 2–6 in their first eight games, losing all four home games to that point. While the Attack did have a second half record of 6–2, they never recovered enough to return to the playoffs nor did they have sufficient attendance to be profitable.

==Move to San Jose==
With no significant improvement in attendance throughout the 2003 season, the Albany Attack were destined to be a financial loss for a fourth consecutive year. During that season, there were numerous rumors that Mr. Chorbajian was going to sell the franchise, in particular to a group from San Jose, California.

On June 9, 2003, the rumors were confirmed when an announcement was made that the Albany Attack franchise was sold and relocated to San Jose, California where it was located until 2009. Mr. Chorbajian retained a share in the franchise. This may no longer be the case as the team has since been resold.

During the summer of 2003, the new owners had a &quot;Name the Team Contest&quot; and, on September 16, 2003, the winner, a high school sophomore from San Jose, elected to officially rename the team the San Jose Stealth.

On June 17, 2009, the Stealth announced it would be moving to Everett, Washington effective immediately. The newly renamed Washington Stealth played their home games at the Comcast Arena at Everett beginning in the 2010 season. Four years later, they relocated again to Vancouver, BC, becoming the Vancouver Stealth.

<text>Upper Norwood is an area of south London, England, within the London Boroughs of Bromley, Croydon, Lambeth and Southwark. It is north of Croydon. The eastern part of it is better known as the Crystal Palace area. The SE19 London postcode covers the entirety of the district.

Upper Norwood is one of the highest areas in London, situated along the London clay ridge known as Beulah Hill, which offers panoramic views northwards to central London and southwards to Central Croydon and the North Downs. Most housing dates from the 19th and 20th centuries, with large detached properties along the ridge and smaller, semi-detached and terraced dwellings on the slopes. There are some more modern areas of social housing that date from the 1970s, as well as the recent construction of larger apartment buildings on Beulah Hill.

==History==
For centuries, Upper Norwood was occupied by the Great North Wood, an extensive area of natural oak forest which formed a wilderness close to the southern edge of the ever-expanding city of London. The name &quot;Norwood&quot; is a contraction of &quot;North Wood&quot; (and should not be confused with Northwood or Norwood Green, both in west London). Local legend has it that Sir Francis Drake&#x27;s ship, the &quot;Golden Hind&quot;, was made from timber cut from trees in this area. The forest was a popular area for Londoners&#x27; recreation until the 19th century, when it began to be built over. It was also a haunt of Gypsies, with many local street names and pubs recording the link, notably Gipsy Hill. The area still retains woodland in large amounts for an urban area.

The Beulah Hill ridge was used as a sighting-point for the Anglo-French Survey (1784–1790), which measured the precise distance between the Royal Greenwich Observatory and the Paris Observatory, using trigonometry. It was particularly useful for this purpose on account of both its height and its relative proximity to Greenwich.

In 1831, one of England&#x27;s most prominent architects, Decimus Burton, designed a spa and pleasure gardens below Beulah Hill and off what is now Spa Hill in a bowl of land on the south facing side of the hill around a spring of chalybeate water. Burton was responsible for the Beulah Spa Hotel (demolished ) and the layout of the grounds. Its official title was The Royal Beulah Spa and Gardens. It became a popular society venue attracting large crowds to its &quot;fêtes&quot;. One widely publicized event was a &quot;Grand Scottish Fete&quot; on 16 September 1834 &quot;with a tightrope performance by Pablo Fanque&quot;, the black circus performer who would later dominate the Victorian circus and achieve immortality in the Beatles song &quot;Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!&quot; The spa closed in 1856, soon after the opening nearby of The Crystal Palace.

The Crystal Palace was rebuilt nearby on Sydenham Hill in 1854, following its success at The Great Exhibition of 1851 in Hyde Park. It was destroyed in a spectacular fire in 1936. The importance of this building and its impact on the locality for decades, led to the area immediately around the palace and its park becoming known as Crystal Palace. The most easterly district of Upper Norwood is now known as Crystal Palace and is the commercial hub of Upper Norwood, known locally as the &quot;Triangle&quot;. The most westerly district is known as Crown Point. The central district was once known as Norwood New Town, but this name is now only seen on older maps. The French impressionist Camille Pissarro painted around the area in the early 1870s, including in neighbouring Sydenham, producing scenes such as a view from &quot;Fox Hill, Upper Norwood&quot;, now in the National Gallery and the &quot;Crystal Palace&quot; painted from the Parade, now in the Art Institute of Chicago.

In March 1966, shortly before the World Cup tournament, the Jules Rimet trophy was stolen from an exhibition at Central Hall Westminster. It was found seven days later in Beulah Hill by a dog named &quot;Pickles&quot;. The story made national headlines.

==Landmarks==
St Joseph&#x27;s College is a Roman Catholic boys&#x27; secondary school which was first established in Upper Norwood in 1855. The school operates a coeducational sixth form. Harris Academy Beulah Hill was established in the area as Westwood High School in 1958.

The Cedars School and The Laurels School are Roman Catholic independent schools located on the former site of Virgo Fidelis Convent Senior School on Central Hill, founded in 1848. They occupy an eighteenth-century grand house, once the home of the notable socialite and courtesan Mary Nesbitt.

The Church of England Parish Church of St John the Evangelist on Sylvan Road, completed in 1887, is a notable example of the work of the architect John Loughborough Pearson. Designed in the Gothic Revival style, this Grade II* listed red brick building features some significant interior stone decoration and a stained glass window by Ninian Comper, who lived in the area.

Upper Norwood Library in Westow Hill, the only independent public library in the UK, was built in 1899 by joint agreement of the London Borough of Croydon and the London Borough of Lambeth. The library holds a Local History Collection of the Upper Norwood district and the Crystal Palace.

A notable park in the area is Upper Norwood Recreation Ground. Its site is part of the Harold Road Conservation Area. Its boundary is defined by Chevening Road, Hermitage Road, Eversley Road and Harold Road. One of London&#x27;s hidden rivers, River Effra flows under the park and at the Harold Road end a wellhead exists. It was covered in the 1940s. The Upper Norwood Recreation Ground was a location in Patrick Keiller&#x27;s 1983 film, &quot;Norwood&quot;, and in Chris Shepherd&#x27;s 2010 film &quot;Bad Night for the Blues&quot;.

The Croydon transmitting station, a TV transmitter tower, stands on the hill at Upper Norwood and a second larger TV transmitter, the Crystal Palace transmitting station, stands in Crystal Palace Park. Together these make the district a landmark location, visible from any part of the London area.

In 1985 a Safeway supermarket opened on Westow Street. In 1990 the exterior of this branch featured in a clip of the television drama series Grange Hill. The store was acquired by Morrisons in March 2004, who closed it in November 2005. The lease of the vacant store was purchased by Sainsbury&#x27;s in August 2006.

==Transport==
The hilly nature of the land has restricted the construction of railways through the district. The former branch line terminus at Crystal Palace High Level railway station which opened in 1865 closed in 1954, and the remaining Crystal Palace railway station is some distance below Upper Norwood, and approached by many steps. However, Crystal Palace Parade remains an important bus interchange and many residents instead use plentiful local bus routes to travel to West Norwood, Tulse Hill, Streatham, West Dulwich or Norbury railway stations. The disconnection from the capital&#x27;s rail/tube network has led to it having lower house prices than other areas possessing scenic views of London.

<text>The Washington Power were a member of the National Lacrosse League during the 2001 and 2002 seasons. After the inaugural championship in 1987 in Baltimore (as the Thunder) through 1999 and an unsuccessful stint in Pittsburgh (as the CrosseFire), the franchise moved to Washington, D.C. in 2001, with a new ownership structure led by Steve Comiskey, a DC attorney to high-tech billionaires, Wall Steeet executive Gene Podsiadlo, and star player Gary Gait. After two seasons of low attendance in Washington, the franchise moved again, this time to Denver, Colorado, as the Colorado Mammoth. In Colorado they have seen success both on and off the field, culminating in 2006, when they had the highest attendance in the league, and also won the Champion&#x27;s Cup.

The area of the Vale of Aylesbury, where many of the houses were situated, became known as &quot;Rothchildshire&quot;. In the 20th century many of these properties were sold off with their art collections dispersed. Today only Eythrope House still belongs to the family; however, they still retain influence in how Ascott House and Waddesdon Manor are managed. In the loss of country houses in the 20th century only Aston Clinton was lost.

<text>Get in the Zone is the debut studio album by Filipino boy band SB19, released on July 31, 2020, by Sony Music Philippines. It contains six original compositions, an electronic remix, and two instrumentals.

== Background and development ==

In a press conference, ShowBT CEO Robin Geong discussed to inform the media for what&#x27;s in store for SB19 in 2020. One of the events that was scheduled was the group&#x27;s debut album release. The music production for SB19&#x27;s first full album has come to completion and was originally planned to be released in March 2020. Most of the songs were written before the release of &quot;Go Up&quot;, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, they need to find time when to drop it.

The album is an incorporation of all the things that the group has experienced during their trainee days which they &quot;put all the emotions that they went through into their music&quot; and hoped that they got to inspire people with their story. Lyrically, the album speaks of the creative and personal journey of the group which reflected on the different emotions showed in the tracks—happiness, hopefulness, inspiration, sadness, and sorrow. The members of the group were involved in the process of making the album, collaborating with their producers in South Korea, through their agency ShowBT. Pablo was credited for writing the lyrics of all the tracks in the album.

== Release and promotion ==
On July 19, 2020, SB19 uploaded a poster captioned &quot;Coming&quot; with an invitation envelope illustration. It was then concluded that the post was pertaining to the album release after the band posted the album release schedule. A day after, they held a Q&amp;A activity in collaboration with Twitter to communicate with their fans to hype up the album. Teasers were uploaded from July 22, 2020 until July 27, 2020 and finally releasing the track list on July 29, 2020. &quot;Get in the Zone&quot; was release worldwide on July 31, 2020 through Sony Music as a digital album, with the band hosting an album release party broadcast on their YouTube channel. On October 9, 2020, they released an animated music video for the title track &quot;Hanggang sa Huli&quot; directed by the member Justin. The title track was performed mostly on the events they are guests of such as in the Awit Awards 2020 and Wish 1075 digital concert. On November 21, the band held their first ever global online concert hosted by Global Live in which they performed all the tracks in the album with additional new performances. On December 7, the physical copies of the album were released in a CD format to purchase through Lazada or Facebook in conjunction with the official launching of their online store.

== Singles ==
&quot;Tilaluha&quot; was released on October 26, 2018, as a debut single and also later re-released under their new record label on February 1, 2020. The music video was released one day earlier than the official release date on all major music platforms. Despite its least reception to the majority,

The second single, &quot;Go Up&quot;, was originally released on July 19, 2019 under ShowBT Philippines with the music video dropped after 10 days. The song received lukewarm reception until they uploaded its dance practice on YouTube which was shared by fans on Twitter and Facebook. The video received positive feedbacks from people because of the group&#x27;s synchronized dance moves which eventually became viral on social media. This happening made SB19 gained a rising popularity. Later on December, SB19 signed a contract with Sony Music Philippines to expand their reach into the market. With their new record label, two of their songs were re-released which includes &quot;Go Up&quot; on January 23, 2020. SB19 recorded a total of five entries on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts after Next Big Sound, Emerging Artists, and Social 50.

The third single, &quot;Alab (Burning)&quot;, was released on the day of Christmas, December 25 in 2019, as the first official single under the group&#x27;s new record label Sony Music Philippines, Inc. SB19 announced the new single after selling out their first major concert on Cuneta Astrodome. The track was produced by Han Tae Soo which entails about finding true love and doing whatever it takes to win that person over. A lyric video was uploaded on their YouTube channel a day after, and finally drops the music video on January 10, 2020.

The album&#x27;s title track, &quot;Hanggang sa Huli&quot;, served as the fourth official single off &quot;Get in the Zone&quot;. It received the most promotion across shows, guesting, and concerts. On October 1, 2020, SB19 announced the date of the premiere of its official music video through a release date teaser and schedule. The music video, directed &amp; written by the group&#x27;s member Justin and animated by Julian Bacani (JuJuArts), was premiered on October 9, 2020 on their YouTube channel.

<doc id="319997" wikidata="Q57133" url="?curid=319997" title="Kurt von Schleicher">
<text>Kurt Ferdinand Friedrich Hermann von Schleicher (; 7 April 1882 – 30 June 1934) was a German military officer and the penultimate chancellor of Germany during the Weimar Republic. A rival for power with Adolf Hitler, Schleicher was murdered by Hitler&#x27;s &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; during the Night of the Long Knives in 1934.

Schleicher was born into a military family in Brandenburg an der Havel on 7 April 1882. Entering the Prussian Army as a lieutenant in 1900, he rose to become a General Staff officer in the Railway Department of the German General Staff and served in the General Staff of the Supreme Army Command during World War I. Schleicher served as liaison between the Army and the new Weimar Republic during the German Revolution of 1918–1919. An important player in the Reichswehr&#x27;s efforts to avoid the restrictions of the Treaty of Versailles, Schleicher rose to power as head of the Reichswehr&#x27;s Armed Forces Department and was a close advisor to President Paul von Hindenburg from 1926 onward. Following the appointment of his mentor Wilhelm Groener as Minister of Defence in 1928, Schleicher became head of the Defence Ministry&#x27;s Office of Ministerial Affairs (&quot;Ministeramt&quot;) in 1929. In 1930, he was instrumental in the toppling of Hermann Müller&#x27;s government and the appointment of Heinrich Brüning as Chancellor. He enlisted the services of the Nazi Party&#x27;s SA as an auxiliary force for the Reichswehr from 1931 onward.

Beginning in 1932, Schleicher served as Minister of Defence in the cabinet of Franz von Papen. Schleicher organized the downfall of Papen and succeeded him as Chancellor on 3 December. During his brief term, Schleicher negotiated with Gregor Strasser on a possible defection of the latter from the Nazi Party, but the plan was abandoned. Schleicher attempted to &quot;tame&quot; Hitler into cooperating with his government by threatening him with an anti-Nazi alliance of parties, the so-called &quot;Querfront&quot; (&quot;cross-front&quot;). Hitler refused to abandon his claim to the chancellorship and Schleicher&#x27;s plan failed. Schleicher then proposed to Hindenburg that the latter disperse the Reichstag and rule as a &quot;de facto&quot; dictator, a course of action Hindenburg rejected.

On 28 January 1933, facing a political impasse and deteriorating health, Schleicher resigned and recommended the appointment of Hitler in his stead. Schleicher sought to return to politics by exploiting the divisions between Ernst Röhm and Hitler but on 30 June 1934 he and his wife Elisabeth were murdered on the orders of Hitler during the Night of the Long Knives.

==Early life and family==

Kurt von Schleicher was born in Brandenburg an der Havel, the son of Prussian officer and noble Hermann Friedrich Ferdinand von Schleicher (1853–1906) and a wealthy East Prussian shipowner&#x27;s daughter, Magdalena Heyn (1857–1939). He had an older sister, Thusnelda Luise Amalie Magdalene (1879–1955), and a younger brother, Ludwig-Ferdinand Friedrich (1884–1923). On 28 July 1931, Schleicher married Elisabeth von Schleicher, daughter of the Prussian general Victor von Hennigs. She had previously been married to Schleicher&#x27;s cousin, Bogislav von Schleicher, whom she had divorced on 4 May 1931.

He studied at the &quot;Hauptkadettenanstalt&quot; in Lichterfelde from 1896 to 1900. He was promoted to &quot;Leutnant&quot; on 22 March 1900 and was assigned to the 3rd Foot Guards, where he befriended fellow junior officers Oskar von Hindenburg, Kurt von Hammerstein-Equord and Erich von Manstein. From 1 November 1906 to 31 October 1909, he served as adjutant of the &quot;Fusilier&quot; battalion of his regiment.

After his promotion to &quot;Oberleutnant&quot; on 18 October 1909, he was assigned to the Prussian Military Academy, where he met Franz von Papen. Upon graduation on 24 September 1913, he was assigned to the German General Staff where he joined the Railway Department at his own request. He soon became a protégé of his immediate superior, Lieutenant Colonel Wilhelm Groener. Schleicher was promoted to captain on 18 December 1913.

==First World War==
After the outbreak of the First World War, Schleicher was assigned to the General Staff at the Supreme Army Command. During the Battle of Verdun he wrote a manuscript criticising war profiteering in certain industrial sectors, causing a sensation and earning him the approval of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) chairman Friedrich Ebert and a reputation as a liberal. From November 1916 to May 1917, Schleicher served in the &quot;Kriegsamt&quot; (War Office), an agency tasked with administering the war economy led by Groener.

Schleicher&#x27;s only front-line mission was as Chief of Staff of the 237th Division on the Eastern Front from 23 May 1917 to mid-August 1917 during the Kerensky Offensive. He served the rest of the war at the Supreme Army Command. He was promoted to Major on 15 July 1918. Following the collapse of the German war effort from August 1918 onward, Schleicher&#x27;s patron Groener was appointed &quot;Erster Generalquartiermeister&quot; and assumed &quot;de facto&quot; command of the German Army on 29 October 1918. As Groener&#x27;s trusted assistant, Schleicher became a crucial liaison between the civil and military authorities.

==Army service after First World War==
===German Revolution===
After the November Revolution of 1918, the situation of the German military was precarious. In December 1918, Schleicher delivered an ultimatum to Friedrich Ebert on behalf of Paul von Hindenburg demanding that the German provisional government either allow the Army to crush the Spartacus League or the Army would do that task itself.

During the ensuing talks with the German cabinet, Schleicher was able to get permission to allow the Army to return to Berlin. On 23 December 1918, the provisional government under Ebert came under attack from the radical left-wing &quot;Volksmarinedivision&quot;. Schleicher played a key role in negotiating the Ebert–Groener pact. In exchange for agreeing to send help to the government, Schleicher was able to secure Ebert&#x27;s assent to the Army being allowed to maintain its political autonomy as a &quot;state within the state&quot;.

To crush the left-wing rebels, Schleicher helped to found the &quot;Freikorps&quot; in early January 1919. Schleicher&#x27;s role for the rest of the Weimar Republic was to serve as the &quot;Reichswehr&quot;&#x27;s political fixer, who would ensure that the military&#x27;s interests would be secured.

===1920s===
====Contacts with the Soviet Union====
In the early 1920s, Schleicher emerged as a leading protégé of General Hans von Seeckt, who often gave Schleicher sensitive assignments. In the spring of 1921, Seeckt created a secret group within the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; known as &quot;Sondergruppe R&quot;, whose task was to work with the Red Army in their common struggle against the international system established by the Treaty of Versailles. Schleicher worked out the arrangements with Leonid Krasin for German aid to the Soviet arms industry. German financial and technological aid in building the industry was exchanged for Soviet support in helping Germany circumvent the disarmament clauses of the Treaty of Versailles. Schleicher created several dummy corporations, most notably the GEFU (&quot;Gesellschaft zur Förderung gewerblicher Unternehmungen&quot;, &quot;Company for the Promotion of Industrial Enterprise&quot;), which funnelled 75 million &quot;Reichsmarks&quot;, some $18 million (equivalent to $ million in ), into the Soviet arms industry by the end of 1923.

====Black Reichswehr====
At the same time, a team led by Fedor von Bock and comprising Schleicher, Eugen Ott and Kurt von Hammerstein-Equord established what came to be known as the Black &quot;Reichswehr&quot;. Major Bruno Ernst Buchrucker was tasked with building up the &quot;Arbeitskommandos&quot; (Work Commandos), officially a labor group intended to assist with civilian projects but in reality a force of soldiers. This fiction allowed Germany to exceed the limits on troop strength set by the Versailles Treaty. The Black &quot;Reichswehr&quot; became infamous for its practice of using &quot;Feme&quot; murders to punish &quot;traitors&quot; who, for example, revealed the locations of weapons&#x27; stockpiles or names of members. During the trials of some of those charged with the murders, prosecutors alleged that the killings were ordered by the officers from Bock&#x27;s group.

Schleicher denied in court that the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; ministry had had any knowledge the &quot;Black &quot;Reichswehr&quot;&quot; or the murders they had committed. In a secret letter sent to the president of the German Supreme Court, which was trying a member of the Black &quot;Reichswehr&quot; for murder, Seeckt admitted that the Black &quot;Reichswehr&quot; was controlled by the &quot;Reichswehr&quot;, and claimed that the murders were justified by the struggle against Versailles; the court should therefore acquit the defendant. Although Seeckt disliked Schleicher, he appreciated his political finesse, and came increasingly to assign Schleicher tasks dealing with politicians.

====Military-political role in the Weimar Republic====
Despite Seeckt&#x27;s patronage, it was Schleicher who brought about the former&#x27;s downfall in 1926 by leaking the fact that Seeckt had invited the former Crown Prince to attend military manoeuvres. After Seeckt&#x27;s fall Schleicher became, in the words of Andreas Hillgruber, &quot;in fact, if not in name [the] military-political head of the &quot;Reichswehr&quot;&quot;. Schleicher&#x27;s triumph was also the triumph of the &quot;modern&quot; faction within the &quot;Reichswehr&quot;, which favored a total war ideology and wanted Germany to become a dictatorship that would wage total war upon the other nations of Europe.

During the 1920s Schleicher moved up steadily in the &quot;Reichswehr&quot;, becoming the primary liaison between the army and civilian government officials. He was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel on 1 January 1924, and Colonel in 1926. On 29 January 1929, he became &quot;Generalmajor&quot;. Schleicher generally preferred to operate behind the scenes, planting stories in friendly newspapers and relying on a casual network of informers to find out what other government departments were planning. Following the hyperinflation of 1923, the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; took over much of the administration of the country between September 1923 and February 1924, a task in which Schleicher played a prominent role.

The appointment of Groener as Defence Minister in January 1928 did much to advance Schleicher&#x27;s career. Groener, who regarded Schleicher as his &quot;adopted son&quot;, created the &quot;Ministeramt&quot; (Office of the Ministerial Affairs) for Schleicher in 1928. The new office officially dealt with all matters relating to joint concerns of the Army and Navy, and was tasked with liaising between the military and other departments, and between the military and politicians. Because Schleicher interpreted that mandate very broadly, the &quot;Ministeramt&quot; quickly became the means by which the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; interfered in politics. The creation of the &quot;Ministeramt&quot; formalized Schleicher&#x27;s position as the chief political fixer for the &quot;Reichswehr&quot;, a role which had existed informally since 1918. He became &quot;Chef des Ministeramtes&quot; on 1 February 1929.

Like his patron Groener, Schleicher was alarmed by the results of the &quot;Reichstag&quot; election of 1928, in which the Social Democrats (SPD) won the largest share of the vote on a platform of scrapping the building of &quot;Panzerkreuzer&quot; A, the intended lead ship of the proposed &quot;Deutschland&quot; class of &quot;pocket battleships&quot; together with the entire &quot;pocket battleship&quot; building programme. Schleicher opposed the prospect of a &quot;grand coalition&quot; headed by the SPD&#x27;s Hermann Müller, and made it clear that he preferred that the SPD be excluded from power on the grounds that their anti-militarism disqualified them from office. Both Groener and Schleicher had decided in the aftermath of the 1928 elections to put an end to democracy as the Social Democrats could not be trusted with power. Groener depended on Schleicher to get favorable military budgets passed. Schleicher justified Groener&#x27;s confidence by getting the naval budget for 1928 passed despite the opposition of the Social Democrats. Schleicher prepared Groener&#x27;s statements to the Cabinet and attended Cabinet meetings on a regular basis. Above all, Schleicher won the right to brief President Hindenburg on both political and military matters.

In 1929, Schleicher came into conflict with Werner von Blomberg, the chief of the &quot;Truppenamt&quot; (the disguised General Staff). That year Schleicher had started a policy of &quot;frontier defense&quot; (&quot;Grenzschutz&quot;), under which the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; would stockpile arms in secret depots and start training volunteers, in excess of the limits imposed by Versailles, in the eastern parts of Germany facing Poland. Blomberg wished to extend the system to the French border. Schleicher disagreed, wanting to give the French no excuse to delay their 1930 withdrawal from the Rhineland. Blomberg lost the struggle and was demoted from command of the &quot;Truppenamt&quot; and sent to command a division in East Prussia.

==Presidential government==
In late 1926 or early 1927, Schleicher told Hindenburg that if it were impossible to form a government headed by the German National People&#x27;s Party alone, then Hindenburg should &quot;appoint a government in which he had confidence, without consulting the parties or paying attention to their wishes&quot;, and with &quot;the order for dissolution ready to hand, give the government every constitutional opportunity to get a majority in Parliament.&quot; Together with Hindenburg&#x27;s son, Major Oskar von Hindenburg, Otto Meißner, and General Wilhelm Groener, Schleicher was a leading member of the &quot;Kamarilla&quot; that surrounded President von Hindenburg. It was Schleicher who came up with the idea of a presidential government based on the so-called &quot;25/48/53 formula&quot;, which referred to the three articles of the Weimar Constitution that could make a presidential government possible:
* Article 25 allowed the President to dissolve the &quot;Reichstag&quot;.
* Article 48 allowed the President to sign into law emergency bills without the consent of the &quot;Reichstag&quot;. However the &quot;Reichstag&quot; could cancel any law passed by Article 48 by a simple majority within sixty days of its passage.
* Article 53 allowed the President to appoint the Chancellor.

Schleicher&#x27;s idea was to have Hindenburg use his powers under Article 53 to appoint a man of Schleicher&#x27;s choosing as Chancellor, who would rule under the provisions of Article 48. Should the &quot;Reichstag&quot; threaten to annul any laws so passed, Hindenburg could counter with the threat of dissolution. Hindenburg was unenthusiastic about these plans, but was pressured into going along with them by his son, Meißner, Groener, and Schleicher.

Schleicher was well known for his sense of humor, his lively conversational skills, his sharp wit, and his habit of abandoning his upper class aristocratic accent to speak his German with a salty working class Berlin accent, full of risqué phrases that many found either charming or vulgar.

During the course of the winter of 1929–30, Schleicher undermined the &quot;Grand Coalition&quot; government of Hermann Müller by means of various intrigues, with the support of Groener and Hindenburg. In January 1930, after receiving &quot;Zentrum&quot; party leader Heinrich Brüning&#x27;s assent to heading a presidential government, Schleicher had told Brüning that the &quot;Hindenburg government&quot; was to be &quot;anti-Marxist&quot; and &quot;anti-parliamentarian&quot;, and under no conditions were the Social Democrats to be allowed to serve in office, even though the SPD was the largest party in the &quot;Reichstag&quot;. In March 1930, Müller&#x27;s government fell, and the first presidential government headed by Brüning came into office. The German historian Eberhard Kolb described the presidential governments that began in March 1930 as a sort of &#x27;creeping&#x27; &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;, by which the government gradually become more and more authoritarian and less and less democratic, a process that culminated with the Nazi regime in 1933. The British historian Edgar Feuchtwanger called the Brüning government Schleicher&#x27;s &quot;brainchild&quot;.

===Social function of the Army===

Although essentially a Prussian authoritarian, Schleicher also believed that the Army had a social function as an institution unifying the diverse elements in society. He was also opposed to policies such as Eastern Aid (Osthilfe) for the bankrupt East Elbian estates of his fellow Junkers.

To bypass Part V of the Treaty of Versailles, which had forbidden conscription, Schleicher engaged the services of the SA and other paramilitaries as the best substitute for conscription. From December 1930 onwards, Schleicher was in regular secret contact with Ernst Röhm, the leader of the SA, who soon became one of his best friends. On 2 January 1931 Schleicher changed the Defense Ministry&#x27;s rules to allow Nazis to serve in military depots and arsenals, though not as officers, combat troops or sailors. Before 1931, members of the military had been strictly forbidden to join any political parties, because the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; was supposed to be non-political. It was only Nazis who were allowed to join the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; in Schleicher&#x27;s changing of the rules; if a member of the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; joined any other political party, he would be dishonourably discharged. In March 1931, without the knowledge of either Groener or Adolf Hitler, Schleicher and Röhm reached a secret arrangement that in the event of a war with Poland or a Communist &quot;putsch&quot;, or both, the SA would mobilise and come under the command of &quot;Reichswehr&quot; officers in order to deal with the national emergency. The close friendship between Schleicher and Röhm was later in 1934 to provide a seemingly factual basis to Hitler&#x27;s claim that Schleicher and Röhm had been plotting to overthrow him, thus justifying the assassination of both.

Like the rest of the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; leadership, Schleicher saw democracy as an impediment to military power, and was convinced that only a dictatorship could make Germany a great military power again. It was Schleicher&#x27;s dream to create a &quot;Wehrstaat&quot; (Military State), in which the military would reorganize German society as part of the preparations for the total war that the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; wished to wage. From the second half of 1931 onwards Schleicher was the leading advocate within the German government of the &quot;Zähmungskonzept&quot; (taming concept) where the Nazis were to be &quot;tamed&quot; by being brought into the government. Schleicher, a militarist to the core, greatly admired the militarism of the Nazis; and the fact that &quot;Grenzschutz&quot; was working well, especially in East Prussia where the SA was serving as an unofficial militia backing up the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; was seen as a model for future Army-Nazi co-operation.

Schleicher became a major figure behind the scenes in the presidential cabinet government of Heinrich Brüning between 1930 and 1932, serving as an aide to &quot;General&quot; Groener, the Minister of Defense. Eventually, Schleicher, who established a close relationship with &quot;Reichspräsident&quot; (&quot;Reich President&quot;) Paul von Hindenburg, came into conflict with Brüning and Groener and his intrigues were largely responsible for their fall in May 1932.

===Presidential election of 1932===
One of Schleicher&#x27;s aides later recalled that Schleicher viewed the Nazis as &quot;an essentially healthy reaction of the &quot;Volkskörper&quot;&quot; and praised the Nazis as &quot;the only party that could attract voters away from the radical left and had already done so.&quot; In March 1932 he wrote in a letter to Groener about the Nazis: &quot;If they weren&#x27;t there, one would have to invent them.&quot;

Schleicher planned to secure Nazi support for a new right-wing presidential government of his creation, thereby destroying German democracy. Schleicher would then crush the Nazis by exploiting feuds between various Nazi leaders and by incorporating the SA into the &quot;Reichswehr&quot;. During this period, Schleicher became increasingly convinced that the solution to all of Germany&#x27;s problems was a &quot;strong man&quot; and that he was that strong man.

Schleicher told Hindenburg that his gruelling re-election campaign was the fault of Brüning. Schleicher claimed that Brüning could have had Hindenburg&#x27;s term extended by the &quot;Reichstag&quot;, but that he chose not to in order to humiliate Hindenburg by making him appear on the same stage as Social Democratic leaders. Brüning banned the SA and the SS on 13 April 1932 on the grounds they were ones chiefly responsible for the wave of political violence afflicting Germany. The banning of the SA and SS saw an immediate and huge drop in the amount of political violence in Germany but threatened to destroy Schleicher&#x27;s policy of reaching out to the Nazis, and as a result Schleicher decided that both Brüning and Groener had to go.

On 16 April, Groener received an angry letter from Hindenburg demanding to know why the &quot;Reichsbanner&quot;, the paramilitary wing of the Social Democrats had not also been banned. This was especially the case as Hindenburg said he had solid evidence that the &quot;Reichsbanner&quot; was planning a coup. The same letter from the president was leaked and appeared that day in all the right-wing German newspapers. Groener discovered that Eugen Ott, a close protégé of Schleicher, had made the Social Democratic &quot;putsch&quot; allegations to Hindenburg and leaked the President&#x27;s letter. British historian John Wheeler-Bennett wrote that the evidence for an intended SPD &quot;putsch&quot; was &quot;flimsy&quot; at best, and this was just Schleicher&#x27;s way of discrediting Groener in Hindenburg&#x27;s eyes. Groener&#x27;s friends told him that it was impossible that Ott would fabricate allegations of that sort or leak the President&#x27;s letter on his own, and that he should sack Schleicher at once. Groener refused to believe that his old friend had turned on him and refused to fire Schleicher.
At the same time, Schleicher started rumors that General Groener was a secret Social Democrat, and argued that because Groener&#x27;s daughter was born less than nine months after his marriage, Groener was unfit to hold office. On 8 May 1932, in exchange for promising to dissolve the &quot;Reichstag&quot; and lift the ban on the SA and the SS, Schleicher received a promise from Hitler to support a new government. After Groener had been savaged in a &quot;Reichstag&quot; debate with the Nazis over the alleged Social Democratic &quot;putsch&quot; and Groener&#x27;s lack of belief in it, Schleicher told his mentor that &quot;he no longer enjoyed the confidence of the Army&quot; and must resign at once, echoing Groener&#x27;s words to the Kaiser in 1918. When Groener appealed to Hindenburg, the president sided with Schleicher and told Groener to resign. With that, Groener resigned as Defense and Interior Minister.
===The Papen government===
On 30 May 1932, Schleicher&#x27;s intrigues bore fruit when Hindenburg dismissed Brüning as Chancellor and appointed Franz von Papen as his successor. Feuchtwanger called Schleicher the &quot;principal wire-puller&quot; behind Brüning&#x27;s fall.

Schleicher had chosen Papen, who was unknown to the German public, as new Chancellor because he believed he could control Papen from behind the scenes. Kolb wrote of Schleicher&#x27;s &quot;key role&quot; in the downfall of not only Brüning, but also the Weimar Republic, for, by bringing down Brüning, Schleicher unintentionally set off a series of events that would lead directly to the Third &quot;Reich&quot;.

Schleicher&#x27;s example in bringing down the Brüning government led to a more overt politicization of the &quot;Reichswehr&quot;. From the spring of 1932 officers such as Werner von Blomberg and Walther von Reichenau had started talks on their own with the NSDAP. Schleicher&#x27;s example actually served to undermine his own power, since, in part, his power had always rested on the fact that he was the only general who was allowed to talk to the politicians.

===Minister of Defense===

The new Chancellor, Von Papen, in return appointed Schleicher as Minister of Defense, who now became &quot;General der Infanterie&quot;. Schleicher had selected the entire cabinet himself before he even had approached Papen with the offer to be Chancellor. The first act of the new government was to dissolve the &quot;Reichstag&quot; in accordance with Schleicher&#x27;s &quot;gentlemen&#x27;s agreement&quot; with Hitler on 4 June 1932. On 15 June 1932, the new government lifted the ban on the SA and the SS, who were secretly encouraged to indulge in as much violence as possible, both to discredit democracy and to provide a pretext for the new authoritarian regime Schleicher was working to create.
Besides ordering new &quot;Reichstag&quot; elections, Schleicher and Papen worked together to undermine the Social Democratic government of Prussia headed by Otto Braun. Schleicher fabricated evidence that the Prussian police under Braun&#x27;s orders were favoring the Communist &quot;Rotfrontkämpferbund&quot; in street clashes with the SA, which he used to get an emergency decree from Hindenburg imposing &quot;Reich&quot; control on Prussia. To facilitate his plans for a coup against the Prussian government and to avert the danger of a general strike which had defeated the Kapp Putsch of 1920, Schleicher had a series of secret meetings with trade union leaders, during which he promised them a leading role in the new authoritarian political system he was building, in return for which he received a promise that there would be no general strike in support of Braun.

In the &quot;Rape of Prussia&quot; on 20 July 1932, Schleicher had martial law proclaimed and called out the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; under Gerd von Rundstedt to oust the elected Prussian government, which was accomplished without a shot being fired. Using Article 48, Hindenburg named Papen the &quot;Reich&quot; Commissioner of Prussia. To help with advice for the new regime that he was planning to create, in the summer of 1932 Schleicher engaged the services of a group of right-wing intellectuals known as the &quot;Tatkreis&quot;, and through them got to know Gregor Strasser.
In the &quot;Reichstag&quot; election of 31 July 1932, the NSDAP became the largest party as expected. In August 1932, Hitler reneged on the &quot;gentlemen&#x27;s agreement&quot; he made with Schleicher that May, and instead of supporting the Papen government demanded the Chancellorship for himself. Schleicher was willing to accept Hitler&#x27;s demand, but Hindenburg refused, preventing Hitler from receiving the Chancellorship in August 1932. Schleicher&#x27;s influence with Hindenburg started to decline. Papen himself was most offended at the way Schleicher was prepared to forsake him casually.

On 12 September 1932, Papen&#x27;s government was defeated on a no-confidence motion in the &quot;Reichstag&quot;, at which point the &quot;Reichstag&quot; was again dissolved. In the election of 6 November 1932, the NSDAP lost seats, but still remained the largest party. By the beginning of November, Papen had shown himself to be more assertive than Schleicher had expected; this led to a growing rift between the two. Schleicher brought down Papen&#x27;s government on 3 December 1932, when Papen told the Cabinet that he wished to declare martial law rather than losing face after another motion of no-confidence. Schleicher released the results of a war game which showed that if martial law was declared, the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; would not be able to defeat the various paramilitary groups. With the martial law option now off the table, Papen was forced to resign and Schleicher became Chancellor. This war games study, which was done by and presented to the Cabinet by one of Schleicher&#x27;s close aides General Eugen Ott, was rigged with the aim of forcing Papen to resign. Papen became consumed with hatred against his former friend who had forced him from office.

===Chancellorship===
Schleicher hoped to attain a majority in the &quot;Reichstag&quot; by gaining the support of the Nazis for his government. In mid-December 1932, Schleicher told a meeting of senior military leaders that the collapse of the Nazi movement was not in the best interests of the German state. By the end of 1932, the NSDAP was running out of money, increasingly prone to in-fighting and was discouraged by the &quot;Reichstag&quot; election of November 1932 where the party had lost votes. Schleicher took the view that the NSDAP would sooner or later have to support his government because only he could offer the Nazis power and otherwise the NSDAP would continue to disintegrate.

To gain Nazi support while keeping himself Chancellor, Schleicher talked of forming a so-called &quot;Querfront&quot; (&quot;cross-front&quot;), whereby he would unify Germany&#x27;s fractious special interests around a non-parliamentary, authoritarian, but participatory regime as a way of forcing the Nazis to support his government. It was hoped that faced with the threat of the &quot;Querfront&quot;, Hitler would back down in his demand for the Chancellorship and support Schleicher&#x27;s government instead. Schleicher was never serious about creating a &quot;Querfront&quot;; he intended it to be a bluff to compel the NSDAP to support the new government. As part of his attempt to pressure Hitler into supporting his government, Schleicher went through the motions of attempting to found the &quot;Querfront&quot; by reaching out to the Social Democratic labor unions, the Christian labor unions, and the economically left-wing branch of the Nazi Party, led by Gregor Strasser.

On 4 December 1932, Schleicher met with Strasser and offered to restore the Prussian government from &quot;Reich&quot; control and make Strasser the new Minister-President of Prussia. Schleicher&#x27;s hope was that the threat of a split within the Nazi Party, with Strasser leading his faction out of the party, would force Hitler to support the new government. Schleicher&#x27;s policy failed as Hitler isolated Strasser in the party.

One of the main initiatives of the Schleicher government was a public works program intended to counter the effects of the Great Depression, which was shepherded by Günther Gereke, whom Schleicher had appointed special commissioner for employment. The various public works projects—which were to give 2 million unemployed Germans jobs by July 1933 and are often wrongly attributed to Hitler—were the work of the Schleicher government, which had passed the necessary legislation in January.

Schleicher&#x27;s relations with his Cabinet were poor because of Schleicher&#x27;s secretive ways and open contempt for his ministers. With two exceptions, Schleicher retained all of Papen&#x27;s cabinet, which meant that much of the unpopularity of the Papen government was inherited by Schleicher&#x27;s government. Shortly after Schleicher became Chancellor, he told some joke at the expense of Major Oskar von Hindenburg, which greatly offended the younger Hindenburg and reduced Schleicher&#x27;s access to the President. Papen by contrast had been able to stay on excellent terms with both Hindenburgs.

Regarding tariffs, Schleicher refused to make a firm stand. Schleicher&#x27;s non-policy on tariffs hurt his government very badly when on 11 January 1933 the leaders of the Agricultural League launched a blistering attack on Schleicher in front of Hindenburg. The Agricultural League leaders attacked Schleicher for his failure to keep his promise to raise tariffs on food imports, and for allowing to lapse a law from the Papen government that gave farmers a grace period from foreclosure if they defaulted on their debts. Hindenburg forced Schleicher to accede to all of the League&#x27;s demands.

In foreign policy, Schleicher&#x27;s main interest was in winning &quot;Gleichberechtigung&quot; (&quot;equality of status&quot;) at the World Disarmament Conference, which would do away with Part V of the Treaty of Versailles that had disarmed Germany. Schleicher made a point of cultivating the French ambassador André François-Poncet and stressing his concern with improving Franco-German relations. This was in part because Schleicher wanted to ensure French acceptance of &quot;Gleichberechtigung&quot; in order to allow Germany to rearm without fear of a French &quot;preventative war.&quot; He also believed that improving Berlin-Paris relations would lead the French to abrogate the Franco-Polish alliance of 1921, which would allow Germany to partition Poland with the Soviet Union without having to go to war with France. In a speech before a group of German journalists on 13 January 1933, Schleicher proclaimed that based on the acceptance &quot;in principle&quot; of &quot;Gleichberechtigung&quot; by the other powers at the World Disarmament Conference in December 1932, he planned to have by no later than the spring of 1934 a return to conscription and for Germany to have all the weapons forbidden by Versailles.

===Political misstep===
On 20 January 1933, Schleicher missed one of his best chances to save his government. Wilhelm Frick—who was in charge of the Nazi &quot;Reichstag&quot; delegation when Hermann Göring was not present—suggested to the &quot;Reichstag&quot;&#x27;s agenda committee that the &quot;Reichstag&quot; go into recess until the next budget could be presented, which would have been some time in the spring. Had this happened, by the time the recess ended, Schleicher would have been reaping the benefits of the public works projects that his government had begun in January, and in-fighting within the NSDAP would have worsened. Schleicher had his Chief of Staff, Erwin Planck, tell the &quot;Reichstag&quot; that the government wanted the recess to be as short as possible, which led to the recess being extended only to 31 January as Schleicher believed mistakenly that the &quot;Reichstag&quot; would not dare bring a motion of no-confidence against him as that would mean another election.

The ousted Papen now had Hindenburg&#x27;s ear, and used his position to advise the President to sack Schleicher at the first chance. Papen was urging the aged President to appoint Hitler as Chancellor in a coalition with the Nationalist &quot;Deutschnationale Volkspartei&quot; (German National People&#x27;s Party; DNVP) who, together with Papen, would supposedly work to rein in Hitler. Papen was holding secret meetings with both Hitler and Hindenburg, who then refused Schleicher&#x27;s request for emergency powers and another dissolution of the &quot;Reichstag&quot;. Schleicher for a long time refused to take seriously the possibility that Papen was working to bring him down.

The consequence of promoting the idea of presidential government where everything depended upon President Hindenburg&#x27;s whims, with the &quot;Reichstag&quot; weakened, meant that when Hindenburg decided against Schleicher, the latter was in an extremely weak political position. By January 1933, Schleicher&#x27;s reputation as the destroyer of governments, as a man who was just as happy intriguing against his friends as his enemies, and as a man who had betrayed all who had trusted him, meant he was universally distrusted and disliked by all factions, which further weakened his attempts to stay in power.

On 28 January 1933, Schleicher told his Cabinet that he needed a decree from the President to dissolve the &quot;Reichstag&quot;, or otherwise his government was likely to be defeated on a no-confidence vote when the &quot;Reichstag&quot; reconvened on 31 January. Schleicher then went to see Hindenburg to ask for the dissolution decree, and was refused. Upon his return to meet with the Cabinet, Schleicher announced his intention to resign, and signed a decree allowing for 500 million &quot;Reichsmarks&quot; to be spent on public works projects. Schleicher thought his successor was going to be Papen, and as such it was towards blocking that event that Schleicher devoted his energy.

On 29 January, Werner von Blomberg was sworn in by Hindenburg as Defense Minister promptly and in an illegal manner because in late January 1933 there were wild and untrue rumors circulating in Berlin that Schleicher was planning on staging a &quot;putsch&quot;.

The military, which until that moment had been Schleicher&#x27;s strongest bastion of support, now suddenly withdrew its support, seeing the Nazis and not Schleicher as the only ones who could mobilize popular support for a &quot;Wehrstaat&quot; (Defense State). By late January 1933 most senior officers in the Army were advising Hindenburg that Schleicher needed to go.

===Support for Hitler Chancellorship===

That same day, Schleicher, learning that his government was about to fall, and fearing that his rival Papen would get the Chancellorship, began to favor a Hitler Chancellorship. Knowing of Papen&#x27;s by now boundless hatred for him, Schleicher knew he had no chance of becoming Defense Minister in a new Papen government, but he felt his chances of becoming the Defense Minister in a Hitler government were very good.

Hitler was initially willing to support Schleicher as Defense Minister but a meeting with Schleicher&#x27;s associate Werner von Alvensleben convinced Hitler that Schleicher was about to launch a &quot;putsch&quot; to keep him out of power. In a climate of crisis, with wild rumors running rampant that Schleicher was moving troops into Berlin to depose Hindenburg, Papen convinced the President to appoint Hitler Chancellor the next day. The President dismissed Schleicher, calling Hitler into power on 30 January 1933. In the following months, the Nazis issued the Reichstag Fire Decree and the Enabling Act, transforming Germany into a dictatorship.

==Assassination==

Schleicher&#x27;s successor as Defense Minister was his arch-enemy Werner von Blomberg. One of Blomberg&#x27;s first acts as Defense Minister was to carry out a purge of the officers associated with Schleicher. Blomberg sacked Ferdinand von Bredow as chief of the &quot;Ministeramt&quot; and replaced him with General Walter von Reichenau, Eugen Ott was dismissed as chief of the &quot;Wehramt&quot; (the German armed forces, soon to be renamed to &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;) and exiled to Japan as military attaché, and General Wilhelm Adam was fired as chief of the &quot;Truppenamt&quot; (the disguised General Staff) and replaced with Ludwig Beck. The Army Commander-in-Chief and close associate of Schleicher&#x27;s, General Kurt von Hammerstein-Equord, resigned in despair in February 1934 as his powers had become more nominal than real. With Hammerstein&#x27;s resignation, the entire Schleicher faction which dominated the Army since 1926 had all been removed from their positions within the High Command, and thus destroyed any remaining source of power for Schleicher.

In the spring of 1934, hearing of the growing rift between Ernst Röhm and Hitler over the role of the SA in the Nazi state, Schleicher began playing politics again. Schleicher criticized the current Hitler cabinet, while some of Schleicher&#x27;s followers—such as General Ferdinand von Bredow and Werner von Alvensleben—started passing along lists of a new Hitler Cabinet in which Schleicher would become vice-chancellor, Röhm minister of defense, Brüning foreign minister and Strasser minister of national economy. Schleicher believed that as a &quot;Reichswehr&quot; general and as a close friend of Röhm that he could successfully mediate the dispute between Röhm and the military over Röhm&#x27;s demands that the SA absorb the &quot;Reichswehr&quot;, and that as such Hitler would fire Blomberg and give him back his old job as Defense Minister.

Hitler had considered Schleicher a target for assassination for some time. When the Night of the Long Knives occurred from 30 June to 2 July 1934, Schleicher was one of the chief victims. At about 10:30 am on 30 June 1934, a group of men wearing trench coats and fedoras emerged from a car parked on the street outside Schleicher&#x27;s villa (Griebnitzstrasse 4, Neubabelsberg near Potsdam) and walked up to Schleicher&#x27;s home. While Schleicher was talking on the phone, he heard somebody knocking at his door, and placed the phone down. Schleicher&#x27;s last words, heard by his friend on the phone, were &quot;Jawohl, ich bin General von Schleicher&quot; (&quot;Yes, I am General von Schleicher&quot;), followed by two shots. Upon hearing the shots, his wife Elisabeth von Schleicher ran into the front lobby, where she was shot as well. Schleicher died at the scene and his wife succumbed to her injuries en route to the hospital, without regaining consciousness.

===Funeral===
At his funeral, Schleicher&#x27;s friend von Hammerstein was offended when the SS refused to allow him to attend the service and confiscated wreaths that the mourners had brought. Hammerstein and &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; August von Mackensen began trying to have Schleicher rehabilitated. The army somehow obtained Schleicher&#x27;s file from the SS. Mackensen led a meeting of 400 officers that drank a toast to Schleicher, and entered his and Bredow&#x27;s names into the regimental honor roll.

In his speech to the &quot;Reichstag&quot; on 13 July justifying his actions, Hitler denounced Schleicher for conspiring with Röhm to overthrow the government. Hitler alleged that both Schleicher and Röhm were traitors working in the pay of France. As Schleicher had been a good friend of André François-Poncet, and because of his reputation for intrigue, the claim that Schleicher was working for France had enough surface plausibility for most Germans to accept it, although it was not true. The falsity of Hitler&#x27;s claims could be seen in that François-Poncet was not declared &quot;persona non grata&quot; as normally would happen if an ambassador was caught being involved in a coup plot against his host government. François-Poncet stayed on as French ambassador in Berlin until October 1938, which is incompatible with Hitler&#x27;s claim that the Frenchman had been involved in a plot to overthrow him.

The army&#x27;s support for clearing Schleicher&#x27;s reputation was effective. In late 1934 – early 1935, Werner von Fritsch and Werner von Blomberg, whom Hammerstein had shamed into joining his campaign, pressured Hitler into rehabilitating General von Schleicher, claiming that as officers they could not stand the press attacks on Schleicher, which portrayed him as a traitor working for France. In a speech given on 3 January 1935 at the Berlin State Opera, Hitler stated that Schleicher had been shot &quot;in error&quot;, that his murder had been ordered on the basis of false information and that Schleicher&#x27;s name was to be restored to the honor roll of his regiment.

The remarks rehabilitating Schleicher were not published in the German press, although &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; von Mackensen announced Schleicher&#x27;s rehabilitation at a public gathering of General Staff officers on 28 February 1935. As far as the Army was concerned, the matter of Schleicher&#x27;s murder was settled. The Nazis continued in private to accuse Schleicher of high treason. Hermann Göring told Jan Szembek during a visit to Warsaw in January 1935 that Schleicher had urged Hitler in January 1933 to reach an understanding with France and the Soviet Union, and partition Poland with the latter, which was why Hitler had Schleicher assassinated. Hitler told the Polish Ambassador Józef Lipski on 22 May 1935 that Schleicher was &quot;rightfully murdered, if only because he had sought to maintain the Rapallo Treaty&quot;. On hearing of the assassination, former German emperor Wilhelm II, living in exile in the Netherlands, commented, &quot;We have ceased to live under the rule of law and everyone must be prepared for the possibility that the Nazis will push their way in and put them up against the wall!&quot;

<text>Philipp Heinrich Scheidemann (26 July 1865 – 29 November 1939) was a German politician of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). In the first quarter of the 20th century he played a leading role in both his party and in the young Weimar Republic. During the German Revolution of 1918–1919 that broke out after Germany&#x27;s defeat in World War I, Scheidemann proclaimed a German Republic from a balcony of the Reichstag building. In 1919 he was elected Reich Minister President by the National Assembly meeting in Weimar to write a constitution for the republic. He resigned the office the same year due to a lack of unanimity in the cabinet on whether or not to accept the terms of the Treaty of Versailles.

Scheidemann continued to be a member of the Reichstag until 1933 and served as mayor of his native city of Kassel from 1920 to 1925. After Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party came to power in 1933, he went into exile because he was considered one of the &quot;November criminals&quot; held to be responsible for Germany&#x27;s defeat in the war and the collapse of the German Empire. While in exile he wrote extensively about German politics. He died in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 1939.

==Life==

=== Early years ===
Philipp Scheidemann was born in Kassel on 26 July 1865, the son of the upholsterer Friedrich Scheidemann (1842–79) and his wife Wilhelmine (née Pape, 1842–1907). He had two sisters.

Scheidemann attended elementary and secondary schools between 1871 and 1879. After the death of his father in 1879, the family fell into poverty. Following his school education, he completed an apprenticeship as a typesetter and letterpress printer from 1879 to 1883. Until he was thirty years old he worked in the book printing trade as a typesetter&#x27;s assistant and then as master typesetter in the printing shop of the Gotthelft brothers in Kassel, which published the , a local newspaper.

In 1883 Scheidemann joined the SPD, which had been banned under the Anti-Socialist Laws of Otto von Bismarck, and became a member of the Free Trade Union of Book Printers. Between 1888 and 1895 he was an honorary district chairman of the book printers&#x27; association in Marburg. There he also continued his education at the University of Marburg. The philosopher Hermann Cohen, who taught there, is said to have made a lasting impression on him.

In 1889 Scheidemann married Johanna Dibbern (1864–1926) in Kassel. They had three daughters: Lina (1889–1933), Liese (1891–1955), and Hedwig (1893–1935).

In 1895 he gave up the profession he had learned and became active for various social democratic newspapers. First he worked as an editor for the in Giessen, from 1900 for the in Nuremberg, from 1902 for the (Offenbach am Main) and finally from 1905 for the in his home town. In addition to political articles, Scheidemann wrote &quot;Dialect Stories&quot; every Sunday from 1909 under the pseudonym Henner Piffendeckel. He also published several books in the Kassel dialect.

=== Rise in the party and the Reichstag ===
In the 1903 Reichstag elections, Scheidemann entered the Reichstag of the German Empire for the constituency Düsseldorf 3, the city and district of Solingen. He was reelected in January 1907 and January 1912. From 1906 to 1911 he also held a seat as a city councilor in his home town of Kassel. When in 1911 he was elected to the SPD&#x27;s executive committee, of which he remained a member until 1918, he resigned his municipal mandate because the election required that he move to Berlin. After the death in 1913 of August Bebel, the long-time leader of the SPD, Scheidemann took over the chairmanship of the SPD parliamentary group together with Hugo Haase. He held the position until 1918. In 1912 Scheidemann became the first Social Democrat to be elected one of the vice presidents of the Reichstag, but since he refused to make the inaugural visit to the emperor – the &quot;going to court&quot; that the party had always frowned on – he was unable to take office. It was not until June to October 1918 that he actually held the office.

Unlike Friedrich Ebert, who became party co-chairman with Hugo Haase in 1913, Scheidemann had rhetorical talent. He could speak convincingly before mass meetings as well as small audiences. Wilhelm Keil, a friend and party comrade of both men, described Ebert as &quot;always serious, dignified and energetic&quot;, while Scheidemann was a &quot;brilliant rhetorician with somewhat boisterous manners ... which at times allowed doubts to arise as to what percentage of his seemingly holy fire was to be ascribed to theatricality&quot;. Scheidemann&#x27;s down-to-earth manners, his sense of humor and unshakeable cheerfulness earned him recognition outside the party.

His political style was on the pragmatic side. Whenever he could he avoided conflicts in which he saw little hope of resolution. He championed a cause only when it seemed possible that he would be successful in it. Before World War I he was a regular speaker on budgetary and army issues and regarded as a representative of the party&#x27;s center. When he directed sharp attacks against the imperial Hohenzollern family in the Reichstag in 1912, Reich Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg and the members of the Bundesrat who were present left the hall in protest. On several occasions Scheidemann represented German social democracy at congresses abroad. Publicity trips took him to France, Switzerland, and the United States.

A speech given by Scheidemann in Paris in 1912 caused a great public stir and was published in Germany in a distorted form to defame him specifically and the Social Democrats in general as &quot;traitors to the fatherland&quot;. In a Reichstag debate on 3 December 1912, Scheidemann&#x27;s party colleague Eduard David felt compelled to reproduce the true wording of Scheidemann&#x27;s disputed statements:&quot;Against those who try to push us down into the bestiality of a European war, we will defend ourselves with the courage of despair. The German workers and socialists also respect and love the French proletarians and socialists like brothers. ... Our enemy is ... in another place. It is where yours also is. That is capitalism. Let us wage the struggle together, comrades, for the progress of humanity, for the freedom of labor, for world peace.&quot;

=== World War I ===
During World War I Scheidemann represented a middle line between the right and left wings of the SPD. In principle he supported the approval of war credits, but he opposed a victorious peace and advocated a negotiated peace without annexations. His statement &quot;What is French shall remain French, what is Belgian shall remain Belgian, what is German shall remain German&quot; was called high treason in militarist-nationalist circles. Representatives of the German Fatherland Party in particular declared that they wanted to &quot;hang&quot; Scheidemann.

In January 1915 Scheidemann expressed his anger at elements in the SPD who could not bear to hear the word &quot;fatherland&quot;. His statement was preceded by Karl Liebknecht&#x27;s breach of party discipline when in December 1914 he voted against a war loan bill. Hugo Haase defended Liebknecht at the time, and he received numerous expressions of sympathy from within the SPD. The idea of a negotiated peace (&quot;Scheidemann Plan&quot;), however, could no longer prevent a split within the SPD on the issue of continued funding for the war. In April 1917 the party&#x27;s antiwar left wing formed the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (USPD), while the SPD itself was renamed the Majority Social Democratic Party of Germany (MSPD). In Scheidemann&#x27;s constituency of Solingen, the SPD organization joined the USPD and called on Scheidemann – without success – to resign his Reichstag seat. From October 1917, with the Würzburg Party Congress, Scheidemann was MSPD party chairman alongside Friedrich Ebert.

In view of the worsening social hardships of the working class caused by the war, the SPD had been pressing since the beginning of 1917 to fulfill its promise of a political reorganization of Germany. Negotiations began between Scheidemann, Conrad Haussmann of the center-left German Democratic Party and Gustav Stresemann of the National Liberal Party to form a left-wing parliamentary majority with the goal of giving the Reich a true parliamentary form of government with ministers responsible to it rather than the emperor. Scheidemann accommodated the bourgeois parties to the point of saying that he believed he could if necessary envision a parliamentary system with a monarch at its head. One result of the negotiations was the passage of the Reichstag Peace Resolution of 19 July 1917 by 212 votes to 126. It called for peace negotiations without demands for annexations.

To prevent radicalization at home, Scheidemann, Friedrich Ebert and Otto Braun joined the leadership of the January strikes of 1918 in which over a million workers demanded better living and working conditions, an end to the war and a democratization of the constitution. Their action earned the three men the hatred of the political right.

As parliamentary group chairman and leading figure of his party in the inter-party committee, Scheidemann played a significant role in ousting the government of Reich Chancellor Georg von Hertling in September 1918. Scheidemann and Ebert, however, had differing opinions about how to proceed. When politicians from the Progressive People&#x27;s Party brought Prince Maximilian von Baden into the discussion as Reich chancellor, Scheidemann said that the Social Democrats could not be expected to put a prince at the head of the government. On 3 October 1918, &quot;at the moment when the circumstances were the worst possible&quot;, Scheidemann opposed Social Democratic participation in the government. Friedrich Ebert finally persuaded the majority of the parliamentary group to agree to the MSPD&#x27;s entry into von Baden&#x27;s cabinet. It was the first time members of the SPD had served in the imperial government, although since 1912 the party had had the most seats in the Reichstag of any party.

Despite his reservations, Scheidemann and other leading politicians in the parliamentary majority became state secretaries without portfolio in the von Baden cabinet. Scheidemann was chosen for the position instead of Friedrich Ebert due to his greater popularity. The ministers were the true political decision-makers; Max von Baden was primarily representative to the outside world. Scheidemann as a member of the government initiated an amnesty for political prisoners. In particular, he personally pushed through the release of Karl Liebknecht in the face of opposition from the War Ministry and military courts, as well as objections from the Reich chancellor.

=== Proclamation of the Republic ===
In the face of an impending defeat in the war and the threat of revolutionary developments at home, Scheidemann said on 5 November 1918 that he thought Bolshevism a greater danger than the external enemy. In this he agreed with the Supreme Army Command. Communist propaganda and historiography later attributed the Reich government&#x27;s severance of relations with Soviet Russia on that day to Scheidemann and declared him &quot;the author of the anti-Soviet provocation directed against the Spartacus League&quot;.

Unlike the military, Scheidemann had come to the conclusion that a successful fight against the extreme left was possible only if Emperor Wilhelm II abdicated. Ebert and Scheidemann nevertheless postponed the fundamental question of monarchy or republic for the time being. Scheidemann had formulated the party&#x27;s course on 6 November: &quot;Now we must put ourselves at the head of the movement or there will be anarchistic conditions in the Reich.&quot; By use of an ultimatum the MSPD parliamentary group was able, among other things, to push through the parliamentarization of Prussia, Germany&#x27;s largest state, without being able to stop the outbreak of revolutionary actions in Berlin.
On 9 November 1918 Chancellor Max von Baden unilaterally announced the abdication of Emperor Wilhelm II and the renunciation of Crown Prince Wilhelm&#x27;s hereditary rights to the throne. Scheidemann handed in his resignation as secretary at 10 a.m. Around noon, Friedrich Ebert arrived at the Reich chancellery and demanded that the authority to govern be handed over to him and the MSPD. Von Baden resigned and in an unconstitutional act designated Ebert his successor as Reich chancellor and minister president of Prussia. When Ebert and Scheidemann went to the Reichstag building for lunch, they sat at separate tables. A huge crowd had gathered outside, and there were calls for a speech. Ebert refused to go out to them, but Scheidemann stood up and hurried to a window facing the crowd.  According to Scheidemann&#x27;s own recollection, someone told him along the way that the Spartacist leader Karl Liebknecht intended to declare Germany a soviet republic. Scheidemann then made a spontaneous speech that closed with the words: &quot;The old and rotten, the monarchy, has collapsed. Long live the new! Long live the German Republic!&quot;When Scheidemann returned to the Reichstag dining room, a furious Ebert confronted him. Ebert pounded the table with his fist and shouted, &quot;You have no right to proclaim the republic! What becomes of Germany, a republic or any other form, that is for a constituent assembly to decide!&quot; For Scheidemann, however, it was clear that the legitimization of the new leadership by Max von Baden&#x27;s declaration alone would not be sufficient. The demonstrating workers and soldiers expected a complete break with the imperial system.

At that point Wilhelm II had not abdicated, although he soon fled to the Netherlands and signed an abdication on 28 November. As of 9 November 1918 Germany was legally still a monarchy, which meant that Scheidemann&#x27;s speech had been without legal authority. Later that day, in spite of Scheidemann&#x27;s announcement, Ebert asked Prince Maximilian to stay on as imperial regent, but he refused. Both Ebert and Scheidemann still hoped to preserve the existing structure of government under a Chancellor Ebert, to restore calm and to deal with the pressing issue of the armistice with the Allied powers. Yet the revolution seemed likely to force the MSPD to share power with the far left Spartacists and USPD. In the afternoon of 9 November, Ebert grudgingly asked the USPD to nominate three ministers for a future government.

That evening a group of several hundred followers of the Revolutionary Stewards – workers&#x27; representatives who were independent of the formal unions – occupied the Reichstag and held an impromptu debate. They called for the election of soldiers&#x27; and workers&#x27; councils the next day with an eye to naming a provisional government to be called the Council of the People&#x27;s Deputies.  The MSPD leadership managed to ensure that most of the members elected to the workers&#x27; councils came from their ranks and so were able to provide three of the six members of the Council that was set up on 10 November: Ebert, Scheidemann and Otto Landsberg. Ebert became joint chairman with Hugo Haase (USPD), which provided the other three members (Haase, Wilhelm Dittmann und Emil Barth). Scheidemann was on the Council of the People&#x27;s Deputies for the entire period of its existence, from 10 November 1918 to 13 February 1919. He was responsible primarily for financial policy.

=== Reich minister president ===
During the fighting in Berlin in late December 1918 known as the Christmas crisis, Scheidemann backed Ebert&#x27;s decision to use military force against the occupation of the Palace by the leftist People&#x27;s Marine Division. That drew the fury of left-wing radicals. Signs carried at the funeral of those killed read &quot;Of the murder of the sailors we accuse Ebert, Landsberg and Scheidemann&quot;.

Scheidemann was elected a member of the Weimar National Assembly in the January 1919 federal election. He wanted to persuade Ebert, who was seeking the office of Reich president, to take over the office of Reich chancellor, as he was convinced that Ebert&#x27;s strengths lay in practical rather than representative activity. He therefore ran against Ebert in the presidential election in February 1919 but received only one of 379 valid votes cast by members of the National Assembly. Ebert, who received 73 percent of the votes, then entrusted Scheidemann with the formation of the government, which took place on 13 February 1919. Scheidemann held office from then until 20 June 1919 as Reich minister president, the designation for the head of government until the adoption of the Weimar Constitution and equivalent to Reich chancellor.

Scheidemann headed a cabinet consisting of the MSPD, the Christian democratic Centre Party and the center-left German Democratic Party (DDP) – a combination that came to be known as the Weimar Coalition. Historians attribute the relatively conflict-free work of the coalition government to Scheidemann&#x27;s role as a moderator rather than as a true leader in the administration of his office. Such assessments are sometimes interpreted as signs of weak leadership and a lack of assertiveness. Gustav Noske, who participated in the government as minister of military affairs, described the government&#x27;s actions as an expression of the democratic sentiments of the Social Democrats&#x27; leaders, to whom &quot;the idea of forcing those who think differently seemed criminal&quot;. Out of respect for the election results (the MSPD had 38% of the vote, the Centre 20%, the DDP 19%), the MSPD &quot;never acted in a forcible manner&quot; toward their bourgeois colleagues in the coalition government.

The most difficult domestic challenge for the cabinet were the strikes in the first months of 1919, which were primarily concerned with raising real wages that had fallen as a result of inflation. In the Ruhr region in particular, the strikes were combined with demands for the nationalization of mines. Since coal mining was a key factor in the economy as a whole, Scheidemann&#x27;s government responded in part by deploying Freikorps units but also by negotiating. In response to a general strike in central Germany in February 1919 involving three-quarters of all workers, Scheidemann had the Reichswehr (German army) occupy the city of Halle, but at the same time he announced steps to democratize the economy.

The unrest that Scheidemann&#x27;s government faced in Berlin was quite different. There the movement, which in the end came to be communist-led, was not concerned with economic goals but political ones. They included recognition of the workers&#x27; and soldiers&#x27; councils, implementation of the resolutions of the Reich Congress of Workers&#x27; and Soldiers&#x27; Councils () on military policy, and resumption of political and economic relations with the Soviet Union. The government used military force against the movement in the Berlin March battles. Mass strikes also occurred in Upper Silesia, Württemberg, and Magdeburg.

Scheidemann&#x27;s government adopted a law in the National Assembly on 6 March 1919 that, in the words of one historian, &quot;greatly modified and liberalized the code of military justice&quot;, bringing it into the realm of social policy. In February 1919, as a concession to the mass movement in the Ruhr, labor minister Gustav Bauer decreed setting up workers&#x27; councils for the mining industry, thus beginning a political struggle for representation of workers&#x27; councils on boards of directors. On 18 March 1919 a regulation issued by the Demobilization Office introduced the eight-hour working day for office employees, while a government declaration from the same month accepted workers&#x27; committees &quot;as official representatives of the economy&quot;.

In foreign policy, the decision on whether to accept or reject the Treaty of Versailles fell during Scheidemann&#x27;s term of office. He had spoken out clearly against signing it. When the Weimar National Assembly met in Berlin for the first time on 12 May 1919, he said, &quot;What hand should not wither that puts this fetter on itself and on us?&quot; At first the majority not only of the population but also in political circles seemed to be behind the rejection, and Scheidemann&#x27;s remark became a popular saying. Political realists such as Matthias Erzberger of the Centre Party, Gustav Noske, and Eduard David drew attention to the fact that a rejection would threaten the occupation of all of Germany by the Allies. The still existing Supreme Army Command also urged acceptance of the treaty, as did Reich President Ebert. In addition, the majority of his own parliamentary group was in favor of acceptance. Since no agreement could be reached between the governmental parties and no unified position in the cabinet could be reached – several ministers were clearly against the acceptance of the treaty – Scheidemann saw no possibility except resigning.

=== Political life after 1919 ===
In the elections of 6 June 1920, Scheidemann was re-elected to the Reichstag, this time for Hesse-Nassau. From 1920 to 1925 he was also mayor of Kassel. He remained a member of the Reichstag until 1933. For many years he was also a member of the SPD parliamentary party executive. He made frequent appearances outside of parliament, especially after leaving his post as mayor of Kassel in 1925. In 1921, as one of the keynote speakers at the MSPD&#x27;s Görlitz Party Congress, he called on his party to declare safeguarding the Republic its foremost concern: &quot;We will not be surpassed by anyone in love for our fatherland and for our people.&quot; Later he became one of the most sought-after speakers at events of the SPD-affiliated Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold (&quot;Reich Banner&quot; &quot;Black, Red, Gold&quot;), to whose Reich committee he belonged.

After leaving the government, Scheidemann increasingly became the spokesman for those in his party who were dissatisfied with the actions of its representatives and government officials. He became one of the most outspoken advocates of the resolution adopted in 1919 at the Weimar Party Congress of the MSPD which emphasized the party&#x27;s unrestricted independence with respect to the government and the government representatives it appointed. Based on it, Scheidemann took the position that, in cases of tension between government action on the one hand and party&#x27;s political line and basic direction on the other, the latter should be given preference. He thought that loyalty to one&#x27;s own government representatives had its limits where fundamental principles of the party and elementary interests of the people were violated.

In November 1923 Scheidemann admitted in a newspaper article in the that the course he had followed a year earlier, which had led to the end of Joseph Wirth&#x27;s (Centre Party) second government, had been a grave and irreparable mistake. At that time, in deference to the former USPD members who had just returned to the mother party, they had refused any cooperation with the right-liberal German People&#x27;s Party (DVP), which had ultimately brought the non-partisan Wilhelm Cuno, who was close to the DVP, into the government as Reich chancellor.

In April 1921 Scheidemann called on Reich President Friedrich Ebert to resign because his office compelled him to use his Social Democratic name in support of the center-right minority government formed after the MSPD withdrew following its loss of 62 seats in the 1920 election. Scheidemann&#x27;s call had been preceded by many expressions of displeasure from within the party against Ebert because he had not resisted the request of Centre Party Chancellor Constantin Fehrenbach&#x27;s center-right government to invoke Emergency Article 48 of the Reich Constitution. It had allowed the government to bypass parliament and impose restrictions on the right to strike (November 1920) and to introduce special courts to suppress the communist-led March Action uprising (1921) in central Germany. Scheidemann&#x27;s call had been immediately preceded by the adoption, approved by Ebert, of the flag ordinance introduced by the Fehrenbach government. It used symbols of the empire to a far greater extent than had originally been provided for in the constitution and could therefore be understood as a signal directed against the Republic. Ebert did not heed Scheidemann&#x27;s request to resign.

During his tenure in the Reichstag, Scheidemann wrote political treatises that were widely read and in parliament made several speeches that had significant consequences. After the Kapp Putsch in 1920, he sharply attacked his party colleague Gustav Noske in the National Assembly, which had fled to Stuttgart due to the putsch, although he did not explicitly mention his name. Scheidemann held the Reichswehr minister partly responsible for the coup attempt, saying that the democratization of the military had been neglected. He demanded a thorough purge of the troops, the disarmament of all mutineers, and the dismissal of all officers who were not loyal to the republic. Noske was eventually forced to resign.

In 1926 Scheidemann revealed in the Reichstag the illegal collaboration between the Reichswehr and the Soviet Army in an attempt to rebuild the German armed forces beyond the limitations of the Versailles Treaty. The revelation led to the fall of the third government of Wilhelm Marx (Centre Party).

=== Mayor of Kassel ===

Scheidemann was elected Mayor of Kassel on 19 December 1919, succeeding Erich Koch-Weser. He held office until 1925. From the beginning of his term he had to defend himself against accusations from the bourgeois parties in Kassel who said that a craftsman&#x27;s son did not have the qualifications for the office and accused him of neglecting his tasks in Kassel because of his Reichstag mandate. Similar criticism eventually came from the SPD. In Kassel&#x27;s municipal elections on 4 May 1924, the SPD suffered a serious defeat which gave the bourgeois parties a majority in the city parliament. A motion of no confidence against Scheidemann passed, but it was not legally binding. The conflict continued until the district president finally intervened. As a result of his mediation, Scheidemann left office on 1 October 1925. After that he concentrated on his Reichstag duties. He also wrote a number of books, including his autobiography in two volumes, &quot;Memoirs of a Social Democrat&quot; (1928).

=== Scheidemann as embodiment of the enemy to the Republic&#x27;s opponents ===
Scheidemann was an embodiment of the &quot;Weimar system&quot; for both the extreme right and left. Taking advantage of the ambiguity of his surname, the term &quot;Scheidemann&quot; was used as an invective against supporters of the Republic (&#x27;Scheide&#x27; can mean either &#x27;scabbard&#x27; or &#x27;vagina&#x27;). After such usage had become common among militaristic-nationalist circles during the World War, the Spartacus League used it with an appeal to the workers and soldiers of Berlin on 10 November 1918, when socialists in the government were defamed as &quot;Scheidemänner&quot; (&#x27;Scheide men&#x27;) who had &quot;hounded&quot; the working class into war.

On Whit Sunday, 4 June 1922, while Scheidemann was mayor of Kassel, an attempt was made on his life. During a walk with his daughter, Hans Hustert (who would later be an SS adjutant to Heinrich Himmler) and Karl Oehlschläger sprayed him in the face with prussic acid. The third man who took part in the assassination attempt is said to have been Erwin Kern, one of the men who murdered Foreign Minister Walther Rathenau three weeks later. Scheidemann survived the assassination attempt because strong winds prevented the perpetrators from spraying him so that the poison entered his mouth and nose. Later, after Scheidemann received repeated death threats and his house was smeared with swastikas, he always carried a pistol on walks to defend himself against attackers. The assassination attempt against him was part of a series of political murders that included among others Matthias Erzberger, one of the signers of the Armistice of 11 November 1918, and Walther Rathenau. The perpetrators were members of the Organisation Consul (the group mainly responsible for the murder series), the Deutschvölkischer Schutz- und Trutzbund (German Nationalist Federation for Protection and Defense), the Freikorps Ehrhardt Brigade and the Iron Division. The men who attacked Scheidemann were caught the same year and sentenced to long prison terms.

=== Life in exile ===
After the Nazis seized power on 30 January 1933, Scheidemann, whom the far right had for years denounced as a leading November criminal, was in grave danger. A few days after the Reichstag fire on 27 February 1933, he fled to Salzburg, Austria, where Austrian National Council member Josef Witternigg took him in. Scheidemann&#x27;s extensive records of his political activity, including 26 volumes of diary notes from 1914 to 1919, remained behind in Germany, where they were confiscated by the political police. They are now considered to have been lost.
After stays in Czechoslovakia, Switzerland, France and the United States, Scheidemann arrived in Denmark in 1935. The German Reich&#x27;s first expatriation list, published on 25 August 1933, deprived him of his German citizenship. Although his health was deteriorating, he observed the developments in Germany closely and published articles in the Danish working-class press under a pseudonym.

Philipp Scheidemann died in Copenhagen on 29 November 1939. In 1953 the city of Copenhagen had his ashes transferred to Kassel. His grave is located in the old section of Kassel&#x27;s main cemetery and is preserved as a grave of honor by the city. Scheidemann&#x27;s own wish had been to be buried in Berlin alongside his wife Johanna, who died in August 1926.

== Writings in exile ==
In the last years of his life, Scheidemann produced a number of manuscripts in which he attempted to critically examine various aspects of Social Democratic politics between 1918 and 1933. In 1940, after the German occupation of Denmark, Scheidemann&#x27;s daughter Louise buried the papers near Copenhagen. She was able to recover them in 1945 and in 1947 gave the SPD executive committee some copies for inspection. In February 1948 the deputy party chairman Erich Ollenhauer advised her in writing that it was for the time being not &quot;in the interest of the party&quot; to publish the material &quot;in which your father is in part very critical of the official policy of the party in the Weimar Republic.&quot; Publication did not take place until 2002.

In his writings, Scheidemann accused Friedrich Ebert in particular of having &quot;ruined&quot; the SPD through serious political missteps. He described Ebert as a calculating lone wolf who hardly ever explained himself, who was a &quot;master in organizational and tactical issues,&quot; and who usually avoided direct confrontation and discussion in the official committees but always understood how to get his way through parallel informal consultations with different interest groups. Such maneuvering had enabled Ebert, for example, to secure the Reich presidency in February 1919, even though the majority of the SPD parliamentary group had initially wanted to nominate Scheidemann after word got out that Ebert had reacted to Scheidemann&#x27;s proclamation of the Republic on 9 November 1918 with an outburst of rage. Scheidemann stated that he soon &quot;bitterly regretted&quot; his withdrawal from the party leadership in the fall of 1919 and his departure for Kassel. The &quot;struggle against the policies led by Ebert would have had to be fought out then, by hook or by crook, because the impending disaster was already palpable.&quot; Scheidemann was similarly harsh in his judgment of the behavior of the leading groups of the SPD and the General German Trade Union Federation in the summer of 1932 and spring of 1933, saying that the attitude of the trade union leaders in particular was &quot;appallingly pathetic&quot; and that their attempts to &quot;find a modus vivendi with Hitler&quot; were &quot;unparalleled in the history of the international labor movement&quot;. Scheidemann demanded of the SPD executive committee in exile that self-criticism not be limited to the years 1918 and 1919; what was required was &quot;at least a few lines about the fifteen years that lie behind us, but at a minimum about 20 July 1932&quot; – the date of 1932 Prussian coup d&#x27;état, when Reich President Paul von Hindenburg invoked an emergency clause of the Weimar constitution to replace the elected government of the state of Prussia with Franz von Papen as Reich Commissioner. Scheidemann himself, like many other Social Democrats, had counted on the call for a general strike in July 1932 and February 1933, partly because &quot;influential comrades&quot; had repeatedly assured him that &quot;the button would be pressed&quot; at the decisive moment. He had &quot;believed in the Berlin slogan because I considered a complete failure of the leadership, in which, admittedly, I had not had great confidence for years, to be impossible&quot;.

<text>Gustav Adolf Bauer (; 6 January 1870 – 16 September 1944) was a German Social Democratic Party leader and the chancellor of Germany from June 1919 to March 1920. Prior to that, he was minister of labour in the last cabinet of the German Empire and during most of the German Revolution that preceded the formal establishment of the Weimar Republic.

Bauer became minister president of the Weimar National Assembly in June 1919 after Philipp Scheidemann resigned in protest against the Treaty of Versailles. Following the adoption of the Weimar Constitution in August 1919, Bauer&#x27;s title formally changed to &quot;chancellor&quot;. During his term of office, a crucial tax restructuring was enacted, as were a series of important social reforms that affected unemployment relief, maternity benefits and health and old age insurance. 

After his cabinet fell in March 1920 as a result of its response to the Kapp Putsch, Bauer served as vice-chancellor, minister of the treasury, and minister of transportation in other cabinets from May 1920 to November 1922. In 1925 he was forced to resign his seat in the Reichstag due to his involvement in the fraud and bribery of the Barmat scandal. He was allowed to resume his seat in 1926. He kept it until 1928 when he retired from public life.

==Early life==
Bauer was born on 6 January 1870 in Darkehmen, near Königsberg in the Province of Prussia (now Ozyorsk, Kaliningrad Oblast, Russia) as the son of court bailiff Gustav Bauer and his wife Henriette (née Gross). From 1876 to 1884, he attended primary school in Königsberg. After 1884, he worked as an office assistant and then as head clerk for a lawyer at Königsberg.

In 1895, he became president of the Union of Office Employees of Germany, a white-collar union that he co-founded. He also was editor of the publication (&quot;The Office Worker&quot;) and in 1903 was named head of the Central Labour Secretariat of the Free Trade Unions in Berlin. In 1908, Bauer became second chairman of the General Commission of Trade Unions in Berlin, a position he held until 1918.

On 2 October 1911, Bauer married Hedwig Moch.

==Political career==
===Imperial Germany and revolutionary period===
In 1912, Bauer was elected to the Reichstag for the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) in a constituency of Breslau in the Prussian province of Silesia. In October 1918, he became state secretary (similar to a minister) in the Ministry of Labour in the cabinet of Max von Baden, a position he remained in throughout the Revolution of 1918/19. After Baden resigned on 9 November 1918, Bauer continued to serve under Chancellor Friedrich Ebert (SPD) and then under the Council of the People&#x27;s Deputies, also headed by Ebert, which replaced the imperial chancellorship. 

On 12 November the Council issued an appeal &quot;To the German People&quot; that included a number of promises related to labour, notably the introduction of the eight-hour workday and the creation and protection of jobs. In the following weeks, the Council issued decrees regulating the hiring, dismissal and pay of industrial workers, including war invalids and demobilised military personnel. In the Stinnes–Legien Agreement of 15 November, industry agreed to introduce the eight-hour workday, guarantee demobilised workers the right to their pre-war jobs and recognise trade unions as the sole representatives of the workers.

===Weimar Republic===
==== Chancellor ====
 In January 1919, Bauer was elected to the Weimar National Assembly for Magdeburg in Prussian Saxony. In February, he became minister of labour in Philipp Scheidemann&#x27;s cabinet, Germany&#x27;s first democratically elected national government. After Scheidemann resigned on 20 June 1919 in protest against the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, both Eduard David and Hermann Müller of the Social Democrats refused the offer to succeed him as minister president. Bauer accepted the position on 20 June even though he had until then been a vocal critic of the Treaty. Part of his willingness to take on the difficult responsibility of getting the Treaty through the Assembly came from his personal friendship with Friedrich Ebert and part from a sense of duty: &quot;We are not standing here out of the interest of our parties, and even less – believe me – out of ambition. We are standing here out of a feeling of responsibility, in the awareness that it is our damned duty to save what can be saved.&quot; The National Assembly approved the Treaty 237 to 138 on 23 June, and representatives of Bauer&#x27;s government signed it on 28 June.

On 31 July, the Assembly passed the proposal for the Weimar Constitution that it had drawn up and debated. President Ebert signed it on 11 August, and when it came into force on 14 August, Bauer&#x27;s position took the name &quot;chancellor&quot;. The National Assembly dissolved itself on 21 May 1920. After the Reichstag election on 6 June 1920, the Republic&#x27;s first Reichstag took its place. 

Some of the most far-reaching changes implemented during Bauer&#x27;s term of office were the tax reform packages developed by Finance Minister Matthias Erzberger. The Reich Revenue Law of July 1919 gave the federal government sole authority for levying and administering taxes, unlike under the Empire when the states had control. The result was a considerable strengthening of the Reich&#x27;s position with respect to the constituent states. Erzberger&#x27;s measures also attempted to shift the burden of taxes more towards wealthier citizens. They levied &quot;war taxes&quot; on income and wealth, imposed an inheritance tax in July 1919 and a one-time wealth tax in December 1919. 

The Bauer cabinet was also responsible for a number of extensions of social benefits. They included maternity care covering the costs of childbirth and confinement, youth welfare, increased unemployment relief (a form of welfare not to be confused with unemployment insurance, which was not introduced in Germany until 1927) and expanded health and old age insurance. In addition, the Factory Council Act of February 1920 established works councils at workplaces with 20 or more employees as a means of improving lines of communication between labour and management.

In March 1920, the participants in the Kapp Putsch attempted to depose the government in Berlin. Bauer, along with other SPD members of the cabinet and President Ebert, signed a call for a general strike against the putsch. After a &quot;Freikorps&quot; unit took control of the government buildings in Berlin and Wolfgang Kapp set himself up as head of a new government, most of the cabinet left the city for Dresden and then Stuttgart. Some ministers, led by Vice-Chancellor Eugen Schiffer, remained in the capital and negotiated with the putschists. The putsch quickly collapsed due to the general strike and the refusal of government employees to do their work, but the Bauer government was forced to resign on 27 March, mostly as a result of the negotiations conducted with Kapp and his fellow conspirators. Bauer was succeeded as chancellor by Hermann Müller of the SPD.

==== Post-chancellorship ====
Bauer joined the new cabinet as minister of the treasury, a position he held until June 1920; from May to June 1920, he was also minister of transportation. In the Reichstag elections of June 1920, he was re-elected to parliament, but the new government that Constantin Fehrenbach (Centre Party) formed on 25 June did not include the SPD, whose share of the vote had dropped from 38% in 1919 to 22%.

Bauer rejoined the government in the cabinet of Joseph Wirth (Centre Party) in May 1921 as minister of the treasury and vice-chancellor. He held the positions throughout Wirth&#x27;s term of office (until November 1922). Bauer remained a member of the Reichstag for Magdeburg and retained his seat after leaving the government. 

In November 1924 he became involved in the Barmat scandal, which involved accusations of corruption, war profiteering, fraud and bribery against the SPD due to its alleged involvement with the merchant Julius Barmat. Bauer was accused of taking commissions from Barmat, a claim he consistently denied in spite of strong evidence against him. On 7 February 1925, the SPD parliamentary group forced him to relinquish his seat in the Reichstag. On 14 February he was expelled from the party.

The expulsion was overturned on 14 May 1926. He returned to the Reichstag, retaining his seat until 1928, at which point he left parliament and retired from public life.

==Later life==
Five months after the Nazi Party took power, Bauer was arrested (29 June 1933) for supposedly having misappropriated public funds. The charge was based on statements allegedly made in school by his son. When it was ascertained that Bauer&#x27;s marriage was childless, he was released after a week in custody. The proceedings against him were not dismissed until 1935.

Bauer died in Hermsdorf (Berlin Reinickendorf) on 16 September 1944.

<doc id="320006" wikidata="Q218077" url="?curid=320006" title="Avro Canada C102 Jetliner">
<text>The Avro Canada C102 Jetliner was a Canadian prototype medium-range turbojet-powered jet airliner built by Avro Canada in 1949. It was beaten to the air by only 13 days by the de Havilland Comet, thereby becoming the second purpose-built jet airliner in the world, while both were preceded by the Nene Lancastrian, and the Nene Viking, both of which were conversions of piston engine airliners. The name &quot;Jetliner&quot; was chosen as a shortening of the term &quot;jet airliner&quot;, a term which is still in popular usage. The aircraft was considered suitable for busy routes along the US eastern seaboard and garnered intense interest, notably from Howard Hughes who even offered to start production under license. However, continued delays in Avro Canada&#x27;s all-weather interceptor project, the CF-100 Canuck, led to an order to stop working on the project in 1951, with the prototype Jetliner later cut up for scrap.

==Design and development==
===Genesis===

In 1945, Trans-Canada Airlines (TCA) started exploring a number of aircraft developments under the direction of Jim Bain, at that time superintendent of engineering and maintenance. Avro of England, which had recently taken over the Victory Aircraft &quot;shadow factory&quot; in Toronto, jointly with TCA, came up with a layout for an aircraft powered by four Armstrong-Siddeley turboprop engines later known as the Armstrong Siddeley Mamba. This Mamba engine arrangement was used about the same time for the unsuccessful British Armstrong Whitworth Apollo airliner. In the fall of 1945, Bain travelled to England to visit various aircraft companies and Rolls-Royce, where Ernest Hives, head of the Rolls-Royce Aero Engine, convinced him the AJ65, a new axial-flow turbojet engine later called the Avon, was the right engine for his new aircraft. On his return to Canada Bain insisted a twin-engined aircraft powered by these engines was the only arrangement acceptable to TCA.

Over the next few months, the teams at TCA and Avro refined the requirements, which were signed off on 9 April 1946. They called for a 36-seat aircraft with a cruising speed of , a range of , an average distance between stops of and a longest single flight of . The difference between the range and maximum airport distances was to allow for the required 45 minutes stacking and diversion to a 120-mile (190-km)-distant alternate airport in a headwind. The aircraft also needed to be able to operate from existing runways. Load was 12,700 lbs and 50 passengers.

The agreement also specified a number of contractual terms that, in retrospect, appear especially odd. In spite of TCA&#x27;s experience with contracting for the Ministry of Transport, and Bain&#x27;s personal arguments that cost-plus contracts be used as a ward against budget overruns, TCA&#x27;s contract with Avro demanded fixed prices for the entire development, as well as a fixed price for the aircraft of C$350,000. Additionally, Avro was not allowed to sell the aircraft to any other airline for three years. After that period, if a buyer paid less than C$350,000 for the aircraft, Avro would have to pay the difference to TCA. Furthermore, during the testing period of one year after the first aircraft was introduced, Avro would have to pay all costs, even if paying passengers were carried. Jack Dyment, chief of TCA&#x27;s entire engineering department, suggested that Avro pay for the testing so that it would &quot;permit us to learn how to successfully operate a jet aircraft without having to pay for such experience the hard way.&quot;

===Design changes===
In 1947, Fred Smye, president of Avro, advised Herbert James Symington of TCA that they could not meet the fixed price contract. Symington&#x27;s response was to pull out of the project. C. D. Howe stepped in and offered $1.5 million to continue the project, at a slower pace. At about the same time, Rolls-Royce told Avro that the civil certification of the Avon could not be guaranteed in time for the Jetliner&#x27;s rollout. This, in turn, would lead to higher operational and maintenance costs. Nevertheless, Avro continued with its plan to build the jet, selecting four Rolls-Royce Derwents to replace the two Avons.

Chief Designer James C. Floyd was upset by these developments, but in the end found a number of advantages to the four-engine layout. The main advantage was that in an engine-out situation, the aircraft would lose only a quarter of its thrust, rather than half. In particular, the asymmetry in thrust originally called for a powered rudder to correct for yaw in the case of an engine failure, but with four engines it was found yaw was so small it could be corrected easily with just the manual trim controls.

Although bearing some resemblance to the jet-powered Avro Tudor 8 and 9 (the former flying on jet power in 1948 and the latter becoming the experimental Avro Ashton first flying in 1950), Floyd&#x27;s design was conceived from the outset as a commercial jet airliner. The updated design was presented in October 1948, and in February 1948 TCA responded with changes of their own. Now they wanted the aircraft to cruise at , and they increased the fuel requirements to allow for wider diversions. In April, Gordon McGregor took over the presidency of TCA, and told Smye that he did not want it to be the first airline with a jet. Nevertheless, the project pressed on, and was the topic of a major article in &quot;Aviation Week&quot; in November.

The aircraft was scheduled to begin deliveries in May 1952, and enter service in October, which would have given it a full six years headstart on the 707, which did not enter service until October 1958, and more than 11 years on its top short-field competitor, the Boeing 727. Its short-field performance exceeded the Caravelles (with a comparable number of passengers).

Proposals exist for 30-, 40-, and 50-seat models, as well as 52- and 64-seat paratroop versions, high-altitude medical lab, photo reconnaissance, cargo, and crew trainer types.

==Operational history==
Two years later, the first prototype, CF-EJD (-X), began taxiing tests, and first flew on 10 August 1949, only 25 months after the design had started, and only 13 days after the first flight of the DH Comet. Delays to the first flight were caused by many burst tires as the anti-skid braking system had not yet been fitted for the high-speed taxi trials which included braking tests and steering control checks. These high speed runs had to be done on a shorter runway than had been planned as the Department of Transport had taken the longer runway out of service for rework at the last minute. On its second flight, on 16 August, the landing gear failed to extend, and the Jetliner had to make a belly landing. However, the damage was minor, and the aircraft was in the air again in three weeks.

During its first inspection in November the servo rudder was removed as unnecessary but the servo elevators were retained for dealing with extreme centre-of-gravity positions.

On April 18, 1950, the Jetliner carried the world&#x27;s first jet airmail from Malton Airport in Toronto (renamed as Toronto Pearson International Airport) to New York City&#x27;s Idlewild Airport (later renamed as John F. Kennedy International Airport) in 59 minutes– half the previous record (c. 340 miles, 352 mph). The flight was highly publicized and the crew was welcomed with a ticker tape parade through the streets of Manhattan. So new was the concept of jet power that the Jetliner was made to park far from the terminal, and pans were placed under the engines in case they dripped any &quot;self-igniting fuel.&quot; On its return the next day, the Jetliner returned to Canada via Montreal.

At the time, in the mid-1950s, the Cold War was starting and the Canadian authorities were in the midst of expanding the military. Avro was involved in designing the first dedicated jet-powered, all-weather fighter for the RCAF, the Avro Canada CF-100 Canuck. The project was somewhat delayed, although the company&#x27;s continuing work on the Jetliner caused some controversy. After the prototype returned, it still had no immediate sales prospects, and C.D. Howe (the &quot;minister of everything&quot;) therefore ordered the program stopped in December 1951. The second prototype Jetliner, nearly completed in the main assembly hangar, was broken up at that time.

Nevertheless, only a few months later, the enigmatic Howard Hughes first learned of the design and leased the Jetliner prototype for testing, flying it for a few circuits when it arrived in Culver City, California. He tried to buy 30 Jetliners for use by TWA, but Avro had to repeatedly turn him down due to limited manufacturing capabilities and overwork on the CF-100 project. Hughes then started looking at US companies to build it for him; Convair proved interested and started studies on gearing up a production line. C.D. Howe again stepped in and insisted that Avro concentrate on its Orenda turbojet and CF-100 jet fighter programs. Furthermore, the U.S. government decided that Convair&#x27;s military commitments had priority for facilities over any additional civil projects.

The project was almost restarted in 1953, when CF-100 production was in full swing, but this never happened. In 1955, TCA ordered 51 Vickers Viscount turboprop aircraft from Vickers-Armstrong in England. These were the first turbine-powered aircraft in regular service in North America. They continued in service until 1974.

===Cancellation===
The Jetliner was later used for taking in-flight photographs of CF-100 development trials such as canopy jettison and rocket firing. On 10 December 1956, the Jetliner was grounded and ordered not to fly again. It was donated to the National Research Council but they had no room to store it and took only the nose section for cockpit layout design. The rest of the Jetliner was cut up on 13 December 1956. The only surviving parts are the nose and cockpit section in the Canada Aviation and Space Museum in Ottawa, Ontario.

===Legacy===

Canada Post issued a stamp to commemorate the development of the Jetliner. Jetliner Road in Mississauga, Ontario is named for the airliner at Toronto Pearson International Airport. The &quot;Avro Jetliner Private&quot; street name also commemorates the aircraft at Ottawa Macdonald–Cartier International Airport.

<doc id="320007" wikidata="Q57158" url="?curid=320007" title="Hermann Müller (politician, born 1876)">
<text>Hermann Müller (18 May 1876 – 20 March 1931; ) was a German Social Democratic politician who served as foreign minister (1919–1920) and was twice chancellor of Germany (1920, 1928–1930) during the Weimar Republic. 

Müller rose quickly through the ranks of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) after joining it in 1893. He was elected to the Reichstag of the German Empire in 1916 and to the Weimar National Assembly in 1919. In his capacity as foreign minister, he was one of the German signatories of the Treaty of Versailles (28 June 1919). 

During the three months Müller was chancellor in 1920, his government passed a number of progressive social reforms before it had to resign due to the SPD&#x27;s poor showing in the 1920 election. In his second term as chancellor, from June 1928 to 1930, he led a grand coalition through a period marked by budgetary and international relations issues. The coalition broke apart after the onset of the Great Depression, and Müller, already suffering from poor health, died a year after leaving office. 

==Early life==
Hermann Müller was born on 18 May 1876 in Mannheim in the Grand Duchy of Baden, the son of Georg Jakob Müller (born 1843), a producer of sparkling wine and wine dealer from Güdingen near Saarbrücken, and his wife Karoline (née Vogt, born 1849, died after 1931), originally from Frankfurt am Main. Müller attended grammar school at Mannheim and, after his father moved to Niederlößnitz in 1888, at Dresden. After his father died in 1892, Müller had to leave school due to financial difficulties and began an apprenticeship at Frankfurt. He worked in Frankfurt and Breslau, and in 1893 joined the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). Heavily influenced by his father&#x27;s interest in the philosophy of the critic of Christianity Ludwig Feuerbach, Hermann Müller was the only German chancellor who was not a member of any religion.

==Political career==

===Before 1918: entry into the SPD and Reichstag===

From 1899 to 1906, Müller worked as an editor at the socialist newspaper . He was a member of the Görlitz city council from 1903 to 1906 and party functionary (). August Bebel, the SPD chairman, nominated him in 1905 (without success) and 1906 (successfully) for membership of the board of the national SPD. At that time, Müller changed from a left-wing Social Democrat to a centrist, who argued against both the Marxist reformists such as Eduard Bernstein and the radical Left around Rosa Luxemburg. Together with Friedrich Ebert, Müller in 1909 created a party executive committee that was to deal with internal arguments between party conventions. Known for his calm, industriousness, integrity and rationality, Müller lacked charisma. In 1909 he tried but failed to prevent Otto Braun&#x27;s election to the board, laying the foundation for a long-running animosity between the two.

As a result of his foreign language skills, Müller was the representative of the SPD at the Second International, an organisation of socialist and labour parties, and at the conventions of socialist parties in other countries in western Europe. In late July 1914, during the July Crisis that led up to the outbreak of World War I, Müller was sent to Paris to negotiate with French socialists over a common stance towards the respective countries&#x27; proposals for war loans. No agreement was reached, however, and before Müller was able to report back, the SPD had already decided to support the first war loans in the Reichstag in the belief, fostered by the German government, that the war was purely defensive.

During World War I, Müller supported the political truce between Germany&#x27;s political parties known as the &quot;Burgfrieden&quot;. He was used by the SPD leadership to deal with arguments with the party&#x27;s left wing and as an in-house censor for the party newspaper &quot;Vorwärts&quot; to avoid its outright ban by the military authorities. After he was elected to the Reichstag in a 1916 by-election, he supported both the harsh Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with Russia and the entry of the SPD into the government of Max von Baden in October 1918. Baden was named chancellor after the army leadership decided that it could get better peace terms from the Allies and deflect the blame from itself for the lost war if the government were democratised and the socialists – whom they blamed for the loss – brought into it.

===1918 to 1919: revolution and National Assembly ===
During the German Revolution of 1918–1919, Müller was a member of the Greater Berlin Executive Council of Workers and Soldiers () where he represented the position of the SPD leadership arguing in favor of elections to a constituent national assembly instead of the creation of a council republic as the more radical members of the Council wanted. He later published a book on his experience during the revolution.

In January 1919, Müller was elected to the Weimar National Assembly, which was to be Germany&#x27;s interim parliament and draft a new constitution. In February, the Assembly elected Friedrich Ebert president of Germany and appointed Philipp Scheidemann as minister president (head of government). The two men had been the joint chairmen of the SPD, and Müller and Otto Wels were elected as their replacements with 373 and 291 out of 376 votes, respectively. Wels focused on internal leadership and organization, whilst Müller was the external representative of the party. In 1919 and 1920–28, Müller was also parliamentary party leader first in the Weimar National Assembly and then the Reichstag of the Weimar Republic. He was chosen chairman of the Reichstag&#x27;s Committee on Foreign Affairs. In 1920, he won a seat in the Reichstag for Franconia (&quot;Franken&quot; in German) and changed his name to Müller-Franken to distinguish himself from other members named Müller.

=== 1920: first chancellorship ===
After Scheidemann resigned in June 1919 because he could not accept the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, Müller was asked to succeed him as head of government but declined. Under the new Reich Minister President and later Chancellor Gustav Bauer, Müller became foreign minister on 21 June 1919. In that capacity, he went to Versailles and with Colonial Minister Johannes Bell signed the Treaty of Versailles for Germany on 29 June 1919.

After the resignation of the Bauer cabinet, which followed the Kapp-Lüttwitz Putsch in March 1920, Müller accepted Ebert&#x27;s offer of becoming chancellor and formed a new government that was a continuation of the Weimar Coalition made up of the SPD, German Democratic Party (DDP) and Centre Party. Under his leadership, the government suppressed the left-wing insurgencies such as the Ruhr uprising and urged the disarmament of the paramilitary &quot;Einwohnerwehren&quot; (Citizens&#x27; Defence) demanded by the Allies. The newly created second commission on socialization, which was tasked to examine ways of socialising parts of the German economy, admitted some members from the left-wing USPD because Müller felt that it was the only way workers would be willing to accept the commission&#x27;s decisions. In social policy, Müller&#x27;s time as chancellor saw the passage of a number of progressive social reforms. A comprehensive war-disability system was established in May 1920, while the Law on the Employment of the Disabled of April 1920 stipulated that all public and private employers with more than 20 employees were obligated to hire Germans disabled by accident or war and with at least a 50% reduction in their ability to work. The Basic School Law (passed on 28 April 1920) introduced a common four-year course in primary schools for all German children. Benefits for the unemployed were improved, with the maximum benefit for single males over the age of 21 increasing from 5 to 8 marks in May 1920. Maximum wage scales that were established in April 1919 were also increased.

On 29 March 1920 the Reichstag passed a Reich income-tax law, together with a law on corporate tax and a capital-yield tax. The Salary Reform Act, passed in April 1920, greatly improved the pay of civil servants. In May 1920, the Reich Office for Labour Allocation was set up as the first Reich-wide institution &quot;to allocate labor, administer unemployment insurance and generally manage labor concerns&quot;. The Reich Insurance Code of May 1920 provided war-wounded persons and dependent survivors with therapeutic treatment and social welfare with the objective of reintegrating handicapped persons into working life. The Cripples&#x27; Welfare Act, passed that same month, made it a duty of the public welfare system to assist cripples under the age of 18 to obtain the capacity to earn an income. The Reich Homestead Act, passed in May 1920, sought to encourage homesteading as a means of helping economically vulnerable groups. The Reich Tenant Protection Order of 9 June 1920 sought to check evictions and &quot;an immoderate increase of rental rates&quot;, authorising the states to set up tenancy offices made up of tenants&#x27; and owners&#x27; representatives, with a judge as chairman to settle disputes concerning rents. As noted by Frieda Wunderlich, they were entitled &quot;to supervise the fixing of rents for all farms&quot;. During Müller&#x27;s last year in office, a number of orders were introduced that &quot;confirmed and defined the protective measures taken in connection with the employment of women in certain work of a particularly dangerous or arduous nature&quot;, which included glass-works, rolling mills, and iron foundries (through orders of 26 March 1930).

Müller was chancellor only until June 1920, when the outcome of the first regular election to the Reichstag resulted in the formation of a new government led by Constantin Fehrenbach of the Centre Party. The SPD suffered a significant defeat at the polls, with the number of people voting for them dropping almost by half compared to the January 1919 election. Discouraged, Müller only half-heartedly negotiated with the USPD about a coalition. He was turned down because the USPD was unwilling to join any coalition including non-socialist parties and one in which the USPD was not the majority party. On the other side of the political spectrum, Müller was opposed to working with Gustav Stresemann&#x27;s German People&#x27;s Party (DVP), considering them a mouthpiece for corporate interests and doubting their loyalty to the republican constitution.

===1920 to 1928: SPD in opposition and coalitions===

The SPD now was in the opposition regarding the domestic agenda of the new government while supporting its foreign policy, in particular regarding reparations to the Allies. Müller was an early advocate of joining the League of Nations and of moving politically closer to the West. He was critical of the Soviet Union&#x27;s authoritarian system of government, its revolutionary goals and its support for the radical left in Germany. However, he opposed a blockade of the Soviet Union by the western Allies.

Initially, Müller favoured diplomatic relations with the Soviets only as far as they would help in preventing the integration of Upper Silesia into the new Polish state. He viewed the Treaty of Rapallo (1922) with the Soviets as a true peace treaty, but one that only had meaning within the context of a successful diplomatic policy towards the western powers, not as an alternative to it. Müller warned against attaching too much hope to the potential economic gains from the treaty, arguing that only the United States would be in a position to provide effective aid for the economic reconstruction of post-World War I Europe.

During the two governments led by Joseph Wirth (Centre Party) in 1921/22 and in which the SPD participated as part of another Weimar Coalition, Müller demanded as parliamentary leader of the SPD that budget consolidation involve first and foremost higher taxation of wealth rather than of consumption. This led to confrontations with the middle class parties. Similarly, the reunification of SPD and USPD resulted in a move to the left by the new SPD. When the SPD refused to agree to letting the DVP join the existing coalition as desired by the Centre Party and DDP, the coalition broke apart in November 1922. The SPD did not participate in the following government of Wilhelm Cuno, an independent, which lasted until August 1923.

Recognizing a national emergency when the French seized the Ruhr and inflation spiraled out of control in 1923, Müller brought the SPD into a grand coalition led by Gustav Stresemann of the DVP (August to November 1923). Differences in economic and social policies strained relations between the SPD and the other members of the coalition. Müller supported the emergency measures taken after the passage of the October 1923 enabling act, which allowed the government to enact extra-constitutional financial, economic and social measures without approval by the Reichstag. The Reich government was lenient in its handling of the right-wing leader of Bavaria, Gustav Ritter von Kahr, who was plotting a march on Berlin to overthrow the government, but it dealt harshly with the governments in Thuringia and Saxony, where the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) was brought into SPD-led governments as part of a USSR-backed plan to foment a communist revolution in Germany (the &quot;German October&quot;). The contrast in the Reich government&#x27;s responses led the SPD to leave the coalition in November 1923.

At the party convention in 1924, Müller said that the SPD&#x27;s stance towards coalitions was based less on principles than on tactics that were geared towards foreign policy. During their years in the opposition, the SPD supported a policy of reconciliation with the western powers, as exemplified by the Locarno Treaties, which settled Germany&#x27;s western borders but left the eastern ones open to revision, and by Germany&#x27;s entry to the League of Nations. 

After November 1923, the SPD did not participate in a government again until June of 1928.

===1928 to 1930: second chancellorship===
The SPD was the clear winner of the May 1928 elections (153 of 491 seats). When the fourth cabinet of Wilhelm Marx (Centre Party) resigned on 12 June over its failure to come to an agreement on a national school law, the Social Democrats put Müller forward as their candidate for chancellor. Reich President Paul von Hindenburg would have preferred DVP chairman Ernst Scholz as chancellor but was persuaded to accept Müller by his inner circle, which expected a Social Democratic chancellorship to erode SPD support in the medium term. On 12 June 1928 Hindenburg entrusted Müller with forming the government. The other parties proved reluctant to compromise, and it took a personal intervention by Gustav Stresemann for a government to be formed on 28 June 1928. Müller&#x27;s cabinet, a grand coalition of Social Democrats, Centre Party, DDP, DVP and BVP managed to settle only on a written agreement on the government&#x27;s policies in the spring of 1929. In particular, domestic policy differences between the SPD and DVP dominated the government&#x27;s work. Its continued existence was mainly due to the mutual personal esteem between Müller and Foreign Minister Stresemann, who died on 3 October 1929. Relations between the parties were strained by the arguments over construction of the pocket battleship &quot;Panzerkreuzer A&quot;, in which the SPD forced its ministers to vote against the allocation of funds to the project in the Reichstag even though they had endorsed it in cabinet meetings in order to keep the coalition intact. In addition, the Ruhr iron dispute (), the &quot;largest and longest lockout Germany had ever experienced&quot;, was a bone of contention, as the DVP voted against the Reichstag motion that approved state support for the estimated 200,000 to 260,000 locked out workers.

Financing the budget for 1929 and the external liabilities of the Reich were a huge problem, and reaching an agreement involved negotiating more lenient reparations conditions with the Allies. Müller had been the leader of the delegation to the League of Nations in the summer of 1928 where he – despite a heated argument with French Foreign Minister Aristide Briand over German rearmament – had laid the groundwork for concessions by the Allies. By January 1930, the government had succeeded in negotiating a reduction in reparation payments (the Young Plan, signed in August 1929) and a promise by the Allies to completely withdraw the occupation forces from the Rhineland by May 1930.

Meanwhile, Müller&#x27;s cabinet also had to deal with diplomatic problems with Poland over trade and the position of ethnic minorities. German-Soviet relations also reached a nadir, as the Soviet government blamed the cabinet for violence between Communist demonstrators and the police in Berlin in May 1929. At that point, the middle-class parties were looking for ways to end the coalition with the SPD. The nationalist DNVP and Nazi Party failed to stop the Young Plan, an attempt to settle Germany&#x27;s World War I reparations issues, via a referendum, and the coalition parties disagreed on the issue of funding unemployment insurance. Müller was unable to participate in the political arena for several months due to a life-threatening illness.

Although Müller was able to resume his duties in the fall of 1929, he was physically weakened and unable to control the centrifugal forces at work. The coalition finally fell apart in a disagreement about budgetary issues. After the onset of the Great Depression, the unemployment insurance system required frequent injections of taxpayer money by the Reich, but the parties could not agree on how to raise the funds. Müller was willing to accept a compromise offer by Heinrich Brüning of the Centre Party, but he was overruled by the SPD parliamentary group, which refused to make any further concessions. On the suggestion of his advisors, Reich President Hindenburg would not provide Müller&#x27;s government with the emergency powers available under Article 48 of the Weimar Constitution, forcing Müller and his cabinet to resign on 27 March 1930.

A number of progressive reforms were implemented under Müller&#x27;s last government. In 1928, nationwide state-controlled unemployment insurance was established, and midwives and people in the music profession became compulsorily insured under a pension scheme for non-manual workers in 1929. In February 1929, accident insurance coverage was extended to include 22 occupationally induced diseases. That same year, a special pension for unemployed persons at the age of 60 was introduced.

==Death==

After resigning as chancellor, Müller retired from public life. Following the elections in September 1930, which saw massive gains for Adolf Hitler&#x27;s NSDAP, Müller called on his party to support Heinrich Brüning&#x27;s government even without being part of the coalition. His death in 1931 following a gallbladder operation was seen as a major blow to the Social Democrats. He died in Berlin and is buried there at the Zentralfriedhof Friedrichsfelde.

==Family==
In 1902, Müller married Frieda Tockus. They had one daughter, Annemarie, in 1905. Frieda died several weeks later due to complications from the pregnancy. He remarried in 1909 to Gottliebe Jaeger, and the following year their daughter Erika was born.

<doc id="320014" wikidata="Q77156" url="?curid=320014" title="Constantin Fehrenbach">
<text>Constantin Fehrenbach, sometimes erroneously Konstantin Fehrenbach, (11 January 1852 – 26 March 1926), was a German politician who was one of the major leaders of the Catholic Centre Party. He served as president of the Reichstag in 1918 and then as president of the Weimar National Assembly from 1919 to 1920. In June 1920, Fehrenbach became Chancellor of Germany. During his time in office, the central issue he had to face was German compliance with the terms of the Treaty of Versailles. He resigned in May 1921 when his cabinet was unable to reach a consensus on war reparations payments to the Allies. Fehrenbach remained in the Reichstag and headed the Centre Party&#x27;s contingent there from 1923 until his death in 1926.

Fehrenbach was considered part of the Centre Party&#x27;s left wing, which included noted politicians such as Matthias Erzberger and Joseph Wirth, as well as Catholic workers&#x27; associations and Catholic trade unions.

==Early life==
Constantin Fehrenbach was born on 11 January 1852 in Wellendingen near Bonndorf in what was then the Grand Duchy of Baden as the son of Johann Georg Fehrenbach, a teacher (1826–1895), and his wife Rosina (1832–1900), née Gensecke.

From 1865 he attended the Freiburg Boys&#x27; Seminary and the Berthold Gymnasium, from which he graduated in 1871. He began studying Catholic theology at the University of Freiburg before switching to law in 1875. During his studies, he joined a student fraternity that gave him access to circles of notables among the local bourgeoisie. In 1882 he began to practise law in Freiburg and soon became a successful criminal lawyer. In 1879, Fehrenbach married Maria (1855–1921), née Hossner at Freiburg. They had one daughter.

==Political career==

===German Empire===
Fehrenbach started his political career in 1884 when he became a member of the Freiburg city council for the Catholic Centre Party. The next year he was elected to the (state legislature) of Baden, again for the Centre Party. He resigned his seat in 1887 after disagreements with the leader of the party in Baden, over the dismantling of Otto von Bismarck&#x27;s anti-Catholic &quot;Kulturkampf&quot; laws. In 1895, Fehrenbach became (member of the city government) in Freiburg and in 1896 (district representative). In 1901 he was re-elected to the Baden and remained a member until 1913 (in 1907–1909 as president).

In 1903, Fehrenbach also became a member of the Imperial Reichstag. On 3 December 1913, he gained fame throughout Germany with a speech on the Zabern Affair, which had been triggered by popular unrest against the German military stationed in the Alsatian town of Zabern. He spoke out against the Army General Staff and delivered a strong plea in favor of a constitutional state and against the military as a state within the state.

In 1917, Fehrenbach became the chairman of the (Head Committee) of the Reichstag, which could meet when the Reichstag was adjourned and have discussions with the government on matters of foreign policy and the conduct of the war. He supported the Reichstag Peace Resolution, which called for a negotiated peace without annexations. In July 1918, Fehrenbach became the last President of the Imperial Reichstag.

===Revolution and Weimar National Assembly===
During the early days of the German Revolution of 1918–1919, Fehrenbach, a committed supporter of a constitutional monarchy, wanted to convene the Imperial Reichstag in order to preserve the monarchy, but the move was opposed by the revolutionary interim government, the Council of the People&#x27;s Deputies.

Fehrenbach was elected to the Weimar National Assembly on 19 January 1919 in Germany&#x27;s first election that gave women the right to vote. When the Assembly convened on 6 February to draft and adopt a constitution for Germany and to act as its interim parliament, Fehrenbach was elected its vice president, but since three of the highest offices were in the hands of the Social Democratic Party (SPD), the Centre Party objected. The Assembly&#x27;s president then stepped down, and Fehrenbach was elected in his place.

As President of the National Assembly, Fehrenbach had to face the difficult issue of whether Germany should accept the Treaty of Versailles. In a speech to the Reichstag on 12 May, he said, to enthusiastic agreement: &quot;We had hoped for a peace of an international alliance, of an international understanding. This is not an opening to such a peace, it is the perpetuation of war.&quot; The Assembly reluctantly approved the Treaty, and, also under Fehrenbach, debated and approved the Weimar Constitution.

=== Chancellorship ===

The 1920 Reichstag election led to the collapse of the Weimar coalition made up of the SPD, the German Democratic Party (DDP) and the Centre Party, which had formed the governments during the National Assembly. The SPD lost a significant share of the vote to its left-wing rival party, the Independent Social Democrats (USPD), leading to the formation of a middle-class minority cabinet consisting of the Centre, DDP and center-right German People&#x27;s Party (DVP). After some hesitation, Fehrenbach accepted the offer to become Chancellor. With only 168 of 469 seats (36%) in the Reichstag behind his government, it was from the beginning in a weak position to handle the difficulties it faced.

As Chancellor, Fehrenbach had to deal with the communist-led revolt known as the March Action, which was put down with considerable loss of life by government troops, and with the Third Silesian Uprising of Polish insurgents. In social policy, his government improved unemployment benefits, with the maximum amount for single males over the age of 21 increasing in November 1920 from 7 to 10 marks.

The most important task of his chancellorship was the fulfilment of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles. Fehrenbach led the German delegation at the Spa conference from 5 to 16 July 1920, where German disarmament and reparations were discussed. The total amount and the terms of reparations payments were also the subject of the conferences at Paris and London during the early months of 1921. At the first London Conference in March, Fehrenbach and his foreign minister Walter Simons protested against what they saw as the exorbitantly high total reparations payments, which had not been finalized in the Versailles Treaty. In order to put pressure on Germany to accept the reparations terms, the Entente on 5 May issued the London ultimatum, which threatened an Allied occupation of the Ruhr if Germany did not comply with the London Schedule of Payments and the Treaty of Versailles&#x27; requirements for disarmament and the extradition of German &quot;war criminals&quot;.

Before the ultimatum was issued, the American government had declined Germany&#x27;s request to act as mediator in the reparations dispute, which left Germany with few viable options. Rumors of an ultimatum had reached Fehrenbach&#x27;s cabinet a few days before 5 May, and since the DVP had already announced that it would no longer support the government&#x27;s foreign policy, the cabinet resigned on 4 May. Fehrenbach remained in charge of the caretaker government until his replacement by Joseph Wirth of the Centre Party on 10 May.

== Post-chancellorship ==
In 1922, Fehrenbach became a judge on the State Court for the German Reich (). In late 1923, Fehrenbach was elected head of the Centre Party contingent in the Reichstag, a position in which he remained until his death in 1926.

Following the assassination of Foreign Minister Walther Rathenau, who was Jewish, by the ultra-nationalist paramilitary Organisation Consul on 24 June 1922, Fehrenbach became vice-chairman of the Association for Defence against Antisemitism (&quot;&quot;). He also supported the founding in 1924 of the Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold, an unarmed, militarily structured joint organization of the SDP, DDP and Centre Party whose stated purpose was the non-violent protection of the republic from its enemies.

Fehrenbach died on 26 March 1926 in Freiburg im Breisgau.

<doc id="320017" wikidata="Q313981" url="?curid=320017" title="Robert Harris (novelist)">
<text>Robert Dennis Harris CBE (born 7 March 1957) is a British novelist and former journalist. Although he began his career in journalism and non-fiction, he is best known for his works of historical fiction. Beginning with the best-seller &quot;Fatherland&quot;, Harris focused on events surrounding the Second World War, followed by works set in ancient Rome. His most recent works are varied in settings but are mostly set after 1870.

Several of Harris&#x27;s novels have been adapted into visual media, with the most prominent being &quot;The Ghost Writer&quot; (2010) and &quot;An Officer and a Spy&quot; (2019), which he co-wrote the screenplays with director Roman Polanski, and &quot;Conclave&quot; (2024).

==Early life and education==
Robert Harris spent his childhood in a small rented house on a Nottingham council estate. His ambition to become a writer arose at an early age, from visits to the local printing plant where his father worked. Harris went to Belvoir High School in Bottesford, Leicestershire, and then King Edward VII School, Melton Mowbray, where a hall was later named after him. There he wrote plays and edited the school magazine. He lived at 17 Fleming Avenue.

Harris read English literature at Selwyn College, Cambridge, where he was elected president of the Cambridge Union and editor of &quot;Varsity&quot;, the oldest student newspaper at Cambridge University.
==Career==
===Early career===
After leaving Cambridge, Harris joined the BBC and worked on news and current affairs programmes such as &quot;Panorama&quot; and &quot;Newsnight&quot;. In 1987, at the age of 30, he became political editor of the newspaper &quot;The Observer&quot;. He later wrote regular columns for &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; and &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;.

=== Non-fiction (1982–1990) ===
Harris co-wrote his first book, &quot;A Higher Form of Killing&quot; (1982), with fellow BBC journalist Jeremy Paxman: this was a study of chemical and biological warfare. Other non-fiction works followed: &quot;Gotcha! The Government, the Media and the Falklands Crisis&quot; (1983) covering the Falklands War; &quot;The Making of Neil Kinnock&quot; (1984), a profile of Kinnock just after he became leader of the Opposition; &quot;Selling Hitler&quot; (1986), an investigation of the Hitler Diaries scandal; and &quot;Good and Faithful Servant&quot; (1990), a study of Bernard Ingham, press secretary to Margaret Thatcher while she was prime minister.

===Fiction===
====&quot;Fatherland&quot; (1992)====
Harris&#x27;s bestselling first novel, the alternative-history &quot;Fatherland&quot; (1992), has as its setting a world where Nazi Germany won the Second World War. Publication enabled Harris to become a full-time novelist. It was adapted as a television film by HBO in 1994.

Harris has stated that the proceeds from the book enabled him to buy a former vicarage in Berkshire that he jokingly dubbed &quot;the house that Hitler built&quot;, where he still lives.

====&quot;Enigma&quot; (1995)====
His second novel, &quot;Enigma&quot;, portrayed the breaking of the German Enigma cipher during the Second World War at Cambridge University and Bletchley Park. It was adapted as a film by writer Tom Stoppard, starring Dougray Scott and Kate Winslet, in 2001.

====&quot;Archangel&quot; (1998)====
&quot;Archangel&quot; was another international best seller. It follows a British historian in contemporary Russia as he hunts for a secret notebook, believed to be Stalin&#x27;s diary. It was adapted as a television film by the BBC, starring Daniel Craig, in 2005.

====&quot;Pompeii&quot; (2003)====
In 2003 Harris turned his attention to ancient Rome with &quot;Pompeii.&quot; The novel is about a Roman aqueduct engineer, working near the city of Pompeii just before the eruption of Vesuvius in 79 CE. As the aqueducts begin to malfunction, he investigates and realises the volcano is shifting the ground beneath and is near eruption. Meanwhile, he falls in love with the young daughter of a powerful local businessman who was illicitly dealing with his predecessor to divert municipal water for his own uses, and will do anything to keep that deal going.

====&quot;Imperium&quot; (2006)====
In 2006, Harris followed up on &quot;Pompeii&quot; with another Roman-era work, &quot;Imperium&quot;, the first novel in a trilogy centred on the life of the great Roman orator and lawyer Marcus Tullius Cicero.

====&quot;The Ghost&quot; (2007)====
Harris was an early and enthusiastic supporter of Tony Blair (a personal acquaintance) and a donor to New Labour, but the war in Iraq blunted his enthusiasm. &quot;We had our ups and downs, but we didn&#x27;t really fall out until the invasion of Iraq, which made no sense to me,&quot; Harris has said.

In 2007, after Blair resigned, Harris dropped his other work to write &quot;The Ghost&quot;. The title refers both to a professional ghostwriter, whose lengthy memorandum forms the novel, and to his immediate predecessor who, as the action opens, has just drowned in gruesome and mysterious circumstances. The dead man has been ghosting the autobiography of a recently unseated British prime minister called Adam Lang, a thinly veiled version of Blair. The fictional counterpart of Cherie Blair is depicted as a sinister manipulator of her husband. Harris told &quot;The Guardian&quot; before publication: &quot;The day this appears a writ might come through the door. But I would doubt it, knowing him.&quot;

Harris said in a U.S. National Public Radio interview that politicians like Lang and Blair, particularly when they have been in office for a long time, become divorced from everyday reality, read little and end up with a pretty limited overall outlook. When it comes to writing their memoirs, they therefore tend to have all the more need of a ghostwriter.

Harris hinted at a third, far less obvious, allusion hidden in the novel&#x27;s title, and, more significantly, at a possible motive for having written the book in the first place. Blair, he said, had himself been ghostwriter, in effect, to President Bush when giving public reasons for invading Iraq: he had argued the case better than had the President himself.

The &quot;New York Observer&quot;, headlining its otherwise hostile review &quot;The Blair Snitch Project&quot;, commented that the book&#x27;s &quot;shock-horror revelation&quot; was &quot;so shocking it simply can&#x27;t be true, though if it were it would certainly explain pretty much everything about the recent history of Great Britain.&quot;

Roman Polanski and Harris adapted the novel as the film &quot;The Ghost Writer&quot; (2010).

====&quot;Lustrum&quot; (2009)====
The second novel in the Cicero trilogy, &quot;Lustrum&quot;, was published in October 2009. It was released in February 2010 in the US under the alternative title of &quot;Conspirata&quot;.

====&quot;The Fear Index&quot; (2011)====
&quot;The Fear Index&quot; was published by Hutchinson in September 2011. It focuses on the 2010 Flash Crash and follows an American expat hedge fund operator living in Geneva who activates a new system of computer algorithms that he names VIXAL-4, which is designed to operate faster than human beings, but which begins to become uncontrollable by its human operators. It was adapted by Sky Atlantic in 2022 as a 4-part limited series starring Josh Hartnett.

====&quot;An Officer and a Spy&quot; (2013)====
&quot;An Officer and a Spy&quot; is the story of French officer Georges Picquart, a historical character, who is promoted in 1895 to run France&#x27;s &quot;Statistical Section&quot;, its secret intelligence division. He gradually realises that Alfred Dreyfus has been unjustly imprisoned for acts of espionage committed by another man who is still free and still spying for the Germans. He risks his career and his life to expose the truth. Harris was inspired to write the novel by his friend Roman Polanski, who adapted it as a film in 2019.

====&quot;Dictator&quot; (2015)====
&quot;Dictator&quot; was the long-promised conclusion to the Harris Cicero trilogy. It was published by Hutchinson on 8 October 2015.

====&quot;Conclave&quot; (2016)====
&quot;Conclave&quot;, published on 22 September 2016, is a novel &quot;set over 72 hours in the Vatican&quot;, leading up to &quot;the election of a fictional Pope&quot;. The film adaptation, starring Ralph Fiennes and Stanley Tucci and directed by Edward Berger, released in the US by Focus Features on 1 November 2024.

====&quot;Munich&quot; (2017)====
&quot;Munich&quot;, published on 21 September 2017, is a thriller set during the negotiations for the 1938 Munich Agreement between Hitler and UK Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain. The story is told through the eyes of two young civil servants – one German, Hartmann, and one English, Legat, who reunite at the fateful summit, six years after they were friends at university. It was adapted for Netflix as &quot;Munich – The Edge of War&quot;, starring Jeremy Irons and George MacKay in 2022.

====&quot;The Second Sleep&quot; (2019)====
&quot;The Second Sleep&quot;, published on 5 September 2019, is set in the small English village of Addicott St. George in Wessex in the year 1468 (but it is not &quot;our&quot; 1468; it&#x27;s 800 years later than the 2020s) and follows the events of a priest, Christopher Fairfax, sent there to bury the previous priest, and the secrets he discovers: about the priest, the village, and the society in which they live.

====&quot;V2&quot; (2020)====
&quot;V2&quot;, published on 17 September 2020, is a thriller set in November 1944 which follows the parallel stories of a German V-2 rocket scientist, Rudi Graf, and a British WAAF, Kay Caton-Walsh.

====&quot;Act of Oblivion&quot; (2022)====
&quot;Act of Oblivion&quot;, published on 1 September 2022, is set in 1660 and follows Richard Nayler of the Privy Council who is tasked with tracking down the regicides Edward Whalley and William Goffe. The book is notable for featuring only real figures as named characters, with the sole exception of Nayler.

====&quot;Precipice&quot; (2024)====
His latest novel, &quot;Precipice&quot;, was published on 29 August 2024. It follows a young British intelligence officer on the eve of World War I who is assigned to investigate the disappearance of top-secret documents during Prime Minister H. H. Asquith&#x27;s affair with Venetia Stanley.

===Work with Roman Polanski===
In 2007, Harris wrote a screenplay of his novel &quot;Pompeii&quot; for director Roman Polanski. Harris acknowledged in many interviews that the plot of his novel was inspired by Polanski&#x27;s film &quot;Chinatown&quot;, and Polanski said it was precisely that similarity that had attracted him to &quot;Pompeii&quot;. The film, to be produced by Summit Entertainment, was announced at the Cannes Film Festival in 2007 as potentially the most expensive European film ever made, set to be shot in Spain. Media reports suggested Polanski wanted Orlando Bloom and Scarlett Johansson to play the two leads. The film was cancelled in September 2007 as a result of a looming actors&#x27; strike.

Polanski and Harris then turned to Harris&#x27;s bestseller, &quot;The Ghost&quot;. They co-wrote a script and Polanski announced filming for early 2008, with Nicolas Cage, Pierce Brosnan, Tilda Swinton and Kim Cattrall starring. The film was then postponed by a year, with Ewan McGregor and Olivia Williams replacing Cage and Swinton.
The film, titled &quot;The Ghost Writer&quot; in all territories except the UK, was shot in early 2009 in Berlin and on the island of Sylt in the North Sea, which stood in for London and Martha&#x27;s Vineyard respectively, owing to Polanski&#x27;s inability to travel legally to those places. In spite of his later incarceration in Switzerland, he oversaw post-production while under house arrest and the film premiered at the Berlin Film Festival in February 2010.

Harris was inspired to write his novel &quot;An Officer and a Spy&quot; by Polanski&#x27;s longtime interest in the Dreyfus affair. He also wrote a screenplay based on the story, which Polanski was to direct in 2012. The screenplay was first titled &quot;D&quot;, after the initial written on the secret file that secured Dreyfus&#x27; conviction. After many years of production difficulties, it was filmed in 2018, starring Jean Dujardin. It was produced by Alain Goldman and released by Gaumont in 2019.

In June 2018 Harris reiterated his support for Polanski, and branded criticisms of Polanski&#x27;s crimes as being a problem of culture and fashion. &quot;The culture has completely changed...And so the question is: &quot;Do you then say, OK fine, I follow the culture.&#x27; Or do I say: &#x27;Well, he hasn&#x27;t done anything since then. He won the Oscar, he got a standing ovation in Los Angeles.&#x27; The zeitgeist has changed. Do you change with it? I don&#x27;t know, to be honest with you. Morally, I don&#x27;t see why I should change my position because the fashion has changed.&quot;

===TV appearances and radio broadcasts===
Harris has appeared on the BBC satirical panel game &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot; in episode three of the first series in 1990, and in episode four of the second series a year later. In the first he appeared as a last-minute replacement for the politician Roy Hattersley. In 1991 he played a supporting role as a reporter in the television series &quot;Selling Hitler&quot;, which was based on his non-fiction book of the same name. On 12 October 2007, he made a third appearance on the programme, 17 years, to the day, after his first appearance. Since the gap between his second and third appearance was nearly 16 years, Harris enjoyed the distinction of the longest gap between two successive appearances in the show&#x27;s history until Eddie Izzard appeared on 22 April 2016, just under 20 years after his last appearance on Episode 5 of Series 11 (17 May 1996).

On 2 December 2010, Harris appeared on the radio programme &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;, when he spoke about his childhood and his friendships with Tony Blair and Roman Polanski.

Harris appeared on the American PBS show &quot;Charlie Rose&quot; on 10 February 2012. Harris discussed his novel &quot;The Fear Index&quot; which he likened to a modern-day Gothic novel along the lines of Mary Shelley&#x27;s &quot;Frankenstein&quot;. Harris also discussed the adaptation of his novel, &quot;The Ghost&quot; that came out as the movie, &quot;The Ghost Writer&quot; directed by Roman Polanski.

===Columnist===
Harris was a columnist for &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, but gave it up in 1997. He returned to journalism in 2001, writing for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;. He was named &quot;Columnist of the Year&quot; at the 2003 British Press Awards.

== Personal life ==
Harris lives in a former vicarage in Kintbury, near Hungerford in Berkshire, with his wife, Gill Hornby, herself a writer and sister of best-selling novelist Nick Hornby. They have four children. Harris contributed a short story, &quot;PMQ&quot;, to Hornby&#x27;s 2000 collection &quot;Speaking with the Angel&quot;.

Formerly a donor to the Labour Party, he renounced his support for the party after the appointment of &quot;Guardian&quot; journalist Seumas Milne as its communications director by leader Jeremy Corbyn. He now supports the Liberal Democrats.

<text>Bioneers, under its parent foundation, Collective Heritage Institute, is a non-profit environmental and social justice advocacy organization based in New Mexico and California. Founded in 1990, the organization&#x27;s philosophy says that there is value and wisdom in the natural world, emphasizing that responses to problems must be in harmony with the design of natural systems. Official Programs include Moonrise Women&#x27;s Leadership, Restorative Food Systems, Indigeneity (Indigenous Forums), Education for Action, and the award-winning Dreaming New Mexico community resilience program.

Bioneers produces media covering subjects such as environmentalism, rights of nature, social justice, sustainability and permaculture. Bioneers Radio is broadcast on local radio stations across the U.S., as well as having segments featured on national NPR stations.

Bioneers also organizes the annual National Bioneers Conference, covering topics such as climate change, social justice and sustainability. Conference presenters have included Michael Pollan, Andrew Weil, Gloria Steinem, Jane Goodall, Philippe Cousteau, Eve Ensler, Bill McKibben, Paul Hawken, and more. Plenary (Keynote) sessions from the national conference are also webcast to Beaming Bioneers satellite conferences held simultaneously in various locations throughout the United States and Canada.

==Origin of name==
Bioneer (a portmanteau of &quot;biological pioneer&quot;) is a neologism coined by founder Kenny Ausubel. It describes individuals and groups working in diverse disciplines who have crafted creative solutions to various environmental and socio-cultural problems rooted in shared core values, including whole systems, (anticipatory) thinking, a view of all life as interdependent, and sustainable mutual aid.

==Annual conference==
The first National Bioneers Conference, organized by Co-founders Kenny Ausubel and Nina Simons, took place in 1990. For many years, the conference was held annually in the fall in San Rafael, California. In 2023, the Bioneers conference moved to Berkeley, California.

The national conference brings together a wide array of scientific and social innovators. Conference speakers come from interdisciplinary fields: environmental and socio-political activism; green-biology, chemistry, design, architecture and urban planning; organic and beyond organic farming and gardening; indigenous perspectives; biodiversity, bioremediation, and wildland preservation; alternative energy; engaged spirituality, literature and the arts; holistic and ecological medicine; ethnobotany; socially responsible entrepreneurship, business and philanthropy; the environmental justice, women&#x27;s and youth movements, independent media, etc.

In many cases, the technological or social solutions to problems showcased are founded on emulation of natural self-organizing systems.

<text>The Centre Party (), officially the German Centre Party () and also known in English as the Catholic Centre Party, is a Christian democratic political party in Germany. It was most influential in the German Empire and Weimar Republic. Formed in 1870, it successfully battled the waged by Chancellor Otto von Bismarck against the Catholic Church. It soon won a quarter of the seats in the Reichstag, and its middle position on most issues allowed it to play a decisive role in the formation of majorities. The party name (Centre) originally came from the fact that Catholic representatives would take up the middle section of seats in parliament between the social democrats and the conservatives.

For most of the Weimar Republic, the Centre Party was the third-largest party in the Reichstag and a bulwark of the Republic, participating in all governments until 1932. Following Adolf Hitler&#x27;s rise to power in early 1933, the Centre Party was among the parties who voted for the Enabling Act, which granted legislative powers to Hitler&#x27;s government. Nevertheless, the party was pressured into dissolving itself on 5 July, as the Nazi Party became the only legally permitted party in the country shortly thereafter.

After World War II, the party was reconstituted, but could not rise again to its former importance, as most of its members joined the new interdenominational Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and, in Bavaria, the Christian Social Union (CSU). The Centre Party continued on as a marginal party and concentrated its efforts on regional politics, mainly based in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia. The party was unrepresented on the German federal level from 1957 to 2022, when Federal representative Uwe Witt and European representative Jörg Meuthen defected from the AfD and joined the Centre Party.

==Before and during the German Empire==
===Origins===
The Centre Party belongs to the political spectrum of &quot;Political Catholicism&quot; that, emerging in the early 19th century after the turmoil of the Napoleonic wars, had changed the political face of Germany. Many Catholics found themselves in Protestant dominated states.

The first major conflict between the Catholic Church and a Protestant state was the &quot;Colonian Church conflict&quot;, when the Prussian government interfered in the question of mixed marriages and the religious affiliation of children resulting from these. This led to serious aggressions against the Catholic population of the Rhineland and Westphalia and culminated in the arrest of the Archbishop of Cologne. At that time, one of the founding fathers of Political Catholicism was journalist Joseph Görres, who called upon Catholics to &quot;stand united&quot; for their common goals, &quot;religious liberty and political and civil equality of the denominations&quot;. The conflict relaxed after 1840, with Frederick William IV&#x27;s accession to the throne.

The German revolutions of 1848–1849 brought new opportunities for German Catholics. In October, the bishops had their first meeting in 40 years in Würzburg and the local &quot;Catholic Federations&quot; assembled in Mainz to found the &quot;Catholic Federation of Germany&quot;. In the National Assembly, which was convened to draw up a German constitution, a &quot;Catholic club&quot; was formed. This was not yet a comprehensive party, but a loose union aimed at protecting the Church&#x27;s liberties in a future Germany, supported by many petitions from the &quot;[Pope] Pius federations for religious liberty&quot;. The later demise of the National Assembly proved to be a major setback for Political Catholicism.

In the Kingdom of Prussia, the revised constitution of 1850 granted liberties, which in parts even exceeded those of the Frankfurt draft constitution, yet two years later the minister for culture, von Raumer, issued decrees directed mainly against the Jesuits. In reaction this led to a doubling of Catholic representatives in the subsequent elections and the formation of a Catholic club in the Landtag of Prussia. In 1858, when the &quot;New Era&quot; governments of Wilhelm I adopted more lenient policies, the club renamed itself &quot;Fraction of the Centre&quot; in order to open itself up to include non-Catholics. This name stemmed from the fact that in the Landtag the Catholic representatives were seated in the centre, between the Conservatives on the right and the Liberals on the left. Faced with military and constitutional issues, where there was no definite Church position, the group soon disintegrated and disappeared from parliament after 1867.

=== Soest programme and founding ===


Growing anti-Catholic sentiment and policies, including plans for dissolving all monasteries in Prussia, made it clear that a reorganisation of the group was urgently needed in order to protect Catholic minority rights, enshrined in the 1850 constitution, and to bring them over to the emerging nation state.

In June 1870, Peter Reichensperger called on Catholics to unite and, in October, priests, representatives of Catholic federations and the Catholic gentry met at Soest and drew up an election programme. The main points were:
* Preservation of the Church&#x27;s autonomy and rights, as accepted by the constitution. Defence against any attack on the independence of Church bodies, on the development of religious life and on the practice of Christian charity.
* Effectual implementation of parity for recognised denominations.
* Rejection of any attempt to de-Christianise marriage.
* Preservation or founding of denominational schools.

There were also more general demands such as for a more federal, decentralised state, a limitation of state expenditure, a just distribution of taxes, the financial strengthening of the middle classes and the legal &quot;removal of such evil states, that threaten the worker with moral or bodily ruin&quot;. With such a manifesto, the number of Catholic representatives in the Prussian Diet rose considerably. In December 1870, they formed a new &quot;Centre&quot; faction, also called the &quot;Constitution Party&quot; to emphasise its adherence to constitutional liberties.

Three months later, early in 1871, the Catholic representatives to the new national parliament, the Reichstag, also formed a &quot;Centre&quot; &quot;faction&quot;. The party not only defended the Church&#x27;s liberties, but also supported representative government and minority rights in general, in particular those of German Poles, Alsatians, and Hannoverians. The Centre&#x27;s main leader was the Hannoverian advocate Ludwig Windthorst and other major figures included Karl Friedrich von Savigny, Hermann von Mallinckrodt, Burghard Freiherr von Schorlemer-Alst, the brothers August Reichensperger and Peter Reichensperger, Franz von Ballestrem and Georg Count Hertling. The party was named the Centre Party due to the fact that in Parliament the Catholics sat between the Liberals on the left and the Conservatives on the right as opposed to the party adhering to centrism in the modern context.

Also in other German states Catholic parties were formed, cooperating with the Prussian Centre Party in the Reichstag:
* in Bavaria, the &quot;Bavarian Patriotic Party&quot;, with a particularistic-conservative bent, since 1887 called the &quot;Bavarian Centre&quot;.

The Catholic People&#x27;s Party was formed in the Grand Duchy of Baden in 1869, and merged into the Centre Party in 1888.

===&quot;Kulturkampf&quot;===
In the age of nationalism, Protestant Germans, whether Conservative (like Otto von Bismarck) or Liberal, accused the Centre of Ultramontanism or having a greater loyalty towards the Pope than to the German nation. After the First Vatican Council, Bismarck launched the &quot;Kulturkampf&quot; (&quot;cultural struggle&quot;) against the Catholic Church. Catholics fought back vigorously and with near-unanimity. The Centre party gained greater support from the Catholic population. Following Bismarck&#x27;s 1879 turn from free trade to protectionism and from the National Liberal party to the Conservative parties, he also abandoned the unsuccessful &quot;Kulturkampf&quot;. The Centre party remained a party of opposition to Bismarck, but after his resignation in 1890, it frequently supported the following administrations&#x27; policies in the Reichstag, particularly in the field of social security.

===Attempts to broaden appeal beyond Catholics===
The Kulturkampf had reinforced the Catholic character of the Centre Party, but even during it Ludwig Windthorst had defended the party against Bismarck&#x27;s accusation of being a &quot;denominational party&quot; in describing the Centre as &quot;a political party with a comprehensive political programme and open to anyone, who accepts it&quot;. However, few Protestants took up this offer and the Centre remained, by the composition of its members, politicians and voters, an essentially Catholic party.

Loyal to the Pope in church matters, the Centre party steered a course independent of the Holy See on secular matters. This became apparent in the &quot;septennat dispute&quot; of 1886. Since the Centre Party rejected Bismarck&#x27;s military budget, the Chancellor negotiated with the Holy See and promised to abolish some Kulturkampf-related laws and to support the Pope in the Roman question, if the Vatican persuaded the Centre Party to accept his bill. Despite this agreement, the Centre Party rejected the budget and Bismarck called new elections. He also published the letters with the Vatican, intending to drive a wedge between Catholic voters loyal to the Pope and the Centre Party with the slogan: &quot;The Pope against the Centre!&quot; Windhorst managed to avert this by reaffirming the Party&#x27;s autonomy, which the Pope had accepted, and by interpreting the published letters as expressions of papal confidence in the party.

As the Kulturkampf declined, debates about the character of the party emerged culminating in the Centre dispute, in 1906, after Julius Bachem had published the article &quot;We must get out of the tower!&quot; He called upon Catholic politicians to fulfill Windthorst&#x27;s word and get out of their perpetual minority position by an effort to increase Protestant numbers among their representatives in parliament. His proposal was met with passionate opposition by the greater part of Catholic public, especially since it also included the Christian trade unions and other Catholic organisations. No side could win the upper hand, when the outbreak of World War I ended the dispute.

After the war, there were many proposals on how the reform the party. Heinrich Brauns published the Cologne Program (Kölner Programm), which proposed the re-formation of the Zentrum under a new name (Christliche Volkspartei, CVP). This proposal was rejected, with only a few regions adopting it for the 1919 election; the party instead adopted the Berlin Guidelines (Berliner Leitsätze), which were more moderate but failed at making the Zentrum attractive for Protestant voters too. Adam Stegerwald, leader of the Christian trade unions, made another attempt at transcending the party&#x27;s exclusively Catholic character and uniting Germany&#x27;s fragmented party spectrum. In 1920 he advocated the formation of a broad Christian middle-party, that would transcend denominations and social classes and which could push back the Social Democrats&#x27; influence.

The Polish minority in the German Empire formed one of the largest Catholic groups, but the Centre Party pursued an anti-Polish course causing enmity between it and Polish minority.

===In war and revolution===
With the German entry into World War I, the party also used the debates about war bonds to push for a repeal of the last remnants of anti-Jesuit laws. In 1916, the Reichstag adopted a resolution introduced by the Centre Party, calling on the government to follow the &quot;Oberste Heeresleitung (OHL)&quot;&#x27;s recommendation on the use of submarines. The OHL&#x27;s policy of resuming unrestricted submarine warfare was supposed to break the deadlock of the war but instead led to the United States entry into the war. As the war continued, many of the leaders of the Centre&#x27;s left wing, particularly Matthias Erzberger, came to support a negotiated settlement, and Erzberger was key in the passage of the Reichstag Peace Resolution of 1917.

The same year, the Centre&#x27;s Georg von Hertling, formerly Minister-President of Bavaria, was appointed Chancellor, but he could not overcome the dominance of the military leadership of Hindenburg and Ludendorff. When a parliamentary system of government was introduced in October 1918, the new chancellor Max von Baden appointed representatives from the Centre party, the Social Democrats and the left-liberals as ministers.

After the fall of the monarchy in the German Revolution of 1918–1919, conflict arose between the party and the new Social Democratic government. Adolf Hofmann, the Free State of Prussia minister for culture, attempted to decree a total separation of church and state, forcing religion out of schools. This stirred up a wave of protest among the Catholic population, and bishops, Catholic organisations and the Centre Party itself united to combat the &quot;red danger&quot;. This conflict bridged internal tensions within the party and secured its continual existence despite the turmoil of the revolution. The party however was weakened by its Bavarian wing splitting off and forming the Bavarian People&#x27;s Party (BVP), which emphasised autonomy of the states and also took a more conservative course.

In the 1919 elections for the Weimar National Assembly, the Centre Party gained 91 representatives, being the second largest party after the Social Democratic Party (SPD). The Centre&#x27;s Constantin Fehrenbach was elected president of the National Assembly. The party actively cooperated with Social Democrats and left-liberal German Democratic Party (DDP) in drawing up the Weimar Constitution, which guaranteed what the Centre had been fighting for since its founding: equality for Catholics and autonomy for Catholic Church throughout Germany. The party was less successful in the school question. Although religious education remained an ordinary subject in most schools, the comprehensive, inter-denominational schools became default.

==Weimar Republic and Nazi Germany==

===In the Weimar Republic===

The Centre Party, whose pragmatic principles generally left it open to supporting either a monarchical or republican form of government, proved one of the mainstays of the Weimar Republic, continuing the cooperation with SPD and DDP in the Weimar Coalition. This combination, however, lost its majority in the 1920 elections. The formation of the new Christian People&#x27;s Party in Rhineland (May 1920) caused considerable concern among the Centre leadership. Seeing the exodus of conservative Catholics caused by a sharp left turn of the Centre at the end of war, Adam Stegerwald proposed his &quot;Essen program&quot; (September 1920) that promised Germany to become &quot;Christian, democratic, German, and social&quot; and a plan to form a broad-based Christian party.

The party was an ideologically diverse coalition of Catholic politicians, comprising republicans like Matthias Erzberger and Joseph Wirth as well as right-wingers like Franz von Papen. As a result of the party&#x27;s flexibility, it participated in every government between 1919 and 1932, both with parties to their left and to their right. The Centre mainly provided the ministers for finance and labour and, on four occasions, the Chancellor. However, this also damaged the party&#x27;s prospects because it was increasingly associated with all of the conflicts, problems, and failures of the Republic. The Centre had a share of the odium attached to the so-called &quot;Weimar Establishment&quot; which was blamed, especially on the right, for the German defeat in World War I in the Stab-in-the-back myth, as well as for the humiliations of the Versailles Treaty and reparations. Erzberger himself, who had signed the armistice, was assassinated by right-wing extremists in 1921.
The parties of the Weimar Coalition (Social Democrats, Centre and the left-liberal German Democratic Party (DDP)) were the base of the Weimar Republic but lost their majority in the 1920 elections. After this, majority governments were rare as they required the support of the Weimar Coalition and the national liberal German People&#x27;s Party (DVP). Social Democrats and DVP found it hard to agree on economic policy while Social Democrats disagreed with the Centre Party on issues like religious schools or a nationwide Concordat with the Holy See.

Following the 1920 elections, the Centre&#x27;s Constantin Fehrenbach formed a minority government in a coalition with the DDP and the DVP. In May 1921 the Weimar Coalition once again joined forces with the Centre&#x27;s Joseph Wirth as Chancellor, but this minority government collapsed again in November 1922. After this, the Centre participated in the non-affiliated Wilhelm Cuno&#x27;s &quot;government of the economy&quot;, together with both liberal parties and the Bavarian People&#x27;s Party (BVP).

In August 1923, the DVP&#x27;s Gustav Stresemann formed a Grand Coalition administration, comprising the Centre, both Liberal parties and the Social Democrats, which lasted until November, when the Social Democrats left the coalition and the Centre&#x27;s Wilhelm Marx became chancellor of a cabinet of the remaining parties. In January 1925 the non-affiliated Hans Luther was appointed chancellor and formed a coalition between the Centre, both Liberal parties, the BVP and, for the first time, the right-wing German National People&#x27;s Party (DNVP). The Centre, the BVP and the DNVP jointly supported legislation to expand religious schools.

In the same year, Wilhelm Marx was the Centre&#x27;s candidate in the presidential elections. In the second round, combining the support of the Weimar coalition parties, he gained 45.3% of the vote and finished a close second to the victorious right-wing candidate Paul von Hindenburg with 48.3%. In May 1926 Chancellor Luther resigned and Marx again assumed the chancellorship. In June 1928, the general elections resulted in losses for the government parties and in gains for the Social Democrats and the Communists. The Grand Coalition of 1923 was revived, this time including the BVP and the Social Democrat Hermann Müller became chancellor.

During the years of the Weimar Republic, debates about the Catholic character of the party, as described above, persisted. The left-wing of the party, led by Erzberger and Wirth, had close ties to the Catholic workers&#x27; associations led by Joseph Joos. Some politicians on the right wing of the party, including Heinrich Brauns and Franz von Papen, advocated a move towards the right and a closer cooperation with the national movements. The middle-ground emphasised their loyalty to the Church and rejected both extremes. To mediate the tension between the wings and to strengthen their ties with the Bishops, the party in September 1928 did not elect the two favourites Joseph Joos and Adam Stegerwald, but rather the cleric Ludwig Kaas as chairman.

===Brüning administration===

In 1930, the &quot;Grand Coalition&quot; fell apart. Heinrich Brüning, from the moderate-conservative wing of the party, was appointed as Chancellor with a cabinet that, apart from the missing Social Democrats, was virtually unchanged. Brüning was confronted with economic crises exacerbated by the Great Depression and had to tackle the difficult tasks of consolidating both budget and currency when faced with rising unemployment, and of also negotiating changes to the war reparations payments. His course of strict budget discipline, with severe cuts in public expenditure, and tax increases made him extremely unpopular among the lower and middle classes as well as among the Prussian Junkers.

In 1930, Brüning&#x27;s failure to gain a majority for his policies in parliament prompted him to call early elections, in which the four parties of the former Grand coalition lost their majority. After this, Brüning based his administration entirely on the support of the presidential decrees (&quot;Notverordnung&quot;) through article 48 of the Constitution. This allowed him to circumvent parliament, as long as the Social Democrats - who feared another election - tolerated this practice. For this way of government based on both the President and cooperation of parliament, Brüning coined the term &quot;authoritarian democracy&quot;.

By this time, the party had become increasingly ambivalent toward democracy. Many elements of the party, including Kaas, had come to believe that only an authoritarian regime could protect the position of the Church.

The Centre consistently supported Brüning&#x27;s government and in 1932 vigorously campaigned for the re-election of Paul von Hindenburg, calling him a &quot;venerate historical personality&quot; and &quot;the keeper of the constitution&quot;. Hindenburg was re-elected against Adolf Hitler, but shortly afterwards dismissed Brüning on 30 May 1932.

President Hindenburg, advised by General Kurt von Schleicher, appointed the Catholic nobleman Franz von Papen as Chancellor, a member of the Centre&#x27;s right wing and former cavalry captain. The intention was to break the connection of the Centre with the other republican parties or to split the party and integrate it into a comprehensive conservative movement. However, the Centre refused to support Papen&#x27;s government in any way and criticised him for &quot;distorting and abusing good old ideals of the Centre, acting as the representative of reactionary circles&quot;. Papen forestalled being expelled by leaving the party.

===Between coup d&#x27;état and authoritarian democracy===
Following Brüning&#x27;s resignation, the Centre Party entered the opposition. Though they also opposed the Nazi Party, their energies were directed mainly against the renegade Papen. Some Centre politicians were soothed by Hitler&#x27;s strategy of legality into downplaying the Nazi threat.

In regard to the government, the Centre Party rejected a &quot;temporal solution&quot;, such as Papen&#x27;s presidial cabinets, and rather advocated a &quot;total solution&quot;, i.e., a government according to the rules of the constitution. Since the Centre considered Papen&#x27;s administration of being &quot;in a dangerous way dependent on radical right-wing parties&quot;, chairman Ludwig Kaas advised the President to recognise this connection by basing the government on a coalition with the rising right-wing parties, the &quot;logical result of current development&quot;. This would force the radicals to &quot;take their share in responsibility&quot; and &quot;acquainting them with international politics&quot;. The Centre would then act as the party of opposition to this administration.

As Papen was faced with almost uniform opposition by the parties, he had the Reichstag dissolved. In the subsequent elections, the Centre Party campaigned on two fronts, against both the Papen government and National Socialists and reaffirmed their stance as the &quot;constitution party&quot; opposed to &quot;any measure contrary to constitution, justice and law&quot; and &quot;unwilling to yield to terror&quot;. The July 1932 elections brought further losses to the mainstream parties and gains to the extremist parties. The National Socialists supplanted the Social Democrats as the largest party in the Reichstag.

As Communists and National Socialists together had won the majority of seats, no government coalition could be formed without one of them. Papen tried to justify his authoritarian style of government by pointing out that parliament could no longer function properly. Countering this reasoning, the Centre and the BVP tried to re-establish a working parliament by cooperation with the National Socialists, since the three parties together had attained 53% of the seats. When Papen called upon the people to &quot;reject the dictatorship of a single party&quot;, the Centre Party agreed &quot;without reservation&quot;, but it also stated that &quot;with the same resolution we reject the dictatorship of the nameless party, now in power … even if cloaked with the illusion of non-partisanship&quot;.

After Papen failed to get Hitler&#x27;s support for his administration, the Centre began their own negotiations with the National Socialists. They started in the state of Prussia, where the Weimar Coalition had just lost its majority. An alternative majority could be not found and the Papen administration had seized this opportunity to assume control of Germany&#x27;s largest state in the &quot;Prussian coup&quot; via presidential decree. Now, the National Socialists proposed to end this direct rule by forming a coalition with the Centre Party, promising an equal share in government. Since this went too far for the Centre&#x27;s national leadership, the negotiations were transferred to the national level, where Heinrich Brüning conferred with Gregor Strasser. During that period the anti-Nazi polemics ceased in order not to disturb the negotiations. Since the NSDAP was the larger party, the Centre was willing to accept a Nazi as Chancellor, provided he could gain the trust of the President, which at that time seemed quite a difficult task.

The negotiations were bound for failure, since the aims of the two groups were largely incompatible. The Centre argued that the vote of July had &quot;called Hitler not to dictatorship but to responsibility, to getting in line with law and constitution&quot;. They hoped to &quot;build a strong government without touching the substance of the constitution&quot;, to create &quot;clear responsibilities&quot; and to &quot;preclude anti-constitutional experiments&quot;. The Centre advocated a return to Brüning&#x27;s &quot;authoritarian democracy&quot;, which they considered up to the times and tested by experience, against Papen&#x27;s &quot;omnipotent state and independent leadership&quot;, while the Nazis would only accept a coalition that would serve their purpose of achieving total dominance. Not expecting a successful conclusion, Hitler used the Centre negotiations in order to put pressure on the Papen administration.

The negotiations were also met with criticism from within the Centre Party. Some rejected them as &quot;currying favour with the National Socialists&quot; and giving credence to Hitler&#x27;s strategy of legality. Catholic journalists Fritz Gerlich and Ingbert Naab dismissed as &quot;illusionary&quot; the attempt to &quot;uphold the constitution and the legal order&quot; with a man such as Hitler with his &quot;unconditional propensity to evil&quot;. Instead of &quot;driving out the devil by Belzebub&quot;, the Centre should act as the parliament&#x27;s conscience. The party leadership answered their critics by calling it a &quot;duty of conscience&quot; to try to achieve a constitutional government. Though Papen did not expect the negotiations to succeed, he was nonetheless concerned as a success would have led to a presidential crisis, as Hindenburg was unwilling to have a coalition parties dictate the administration. In September he ended all speculations by dissolving the Reichstag again, almost immediately after its first meeting.

Papen&#x27;s act did not end the negotiations between the Centre and the NSDAP. In fact, it made further meetings possible, since the Centre Party&#x27;s leadership blamed the failure not on the parties&#x27; incompatibility but on Papen calling for new elections. Since the NSDAP vote dropped again in the elections of November 1932, the Centre Party considered their strategy successful and resumed negotiations, this time under the slogan of forming a &quot;Notgemeinschaft&quot; (&quot;community of need&quot;), even though the Centre, BVP, and NSDAP together no longer formed a majority in parliament.

Kaas advised President Hindenburg not to continue Papen&#x27;s &quot;administration of conflict&quot;; he advocated &quot;national concentration including the National Socialists&quot;, but did not comment on an alternative Chancellor, since he considered that the &quot;personal prerogative of the President&quot;. Hindenburg&#x27;s negotiations with Hitler failed, but so did Kaas&#x27;s attempt to form a coalition in parliament. By avoiding a clear statement, Hitler managed to pin the blame for this failure on the DNVP&#x27;s Alfred Hugenberg, who had rejected Kaas&#x27;s proposals.

Since the cabinet had refused to support Papen&#x27;s planned coup d&#x27;état by a permanent dissolution of the Reichstag, in December Hindenburg appointed General Kurt von Schleicher as Chancellor. Schleicher tried to form a &quot;Querfront&quot; (an alliance involving willing members of both left-wing and right-wing parties), which failed. Schleicher then revived Papen&#x27;s proposed coup d&#x27;état, which the Centre Party refused to condone, as did the other parties. Under these circumstances, Hindenburg refused to back the coup, and Schleicher accordingly resigned on 28 January 1933.

===Hitler government and new elections===
Meanwhile, Papen had formed an intrigue to oust his successor. He conferred with Hugenberg and industrial magnates and bankers during a feverish night in which the outcome was unclear to all participants. On 30 January 1933 Hitler was appointed Chancellor with Papen as Vice-Chancellor and Hugenberg as minister for economics.

Though seeing their adversaries Papen and Hugenberg join forces with Hitler, the Centre Party still did not give up building a broad coalition government. Since the new administration was still lacking a majority in parliament, the Centre was ready to support it, either by toleration or by coalition. Hitler intended to minimise non-Nazi participation, but feigned a willingness to cooperate with the Centre and blamed Papen and Hugenberg for denying cabinet posts to the Centre. When Kaas requested a broad outline of his government&#x27;s objectives, Hitler used the questionnaire presented by Kaas to declare the talks a failure and obtain the President&#x27;s approval for calling for new elections for the third time in about half a year.

These elections in March 1933 were already marred by the SA&#x27;s terror, after the Reichstag fire and civil rights had been suspended by President Hindenburg through the Reichstag Fire Decree. Still the Centre Party campaigned hard against the Hitler administration and managed to preserve their former vote of roughly 11 per cent. The government parties NSDAP and DNVP however jointly won 52 per cent of the vote. This result shattered the Centre Party&#x27;s hopes of being indispensable for obtaining a majority in parliament. The party was now faced with two alternatives – either to persist in protesting and risk reprisals like Communists and Social Democrats, or to declare their loyal cooperation, in order to protect their members. As shown by subsequent events, though deeply uncomfortable with the new government, the party opted for the latter alternative.

===Enabling Act===

The government confronted the newly elected Reichstag with the Enabling Act that would have vested the government with legislative powers for a period of four years. As the bill required a two-thirds majority in order to pass and the coalition parties only controlled 340 of the 647 seats (52.5 percent), the government needed the support of other parties.

The Centre Party, whose vote was going to be decisive, was split on the issue of the Enabling Act. Chairman Kaas advocated supporting the bill in parliament in return for government guarantees. These mainly included respecting the President&#x27;s Office retaining veto power, religious liberty, its involvement in culture, schools and education, the concordats signed by German states and the existence of the Centre Party. Via Papen, Hitler responded positively and personally addressed the issues in his Reichstag speech but he repeatedly put off signing a written letter of agreement.

Kaas was aware of the doubtful nature of such guarantees but when the Centre Party assembled on 23 March to decide on their vote, Kaas advised his fellow party members to support the bill, given the &quot;precarious state of the party&quot;. He described his reasons as follows: &quot;On the one hand we must preserve our soul, but on the other hand a rejection of the Enabling Act would result in unpleasant consequences for fraction and party. What is left is only to guard us against the worst. Were a two-thirds majority not obtained, the government&#x27;s plans would be carried through by other means. The President has acquiesced in the Enabling Act. From the DNVP no attempt of relieving the situation is to be expected.&quot;

According to English historian Richard J. Evans, the main reason why the Centre Party voted for the Enabling Act despite questioning the sincerity of Hitler&#x27;s guarantees was because of the intimidation that it was subjected to. The party was further pressured by the fact that on 26 June 1933, all of the Reichstag and Landtag deputies of the Bavarian People&#x27;s Party were placed in custody by Heinrich Himmler. This was also followed by the Nazi troops forcefully disbanding the Catholic trade unions, and Catholic civil servants being threatened with dismissals. In light of the increasing oppression, most members of the Centre Party believed that they were powerless to prevent the NSDAP from gaining power. Evan wrote:
A considerable number of parliamentarians opposed the chairman&#x27;s course, among these former Chancellors Heinrich Brüning, Joseph Wirth and former minister Adam Stegerwald. Brüning called the Act the &quot;most monstrous resolution ever demanded of a parliament&quot; and was sceptical about Kaas&#x27;s efforts: &quot;The party has difficult years ahead, no matter how it would decide. Sureties for the government fulfilling its promises have not been given. Without a doubt, the future of the Centre Party is in danger and once it is destroyed it cannot be revived again.&quot;

The opponents also argued that Catholic social teaching ruled out participating in acts of revolution. The proponents argued that a &quot;national revolution&quot; had already occurred with Hitler&#x27;s appointment and the presidential decree suspending civil rights. The Enabling Act would contain the revolutionary forces and move the government back to a legal order. Both groupings were not unaffected by Hitler&#x27;s self-portrayal as a moderate seeking cooperation as opposed to the more revolutionary SA led by Ernst Röhm. Even Brüning thought it would be &quot;decisive which groups of the NSDAP will be in power in the future. Will Hitler&#x27;s power increase or will he fail, that is the question.&quot;

In the end the majority of Centre parliamentarians supported Kaas&#x27;s proposal. Brüning and his followers agreed to respect party discipline by also voting in favour of the bill. The Reichstag assembled under turbulent circumstances. SA men served as guards and crowded outside the building to intimidate any opposition while the Communist and some Social Democratic members of the Reichstag had been imprisoned and were thus prevented from voting. In the end, the Centre voted as planned in favour of the Enabling Act, as did all the other parties apart from the SPD. The act was passed on 23 March 1933.

===End of the party===
The passing of the Enabling Act did not, as Kaas had suggested, prevent the Centre Party&#x27;s demise. As promised during the negotiations, a working committee chaired by Hitler and Kaas was supposed to inform about further legislative measures. However, it met only three times (31 March, 2 and 7 April) without any major impact. At that time, the Centre Party was weakened by massive defections by party members. Loyal party members, in particular civil servants, and other Catholic organisations were subject to increasing reprisals, despite Hitler&#x27;s previous guarantees. The party was also hurt by a declaration of the German bishops that, while maintaining their opposition to Nazi ideology, modified the ban on cooperation with the new authorities.

The issue of the concordat prolonged Kaas&#x27;s stay in Rome, leaving the party without an effective chairman: On 5 May Kaas finally resigned from his post and the party now elected Brüning as his successor. The party adopted a tempered version of the leadership principle; pro-Centre papers now declared that the party&#x27;s members, or &quot;retinue&quot;, would fully submit itself to Brüning. It was not enough, however, to relieve the growing pressure that it and other parties faced in the wake of the process of Gleichschaltung. Prominent members were frequently arrested and beaten, and pro-Centre civil servants were fired. As the summer of 1933 wore on, several government officials — including Papen — demanded that the Centre either dissolve or be closed down by the government.

By July, the Centre was the only non-Nazi party that still even nominally existed; the SPD and KPD had been banned outright, while the others had been browbeaten into dissolving themselves. On 1 July, Papen and Kaas agreed that as part of the concordat, German priests would stay out of politics. As it turned out, the party dissolved on 5 July — much to the dismay of Cardinal Pacelli, who felt the party should at least have waited until after the conclusion of negotiations. The day after, the government issued a law outlawing the formation of new political parties, thereby making the NSDAP the only legally permitted party in Germany.

==Refounding and post-war history==
After the war, the party was refounded, but it was confronted with the emergence of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), a new party formed as a Christian party comprising both Catholics and Protestants. As many former Centre party politicians, such as Konrad Adenauer, were founding members or joined the CDU, and Cardinal Josef Frings of Cologne endorsed the new party, the party lost its position as the party of the Catholic population. For some time, however, the party managed to hold on to regional strongholds in North Rhine-Westphalia. In 1945, its Rudolf Amelunxen had been the new state&#x27;s first Minister-President, and it participated in the state government until 1958, when it left the state parliament. Until 1959, the Centre was also represented in the state parliament of Lower Saxony.

On the national level, in the elections of 1949, it won ten seats in the first Bundestag. However, in 1953, the party (with the aid from the regional CDU) only retained three seats. In 1957, largely due to the massive CDU landslide that year, the party dropped out of the Bundestag completely and it did not return until 2022.

This demise is at least partly because of Helene Wessel. In 1949, she was one of the Centre&#x27;s representatives in the Bundestag and also was elected chairwoman of the party, the first woman ever to lead a German party. In 1951, she vocally opposed Adenauer&#x27;s policy of West German rearmament and joined forces with the CDU&#x27;s Gustav Heinemann, the former Minister of the Interior. The two formed the &quot;Notgemeinschaft zur Rettung des Friedens in Europa&quot; (&quot;Emergency Community to Save the Peace in Europe&quot;), an initiative intended to prevent rearmament. Wessel resigned from her post and in November 1952 left the party. Immediately afterwards, Wessel and Heinemann turned the &quot;Notgemeinschaft&quot; into a political party, the All-German People&#x27;s Party (&quot;Gesamtdeutsche Volkspartei,&quot; GVP), that failed badly in the elections of 1953. In 1957, the GVP dissolved, and most members joined the SPD.

Meanwhile, the survivors of the Centre Party tried to forge an alliance of small parties of Christian persuasion, to offer an alternative to disappointed CDU/CSU voters, but they gained only the support of the Bavaria Party. The two parties joined forces under the name , first in parliament since 1951 and in the 1957 the general elections, but the results were disappointing.

In 1988, the right wing of the party split off and formed the &quot;Christian Centre Party&quot;. In 2003 the evangelical &quot;Christian Party of Germany&quot; (CPD) joined the Centre Party.

Since its demise on the national level, the party focuses on local politics, while maintaining the same positions as in the post-war period. The party is represented in some city councils in North Rhine-Westphalia and Saxony-Anhalt. Despite its marginal numbers, the party emphasises continuity to its history by sometimes referring to itself as the &quot;oldest political party of Germany&quot;. According to its statutes the official name of the party is &quot;Deutsche Zentrumspartei – Älteste Partei Deutschlands gegründet 1870&quot; (German Centre Party – Oldest Party in Germany founded in 1870).

===Small revival===
The current chairman of the party is Klaus Brall. The party is affiliated with the European Christian Political Movement.

In 2022, former Alternative for Germany member Uwe Witt joined the party while still holding his seat in the Bundestag. It is the first time since 1957 that the party has held a seat in the Bundestag. Witt subsequently left in August of the same year.

The party also got its first representation in the European Parliament on 10 June 2022, when the former AfD co-chairman Jörg Meuthen joined the party. However, Meuthen left the party in September 2023.

==Ideology and beliefs==

Although the party&#x27;s ideology has shifted throughout its existence, it has consistently presented itself through a Christian democratic and politically Catholic profile. It was seen to occupy the political centre, although the party is considered to have shifted towards the right of centre in early 1930s under the leadership of Ludwig Kaas. &quot;The Oxford Handbook of the Weimar Republic&quot; argues that while &quot;Until recently, historians considered Kaas to have been an... ominous indication of the Centre’s shift to the right&quot;, the party&#x27;s position was &quot;more nuanced&quot;, as it continued to accept the legitimacy of the Weimar Republic and its constitution, and Kaas strove to reconcile both the left-leaning and right-leaning wings of the party.

The party adopted a new program in 2008 in which it stated rejection for the traditional left and right divide of politics and called for a &quot;value-oriented&quot; platform guided by the principles of Christianity and Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany. The party supports the traditional family unit and is generally opposed to abortion. It has given support to &quot;right to life&quot; movements in Germany.

During the Weimar era, the Centre Party was socially and economically heterogenous and included groups of various political views and interests, including republicans and monarchists, and was considered to represent the entire &quot;political microcosm of Weimar Catholic society&quot;. It included industrial workers and smallholders, broad middle class (including both the agrarian and urban middle classes), as well as entrepreneurs, civil servants and clerics, and lastly a small but influential group of Catholic aristocracy. The uniting element of the factions of the Centre Party was commitment to Political Catholicism. The party had a left wing, represented by politicians such as Constantin Fehrenbach, Matthias Erzberger, Joseph Wirth, as well as Catholic workers&#x27; associations and Catholic trade unions, led by the Centre&#x27;s laborist politicians such as Adam Stegerwald. 

Left-wing factions of the Centre Party were committed to republicanism and pressured the Zentrum to identify itself as a pro-republican party; however, the party instead adopted a vague label of being a &quot;constitutional party&quot;, which was &quot;ready to collaborate with any legal government&quot; of any form of the government. The leftists of the Centre Party also promoted cooperation with the SPD and advised Weimar Catholics to join the Reichsbanner; some left-wing Centre factions were also supportive of cooperation with right-wing nationalist trade unions on pragmatic basis. Along with &quot;republican-democratic&quot; wings of the party, the Centre Party also had socialist factions. Catholic socialism was promoted by politicians such as Heinrich Mertens and Vitus Heller, as well as the Catholic priest Wilhelm Hohoff, who argued that Marx&#x27;s criticism of capitalism is consistent with Catholic social teaching, and believed that the atheism of socialism &quot;was not an essential ingredient but only a transient phase&quot;. The Catholic socialists of the Centre Party presented various positions, such as promoting a &quot;third way&quot; between capitalism and socialism based on the papal encyclical Quadragesimo anno, or advocating economical socialism with a strongly religious character, rejecting the secular currents of socialism and social democracy.

In stark contrast to pro-parliamentary and pro-republican factions of the Centre, there were also anti-republican and anti-democratic factions, which argued that Weimar democracy promoted anti-Catholic values such as secularism, individualism and materialism. The party&#x27;s right wing was represented by figures such as the cardinal Michael von Faulhaber or Hermann Port, who sought cooperation with conservative parties. Because of the extreme ideological heterogeneity of the party, it simultaneously participated in pro- and anti-republican coalitions on the local level. In attempt to solve internal dissent, the party would increasingly appoint Catholic priests and clerics to leading positions, as opposed to non-clerical politicians associated with certain interest groups witin the party. This practice led to the appointment of figures such as Ludwig Kaas in 1928. The party then became subject to the broader shift to the right of the Weimar society in late 1920s caused by the Great Depression and dissatisfaction with the Weimar political system, which also included the Catholic groups.

In an updated policy platform in 2022, the Centre Party declares its objective is to protect the &quot;Christian-Jewish roots of Europe and defend the free-democratic basic order of the Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany.&quot; The party supports a social market economy, keeping national debt low and strong social security systems. The party supports the integration of immigrants residing legally in Germany while protecting German national identity and ensuring compulsory laws for immigrants to learn German, understand German culture and undergo a values test before acquiring citizenship. It also calls for strong law and order and national security policies to combat violent crime and terrorism and supports German membership of NATO.

<text>Automatic label placement, sometimes called text placement or name placement, comprises the computer methods of placing labels automatically on a map or chart. This is related to the typographic design of such labels.

The typical features depicted on a geographic map are line features (e.g. roads), area features (countries, parcels, forests, lakes, etc.), and point features (villages, cities, etc.). In addition to depicting the map&#x27;s features in a geographically accurate manner, it is of critical importance to place the names that identify these features, in a way that the reader knows instantly which name describes which feature.

Automatic text placement is one of the most difficult, complex, and time-consuming problems in mapmaking and GIS (Geographic Information System). Other kinds of computer-generated graphics – like charts, graphs etc. – require good placement of labels as well, not to mention engineering drawings, and professional programs which produce these drawings and charts, like spreadsheets (e.g. Microsoft Excel) or computational software programs (e.g. Mathematica).

Naively placed labels overlap excessively, resulting in a map that is difficult or even impossible to read. Therefore, a GIS must allow a few possible placements of each label, and often also an option of resizing, rotating, or even removing (suppressing) the label. Then, it selects a set of placements that results in the least overlap, and has other desirable properties. For all but the most trivial setups, the problem is NP-hard.

==Rule-based algorithms==
Rule-based algorithms try to emulate an experienced human cartographer. Over centuries, cartographers have developed the art of mapmaking and label placement. For example, an experienced cartographer repeats road names several times for long roads, instead of placing them once, or in the case of Ocean City depicted by a point very close to the shore, the cartographer would place the label &quot;Ocean City&quot; over the land to emphasize that it is a coastal town.

Cartographers work based on accepted conventions and rules, such as those itemized by Swiss cartographer Eduard Imhof in 1962. For example, New York City, Vienna, Berlin, Paris, or Tokyo must show up on country maps because they are high-priority labels. Once those are placed, the cartographer places the next most important class of labels, for example major roads, rivers, and other large cities. In every step they ensure that (1) the text is placed in a way that the reader easily associates it with the feature, and (2) the label does not overlap with those already placed on the map.

However, if a particular label placement problem can be formulated as a mathematical optimization problem, using mathematics to solve the problem is usually better than using a rule-based algorithm.

==Local optimization algorithms==
The simplest greedy algorithm places consecutive labels on the map in positions that result in minimal overlap of labels. Its results are not perfect even for very simple problems, but it is extremely fast.

Slightly more complex algorithms rely on local optimization to reach a local optimum of a placement evaluation function – in each iteration placement of a single label is moved to another position, and if it improves the result, the move is preserved. It performs reasonably well for maps that are not too densely labelled. Slightly more complex variations try moving 2 or more labels at the same time. The algorithm ends after reaching some local optimum.

A simple algorithm – simulated annealing – yields good results with relatively good performance. It works like local optimization, but it may keep a change even if it worsens the result. The chance of keeping such a change is formula_1, where formula_2 is the change in the evaluation function, and formula_3 is the &quot;temperature&quot;. The temperature is gradually lowered according to the &quot;annealing schedule&quot;. When the temperature is high, simulated annealing performs almost random changes to the label placement, being able to escape a local optimum. Later, when hopefully a very good local optimum has been found, it behaves in a manner similar to local optimization. The main challenges in developing a simulated annealing solution are choosing a good evaluation function and a good annealing schedule. Generally too fast cooling will degrade the solution, and too slow cooling will degrade the performance, but the schedule is usually quite a complex algorithm, with more than just one parameter.

Another class of direct search algorithms are the various evolutionary algorithms, e.g. genetic algorithms.

==Divide-and-conquer algorithms==
One simple optimization that is important on real maps is dividing a set of labels into smaller sets that can be solved independently. Two labels are &quot;rivals&quot; if they can overlap in one of the possible placements. Transitive closure of this relation divides the set of labels into possibly much smaller sets. On uniformly and densely labelled maps, usually the single set will contain the majority of labels, and on maps for which the labelling is not uniform it may bring very big performance benefits. For example, when labelling a map of the world, America is labelled independently from Eurasia etc.

==2-satisfiability algorithms==
If a map labeling problem can be reduced to a situation in which each remaining label has only two potential positions in which it can be placed, then it may be solved efficiently by using an instance of 2-satisfiability to find a placement avoiding any conflicting pairs of placements; several exact and approximate label placement algorithms for more complex types of problems are based on this principle.

==Other algorithms==
Automatic label placement algorithms can use any of the algorithms for finding the maximum disjoint set from the set of potential labels. Other algorithms can also be used, like various graph solutions, integer programming etc.

==Integer Programming==

Some versions of the map label placement problem can be formulated as multiple choices integer programming (MCIP) problems where the objective function is to minimize the sum of numerical penalties for moving individual labels away from their optimal placement to avoid overlaps. The problem constraints are that each label be placed in one of a finite number of allowed positions on the map. (Or deleted from the map to allow other labels to be placed.)

A close to optimal solution to this MCIP can usually be found in a practical amount of computer time using Lagrangian relaxation to solve the dual formulation of the optimization problem.

The first commercial solution to the map label problem, formulated as a MCIP problem and solved by Lagrangian relaxation, was to place well and seismic shot point labels on petroleum industry base maps.

Since that first solution was published there have many other mathematical optimization algorithms proposed and used to solve this MCIP for other cartographic applications.

<doc id="320026" wikidata="Q6017850" url="?curid=320026" title="Index notation">
<text>In mathematics and computer programming, index notation is used to specify the elements of an array of numbers. The formalism of how indices are used varies according to the subject. In particular, there are different methods for referring to the elements of a list, a vector, or a matrix, depending on whether one is writing a formal mathematical paper for publication, or when one is writing a computer program.

==In mathematics==

It is frequently helpful in mathematics to refer to the elements of an array using subscripts. The subscripts can be integers or variables. The array takes the form of tensors in general, since these can be treated as multi-dimensional arrays. Special (and more familiar) cases are vectors (1d arrays) and matrices (2d arrays).

The following is only an introduction to the concept: index notation is used in more detail in mathematics (particularly in the representation and manipulation of tensor operations). See the main article for further details.

===One-dimensional arrays (vectors)===

A vector treated as an array of numbers by writing as a row vector or column vector (whichever is used depends on convenience or context):

:formula_1

Index notation allows indication of the elements of the array by simply writing &quot;ai&quot;, where the index &quot;i&quot; is known to run from 1 to &quot;n&quot;, because of n-dimensions.
For example, given the vector:

:formula_2

then some entries are

:formula_3.

The notation can be applied to vectors in mathematics and physics. The following vector equation

:formula_4

can also be written in terms of the elements of the vector (aka components), that is

:formula_5

where the indices take a given range of values. This expression represents a set of equations, one for each index. If the vectors each have &quot;n&quot; elements, meaning &quot;i&quot; = 1,2,…&quot;n&quot;, then the equations are explicitly

:formula_6

Hence, index notation serves as an efficient shorthand for
#representing the general structure to an equation,
#while applicable to individual components.

===Two-dimensional arrays===


More than one index is used to describe arrays of numbers, in two or more dimensions, such as the elements of a matrix, (see also image to right);

:formula_7

The entry of a matrix A is written using two indices, say &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot;, with or without commas to separate the indices: &quot;aij&quot; or &quot;ai,j&quot;, where the first subscript is the row number and the second is the column number. Juxtaposition is also used as notation for multiplication; this may be a source of confusion. For example, if

:formula_8

then some entries are

:formula_9.

For indices larger than 9, the comma-based notation may be preferable (e.g., &quot;a&quot;3,12 instead of &quot;a&quot;312).

Matrix equations are written similarly to vector equations, such as

:formula_10

in terms of the elements of the matrices (aka components)

:formula_11

for all values of &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot;. Again this expression represents a set of equations, one for each index. If the matrices each have &quot;m&quot; rows and &quot;n&quot; columns, meaning and , then there are &quot;mn&quot; equations.

===Multi-dimensional arrays===


The notation allows a clear generalization to multi-dimensional arrays of elements: tensors. For example,

:formula_12

representing a set of many equations.

In tensor analysis, superscripts are used instead of subscripts to distinguish covariant from contravariant entities, see covariance and contravariance of vectors and raising and lowering indices.

==In computing==
In several programming languages, index notation is a way of addressing elements of an array. This method is used since it is closest to how it is implemented in assembly language whereby the address of the first element is used as a base, and a multiple (the index) of the element size is used to address inside the array.

For example, if an array of integers is stored in a region of the computer&#x27;s memory starting at the memory cell with address 3000 (the base address), and each integer occupies four cells (bytes), then the elements of this array are at memory locations 0x3000, 0x3004, 0x3008, …, 0x3000 + 4(&quot;n&quot; − 1) (note the zero-based numbering). In general, the address of the &quot;i&quot;th element of an array with base address &quot;b&quot; and element size &quot;s&quot; is .

==Implementation details==
In the C programming language, we can write the above as (pointer form) or (array indexing form), which is exactly equivalent because the C standard defines the array indexing form as a transformation to pointer form. Coincidentally, since pointer addition is commutative, this allows for obscure expressions such as which is equivalent to .

===Multidimensional arrays===
Things become more interesting when we consider arrays with more than one index, for example, a two-dimensional table. We have three possibilities:
* make the two-dimensional array one-dimensional by computing a single index from the two
* consider a one-dimensional array where each element is another one-dimensional array, i.e. an array of arrays
* use additional storage to hold the array of addresses of each row of the original array, and store the rows of the original array as separate one-dimensional arrays
In C, all three methods can be used. When the first method is used, the programmer decides how the elements of the array are laid out in the computer&#x27;s memory, and provides the formulas to compute the location of each element. The second method is used when the number of elements in each row is the same and known at the time the program is written. The programmer declares the array to have, say, three columns by writing e.g. . One then refers to a particular element of the array by writing . The compiler computes the total number of memory cells occupied by each row, uses the first index to find the address of the desired row, and then uses the second index to find the address of the desired element in the row. When the third method is used, the programmer declares the table to be an array of pointers, like in . When the programmer subsequently specifies a particular element , the compiler generates instructions to look up the address of the row specified by the first index, and use this address as the base when computing the address of the element specified by the second index.

void mult3x3f(float result[][3], const float A[][3], const float B[][3])
 int i, j, k;
 for (i = 0; i &lt; 3; ++i) {
 for (j = 0; j &lt; 3; ++j) {
 result[i][j] = 0;
 for (k = 0; k &lt; 3; ++k)
 result[i][j] += A[i][k] * B[k][j];
 }


==In other languages==
In other programming languages such as Pascal, indices may start at 1, so indexing in a block of memory can be changed to fit a start-at-1 addressing scheme by a simple linear transformation – in this scheme, the memory location of the &quot;i&quot;th element with base address &quot;b&quot; and element size &quot;s&quot; is .

<text>Wild Greens are a green political youth movement.

The movement began in 1997 when the Wild Greens, a semi-autonomous youth wing of the Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand, formed. New Zealand&#x27;s Wild Greens, unlike their parent party, were committed to direct action and taking risks of bodily harm to protect the environment. The Wild Greens later disaffiliated from the Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand, with the party&#x27;s youth arm being renamed to Young Greens. The Wild Greens movement has since spread from New Zealand to Canada, Australia, and elsewhere in the English-speaking world. Members of Wild Green groups are strongly associated with the anti-globalisation movement.

<text>Waterkeeper Alliance is a worldwide network of environmental organizations founded in 1999 that work to protect bodies of water around the United States and the world. By December 2019, the group said it had grown to 350 members in 46 countries, with half the membership outside the U.S.; the alliance had added 200 groups in the last five years. 

In 1983, the founding Riverkeeper organization, founded by Robert H. Boyle, formed around the Hudson River in New York, in response to the untreated sewage and industrial water pollution that was degrading water quality in the river. Today, Waterkeeper Alliance, founded by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and based in Manhattan, unites all Waterkeeper organizations. The group helps to coordinate and cover issues affecting Waterkeepers that work to protect rivers, lakes, bays, sounds, and other water bodies around the world. In the United States, only 52 of the 180 groups cover watersheds west of the Mississippi River.

In June 2019, the group announced a project with online travel website Culture Trip called &quot;Waterkeeper Warriors.&quot; They named 20 activists who “represent the impact one person can make on an issue that affects us all.&quot;

<doc id="320032" wikidata="Q7317309" url="?curid=320032" title="Return to Mayberry">
<text>Return to Mayberry is a 1986 American made-for-television romantic comedy film based on the 1960s sitcoms &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot; and &quot;Mayberry R.F.D.&quot;. The film premiered on April 13, 1986, on NBC, and was the highest-rated television film of 1986. Sixteen of the original cast members reunited and reprised their roles for the film and its success could have led to additional Mayberry programs, but Griffith was committed to &quot;Matlock&quot; (also airing on NBC at the time) for the 1986–87 season.

Most of the characters from the old series are revisited. The slightly milquetoast Howard Sprague (Jack Dodson), in an attempt to look younger, is seen in various hues of hair color. Gomer Pyle (Jim Nabors), having returned to civilian life following his stint in the Marines, operates a local service station along with his cousin Goober (George Lindsey), and the pair is seen together for only the third time in the history of the franchise (after having previously only been shown together in the episode &quot;Fun Girls&quot; and an episode of &quot;Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.&quot;). Howard Morris and Denver Pyle reprise the hillbilly roles of Ernest T. Bass and Briscoe Darling, respectively, along with Maggie Peterson and The Dillards as the rest of the Darling family. Otis Campbell (Hal Smith), the former town drunk, has become sober and now drives an ice cream truck. The film serves as the series finale to &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;, as no further episodes were made to continue from where it left off.

==Plot==
Having retired from a position as a postal inspector in Cleveland, Ohio, Andy Taylor (Andy Griffith) returns to his native Mayberry N.C. to see his son Opie (Ron Howard) become a first-time father. He also intends to run in the soon-to-be held sheriff&#x27;s election. When Andy learns that his old deputy Barney Fife (Don Knotts), now back in Mayberry himself serving as acting sheriff, has announced his own candidacy, Andy tells Opie that he won&#x27;t run against Barney.

Barney tells Andy that he decided to run for sheriff because nobody else would. Andy mentions that Barney&#x27;s old girlfriend Thelma Lou, now divorced, is back in Mayberry. As Barney leaves to teach a safety class at school, they encounter Ernest T. Bass who gives them a cryptic rhyme: &quot;Your hair was brown but now it&#x27;s gray; make that monster go away.&quot; The &quot;monster&quot; is an elaborate publicity stunt orchestrated by businessman Wally Butler (Richard Lineback), who bought a restaurant outside of town and added a hotel.

Andy goes to the cemetery to visit Aunt Bee&#x27;s grave, and finds Thelma Lou there visiting her uncle&#x27;s gravesite. They go to the school where Barney is teaching. While Barney and Thelma Lou get reacquainted, Andy drives over to Opie and his wife Eunice&#x27;s house just as she is about to go into labor. They are unable to get to the hospital in time, and Andy delivers his grandson in the back of the car.

The next day, Gomer and Goober are out fishing at Myers Lake when Gomer sees a monster stick its head up out of the water. Andy and Barney arrive shortly afterward, but Barney doesn&#x27;t believe Gomer&#x27;s story until he sees what looks like monster tracks in the mud. When Gomer later shows Barney a picture he took of Goober with something unidentifiable in the background, Barney becomes convinced there is a monster in the lake.

With Barney&#x27;s opponent Woods now running an aggressive campaign to discredit Barney, Howard and Opie try to convince Andy to re-enter the race. Meanwhile, former town drunk Otis Campbell (Hal Smith), now long sober and driving an ice cream truck, is serving customers near Myers Lake when he sees the &quot;monster&quot; pop out of the lake. Otis races to the courthouse to tell Barney. Despite Andy&#x27;s pleading with Barney to end his quest because people were laughing at him, Otis&#x27; report convinces Barney to resume the hunt for the monster.

At Butler&#x27;s Inn, Andy notices a picture with a dragon&#x27;s head in it and remembering Ernest T.&#x27;s rhyme, Andy drives up to the Darlings&#x27; homestead, where Ernest T. now hangs out. Briscoe Darling (Denver Pyle) and his daughter Charlene (Maggie Peterson) are delighted to see Andy. Andy manipulates Ernest T. into telling him when the monster will show up in Myers Lake again.

At the lake, while Barney baits a trap, Andy spots Ernest T. going into a nearby stone quarry shed. Butler arrives at the shed to futilely get Ernest T. to reel the monster back in, but Andy catches both of them in the act. Barney and Howard follow Andy to the shed, and Andy makes it look like Barney plotted to make Butler overconfident and force his hand. Butler had found some old dragon artifacts, presumably left by the restaurant&#x27;s former owners, and hired Ernest T. to instigate a hoax at Myers Lake to attract customers.

Howard takes pictures of Barney with the dragon&#x27;s head for the newspaper, and Andy tells Butler about the legal consequences of his actions.

Later, at a campaign rally for Acting Sheriff Fife, Barney learns that Andy opted out of the sheriff&#x27;s race to give Barney a better chance to win, he humbly asks the crowd to vote for Andy as a write-in candidate because &quot;That&#x27;s exactly what I&#x27;m gonna do.&quot; Andy is eventually elected sheriff, and promptly reappoints Barney as Deputy. Opie accepts a newspaper job in Binghamton, and Barney and Thelma Lou finally get married, with Ernest T. and the Darlings joining in the celebration.

The final shot (seen behind the end credits) is of Sheriff Taylor and Deputy Fife folding up an American flag at the end of the day on Mayberry&#x27;s Main Street.

==Production==

Most of the surviving cast members of &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot; reprised their roles in the reunion movie. One notable exception was Frances Bavier, who played Aunt Bee for all eight seasons as well as two seasons of &quot;Mayberry R.F.D.&quot; Bavier had retired shortly after leaving &quot;R.F.D.&quot; in 1970. Her absence was explained by a scene in which Andy visits the cemetery where Aunt Bee is buried, confirming that Aunt Bee is deceased. Aunt Bee is voiced by Janet Waldo in the scene. The official reason given for Bavier&#x27;s absence was poor health (she died in 1989).

Rance Howard, Ron Howard&#x27;s father, played the Preacher, and Karen Knotts, Don Knotts&#x27; daughter, played a receptionist.

Ron Howard, playing an adult Opie, had quit his acting career by this point to focus on being a film director, and had already directed the hit movies &quot;Night Shift&quot; (1982), and &quot;Splash&quot; (1984) (the latter of which even featured &quot;Griffith&quot; co-star Howard Morris in a cameo role). As of 2023, &quot;Return to Mayberry&quot; remains the last significant acting role for Howard.

The Forty Acres backlot in Culver City, California, where most of the Mayberry exteriors were filmed in the original series, had been razed in 1976. For this movie, the town of Los Olivos, California doubled for Mayberry, with a stretch of Grand Avenue being used for the town square. A reconstruction of the original courthouse set was built in a small park at the corner of Grand and Alamo Pintado Avenues. The mid-intersection flagpole seen repeatedly in the movie is a veterans memorial that was built in Los Olivos shortly after World War I.

==Ratings and reception==
&quot;Return to Mayberry&quot; premiered on April 13, 1986 at 9:00pm (ET/PT) as part of &quot;NBC Sunday Night at the Movies&quot;, and earned a Nielsen rating of 33.0, meaning around one-third of the TV-viewing public had tuned in to the broadcast. It became the top-rated made-for-TV movie of the 1985-86 season, and the second most-watched program that week (behind &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;).

Although &quot;Return to Mayberry&quot; was a ratings success, its critical reception was mixed. A review in &quot;The New York Times&quot; opined that its &quot;slow pace, extremely modest level of humor and straightforward and predictable plotting make &quot;Return to Mayberry&quot; a less appealing reunion for the audience than it may have been for its actors.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; discussed the film only when it was in its last days of production, saying, &quot;Even on TV&#x27;s crowded reunion calendar, &quot;Return to Mayberry&quot; is a special event&quot;, but offering no substantive comment on the merits of the finished product.

More recent reviews have been kinder, calling it &quot;marvelous blast from the past&quot; and a reunion that &quot;worked largely because the producers kept the original flavour of the series yet brought the show up to date&quot;.

==2004 re-broadcast==
&quot;Mayberry&quot; was rebroadcast on Veterans Day in 2004 by some ABC affiliates as a replacement for the network&#x27;s unedited rebroadcast of the film &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;. &quot;Ryan&quot; included language which the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) had ruled &quot;indecent and profane&quot; in March 2004, and &quot;Mayberry&quot; was seen as a safer alternative, despite the fact that &quot;Ryan&quot; had already aired on the network in 2001 and 2002. The chief executive of Citadel Communications — the main affiliate owner to rebroadcast &quot;Mayberry&quot; — cited the recent 2004 US Presidential election as a justification. &quot;We&#x27;re just coming off an election where moral issues were cited as a reason by people voting one way or another&quot;, the executive said, &quot;and, in my opinion, the commissioners are fearful of the new Congress.&quot; In the end, however, no complaints were lodged against ABC affiliates which showed &quot;Ryan&quot;, perhaps because even conservative watchdogs like the Parents Television Council supported the unedited rebroadcast of the film.

==Confusion with later reunion projects==
In 2003, four surviving principal cast members (Griffith, Howard, Knotts, and Nabors) came together for a reunion special that featured the actors reminiscing about their time on the show. The production was interspersed with archival footage and short filmed interviews with some of the other surviving cast members. This special was called &quot;The Andy Griffith Show: Back to Mayberry&quot;. Some media outlets have occasionally called this show, too, &quot;Return to Mayberry&quot;, which led to some confusion between the two productions. The title, &quot;The Andy Griffith Show: Back to Mayberry&quot;, distinguishes this production from a 1993 production titled &quot;The Andy Griffith Show Reunion&quot;.

==Home media==
The film was originally released on VHS in 1989 by Forum Home Video under license from Viacom (). A budget release from Video Treasures followed. It was released again in 1994 by Regent Entertainment ().

In 2007, the film was released on DVD as a bonus feature included with &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot; box set (), in 2010 as a special feature on the DVD &quot;The Andy Griffith Show 50th Anniversary: The Best of Mayberry&quot;, and on Blu-ray in 2014 as a special feature on &quot;The Andy Griffith Show: Season 1&quot;.

It was released individually on DVD on June 13, 2017.
