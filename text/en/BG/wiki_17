<text>The New York metropolitan area, broadly referred to as the Tri-State area and often also called Greater New York, is the largest metropolitan economy in the world, with a gross metropolitan product of over US$2.6 trillion, and the largest metropolitan area in the world by urban landmass, encompassing . The New York metropolitan area is one of the most populous metropolitan areas in the world, the largest metropolitan area in the U.S., and the only U.S. metropolitan area home to more than 20 million residents as of the 2020 United States census.

The vast metropolitan area includes New York City and the rest of Downstate New York (Long Island and the mid and lower Hudson Valley), northern and central New Jersey (including its eleven largest municipalities), and western Connecticut (including six of its seven largest cities). The phrase Tri-State area is usually used to refer to New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut, although an increasing number of people who work in New York City commute from Pennsylvania, particularly from the Lehigh Valley, Bucks County, and Poconos regions in eastern Pennsylvania, making the metropolitan area span across four states. The New York metropolitan area is the geographic and demographic hub of the larger Northeast megalopolis.

The New York metropolitan area is the most populous metropolitan statistical area in the United States with 20.1 million residents, or slightly over 6% of the nation&#x27;s total population, as of 2020. The combined statistical area includes 23.6 million residents as of 2020. It is one of the largest urban agglomerations in the world. The New York metropolitan area continues to be the premier gateway for legal immigration to the United States, having the largest foreign-born population of any metropolitan region in the world. The metropolitan statistical area covers while the combined statistical area is , encompassing an ethnically and geographically diverse region. The New York metropolitan area&#x27;s population is larger than that of the state of New York, and the metropolitan airspace accommodated over 130 million passengers in 2016.

Greater New York, known as the financial capital of the world, is also the hub of multiple industries, including health care, pharmaceuticals, and scientific output in life sciences, international trade, publishing, real estate, education, fashion, entertainment, tourism, law, and manufacturing; and if the New York metropolitan area were an independent sovereign state, it would constitute the eighth-largest economy in the world. It is the most prominent financial, diplomatic, and media hub in the world.

According to &quot;Forbes&quot;, in 2014, the New York metropolitan area was home to eight of the top ten ZIP Codes in the United States by median housing price, with six in Manhattan alone. The New York metropolitan area is known for its varied landscape and natural beauty, and contains five of the top ten richest places in America, according to Bloomberg. These are Scarsdale, New York; Short Hills, New Jersey; Old Greenwich, Connecticut; Bronxville, New York; and Darien, Connecticut. The New York metropolitan region&#x27;s higher education network comprises hundreds of colleges and universities, including campuses of four Ivy League universities: Columbia, Princeton, Yale, and Cornell (at Cornell Tech and Weill Cornell Medicine); the flagship campuses of public universities systems at Stony Brook (SUNY) and Rutgers (New Jersey); and globally-ranked New York University, Rockefeller University, and Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

==Definitions==

===Metropolitan statistical area===
The counties and county groupings constituting the New York metropolitan area are listed below, with 2010 census figures:


The U.S. Office of Management and Budget utilizes two definitions of the urbanized area: the metropolitan statistical area (MSA) and the combined statistical area (CSA). The MSA definition is titled the &quot;New York-Newark-Jersey City, NY-NJ-PA Metropolitan Statistical Area&quot;, and includes a population of 20.3 million people by 2017 Census estimates, roughly 1 in 16 Americans and nearly 7 million more than the second-place Los Angeles metropolitan area in the United States. The MSA is further subdivided into four metropolitan divisions. The 23-county MSA includes 10 counties in New York State (coextensive with the five boroughs of New York, the two remaining counties of Long Island, and three counties in the Lower Hudson Valley); 12 counties in Northern and Central New Jersey; and one county in northeastern Pennsylvania. The largest urbanized area in the United States is at the heart of the metropolitan area, the &quot;New York–Newark, NY–NJ–CT Urbanized Area&quot;, which had a land area of 3,450 square miles in 2010 according to the 2010 census. The New York State portion of the metropolitan area, which includes the five boroughs of New York City, the lower Hudson Valley, and Long Island, accounts for over 65 percent of the state&#x27;s population.

=== Combined statistical area===
Combined statistical areas (CSAs) group together adjacent core-based statistical areas with a high degree of economic interconnection. The New York–Newark, NY–NJ–CT–PA Combined Statistical Area had an estimated population of 23.7 million as of 2014. About one out of every fifteen Americans resides in this region, which includes eight additional counties in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania. This area, less the Pennsylvania portion, is often referred to as the &quot;tri-state area&quot; and less commonly the &quot;tri-state region&quot;. The New York City television designated market area (DMA) includes Pike County, Pennsylvania, which is also included in the CSA.

In addition to the New York–Newark–Jersey City, NY–NJ–PA metropolitan statistical areas (MSA), the following core-based statistical areas are also included in the New York–Newark, NY–NJ–CT–PA CSA:
* Bridgeport–Stamford–Danbury, CT MSA (916,829)
** Fairfield County
* New Haven–Milford, CT MSA (862,477)
** New Haven County, Connecticut
* Trenton–Princeton, NJ MSA (396,811)
** Mercer County
* Torrington, CT micropolitan statistical area (189,927)
** Litchfield County
* Kingston, NY MSA (182,693)
** Ulster County
* Kiryas Joel–Poughkeepsie–Newburgh, NY MSA (670,301)
** Dutchess County
** Orange County, NY

==Geography==
The area is frequently divided into the following subregions:
* New York City (the primary urban center of the metropolitan region, comprising five boroughs, one of which is Manhattan, the geographical, cultural, and economic core of the entire metropolitan area)
* Central and eastern Long Island (Nassau and Suffolk Counties – separated by water from the rest of the region except New York City; not including Queens County or Kings County (Brooklyn), which are concurrent with two of New York&#x27;s five boroughs)
* North Jersey (northern portion of New Jersey)
* Central Jersey (middle portion of New Jersey)
* Hudson Valley (Lower Hudson Valley suburbs of Westchester, Putnam, and Rockland Counties; and Mid-Hudson exurbs of Dutchess, Sullivan, Orange, and Ulster Counties)
* Western Connecticut (Only Fairfield, New Haven, and Litchfield Counties are part of the region and separated by the state line)
* Southern and Eastern Poconos (Monroe and Pike Counties in Pennsylvania)

All eight subregions are often further subdivided. For instance, Long Island can be divided into its South and North Shores (usually when speaking about Nassau County and western Suffolk County) and the East End. The Hudson Valley and Connecticut are sometimes grouped together and referred to as the Northern Suburbs, largely because of the shared usage of the Metro-North Railroad system.

===Climate===
Under the Köppen climate classification, New York City, western (and parts of eastern) Long Island, and the Jersey Shore experience a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;), and New York is thus the northernmost major city on the North American continent with this climate type.

Much of the remainder of the metropolitan area lies in the transition zone from a humid subtropical (&quot;Cfa&quot;) to a humid continental climate (&quot;Dfa&quot;), and it is only the inland, more exurban areas far to the north and west such as Sussex County, New Jersey, that have a January daily average of or below and are fully humid continental; the &quot;Dfb&quot; (warm summer subtype) regime is only found inland at a higher elevation, and receives greater snowfall than the &quot;Dfa&quot; region. Much of Monroe and most of Pike County in Pennsylvania also have a fully humid continental climate.

Summers in the area are typically hot and humid. Nighttime conditions in and around the five boroughs of New York are often exacerbated by the urban heat island phenomenon, and temperatures exceed on average of 7–8 days (on the immediate Long Island Sound and Atlantic coasts), up to in excess of 27 days (inland suburbs in New Jersey) each summer and may exceed . Normally, warm to hot temperatures begin in mid-May, and last through early October. Summers also feature passing thundershowers which build in the heat of the day and then drop brief, but intense, rainfall.

Winters are cold with a mix of rain and snow. Although prevailing winds in winter are offshore, and temper the moderating effects of the Atlantic Ocean, the Atlantic and the partial shielding by the Appalachians from colder air keep the New York area warmer in the winter than inland North American metropolitan areas located at similar or lesser latitudes including Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, and Indianapolis. Warm periods with + temperatures may occasionally occur during winter as well. The hardiness zone in the New York metropolitan area varies over a wide range from 5a in the highest areas of Dutchess, Monroe, and Ulster Counties to 7b in most of NYC as well as Hudson County from Bayonne up the east side of the Palisades to Route 495, the majority of Nassau County, the north coast of Monmouth County, and Copiague Harbor, Lindenhurst, and Montauk in Suffolk County.

Almost all of the metropolitan area receives at least of precipitation annually, which is relatively evenly spread throughout the year, and many areas receive upwards of . Average winter snowfall for 1981 to 2010 ranges from just under along the coast of Long Island to more than in some inland areas, but this usually varies considerably from year to year. Hurricanes and tropical storms have impacted the Tri-State area in the past, though a direct hit is rare. Several areas on Long Island, New Jersey, and the Connecticut coast have been impacted by serious storm surges in the past. Inland areas have been impacted by heavy rain and flooding from tropical cyclones.

The New York metropolitan area averages 234 days with at least some sunshine and 59% of possible sunlight annually, accumulating 2,400 to 2,800 hours of sunshine per annum.







==Subregions==
=== New York City ===
The geographical, cultural, and economic center of the metropolitan area is New York City, the most populous city in the United States and has been described as the capital of the world. The city consists of five boroughs, each of which is coterminous with a county of New York State. The five boroughs – Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, the Bronx, and Staten Island – were consolidated into a single city in 1898. With a Census-estimated population of 8,335,897 in 2022 (8,467,513 in 2021), distributed over a land area of just , New York is the most densely populated major city in the United States. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, health care and life sciences, media, dining, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term &quot;&quot;. Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy. New York is a global city and has been described as the cultural, financial, entertainment, and media capital of the world, as well as the world&#x27;s most economically powerful city.

=== Long Island ===


Long Island, the most populous island in the United States, is located just off the northeast coast of the United States and is a region wholly included within both the U.S. state of New York and the New York metropolitan area. Extending 118 miles east-northeast of Roosevelt Island, Manhattan from New York Harbor into the Atlantic Ocean, the island comprises four counties: Kings and Queens (these form the New York boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens, respectively) to the west; then Nassau and Suffolk to the east. However, most people in the New York metropolitan area (even those living in Queens and Brooklyn) colloquially use the term &quot;Long Island&quot; (or &quot;The Island&quot;) exclusively to refer to Nassau County and Suffolk County collectively, which are mainly suburban in character. North of the island is Long Island Sound, across which are the U.S. states of Connecticut and Rhode Island.

With a population of 8,063,232 enumerated at the 2020 U.S. Census, constituting nearly 40% of New York State&#x27;s population, the majority of New York City residents, 58.4% as of 2020, live on Long Island, namely the estimated 4,896,398 residents living in the New York City boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens. Long Island is the most populated island in any U.S. state or territory, and the 17th-most populous island in the world (ahead of Ireland, Jamaica, and Hokkaidō). Its population density is . If Long Island geographically constituted an independent metropolitan statistical area, it would rank fourth most populous in the United States; while if it were a U.S. state, Long Island would rank 13th in population and first in population density. Queens is the most ethnically diverse urban area in the world. The Town of Hempstead in Nassau County, with an estimated population of 770,367 in 2016, is the most populous municipality in the New York metropolitan area outside of New York City.

Long Island is also the 17th most populous island in the world, but is more prominently known for recreation, boating, and miles of public beaches, including numerous town, county, and state parks, as well as Fire Island National Seashore and wealthy and expensive coastal residential enclaves. Along the north shore, the Gold Coast of Long Island, featured in the film &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;, is an upscale section of Nassau and western Suffolk counties that once featured many lavish mansions built and inhabited by wealthy business tycoons in the earlier years of the 20th century, of which only a few remain preserved as historic sites. The East End of Long Island (known as the &quot;Twin Forks&quot; because of its physical shape) boasts open spaces for farmland and wineries. The South Fork, in particular, comprises numerous towns and villages known collectively as &quot;The Hamptons&quot; and has an international reputation as a &quot;playground for the rich and famous&quot;, with some of the wealthiest communities in the United States. In 2015, according to &quot;Business Insider&quot;, the 11962 zip code encompassing Sagaponack, within Southampton, was listed as the most expensive in the U.S. by real estate-listings site Property Shark, with a median home sale price of $5,125,000.

During the summer season, many celebrities and the wealthy visit or reside in mansions and waterfront homes, while others spend weekends enjoying the beaches, gardens, bars, restaurants, and nightclubs.

Long Island is served by a network of parkways and expressways, with the Long Island Expressway, Northern State Parkway, and Southern State Parkway being major east–west routes across significant portions of the island. Commuter rail access is provided by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) Long Island Rail Road, one of the largest commuter railroads in the United States. Air travel needs are served by several airports. Within Queens, the island is home to John F. Kennedy International Airport and LaGuardia Airport, two of the three major airline hubs serving the New York area (with Newark Liberty International Airport being the third; all three major airports are operated by The Port Authority of New York &amp; New Jersey). Long Island MacArthur Airport (serving commercial airlines) and Farmingdale/Republic Airport (private and commuter flights) are both located in Suffolk County.

=== Lower Hudson Valley ===

Known for its hilly terrain, picturesque settings, and quaint small towns and villages, the Lower Hudson Valley is centered around the Hudson River north of New York City and lies within New York State. Westchester and Putnam counties are located on the eastern side of the river, and Rockland and Orange counties are located on the western side of the river. Westchester and Rockland counties are connected by the heavily trafficked New Tappan Zee Bridge, as well as by the Bear Mountain Bridge near their northern ends. Several branches of the MTA Metro-North Railroad serve the region&#x27;s rail commuters. Southern Westchester County contains more densely populated areas and includes the cities of Yonkers, Mount Vernon, New Rochelle, and White Plains. Many of the suburban communities of Westchester are known for their affluence and expense (some examples: Bronxville, Scarsdale, Chappaqua, Armonk, Pound Ridge, Katonah, and Briarcliff Manor). Rockland&#x27;s river towns along the Hudson, including Nyack and Piermont, are known for their vibrant dining and art scenes. 30% of Rockland&#x27;s land area is designated parkland with impressive scenery, which attracts many visitors from the tristate area. In recent years, the high cost of housing in the Lower Hudson Valley, plus increased remote working opportunities, has caused some to move further north into the Mid Hudson Valley.

Historically, the valley was home to many factories, including paper mills, but a significant number have closed. After years of lingering pollution, cleanup efforts to improve the Hudson River water quality are currently planned and will be supervised by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

=== Mid-Hudson Valley ===
The Mid-Hudson Valley region of the State of New York is midway between New York City and the state capital of Albany. The area includes the counties of Dutchess, Ulster, and Sullivan, as well as the northern portions of Orange County, with the region&#x27;s main cities being Poughkeepsie, Newburgh, Kingston, and Beacon. The Walkway over the Hudson, is the second longest pedestrian footbridge in the world. It crosses the Hudson River connecting Poughkeepsie and Highland. The 13 mile-long Dutchess Rail Trail stretches from Hopewell Junction to the beginning of the Walkway over the Hudson in Poughkeepsie. The area is home to the Wappingers Central School District, which the second-largest school district in the state of New York. The Newburgh Waterfront in the City of Newburgh is home to many high-end restaurants.

U.S. Route 9, I-84, and the Taconic State Parkway all run through Dutchess County. Metro-North Railroad train station, New Hamburg, is located in the Town of Poughkeepsie and runs from Poughkeepsie to Grand Central Terminal in New York City.

=== Northern New Jersey ===
Northern New Jersey, also known colloquially as North Jersey, is typically defined as comprising the following counties:
* Bergen County
* Essex County
* Somerset County (anything north of Bridgewater Township)
* Hudson County
* Hunterdon County (anything north of Readington Township)
* Morris County
* Passaic County
* Sussex County
* Union County (anything north of Scotch Plains Township, Clark Township, and Linden)
* Warren County

The New Jersey State Department of Tourism splits North Jersey into the urban Gateway Region and the more rural Skylands Region. Northern New Jersey is home to four of the largest cities of that state: Newark, Jersey City, Paterson, and Elizabeth.

The region is geographically diverse with wetlands, mountains, and valleys throughout the area. It has a large network of expressways and public transportation rail services, mostly operated by New Jersey Transit. Northern New Jersey also contains the second busiest airport in the New York metropolitan area, Newark Liberty International Airport.

Although it is a suburban and rural region of New York, much of the Gateway Region is highly urbanized. The entirety of Hudson County, eastern Essex County, southern Passaic County as well as Elizabeth in Union County are all densely populated areas.

=== Central New Jersey ===


Central Jersey is the middle portion of New Jersey. It generally comprises the following counties:

* Middlesex County
* Mercer County
* Monmouth County
* Ocean County (anything north of Toms River)
* Union County (anything south of Scotch Plains Township, Clark Township, and Linden)
* Hunterdon County (anything south of Readington Township)
* Somerset County (anything south of Bridgewater Township)

Notable municipalities in the region include Trenton (the state capital of New Jersey and the only U.S. state capital within the New York metropolitan area), Princeton (home to the Ivy League Princeton University), New Brunswick (home of Rutgers University&#x27;s main New Brunswick campus, the largest university in New Jersey), Lakewood (home to the Beth Medrash Govoha, the largest yeshiva outside of Israel), and Edison (the original home and research laboratory for Thomas Edison in &quot;Menlo Park&quot;, (currently located in Edison State Park), where inventions such as the phonograph, the motion-picture camera, and the incandescent light bulb, were invented). The region also encompasses a significant portion of the Jersey Shore, including the cities of Red Bank, Long Branch, and Asbury Park. Major transportation links in Central Jersey include the New Jersey Turnpike, the Garden State Parkway, US 1, US 9, and the Northeast Corridor. All of these aforementioned routes bisect each other in the bustling suburb and commercial hub of Woodbridge.
=== Western Connecticut ===
Fairfield, New Haven, and Litchfield counties in western Connecticut (like the state in general) are known for affluence. Large businesses are scattered throughout the area, mostly in Fairfield County. The land is flat along the coast with low hills eventually giving way to larger hills such as The Berkshires further inland, to the Massachusetts border. Most of the largest cities in the state are in New Haven County (home to Yale University) and Fairfield County.

Candlewood Lake is the largest recreational lake in the New York metropolitan area. The lake is located within the Greater Danbury region, and is home to many second homes of New York City residents.

=== Pike County, Pennsylvania ===
Pike County, Pennsylvania is located in Northeastern Pennsylvania. As of the 2010 Census, the population was 57,369. Its county seat is Milford. Part of the Pocono Mountains region lies within Pike County, which has ranked among the fastest-growing counties of Pennsylvania.

This county was detached from the New York-Newark-Jersey City MSA in September 2023 and now forms the Hemlock Farms, PA μSA.
==Communities==
===Main cities and towns===


The following is a list of &quot;principal cities&quot; and their respective population estimates from the 2020 U.S. Census. Principal cities include those with populations over 100,000 or major job, cultural, educational, and economic centers.
===Urban areas===


==History==

During the Wisconsinan glaciation, the region was situated at the edge of a large ice sheet over 1,000 feet in depth. The ice sheet scraped away large amounts of soil, leaving the bedrock that serves as the geologic foundation for much of the New York metropolitan region today. Later on, the ice sheet would help split apart what are now Long Island and Staten Island.
At the time of European contact the region was inhabited by Native Americans, predominantly the Lenape, and others. The Native Americans used the abundant waterways in the area for many purposes, such as fishing and trade routes. Sailing for France in 1524, Giovanni da Verrazzano was the first European to enter the local waters and encounter the residents, but he did not make landfall. Henry Hudson, sailing for the Dutch in 1609, visited the area and built a settlement on Lower Manhattan Island that was eventually renamed New Amsterdam by Dutch colonists in 1626. In 1664, the area went under English control, and was later renamed &quot;New York&quot; after King Charles II of England granted the lands to his brother, the Duke of York.

As the fur trade expanded further north, New York became a trading hub, which brought in a diverse set of ethnic groups including Africans, Jews, and Portuguese. The island of Manhattan had an extraordinary natural harbor formed by New York Bay (actually the drowned lower river valley of the Hudson River, enclosed by glacial moraines), the East River, which is a tidal strait, and the Hudson River, all of which merge at the southern tip, from which all later development spread. During the American Revolution, the strategic waterways made New York vitally important as a wartime base for the British navy. Many battles such as the Battle of Long Island and the Battle of New York were fought in the region to secure it. New York was captured by the British early in the war, becoming a haven for Loyalist refugees from other parts of the country, and remained in the hands of the British until the war ended in 1783. New York served as the capital of the United States from 1785 until 1790, after which the capital moved to Philadelphia. New York has been the country&#x27;s largest city since 1790. In 1792, the Buttonwood Agreement, made by a group of merchants, created what is now the New York Stock Exchange in Lower Manhattan. Today, many people in the metropolitan area work in this important stock exchange.
The Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor greeted millions of immigrants as they came to America by ship in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and is a globally recognized symbol of the United States and its democracy. Large-scale immigration into New York was a result of a large demand for manpower. A cosmopolitan attitude in the city created tolerance for various cultures and ethnic groups. German, Irish, and Italian immigrants were among the largest ethnic groups. Today, many of their descendants continue to live in the region. Cultural buildings such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Metropolitan Opera, and the American Museum of Natural History were built. New York newspapers were read around the country as media moguls James Gordon Bennett, Sr., Joseph Pulitzer and William Randolph Hearst battled for readership. In 1884, over 70% of exports passed through ports in New York or in one of the surrounding towns. The five boroughs of New York — The Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, and Staten Island — were consolidated into a single city in 1898.
The newly unified New York City encouraged both more physical connections between the boroughs and the growth of bedroom communities. The New York City Subway began operating in 1904 as the Interborough Rapid Transit Company, one of three systems (the other two being the Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit Corporation and the Independent Subway System) that were later taken over by the city. Railroad stations such as Grand Central Terminal and Pennsylvania Station helped fuel suburban growth. During the era of the Prohibition, when alcohol was banned nationwide, organized crime grew to supply the high demand for bootleg alcohol. The Broadway Theater District began to develop with the opening of the New York Subway in 1904 and, by the early part of the twentieth century, had been made world-famous as New York&#x27;s theatrical and entertainment center through popular musical productions like Ziegfeld Follies and &quot;Show Boat&quot; and the opening of multiple large, extravagantly decorated theatres in the area spanning Broadway from 47th to 42nd Streets.

The Great Depression suspended the region&#x27;s fortunes as a period of widespread unemployment and poverty began. City planner Robert Moses began his automobile-centered career of building bridges, parkways, and later expressways across the tri-state area. During World War II, the city economy was hurt by blockades of German U-boats, which limited shipping with Europe.
After its population peaked in 1950, a significant portion of the city&#x27;s population left for the suburbs of New York over the following decades. The effects were a result of white flight. Industry and commerce also declined in this era, with businesses relocating to the suburbs or other regions. The era also saw an increase in the construction of housing projects for the city&#x27;s low-income population under the New York City Housing Authority, coinciding with the destruction of communities to construct interstate highways to link the city with its suburbs. The city, particularly Brooklyn, was dealt a psychological as well as an economic blow with the loss of the iconic Brooklyn Dodgers major-league baseball team, which moved to Los Angeles after the 1957 season. Crime affected the city severely. Urban renewal projects alleviated decay in poorer neighborhoods to a certain extent, but many of these later proved to be failures and caused unanticipated consequences like ghettoization, informal racial segregation in housing, and disruption of the organic urban fabric that made the city&#x27;s neighborhoods cohesive and healthy places to live. There was little reported social unrest during the Northeast Blackout of 1965, but the New York City Blackout of 1977 led to massive rioting, looting, and arson in some parts of the city. In addition, the 1970s recession crippled traditional industries such as manufacturing in the New York City region. A rare positive highlight of the period was the completion of the original World Trade Center, a massive office complex in New York&#x27;s Financial District whose iconic, 110-story Twin Towers for a short time stood as the world&#x27;s tallest buildings.

In the 1980s, the city&#x27;s economy was booming, particularly in the financial sector. Wall Street was fueling an economic surge in the real estate market, and later the dot-com bubble. Despite this, crime was still an issue. This was exacerbated by the crack epidemic, with the New York City area being one of the major ports of entry for narcotics entering the United States. Neighborhoods such as the South Bronx became prime examples of late 20th century urban decay. Beginning in the 1990s, however, crime dropped substantially due to tough-on-crime policies. Crime in New York City has continued to decline through the 21st century.

The September 11th attacks in 2001 were pivotal in the region and nation&#x27;s history. The attacks killed nearly 3,000 people as two planes crashed into the former World Trade Center and caused the towers to collapse. Businesses led an exodus from Lower Manhattan because of this but were replaced by an increased number of high-rise residences and a building boom in New York continues to this day.

In 2003, another blackout occurred, the 2003 North America blackout, but the city suffered no looting.
On October 29 and 30, 2012, Hurricane Sandy caused extensive destruction in the metropolitan area, ravaging portions of the Atlantic coastline with record-high storm surge, severe flooding, and high winds, causing power outages for millions of residents via downed trees and power lines and malfunctions at electrical substations, leading to gasoline shortages and snarling mass transit systems. Damage to New York and New Jersey in terms of physical infrastructure and private property as well as including interrupted commerce was estimated at several tens of billions of dollars. The storm and its profound impacts have prompted the discussion of constructing seawalls and other coastal barriers around the shorelines of the metropolitan area to minimize the risk of destructive consequences from another such event in the future.

One World Trade Center, also known as Freedom Tower, was completed in 2014 to replace the fallen Twin Towers.

The 2017–2021 New York City transit crisis, which began with what media outlets referred to as the 2017 &quot;summer of hell,&quot; led New York Governor Andrew Cuomo to declare a state of emergency. The crisis was due to the interaction of multiple severe problems in the New York City Subway system and in New York City bus lines, as well as at Penn Station, the final stop on several of the commuter lines connecting New York City with other parts of the metropolitan area. Its root causes included long-term neglect of critical infrastructure and lack of adequate funding for ongoing operations, among others. The state of emergency was formally ended on June 30, 2021.

===Statistical history===

The U.S. Census Bureau first designated metropolitan areas in 1950 as standard metropolitan areas (SMAs). The &quot;New York–Northeastern NJ SMA&quot; was defined to include 17 counties: 9 in New York (the five boroughs of New York City, Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester, and Rockland) and 8 in New Jersey (Bergen, Hudson, Passaic, Essex, Union, Morris, Somerset, and Middlesex). In 1960, the metropolitan area standards were modified and renamed standard metropolitan statistical areas (SMSAs). The new standards resulted in the splitting of the former SMA into several pieces: the nine New York counties became the &quot;New York SMSA&quot;; three of the New Jersey counties (Essex, Union, and Morris) became the &quot;Newark SMSA&quot;; two other New Jersey counties (Bergen and Passaic) became the &quot;Paterson–Passaic–Clifton SMSA&quot;; Hudson County was designated the &quot;Jersey City SMSA&quot;; and Middlesex and Somerset counties lost their metropolitan status. In 1973, a new set of metropolitan area standards resulted in further changes: Nassau and Suffolk counties were split off as their own SMSA (&quot;Nassau–Suffolk SMSA&quot;); Bergen County (originally part of the Paterson–Clifton–Passaic SMSA) was transferred to the New York SMSA; the New York SMSA also received Putnam County (previously non-metropolitan); Somerset County was added to the Newark SMSA; and two new SMSAs, the &quot;New Brunswick–Perth Amboy–Sayreville SMSA&quot; (Middlesex County) and &quot;Long Branch–Asbury Park SMSA&quot; (Monmouth County), were established. In 1983, the concept of a consolidated metropolitan statistical area (CMSA) was first implemented. A CMSA consisted of several primary metropolitan statistical areas (PMSAs), which were individual employment centers within a wider labor market area. The &quot;New York–Northern New Jersey–Long Island CMSA&quot; consisted of 12 PMSAs.
Seven PMSAs were based on the original 1950 New York SMA that were split up: New York, Bergen–Passaic, Jersey City, Middlesex–Somerset–Hunterdon (Hunterdon added for the first time), Monmouth–Ocean (Ocean added for the first time), Nassau–Suffolk, and Newark (Sussex added for the first time). One additional PMSA was the Orange County PMSA (previously the Newburgh–Middletown SMSA). The other four PMSAs were former SMSAs in Connecticut: Bridgeport, Stamford, Norwalk, and Danbury. In 1993, four PMSAs were added to the New York–Northern New Jersey–Long Island CMSA: Trenton PMSA (Mercer County), Dutchess County PMSA, Waterbury PMSA, and New Haven PMSA. Several new counties were also added to the CMSA: Sussex, Warren, and Pike. The CMSA model was originally utilized for tabulating data from the 2000 census. In 2003, a new set of standards was established using the Core Based Statistical Area (CBSA) model was adopted and remains in use as of 2010. The CBSA model resulted in the splitting up of the old CMSA into several metropolitan statistical areas: New York–Northern New Jersey–Long Island, Poughkeepsie–Newburgh–Middletown, Trenton–Princeton, Bridgeport–Stamford–Norwalk (includes Danbury), and New Haven–Milford (includes Waterbury). In 2013, the Census Bureau added Carbon, Lehigh, Northampton, and Monroe counties in Pennsylvania, and Warren County, New Jersey (encompassing collectively the Allentown-Bethlehem-Easton, PA-NJ MSA and the East Stroudsburg, PA MSA), to the Combined Statistical Area, and assimilated Poughkeepsie–Newburgh–Middletown into the larger New York–Northern New Jersey–Long Island–NY–NJ–PA MSA. In 2018, the Allentown-Bethlehem-Easton, PA-NJ MSA was removed from the Combined Statistical Area.

===Proposals for the region===

The metropolitan region has never had separate political representation from the rest of their original states. This has to do with disagreements in the desired model and the constitutional complexity of the metropolitan region being cross-state. Within the State of New York over the last 30 years, discussions have emerged of splitting the states into different regions with separate governors and legislators whilst remaining part of the same state — as opposed to seeing New York and its metropolitan area being split into a separate state. The idea has been seen by Republicans in the state as an opportunity to dislocate the Democratic party&#x27;s hold in the state legislature.

The discussion surrounding the re-organization of New York State has commonly been in two models: The two-region model creates a &quot;downstate&quot; New York region which would consist of all five New York City boroughs, Long Island&#x27;s Nassau and Suffolk counties, and Westchester and Rockland counties, then Upstate would be the remaining 53; and the three-region model is New York having five counties; Montauk would consist of Nassau, Suffolk, Rockland, and Westchester counties and; New Amsterdam would be the remaining portion of New York State. This debate was reported as recent as February 2019, when Republican state Senator Daphne Jordan supported the state being split into two states; however, it was believed that the proposal would require an act of congress for it to be passed.

==Demographics==

===Population estimates===
As of 2020, the United States Census Bureau estimated the population of the New York combined statistical area at 23,582,649, the most populous in the United States and one of the world&#x27;s most populous urban agglomerations. The increase in the population of the combined statistical area was distributed across the portions of the states of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania which together constitute the greater New York City metropolitan area.

The New York metropolitan region is ethnically diverse. Asian Americans in New York City, according to the 2010 Census, number more than one million, greater than the combined totals of San Francisco and Los Angeles. New York contains the highest total Asian population of any U.S. city proper. The New York borough of Queens is home to the state&#x27;s largest Asian American population and the largest Andean (Colombian, Ecuadorian, Peruvian, Chilean and Bolivian) populations in the United States, and is also the most ethnically diverse urban area in the world. The Han Chinese population constitutes the fastest-growing ethnicity in New York State; multiple satellites of the original Manhattan Chinatown (), in Brooklyn (), and around Flushing, Queens (), are thriving as traditionally urban enclaves, while also expanding rapidly eastward into suburban Nassau County. on Long Island, as the New York metropolitan region and New York State have become the top destinations for new Chinese immigrants, respectively, and large-scale Chinese immigration continues into New York City and surrounding areas. In 2012, 6.3% of New York was of Chinese ethnicity, with nearly three-fourths living in either Queens or Brooklyn, geographically on Long Island. In particular, the New York area has over 100,000 Fuzhounese people. A community numbering 20,000 Korean-Chinese (&quot;Chaoxianzu&quot; () or &quot;Joseonjok&quot; ()) is centered in Flushing, Queens, while New York is also home to the largest Tibetan population outside China, India, and Nepal, also centered in Queens. Koreans made up 1.2% of the city&#x27;s population, and Japanese 0.3%. Filipinos were the largest Southeast Asian ethnic group at 0.8%, followed by Vietnamese, who made up 0.2% of New York&#x27;s population in 2010. Indians are the largest South Asian group, accounting for 2.4% of the city&#x27;s population, with Bangladeshis and Pakistanis at 0.7% and 0.5%, respectively. Queens is the preferred borough of settlement for Asian Indians, Koreans, and Filipinos, as well as Malaysians and other Southeast Asians; while Brooklyn is receiving large numbers of both West Indian as well as Asian Indian immigrants.

New York has the largest European and non-Hispanic white population of any American city. At 2.7 million in 2012, New York&#x27;s non-Hispanic white population is larger than the non-Hispanic white populations of Los Angeles (1.1 million), Chicago (865,000), and Houston (550,000) combined. The European diaspora residing in the city is very diverse. According to 2012 Census estimates, there were roughly 560,000 Italian Americans, 385,000 Irish Americans, 253,000 German Americans, 223,000 Russian Americans, 201,000 Polish Americans, and 137,000 English Americans. Additionally, Greek and French Americans numbered 65,000 each, with those of Hungarian descent estimated at 60,000 people. Ukrainian and Scottish Americans numbered 55,000 and 35,000, respectively. People identifying ancestry from Spain numbered 30,838 total in 2010. People of Norwegian and Swedish descent both stood at about 20,000 each, while people of Czech, Lithuanian, Portuguese, Scotch-Irish, and Welsh descent all numbered between 12,000 and 14,000 people. Arab Americans number over 160,000 in New York City, with the highest concentration in Brooklyn. Central Asians, primarily Uzbek Americans, are a rapidly growing segment of the city&#x27;s non-Hispanic white population, enumerating over 30,000, and including over half of all Central Asian immigrants to the United States, most settling in Queens or Brooklyn. Albanian Americans are most highly concentrated in the Bronx.

The wider New York metropolitan area is also ethnically diverse. The New York metropolitan area is home the largest African American/Black population in the nation with nearly four million. The New York region continues to be by far the leading metropolitan gateway for legal immigrants admitted into the United States, substantially exceeding the combined totals of Los Angeles and Miami, the next most popular gateway regions. It is home to the largest Jewish as well as Israeli communities outside Israel, with the Jewish population in the region numbering over 1.5 million in 2012 and including many diverse Jewish sects from around the Middle East and Eastern Europe. The metropolitan area is also home to 20% of the nation&#x27;s Indian Americans and at least 20 Little India enclaves, as well as 15% of all Korean Americans and four Koreatowns; the largest Asian Indian population in the Western Hemisphere; the largest Russian American, Italian American, and African American populations; the largest Dominican American, Puerto Rican American, and South American and second-largest overall Hispanic population in the United States, numbering 4.8 million; and includes at least 6 established Chinatowns within New York City alone, with the urban agglomeration consisting of a population of 819,527 uniracial overseas Chinese as of 2014 Census estimates, the largest outside of Asia.

Ecuador, Colombia, Guyana, Peru, and Brazil were the top source countries from South America for legal immigrants to the New York region in 2013; the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Haiti, and Trinidad and Tobago in the Caribbean; Egypt, Ghana, and Nigeria from Africa; and El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala in Central America. Amidst a resurgence of Puerto Rican migration to New York City, this population had increased to approximately 1.3 million in the metropolitan area as of 2013.

New York City has been described as the gay capital of the world, and is home to one of the world&#x27;s largest LGBTQ populations and the most prominent. The New York metropolitan area is home to a self-identifying gay and bisexual community estimated at 568,903 individuals, the largest in the United States and one of the world&#x27;s largest. Same-sex marriages in New York were legalized on June 24, 2011, and were authorized to take place beginning 30 days thereafter. The annual NYC Pride March (or Gay Pride Parade) traverses southward down Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, ending at Greenwich Village, and is the largest pride parade in the world, attracting tens of thousands of participants and millions of sidewalk spectators each June.

===Religion===
The 2014 Pew Religious Landscape Survey showed that the religious makeup of the New York metro area was as follows:
==Economy==

The New York City regional economy is the largest in the world, with a GDP of US$2.5 trillion in 2022, which would rank 8th among sovereign countries. Many Fortune 500 corporations are headquartered in New York, as are a large number of foreign corporations. One out of ten private sector jobs in the city is with a foreign company. In 2012 and 2015, New York topped the first and second &quot;Global Economic Power Index&quot; lists, respectively, as published by &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, with cities ranked according to criteria reflecting their presence on five different lists as published by five separate entities. Finance, international trade, new and traditional media, real estate, education, fashion and entertainment, tourism, biotechnology, and manufacturing are the leading industries in the area. Along with its wealth, the area has a cost of living that is the highest in the United States.

===Gross domestic product by county===
===Wall Street===

The New York metropolitan area&#x27;s most important economic sector lies in its role as the headquarters for the U.S. financial industry, metonymously known as &quot;Wall Street&quot;. Anchored by Wall Street, in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan, New York has been called both the most economically powerful city and the leading financial center of the world, and the city is home to the world&#x27;s two largest stock exchanges by total market capitalization, the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ. The city&#x27;s securities industry, enumerating 163,400 jobs in August 2013, continues to form the largest segment of the city&#x27;s financial sector and an important economic engine, accounting in 2012 for 5 percent of the city&#x27;s private sector jobs, 8.5 percent (US$3.8 billion) of its tax revenue, and 22 percent of the city&#x27;s total wages, including an average salary of US$360,700.

Manhattan had approximately 520 million square feet (48.1 million m2) of office space in 2013, making it the largest office market in the United States, while Midtown Manhattan is the largest central business district in the nation.

Lower Manhattan is the third-largest central business district in the United States and is home to both the New York Stock Exchange, on Wall Street, and the NASDAQ, at 165 Broadway, representing the world&#x27;s largest and second largest stock exchanges, respectively, when measured both by overall average daily trading volume and by total market capitalization of their listed companies in 2013. Wall Street investment banking fees in 2012 totaled approximately US$40 billion, while in 2013, senior New York bank officers who manage risk and compliance functions earned as much as US$324,000 annually.

In July 2013, NYSE Euronext, the operator of the New York Stock Exchange, took over the administration of the London interbank offered rate from the British Bankers Association.

Many Wall Street firms have added or moved auxiliary financial or technical operations into Jersey City, to take advantage of New Jersey&#x27;s relatively lower commercial real estate and rental prices, while offering continued geographic proximity to Manhattan&#x27;s financial industry ecosystem.

===Tech and biotech===

Silicon Alley, centered in New York, has evolved into a metonym for the sphere encompassing the metropolitan region&#x27;s high technology industries involving the internet, new media, financial technology (&quot;fintech&quot;) and cryptocurrency, telecommunications, digital media, software development, biotechnology, game design, and other fields within information technology that are supported by its entrepreneurship ecosystem and venture capital investments. High technology startup companies and employment are growing in New York and across the metropolitan region, bolstered by the city&#x27;s emergence as a global node of creativity and entrepreneurship, social tolerance, and environmental sustainability, as well as New York&#x27;s position as the leading Internet hub and telecommunications center in North America, including its vicinity to several transatlantic fiber optic trunk lines, the city&#x27;s intellectual capital, and its extensive outdoor wireless connectivity. Verizon Communications, headquartered at 140 West Street in Lower Manhattan, was at the final stages in 2014 of completing a US$3 billion fiberoptic telecommunications upgrade throughout New York City.

The biotechnology sector is also growing in the New York metropolitan region, based upon its strength in academic scientific research and public and commercial financial support. On December 19, 2011, then-New York mayor Michael Bloomberg announced his choice of Cornell University and Technion-Israel Institute of Technology to build Cornell Tech, a US$2 billion graduate school of applied sciences on Roosevelt Island, Manhattan with the goal of transforming New York into the world&#x27;s premier technology capital. By mid-2014, Accelerator, a biotech investment firm, had raised more than US$30 million from investors, including Eli Lilly and Company, Pfizer, and Johnson &amp; Johnson, for initial funding to create biotechnology startups at the Alexandria Center for Life Science, which encompasses more than on East 29th Street and promotes collaboration among scientists and entrepreneurs at the center and with nearby academic, medical, and research institutions. The New York City Economic Development Corporation&#x27;s Early Stage Life Sciences Funding Initiative and venture capital partners, including Celgene, General Electric Ventures, and Eli Lilly, committed a minimum of US$100 million to help launch 15 to 20 ventures in life sciences and biotechnology. Westchester County has also developed a burgeoning biotechnology sector in the 21st century, with over US$1 billion in planned private investment as of 2016, earning the county the nickname &quot;Biochester&quot;.

===Port of New York and New Jersey===
The Port of New York and New Jersey is the port district of the New York metropolitan area, encompassing the region within approximately a radius of the Statue of Liberty National Monument. A major economic engine for the New York metropolitan area, the port includes the system of navigable waterways in the estuary along of shoreline in the vicinity of New York and the Gateway Region of northeastern New Jersey, as well as the region&#x27;s airports and supporting rail and roadway distribution networks. The Port of New York and New Jersey handled a maritime cargo volume in the ten months through October 2022 of over 8.2 million TEUs, benefitting post-Panamax from the expansion of the Panama Canal, and accelerating ahead of California seaports in monthly cargo volumes.

===Water purity and availability===

Water purity and availability are a lifeline for the New York metropolitan region. New York City is supplied with drinking water by the protected Catskill Mountains watershed. As a result of the watershed&#x27;s integrity and undisturbed natural water filtration system, New York is one of only four major cities in the United States the majority of whose drinking water is pure enough not to require purification by water treatment plants. The Croton Watershed north of the city is undergoing construction of a US$3.2 billion water purification plant to augment New York&#x27;s water supply by an estimated 290 million gallons daily, representing a greater than 20% addition to the city&#x27;s current availability of water. The ongoing expansion of New York City Water Tunnel No. 3, an integral part of the New York City water supply system, is the largest capital construction project in the city&#x27;s history, with segments serving Manhattan and The Bronx completed, and with segments serving Brooklyn and Queens planned for construction in 2020. Much of the fresh water for northern and central New Jersey is provided by reservoirs, but numerous municipal water wells exist which accomplish the same purpose.

==Education==
The New York metropolitan area is home to many prestigious institutions of higher education. Three Ivy League universities: Columbia University in Manhattan, New York City; Princeton University in Princeton, New Jersey; Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut – all ranked amongst the top 3 U.S. national universities as per &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; as of 2018 – reside in the region, as well as New York University and The Rockefeller University, both located in Manhattan; all of the above have been ranked amongst the top 35 universities in the world. Rutgers University, a global university located southwest of Manhattan in New Brunswick and Piscataway, New Jersey, is by far the largest university in the region. New York Institute of Technology is located on two campuses, one in Old Westbury, Long Island and one near Columbus Circle in Manhattan. Hofstra University is Long Island&#x27;s largest private university. Fordham University, also a Tier-1 university, is the oldest Catholic institution of higher education in the northeastern United States, and the third-oldest university in New York State. The New York City Department of Education is the largest school district in the United States serving over 1.2 million students. The overall region also hosts many public high schools, some of which have been described as among the most prestigious in the country.

===Attainment===
According to the 2010 American Community Survey, of the 14,973,063 persons in this area over 25 years of age, 14.8% (2,216,578) had a graduate or professional degree, 21.1% (3,166,037) had a bachelor&#x27;s degree, 6.4% (962,007) had an associate degree, 16.0% (2,393,990) had some college education but no degree, 26.8% (4,009,901) had a high school diploma or equivalent, 14.8% (2,224,557) had less than a high school education. In 2010, CNN Money ranked the area as one of the top 10 smartest regions in the United States.

==Transportation==

The depth and intricacy of the transportation network in the New York region parallels the size and complexity of the metropolis itself.

In 2013, the New York-Newark-Jersey City metropolitan statistical area (New York MSA) had the lowest percentage of workers who commuted by private automobile (56.9 percent), with 18.9 percent of area workers traveling via rail transit. During the period starting in 2006 and ending in 2013, the New York MSA had a 2.2 percent decline of workers commuting by automobile.

===Rail===
About one in every three users of mass transit in the United States and two-thirds of the nation&#x27;s rail riders live in the New York metropolitan area.

====New York City Subway====

The New York City Subway is the largest rapid transit system in the world when measured by stations in operation, with , and by length of routes. In 2006 it was the third largest when measured by annual ridership (1.5 billion passenger trips in 2006), However, in 2013, the subway delivered over 1.71 billion rides, but slipped to being the seventh busiest rapid transit rail system in the world. New York&#x27;s subway is also notable because nearly the entire system remains open 24 hours a day, in contrast to the overnight shutdown common to systems in most cities, including Hong Kong, London, Seoul, Tokyo, and Toronto.

====PATH====

PATH is a rapid transit system connecting the cities of Newark, Harrison, Hoboken, and Jersey City, in metropolitan northern New Jersey, with the Lower and Midtown sections of Manhattan in New York City. The PATH is operated by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. PATH trains run 24 hours a day and 7 days a week. The system has a total route length of , not double-counting route overlaps.

====Commuter rail====
The metropolitan area is also fundamentally defined by the areas from which people commute into New York. The city is served by three primary commuter rail systems, and is provided intercity rail transit with Amtrak.

The Long Island Rail Road (LIRR), the busiest commuter railroad in the United States as of 2015, is operated by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), an agency of the State Government of New York that focuses on New York City-area transit). It has two major terminals at Pennsylvania Station in Midtown Manhattan and Atlantic Terminal in Downtown Brooklyn, with a minor terminal at the Long Island City station and a major transfer point at the Jamaica station in Queens.

New Jersey Transit (NJT), the second busiest commuter railroad in the United States as of 2015, is operated by the New Jersey Transit Corporation, an agency of the state of New Jersey, in conjunction with Metro-North Railroad and Amtrak. It has major terminals at Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan, Hoboken Terminal, and Newark Pennsylvania Station, with a major transfer point at Secaucus Junction in Hudson County, New Jersey. New Jersey Transit also operates the Hudson–Bergen Light Rail through Hudson County, the Newark Light Rail, and the River Line that runs along tracks shared with Conrail Shared Assets Operations from Trenton to Camden in South Jersey. NJ Transit also has commuter buses operating in and out of Manhattan.

Metro-North Railroad (MNRR), the third busiest commuter railroad in the United States as of 2015, is also operated by the MTA, in conjunction with the Connecticut Department of Transportation and New Jersey Transit. Its major terminal is Grand Central Terminal. Trains on the Port Jervis Line and Pascack Valley Line terminate at Hoboken Terminal in Hoboken, New Jersey; commuters may transfer at either Secaucus Junction for New Jersey Transit trains to New York Pennsylvania Station or at Hoboken Terminal for PATH trains into Manhattan.

Amtrak&#x27;s Northeast Corridor offers service to Philadelphia, New Haven, and other points between and including Boston and Washington, D.C. 
Major stations in the metropolitan area include:
The following table shows all train lines operated by these commuter railroads in the New York metropolitan area. New Jersey Transit operates an additional train line in the Philadelphia metropolitan area. (Shown counterclockwise from the Atlantic Ocean):

New York has been described as the cultural capital of the world by the diplomatic consulates of Iceland and Latvia and by New York&#x27;s own Baruch College.

<text>The patella (: patellae or patellas), also known as the kneecap, is a flat, rounded triangular bone which articulates with the femur (thigh bone) and covers and protects the anterior articular surface of the knee joint. The patella is found in many tetrapods, such as mice, cats, birds and dogs, but not in whales, or most reptiles.

In humans, the patella is the largest sesamoid bone (i.e., embedded within a tendon or a muscle) in the body. Babies are born with a patella of soft cartilage which begins to ossify into bone at about four years of age.

== Structure ==
The patella is a sesamoid bone roughly triangular in shape, with the apex of the patella facing downwards. The apex is the most inferior (lowest) part of the patella. It is pointed in shape, and gives attachment to the patellar ligament.

The front and back surfaces are joined by a thin margin and towards centre by a thicker margin. The tendon of the quadriceps femoris muscle attaches to the base of the patella., with the vastus intermedius muscle attaching to the base itself, and the vastus lateralis and vastus medialis are attached to outer lateral and medial borders of patella respectively.

The upper third of the front of the patella is coarse, flattened, and rough, and serves for the attachment of the tendon of the quadriceps and often has exostoses. The middle third has numerous vascular canaliculi. The lower third culminates in the apex which serves as the origin of the patellar ligament. The posterior surface is divided into two parts.

The upper three-quarters of the patella articulates with the femur and is subdivided into a medial and a lateral facet by a vertical ledge which varies in shape.

In the adult the articular surface is about and covered by cartilage, which can reach a maximal thickness of in the centre at about 30 years of age. Owing to the great stress on the patellofemoral joint during resisted knee flexion, the articular cartilage of the patella is among the thickest in the human body.

The lower part of the posterior surface has vascular canaliculi filled and is filled by fatty tissue, the infrapatellar fat pad.

Emarginations (i.e. &quot;patella emarginata&quot;, a &quot;missing piece&quot;) are common laterally on the proximal edge. Bipartite patellas are the result of an ossification of a second cartilaginous layer at the location of an emargination. Previously, bipartite patellas were explained as the failure of several ossification centres to fuse, but this idea has been rejected. Partite patellas occur almost exclusively in men. Tripartite and even multipartite patellas occur.

The upper three-quarters of the patella articulates with the femur and is subdivided into a medial and a lateral facet by a vertical ledge which varies in shape. Four main types of articular surface can be distinguished:
# Most commonly the medial articular surface is smaller than the lateral.
# Sometimes both articular surfaces are virtually equal in size.
# Occasionally, the medial surface is hypoplastic or
# the central ledge is only indicated.

=== Development===
In the patella an ossification centre develops at the age of 3–6 years. The patella originates from two centres of ossification which unite when fully formed.

== Function ==
The primary functional role of the patella is knee extension. The patella increases the leverage that the quadriceps tendon can exert on the femur by increasing the angle at which it acts.

The patella is attached to the tendon of the quadriceps femoris muscle, which contracts to extend/straighten the knee. The patella is stabilized by the insertion of the horizontal fibres of vastus medialis and by the prominence of the lateral femoral condyle, which discourages lateral dislocation during flexion. The retinacular fibres of the patella also stabilize it during exercise.

==Clinical significance==

===Dislocation===
Patellar dislocations occur with significant regularity, particularly in young female athletes. It involves the patella sliding out of its position on the knee, most often laterally, and may be associated with extremely intense pain and swelling. The patella can be tracked back into the groove with an extension of the knee, and therefore sometimes returns into the proper position on its own.

===Vertical alignment===

A &quot;patella alta&quot; is a high-riding (superiorly aligned) patella. An attenuated patella alta is an unusually small patella that develops out of and above the joint.

A &quot;patella baja&quot; is a low-riding patella. A long-standing patella baja may result in extensor dysfunction.

The &quot;Insall-Salvati ratio&quot; helps to indicate patella baja on lateral X-rays, and is calculated as the patellar tendon length divided by the patellar bone length. An Insall-Salvati ratio of &lt; 0.8 indicates patella baja.

===Fracture===
The kneecap is prone to injury because of its particularly exposed location, and fractures of the patella commonly occur as a consequence of direct trauma onto the knee. These fractures usually cause swelling and pain in the region, bleeding into the joint (hemarthrosis), and an inability to extend the knee. Patella fractures are usually treated with surgery, unless the damage is minimal and the extensor mechanism is intact.

===Exostosis===
An exostosis is the formation of new bone onto a bone, as a result of excess calcium formation. This can be the cause of chronic pain when formed on the patella.

==Other animals==
The patella is found in placental mammals and birds; most marsupials have only rudimentary, non-ossified patellae although a few species possess a bony patella. A patella is also present in the living monotremes, the platypus and the echidna. In other tetrapods, including living amphibians and most reptiles (except some lepidosaurs), the muscle tendons from the upper leg are attached directly to the tibia, and a patella is not present. In 2017 it was discovered that frogs have kneecaps, contrary to what was thought. This raises the possibility that the kneecap arose 350 million years ago when tetrapods first appeared, but that it disappeared in some animals.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;patella&quot; originated in the late 17th century from the diminutive form of Latin &#x27; or &#x27; or &quot;paten&quot;, meaning shallow dish.

<text>Slope Point is the southernmost point of the South Island of New Zealand.

Slope Point lies south of the small settlement of Waikawa, near the southwestern edge of the Catlins and Toetoes Bay and east of Invercargill. A nearby locality—Haldane—was named after the original European settlers, the Haldane family.

The land around Slope Point is used for sheep farming with no houses anywhere nearby. Eroded cliffs drop down to the sea below. An AA signpost there shows the distance to the Equator and the South Pole, and a small solar-powered lighthouse stands on farmland.

There is no road to Slope Point; it can be reached by a 20-minute walk following dilapidated yellow markers. Its latitude, longitude is approximately 46.67 S, 169.00 E. There is no public access during the lambing season (September – November).

<text>Antonio Cervantes (born December 23, 1945) is a Colombian boxing trainer and former professional boxer who competed from 1961 to 1983. He held the WBA and &quot;The Ring&quot; light welterweight title twice between 1972 and 1980. 

In 2002, Cervantes was chosen for the Ring Magazine&#x27;s list of 80 Best Fighters of the Last 80 Years. Boxrec also ranked him the 50th greatest pound for pound boxer of all time.

==Personal life==
Cervantes, who is Afro-Colombian, was born in Palenque, also known as the first site of a slave rebellion in the Americas. Cervantes used to sell contraband cigarettes and shine shoes as a child to survive.

==Professional boxing career==
He met boxing trainer Carmelo Prada, who helped shape his style. Cervantes only had three amateur bouts, winning two and losing one. On January 31, 1964, Cervantes entered the boxing ring as a professional for the first time, beating Juan Martínez by decision in six rounds. His first 32 bouts as a professional were in Colombia, and he won 27, lost 4 and drew one of them. Realizing his pupil needed publicity outside Colombia, Prada then moved with Cervantes to Venezuela, where, on November 25, 1968, he knocked out Orlando Ruiz in the first round for his first fight abroad. He followed that win with a ten rounds decision over Nestor Rojas in the very short time of only three days later.

On December 23 of that year, he suffered his first knockout defeat when Cruz Marcano, a fringe contender of the time, beat him in four rounds in Caracas.

He won five and lost two in 1969, splitting his fights between Colombia and Venezuela, and losing a ten-round decision to Antonio Gómez, former world champion.

He won two more in 1970, then he and Prada moved, this time to Los Angeles. In California, he began by beating Jose Rodriguez by a knockout in the first round in San Jose, and on December 17, he beat Rodolfo Gato González, a very famous Mexican boxer of the time, by knockout in round eight. After this and a 1971 win over Argentine Enrique Jana, Cervantes was ranked as a light welterweight by the WBA. On December 11 of that year, he had his first world title try, against Nicolino Locche, in Buenos Aires. Cervantes lost a 15-round decision that time, however.

===Winning the light welterweight title===
After winning three fights in 1972, Cervantes, who had by then returned to Colombia, had another world title try: Alfonso Frazer, who had dethroned Locche of the world title, gave Cervantes a chance on October 28 at Panama City. Cervantes knocked Frazer out in round ten and became the world light welterweight champion for the first time.

Cervantes immediately became a national hero in Colombia, and many enterprises made him their spokesman in the coffee producing country, most notably Sanyo, whose name the popular champion advertised on his clothing and fight trunks.

Cervantes made nine defenses, including a TKO in round ten against Locche in their rematch after his corner stopped the fight due to a cut over his left eye, a knockout in five of Frazer, also in a rematch, a 15-round split decision win over Josue Marquez in Puerto Rico (in the first world title bout ever held at Roberto Clemente Coliseum; most of the nine thousand in attendance scored the fight for Cervantes) and a 15-round decision against future world Lightweight champion Esteban De Jesús. But on March 6, 1976, at San Juan, he lost a 15-round decision and the world title to 17-year-old Puerto Rican Wilfred Benítez, who with that became boxing&#x27;s youngest champion ever.

Cervantes won five more fights in a row, including a win over Saoul Mamby, before fighting for the world title again. After Benitez had left the light welterweight belt vacant, Cervantes regained it on June 25, 1977, with a five-round knockout over Carlos Maria Gimenez, again in Venezuela. His second reign as world champion took him to such places as Thailand, Botswana and South Korea, among others. He retained the title six times, beating the likes of Adrian Marrero and Miguel Montilla (twice). By this time, there was much talk about a &quot;superfight&quot; with world Lightweight champion Roberto Durán, who was coming up in weight. Duran decided to challenge Sugar Ray Leonard instead, however, and Cervantes vs. Duran never materialized.

On August 2, 1980, Cervantes dropped his next title challenger, Aaron Pryor, to the canvas in the first round. Pryor recovered, however, and beat Cervantes by a knockout in round four. This turned out to be Cervantes&#x27; last world title fight. He fought two times more for the FECARBOX WBC title, winning both fights shortly before retiring in 1980.

However, Cervantes came out of retirement due to financial problems and went on boxing until 1983, winning four fights and dropping his last one, a ten-round decision loss to Danny Sanchez on December 9, 1983, at Miami.

==Retirement==
In retirement, his life was almost as public as it was during his boxing career: In 1985, for example, he and a female passenger in one of the boats Cervantes owned, suffered a water accident, and the passenger almost drowned, but Cervantes was able to save her life. A movie has been made about a fictional boxer called Milton Ollivera (who comes from Colombia) who goes through a majority of the things Cervantes went through throughout his life.

Cervantes was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1998, and in 2000, he was declared by the &quot;Colombian Boxing Federation and National Association of Professional Boxing&quot; as Colombia&#x27;s &quot;Fighter of the Century&quot;. For that award, the WBA issued him a special, commemorative belt.

Cervantes&#x27; nickname, &quot;Kid Pambelé&quot;, became almost as famous as Cervantes himself: as a matter of a fact, many fans called him only &quot;Pambelé&quot; or &quot;Pambe&quot; (the name of a song by Carlos Vives about him).

<text>Trachodon (meaning &quot;rough tooth&quot;) is a dubious genus of hadrosaurid dinosaur based on teeth from the Campanian-age Upper Cretaceous Judith River Formation of Montana, U.S. It is a historically important genus with a convoluted taxonomy that has been all but abandoned by modern dinosaur paleontologists.

Despite being used for decades as the iconic duckbill dinosaur, the material it is based on is composed of teeth from both duckbills and ceratopsids (their teeth have a distinctive double root), and its describer, Joseph Leidy, came to recognize the difference and suggested limiting the genus to what would now be seen as ceratopsid teeth. Restricted to the duckbill teeth, it may have been a lambeosaurine.

==History and classification==
In 1856, Joseph Leidy received fragmentary remains from the Judith River Formation, collected by Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden. From these bones, he provided the first names for North American dinosaurs: &quot;Deinodon&quot;, &quot;Palaeoscincus&quot;, &quot;Trachodon&quot;, and &quot;Troodon&quot; (then spelled &quot;Troödon&quot;). The type species of &quot;Trachodon&quot; is &quot;T. mirabilis&quot;. The generic name is derived from Greek τραχυς, &quot;trakhys&quot;, &quot;rough&quot;, and όδον, &quot;odon&quot;, &quot;tooth&quot;, referring to the granulate inner surface of one of the teeth. The specific name means &quot;marvelous&quot; in Latin.

&quot;Trachodon&quot; was based on ANSP 9260, seven unassociated teeth, one of which had double roots. With better remains from &quot;Hadrosaurus&quot;, he began to reconsider his taxonomy, and suggested, at least informally, that &quot;Trachodon&quot; should refer to the double-rooted tooth, and the other teeth should be referred to &quot;Hadrosaurus&quot;. In the Bone Wars that followed, and their wake, the taxonomy of &quot;Trachodon&quot; and its relatives became increasingly confusing, with one author going so far as to sink all known hadrosaur species into &quot;Trachodon&quot; except for &quot;Claosaurus agilis&quot;, but as new material was described from the Rocky Mountain region, Alberta, and Saskatchewan, later authors began progressively restricting the reach of this genus.

By 1942, and the publication of the influential Lull-Wright monograph on duckbills, its holotype was regarded as &quot;typical of all the genera of hadrosaurian dinosaur&quot;, except for the roughened margin that gave it its name, and that they regarded as due to the tooth having not been used (p. 149). The name is no longer in use, except in historical discussions, and is considered a &quot;nomen dubium&quot;.

In 1936, paleontologist Charles Sternberg compared the holotype teeth of &quot;Trachodon mirabilis&quot; to those of more completely known hadrosaurids and noted that they were most similar to those of lambeosaurines. It has been reported that paleontologist John R. Horner also found that &quot;Trachodon&quot; teeth compare well with the teeth of lambeosaurines, specifically &quot;Corythosaurus&quot;, though they also share similarities with the genus &quot;Prosaurolophus&quot;.

===Species===
Numerous species have been referred to this genus, mostly before World War I. Only those originally named as a species of &quot;Trachodon&quot; are considered here.

Type species:
&quot;T. mirabilis&quot; Leidy, 1856

Other species:
*&quot;T. amurense&quot; Riabinin, 1925(based on IVP AS collection, a partial skeleton from Upper Cretaceous rocks of the Amur River banks of Heilongjiang in northeast China, amended to &quot;T. amurensis&quot; and now the type species of &quot;Mandschurosaurus&quot;)
*&quot;T. cantabrigiensis&quot; (&quot;nomen dubium&quot;) Lydekker, 1888 (based on BMNH R.496, a dentary tooth from the late Albian-age Lower Cretaceous Cambridge Greensand, Cambridgeshire, England, regarded as a dubious early hadrosaurid)
*&quot;T. longiceps&quot; (&quot;nomen dubium&quot;) Marsh, 1897 (based on YPM 616, a large right dentary with teeth from the late Maastrichtian-age Upper Cretaceous Lance Formation of Wyoming, U.S., later assigned to &quot;Anatotitan&quot;)
*&quot;T. marginatus&quot; (&quot;nomen dubium&quot;) Lambe, 1902 (based on NMC 419, disassociated postcranial material; later made the type species of the genus &quot;Stephanosaurus marginatus&quot; and then referred to &quot;Kritosaurus&quot; as &quot;Kritosaurus marginatus&quot;, which is not supported by later reviews.)
*&quot;T.&quot; (&quot;Pteropelyx&quot;) &quot;selwyni&quot; (&quot;nomen dubium&quot;) Lambe, 1902 (based on NMC 290, a dentary with teeth, from the Dinosaur Park Formation of Alberta; too fragmentary to assign beyond Hadrosauridae)

==Paleobiology==
As a hadrosaurid, &quot;Trachodon&quot; would have been a large, bipedal/quadrupedal herbivore.

<text>The Georgia Northeastern Railroad is a short line freight railroad which runs from the town of Elizabeth, Georgia (now within Marietta, northwest of Atlanta) to the city of Blue Ridge, Georgia. Goods hauled are mostly timber, grain, poultry, and marble products. The GNRR&#x27;s subsidiary, the Blue Ridge Scenic Railway, also operates on this line north of Blue Ridge. Despite the name, it actually operates between north-central and northwest Georgia, from north-northwest metro Atlanta, and is a few counties away from northeast Georgia.

Purchased from CSX, the line interconnects with the Western &amp; Atlantic subdivision of CSX at Elizabeth Yard in Marietta at milepost 22.0 (), located from downtown Atlanta. GNRR tracks include a long rail siding along the east side of the triple CSX tracks, from just north of Kennesaw Avenue, over Tower Road, to just north of Loudermilk Drive, where it rejoins what becomes the main northbound CSX track. The main GNRR track splits from the GNRR siding at a rail switch just north of Tower Road, and parallels the other tracks to just before Marr Avenue, before a sharp turn to the east. Between Marr, Loudermilk, the GNRR siding, and GNRR mainline, there are two dead-end sidings extending north on the east side of the GNRR office, and one of those has another dead-end siding extending north on the west side of the office.

==Communities==

Counties and communities served by the line are as follows, from north to south (major towns in bold):
*Fannin:
**Blue Ridge &quot;(new)&quot;
*Gilmer:
**Cherry Log &quot;(new)&quot;
**Ellijay
*Pickens:
**Whitestone
**Jasper
**Tate
*Cherokee:
**Ball Ground
**Keithsburg
**Canton
**Holly Springs
**Lebanon
**Woodstock
*Cobb:
**Noonday
**Blackwells
**Westoak
**Elizabeth, within Marietta

==History==
The route has had several names since it was chartered in 1854:
*Ellijay Railroad, changing name to
*Marietta, Canton and Ellijay Railroad, changing name to
*Marietta and North Georgia Railroad, changing name to
*Atlanta, Knoxville and Northern Railroad, later purchased by
*Louisville and Nashville Railroad, later sold to
*CSX Transportation, then sold to GNRR.

==Commuter rail==
At least one proposal is also considering using the line for commuter rail on the lower part of the route, from Canton to Marietta, and possibly along the CSX main route down to Atlanta. Canton, Marietta, and Cobb County put together $40,000 for a study, a draft of which says that it would cost $97 million to upgrade the old rail tracks and add passenger train stations, train cars and locomotives. Another $1.8 million would be needed annually above the intake of fares. 

The line would be 22 miles or 35 kilometers long from Canton to Elizabeth, where riders could transfer to CobbLinc buses. The draft study estimates about 300 people per day would initially ride if it were already in place (600 if it went to Atlanta), and about 1700 would ride in 20 years.

The study urges local governments (Cobb and Cherokee counties, and the cities of Marietta, Woodstock, Holly Springs, and Canton) to preserve any areas where a right-of-way may be necessary, allow no new grade crossings of roads, and prevent land development too close to the line (so that new residents cannot complain about it, though it has been there since the 1890s).

The corridor may be in addition to GRTA Xpress or even CCT buses on the parallel Interstate 575, which is scheduled open High-occupancy toll lanes in 2018.

<doc id="309909" wikidata="Q263307" url="?curid=309909" title="Aristotelianism">
<text>Aristotelianism ( ) is a philosophical tradition inspired by the work of Aristotle, usually characterized by deductive logic and an analytic inductive method in the study of natural philosophy and metaphysics. It covers the treatment of the social sciences under a system of natural law. It answers why-questions by a scheme of four causes, including purpose or teleology, and emphasizes virtue ethics. Aristotle and his school wrote tractates on physics, biology, metaphysics, logic, ethics, aesthetics, poetry, theatre, music, rhetoric, psychology, linguistics, economics, politics, and government. Any school of thought that takes one of Aristotle&#x27;s distinctive positions as its starting point can be considered &quot;Aristotelian&quot; in the widest sense. This means that different Aristotelian theories (e.g. in ethics or in ontology) may not have much in common as far as their actual content is concerned besides their shared reference to Aristotle.

In Aristotle&#x27;s time, philosophy included natural philosophy, which preceded the advent of modern science during the Scientific Revolution. The works of Aristotle were initially defended by the members of the Peripatetic school and later on by the Neoplatonists, who produced many commentaries on Aristotle&#x27;s writings. In the Islamic Golden Age, Avicenna and Averroes translated the works of Aristotle into Arabic and under them, along with philosophers such as Al-Kindi and Al-Farabi, Aristotelianism became a major part of early Islamic philosophy.

Moses Maimonides adopted Aristotelianism from the Islamic scholars and based his &quot;Guide for the Perplexed&quot; on it and that became the basis of Jewish scholastic philosophy. Although some of Aristotle&#x27;s logical works were known to western Europe, it was not until the Latin translations of the 12th century and the rise of scholasticism that the works of Aristotle and his Arabic commentators became widely available. Scholars such as Albertus Magnus and Thomas Aquinas interpreted and systematized Aristotle&#x27;s works in accordance with Catholic theology.

After retreating under criticism from modern natural philosophers, the distinctively Aristotelian idea of teleology was transmitted through Wolff and Kant to Hegel, who applied it to history as a totality. However, this project was criticized by Trendelenburg and Brentano as non-Aristotelian, Hegel&#x27;s influence is now often said to be responsible for an important Aristotelian influence upon Marx.

Recent Aristotelian ethical and &quot;practical&quot; philosophy, such as that of Gadamer and McDowell, is often premissed upon a rejection of Aristotelianism&#x27;s traditional metaphysical or theoretical philosophy. From this viewpoint, the early modern tradition of political republicanism, which views the &quot;res publica&quot;, public sphere or state as constituted by its citizens&#x27; virtuous activity, can appear thoroughly Aristotelian.

Alasdair MacIntyre is a notable Aristotelian philosopher who helped to revive virtue ethics in his book &quot;After Virtue.&quot; MacIntyre revises Aristotelianism with the argument that the highest temporal goods, which are internal to human beings, are actualized through participation in social practices.

==History==
===Ancient Greek===

The original followers of Aristotle were the members of the Peripatetic school. The most prominent members of the school after Aristotle were Theophrastus and Strato of Lampsacus, who both continued Aristotle&#x27;s researches. During the Roman era, the school concentrated on preserving and defending his work. The most important figure in this regard was Alexander of Aphrodisias who commentated on Aristotle&#x27;s writings. With the rise of Neoplatonism in the 3rd century, Peripateticism as an independent philosophy came to an end. Still, the Neoplatonists sought to incorporate Aristotle&#x27;s philosophy within their own system and produced many commentaries on Aristotle.

===Byzantine Empire===
Byzantine Aristotelianism emerged in the Byzantine Empire in the form of Aristotelian paraphrase: adaptations in which Aristotle&#x27;s text is rephrased, reorganized, and pruned, in order to make it more easily understood. This genre was allegedly invented by Themistius in the mid-4th century, revived by Michael Psellos in the mid-11th century, and further developed by Sophonias in the late 13th to early 14th centuries.

Leo the Mathematician was appointed to the chair of philosophy at the Magnaura School in the mid-9th century to teach Aristotelian logic. The 11th and 12th centuries saw the emergence of twelfth-century Byzantine Aristotelianism. Before the 12th century, the whole Byzantine output of Aristotelian commentaries was focused on logic. However, the range of subjects covered by the Aristotelian commentaries produced in the two decades after 1118 is much greater due to the initiative of the princess Anna Comnena who commissioned a number of scholars to write commentaries on previously neglected works of Aristotle.

===Islamic world===
In the Abbasid Empire, many foreign works were translated into Arabic, large libraries were constructed, and scholars were welcomed. Under the caliphs Harun al-Rashid and his son Al-Ma&#x27;mun, the House of Wisdom in Baghdad flourished. Christian scholar Hunayn ibn Ishaq (809–873) was placed in charge of the translation work by the caliph. In his lifetime, Ishaq translated 116 writings, including works by Plato and Aristotle, into Syriac and Arabic.

With the founding of House of Wisdom, the entire corpus of Aristotelian works that had been preserved (excluding the &quot;Eudemian Ethics&quot;, &quot;Magna Moralia&quot; and &quot;Politics&quot;) became available, along with its Greek commentators; this corpus laid a uniform foundation for Islamic Aristotelianism.

Al-Kindi (801–873) was the first of the Muslim Peripatetic philosophers and is known for his efforts to introduce Greek and Hellenistic philosophy to the Arab world. He incorporated Aristotelian and Neoplatonist thought into an Islamic philosophical framework. This was an important factor in the introduction and popularization of Greek philosophy in the Muslim intellectual world. In the 9th century, Persian astrologer Albumasarl&#x27;s &quot;Introductorium in Astronomiam&quot; was one of the most important sources for the recovery of Aristotle for medieval European scholars.

The philosopher Al-Farabi (872–950) had great influence on science and philosophy for several centuries, and in his time was widely thought second only to Aristotle in knowledge (alluded to by his title of &quot;the Second Teacher&quot;). His work, aimed at synthesis of philosophy and Sufism, paved the way for the work of Avicenna (980–1037). Avicenna was one of the main interpreters of Aristotle. The school of thought he founded became known as Avicennism, which was built on ingredients and conceptual building blocks that are largely Aristotelian and Neoplatonist.

At the western end of the Mediterranean Sea, during the reign of Al-Hakam II (961 to 976) in Córdoba, a massive translation effort was undertaken, and many books were translated into Arabic. Averroes (1126–1198), who spent much of his life in Cordoba and Seville, was especially distinguished as a commentator of Aristotle. He often wrote two or three different commentaries on the same work, and some 38 commentaries by Averroes on the works of Aristotle have been identified. Although his writings had an only marginal impact in Islamic countries, his works would eventually have a huge impact in the Latin West, and would lead to the school of thought known as Averroism.

===Western Europe===
Although some knowledge of Aristotle seems to have lingered on in the ecclesiastical centres of western Europe after the fall of the Roman empire, by the ninth century, nearly all that was known of Aristotle consisted of Boethius&#x27;s commentaries on the &quot;Organon&quot;, and a few abridgments made by Latin authors of the declining empire, Isidore of Seville and Martianus Capella. From that time until the end of the eleventh century, little progress is apparent in Aristotelian knowledge.

The renaissance of the 12th century saw a major search by European scholars for new learning. James of Venice, who probably spent some years in Constantinople, translated Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Posterior Analytics&quot; from Greek into Latin in the mid-twelfth century, thus making the complete Aristotelian logical corpus, the &quot;Organon&quot;, available in Latin for the first time. Scholars travelled to areas of Europe that once had been under Muslim rule and still had substantial Arabic-speaking populations. From central Spain, which had returned to Christian rule in the eleventh century, scholars produced many of the Latin translations of the 12th century. The most productive of these translators was Gerard of Cremona, (–1187), who translated 87 books, which included many of the works of Aristotle such as his &quot;Posterior Analytics&quot;, &quot;Physics&quot;, &quot;On the Heavens&quot;, &quot;On Generation and Corruption&quot;, and &quot;Meteorology&quot;. Michael Scot (–1232) translated Averroes&#x27; commentaries on the scientific works of Aristotle.

Aristotle&#x27;s physical writings began to be discussed openly. At a time when Aristotle&#x27;s method was permeating all theology, these treatises were sufficient to cause his prohibition for heterodoxy in the Condemnations of 1210–1277. In the first of these, in Paris in 1210, it was stated that &quot;neither the books of Aristotle on natural philosophy or their commentaries are to be read at Paris in public or secret, and this we forbid under penalty of ex-communication.&quot; However, despite further attempts to restrict the teaching of Aristotle, by 1270, the ban on Aristotle&#x27;s natural philosophy was ineffective.

William of Moerbeke (–1286) undertook a complete translation of the works of Aristotle or, for some portions, a revision of existing translations. He was the first translator of the &quot;Politics&quot; () from Greek into Latin. Many copies of Aristotle in Latin then in circulation were assumed to have been influenced by Averroes, who was suspected of being a source of philosophical and theological errors found in the earlier translations of Aristotle. Such claims were without merit, however, as the &quot;Alexandrian&quot; Aristotelianism of Averroes followed &quot;the strict study of the text of Aristotle, which was introduced by Avicenna, [because] a large amount of traditional Neoplatonism was incorporated with the body of traditional Aristotelianism&quot;.

Albertus Magnus (–1280) was among the first medieval scholars to apply Aristotle&#x27;s philosophy to Christian thought. He produced paraphrases of most of the works of Aristotle available to him. He digested, interpreted and systematized the whole of Aristotle&#x27;s works, gleaned from the Latin translations and notes of the Arabian commentators, in accordance with Church doctrine. His efforts resulted in the formation of a Christian reception of Aristotle in the Western Europe. Albertus did not repudiate Plato. In that, he belonged to the dominant tradition of philosophy that preceded him, namely the &quot;concordist tradition&quot;, which sought to harmonize Aristotle with Plato through interpretation (see for example Porphyry&#x27;s &quot;On Plato and Aristotle Being Adherents of the Same School&quot;). Albertus famously wrote:

Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274), the pupil of Albertus Magnus, wrote a dozen commentaries on the works of Aristotle. Thomas was emphatically Aristotelian, he adopted Aristotle&#x27;s analysis of physical objects, his view of place, time and motion, his proof of the prime mover, his cosmology, his account of sense perception and intellectual knowledge, and even parts of his moral philosophy. The philosophical school that arose as a legacy of the work of Thomas Aquinas was known as Thomism, and was especially influential among the Dominicans, and later, the Jesuits.

Using Albert&#x27;s and Thomas&#x27;s commentaries, as well as Marsilius of Padua&#x27;s &quot;Defensor pacis&quot;, 14th-century scholar Nicole Oresme translated Aristotle&#x27;s moral works into French and wrote extensively comments on them.

===Modern era===
After retreating under criticism from modern natural philosophers, the distinctively Aristotelian idea of teleology was transmitted through Wolff and Kant to Hegel, who applied it to history as a totality. Although this project was criticized by Trendelenburg and Brentano as un-Aristotelian, Hegel&#x27;s influence is now often said to be responsible for an important Aristotelian influence upon Marx. Postmodernists, in contrast, reject Aristotelianism&#x27;s claim to reveal important theoretical truths. In this, they follow Heidegger&#x27;s critique of Aristotle as the greatest source of the entire tradition of Western philosophy.

==Contemporary==
===Ethics===
Aristotelianism is understood by its proponents as critically developing Plato&#x27;s theories. Some recent Aristotelian ethical and &#x27;practical&#x27; philosophy, such as that of Gadamer and McDowell, is often premised upon a rejection of Aristotelianism&#x27;s traditional metaphysical or theoretical philosophy. From this viewpoint, the early modern tradition of political republicanism, which views the &quot;res publica&quot;, public sphere or state as constituted by its citizens&#x27; virtuous activity, can appear thoroughly Aristotelian.

Mortimer J. Adler described Aristotle&#x27;s Nicomachean Ethics as a &quot;unique book in the Western tradition of moral philosophy, the only ethics that is sound, practical, and undogmatic.&quot;

The contemporary Aristotelian philosopher Alasdair MacIntyre helped to revive virtue ethics in his book &quot;After Virtue&quot;. MacIntyre revises Aristotelianism with the argument that the highest temporal goods, which are internal to human beings, are actualized through participation in social practices. He opposes Aristotelianism to the managerial institutions of capitalism and its state, and to rival traditions—including the philosophies of Hume, Kant, Kierkegaard, and Nietzsche—that reject its idea of essentially human goods and virtues and instead legitimize capitalism. Therefore, on MacIntyre&#x27;s account, Aristotelianism is not identical with Western philosophy as a whole; rather, it is &quot;the best theory so far, [including] the best theory so far about what makes a particular theory the best one.&quot; Politically and socially, it has been characterized as a newly &#x27;revolutionary Aristotelianism&#x27;. This may be contrasted with the more conventional, apolitical, and effectively conservative uses of Aristotle by, for example, Gadamer and McDowell. Other important contemporary Aristotelian theorists include Fred D. Miller, Jr. in politics and Rosalind Hursthouse in ethics.

===Meta-ontology===
Neo-Aristotelianism in meta-ontology holds that the goal of ontology is to determine which entities are fundamental and how the non-fundamental entities depend on them. The concept of fundamentality is usually defined in terms of metaphysical grounding. Fundamental entities are different from non-fundamental entities because they are not grounded in other entities. For example, it is sometimes held that elementary particles are more fundamental than the macroscopic objects (like chairs and tables) they compose. This is a claim about the grounding-relation between microscopic and macroscopic objects.

These ideas go back to Aristotle&#x27;s thesis that entities from different ontological categories have different degrees of fundamentality. For example, substances have the highest degree of fundamentality because they exist in themselves. Properties, on the other hand, are less fundamental because they depend on substances for their existence.

Jonathan Schaffer&#x27;s priority monism is a recent form of neo-Aristotelian ontology. He holds that there exists only one thing on the most fundamental level: the world as a whole. This thesis does not deny our common-sense intuition that the distinct objects we encounter in our everyday affairs like cars or other people exist. It only denies that these objects have the most fundamental form of existence.

===Problem of universals===
The problem of universals is the question of whether and in what way universals exist. Aristotelians and Platonists agree that universals have actual, mind-independent existence; thus they oppose the nominalist standpoint. Aristotelians disagree with Platonists, however, about the mode of existence of universals. Platonists hold that universals exist in some form of &quot;Platonic heaven&quot; and thus exist independently of their instances in the concrete, spatiotemporal world. Aristotelians, on the other hand, deny the existence of universals outside the spatiotemporal world. This view is known as immanent realism. For example, the universal &quot;red&quot; exists only insofar as there are red objects in the concrete world. Were there no red objects there would be no red-universal. This immanence can be conceived in terms of the theory of hylomorphism by seeing objects as composed of a universal form and the matter shaped by it.

David Malet Armstrong was a modern defender of Aristotelianism on the problem of universals. States of affairs are the basic building blocks of his ontology, and have particulars and universals as their constituents. Armstrong is an immanent realist in the sense that he holds that a universal exists only insofar as it is a constituent of at least one actual state of affairs. Universals without instances are not part of the world.

Taking a realist approach to universals also allows an Aristotelian realist philosophy of mathematics, according to which mathematics is a science of properties that are instantiated in the real (including physical) world, such as quantitative and structural properties.

<text>This article contains a list of all of the classes and orders that are located in the Phylum Chordata.

The subphyla Tunicata and Vertebrata are in the unranked Olfactores clade, while the subphylum Cephalochordata is not. Animals in Olfactores are characterized as having a more advanced olfactory system than animals not in it.

The only extinct classes shown are Placodermi and Acanthodii. Note that there are many other extinct chordate groups that are not shown here.

<doc id="309917" wikidata="Q157195" url="?curid=309917" title="Waiting staff">
<text>Waiting staff (BrE), waiters () / waitresses (), or servers (AmE) are those who work at a restaurant, a diner, or a bar and sometimes in private homes, attending to customers by supplying them with food and drink as requested. Waiting staff follow rules and guidelines determined by the manager. Waiting staff carry out many different tasks, such as taking orders, food-running, polishing dishes and silverware, helping bus tables, entertaining patrons, restocking working stations with needed supplies, and handing out the bill.

Waiting on tables is part of the service sector and among the most common occupations. In the United States, the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimated that, , there were about people employed as servers in the country.

Many restaurants choose a specific uniform for their waiting staff to wear. Waiting staff may receive tips as a minor or major part of their earnings, with customs varying widely from country to country.

==Terminology==
An individual &quot;waiting tables&quot; (or &quot;waiting on&quot; or &quot;waiting at tables&quot;) or &quot;waitering&quot; or &quot;waitressing&quot;  is commonly called a &quot;waiter&quot;, &quot;server&quot;, &quot;front server&quot;, &quot;waitress&quot;, &quot;member of the wait staff&quot;, &quot;waitstaff&quot;, &quot;serving staff&quot; &quot;server&quot;, &quot;waitperson&quot;, or &quot;waitron&quot;. The last two terms are gender neutral but rarely used, and the terms &quot;waiter&quot; and &quot;server&quot; are increasingly used for women too. Archaic terms such as &quot;serving girl&quot;, &quot;serving wench&quot;, or &quot;serving lad&quot; are generally used only within their historical context, and are generally seen as rude in the modern vocabulary.

==Roles==
In large luxury establishments, there are often multiple ranks of waiting staff in the dining room:
* Maître d&#x27;hôtel, responsible for dining room as a whole, greets guests; sometimes acts as headwaiter and/or supervisor
* Floor manager
* Expeditor, or &quot;Expo&quot;, responsible for ensuring accuracy and completeness of orders. The expeditor is also often responsible for preparing the tray for the servers so they can bring all of the plates of that course to all of the table guests at the same time
* Captain, responsible for several tables
* Waiter
* Front waiter
* Back waiter, who helps waiters refill water, replenish bread, etc.
* Bar back, who helps a bartender by bussing, and restocking glassware and alcohol
* Cocktail waitress
* Runner, who brings cooked dishes to diners
* Bevertainer, a cocktail waitress who also works as a singer and dancer
* Busser, busboy, clears tables, sets tables
In such restaurants, the captain is typically responsible for interacting with the diners and overseeing waiters.

There are also specialists, notably a sommelier for wine service, and occasionally a maître fromager for the cheese service. A host or hostess may be responsible for seating diners if there is not a maître d&#x27;hôtel.

==Duties==
Such duties of typical waiters include the following: preparing a section of tables before guests sit down (e.g., changing the tablecloth, putting out new utensils, cleaning chairs, etc.), although typically this is a responsibility of bussers; offering cocktails, specialty drinks, wine, beer, or other beverages; recommending food options; requesting the chef to make changes in how food is prepared; pre-clearing the tables; and serving food and beverages to customers. In some higher-end restaurants, servers have a good knowledge of the wine list and can recommend food–wine pairings. At more expensive restaurants, servers memorize the ingredients of the dishes and the manner in which the food is prepared; for example, if the menu lists marinated beef, the customer might ask what the beef is marinated in, for how long, and what cut of beef is used in the dish. Silver service staff are specially trained to serve at banquets or high-end restaurants. These servers follow specific rules and service guidelines, which makes this a skilled job. They generally wear black and white with a long, white apron (extending from the waist to the ankles).

The head server is in charge of the waiting staff and is also frequently responsible for assigning seating. The head server must insure that all staff do their duties accordingly. The functions of a head server can overlap to some degree with that of the maître d&#x27;hôtel. Restaurants in North America employ an additional level of waiting staff, known as &quot;busboys&quot; or &quot;busgirls&quot;, increasingly referred to as &quot;bussers&quot; or &quot;server assistants&quot;, to clear dirty dishes, set tables, and otherwise assist the waiting staff.

Emotional labour is often required of waiting staff.

Some waitstaff keep or consult blacklists of rude customers.

==Requirements==
Restaurant serving positions require on-the-job training that would be held by an upper-level server in the restaurant. The server will be trained to provide good customer service, learn food items and drinks, and maintain a neat and tidy appearance. Working in a role such as captain in a top rated restaurant requires disciplined role-playing comparable to a theater performance.

In the United States, some states require individuals employed to handle food and beverages to obtain a food handler&#x27;s card or permit. In those states, servers that do not have a permit or handler&#x27;s card can not serve. The server can achieve a permit or handler&#x27;s card online.

No food certification requirements are needed in Canada. However, to serve alcoholic beverages in Canada, servers must undergo their province&#x27;s online training course within a month of being hired.

==Gratuities==
Customs vary regionally regarding the payment of gratuities to waitstaff.

In the United States, a tip paid in addition to the amount presented on the bill for food and drinks is customary. At most sit-down restaurants, servers expect a tip after a patron has paid the check. The minimum legally-required hourly wage paid to waiters and waitresses in many U.S. states is lower than the minimum wage employers are required to pay for most other forms of labor to account for the tips, which form a significant portion of the server&#x27;s income. If wages and tips do not equal the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour during any week, the employer is required to increase cash wages to compensate for the difference.

<text>Raes Junction is a small settlement in New Zealand, located at the intersection of State Highways 8 and 90, in the lower South Island. The highways that meet at the junction are the main routes to the Clutha valley for travellers from Dunedin and Invercargill respectively.

Raes Junction is by road from Milton, from Gore, and from Alexandra. The junction lies to the south of the Clutha River. The nearest town of any significant size is Lawrence, which is to the southeast.

The area was named after James Rae, who operated &quot;J. Rae&#x27;s Junction Hotel&quot; during the late-1800s. The name for the area later became just &quot;Rae&#x27;s Junction&quot;, and eventually the possessive apostrophe was lost. The area was also known as Bastings, after Horace Bastings, a member of the Otago Provincial Council.

Although the settlement itself is little more than a farming and horticultural community, its location at this mid-way junction is thus of considerable regional importance, as is the larger settlement of Beaumont, some six kilometres to the southeast. The Raes Junction school opened in around 1884 and closed in 1927.

<text>The Holga is a medium format 120 film camera, made in Hong Kong, known for its low-fidelity aesthetic.

The Holga&#x27;s low-cost construction and simple meniscus lens often yields pictures that display vignetting, blur, light leaks and other distortions. The camera&#x27;s limitations have brought it a cult following among some photographers, and Holga photos have won awards and competitions in art and news photography. As of July 2017, the camera is in production after being unavailable for two years.

==History==
The Holga camera was designed by Lee Ting-mo in 1982. It first appeared in 1982 in British Hong Kong. At the time, 120 roll film in black-and-white was the most widely available film in neighbouring China. The Holga was intended to provide an inexpensive mass-market camera for the Chinese working class in order to record family portraits and events. However, the rapid adoption of the 35mm film format, due to new foreign camera and film imports, virtually eliminated the consumer market for 120 roll film in China. Seeking new markets, the manufacturer sought to distribute the Holga outside mainland China.

Within a few years after the Holga&#x27;s introduction to foreign markets, some photographers began using the Holga for its surrealistic, impressionistic renderings of landscape, still life, portrait and especially street photography. These owners prized the Holga for its lack of precision, light leaks and inexpensive qualities, which enabled the photographer to concentrate on innovation and creative vision in place of increasingly expensive camera technology. In this respect, the Holga became the successor to the Diana and other toy cameras previously used in such work. A Holga photograph by photojournalist David Burnett of former vice-president Al Gore during a 2000 campaign appearance earned a top prize in a 2001 White House News Photographers&#x27; Association &quot;Eyes of History&quot; award ceremony.

Recently, the Holga has experienced renewed consumer interest outside China due to the increasing popularity of toy cameras and a continuing counterculture response to the increasing complexity of modern cameras.

In late November 2015, Freestyle Photographic Supplies COO Gerald H. Karmele confirmed that Tokina had shut down the factory that produced Holga cameras and related accessories, ending the production of these toy cameras. A revitalized, but saturated, toy camera market led to waning sales. However, as of July 2017, Freestyle reported that the moulds had been tracked down, put back into production, and the Holgas were to be available once again.

==Lens and aperture settings==

Most Holga cameras use a single-piece plastic meniscus lens with a focal length of 60 millimeters and utilize a zone-focus system that can adjust from about 1 meter (3 feet) to infinity. Like any simple meniscus lens, the Holga lens exhibits soft focus and chromatic aberration. Other Holga variants, denoted either by the letter &#x27;G&#x27; in their model name, or the name WOCA, feature a simple glass lens, but are otherwise identical in construction. The manufacturer has since outsourced supply of the varying plastic and glass lenses to contractors in Japan and China

There is an aperture setting switch on the camera with two positions indicated by pictorial ideograms: &quot;sunny&quot; and &quot;cloudy&quot;, with a nominal value of and , respectively. Due to a manufacturing oversight, this switch has no effect on pre-2009 production cameras, and the actual aperture is around , giving the Holga just one aperture. The problem is reported as having been fixed in cameras post-2009, providing two working aperture settings of and , and earlier cameras are modifiable to provide two usable settings. Apertures of and work well for ISO200 speed films, while settings of and tend to suit faster films of around ISO400.

==Film format==
The Holga was originally designed to accept either a 6×4.5 format or a 6×6 (square) format. However, once the camera went into production, vignetting (darkening of the corners of the finished photograph) occurred when the camera was modified to a 6×6 format. Hence, early Holgas had their film size switches tightly fixed to shoot only 6×4.5 format. Many owners removed both this restriction and the 6×4.5 film mask as well, finding the resultant vignetting a desirable effect. Later Holgas such as the 120N come with two masks for both the 6×4.5 and 6×6 format. Holgas can even be modified to use 35 mm film.

The Holga has one shutter speed – approximately 1/100 of a second. The camera can shoot 16 exposures per 120 roll in 6x4.5 cm format or 12 exposures in 6x6 format. Film is advanced by a knob on the top of the camera, and frame numbers printed on the backing paper of the film can be viewed through a red window on the back of the Holga. The number of frames chosen is indicated by the black arrow.

==Modifications and variants==
Holga cameras are often modified:
* A Holga&#x27;s interior can be &quot;flocked&quot;—coated with matte black paint—in order to limit the effect of light bouncing off the plastic interior from light leaks.
* The red window on the camera back can be blocked by an improvised cover to eliminate light leaks when using panchromatic films
* The Holga&#x27;s aperture switch can be modified as needed to provide a larger (&#x27;cloudy&#x27;) or smaller (&#x27;sunny&#x27;) aperture.
* The lens, and sometimes the entire shutter assembly, can be replaced with a pinhole (the &quot;Pinholga&quot;).
* The plastic lens can be replaced with a glass version (the &quot;Woca&quot;) or can be completely removed.
* Newer models of the camera come with multiple optional frame inserts (4.5 × 6 cm and 6 × 6 cm). Shooting without an insert can lead to problems keeping the 120 size film flat against the film plane.
* Inserting cardboard or foam or felt padding under or behind the film spool to provide proper film tensioning

* The Holga TIM camera has two fixed focus plastic lenses which work simultaneously, allowing for the capture of 3D images.
Some modifications permit the use of other film formats:
* Holga cameras have been used for making wet plate collodion images, or &quot;Holgatypes&quot;.
* Holga cameras may be fitted with a Polaroid back, allowing use of Polaroid 80 series instant film, or with newer models, 100 series film (but the image is not centered). This modification, sometimes termed a &quot;Holgaroid&quot; or &quot;Polga&quot;, renders the viewfinder unusable, but allows for instant Holga prints.
* By sandwiching a normal 35 mm roll of film into the Holga&#x27;s 120 spool, &quot;sprocket hole&quot; exposures may be taken that expose the entire surface of 135 film.
* Cameras such as the Hasselblad have been modified to make use of a Holga lens.
* Holga plastic lenses have also been adapted to the Canon EOS, the Nikon f-mount, Pentax, Sony, Olympus and Minolta. An f-mount, &#x27;melted&#x27; plastic Holga lens has been used on a digital f-mount camera while the EOS Holga has been mounted to the latest Canon DSLRs. Adapted lenses are also commercially available.

===Concept &quot;Holga D&quot;===
In 2010, designer Saikat Biswas proposed a concept for a digital version of the Holga camera, called &quot;Holga D&quot;. It has a modernized case, but retains the simplicity of the original camera. However, there is no evidence of current plans to produce this device, or produce any other digital version.

===Holga Digital===
On 27 August 2015, a Kickstarter campaign was launched to fund the creation of a digital camera styled after a Holga 120, called the &quot;Holga Digital.&quot; This model includes a glass optic with and aperture settings and a sliding switch that alternates between black and white and color mode. It has a low-noise CMOS color sensor with an 8-megapixel resolution. The camera does not have a means of viewing the pictures saved to its SD Card.

===Holga Lens===

There are also available Holga lenses for digital cameras.

==Accessories==
Accessories exist that will do the same thing as a modified Holga without the need for physical modifications as well as accessories for special effects. Such accessories include:
* Cable release, which slips onto the lens so that a cable release can depress the shutter. Also includes tripod mount since the Holga 120N&#x27;s mount is covered by the accessory.
* 35 mm Film Adapter, available in two models: full negative and &quot;panoramic.&quot; Both adapters come with a light-proof back and a mask made to hold the 135 canister in place. The only difference between the two models is the size of the mask. The &quot;panoramic&quot; adapter will mask out the sprocket holes. A rarer model available in Japan is an all-in-one back and cartridge unit.
* Fisheye lens, produces circular Fisheye images.
* Filter holder and filters. Filter holders can hold one or two filters, depending on the model of the holder. Filters come in special effect filters, color filters, and center spot filters (which leaves a normal center, but a colored surrounding).
* Holgon Flash, a small normal flash for Holgas with a hot shoe.
* Holgon Strobe Flash, a bulky flash which features multi flash strobe (which keeps flashing as long as the shutter stays open in bulb mode) or single flash (a more powerful flash, which will flash once on pressing the shutter and a second time on release). Features vertical adjustable angles.
* Holgon Slave Flash, a small, round slave flash meant for placing on a surface or handheld. Good for any kind of secondary light. Some units will come with multi colored filters to place over the flash.
* Camera bags, available in a small and a large size.
* Holga Enlargers, an inexpensive darkroom enlarger with two available lenses and several masks/negative carriers for both 120 and 35 mm formats.
* Holga iPhone Filter and Case was released at the end of 2011 and has opened up a new market for Holga accessories (smartphone)

==Observation==
Holga Week is observed in the first week of September, every year. Holga cameras are also celebrated on World Toy Camera Day, which is celebrated every year on October 20.

<text>Benjamin Silliman (August 8, 1779 – November 24, 1864) was an American chemist and science educator. He was one of the first American professors of science, at Yale College, the first person to use the process of fractional distillation in America. He was a founder of the &quot;American Journal of Science&quot;, the oldest continuously published scientific journal in the United States.

==Early life==
Silliman was born in a tavern in North Stratford, now Trumbull, Connecticut, to Mary (Fish) Silliman (widow of John Noyes) and General Gold Selleck Silliman. He was born in August 1779, several months after British forces took his father prisoner and his mother had fled their home in Fairfield, Connecticut, to escape 2,000 British troops who burned Fairfield center to the ground.

Silliman was educated at Yale, receiving a B.A. degree in 1796 and a M.A. in 1799. He studied law with Simeon Baldwin from 1798 to 1799 and became a tutor at Yale from 1799 to 1802. He was admitted to the bar in 1802. That same year he was hired by Yale President Timothy Dwight IV as a professor of chemistry and natural history. Silliman, who had never studied chemistry, prepared for the job by studying chemistry with Professor James Woodhouse at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. In 1804, he delivered his first lectures in chemistry, which were also the first science lectures ever given at Yale. In 1805, he traveled to University of Edinburgh for further study.

==Career==
Returning to New Haven, he studied its geology. His chemical analysis of a meteorite that fell in 1807 near Weston, Connecticut, was the first published scientific account of an American meteorite. He lectured publicly at New Haven in 1808 and came to discover many of the constituent elements of many minerals. Some time around 1818, Ephraim Lane took some samples of rocks he found at an area called Saganawamps, now a part of the Old Mine Park Archeological Site in Trumbull, to Silliman for identification. Silliman reported in his new &quot;American Journal of Science&quot;, a publication covering all the natural sciences but with an emphasis on geology, that he had identified tungsten, tellurium, topaz and fluorite in the rocks. He played a major role in the discoveries of the first articulated fossil fishes found in the United States, which he discovered in Newark Supergroup deposits near Connecticut, and were later described as the genera &quot;Redfieldius&quot; and &quot;Semionotus&quot;. In 1837, the first prismatic barite ore of tungsten in the United States was discovered at the mine. The mineral sillimanite was named after Silliman in 1850. Upon the founding of the medical school, he also taught there as one of the founding faculty members.

In 1833 he discussed the relationship of Flood geology to the Genesis account and also wrote about this topic in 1840.

Silliman was an early supporter of coeducation in the Ivy League. Although Yale would not admit women as students until over 100 years later, he allowed young women into his lecture classes. His efforts convinced Frederick Barnard, later president of Columbia College, that women ought to be admitted as students. &quot;The elder Silliman, during the entire period of his distinguished career as a Professor of Chemistry, Geology and Mineralogy in Yale College, was accustomed every year to admit to his lecture-courses classes of young women from the schools of New Haven. In that institution the undersigned had an opportunity to observe, as a student, the effect of the practice, similar to that which he afterward created for himself in Alabama, as a teacher. The results in both instances, so far as they went, were good; and they went far enough to make it evident that if the presence of young women in college, instead of being occasional, should be constant, they would be better.&quot;

American historian David McCullough mentions in his book about early 19th century Americans in Paris that in 1825 Silliman, while on a tour of Europe conferring with other scientists, encountered his former Yale science student Samuel Morse in the Louvre. As professor emeritus, he delivered lectures at Yale on geology until 1855; Silliman had been the first person to use the process of fractional distillation, and, in 1854 his son Benjamin Silliman Jr became the first person to fractionate petroleum by distillation. In 1864 Silliman noted oil seeps in the Ojai, California, area. In 1866, this led to the start of oil exploration and development in the Ojai Basin.

Like his son-in-law James Dana, Silliman was a Christian. In an address delivered before the &quot;Association of American Geologists&quot; he spoke in favor of old Earth creationism, stating:

In the same line of thought, he posed arguments against atheism and materialism.

===1807 meteor===

At 6:30 in the morning of December 14, 1807, a blazing fireball about two-thirds the apparent size of the Moon in the sky, was seen traveling southwards by early risers in Vermont and Massachusetts. Three loud explosions were heard over Weston, Connecticut. Stone fragments fell in at least 6 places. The largest and only unbroken stone, which weighed 36.5 pounds (16.5 kilograms), was found some days after Silliman and Kingsley had spent several fruitless hours hunting for it. The owner, a Trumbull farmer named Elijah Seeley, was urged to present it to Yale by local people who had met the professors during their investigation, but he insisted on putting it up for sale. It was purchased by Colonel George Gibbs for his large and famous collection of minerals; when the collection became the property of Yale in 1825, Silliman finally acquired this stone; the only specimen of the Weston meteorite that remains in the Yale Peabody Museum collection today.

==Personal life==
His first marriage was on September 17, 1809, to Harriet Trumbull, daughter of Connecticut Governor Jonathan Trumbull Jr. Silliman and his wife had four children: one daughter married Professor Oliver P. Hubbard, another married Professor James Dwight Dana (Silliman&#x27;s doctoral student until 1833 and assistant from 1836 to 1837); and youngest daughter Julia married Edward Whiting Gilman, brother of Yale graduate and educator Daniel Coit Gilman. His son Benjamin Silliman Jr., also a professor of chemistry at Yale, wrote a report that convinced investors to back George Bissell&#x27;s seminal search for oil. His second marriage was in 1851 to Mrs. Sarah Isabella (McClellan) Webb, daughter of John McClellan. Silliman died at New Haven in 1864 and is buried in Grove Street Cemetery.

==Legacy==
Silliman deemed slavery an &quot;enormous evil&quot;. He favored colonization of free African Americans in Liberia, serving as a board member of the Connecticut Colonization Society between 1828 and 1835. He was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1813, and an Associate Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1815. Silliman founded and edited the &quot;American Journal of Science&quot;, and was appointed one of the corporate members of the National Academy of Sciences by the United States Congress. He was also a member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Silliman College, one of Yale&#x27;s residential colleges, is named for him, as is the mineral Sillimanite. In Sequoia National Park, Mount Silliman is named for him, as is Silliman Pass, a creek and two lakes below the summit of Mount Silliman.

<doc id="309921" wikidata="Q743391" url="?curid=309921" title="European Automobile Manufacturers Association">
<text>The European Automobile Manufacturers Association (; abbreviated ACEA) is the main lobbying and standards group of the automobile industry in the European Union. In February 1991 it became the successor of the CCMC manufacturers committee () which was founded in October 1972.

Its members include: BMW, DAF, Daimler Truck, Ferrari, Ford of Europe, Honda, Hyundai Motor Europe, Iveco, JLR, Mercedes-Benz Group, Nissan, Renault, Toyota Europe, Volkswagen Group and Volvo Group.

One major area of ACEA work including its predecessor associations has been in performance quality classifications for 4-stroke engine oils. That history goes back to 1919 (Bureau Permanent International des Constructeurs d&#x27;Automobile – BPICA) that was renamed in 1985 (Organisation Internationale des Constructeurs d&#x27;Automobiles – OICA). The ACEA has its predecessor in the CCMC (Comité des Constructeurs du Marché Commun) founded in October 1972 by French (Citroën, Peugeot, Renault), German (Mercedes, Volkswagen), Italian (Fiat) and British (BLMC) manufacturers.

The ACEA is studying electric vehicle charging stations and expects that Type 2 Mode 3 connectors also to be used for home charging in the second phase after 2017 while still allowing Mode 2 charging with established plug types that are already available in home environments.

The group also raises awareness of safety technology to improve road safety.

== Former members ==
On 13 June 2022, Stellantis announced it would leave the European carmaker association ACEA by the end of 2022 as part of a new approach to addressing issues and challenges of future mobility, including a shift away from traditional lobbying activity.

On 8 July 2022, Volvo Cars announced to leave ACEA by the end of 2022, citing differences between its zero-emission strategy and that of the ACEA.

== Presidents ==
The presidency had been rotated among French, Italian and German automobile manufacturers.

== Research ==
Collaborative research activities of the automotive manufacturers and other efforts are carried out under the auspices of the European Council for Automotive Research and Development (EUCAR). Together with automotive suppliers, the automotive manufacturers support 30% of all research and development in the European Union.

EUCAR was founded in 1994 and is hosted within ACEA.

<doc id="309930" wikidata="Q760106" url="?curid=309930" title="Lift coefficient">
<text>In fluid dynamics, the lift coefficient () is a dimensionless quantity that relates the lift generated by a lifting body to the fluid density around the body, the fluid velocity and an associated reference area. A lifting body is a foil or a complete foil-bearing body such as a fixed-wing aircraft. is a function of the angle of the body to the flow, its Reynolds number and its Mach number. The section lift coefficient refers to the dynamic lift characteristics of a two-dimensional foil section, with the reference area replaced by the foil chord.

==Definitions ==
The lift coefficient &quot;C&quot;L is defined by

:formula_1 ,
where 
formula_2 is the lift force, formula_3 is the relevant surface area and formula_4 is the fluid dynamic pressure, in turn linked to the fluid density formula_5, and to the flow speed formula_6. The choice of the reference surface should be specified since it is arbitrary. For example, for cylindric profiles (the 3D extrusion of an airfoil in the spanwise direction), the first axis generating the surface is always in the spanwise direction. In aerodynamics and thin airfoil theory, the second axis is commonly in the chordwise direction:

:formula_7

resulting in a coefficient:

:formula_8

While in marine dynamics and for thick airfoils, the second axis is sometimes taken in the thickness direction:

:formula_9

resulting in a different coefficient:

:formula_10

The ratio between these two coefficients is the thickness ratio:

:formula_11

The lift coefficient can be approximated using the lifting-line theory, numerically calculated or measured in a wind tunnel test of a complete aircraft configuration.

== Section lift coefficient ==

Lift coefficient may also be used as a characteristic of a particular shape (or cross-section) of an airfoil. In this application it is called the section lift coefficient formula_12. It is common to show, for a particular airfoil section, the relationship between section lift coefficient and angle of attack. It is also useful to show the relationship between section lift coefficient and drag coefficient.

The section lift coefficient is based on two-dimensional flow over a wing of infinite span and non-varying cross-section so the lift is independent of spanwise effects and is defined in terms of formula_13, the lift force per unit span of the wing. The definition becomes

:formula_14

where formula_15 is the reference length that should always be specified: in aerodynamics and airfoil theory usually the airfoil chord is chosen, while in marine dynamics and for struts usually the thickness formula_16 is chosen. Note this is directly analogous to the drag coefficient since the chord can be interpreted as the &quot;area per unit span&quot;.

For a given angle of attack, &quot;c&quot;l can be calculated approximately using the thin airfoil theory, calculated numerically or determined from wind tunnel tests on a finite-length test piece, with end-plates designed to ameliorate the three-dimensional effects. Plots of &quot;c&quot;l versus angle of attack show the same general shape for all airfoils, but the particular numbers will vary. They show an almost linear increase in lift coefficient with increasing angle of attack with a gradient known as the lift slope. For a thin airfoil of any shape the lift slope is π2/90 ≃ 0.11 per degree. At higher angles a maximum point is reached, after which the lift coefficient reduces. The angle at which maximum lift coefficient occurs is the stall angle of the airfoil, which is approximately 10 to 15 degrees on a typical airfoil.

The stall angle for a given profile is also increasing with increasing values of the Reynolds number, at higher speeds indeed the flow tends to stay attached to the profile for longer delaying the stall condition. For this reason sometimes wind tunnel testing performed at lower Reynolds numbers than the simulated real life condition can sometimes give conservative feedback overestimating the profiles stall.

Symmetric airfoils necessarily have plots of cl versus angle of attack symmetric about the &quot;c&quot;l axis, but for any airfoil with positive camber, i.e. asymmetrical, convex from above, there is still a small but positive lift coefficient with angles of attack less than zero. That is, the angle at which &quot;c&quot;l = 0 is negative. On such airfoils at zero angle of attack the pressures on the upper surface are lower than on the lower surface.

<doc id="309935" wikidata="Q4355602" url="?curid=309935" title="Art Bell">
<text>Arthur William Bell III (June 17, 1945 – April 13, 2018) was an American broadcaster and author. He was the founder and the original host of the paranormal-themed radio program &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot;, which is syndicated on hundreds of radio stations in the United States and Canada. He also created and hosted its companion show &quot;Dreamland&quot;. &quot;Coast to Coast&quot; still airs nightly, now hosted weeknights by George Noory. Bell&#x27;s past shows from 1996 to 2000 are repeated on Premiere Networks on Saturday evenings. They are retitled &quot;Somewhere in Time with Art Bell&quot;.

In 2003, Bell semi-retired from &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot;. During the following four years, he hosted the show for many weekends on Premiere Networks. He announced his retirement from weekend hosting in 2007, but occasionally served as a guest host through 2010. He started a new nightly show, &quot;Art Bell&#x27;s Dark Matter&quot;, on Sirius XM Radio, that aired for six weeks in 2013.

In 2015, he returned to radio with a new show &quot;Midnight in the Desert&quot;, which was available online via TuneIn as well as some terrestrial radio stations. He retired on December 11, 2015, citing security concerns at his home in Pahrump, Nevada, west of Las Vegas.

Bell was the founder and original owner of Pahrump-based radio station KNYE 95.1 FM. His broadcast studio and transmitter were located near his home, where he also hosted &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot;.

== Early life ==
Bell was born in North Carolina. Sources differ on whether he was born in Jacksonville or Camp Lejeune. Both of his parents served in the United States military. He had a Lutheran background.

Bell was always interested in radio; at the age of 13, he became a licensed amateur radio operator. Bell held an Amateur Extra Class license, which is in the top U.S. Federal Communications Commission license class. His call sign was W6OBB.

In the 1960s Bell served in the U.S. Air Force for four years and was a medic during the Vietnam War. Although not involved in combat, he was stationed for a short time at a hospital in Da Nang. At this hospital and others, such as Clark Air Base in the Philippines, he witnessed the effects of the war first-hand, something he did not like to recall or talk about.

While in the military, Bell, with a few friends on base, operated a pirate radio station at Amarillo Air Force Base. After receiving support from the base commander, they expanded the operation, playing music for the entire base; the signal was strong enough to be picked up in the city of Amarillo. When local radio stations learned of the pirate station&#x27;s popularity (when it appeared in the Arbitron ratings), it was forced to shut down after being on the air for a year. This was the start of Bell&#x27;s radio career.

After leaving military service in 1966, Bell worked at several radio stations in the States before moving to Okinawa, where he was a disc jockey for six years at KSBK, the only non-military English-language station in Japan. While there, he claimed to set two &quot;world records&quot;, first by staying on the air without sleep for five days and nights (115 hours and 15 minutes). He later wrote that this extreme sleep deprivation was a strange experience and something he would never do again. He said that as he went about his normal routine, such as walking to the refrigerator during a break, it was as if he was &quot;floating around in a different world&quot;, and things seemed &quot;unreal&quot;. The second &quot;world record&quot; he claimed to set was for the longest continuous broadcast while seesawing, after seesawing for 57 hours while broadcasting.

Bell soon returned to the States, where he had a career in rock music radio for the next 20 years.

While working at a rock music station in Anchorage, he learned about Amerasian children stranded in Saigon in the final days before the U.S. pullout from Vietnam in 1975. He spoke about it on-air and listeners in Alaska started to send in donations. The money raised allowed the chartering of a Douglas DC-8 to fly to Vietnam and rescue approximately 120 orphans. They were brought to the United States and adopted by American families.

== Broadcasting career ==
Bell was a rock music disc jockey before he moved into talk radio. His original 1978 late-night Las Vegas program on KDWN was a political call-in show under the name &quot;West Coast AM&quot;. In 1988, Bell and Alan Corbeth renamed the show &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot; and moved its broadcast from the Plaza Hotel in Las Vegas to Bell&#x27;s home in Pahrump.
Bell abandoned conventional political talk in favor of topics such as gun control and conspiracy theories, leading to a significant increase in his overnight ratings. The show&#x27;s focus again shifted significantly after the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995. Many in the media did not want to be blamed for inciting anti-government or militia actions like the bombing. Subsequently, Bell discussed offbeat topics such as the paranormal, the occult, UFOs, protoscience and pseudoscience. During his tenure at KDWN Bell met and married his third wife, Ramona, who later handled production and management duties for the program.

An article in the February 23, 1997, edition of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said that Bell was currently America&#x27;s highest-rated late-night radio talk show host, broadcast on 328 stations. According to &quot;The Oregonian&quot; in its June 22, 1997, edition, &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot; with Art Bell was on 460 stations. At its initial peak in popularity, &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot; was syndicated on more than 500 radio stations and claimed 15 million listeners nightly. Bell&#x27;s studios were located in his home in the town of Pahrump, located in Nye County, Nevada; hence, the voice-over catchphrase, &quot;from the Kingdom of Nye&quot;.

=== Critical reputation ===
Fans regarded Bell as a master showman, noting that he called his show &quot;absolute entertainment&quot; and expressly said he did not necessarily accept every guest or caller&#x27;s claims, but only offered a forum where they would not be openly ridiculed. Bell was one of the few talk show hosts who did not screen incoming calls, but this changed in 2006.

Ed Dames, Richard C. Hoagland, Terence McKenna, Dannion Brinkley, David John Oates, and Robert Bigelow were all regular guests. Some of Bell&#x27;s regular guests continue to appear on &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot; now hosted by George Noory.

Bell&#x27;s own interests, however, extended beyond the paranormal. He interviewed singers Crystal Gayle, Willie Nelson, Merle Haggard, Eric Burdon and Gordon Lightfoot, comedian George Carlin, writer Dean Koontz, hard science fiction writer Greg Bear, &quot;X-Files&quot; writer/creator Chris Carter, TV talk host Regis Philbin, &quot;Star Trek&quot; actor Leonard Nimoy, actor Dan Aykroyd, former Luftwaffe pilot Bruno Stolle, actress Jane Seymour, actress Ellen Muth, actor and TV host Robert Stack, human rights lawyer John Loftus, legendary disc jockey Casey Kasem, UFC commentator Joe Rogan and frequent guests physicist Michio Kaku and SETI astronomers Seth Shostak and H. Paul Shuch.

Beginning in late 1996, Bell was criticized for reporting rumors that Comet Hale–Bopp was being trailed by a UFO. Some speculated that members of the Heaven&#x27;s Gate group committed mass suicide based on rumors Bell aired. Others dismissed the idea, noting that the Heaven&#x27;s Gate website stated: &quot;Whether Hale-Bopp has a &#x27;companion&#x27; or not is irrelevant from our perspective.&quot; Susan Wright reported that later, Bell was also &quot;one of the first to publicize expert opinions refuting the &#x27;alien&#x27; companion&quot; said to have been shadowing Hale-Bopp, such as that published in 1998 from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory suggesting that &quot;the satellite&#x27;s main diameter is ~30 km,&quot; (20 miles) and accordingly natural rather than artificial.

=== Notable callers and guests ===
Though best known for discussing conspiracy theories and paranormal topics, Bell&#x27;s interests and interviews were wide-ranging. He interviewed musicians Willie Nelson, Crystal Gayle, and Merle Haggard; science fiction author Jerry Pournelle; and comedians George Carlin and Joe Rogan. Author Dean Koontz was a fan of &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot;, being interviewed on January 22, 2002 to promote his horror-suspense novel &quot;One Door Away from Heaven&quot;, which featured a brief reference to Bell. Koontz&#x27;s 2002 novel &quot;By the Light of the Moon&quot; has a supporting character named Parish Lantern, described as the deep-voiced host of an overnight call-in show which discusses extraterrestrials. 

Bell had several semi-regular guests, including theoretical physicist Michio Kaku; controversial Catholic priest Malachi Martin; journalists George Knapp and Linda Moulton Howe; conspiracy theorist Richard C. Hoagland, and self-proclaimed remote viewer Ed Dames.

On August 15, 1996, Bell interviewed William Luther Pierce, author of the novel &quot;The Turner Diaries&quot;. Pierce, writing under the pseudonym &quot;Andrew Macdonald&quot;, depicted a race war leading to the extermination of Jews, non-whites and homosexuals. Pierce denounced interracial marriage, calling white people who married non-whites &quot;traitors to the white race&quot;. Bell agreed with Pierce on the dangers of politicians abusing their power, but rejected Pierce&#x27;s racist views. Bell also interviewed neo-nazi Tom Metzger, and mentioned his Filipino wife: &quot;&#x27;I am married to a brown-skinned Asian woman. What does that make me?&#x27; To which Metzger replied, &#x27;A traitor to your race.&#x27;&quot;

One of Bell&#x27;s most famous &quot;Coast to Coast&quot; interviews occurred in 1997 with a man who identified himself as Mel Waters and discussed what is known as &quot;Mel&#x27;s Hole&quot; in rural Washington. The opening is said to be a fantastically deep vertical shaft which possesses bizarre properties. No such hole has ever been physically located by anyone attempting to verify this story.

A caller in 2000 named &quot;Daniel Murray&quot; claimed he was a Majestic Agent from Downey, California. This call served as the inspiration for the alternate reality game &quot;Majestic.&quot;

A caller in September 1997 claimed he had discovered an unknown threat and conspiracy from Area 51, and his life was in danger by even talking about it. For unknown reasons, Bell lost connection to his transmitter during the call and, just as the caller&#x27;s voice became more and more agitated, the entire broadcast dramatically went silent. A confused Bell restored the signal about 20 minutes later. The caller (or someone sounding similar) called in on a subsequent show and admitted it had been an elaborate hoax, which fooled many. Audio from the call was used in the Tool song &quot;Faaip De Oiad,&quot; on the album &quot;Lateralus&quot; as well as on The Faceless song &quot;Planetary Duality: I (Hideous Revelation)&quot; on the album &quot;Planetary Duality&quot;.

== Retirements and comebacks ==
Bell retired and returned to &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot; several times.

On October 13, 1998, Bell announced his first retirement, which was highly unexpected by his listeners. He spoke of &quot;an event, a threatening terrible event occurred to my family, which I could not tell you about. Because of that event, and a succession of other events, what you&#x27;re listening to right now is my final broadcast on the air.&quot; Hilly Rose filled in after Bell&#x27;s departure. Bell returned on October 28, 1998, asserting that the brief departure was brought on by threats made against his family. On May 29, 1999, Bell explained that this retirement was due to an allegation made by hosts of WWCR shortwave radio that Bell had paid to cover up a criminal indictment. The facts of the matter became public knowledge in 2000, when the media revealed that an actual criminal indictment was filed against a person who had assaulted a member of Bell&#x27;s family. Because of the nature of the crime, Bell had wanted to keep the matter private. Ted Gunderson, the former head of the Los Angeles FBI and the hosts at WWCR shortwave radio had accused Bell of the crime. Bell responded by taking legal action against Gunderson, as well as the hosts and stations. The action was resolved in a settlement in 2000.

On April 1, 2000, Bell again announced his retirement. He said that the event would occur on April 26, 2000, but offered no details other than expressing intentions to &quot;resolve a family crisis.&quot; On April 11, 2000, Mike Siegel was introduced as the new host of &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot;, taking over on April 27, to an estimated audience of 22 million listeners. The media later explained that Bell had left to deal with the aftermath of the kidnap and sexual assault of his son. Brian Lepley, a substitute teacher, was convicted of sexual assault and attempted transmission of HIV and was sentenced to 10 to 25 years. Bell returned to &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot; in February 2001. Bell noted that since his departure the show had lost a number of affiliates, commercial content had risen to an unbearable level, and Siegel had taken the program in a &quot;different direction&quot; of which Bell disapproved. Bell retained some authority over the program as its creator and felt his return was necessary.

On October 23, 2002, Bell announced that he would retire again due to recurring back pain, which was the result of a fall from a telephone pole during his youth. Bell was replaced by George Noory as weekday host of &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot; on January 1, 2003. Those close to the matter also said that Barbara Simpson would host weekends and that Bell planned to be an occasional guest host for Noory. Bell returned in September 2003 as a weekend host, replacing Barbara Simpson and Ian Punnett as host of the Saturday and Sunday evening broadcasts. In June 2005, he scaled this schedule back, calling it a &quot;semiretirement,&quot; and hosted only the last two Sundays of every month. Bell went back to hosting every weekend show as his schedule permitted after his wife Ramona&#x27;s death a few months later.

On July 1, 2007, Bell announced his retirement, stating that he wished to spend more time with his new wife and daughter. He made it explicit that, unlike the circumstances surrounding previous retirements, this decision was entirely positive and joyful and that he would not disappear completely, announcing an intention to occasionally substitute for other hosts and host &quot;special&quot; shows.

On December 11, 2015, Bell posted what would be his final retirement message via his Facebook page. He cited safety concerns for his family by saying &quot;if one of them were harmed because of what I love doing my life would be over.&quot; Throughout the fall, Bell reported several incidents where an unknown number of armed trespassers came onto his property, sometimes firing gunshots. These events have been said to occur during or around the time of his broadcasting. This announcement came a mere five months after the start of his most recent show, &quot;Midnight in the Desert&quot;.

== Events of 2006 ==
=== Death of Ramona Bell ===
On January 5, 2006, Ramona Bell, his wife of 15 years, died unexpectedly at the age of 47 of what appeared to be an acute asthma attack in Laughlin, Nevada, where the couple had been taking a short vacation.

During the January 22 broadcast of &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot;, Bell described in great detail the events surrounding his wife&#x27;s death. For weeks thereafter, callers to the station would speak to George Noory and express their sadness and sympathy for Bell; Noory had taken Bell&#x27;s place on weekdays beginning in 2002.

=== Change in schedule ===
On January 21, 2006, 16 days after the unexpected death of his wife Ramona, Bell announced he would host &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot; every Saturday and Sunday evening, and that former weekend host Ian Punnett would work a new live prefeed program for the four hours preceding Bell&#x27;s slot on Saturday nights (9:00 pm – 1:00 am ET).

=== Return to &quot;the High Desert and the Great American Southwest&quot; ===
Bell opened his December 28, 2006, program by disclosing that he had just relocated back from the Philippines to Pahrump, Nevada, with his wife Airyn.

== Events of 2008 ==

On May 29, 2008, Bell sold KNYE to station manager Karen Jackson.

On September 8, 2008, Noory stated that he would be hosting the annual &quot;Ghost to Ghost AM&quot; Halloween call-in show rather than Bell, who normally returned to &quot;Coast to Coast&quot; to host it (along with the New Year&#x27;s prediction shows).

On November 30, 2008, Bell hosted &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot;. Michio Kaku was the guest. This was the first time Bell had hosted the show since May 23, 2008.

Bell was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame in 2008.

== Events of 2009 ==
Bell was scheduled to return to &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot; on April 24, 2009, to host an evening of open lines, but because of engineering problems in Manila, Bell was rescheduled to a later date.

On May 17, 2009, Bell returned to host &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot; live from Manila. His guest was professor Peter Ward. Topics of discussion were mass extinctions, Earth&#x27;s &quot;self-destructive&quot; phenomena, and life beyond planet Earth. While on the air, Bell answered an email question from a listener who asked why he was in the Philippines again and how long he would be there. Bell replied that he would address it on &quot;Friday&quot; and hinted that his move might be permanent.

As of May 20, 2009, the &quot;Coast to Coast&quot; website listed that Bell would be filling in for George Noory on Friday, May 22, 2009, to interview Bob Koontz. However, Bell did not do that show. The &quot;Coast to Coast&quot; website, again, cited technical difficulties in Manila and that his interview would be postponed. Bell interviewed Koontz on Saturday, June 6, 2009.

Friday June 26, 2009, Bell hosted &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot; from Manila with guest Dean Radin. He also commented on the death of Michael Jackson and how he had lived in Pahrump, Nevada, not far from Bell&#x27;s residence.

Friday November 20, 2009, Bell hosted &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot; from Manila with guest Starfire Tor, psi researcher and experiencer who discussed time shifts and time slips, and other strange occurrences of time. During the first 90 minutes, they were joined by Whitley Strieber, who shared his take on Tor&#x27;s research.

On Wednesday, December 30, and Thursday, December 31, 2009, Bell once again hosted his annual New Year&#x27;s predictions special of &quot;Coast to Coast&quot;, noting that a number of the predictions this year were of an unusual and interesting nature and not mere repeats of many that had come before, though he also took several callers to task for seemingly veiling their obvious political agendas or wishes in the form of predictions, rather than offering something from their &quot;psychic center,&quot; which is what he repeatedly asks for during the prediction show. He also suggested that perhaps &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot; should institute some sort of prize or acknowledgment for listeners whose predictions are particularly accurate or astute.

=== Immigration controversy ===
In late 2008, Bell and his wife filed an I-751 petition with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services as part of her marriage-based green card process. In early 2009 the USCIS responded that they would need additional evidence to prove that Bell&#x27;s marriage to a Philippine national and subsequent green card application was in good faith. Bell responded with evidence including their marriage license, their daughter&#x27;s birth certificate, Bell&#x27;s last will and testament, bank records, family photos, and Social Security forms. Bell sent the package to the USCIS by return receipt mail, and he subsequently received the return receipt stamped &quot;USCIS RECEIVED JAN-15-09.&quot;

On March 10, 2009, Bell and his wife and daughter left Nevada for Manila to deal with some family business, including the disposition of a condo they owned. Shortly thereafter, the USCIS denied the application on the grounds that the documentary evidence was never received, and further stipulated that Airyn Bell is not permitted to re-enter the United States, which is why Bell remained in the Philippines. Moreover, since the Bells were out of the country when the application was denied, they were required to start the process over.

== Events of 2010–2015 ==
Bell hosted ten episodes in 2010, five short of his publicly announced, contractually specified quota of 15 shows per year. The last episode he hosted that year was his annual &quot;Ghost to Ghost&quot; show on Halloween night.

As of December 2010, Bell was no longer listed as a host on the &quot;Coast to Coast&quot; website, his shows were no longer searchable under his name, and the only references to Bell on the site were of a historical or archival nature. However, the weekly &quot;Somewhere in Time with Art Bell&quot; broadcasts of classic Bell-hosted episodes (which have aired before the live show on Saturday nights since 2006) were not discontinued.

In email interactions with fans who wrote in to inquire about Bell&#x27;s absence, Coast personnel confirmed that Bell had retired. &quot;Art Bell decided he no longer wished to do live C2C shows, and asked that his name be removed from the host listings accordingly,&quot; said Coast webmaster Lex Lonehood. &quot;Classics and Somewhere in Time shows will continue as is.&quot;

Despite the remarks from Punnett, Noory, Lyon, Lonehood, and Bell, as of January 6, 2011, an official public statement formally confirming Bell&#x27;s departure from &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot; had not been made via press release, website announcement or on-air, by the show&#x27;s producers, Premier Radio Networks, Clear Channel Communications, or Bell himself. On July 20, 2011, Bell announced via his Facebook page that he had relocated with his family to Pahrump, Nevada. On November 1, 2012, Bell updated his Facebook status with the following: &quot;I wish my name was no longer associated with what &quot;Coast&quot; has become!&quot;

=== Return to radio in 2013 ===
Bell returned to the airwaves on September 16, 2013. His new show &quot;Art Bell&#x27;s Dark Matter&quot; was broadcast on SiriusXM satellite radio&#x27;s Indie Talk channel (channel #104), Monday through Thursday from 7 PM to 11 PM PT with repeats during the remainder of the night and &quot;best of&quot; shows airing on Fridays. On November 4, 2013, Bell left Dark Matter after only six weeks.

=== &quot;Midnight in the Desert&quot; radio show ===
On July 20, 2015, Bell returned with his new show &quot;Midnight in the Desert&quot;. The show aired on the internet Dark Matter Digital network and on 45 stations (20 of which signed on before the show started) from 9p.m. to midnight PT. He also started transmitting on shortwave radio over WTWW on 5.085MHz as well.

On December 11, 2015, Bell permanently stepped down as host of &quot;Midnight in the Desert&quot; due to concerns about his family&#x27;s safety. He had reported multiple instances of someone shooting firearms at and near his property in the fall of 2015. The show &quot;Midnight in the Desert&quot; continued with new host Heather Wade, with Bell making the occasional guest host appearance. Shortly after Bell&#x27;s death, Dave Schrader became the host.

== Death ==
Bell posted on his website in July 2016 that he was hospitalized for pneumonia and revealed that he suffered from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Art Bell died April 13, 2018, at age 72 at his home in Pahrump, Nevada. On August 1, 2018, the &quot;Las Vegas Review-Journal&quot; reported the Clark County coroner&#x27;s office findings. The coroner&#x27;s office stated that Bell died of an accidental overdose from a cocktail of prescription drugs. The coroner&#x27;s office determined he had four prescription medications in his system: the opioids oxycodone or Roxicet and hydrocodone or Vicodin, diazepam or Valium, and carisoprodol or Soma, a muscle-relaxant. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and hypertension also contributed to his death.

George Noory, current host of &quot;Coast To Coast AM&quot;, announced Bell&#x27;s death and while struggling to keep his composure stated, &quot;Art and I were not that close. We had our differences, but he was one of those instrumental in me being where I am right now.&quot;

== Amateur radio ==
Bell became a licensed amateur radio operator at the age of 13. His first call sign was KN3JOX, first listed in the Winter 1959 edition of the Radio Amateur Callbook. He soon upgraded to K3JOX, and he later held W2CKS, first listed in the Spring 1967 Callbook. Bell held an Amateur Extra Class license, which is the highest U.S. Federal Communications Commission amateur license class. His call sign was W6OBB.

Bell passed the Philippines amateur radio exams and became a Philippine Class A amateur radio operator with the call sign of 4F1AB. While in the Philippines, Bell was active on 40-10 Meters, as well as 144.6 MHz simplex in Manila.

== Honors ==
In August 2006 Art was inducted into the Nevada Broadcasters Association Hall of Fame. He did not attend the presentation.

On March 10, 2007, Bell was honored with the &quot;News/Talk Radio Lifetime Achievement Award&quot; from the trade publication &quot;Radio &amp; Records&quot; in Los Angeles.

Bell was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame in 2008.

Bell wrote, or co-wrote, several books, including &quot;The Quickening: Today&#x27;s Trends, Tomorrow&#x27;s World&quot;; &quot;The Art of Talk&quot; (an autobiography); &quot;The Source: Journey Through the Unexplained&quot;; &quot;The Edge: Man&#x27;s Mysterious Past &amp; Incredible Future&quot;; and &quot;The Coming Global Superstorm&quot; (co-authored with Whitley Strieber), which became the basis for the popular movie &quot;The Day After Tomorrow&quot;.

== Other work ==
In 1996, Bell appeared in an episode of the NBC science fiction series &quot;Dark Skies&quot; as William S. Paley, head of CBS.

On September 30, 1998, NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today Show&quot; aired a taped segment of reporter Fred Francis interviewing Bell. Francis questioned Bell about Hale-Bopp, Area 51, eccentric callers claiming to be &quot;six-fingered alien hybrids&quot;, and the UFO sighting experienced by Bell and his wife Ramona.

In 1999, Bell appeared as himself on the series &quot;Millennium&quot;. The episode called &quot;Collateral Damage&quot; aired in the third season and dealt with a former U.S. soldier who claimed the government he fought for was indeed responsible for horrendous tests on soldiers and Iraqi civilians. (This episode was broadcast on January 22, 1999. The Washington Post, January 22, 1999.) In 1999 Bell was interviewed on &quot;Larry King Live&quot;. (This was broadcast on March 5, 1999. The Washington Post, March 5, 1999.)

Progressive rock band Tool&#x27;s 2001 album, &quot;Lateralus&quot;, featured a track entitled &quot;Faaip de Oiad&quot; (Enochian for &quot;The Voice of God&quot;), which includes a clip of the &quot;distraught and terrified&quot; Area 51 employee call from September 11, 1997.

In 2005, Bell and then-wife Ramona were featured on the ABC News special &quot;Peter Jennings Reporting: UFOs – Seeing Is Believing,&quot; which reported on the entire scope of the UFO experience, from the first sighting by Kenneth Arnold in 1947 to the present day. (This was broadcast on February 24, 2005. The Washington Post, 2–20–05.)

In 2005, snippets of Bell and callers to his show were featured on the song &quot;Conspiracy Radio&quot; on Sean Hogan&#x27;s album &quot;Catalina Sunrise&quot;: Bell is credited for &quot;voice-overs&quot; on this track.

In 2006, Bell was featured in the video game &quot;Prey&quot; and played himself. He hosts, as in real life, &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot;, and the player is able to listen to the broadcast at several terminals throughout the game. The broadcasts describe what is happening on Earth as the game unfolds. The game plot centers on a massive spaceship and alien abductions. Bell receives a number of calls about people who have seen smaller craft as they abduct people.

In 2007, Bell appeared as himself in the movie &quot;I Know Who Killed Me&quot;.

Bell appeared alongside Mark Arnold in the 2016 film titled &quot;Abduct&quot;, directed by Ilyas Kaduji and produced by Mafalda Sa. Bell plays himself as he and a group of friends try to help protect a young woman from an alien threat.

<text>In Euclidean geometry, Carnot&#x27;s theorem states that the sum of the signed distances from the circumcenter &quot;D&quot; to the sides of an arbitrary triangle &quot;ABC&quot; is

:formula_1

where &quot;r&quot; is the inradius and &quot;R&quot; is the circumradius of the triangle. Here the sign of the distances is taken to be negative if and only if the open line segment &quot;DX&quot; (&quot;X&quot; = &quot;F&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, &quot;H&quot;) lies completely outside the triangle. In the diagram, &quot;DF&quot; is negative and both &quot;DG&quot; and &quot;DH&quot; are positive.

The theorem is named after Lazare Carnot (1753–1823). It is used in a proof of the Japanese theorem for concyclic polygons.

<doc id="309945" wikidata="Q621601" url="?curid=309945" title="Application service provider">
<text>An application service provider (ASP) is a business providing application software generally through the Web. ASPs that specialize in a particular application (such as a medical billing program) may be referred to as providing software as a service.

==The ASP model==
The application software resides on the vendor&#x27;s system and is accessed by users through a communication protocol. Alternatively, the vendor may provide special purpose client software. Client software may interface with these systems through an application programming interface.

ASP characteristics include:
* ASP hosts the application
* ASP owns, operates and maintains the servers that support the application
* ASP delivers the application to customers via the Internet or a thin client
* ASP may bill on a per-use basis (on-demand outsourcing), a monthly/annual fee, or a per-labor hour basis

The advantages to this approach include:
* Application costs are scaled over multiple customers
* ASP may provide more application experience than the customer&#x27;s staff
* ASP may provide application customization for the customer
* Application&#x27;s version is likely to be kept up to date
* Experts manage the application for performance
* Experts research the application for new features

The disadvantages include:
* The customer must rely on the ASP for a critical business function, including security and performance
* The customer may have to accept the application as provided 
* The customer may have to adapt to possible application changes
* Integration with other applications may be problematic

<text>Agalega day gecko (&quot;Phelsuma borbonica agalegae&quot; ) is a subspecies of geckos.

==General introduction==

This diurnal gecko only lives on the Agaléga Islands. It typically inhabits coconut trees or cheval trees. The Agalega day gecko feeds on insects and nectar.

==Description==
This lizard belongs to the medium-sized day geckos. Males are slightly larger than females and can reach a total length of about 16 cm whereas females measure only 13.5 cm. The basic body colour is grayish green. Both the head and the neck are yellow-brown. The tail and back can be bright turquoise. The flanks are grey or beige. The dorso-lateral bands are turquoise. On the back and tail there are brownish or red-brick coloured dots or bars.

==Distribution==
This species is endemic to the two Agalega islets.

==Habitat==
The two islands where &quot;P. borbonica agalega&quot; occurs, are small low coral sand islands. On these islands are mainly coconut tree plantations. The Agalega day gecko is often found on these trees as well as on &quot;Terminalia spec.&quot; and mango trees.

==Diet==
These day geckos feed on various insects and other invertebrates. They also like to lick soft, sweet fruit, pollen and nectar.

==Behaviour==
This &quot;Phelsuma&quot; species is rather shy.

==Reproduction==

The pairing season is between April and the first weeks of September. During this period, the females lay up to 4 pairs of eggs, often under loose bark of coconut trees. Females often share the same location for their eggs. The young will hatch after approximately 70–100 days, depending on the temperature. The juveniles measure 45–50 mm.

==Care and maintenance in captivity==
These animals should be housed in pairs and need a large, well planted terrarium. The temperature should be between 24 and 30 °C. During the night the temperature can drop to 18–22 °C. The relative humidity should be maintained between 40 and 60% during the day and 75% at night. These animals can be fed with crickets, wax moths, fruit flies, mealworms and houseflies.

<text>Citrix Systems, Inc. is an American multinational cloud computing and virtualization technology company that provides server, application and desktop virtualization, networking, software as a service (SaaS), and cloud computing technologies. Citrix claims that their products are used by over 400,000 clients worldwide, including 99% of the Fortune 100 and 98% of the Fortune 500.
In 1989, Citrix was founded in Richardson, Texas, by Ed Iacobucci, who served as chairman until his departure in 2000. The company began by developing remote access products for Microsoft operating systems and licensing source code from Microsoft. Citrix has been partnered with Microsoft throughout its history. By the 1990s, Citrix had become an industry leader in thin client technology, enabling purpose-built devices to access remote servers and resources. The company launched its first initial public offering in 1995 and, with few competitors, experienced significant revenue increases between 1995 and 1999.
Citrix acquired Sequoia Software Corp. in 2001 and ExpertCity, a provider of remote desktop products, in 2003. This was followed by more than a dozen other acquisitions from 2005 to 2012, which allowed Citrix to expand into additional markets including server and desktop virtualization, cloud computing, infrastructure as a service, and software as a service. In 2014, Citrix acquired Framehawk and used its technology to improve the delivery of virtual desktops and applications over wireless networks. In 2016, as part of a $1.8 billion deal with LogMeIn, Citrix spun off the GoTo product line into a new business entity called GetGo. In 2017, Citrix completed the merger of GetGo with LogMeIn&#x27;s products.

Citrix is headquartered in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, with subsidiary operations in California and Massachusetts and additional development centers in Canada, Denmark, Germany, India, and the United Kingdom. In 2021, Citrix generated $3.2 billion in revenue and had 9,700 employees.

After being acquired by Vista Equity Partners and Evergreen Coast Capital Corp on September 30, 2022, Citrix merged with TIBCO Software under the newly formed Cloud Software Group. Citrix spun off the re-branded Citrix ADC back into a standalone entity called NetScaler under the same parent.

==History ==

===Early history===

In 1989, Citrix was founded in Richardson, Texas, by former IBM developer Ed Iacobucci with $3 million in funding. Following the company&#x27;s initial setup and development, Iacobucci moved the company to his former home in Coral Springs, Florida. The company&#x27;s first employees were five other engineers from IBM who Iacobucci convinced to join his team. Iacobucci served as chairman of the company, and Roger Roberts became the CEO of Citrix in 1990. Citrix was originally named Citrus but changed its name after an existing company claimed trademark rights. The name Citrix is a portmanteau of Citrus and UNIX.

The company&#x27;s first product was Citrix Multiuser, an extension of OS/2 developed over two years. Citrix licensed the OS/2 source code from Microsoft and developed its own Independent Computing Architecture (ICA) protocol for Citrix Multiuser. Multiuser allowed multiple users working on separate computers to remotely access software on a server, even from computers that were not built to run OS/2. Three days before the product launched in 1991, Microsoft announced they would be switching from OS/2 to Windows. This change made Multiuser nearly unusable without significant changes to make it compatible with Windows or DOS. In 1991, the company discussed closing, but investments from Intel, Microsoft, and Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers among others allowed the company to work on a new version of Multiuser.

Multi-Win version 2.0 was released in 1992. It was compatible with DOS applications and allowed up to five users. In 1993, Citrix released a new remote applications server, WinView, which could run DOS and Windows applications. By 1994, the company&#x27;s yearly revenue equaled $10 million.

In 1995, the company then launched WinFrame, a multi-user operating system based on Microsoft&#x27;s Windows NT. This new product allowed up to 15 users and was the first thin client for Windows.

===Rise in popularity===
Citrix had its initial public offering in December 1995. On its first day of trading, the company&#x27;s share price doubled from $15 to $30. During the mid-1990s, Citrix became the leader of its growing industry with very few competitors, and the company&#x27;s revenues doubled year over year between 1995 and 1999.

After weeks of discussion, Iacobucci persuaded Microsoft to license Citrix technology for Windows NT Server 4.0, resulting in Windows Terminal Server Edition in 1998. This agreement allowed Citrix to keep its position in the marketplace and be NT 4.0 compatible. Citrix also earned $75 million and a royalty arrangement valued at approximately $100 million.

Citrix released MetaFrame 1.0 in conjunction with Terminal Server Edition. Due to weaknesses in Microsoft&#x27;s Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), Terminal Server Edition worked best with Citrix&#x27;s ICA protocol which MetaFrame used. This meant that Citrix technology was purchased and installed on most machines that ran Terminal Server Edition.

In 1997, the company opened a new headquarters in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. It also opened offices in Sydney, London, and Paris that same year.

In 1998, Mark Templeton became the CEO of Citrix after serving as vice president of marketing. That year, Citrix also licensed its ICA protocol to IBM and Key Tronics. In 1999, Citrix licensed its ICA protocol to Motorola for use in digital wireless handsets.

During 1999, Citrix&#x27;s thin-client model became a software trend, and the company&#x27;s customers increased to 15 million. Major clients included Sears, AT&amp;T, and Chevron. In 2000, the burst of the dot-com bubble led to Iacobucci leaving the company and CEO Mark Templeton being demoted to the president and senior executive officer. Templeton was later reinstated in 2001.

===Expansion===
In 2001, Citrix acquired Sequoia Software Corp. for $185 million. That same year, it released MetaFrame XP, a new platform using MetaFrame technology. MetaFrame XP was later rebranded to Presentation Server, in 2005.

On July 9, 2002, Citrix announced a 10% job cut. At the time, the company employed about 1,900 workers. After the announcement, the stock hit a five-year low.

In December 2003, Citrix acquired ExpertCity, a provider of remote desktop products, for $225 million in cash and stock. The acquisition was the company&#x27;s largest to date. Citrix gained ExpertCity&#x27;s existing products GoToMyPC and GoToAssist, and ExpertCity became the Citrix Online division. In 2004, the company introduced Citrix GoToMeeting.

Between 2005 and 2012, the company acquired over a dozen companies, allowing it to expand into new markets. Citrix acquired acceleration hardware maker NetScaler in 2005, which allowed the company to offer optimized application delivery. The company entered the server and desktop virtualization market with the purchase of XenSource in August 2007.
Citrix expanded its cloud and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) offerings in August 2010, with the acquisition of VMLogix. In February 2011, Citrix entered the European Software as a Service (SaaS) market with the acquisition of Netviewer.

In 2007, the company opened a headquarters in Silicon Valley. In 2008, the company rebranded its Presentation Server product line to XenApp. Also in 2008, Citrix announced an expanded alliance with Microsoft on desktop virtualization. On January 29, 2009, Citrix announced that 460 employee positions would be cut, comprising 10% of its workforce. In August 2010, Citrix announced a partnership with Google to bring the company&#x27;s products to ChromeOS devices. On July 14, 2015, Citrix added full support for Windows 10 to its desktop virtualization products.

In July 2011, the company became an IaaS leader after acquiring Cloud.com, a cloud infrastructure provider, for over $200 million. Citrix began offering VDI-in-a-box to small and medium businesses with the acquisition of Kaviza in May 2011. The company acquired cloud-based file sharing and storage technology through its purchase of ShareFile in October 2011.

In May 2012, Citrix acquired Virtual Computer, a maker of intelligent desktop virtualization. This virtualization technology is used in Citrix&#x27;s XenClient Enterprise edition. Citrix entered the mobile video and telecom markets in June 2012 when the company acquired ByteMobile. Also in 2012, the company acquired Zenprise. Zenprise&#x27;s Mobile application management (MAM) technology was released as XenMobile in February 2013.

In January 2014, Citrix acquired Framehawk to improve the delivery of virtual desktops and applications over wireless networks, including cellular, where speed and quality may be poor. In May 2014, Citrix acquired Scalextreme to bolster its cloud capabilities, such as auto scaling, patching, and automation of complex cloud deployments, for its core business units XenDesktop and Xenapp.

On January 29, 2015, Citrix announced that 700 full-time and 200 contractor positions would be eliminated. This was about 10% of its workforce. The cuts were expected to save between $90 and $100 million annually. Two hundred of the layoffs occurred in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, where the company is headquartered.

The company had 10,081 employees as of February 2015. In December 2015, Citrix employed approximately 9,500 people but noted that its November restructure was due to eliminating nearly 700 full-time jobs. As of December 31, 2021, Citrix had approximately 9,700 employees.

===Recent history===
Citrix reported a net income of $251.7 million in 2014, down from $339.5 million in 2013. In July 2015, the company announced several changes to its board of directors, including making Robert Calderoni executive chairman and adding Jesse Cohn, a senior partner of activist hedge fund Elliott Management. That same month, the company announced that president and CEO Mark Templeton would retire after a replacement was found. On October 21, the company named its executive chairman, Robert Calderoni, as interim president and CEO.

In January 2016, Kirill Tatarinov, a former Microsoft executive, was named the president and CEO of Citrix and joined the company&#x27;s board; Calderoni remained executive chairman of the board.

In July 2016, as part of a deal with Boston-based SaaS company LogMeIn, Citrix announced that it had spun off its GoTo product line, which included GoToMeeting, GoToWebinar, GoToWebcast, GoToTraining, GoToAssist and GoToMyPC, into a wholly owned subsidiary called GetGo. In February 2017, Citrix completed a merger through which GetGo became a subsidiary of LogMeIn. The transaction was valued at approximately $1.8 billion. In July 2017, David Henshall became the company&#x27;s CEO.

Also in 2017, Citrix expanded its partnership with Google. In May, Google announced that it would add support on its Chrome web browser, including graphics processing unit acceleration, to run Citrix XenApp. In July, the companies announced that they were working to allow Citrix Cloud to deploy virtualized apps and desktops on Google Cloud.

In October 2017, Citrix told regulators of plans to lay off staff &quot;across most functions&quot; and consolidate offices in the fall of 2017 into 2018. The company carried out layoffs in Raleigh, North Carolina, and office closures in Santa Barbara, California, and Tempe, Arizona.

Citrix unveiled its Citrix Analytics security software at the 2017 Citrix Synergy conference in Orlando, Florida, in May 2017. The software detects and responds to security threats using artificial intelligence.

Citrix then unveiled Citrix Analytics for Performance at the 2019 Citrix Summit conference in Orlando, Florida, in May 2019. The software quantifies user experience for Virtual applications and desktop users and also leverages machine learning to troubleshoot performance issues.

In 2018, Citrix changed the names of some of its products to represent its shift to a cloud operating model. The company stated that it made the name changes to present a unified product line so that end users can create, manage, and deploy workspaces with apps and data from a single console. The company dropped its Xen and NetScaler brand names: XenApp and XenDesktop became Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops; XenMobile became Citrix Endpoint Management; ShareFile integration became Citrix Content Collaboration; XenServer became Citrix Hypervisor; Cedexis became Citrix Intelligent Traffic Management; and NetScaler products kept their identities, but the &quot;NetScaler&quot; brand name was replaced with &quot;Citrix ADC&quot; for Application Delivery Controller.

Henshall stepped down in October 2021, and Calderoni was again named interim CEO.

On January 31, 2022, it was announced that Citrix had been acquired in a $16.5 billion deal by affiliates of Vista Equity Partners and Evergreen Coast Capital. Citrix would merge with TIBCO, a Vista portfolio company to form Cloud Software Group (CSG). In July 2022, Citrix announced that Tom Krause would succeed Robert Calderoni as CEO following the merger. It was also reported that Citrix would go private as part of the deal. As part of the merger, in September 2022, Citrix announced a $4.55 billion-equivalent cross-border term loan to back its $16.5 billion buyout by Vista Equity and Evergreen Coast Capital. Following the merger, the Citrix Hypervisor product-line was spun-off into a standalone business unit under CSG and rebranded as XenServer.

In July 2022, Krause became chief executive officer of the Cloud Software Group After Krause joined Cloud Software group it laid off 15 percent of its employees. A year later it laid off an additional 12 percent.

In January 2025, Krause became involved with the U.S. Treasury Department as part of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). He was assigned as a special government employee to review the federal payment system and was granted limited access as a liaison between the Treasury and DOGE. On February 7, 2025, he was appointed as the Fiscal Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, succeeding Matthew Garber who had been acting in the role since David Lebryk&#x27;s resignation. Krause continued to work at Cloud Software Group despite his employment by DOGE, this has been cited as a potential conflict of interest.

==Products==
Citrix creates software that allows employees to work and collaborate remotely regardless of device or network. The company&#x27;s main products are in desktop software, Desktop as a Service (DaaS) systems, networking, cloud, and Software as a service (SaaS).

===Desktops and apps===
Citrix offers several products related to desktop and application virtualization. These tools allow access to computers and applications independently of what device they are physically using, from any device. Citrix XenApp, now integrated as part of XenDesktop, provides application virtualization. Citrix XenDesktop, Citrix VDI-in-a-Box, and XenClient all provide desktop virtualization. The DesktopPlayer for Mac allows online and offline access to Windows virtual desktops from Macs. Citrix Workspace Cloud is a platform for building and delivering desktops and applications from the cloud. ShareFile allows companies and organizations to sync and share files. XenMobile offers mobile app and device management. Citrix Receiver is a client software that allows universal access to virtual applications and desktops. AppDNA offers software that provides application migration and management.
Citrix users interact with the HDX protocol on top of the RDS. This protocol acts as a buffer between the users and the server and compresses data in the meantime.

===Desktop as a service (DaaS)===
Citrix technology enables service providers to provide Desktop as a Service (DaaS) offerings, including business apps and desktops, to their customers. These products include Worx Mobile Apps for secure email, browser, and document sharing, and Citrix Workspace Suite for mobile workspaces.

===Networking and cloud===
Citrix products related to cloud computing and networking include Citrix XenServer for server virtualization and its NetScaler brand of network appliances, including WAN optimization devices, Software-Defined WAN delivery equipment, Application Delivery Controllers (ADC), Gateways, and AppFirewall web application firewalls. All of these are managed by Citrix&#x27;s cloud management software, Citrix Cloud. The company also has ByteMobile Adaptive Traffic Management, which aims to optimize mobile video services through traffic management, policy control, and caching. ByteMobile Insight provides mobile data and subscriber analytics.

===Software as a service (SaaS)===
Citrix software as a service (SaaS) products are focused on collaboration and communications. The offerings include Podio, a cloud-based collaboration service, and OpenVoice, which provides audio conferencing.

==Corporate responsibility==
The company&#x27;s philanthropic activities include corporate giving—such as corporate donations of in-kind gifts—and employee match programs. In addition, Citrix employees are allowed to take two paid volunteer days each year and participate in the company&#x27;s annual &quot;Global Day of Impact&quot;, an event that encourages Citrix employees to volunteer in their local communities.

Citrix has provided business training to non-profit teams near its Fort Lauderdale headquarters. In particular, the company helped a local non-profit organization launch a computer on wheels to offer training to low-income neighborhoods. In 2007, the company connected a Broward County, Florida, area with Agogo, Ghana, through donated technology and training. Furthermore, the company&#x27;s Raleigh office began a program called &quot;Project Code&quot; in 2014, which leads Boys &amp; Girls Clubs through coding exercises and teaches them about computer science.

In addition to its philanthropic activities, Citrix has donated some of its open-source technology to non-profit software organizations in order to continue its development and gain more contributors. For example, Citrix gave Cloudstack to the Apache Foundation in 2012 and Xen hypervisor to the Linux Foundation in 2013.

<doc id="309949" wikidata="Q1180344" url="?curid=309949" title="De Telegraaf">
<text>De Telegraaf (; ) is the largest Dutch daily morning newspaper. Paul Jansen has been the editor-in-chief since August 2015. &quot;De Telegraaf&quot; is based in Amsterdam and is owned by the Belgian company Mediahuis.

==History==
===19th century===
&quot;De Telegraaf&quot; was founded by Henry Tindal, who simultaneously started another paper &quot;De Courant&quot; (). The first issue appeared on 1 January 1893.

===20th century===
Following Tindal&#x27;s death on 31 January 1902 the printer HMC Holdert, with backing from financiers, took over &quot;De Telegraaf&quot; and &quot;De Courant&quot; on 12 September 1902. This proved to be a good investment, particularly with regard to &quot;De Courant&quot;, enabling Holdert between 1903 and 1923 to take over one newspaper after another, suspending publication as he went. He added the name &quot;Amsterdamsche Courant&quot; (&quot;Amsterdam Gazette&quot;) as a subtitle to &quot;De Telegraaf&quot;, and &quot;Het Nieuws van den Dag&quot; (&quot;The News of the Day&quot;) to &quot;De Courant&quot;.

During World War I, when the Netherlands was officially neutral, Holdert&#x27;s French sympathies and his pro-British standpoint caused &quot;De Telegraaf&quot; to be the focus of some controversy, as the Netherlands were usually pro-German at the time.

In 1926, Holdert began construction of a new printing facility at the &quot;Nieuwezijds Voorburgwal&quot; in Amsterdam, designed by J. F. Staal and G. J. Langhout. Construction was completed and the building occupied in 1930.

During World War II, the Telegraaf companies published pro-Nazi German papers, which led to a thirty-year ban on publishing after the war. The prohibition was lifted in 1949 and &quot;De Telegraaf&quot; flourished anew to become the biggest newspaper in the Netherlands.

At one point, in June 1966, the Telegraaf building was besieged by angry construction workers and Provo followers, after a false report that a victim of a labour dispute had been killed not by the police but by a co-worker. In 1974, &quot;De Telegraaf&quot; moved to a new location on the &quot;Basisweg&quot;.

In 1995–1996 &quot;De Telegraaf&quot; had a circulation of 760,000 copies, making it the best-selling paper in the country.

&quot;De Courant/Nieuws van de Dag&quot; ceased publication in 1998. In 1999, the circulation of the paper was 808,000 copies, making it the ninth best-selling European newspaper.

===21st century===
&quot;De Telegraaf&quot; was the eighth top European newspaper with a circulation of 807,000 copies in 2001. It added a Sunday edition on 21 March 2004. The Sunday edition was dropped on 27 December 2009. Circulation was 488,902 copies in 2013. &quot;De Telegraaf&quot; changed from broadsheet to compact format in October 2014. In 2014, was , dropping to in 2015. Distribution had been reduced to 393,537 in 2017.

On 26 June 2018, a delivery van intentionally rammed into the office building of &quot;De Telegraaf&quot;, catching fire afterwards which was probably started by the driver who made his getaway with another car. The building took considerable damage. Police believe the attack was done within organized crime circles; four days earlier the building of &quot;Panorama&quot; was also a target, possibly because both publications write about serious crime.

==Editorial content==
The newspaper contains many sensational and sports-related articles, and one or more pages supplied by the gossip-magazine &quot;Privé&quot; (&quot;Private&quot;). The financial news coverage is more serious in tone. The paper targets a broad audience, mostly in a conservative and populist style.

<doc id="309951" wikidata="Q696000" url="?curid=309951" title="Johann Bernhard Bach">
<text>Johann Bernhard Bach (23 May 1676 – 11 June 1749) was a German composer, and second cousin of J. S. Bach.

==Life==
Johann Bernhard Bach was born in Erfurt in 1676, in the house named &quot;Zu den drei Rosen&quot; (The Three Roses) on Junkersand Street, and was baptized on 25 November 1676 in Erfurt&#x27;s &quot;Kaufmannskirche&quot; (Merchant&#x27;s Church). He (like his younger brother Johann Christoph, born in 1685) received his early musical tuition from his father, Johann Aegidius Bach. After attending the &quot;Schola Mercatorum&quot; at Erfurt, he entered Erfurt&#x27;s major secondary school at that time, the &quot;Ratsgymnasium&quot;. As early as 1695, at the age of 18, he became the organist at the Kaufmannskirche. In 1699, he moved to Magdeburg where he was appointed organist for St Catharine&#x27;s Church. In 1703, John William III, Duke of Saxe-Eisenach called him to Eisenach to serve as harpsichordist at the ducal court. In Eisenach, he also became the organist at St George&#x27;s Church, succeeding his uncle Johann Christoph Bach.

From 1708 to 1712, Johann Bernhard Bach worked together with Georg Philipp Telemann who held, first, the position of the leader of the violin section, and, from August 1709, that of a conductor (&quot;Kapellmeister&quot;) at Eisenach&#x27;s ducal orchestra.

On 6 August 1716, Johann Bernhard Bach married Johanna Sophia Siefer. Three children were born into the family.

In 1741, the ducal orchestra was dissolved, which meant that Johann Bernhard continued to work exclusively as choirmaster and organist, until his death, apparently still receiving the ducal allowance of 100 Thalers per year.

Johann Bernhard kept a life-long friendship with his famous cousin Johann Sebastian Bach. In 1715, he acted as godfather for Johann Sebastian&#x27;s son Johann Gottfried Bernhard, whilst Johann Sebastian became godfather to Johann Bernhard&#x27;s eldest son Johann Ernst in 1722. This latter was to succeed his father Johann Bernhard as organist at St George&#x27;s Church in Eisenach.

Bach died in 1749 at the age of 73

==Work==
Most of his musical output has been lost, but amongst his surviving music there are four orchestral suites. It is known that J.S. Bach had individual parts prepared for performance by his orchestra.

His musical style has been described as being similar to that of Telemann.

The surviving orchestral suites (overtures) are as follows:
*Suite No. 1 in G minor
*Suite No. 2 in G major
*Suite No. 3 in E minor
*Suite No. 4 in D major

They are thought to have been written before 1730.

Surviving keyboard music:
*Fantasia in C minor (originally thought to have been composed by J.S. Bach as BWV 919)
*Chaconne in A major
*Chaconne in B-flat major
*Chaconne in G major
*Chorales for organ
**&quot;Du Friedefürst, Herr Jesu Christ&quot;
**&quot;Nun freut euch lieben Christen g&#x27;mein&quot;
**&quot;Vom Himmel hoch da komm ich her&quot;

Two fugues composed by Johann Bernhard Bach also survive.

<text>Nancy Goldin (born 1953) is an American photographer and activist. Her work explores in snapshot-style the emotions of the individual, in intimate relationships, and the bohemian LGBT subcultural communities, especially dealing with the devastating HIV/AIDS crisis of the 1980s. Her most notable work is &quot;The Ballad of Sexual Dependency&quot;. In the slideshow and monograph (1986) Goldin portrayed her chosen &quot;family&quot;, meanwhile documenting the post-punk and gay subcultures. She is a founding member of the advocacy group P.A.I.N. (Prescription Addiction Intervention Now) against the opioid epidemic. She lives and works in New York City.

==Early life==

Goldin was born in Washington, D.C., in 1953 to middle-class Jewish parents, and grew up in the Boston suburb of Swampscott, moving to Lexington in her teens. Goldin&#x27;s father worked in broadcasting and served as the chief economist for the Federal Communications Commission. Goldin had early exposure to tense family relationships, as her parents often argued about Goldin&#x27;s older sister Barbara who ultimately committed suicide when Goldin was 11: &quot;This was in 1965, when teenage suicide was a taboo subject. I was very close to my sister and aware of some of the forces that led her to choose suicide. I saw the role that her sexuality and its repression played in her destruction. Because of the times, the early sixties, women who were angry and sexual were frightening, outside the range of acceptable behavior, beyond control. By the time she was eighteen, she saw that her only way to get out was to lie down on the tracks of the commuter train outside of Washington, D.C. It was an act of immense will.&quot;

Goldin began to smoke marijuana and date an older man. She left home by age 13 and subsequently lived in various foster homes. At 16 she enrolled at the Satya Community School in Lincoln, MA, that followed the educational concept of Summerhill. After Polaroid donated some cameras to the school, a staff member (existential psychologist Rollo May&#x27;s daughter) introduced Goldin to photography in 1969 when she was sixteen years old. She got to be the school photographer and became &quot;obsessed with recording my life&quot;. Still struggling from her sister&#x27;s death, Goldin used the camera to cherish her relationships with those she photographed. At first she tried to emulate early as well as contemporary fashion photography by the likes of Guy Bourdin and Helmut Newton in French and Italian &quot;Vogue&quot; magazine issues she stole and then she and her peers would be occupied with for hours. Henry Horenstein, whose evening class at New England School of Photography Goldin attended, appreciated her pictures and showed her Larry Clark&#x27;s book &quot;Tulsa&quot; that had just come out in 1971 and documented Clark&#x27;s life within a group of &quot;speedfreaks&quot;. It opened her eyes and shifted her focus from fashion to art photography. Through Horenstein Goldin also got to know the work of August Sander and Lisette Model (Goldin attended a class by her in 1974). She finally enrolled at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston with her friend from Satya, David Armstrong. There she met Philip-Lorca diCorcia and Mark Morrisroe, and began to photograph in color.
== Life and work ==
Goldin&#x27;s first solo show, held in Boston in 1973, was based on her photographic journeys among the city&#x27;s gay and transgender communities, to which she had been introduced by her friend David Armstrong. While living in downtown Boston at age 18, Goldin &quot;fell in with the drag queens,&quot; living with them and photographing them. Among her work from this period is &quot;Ivy wearing a fall, Boston&quot; (1973). Unlike some photographers who were interested in psychoanalyzing or exposing the queens, Goldin admired and respected their sexuality. Goldin said, &quot;My desire was to show them as a third gender, as another sexual option, a gender option. And to show them with a lot of respect and love, to kind of glorify them because I really admire people who can re-create themselves and manifest their fantasies publicly. I think it&#x27;s brave&quot;.

Goldin admitted to being romantically in love with a queen during this period of her life in a Q&amp;A with &quot;Bomb&quot; &quot;I remember going through a psychology book trying to find something about it when I was nineteen. There was one little chapter about it in an abnormal psych book that made it sound so ... I don&#x27;t know what they ascribed it to, but it was so bizarre. And that&#x27;s where I was at that time in my life&quot;.

Goldin describes her life as having been completely immersed in that of the queens. &quot;I lived with them; it was my whole focus. Everything I did – that&#x27;s who I was all the time. And that&#x27;s who I wanted to be&quot;. However, upon attending the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, when her professors told her to go back and photograph queens again, Goldin admitted her work was not the same as when she had lived with them. Goldin graduated from the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in 1977/1978, where she had worked mostly with Cibachrome prints, but also had begun showing slides. Her work from this period is associated with the Boston School of Photography.

Following graduation, Goldin moved to New York City. She began documenting the post-punk new-wave music scene, along with the city&#x27;s vibrant, post-Stonewall gay subculture of the late 1970s and early 1980s. Her first slideshow in New York was at the birthday party of Frank Zappa at the Mudd Club, with her boyfriend acting as deejay, while on another occasion a live band (the Del Byzanteens featuring Jim Jarmusch) accompanied the screening. A first exposure to a wider audience was her participation in the 1981 exhibition &quot;New York/New Wave&quot; at PS1.

===&quot;The Ballad of Sexual Dependency&quot;===
In the young, sex-affirmative, hard-drug subculture of the Bowery neighborhood she found her &quot;tribe,&quot; which became the subject of her photographs taken between 1979 and 1986. These pictures constitute her slideshow &quot;The Ballad of Sexual Dependency,&quot; which she initially showed to her peers in clubs and other venues they frequented. Their immediate reaction to the pictures shaped its constantly evolving form. Later versions of the cycle had around 700 images screened in about 45 minutes (ca. 3 seconds per slide). After the slideshow was screened at the Whitney Biennial in 1985, it was published as a book a year later by Aperture with help from Marvin Heiferman, Mark Holborn, and her friend Suzanne Fletcher. 
Taken from a song in Bertolt Brecht&#x27;s &quot;Threepenny Opera,&quot; which served as opener for the slideshow, the title printed on flyers and posters for the events was originally an undefined plural, &quot;Ballads of Sexual Dependency,&quot; referring to the slideshow&#x27;s deejayed soundtrack with songs by The Velvet Underground, Screamin&#x27; Jay Hawkins, Yoko Ono (&quot;She Fights Back&quot;), Petula Clark (&quot;Downtown&quot;), Dionne Warwick (&quot;Don&#x27;t Make Me Over&quot;), Dean Martin (&quot;Memories&quot;), Nina Simone, chansons by Boris Vian (&quot;Fais-moi mal, Johnny&quot;), Charles Aznavour and Edith Piaf, arias sung by Maria Callas a. o. The book&#x27;s 125 pictures were sequenced in a similar way with song titles. 

The snapshot aesthetic images were dominantly taken indoors and by night: &quot;That series is stark. It&#x27;s all flash-lit. I honestly didn&#x27;t know about natural light then and how it affected the colour of the skin because I never went out in daylight.&quot; They depict autobiographical moments, mostly of friends, women and men for themselves and couples, often nude, some causual, some explicit, but also a small spread with kids and groups of people partying; they show love, joy and confidence, but also vulnerability, tears and the result of violence, especially an incident at the end of her intense relationship with Brian, who is subject of many images as well as on the book cover. Her self-portrait, &quot;Nan One Month After Being Battered, 1984&quot;, was called the center-piece of the &quot;Ballad.&quot; In her foreword to the book she describes it as a &quot;diary [she] lets people read&quot; of people she referred to as her &quot;tribe&quot;. Part of &quot;Ballad&quot; was driven by the need to remember her chosen family. Photography was a way for her to hold onto her friends, she hoped.

===After the &quot;Ballad&quot;===
The photographs show a transition through Goldin&#x27;s travels and her life. Most of her &quot;Ballad&quot; subjects were dead by the 1990s, lost either to drug overdose or AIDS; this tally included close friends and often-photographed subjects Greer Lankton and Cookie Mueller. In 2003, &quot;The New York Times&quot; nodded to the work&#x27;s impact, explaining Goldin had &quot;forged a genre, with photography as influential as any in the last twenty years.&quot; In addition to the &quot;Ballad,&quot; she combined her Bowery pictures in two other series: &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Your Mirror&quot; and &quot;All by Myself.&quot;

Beside the &quot;Ballad,&quot; Goldin&#x27;s work series are most often presented in the form of a slideshow, and have been shown at galleries, museums, photo and film festivals. The main themes of her early pictures are love, gender, domesticity, and sexuality. She has affectionately documented women looking in mirrors, girls in bathrooms and barrooms, drag queens, sexual acts, and the culture of obsession and dependency. In the book &quot;Auto-Focus,&quot; her photographs are described as a way to &quot;learn the stories and intimate details of those closest to her&quot;. The book speaks of her uncompromising manner and style when photographing acts such as drug use, sex, violence, arguments, and traveling and references one of Goldin&#x27;s photographs &quot;Nan One Month After Being Battered, 1984&quot; as an iconic image which she uses to reclaim her identity and her life.

Goldin&#x27;s work since 1995 has included a wide array of subject matter: a collaborative book project with Japanese photographer Nobuyoshi Araki; New York City skylines and uncanny landscapes; people (notably in water) and her lover, Siobhan; and babies, parenthood and family life.

In 2000, her hand was injured and she currently retains less ability to handle a camera.
In 2006, her exhibition, &quot;Chasing a Ghost,&quot; opened in New York. It was the first installation by her to include moving pictures, a fully narrative score, and voiceover, and included the three-screen slide and video presentation &quot;Sisters, Saints, &amp; Sybils,&quot; which premiered in Paris the year before. The work involved her sister Barbara&#x27;s suicide and how she coped through production of numerous images and narratives. Her works are developing more and more into cinemaesque features, exemplifying her gravitation towards working with films.

After some time, her photos moved from portrayals of dangerous youthful abandonment to scenes of parenthood and family life in progressively worldwide settings. Goldin currently resides and works in New York, Paris, as well as London.

==Fashion==
Goldin has undertaken commercial fashion photography—for Australian label Scanlan &amp; Theodore&#x27;s Spring/Summer 2010 campaign, shot with model Erin Wasson; for Italian luxury label Bottega Veneta&#x27;s Spring/Summer 2010 campaign with models Sean O&#x27;Pry and Anya Kazakova, evoking memories of her &quot;Ballad of Sexual Dependency&quot;; for shoemaker Jimmy Choo in 2011 with model Linda Vojtova; and for Dior in 2013, &quot;1000 LIVES&quot;, featuring Robert Pattinson.

In March 2018, clothing brand Supreme released a collaborative range with Goldin as part of their Spring/Summer 2018 collection. This consisted of jackets, sweatshirts and t-shirts in various colors, with designs titled &quot;Misty and Jimmy Paulette&quot;, &quot;Kim in Rhinestone&quot; and &quot;Nan as a dominatrix&quot;.

== Critique ==
Some critics have accused Goldin of making heroin use appear glamorous and of pioneering a grunge style that later became popularized by youth fashion magazines such as &quot;The Face&quot; and &quot;I-D&quot;. However, in a 2002 interview with &quot;The Observer&quot;, Goldin herself called the use of &quot;heroin chic&quot; to sell clothes and perfumes &quot;reprehensible and evil.&quot; Goldin admits to having a romanticized image of drug culture at a young age, but she soon saw the error in this ideal: &quot;I had a totally romantic notion of being a junkie. I wanted to be one.&quot; Goldin&#x27;s substance usage stopped after she became intrigued with the idea of memory in her work, &quot;When people talk about the immediacy in my work, that&#x27;s what its about: this need to remember and record every single thing.&quot;

Goldin&#x27;s interest in drugs stemmed from a sort of rebellion against parental guidance that parallels her decision to run away from home at a young age, &quot;I wanted to get high from a really early age. I wanted to be a junkie. That&#x27;s what intrigues me. Part was the Velvet Underground and the Beats and all that stuff. But, really, I wanted to be as different from my mother as I could and define myself as far as possible from the suburban life I was brought up in.&quot;

Goldin denies the role of voyeur; she is instead a queer insider sharing the same experiences as her subjects: &quot;I&#x27;m not crashing; this is my party. This is my family, my history.&quot; She insists her subjects have veto power over what she exhibits. In &quot;Fantastic Tales&quot; Liz Kotz criticizes Goldin&#x27;s claim that she is just as much a part of what she is photographing rather than exploiting her subjects. Goldin&#x27;s insistence on intimacy between artist and subject is an attempt to relegitimize the codes and conventions of social documentary, presumably by ridding them of their problematic enmeshment with the histories of social surveillance and coercion, says Kotz. [Her] insider status does nothing to alter the way her pictures convert her audience into voyeurs.

Goldin&#x27;s &quot;The Ballad of Sexual Dependency&quot; critiques gender norms (&quot;clichés&quot; as she calls them) by highlighting the collective human desire to form connections regardless of the emotional or physical cost. Throughout &quot;Ballad&quot;, Goldin showcases some difficult moments for both herself and her friends, especially in relation to their codependency in search of genuine connection. Her friends are a diverse cast consisting of many non-conforming gender identities and sexualities; Goldin&#x27;s photography exposes many narratives that most would turn a blind eye to, such as the intense intimacy and pain of same-sex relationships. The AIDS epidemic cost most of Goldin&#x27;s friends their lives, now preserved in time through the photos that she captured of them. Throughout this period of loss, the desire for connection was further perpetuated and Goldin and her remaining friend group found it essential to remain in close contact with one another. This constant desire for intimacy and connection highlights the similarities amongst people, despite their more obvious differences, emphasizing the societally upheld &quot;differences&quot; between men and women.

== Influences ==
Her friends and colleagues Peter Hujar, Larry Clark, and David Wojnarowicz, as well as historical figures like August Sander and Claude Cahun were all major influences to Goldin&#x27;s work.

=== Diane Arbus ===
Both Goldin and Diane Arbus celebrate those who live marginal lives. Stills from &quot;Variety&quot; are compared to Arbus&#x27; magazine work; the &quot;Variety&quot; series portray &quot;the rich collision of music, club life, and art production of the Lower East Side pre and post AIDS period&quot;. Both artists ask to reexamine artists&#x27; intentionality.

=== Michelangelo Antonioni ===
One of the reasons Goldin began photographing was Michelangelo Antonioni&#x27;s &quot;Blow Up&quot; (1966). The sexuality and glamour of the film exerted a &quot;huge effect&quot; on her. Referring to images shown in &quot;Ballad,&quot; &quot;the beaten down and beaten up personages, with their gritty, disheveled miens, which populate these early pictures, often photographed in the dark and dank, ramshackle interiors, relate physically and emotionally to the alienated and marginal character types that attracted Antonioni.&quot;

=== Larry Clark ===
The youths in Larry Clark&#x27;s &quot;Tulsa&quot; (1971) presented a striking contrast to any wholesome, down-home stereotype of the heartland that captured the collective American imagination. He turned the camera on himself and his lowlife amphetamine-shooting board of hanger-ons. Goldin would adopt Clark&#x27;s approach to image-making.

== Activism ==
=== Opioid crisis ===

In 2017, in a speech in Brazil, Goldin revealed she was recovering from opioid addiction, specifically to OxyContin, after being prescribed the drug after wrist surgery. She had sought treatment for her addiction and battled through rehab. This led to her setting up a campaign called &quot;Prescription Addiction Intervention Now&quot; (P.A.I.N.) pursuing social media activism directed against the Sackler family for their involvement in Purdue Pharma, manufacturers of OxyContin. Goldin has said the campaign attempts to contrast the philanthropic contributions of the Sackler family to art galleries, museums and universities with a lack of responsibility taken for the opioid crisis. Goldin became aware of the Sackler family in 2017.

In 2018, she organized a protest in the Sackler Wing&#x27;s Temple of Dendur at The Metropolitan Museum of Art. The protest called for museums and other cultural institutions not to accept money from the Sackler family.

Also in 2018, she was one of several artists who participated in a $100 sale organized by Magnum Photos and Aperture to raise funds for Goldin&#x27;s opioid awareness group P.A.I.N. (Prescription Addiction Intervention Now).&quot;I&#x27;ve started a group called P.A.I.N. to address the opioid crisis. We are a group of artists, activists and addicts that believe in direct action. We target the Sackler family, who manufactured and pushed OxyContin, through the museums and universities that carry their name. We speak for the 250,000 bodies that no longer can.&quot;In February 2019, Goldin staged a protest at the Guggenheim Museum in New York over its acceptance of funding by the Sackler family.

She also said that she would withdraw from a retrospective exhibition of her work at the National Portrait Gallery in London if they did not turn down a gift of £1 million from the Sacklers. The gallery subsequently said it would not proceed with the donation.

Two days after the National Portrait Gallery statement, the Tate group of British art galleries (Tate Modern and Tate Britain in London, Tate St Ives and Tate Liverpool) announced it would no longer accept any gifts offered by members of the Sackler family, from whom it had received £4 million. Tate Modern had been planning to display its copy of Goldin&#x27;s &quot;The Ballad of Sexual Dependency&quot; slideshow, for a year from April 15, 2019. Goldin had not discussed the show with Tate.

Goldin identified that Tate, which has received Sackler money, paid her for one of the ten copies of &quot;The Ballad of Sexual Dependency&quot; in 2015, when she was deeply addicted to OxyContin. She says she spent some of the money on buying black market OxyContin, as doctors would no longer prescribe her the drug.

In July 2019, Goldin and others from the group Prescription Addiction Intervention Now staged a protest in the fountain at the Louvre in Paris. The protest was to try to persuade the museum to change the name of its Sackler wing, which is made up of 12 rooms. In November that year, Goldin campaigned at the Victoria and Albert Museum, London.

=== Hamas–Israel conflict ===
In October 2023, soon after the 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel, Goldin signed a letter on &quot;Artforum&quot; that was criticized by pro-Israel activists for being antisemitic, as it did not mention the Palestinian organization Hamas or the Israelis who were killed. The letter received more than 8,000 signatures.

In November 2023, during the Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip, hundreds of members and supporters of Jewish Voice for Peace–New York City (JVP-NYC) took part in a sit-in protest in front of New York&#x27;s Statue of Liberty demanding a ceasefire in Gaza. Goldin addressed the demonstration, saying, &quot;As long as the people of Gaza are screaming, we need to yell louder, no matter who attempts to silence us.&quot; Goldin also canceled a photo shoot with the &quot;New York Times Magazine&quot; due to concerns about the &quot;New York Times&quot;&#x27; reporting on the Gaza crisis, accusing the newspaper of complicity with Israel in its reporting and further questioning its handling of Palestinian perspectives. Goldin was arrested on October 14, 2024 during a Jewish Voice for Peace protest in New York City.

== Recognition ==
In 2023, Goldin was described as the most influential person in the art world in &quot;ArtReview&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Power 100&quot; list of influential people in art.

===Censorship case in Brasil===
An exhibition of Goldin&#x27;s work was censored in Brazil, two months before opening, due to its sexually explicit nature. The main reason was that some of the photographs contained children in bed with their parents, who are naked and caressing each other. In Brazil, there is a law that prohibits the image of minors associated with pornography.
The sponsor of the exhibition, a cellphone company, claimed to be unaware of the content of Goldin&#x27;s work and that there was a conflict between the work and its educational project. The curator of the Rio de Janeiro Museum of Modern Art changed the schedule to accommodate, in February 2012, the Goldin exhibition in Brazil.

=== &quot;Witnesses: Against Our Vanishing&quot; ===
Curated by Goldin at Artists Space, &quot;Witnesses: Against Our Vanishing&quot; (November 16, 1989 – January 6, 1990) invited New York artists to respond to the HIV/AIDS crisis. Artists represented included David Armstrong, Tom Chesley, Dorit Cypis, Philip-Lorca DiCorcia, Jane Dickson, Darrel Ellis, Allen Frame, Peter Hujar, Greer Lankton, Siobhan Liddel, Mark Morrisroe, Jamie Nares, Perico Pastor, Margo Pelletier, Clarence Elie-Rivera, Vittorio Scarpati, Jo Shane, Kiki Smith, Janet Stein, Stephen Tashjian, Shellburne Thurber, Ken Tisa, and David Wojnarowicz. Goldin noted that artists&#x27; works varied in response, as &quot;out of loss comes memory pieces, tributes to friends and lovers who have died; out of anger comes explorations of the political cause and effects of the disease.&quot;

David Wojnarowicz&#x27;s essay &quot;Post Cards from America: X-Rays from Hell&quot; in the exhibition&#x27;s catalogue criticized conservative legislation that Wojnarowicz believed would increase the spread of HIV by discouraging safe sex education. Additionally, Wojnarowicz speaks about the efficacy of making the private public via the model of outing, as he and Goldin believed empowerment begins through self-disclosure. Embracing personal identities then becomes a political statement that disrupts oppressive rules of behavior of bourgeois society – though Wojnarowicz does admit outing may lock a subject into a single frozen identity. Goldin&#x27;s show was also met with criticism, but in particular Wojnarowicz&#x27;s explicit essay, Goldin as curator stood by, lead to the National Endowment for the Arts rescinding its support for the publication.

=== &quot;From Desire: A Queer Diary&quot; ===
Goldin&#x27;s second curated show, &quot;From Desire: A Queer Diary&quot; (March 29 – April 19, 1991), was held at the Richard F. Brush Art Gallery at St. Lawrence University, Canton, NY. Artists who were exhibited included David Armstrong, Eve Ashcraft, Kathryn Clark, Joyce Culver, Zoe Leonard, Simon Leung, Robert Mapplethorpe, Robert Windrum, and David Wojnarowicz.

===&quot;Nan&#x27;s Guests&quot;===
Rencontres d&#x27;Arles 2009, Arles, France. The major show of the photo festival included the work of thirteen photographers including Antoine d&#x27;Agata, David Armstrong, JH Engström, Christine Fenzl, Jim Goldberg, Boris Mikhailov, Anders Petersen and Annelies Strba.

==Depiction in film==
===Feature films===
With experimental filmmaker Bette Gordon Goldin worked several times. In &quot;Empty Suitcases&quot; from 1980 she acted alongside Irish artist and friend Vivienne Dick. In the 1983 film &quot;Variety&quot; Goldin plays a character called Nan. She also accompanied the production of the film with her camera; the photographs were published in 2009 (&quot;see bibliography&quot;). For Gordon&#x27;s 1998 &quot;Luminous Motion,&quot; she worked again as still photographer.

Goldin also provided still photography for two films by Sara Driver: &quot;You Are Not I&quot; (1981, co-written by Jim Jarmusch and its director), starring Goldin&#x27;s lover and friend Suzanne Fletcher, and herself playing one of the accident victims. In 1993 followed &quot;When Pigs Fly&quot; with Alfred Molina.

Photographs shown in the 1986 film &quot;Working Girls&quot;, as taken by the lead character Molly, were those of Goldin.

In the production of Mary Harron&#x27;s infamous &quot;I Shot Andy Warhol&quot; (1996) with Lili Taylor as Valerie Solanas, Goldin is listed for &quot;special photography&quot;.

The photographs by the character Lucy Berliner, played by actress Ally Sheedy in Lisa Cholodenko&#x27;s 1998 film &quot;High Art&quot;, were based on those by Goldin.

In the second season of the 2017 HBO series &quot;The Deuce&quot; by George Pelecanos and David Simon she has a cameo sitting at a bar.

===Documentary films===
On the occasion of her first major retrospective in the UK an early documentary was made beforehand in 1995 for the BBC by Edmund Coulthard, called like the show, &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Your Mirror.&quot; The film received a Teddy Award at the Berlin International Film Festival 1996, and the City of Melbourne Award at the Melbourne International Film Festival.

Paul Tschinkel did a 30 minute feature on occasion of the retrospective being shown at the Whitney Museum in New York, titled &quot;Nan Goldin: In My Life&quot;.

The intimate hour-long portrait &quot;Nan Goldin: I Remember Your Face&quot; directed by Sabine Lidl came out in 2011.

In 2022, filmmaker Laura Poitras&#x27; Peabody Award-winning documentary &quot;All the Beauty and the Bloodshed&quot; on Goldin premiered at the 79th Venice International Film Festival, The feature-length film interweaves Goldin&#x27;s biography told by herself, with her engagement with P.A.I.N. against the Sackler family, evolving in part during the Covid-19 pandemic. The film was awarded the Golden Lion in Venice and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature.

<text>The Network Computer (or NC) was a diskless desktop computer device made by Oracle Corporation from about 1996 to 2000. The devices were designed and manufactured by an alliance, which included Sun Microsystems (acquired by Oracle in 2010), IBM, and others. The devices were designed with minimum specifications, based on the Network Computer Reference Profile. The brand was also employed as a marketing term to try to popularize this design of computer within enterprise and among consumers.

The NC brand was mainly intended to inspire a range of desktop computers from various suppliers that, by virtue of their diskless design and use of inexpensive components and software, were cheaper and easier to manage than standard fat client desktops. However, due to the commoditization of standard desktop components, and due to the increasing availability and popularity of various software options for using full desktops as diskless nodes, thin clients, and hybrid clients, the Network Computer brand never achieved the popularity hoped for by Oracle and was eventually mothballed.

The term &quot;network computer&quot; is now used for any diskless desktop computer or a thin client.

==History ==

The failure of the NC to impact on the scale predicted by Larry Ellison may have been caused by a number of factors. Firstly, prices of PCs quickly fell below $1000, making the competition very hard. Secondly, the software available for NCs was neither mature nor open.

Thirdly, the idea could simply have been ahead of its time, as at the NC&#x27;s launch in 1996, the typical home Internet connection was only a 28.8 kbit/s modem dialup. This was simply insufficient for the delivery of executable content. The World Wide Web itself was not considered mainstream until its breakout year, 1998. Prior to this, very few Internet service providers advertised in mainstream press (at least outside of the US), and knowledge of the Internet was limited. This could have held back uptake of what would be seen as a very niche device with no (then) obvious appeal.

NCs ended up being used as the very &#x27;dumb terminals&#x27; they were intended to replace, as the proprietary backend infrastructure is not readily available. 1990s era NCs are often network-booted into a minimal Unix with X, to serve as X terminals. While NC purists may consider this to be a suboptimal use of NC hardware, the NCs work well as terminals, and are considerably cheaper than purpose-built terminal hardware.

==NC standards and drafts==

===Reference Profile===

The initial Network Computing standard, the Network Computer Reference Profile (NCRef), required that all &#x27;NC&#x27; appliances supported HTML, Java, HTTP, JPEG, and other key standards.

===Other standards===

Because many NCs did not use Intel CPUs or Microsoft software, Microsoft and Intel developed a competing standard called NetPC. Other alternatives to the NCRef were WeBRef (Motorola and HDS Network Systems) and Odin (National Semiconductor). The HDS @workStation was stated to ship by the end of June 1996.

===NC extensions===

==NC implementations==
===Acorn Network Computer===

The Acorn Network Computer was Oracle&#x27;s initial reference implementation of the NC. Its development was subcontracted to British company Acorn Computers, who adapted its own to create NCOS. Acorn made use of local partner companies ANT, Icon Technology and Design Edge to fulfil their contract.

===Macintosh NC===
In 1997 Apple announced the Mac NC, its attempt to develop the Pippin into a network computer platform. By the end of 1997, Steve Jobs discontinued all Macintosh clone efforts, effectively killing the Pippin, although key components of the Mac NC technology were inherited by the original iMac.

===NetProducts NetStation===
The first generation NetStation design and the NetStation trademark was licensed to NChannel, which provided the consumer equipment and Internet service (with associated infrastructure) for the UK market. After a few months, NChannel split into two entities: NetChannel (which provided the Internet service) and NetProducts which provided the consumer hardware.

NetProducts started working with Acorn to develop a next-generation product, NetStation II and started developing an email-only set-top-box (the TVemail). NetProducts went into voluntary liquidation in 1998 before either project was completed.

===Sun Microsystems JavaStation===
Sun Microsystems developed the JavaStation, a JavaOS-based NC based on SPARC hardware, initially similar to Sun&#x27;s range of Unix workstations.

===IBM Network Station===
IBM launched its Network Station in September 1996. As with the later reference design, the Network Station used a NetBSD-based NCOS booted over a LAN from an AS/400 or IBM PC server. The Network Station supported local execution of basic applications, such as a web browser and console. In addition, X capability was also implemented to allow both locally and remotely run applications to be used on the same machine. In practice, the lack of real applications meant that this was little more than a hardware X terminal.

The IBM Network Station was originally based on the PowerPC architecture, but the final few models used Intel Pentium processors.

==Contemporary analogy==
The idea behind the NC can be seen as existing in contemporary times in the system of cloud computing and in particular ChromeOS. In Wired magazine, Daniel Roth claims that the failure of the network computer eventually led to the development of cloud computing. A large contribution to this transition was attributed to Eric Schmidt, once the CTO of Sun Microsystems, a proponent of the network computer, who eventually became the CEO of Google. Google is a large purveyor of cloud technology, &quot;most notably Google Docs and Spreadsheets&quot;.

<doc id="309957" wikidata="Q3011311" url="?curid=309957" title="Phelsuma breviceps">
<text>Phelsuma breviceps is a diurnal species of gecko that is native to south-west Madagascar and typically dwells on trees and bushes. Its diet in the wild consists mainly of insects.

==Description==
This lizard belongs to the smallest day geckos. It can reach a maximum total length of about 10 cm. This species is easily recognised by its short snout, after which it has been named. The basic body colour is light grey to brownish. On the back there are light blue and dark dots and stripes. The legs have light blue spots.

==Distribution==
This species inhabits south-west Madagascar. It is found in the area around Toliara and near the Tsimanampetsotsa-lake.

==Habitat==

&quot;P. breviceps&quot; is adapted to a dry climate. It is often found on the succulent spurge &quot;Euphorbia stenoclada&quot; which has 7 cm long thorns.

==Diet==
These day geckos feed on various insects, other invertebrates and nectar, both in the wild and in captivity.

==Behaviour==
Like most geckos of the genus &quot;Phelsuma&quot;, this species is quite silent.

==Reproduction==
The females lay their eggs between the wood spurge thorns.

==Care and maintenance in captivity==
These animals should be housed in pairs and need a dry terrarium. These animals can be fed with crickets, wax moth, fruits flies, mealworms, houseflies and fruit baby food.

<doc id="309960" wikidata="Q1359898" url="?curid=309960" title="Cryptosporidiosis">
<text>Cryptosporidiosis, sometimes informally called crypto, is a parasitic disease caused by &quot;Cryptosporidium&quot;, a genus of protozoan parasites in the phylum Apicomplexa. It affects the distal small intestine and can affect the respiratory tract in both immunocompetent (i.e., individuals with a normal functioning immune system) and immunocompromised (e.g., persons with HIV/AIDS or autoimmune disorders) individuals, resulting in watery diarrhea with or without an unexplained cough. In immunosuppressed individuals, the symptoms are particularly severe and can be fatal. It is primarily spread through the fecal-oral route, often through contaminated water; recent evidence suggests that it can also be transmitted via fomites contaminated with respiratory secretions. &quot;Cryptosporidium&quot; is commonly isolated in HIV-positive patients presenting with diarrhea.

The organism was first described in 1907 by Tyzzer, who recognised it was a coccidian.

On January 8, 2025, a group of scientists from the Cryptosporidiosis Therapeutics Advocacy Group (CTAG) released an article in the newsletter &quot;Global Health NOW&quot; advocating for Cryptosporidiosis to be raised to the status of Neglected Tropical Disease (NTD) by the World Health Organization (WHO).

==Signs and symptoms==
Cryptosporidiosis may occur as an asymptomatic infection, an acute infection (i.e., duration shorter than 2 weeks), as recurrent acute infections in which symptoms reappear following a brief period of recovery for up to 30 days, and as a chronic infection (i.e., duration longer than 2 weeks) in which symptoms are severe and persistent. It may be fatal in individuals with a severely compromised immune system. Symptoms usually appear 5–10 days after infection (range: 2–28 days) and normally last for up to 2 weeks in immunocompetent individuals; symptoms are usually more severe and persist longer in immunocompromised individuals. Following the resolution of diarrhea, symptoms can reoccur after several days or weeks due to reinfection. The likelihood of is high in immunocompromised adults, and low in those with normal immune systems.

In immunocompetent individuals, cryptosporidiosis is primarily localized to the distal small intestine and sometimes the respiratory tract as well. In immunocompromised persons, cryptosporidiosis may disseminate to other organs, including the hepatobiliary system, pancreas, upper gastrointestinal tract, and urinary bladder; pancreatic and biliary infection can involve acalculous cholecystitis, sclerosing cholangitis, papillary stenosis, or pancreatitis.

===Intestinal cryptosporidiosis===

Common signs and symptoms of intestinal cryptosporidiosis include:
* Moderate to severe watery diarrhea, sometimes contains mucus and rarely contains blood or leukocytes
** In very severe cases, diarrhea may be profuse and cholera-like with malabsorption and hypovolemia
* Low-grade fever
* Crampy abdominal pain
* Dehydration
* Weight loss
* Fatigue
* Nausea and vomiting – suggests upper GI tract involvement and may lead to respiratory cryptosporidiosis
* Epigastric or right upper quadrant tenderness

Less common or rare signs and symptoms include:
* Reactive arthritis (may affect the hands, knees, ankles, and feet)
* Jaundice – suggests hepatobiliary involvement
* Ascites – suggests pancreatic involvement

===Respiratory cryptosporidiosis===

Symptoms of upper respiratory cryptosporidiosis include:
* Inflammation of the nasal mucosa, sinuses, larynx, or trachea
* Nasal discharge
* Voice change (e.g., hoarseness)

Symptoms of lower respiratory cryptosporidiosis include:
* Cough
* Shortness of breath
* Fever
* Hypoxemia

==Cause==

&quot;Cryptosporidium&quot; is a genus of protozoan pathogens which is categorized under the phylum Apicomplexa. Other apicomplexan pathogens include the malaria parasite &quot;Plasmodium&quot;, and &quot;Toxoplasma&quot;, the causative agent of toxoplasmosis. A number of &quot;Cryptosporidium&quot; infect mammals. In humans, the main causes of disease are &quot;C. parvum&quot; and &quot;C. hominis&quot; (previously &quot;C. parvum&quot; genotype 1). &quot;C. canis&quot;, &quot;C. felis&quot;, &quot;C. meleagridis&quot;, and &quot;C. muris&quot; can also cause disease in humans. &quot;Cryptosporidium&quot; is capable of completing its life cycle within a single host, resulting in microbial cyst stages that are excreted in feces and are capable of transmission to a new host via the fecal-oral route. Other vectors of disease transmission also exist.

The pattern of &quot;Cryptosporidium&quot; life cycle fits well with that of other intestinal homogeneous coccidian genera of the suborder &quot;Eimeriina&quot;: macro- and microgamonts develop independently; a microgamont gives rise to numerous male gametes; and oocysts serving for parasites&#x27; spreading in the environment. Electron microscopic studies made from the 1970s have shown the intracellular, although extracytoplasmic localization of &quot;Cryptosporidium&quot; species.

These species possess a number of unusual features:
* an endogenous phase of development in microvilli of epithelial surfaces
* two morphofunctional types of oocysts
* the smallest number of sporozoites per oocyst
* a multi-membraneous &quot;feeder&quot; organelle

DNA studies suggest a relationship with the gregarines rather than the coccidia. The taxonomic position of this group has not yet been finally agreed upon.

The genome of &quot;Cryptosporidium parvum&quot; was sequenced in 2004 and was found to be unusual amongst Eukaryotes in that the mitochondria seem not to contain DNA. A closely related species, &quot;C. hominis&quot;, also has its genome sequence available. CryptoDB.org is a NIH-funded database that provides access to the &quot;Cryptosporidium&quot; genomics data sets.

===Transfer===
Infection is through contaminated material such as earth, water, uncooked or cross-contaminated food that has been in contact with the feces of an infected individual or animal. Contact must then be transferred to the mouth and swallowed. It is especially prevalent amongst those in regular contact with bodies of fresh water including recreational water such as swimming pools. Other potential sources include insufficiently treated water supplies, contaminated food, or exposure to feces. The high resistance of &quot;Cryptosporidium&quot; oocysts to disinfectants such as chlorine bleach enables them to survive for long periods and still remain infective. Some outbreaks have happened in day care related to diaper changes.

The following groups have an elevated risk of being exposed to &quot;Cryptosporidium&quot;:
* Child care workers
* Parents of infected children
* People who take care of other people with cryptosporidiosis
* International travelers
* Backpackers, hikers, and campers who drink unfiltered, untreated water
* People, including swimmers, who swallow water from contaminated sources
* People who handle infected cattle
* People exposed to human feces through sexual contact

Cases of cryptosporidiosis can occur even in cities that have a properly de-contaminated water supply. In a city with clean water, it may be that cases of cryptosporidiosis have other origins. Testing of water, as well as epidemiological study, are necessary to determine the sources of specific infections. &quot;Cryptosporidium&quot; is causing serious illness more frequently in immunocompromised than in apparently healthy individuals. It may chronically sicken some children, as well as adults who are exposed and immunocompromised. A subset of the immunocompromised population is people with AIDS. Some sexual behaviors can transmit the parasite directly.

===Life cycle===
&quot;Cryptosporidium&quot; spp. exist as multiple cell types which correspond to different stages in an infection (e.g., a sexual and asexual stage). As an oocyst – a type of hardy, thick-walled spore – it can survive in the environment for months and is resistant to many common disinfectants, particularly chlorine-based disinfectants. After being ingested, the sporozoites within oocysts excyst (i.e., are released) in the small intestine. The released sporozoites subsequently attach to the microvilli of the epithelial cells of the small intestine. From there they become trophozoites that reproduce asexually by multiple fission, a process known as schizogony. The trophozoites develop into Type 1 meronts [1] that contain 8 daughter cells.

These daughter cells are Type 1 merozoites, which get released by the meronts. Some of these merozoites can cause autoinfection by attaching to epithelial cells. Others of these merozoites become Type II meronts, which contain 4 Type II merozoites. These merozoites get released and they attach to the epithelial cells. From there they become either macrogamonts or microgamonts. These are the female and male sexual forms, respectively. This stage, when sexual forms arise, is called gametogony.

Zygotes are formed by microgametes from the microgamont penetrating the macrogamonts. The zygotes develop into oocysts of two types. 20% of oocysts have thin walls and so can reinfect the host by rupturing and releasing sporozoites that start the process over again. The thick-walled oocysts are excreted into the environment. The oocysts are mature and infective upon being excreted.

==Pathogenesis==
The oocysts are ovoid or spherical and measure 5 to 6 micrometers across. When in flotation preparations they appear highly refractile. The oocysts contains up to 4 sporozoites that are bow-shaped.

As few as 2 to 10 oocysts can initiate an infection. The parasite is located in the brush border of the epithelial cells of the small intestine. They are mainly located in the jejunum. When the sporozoites attach the epithelial cells&#x27; membrane envelops them. Thus, they are &quot;intracellular but extracytoplasmic&quot;. The parasite can cause damage to the microvilli where it attaches. The infected human excretes the most oocysts during the first week. Oocysts can be excreted for weeks after the diarrhea subsides from infections by &quot;C. parvum&quot; or &quot;C. hominis&quot;; however, immunocompetent individuals with &quot;C. muris&quot; infections have been observed excreting oocysts for seven months.

The immune system reduces the formation of Type 1 merozoites as well as the number of thin-walled oocysts. This helps prevent autoinfection. B cells do not help with the initial response or the fight to eliminate the parasite.
Previous infection in immunocompetent individuals produces little resistance to future infection, however it may decrease the severity of disease and the number of oocysts excreted.

==Diagnosis==
There are many diagnostic tests for &quot;Cryptosporidium&quot;. They include microscopy, staining, and detection of antibodies. Microscopy can help identify oocysts in fecal matter. To increase the chance of finding the oocysts, the diagnostician should inspect at least 3 stool samples. There are several techniques to concentrate either the stool sample or the oocysts. The modified formalin-ethyl acetate (FEA) concentration method concentrates the stool. Both the modified zinc sulfate centrifugal flotation technique and the Sheather&#x27;s sugar flotation procedure can concentrate the oocysts by causing them to float. Another form of microscopy is fluorescent microscopy done by staining with auramine.

Other staining techniques include acid-fast staining, which will stain the oocysts red. One type of acid-fast stain is the Kinyoun stain. Giemsa staining can also be performed. Part of the small intestine can be stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H &amp; E), which will show oocysts attached to the epithelial cells.

Detecting antigens is yet another way to diagnose the disease. This can be done with direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) techniques. It can also be achieved through indirect immunofluorescence assay. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) also detects antigens.

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is another way to diagnose cryptosporidiosis. It can even identify the specific species of &quot;Cryptosporidium&quot;. If the patient is thought to have biliary cryptosporidiosis, then an appropriate diagnostic technique is ultrasonography. If that returns normal results, the next step would be to perform endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.

== Prevention ==
Many treatment plants that take raw water from rivers, lakes, and reservoirs for public drinking water production use conventional filtration technologies. This involves a series of processes, including coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation, and filtration. Direct filtration, which is typically used to treat water with low particulate levels, includes coagulation and filtration, but not sedimentation. Other common filtration processes, including slow sand filters, diatomaceous earth filters and membranes will remove 99% of &quot;Cryptosporidium&quot;. Membranes and bag and cartridge filters remove &quot;Cryptosporidium&quot; product-specifically.

While &quot;Cryptosporidium&quot; is highly resistant to chlorine disinfection, with high enough concentrations and contact time, &quot;Cryptosporidium&quot; will be inactivated by chlorine dioxide and ozone treatment. The required levels of chlorine generally preclude the use of chlorine disinfection as a reliable method to control &quot;Cryptosporidium&quot; in drinking water. Ultraviolet light treatment at relatively low doses will inactivate &quot;Cryptosporidium&quot;. Water Research Foundation-funded research originally discovered UV&#x27;s efficacy in inactivating &quot;Cryptosporidium&quot;.

One of the largest challenges in identifying outbreaks is the ability to identify &quot;Cryptosporidium&quot; in the laboratory. Real-time monitoring technology is now able to detect &quot;Cryptosporidium&quot; with online systems, unlike the spot and batch testing methods used in the past.

The most reliable way to decontaminate drinking water that may be contaminated by &quot;Cryptosporidium&quot; is to boil it.

In the US the law requires doctors and labs to report cases of cryptosporidiosis to local or state health departments. These departments then report to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The best way to prevent getting and spreading cryptosporidiosis is to have good hygiene and sanitation. An example would be hand-washing. Prevention is through washing hands carefully after going to the bathroom or contacting stool, and before eating. People should avoid contact with animal feces. They should also avoid possibly contaminated food and water. In addition, people should refrain from engaging in sexual activities that can expose them to feces.

Standard water filtration may not be enough to eliminate &quot;Cryptosporidium&quot;; boiling for at least 1 minute (3 minutes above of altitude) will decontaminate it. Heating milk at 71.7 °C (161 °F) for 15 seconds pasteurizes it and can destroy the oocysts&#x27; ability to infect. Water can also be made safe by filtering with a filter with pore size not greater than 1 micrometre, or by filters that have been approved for &quot;cyst removal&quot; by NSF International National Sanitation Foundation. Bottled drinking water is less likely to contain &quot;Cryptosporidium&quot;, especially if the water is from an underground source.

People with cryptosporidiosis should not swim in communal areas because the pathogen can reside in the anal and genital areas and be washed off. They should wait until at least two weeks after diarrhea stops before entering public water sources, since oocysts can still be shed for a while. Also, they should stay away from immunosuppressed people. Immunocompromised people should take care to protect themselves from water in lakes and streams. They should also stay away from animal stools and wash their hands after touching animals. To be safe, they should boil or filter their water. They should also wash and cook their vegetables.

The US CDC notes the recommendation of many public health departments to soak contaminated surfaces for 20 minutes with a 3% hydrogen peroxide (99% kill rate) and then rinse them thoroughly, with the caveat that no disinfectant is guaranteed to be completely effective against Cryptosporidium. However, hydrogen peroxide is more effective than standard bleach solutions.

==Treatment==
Symptomatic treatment primarily involves fluid rehydration, electrolyte replacement (sodium, potassium, bicarbonate, and glucose), and antimotility agents (e.g., loperamide). Supplemental zinc may improve symptoms, particularly in recurrent or persistent infections or in others at risk for zinc deficiency.

===Immunocompetent===

Immunocompetent individuals with cryptosporidiosis typically experience a short (i.e., duration of less than 2 weeks) self-limiting course of diarrhea that may require symptomatic treatment and ends with spontaneous recovery; in some circumstances, antiparasitic medication may be required (e.g., recurrent, severe, or persistent symptoms); however reinfection frequently occurs.

, nitazoxanide is the only antiparasitic drug treatment with proven efficacy for cryptosporidiosis in immunocompetent individuals; however, it lacks efficacy in severely immunocompromised patients. Certain agents such as paromomycin and azithromycin are sometimes used as well, but they only have partial efficacy.

===Immunocompromised===
In immunocompromised individuals, such as AIDS patients, cryptosporidiosis resolves slowly or not at all, and frequently causes a particularly severe and persistent form of watery diarrhea coupled with a greatly decreased ability to absorb key nutrients through the intestinal tract. As a result, infected individuals may experience severe dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, malnutrition, wasting, and potentially death. In general, the mortality rate for infected AIDS patients is based on CD4+ marker counts. Patients with CD4+ counts over 180 cells/mm3 recover with supportive hospital care and medication; but, in patients with CD4+ counts below 50 cells/mm3, the effects are usually fatal within 3 to 6 months. During the 1993 Milwaukee cryptosporidiosis outbreak (the largest of its kind), 73% of AIDS patients with CD4+ counts lower than 50 cells/mm3 and 36% of those with counts between 50 and 200 cells/mm3 died within the first year of contracting the infection.

The best treatment approach is to improve the immune status in immunodeficient individuals using highly active antiretroviral therapy that includes an HIV protease inhibitor along with continued use of antiparasitic medication. Antiparasitic drug treatment for immunocompromised individuals usually involves the combination of nitazoxanide, paromomycin, and azithromycin together; these drugs are only partially active in HIV/AIDS patients compared to their effect in immunocompetent persons. A Cochrane Collaboration review recommended that nitazoxanide be considered for use in treatment despite its reduced effectiveness in immunocompromised individuals.

Currently, research is being done in molecular-based immunotherapy. For example, synthetic isoflavone derivates have been shown to fight off &quot;Cryptosporidium parvum&quot; both &quot;in vitro&quot; and in animal studies. Derivates of nitazoxanide, known as thiazolides, have also shown promising results &quot;in vitro&quot;. rifaximin is also sometimes used for immunocompromised patients/patients with severe disease.

==Epidemiology==
Cryptosporidiosis is found worldwide. It causes 50.8% of water-borne diseases that are attributed to parasites. In developing countries, 8–19% of diarrheal diseases can be attributed to &quot;Cryptosporidium&quot;. Ten percent of the population in developing countries excretes oocysts. In developed countries, the number is lower at 1–3%. The age group most affected are children from 1 to 9 years old.

In Eastern Europe cryptosporidiosis in humans and animals is common, but there are considerable gaps in surveillance and a lack of comparable methods which limit the understanding of the disease and detection of outbreaks. Research shows a rich diversity of zoonotic subtypes of the parasite in animals indicating a rich potential of animal to human transmission.
Roughly 30% of adults in the United States are seropositive for cryptosporidiosis, meaning that they contracted the infection at some point in their lives.

==Research==
A recombinant &quot;Cryptosporidium parvum&quot; oocyst surface protein (rCP15/60) vaccine has produced an antibody response in a large group of cows and also antibody response in calves fed rCP15/60-immune colostrum produced by these vaccinated cows. This is very promising. Human &quot;Cryptosporidium parvum&quot; infections are particularly prevalent and often fatal in infants in developing countries and to immunocompromised people, such as AIDS patients. There is no commercially available effective vaccine against &quot;Cryptosporidium parvum&quot;, although passive immunization utilizing different zoite surface (glyco)proteins has shown promise. Developmental stages of the life cycle of the parasite might act as possible targets for vaccine development. The organism is detected in 65–97% of the surface-water supply in the United States and is resistant to most disinfectants used for the treatment of drinking water. Antibodies in the serum of humans and animals infected with &quot;Cryptosporidium parvum&quot; react with several antigens, one of which is a 15  protein (CP15) located on the surface of the organism. This protein is a good candidate for use as a molecular vaccine because previous studies have shown that a monoclonal antibody to CP15 confers passive immunity to mice. Currently, there is no vaccine or completely effective drug therapy against &quot;Cryptosporidium parvum&quot; in HIV/AIDS individuals.

A summary of discoveries presented at the most recent (June 2019) international symposium on &quot;Cryptosporidium&quot; has been published in 2020.

==Other animals==
The most important zoonotic reservoirs are cattle, sheep and goats. In addition, in recent years, cryptosporidiosis has plagued many commercial leopard gecko breeders. Several species of the Cryptosporidium family (C. serpentes and others) are involved, and outside of geckos it has been found in monitor lizards, iguanas and tortoises, as well as several snake species.

==Notable cases==
===Before 2000===
* In 1987, 13,000 people in Carrollton, Georgia, United States, became ill with cryptosporidiosis. This was the first report of its spread through a municipal water system that met all state and federal drinking water standards.
* In 1993, a waterborne cryptosporidiosis outbreak occurred in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, US. An estimated 403,000 people became ill, including 4,400 people hospitalized. The source of the Cryptosporidium is believed to be overflow from the Milwaukee area combined sanitary and storm sewer system into Lake Michigan, which was then taken into the Howard Avenue Water Purification Plant and distributed to an estimated 880,000 residents (of the 1.61 million residents in the Milwaukee area who receive their drinking water from Lake Michigan). These residents, who receive their drinking water from Lake Michigan, were told to boil their water before drinking it. More people were affected in this one outbreak than the combined number of people affected in every cryptosporidiosis outbreak in the 24 years since then. An estimated 69 people died during the outbreak, according to the CDC.
* The UK&#x27;s biggest outbreak occurred in Torbay in Devon in 1995.
* In the summer of 1996, &quot;Cryptosporidium&quot; affected approximately 2,000 people in Cranbrook, British Columbia, Canada. Weeks later, a separate incident occurred in Kelowna, British Columbia, where 10,000 to 15,000 people got sick.

===2001–2009===
* In April 2001, an outbreak occurred in the city of North Battleford, Saskatchewan, Canada. Between 5800 and 7100 people had diarrheal illness, and 1,907 cases of cryptosporidiosis were confirmed. Equipment failures at the city&#x27;s antiquated water filtration plant following maintenance were found to have caused the outbreak.
* In the summer of 2005, after numerous reports by patrons of gastrointestinal upset, a water park at Seneca Lake State Park, in the Finger Lakes region of upstate New York was found to have two water storage tanks infected with &quot;Cryptosporidium&quot;. By early September 2005, over 3,800 people reported symptoms of a &quot;Cryptosporidium&quot; infection. The &quot;Sprayground&quot; was ordered closed for the season on 15 August.
* In October 2005, the Gwynedd and Anglesey areas of North Wales, the United Kingdom, had an outbreak of cryptosporidiosis. The outbreak may have been linked to the drinking water supply from Llyn Cwellyn, but this is not yet confirmed. As a result, 231 people fell ill and the company Welsh Water (Dwr Cymru) advised 61,000 people to boil their water before use.
* In March 2007, a suspected outbreak occurred in Galway, Ireland, after the source of water for much of the county, Lough Corrib, was suspected to be contaminated with the parasite. A large population (90,000 people), including areas of both Galway City and County, were advised to boil water for drinking, food preparation and for brushing teeth. On 21 March 2007, it was confirmed that the city and county&#x27;s water supply was contaminated with the parasite. The area&#x27;s water supply was finally given approval on 20 August 2007, five months after &quot;Cryptosporidium&quot; was first detected. Around 240 people are known to have contracted the disease; experts say the true figure could be up to 5,000.
* Hundreds of public pools in 20 Utah counties were closed to young children in 2007, as children under 5 are most likely to spread the disease, especially children wearing diapers. As of 10 September 2007 the Utah Department of Health had reported 1302 cases of cryptosporidiosis in the year; a more usual number would be 30. On 25 September the pools were reopened to those not requiring diapers, but hyperchlorination requirements were not lifted.
* On 21 September 2007, a &quot;Cryptosporidium&quot; outbreak attacked the Western United States: 230 Idaho residents, with hundreds across the Rocky Mountain area; in the Boise and Meridian areas; Utah, 1,600 illnesses; Colorado and other Western states — Montana, decrease.
* On 25 June 2008, &quot;Cryptosporidium&quot; was found in England in water supplies in Northampton, Daventry, and some surrounding areas supplied from the Pitsford Reservoir, as reported on the BBC. People in the affected areas were warned not to drink tap water unless it had been boiled. Anglian Water confirmed that 108,000 households were affected, about 250,000 people. They advised that water might not be fit for human consumption for many weeks. The boil notice was lifted for all the affected customers on 4 July 2008.
* Throughout the summer of 2008; many public swimming areas, water parks, and public pools in the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex of Texas had an outbreak of cryptosporidiosis. Burger&#x27;s Lake in Fort Worth was the first to report such an outbreak. This prompted some, if not all, city-owned and private pools to close and hyperchlorinate. To the 13 August 2008 there were 400 reported cases of &quot;Cryptosporidium&quot;.
* In September 2008, a gym in Cambridge, the United Kingdom, was forced to close its swimming pool until further notice after health inspectors found an outbreak of cryptosporidiosis. Environmental Health authorities requested that the water be tested after it was confirmed that a young man had been infected.

===2010 and later===
* In May 2010, the Behana creek water supply south of Cairns, Australia, was found to be contaminated by cryptosporidium.
* In July 2010, a local sports center in Cumbernauld (east of Glasgow, UK) detected traces of cryptosporidium in its swimming pools, causing a temporary closure of the swimming pools.
* In November 2010, over 4000 cases of cryptosporidiosis were reported in Östersund, Sweden. The source of contamination was the tap water. In mid December 2010 the number of reported cases was 12,400 according to local media.
* As of April 2011, there has been an ongoing outbreak in Skellefteå, Sweden. Although many people have been diagnosed with cryptosporidiosis, the source of the parasite has not yet been found. Several tests have been taken around the water treatment unit &quot;Abborren&quot;, but so far no results have turned up positive. Residents are being advised to boil the tap water as they continue to search for the contaminating source.
* Since May 2011, there has been an ongoing outbreak in South Roscommon in Ireland. Although many people have been diagnosed with cryptosporidiosis, the source of the parasite has not yet been found. Testing continues and Roscommon County Council are now considering introducing Ultra Violet Filtration to their water treatment process in the next 12 months. Residents are being advised to boil the tap water and there is no sign of this boil notice being lifted in the near future.
* In May 2013, in Roscommon, Ireland, another outbreak of the cryptosporidiosis was reported and a boil water notice was issued. This was the second time the parasite was detected in a month in the Roscommon water supply. The source of one of the outbreaks had been linked to the agricultural community. At least 13 people were treated for Cryptosporidiosis.
* In September 2023, in Queenstown, New Zealand there was an outbreak reported and a boil water notice was issued a day after it was discovered. A link has been made to possible human faecal contamination. More than 60 people were treated for Cryptosporidiosis.
* In May 2024, in Devon, United Kingdom there was an outbreak reported and South West Water had to issue a boil notice to 16,000 households and businesses in Brixham, Boohay, Kingswear, Roseland and North West Paignton. The suspected cause of the issue may be a damaged air valve which may have allowed animal waste or contaminated ground water to enter the water supply. Further testing is being sought to rule out any further causations.

<text>Independent Computing Architecture (ICA) is a proprietary protocol for an application server system, designed by Citrix Systems. The protocol lays down a specification for passing data between servers and clients, but is not bound to any one platform. Citrix&#x27;s ICA is an alternative to Microsoft&#x27;s Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).

Practical products conforming to ICA are Citrix&#x27;s WinFrame, Citrix XenApp (formerly called MetaFrame/Presentation Server), and Citrix XenDesktop products. These permit ordinary Windows applications to be run on a suitable Windows server and for any supported client to gain access to those applications. Besides Windows, ICA is also supported on a number of Unix server platforms and can be used to deliver access to applications running on these platforms. The client platforms do not have to run Windows; for instance, there are clients available for Mac, Unix, Linux, and various smartphones. ICA client software is also built into various thin client platforms.

ICA is broadly similar in purpose to window servers such as the X Window System. It also provides for the feedback of user input from the client to the server, and a variety of means for the server to send graphical output, as well as other media such as audio, from the running application to the client.

The key challenges in an architecture are network latency and performance—a graphically intensive application (as most are when presented using a GUI) being served over a slow or bandwidth-restricted network connection requires considerable compression and optimization to render the application usable by the client. The client machine may be on a different platform and may not have the same GUI routines available locally; in this case, the server may need to send the actual bitmap data over the connection. Depending on the client&#x27;s capabilities, servers may also off-load part of the graphical processing to the client, e.g. to render multimedia content. ICA runs natively over TCP port 1494 or may be encapsulated in Common Gateway Protocol (CGP) on TCP 2598. ICA supports the concept of channels at a session layer to encapsulate rich media redirection or USB extension within ICA.

<text>Coast to Coast AM is an American late-night radio talk show that deals with a variety of topics. Most frequently the topics relate to either the paranormal or conspiracy theories. It was hosted by creator Art Bell from its inception in 1988 until 2003, and is currently hosted by George Noory. The program is distributed by Premiere Networks, a subsidiary of iHeartMedia, both as part of its talk network and separately as a syndicated program. The program now airs seven nights a week from 1:00–5:00 a.m. ET. It airs on over 600 affiliates, and has repeatedly been called the most popular overnight show in the country.

== History ==
In 1978, Art Bell created and hosted &quot;West Coast AM&quot;, a late-night political talk/call-in show on Las Vegas radio station KDWN. In 1988, Bell and Alan Corberth renamed the show &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot; and moved its studios from the Plaza Hotel in Las Vegas to Bell&#x27;s home in Pahrump. After Bell&#x27;s retirement, the show was hosted by various personalities, including Mike Siegel, George Noory, and others.

At its peak, &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot; under Bell was syndicated by Premiere Radio Network, and aired on more than 500 radio stations and boasted a weekly listening audience in excess of 10 million listeners. Since 2013 the weekly listener numbers have declined to 2.5 million. According to estimates by &quot;Talkers Magazine&quot;, &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot; has a cumulative weekly audience of around 2.75 million unique listeners listening for at least five minutes, making it the most listened-to program in its time slot. By 2010 the program was known as by far the most popular overnight show in the country, echoed by &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 2017, citing Nielsen ratings.

The show is estimated to be carried by over 600 US affiliates, along with a limited number of FM stations, as well as many Canadian affiliates, several of which stream the show on their station&#x27;s website. The affiliate group is fronted by 12 clear-channel stations, among them WBT in Charlotte, WHO in Des Moines, WWL in New Orleans, WOR in New York City, KFBK in Sacramento, KFI in Los Angeles, and WTAM in Cleveland. The show is also carried by Sirius XM Radio, on its Road Dog Trucking channel 146.

==Criticism==
Scholars have criticized &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot; for promoting pseudohistoric and pseudoscientific ideas. Historian Ronald H. Fritze characterized the show as an &quot;especially influential example&quot; of the trend in modern media to disseminate false history and fake science.

According to State University of New York (SUNY) professor Paul Arras, early shows hosted by Art Bell featured guests that were frequently pseudoscientists, but &quot;regardless of their reputation, all guests are presented as experts.&quot; According to Arras &quot;Bell seems to believe much of what even his wildest guests say&quot;. Boston College professor Michael C. Keith noted a &quot;characteristic of distrust and fear that is a part of the text of Coast to Coast —fear of the unknown, fear of invasion, fear of being taken over by some kind of evil force&quot;.

Religious Studies lecturer David G. Robertson observed that &quot;sweeping conspiratorial revisionist histories and ancient alien narratives&quot; are a frequent feature of the show. Nolan Higdon of California State University, East Bay speculated that programs like &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot; that &quot;propagate unsubstantiated claims&quot; were &quot;potentially dangerous&quot;.

According to &quot;The Atlantic&quot; senior editor Timothy Lavin, host George Noory &quot;lets clearly delusional or pseudoscientific assertions slide by without challenge&quot;. Lavin wrote that &quot;Coast to Coast AM has perfected a charged and conspiratorial worldview that now pervades American media&quot;.

In 1998, the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry awarded show host Art Bell their mocking &quot;Snuffed Candle Award&quot;, citing his work &quot;for encouraging credulity, presenting pseudoscience as genuine, and contributing to the public&#x27;s lack of understanding of the methods of scientific inquiry&quot;.
CSI fellow Joe Nickell has appeared on the show occasionally as &quot;a voice of skepticism&quot;, saying his goal was to explain and demystify the &quot;bizarre topics &#x27;Coast to Coast&#x27; deals with&quot; such as Bigfoot and ghosts.

==Hosts==
===Art Bell===

Bell was the original host of the show, starting in 1988. He announced his retirement in 2000, but would return as show host, retire, and return again a number of times. Bell died in April 2018.

===Mike Siegel===

Mike Siegel hosted the show from April 2000 until February 2001. He became a frequent substitute for Bell in late 1999, and when Bell announced his retirement in early 2000, he recommended Siegel to succeed him. Siegel maintained the format of the show that Bell had created, but his personal style was very different, and the show became less popular. Siegel hosted the show from Seattle, Washington, where he lived. Early in 2001, Bell decided to return, and Siegel left the show.

===Ian Punnett===

Ian Punnett hosted the show sporadically, as either guest host or main host, between 1998 and 2012, and from 2018 to 2023. Punnett died in December of 2023.

===John B. Wells===

In January 2012, John B. Wells replaced Punnett as host of the Saturday evening and the second Sunday evening programs.

===George Noory===

George Noory first took over show hosting duties in 2003 as a replacement for Bell, but was temporarily discontinued after Bell returned citing disagreements with Noory. After Bell&#x27;s death in April 2018, Noory said that the two were &quot;not that close&quot; personally and that there were major differences in their approaches. Despite this, Noory said that Bell was &quot;instrumental in me being where I am right now.&quot; Noory currently hosts the show on weeknights and on the first Sunday of every month.

George Knapp joined the show in 2007 and is currently hosting every third and fourth Sundays of every month.

==Associated shows==
Several shows associated with &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot; have aired in the slot immediately preceding the late Saturday night edition of the program, from 6–10 p.m. Pacific Time.

===&quot;Dreamland&quot;===
&quot;Dreamland&quot; was another Art Bell creation, nearly identical to &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot; but less caller driven. Bell recorded &quot;Dreamland&quot; on Friday afternoons where the show streamed live over the Internet and listeners could call in towards the end of the show. The show then aired at various times on different stations during the weekend, but doing eight shows a week got to be too much and he handed over control of the show to Whitley Strieber. Many affiliates aired the show before &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot; on Sunday nights, but Premiere Radio pre-empted that time spot after it began to syndicate Matt Drudge, and then dropped the program entirely.

===&quot;Coast to Coast Live&quot;===
Upon Art Bell&#x27;s January 2006 return, Ian Punnett hosted &quot;Coast to Coast Live&quot; on Saturdays from 9 p.m. to 1 a.m. Eastern Time. A spin-off of the original &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot;, the show covered similar topics as its flagship program. With Bell&#x27;s July 2007 retirement, &quot;Coast to Coast Live&quot; was discontinued, with Punnett returning to host the regular Saturday edition.

===&quot;Art Bell, Somewhere in Time&quot;===
Replacing &quot;Coast to Coast Live&quot; in the late Saturday time slot is a series of reruns of classic Art Bell episodes of &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot;, airing under the title &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot;.

===&quot;Midnight in the Desert&quot;===
Midnight in the Desert was a live radio and podcast which Art Bell founded. The program was later hosted by Heather Wade and then by Dave Schrader.

<text>David James Pelzer (born December 29, 1960) is an American author of several autobiographical and self-help books. His 1995 memoir of childhood abuse, &quot;A Child Called &quot;It&quot;: One Child&#x27;s Courage to Survive&quot;, was listed on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list for several years, and in 5 years had sold at least 1.6 million copies. The book brought Pelzer fame, and has also been a source of controversy, with accusations of several events being fabricated coming from both family members and journalists.

==Biography==
Pelzer was born in San Francisco, California on December 29, 1960, and was the second of five boys. He grew up in Daly City, California. He is the son of Catherine Roerva Christensen Pelzer (1929–1992) and San Francisco fireman Stephen Joseph Pelzer (1923–1980). Pelzer&#x27;s books describe the abuse he suffered for several years of his childhood, including continual mistreatment and beatings by his mother, whom he said thought of it as a game. His teachers stepped in on March 5, 1973, and 12-year-old Pelzer was placed in foster care. At age 18, in 1979, he joined the U.S. Air Force and served in the Gulf War. In the 1980s, Pelzer married his first wife, Patsy (a pseudonym), with whom he had a son. In 1996, he carried a torch in the Summer Olympics torch relay. Pelzer and Patsy divorced, and many years later, he married his second wife, Marsha Donohoe, who was his editor.

==Childhood experiences==
Pelzer&#x27;s book &quot;A Child Called &quot;It&quot;&quot; describes from his viewpoint the severe abuse he suffered as a child. He refers to his relatives by pseudonyms. He writes how his mother was physically and emotionally abusive towards him from ages 4 to 12. He describes how his mom starved him, forced him to drink ammonia, stabbed him in the stomach, burned his arm on a gas stove, and forced him to eat his own vomit. He mentioned that his father was not active in resolving or stopping the conflicts between Pelzer and his alcoholic mother. He was sent to a foster family at age 12 in 1973. His second book &quot;The Lost Boy&quot; covers the time frame when he was in foster care. By the time Pelzer was taken out of the home, he had already suffered a great deal mentally. This caused Pelzer to act out growing up. Although the main abuse had stopped, he continued to face mental anguish. Throughout his teen years, he struggled to feel loved. Being in a foster home and having suffered abuse caused him to yearn for the family and love he could not have. He later forgave his father for ignoring the abuse, and wrote a letter to his mom saying he loved her as his mother, but would never see her again. She died before he could send it. Throughout the rest of his life, he somewhat healed from the abuse but would never forget what he had been through. He has written several self help books to help others overcome the challenges and abuse they have suffered.

One of Pelzer&#x27;s brothers, Richard B. Pelzer, published his own autobiography, &quot;A Brother&#x27;s Journey&quot;, that detailed his experiences. Richard Pelzer said in the afterword of his book that his objective for his story was to show how a parent can become abusive and how the human spirit can triumph and survive.

== Books ==
Pelzer&#x27;s first book, &quot;A Child Called &quot;It&quot;&quot;, was published in 1995 and describes the abuse Pelzer suffered in his childhood. His second book, &quot;The Lost Boy: A Foster Child&#x27;s Search for the Love of a Family&quot; was published shortly after in 1997. The book covered Pelzer&#x27;s teen years. The third book in his series, &quot;A Man Named Dave: A Story of Triumph and Forgiveness&quot; was about Pelzer&#x27;s experiences as an adult and how he forgave his father. In 2001, he wrote &quot;Help Yourself: Finding Hope, Courage, And Happiness&quot; which was a self-help book. When discussing his seventh book &quot;Moving Forward&quot; he said, &quot;My message has always been about resilience.&quot;

* &quot;A Child Called &quot;It&quot;&quot; – Pelzer&#x27;s first book, it tells his story and describes the physical and mental abuse he suffered from ages 4–12 at the hands of his mother. This book goes into detail about the abuse, including beatings, starvation, manipulation games, and even being stabbed. The book ends with Pelzer being placed into foster care.
* &quot;The Lost Boy&quot; – Pelzer&#x27;s second book and a continuation of his first book, &quot;A Child Called &quot;It&quot;.&quot; This book was released in 1997 and covers the time period in Pelzer&#x27;s life when he was in foster care. During this book, Pelzer faces great emotional turmoil. He went to court and described what his mother had done, ending with him in the foster care system. Pelzer wondered if the abuse he endured was his fault. While in his first foster home, Pelzer acted out frequently and was involved in petty theft. He would still see his mother, who would promise to get him back, but he eventually ended up going to different foster families, getting in more trouble, and finally getting sent to a juvenile hall. After Pelzer aged out of foster care, he enlisted in the Air Force. The book ends with Pelzer having learned how to treat others and be a better person.
* &quot;A Man Named David&quot; – This book is the third in the &quot;A Child Called &quot;It&quot;&quot; series. This book takes place when Pelzer is an adult. It describes him becoming the person he is now, and how he handles what happened in the past. He tries to find answers and ways to heal in this book, as well as trying to find closure with his biological parents.

===Reception of &quot;A Child Called &quot;It&quot;&quot;===
His first book, &quot;A Child Called &quot;It&quot;,&quot; was successful and generated interest. It was listed on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list for several years and in five years had sold at least 1.6 million copies. Pelzer was invited to television shows such as &quot;The Montel Williams Show&quot; and &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; to give interviews after the book was published.

In a 2001 news article, Orion UK Publishing&#x27;s Trevor Dolby said, &quot;We get 10 letters a day from people saying the first book mirrors their own childhood, which is very depressing.&quot; One reader was quoted: &quot;(The book) made me see that I wasn&#x27;t the only one out there...that had this...in their life. That there&#x27;s people who do understand.&quot;

Writer David Plotz criticized Pelzer in an article he wrote for &quot;Slate&quot;. In the article Plotz says that because Pelzer&#x27;s parents are dead they cannot question how they are depicted.

==== Awards ====
&quot;A Child Called &quot;It&quot;&quot; has received the following accolades:

* 2010 Popular Paperbacks for Young Adults
* 2002 Popular Paperbacks for Young Adults

==== Challenges ====
According to the American Library Association, &quot;A Child Called &quot;It&quot;&quot; has been frequently banned and challenged in the United States. The book landed the 36th spot on the list of the top books challenged between 2010 and 2019.

==Controversy==
In 2002, Pat Jordan wrote a disputed article in &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; that questioned the reliability of Pelzer&#x27;s recollections. He said that &quot;Pelzer has an exquisite recall of his abuse, but almost no recall of anything that would authenticate that abuse&quot;, such as any details about his mother. Pelzer&#x27;s younger brother, Stephen Pelzer, has disputed his book, denying that any abuse took place, and stating that he thinks Pelzer was placed in foster care because &quot;he started a fire and was caught shoplifting&quot;, and goes on to accuse Pelzer of having been discharged from the U.S. Air Force on psychological grounds. However, another brother, Richard Pelzer, author of the book &quot;A Brother&#x27;s Journey&quot;, affirms much of what Pelzer has said and describes his own abuse when Dave was finally removed from the home. In regard to Stephen&#x27;s comments, Pelzer has said that Stephen is &quot;semi-retarded, he has Bell&#x27;s palsy. He worshipped my mum. He misses her terribly because she protected him.&quot; Furthermore, he has documented proof thatcontrary to Stephen&#x27;s accusationshe was honorably discharged from the U.S. Air Force. Due to the criticism from &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; article, Pelzer does not give interviews often.

In an article in &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, Pelzer&#x27;s maternal grandmother said she believed Pelzer had been abused but not as severely as he described. She also said she did not believe his brother Richard was abused. It was revealed, however, that Pelzer&#x27;s grandmother did not live in the same state as his family and was not in contact with them at the time of the abuse.

In a review for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Geraldine Bedell notes that gaps in the background narrative &quot;makes the foreground harder to trust&quot;, but believes that &quot;substantially, [Pelzer]&#x27;s telling the truth ... But there is a definite feeling of exaggeration in the later two books...&quot;. More than any concern about the veracity of all the minutiae in the novel, she was bothered by the trend of authors even writing about their abusive childhoods, grouping Pelzer with Andrea Ashworth, Jennifer Lauck, Martin Amis and Tony Thornton as authors who she feels are merely profiting from their abuse by writing in an entertaining stylethough she does mention examples of &quot;national and local agencies working with sexual-abuse survivors&quot; appreciating the honest portrayal of what happens in these situations.

==Other work==
Pelzer does community work and has given lectures across the country. As a motivational speaker, he speaks to high school students and adults about the concept of resilience.

<doc id="309966" wikidata="Q1921438" url="?curid=309966" title="Merchant bank">
<text>A merchant bank is historically a bank dealing in commercial loans and investment. In modern British usage, it is the same as an investment bank. Merchant banks were the first modern banks and evolved from medieval merchants who traded in commodities, particularly cloth merchants. Historically, merchant banks&#x27; purpose was to facilitate or finance the production and trade of commodities, hence the name &quot;merchant&quot;. Few banks today restrict their activities to such a narrow scope.

In modern usage in the United States, the term additionally has taken on a more narrow meaning, and refers to a financial institution providing capital to companies in form of share ownership instead of loans. A merchant bank also provides advice on corporate matters to the firms in which they invest. 

==History==
Merchant banks were the first modern banks. They emerged in the Middle Ages from the Italian grain and cloth merchants community and started to develop in the 11th century during the large European fair of St. Giles (England), then at the Champagne fairs (France). As the Lombardy merchants and bankers grew in stature based on the strength of the Lombard plains cereal crops, many displaced Jews fleeing Spanish persecution were attracted to the trade. The Florentine merchant banking community was exceptionally active and propagated new finance practices all over Europe. Both Jews and Florentine merchants perfected ancient practices used in the Middle East trade routes and the Far East silk routes. Originally intended for the finance of long trading journeys, these methods were applied to finance the medieval Commercial Revolution. 

Jews entered the great trading piazzas and halls of Lombardy, alongside the local traders, and set up their benches to trade in crops. They had one great advantage over the locals. Christians were strictly forbidden from any kind of lending at interest, since such activities were equated with the sin of usury. Jewish law disallowed usury among Jews, but not when the borrower was Gentile. The Jewish newcomers, on the other hand, could lend to farmers against crops in the field, a high-risk loan at what would have been considered usurious rates by the Church; but the Jews were not subject to the Church&#x27;s dictates. In this way they could secure the grain-sale rights against the eventual harvest. They then began to advance payment against the future delivery of grain shipped to distant ports. In both cases, they made their profit from the present discount against the future price. This two-handed trade was time-consuming and soon there arose a class of merchants who were trading grain debt instead of grain.

The court Jew performed both financing (credit) and underwriting (insurance) functions. Financing took the form of a farmer obtaining a crop loan at the beginning of the growing season, which allowed a farmer to develop and manufacture (through seeding, growing, weeding, and harvesting) his annual crop. Underwriting in the form of a crop, or commodity, insurance guaranteed the delivery of the crop to its buyer, typically a merchant wholesaler. In addition, traders performed the merchant function by making arrangements to supply the buyer of the crop through alternative sources—grain stores or alternate markets, for instance—in the event of crop failure. He could also keep the farmer (or other commodity producer) in business during a drought or other crop failure, through the issuance of a crop (or commodity) insurance against the hazard of failure of his crop. 

Merchant banking progressed from financing trade on one&#x27;s own behalf to settling trades for others and then to holding deposits for settlement of &quot;billette&quot; or notes written by the people who were still brokering the actual grain. And so the merchant&#x27;s &quot;benches&quot; (&quot;bank&quot; is derived from the Italian for bench, &quot;banco&quot;, as in a counter) in the great grain markets became centers for holding money against a bill (&quot;billette&quot;, a note, a letter of formal exchange, later a bill of exchange and later still a cheque). 

These deposited funds were intended to be held for the settlement of grain trades, but often were used for the bench&#x27;s own trades in the meantime. The term bankrupt is a corruption of the Italian &quot;banca rotta&quot;, or broken bench, which is what happened when someone lost his traders&#x27; deposits. Being &quot;broke&quot; has the same connotation.

A sensible manner of discounting interest to the depositors against what could be earned by employing their money in the trade of the bench soon developed; in short, selling an &quot;interest&quot; to them in a specific trade, thus overcoming the usury objection. Once again this merely developed what was an ancient method of financing long-distance transport of goods. 

The medieval Italian markets were disrupted by wars and in any case were limited by the fractured nature of the Italian states. And so the next generation of bankers arose from migrant Jewish merchants in the great wheat-growing areas of Germany and Poland. Many of these merchants were from the same families who had been part of the development of the banking process in Italy. They also had links with family members who had, centuries before, fled Spain for both Italy and England. As non-agricultural wealth expanded, many families of goldsmiths (another business not prohibited to Jews) also gradually moved into banking. This course of events set the stage for the rise of Jewish family banking firms whose names still resonate today, such as Warburgs and Rothschilds. 
The rise of Protestantism, however, freed many European Christians from Rome&#x27;s dictates against usury. In the late 18th century, Protestant merchant families began to move into banking to an increasing degree, especially in trading countries such as the United Kingdom (Barings), Germany (Schroders, Berenbergs) and the Netherlands (Hope &amp; Co., Gülcher &amp; Mulder) At the same time, new types of financial activities broadened the scope of banking far beyond its origins. The merchant-banking families dealt in everything from underwriting bonds to originating foreign loans. For instance, bullion trading and bond issuance were two of the specialties of the Rothschilds. In 1803, Barings teamed with Hope &amp; Co. to facilitate the Louisiana Purchase.

In the 19th century, the rise of trade and industry in the US led to powerful new private merchant banks, culminating in J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. During the 20th century, however, the financial world began to outgrow the resources of family-owned and other forms of private-equity banking. Corporations came to dominate the banking business. For the same reasons, merchant banking activities became just one area of interest for modern banks.

==Modern practices==
Known as &quot;accepting and issuing houses&quot; in the UK and &quot;investment banks&quot; in the US, modern merchant banks offer a wide range of activities, including Issue management, portfolio management, credit syndication, acceptance credit, counsel on mergers and acquisitions, and insurance. 

Of the two classes of merchant banks, the US variant initiates loans and then sells them to investors. These investors can be private investment firms. Even though some of these companies call themselves &quot;merchant banks&quot;, they have few, if any, of the characteristics of former merchant banks.

==Usage in the United States==

Today, according to the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), &quot;the term merchant banking is generally understood to mean negotiated private equity investment by financial institutions in the unregistered securities of either privately or publicly held companies.&quot; Both commercial banks and investment banks may engage in merchant banking activities.

In 2016, the Federal Reserve proposed a ban on merchant banking as part of a “take no risk” regulation strategy.

<text>Hanns Johst (8 July 1890 – 23 November 1978) was a German poet and playwright, directly aligned with Nazi philosophy, as a member of the officially approved writers’ organisations in the Third Reich. The statement “When I hear the word culture, I reach for my gun”, variously misattributed to Heinrich Himmler, Joseph Goebbels and Hermann Göring, was in fact a corrupted version of a line in his play &quot;Schlageter&quot;.

==Background==
Hanns Johst was born in Seerhausen (now part of Stauchitz) in the Kingdom of Saxony as the son of an elementary school teacher. He grew up in Oschatz and Leipzig. As a juvenile he planned to become a missionary. When he was 17 years old he worked as an auxiliary in a Bethel Institution. In 1910 he earned his Abitur in Leipzig and then started studying medicine and philosophy and—later—history of art. He volunteered for the army in 1914. In 1918 he settled down in Allmannshausen (part of Berg) at the Starnberger See.

==Early work==
His early work is influenced by Expressionism. Examples include &quot;Der Anfang&quot; (&quot;The Beginning&quot;) (1917) and &quot;Der König&quot; (&quot;The King&quot;) (1920). Later, he turned to a naturalist philosophy in plays such as &quot;Wechsler und Händler&quot; (&quot;Money changers and Traders&quot;) (1923) and &quot;Thomas Paine&quot; (1927).

Bertolt Brecht&#x27;s first play &quot;Baal&quot; was written in response to Johst&#x27;s play &quot;Der Einsame&quot; (&quot;The Lonely&quot;), a dramatization of the life of playwright Christian Dietrich Grabbe. In 1928 Johst joined Alfred Rosenberg&#x27;s &quot;Kampfbund für deutsche Kultur&quot; (Militant League for German Culture) designed to combat Jewish influence in German culture. In 1932 he joined the Nazi party, explaining his agreement with Hitler&#x27;s ideology in the essay &quot;Standpunkt und Fortschritt&quot; (&quot;Standpoint and Progress&quot;) in 1933.

==&quot;Schlageter&quot;==
When the Nazis achieved power in 1933, Johst wrote the play &quot;Schlageter&quot;, an expression of Nazi ideology which was performed on Hitler&#x27;s 44th birthday, 20 April 1933, to celebrate his victory. It was a heroic biography of the proto-Nazi martyr Albert Leo Schlageter. The famous line &quot;When I hear the word culture, I reach for my gun&quot;, often associated with Nazi leaders, derives from this play. The actual line in the play is, however, slightly different: &quot;Wenn ich Kultur höre … entsichere ich meinen Browning!&quot; &quot;When I hear &#x27;Culture&#x27;... I release the safety catch on my Browning!&quot; (Act 1, Scene 1). It is spoken by another character in conversation with the young Schlageter. In the scene Schlageter and his wartime comrade Friedrich Thiemann are studying for a college examination, but then start debating whether it is worthwhile doing so when the nation is not free. Thiemann argues that he would prefer to fight rather than study.

The line is frequently misattributed, sometimes to Hermann Göring and sometimes to Heinrich Himmler. In December 2007, historian David Starkey misattributed it to Joseph Goebbels in comments criticizing Queen Elizabeth II for being &quot;poorly educated and philistine&quot;. It has also been adapted by, for example Stephen Hawking as &quot;When I hear of Schrödinger&#x27;s cat, I reach for my pistol&quot; and by filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard in his 1963 film &quot;Le Mépris&quot;, when a producer says to Fritz Lang: &quot;Whenever I hear the word culture, I bring out my checkbook.&quot; Lang evokes the original line when he answers &quot;Some years ago—some horrible years ago—the Nazis used to take out a pistol instead of a checkbook.&quot; Songwriter Clint Conley of Mission of Burma titled a song he wrote in 1981 &quot;That&#x27;s When I Reach for My Revolver&quot;.
In 1994, Tuli Kupferberg wrote the book &quot;When I Hear the Word &#x27;Culture&#x27; I Reach for My Gun&quot;. In 2008 he wrote a book, &quot;Cartoons Collages and Perverbs&quot; [sic] with a cartoon in it reading &quot;WHEN I HEAR THE WORD &#x27;GUN&#x27; I REACH FOR MY CULTURE&quot;.

==Role in Nazi Germany==

On 1 November 1932, Johst joined the Nazi Party (membership number 1,352,376). In 1933, Johst signed the &quot;Gelöbnis treuester Gefolgschaft&quot;, a declaration of loyalty to Hitler by pro-Nazi writers. Johst was named First Chairman of the &quot;Deutsche Akademie für Dichtung&quot; (German Academy for Poetry) on 9 June 1933, and on 15 January 1934, Prussian Minister President Hermann Göring appointed him a member of the Prussian State Council. Succeeding Hans-Friedrich Blunck in October 1935, Johst became the President of the &quot;Reichsschrifttumskammer&quot; (Reich Writers Chamber) a powerful organisation for German writers. In the same year, the last prominent Jewish writers, e.g. Martin Buber, were expelled from the &quot;Reichsschrifttumskammer&quot;. By this time these organisations restricted membership to writers whose work was either explicitly pro-Nazi or at least approved of by the Nazis as non-degenerate. Johst achieved other positions of importance within the Nazi state, and he was named in the Gottbegnadeten list of September 1944 as one of the Reich&#x27;s most important artists. He joined the &quot;Allgemeine-SS&quot; on 9 November 1935 (SS member number 274,576) and rose to the rank of SS-&quot;Gruppenführer&quot; on 30 January 1942. During the war he held various positions within the SS, including on the personal staff of &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot; Heinrich Himmler, which Thomas Mann stated was the reason that several charges of pedophilia and abuse of children were dropped against Johst in the winter of 1944.

==Quotations==


==Post-war==
After the war Johst was interned, and on 7 July 1949 a Munich denazification tribunal classified him as a &quot;fellow traveler&quot;. An appeal process ended in 1949 with his reclassification as a &quot;main culprit&quot; and a three-and-a-half-year labor camp sentence (the time Johst had already served). After his release from prison and further denazification proceedings in 1951, he was classified as “incriminated”. In 1955, Johst obtained an overturning of this decision and the termination of the proceedings at the public expense. He was thus effectively rehabilitated.

In the Soviet Occupation Zone, many of his works were placed on the banned books list, with the exception of &quot;Der Anfang. Roman&quot; (1917), &quot;Der Ausländer&quot; (1916), &quot;Ave Eva&quot; (1932), &quot;Lieder der Sehnsucht. Gedichte&quot; (1924), &quot;Der junge Mensch. Szenarium&quot; (1916), &quot;Mutter. Gedichte&quot; (1921), &quot;Mutter ohne Tod. Begegnung&quot; (1933), &quot;Stroh&quot; (1916), &quot;Die Stunde der Sterbenden&quot; (1914), &quot;Torheit einer Liebe. Roman&quot; (1931) and &quot;Wegwärts. Gedichte&quot; (1916).

In the Federal Republic of Germany, Johst could no longer gain publication as a writer but, after 1952, he wrote poems under the pseudonym &quot;Odemar Oderich&quot; for the Edeka supermarkets customer magazine, &quot;Die kluge Hausfrau&quot;. Johst attempted to publish a book in 1953, which he had completed and revised at the end of 1943, but failed to find a publisher. He died on 23 November 1978 in an old people&#x27;s home in Ruhpolding.

<text>PiHKAL: A Chemical Love Story is a book by Alexander Shulgin and Ann Shulgin published in 1991. The subject of the work is psychoactive phenethylamine chemical derivatives, notably those that act as psychedelics and/or empathogen-entactogens. The main title, PiHKAL, is an acronym that stands for &quot;Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved&quot;.

The book is arranged into two parts, the first part being a fictionalized autobiography of the couple and the second part describing 179 different psychedelic compounds (most of which Shulgin discovered himself), including detailed synthesis instructions, bioassays, dosages, and other commentary.

The second part was made freely available by Shulgin on Erowid while the first part is available only in the printed text. While the reactions described are beyond the ability of people with a basic chemistry education, some tend to emphasize techniques that do not require difficult-to-obtain chemicals. Notable among these are the use of mercury-aluminium amalgam (an unusual but easy to obtain reagent) as a reducing agent and detailed suggestions on legal plant sources of important drug precursors such as safrole.

== Impact and popularity ==
Through &quot;PIHKAL&quot; (and later &quot;TIHKAL&quot;), Shulgin sought to ensure that his discoveries would escape the limits of professional research labs and find their way to the public, a goal consistent with his stated beliefs that psychedelic drugs can be valuable tools for self-exploration. The MDMA (&quot;ecstasy&quot;) synthesis published in &quot;PIHKAL&quot; remains one of the most common clandestine methods of its manufacture to this day. Many countries have banned the major substances for which this book gives directions for synthesis, such as 2C-B, 2C-T-2, and 2C-T-7.

In 1994, two years after &quot;PIHKAL&quot; was published, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) raided Shulgin&#x27;s laboratory and requested that he surrender his DEA license. Richard Meyer, spokesman for DEA&#x27;s San Francisco Field Division, has stated in reference to &quot;PIHKAL&quot; &quot;It is our opinion that those books are pretty much cookbooks on how to make illegal drugs. Agents tell me that in clandestine labs that they have raided, they have found copies of those books&quot;, suggesting that the publication of &quot;PIHKAL&quot; and the termination of Shulgin&#x27;s license may have been related.

== Notable compounds ==
=== Essential amphetamines === 

The &quot;Essential Amphetamines&quot; are what Shulgin describes as ten amphetamines that differ from natural products such as safrole or myristicin by an amine group (&quot;PIHKAL&quot; Entry #157 TMA). The list consists of:
* PMA (&quot;para&quot;-methoxy-amphetamine)
* 2,4-DMA (2,4-dimethoxy-amphetamine)
* 3,4-DMA (3,4-dimethoxy-amphetamine)
* MDA (3,4-methylenedioxy-amphetamine)
* MMDA (3-methoxy-4,5-methylendioxy-amphetamine)
* MMDA-3a (2-methoxy-3,4-methylendioxyamphetamine)
* MMDA-2 (2-methoxy-4,5-methylendioxyamphetamine)
* TMA (3,4,5-trimethoxyamphetamine)
* TMA-2 (2,4,5-trimethoxyamphetamine)
* DMMDA (2,5-dimethoxy-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine)
* DMMDA-2 (2,3-dimethoxy-4,5-methylenedioxyamphetamine)
* TeMA (2,3,4,5-tetramethoxyamphetamine)

Not all of these chemicals are bioassayed in &quot;PIHKAL&quot;; some are merely mentioned.

=== Magical half-dozen ===

The so-called &quot;magical half-dozen&quot; refers to Shulgin&#x27;s self-rated most important phenethylamine compounds, all of which except mescaline he developed and synthesized himself. They are found within the first book of &quot;PIHKAL&quot;, and are as follows:
* 2C-B (2,5-dimethoxy-4-bromophenethylamine)
* 2C-E (2,5-dimethoxy-4-ethylphenethylamine)
* 2C-T-2 (2,5-dimethoxy-4-ethylthiophenethylamine)
* 2C-T-7 (2,5-dimethoxy-4-propylthiophenethylamine)
* DOM (2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine), DOM being short for desoxy methyl, referring to the removal of the oxygen atom from the methoxy group on the &quot;4&quot; carbon.
* Mescaline (3,4,5-trimethoxyphenethylamine)

All six are now Schedule I controlled substances in the United States.

<text>James Nachtwey (born March 14, 1948) is an American photojournalist and war photographer.

He has been awarded the Overseas Press Club&#x27;s Robert Capa Gold Medal five times and two World Press Photo awards. In 2003, Nachtwey was injured in a grenade attack on his convoy while working in Baghdad, from which he made a full recovery.

Nachtwey has worked with &quot;Time&quot; as a contract photographer since 1984. He worked for Black Star (1980–1985), was a member of Magnum Photos (1986–2001) and VII Photo Agency (2001–2011) where he was a founding member.

== Life and work ==
Nachtwey grew up in Massachusetts and graduated from Dartmouth College, where he studied art history and political science (1966–70).

He started working as a newspaper photographer in 1976 at the &quot;Albuquerque Journal&quot;. In 1980, he moved to New York City and began working as a freelance photographer. In 1981, he covered his first assignment in Northern Ireland illustrating civil strife. He has documented a variety of armed conflicts and social issues, spending time in South Africa, Latin America, the Middle East, Russia, Eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union shooting pictures of war, conflict and images of socio-political issues in Western Europe and the United States. He is not married and currently lives in New York City.

In 1994, Nachtwey was covering the upcoming elections in South Africa, the first non-racial ones in decades. As an associate of the Bang-Bang Club, he was at the scene when Ken Oosterbroek was killed and Greg Marinovich was seriously injured.

Nachtwey had been injured previously in his work, but it was during his extensive coverage of the United States invasion of Iraq that he received his first combat injury. As Nachtwey and &quot;Time&quot; correspondent Michael Weisskopf rode in the back of a Humvee with the United States Army &quot;Tomb Raiders&quot; Survey Platoon, an insurgent threw a grenade into the vehicle. Weisskopf grabbed the grenade to throw it out of the humvee: two soldiers were injured in the explosion, along with the &quot;Time&quot; journalists. Nachtwey managed to take several photographs of medic Billie Grimes treating Weisskopf before passing out. Both journalists were airlifted to Germany and later to hospitals in the United States. Nachtwey recovered sufficiently to return overseas to cover the tsunami in Southeast Asia of December 2004.

Nachtwey has worked with &quot;Time&quot; as a contract photographer since 1984. He worked for Black Star from 1980 until 1985 and was a member of Magnum Photos from 1986 until 2001. In 2001, he was a founding member of the VII Photo Agency (he resigned from VII in July 2011).

Nachtwey was present during the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center, and produced a well known related body of work. He also compiled a photo essay on the effects of the Sudan conflict on civilians.

In 2001, the documentary &quot;War Photographer&quot; was released, focusing on Nachtwey and his work. Directed by Christian Frei, the film received an Academy Award nomination for best documentary film.

On February 1, 2014, Nachtwey was grazed by a bullet while photographing political protests in Thailand.

Nachtwey is one of three winners of the 2007 TED Prize. Each recipient was granted $100,000 and one &quot;world-changing wish&quot; to be revealed at the 2007 TED conference, in Monterey, California. Many members of the TED Community, and a group of world-class companies, have pledged support to help fulfill the wishes. Nachtwey&#x27;s wish, revealed March 8, 2007, is this: &quot;There&#x27;s a vital story that needs to be told, and I wish for TED to help me gain access to it and then to help me come up with innovative and exciting ways to use news photography in the digital era.&quot; Those who wish to help him will sign a Non-disclosure agreement (NDA) and help him &quot;gain access to a place in the world where a critical situation is occurring and fully document it with photography; set a date to unveil the pictures and find a series of innovative ways to create powerful impact with them, using novel display technologies and the power of the Internet as well as media; and use the campaign to generate resources for organizations that are working to address and transform the situation.&quot; Early results of this work have been unveiled at XDRTB.org to document extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis throughout the world.

<doc id="309973" wikidata="Q1662148" url="?curid=309973" title="Lift-induced drag">
<text>Lift-induced drag, induced drag, vortex drag, or sometimes drag due to lift, in aerodynamics, is an aerodynamic drag force that occurs whenever a moving object redirects the airflow coming at it. This drag force occurs in airplanes due to wings or a lifting body redirecting air to cause lift and also in cars with airfoil wings that redirect air to cause a downforce. It is symbolized as formula_1, and the lift-induced drag coefficient as formula_2.

For a constant amount of lift, induced drag can be reduced by increasing airspeed. A counter-intuitive effect of this is that, up to the speed-for-minimum-drag, aircraft need less power to fly faster. Induced drag is also reduced when the wingspan is higher, or for wings with wingtip devices.

==Explanation==
The total aerodynamic force acting on a body is usually thought of as having two components, lift and drag. By definition, the component of force parallel to the oncoming flow is called drag; and the component perpendicular to the oncoming flow is called lift. At practical angles of attack the lift greatly exceeds the drag.

Lift is produced by the changing direction of the flow around a wing. The change of direction results in a change of velocity (even if there is no speed change), which is an acceleration. To change the direction of the flow therefore requires that a force be applied to the fluid; the total aerodynamic force is simply the reaction force of the fluid acting on the wing.

An aircraft in slow flight at a high angle of attack will generate an aerodynamic reaction force with a high drag component. By increasing the speed and reducing the angle of attack, the lift generated can be held constant while the drag component is reduced. At the optimum angle of attack, total drag is minimised. If speed is increased beyond this, total drag will increase again due to increased profile drag.

==Vortices==
When producing lift, air below the wing is at a higher pressure than the air pressure above the wing. On a wing of finite span, this pressure difference causes air to flow from the lower surface, around the wingtip, towards the upper surface. This spanwise flow of air combines with chordwise flowing air, which twists the airflow and produces vortices along the wing trailing edge.

The vortices reduce the wing&#x27;s ability to generate lift, so that it requires a higher angle of attack for the same lift, which tilts the total aerodynamic force rearwards and increases the drag component of that force. The angular deflection is small and has little effect on the lift. However, there is an increase in the drag equal to the product of the lift force and the angle through which it is deflected. Since the deflection is itself a function of the lift, the additional drag is proportional to the square of the lift.

The vortices created are unstable, and they quickly combine to produce wingtip vortices which trail behind the wingtip.

==Calculation of induced drag==
For a &quot;planar&quot; wing with an elliptical lift distribution, induced drag Di can be calculated as follows:

:formula_3,
where
:formula_4 is the lift,
:formula_5 is the standard density of air at sea level,
:formula_6 is the equivalent airspeed, 
:formula_7 is the ratio of circumference to diameter of a circle, and
:formula_8 is the wingspan.
From this equation it is clear that the induced drag varies with the square of the lift; and inversely with the square of the equivalent airspeed; and inversely with the square of the wingspan. Deviation from the non-planar wing with elliptical lift distribution are taken into account by dividing the induced drag by the span efficiency factor formula_9.

To compare with other sources of drag, it can be convenient to express this equation in terms of lift and drag coefficients:

:formula_10, where
:formula_11
and
:formula_12 is the aspect ratio,
:formula_13 is a reference wing area,
:formula_14 is the span efficiency factor.
This indicates how, for a given wing area, high aspect ratio wings are beneficial to flight efficiency. With formula_15 being a function of angle of attack, induced drag increases as the angle of attack increases.

The above equation can be derived using Prandtl&#x27;s lifting-line theory. Similar methods can also be used to compute the minimum induced drag for non-planar wings or for arbitrary lift distributions.

==Reducing induced drag==
According to the equations above, for wings generating the same lift, the induced drag is inversely proportional to the square of the wingspan. A wing of infinite span and uniform airfoil segment (or a 2D wing) would experience no induced drag. The drag characteristics of a wing with infinite span can be simulated using an airfoil segment the width of a wind tunnel.

An increase in wingspan or a solution with a similar effect is one way to reduce induced drag. The Wright brothers used curved trailing edges on their rectangular wings. Some early aircraft had fins mounted on the tips. More recent aircraft have wingtip-mounted winglets to reduce the induced drag. Winglets also provide some benefit by increasing the vertical height of the wing system. Wingtip mounted fuel tanks and wing washout may also provide some benefit.

Typically, the elliptical spanwise distribution of lift produces the minimum induced drag for a planar wing of a given span. A small number of aircraft have a planform approaching the elliptical — the most famous examples being the World War II Spitfire and Thunderbolt. For modern wings with winglets, the ideal lift distribution is not elliptical.

For a given wing area, a high aspect ratio wing will produce less induced drag than a wing of low aspect ratio. While induced drag is inversely proportional to the square of the wingspan, not necessarily inversely proportional to aspect ratio, &quot;if&quot; the wing area is held constant, then induced drag will be inversely proportional to aspect ratio. However, since wingspan can be increased while decreasing aspect ratio, or vice versa, the apparent relationship between aspect ratio and induced drag does not always hold.

For a typical twin-engine wide-body aircraft at cruise speed, induced drag is the second-largest component of total drag, accounting for approximately 37% of total drag. Skin friction drag is the largest component of total drag, at almost 48%. Reducing induced drag can therefore significantly reduce cost and environmental impact.

==Combined effect with other drag sources==
In 1891, Samuel Langley published the results of his experiments on various flat plates. At the same airspeed and the same angle of attack, plates with higher aspect ratio produced greater lift and experienced lower drag than those with lower aspect ratio.

His experiments were carried out at relatively low airspeeds, slower than the speed for minimum drag. He observed that, at these low airspeeds, increasing speed required reducing power. (At higher airspeeds, parasitic drag came to dominate, causing the power required to increase with increasing airspeed.)

Induced drag must be added to the parasitic drag to find the total drag. Since induced drag is inversely proportional to the square of the airspeed (at a given lift) whereas parasitic drag is proportional to the square of the airspeed, the combined overall drag curve shows a minimum at some airspeed - the minimum drag speed (VMD). An aircraft flying at this speed is operating at its optimal aerodynamic efficiency. According to the above equations, the speed for minimum drag occurs at the speed where the induced drag is equal to the parasitic drag. This is the speed at which for unpowered aircraft, optimum glide angle is achieved. This is also the speed for greatest range (although VMD will decrease as the plane consumes fuel and becomes lighter). The speed for greatest range (i.e. distance travelled) is the speed at which a straight line from the origin is tangent to the fuel flow rate curve.

The curve of range versus airspeed is normally very shallow and it is customary to operate at the speed for 99% best range since this gives 3-5% greater speed for only 1% less range. Flying higher where the air is thinner will raise the speed at which minimum drag occurs, and so permits a faster voyage for the same amount of fuel. If the plane is flying at the maximum permissible speed, then there is an altitude at which the air density will be sufficient to keep it aloft while flying at the angle of attack that minimizes the drag. The optimum altitude will increase during the flight as the plane becomes lighter.

The speed for maximum endurance (i.e. time in the air) is the speed for minimum fuel flow rate, and is always less than the speed for greatest range. The fuel flow rate is calculated as the product of the power required and the engine specific fuel consumption (fuel flow rate per unit of power). The power required is equal to the drag times the speed.

<text>The Rodrigues day gecko (Phelsuma edwardnewtoni), also known commonly as the Rodrigues blue-dotted day gecko, is an extinct species of day gecko, a lizard in the family Gekkonidae. The species was endemic to the island of Rodrigues, where it typically inhabited forests and dwelt in trees. The Rodrigues day gecko fed on insects and nectar.

==Taxonomy==
The Rodrigues day gecko was originally described as &quot;Phelsuma newtoni&quot; by Boulenger in 1884, also spelt &quot;Phelsuma newtonii&quot; by Boulenger in 1885. However, because this scientific name was also used as a synonym for &quot;Phelsuma gigas&quot;, Vinson &amp; Vinson changed the specific name to &quot;edwardnewtoni&quot; in 1969.

The specific name, &quot;edwardnewtoni&quot;, is in honor of British colonial administrator and ornithologist Edward Newton.

==Description==
&quot;P. edwardnewtoni&quot; was one of the largest day geckos. It reached a total length (including tail) of about . Earlier investigators describe the animal as being quite common. However, this species has not been sighted since 1917, in spite of thorough searches in the 1960s and 1970s on Rodrigues and all offshore islets. Today, only six preserved specimens remain, which are in The Natural History Museum in London and the Paris Natural History Museum. These specimens have been preserved in alcohol and show a thick-bodied, robust &quot;Phelsuma&quot;. The body colour in life has been described as bright green with bright blue spots on the backside. The underside of the tail was whitish-yellow. The chin had a deep yellow colour.

==Behaviour and ecology==

The species &quot;P. edwardnewtoni&quot; inhabited Rodrigues Island and its surrounding islets. &quot;P. edwardnewtoni&quot; was observed on coconut trees and other palms. Its habitat has been largely destroyed by humans and introduced animals such as cats and rats, which may have been the main cause of its extinction.

This day gecko fed mainly on palm fruit, and various insects and other invertebrates associated with palm trees. It also liked to lick soft, sweet fruit, pollen and nectar.

&quot;P. edwardnewtoni&quot; was documented as being unafraid of humans. It was quite tame and would even eat fruit from one&#x27;s hand. Leguat described the behaviour as follows:
It can also be noted that the behavior of this species was most likely very similar to other island dwelling day geckos such as the Madagascar giant day gecko (&quot;Phelsuma grandis&quot;) and Standing&#x27;s day gecko (&quot;P. standingi)&quot; which share a very similar niche as this species.

<text>Special Force () is a 2003 first-person shooter produced by the Central Internet Bureau of Hezbollah, a Lebanese Islamist militant group. The game recreates battles from the South Lebanon conflict between Hezbollah and Israel, with the player assuming the role of a Hezbollah fighter tasked with defeating Israeli soldiers. Hezbollah conceived the game immediately after the conflict ended in 2000 and developed it with the company Hadeel over more than two years. &quot;Special Force&quot; was released in February 2003 in several Arab countries and sold 18,000 copies by September. Regarded as propaganda and a recruitment tool, the game was condemned by Jewish organisations and Israeli officials. It was cited as a role reversal of games like &quot;America&#x27;s Army&quot; and noted for its outdated technology. &quot;Special Force 2: Tale of the Truthful Pledge&quot;, a sequel based on the 2006 Lebanon War between the same sides, was released in August 2007 to limited success.

== Gameplay ==

&quot;Special Force&quot; is a first-person shooter set during the South Lebanon conflict fought between Israel and Hezbollah. The latter is a Lebanese Islamist militant group classified by some countries as a terrorist organisation. The game recreates several Hezbollah operations that occurred during the conflict, including their geographic locations, weather conditions, land mine arrangements, and number of combatants. The player takes the role of a Hezbollah fighter. At the start of each mission, the narrative is furthered through a text briefing. There are three missions, consisting mostly of street clashes. In combat, the player uses a knife, a pistol, Kalashnikov rifles, and hand grenades against Israeli soldiers and their Merkava tanks and Boeing AH-64 Apache helicopters.

In the training mode, the player practices shooting at posters of prominent Israeli political and military figures (including the prime minister Ariel Sharon, defence minister Shaul Mofaz, and former prime minister Ehud Barak) to obtain points. Upon completing the game, the player is virtually awarded a medal and a certificate from Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, as well as shown some Hezbollah fighters, described as martyrs, that were killed during the conflict. The game is playable in Arabic, English, French, and Farsi.

== Development and release ==
&quot;Special Force&quot; was produced by Hezbollah&#x27;s Central Internet Bureau. They conceived it immediately after the South Lebanon conflict ended in 2000, and the idea was greenlit by top Hezbollah officials. While the group had years of experience releasing software and maintaining websites, including media about the conflict, this project was their first video game. The game was developed by the Lebanese company Hadeel using Genesis3D, a free game engine. According to one Central Internet Bureau official, Mahmoud Rayya, it was designed to counter foreign video games that present Arabs as enemies to be defeated by American heroes. They used material from Hezbollah&#x27;s media archives, including films and maps, to recreate real combat scenarios. After more than two years of development, the game was released on 16 February 2003 in Lebanon, Syria, Iran, Bahrain, and the United Arab Emirates. It was distributed by the company Sunlight and marketed towards the domestic market and its diaspora.

== Reception ==
The first batch of 8,000 copies of &quot;Special Force&quot; sold out within one week. According to Kassem Ghaddar, the owner of Sunlight, the sales exceeded expectations. Foreign markets included Australia, Canada, Germany, and the United Kingdom. More than 18,000 copies had been sold by September 2003, of which 10,000 in Lebanon and around 1,000 in Europe and Australia. Over 200 were sold in the United Kingdom. By October 2014, the game remained available only by phone order in some Arab countries.

Lebanese children interviewed by several media outlets expressed their affection for the game as it allowed them to kill Israelis, something they could not do in real life. Alexander R. Galloway, an assistant professor at New York University, regarded the game as &quot;among the first truly realist games in existence&quot; for mirroring &quot;the everyday struggles of the downtrodden, leading to a direct criticism of current social policy&quot;. He believed the game represented a role reversal of games like &quot;America&#x27;s Army&quot;, putting an Arab into the protagonist position rather than an enemy role. According to Galloway, the game featured no strong narrative message in its gameplay, apart from occasional pro-intifada and anti-Israeli iconography. However, unlike the similarly themed game &quot;Under Ash&quot;, he felt the game had no educational tone and resorted solely to violence. From a technical standpoint, the &quot;Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung&quot; noted the game could not compete with Western releases, lagging behind by roughly two years, and had compatibility issues on newer versions of Windows.

&quot;Special Force&quot; was condemned by Jewish organisations like the Board of Deputies of British Jews. Ron Prosor, a spokesman for the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs, called it &quot;part of an educational process which is preventing any chance of real peace&quot; between Israel and Lebanon. The Australian politician Michael Danby considered it dehumanising, while Eclipse Entertainment, the developer of Genesis3D, distanced itself from the game. &quot;The New York Times&quot; characterised &quot;Special Force&quot; as part of Hezbollah&#x27;s propaganda efforts in Lebanese media to establish itself as a popular entity. The &quot;Sunday Herald&quot; said it was a recruitment tool aiming to entice young players to join the group. According to the &quot;Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung&quot;, it could particularly affect youths who regularly experience such violence and could identify with the player character. Starting in December 2006, the Israeli Center for Digital Art in Holon displayed the game as part of its &quot;Forbidden Games&quot; exhibition of ideological video games.

== Sequel ==
Following the 2006 Lebanon War fought between Hezbollah and Israel, Hezbollah re-created the conflict in the game sequel called &quot;Special Force 2: Tale of the Truthful Pledge&quot;. Developers of the original game formed a new studio, Might 3D, which made the game using an unlicensed version of CryEngine. The game features four levels with an expanded arsenal and resource management. Hezbollah released &quot;Special Force 2&quot; on 16 August 2007 and featured it in a local exhibit about the conflict. The group expected high demand both domestically and abroad, and the game saw several hundred pre-orders in Lebanon. The game attained &quot;limited fame&quot; in the country. &quot;Special Force 2&quot; was officially only released in Arabic, although an unofficial, free English version exists. The author of the English patch noted that it would be &quot;haram&quot; for someone to download the game without donating to Hezbollah or a local mosque.

<text>In digital circuits, a runt pulse is a narrow pulse that, 
due to non-zero rise and fall times of the signal, does not reach a valid 
high or low level. A runt pulse may occur when switching between 
 clocks; or as the result of a race condition in which a signal takes two separate paths through a circuit, which may have different delays, and is then recombined to form a glitch; or when the output of a flip-flop becomes metastable.

== Example ==
Some oscilloscopes provide a method for triggering on runt pulses. The oscilloscope triggers when the signal crosses one of two voltage thresholds, but not both.

<text>Tezpur () is a city in Sonitpur district, Assam state, India. Tezpur is located on the banks of the river Brahmaputra, northeast of Guwahati, and is the largest of the north bank cities.

== History ==
Tezpur was under the rule of the Koch dynasty and later became a part of the Ahom kingdom in the 16th century. The Ahoms, known for their administrative prowess and patronage of art and culture, played a vital role in shaping Tezpur&#x27;s heritage. The city witnessed several battles and conflicts during the medieval period.

Modern Tezpur is a medieval trading town and cultural and educational hub, home to several archaeological sites, temples, and monuments.

== Climate ==
The average high temperature in summer is around while the average winter low temperature is around .
== Demography ==

At the 2011 census, the population of the Tezpur city Municipal Corporation area was 102,505. Of these, 40,837 people spoke Assamese, 18,696 spoke Bengali, 11,050 spoke Hindi, and 31,920 spoke other languages.

== Tourism ==
Tezpur has several tourist attractions:
* Bhairabi Temple: The Bhairabi Temple is located on the outskirts of Tezpur. The Goddess Bhairavi is worshipped here as she is one of the Mahavidyas of Maa Durga Devi. It is a very important Shakta pitha of Assam. The backdrop of the temple is a view looking towards the Kolia Bhomora Setu across the Brahmaputra River. The temple site is also locally known &quot;Bhairabi Devalaya&quot;. Legend has it that Usha (daughter of mighty Asura King Banasura) regularly came here for the worshipping of the Goddess. 
* Mahabhairav Temple: An ancient Mahabhairav Temple is located north of the city of Tezpur. According to legend, it was established by King Bana and originally contained a Siva lingam. The temple was originally constructed of stone, but the current structure is made of concrete. The Ahom kings of the era donated land and appointed priests and attendants to maintain the temple.
* Agnigarh: This hillock located on the bank of the Brahmaputra river is said to be the site of the legendary romance between Princess Usha, the only daughter of King Banasura, and Aniruddha, the grandson of Lord Krishna. According to legend, Usha was kept on this hillock and was surrounded by fire, hence the name &quot;Agnigarh,&quot; which means &quot;hill of fire&quot; in Sanskrit.
* Rudrapada Temple: Located on the east side of Tezpur and on the bank of the Brahmaputra river, the Rudrapada Temple is believed to be the site where Rudra (Lord Shiva) left the print of his left foot on a stone. According to legend, Mahadeva revealed his true self to King Bana at this location. The temple was built in 1730 by Siva Singha, but the main temple was later destroyed due to erosion by the Brahmaputra river.
* Bamuni Hills: The Bamuni Hills contain ruins that feature sculptural remains dating back to the 9th and 10th centuries AD.
* Bhomoraguri: A stone inscription made by the Ahom General Kalia Bhomora Borphukan, who planned to construct a bridge over Brahmaputra. Almost two centuries later, a bridge at the same site now stands completed. The 3.015 km bridge, named after the great Ahom general, connects Silghat of Nagaon district with Tezpur.
* Trimurty Udyan: Located along Borpukhuri, this park is named after three important figures in Assamese culture: Rupkowar Jyoti Prasad Agarwalla, Kalaguru Bishnu Prasad Rabha, and Natasurjya Phani Sarmah.
* Chitralekha Udyan (Cole Park): Chitralekha Udyan is a park established in 1906 by British Deputy Commissioner Cole. It features two massive ornamented stone pillars and other sculptural remnants, and was renovated in 1996 by Deputy Commissioner M.G.V.K.Bhanu. The park has water sports facilities, walkways, a restaurant, and an open-air stage.
* Harjara Pukhuri: A large artificial lake named after Harjara Varmana of the Mleccha dynasty, excavated in the early 9th century.
* Padum Pukhuri: A lake featuring an island, that has been developed into a park with a musical fountain. The island is accessible via an iron bridge, and visitors can also go boating on the lake.

<text>Sweden Democratic Youth ( ; SDU) was the youth league of the Swedish political party Sweden Democrats until 12 September 2015.

== Background ==
The youth league was founded in 1993 as an independent youth league to its parent party. The original name was (Sweden Democrat&#x27;s Youth Association), but the organization was soon renamed (Sweden Democratic Youth). The youth league was disbanded in 1995 due to rampant problems with neo-Nazism in the ranks, but was reestablished as an independent organization in 1998 before becoming directly associated to the Sweden Democrats. Sweden Democrats leader Jimmie Åkesson served as chairman of the youth wing until 2005.

== Conflict with the Sweden Democrats ==
In 2015, the SDU was threatened with dissociation by the Sweden Democrats after some of its members had were said to have expressed racist statements and its leadership were accused of collaborating with extremist groups such as the neo-fascist Nordic Youth. SDU&#x27;s leader Gustav Kasselstrand, and its deputy leader William Hahne, were expelled from the party on 27 April 2015 due to this. They both denied the accusations of relations with extremist groups, and claimed that SD&#x27;s parliamentary group leader Mattias Karlsson wanted to remove them after Hahne defeated the mother party leadership&#x27;s preferred candidate for the SD chairmanship in Stockholm. Both Hahne and Kasselstrand had also supported Jessica Ohlson for the position of SDU chairperson. The Sweden Democrat leadership had considered Ohlson&#x27;s views too radical and disobedient towards the mother party and instead endorsed Tobias Andersson and Dennis Dioukarev&#x27;s campaigns for the position. Ohlson was subsequently elected leader of the SDU in 2015.

The Sweden Democrats subsequently announced that they would break ties with the youth league after an extended conflict with Ohlson&#x27;s supporters and multiple controversies surrounding SDU members. The party leadership issued a timetable for members of the youth wing to dissociate themselves with the SDU or risk expulsion from the Sweden Democrats while Ohlson announced she would lead the SDU as an independent youth league. The leading members of SDU would then go on to form the right-wing populist party Alternative for Sweden in March 2018.

On 1 October 2015, the Sweden Democrats founded a new youth league, Young Swedes SDU.

== Chairs of the SDU ==
* Jimmy Windeskog (1998–2000)
* Jimmie Åkesson (2000–05)
* Martin Kinnunen (2005–07)
* Erik Almqvist (2007–10)

<text>William Ronald Clark, known as Ronald William Clark (2 November 1916 – 9 March 1987) was a British author of biography, fiction and non-fiction.

==Early life and education==
Clark was born in London as William Ronald Clark, the only child of bank cashier, later manager, (William) Ernest Clark and Ethel Kate (née Underdown). He was educated King&#x27;s College School, at Wimbledon in southwest London; he withdrew from school before the age of eighteen &quot;in full rebellion against his parents&quot; and cut off contact with them, taking a publishing job in central London.

==Career==
Clark worked in publishing jobs of varied character whilst writing; he encountered no difficulties selling his articles almost from the start, and was encouraged in his writing by his employers. Clark served as a war correspondent during the Second World War after being turned down for military service on medical grounds. As a war correspondent, Clark landed on Juno Beach with the Canadians on D-Day. He followed the war until the end, and remained in Germany to report on the major War Crimes trials as a correspondent for the British United Press.

After returning to Britain he had a desk job with the B.U.P., where he remained until, in 1948, Clark resolved to earn a living through journalism and devote his best energies to the writing of his books. He wrote sixty-six books, covering subjects ranging from mountain climbing (over a dozen titles), the atomic bomb, Balmoral Castle, and world explorers, as well as novels of alternate history. He also wrote a number of biographies of a diverse range of historical figures, including: Charles Darwin, Thomas Edison, Albert Einstein, Benjamin Franklin, Sigmund Freud, J. B. S. Haldane, V. I. Lenin, Bertrand Russell, Ernst Chain, Edward Appleton and William F. Friedman. V. I. Lenin was Clark&#x27;s last biography and came out the year following his death.

==Personal life==
Clark was described by his friend John G. Slater of the University of Toronto as &quot;formidable as a person and as a personality... over six feet tall, with a well-developed paunch, bald head, and eyes that fixed upon you... not the sort of man you would hand your hat by mistake&quot;. In his later years, on a health regimen, he became quite thin, and by 1986, in ill health, &quot;a very feeble old man&quot; requiring support when walking.

After leaving school for his first job, and having joined an amateur theatrical group, Clark met Irené Tapp (1901-1977), fifteen years his senior. They married in 1938, but shortly after separated. After their divorce, Clark paid maintenance to her for thirty three years. In 1951, he met divorcée Pearla Doris Odden, nine years his senior, and after obtaining agreement for a divorce from his first wife, married Odden in 1953. She &quot;was involved in nearly all aspects of his book production&quot; and was co-author on two of them. They divorced in 1973 (although continuing their collaboration, with Pearla also compensating for Clark&#x27;s lack of domestic skills) in which year Clark married for the third time, to Elizabeth Allan Soutar, a younger Scottish woman from Elgin, Moray whom he had met as a guest at the home of friends in the country. She too contributed to her husband&#x27;s writing career with &quot;all the skills of an executive secretary&quot; and acting as a valuable researcher for Clark.

Clark died on 9 March 1987, having suffered a stroke after treatment for &quot;one of the severest cases of shingles his doctor had ever seen&quot;. He had in recent years also suffered from gout, which had taken a toll on his health.

<doc id="310005" wikidata="Q543281" url="?curid=310005" title="Glitch">
<text>A glitch is a short-lived technical fault, such as a transient one that corrects itself, making it difficult to troubleshoot. The term is particularly common in the computing and electronics industries, in circuit bending, as well as among players of video games. More generally, all types of systems including human organizations and nature experience glitches.

A glitch, which is slight and often temporary, differs from a more serious bug which is a genuine functionality-breaking problem. Alex Pieschel, writing for &quot;Arcade Review&quot;, said: bug&#x27; is often cast as the weightier and more blameworthy pejorative, while &#x27;glitch&#x27; suggests something more mysterious and unknowable inflicted by surprise inputs or stuff outside the realm of code&quot;. The word itself is sometimes humorously described as being short for &quot;gremlins lurking in the computer hardware&quot;.

==Etymology==
Some reference books, including &quot;Random House&#x27;s American Slang&quot;, claim that the term comes from the German word and the Yiddish word . Either way, it is a relatively new term. It was first widely defined for the American people by Bennett Cerf on the June 20, 1965, episode of &quot;What&#x27;s My Line&quot; as &quot;a kink ... when anything goes wrong down there [Cape Kennedy], they say there&#x27;s been a slight glitch&quot;. The astronaut John Glenn explained the term in his section of the book &quot;Into Orbit&quot;, writing that

Another term we adopted to describe some of our problems was &quot;glitch&quot;. Literally, a glitch is a spike or change in voltage in an electrical circuit which takes place when the circuit suddenly has a new load put on it. You have probably noticed a dimming of lights in your home when you turn a switch or start the dryer or the television set. Normally, these changes in voltage are protected by fuses. A glitch, however, is such a minute change in voltage that no fuse could protect against it.

John Daly further defined the word on the July 4, 1965, episode of &quot;What&#x27;s My Line&quot;, saying that it&#x27;s a term used by the Air Force at Cape Kennedy, in the process of launching rockets, &quot;it means something&#x27;s gone wrong and you can&#x27;t figure out what it is so you call it a &#x27;glitch&#x27;&quot;. Later, on July 23, 1965, &quot;Time&quot; magazine felt it necessary to define it in an article: &quot;Glitches—a spaceman&#x27;s word for irritating disturbances&quot;. In relation to the reference by &quot;Time&quot;, the term has been believed to enter common usage during the American Space Race of the 1950s, where it was used to describe minor faults in the rocket hardware that were difficult to pinpoint.
According to a Wall Street Journal article written by Ben Zimmer, The Yale law librarian Fred Shapiro came up with the new earliest use of the word yet found: May 19, 1940. That was when the novelist Katharine Brush wrote about &quot;glitch&quot; in her column &quot;Out of My Mind&quot; (syndicated in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, and other papers). Brush corroborated Tony Randall&#x27;s radio recollection:When the radio talkers make a little mistake in diction they call it a &quot;fluff,&quot; and when they make a bad one they call it a &quot;glitch,&quot; and I love it.Other examples from the world of radio can be found in the 1940s. The April 11, 1943, issue of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; carried a review of Helen Sioussat&#x27;s book about radio broadcasting, &quot;Mikes Don&#x27;t Bite&quot;. The reviewer noted an error and wrote, &quot;In the lingo of radio, has Miss Sioussat pulled a &#x27;muff,&#x27; &#x27;fluff,&#x27; &#x27;bust,&#x27; or &#x27;glitch&#x27;?&quot; And in a 1948 book called &quot;The Advertising and Business Side of Radio&quot;, Ned Midgley explained how a radio station&#x27;s &quot;traffic department&quot; was responsible for properly scheduling items in a broadcast. &quot;Usually most &#x27;glitches,&#x27; as on-the-air mistakes are called, can be traced to a mistake on the part of the traffic department&quot;, Midgley wrote.

In the 1950s, &quot;glitch&quot; made the transition from radio to television. In a 1953 ad in &quot;Broadcasting&quot; magazine, RCA boasted that their TV camera has &quot;no more a-c power line &#x27;glitches&#x27; (horizontal-bar interference)&quot;. And Bell Telephone ran an ad in a 1955 issue of &quot;Billboard&quot; showing two technicians monitoring the TV signals that were broadcast on Bell System lines: &quot;When he talks of &#x27;glitch&#x27; with a fellow technician, he means a low frequency interference which appears as a narrow horizontal bar moving vertically through the picture&quot;.

A 1959 article in &quot;Sponsor&quot;, a trade magazine for television and radio advertisers, gave another technical usage in an article about editing TV commercials by splicing tape. Glitch&#x27; is slang for the &#x27;momentary jiggle&#x27; that occurs at the editing point if the sync pulses don&#x27;t match exactly in the splice&quot;. It also provided one of the earliest etymologies of the word, noting that, Glitch&#x27; probably comes from a German or Yiddish word meaning a slide, a glide or a slip&quot;.

==Electronics glitch==
An electronics glitch or logic hazard is a transition that occurs on a signal before the signal settles to its intended value, particularly in a digital circuit. Generally, this implies an electrical pulse of short duration, often due to a race condition between two signals derived from a common source but with different delays. In some cases, such as a well-timed synchronous circuit, this could be a harmless and well-tolerated effect that occurs normally in a design. In other contexts, a glitch can represent an undesirable result of a fault or design error that can produce a malfunction. Some electronic components, such as flip-flops, are triggered by a pulse that must not be shorter than a specified minimum duration in order to function correctly; a pulse shorter than the specified minimum may be called a glitch. A related concept is the runt pulse, a pulse whose amplitude is smaller than the minimum level specified for correct operation, and a spike, a short pulse similar to a glitch but often caused by ringing or crosstalk.

==Computer glitch==
A computer glitch is the failure of a system, usually containing a computing device, to complete its functions or to perform them properly. It frequently refers to an error which is not detected at the time it occurs but shows up later in data errors or incorrect human decisions. Situations which are frequently called computer glitches are incorrectly written software (software bugs), incorrect instructions given by the operator (operator errors, and a failure to account for this possibility might also be considered a software bug), undetected invalid input data (this might also be considered a software bug), undetected communications errors, computer viruses, Trojan attacks and computer exploiting (sometimes called &quot;hacking&quot;).

Such glitches could produce problems such as keyboard malfunction, number key failures, screen abnormalities (turned left, right or upside-down), random program malfunctions, and abnormal program registering.

Examples of computer glitches causing disruption include an unexpected shutdown of a water filtration plant in New Canaan, 2010, failures in the Computer Aided Dispatch system used by the police in Austin, resulting in unresponded 911 calls, and an unexpected bit flip causing the Cassini spacecraft to enter &quot;safe mode&quot; in November 2010. Glitches can also be costly: in 2015, a bank was unable to raise interest rates for weeks resulting in losses of more than a million dollars per day.

==Video game glitches==

Glitches in video games may include graphical and sound errors, collision detection problems, game crashes, and other issues. Quality assurance (QA) testers are commonly employed throughout the development process to find and report glitches to the programmers to be fixed, then potentially start over with a new build of the game. If insufficient bug fixes are performed, numerous glitches and bugs can make their way to the final product. Bethesda Softworks, for example, is notorious for the amount of glitches in their games, though some players even prefer them to a glitch-free experience.

Some players may seek to induce glitches in a game for fun, using methods such as cartridge tilting to disrupt the data flow. 

&quot;Glitch hunters&quot; are fans of a game who search for beneficial glitches that will allow them to speedrun the game faster, usually by skipping portions of a level, or quickly defeating enemies. One example of a speedrunning scene with large amounts of glitch hunters is the &quot;Souls&quot; series. The use of glitches during speedruns is a controversial topic, with some frowning upon their use as subverting the intent of the developers. Those in favor of glitch use believe that using the glitches can in itself take a great deal of skill. Multiple categories of speedruns exist, with &quot;any%&quot; allowing the use of any type of glitch, while &quot;glitchless&quot; indicates the speedrun was performed without them.

Some games purposely include effects that look like glitches as a means to break the fourth wall and either scare the player or put the player at unease, or otherwise as part of the game&#x27;s narrative. Games like &quot;Eternal Darkness&quot; and &quot;&quot; include segments with intentional glitches where it appears that the player&#x27;s game system has failed. The Animus interface in the &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed&quot; series, which allows the player-character to experience the memories of an ancestor though their genetic heritage, includes occasional glitches as to enforce the idea that the game is what the player-character is witnessing through a computer-aided system.

==Television glitch==
In broadcasting, a corrupted signal may glitch in the form of jagged lines on the screen, misplaced squares, static looking effects, freezing problems, or inverted colors. The glitches may affect the video and/or audio (usually audio dropout) or the transmission. These glitches may be caused by a variety of issues, interference from portable electronics or microwaves, damaged cables at the broadcasting center, or weather.

==In popular culture==
Multiple works of popular culture deal with glitches; those with the word &quot;glitch&quot; or derivations thereof are detailed in Glitch (disambiguation).
*The nonfiction book &quot;CB Bible&quot; (1976) includes glitch in its glossary of citizens band radio slang, defining it as &quot;an indefinable technical defect in CB equipment&quot;, indicating the term was already then in use on citizens band. 
*The short film &quot;The Glitch&quot; (2008), opening film and best science fiction finalist at Dragon Con Independent Film Festival 2008, deals with the disorientation of late-night TV viewer Harry Owen (Scott Charles Blamphin), who experiences &quot;heavy brain-splitting digital breakdowns&quot;.

<doc id="310007" wikidata="Q885003" url="?curid=310007" title="Blond Ambition World Tour">
<text>The Blond Ambition World Tour (billed as Blond Ambition World Tour 90) was the third concert tour by American singer Madonna. It supported her fourth studio album &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; (1989), and the soundtrack album to the 1990 film &quot;Dick Tracy&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Breathless&quot;. The 57-show tour began on April 13, 1990, at the Chiba Marine Stadium in Chiba, Japan, and concluded on August 5 at the Stade Charles-Ehrmann in Nice, France. Additionally, it marked Madonna&#x27;s first concerts in Sweden and Spain. Originally planned as the Like a Prayer World Tour, it was supposed to be sponsored by soft drink manufacturer Pepsi. However, the company cancelled the contract following the controversy surrounding the music video of &quot;Like a Prayer&quot;.

The concert was divided into five thematic acts: &quot;Metropolis&quot;, inspired by the 1927 German Expressionist film of the same name and the &quot;Express Yourself&quot; music video; &quot;Religious&quot;, by Catholic themes; &quot;Dick Tracy&quot;, by the film of the same name and cabaret; &quot;Art Deco&quot;, inspired by early Hollywood movies and featuring paintings by Polish artist Tamara de Lempicka; and finally, an encore. The art direction was by Madonna&#x27;s brother Christopher Ciccone, while the costumes were created by French fashion designer Jean-Paul Gaultier. The tour garnered positive reviews from contemporary critics and was a commercial success. It received the &quot;Most Creative Stage Production&quot; award at the Pollstar Concert Industry Awards and grossed over US$62.7 million ($ million in dollars). Madonna was named the second most successful solo touring act at the time, behind Michael Jackson.

The tour generated controversy due to its use of Catholic imagery and sexual content. Pope John Paul II urged the general public and the Christian community not to attend the tour, calling it &quot;one of the most satanic shows in the history of humanity&quot;. The protests resulted in the cancelation of one Italian show. In Toronto, the police threatened to arrest Madonna over the performance of &quot;Like a Virgin&quot;, which featured her simulating masturbation. Nevertheless, Madonna continued the show unaltered.

A number of concerts were recorded and broadcast, including the tour&#x27;s final show in Nice, which aired as a special on HBO; afterwards it was released exclusively on LaserDisc under the title &quot;Blond Ambition World Tour Live&quot;. Directed by Alek Keshishian, &quot;&quot; (1991) was a documentary film chronicling the tour. Blond Ambition has been noted by critics and authors for its theatricality and fashion, which have left its mark on the work of subsequent pop acts.

== Background ==
In January 1989, Pepsi-Cola announced that they had signed a US$5 million deal with Madonna to feature her and her then upcoming single &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; in a television commercial. The deal also included Pepsi sponsorship of Madonna&#x27;s next concert tour, announced at the time as the Like a Prayer World Tour. Madonna wanted to use the commercial to launch the song globally before its actual release — the first time this had been done in the music industry. Pepsi also benefited from having their product associated with Madonna. Titled &quot;Make a Wish&quot;, the commercial had its premiere during the global telecast of the 31st Grammy Awards on February 22, 1989, with an estimated 250 million people around the world viewing it. The following day, Madonna released the music video for &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; on MTV. Featuring a church and Catholic images such as stigmata, Ku Klux Klan-style cross burning and the singer kissing a black saint. Religious groups worldwide, including the Holy See, immediately protested against, what they saw as, blasphemous use of Christian imagery and called for a boycott of Pepsi and PepsiCo&#x27;s subsidiaries. As a result, Pepsi withdrew the commercial and canceled Madonna&#x27;s sponsorship contract.

Sire Records officially announced the Blond Ambition World Tour on November 16, 1989; Madonna&#x27;s performance of the single &quot;Express Yourself&quot; at the MTV Video Music Awards was deemed a &quot;preview&quot;. She described the tour as &quot;much more theatrical than anything I&#x27;ve ever done [...] I know that I&#x27;m not the best singer and I know that I&#x27;m not the best dancer. But, I can fucking push people&#x27;s buttons and be as provocative as I want. This tour&#x27;s goal is to break useless taboos&quot;. The tour promoted Madonna&#x27;s fourth album &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; and the &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; soundtrack &quot;I&#x27;m Breathless&quot;.

== Development ==
=== Conception and rehearsals ===

According to author J. Randy Taraborrelli, Madonna had &quot;complete control over virtually every aspect of the tour&quot;. The singer&#x27;s brother Christopher Ciccone was selected as the tour&#x27;s art director. He wrote in his autobiography &quot;Life with My Sister Madonna&quot; that she called him and said, &quot;I&#x27;m going on tour, and of course I want you to dress me, but you think you ought to design the stage and art-direct the show as well&quot;. The tour&#x27;s troupe was made up of seven dancers, two backup singers and eight musicians. Vincent Paterson, who had worked with the singer on the Pepsi commercial and the &quot;Express Yourself&quot; music video, was appointed co-director and choreographer. Auditions for dancers took place in New York City and Los Angeles. An advertisement was put on &quot;Daily Variety&quot; magazine by choreographer Karole Armitage, it read: &quot;Open auditions for fierce male dancers who know the meaning of troop style, beat boy and vogue. Wimps and Wanna-Bes need not apply!&quot;. Luis Camacho and Jose Gutierez Xtravaganza, who had previously worked with Madonna on the video for her single &quot;Vogue&quot;, were the first to be selected. After sending a video tape to the singer, Madonna invited the pair to the Tracks nightclub for an informal audition. After his audition, dancer Carlton Wilborn was also asked by Madonna to meet her at a nightclub. He pointed out that she was &quot;looking for very confident people – the best of the best – so I was acutely aware of how I was presenting myself. When I made the cut, I knew it was a huge opportunity&quot;; he described the rehearsals as being &quot;like boot camp&quot;. The rest of the dancers selected were Oliver Crumes, Kevin Stea, Gabriel Trupin and Salim Gauwloos. Paterson stated that &quot;instead of just presenting songs, Madonna and I wanted to combine fashion, Broadway, rock and performance arts&quot;.

To allow greater movement while dancing and singing, she used a hands-free radio-frequency headset microphones, with the headset fastened over the ears or the top of the head, and the microphone capsule on a boom arm that extended to the mouth. Because of her prominent usage, the microphone design came to be known as the &quot;Madonna mic&quot;. Other personnel included Jai Winding as the music director, John Draper as the tour&#x27;s manager and Chris Lamb as the production manager. Rehearsals took place at the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, California.

=== Wardrobe and staging ===

For the wardrobe, the singer contacted French designer Jean Paul Gaultier; she was attracted to the designer&#x27;s &quot;irreverence and humor&quot; and sent him a handwritten letter asking him to design the tour&#x27;s costumes. Gaultier happily accepted. He was already an admirer of Madonna and expressed admiration for the fact that &quot;when she was not so famous, she made her clothes herself [...] the visible bra, the transparencies, the crucifixes as jewelry&quot;. Madonna and Gaultier took three months to finalize the details of the costumes; they first met at New York City&#x27;s Carlyle Hotel, with additional meetings taking place in Paris&#x27; Bofinger restaurant, Balajo Club, Zoopsie nightclub and Théâtre Equestre Zingaro. Gaultier remembers this period as one of intense stress, claiming to have gotten through &quot;350 aspirins and 1,500 sketches&quot; before the singer approved of his designs. Tour backup singer and dancer Niki Haris later recalled that &quot;with Madonna, it always comes down to clothes and shoes&quot;. The result were two corsets with conical-shaped cups, one was peach-colored and the other solid gold. Gaultier explained that the idea first came when, as a child, his grandmother took him to an exhibit where &quot;they had a corset on display. I loved the flesh color, the salmon satin, the lace. The gold conical bra was just an extension of that idea&quot;. Other costumes created included a pin-striped suit, a green and white striped vaudeville-style corset, a black mini-dress trimmed and stitched with a stuffed West African stork called the marabou, a black clergyman&#x27;s robe with a neon crucifix and a cage vest. To avoid any incidents, every piece was double sewn with elastic threads. For the Asian and North American legs of the tour, the singer wore a synthetic ponytail clip on extension, which was replaced by a curly hairstyle on the European leg.

Construction for the stage cost approximately US$2 million. The stage was 80 x 70 feet long and needed over a hundred crew members to mount it and 18 trucks to haul it around. The centerpiece was a huge hydraulic platform, in which Madonna ascended at the beginning of each concert. The show was split into different thematic sections, each one with its own specific settings, divided by a curtain going up and down. To come up with the designs of each section, Madonna and her brother studied fashion and architecture from the 1920s, 30s and 40s. It was the singer&#x27;s idea to incorporate the movie &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; onto the tour; &quot;it&#x27;s a great opportunity for me [...] Most people don&#x27;t associate me with movies. But I know I have a much bigger following than Warren does and a lot of my audience isn&#x27;t even aware of who he is&quot;, she recalled. The first section, which was inspired by &quot;Metropolis&quot; and the &quot;Express Yourself&quot; music video, featured several funnels billowing smoke, steel piping, cables hanging above and a flight of stairs in the middle. At the end of this section ends, the curtain drops to the floor and gives way to the second one, where the stage became a boudoir and featured the singer on a red velvet bed. The third section, which was church-themed, had a large arc of Corinthian columns and votive candles. Halfway through one of the performances, a large scrim depicting a stained glass window was lowered from the ceiling. The fourth act, which featured scenic elements inspired by Art Deco skyscrapers, had a grand semicircular double staircase in the middle and backdrops that were cutout reproductions of Tamara de Lempicka&#x27;s paintings. Props included a grand piano and a huge cross lit with purple and orange lights. Belgian electronic music band Technotronic was signed as the opening act.

== Concert synopsis ==
The show was separated into five different sections: &quot;Metropolis&quot;, &quot;Religious&quot;, &quot;Dick Tracy&quot;, &quot;Art Deco&quot;, and an encore. It began with &quot;Express Yourself&quot;, and included a lyrical sample from &quot;Everybody&quot; (1982) during the introduction. Seven bare-chested male dancers appeared from behind a steel structure and did a choreographed routine on the stage; towards the end Madonna appeared on a rising platform atop a flight of stairs. She was dressed in a pin-striped suit with holes cut in it, so that her brassiere poked out of them. Underneath she wore the Gaultier conical corset. Accompanied by Niki Haris and Donna De Lory, her two backup singers and dancers, Madonna did a straightforward vocal rendition of the track, and an elaborate choreography, which included voguing, and simulated masturbation. The next number, &quot;Open Your Heart&quot;, featured Madonna performing a choreographed routine with a chair while a muscular dancer watched her from afar. For &quot;Causing a Commotion&quot; the singer wore a colorful cycling jacket and wrestled Haris and De Lory. The final song of the act was &quot;Where&#x27;s the Party&quot;. Three male dancers did an elaborate choreography while Madonna left the stage for a costume change.

The &quot;Religious&quot; section began with a slow and sultry sitar-based version of &quot;Like a Virgin&quot;. Madonna was decked out in the gold Gaultier corset and simulated masturbating on top of a red velvet bed. She was flanked by two male dancers wearing tights and gold pointy bras. For &quot;Like a Prayer&quot;, Madonna wore a black robe and knelt down in the middle of the stage, which was surrounded by votive candles, while her dancers, who were dressed like priests and nuns, gyrated around her and uttered the phrase &quot;Oh my God&quot; several times. Next, she performed &quot;Live to Tell&quot; on a prie-dieu. Halfway through the song, she started singing &quot;Oh Father&quot; while Carlton Wilborn in a black frock played the role of a priest. An energetic performance of &quot;Papa Don&#x27;t Preach&quot; closed this section. &quot;Sooner or Later&quot; opened the &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; act. Madonna sat atop a grand piano and wore a cabaret-themed corset under a long black robe. For the energetic &quot;Hanky Panky&quot;, she was joined by Haris, De Lory and a dancer dressed as Dick Tracy. At the end of the performance, she would tell the audience: &quot;You all know the pleasures of a good spanking, don&#x27;t you? [...] When I hurt people, I feel better, you know what I mean?&quot;. &quot;Now I&#x27;m Following You&quot; closed the act; Madonna danced with the Dick Tracy dancer to a pre-recorded version of the song, while six other dancers in yellow trenchcoats did a kick line.

The &quot;Art Deco&quot; act began with &quot;Material Girl&quot;; performed in a strong midwestern accent, Madonna, Haris and De Lory sat beneath beauty parlor hair dryers and wore fluffy pink dresses with dollar signs underneath bathrobes. Towards the end of the performance, they would take fake dollar bills from inside their bosoms and throw them to the crowd. The next song performed was &quot;Cherish&quot;. It featured Madonna playing the harp and her male dancers dressed up as mermen. Madonna ended the section with &quot;Into the Groove&quot;, performed with leather-clad dancers, and &quot;Vogue&quot;. The latter featuring various cutouts of Tamara de Lempicka&#x27;s paintings as backdrops, with the singer and the dancers wearing black spandex and doing the original choreography from the music video. The first encore, &quot;Holiday&quot;, had Madonna dressed in a polka-dotted blouse with matching flounces at the bottom of white trousers. The tour&#x27;s final performance was &quot;Keep it Together&quot;; it featured lyrical samples of Sly and the Family Stone″s &quot;Family Affair&quot; (1971). It started with dancers appearing on the stage, with chairs on their back. Madonna came on dressed in an all-black ensemble involving a cage vest, skintight shorts, knee-pads and bowler hat. She started singing &quot;Family Affair&quot;, then midway through the song switched back to &quot;Keep It Together&quot;. During the mid-section of the song, her and the dancers performed a choreography with the chairs. At the end, all the musicians, dancers and collaborators came to say goodbye to Madonna and disappeared into a hole on the stage. The singer was left alone to finish with a repeat of her line &quot;Keep people together forever and ever&quot;.

== Critical reception ==

The tour received generally positive reviews from critics. In his book &quot;&quot;, J. Randy Taraborrelli wrote that, &quot;brazenly sexual dance numbers and religious imagery commingled in a fast-paced, tightly choreographed unforgettable extravaganza&quot;. Similar thoughts were shared by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Barry Waters. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said it highlighted &quot;just how deep Madonna&#x27;s repertoire has become over the years&quot;. From the same publication, Robert Hilburn opined that, &quot;Madonna&#x27;s Blond Ambition show comes equipped with enough high-concept, Broadway-like choreography and stage design to satisfy the most demanding stargazer in a crowd equally populated by style-conscious wanna-be&#x27;s and simply curious mainstream fans&quot;. &quot;The Pittsburgh Press&quot;″s Ron Miller called it &quot;big, glitzy and full of elaborate production numbers and costume changes&quot;. Also from &quot;The Pittsburgh Press&quot;, David Hinckley compared it to a &quot;flashy, high-energy Broadway production&quot;. In his review of the show on May 7, 1990, at Dallas&#x27; Reunion Arena, Tom Maurstad felt that, &quot;it wasn&#x27;t so much a concert as it was a musical extravaganza, with each song functioning more as its own production&quot;; however, he criticized the singer for mixing up Dallas with Houston when addressing the crowd. Peter Buckley, author of &quot;The Rough Guide to Rock&quot;, praised the production and said it was &quot;an imaginative take of the staging of a stadium gig&quot;. Montgomery Brower and Todd Gold, from &quot;People&quot;, called it a &quot;105-minute hullabaloo amazing for its breadth of controversy&quot;. For &quot;Gay Times&quot; magazine&#x27;s Scott Anderson, &quot;despite all that&#x27;s happening on the stage it still felt like a concert, and despite the precession of the choreography, it had a certain rawness to it, it felt playful and spontaneous&quot;. Richard Harrington from &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, hailed the tour as &quot;a roadshow version of the videos that have made her one of the world&#x27;s biggest stars&quot;.

&quot;Newsday&quot;″s Frank DeCaro noted that, &quot;in just over an hour and a half, [Madonna] juggles as many looks as she does a month&#x27;s worth of international magazine covers&quot;, concluding that, &quot;Blond Ambition is a night at the Roxy, the Pyramid and Studio 54 in its heyday, all rolled into one&quot;. From the same publication, John LeLand said that &quot;the advance word was that it was shocking and outrageous [...] But what brought most of the crowd together at Nassau Coliseum Monday night, was that we weren&#x27;t shocked. Amused, tickled, stimulated or diverted, maybe, but not shocked or outraged&quot;. Sujata Massey from &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; highlighted the &quot;passionate&quot; performances, Madonna&#x27;s outfits and the &quot;sexy&quot; chatter. Greg Kot from the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; felt that, &quot;though the music certainly offered a few shake-your-booty thrills, it was Madonna the performer, dancer, rogue philosopher and smart-mouthed comic who made the evening memorable&quot;. He praised the singer&#x27;s stage presence and pointed out the performance of &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; for being &quot;both seductive and hilarious&quot;. Kot concluded his review: &quot;nothing about this production was second-rate. Each of the evening&#x27;s 18 songs was expertly choreographed, and the lighting, staging and costuming were often spectacular&quot;. Writing for &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot;, Brian D. Johnson expressed that, &quot;[Madonna] performs with the ruthless, aerobic efficiency of a circus girl. As a singer, she has limited range. But she knows how to seduce a pop song [...] as she whips through her circus repertoire of poses, the show unfolds like a kaleidoscope of sexual decadence&quot;.

In a mixed review, Jon Pareles from &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;Madonna might be testing taboos, but she&#x27;s hardly breaking new ground in rock theatrics&quot;, also criticizing the use of lip sync; &quot;she would clearly rather lip-sync than risk a wrong note. It makes the concert airless and off-putting&quot;. Three years later, the same author said that, &quot;with Blond Ambition she was pop&#x27;s least flirtatious sex symbol&quot;, and deemed it &quot;proudly uningratiating&quot;. In his review of the show in Gothenburg, Luis Hidalgo from &quot;El País&quot; expressed that, &quot;the big question is knowing if Madonna sings live or not completely [...] The non-existence of natural gasping and agitated breaths reinforces this hypothesis, strongly denied by the organization&quot;. Author Lucy O&#x27;Brien was critical of the &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; act, calling it &quot;the least dynamic part of the show&quot;. Blond Ambition won the award for Most Creative Stage Production at the 1990 Pollstar Concert Industry Awards, and was also nominated in the Major Tour of the Year category.

== Commercial performance ==
The tour was attended by 800,000 people around the world, with initial reports of a US$19 million gross. The first three concerts at Japan&#x27;s Chiba Marine Stadium were attended by 35,000 people each, grossing US$4.5 million. All her Japanese concerts had sold out within days of the tickets going on sale, earning the star US$37 million just from the Japanese leg of her tour. In North America, 482,832 tickets were sold in the first two hours during the pre-sale, grossing US$14 million. The first four dates alone were reported to have grossed almost US$1.5 million. In Los Angeles, the tour set a record at the Memorial Sports Arena; tickets for the first three concerts were sold out in 45 minutes, and grossed US$456,720, becoming the highest grossing musical event of all time in the history of the arena. The proceeds of the last American date in New Jersey, over US$300,000, were donated to the nonprofit organization amfAR; the show was dedicated to Madonna&#x27;s friend Keith Haring who died of AIDS.

The tour proved to be successful in Europe as well. The single concert in Rome was attended by 30,000 people. In Spain, tickets went on sale on 11 June 1990; prices ranged from 1,200 to 4,000 pesetas. The single concert at Madrid&#x27;s Vicente Calderón Stadium attracted 50,000 fans, while in Vigo only 23,000 of the 40,000 tickets were sold. The single concert at Gothenburg&#x27;s Eriksberg Docks attracted 55,000 people, one of the biggest crowds for a concert in Gothenburg at the time. Upon completion, the tour was reported to have grossed a total of US$62.7 million ($ million in dollars) from 57 concerts. &quot;Billboard&quot; reported that a percentage of ticket proceeds would be donated to the charity organization Cities In Schools, a high school drop-out prevention program. Madonna was named the second most successful solo touring act of the time, behind only Michael Jackson.

== Controversies ==

The tour was subject to controversy due to its sexual and Catholic imagery. In Italy, a private association of Roman Catholics called for a boycott of the shows in Rome and Turin; Pope John Paul II urged the general public and the Christian community not to attend the concert, calling it &quot;one of the most satanic shows in the history of humanity&quot;. The Vatican&#x27;s newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Osservatore Romano&quot; deemed it &quot;sinful, blasphemous&quot; and &quot;a complete disgrace&quot;, while the &quot;Famiglia Domani&quot;, a private association of conservative Catholics, criticized its eroticism and called it &quot;shameful&quot;. Madonna held a press conference in Rome&#x27;s Leonardo da Vinci–Fiumicino Airport defending herself and the tour: &quot;I am Italian American and proud of it... The tour in no way hurts anybody&#x27;s sentiments. It&#x27;s for open minds and gets them to see sexuality in a different way. Their own and others [...] Like theater, [Blond Ambition] asks questions, provokes thought and takes you on an emotional journey, portraying good and bad, light and dark, joy and sorrow, redemption and salvation&quot;. Nonetheless, the protests had effect and a planned second show in the city&#x27;s Stadio Flaminio was canceled due to low ticket sales and a threatened general strike by labor unions. Roman newspaper &quot;Il Messaggero&quot; dismissed the controversy with a lukewarm review; &quot;A lot of noise over nothing&quot;, read the headline.

In Toronto, the tour&#x27;s explicit overtone also caused problems. During the first show at the city&#x27;s SkyDome on May 27, the crew received a visit from the local police who threatened to arrest the singer for &quot;lewd and indecent display&quot;, specifically the masturbation scene during the performance of &quot;Like a Virgin&quot;. However, according to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, no charges were made after the tour&#x27;s manager gave the police an ultimatum: &quot;Cancel the show, and you&#x27;ll have to tell 30,000 people why.&quot; The show was unaltered and Madonna began the concert by asking the crowd &quot;do you believe in artistic expression and freedom of speech?&quot;, and later issued a statement saying she was willing to be arrested to protect her freedom to &quot;express myself as an artist&quot;. Frank Bergen, a Toronto police officer at the time, recalled that the claims were led by a retired police officer and a crown attorney with a &quot;strong position&quot; against Madonna and the tour. He also said despite the police being depicted as &quot;real knobs&quot; on the &quot;&quot; documentary, he felt they weren&#x27;t acting that way. Kevin Stea, one of the dancers, said the troupe was willing to be arrested over the performance, calling it &quot;the most powerful moment I ever felt with Madonna. As a team we were all together&quot;.

== Broadcasts and recordings ==
The last concert in Nice, France, was recorded and broadcast on HBO as &quot;Live! Madonna: Blond Ambition World Tour 90&quot;. The rights to the special were bought by HBO for US$1 million, and was advertised as &quot;America&#x27;s No.1 female pop star in a live-by-satellite performance of one of the summer&#x27;s biggest pop music events&quot;. According to the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, it was not a pay-per-view special as the channel wanted to distinguish itself from its pay-TV rival, Showtime. The transmission gave HBO a record for the highest ratings ever for an original program at the time; around 4.5 million people tuned in. It was considered too racy for television, and during the concert Madonna told the cameras: &quot;You know what I have to say to America? Get a fucking sense of humor, okay?&quot;. Soon after, the concert was released exclusively on LaserDisc, entitled &quot;Blond Ambition World Tour Live&quot;; it earned Madonna her very first Grammy win for Best Long Form Music Video. One of the Yokohama dates was also recorded and released exclusively in Japan under the title &quot;Blond Ambition – Japan Tour 90&quot;. In addition to these releases, Spanish broadcaster TVE recorded the concert in Barcelona and aired it in 30 countries. &quot;L’Osservatore Romano&quot; felt the broadcast was a violation of &quot;good sense, good taste and decency&quot;. In England, BBC Radio 1 broadcast the full show from Wembley Stadium, which led to controversy over the profanity Madonna used live on air.

The documentary film which chronicled the tour, &quot;&quot; (known as &quot;In Bed with Madonna&quot; outside of North America), was directed by Alek Keshishian and released in theaters on May 10, 1991, grossing over US$15 million. The singer approached Keshishian about doing an HBO special on her and the tour; the director, who found the backstage scene to be &quot;a Fellini-esque dysfunctional family&quot;, persuaded the singer to do an actual film focused on that, with interspersed footage of some performances. It received generally positive reviews; Peter Travers from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote that &quot;you may not leave &quot;Truth or Dare&quot; loving Madonna, but you&#x27;ll respect her as a force of nature&quot;. In 2018, it was named by &quot;The Guardian&quot; as the greatest music documentary of all time, with Ryan Gilbey claiming that &quot;[Alek] Keshishian couldn&#x27;t have trained his cameras on Madonna at a better time&quot;. However, Madonna was nominated for a Razzie Award for Worst Actress for her role in the film. It was released on video by LIVE Entertainment on October 9, 1991. The 2016 documentary &quot;Strike a Pose&quot; chronicled the life of six of the dancers after the tour finished.

== Legacy ==
=== In the work of other artists ===
Blond Ambition has been noted for its theatricality and fashion, something uncommon for concerts at the time. Drew Mackie from &quot;People&quot;, said that, &quot;Blond Ambition changed the pop-culture landscape&quot;. The fact that the show was divided into different thematic acts represented, according to the author, &quot;not only a level of creative planning unusual for concerts at the time but also the sheer volume of material Madonna had to work with&quot;. Lucy O&#x27;Brien noted that the singer had previously explored &quot;conceptual musical theatre as concert&quot; on 1987&#x27;s Who&#x27;s That Girl World Tour, but it wasn&#x27;t until Blond Ambition that &quot;art, spectacle and dance &quot;really&quot; came together&quot;. Courtney E. Smith wrote in her book &quot;Record Collecting for Girls: Unleashing Your Inner Music Nerd, One Album at a Time&quot; that, &quot;[Blond Ambition] forever changed audience expectations for pop concerts. Even if you didn&#x27;t go, you&#x27;re probably familiar with that tour&quot;. Co-director/Choreographer Vincent Paterson recalled that Madonna&#x27;s goal was to &quot;break every rule we can. She wanted to make statements about sexuality, cross-sexuality and the church. And she did&quot;. Dancer Luis Camacho said that Madonna &quot;set the stage&quot; for concerts and shows that followed. Scott Anderson concluded that the Blond Ambition Tour changed the way artists present and perform in stadiums and arenas. According to Christopher Rosa from VH1, the tour solidified Madonna&#x27;s status as a &quot;cultural tour-de-force and groundbreaking pop artist&quot;. Gina Vivinetto from &quot;The Advocate&quot; named it Madonna&#x27;s best tour and wrote that, &quot;until [Blond Ambition] came along, we had no idea what a live concert could be&quot;. &quot;Spin&quot; deemed it the sixth greatest concert of the last 35 years. Ilana Kaplan wrote that it &quot;was more than just shock factor: It was meant to transform live pop music&quot;, and also that it helped Madonna &quot;reclaim her narrative and power as the tabloids (wrongfully) deemed her a villain&quot;. &quot;Idolator&quot;″s Mike Wass considered it the &quot;blueprint for modern concerts [...] The Queen of Pop really shook things up by giving choreography, costumes and production as much attention as the live vocals&quot;. Writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, professor Sarah Churchwell wrote that the tour allowed Madonna to &quot;catapult[ed] herself into megastardom, shaping the music industry&quot; and establishing herself as &quot;the mother of today’s multimedia concert extravaganzas&quot;.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; noted that Madonna had &quot;reinvented the pop megatour itself&quot;; in 2017, the magazine included Blond Ambition on their list of &quot;The 50 Greatest Concerts of the Last 50 Years&quot;. Similarly, &quot;Q&quot; magazine named it one of the &quot;10 Greatest Gigs of All Time&quot;; Sylvia Patterson explained that, &quot;in spring 1990, Madonna was not only the most regonisable woman on Earth, but the most gloriously dynamic pop force on the planet. [...] Blond Ambition, her third major tour, was acknowledged as the first-ever global pop tour to use Broadway theatre production values with sets and a narrative &#x27;arc&#x27;&quot;. On a similar note, &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Jon O&#x27;Brien commented that, &quot;no longer were audiences content to watch their pop idol simply play the hits. Elaborate production values and strong narrative arcs soon became just as integral to the superstar tour as the music itself&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Mark Beaumont wrote that it &quot;set a new bar for confrontational theatricality that only greater shock tactics could ever challenge&quot;. In 2022, Alim Kheraj from &quot;The Guardian&quot;, named the tour one of the 50 gigs that changed music, for &quot;altering the blueprint for modern pop shows with this combination of narrative, choreography, high production values and fashion. A taboo-busting exploration of sexuality and religion only solidified its legacy&quot;. Ramona Liera Schwichtenberg, Deidre Pribram, Dave Tetzlaff and Ron Scott, authors of &quot;The Madonna Connection: Representational Politics, Subcultural Identities, And Cultural Theory&quot;, wrote that the tour revealed the &quot;underlying contradictory tensions within dominant American culture vis-à-vis sexuality&quot;, and that it violated too many &quot;fragile, middle-class sexual codes and boundaries&quot;.

It has also left its mark on the work of subsequent pop acts; &quot;NME&quot;″s El Hunt wrote: &quot;Think of the whips and chains of Rihanna&#x27;s &#x27;S&amp;M&#x27;, Ariana Grande&#x27;s &#x27;Side to Side&#x27; and countless other pop greats who emerged post-Madonna, and traces of Blond Ambition linger in their every move&quot;. The music video for Lady Gaga&#x27;s 2010 single &quot;Alejandro&quot; was deemed a &quot;visual love letter&quot; to Madonna and the tour. Kylie Minogue&#x27;s 1991 Let&#x27;s Get to It Tour was criticized for its similarities to Blond Ambition and branded a &quot;parody&quot;. Further influence has been recognized by critics on Michael Jackson&#x27;s 1992–93 Dangerous World Tour, as well as on the live performances of Pink, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Miley Cyrus, Marilyn Manson, Nicki Minaj and Justin Bieber. In order to record the actors&#x27; expressions up close, filmmakers working on James Cameron&#x27;s &quot;Avatar&quot; (2009) had them wear black headsets with small square cameras positioned in front of their mouths ―similar to the microphones used by Madonna on the tour; producer Jon Landau explained that, &quot;if [Madonna] can be bouncing around with a microphone in her face and give a great performance [...] we thought, &#x27;Let’s replace that microphone with a video camera&#x27;&quot;.

=== In fashion and popular culture ===

The tour has also influenced the fashion world. In her book &quot;Fashion Details: 1,000 Ideas from Neckline to Waistline, Pockets to Pleats&quot;, Macarena San Martin called the Gaultier conical corset &quot;an emblematic symbol of fashion in the early 90s&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Gregory DelliCarpini Jr. stated that the corset &quot;redefined the female silhouette and moved many designers to add some edge to their undergarments&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s Nina Terrero said that Madonna &quot;birthed a major fashion moment&quot; when she performed on tour wearing the corset. For Harold Koda, the singer&#x27;s use of the corset, an undergarment, as outerwear suggested that &quot;an explicit control of one&#x27;s image might transform, or at least destabilize, the patriarchal relationships of voyeuristic male and sexually objectified female&quot;. For Adam Geczy and Vicki Karaminas, the conical corset over a male suit represented both the breasts and the phallus. They concluded that &quot;in the interval of a decade, she transmogrified from virgin to dominatrix to &quot;Übermensch&quot; [...] Until then, only Bowie had multi-morphed; Madonna was the first woman to do so&quot;. Rebecca Dana from &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; stated that the corset&#x27;s &quot;genius&quot; lied in its subversion of traditional femininity: &quot;Soft becomes hard; curvy becomes phallic; the engine of maternity transforms into a weapon—it&#x27;s a Freudian nightmare&quot;.
The conical corset has inspired and been recreated by many contemporary artists, including Lady Gaga, Katy Perry and Rihanna. In 2001, one of the corsets was sold at an auction for US$21,105. The corset was reinvented by Gaultier for Madonna&#x27;s 2012 MDNA Tour in a cage-like leather style; &quot;what I have done this time is a nod to the conical bra corset of the Blond Ambition tour but reinterpreted in 3-D, in patent leather on the outside with metallic leather on the inside. It&#x27;s all about masculine and feminine&quot;, the designer recalled. While reviewing the tour on its 30th anniversary, Liam Hess from &quot;Vogue&quot; wrote that the conical corset &quot;is so embedded within the canon of both pop music and fashion that it now requires little introduction&quot;, and that it represented a pop star in control. Hess concluded that its most lasting influence is that it allowed female pop performers &quot;to channel their sexuality through the outfits they choose to wear without shame, and on their own terms&quot;. The synthetic ponytail the singer wore during the Asian and American legs became a fashion trend among the youth, with &quot;People&quot; magazine reporting that many fans were showing up at the concerts with similar hairdos. One of the performances of the Celebration Tour (2023–2024) sees Madonna &quot;cuddled up&quot; in a red velvet bed with a dancer dressed in a Blond Ambition attire, with &quot;ponytail and everything&quot;, as noted by &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Joe Lynch.

Of the singer&#x27;s look with the corset and ponytail, Mark Elliott from website UDiscoverMusic expressed that, &quot;no other artist would ever inhabit an image so immortal from a live show&quot;. It is now considered one of Madonna&#x27;s most iconic looks. The look was then referenced by actress Stephanie Faracy in the 1993 film &quot;Hocus Pocus&quot;. On the fifth episode of the second season of American television series &quot;Pose&quot;, &quot;What Would Candy Do?&quot;, the characters Damon (Ryan Jamaal Swain) and Ricky (Dyllón Burnside) audition to be back-up dancers for the tour. While discussing the episode, &quot;W&quot; Magazine&#x27;s Brooke Marine argued that, &quot;as much as that tour is known for Madonna&#x27;s famous Jean-Paul Gaultier cone bra, it was her dancers who made the whole spectacle culturally relevant [...] If it weren’t for the queer men of color who danced on the tour, Blond Ambition would not have been as effective or as subversive&quot;. Mark Beaumont expressed that the main taboo Madonna broke with Blond Ambition was &quot;that of feminine sexuality as strength rather than titillation, as something owned by the artist not cashed in by the svengalis&quot;, while according to &quot;Vulture&quot;″s David Goldberg, &quot;&quot;everything&quot; Madonna can be traced down to this cultural convergence: fashion, religion, sex, spectacle, and, of course, controversy&quot;.

<doc id="310008" wikidata="Q212903" url="?curid=310008" title="Katabatic wind">
<text>A katabatic wind (named ) is a downslope wind caused by the flow of an elevated, high-density air mass into a lower-density air mass below under the force of gravity. The spelling catabatic is also used. Since air density is strongly dependent on temperature, the high-density air mass is usually cooler, and the katabatic winds are relatively cool or cold.

Examples of katabatic winds include the downslope valley and mountain breezes, the piteraq winds of Greenland, the Bora in the Adriatic, the Bohemian Wind or &quot;Böhmwind&quot; in the Ore Mountains, the Santa Ana winds in southern California, the oroshi in Japan, or &quot;the Barber&quot; in New Zealand.

Not all downslope winds are katabatic. For instance, winds such as the föhn and chinook are rain shadow winds where air driven upslope on the windward side of a mountain range drops its moisture and descends leeward drier and warmer. 

== Mechanism ==

A katabatic wind originates from the difference of density of two air masses located above a slope. This density difference usually comes from temperature difference, even if humidity may also play a role. Schematically katabatic winds can be divided into two types for which the mechanisms are slightly different: the katabatic winds due to radiative cooling (the most common) and the fall winds. 

In the first case, the slope surface cools down radiatively after sunset, which cools down the air near the slope. This cooler air layer then flows down in the valley. This type of katabatic is very often observed during the night in the mountains. The term katabatic actually often refer to this type of wind.

In contrast, fall wind do not come from radiative cooling of the air, but rather from the advection of a relatively cold air mass to the top of a slope. This cold air mass can come from the arrival of a cold front (see Bora), or from the advection of cool marine air by a sea-breeze.

== Impacts ==
Katabatic winds are for example found blowing out from the large and elevated ice sheets of Antarctica and Greenland. The buildup of high density cold air over the ice sheets and the elevation of the ice sheets brings into play enormous gravitational energy. Where these winds are concentrated into restricted areas in the coastal valleys, the winds blow well over hurricane force, reaching around . In Greenland these winds are called piteraq and are most intense whenever a low pressure area approaches the coast.

In a few regions of continental Antarctica the snow is scoured away by the force of the katabatic winds, leading to &quot;dry valleys&quot; (or &quot;Antarctic oases&quot;) such as the McMurdo Dry Valleys. Since the katabatic winds are descending, they tend to have a low relative humidity, which desiccates the region. Other regions may have a similar but lesser effect, leading to &quot;blue ice&quot; areas where the snow is removed and the surface ice sublimates, but is replenished by glacier flow from upstream.

In the Fuegian Archipelago (Tierra del Fuego) in South America as well as in Alaska in North America, a wind known as a williwaw is a particular danger to harboring vessels. Williwaws originate in the snow and ice fields of the coastal mountains, and they can be faster than .

In California, strong katabatic wind events have been responsible for the explosive growth of many wildfires, including the 2018 Camp Fire and the 2020 North Complex.

In Catalonia, the Marinada is a fall wind that relieves from the heat inhabitants of the Urgell region during summer.

<text>, &quot;provisionally designated&quot;: , is a kilometer-sized asteroid and synchronous binary system, classified as near-Earth object and potentially hazardous asteroid of the Apollo group. It became briefly notable upon its discovery in late August 2003, when media outlets played up a very preliminary report that it had a 1 in 250,000 chance of impacting into Earth on 21 March 2014. The discovery of a companion, approximately in diameter, was announced in September 2021.

== Description ==
 was discovered on 24 August 2003. It was added to the Sentry Risk Table on 30 August 2003. By 31 August 2003 (with an observation arc of 7 days) the odds of an impact on 21 March 2014 were already reduced to 1 in 1.7 million. The asteroid was removed from the Sentry Risk Table on 14 September 2003, indicating there is no risk of an impact by it in the next 100 years.

 safely passed within of Earth on 26 March 2014. With an observation arc of 10 years and an orbital uncertainty of 0, its orbit and future close approaches are well-determined.

== Preliminary reports ==
On 3 September 2003 a NASA press release wrote, 

 has a diameter of approximately 1.24 km, and a mass of approximately . If it were to hit the Earth, it would be a major event, with an energy of approximately 350,000 megatons of TNT (1.5 ZJ), enough to cause global damage.

Sara Russell, a meteorite researcher at London&#x27;s Natural History Museum, told the BBC on 2 September 2003 that she was not worried that would be a danger; &quot;The odds are very, very low ... We have to keep some kind of perspective&quot;, she said.

As a result of the press coverage of asteroids such as , astronomers are now planning to re-word the Torino scale, or to phase it out completely in favour of a scale that is less likely to generate false alarms that may reduce public confidence in genuine alerts.

== Binary system ==
A minor-planet moon orbiting was first detected on 29 August 2021, by Petr Pravec, Peter Kušnirák, Kamil Hornoch, and others using photometric data from ESO&#x27;s La Silla Observatory in Chile. The discovery was announced on 17 September 2021. The secondary measures a third the size of its primary (Ds/Dp-ratio of 0.33), resulting in a mean-diameter of approximately 310 meters. It is estimated to be tidally locked, orbiting from the primary every 13.065 hours. The primary has a rotation period of hours and a derived diameter of kilometers, for a resulting effective diameter (system) of kilometers.

== In fiction ==
* The asteroid was mentioned in &quot;Anonymous Rex&quot; (&quot;Les Reptilians&quot;) (2004) as the asteroid which the dinosaurs were counting on to destroy human civilization.
* The Korean drama &quot;My Love from the Star&quot; also mentions it as the asteroid that will allow Do Min-joon to travel back to his home planet.

<text>In finance, a default option, credit default swaption or credit default option is an option to buy protection (payer option) or sell protection (receiver option) as a credit default swap on a specific reference credit with a specific maturity. The option is usually European, exercisable only at one date in the future at a specific strike price defined as a coupon on the credit default swap.

Credit default options on single credits are extinguished upon default without any cashflows, other than the upfront premium paid by the buyer of the option. Therefore, buying a payer option is not a good protection against an actual default, only against a rise in the credit spread. This may explain why such options are very illiquid. They may also feature quite high implied volatilities, as shown by Damiano Brigo (2005). However options on credit indices such as iTraxx and CDX include any defaulted entities in the intrinsic value of the option when exercised. This is expressed at times by stating that the options offer &quot;front-end protection&quot;. Proper inclusion of front end protection complicates index options valuation, see for example Claus M. Pedersen (2003), or Brigo and Morini (2008).

<text>Sayyed Abol-Ghasem Mostafavi-Kashani ( &quot;Abu’l-Qāsem Kāšāni&quot;; 19 November 1882 – 13 March 1962) was an Iranian politician and Shia Marja. He played an important role in the 1953 coup in Iran and the overthrow of Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh.

==Early life==
His father, Ayatollah Hajj Seyyed Mostafavi Kashani (), was a noted scholar of Islam in his time. Abol-Ghasem was trained in Shia Islam by his religious parents and began study of the Quran soon after learning to read and write.

At 16, Abol-Ghasem went to an Islamic seminary to study literature, Arabic language, logic, semantics and speech, as well as the principles of Islamic jurisprudence, or Fiqh. He continued his education at the seminary in Najaf in the Qur&#x27;an and Hadiths as interpreted in Sharia law, receiving his jurisprudence degree when he was 25.

==Later life ==
=== Personal life ===
Kashani had 3 wives and 19 children, including 7 sons and 12 daughters.

His son Mostafa died in an accident in 1955; the newly appointed prime minister, Hossein Ala&#x27;, escaped an assassination attempt at the funeral. According to British intelligence, around this time two of his sons were involved in a lucrative business buying and selling import-export licenses for restricted goods.

One of Kashani&#x27;s children, Mahmoud Kashani, went on to become head of the Iranian delegation to the International Court of Justice in The Hague, Netherlands, in Iran&#x27;s case with the United States and a presidential candidate in the Iranian presidential elections of 1985 and elections in 2005. His second son is Ahmad Kashani, a former member of the Iranian parliament.

===Political life and death===
Abol-Ghasem expressed Anti-capitalist leanings from early on in his career and opposed what he saw as &quot;oppression, despotism and colonization.&quot; Because of these beliefs, he was especially popular with the poor in Tehran. He also advocated the return of Islamic government to Iran, though this was most likely for political reasons.

Due to his pro-Nazi positions, Ayatollah Kashani was arrested and exiled by the British to Palestine in 1941. He continued to oppose foreign, especially British, control of Iran&#x27;s oil industry while in exile. After he returned from exile on 10 June 1950, he continued to protest. Angered by the fact that the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company paid Iran much less than it did the British, he organized a movement against it and was the &quot;virtually alone among the leading mujtahids in joining&quot; nationalist Prime Minister Mohammed Mosaddeq, in his campaign to nationalize the Iranian oil industry in 1951.

Kashani served as speaker of the Majles (or lower house of Parliament), during the oil nationalization, but later turned against Mosaddeq during the 1953 Iranian coup d&#x27;état. Kashani protected the violent Islamist group Fada&#x27;iyan-e Islam, led by Navvab Safavi, after their expulsion from the Qom seminary by Ayatollah Hosein Borujerdi in 1950. The group then engaged in public assassinations in Tehran in the early 1950s. On 17 February 1956, a month after the execution of the Navvab Safavi due to his killing of senior figures Kashani confessed to an army prosecutor his role in these murders stating &quot;I issued the Fatwa to kill Razmara, for I was a qualified Mojtahed.&quot; Then Kashani was detained and following his release from the prison he retired from politics. He died on 13 March 1962.

<text>Parsing, syntax analysis, or syntactic analysis is a process of analyzing a string of symbols, either in natural language, computer languages or data structures, conforming to the rules of a formal grammar by breaking it into parts. The term &quot;parsing&quot; comes from Latin &quot;pars&quot; (&quot;orationis&quot;), meaning part (of speech).

The term has slightly different meanings in different branches of linguistics and computer science. Traditional sentence parsing is often performed as a method of understanding the exact meaning of a sentence or word, sometimes with the aid of devices such as sentence diagrams. It usually emphasizes the importance of grammatical divisions such as subject and predicate.

Within computational linguistics the term is used to refer to the formal analysis by a computer of a sentence or other string of words into its constituents, resulting in a parse tree showing their syntactic relation to each other, which may also contain semantic information. Some parsing algorithms generate a &quot;parse forest&quot; or list of parse trees from a string that is syntactically ambiguous.

The term is also used in psycholinguistics when describing language comprehension. In this context, parsing refers to the way that human beings analyze a sentence or phrase (in spoken language or text) &quot;in terms of grammatical constituents, identifying the parts of speech, syntactic relations, etc.&quot; This term is especially common when discussing which linguistic cues help speakers interpret garden-path sentences.

Within computer science, the term is used in the analysis of computer languages, referring to the syntactic analysis of the input code into its component parts in order to facilitate the writing of compilers and interpreters. The term may also be used to describe a split or separation.

In data analysis, the term is often used to refer to a process extracting desired information from data, e.g., creating a time series signal from a XML document.

== Human languages ==
=== Traditional methods ===
The traditional grammatical exercise of parsing, sometimes known as &quot;clause analysis&quot;, involves breaking down a text into its component parts of speech with an explanation of the form, function, and syntactic relationship of each part. This is determined in large part from study of the language&#x27;s conjugations and declensions, which can be quite intricate for heavily inflected languages. To parse a phrase such as &quot;man bites dog&quot; involves noting that the singular noun &quot;man&quot; is the subject of the sentence, the verb &quot;bites&quot; is the third person singular of the present tense of the verb &quot;to bite&quot;, and the singular noun &quot;dog&quot; is the object of the sentence. Techniques such as sentence diagrams are sometimes used to indicate relation between elements in the sentence.

Parsing was formerly central to the teaching of grammar throughout the English-speaking world, and widely regarded as basic to the use and understanding of written language.

=== Computational methods ===
In some machine translation and natural language processing systems, written texts in human languages are parsed by computer programs. Human sentences are not easily parsed by programs, as there is substantial ambiguity in the structure of human language, whose usage is to convey meaning (or semantics) amongst a potentially unlimited range of possibilities, but only some of which are germane to the particular case. So an utterance &quot;Man bites dog&quot; versus &quot;Dog bites man&quot; is definite on one detail but in another language might appear as &quot;Man dog bites&quot; with a reliance on the larger context to distinguish between those two possibilities, if indeed that difference was of concern. It is difficult to prepare formal rules to describe informal behaviour even though it is clear that some rules are being followed.

In order to parse natural language data, researchers must first agree on the grammar to be used. The choice of syntax is affected by both linguistic and computational concerns; for instance some parsing systems use lexical functional grammar, but in general, parsing for grammars of this type is known to be NP-complete. Head-driven phrase structure grammar is another linguistic formalism which has been popular in the parsing community, but other research efforts have focused on less complex formalisms such as the one used in the Penn Treebank. Shallow parsing aims to find only the boundaries of major constituents such as noun phrases. Another popular strategy for avoiding linguistic controversy is dependency grammar parsing.

Most modern parsers are at least partly statistical; that is, they rely on a corpus of training data which has already been annotated (parsed by hand). This approach allows the system to gather information about the frequency with which various constructions occur in specific contexts. &quot;(See machine learning.)&quot; Approaches which have been used include straightforward PCFGs (probabilistic context-free grammars), maximum entropy, and neural nets. Most of the more successful systems use &quot;lexical&quot; statistics (that is, they consider the identities of the words involved, as well as their part of speech). However such systems are vulnerable to overfitting and require some kind of smoothing to be effective.

Parsing algorithms for natural language cannot rely on the grammar having &#x27;nice&#x27; properties as with manually designed grammars for programming languages. As mentioned earlier some grammar formalisms are very difficult to parse computationally; in general, even if the desired structure is not context-free, some kind of context-free approximation to the grammar is used to perform a first pass. Algorithms which use context-free grammars often rely on some variant of the CYK algorithm, usually with some heuristic to prune away unlikely analyses to save time. &quot;(See chart parsing.)&quot; However some systems trade speed for accuracy using, e.g., linear-time versions of the shift-reduce algorithm. A somewhat recent development has been parse reranking in which the parser proposes some large number of analyses, and a more complex system selects the best option. In natural language understanding applications, semantic parsers convert the text into a representation of its meaning.

=== Psycholinguistics ===
In psycholinguistics, parsing involves not just the assignment of words to categories (formation of ontological insights), but the evaluation of the meaning of a sentence according to the rules of syntax drawn by inferences made from each word in the sentence (known as connotation). This normally occurs as words are being heard or read.

Neurolinguistics generally understands parsing to be a function of working memory, meaning that parsing is used to keep several parts of one sentence at play in the mind at one time, all readily accessible to be analyzed as needed. Because the human working memory has limitations, so does the function of sentence parsing. This is evidenced by several different types of syntactically complex sentences that propose potentially issues for mental parsing of sentences.

The first, and perhaps most well-known, type of sentence that challenges parsing ability is the garden-path sentence. These sentences are designed so that the most common interpretation of the sentence appears grammatically faulty, but upon further inspection, these sentences are grammatically sound. Garden-path sentences are difficult to parse because they contain a phrase or a word with more than one meaning, often their most typical meaning being a different part of speech. For example, in the sentence, &quot;the horse raced past the barn fell&quot;, raced is initially interpreted as a past tense verb, but in this sentence, it functions as part of an adjective phrase. Since parsing is used to identify parts of speech, these sentences challenge the parsing ability of the reader.

Another type of sentence that is difficult to parse is an attachment ambiguity, which includes a phrase that could potentially modify different parts of a sentence, and therefore presents a challenge in identifying syntactic relationship (i.e. &quot;The boy saw the lady with the telescope&quot;, in which the ambiguous phrase with the telescope could modify the boy saw or the lady.) 

A third type of sentence that challenges parsing ability is center embedding, in which phrases are placed in the center of other similarly formed phrases (i.e. &quot;The rat the cat the man hit chased ran into the trap&quot;.) Sentences with 2 or in the most extreme cases 3 center embeddings are challenging for mental parsing, again because of ambiguity of syntactic relationship.

Within neurolinguistics there are multiple theories that aim to describe how parsing takes place in the brain. One such model is a more traditional generative model of sentence processing, which theorizes that within the brain there is a distinct module designed for sentence parsing, which is preceded by access to lexical recognition and retrieval, and then followed by syntactic processing that considers a single syntactic result of the parsing, only returning to revise that syntactic interpretation if a potential problem is detected. The opposing, more contemporary model theorizes that within the mind, the processing of a sentence is not modular, or happening in strict sequence. Rather, it poses that several different syntactic possibilities can be considered at the same time, because lexical access, syntactic processing, and determination of meaning occur in parallel in the brain. In this way these processes are integrated.

Although there is still much to learn about the neurology of parsing, studies have shown evidence that several areas of the brain might play a role in parsing. These include the left anterior temporal pole, the left inferior frontal gyrus, the left superior temporal gyrus, the left superior frontal gyrus, the right posterior cingulate cortex, and the left angular gyrus. Although it has not been absolutely proven, it has been suggested that these different structures might favor either phrase-structure parsing or dependency-structure parsing, meaning different types of parsing could be processed in different ways which have yet to be understood.

=== Discourse analysis ===
Discourse analysis examines ways to analyze language use and semiotic events. Persuasive language may be called rhetoric.

== Computer languages ==
=== Parser ===

A parser is a software component that takes input data (typically text) and builds a data structure – often some kind of parse tree, abstract syntax tree or other hierarchical structure, giving a structural representation of the input while checking for correct syntax. The parsing may be preceded or followed by other steps, or these may be combined into a single step. The parser is often preceded by a separate lexical analyser, which creates tokens from the sequence of input characters; alternatively, these can be combined in scannerless parsing. Parsers may be programmed by hand or may be automatically or semi-automatically generated by a parser generator. Parsing is complementary to templating, which produces formatted &quot;output.&quot; These may be applied to different domains, but often appear together, such as the scanf/printf pair, or the input (front end parsing) and output (back end code generation) stages of a compiler.

The input to a parser is typically text in some computer language, but may also be text in a natural language or less structured textual data, in which case generally only certain parts of the text are extracted, rather than a parse tree being constructed. Parsers range from very simple functions such as scanf, to complex programs such as the frontend of a C++ compiler or the HTML parser of a web browser. An important class of simple parsing is done using regular expressions, in which a group of regular expressions defines a regular language and a regular expression engine automatically generating a parser for that language, allowing pattern matching and extraction of text. In other contexts regular expressions are instead used prior to parsing, as the lexing step whose output is then used by the parser.

The use of parsers varies by input. In the case of data languages, a parser is often found as the file reading facility of a program, such as reading in HTML or XML text; these examples are markup languages. In the case of programming languages, a parser is a component of a compiler or interpreter, which parses the source code of a computer programming language to create some form of internal representation; the parser is a key step in the compiler frontend. Programming languages tend to be specified in terms of a deterministic context-free grammar because fast and efficient parsers can be written for them. For compilers, the parsing itself can be done in one pass or multiple passes – see one-pass compiler and multi-pass compiler.

The implied disadvantages of a one-pass compiler can largely be overcome by adding fix-ups, where provision is made for code relocation during the forward pass, and the fix-ups are applied backwards when the current program segment has been recognized as having been completed. An example where such a fix-up mechanism would be useful would be a forward GOTO statement, where the target of the GOTO is unknown until the program segment is completed. In this case, the application of the fix-up would be delayed until the target of the GOTO was recognized. Conversely, a backward GOTO does not require a fix-up, as the location will already be known.

Context-free grammars are limited in the extent to which they can express all of the requirements of a language. Informally, the reason is that the memory of such a language is limited. The grammar cannot remember the presence of a construct over an arbitrarily long input; this is necessary for a language in which, for example, a name must be declared before it may be referenced. More powerful grammars that can express this constraint, however, cannot be parsed efficiently. Thus, it is a common strategy to create a relaxed parser for a context-free grammar which accepts a superset of the desired language constructs (that is, it accepts some invalid constructs); later, the unwanted constructs can be filtered out at the semantic analysis (contextual analysis) step.

For example, in Python the following is syntactically valid code:

x = 1
print(x)

The following code, however, is syntactically valid in terms of the context-free grammar, yielding a syntax tree with the same structure as the previous, but violates the semantic rule requiring variables to be initialized before use:

x = 1
print(y)
=== Overview of process ===

The following example demonstrates the common case of parsing a computer language with two levels of grammar: lexical and syntactic.

The first stage is the token generation, or lexical analysis, by which the input character stream is split into meaningful symbols defined by a grammar of regular expressions. For example, a calculator program would look at an input such as &quot;codice_1&quot; and split it into the tokens codice_2, codice_3, codice_4, codice_5, codice_6, codice_7, codice_8, codice_9, codice_10, each of which is a meaningful symbol in the context of an arithmetic expression. The lexer would contain rules to tell it that the characters codice_3, codice_6, codice_9, codice_4 and codice_8 mark the start of a new token, so meaningless tokens like &quot;codice_16&quot; or &quot;codice_17&quot; will not be generated.

The next stage is parsing or syntactic analysis, which is checking that the tokens form an allowable expression. This is usually done with reference to a context-free grammar which recursively defines components that can make up an expression and the order in which they must appear. However, not all rules defining programming languages can be expressed by context-free grammars alone, for example type validity and proper declaration of identifiers. These rules can be formally expressed with attribute grammars.

The final phase is semantic parsing or analysis, which is working out the implications of the expression just validated and taking the appropriate action. In the case of a calculator or interpreter, the action is to evaluate the expression or program; a compiler, on the other hand, would generate some kind of code. Attribute grammars can also be used to define these actions.

== Types of parsers ==
The &quot;task&quot; of the parser is essentially to determine if and how the input can be derived from the start symbol of the grammar. This can be done in essentially two ways:
;Top-down parsing
:Top-down parsing can be viewed as an attempt to find left-most derivations of an input-stream by searching for parse trees using a top-down expansion of the given formal grammar rules. Tokens are consumed from left to right. Inclusive choice is used to accommodate ambiguity by expanding all alternative right-hand-sides of grammar rules. This is known as the primordial soup approach. Very similar to sentence diagramming, primordial soup breaks down the constituencies of sentences.
;Bottom-up parsing
: A parser can start with the input and attempt to rewrite it to the start symbol. Intuitively, the parser attempts to locate the most basic elements, then the elements containing these, and so on. LR parsers are examples of bottom-up parsers. Another term used for this type of parser is Shift-Reduce parsing.

LL parsers and recursive-descent parser are examples of top-down parsers that cannot accommodate left recursive production rules. Although it has been believed that simple implementations of top-down parsing cannot accommodate direct and indirect left-recursion and may require exponential time and space complexity while parsing ambiguous context-free grammars, more sophisticated algorithms for top-down parsing have been created by Frost, Hafiz, and Callaghan which accommodate ambiguity and left recursion in polynomial time and which generate polynomial-size representations of the potentially exponential number of parse trees. Their algorithm is able to produce both left-most and right-most derivations of an input with regard to a given context-free grammar.

An important distinction with regard to parsers is whether a parser generates a &quot;leftmost derivation&quot; or a &quot;rightmost derivation&quot; (see context-free grammar). LL parsers will generate a leftmost derivation and LR parsers will generate a rightmost derivation (although usually in reverse).

Some &quot;&quot; algorithms have been designed for visual programming languages. Parsers for visual languages are sometimes based on graph grammars.

Adaptive parsing algorithms have been used to construct &quot;self-extending&quot; natural language user interfaces.

=== Implementation ===

A simple parser implementation reads the entire input file, performs an intermediate computation or translation, and then writes the entire output file,
such as in-memory multi-pass compilers.

Alternative parser implementation approaches:

* push parsers call registered handlers (callbacks) as soon as the parser detects relevant tokens in the input stream. A push parser may skip parts of the input that are irrelevant (an example is Expat).
* pull parsers, such as parsers that are typically used by compilers front-ends by &quot;pulling&quot; input text.
* incremental parsers (such as incremental chart parsers) that, as the text of the file is edited by a user, does not need to completely re-parse the entire file.
* Active versus passive parsers

== Parser development software ==
Some of the well known parser development tools include the following:

* ANTLR
* Bison
* Coco/R
* Definite clause grammar
* GOLD
* JavaCC
* Lemon
* Lex
* LuZc
* Parboiled
* Parsec
* Ragel
* Spirit Parser Framework
* Syntax Definition Formalism
* SYNTAX
* XPL
* Yacc
== Lookahead ==
Lookahead establishes the maximum incoming tokens that a parser can use to decide which rule it should use. Lookahead is especially relevant to LL, LR, and LALR parsers, where it is often explicitly indicated by affixing the lookahead to the algorithm name in parentheses, such as LALR(1).

Most programming languages, the primary target of parsers, are carefully defined in such a way that a parser with limited lookahead, typically one, can parse them, because parsers with limited lookahead are often more efficient. One important change to this trend came in 1990 when Terence Parr created ANTLR for his Ph.D. thesis, a parser generator for efficient LL(&quot;k&quot;) parsers, where &quot;k&quot; is any fixed value.

LR parsers typically have only a few actions after seeing each token. They are shift (add this token to the stack for later reduction), reduce (pop tokens from the stack and form a syntactic construct), end, error (no known rule applies) or conflict (does not know whether to shift or reduce).

Lookahead has two advantages.
* It helps the parser take the correct action in case of conflicts. For example, parsing the if statement in the case of an else clause.
* It eliminates many duplicate states and eases the burden of an extra stack. A C language non-lookahead parser will have around 10,000 states. A lookahead parser will have around 300 states.

Example: Parsing the Expression 
Most programming languages (except for a few such as APL and Smalltalk) and algebraic formulas give higher precedence to multiplication than addition, in which case the correct interpretation of the example above is .
Note that Rule4 above is a semantic rule. It is possible to rewrite the grammar to incorporate this into the syntax. However, not all such rules can be translated into syntax.

; Simple non-lookahead parser actions
Initially Input = [1, +, 2, *, 3]
# Shift &quot;1&quot; onto stack from input (in anticipation of rule3). Input = [+, 2, *, 3] Stack = [1]
# Reduces &quot;1&quot; to expression &quot;E&quot; based on rule3. Stack = [E]
# Shift &quot;+&quot; onto stack from input (in anticipation of rule1). Input = [2, *, 3] Stack = [E, +]
# Shift &quot;2&quot; onto stack from input (in anticipation of rule3). Input = [*, 3] Stack = [E, +, 2]
# Reduce stack element &quot;2&quot; to Expression &quot;E&quot; based on rule3. Stack = [E, +, E]
# Reduce stack items [E, +, E] and new input &quot;E&quot; to &quot;E&quot; based on rule1. Stack = [E]
# Shift &quot;*&quot; onto stack from input (in anticipation of rule2). Input = [3] Stack = [E,*]
# Shift &quot;3&quot; onto stack from input (in anticipation of rule3). Input = [] (empty) Stack = [E, *, 3]
# Reduce stack element &quot;3&quot; to expression &quot;E&quot; based on rule3. Stack = [E, *, E]
# Reduce stack items [E, *, E] and new input &quot;E&quot; to &quot;E&quot; based on rule2. Stack = [E]

The parse tree and resulting code from it is not correct according to language semantics.

To correctly parse without lookahead, there are three solutions:
* The user has to enclose expressions within parentheses. This often is not a viable solution.
* The parser needs to have more logic to backtrack and retry whenever a rule is violated or not complete. The similar method is followed in LL parsers.
* Alternatively, the parser or grammar needs to have extra logic to delay reduction and reduce only when it is absolutely sure which rule to reduce first. This method is used in LR parsers. This correctly parses the expression but with many more states and increased stack depth.

; Lookahead parser actions
# Shift 1 onto stack on input 1 in anticipation of rule3. It does not reduce immediately.
# Reduce stack item 1 to simple Expression on input + based on rule3. The lookahead is +, so we are on path to E +, so we can reduce the stack to E.
# Shift + onto stack on input + in anticipation of rule1.
# Shift 2 onto stack on input 2 in anticipation of rule3.
# Reduce stack item 2 to Expression on input * based on rule3. The lookahead * expects only E before it.
# Now stack has E + E and still the input is *. It has two choices now, either to shift based on rule2 or reduction based on rule1. Since * has higher precedence than + based on rule4, we shift * onto stack in anticipation of rule2.
# Shift 3 onto stack on input 3 in anticipation of rule3.
# Reduce stack item 3 to Expression after seeing end of input based on rule3.
# Reduce stack items E * E to E based on rule2.
# Reduce stack items E + E to E based on rule1.
The parse tree generated is correct and simply than non-lookahead parsers. This is the strategy followed in LALR parsers.

<text>Phil Silvers (born Phillip Silver; May 11, 1911 – November 1, 1985) was an American entertainer and comedic actor, known as &quot;The King of Chutzpah&quot;. His career as a professional entertainer spanned nearly 60 years. He achieved major popularity when he starred in &quot;The Phil Silvers Show&quot;, a 1950s sitcom set on a U.S. Army post in which he played Master Sergeant Ernest (Ernie) Bilko. He also starred in the films &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot; (1963) and &quot;A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum&quot; (1966). He was a winner of two Primetime Emmy Awards for his work on &quot;The Phil Silvers Show&quot; and two Tony Awards for his performances in &quot;Top Banana&quot; and &quot;A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum&quot;. He also wrote the original lyrics to the jazz standard &quot;Nancy (with the Laughing Face)&quot;.

==Early life==
Born Philip Silver, he was the eighth and youngest child of Russian Jewish immigrants, Saul and Sarah (née Handler) Silver. His father, a sheet metal worker, helped build the early New York skyscrapers.

==Career==
Silvers began entertaining at the age of 11, when he would sing in theaters when the film projector broke (a common occurrence in those days), to the point where he was allowed to keep attending the same movie theater free of charge, to sing through any future breakdowns. By age 13, he was working as a singer in the Gus Edwards Revue. Subsequently, he worked in vaudeville and as a burlesque comic.

Silvers next worked in short films for the Vitaphone studio, such as &quot;Ups and Downs&quot; (1937), and on Broadway, where he made his début in the short-lived show &quot;Yokel Boy&quot; in 1939. Critics raved about Silvers, who was hailed as the bright spot in the mediocre play. The Broadway revue &quot;High Kickers&quot; (1941) was based on his concept.

He made his feature film début in &quot;Hit Parade of 1941&quot; in 1940 (his previous appearance as a &#x27;pitch man&#x27; in &quot;Strike Up the Band&quot; was cut). Over the next two decades, he worked as a character actor for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Columbia, and 20th Century Fox, in such films as &quot;All Through the Night&quot; (1942) with Humphrey Bogart. Around the same time, he played a scene with W. C. Fields in &quot;Tales of Manhattan&quot; (also 1942) which was cut from the original release, but restored decades later in home video issues. Silvers also appeared in &quot;Lady Be Good&quot; (1941), &quot;Coney Island&quot; (1943), &quot;Cover Girl&quot; (1944), with Gene Kelly and Rita Hayworth, and in &quot;Summer Stock&quot; (1950) with Kelly and Judy Garland. When the studio system began to decline, he returned to the stage.

Silvers wrote the lyrics for Frank Sinatra&#x27;s &quot;Nancy (With the Laughing Face)&quot;. Although he was not a songwriter, he wrote the lyrics while visiting composer Jimmy Van Heusen. The two composed the song for Van Heusen&#x27;s writing partner Johnny Burke, for his wife Bessie&#x27;s birthday. Substituting Sinatra&#x27;s little daughter&#x27;s name Nancy at her birthday party, the trio pressed the singer to record it himself. The song became a popular hit in 1945 and was a staple in Sinatra&#x27;s live performances. Towards the end of World War II, Silvers entertained the troops during several successful overseas USO tours with Sinatra.

===&quot;The Phil Silvers Show&quot;===
Silvers became a household name in 1955 when he starred as Sergeant Ernest G. Bilko in &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Get Rich&quot;, later retitled &quot;The Phil Silvers Show&quot;. The military comedy became a television hit, with the opportunistic Bilko fast-talking his way through one obstacle after another. In 1958, CBS switched the show to be telecast on Friday nights and moved the setting to Camp Fremont in California. A year later, the show was off the schedule. In the 1963–1964 television season, he appeared as Harry Grafton, a factory foreman interested in get-rich-quick schemes, much like the previous Bilko character, in CBS&#x27;s 30-episode &quot;The New Phil Silvers Show&quot;, with co-stars Stafford Repp, Herbie Faye, Buddy Lester, Elena Verdugo as his sister, Audrey, and her children, played by Ronnie Dapo and Sandy Descher.

=== Film roles ===

Throughout the 1960s, he appeared in films such as &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot; (1963) and &quot;40 Pounds of Trouble&quot; (1963). According to the documentary on the DVD of &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot;, Silvers was not a traditional comedian: he was a comic actor. He never did stand-up, and, out of character, was not known for cracking jokes.
He was featured in Marilyn Monroe&#x27;s last film, the unfinished &quot;Something&#x27;s Got to Give&quot; (1962). In 1967, he starred as a guest in one of the British Carry On films, &quot;Follow That Camel&quot;, a Foreign Legion parody in which he played a variation of the Sergeant Bilko character, Sergeant Nocker. Producer Peter Rogers employed him to ensure the Carry On films&#x27; success in America, though Silvers&#x27;s presence did not ensure the film&#x27;s success on either side of the Atlantic. His salary was £30,000, the largest Carry On salary ever, only later met by the appearance of Elke Sommer in &quot;Carry On Behind&quot;.

=== Broadway ===
When Silvers played the quintessential con-man Harrison Floy in the 1947 Broadway production of &quot;High Button Shoes&quot;, Brooks Atkinson praised him as &quot;an uproarious comic. He has the speed, the drollery and the shell-game style of a honky-tonk buffoon.&quot; Silvers later scored a major triumph in &quot;Top Banana&quot;, a Broadway show of 1952. Silvers played Jerry Biffle, the egocentric, always-busy star of a major television show. (The character is said to have been based on Milton Berle.) Silvers dominated the show and won a Tony Award for his performance. He repeated the role in the 1954 film version which was initially released in 3-D. Silvers returned to Broadway in the musical &quot;Do Re Mi&quot; in December 1960, receiving a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical. Stanley Green wrote, &quot;It was particularly blessed by offering two outstanding clowns in Phil Silvers as the pushiest of patsies and Nancy Walker.&quot; 
Silvers was offered the leading role of conniving Roman slave Pseudolus in the Broadway musical comedy &quot;A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum&quot;. Silvers declined, and the role went instead to Zero Mostel, who was so successful in the role that he repeated the role in the 1966 film version. By this time, Silvers realized his error and agreed to appear in the film as a secondary character, flesh merchant Marcus Lycus. When actor-producer Larry Blyden mounted a Broadway revival of &quot;Forum&quot; in 1972, he wanted Phil Silvers to play the lead, and this time Silvers agreed. The revival was a hit and Silvers became the first leading actor ever to win a Tony Award in a revival of a musical.

===Later career===

Later in his career, Silvers guest-starred on &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;, and various TV variety shows such as &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot;, &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot; and &quot;The Dean Martin Show&quot;. He appeared as curmudgeonly Hollywood producer Harold Hecuba in the classic 1966 episode &quot;The Producer&quot; on &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;, where he and the castaways performed a musical version of &quot;Hamlet&quot;. (Silvers&#x27;s production company Gladasya – named after his catchphrase &quot;Gladdaseeya!&quot; – financed the show.) He continued to make guest appearances in television sitcoms including, &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;, &quot;Happy Days&quot;, and his final screen credit &quot;CHiPs&quot; in 1983. He also starred in various television specials and talk shows such as &quot;The Bob Hope Special&quot;, &quot;The Jackie Gleason Show&quot;, &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot;, &quot;The Dick Cavett Show&quot;, &quot;The David Frost Show&quot;, &quot;The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson&quot; and &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot;. In 1980, Silvers participated in &quot;The Friar&#x27;s Club Tribute to Milton Berle&quot; alongside Don Rickles, Dick Shawn, Walter Matthau, Jack Lemmon, George Burns, Karl Malden, and Robert Culp.

==Personal life==
Phil Silvers was married twice, to Jo-Carroll Dennison and to Evelyn Patrick. Both of his marriages ended in divorce. He had five daughters, including Cathy, all by his second wife, Evelyn Patrick, who later married British musician Terry Dene.

Like his alter-ego Ernie Bilko, Silvers was a compulsive gambler, and also suffered from chronic depression. He suffered a nervous breakdown in 1962 while performing in Spain. While staying in Reno, Nevada, in the 1950s, he would often gamble all night. On one occasion, at the tiny Cal-Neva Lodge in nearby Lake Tahoe, Nevada, Silvers spent an entire night playing craps until he lost all his money and then went through $1,000 in credit. A taxi was called to return him to Reno. It was one &quot;of the worst nights of my life&quot;, Silvers told the driver, adding, &quot;Don&#x27;t wait for any lights and don&#x27;t wait for any tip . . . I left it at the Cal-Neva!&quot;

His memoir is titled &quot;This Laugh Is On Me&quot;.

==Illness and death==
Silvers suffered a stroke during the run of &quot;A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum&quot; in August 1972 at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre. He was left with slurred speech. Despite his poor health, he continued working, playing Harry Starman in the 1974 &quot;Horror in the Heights&quot; episode of &quot;&quot; starring Darren McGavin. His guest appearances continued into the early 1980s, including co-starring in &quot;The Chicken Chronicles&quot; (1977), an appearance on &quot;Fantasy Island&quot; as an old comic trying to reunite with his old partner, and on &quot;Happy Days&quot; as the father of Jenny Piccolo (played by his real-life daughter, Cathy). Silvers played the cab driver Hoppy in Neil Simon&#x27;s send-up of hard-boiled detective films, &quot;The Cheap Detective&quot; (1978), which starred Peter Falk. In his cab, Silvers can be heard (three words) and seen turning his head towards the camera and breaking into a smile (1/4 fps) at the film&#x27;s ending immediately prior to Falk entering &quot;Hoppy&#x27;s&quot; cab. His final appearance was in an episode of &quot;CHiPs&quot; (entitled &quot;Hot Date&quot;) in 1983.

On November 1, 1985, Silvers died in his sleep in Century City, California. He was interred at Mount Sinai Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles.

==Legacy==
In 1996, &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked him number 31 on its 50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time list.

In 2003, &quot;The Phil Silvers Show&quot; was voted Best Sitcom in the &quot;Radio Times Guide to TV Comedy&quot;. In a 2005 poll to find The Comedian&#x27;s Comedian, Silvers was voted #42 on the list of the top 50 comedy acts ever by fellow comedians and comedy insiders. Dick Van Dyke, who made his TV debut on &quot;Bilko&quot;, says he &quot;was always fascinated with Phil&#x27;s sense of timing. Incredible.&quot;

Voice actor Daws Butler employed an impression of Silvers as the voice of the Hanna-Barbera cartoon character Hokey Wolf and also used the same voice in numerous cartoons for Jay Ward. The premise of &quot;The Phil Silvers Show&quot; was the basis for the Hanna-Barbera animated series &quot;Top Cat&quot;, for which Arnold Stang moderately imitated Silvers&#x27;s voice for the title character. The 1993 animated series &quot;Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; featured a character called Wes Weasley, who had a very similar appearance and voice to Silvers.

&quot;Sgt Bilko&#x27;s Vintage Emporium and The Phil Silvers Archival Museum&quot; houses personal and commercial memorabilia collected by Silvers&#x27;s correspondent Steve Everitt. Opened in 2015 it is located in FarGo Village, Coventry, United Kingdom.

<text>Tee-ball (also teeball, tee ball or T-ball) is a team sport based on a simplified form of baseball or softball. It is intended as an introduction for children to develop bat-and-ball game skills and have fun.

==Description==
Tee-ball associations generally allow children between the ages of four and seven to play in their leagues. A tee-ball coach sets the team lineup and fielding positions in the team&#x27;s scorebook. The positions that get the most action in tee-ball are pitcher and first base, followed by the rest of the infield positions. In some leagues, catcher is also a special position due to the added gear that is worn; in other leagues, there is no catcher. In tee-ball, the pitcher is usually used for defensive purposes only, though gently pitched balls may be used with older or more advanced players in place of the fixed tee. The ball is placed on an adjustable tee atop the home plate at a suitable height for the batter to strike. (In some clubs, adult coaches give the batter an opportunity to try and hit a few pitched balls before going to the tee in the hope that this will further develop batting skills.) Most of the other rules are similar or identical to those of baseball, though the game is played on a smaller field, typically one used for Little League or other youth baseball. In addition, for the youngest tee-ball players, runs and outs are often not recorded, and every player gets to bat each inning.
Many parents assist during the game by coaching players in the dugout, in the field, on the bases, and at the plate. They often also perform the task of umpiring.

==Equipment specifications==
Bats: 25 to 26 inches long, 2.25 inches diameter, maximum weight 17 to 20 oz.

Balls: typically appear identical to baseballs, but slightly softer to reduce injuries: 9 to 9.5 inches around, 4 to 5 oz weight, with a molded core or sponge rubber center.

Footwear: Athletic footwear such as running shoes.

Gloves: 12 inches long maximum.

Safety helmets: Mandatory at all times.

Tee: Height-adjustible, flexible tube, with a movable base.

==History==
The game&#x27;s origins date back to at least the 1950s, with several people claiming to be the father of the game, and it appears to have been independently invented in several places. Albion, Michigan claims to be the earliest place of invention of the sport, in 1956, by Jerome Sacharski. Claude Lewis, director of the Warner Robins, Georgia, Recreation Department, formed a tee-ball league in March 1958, in which 20 children played the first year. Lewis designed rules for the new game and mailed the rule books out to recreation departments all over the country and overseas. Nevertheless, the city of Starkville, Mississippi, claims to have independently created tee-ball in 1961. According to the Starkville Rotary Club&#x27;s website: &quot;In 1961, when it was apparent that younger children needed some way to participate in the program, Rotarians Clyde Muse and W. W. Littlejohn devised the game of &quot;&quot; and added it to the summer baseball program.&quot;

A &quot;Tee Ball&quot; trademark was filed in April of 1971 and subsequently registered in February of 1973 with the United States Patent and Trademark Office by Robert Dayton Hobbs (1924–2006), the pastor of a fundamentalist Christian church he founded in Milton, Florida, and also the organizer in the late 1950s of the first organized youth baseball program in Santa Rosa County, Florida. Hobbs&#x27;s &quot;Tee Ball&quot; trademark was still asserted by Gospel Projects, Inc., of Milton, Florida, at least (last year of publication of their &quot;Tee Ball Baseball Organization Rules&quot;).

Hobbs credited the United States Navy with spreading the game overseas.

It is estimated that 2.2 million children play tee-ball.

In the &quot;White House Tee Ball Initiative&quot;, U.S. president George W. Bush hosted tee-ball games on the South Lawn of the White House.

==United States==
===T-Ball USA Association===
A non-profit governing body exists in the United States, the T-Ball USA Association, of West Palm Beach, Florida. It is a national member of USA Baseball, a partner of the International Baseball Federation (IBAF), and its principal officers are members of the National Council of Youth Sports. The association publishes a summarized basic rule-set and field requirements,
and supports local parks and recreation departments, youth activity clubs and baseball leagues, military bases&#x27;s youth programs, and independent parent-administered leagues. The organization also arranges events, including tee-ball team attendance at Major and Minor League baseball games, and the MLB All-Star Game FanFests. Their stylized &quot;T•BALL USA&quot; logo &quot;identifies the projects and programs created to support the national constituency and marks licensed and approved products, corporate sponsorships and appropriate alliances.&quot;

==In Australia==
Tee-ball is a popular sport for Australian primary school children. An estimated 60% of Australian primary schools include Tee-ball in their sports programs and 17,000 children play in organised competitions. 2017 research found 10.6% of 6–13 year-olds regularly play tee-ball, making it the 14th most popular children&#x27;s sport in Australia. This does not appear to translate into increased participation in baseball and softball which are not popular sports for teenagers older than 14.
