<text>Candlepin bowling is a variation of bowling that is played primarily in the Canadian Maritime provinces and the New England region of the United States. It is played with a handheld-sized ball and tall, narrow pins that resemble candles, hence the name. 

== Comparison to ten-pin bowling ==
As in other forms of pin bowling, players roll balls down a 60 foot, wooden or synthetic lane, to knock down as many pins as possible. Differences between candlepin bowling and ten-pin bowling include:
* Candlepin involves three rolls per frame, rather than two rolls as in ten-pin.
* Candlepin balls are much smaller, being in diameter and have a maximum weight of 2 lbs. 7 oz. They are almost identical in weight to a pin, as opposed to ten-pin balls whose maximum allowable weight is more than four times that of a pin.
* No oil is applied to the lane, so the ball does not skid but rolls all the way down the lane.
* Candlepin balls lack finger holes.
* Candlepins are thinner (hence the name &quot;candlepin&quot;), which increases the amount of space between pins, further reducing scoring.
* Fallen pins (&quot;wood&quot;) are not cleared away between rolls during a frame, so long as the entire pin stays behind the &quot;dead wood&quot; line, which is 24 inches in front of the &quot;head pin&quot; spot. Wood in the gutters is &quot;dead wood&quot;, which means that if the ball makes its first contact with it, the pins felled do not count, nor are they re-spotted.

== History ==


The International Candlepin Bowling Association (ICBA) website states that candlepin bowling was first played in 1880 in Worcester, Massachusetts, thought to have been developed by Justin White, owner of a billiards and bowling hall. A 1987 &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; article stated the game was invented in 1881 in that town by one John J. Monsey, a billiards player, who is recognized for standardizing the game. A 1891 newspaper notice shows the incremental introduction of a single &quot;candle-pin bowling set&quot; into a bowling alley originally hosting other types of bowling. In 1906, Monsey created the National Duckpin and Candlepin Congress, which regulated ball size, pin shape and size, and lane surface characteristics, facilitating formation of leagues and other competitions.

Originally, pins were inch-thick dowels, resembling candles, thought to give rise to the name, candlepins. An 1888 newspaper article referred to 2-inch thick pins. Both were thinner than modern candlepins which are specified to be inches (74.6 mm) thick. In the late 1960s, plastic candlepins began to replace wood candlepins, a change that some thought required a change in game strategy.
In 1947, lawyers Howard Dowd and Lionel Barrow overcame the need for human pinsetters by inventing the first automatic candlepin pinsetter, called the &quot;Bowl-Mor&quot;, the two inventors receiving a patent that issued in 1956.

Stations WHDH-TV/5 &amp; the later licensee of channel 5, WCVB-TV, aired candlepin bowling&#x27;s first televised show from 1958 through 1996, and in 1964, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; launched its own annual candlepin tournament. In 1965, the World Candlepin Bowling Council (WCPC) began its Hall of Fame, inducting WCVB commentator Don Gillis in 1987. In 1973, station WHDH began airing &quot;Candlepins for Cash,&quot; allowing contestants to earn a jackpot by rolling a strike.

In 1986, the International Candlepin Bowling Association (ICBA) was formed.

The highest sanctioned candlepin score is 245, achieved in 1984 (Ralph Semb, Erving, Massachusetts) and again on May 13, 2011 (Chris Sargent, Haverhill, Massachusetts).

==Game play==
Candlepins are high and inches (74.6 mm) thick in diameter. Balls are in diameter and lighter than a single candlepin.

A candlepin bowling lane, almost identical to a tenpin bowling lane, has an approach area of for the player to bowl from, and then the lane proper, a maple surface approximately wide, bounded on either side by a gutter (or &quot;channel&quot; or trough). The lane is separated from the approach by a &quot;foul line&quot; common to most bowling sports, which players must not cross. At the far end of the lane are the pins, from the foul line to the center of the headpin (or pin #1), placed by a pinsetter machine which occupies space both above and behind the pins. Unlike a tenpin lane, which has a level surface from the foul line to the back end of the lanebed&#x27;s &quot;pin deck&quot;, a candlepin lane has a hard-surfaced &quot;pin plate&quot; where the pins are set up, with the pin plate depressed below the lanebed forward of it. The pin plate can be made from hard-surfaced metal, phenolic, high density plastic, or a synthetic material. Behind the pin plate area is a well-depressed &quot;pit&quot; area for the felled pins and balls to fall into. A heavy rubber backstop, faced with a black curtain, catches the flying pins and balls so they drop into the pit. Generally there is seating behind the approach area for teammates, spectators, and score keeping.

The candlepins themselves are tall, have a cylindrical shape which tapers equally towards each end (and therefore have no distinct &quot;top&quot; or &quot;bottom&quot; end, unlike a tenpin), giving them an overall appearance somewhat like a candle, and have a maximum weight of apiece. Candlepin bowling uses the same numbering system and shape for the formation within the ten candlepins are set, as the tenpin sport. Also, as in tenpin bowling, due to the spacing of the pins (, center to center), it is impossible for the ball to strike every one. However, while in tenpin a well-placed ball (usually between the head pin and the 2 or 3 pin) may knock down all ten pins (a &quot;strike&quot; if on the first ball in a frame) from the chain reaction of pin hitting pin, in candlepins the smaller thickness of the pins makes throwing a strike extremely difficult. To count, the pin must be knocked over entirely; in unlucky circumstances, a pin may wobble furiously, or even more frustratingly, be &quot;kicked&quot; to the side by several inches, yet come to rest upright, thus not being scored (or reset to its original position for any remaining throws, though it may be knocked over by subsequent balls). It is even possible for a toppled pin to bounce off a side &quot;kickback&quot;, and return to a standing position on the lane&#x27;s pin deck. However, if a fallen pin returns to a standing position, the pin is still counted as fallen and is played as live wood.

In addition to the foul line, there is a line further down the lane called the lob line, and the ball must first contact the lane at any point on the bowler&#x27;s side of it, be it on the approach or the first ten feet of the lanebed. Any &quot;airborne&quot; ball delivery not making contact with the approach or lanebed short of the &quot;lob line&quot; constitutes a violation of this rule, and is termed a lob with any pins knocked down by such a ball not counting—and such pins are not reset if the lobbed ball was not the third and last shot for that player in that box.

Also, a third line, centered forward of the head pin (number-1 pin) spot is the dead wood line, which defines the maximum forward limit that any toppled pins (&quot;wood&quot;) can occupy and still be legally playable (&quot;live wood&quot;).
The ball used in candlepins has a maximum weight of , and has a diameter of , making it the smallest bowling ball of any North American bowling sport. The nearly identical weight of the ball, when compared to that of just one candlepin , causes balls to deflect when impacting either standing or downed pins.

A game of candlepin bowling, often called a string in New England, is divided into ten rounds, each which is most commonly referred to as a box, rather than a &quot;frame&quot; as in tenpin bowling. In each normal box, a player is given up to three opportunities to knock down as many pins as possible. In the final box, three balls are rolled regardless of the pincount, meaning three strikes can be scored in the 10th box.

One unique feature of the candlepin sport is that fallen pins, called wood, are &quot;not&quot; removed from the pin deck area between balls, unlike either the tenpin or duckpin bowling sports. The bowler, before delivering the second or third ball of a box, must also wait until all wood on the deck comes to rest. Depending on where the fallen pins are located on the pindeck and their angle(s) after their movement ceases, the wood can be a major help, or obstacle—partly due to the ball having nearly the same weight as one candlepin—in trying to knock down every single standing pin for either a spare or &quot;ten-box&quot; score in completing a round.

In each of the first nine boxes, play proceeds as follows: The first player bowls his first ball at the pins. The pins he knocks down are counted and scored. Then the player rolls a second and a third ball at any remaining targets. If all ten pins are knocked down with the first ball (a strike), the player receives ten points plus the count on the next two rolls, the pins are cleared, a new set placed. If all ten pins are knocked down with two balls (a spare), the player receives 10 points plus the count of the next ball, pins are cleared and reset. If all three balls are needed to knock all the pins down, the score for that frame is simply ten, and known in New England as a ten-box. If more than one player is playing on the same lane at the same time, bowlers will typically roll two complete boxes before yielding the lane to the next bowler.

In the tenth box, play is similar, except that a player scoring a strike is granted two additional balls, scoring a spare earns one additional ball. Three balls are rolled in the tenth box regardless.

In league play, a bowler may roll two or five boxes at a time, depending on the rules of the league. The five box format is sometimes called a &quot;speed league&quot;, and this format is also typical for tournament play. When a bowler is rolling blocks of five boxes, each period is typically called a &quot;half&quot;.

===Fouls===
A foul (scored by an F on some computer scoring systems) refers to a ball that first rolls into the gutter and then strikes deadwood (felled pins resting in the gutter) or hops out of the gutter and strikes a standing pin, a &quot;lob&quot;-bed ball that touches neither the approach nor lane in the three meters&#x27; distance of lanebed before the lob line, or as in tenpins and duckpins, a roll made when a bowler&#x27;s foot crosses over the foot foul line. Special scoring comes into play.

A foul always scores zero (0) pinfall for that ball&#x27;s delivery. A player may reset the pins after a foul on the first or second ball provided no pins have legally been felled in that box. Therefore, if on the first ball there is a foul or zero, and on the second ball the bowler fouls and knocks down pins, the pins may be reset, allowing the bowler an opportunity to score on their third ball. Knocking down all ten pins after resetting immediately following a foul in the first ball results in a spare. Fouling on all three attempts scores a zero box.

If the first ball knocked down at least one pin, the rack can not be reset because of a subsequent foul. Those pins felled by a foul ball (a ball rolled into the gutter, a lobbed ball, a ball delivered by a bowler over the foot foul line)—whether standing, playable wood, or pins in the gutter—remain down and reduce the maximum number of pins to be counted for the box. Therefore, if there are six pins standing after the first ball, a foul on the next ball that manages to knock down the remaining six pins means that the frame is finished, with a score of 4. However, if the foul ball knocked down only some of the six standing pins, a third ball may still be rolled to attempt to knock down the remaining upright pins. In this example, the raw score might appear to be &quot;4 4 2 = X&quot;, but after adjusting for the foul second ball, the true score is &quot;4 F 2 = 6&quot;. Similar logic holds when rolling two good balls and fouling in the third attempt: the frame is over and only the pins felled in the first two attempts are recorded for the score for that box.

While most candlepin alleys have automated scoring systems, and thus know when to trigger a candlepin pinsetter to clear and reset pins; other alleys, especially older ones that require a manual method to initiate the pinsetter will have a button, or floor-mounted foot pedal switch, to start the pinsetter&#x27;s electrically-powered clearing and resetting of pins. Before the era of the Bowl-Mor powered pinsetter units&#x27; debut in 1949, as with ten-pin, candlepins were set by workers called &quot;pinboys&quot;.

==Scoring==
One point is scored for each pin that is knocked over. So, in a hypothetical game, if player A felled 3 pins with their first ball, then 5 with their second, and 1 with the third, they would receive 9 points for that box. If player B knocks down 9 pins with their first shot, but misses with their second and third, they also score 9.

If a player fells all ten pins in a single box with two or less throws (just as in tenpins) bonuses are awarded for a strike or spare. A strike is achieved with just the first delivery downing all ten pins, with a spare needing two throws, again just as in the tenpin sport. 

In a strike, the bonus for a box adds 10 plus the amount of pins felled by the next two shots. In a spare, the bonus for a box adds 10 plus the amount of pins on the next shot.

If all ten pins are felled by rolling all three balls in a box, the result is a ten-box, marked by an X (as in the Roman numeral for ten) but no additional points are awarded. (In tenpin bowling, a strike is often scored with an X).

Although never achieved, the maximum possible score in a single game/string of candlepins is 300. This is scored by bowling 12 strikes: one in each box, and a strike with both bonus balls in the 10th box. In this way, each box will score 30 points (see above: scoring: strike).

This scoring system, except for the scoring sheet&#x27;s appearance and the graphic symbols used to record strikes, spares and 10-boxes, is identical to that of duckpins, as it is the other major form of bowling that uses three balls per frame.

===Scoring sheet===

The candlepin scoring sheet is different from either tenpins or duckpins, in that it is usually oriented vertically, with two columns of squares in a two-square-wide, ten-square-tall arrangement to score one string for one player. The left-hand column is used to detail the &quot;per-box&quot; score, with the cumulative total recorded down the sheet as each box is rolled in the right-hand column of squares, in a top-down order from the first box to the tenth.

Spares and strikes are also marked uniquely in candlepins. Spares are recorded in a box by coloring in the left upper corner of the appropriate left-hand square (using a triangular shape to &quot;fill-in the corner&quot;). If a strike is recorded, opposing corners of the left-hand square are similarly colored in, while leaving sufficient space between the &quot;filled-in&quot; opposing corners, to record the score from the two succeeding balls&#x27; &quot;fill&quot; total for the strike. A common (albeit unofficial) practice is to mark a strike on a strike&#x27;s bonus ball (double strike) by shading in the remaining two corners of the first strike.

===Calculating scores===
Correct calculation of bonus points can be a bit tricky, especially when combinations of strikes and spares come in successive boxes. In modern times, however, this has been overcome with automated scoring systems. When a scoring system is &quot;automated&quot;, the bowler only has to bowl. It keeps score and will reset the pinsetter after three balls are thrown or all 10 pins have been knocked down. If a scoring system is &quot;semiautomated&quot;, the bowler has to enter the score but the computer will keep track of it. The bowler needs to press a button at the end of the ball return to receive a new &quot;rack&quot; of pins.

== Terminology ==

Many candlepin terms denote combinations of pins left standing after the first ball has been rolled. Examples of these terms include:
;Head pin: The 1-pin, which is in front of the other pins.
;King pin: The 5-pin, which is in the center of the pins, and directly behind the head pin.
;Wood: The fallen pins lying between the standing pins, often strategically used to knock down multiple standing pins which can be far apart.
;Deadwood: Fallen pins lying in the gutter, or on the lane either touching, or to the bowler&#x27;s side of the Deadwood Line. Deadwood on the lane must be removed before the bowler may roll their next ball, while Deadwood in the gutter is left in place. If a delivered ball should strike any Deadwood prior to hitting any wood or standing pins on the lane, then that ball is considered &quot;dead&quot; and any pins felled by it do not count to the bowler&#x27;s score.
;Mark: Spare or strike.
;Four Horsemen: Four pins in a diagonal line, from the head-pin outward; if the 1–2–4–7, it is known as &quot;Four horsemen, left side,&quot; and if the 1–3–6–10, it is known as &quot;Four horsemen, right side.&quot; The usual tenpin term for a spare leave of this kind is a &quot;picket fence&quot; (used for a different spare leave in candlepins) or &quot;clothesline&quot;.
;Spread Eagle: A split configuration consisting of the 2–3–4–6–7–10, caused by the first shot striking the head pin too directly, leading to a failure to scatter the pins. Video of the &quot;spread eagle&quot; being left, then converted
;Diamond: Four pins that form a diamond-shaped configuration, either the 2–4–5–8, known as &quot;left-side diamond,&quot; the 3–5–6–9, known as &quot;right-side diamond&quot;, or the 1–2–3–5, known as the &quot;center diamond&quot; (this same configuration, for any of the three configurations mentioned, is usually referred to as a &quot;bucket&quot; in standard ten-pin bowling, and while it is very difficult to convert into a spare in candlepin bowling, in ten-pin bowling a spare is usually made from it by an experienced bowler).
;Half Worcester: Perhaps the most distinctive term used in the game. This results when the first shot strikes either the 2-pin or 3-pin too directly, and knocks down (or &quot;punches out&quot;) only that pin and the one immediately behind it; when only the 2- and 8-pins fall it is a &quot;Half Worcester Left&quot;, and when only the 3- and 9-pins fall it is a &quot;Half Worcester Right&quot;. According to legend, the term was coined when a team from Worcester and a team from Boston were competing in the semifinal round of a statewide tournament held sometime in the 1940s; late in the last match of the round, needing a mark, one of the bowlers on the Worcester team &quot;punched out&quot; only two such pins with his first ball, prompting a member of the Boston team to taunt him by saying, &quot;You&#x27;re halfway back to Worcester!&quot; It is sometimes said that a player will get &quot;one a game&quot; referring to the Half Worcester.
;Full Worcester: Knocking down 2–3–8–9, or two Half Worcesters.
;Quarter Worcester: Another term derived from the Half Worcester, knocking down half as many pins—either just the 2-pin or just the 3-pin.
;Triple: A three-game series. When spoken, it follows a rough total of the series, such as &quot;500-triple,&quot; meaning the bowler rolled 500 or more for three games. Triple can also refer to three consecutive Strikes rolled by a bowler – other forms of Bowling would call this a &quot;Turkey&quot;.
;Hammer: A strike where all 10 pins are felled in an almost simultaneous fashion.
;Hi-Lo-Jack: A leave of the # 1, 7 and 10 pins. This shot was also set up for both competitors to attempt at the conclusion of the weekly WCVB/WHDH &quot;Candlepin Bowling&quot; program hosted by Don Gillis/Jim Britt which ran from 1958-1996. For each week the shot was not made, the &quot;Hi-Lo-Jackpot&quot; would increase by $25.00.
;Woolworth Split: a leave where only the # 5 and 10 pins remain. This is a reference to the once-ubiquitous &quot;5 and 10&quot; stores found in many towns across the United States.

==In popular culture==

===Literature===
In &quot;The New York Times,&quot; reviewer Cathleen Schine called Elizabeth McCracken&#x27;s 2019 novel &quot;Bowlaway&quot; &quot;a history of New England&#x27;s candlepin bowling&quot;, the sport serving as &quot;the novel&#x27;s unlikely, crashing, arrhythmic &quot;.

===Film===
The 2023 film &quot;The Holdovers&quot; shows the characters playing candlepin bowling.

<text>Lechaina () is a town and a former municipality in Elis, West Greece, Greece. Since the 2011 local government reform it is part of the municipality Andravida-Kyllini, of which it is the seat and a municipal unit. The municipal unit has an area of 94.567 km2. It is situated 39 km north of the city of Pyrgos, and 60 km southwest of Patras.

==Geography==

The area of the municipal unit Lechaina stretches from the flatlands on the Ionian Sea coast to the hills around the Pineios reservoir in the east. The main land use is agriculture. The lagoon Kotychi, connected with the Ionian Sea, is located in the northern part of Lechaina. Lechaina has a railway station on the line Patras-Kalamata. The principal streams are Andravida Creek and Melissos. The Greek National Road 9 Patras-Pylos runs through Lechaina.

===Subdivisions===
The municipal unit Lechaina is subdivided into the following communities (constituent villages in brackets):
==History==
Mid 20th century, an irrigation project increased agricultural production of Lechaina. Forest fires have caused damage in Lechaina, especially in 1993 and 2001. The 2008 Peloponnese earthquake also caused damage in Lechaina.

<doc id="320387" wikidata="Q250123" url="?curid=320387" title="Christine (King novel)">
<text>Christine is a horror novel by American writer Stephen King, published in 1983. It tells the story of a car (a 1958 Plymouth Fury) apparently possessed by malevolent supernatural forces. In April 2013, PS Publishing released &quot;Christine&quot; in a limited 30th Anniversary Edition.

King has said that he got the inspiration for the story one night while driving when he saw the numbers on his car&#x27;s odometer go from 9999.9 to 10,000, which led him to think of the idea of an odometer that ran backwards, thus making the car &quot;younger&quot; instead of older.

==Synopsis==
In the fictional Pittsburgh suburb of Libertyville, Pennsylvania in 1978, nerdy teen Arnold &quot;Arnie&quot; Cunningham and his friend, Dennis Guilder, notice a dilapidated 1958 Plymouth Fury while driving. The car is being sold by Roland D. LeBay, a grouchy old man with a back supporter. Despite Dennis&#x27;s reservations, Arnie buys Christine, as LeBay has named the vehicle, for $250 (). While Arnie finishes the paperwork, Dennis sits inside Christine and has a vision of the car and the surroundings as they existed when the car was new. Frightened, Dennis decides he dislikes Christine. 

Arnie brings Christine to a do-it-yourself garage run by Will Darnell, who is suspected of using the garage as a front for illicit operations. As Arnie restores the car, he stops wearing his eyeglasses and his acne disappears, but he also becomes withdrawn, humorless and cynical. When LeBay dies, Dennis meets his younger brother George, who discusses LeBay&#x27;s history of anger and violence. He reveals that LeBay&#x27;s young daughter choked to death on a hamburger in Christine and that his wife subsequently committed suicide in its front seat by carbon monoxide poisoning.

Dennis observes that Arnie is taking on LeBay&#x27;s personality traits and dressing like a 1950s greaser. Arnie becomes close to Darnell, acting as a courier in Darnell&#x27;s smuggling operations. When Arnie is almost finished restoring Christine, he begins dating an attractive student named Leigh Cabot. His parents force him to keep Christine in an airport parking lot. Clarence &quot;Buddy&quot; Repperton, a bully who blames Arnie for his expulsion from school, learns where Christine is being kept and vandalizes the car with his gang. 

Arnie, aware of Christine&#x27;s ability to repair herself, pushes her through Darnell&#x27;s garage until enough of the damage is undone for her to run, then drives her through the junkyard until she is fully restored. He strains his back in the process and begins wearing a back brace as LeBay did. During a date with Arnie, Leigh nearly chokes to death on a hamburger, saved only by the intervention of a hitchhiker. Leigh notices Christine&#x27;s dashboard lights seem to become glaring green eyes, watching her during the incident, and that Arnie only half-heartedly tries to save her. Believing she and Christine are competing for Arnie&#x27;s affection, Leigh vows to never get into the car again. 

Darnell, Buddy, and all but one of his accomplices in the vandalism are killed in several inexplicable car-related incidents. The police link Christine to each of the murders, but no evidence is found on the car. Rudy Junkins, a police detective, becomes suspicious of Arnie despite his alibis. Christine, possessed by LeBay&#x27;s spirit, is committing these murders and then repairing herself.

Leigh and Dennis begin a relationship while unearthing details of Christine and LeBay&#x27;s past. Dennis speculates that LeBay sacrificed his daughter and wife to make Christine a receptacle for his spirit. Arnie stumbles upon Leigh and Dennis being intimate in Dennis&#x27; car, sending him into a rage. Soon after, Junkins is killed in a car crash. Fearing they are next, Dennis and Leigh devise a plan to destroy the car and save Arnie. 

While Arnie is visiting a college, Dennis and Leigh lure Christine to the garage and batter her to pieces using a septic tanker truck. Dennis witnesses LeBay&#x27;s spirit attempting to make him stop before the wreckage is crushed. Dennis learns that Arnie and his mother were both killed in a highway accident after Christine killed Arnie&#x27;s father. Witness accounts lead Dennis to believe that LeBay&#x27;s spirit, tied to Arnie through Christine, fled the car and attempted to repossess Arnie, but Arnie fought him to a draw, resulting in the wreck.

Four years later, Dennis and Leigh have ended their relationship. He reads about a car accident in Los Angeles, in which a drive-in theater employee—the last surviving member of Buddy&#x27;s gang—was killed by a car that smashed through a cinderblock wall. Dennis speculates that Christine may have rebuilt herself and is setting out to kill everyone who stood against her, saving him for last.

==Reception and adaptations ==
&quot;Christine&quot; has received the Locus Award Nominee for Best Fantasy Novel (1984). The American Library Association named Christine the 95th most banned and challenged book in the United States between 1990 and 1999. Eight months after the release of the novel, a film adaptation was also released in December, directed by John Carpenter. It received generally positive reviews from critics and grossed $21 million at the box office. The film has since become a cult classic. 

While he was promoting the film adaptation of &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; in 2003, Stephen King mentioned &quot;Christine&quot; as one of two film adaptations of his work that had &quot;bored&quot; him, stating: &quot;I may just be the most adapted novelist in modern times... and I don&#x27;t say that with pride so much as with a kind of stunned bemusement. Several honorable adaptations have come from this thirty-year spew of celluloid... and the best of those have had few of the elements I&#x27;m best known for: science fiction, fantasy, the supernatural, and pure gross-out moments... The books that &quot;do&quot; have those elements have, by and large, become films that are either forgettable or outright embarrassing. Others—I&#x27;m thinking chiefly of &quot;Christine&quot; and Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s take on &quot;The Shining&quot;—should have been good but just... well, they just aren&#x27;t. They&#x27;re actually sort of boring. Speaking for myself, I&#x27;d rather have bad than boring.&quot; In June 2021, Sony Pictures Entertainment and Blumhouse Productions announced the development of a remake of the film with Bryan Fuller set to write and direct the film and Jason Blum, Vincenzo Natali and Steve Hoban producing.

<doc id="320393" wikidata="Q2475268" url="?curid=320393" title="Sound symbolism">
<text>In linguistics, sound symbolism is the perceptual similarity between speech sounds and concept meanings. It is a form of linguistic iconicity. For example, the English word &quot;ding&quot; may sound similar to the actual sound of a bell. 

Linguistic sound may be perceived as similar to not only sounds, but also to other sensory properties, such as size, vision, touch, or smell, or abstract domains, such as emotion or value judgment. Such correspondence between linguistic sound and meaning may significantly affect the form of spoken languages.

==History==
===Plato and the Cratylus Dialogue===

In &quot;Cratylus&quot;, Plato has Socrates commenting on the origins and correctness of various names and words. When Hermogenes asks if he can provide another hypothesis on how signs come into being (his own is simply &#x27;convention&#x27;), Socrates initially suggests that they fit their referents in virtue of the sounds they are made of:

However, faced by an overwhelming number of counterexamples given by Hermogenes, Socrates has to admit that &quot;my first notions of original names are truly wild and ridiculous&quot;.

===Upanishads===

The Upanishads and Vyākaraṇa contain a lot of material about sound symbolism, for instance:

The concept of Sphota and Nirukta is also based on this.

===Shingon Buddhism===

Kūkai, the founder of Shingon, wrote his &quot;Sound, word, reality&quot; in the 9th century which relates all sounds to the voice of the Dharmakaya Buddha.

===Early Western phonosemantics===

The idea of phonosemantics was sporadically discussed during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. In 1690, Locke wrote against the idea in &quot;An Essay Concerning Human Understanding&quot;. His argument was that if there were any connection between sounds and ideas, then we would all be speaking the same language, but this is an over-generalisation. Leibniz&#x27;s book &quot;New Essays on Human Understanding&quot; published in 1765 contains a point by point critique of Locke&#x27;s essay. Leibniz picks up on the generalization used by Locke and adopts a less rigid approach: clearly there is no perfect correspondence between words and things, but neither is the relationship completely arbitrary, although he seems vague about what that relationship might be.

===Modern linguistics===

Modern linguistics has been seen as opposing sound symbolism, beginning with Ferdinand de Saussure (1857–1913), considered the founder of modern &#x27;scientific&#x27; linguistics. Central to what de Saussure says about words are two related statements: First, he says that &quot;the sign is arbitrary&quot;. He considers the words that we use to indicate things and concepts could be any words – they are essentially just a consensus agreed upon by the speakers of a language and have no discernible pattern or relationship to the thing. Second, he says that, because words are arbitrary, they have meaning only in relation to other words. A dog is a dog because it is not a cat or a mouse or a horse, etc. These ideas have permeated the study of words since the 19th century.

==Types==
===Onomatopoeia===

Onomatopoeia refers to words that imitate sounds. Some examples in English are &quot;bow-wow&quot; or &quot;meow&quot;, each representing the sound of a dog or a cat.

===Ideophone===

An ideophone is &quot;a member of an open lexical class of marked words that depict sensory imagery&quot;. Unlike onomatopoeia, an ideophone refers to words that depict any sensory domain, such as vision or touch. Examples are Korean &quot;mallang-mallang&quot; 말랑말랑 &#x27;soft&#x27; and Japanese &quot;kira-kira&quot; キラキラ &#x27;shiny&#x27;. Ideophones are heavily present in many African and East/Southeast Asian languages, such as Japanese, Thai, Cantonese and Xhosa. Their form is very often reduplicated, but not necessarily so.

===Phonaesthemes===

A phonaestheme is a sub-morphemic sequence of sounds that are associated to a certain range of meanings. A well-known example is English &quot;gl-&quot;, which is present in many words related to light or vision, such as &quot;gleam&quot;, &quot;glow&quot;, or &quot;glare&quot;. Since it is submorphemic, &quot;gl-&quot; itself is not a morpheme, and it does not form compounds with other morphemes: &quot;-eam&quot;, &quot;-ow&quot;, and &quot;-are&quot; have no meaning of their own. Phonaesthemes, however, are not necessarily iconic, as they may be language-specific and may not iconically resemble the meaning they are associated to.

===Sound symbolism in basic vocabulary===
Blasi et al. (2016), Joo (2020), and Johansson et al. (2020) demonstrated that in the languages around the world, certain concepts in the basic vocabulary (such as the Swadesh list or the Leipzig-Jakarta list) tend to be represented by words containing certain sounds. Below are some of the phonosemantic associations confirmed by the three studies:

=== Magnitude symbolism ===
High front vowels, such as /i/, are known to be perceptually associated to small size, whereas low and/or back vowels, such as /u/ or /a/, are usually associated with big size. This phenomenon is known as magnitude symbolism.

Sapir (1929) showed that, when asked which of the two tables, named &quot;mil&quot; and &quot;mal&quot;, is bigger than the other, many people choose &quot;mal&quot; to be bigger than &quot;mil&quot;. This phenomenon is not only observable in pseudowords, but present throughout English vocabulary as well.

=== Deictic symbolism ===
In many languages, the proximal demonstrative pronoun (&#x27;this&#x27;) tends to have high front vowels (such as /i/), whereas the distal demonstrative pronoun (&#x27;that&#x27;) tends to have low and/or back vowels (such as /u/). Examples include: English &quot;this&quot; and &quot;that&quot;, French &quot;ceci&quot; and &quot;cela&quot;, and Indonesian &quot;ini&quot; and &quot;itu&quot;.

=== Pronominal symbolism ===
First person pronouns (&quot;me&quot;) and second person pronouns (&quot;you&quot;) tend to contain a nasal sound. Joo (2020) suggests that this may be related to the infant&#x27;s tendency of using the nasal sound to seek the attention of the caretaker.

=== Bouba/kiki effect ===

Wolfgang Köhler introduced what is known as the Takete-Maluma phenomenon. When presented two shapes, one being curvy and another being spiky, and asked which one is called &quot;Takete&quot; and which one is called &quot;Maluma&quot;, participants are more likely to associate the name &quot;Takete&quot; to the spiky shape and the name &quot;Maluma&quot; to the curvy shape.

Following Ramachandran and Hubbard in 2001, this phenomenon is now more commonly known as the bouba/kiki effect, and has been demonstrated to be valid across different cultures and languages.

===Tactile sound symbolism===
Bilabial consonants have been demonstrated to be linked to the perception of softness, arguably due to the soft texture of human lips.

The is frequent in words for &#x27;rough&#x27; while infrequent in words for &#x27;smooth&#x27;.

==Use in commerce==
Sound symbolism is used in commerce for the names of products and even companies themselves. For example, a car company may be interested in how to name their car to make it sound faster or stronger. Furthermore, sound symbolism can be used to create a meaningful relationship between a company&#x27;s brand name and the brand mark itself. Sound symbolism can relate to the color, shade, shape, and size of the brand mark.

<text>Gaius Helen Mohiam is a fictional character in the &quot;Dune&quot; universe created by Frank Herbert. She is a Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother, and initially appears in the 1963–65 novel &quot;Dune&quot; and its 1969 sequel, &quot;Dune Messiah&quot;. Mohiam also has a major role in the &quot;Prelude to Dune&quot; prequel trilogy (1999–2001) and the &quot;Caladan Trilogy&quot; (2020–2022) by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson.

In &quot;Dune&quot;, Gaius Helen Mohiam is the Imperial Truthsayer, and the mentor of Lady Jessica, the Bene Gesserit concubine of Duke Leto Atreides. Mohiam is interested in Jessica&#x27;s young son Paul Atreides, who is a key figure in the Bene Gesserit breeding program but has also displayed unusual potential. She ultimately loses any influence she may have had over Jessica or Paul, who ally themselves with the native Fremen of Arrakis and depose Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV. In &quot;Dune Messiah&quot;, Mohiam joins a conspiracy to remove Paul from power, which fails.

Gaius Helen Mohiam is portrayed by Siân Phillips in David Lynch&#x27;s 1984 film &quot;Dune&quot;, by Zuzana Geislerová in the 2000 miniseries &quot;Frank Herbert&#x27;s Dune&quot; and its 2003 sequel &quot;Frank Herbert&#x27;s Children of Dune&quot;, and by Charlotte Rampling in the 2021 Denis Villeneuve film &quot;Dune&quot; and its 2024 .

==Description==
In the novel &quot;Dune&quot;, the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen has this impression of Gaius Helen Mohiam:
In &quot;Dune Messiah&quot;, Herbert notes that Mohiam&#x27;s eyes are &quot;dark with the blue brilliance of her melange addiction.&quot;

Novelist Brian Herbert, Frank Herbert&#x27;s son and biographer, describes Mohiam as &quot;a witch mother archetype&quot;.

==Appearances==
===&quot;Dune&quot;===

As &quot;Dune&quot; begins, the &quot;old crone&quot; Reverend Mother Mohiam comes to Caladan to &quot;test&quot; young Paul Atreides before he departs for Arrakis. Having trained Paul&#x27;s mother Lady Jessica at the Bene Gesserit school on Wallach IX decades before, Mohiam now holds a lethal gom jabbar to Paul&#x27;s neck. If he withdraws his hand from a box that inflicts pain through direct nerve induction, the gom jabbar will kill him instantly. Mohiam explains to Paul that the purpose of the test is to discover whether Paul is &quot;truly human&quot;, by requiring him to endure pain and still act rationally. He passes the test, and Mohiam (though still furious over Jessica&#x27;s choice to disobey the Sisterhood and bear a son instead of a daughter) is somewhat intrigued by the potential she sees in 15-year-old Paul, as she notes he has survived more pain than any other Bene Gesserit inductee.

Later, Mohiam accompanies Emperor Shaddam IV to Arrakis in her role as Imperial Truthsayer; there she is faced with Paul&#x27;s four-year-old sister, the pre-born Alia, whom she calls an Abomination. Mohiam is further alarmed as she witnesses the ritual battle-to-the-death between Paul and Feyd-Rautha. Paul calls Feyd &quot;cousin,&quot; revealing that Paul is aware of the secret that Baron Harkonnen is his grandfather. But Mohiam is most concerned with the potential outcome of the duel, which could prove to be &quot;a major catastrophe for the Bene Gesserit breeding scheme.&quot; She realizes that &quot;Two end products of this long and costly program faced each other in a fight to the death that might easily claim both of them. If both died here that would leave only Feyd-Rautha&#x27;s bastard daughter, still a baby, an unknown, an unmeasured factor, and Alia, the Abomination.&quot;

Paul is victorious; seeing the inevitability of the situation he has orchestrated, Mohiam compels Shaddam to give in to Paul&#x27;s demands, allowing Paul to depose him and become Emperor in his place.

===&quot;Dune Messiah&quot;===
In &quot;Dune Messiah&quot;, the Reverend Mother joins the conspiracy to topple the rule of Paul Atreides after he ascends the Golden Lion Throne and unleashes his Jihad upon the Empire. She, along with the Tleilaxu Face Dancer Scytale, the Spacing Guild Navigator Edric, and Paul&#x27;s embittered consort (and Shaddam&#x27;s daughter) Princess Irulan of House Corrino, plot to insinuate the Tleilaxu ghola Hayt into the court to weaken Paul&#x27;s confidence in his prescience and thereby ruin him.

Forbidden to ever return to Arrakis, Mohiam is taken into Paul&#x27;s custody when it becomes known that she is on a heighliner in orbit above the planet. Aware of the Bene Gesserit&#x27;s desire to acquire his genetic material for their breeding program, Paul seeks to negotiate with Mohiam. In exchange for the guaranteed safety of his concubine Chani, and the Sisterhood&#x27;s acceptance of his decision to father no heirs with Irulan, Paul offers something of the utmost value: his sperm. This is a complicated proposition for Mohiam, however, because artificial insemination is forbidden in the wake of the Butlerian Jihad.

When the conspiracy ultimately fails and Scytale is killed, Edric is executed in 10,207 A.G. by Fremen Naib Stilgar, on orders from Alia. Stilgar also puts Mohiam to death, despite previous orders from Paul to spare her life.

===&quot;Prelude to Dune&quot;===
In the &quot;Prelude to Dune&quot; series, Mohiam is instructed by the Bene Gesserit to collect the genetic material of Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (through conception) for their breeding program. She blackmails the homosexual Baron into fathering a child with her. When that daughter proves genetically undesirable, Mohiam kills it and then returns to Harkonnen for a second try, at which point he drugs and rapes her. She exacts her retribution by infecting him with a disease that later causes his obesity. Though Mohiam kills her first child with Harkonnen, their second child is Jessica, Harkonnen&#x27;s paternity having been previously established in &quot;Dune&quot;.

According to Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson, the idea that Mohiam is Jessica&#x27;s mother was pulled directly from Frank Herbert&#x27;s working notes for the original &quot;Dune&quot; series. To this end, they establish that the name given for Jessica&#x27;s mother in &quot;Dune&quot;, Tanidia Nerus, is an alias used by Mohiam to conceal Jessica&#x27;s maternity.

==In adaptations==
Mohiam is portrayed by Siân Phillips in David Lynch&#x27;s 1984 film &quot;Dune&quot;, and by Zuzana Geislerová in the 2000 miniseries &quot;Frank Herbert&#x27;s Dune&quot; and its 2003 sequel &quot;Frank Herbert&#x27;s Children of Dune&quot;. The character is played by Charlotte Rampling in the 2021 Denis Villeneuve film &quot;Dune&quot; and its 2024 sequel &quot;&quot;.

All three portrayals received positive reviews in contemporary press. &quot;Variety&quot; wrote of the 1984 film that &quot;Siân Phillips has some mesmerizing moments as a powerful witch&quot;. Phillips said that she and Lynch both independently came up with the idea for her character&#x27;s distinctive bald appearance. &quot;Tor.com&quot; noted of &quot;Children of Dune&quot;, &quot;There are other moments of perfect execution ... The dual conversations between Irulan and Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam—and later Jessica—are gorgeous, offering subtitles to their sign language while an entirely different conversation plays out in words.&quot; &quot;Screen Rant&quot; called Rampling&#x27;s Mohiam in the 2021 film &quot;Dune&quot; &quot;one of the movie&#x27;s more intimidating characters&quot;, and &quot;The Telegraph&quot; described her as &quot;blood-chilling&quot;. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that Rampling &quot;is the only actor living who can project both world-weary wisdom and utter ruthlessness while wearing an absurdly high hat and a nearly impenetrable black veil ... her relationship with acolyte Lady Jessica plays a bit like a perpetually skeptical head of the CIA dealing with an exasperating but productive rogue agent.&quot;

<doc id="320395" wikidata="Q1805183" url="?curid=320395" title="List of postcode areas in the United Kingdom">
<text>This is a list of postcode areas, used by Royal Mail for the purposes of directing mail within the United Kingdom. The postcode area is the largest geographical unit used and forms the initial characters of the alphanumeric UK postcode. There are currently 121 geographic postcode areas in use in the UK and a further three often combined with these covering the Crown Dependencies of Guernsey, Jersey and Isle of Man.

==Subdivision==
Each postcode area is further divided into post towns and postcode districts. There are on average 20 postcode districts to a postcode area, with ZE having the lowest (3) and BT the highest (81). The London post town is instead divided into several postcode areas.

==Scope==
The single or pair of letters chosen for postcode areas are generally intended as a mnemonic for the places served. Postcode areas, post towns and postcode districts do not follow political or local authority administrative boundaries and usually serve much larger areas than the place names with which they are associated. Many post towns are former &quot;county towns&quot; but postcode areas rarely align with the county (or successor authority) area. For example, within the PA postcode area the PA1 and PA78 postcode districts are apart, and cover 5 local authority areas; and the eight postcode areas of the London post town cover only 40% of Greater London. The remainder of its area is covered by sections of twelve adjoining postcode areas: EN, IG, RM, DA, BR, TN, CR, SM, KT, TW, HA and UB.

==United Kingdom postcode areas==


==Crown dependencies==
The Crown dependencies (which are not part of the United Kingdom) did not introduce postcodes until later, but use a similar coding scheme. They are separate postal authorities.

==Defunct postcode areas==
===London NE and S===
===Glasgow===
Glasgow, like London, was divided into compass districts: C, W, NW, N, E, SE, S, SW. When postcodes were introduced, these were mapped into the new &quot;G&quot; postcode: C1 became G1, W1 became G11, N1 became G21, E1 became G31, S1 became G41, SW1 became G51, and so on. As NW and SE had never been subdivided they became G20 and G40 respectively.

===Norwich and Croydon===
Norwich and Croydon were used for a postcode experiment in the late 1960s, which was replaced by the current system. The format was of the form NOR or CRO followed by two numbers and a letter, e.g. NOR 07A. They were later changed to CR0 (digit &#x27;0&#x27;) and NR1.

===Dublin, Ireland===
When Ireland was a part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland a postal district system was introduced in 1917 by the UK government. The letter &quot;D&quot; was assigned to Dublin. Upon the establishment of the Irish Free State and later, the Republic of Ireland, the Irish government retained the designation and today it forms part of the Eircode system, a postcode format slightly different from the UK format and identifying individual addresses. Since Irish independence, &quot;D&quot; has never been reassigned as a postcode area in the UK.

==Non-geographic postcodes==
=== Types ===
Some postcode areas do not correspond to geographical areas. They can be - (a) postcode areas with no geographic link (for use by Large Volume Receivers (&quot;bulk mail&quot;, with delivery options determined between the LVR and Royal Mail) and these can for general mail or specific functions (e.g. parcel returns; centralised scanning of mail); (b) non-geographic postcode districts or sectors contained within geographic postcode areas (for LVRs or PO Boxes); and (c) specific purpose postcodes. 

=== Numbering of non-geographic postcode districts ===
For those within geographic postcode areas, the first two numbers can be any number though they are generally larger than the numbers allocated to geographic districts. Some fall within the range 91 to 99 (e.g. S98 for payments to MNBA Ltd; NE98 for Department for Work and Pensions, Central Office, Newcastle-upon-Tyne). However, there are many exceptions to this - e.g. American Express has the postcode area BN88; in Glasgow G58 1SB is allocated to National Savings, formerly National Savings Bank, as a mnemonic (SB, and with 58 looking like SB), though it is located in the G43 postcode district; and in Glasgow G70 is allocated to HMRC which is located in G67. Some are in fact geographic e.g. EH99 1SP for the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh.

===BF===
The BF postcode area was introduced in 2012 to provide optional postcodes for British Forces Post Office addresses, for consistency with the layout of other UK addresses. It uses the national non-geographic post town &quot;BFPO&quot; and, as of 2012, the postcode district &quot;BF1&quot;. Each BFPO number is assigned an inward code, which are grouped as: 0 - Germany, 1 - UK, 2 - Rest of Europe, 3 - Rest of World, 4 - Ships and Naval Parties, 5 - Rest of World, Operations and Exercises, 6 - Rest of World, Operations and Exercises.

===BX===
The non-geographic postcode area BX has been introduced for addresses which do not include a locality; this allows large organisations long-term flexibility as to where they receive their mail. This postcode area is used by Lloyds Banking Group (BX1 1LT), HSBC (BX8 0HB) and parts of HM Revenue and Customs like VAT (BX5 5AT) and Pay As You Earn (BX9 1AS). Lloyds Bank also use BX4. After splitting from Lloyds, TSB Bank uses BX4 7SB, the latter part of which, when written, looks similar to &quot;TSB&quot;.

===GIR===
GIR 0AA is a postcode created for Girobank in Bootle. It remained in use by its successors when Girobank was taken over by Alliance &amp; Leicester and subsequently by Santander UK.

===XM===
XM4 5HQ is a postcode created for letters sent to Santa Claus or Father Christmas (with XM4 5HQ resembling &quot;XMAS&quot;).

===XX===
The non-geographic postcode area XX is used by online retailers for returns by Royal Mail, and was used for COVID-19 test samples.

==Overseas territories==
Certain British Overseas Territories introduced single postal codes for their territory or major sub-sections of it. These are not UK postcodes, even though many are formatted in a similar fashion:

Other overseas territories have introduced their own more extensive postcode systems:
Civilian residential and business addresses in Akrotiri and Dhekelia are served by Cyprus Postal Services and use Cypriot postal codes.

Mail to Overseas Territories is treated as international if posted in the UK.

<text>Barton Fink is a 1991 American black comedy thriller film written, produced, edited and directed by the Coen brothers. Set in 1941, it stars John Turturro in the title role as a young New York City playwright who is hired to write scripts for a film studio in Hollywood, and John Goodman as Charlie Meadows, the insurance salesman who lives next door at the run-down Hotel Earle.

The Coens wrote the screenplay for &quot;Barton Fink&quot; in three weeks while experiencing writer&#x27;s block during the writing of &quot;Miller&#x27;s Crossing&quot;. They began filming soon after &quot;Miller&#x27;s Crossing&quot; was finished. The film is influenced by works of several earlier directors, particularly Roman Polanski&#x27;s &quot;Repulsion&quot; (1965) and &quot;The Tenant&quot; (1976).

&quot;Barton Fink&quot; had its premiere at the Cannes Film Festival in May 1991. In a rare sweep, it won the Palme d&#x27;Or as well as awards for Best Director and Best Actor (Turturro). Although the film was a box office bomb, only grossing $6 million against its $9 million budget, it received positive reviews and was nominated for three Academy Awards.

Prominent themes of &quot;Barton Fink&quot; include the writing process; slavery and conditions of labor in creative industries; superficial distinctions between high culture and low culture; and the relationship of intellectuals with &quot;the common man&quot;. The diverse elements of the film have led it to defy efforts at genre classification, with the work being variously referred to as a film noir, a horror film, a &quot;Künstlerroman&quot;, a postmodernist film and a buddy film. It contains various literary allusions and religious overtones, as well as references to many real-life people and events – most notably the writers Clifford Odets and William Faulkner, of whom the characters of Barton Fink and W. P. Mayhew, respectively, are often seen as fictional representations. Several features of the film&#x27;s narrative, particularly an image of a woman at the beach which recurs throughout, have sparked much commentary, with the Coens acknowledging some intentional symbolic elements while denying an attempt to communicate any single message in the film.

== Plot ==

In 1941, up-and-coming Broadway playwright Barton Fink accepts a contract from Capitol Pictures in Hollywood to write film scripts for a thousand dollars per week. Upon moving to Los Angeles, Fink settles into the cheap Hotel Earle. His room&#x27;s only decoration is a small painting of a woman on the beach, arm raised to block the sun. Fink is assigned to a wrestling film by his new boss Jack Lipnick, but he finds difficulty in writing for the unfamiliar subject. He is distracted by sounds coming from the room next door, and he phones the front desk to alert them of the disturbing sounds. His neighbor, Charlie Meadows, the source of the noise, visits Fink to apologize. During their conversation, Fink proclaims his affection for &quot;the common man&quot;, and Meadows describes his life as an insurance salesman.
Still unable to proceed beyond the first lines of his script, Fink consults producer Ben Geisler for advice. Irritated, the frenetic Geisler takes him to lunch and orders him to consult another writer for assistance. Fink meets the novelist W. P. Mayhew by chance in the bathroom. They briefly discuss movie-writing and arrange a second meeting later in the day. Fink later learns from Mayhew&#x27;s secretary, Audrey Taylor, that Mayhew suffers from alcoholism and that Taylor ghostwrote some of his scripts. With one day left before his meeting with Lipnick to discuss the film, Fink phones Taylor and begs her for assistance. Taylor visits him at the Earle and they have sex. Fink awakens the next morning to find that Taylor has been violently murdered. Horrified, he summons Meadows and asks for help. Meadows is repulsed but disposes of the body and orders Fink to avoid contacting the police.

After Fink has a meeting with an unusually supportive Lipnick, Meadows announces to Fink that he is going to New York for several days, and asks him to watch over a package he is leaving behind. Soon afterwards, Fink is visited by two police detectives, who inform him that Meadows&#x27;s real name is Karl &quot;Madman&quot; Mundt. Mundt is a serial killer whose &quot;modus operandi&quot; is beheading his victims. Stunned, Fink places the box on his desk without opening it and he begins writing feverishly. Fink produces the entire script in one sitting and he goes out for a night of celebratory dancing, returning to find the detectives in his room, who inform him of Mayhew&#x27;s murder and accuse Fink of complicity with Mundt.

As the hotel is suddenly engulfed in flames, Mundt appears and kills the detectives with a shotgun, after which he mentions that he had paid a visit to Fink&#x27;s parents and uncle in New York. Fink leaves the still-burning hotel, carrying the box and his script. Shortly thereafter he attempts to telephone his family, but there is no answer. In a final meeting with Lipnick, who has been conscripted by the United States Army Reserve to serve as a colonel in the Second World War, Fink&#x27;s script (which is suggested to be a nearly word-for-word copy of the Broadway play shown in the opening scene) is lambasted as &quot;a fruity movie about suffering&quot;, and he is informed that he is to remain in Los Angeles; although Fink will remain under contract, Capitol Pictures will not produce anything he writes until he &quot;grows up a little&quot;. Dazed, Fink wanders onto a beach, still carrying the package. He meets a woman who looks just like the one in the picture on his wall at the Earle, and she asks about the box. He tells her he does not know what it contains nor who owns it. He asks her if she has ever been in pictures, and she says no, with perceptible disinterest. She then assumes the pose from the picture on the hotel room wall.

== Production ==

=== Background and writing ===
In 1989, filmmakers Joel and Ethan Coen began writing the script for a film eventually released as &quot;Miller&#x27;s Crossing&quot;. The many threads of the story became complicated, and after four months they found themselves lost in the process. Although biographers and critics later referred to it as writer&#x27;s block, the Coen brothers rejected this description. &quot;It&#x27;s not really the case that we were suffering from writer&#x27;s block,&quot; Joel said in a 1991 interview, &quot;but our working speed had slowed, and we were eager to get a certain distance from &quot;Miller&#x27;s Crossing&quot;.&quot; They went from Los Angeles to New York and began work on a different project.
In three weeks, the Coens wrote a script with a title role written specifically for actor John Turturro, with whom they&#x27;d been working on &quot;Miller&#x27;s Crossing&quot;. The new film, &quot;Barton Fink&quot;, was set in a large, seemingly abandoned hotel. This setting, which they named the &quot;Hotel Earle&quot;, was a driving force behind the story and mood of the new project. While filming their 1984 film &quot;Blood Simple&quot; in Austin, Texas, the Coens had seen a hotel which made a significant impression: &quot;We thought, &#x27;Wow, Motel Hell.&#x27; You know, being condemned to live in the weirdest hotel in the world.&quot;

The writing process for &quot;Barton Fink&quot; was smooth, they said, suggesting that the relief of being away from &quot;Miller&#x27;s Crossing&quot; may have been a catalyst. They also felt satisfied with the overall shape of the story, which helped them move quickly through the composition. &quot;Certain films come entirely in one&#x27;s head; we just sort of burped out &quot;Barton Fink&quot;.&quot; While writing, the Coens created a second leading role with another actor in mind: John Goodman, who had appeared in their 1987 comedy &quot;Raising Arizona&quot;. His new character, Charlie, was Barton&#x27;s next-door neighbor in the cavernous hotel. Even before writing, the Coens knew how the story would end, and wrote Charlie&#x27;s final speech at the start of the writing process.

The script served its diversionary purpose, and the Coens put it aside: &quot;&quot;Barton Fink&quot; sort of washed out our brain and we were able to go back and finish &quot;Miller&#x27;s Crossing&quot;.&quot; Once production of the first film was finished, the Coens began to recruit staff to film &quot;Barton Fink&quot;. Turturro looked forward to playing the lead role, and spent a month with the Coens in Los Angeles to coordinate views on the project: &quot;I felt I could bring something more human to Barton. Joel and Ethan allowed me a certain contribution. I tried to go a little further than they expected.&quot;

As they designed detailed storyboards for &quot;Barton Fink&quot;, the Coens began looking for a new cinematographer, since their associate Barry Sonnenfeld – who had filmed their first three features – was occupied with his own directorial debut, &quot;The Addams Family&quot;. The Coens had been impressed with the work of English cinematographer Roger Deakins, particularly the interior scenes of the 1988 film &quot;Stormy Monday&quot;. After screening other films he had worked on (including &quot;Sid and Nancy&quot; and &quot;Pascali&#x27;s Island&quot;), they sent a script to Deakins and invited him to join the project. His agent advised against working with the Coens, but Deakins met with them at a café in Notting Hill and they soon began working together on &quot;Barton Fink&quot;.

=== Filming ===

Principal photography began in June 1990 and took eight weeks (a third less time than required by &quot;Miller&#x27;s Crossing&quot;), and the estimated final budget for the film was US$9 million. The Coens worked well with Deakins, and they easily translated their ideas for each scene onto film. &quot;There was only one moment we surprised him,&quot; Joel Coen recalled later. An extended scene called for a tracking shot out of the bedroom and into a sink drain &quot;plug hole&quot; in the adjacent bathroom as a symbol of sexual intercourse. &quot;The shot was a lot of fun and we had a great time working out how to do it,&quot; Joel said. &quot;After that, every time we asked Roger to do something difficult, he would raise an eyebrow and say, &#x27;Don&#x27;t be having me track down any plug-holes now.&#x27;&quot;

Three weeks of filming were spent in the Hotel Earle, a set created by art director Dennis Gassner. The film&#x27;s climax required a huge spreading fire in the hotel&#x27;s hallway, which the Coens originally planned to add digitally in post-production. When they decided to use real flames, however, the crew built a large alternative set in an abandoned aircraft hangar in Long Beach, California. A series of gas jets was installed behind the hallway, and the wallpaper was perforated for easy penetration. As Goodman ran through the hallway, a man on an overhead catwalk opened each jet, giving the impression of a fire racing ahead of Charlie. Each take required a rebuild of the apparatus, and a second hallway (sans fire) stood ready nearby for filming pick-up shots between takes. The final scene was shot near Zuma Beach, as was the image of a wave crashing against a rock.

The Coens edited the film themselves, as is their custom. &quot;We prefer a hands-on approach,&quot; Joel explained in 1996, &quot;rather than sitting next to someone and telling them what to cut.&quot; Because of rules for membership in film production guilds, they are required to use a pseudonym; &quot;Roderick Jaynes&quot; is credited with editing &quot;Barton Fink&quot;. Only a few filmed scenes were removed from the final cut, including a transition scene to show Barton&#x27;s movement from New York to Hollywood. (In the film, this is shown enigmatically with a wave crashing against a rock.) Several scenes representing work in Hollywood studios were also filmed, but edited out because they were &quot;too conventional&quot;.

=== Setting ===

There is a sharp contrast between Fink&#x27;s living quarters and the polished, pristine environs of Hollywood, especially the home of Jack Lipnick. The spooky, inexplicably empty feel of the Hotel Earle was central to the Coens&#x27; conception of the film. &quot;We wanted an art deco stylization,&quot; Joel explained in a 1991 interview, &quot;and a place that was falling into ruin after having seen better days.&quot; Barton&#x27;s room is sparsely furnished with two large windows facing another building. The Coens later described the hotel as a &quot;ghost ship floating adrift, where you notice signs of the presence of other passengers, without ever laying eyes on any.&quot; In the film, residents&#x27; shoes are an indication of this unseen presence; another rare sign of other inhabitants is the sound from adjacent rooms. Joel said: &quot;You can imagine it peopled by failed commercial travelers, with pathetic sex lives, who cry alone in their rooms.&quot;

Heat and moisture are other important elements of the setting. The wallpaper in Barton&#x27;s room peels and droops; Charlie experiences the same problem and guesses heat is the cause. The Coens used green and yellow colors liberally in designing the hotel &quot;to suggest an aura of putrefaction.&quot;

The atmosphere of the hotel was meant to connect with the character of Charlie. As Joel explained: &quot;Our intention, moreover, was that the hotel function as an exteriorization of the character played by John Goodman. The sweat drips off his forehead like the wallpaper peels off the walls. At the end, when Goodman says that he is a prisoner of his own mental state, that this is like some kind of hell, it was necessary for the hotel to have already suggested something infernal.&quot; The peeling wallpaper and the paste which seeps through it also mirror Charlie&#x27;s chronic ear infection and the resultant pus.

When Barton first arrives at the Hotel Earle, he is asked by the friendly bellhop, Chet, (Steve Buscemi) if he is &quot;a trans or a res&quot; – transient or resident. Barton explains that he isn&#x27;t sure but will be staying &quot;indefinitely.&quot; The dichotomy between permanent inhabitants and guests reappears several times, notably in the hotel&#x27;s motto, &quot;A day or a lifetime,&quot; which Barton notices on the room&#x27;s stationery. This idea returns at the end of the film, when Charlie describes Barton as &quot;a tourist with a typewriter.&quot; His ability to leave the Earle (while Charlie remains) is presented by critic Erica Rowell as evidence that Barton&#x27;s story represents the process of writing itself. Barton, she says, represents an author who is able to leave a story, while characters like Charlie cannot.
In contrast, the offices of Capitol Pictures and Lipnick&#x27;s house are pristine, lavishly decorated, and extremely comfortable. The company&#x27;s rooms are bathed in sunlight and Ben Geisler&#x27;s office faces a lush array of flora. Barton meets Lipnick in one scene beside an enormous, spotless swimming pool. This echoes his position as studio head, as he explains: &quot;...you can&#x27;t always be honest, not with the sharks swimming around this town ... if I&#x27;d been totally honest, I wouldn&#x27;t be within a mile of this pool – unless I was cleaning it.&quot; In his office, Lipnick showcases another trophy of his power: statues of Atlas, the Titan of Greek mythology who declared war on the gods of Mount Olympus and was severely punished.

Barton watches dailies from another wrestling film being made by Capitol Pictures; the date on the clapperboard is December 9, two days after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Later, when Barton celebrates the completed script by dancing at a USO show, he is surrounded by soldiers. In Lipnick&#x27;s next appearance, he wears a colonel&#x27;s uniform, which is really a costume from his company. Lipnick has not actually entered the military but declares himself ready to fight the &quot;little yellow bastards.&quot; Originally, this historical moment just after the United States entered World War II was to have a significant impact on the Hotel Earle. As the Coens explained: &quot;[W]e were thinking of a hotel where the lodgers were old people, the insane, the physically handicapped, because all the others had left for the war. The further the script was developed, the more this theme got left behind, but it had led us, in the beginning, to settle on that period.&quot;

==== The Picture ====

The picture in Barton&#x27;s room of a woman at the beach is a central focus for both the character and camera. He examines it frequently while at his desk and after finding Audrey&#x27;s corpse in his bed he goes to stand near it. The image is repeated at the end of the film, when he meets an identical-looking woman at an identical-looking beach, who strikes an identical pose. After complimenting her beauty, he asks her: &quot;Are you in pictures?&quot; She blushes and replies: &quot;Don&#x27;t be silly.&quot;

The Coens decided early in the writing process to include the picture as a key element in the room. &quot;Our intention,&quot; Joel explained later, &quot;was that the room would have very little decoration, that the walls would be bare and that the windows would offer no view of any particular interest. In fact, we wanted the only opening on the exterior world to be this picture. It seemed important to us to create a feeling of isolation.&quot;

Later in the film, Barton places into the frame a small picture of Charlie, dressed in a fine suit and holding a briefcase. The juxtaposition of his neighbor in the uniform of an insurance salesman and the escapist image of the woman on the beach leads to a confusion of reality and fantasy for Barton. Critic Michael Dunne notes: &quot;[V]iewers can only wonder how &#x27;real&#x27; Charlie is. ... In the film&#x27;s final shot ... viewers must wonder how &#x27;real&#x27; [the woman] is. The question leads to others: How real is Fink? Lipnick? Audrey? Mayhew? How real are films anyway?&quot;

The picture&#x27;s significance has been the subject of broad speculation. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reviewer Desson Howe said that despite its emotional impact, the final scene &quot;feels more like a punchline for punchline&#x27;s sake, a trumped-up coda.&quot; In her book-length analysis of the Coen brothers&#x27; films, Rowell suggests that Barton&#x27;s fixation on the picture is ironic, considering its low culture status and his own pretensions toward high culture (speeches to the contrary notwithstanding). She further notes that the camera focuses on Barton himself as much as the picture while he gazes at it. At one point, the camera moves past Barton to fill the frame with the woman on the beach. This tension between objective and subjective points of view appears again at the end of the film, when Barton finds himself – in a sense – inside the picture.

Critic M. Keith Booker calls the final scene an &quot;enigmatic comment on representation and the relationship between art and reality.&quot; He suggests that the identical images point to the absurdity of art which reflects life directly. The film transposes the woman directly from art to reality, prompting confusion in the viewer; Booker asserts that such a literal depiction therefore leads inevitably to uncertainty.

== Genre ==
The Coens are known for making films that defy simple classification. Although they refer to their first film, &quot;Blood Simple&quot; (1984), as a relatively straightforward example of detective fiction, the Coens wrote their next script, &quot;Raising Arizona&quot; (1987), without trying to fit a particular genre. They decided to write a comedy but intentionally added dark elements to produce what Ethan calls &quot;a pretty savage film.&quot; Their third film, &quot;Miller&#x27;s Crossing&quot; (1990), reversed this order, mixing bits of comedy into a crime film. Yet it also subverts single-genre identity by using conventions from melodrama, love stories, and political satire.

This trend of mixing genres continued and intensified with &quot;Barton Fink&quot; (1991); the Coens insist the film &quot;does not belong to any genre.&quot; Ethan has described it as &quot;a buddy movie for the &#x27;90s.&quot; It contains elements of comedy, film noir, and horror, but other film categories are present. Actor Turturro referred to it as a coming of age story while literature professor and film analyst R. Barton Palmer calls it a &quot;Künstlerroman&quot;, highlighting the importance of the main character&#x27;s evolution as a writer. Critic Donald Lyons describes the film as &quot;a retro-surrealist vision.&quot;

Because it crosses genres, fragments the characters&#x27; experiences, and resists straightforward narrative resolution, &quot;Barton Fink&quot; is often considered an example of postmodernist film. In his book &quot;Postmodern Hollywood,&quot; Booker says the film renders the past with an impressionist technique, not a precise accuracy. This technique, he notes, is &quot;typical of postmodern film, which views the past not as the prehistory of the present but as a warehouse of images to be raided for material.&quot; In his analysis of the Coens&#x27; films, Palmer calls &quot;Barton Fink&quot; a &quot;postmodern pastiche&quot; which closely examines how past eras have represented themselves. He compares it to &quot;The Hours&quot; (2002), a film about Virginia Woolf and two women who read her work. He asserts that both films, far from rejecting the importance of the past, add to our understanding of it. He quotes literary theorist Linda Hutcheon: the kind of postmodernism exhibited in these films &quot;does not deny the &quot;existence&quot; of the past; it does question whether we can ever &quot;know&quot; that past other than through its textualizing remains.&quot;

Certain elements in &quot;Barton Fink&quot; highlight the veneer of postmodernism: the writer is unable to resolve his modernist focus on high culture with the studio&#x27;s desire to create formulaic high-profit films; the resulting collision produces a fractured story arc emblematic of postmodernism. The Coens&#x27; cinematic style is another example; when Barton and Audrey begin making love, the camera pans away to the bathroom, then moves toward the sink and down its drain. Rowell calls this a &quot;postmodern update&quot; of the notorious sexually suggestive image of a train entering a tunnel, used by director Alfred Hitchcock in his film &quot;North by Northwest.&quot;

== Style ==
&quot;Barton Fink&quot; uses several stylistic conventions to accentuate the story&#x27;s mood and give visual emphasis to particular themes. For example, the opening credits roll over the Hotel Earle&#x27;s wallpaper, as the camera moves downward. This motion is repeated many times in the film, especially pursuant to Barton&#x27;s claim that his job is to &quot;plumb the depths&quot; while writing. His first experiences in the Hotel Earle continue this trope; the bellhop Chet emerges from beneath the floor, carrying a shoe (which he has presumably been polishing) suggesting the real activity is underground. Although Barton&#x27;s floor is presumably six floors above the lobby, the interior of the elevator is shown only while it is descending. These elements – combined with many dramatic pauses, surreal dialogue, and implied threats of violence – create an atmosphere of extreme tension. The Coens explained that &quot;the whole movie was supposed to feel like impending doom or catastrophe. And we definitely wanted it to end with an apocalyptic feeling.&quot;

The style of &quot;Barton Fink&quot; is evocative and representative of films of the 1930s and 1940s. As critic Michael Dunne points out: &quot;Fink&#x27;s heavy overcoat, his hat, his dark, drab suits come realistically out of the Thirties, but they come even more out of the films of the Thirties.&quot; The style of the Hotel Earle and atmosphere of various scenes also reflect the influence of pre-World War II film-making. Even Charlie&#x27;s underwear matches that worn by his filmic hero Jack Oakie. At the same time, camera techniques used by the Coens in &quot;Barton Fink&quot; represent a combination of the classic with the original. Careful tracking shots and extreme close-ups distinguish the film as a product of the late 20th century.

From the start, the film moves continuously between Barton&#x27;s subjective view of the world and one which is objective. After the opening credits roll, the camera tilts down to Barton, watching the end of his play. Soon we see the audience from his point of view, cheering wildly for him. As he walks forward, he enters the shot and the viewer is returned to an objective point of view. This blurring of the subjective and objective returns in the final scene.

The shifting point of view coincides with the film&#x27;s subject matter: film-making. The film begins with the end of a play, and the story explores the process of creation. This metanarrative approach is emphasized by the camera&#x27;s focus in the first scene on Barton (who is mouthing the words spoken by actors offscreen), not on the play he is watching. As Rowell says: &quot;[T]hough we listen to one scene, we watch another. ... The separation of sound and picture shows a crucial dichotomy between two &#x27;views&#x27; of artifice: the world created by the protagonist (his play) and the world outside it (what goes into creating a performance).&quot;

The film also employs numerous foreshadowing techniques. Signifying the probable contents of the package Charlie leaves with Barton, the word &quot;head&quot; appears 60 times in the original screenplay. In a grim nod to later events, Charlie describes his positive attitude toward his &quot;job&quot; of selling insurance: &quot;Fire, theft and casualty are not things that only happen to other people.&quot;

=== Symbolism ===
Much has been written about the symbolic meanings of &quot;Barton Fink&quot;. Rowell proposes that it is &quot;a figurative head swelling of ideas that all lead back to the artist.&quot; The proximity of the sex scene to Audrey&#x27;s murder prompts Lyons to insist: &quot;Sex in &quot;Barton Fink&quot; is death.&quot; Others have suggested that the second half of the film is an extended dream sequence.

The Coens, however, have denied any intent to create a systematic unity from symbols in the film. &quot;We never, ever go into our films with anything like that in mind,&quot; Joel said in a 1998 interview. &quot;There&#x27;s never anything approaching that kind of specific intellectual breakdown. It&#x27;s always a bunch of instinctive things that feel right, for whatever reason.&quot; The Coens have noted their comfort with unresolved ambiguity. Ethan said in 1991: &quot;&quot;Barton Fink&quot; does end up telling you what&#x27;s going on to the extent that it&#x27;s important to know ... What isn&#x27;t crystal clear isn&#x27;t intended to become crystal clear, and it&#x27;s fine to leave it at that.&quot; Regarding fantasies and dream sequences, he said:

There are homoerotic overtones to Barton&#x27;s relationship with Charlie. One detective demands to know if they had &quot;some sick sex thing&quot; and Charlie&#x27;s first friendly overture toward his neighbor is a standard pick-up line: &quot;I&#x27;d feel better about the damned inconvenience if you&#x27;d let me buy you a drink.&quot; The wrestling scene between Barton and Charlie is also homoerotic. &quot;We consider that a sex scene,&quot; Joel Coen said in 2001.

=== Sound and music ===
Many of the sound effects in &quot;Barton Fink&quot; are laden with meaning. For example, Barton is summoned by a bell while dining in New York City; its sound is light and pleasant. By contrast, the eerie sustained bell of the Hotel Earle rings endlessly through the lobby, until Chet silences it. The nearby rooms of the hotel emit a constant chorus of guttural cries, moans, and assorted unidentifiable noises. These sounds coincide with Barton&#x27;s confused mental state and punctuate Charlie&#x27;s claim that &quot;I hear everything that goes on in this dump.&quot; The applause in the first scene foreshadows the tension of Barton&#x27;s move west, mixed as it is with the sound of an ocean wave crashing – an image which is shown onscreen soon thereafter.
Another symbolic sound is the hum of a mosquito. Although Fink&#x27;s producer insists that these parasites don&#x27;t live in Los Angeles (since &quot;mosquitos breed in swamps; this is a desert,&quot;) its distinctive sound is heard clearly as Barton watches a bug circle overhead in his hotel room. Later, he arrives at meetings with mosquito bites on his face. The insect also figures prominently into the revelation of Audrey&#x27;s death; Barton slaps a mosquito feeding on her corpse and suddenly realizes she has been murdered. The high pitch of the mosquito&#x27;s hum is echoed in the high strings used for the film&#x27;s score. During filming, the Coens were contacted by an animal rights group who expressed concern about how mosquitoes would be treated.

The score was composed by Carter Burwell, who has worked with the Coens since their first film. Unlike earlier projects, however – the Irish folk tune used for &quot;Miller&#x27;s Crossing&quot; and an American folk song as the basis for &quot;Raising Arizona&quot; – Burwell wrote the music for &quot;Barton Fink&quot; without a specific inspiration. The score was released in 1996 on a compact disc, along with the score for the Coens&#x27; film &quot;Fargo.&quot;

Several songs used in the film are laden with meaning. At one point Mayhew stumbles away from Barton and Audrey, drunk. As he wanders, he hollers the folk song &quot;Old Black Joe&quot;. (1853) Composed by Stephen Foster, it tells the tale of an elderly slave preparing to join his friends in &quot;a better land.&quot; Mayhew&#x27;s rendition of the song coincides with his condition as an oppressed employee of Capitol Pictures, and it foreshadows Barton&#x27;s own situation at the film&#x27;s end.

When he finishes writing his script, Barton celebrates by dancing at a United Service Organizations (USO) show. The song used in this scene is a rendition of &quot;Down South Camp Meeting&quot;, a swing tune. Its lyrics (unheard in the film) state: &quot;Git ready (Sing) / Here they come! The choir&#x27;s all set.&quot; These lines echo the title of Barton&#x27;s play, &quot;Bare Ruined Choirs&quot;. As the celebration erupts into a melee, the intensity of the music increases, and the camera zooms into the cavernous hollow of a trumpet. This sequence mirrors the camera&#x27;s zoom into a sink drain just before Audrey is murdered earlier in the film.

== Sources, inspirations, and allusions ==
Inspiration for the film came from several sources, and it contains allusions to many different people and events. For example, the title of Barton&#x27;s play, &quot;Bare Ruined Choirs&quot;, comes from line four of Sonnet 73 by William Shakespeare. The poem&#x27;s focus on aging and death connects to the film&#x27;s exploration of artistic difficulty.

Later, at one point in the picnic scene, as Mayhew wanders drunkenly away from Barton and Audrey, he calls out: &quot;Silent upon a peak in Darien!&quot; This is the last line from John Keats&#x27;s sonnet &quot;On First Looking into Chapman&#x27;s Homer&quot;. (1816) The literary reference not only demonstrates the character&#x27;s knowledge of classic texts, but the poem&#x27;s reference to the Pacific Ocean matches Mayhew&#x27;s announcement that he will &quot;jus&#x27; walk on down to the Pacific, and from there I&#x27;ll ... improvise.&quot;

Other academic allusions are presented elsewhere, often with extreme subtlety. For example, a brief shot of the title page in a Mayhew novel indicates the publishing house of &quot;Swain and Pappas&quot;. This is likely a reference to Marshall Swain and George Pappas, philosophers whose work is concerned with themes explored in the film, including the limitations of knowledge and nature of being. One critic notes that Barton&#x27;s fixation on the stain across the ceiling of his hotel room matches the protagonist&#x27;s behavior in Flannery O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s short story &quot;The Enduring Chill.&quot; 

Critics have suggested that the film indirectly references the work of writers Dante Alighieri (through the use of &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; imagery) and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (through the presence of Faustian bargains). Confounding bureaucratic structures and irrational characters, like those in the novels of Franz Kafka, appear in the film, but the Coens insist the connection was not intended. &quot;I have not read him since college&quot;, admitted Joel in 1991, &quot;when I devoured works like &quot;The Metamorphosis.&quot; Others have mentioned &quot;The Castle&quot; and &#x27;In the Penal Colony,&#x27; but I&#x27;ve never read them.&quot;

=== Clifford Odets ===
The character of Barton Fink is loosely based on Clifford Odets, a playwright from New York who in the 1930s joined the Group Theatre, a gathering of dramatists which included Harold Clurman, Cheryl Crawford and Lee Strasberg. Their work emphasized social issues and employed Stanislavski&#x27;s system of acting to recreate human experience as truthfully as possible. Several of Odets&#x27; plays were successfully performed on Broadway, including &quot;Awake and Sing!&quot; and &quot;Waiting for Lefty&quot; (both in 1935). When public tastes turned away from politically engaged theater and toward the familial realism of Eugene O&#x27;Neill, Odets had difficulty producing successful work, so he moved to Hollywood and spent 20 years writing film scripts.
The Coens wrote with Odets in mind; they imagined Barton Fink as &quot;a serious dramatist, honest, politically engaged, and rather naive.&quot; As Ethan said in 1991: &quot;It seemed natural that he comes from Group Theater and the decade of the thirties.&quot; Like Odets, Barton believes that the theatre should celebrate the trials and triumphs of everyday people; like Barton, Odets was highly egotistical. In the film, a review of Barton&#x27;s play &quot;Bare Ruined Choirs&quot; indicates that his characters face a &quot;brute struggle for existence ... in the most squalid corners.&quot; This wording is similar to the comment of biographer Gerald Weales that Odets&#x27; characters &quot;struggle for life amidst petty conditions.&quot; Lines of dialogue from Barton&#x27;s work are reminiscent of Odets&#x27; play &quot;Awake and Sing!&quot;. For example, one character declares: &quot;I&#x27;m awake now, awake for the first time.&quot; Another says: &quot;Take that ruined choir. Make it sing.&quot;

However, many important differences exist between the two men. Joel Coen said: &quot;Both writers wrote the same kind of plays with proletarian heroes, but their personalities were quite different. Odets was much more of an extrovert; in fact he was quite sociable even in Hollywood, and this is not the case with Barton Fink!&quot; Although he was frustrated by his declining popularity in New York, Odets was successful during his time in Hollywood. Several of his later plays were adapted – by him and others – into films. One of these, &quot;The Big Knife&quot; (1955), matches Barton&#x27;s life much more than Odets&#x27;. In it, an actor becomes overwhelmed by the greed of a film studio which hires him and eventually commits suicide. Another similarity to Odets&#x27; work is Audrey&#x27;s death, which mirrors a scene in &quot;Deadline at Dawn,&quot; (1946) a film noir written by Odets. In that film, a character awakens to find that the woman he bedded the night before has been inexplicably murdered.

Odets chronicled his difficult transition from Broadway to Hollywood in his diary, published as &quot;The Time Is Ripe: The 1940 Journal of Clifford Odets.&quot; (1988) The diary explored Odets&#x27; philosophical deliberations about writing and romance. He often invited women into his apartment, and he describes many of his affairs in the diary. These experiences, like the extended speeches about writing, are echoed in &quot;Barton Fink&quot; when Audrey visits and seduces Barton at the Hotel Earle. Turturro was the only member of the production who read Odets&#x27; &quot;Journal,&quot; however, and the Coen brothers urge audiences to &quot;take account of the difference between the character and the man.&quot;

The Coen brothers have stated that although the character of Fink is based on Odets, the character&#x27;s appearance with &quot;stand-up hair and glasses&quot; is based on that of George S. Kaufman.

=== William Faulkner ===

Some similarities exist between the character of W. P. Mayhew and novelist William Faulkner. Like Mayhew, Faulkner became known as a preeminent writer of Southern literature and later worked in the film business. Like Faulkner, Mayhew is a heavy drinker and speaks contemptuously about Hollywood. Faulkner&#x27;s name appeared in the Hollywood 1940s history book &quot;City of Nets,&quot; which the Coens read while creating &quot;Barton Fink.&quot; Ethan explained in 1998: &quot;I read this story in passing that Faulkner was assigned to write a wrestling picture... That was part of what got us going on the whole &quot;Barton Fink&quot; thing.&quot; Faulkner worked on a wrestling film called &quot;Flesh,&quot; (1932) which starred Wallace Beery, the actor for whom Barton is writing. The focus on wrestling was fortuitous for the Coens, as they participated in the sport in high school.

However, the Coens disavow a significant connection between Faulkner and Mayhew, calling the similarities &quot;superficial,&quot; &quot;As far as the details of the character are concerned,&quot; Ethan said in 1991, &quot;Mayhew is very different from Faulkner, whose experiences in Hollywood were not the same at all.&quot; Unlike Mayhew&#x27;s inability to write due to drink and personal problems, Faulkner continued to pen novels after working in the film business, winning several awards for fiction completed during and after his time in Hollywood.

=== Jack Lipnick ===
Lerner&#x27;s Academy Award-nominated character study of studio mogul Jack Lipnick is a composite of several Hollywood producers, including Harry Cohn, Louis B. Mayer and Jack L. Warner – three of the most powerful men in the film industry at the time in which &quot;Barton Fink&quot; is set. Like Mayer, Lipnick is originally from the Belarusian capital city Minsk. When World War II broke out, Warner pressed for a position in the military and ordered his wardrobe department to create a military uniform for him; Lipnick does the same in his final scene. Warner once referred to writers as &quot;schmucks with Underwoods,&quot; leading to Barton&#x27;s use in the film of an Underwood typewriter.

At the same time, the Coens stress that the labyrinth of deception and difficulty Barton endures is not based on their own experience. Although Joel has said that artists tend to &quot;meet up with Philistines,&quot; he added: &quot;&quot;Barton Fink&quot; is quite far from our own experience. Our professional life in Hollywood has been especially easy, and this is no doubt extraordinary and unfair.&quot; Ethan has suggested that Lipnick – like the men on which he is based – is in some ways a product of his time. &quot;I don&#x27;t know that that kind of character exists anymore. Hollywood is a little more bland and corporate than that now.&quot;

=== Cinema ===
The Coens have acknowledged several cinematic inspirations for &quot;Barton Fink.&quot; Chief among these are three films by Polish-French film-maker Roman Polanski: &quot;Repulsion,&quot; (1965) &quot;Cul-de-Sac&quot; (1966) and &quot;The Tenant&quot; (1976). These films employ a mood of psychological uncertainty coupled with eerie environments that compound the mental instability of the characters. Barton&#x27;s isolation in his room at the Hotel Earle is frequently compared to that of Trelkovsky in his apartment in &quot;The Tenant.&quot; Ethan said regarding the genre of &quot;Barton Fink&quot;: &quot;[I]t is kind of a Polanski movie. It is closer to that than anything else.&quot; By coincidence, Polanski was the head of the jury at the Cannes Film Festival in 1991, where &quot;Barton Fink&quot; premiered. This created an awkward situation. &quot;Obviously,&quot; Joel Coen said later, &quot;we have been influenced by his films, but at this time we were very hesitant to speak to him about it because we did not want to give the impression we were sucking up.&quot;

Other works cited as influences for &quot;Barton Fink&quot; include &quot;The Shining&quot; (1980), produced and directed by Stanley Kubrick, and the comedy &quot;Sullivan&#x27;s Travels&quot; (1941), written and directed by Preston Sturges. Set in an empty hotel, Kubrick&#x27;s film concerns a writer unable to proceed with his latest work. Although the Coens approve of comparisons to &quot;The Shining,&quot; Joel suggests that Kubrick&#x27;s film &quot;belongs in a more global sense to the horror film genre&quot;. &quot;Sullivan&#x27;s Travels,&quot; released the year in which &quot;Barton Fink&quot; is set, follows successful director John Sullivan, who decides to create a film of deep social import – not unlike Barton&#x27;s desire to create entertainment for &quot;the common man.&quot; Sullivan eventually decides that comedic entertainment is a key role for film-makers, similar to Jack Lipnick&#x27;s assertion at the end of &quot;Barton Fink&quot; that &quot;the audience wants to see action, adventure&quot; and not a &quot;fruity film about suffering.&quot;

Additional allusions to films and film history abound in &quot;Barton Fink.&quot; At one point a character discusses &quot;Victor Soderberg&quot;; the name is a reference to Victor Sjöström, a Swedish director who worked in Hollywood under the name Seastrom. Charlie&#x27;s line about how his troubles &quot;don&#x27;t amount to a hill of beans&quot; is a probable homage to &quot;Casablanca&quot; (1942). The unsettling emptiness of the Hotel Earle has also been compared to the living spaces in &quot;Key Largo&quot; (1948) and &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; (1950). Vincent Canby noted that Barton &quot;resembles the hero of David Lynch&#x27;s &quot;Eraserhead&quot;&quot; (1977). The last scene of &quot;Barton Fink&quot; echoes the end of &quot;La Dolce Vita&quot; (1960), where a young woman&#x27;s final line of dialogue is drowned out by the sound of the sea.

== Themes ==
Two of the film&#x27;s central themes – the culture of entertainment production and the writing process – are intertwined and relate specifically to the self-referential nature of the work (as well as the work within the work). It is a film about a man who writes a film based on a play, and at the centre of Barton&#x27;s entire opus is Barton himself. The dialogue in his play &quot;Bare Ruined Choirs&quot; (also the first lines of the film, some of which are repeated at the end of the film as lines in Barton&#x27;s screenplay &quot;The Burlyman&quot;) give us a glimpse into Barton&#x27;s self-descriptive art. The mother in the play is named &quot;Lil,&quot; which is later revealed to be the name of Barton&#x27;s own mother. In the play, &quot;The Kid&quot; (a representation of Barton himself) refers to his home &quot;six flights up&quot; – the same floor where Barton resides at the Hotel Earle. Moreover, the characters&#x27; writing processes in &quot;Barton Fink&quot; reflect important differences between the culture of entertainment production in New York&#x27;s Broadway district and Hollywood.

=== Broadway and Hollywood ===
Although Barton speaks frequently about his desire to help create &quot;a new, living theater, of and about and for the common man,&quot; he does not recognize that such a theater has already been created: the films. In fact, he disdains this authentically popular form. On the other hand, the world of Broadway theater in &quot;Barton Fink&quot; is a place of high culture, where the creator (Barton included) believes most fully that his work embodies his own values. Although he pretends to disdain his own success, Barton believes he has achieved a great victory with &quot;Bare Ruined Choirs.&quot; He seeks praise; when his agent Garland asks if he has seen the glowing review in the &quot;Herald,&quot; Barton says &quot;No,&quot; even though his producer had just read it to him. Barton feels close to the theater, confident that it can help him create work that honors &quot;the common man.&quot; The men and women who funded the production – &quot;those people,&quot; as Barton calls them – demonstrate that Broadway is just as concerned with profit as Hollywood; but its intimacy and smaller scale allow the author to feel that his work has real value.
Barton does not believe Hollywood offers the same opportunity. In the film, Los Angeles is a world of false fronts and phony people. This is evident in an early line of the screenplay (filmed, but not included in the theatrical release); while informing Barton of Capitol Pictures&#x27; offer, his agent tells him: &quot;I&#x27;m only asking that your decision be informed by a little realism – if I can use that word and Hollywood in the same breath.&quot; Later, as Barton tries to explain why he is staying at the Earle, studio head Jack Lipnick finishes his sentence, recognizing that Barton wants a place that is &quot;less Hollywood.&quot; The assumption is that Hollywood is fake and the Earle is genuine. Producer Ben Geisler takes Barton to lunch at a restaurant featuring a mural of the &quot;New York Cafe,&quot; a sign of Hollywood&#x27;s effort to replicate the authenticity of the East Coast of the United States. Lipnick&#x27;s initial overwhelming exuberance is also a façade. Although he begins by telling Barton: &quot;The writer is king here at Capitol Pictures,&quot; in the penultimate scene he insists: &quot;If your opinion mattered, then I guess I&#x27;d resign and let &quot;you&quot; run the studio. It doesn&#x27;t, and you won&#x27;t, and the lunatics are not going to run &quot;this&quot; particular asylum.&quot;

Deception in &quot;Barton Fink&quot; is emblematic of Hollywood&#x27;s focus on low culture, its relentless desire to efficiently produce formulaic entertainment for the sole purpose of economic gain. Capitol Pictures assigns Barton to write a wrestling picture with superstar Wallace Beery in the leading role. Although Lipnick declares otherwise, Geisler assures Barton that &quot;it&#x27;s just a B picture.&quot; Audrey tries to help the struggling writer by telling him: &quot;Look, it&#x27;s really just a formula. You don&#x27;t have to type your soul into it.&quot; This formula is made clear by Lipnick, who asks Barton in their first meeting whether the main character should have a love interest or take care of an orphaned child. Barton shows his iconoclasm by answering: &quot;Both, maybe?&quot; In the end, his inability to conform to the studio&#x27;s norms destroys Barton.

A similar depiction of Hollywood appears in Nathanael West&#x27;s novel &quot;The Day of the Locust&quot; (1939), which many critics see as an important precursor to &quot;Barton Fink.&quot; Set in a run-down apartment complex, the book describes a painter reduced to decorating film sets. It portrays Hollywood as crass and exploitative, devouring talented individuals in its neverending quest for profit. In both West&#x27;s novel and &quot;Barton Fink,&quot; protagonists suffer under the oppressive industrial machine of the film studio.

=== Writing ===
The film contains further self-referential material, as a film about a writer having difficulty writing (written by the Coen brothers while they were having difficulty writing &quot;Miller&#x27;s Crossing&quot;). Barton is trapped between his own desire to create meaningful art and Capitol Pictures&#x27; need to use its standard conventions to earn profits. Audrey&#x27;s advice about following the formula would have saved Barton, but he does not heed it. However, when he puts the mysterious package (which might have contained her head) on his writing desk, she might have been helping him posthumously, in other ways. The film itself toys with standard screenplay formulae. As with Mayhew&#x27;s scripts, &quot;Barton Fink&quot; contains a &quot;good wrestler&quot; (Barton, it seems) and a &quot;bad wrestler&quot; (Charlie) who &quot;confront&quot; each other at the end. But in typical Coen fashion, the lines of good and evil are blurred, and the supposed hero in fact reveals himself to be deaf to the pleadings of his &quot;common man&quot; neighbor. By blurring the lines between reality and surreal experience, the film subverts the &quot;simple morality tales&quot; and &quot;road maps&quot; offered to Barton as easy paths for the writer to follow.

However, the film-makers point out that &quot;Barton Fink&quot; is not meant to represent the Coens themselves. &quot;Our life in Hollywood has been particularly easy,&quot; they once said. &quot;The film isn&#x27;t a personal comment.&quot; Still, universal themes of the creative process are explored throughout the film. During the picnic scene, for example, Mayhew asks Barton: &quot;Ain&#x27;t writin&#x27; peace?&quot; Barton pauses, then says: &quot;No, I&#x27;ve always found that writing comes from a great inner pain.&quot; Such exchanges led critic William Rodney Allen to call &quot;Barton Fink&quot; &quot;an autobiography of the life of the Coens&#x27; minds, not of literal fact.&quot; Allen&#x27;s comment is itself a reference to the phrase &quot;life of the mind,&quot; used repeatedly in the film in wildly differing contexts.

=== Fascism ===
Several of the film&#x27;s elements, including the setting at the start of World War II, have led some critics to highlight parallels to the rise of fascism at the time. For example, the detectives who visit Barton at the Hotel Earle are named &quot;Mastrionatti&quot; and &quot;Deutsch&quot; – Italian and German names, evocative of the regimes of Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler. Their contempt for Barton is clear: &quot;Fink. That&#x27;s a Jewish name, isn&#x27;t it? ... I didn&#x27;t think this dump was restricted.&quot; Later, just before killing his last victim, Charlie says: &quot;Heil Hitler&quot;. Jack Lipnick hails originally from the Belarusian capital city Minsk, which was occupied from summer 1941 by Nazi Germany, following Operation Barbarossa.

&quot;[I]t&#x27;s not forcing the issue to suggest that the Holocaust hovers over &quot;Barton Fink&quot;,&quot; writes biographer Ronald Bergan. Others see a more specific message in the film, particularly Barton&#x27;s obliviousness to Charlie&#x27;s homicidal tendencies. Critic Roger Ebert wrote in his 1991 review that the Coens intended to create an allegory for the rise of Nazism. &quot;They paint Fink as an ineffectual and impotent left-wing intellectual, who sells out while telling himself he is doing the right thing, who thinks he understands the &#x27;common man&#x27; but does not understand that, for many common men, fascism had a seductive appeal.&quot; However, he goes on to say: &quot;It would be a mistake to insist too much on this aspect of the movie...&quot;

Other critics are more demanding. M. Keith Booker writes: For their part, the Coens deny any intention of presenting an allegorical message. They chose the detectives&#x27; names deliberately, but &quot;we just wanted them to be representative of the Axis world powers at the time. It just seemed kind of amusing. It&#x27;s a tease. All that stuff with Charlie – the &quot;Heil Hitler!&quot; business – sure, it&#x27;s all there, but it&#x27;s kind of a tease.&quot; In 2001, Joel responded to a question about critics who provide extended comprehensive analysis: &quot;That&#x27;s how they&#x27;ve been trained to watch movies. In &quot;Barton Fink,&quot; we may have encouraged it – like teasing animals at the zoo. The movie is intentionally ambiguous in ways they may not be used to seeing.&quot;

=== Slavery ===
Although subdued in dialogue and imagery, the theme of slavery appears several times in the film. Mayhew&#x27;s crooning of the parlor song &quot;Old Black Joe&quot; depicts him as enslaved to the film studio, not unlike the song&#x27;s narrator who pines for &quot;my friends from the cotton fields away.&quot; One brief shot of the door to Mayhew&#x27;s workspace shows the title of the film he is supposedly writing: &quot;Slave Ship.&quot; This is a reference to a 1937 movie written by Mayhew&#x27;s inspiration, William Faulkner, and starring Wallace Beery, for whom Barton is composing a script in the film.

The symbol of the slave ship is furthered by specific set designs, including the round window in Ben Geisler&#x27;s office which resembles a porthole, as well as the walkway leading to Mayhew&#x27;s bungalow, which resembles the boarding ramp of a watercraft. Several lines of dialogue make clear by the film&#x27;s end that Barton has become a slave to the studio: &quot;[T]he contents of your head&quot;, Lipnick&#x27;s assistant tells him, &quot;are the property of Capitol Pictures.&quot; After Barton turns in his script, Lipnick delivers an even more brutal punishment: &quot;Anything you write will be the property of Capitol Pictures. And Capitol Pictures will not produce anything you write.&quot; This contempt and control is representative of the opinions expressed by many writers in Hollywood at the time. As Arthur Miller said in his review of &quot;Barton Fink&quot;: &quot;The only thing about Hollywood that I am sure of is that its mastication of writers can never be too wildly exaggerated.&quot;

=== &quot;The Common Man&quot; ===
During the first third of the film, Barton speaks constantly of his desire to write work which centers on and appeals to &quot;the common man.&quot; In one speech he declares: &quot;The hopes and dreams of the common man are as noble as those of any king. It&#x27;s the stuff of life – why shouldn&#x27;t it be the stuff of theater? God damn it, why should that be a hard pill to swallow? Don&#x27;t call it &quot;new&quot; theater, Charlie; call it &quot;real&quot; theater. Call it &quot;our&quot; theater.&quot; Yet, despite his rhetoric, Barton is totally unable (or unwilling) to appreciate the humanity of the &quot;common man&quot; living next door to him. Later in the film, Charlie explains that he has brought various horrors upon him because &quot;you &quot;don&#x27;t listen!&quot;&quot; In his first conversation with Charlie, Barton constantly interrupts Charlie just as he is saying &quot;I could tell you some stories,&quot; demonstrating that despite his fine words he really is not interested in Charlie&#x27;s experiences; in another scene, Barton symbolically demonstrates his deafness to the world by stuffing his ears with cotton to block the sound of his ringing telephone.

Barton&#x27;s position as screenwriter is of particular consequence to his relationship with &quot;the common man.&quot; By refusing to listen to his neighbor, Barton cannot validate Charlie&#x27;s existence in his writing – with disastrous results. Not only is Charlie stuck in a job which demeans him, but he cannot (at least in Barton&#x27;s case) have his story told. More centrally, the film traces the evolution of Barton&#x27;s understanding of &quot;the common man&quot;: At first he is an abstraction to be lauded from a vague distance. Then he becomes a complex individual with fears and desires. Finally he shows himself to be a powerful individual in his own right, capable of extreme forms of destruction and therefore feared and/or respected.

The complexity of &quot;the common man&quot; is also explored through the oft-mentioned &quot;life of the mind.&quot; While expounding on his duty as a writer, Barton drones: &quot;I gotta tell you, the life of the mind ... There&#x27;s no road map for that territory ... and exploring it can be painful. The kind of pain most people don&#x27;t know anything about.&quot; Barton assumes that he is privy to thoughtful creative considerations while Charlie is not. This delusion shares the film&#x27;s climax, as Charlie runs through the hallway of the Earle, shooting the detectives with a shotgun and screaming: &quot;Look upon me! I&#x27;ll show you the life of the mind!!&quot; Charlie&#x27;s &quot;life of the mind&quot; is no less complex than Barton&#x27;s; in fact, some critics consider it more so.

Charlie&#x27;s understanding of the world is depicted as omniscient, as when he asks Barton about &quot;the two lovebirds next door,&quot; despite the fact that they are several doors away. When Barton asks how he knows about them, Charlie responds: &quot;Seems like I hear everything that goes on in this dump. Pipes or somethin&#x27;.&quot; His total awareness of the events at the Earle demonstrate the kind of understanding needed to show real empathy, as described by Audrey. This theme returns when Charlie explains in his final scene: &quot;Most guys I just feel sorry for. Yeah. It tears me up inside, to think about what they&#x27;re going through. How trapped they are. I understand it. I feel for &#x27;em. So I try to help them out.&quot;

=== Religion ===
Themes of religious salvation and allusions to the Bible appear only briefly in &quot;Barton Fink,&quot; but their presence pervades the story. While Barton is experiencing his most desperate moment of confusion and despair, he opens the drawer of his desk and finds a Gideon Bible. He opens it &quot;randomly&quot; to Daniel 2, and reads from it: &quot;And the king, Nebuchadnezzar, answered and said to the Chaldeans, I recall not my dream; if ye will not make known unto me my dream, and its interpretation, ye shall be cut in pieces, and of your tents shall be made a dunghill.&quot; This passage reflects Barton&#x27;s inability to make sense of his own experiences (wherein Audrey has been &quot;cut in pieces&quot;), as well as the &quot;hopes and dreams&quot; of &quot;the common man.&quot; &quot;Nebuchadnezzar&quot; is also the title of a novel that Mayhew gives to Barton as a &quot;little entertainment&quot; to &quot;divert you in your sojourn among the Philistines.&quot;

Mayhew alludes to &quot;the story of Solomon&#x27;s mammy,&quot; a reference to Bathsheba, who gave birth to Solomon after her lover David had her husband Uriah killed. Although Audrey cuts Mayhew off by praising his book (which Audrey herself may have written), the reference foreshadows the love triangle which evolves among the three characters of &quot;Barton Fink.&quot; Rowell points out that Mayhew is murdered (presumably by Charlie) soon after Barton and Audrey have sex. Another Biblical reference comes when Barton flips to the front of the Bible in his desk drawer and sees his own words transposed into the Book of Genesis. This is seen as a representation of his hubris as a self-conceived omnipotent master of creation, or alternatively, as a playful juxtaposition demonstrating Barton&#x27;s hallucinatory state of mind.

The film opened in the United States on eleven screens on August 23, 1991, and earned $268,561 during its opening weekend. During its theatrical release, &quot;Barton Fink&quot; grossed $6,153,939 in the United States. That the film failed to recoup the expenses of production amused film producer Joel Silver, with whom the Coens would later work in &quot;The Hudsucker Proxy&quot; (1994): &quot;I don&#x27;t think it made $5 million, and it cost $9 million to make. [The Coen brothers have] a reputation for being weird, off-center, inaccessible.

=== Critical reception ===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 90% based on 67 reviews, with an average rating of 7.9/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;Twisty and unsettling, the Coen brothers&#x27; satirical tale of a 1940s playwright struggling with writer&#x27;s block is packed with their trademark sense of humor and terrific performances from its cast.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 69 out of 100, based on 19 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews.&quot; Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

&quot;The Washington Post&quot; critic Rita Kempley described &quot;Barton Fink&quot; as &quot;certainly one of the year&#x27;s best and most intriguing films.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; critic Vincent Canby called it &quot;an unqualified winner&quot; and &quot;a fine dark comedy of flamboyant style and immense though seemingly effortless technique.&quot; Critic Jim Emerson called &quot;Barton Fink&quot; &quot;the Coen brothers&#x27; most deliciously, provocatively indescribable picture yet.&quot;

Some critics disliked the enigmatic plot and ambiguous ending. &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; critic Jonathan Rosenbaum warned of the Coens&#x27; &quot;adolescent smarminess and comic-book cynicism,&quot; and described &quot;Barton Fink&quot; as &quot;a midnight-movie gross-out in Sunday-afternoon art-house clothing.&quot; John Simon of &quot;The National Review&quot; described Barton Fink as &quot;asinine and insufferable.&quot;

In a 1994 interview, Joel dismissed criticism of unclear elements in their films: &quot;People have a problem dealing with the fact that our movies are not straight-ahead. They would prefer that the last half of &quot;Barton Fink&quot; just be about a screenwriter&#x27;s writing-block problems and how they get resolved in the real world.&quot; Talk show host Larry King expressed approval of the movie, despite its uncertain conclusion. He wrote in &quot;USA Today&quot;: &quot;The ending is something I&#x27;m still thinking about and if they accomplished that, I guess it worked.&quot; In a 2016 interview, screenwriter Charlie Kaufman said after being asked which film he would want with him on a deserted island, &quot;A movie I really love is &quot;Barton Fink.&quot; I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s the movie I&#x27;d take to a desert island, but I feel like there&#x27;s so much in there, you could watch it again and again. That&#x27;s important to me, especially if that was the only movie I&#x27;d have with me for the rest of my life.&quot;

&quot;Barton Fink&quot; was ranked by Greg Cwik of &quot;IndieWire&quot; as the Coens&#x27; fifth best film. It was voted the 11th best film of the 1990s in a poll of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; contributors, and was described as &quot;one of [the Coens&#x27;] most profound, and painful&quot; works.

=== Awards and nominations ===
Winning three major awards at the Cannes Film Festival was extremely rare, and some critics felt the jury was too generous to the exclusion of other worthy entries. Worried that the triple victory could set a precedent which would undervalue other films, Cannes decided after the 1991 festival to limit each movie to a maximum of two awards.

== Formats ==
The film was released in VHS home video format on March 5, 1992, and a DVD edition was made available on May 20, 2003. The DVD contains a gallery of still photos, theatrical trailers, and eight deleted scenes. The film is also available on Blu-ray Disc, in the UK, in a region-free format that will work in any Blu-ray player.

== Possible sequel ==
The Coen brothers have expressed interest in making a sequel to &quot;Barton Fink&quot; called &quot;Old Fink&quot;, which would take place in the 1960s. &quot;It&#x27;s the summer of love and [Fink is] teaching at Berkeley. He ratted on a lot of his friends to the House Un-American Activities Committee,&quot; said Joel Coen. The brothers have stated that they have had talks with John Turturro about reprising his role as Fink, but they were waiting &quot;until he was actually old enough to play the part.&quot;

Speaking to &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; in June 2011, Turturro suggested the sequel would be set in the 1970s, and Fink would be a hippie with a large Jewfro. He said &quot;you&#x27;ll have to wait another 10 years for that, at least.&quot;

== References in other media ==
In &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Brother From the Same Planet&quot;, Milhouse, Louis and Richard announce their plan to sneak into an R-Rated movie, chanting &quot;Bar-ton Fink! Bar-ton Fink!&quot; The title of the episode &quot;Bart the Fink&quot; references the film.

Many critics noted that &quot;The Law of Non-Contradiction&quot;, an episode of the Coen-produced TV series &quot;Fargo&quot; based on their eponymous 1996 film, features a reference to the picture in Fink&#x27;s room, as the episode&#x27;s main character Gloria sits at the beach in shot and position similar to the picture&#x27;s. The episode&#x27;s themes were also compared to &quot;Barton Fink&quot;.

<doc id="320402" wikidata="Q449245" url="?curid=320402" title="Alvin Robertson">
<text>Alvin Cyrrale Robertson (born July 22, 1962) is an American former professional basketball player who played in the National Basketball Association (NBA) from 1984 to 1993, and for one final season in 1995–96. Robertson holds the record for the most steals per game played, averaging 2.71 steals per game for his career and is the only player to ever have a season of 300 or more steals which he accomplished in the 1985–86 season. He is also the only guard in NBA history to have recorded a quadruple-double.

==Early life==
Alvin Cyrrale Robertson was born on July 22, 1962, in Barberton, Ohio.

==College career== 
Robertson attended Crowder College from 1980 to 1981. He then attended Arkansas from 1981 to 1984.

==Professional career==
===San Antonio Spurs (1984–1989)===
Best known for his defense, the 6&#x27;4&quot; Robertson played for ten years after being selected by the San Antonio Spurs with the seventh pick in the 1984 NBA draft out of Crowder Junior College and the University of Arkansas. After five seasons with the Spurs, He finished out his career with the Milwaukee Bucks, the Detroit Pistons and the Toronto Raptors. He also was a member of the 1984 U.S. Olympic gold-medal team.

In 1986, Robertson became the inaugural winner of the NBA Most Improved Player Award. This also marked the first of four National Basketball Association All-Star Game appearances for the guard (the others coming in 1987, 1988, and 1991). He also won the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award in 1986, and led the league in steals in 1986, 1987 and 1991. Robertson still holds the top career steals-per-game average in the NBA, with 2.71 per contest over 779 career games.

Robertson thrice led the league in steals. In 1985–86 he averaged a league-leading 3.7 steals per game, a major factor in his earning the Defensive Player of the Year honor and being selected second-team All-NBA, one of only seven players in Spurs&#x27; history to have been selected first, second or third-team All-NBA. He was a four-time All-Star.

Robertson led the Spurs in steals four of the five seasons he was with the club, three times averaging more than three per game. Though he played only five seasons in San Antonio, he ranks third in club history in total steals, with 1,129. During his San Antonio days, he also recorded a steal in a then-NBA-record 105 consecutive games; Chris Paul surpassed it by recording a steal in 108 consecutive games from 2007 to 2008.

A multi-dimensional player, Robertson is one of only four NBA players to record a quadruple-double (double digits in four statistical categories in a single game) when he registered 20 points, 11 rebounds, 10 assists, and 10 steals while playing for the Spurs against the Phoenix Suns on . He is also the only non-center to record a quadruple-double, and the only player to do so with steals as the fourth category (the other three were with blocks).

===Milwaukee Bucks (1989–1993)===
On May 28, 1989, Robertson was traded by the Spurs with Cadillac Anderson and a 1989 2nd round draft pick (Frank Kornet was later selected) to the Milwaukee Bucks for Terry Cummings and a 1990 2nd round draft pick (Tony Massenburg was later selected). He would continue to be a premier defender on the Bucks, leading the league in steal percentage, an advanced metric, each of his three full seasons. He was also voted to the 1991 all-star team, the same season he led the league in steals for the third time in his career.

===Detroit Pistons (1993)===
Robertson finished the 1992–93 NBA season with the Detroit Pistons.

During the 1993–94 season, the Detroit Pistons traded Robertson to the Denver Nuggets in exchange for Mark Macon and Marcus Liberty. However, he never saw any playing time for the Nuggets due to pre-existing back injuries.

===Toronto Raptors (1995–1996)===
Robertson scored the first points in Toronto Raptors history. Ed Pinckney won the franchise&#x27;s opening tip-off against the New Jersey Nets, Robertson hit a three-pointer, and the Raptors were ahead 3–0.

===Florida Beach Dogs (1996–1997)===
Robertson played for the Florida Beach Dogs from 1996 to 1997.

==Personal life==
Robertson is the father of Tyrell Johnson, 2008 NFL 2nd round draft choice of the Minnesota Vikings. He is also the father of Elgin Cook, a professional basketball player. His brother, Ken Robertson, played basketball for Cleveland State University.

===Legal problems===
Robertson has had a history of off-court problems, during and after his career. He spent a month in jail during the 1990 NBA off-season on domestic assault charges against his then-wife.

In August 1997, he pleaded no contest to four misdemeanor charges of abusing a former girlfriend and was sentenced to one year in prison. During the trial he was accused of having kicked in an apartment door while his former girlfriend and her 8-year-old daughter were inside, then taking her wallet and knocking over a television set. Robertson allegedly returned a few hours later and ripped rings off her fingers, tore a watch off her wrist, slashed furniture, damaged clothing and tried to set a fire.

Robertson was arrested again in San Antonio in January 2007, on a variety of charges, several related to domestic violence.

He was arrested in 2010 on charges of sex trafficking, but was later cleared of all charges after learning the accusations were fabricated.

In August 2018, Robertson was arrested in San Antonio on an outstanding warrant for violating a protective order.

<doc id="320404" wikidata="Q3851253" url="?curid=320404" title="An Essay Towards a Real Character, and a Philosophical Language">
<text>An Essay Towards a Real Character, and a Philosophical Language (London, 1668) is the best-remembered of the numerous works of John Wilkins, in which he expounds a new universal language, meant primarily to facilitate international communication among scholars, but envisioned for use by diplomats, travelers, and merchants as well. Unlike many universal language schemes of the period, it was meant merely as an auxiliary to—not a replacement of—existing natural languages.
==Background==
One of the aims of the &quot;Essay&quot; was to provide a replacement for the Latin language, which had been the international language of scholars in Western Europe by then for 1000 years. Comenius and others interested in international languages had criticisms of the arbitrary features of Latin that made it harder to learn, and Wilkins also made such points. A scheme for a &quot;lingua franca&quot; based on numerical values had been published by John Pell (1630); and in his 1640 work &quot;Mercury or the Secret Messenger&quot; (1640) Wilkins had mentioned the possibility of developing a trade language.

Seth Ward was author with Wilkins of &quot;Vindiciae academiarum&quot; (1654), a defence of the Commonwealth period of the Oxbridge university system against outsider reformers. In it Ward put forward a related language scheme, though differing from the &quot;Essay&quot; of Wilkins in some significant ways. Ward&#x27;s ideas derived from a number of sources, such as Cyprian Kinner who was a follower of Comenius, Ramon Lull, and Georg Ritschel. They went on to influence George Dalgarno as well as Wilkins.

There was immediate interest in the &quot;Essay&quot;; Wilkins is said to have regarded his work only in terms of a proof of concept. But in the medium term enthusiasm for this kind of constructed language declined. The problem of a universal language remained as a topic of debate.

==Composition and influences==
The stimulus for Wilkins to write the &quot;Essay&quot; came from the Council of the Royal Society, in 1662. The work was delayed by the Great Fire of London of 1666, which destroyed some of it in draft.

The book was written by Wilkins, assisted by John Ray, Francis Willughby, and others. An influence was the &quot;Ars Signorum&quot; of George Dalgarno. Also influential, as Wilkins acknowledged, was &quot;The Ground-Work or Foundation Laid ... for the Framing of a New Perfect Language&quot; (1652) by Francis Lodwick.

==Structure==
The work is in five parts, of which the fourth contains the discussion of the &quot;real character&quot; and &quot;philosophical language&quot;. The third deals with &quot;philosophical grammar&quot; (universal grammar). The last part is the &quot;alphabetical dictionary&quot;. It was compiled by William Lloyd.

==Wilkins&#x27;s scheme==
Wilkins&#x27;s &quot;Real Character&quot; is a constructed family of symbols, corresponding to a classification scheme developed by Wilkins and his colleagues. It was intended as a pasigraphy, in other words, to provide elementary building blocks from which could be constructed the universe&#x27;s every possible thing and notion. The Real Character is not an orthography: i.e. it is not a written representation of spoken language. Instead, each symbol represents a concept directly, without (at least in the early parts of the &quot;Essay&#x27;s&quot; presentation) there being any way of vocalizing it. Inspiration for this approach came in part from contemporary European accounts of the Chinese writing system, which were somewhat mistaken.

Later in the &quot;Essay&quot; Wilkins introduces his &quot;Philosophical Language&quot;, which assigns phonetic values to the Real Characters. For convenience, the following discussion blurs the distinction between Wilkins&#x27;s Character and his Language.

Concepts are divided into forty main &quot;Genera&quot;, each of which gives the first two-letter syllable of the word; a Genus is divided into &quot;Differences&quot;, each of which adds another letter; and Differences are divided into &quot;Species&quot;, which add a fourth letter. For instance, &quot;Zi&quot; identifies the Genus of &quot;beasts&quot; (mammals); &quot;Zit&quot; gives the Difference of &quot;rapacious beasts of the dog kind&quot;; &quot;Zitα&quot; gives the Species of dogs. (Sometimes the first letter indicates a supercategory—e.g. Z always indicates an animal—but this does not always hold.) The resulting Character, and its vocalization, for a given concept thus captures, to some extent, the concept&#x27;s semantics.

The &quot;Essay&quot; also proposed ideas on weights and measure similar to those later found in the metric system.
The botanical section of the essay was contributed by John Ray;
Robert Morison&#x27;s criticism of Ray&#x27;s work began a prolonged dispute between the two men.

==Related efforts, discussions, and literary references==
The &quot;Essay&quot; has received a certain amount of academic and literary attention, usually casting it as brilliant but hopeless.

One criticism (among many) is that &quot;words expressing closely related ideas have almost the same form, differing perhaps by their last letter only...[I]t would be exceedingly difficult to remember all these minute distinctions, and confusion would arise, in rapid reading and particularly in conversation.&quot;
(Umberto Eco notes that Wilkins himself made such a mistake in the &quot;Essay,&quot; using &quot;Gαde&quot; (barley) where apparently &quot;Gαpe&quot; (tulip) was meant.) However, others claim that natural languages already have such minute differences, and that to assume that such differences would be indistinguishable would be to claim that natural languages fail at this. 

George Edmonds sought to improve Wilkins&#x27;s Philosophical Language by reorganizing its grammar and orthography while keeping its taxonomy.
More recent &quot;a priori&quot; languages (among many others) are Solresol and Ro. 

Jorge Luis Borges discusses Wilkins&#x27;s philosophical language in his essay &quot;El idioma analítico de John Wilkins&quot; (&quot;The Analytical Language of John Wilkins&quot;), comparing Wilkins&#x27;s classification to the fictitious Chinese encyclopedia &quot;Celestial Emporium of Benevolent Knowledge&quot; and expressing doubts about any attempt at a universal classification.

In Neal Stephenson&#x27;s &quot;Quicksilver&quot;, character Daniel Waterhouse spends considerable time supporting the development of Wilkins&#x27;s classification system.

<text>Kraków John Paul II International Airport ( since 4 September 2007; earlier in ) is an international airport located near Kraków, in the village of Balice, west of the city centre, in southern Poland.

The airport is named after Pope John Paul II. It is the second-busiest airport of the country in terms of the volume of passengers served annually after Warsaw Chopin Airport. In 2023, it handled over 9.4 million passengers.

==History==
===Early years===
Construction of the airport started in 1964. It opened for civil aviation in 1967, and was a military site until 28 February 1968. Four years later, the first passenger terminal was built there.

In the 1970s, the airport saw further development, which included an increase in the length of the runway by 400 meters, the construction of taxiways, and the installation of high intensity runway lights.

In 1988, the authorities decided to build a new terminal that was opened for public use in 1993. In 1995, the entire apron was modernized.

In 1995, the airport&#x27;s name was changed from Kraków–Balice Airport to John Paul II International Airport Kraków–Balice, to honor Pope John Paul II, who was born in relatively nearby Wadowice and had spent many years of his life in Kraków, including serving as Archbishop of Kraków from 1963 until his elevation to the Papacy in 1978. For marketing reasons, the official name was further &quot;streamlined&quot; on 4 September 2007 as &quot;Kraków Airport im. Jana Pawła II&quot;.

===Development since the 2000s===
The airport was modernized once more in 2002, and since then new international connections have been established.

On 1 March 2007, a separate domestic terminal (T2) was opened. At that time, plans were underway to begin the construction of a new terminal.

A seven-storey parking garage opposite T1 became fully operational in May 2010.

On 12 December 2012, Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair announced it would be opening its second Polish base in Kraków basing two Boeing 737-800 aircraft at the airport from 31 March 2013, which allows the carrier to increase the number of the routes from Kraków to 31.

Kraków Airport is the second busiest airport in the country after Warsaw Chopin Airport. The airport has good growth prospects, as almost 8 million people live within of it. The airport also has a favorable location on the network of existing and planned motorways in this region of Poland. In 2021, Ryanair announced a US$800 million investment plan into Kraków and its airport expected to bring more than 400 direct jobs for pilots, flight crews, and ground staff along with 3500 indirect jobs.

In 2023, the airport handled over 9.4 million passengers becoming the first regional airport in Poland to pass the 9 million threshold in terms of the number of passengers served annually. It collaborated with 25 traditional and low-cost airlines offering 161 flight connections to 123 airports located in 113 cities in 35 countries.

In 2024, the airport authorities announced a plan to build a new terminal for the airport due to the inadequate capacity of the terminal opened in 2016.

==Facilities==

===Terminal===
Construction works of a new airport terminal began on 11 April 2013. The terminal was adjacent to the existing old terminal building. The works on the new terminal were completed in December 2016. The terminal serves all-year-round, 24 hours a day, both domestic as well as international flights. The expected maximum capacity of the terminal is up to 8 million passengers handled in a year (over twice as much as the airport served in 2012). It is also possible to handle transfer passengers irrespective of the routes (Schengen/Non-Schengen destinations). The terminal has a new luggage handling system and a roofed footbridge connecting the terminal to a hotel, a multi-level parking lot and the railway station, with direct railway link to Kraków Główny by Koleje Małopolskie.

===Runway===
The airport has one concrete runway, number 07/25, .

==Airlines and destinations==
The following airlines operate regular scheduled and charter flights at Kraków Airport:


==Statistics==


It was the 63rd busiest airport in Europe in 2019 and had the greatest increase in passengers in all of Europe in 2019 with a 24.2% passenger increase in 2019 compared to 2018.

==Ground transportation==

In addition to road access by private car or taxi, other options are:

===Train===
The SKA1 suburban line operates from the Airport to Kraków Główny (Main railway station) and further to Wieliczka. The service resumed in September 2015. It takes about 17 minutes to get to the city centre, and further 20 minutes to Wieliczka (for Salt Mine).
===Bus===
Public buses link the airport during the day and during the night with the main railway and bus station in Kraków (Kraków Główny railway station) and the &quot;ICE Congress Centre&quot;.

==Military usage==
The aerodrome includes a military area, on its South side, which hosts the &quot;8. Baza Lotnictwa Transportowego&quot; of the Polish Air Force, flying transport aircraft like the EADS CASA C-295

<text>A guitar amplifier (or amp) is an electronic device or system that strengthens the electrical signal from a pickup on an electric guitar, bass guitar, or acoustic guitar so that it can produce sound through one or more loudspeakers, which are typically housed in a wooden cabinet. A guitar amplifier may be a standalone wood or metal cabinet that contains only the power amplifier (and preamplifier) circuits, requiring the use of a separate speaker cabinet–or it may be a &quot;combo&quot; amplifier, which contains both the amplifier and one or more speakers in a wooden cabinet. There is a wide range of sizes and power ratings for guitar amplifiers, from small, lightweight practice amplifiers with a single 6-inch speaker and a 10-watt amp to heavy combo amps with four 10-inch or four 12-inch speakers and a 100-watt amplifier, which are loud enough to use in a nightclub or bar performance.

Guitar amplifiers can also modify an instrument&#x27;s tone by emphasizing or de-emphasizing certain frequencies, using equalizer controls, which function the same way as the bass and treble knobs on a home stereo, and by adding electronic effects; distortion (also called overdrive) and reverb are commonly available as built-in features. The input of modern guitar amplifiers is a 1/4&quot; jack, which is fed a signal from an electro-magnetic pickup (from an electric guitar) or a piezoelectric pickup (usually from an acoustic guitar) using a patch cord, or a wireless transmitter. For electric guitar players, their choice of amp and the settings they use on the amplifier are a key part of their signature tone or sound. Some guitar players are longtime users of a specific amp brand or model. Guitarists may also use external effects pedals to alter the sound of their tone before the signal reaches the amplifier.
==History==

In the 1920s, it was very hard for a musician playing a pickup-equipped guitar to find an amplifier and speaker to make their instrument louder as the only speakers that could be bought were &quot;radio horns of limited frequency range and low acoustic output&quot;. The cone speaker, widely used in 2000s-era amp cabinets, was not widely offered for sale until the 1930s and beyond. The first amplifiers and speakers could only be powered with large batteries, which made them heavy and hard to carry around. When engineers developed the first AC mains-powered amplifiers, they were soon used to make musical instruments louder.

Engineers invented the first loud, powerful amplifier and speaker systems for public address systems and movie theaters. These PA systems and movie theatre sound systems were very large and very expensive, and so they could not be used by most touring musicians. After 1927, smaller, portable AC mains-powered PA systems that could be plugged into a regular wall socket &quot;quickly became popular with musicians&quot;; indeed, &quot;...Leon McAuliffe (with Bob Wills) still used a carbon mic and a portable PA as late as 1935.&quot; During the late 1920s to mid-1930s, small portable PA systems and guitar combo amplifiers were fairly similar. These early amps had a &quot;single volume control and one or two input jacks, field coil speakers&quot; and thin wooden cabinets; remarkably, these early amps did not have tone controls or even an on-off switch.

In 1928, the Stromberg-Voisinet firm marketed an electric stringed instrument and amplifier package. There are no records as to how many—if any—of the amps were ever built and sold, beyond marketing materials. Stromberg-Voisinet still launched a new idea: a portable electric instrument amp with a speaker, all in a transportable wooden cabinet. In 1929, Vega electrics launched a portable banjo amplifier. In 1932, Electro String Instruments and amplifier (this is not the same company as Stromberg Electro Instruments) introduced a guitar amp with &quot;high output&quot; and a &quot;string driven magnetic pickup&quot;. Electro set out the standard template for combo amps: a wooden cabinet with the electronic amplifier mounted inside, and convenient carrying handles to facilitate transporting the cabinet. In 1933, Vivi-Tone amp set-ups were used for live performances and radio shows. In 1934, Rickenbacker launched a similar combo amp that added metal corner protectors to keep the corners in good condition during transportation.

In 1933, Dobro released an electric guitar and amp package. The combo amp had two 8&quot; Lansing speakers and a five-tube chassis. Dobro made a two speaker combo amp that was on the market over 12 years before Fender launched its two-speaker &quot;Dual Professional/Super&quot; combo amp. In 1933, Audio-Vox was founded by Paul Tutmarc, the inventor of the first electric bass (Tutmarc&#x27;s instrument did not achieve market success until Leo Fender&#x27;s launched the Precision Bass). In 1933, Vega sold a pickup and amplifier set for musicians to use with existing guitars.

In that same year, the Los Angeles-based Volu-Tone company also sold a pickup/amplifier set. Volu-Tone used &quot;high voltage current&quot; to sense the string vibration, a potentially dangerous approach that did not become popular. In 1934 Dobro released a guitar amp with a vacuum tube rectifier and two power tubes. By 1935, Dobro and National began selling combo amps for Hawaiian guitar. In 1934, Gibson had developed prototype combo amps, but never released them. By 1935, Electro/Rickenbacher had sold more amps and electric guitars than all the amps and electrified or electric guitars that had been made from 1928 through the end of 1934.

The first electric instrument amplifiers were not intended for electric guitars, but were portable PA systems. These appeared in the early 1930s when the introduction of electrolytic capacitors and rectifier tubes enabled economical built-in power supplies that could plug into wall sockets. Previously, amplifiers required heavy multiple battery packs. People used these amplifiers to amplify acoustic guitar, but electronic amplification of guitar first became widely popular in the 1930s and 1940s craze for Western Swing and Hawaiian music, which extensively used amplified lap steel guitars. In fact, the very first recording of an electrically amplified string instrument was the September 1933 recordings of Milton Brown and his Musical Brownies, featuring steel guitarist Bob Dunn

In the 1920s, the earliest combo amplifiers had no tone controls. The first tone controls were simple, mainly providing treble adjustment. The limited controls, the early loudspeakers, and the low amplifier power (typically 15 watts or less before the mid-1950s) gave poor high treble and bass output. Some models also provided effects such as an electronic tremolo unit. In confusion over nomenclature, Fender labeled early amplifier tremolo as &quot;vibrato&quot; and called the vibrato arm of the Stratocaster guitar a &quot;tremolo bar&quot; (see vibrato unit, electric guitar, and tremolo).

Some later amplifier models included an onboard spring reverb effect, one of the first being the Ampeg Reverberocket amp.

A bluesy-style guitarist by the name of Junior Barnard for the popular western swing band Bob Wills and his Texas Playboys, was the very first to create electric guitar distortion by deliberately overdriving his amplifier on a number of groundbreaking San Francisco recordings in 1946 and 1947, called the Tiffany Transcriptions. Another pioneer of electric guitar distortion who followed Barnard&#x27;s lead during the late 1940s was Sister Rosetta Tharpe. In the early 1950s, several guitarists experimented further with producing distortion. These included Goree Carter, Joe Hill Louis, Elmore James, Ike Turner, Willie Johnson, Pat Hare, Guitar Slim, Chuck Berry, Johnny Burnette, and Link Wray. In the early 1960s, surf rock guitarist Dick Dale worked closely with Fender to produce custom made amplifiers, including the first 100-watt guitar amplifier. He pushed the limits of electric amplification technology, helping to develop new equipment that was capable of producing &quot;thick, clearly defined tones&quot; at &quot;previously undreamed-of volumes.&quot;

Distortion became more popular from the mid-1960s, when The Kinks guitarist Dave Davies produced distortion effects by connecting the already distorted output of one amplifier into the input of another. Later, most guitar amps were provided with preamplifier distortion controls, and &quot;fuzz boxes&quot; and other effects units were engineered to safely and reliably produce these sounds. Overdrive and distortion have become integral parts of many styles of electric guitar playing, ranging from blues rock to heavy metal and hardcore punk.

Guitar combo amplifiers were at first used with bass guitars and electric pianos, but these instruments produce a wider frequency range and need a full-range speaker system. Much more amplifier power is required to reproduce low-frequency sound, especially at high volume. Reproducing low frequencies also requires a suitable woofer or subwoofer speaker and enclosure, with bass cabinets often being larger than a cabinet for mid-range or high-range sounds. As well, the open-back cabinets used on many electric guitar amps, while effective for electric guitar, do not have good bass reproduction.

Woofer enclosures must be larger and more sturdily built than cabinets for mid-range or high-frequency (tweeter) speakers. As such, in the 1950s, when Ampeg introduced bass amplifier and speaker systems, bass guitarists began to use them. Similarly, Hammond organ players used a specialized keyboard combo amplifier, the Leslie speaker cabinet, which contains a woofer for the low frequencies and a horn for the high frequencies. The Leslie horns rotate and a baffle around the woofer rotates as well, producing a rich tremolo and chorus effect.
==Structure==

Typically, guitar amplifiers have two amplifying circuit stages, and frequently have tone-shaping electric circuits, which usually include at least bass and treble controls, which function similarly to the equivalent controls on a home hi-fi system. More expensive amplifiers typically have more controls for other frequency ranges, such as one or two midrange controls and a presence control for high frequencies. Some guitar amplifiers have a graphic equalizer, which uses vertical faders to control multiple frequency bands. Some more expensive bass amps have a parametric equalizer, which enables precise control of tone.

The first amplifier stage is a preamplifier. It amplifies the audio signal to a level that can drive the power stage. The preamplifier also changes the tone of the signal; high preamp settings add overdrive. The power amplifier produces a high current signal to drive a loudspeaker and produce sound.

Various types of tone stages may affect the guitar signal:
* Settings on the guitar itself (passive tone controls, active equalizer circuits in built-in preamps, pickup selector switch position, etc.)
* Devices between the guitar and the preamp stage, such as a wah-wah pedal or other effects units, such as chorus or reverb.
* Between the preamp and power stages (an effects loop or some dedicated amplifier tone circuits)
* Between multiple stacked preamp stages (also called gain stages)
* In feedback loops from a post-preamp signal to an earlier pre-preamp signal (as in the case of presence modifier circuits)

Tone stages may also provide electronic effects—such as equalization, compression, distortion, chorus, or reverb. Amplifiers may use vacuum tubes (called valves in Britain), solid-state (transistor) devices, or both.

The two common guitar amplifier configurations are a combination (&quot;combo&quot;) amplifier that includes an amplifier and one or more speakers in a single cabinet, and a standalone amplifier (often called a &quot;head&quot; or &quot;amp head&quot;), which passes the amplified signal via a speaker cable to one or more external speaker cabinets. A wide range of speaker configurations are available in guitar cabinets—from cabinets with a single speaker (e.g., 1×10&quot; or 1×12&quot;) or multiple speakers (e.g., 2×10&quot;, 4×10&quot; or 8x10&quot;).

Guitar amplifiers vary widely in price and quality. Many music equipment companies import small, low-powered practice amplifiers for students and beginners that sell for less than $50. Other companies produce expensive custom-made amplifiers for professional musicians, which can cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars (USD). Most combo amplifiers have a carrying handle, and many combo amplifiers and cabinets have metal or plastic-reinforced corners to protect the amp during transportation.

Control knobs and buttons are typically on the front of the cabinet or chassis, though in some cases, the knobs are on a recessed panel at the back of the top of the amplifier. The most basic amps only have a few knobs, which typically control volume, bass, and treble. More expensive amps may have several knobs that control pre-amp volume (or gain), distortion or overdrive, volume, bass, mid and treble, and reverb. Some older amps (and their re-issued versions) have a knob that controls a vibrato or tremolo effect. The 1/4&quot; input jack is typically mounted on the front of the amplifier. In the simplest, least expensive amplifiers, this 1/4&quot; jack is the only jack on the amplifier.
More expensive amplifiers may have a patch bay for multiple inputs and outputs, such as a pre-amp out (for sending to another guitar amplifier), a second low gain input, to use with active basses, an in jack to create an effects loop (when used with the pre-amp out jack), an external speaker output (for powering an additional speaker cabinet), and stereo RCA jacks or a 1/8&quot; jack, for connecting a CD player or MP3 player so that a player can practice along with recorded music. Some amps have a 1/4&quot; jack for connecting a pedal to turn the amp&#x27;s onboard overdrive and reverb on and off or to switch between channels. Some amps have an XLR jack for a microphone, either for the guitar amp to be used for singing (in effect as a mini-PA system), or, for acoustic guitar, to mix a mic signal with a pickup signal.

The vast majority of guitar amps can only be powered by AC mains power (plugging into a wall outlet); however, a small number of practice amps are designed for buskers also have battery power so they can be used for street performances.
==Types==
A &quot;combo&quot; amp contains the amplifier and one or more speakers in a single cabinet. In a head and speaker cabinet configuration, the amplifier and speaker each have their own cabinet. The amplifier (head) may drive one or more speaker cabinets.

In the 1920s, guitarists played through public address amplifiers, but by the 1940s this was uncommon.

Besides instrument inputs and speaker outputs (typically via 1/4&quot; jacks), an amp may have other inputs and outputs. These can include an auxiliary input jack (sometimes with its own level control, for a drum machine), send and return jacks to create an effects loop, a line out jack, and an extension speaker jack. Practice amps sometimes have a 1/4&quot; headphone jack, or stereo RCA or mini jacks for connecting a CD player, portable media player or other sound sources. Some guitar amps have an XLR input so that a microphone can be plugged in for singing. Guitar amps that include a mic input are in effect small, portable PA systems. Some amps, typically bass amps, have an XLR connector to provide a balanced output from the preamp section to a PA system or recording input.

Instrument amplifiers are available in a wide range of price, quality, and performance levels. Some are designed for beginners, such as small, low-wattage &quot;practice amps&quot;, which typically have a single 8&quot; speaker and about 10 watts, or smaller combo amps with relatively low wattage (15 to 20 watts) and a single 10&quot; speaker. Mid- to large-size combo amps with 30 to 50 watts and one 12&quot; speaker or four 10&quot; speakers are best for high-volume situations, such as band rehearsals and onstage performances. For large venues, such as outdoor music festivals, guitarists may use one or more 100 watts (or several hundred watts) heads with one or more 8x10” cabinets.
===Vacuum tube===

Vacuum tubes (called valves in British English) were by far the dominant active electronic components in most instrument amplifier applications until the 1970s when solid-state semiconductors (transistors) started taking over. Transistor amplifiers are less expensive to build and maintain, reduce the weight and heat of an amplifier, and tend to be more reliable and more shock-resistant. Tubes are fragile and they must be replaced and maintained periodically. As well, serious problems with the tubes can render an amplifier inoperable until the issue is resolved.

While tube-based circuitry is technologically outdated, tube amps remain popular since many guitarists prefer their sound. Tube enthusiasts believe that tube amps produce a &quot;warmer&quot; sound and a more natural &quot;overdrive&quot; sound.
===Solid-state===

Most inexpensive and mid-priced guitar amplifiers are based on transistor or semiconductor (solid-state) circuits, which are cheaper to produce and more reliable, and usually much lighter than tube amplifiers. Solid-state amps are less fragile than tube amps.

High-end solid-state amplifiers are less common, since many professional guitarists favor vacuum tubes. Some jazz guitarists favor the &quot;cleaner&quot; sound of solid-state amplifiers. Only a few solid-state amps have enduring attraction, such as the Roland Jazz Chorus. Solid-state amplifiers vary in output power, functionality, size, price, and sound quality in a wide range, from practice amplifiers to combos suitable for gigging to professional models intended for session musicians who do studio recording work.

===Hybrid===
A hybrid amplifier involves one of two combinations of tube and solid-state amplification. It may have a tube power amp fed by a solid-state pre-amp circuit, as in most of the original MusicMan amplifiers.

Alternatively, a tube preamplifier can feed a solid-state output stage, as in models from Kustom, Hartke, SWR, and Vox. This approach dispenses with the need for an output transformer and easily achieves modern power levels.

===Modeling===
Microprocessor technology allows the use of digital onboard effects in guitar amps to create numerous different sounds and tones that simulate the sound of a range of tube amplifiers and different sized speaker cabinets, all using the same amplifier and speaker. These are known as modeling amplifiers, and can be programmed with simulated characteristic tones of different existing amplifier models (and speaker cabinets—even microphone type or placement), or dialed in to the user&#x27;s taste. Many amps of this type are also programmable by way of USB connection to a home computer or laptop. Line 6 is generally credited with bringing modeling amplification to the market. Modeling amplifiers and stompbox pedals, rackmount units, and software that models specific amplifiers, speakers cabinets, and microphones can provide a large number of sounds and tones. Players can get a reasonable facsimile of the sound of tube amplifiers, vintage combo amplifiers, and huge 8x10” speaker stacks without bringing all that heavy equipment to the studio or stage.

The use of full range, flat response (FRFR) amplification systems by electric guitarists has received an extra impetus from modeling amplifiers. Before widespread availability of modeling, guitarists did not commonly plug electric guitars straight into PA systems or powered speakers because most genres relied on the tonal coloration of a regular guitar amplifier setup—from the preamplifier, equalization filters, power amp, guitar speakers, and cabinet design. The FRFR approach assumes the tone is shaped by sound processors in the signal chain before the amplifier and speaker stage, so it strives to not add further coloration or dedicated combo-style amplifiers with a broad frequency range. Such processors can be traditional guitar effects, a modeling amplifier (without power amplifier), or a computer running tone-shaping software. Using a modeling amp or a multi-effects pedal used with line level output, a guitarist can plug in the guitar into a flat response mic input or into a keyboard amplifier.

===Acoustic===
&quot;Acoustic amplifiers&quot; are intended for acoustic guitars and other acoustic instruments, especially for the way these instruments are used in relatively quiet genres such as folk and bluegrass. They are similar to keyboard amplifiers, in that they have a relatively flat frequency response with minimal coloration. To produce this relatively clean sound, these amplifiers often have powerful amplifiers (providing up to 800 watts RMS), to provide additional headroom and prevent unwanted distortion. Since an 800-watt amplifier built with standard Class AB technology is heavy, some acoustic amplifier manufacturers use lightweight Class D amplifiers, which are also called switching amplifiers.

Acoustic amplifiers produce an uncolored, acoustic sound when used with acoustic instruments with built-in transducers, pickups or microphones. The amplifiers often come with a simple mixer, so that the signals from a pickup and a condenser microphone can be blended. Since the early 2000s, it has become increasingly common for acoustic amplifiers to provide a range of digital effects, such as reverb and compression. As well, these amplifiers often contain feedback-suppressing devices, such as notch filters or parametric equalizers.

==Stacks==
An amplifier stack consists of an amplifier head atop a speaker cabinet—a head on top of one cabinet is commonly called a &quot;half stack&quot;, a head atop two cabinets a &quot;full-stack&quot;. The cabinet that the head sits on often has an angled top in front, while the lower cabinet of a full stack has a straight front. The first version of the &quot;Marshall stack&quot; was an amp head on an 8×12 cabinet, meaning a single speaker cabinet containing eight 12&quot; guitar speakers. After six of these cabinets were made, the cabinet arrangement was changed to an amp head on two 4×12 (four 12&quot; speakers) cabinets to make the cabinets more transportable. Some touring metal and rock bands have used a large array of guitar speaker cabinets for their impressive appearance. Some of these arrangements include only the fronts of speaker cabinets mounted on a large frame.

There are many varieties of speaker combinations used in guitar speaker cabinets, including one 12&quot; speaker, one 15&quot; speaker (this is more common for bass amplifiers than for electric guitar cabinets), two 10&quot; speakers, four 10&quot; speakers, four 12&quot; speakers, or eight 10&quot; speakers. Less commonly, guitar cabinets may contain different sizes of speakers in the same cabinet. Cabinets with eight 10&quot; speakers are large and heavy, and they are often equipped with wheels and a &quot;towel bar&quot;-style handle for transport. Some cabinets use mixed speaker types, such as one 15&quot; speaker and two 10&quot; speakers.
==Cabinet design==
Combo guitar amplifier cabinets and guitar speaker cabinets use several different designs, including the open back cabinet, the closed back cabinet (a sealed box), and, less commonly, bass reflex designs, which use a closed back with a vent or port cut into the cabinet. With guitar amps, most open back amp cabinets are not fully open; part of the back is enclosed with panels. Combo guitar amp cabinets and standalone speaker cabinets are often made of plywood. Some are made of MDF or particle board—especially in low-budget models. Cabinet size and depth, material types, assembly methods, type and thickness of the baffle material (the wood panel that holds the speaker), and the way the baffle attaches to the cabinet all affect tone.

When two or more speakers are used in the same cabinet, or when two cabinets are used together, the speakers can be wired in parallel or in series, or in a combination of the two (e.g., two 2x10&quot; cabinets, with the two speakers wired in series, can be connected together in parallel). Whether speakers are wired in parallel or in series affects the impedance of the system. Two 8 ohm speakers wired in parallel have 4-ohm impedance. Guitarists who connect multiple cabinets to an amplifier must consider the amp&#x27;s minimum impedance. Parallel vs. series also affects tone and sound. Speakers wired in parallel slightly dampen[s] and restrain[s] them, giving what some describe as &quot;tighter response&quot; and &quot;smoother breakup&quot;. Some describe speakers wired in series (usually no more than two) as sounding &quot;...looser, giving a slightly more raw, open and edgy sound.&quot;

==Distortion, power, and volume==

===Power output===
The relationship between power output in watts and perceived volume is not immediately obvious. The human ear perceives a 5-watt amplifier as half as loud as a 50-watt amplifier (a tenfold increase in power), and a half-watt amplifier is a quarter as loud as a 50-watt amp. Due to this logarithmic scale, doubling the output power of an amplifier results in a just noticeable increase in volume, so a 100-watt amplifier is only just noticeably louder than a 50-watt amplifier. Such generalizations are also subject to the human ear&#x27;s tendency to behave as a natural compressor at high volumes.

Power attenuation can be used with either low-power or high-power amplifiers, resulting in variable-power amplifiers. A high-power amplifier with power attenuation can produce power-tube distortion through a range of listening volumes but with a decrease in high-power distortion. Other technologies, such as dual rectifiers and the sag circuit—which should not be confused with attenuation—allow high-power amplifiers to produce low power volume while preserving high power distortion.

Speaker efficiency is also a major factor affecting a tube amplifier&#x27;s maximum volume.

For bass instruments, higher-power amplifiers are needed to reproduce low-frequency sounds. While an electric guitarist would be able to play at a small club with a 50-watt amplifier, a bass player performing in the same venue would probably need an amplifier with 200 or more watts.

===Distortion and volume===
Distortion is a feature available on many guitar amplifiers that is not typically found on keyboard or bass guitar amplifiers. Tube guitar amplifiers can produce distortion through pre-distortion equalization, preamp tube distortion, post-distortion EQ, power-tube distortion, tube rectifier compression, output transformer distortion, guitar speaker distortion, and guitar speaker and cabinet frequency response. Because many factors beyond preamp distortion contribute to a particular guitarist&#x27;s sound, recording engineers and PA system techs typically put a microphone in front of the guitar speaker, rather than only use the guitar amp&#x27;s pre-amp out signal. A sound engineer or music producer may send the DI out signal from the pickups to a separate track at the same time, so they can re-amp the signal later. In contrast, it is fairly common to use a DI box with electric bass.

Distortion sound or &quot;texture&quot; from guitar amplifiers is further shaped or processed through the frequency response and distortion factors in the microphones (their response, placement, and multi-microphone comb filtering effects), microphone preamps, mixer channel equalization, and compression. Additionally, the basic sound produced by the guitar amplifier can be changed and shaped by adding distortion and/or equalization effect pedals before the amp&#x27;s input jack, in the effects loop just before the tube power amp, or after the power tubes.

====Power-tube distortion====
Power-tube distortion is required for amp sounds in some genres. In a standard master-volume guitar amp, as the amp&#x27;s final or master volume is increased beyond the full power of the amplifier, power-tube distortion is produced. The &quot;power soak&quot; approach places the attenuation between the power tubes and the guitar speaker. In the re-amped or &quot;dummy load&quot; approach, the tube power amp drives a mostly resistive dummy load while an additional low power amp drives the guitar speaker. In the isolation box approach, the guitar amplifier is used with a guitar speaker in a separate cabinet. A soundproofed isolation cabinet, isolation box, isolation booth, or isolation room can be used.

===Volume controls===
A variety of labels are used for level attenuation potentiometers (knobs) in a guitar amplifier and other guitar equipment. Electric guitars and basses have a volume control on the instrument that attenuates the signal from selected pickups. There may be two volume controls on an electric guitar or bass, wired in parallel to mix the signal levels from the neck and bridge pickups. Rolling back the guitar&#x27;s volume control also changes the pickup&#x27;s equalization or frequency response, which can provide pre-distortion equalization.

The simplest guitar amplifiers, such as some vintage amps and modern practice amps, have only a single volume control. Most have two volume controls: a first volume control called &quot;preamplifier&quot; or &quot;gain&quot; and a master volume control. The preamp or gain control works differently on different guitar amp designs. On an amp designed for acoustic guitar, turning up the preamp knob pre-amplifies the signal—but even at its maximum setting, the preamp control is unlikely to produce much overdrive. However, with amps designed for electric guitarists playing blues, hard rock and heavy metal music, turning up the preamp or gain knob usually produces overdrive distortion. Some electric guitar amps have three controls in the volume section: pre-amplifier, distortion, and master control. Turning up the preamp and distortion knobs in varying combinations can create a range of overdrive tones, from a gentle, warm growling overdrive suitable for a traditional blues show or a rockabilly band to the extreme distortion used in hardcore punk and death metal. On some electric guitar amps, the &quot;gain&quot; knob is equivalent to the distortion control on a distortion pedal and similarly may have a side-effect of changing the proportion of bass and treble sent to the next stage.

A simple, inexpensive amplifier may have only two tone controls, a passive bass and treble control. In some better-quality amps, one or more midrange controls are provided. On the most expensive amps, there may be shelving equalizers for bass and treble, several mid-range controls (e.g., low mid, mid, and high mid), and a graphic equalizer or parametric equalizer. The amplifier&#x27;s master volume control restricts the amount of signal permitted through to the driver stage and the power amplifier. When using a power attenuator with a tube amplifier, the master volume no longer acts as the master volume control. Instead, the power attenuator&#x27;s attenuation control controls the power delivered to the speaker, and the amplifier&#x27;s master volume control determines the amount of power-tube distortion. Power-supply-based power reduction is controlled by a knob on the tube power amp, variously labeled &quot;wattage&quot;, &quot;power&quot;, &quot;scale&quot;, &quot;power scale&quot;, or &quot;power dampening&quot;.
===In popular culture===
Volume control gradations are typically numbered from zero to ten. In the 1984 film &quot;This Is Spinal Tap,&quot; guitarist Nigel Tufnel demonstrates an amplifier whose volume knobs are marked from zero to eleven, believing that this numbering increases the highest volume of the amp. He explains, &quot;It&#x27;s one louder, isn&#x27;t it?&quot; This misunderstanding of the underlying operating principles led to the idiom &quot;Up to eleven&quot;, also phrased as &quot;These go to eleven&quot;. As a consequence of the film, real bands and musicians started buying equipment whose knobs went up to eleven.

<doc id="320415" wikidata="Q2413243" url="?curid=320415" title="The Orchard (company)">
<text>The Orchard Enterprises NY, Inc., doing business as The Orchard (also known as The Orchard Music), is an American music and entertainment company, specializing in media distribution. It is a subsidiary of Sony Music Entertainment, based in New York City. In 2019, the company sold off its film and television division, which was renamed 1091 Media.

== History ==

The company was founded in 1997 by Scott Cohen and Richard Gottehrer in New York City.

In early 2003, The Orchard was bought by Dimensional Associates. Danny Stein, the CEO of Dimensional Associates, was appointed Executive Chairman, and Greg Scholl left management consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Company to become The Orchard&#x27;s CEO, changing its strategy and operating model and building a new management team. In 2009, Scholl accepted a position as president, Local Integrated Media at NBCUniversal and Brad Navin was appointed CEO.

In 2012, Sony acquired a majority stake of 51% in the company in a cash and equity deal with an estimated total valuation of $100 million. In 2015, the remaining equity in the company was acquired by Sony Music Entertainment for over $200 million.

=== IODA ===
IODA (Independent Online Distribution Alliance) was a global sales, marketing and distribution company with majority stake owned by Sony. The subsidiary serviced independent artists, labels, filmmakers and other content providers on digital and mobile outlets, including making copyright claims on online content. IODA had relationships with major mobile and online download retailers including iTunes, eMusic, Rhapsody, and Amazon.com.

On July 1, 2009, Sony Music Entertainment and IODA announced their global strategic partnership to leverage combined worldwide online retail distribution networks and complementary technologies to support independent labels and music rightsholders.

On March 5, 2012, Sony acquired the remaining stake of IODA. The company&#x27;s operations were merged with the Orchard.

=== YouTube programming and fraudulent claiming ===
The Orchard&#x27;s YouTube multi-channel network has more than 1,000 channels across the globe and uses technology, built in-house, called B.A.C.O.N. (Bulk Automated Claiming on The Orchard Network) to crawl, claim and track YouTube videos to monetize for their clients. It was ranked 7th in the U.S. in July 2014.

YouTube users have expressed concerns about The Orchard claiming copyright ownership of music used in user-generated content that may or may not belong to them. According to an article by The Orchard on their Daily Rind blog, if audio is matched to a particular copyright owner via YouTube&#x27;s content identification system, then one or more links will be placed under the video in order to help promote the copyright owner&#x27;s music, with the video remaining available. The article states that erroneous claims are removed by The Orchard Team after review upon email communication with their dispute department. However, they are not timely in their response, which leads some YouTube users (or copyright/original content owners/creators) to believe The Orchard is attempting to acquire AdSense revenue falsely from claims that go undisputed.

The Orchard along with Rumblefish Inc. was subject to a 2019 copyfraud dispute regarding a public domain performance by the United States Navy Band uploaded onto YouTube. A 2019 case study noted examples of The Orchard selling music works and digital ad revenue online without permission of the artists in the 2010 case &quot;Bryant v. Media Right Productions, Inc.&quot;

=== Owned labels ===
The Orchard owns the catalogues of TVT Records, Premium Latin Music (home to Aventura), Blind Pig Records, Frenchkiss Records, Shrapnel Records, and Music of the World.

=== Film distribution ===
In 2019, the Orchard Film was sold and renamed 1091 Media.

== BalconyTV ==
BalconyTV is an online music channel launched in June 2006, featuring acoustic performances on balconies around the world. In 2007, it won Best Music Website at the Irish Digital Media Awards, and was nominated for Best Viral Video Content at the Webby Awards in 2008. Since then, the channel has expanded to hosting over 12,000 shows in over 50 cities, and more than 25 countries.

The channel was acquired by The Orchard in 2014.

<text>Raunds is a market town in North Northamptonshire, England. It had a population of 9,379 at the 2021 census.

== Geography ==
Raunds is situated north-east of Northampton. The town is on the southern edge of the Nene Valley and surrounded by arable farming land.

Nearest civilian airports are Luton 50 miles, Birmingham International Airport 62 miles and East Midlands 65 miles.

Raunds is close to Stanwick Lakes, a country park developed from gravel pits and managed by the Rockingham Forest Trust. This park is internationally recognised for its birdlife and can be reached on foot from Raunds along Meadow Lane bridleway.

On 9 August 1911 Raunds recorded , then the highest temperature recorded in the UK. The town jointly held the record with Canterbury, Kent for 79 years, only being broken in 1990.

== History ==
In the mid-1980s, during sand excavations in the Nene Valley, the remains of a Roman villa were discovered. Excavation of the area, near Stanwick, was delayed by several years while archaeologists studied the remains. In 2002 Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Time Team&quot; excavated a garden and found remains of an Anglo-Saxon cemetery.

The place-name Raunds is first attested in an Anglo-Saxon charter of c. 972–992, where it appears as &quot;Randan&quot;. It appears as &quot;Rande&quot; in Domesday Book (1086); and as &quot;Raundes&quot; in a later survey of Northamptonshire. The name is the plural of the Old English &quot;rand&quot;, meaning &quot;border&quot;.

Raunds played a role in the boot and shoe industry until its decline in the 1950s and 1960s. In 1905 a dispute arose about wages to be paid to army bootmakers, which culminated in a march to London in May that year. Several factories remained into the early 1990s but all are now closed, with many being demolished and housing estates built. The Coggins boot factory was the last to go, and the site of it is now Coggins Close. The land on which the shoe factory and the original Coggins houses stood (not Coggins Close), was purchased by Robert Coggins on 25 February 1899 from the Duchy of Lancaster, for the sum of £14.10s.0d (£14.50). The houses are still there, but were sold to Charles Robinson of Wellingborough in 1934. Robert Coggins lived in the hall where his picture hangs in the meeting room, and he is buried in St Peter&#x27;s Churchyard. There is no industry in the town now, although there are some industrial sites on the outskirts.

Raunds once held the record for the highest temperature in Britain at , set on 10 August 1911, which stood until 1990.

== Notable buildings ==

The Historic England website contains details of a total of 19 listed buildings and six scheduled monuments at or in the vicinity of Raunds. Amongst them are:
* St Peter&#x27;s Church, Church Street.
* The Manor House, 2 Manor Street.

St Peter&#x27;s, CoE is in the Diocese of Peterborough and St Thomas More&#x27;s, RC is in the Diocese of Northampton.

== Demography ==
* In 1801 there were 800 persons
* In 1831 there were 1,370 persons
* In 1841 there were 1,653 persons
* In 2011 there were 8,641 persons
* In 2021 there were 9,379 persons

== Transport ==

===Road===
Raunds is adjacent to the A45 and close to the A14 jct 13. Access to the M1 and A1 is close and the A14 runs from Britain&#x27;s largest container port at Felixstowe in Suffolk to join the M6. Consequently, the area attracts distribution companies warehouses.

===Bus===
Bus services are limited, the X46 links the town with Wellingborough, Rushden and Northampton, running hourly. There are intermittent routes to Huntingdon and a local service termed the &#x27;Raunds Rover&#x27;.

===Rail===
Connections are provided by East Midlands Railway from Wellingborough and Kettering railway stations, for direct trains to London St Pancras International, Nottingham, Sheffield and Leeds.

There was once a Raunds railway station, on the Midland Railway&#x27;s cross-country line from Kettering to Huntingdon, closed in September 1959, and which gave access to St Ives and Cambridge, though Raunds station was sited miles from the town. It was also planned that the Midland&#x27;s Wellingborough to Higham Ferrers branch, also closed in 1959, would continue to Raunds, but landowners prevented it.

The Manchester, Sheffield &amp; Lincolnshire Railway (the forerunner of the Great Central), proposed a line from Doncaster to Raunds in an early version of its bid to build a trunk line to the capital. This line never came to fruition, and the company eventually built its London Extension via Nottingham, Leicester, Rugby and Brackley.

===Waterways===
Stanwick Lakes are within walking or cycling distance of Raunds, and river ways connect to the Nene Valley river section. By boat, Oundle can be reached in a day. The Nene Valley river section connects to the Middle Level Navigation System, making it possible to reach Cambridge and Peterborough. The nearest marina is Willy Watt&#x27;s in Ringstead, Northamptonshire.

== Trade ==
There are many small businesses and many people commute to larger centres for work. Raunds is home to a Hotpoint distribution centre, and depots for Robert Wiseman Dairies, Avery Dennison, DPD, Howdens Joinery and Dr. Martens, all located on the Warth Park estate. Raunds Co-operative Society ran a supermarket and department store and had 4,000 members until 2007 when it merged with the larger Midlands Co-operative Society. There is also an Asda store in the town, which opened on 24 April 2017. The shops still operate.

A market is held on Fridays in the square. Regular stalls include butchers, plant stockists, home-made jewellery and confectioners. Local organisations and clubs can also set up a stall.

==Education==
Raunds has:
*a day nursery
*a playgroup
*an infant school
*a primary school
*a junior school
*a secondary school,

== Culture ==
Raunds holds an annual music festival over a weekend in early May. Events include: rock, jazz and folk concerts starring nationally and internationally known artists, performances by Raunds Community Choir and Raunds Temperance Band, song and tune sessions, dancing displays, a ceilidh and an annual youth dance competition.

Raunds Music and Drama Society (MADS) holds several stage performances throughout the year.

The town holds a Christmas festival in the square. Continental markets are held annually to celebrate neighbouring countries.

<doc id="320422" wikidata="Q1987237" url="?curid=320422" title="Rushden">
<text>Rushden is a town and civil parish in the North Northamptonshire district, in the ceremonial county of Northamptonshire, England, around east of Northampton. The parish is on the border with Bedfordshire, north of Bedford.

The parish of Rushden covers an area of some . The population of Rushden is 32,038, making it the fifth largest town in the county. The larger urban area, which includes the adjoining town of Higham Ferrers, has a population of 40,865.

==Location==

Rushden lies on the A6 midway between Bedford and Kettering. The southern limits of the town border on the county of Bedfordshire, and to its north lies the River Nene (locally pronounced Nen) which flows into The Wash. Rushden lies in a small valley, with a stream or brook known as Sidney Brook flowing through the centre of the town. During the late 1960s and 70s this stream was culverted to prevent flash flooding. From whichever way Rushden is approached, the streets and roads can be seen stretching out in the valley, with the spire of St Mary&#x27;s church prominent above its rooftops.

==Governance==

Gen Kitchen MP is the local MP representing Wellingborough. As a result of recent electoral changes, Rushden has been divided into five wards for both District and Town Council purposes. With the following re-classifications: Rushden Spencer (formerly North), Rushden Hayden (formerly East), Rushden Bates (formerly South), Rushden Sartoris (formerly South) and Rushden Pemberton (formerly West). Rushden Urban District Council, which was based at the Council Buildings in Newton Road, was the local authority until 1974 when the town became part of East Northamptonshire.

Since local government reorganisation in 2020 abolished Northamptonshire County Council and the county&#x27;s seven district councils, the town has become part of the new unitary authority of North Northamptonshire, one of two newly formed unitary authorities in the ceremonial county of Northamptonshire (the other being West Northamptonshire).

==History==
The town&#x27;s name means &#x27;valley which is rushy&#x27;.

Rushden&#x27;s growth has resulted from a number of industries, including lacemaking and farming, and especially shoemaking and associated trades. In the mid-1900s there were well over 100 boot and shoe factories in Rushden but today there are only four shoemaking companies left in Rushden.

The novelist and short story writer H.E.Bates who grew up in Rushden based many of his stories, notably &quot;Love for Lydia&quot; in Rushden, changing its name to Evensford. Notable for his powers of description when it comes to nature he recorded the past beauties of the surrounding countryside as he remembered it from the 10s through to the forties, before much was destroyed by developments. He also gives childhood glimpses of vanished ways of life of many countryfolk, such as in the short stories, &quot;The Watercress Girl&quot;, &quot;The Mower&quot;, &quot;The Cowslip Field&quot;, and &quot;Great Uncle Crow&quot;. He often mentions the leather factories and bootmaking of &quot;Evensford&quot; (Rushden), and how the air in the town was often permeated with the smell of leather and its processing agents.
One of the most renowned is Sanders and Sanders, who make boots for the British Army and several other defence departments throughout the world. Some of the redundant factories have been converted into flats, and MPs support for government help has been limited. Today, as with many towns in England, industry in the town is varied, and mostly situated in an out-of-town industrial estate. As with the industry, town centre shopping in Rushden has changed considerably although there are still many shops. Rushden has the oldest toy shop in the county. In 1893 a short branch line railway opened linking Rushden and Higham Ferrers with the Midland Main Line. The line was closed in 1959 and dismantled. In 1991 the trackbed was converted into a pocket park.
The former Rushden railway station is now owned by the Rushden Historical Transport Society, which operates a museum and real ale bar. The society often holds special events, including an annual 3-day transport cavalcade. The society aims to rebuild the branch line from Higham Ferrers to Wellingborough.

There is also a privately owned museum in Rushden which is situated in the town&#x27;s Hall Park. It is open between the months of May and October.

Rushden Hall is the oldest domestic building in the town, once owned by many families throughout the years including the Sartoris family and the Pembertons family. The hall now functions as the head office of the town council and some rooms are available for hiring. It lies in of land which now is a public park (Hall Park).

The 1970s ITV Police Drama series &quot;Hunters Walk&quot; was filmed on location in Rushden and the surrounding villages.

==Modern times==
In late 2010, Rushden began to undergo a regeneration project, with the aim to making the town centre a more spacious and attractive place to shop. Rushden Splash Pool on Station Road and the Pemberton Centre, slightly out of town were planned to move to a new site to make room for in the town centre from the move of Splash and a knock on move of Alfred Street School to the Site of the Pemberton Centre. Plans were drawn up for a move to Manor Park, an open space out of town to the south side of Rushden. This however was put on hold in 2010 due widespread local opposition and the economic downturn.

In early 2011, improvements to the High Street began with regeneration on the ‘southern gateway’ and a creation of a &#x27;town square&#x27; in the middle of the High Street.

Also a greenway cycle and foot path was created joining existing footpaths with a new one along the old railway line through the town. This linked Ferrers School to Rushden town centre and then out of Rushden to Crown Park retail park.

==Retail==
Rushden has many supermarkets and convenience stores.

===Rushden Lakes===

A new £140 million out of town leisure and shopping centre known as Rushden Lakes Shopping Centre opened in July 2017. The development is situated near Waitrose just off the A45, on the site of the former Skew Bridge dry ski slope, also referred to as Rushden Lakes, which had been derelict for some years.

The land was purchased by LXB Retail Properties for £4.5 million in 2011 and the development was later sold to The Crown Estate. When finalised, the development will include a cinema, shops, hotels, visitor centre, restaurants, a leisure centre and a marina, with Marks &amp; Spencer as its flagship store. A link to the River Nene will also be incorporated. The new facility will create around 2,000 jobs. Despite opposition from the local councils of Corby, Northampton, Bedford and Kettering, the Rushden Lakes proposal was approved by East Northants Council in October 2012, but the application was automatically referred to the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State, Eric Pickles, approved the planning application and gave the go-ahead for the Rushden Lakes development on 12 June 2014.

Rushden Lakes the first section of the area opened on 28 July 2017, with shop opening on the same day. Further shops opened on both the west and east side of the retail area. In July 2019 work was finished on a multiplex building which included indoor activities and a multiscreen cinema. While the site itself is currently complete there have been plans submitted to build further next to the site and to improve road access from the A45.

==Sports and recreation==

===Leisure facilities===
Rushden has two main leisure facilities, The Pemberton Centre and Splash Pool. Both are managed by Freedom Leisure, as so membership covers both venues. The Pemberton Centre is a large leisure and conference centre including a large hall, conference rooms, sport hall, gym, young person&#x27;s gym, squash courts and dance studio. The Splash Pool is situated close to the town centre and includes a swimming pool with a learner area, beach area and indoor slide.

===Football===
The town&#x27;s former football club, Rushden Town, merged with nearby Irthlingborough Diamonds in 1992 to become Rushden &amp; Diamonds. The new club moved to Nene Park, on the outskirts of Irthlingborough, and played there until going into liquidation in 2011.

A new club AFC Rushden &amp; Diamonds, who play in the Northern Premier League (the 8th division of English Football) was set up in 2011 which has groundshared with Rushden &amp; Higham United at the latter&#x27;s Hayden Road ground from the 2017–18 season. This is the same stadium where Rushden Town played until 1992.

Junior football is catered for by AFC Rushden &amp; Diamonds Youth which offer football for boys and girls from 4 years of age.

===Rugby Union===
Rugby Union is played at Manor Park, the home of Rushden &amp; Higham RUFC. The club was created in October 1951. Over the years the club has played at Chamberlain&#x27;s Field, near the old Higham railway station, Saffron Meadows, and the John White&#x27;s ground in Rushden and now plays at Manor Park, Rushden, on pitches rented weekly from the town council.

===Cricket===
Rushden and Higham Town Cricket Club have 3 senior XI teams in the Northamptonshire Cricket League, and an established Junior Section, who compete in the Higham &amp; District Youth League. Rushden also field a Sunday XI team who play friendly matches in and around the region.

===Golf===
Rushden has two golf courses. A 9-hole course south of Rushden called John Whites also houses a driving range. Rushden Golf Club is a larger 18 hole course to the East of Rushden.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC East and ITV Anglia. Television signals are received from the Sandy Heath TV transmitter.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Northampton, Heart East, Smooth East Midlands (formerly Connect FM) and Beat Route Radio, community based radio station.

The town is served by the local newspaper, Northamptonshire Evening Telegraph.

==Cadets==

===Sea Cadets Corps===
Rushden Unit (No. 639) of the Sea Cadet Corps, also known as Rushden Sea Cadets or Training Ship (TS) Diamond, is a volunteer led registered charity (Charity No: 1194526) and is governed and overseen by the Marine Society and Sea Cadets (MSSC) - a national youth organisation that provides a wide range activities to over 15,000 youngsters between the age of 9–17, at almost 400 locations throughout the UK.

Sea Cadets provides opportunities for young people to go on great adventures, meet new friends and get involved in all kinds of fun and challenging activities, such as sailing, wind-surfing, rowing and power boating. But there is more to Sea Cadets than most people might imagine. Sea Cadet activities are based on the roles of the Naval Service, which encompasses the Royal Navy, Royal Marines and Fleet Air Arm. These activities include general military training, such as marching and looking after uniform, but also more specialist activities such as boating, adventurous training (including Duke of Edinburgh awards), catering, fitness training, aviation and engineering (plus many more). These allow you to learn new life skills whilst gaining self-confidence, respect, leadership and the ability to work as part of a team. Above all, the aim is that the cadets have fun and adventure with new friends.

The Sea Cadets work in partnership with nationally recognised bodies such as the Royal Yachting Association, the British Canoe Union, Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Award Scheme and the Cadet Vocational Qualification Office, which enable cadets to earn nationally recognised qualifications and skills for life.

Rushden Sea Cadets was established as an independent unit of the Sea Cadet Corps on 23 May 2014 and is based at the Drill Hall, Victoria Road, Rushden, NN10 0AS. There are two sections within Rushden Sea Cadets:

Junior Sea Cadets is specifically for age 9 - 11 and routinely meets on Tuesday evenings 1900–2030.

Sea Cadets is for ages 12 – 17 and routinely meets on Friday evenings 1900–2100.

In addition to operating from the Drill Hall in Rushden, Rushden Sea Cadets also has access to other Sea Cadet training facilities around the country, as well as some MOD establishments. This includes the regional inshore boating centre at Thrapston, and access to HMS Raleigh in Torpoint. The charity also owns 5 offshore vessels which are used for training and adventure experiences at sea - these include 2 large yachts, 2 power cruisers and a Tall Ship.

=== 858 (Rushden) Squadron, Air Training Corps ===
Rushden has its own Air Cadet Squadron, No 858 (Rushden) Squadron Royal Air Force Air Cadets (formerly the Air Training Corps), based at the Drill Hall on Victoria Road. It is run by officers commissioned in the Royal Air Force Air Cadets, (formerly the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve (Training Branch)), assisted by adult Senior NCO’s and Civilian Instructors, all of which are civilian volunteers.

==Transport==

===Rail===
At present, Rushden is one of the largest towns in the country without an operational railway station. However, there are proposals by The Association of Train Operating Companies to build a new railway station on the Midland Main Line (to the West of Rushden) to be known as Rushden Parkway. This is supported by local transport campaigners. Currently, the nearest railway station is at Wellingborough about five miles (8
 km) away, on the Midland Main Line, although no bus service currently links Rushden to Wellingborough station - the X46 bus service stops at Midland Road in Wellingborough about half a mile from the station.

The heritage Rushden, Higham and Wellingborough Railway currently operate services from Rushden&#x27;s station.

===Bus===
The main routes serving Rushden are Stagecoach services 50/49 with connections to Kettering and Bedford and the X46/47 providing links with Raunds, Wellingborough, Irchester and Northampton. There are also services that connect Rushden to the small villages in North Bedfordshire and has its own bus service within the town, the Rushden-Higham link. The Link runs 3 routes and are:

===Air===
Several major UK airports are only within 60 miles or 1 hour driving distance of the town, including Luton, East Midlands, Birmingham and Stansted.

===Road===
In terms of roads, Rushden is bypassed by the A6 which has connections to Kettering (Northbound) and Bedford and Luton (Southbound). The A45 connects Rushden to the East coast as well as Northampton and the M1 motorway westbound.

<doc id="320425" wikidata="Q1631988" url="?curid=320425" title="Single-bullet theory">
<text>The single-bullet theory, also known as the magic-bullet theory by conspiracy theorists, was introduced by the Warren Commission in its investigation of the assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy to explain what happened to the bullet that struck Kennedy in the back and exited through his throat. Given the lack of damage to the presidential limousine consistent with it having been struck by a high-velocity bullet, and the fact that Texas Governor John Connally was wounded and was seated on a jumper seat in front of and slightly to the left of the president, the Commission concluded they were likely struck by the same bullet.

Generally credited to Warren Commission staffer Arlen Specter (later a United States senator from Pennsylvania), this theory posits that a single bullet, known as &quot;Warren Commission Exhibit 399&quot; or &quot;CE 399&quot;, caused all the wounds to the governor and the non-fatal wounds to the president, which totals up to seven entry/exit wounds in both men.

The theory says that a three-centimeter-long (1.2&quot;) copper-jacketed lead-core rifle bullet from a Model 91/38 Carcano, fired from the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository, passed through President Kennedy&#x27;s neck into Governor Connally&#x27;s chest, went through his right wrist, and embedded itself in Connally&#x27;s left thigh. If so, this bullet traversed a back brace, 15 layers of clothing, seven layers of skin, and approximately of muscle tissue, and pulverized of Connally&#x27;s rib, and shattered his radius bone. The bullet was found on a gurney in the corridor at Parkland Memorial Hospital after the assassination. The Warren Commission found that this gurney was the one that had carried Governor Connally.
In its final conclusion, the Warren Commission found &quot;persuasive evidence from the experts&quot; that a single bullet caused President Kennedy&#x27;s throat wound, and all of the wounds found in Governor Connally. It acknowledged that there was a &quot;difference of opinion&quot; among members of the Commission &quot;as to this probability&quot;, but stated that the theory was not essential to its conclusions and that all members had no doubt that all shots were fired from the sixth-floor window of the Depository building.

Most critics believe that the single-bullet theory is essential to the Warren Commission&#x27;s conclusion that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone. The reason for this is timing: if, as the Warren Commission found, President Kennedy was wounded some time between frames 210 and 225 of the Zapruder film, and Governor Connally was wounded in the back/chest no later than frame 240, there would not have been enough time between the wounding of the two men for Oswald to have fired two shots from his bolt-action rifle. FBI marksmen, who test-fired the rifle for the Warren Commission, concluded that the &quot;minimum time for getting off two successive well-aimed shots on the rifle is approximately 2 and a quarter seconds&quot;, or 41 to 42 Zapruder frames.

The United States House Select Committee on Assassinations published their report in 1979 stating that their &quot;forensic pathology panel&#x27;s conclusions were consistent with the so-called single bullet theory advanced by the Warren Commission&quot;.

==Origin==
The first preliminary report on the assassination, issued by the FBI on December 9, 1963, said: &quot;Three shots rang out. Two bullets struck President Kennedy, and one wounded Governor Connally.&quot; After the report was written, the FBI received the official autopsy report which indicated that the bullet that struck the president in the back had exited through his throat. The FBI had written its report partly based on an initial autopsy report written by its agents which reflected the early presumption that that bullet had only penetrated several inches into the president&#x27;s back and had likely fallen out. The FBI concluded, therefore, that the governor had been struck by a separate bullet.

The Warren Commission commenced study of the Zapruder film, the only known film to capture the entire assassination sequence, on January 27, 1964. By then, the FBI had determined that the running speed of Abraham Zapruder&#x27;s camera was 18.3 frames per second, and that the Carcano rifle found at the Texas School Book Depository, the presumed murder weapon, could not be accurately fired twice in under 2.3 seconds, or 42 frames of the Zapruder film.

When the Commission requested and received after February 25 higher-resolution images of the Zapruder film from &quot;Life&quot; magazine, who had purchased the film from Zapruder, it was immediately apparent that there was a timing problem with the FBI&#x27;s conclusion that three bullets had found their mark. Kennedy was observed by the Commission to be waving to the crowd at frame 205 of the Zapruder film as he disappears behind the Stemmons Freeway sign, and seems to be reacting to a shot as he emerges from behind the sign a little more than a second later at frames 225 and 226. In their initial viewing of the film, Connally seemed to be reacting to being struck between frames 235 and 240.

Given the earliest possible frame at which Kennedy could have been struck (frame 205), and the minimum 42 frames (2.3 seconds) required between shots, there seemed to be insufficient time for separate bullets to be fired from the rifle. Several assistant counsels, upon viewing the film for the first time, concluded there had to be two assassins.

On April 14 and 21, two conferences were held at the Commission to determine when, exactly, the president and governor were struck. Assistant counsel Melvin Eisenberg wrote in a memorandum dated April 22 on the first conference that the consensus of those attending was, among other issues, that Kennedy was struck by frames 225–6 and that &quot;the velocity of the first bullet [which struck Kennedy] would have been little diminished by its passage through the President. Therefore, if Governor Connally was in the path of the bullet it would have struck him and caused the wounds he sustained in his chest cavity... Strong indications that this occurred are provided by the facts that... if the first bullet did not strike Governor Connally, it should have ripped up the car but it apparently did not.&quot;

However, the memorandum stated, given the relatively undamaged condition of the bullet presumed to have done this, CE 399, the consensus was a separate bullet probably struck his wrist and thigh. While not specifying a precise frame for when it was thought Connally was struck by the same bullet which struck Kennedy, the consensus was &quot;by Z235&quot; as afterwards his body position would not have allowed his back to be struck the way it was.

By the end of April 1964, the Commission had its working theory, the single-bullet theory, to account for the apparent timing discrepancies found in the Zapruder film and the lack of any damage to the limousine from a high-velocity bullet exiting the president&#x27;s throat. Impact damage was observed in the limousine, but was indicative of lower-velocity bullets or bullet fragments. For example, a nick on the limousine&#x27;s chrome was not from a high-velocity bullet as such a bullet would have pierced the chrome, not merely dented it.

On May 24, the FBI and Secret Service reenacted the shooting in Dallas and the Commission tested its theory. Agents acting as the president and the governor sat in a car of approximately the same dimensions of the presidential limousine, which was unavailable for the re-creation. Adjustments to measurements were made to account for the differences in the vehicles. Positions were recreated by matching them to particular frames of the Zapruder film, calibrated with other films and photographs taken that day. With the agents in position, photographs were taken from the sniper&#x27;s nest of the Texas School Book Depository. 

It was from this re-creation, and the testimony of the agent in the sniper&#x27;s nest, that the Commission verified the theory to its satisfaction, as the governor was in a direct line to be struck by any bullet fired between frames 207 and 235 to 240 which exited the president&#x27;s throat. The agent testified that from frame 226 onward, the governor was &quot;too much towards the front&quot; and his wounds were therefore misaligned from that point. An oak tree partially obscured the line of sight until frame 210, so the Commission concluded that &quot;the President was not hit until at least frame 210 and that he was probably hit by frame 225&quot;.

Further evidence gathered suggested to the Commission that the initial April consensus that a separate bullet caused the governor&#x27;s wrist and thigh injuries was incorrect, as the Army Wound Ballistics experts concluded that those wounds were &quot;not caused by a pristine bullet,&quot; and therefore bullet CE 399 &quot;could have caused all his wounds&quot;. Other evidence, such as the nature of Connally&#x27;s back wound (see below), was also cited by the Commission as corroborating the theory.

The Commission did not conclude the single-bullet theory had been proven, as three members of the body, Representative Hale Boggs, Senators Richard Russell and John Cooper thought the theory improbable. Russell requested that his opposition to the theory be stated in a footnote in the report. In the end, the Commission changed the word &quot;compelling&quot; to &quot;persuasive&quot; and stated: &quot;Although it is not necessary to any essential findings of the Commission to determine just which shot hit Governor Connally, there is very persuasive evidence to indicate that the same bullet which pierced the President&#x27;s throat also caused Governor Connally&#x27;s wounds.&quot;

Nevertheless, all seven members of the Commission signed off on the statement: &quot;There was no question in the mind of any member of the Commission that all the shots which caused the President&#x27;s and Governor Connally&#x27;s wounds were fired from the sixth floor window of the Texas School Book Depository.&quot;

==Number and sequence of the shots==
Within minutes after the shots rang out in Dealey Plaza in downtown Dallas, Texas, at 12:30 p.m. on November 22, 1963, sources began reporting that three shots had been fired at the President&#x27;s motorcade. At 12:34 p.m., approximately four minutes after the shots were fired, the first wire story flashed around the world:

DALLAS NOV. 22 (UPI) -- THREE SHOTS WERE FIRED AT PRESIDENT KENNEDY&#x27;S MOTORCADE TODAY IN DOWNTOWN
DALLAS. JT1234PCS

This report had been transmitted by United Press International (UPI) reporter Merriman Smith from a radio telephone located in the front seat of the press car in the Presidential motorcade, six cars behind the President&#x27;s limousine. Smith&#x27;s communication with the Dallas UPI office was made less than a minute after the shots were heard, as his car entered the Stemmons freeway en route to Dallas&#x27; Parkland Hospital.

Merriman Smith&#x27;s dispatch was the first of many reports. Photographers Robert Jackson and Tom Dillard riding in a car in the motorcade heard three shots. &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot; reporter Mary Woodward described hearing three shots as she stood in front of the Texas School Book Depository.

There has been some controversy regarding the number of shots fired during the assassination. The Warren Commission concluded that three shots were fired. The vast majority of witnesses claim to have heard three, but there are some witnesses who could recall only one or two shots. A few witnesses thought there were four or more shots. Of 178 witnesses whose evidence was compiled by the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA), 132 reported hearing exactly three shots, 17 recalled hearing two, 7 said they heard two or three shots (total: 88%). A total of 6 people said they thought they heard four shots, and 9 said they were not sure how many shots they heard. Another 7 people said they thought they heard 1, 5, 6, or 8 shots.

Governor Connally, riding in the middle jump seat of the President&#x27;s limousine in front of the President, recalled hearing the first shot which he immediately recognized as a rifle shot. He said he immediately feared an assassination attempt and turned to his right to look back to see the President. He looked over his right shoulder but did not catch the President out of the corner of his eye so he said he began to turn back to look to his left when he felt a forceful impact to his back. He stated to the Warren Commission: &quot;I immediately, when I was hit, I said, &#x27;Oh, no, no, no.&#x27; And then I said, &#x27;My God, they are going to kill us all.&#x27;&quot; He looked down and saw that his chest was covered with blood and thought he had been fatally shot. Then he heard the third and final shot, which sprayed blood and brain tissue over them.

Nellie Connally said she heard the first shot and saw President Kennedy with his hands at his neck reacting to what she later realized was his neck wound. After the first shot, she heard her husband yell, &quot;Oh, no, no, no&quot; and turn to his right, away from her. Then she heard a second shot, which hit her husband. She saw him recoil away from her and saw that he was hit. She immediately reached over and pulled him toward her into her arms and lay backward. Then she heard the third and final shot. Mrs. Connally said she never looked into the back seat of the car after her husband was shot.

According to the single-bullet theory, one shot passed through President Kennedy&#x27;s neck and caused all of Governor Connally&#x27;s wounds (he was wounded in the chest, right wrist, and left thigh), and one of the shots must have missed the limousine entirely. The Connallys never accepted the theory. While they agreed with the Warren Commission&#x27;s conclusion that Oswald acted alone, they insisted that all three shots struck occupants of the limousine.

==Location of back wound==

President Kennedy&#x27;s death certificate places the bullet wound to Kennedy&#x27;s back at about the third thoracic vertebra. The death certificate was signed by Dr. George Burkley, the President&#x27;s personal physician. As interpreted by the House Select Committee on Assassinations Forensic Pathology Panel, the autopsy photos and autopsy X-rays show a bullet hole at the first thoracic vertebra. The bullet hole in the shirt worn by Kennedy and the bullet hole in the suit jacket worn by Kennedy both show bullet holes between below the top of Kennedy&#x27;s collar. 

These do not necessarily correspond with bullet wounds, since Kennedy was struck with his arm raised in the air, and multiple photos taken of the President during the motorcade show that his jacket was bunched in the rear below his collar. On February 19, 2007, the film shot by George Jefferies was released. This 8 mm film, which was taken approximately 90 seconds before the shooting, clearly shows that President Kennedy&#x27;s suit coat was bunched up around the neckline around the time of the assassination.

The theory of a &quot;single bullet&quot; places a bullet wound as shown in the autopsy photos and X-rays, at the first thoracic vertebra of the vertebral column. The official autopsy report on the President, Warren Exhibit CE 386, described the back wound as being oval-shaped, 6 x 4 mm, and located &quot;above the upper border of the scapula&quot; [shoulder blade] at a location from the tip of the right acromion process, and below the right mastoid process (the boney prominence behind the ear). The report reported contusion (bruise) of the apex (top tip) of the right lung in the region where it rises above the clavicle, and noted that although the apex of the right lung and the parietal pleural membrane over it had been bruised, they were not penetrated. The report noted that the thoracic cavity was not penetrated.

The concluding page of the Bethesda autopsy report states: &quot;The other missile [referring to the body-penetrating bullet] entered the right superior posterior thorax above the scapula, and traversed the soft tissues of the supra-scapular and the supra-clavicular portions of the base of the right side of the neck. This missile produced contusions of the right apical parietal pleura and of the apical portion of the right upper lobe of the lung. The missile contused the strap muscles of the right side of the neck, damaged the trachea, and made its exit through the anterior surface of the neck.&quot;

The conclusion of bullet entry specifically at the first thoracic vertebra was made in a 1979 report on the Kennedy assassination by the HSCA Forensic Pathology Panel, which created Figure [24] for their report to demonstrate this entrance location. This position is consistent with the back wound location in Figure 4 of their report, a drawing made from one of the still-unreleased autopsy photos. It is also consistent with the unofficial versions of this photo available on the internet. The HSCA examined these photographs and X-rays before rendering its opinions as to bullet entry and exit locations, and obtained testimony from autopsy physicians that these were the correct photographs and X-rays taken during the autopsy.

===Importance of bullet entry level to theory===

The importance of how low or high the bullet struck the President in the back is a matter of possible geometry. The Sibert/O&#x27;Neill FBI autopsy report original made by two FBI agents (Special Agents James W. Sibert and Francis X. O&#x27;Neill) present at the autopsy preserves genuine confusion among the medical doctors present during the autopsy, caused by apparent lack of an exit wound, which was cleared up later in the official report after new and more complete information became available (the exit had been hidden by a tracheotomy incision). This report does note that the doctor (Commander Humes) at the time said that he was unable to locate an &quot;outlet&quot; for the wound in Kennedy&#x27;s &quot;shoulder&quot; (not his back).

At the time of the autopsy, toward the end of the procedure, initial probing of the shoulder wound suggested the bullet entered the base of Kennedy&#x27;s neck at a 45 to 60 degree angle. At least two shell casings were found near the window at the southeast corner side of the TSBD on the sixth floor, and with the fact that movement was seen in the same corner window from bystanders below, just previous to when the cars arrived, and also because of the proximity of the initial investigations&#x27; shell casing evidence collected to that of the nearest window. 

A window that was said by some to have been partly opened at the moment of the shots, all leading the Warren Commission to focus solely on this location in their investigation as the source of gunfire and so decided to have a team of surveyors measure the angles from that said window to the locations of the street, which, would roughly correspond to the location of Kennedy seated in his limousine, when seen in the Zapruder Film, riding along Elm Street at frames 210, and 225. During so, it was found that the downward angle from the horizontal, was 21.57 degrees at frame 210, and 20.18 degrees at frame 225. 

The street sloped at 3.15 degrees (3° 9&#x27;) away from the depository building. This would have made the angle through the president between 17 and 18.5 degrees, assuming that Kennedy was sitting upright, in his seat. The Commission concluded that this angle was consistent with the bullet making the observed paths through the President&#x27;s upper body and striking Governor Connally in the right armpit.

The weight of bullet CE 399 was reported in the Warren Commission Report as 158.6 grains (10.28 grams). It was found that the weight of a single, unfired bullet ranged from 159.8 to 161.5 grains with an average weight of 160.844 grains. The lead fragments retrieved from Connally&#x27;s wounds in the wrist (there were no fragments in the chest) weighed about 2 grains (130 milligrams).

Dr. Robert Shaw described the wound on Connally&#x27;s back as &quot;a small wound of entrance, roughly elliptical in shape, and approximately a cm. and a half in its longest diameter, in the right posterior shoulder, which is medial to the fold of the axilla&quot;.

The bullet entered just at the edge of the scapula and followed the fifth rib, shattering the last 10 cm of the rib before exiting on the right side of his chest just below the right nipple. According to the theory, the bullet then went through the Governor&#x27;s jacket cuff about 0.5 cm from the end, the shirt&#x27;s French cuff about 1.5 cm from the end, struck and shattered his radius leaving many dark fibers and small fragments of metal in the wound, and exited on the palm side of his wrist above the cuff. There was a hole about 0.5 cm from the end of the jacket sleeve and a hole through the back of the doubled French cuff but no exit hole on the palm side.

According to the theory, the bullet emerged from the palm side of the wrist and entered the left thigh. This bullet is thought to be CE 399, which was later recovered from Parkland Hospital after it was heard falling onto a hallway floor as a hospital employee adjusted one of two patient stretchers, partially obstructing his maneuvers as he performed his routine. Using ballistics CE 399 was matched to the rifle found in the Texas School Book Depository, to the exclusion of all other rifles.

==Theorized path of the bullet CE 399==

The following description assumes that bullet CE 399 hit high, at the sixth cervical vertebra rather than the third thoracic vertebra: The 6.5 millimeter, 161 grain, round nose military style full metal jacket bullet, which was manufactured by the Western Cartridge Company and later stored nearly whole in the U.S. National Archives, was first theorized by the Warren Commission to have:

* ballistically arced very slightly while traveling in a downward net angle of 19 degrees (allowing for the 3 degrees downward slope of Elm Street), after an initial supersonic rifle exit muzzle velocity of , then entered President Kennedy&#x27;s rear suit coat at about ,
* impacted, then entered President Kennedy to the right of his spine, creating a wound documented size of 4 millimeters by 7 millimeters in the rear of his upper back with a red-brown to black area of skin surrounding the wound, forming what is called an abrasion collar. This abrasion collar was caused by the bullet&#x27;s scraping the margins of the skin on penetration and is characteristic of a gunshot wound of entrance. This abrasion collar was photographically documented to be larger at the lower margin half of the wound, which is strong evidence that the bullet&#x27;s long-axis orientation at the instant of penetration was slightly upward in relation to the plane of the skin immediately surrounding the wound; however, the skin of Kennedy&#x27;s upper back slopes inward, and the Croft photo (taken at Zapruder frame 162, shortly before Kennedy was hit) shows the President slumped forward. This would suggest that a shooting position above and to the rear of Kennedy was possible
* damaged the President&#x27;s first thoracic vertebra. (There is debate whether the bullet itself struck the vertebra and caused this damage, or whether a pressure cavity wave created by the bullet&#x27;s passage was responsible),
* passed through his neck. Warren Exhibit CE 386 reported contusion (bruise) of the apex of the right lung in the region where it rises above the clavicle, and noted that, although the apex of the right lung and the parietal pleural membrane over it had been bruised, they were not penetrated. This is consistent with a bullet passing through the neck, immediately over the top tip of the right lung (the pressure wave causing bruising to both pleural membrane and apex of lung), but without penetrating the thoracic cavity, or the lung beneath.
* after passing through the neck, exited President Kennedy&#x27;s throat, at the centerline below the President&#x27;s Adam&#x27;s apple. Within three hours of the assassination, this neck frontal wound was described in an afternoon press conference by the Parkland trauma room #1 emergency physician, Doctor Malcolm Perry, after he attended to the frontal throat wound, as being an &quot;entrance wound&quot;. Doctor Perry stated the neck frontal wound &quot;appeared to be&quot; an entrance wound three times during his press conference. However, medical researchers have found that ER doctors frequently make mistakes with regard to entrance and exit wounds, and both Perry and Dr. Carrico, the other attending ER doctor, later testified at the Warren hearing that with a full jacketed bullet the wound in the front of the throat could have been either an entrance or exit wound; the Parkland ER doctors also never examined the wound in the back and could make no comparisons with it. Within nineteen hours of his press conference statement (but after the autopsy had already been completed), Doctor Perry also described via telephone to Doctor Humes, one of the three U.S. Navy Bethesda Hospital military autopsists, that the neck front wound was originally only &quot;3 to 5 millimeters&quot; in circular width before doctor Perry attended to the front throat wound (Humes documented Perry&#x27;s &quot;3 to 5 millimeters&quot; wound size by writing it down during the phone conversation),
* passed through both sides of his shirt collar-front in alignment with the collar button buttoned, about below the center top collar button and collar button hole, in line with the throat wound, and with the threads in both bullet-slits forced outward, showing this to be an exit wound,
* nicked President Kennedy&#x27;s tie-knot on its upper left side. Upon clearing the tie-knot the bullet had slowed to about and had started to tumble,
* traveled the between President Kennedy and Governor Connally,
* impacted and entered Connally&#x27;s back just below and behind his right armpit creating an 8 millimeter by 15 millimeter elliptical wound, indicating that the bullet was fired from an acute angle to the entrance wound point, or that the bullet was tumbling, having hit something on its earlier way (presumably Kennedy); according to Connally, the impact of the bullet was very forceful. In terms of the physics of this impact, this means that the bullet imparted part of its momentum to Connally&#x27;s body and therefore the bullet&#x27;s momentum changed (in speed or direction or both) upon entering his body;
* completely destroyed of Connally&#x27;s fifth right rib bone as it smashed through his chest interior at a documented 10-degree anatomically downward angle (post-operative x-rays document that some of the metal fragments remained in Connally&#x27;s wrist for life and were buried with him many years later. There were no fragments seen in any chest x-rays),
* exited slightly below his right nipple, creating a 50 millimeter, sucking-air, blowout chest wound,
* passed through Connally&#x27;s shirt and suit coat front, exiting roughly central on the coat&#x27;s right side, just under the lowest point of the right lapel,
* slowed to (subsonic), and entered through Connally&#x27;s right upper (outside) wrist, but missed his suit coat sleeve. It penetrated the doubled French cuff shirt sleeve at the wrist area but did not penetrate the cuff on exit (in 2003 Nellie Connally described in her book &quot;From Love Field&quot; that Connally&#x27;s right hand solid-gold &quot;Mexican peso&quot; cufflink was struck with a bullet, and the cufflink was completely shot off during the attack. This is not evident from the physical appearance of the shirt which bears no mark, tear or hole at the cufflink area. Connally&#x27;s cufflink was apparently never found — thus never entered — into the assassination evidence),
* broken his right radius wrist bone at its widest point, depositing metal fragments (post-operative x-rays document that some of the metal fragments are still buried with him, as mentioned above),
* exited the palm (inner) side of Connally&#x27;s wrist,
* slowed to and entered the front side of his left thigh, creating a documented 10-millimeter nearly round wound,
* buried itself shallowly into Connally&#x27;s left thigh muscles,
* then fallen out at Parkland Hospital, perhaps when Connally was undressed,
* landed on Connally&#x27;s gurney,
* been discovered by hospital engineer Darrell C. Tomlinson after it rolled into view after Connally&#x27;s gurney was bumped.

Regarding the bullet that he remembered impacting his back, Connally stated, &quot;...the most curious discovery of all took place when they rolled me off the stretcher and onto the examining table. A metal object fell to the floor, with a click no louder than a wedding band. The nurse picked it up and slipped it into her pocket. It was the bullet from my body, the one that passed through my back, chest, and wrist, and worked itself loose from my thigh.&quot; Connally does not say how he determined this object to have been a bullet, rather than his missing gold cufflink.

The Warren Commission&#x27;s &quot;single bullet,&quot; according to all documentation:

* had no thread striations (fine lines etched onto a copper encased bullet tip and/or bullet side casing by clothing threads when the bullet first penetrates clothing threads),
* was marked with no blood,
* was marked with no human tissue,
* had no pieces of clothing attached,
* had lost 1.5% of its original average weight,
* had a composition that was consistent with the composition of the metal fragments recovered from Connally (see section on neutron activation analysis).

This &quot;single bullet,&quot; which was full metal jacketed and specifically designed to pass through the human body, was deformed and not in a pristine state as some detractors claim. Though a side view seems to show no visible damage, a view from the end of the bullet shows a significant flattening which occurred when, according to the theory, the bullet struck Connally&#x27;s wrist, butt end first. The metallurgical composition of the bullet fragments in the wrist was compared to the composition of the samples taken from the base of CE 399.

Several of the same type 6.5 millimeter test bullets were test-fired by the Warren Commission investigators. The test bullet that most matched the slight side flattening and nearly pristine, still rounded impact tip of CE 399 was a bullet that had only been fired into a long tube containing a thick layer of cotton. Later tests show that such bullets survive intact when fired into solid wood and multiple layers of skin and ballistic gel, as well.

CE 399 is stored out of the public&#x27;s view in the National Archives and Records Administration, though numerous pictures of the bullet are available on the NARA website.

Ballistics experts have performed test shots through animal flesh and bones with cloth covering. Under the assumption of an adjusted relative position of President Kennedy and Governor Connally within the car, some, but not all, of the Warren Commission ballistics experts considered it possible that the same bullet that passed through the President&#x27;s neck may have caused all of the governor&#x27;s wounds.

==ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Kennedy Assassination: Beyond Conspiracy&quot;==
In 1993 computer animator Dale Myers embarked on a 10-year project to completely render the events of November 22 in 3D computer animation. His results were shown as part of ABC&#x27;s documentary &quot;The Kennedy Assassination: Beyond Conspiracy&quot; in 2003, and won an Emmy award.

To render his animation, Myers took photographs, home footage, blueprints and plans, and attempted to use them to create an accurate computer reenactment of the assassination. His work was assessed by Z-Axis, who have been involved in producing computer-generated animations of events, processes and concepts for major litigation in the United States and Europe.

Their assessment concluded that Myers&#x27;s animation allowed the assassination sequence to be viewed &quot;from any point of view with absolute geometric integrity&quot; and that they &quot;believe that the thoroughness and detail incorporated into his work is well beyond that required to present a fair and accurate depiction&quot;.

Myers&#x27;s animation found that the bullet wounds were consistent with JFK&#x27;s and Governor Connally&#x27;s positions at the time of shooting, and that by following the bullet&#x27;s trajectory backwards it could be found to have originated from a narrow cone including only a few windows of the sixth floor of the School Book Depository, one of which was the sniper&#x27;s nest of boxes from which the rifle barrel had been seen protruding by witnesses.

In the same ABC documentary, Myers uses a close-up examination of the Zapruder film to justify the single-bullet theory and calls attention to frames 223 and 224 on the Zapruder film, where the right-side lapel of Governor Connally&#x27;s jacket appears to &quot;pop out,&quot; as if being pushed from within by an unseen force. Myers theorizes that this is the moment of impact, when both Kennedy and Connally were struck by the same bullet from Oswald&#x27;s rifle. Myers also argues that in frames 225–230 both Kennedy and Connally are simultaneously reacting to the impact of the bullet. There is no other point on the film which shows either Kennedy or Connally reacting because they have been shot. They both react at the same time, frame 225, because that is when the single bullet hits both of them.

If the bullet exited Connally&#x27;s chest below the nipple, the lapel would be too high to have popped out due to direct contact with the bullet. Surgeon John Lattimer has argued that the jacket bulged out because of the &quot;hail of rib fragments and soft tissue&quot; as the bullet tumbled in Connally&#x27;s body.

==Discovery Channel&#x27;s reenactment of bullet CE 399&#x27;s path==
In 2004, the Discovery Channel aired an episode of &quot;Unsolved History&quot; titled &quot;JFK — Beyond the Magic Bullet&quot;. Their re-enactment of the assassination using current forensics and materials found that a single bullet almost exactly duplicated the path of travel specified in the single-bullet theory.

==Neutron activation analysis of bullet fragments==
===Original bullet lead analysis by Vincent Guinn===
Warren Commission documents released after the publication of its report revealed that the FBI had arranged for bullet CE 399 and the various fragments found in the car and in Governor Connally&#x27;s wounds to be examined using neutron activation analysis (NAA). NAA is a precise, non-destructive method of determining the relative concentrations of trace elements in a sample of matter. The data from the tests performed for the FBI were inconclusive as to the origins of the fragments.

In 1978 the HSCA asked physicist Vincent P. Guinn to review the NAA data and conduct new tests. Guinn did so and presented his results and analysis to the Committee. Guinn stated that initially he agreed with the earlier conclusion. After examining the old and new NAA data further, he concluded that all the fragments probably came from two bullets, one of which was the whole bullet, CE 399.

Guinn compared antimony concentrations of Exhibits CE 840, 843 and 567 with that of Exhibits CE 399 and CE 842 and concluded that the data supported the single-bullet theory in that all the bullet lead in the car and wounds originated from no more than two bullets.

===Conclusions about the single-bullet theory from the NAA analysis===
Whether the NAA data can be used to actually exclude the possibility that there were fragments from more than two bullets in the wounds and the car has been the subject of controversy.

Ken Rahn of the University of Rhode Island, a chemist and meteorologist who has a long-standing interest in the Kennedy Assassination, maintains that the NAA data excludes a &quot;three bullet hit&quot; and proves the single-bullet theory actually occurred. His analysis was published in 2004 co-authored with Larry Sturdivan, a Warren Commission and HSCA ballistics expert.

Rahn/Sturdivan say that the possibility that the wrist fragment CE 842 (with an antimony concentration of 797±7 ppm) did not come from the base of the whole bullet CE 399 (the sample from which had an antimony concentration of 833±9 ppm) is so statistically improbable as to be excluded as a reasonable possibility.

Contradicting this conclusion, in an article published in July 2006 in the &quot;Journal of Forensic Sciences&quot; by Erik Randich and Patrick M Grant, the authors took a significantly different view of the NAA data and the metallurgical profile of the Carcano ammunition. The authors found errors in the analysis by Guinn:

Thus, elevated concentrations of antimony and copper at crystallographic grain boundaries, the widely varying sizes of grains in MC bullet lead, and the 5–60 mg bullet samples analyzed for assassination intelligence effectively resulted in operational sampling error for the analyses. This deficiency was not considered in the original data interpretation and resulted in an invalid conclusion in favor of the single-bullet theory of the assassination.

Randich and Grant concluded:

The end-result of these metallurgical considerations is that, from the antimony concentrations measured by VPG [Vincent P. Guinn] in the specimens from the JFK assassination, there is no justification for concluding that two, and &quot;only&quot; two, bullets were represented by the evidence.

The conclusion of Randich and Grant had been advanced earlier by Arthur Snyder of the Stanford Linear Accelerator Laboratory in a paper written in 2001.

In August 2006 Ken Rahn wrote a response critical of the Randich/Grant paper on his website claiming that Randich and Grant did not analyse the data correctly:

Both sections of the article failed to make their case. The metallurgical section contained a huge gap in its logic (proposing an explanation but failing to support it quantitatively), and predicted at least two features of the elemental data that were the opposite of that actually observed. The statistical section started well, but stumbled when it confused heterogeneity with analytical uncertainty and when it used confidence intervals instead of difference in means to assess the separation of the two groups of crime-scene fragments. Fixing these two errors gave the opposite result, i.e., confirmed that the groups were distinct.

Patrick Grant defended his and Erik Randich&#x27;s paper against Rahn&#x27;s critique in an article entitled &quot;Commentary on Dr. Ken Rahn&#x27;s Work on the JFK Assassination Investigation&quot; and posted it on the MaryFerrell.org website.

===Forensic use of compositional bullet lead analysis===
The technique used by Guinn to analyse the bullet lead from the JFK assassination was a form of what has become known as Compositional Bullet Lead Analysis (CBLA). Until 2004 the FBI used this technique to determine whether a crime scene bullet lead sample came from a particular box of ammunition or a particular batch of bullets. Guinn claimed that with the JFK bullet fragments, the technique could be used to identify the exact bullet the fragments came from.

The validity of CBLA was discredited in a 2002 paper (&quot;A Metallurgical Review of the Interpretation of Compositional Bullet Lead Analysis&quot; (2002), 127 Forensic Science International, 174–191) co-authored by Randich and by former FBI Chief Metallurgist, William Tobin.

The 2002 Tobin/Randich paper prompted the National Academy of Sciences (Board on Chemical Science and Technology) to review the science of bullet lead analysis. In a report in 2004 the NAS found the scientific basis for matching bullet sources from the analysis of bullet lead composition as practiced by the FBI was flawed. As a result of that report, courts appear to have stopped accepting this evidence and the FBI has stopped using bullet lead analysis for forensic purposes.

The NAS report on CBLA, and its relevance to the Guinn&#x27;s analysis of bullet lead in the JFK assassination, is the subject of comment by Randich and Grant in their 2006 paper at page 719.

==Criticisms of the single-bullet theory==

Critics of the single-bullet theory state that it is not possible that a single bullet could cause the number of wounds it did and still remain nearly intact. Some critics state that discrediting the theory would suggest the involvement of two shooters.

===Analysis based on Zapruder film and physical evidence===
Critics of the single-bullet thesis question not only the bullet&#x27;s trajectory and relative lack of damage, but also the question of timing of hits to both the president and Connally. A single bullet would have passed through both men in less than 1/100 of a second, which means that a strike of both men by a single bullet would have happened too quickly to be caught on more than a single Zapruder frame (these were exposed at 1/18th second intervals). From the Zapruder film one can see Kennedy with his hands in front of his chest near his throat as he emerges from behind the sign at Zapruder frame 225.

According to one popular version of the single-bullet theory (promoted by Gerald Posner in his book, &quot;Case Closed&quot;), the interval between frame 223 and 224 is the time the same projectile passes through both Kennedy and Connally&#x27;s body. It is not obvious at this point (frame 224) whether Connally has, or has not, been hit; however, Connally, but not other limousine occupants, is newly blurred in frame 224 but not in frame 223. Connally himself, in analyzing the frame-by-frame Zapruder film, identified his own hit later, at about Zapruder frame 230, whereas Kennedy is certainly hit about Zapruder frame 224, a third of a second earlier. Beginning immediately after frame 224, Connally rapidly raises and then lowers both arms, then turns to his right toward the Zapruder camera, but it is not clear that he is turning to see what has happened to Kennedy.

Connally&#x27;s cheeks then puff out, and his mouth opens. Many suggest that he is beginning to show the shock of the bullet. Others suggest that Connally is doing exactly what he said he did in reaction to hearing the first bullet: he said he realized an assassination was unfolding so he turned to see the President. It is at this point that some critics of the single-bullet theory believe Connally is actually hit by a second and separate bullet, and this is also what Connally himself believed, but only on the supposition that the first shot he heard was one that struck the president. (If the first shot missed the president, then Connally&#x27;s memory of being hit later corresponds with the single-bullet theory.) Proponents of the single-bullet thesis argue that Connally is simply exhibiting a delayed pain reaction to having been hit by the same bullet that hit Kennedy, a third of a second earlier.

Some critics believe the puffing out of Connally&#x27;s cheeks is simply physics at work, as the bullet collapses one of his lungs, forcing air into his mouth. Other critics believe that the puffing of Connally&#x27;s cheeks result from him shouting, &quot;Oh, no, no, no&quot;, which his wife, Nellie, said he shouted after the first shot but before the second shot. The premise that a collapsed lung would cause Connally&#x27;s cheeks to puff out is dismissed by Michael Baden, chief forensic pathologist for the HSCA. &quot;When the lung is punctured, as Connally&#x27;s was, the air in the lung goes out into the chest cavity, not out of the mouth, so Connally&#x27;s cheeks puffing out would have not been caused by air trying to escape.&quot;

When an enhanced copy of the Zapruder film was released in 1998, many felt the delayed reaction theory was debunked. Others, particularly Posner, noted that Connally&#x27;s right lapel flips up at frame 224 (it hides the right part of his white collar in frame 224, which is far more clearly seen in both frames 223 and 225). In this same frame, as noted above, Connally suddenly becomes blurred with regard to the rest of the automobile (Connally is clear in frame 223). Frame 224 is precisely the best-posited frame of the impact of the bullet to Kennedy, who is still behind the sign at this point. Zapruder himself does not appear to jump until frame 227, blurring all contents of the automobile.

Connally&#x27;s immediate reaction after frame 224, including a flinch in which he flexes both elbows and brings his hat up, is seen by some as an unconscious reaction to the strike (single frames of this reaction appear to show Connally unharmed, with hat held up in front of his chest, while Kennedy behind him has already clearly been hit). Others see this as Connally&#x27;s reaction to the sound of the first shot. Immediately after the arm spasm, Connally begins a motion which drops his right shoulder and holds his right arm pinned to his right side, including a slow rolling motion toward this side. He also is seen to look over his right shoulder at Kennedy and shows an expression of pain only after turning his head back toward Zapruder&#x27;s position around frame 275.

In the Oliver Stone movie &quot;JFK&quot;, Stone goes to great lengths to debunk the single-bullet theory, although some discrepancies exist between the narrative and the historical record. One example is when he shows Connally seated directly in front of Kennedy at the same height. In fact, Connally was seated in a jump seat the edge of which was inboard and possibly lower than Kennedy.

The House Select Committee concluded that Connally could have been as much as to the left of Kennedy. Moreover, Stone has Connally looking straight ahead. However, when Connally emerges from behind the freeway sign at Zapruder frames 222–223, he is clearly rotated significantly to his right. These points are of critical importance in assessing whether the bullet that passed through Kennedy could have caused Connally&#x27;s injuries. Computer recreations showing accurate body positioning of the two men show that their injuries, if caused at Zapruder frame 224, fall on a line which emanates from a circle enclosing several windows on the sixth floor of the Texas Book Depository, and includes the window of the sniper&#x27;s nest.

Connally continued to hold his hat after the single bullet struck and broke his right wrist. Critics contend this is not physically possible. However, in the Zapruder film Connally continues to clutch the hat even after Kennedy&#x27;s head wound, this being a point generally agreed to be after Connally had already been hit. In fact, Connally&#x27;s wife, Nellie Connally, stated that he held on to his hat until he was put on a stretcher at Parkland Hospital. Thus, it is reasonably clear that Connally continued to hold the hat after being hit. Wrist fracture would not preclude ability to hold a light object such as a hat, and Connally&#x27;s nerve damage was limited to a superficial branch of the radial nerve which served a sensory function only, and would not have interfered with his grip strength (nor was Connally&#x27;s hand function in any way permanently harmed).

===Right to left trajectory from 6th floor window===
A further criticism of the single-bullet theory has to do with the apparent trajectory of the &quot;single bullet&quot;. Perhaps the most outspoken critic of the single-bullet theory has been pathologist Dr. Cyril Wecht, who, as a member of the House Select Committee on Assassinations, wrote a dissenting opinion in which he explained why, in his view, the left-to-right trajectory from the sixth-floor window of the Texas School Book Depository through Kennedy&#x27;s neck could not possibly intersect with Connally&#x27;s right armpit. Wecht notes that in the photographs it appears that Connally is seated in the middle of the jump seat and Kennedy is to the right side of his seat with his right arm resting on the top of the limousine side.

According to the analysis done by the HSCA, the horizontal angle from the 6th floor window of the Texas School Book Depository to the limousine at frame 190 or so was about 13 degrees, right to left. The vertical angle was about 21 degrees downward from the horizontal plane and 18 degrees relative the car which was going down at 3 degree slope.

If Connally was seated in the middle of his seat, the bullet should have struck him to the left of his spine. The HSCA concluded that the thigh wound was made by a bullet travelling much slower than one would expect the bullet to have after exiting Kennedy&#x27;s neck. The single-bullet theory holds that the bullet which struck Connally&#x27;s thigh had also passed through his wrist, slowing it down in the process. Connally said that he never felt this thigh wound at any time until the next day. On the other hand, Dr. Shires, who operated on Connally&#x27;s thigh wound, thought that the wound to the thigh, which he said extended to the region of the femur, could have been made by a bullet travelling at high speed striking the thigh on an angle.

The HSCA concluded that Connally was not seated in the middle of his seat but was about to the left of that position. NASA Engineer Thomas Canning provided an analysis of the photograph taken by Hugh Betzner from the rear of the limousine a moment prior to the first shot. According to Betzner, he took the picture and began winding his camera to take another when the first shot sounded. It has been determined that Betzner&#x27;s photograph was simultaneous with Zapruder frame 186. 

Canning could not see Connally&#x27;s shoulder in Betzner&#x27;s photograph and concluded that this meant that the shoulder was obscured by the person standing in front of Betzner. This, he said, put the shoulder well to the left of Kennedy&#x27;s midline putting his right armpit in line with a right-to-left path through his neck. The analysis and conclusion of Canning depends on the correctness of the assumption that Connally&#x27;s shoulder would have been visible if the man in front of Betzner was not there. The photo taken by James Altgens from a similar angle earlier on Houston Street would seem to indicate that Connally&#x27;s shoulder was below the line of sight.

===Chain of evidence===
Some critics have questioned the circumstances surrounding the bullet&#x27;s discovery at Parkland Hospital. In a 1966 interview with author Josiah Thompson, one of the men who found the bullet, Parkland personnel director O.P. Wright, cast doubt on whether the bullet subsequently entered into evidence as CE 399 was the same bullet he held in his hand that day. Wright told Thompson that the bullet they found was point nosed, whereas CE 399 is round nosed. In 1964, both Wright and Darrel Tomlinson, a maintenance employee at Parkland who passed the bullet along to Wright, were shown the bullet and said the bullet in evidence appeared to be the same one as the bullet found on the stretcher, though neither could positively identify the bullet as the same one.

<text>Europa Universalis II is a grand strategy game developed by Paradox Development Studio and published by Strategy First, based on world history spanning a timeline between 1419 through 1820. It was released on December 11, 2001.

==Gameplay==
In the game, the player controls a single nation across five centuries, managing its economy, military, political alliances, scientific development, exploration and colonization, religious affairs, and internal stability. In addition, yearly random events, as well as hundreds of pre-scripted ones based on the historical record, make for a great deal of gameplay challenge and variety.

&quot;Europa Universalis II&quot; differs from many similar turn-based strategy games in that time flows continuously during gameplay, rather than taking place in discrete turns. The player is able to pause the action to ponder the situation and give orders, then speed up or slow down time to let events take their course.

The game ships with several historical scenarios, including games that take place during the Age of Exploration, the American Revolution, and the Napoleonic Wars. The Grand Campaign lets players choose one world power and guide it from the end of the Middle Ages and into the 19th century. There is also a Fantasy Scenario, starting in an unoccupied and unexplored earth with only 8 civilizations to choose. In this scenario, casual gameplay and strategy that should be applied are slightly different, more like a 4X game with a strong emphasis on colonization.

While the Grand Campaign is geared primarily towards the major European powers of the time, such as Austria, England, France, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Spain, Sweden, and Ottoman Empire, the game is unique in that players can choose to play as one of more than a hundred obscure, no longer existing nations, from the Indian subcontinent to the Balkans.

==Development==
The game, based on the Europa Engine, was developed by Paradox Interactive as a sequel to &quot;Europa Universalis&quot;, and was first released for the PC in 2001 by Strategy First, with a Macintosh port created by Virtual Programming and published by MacPlay. A Linux port was in development but was not released.

===Asia chapters===
A version of the game, called &quot;Europa Universalis II: Asia Chapters&quot;, was released for Asian markets, adding new graphics and scenarios that center around Asian history instead. It featured an updated map with greater detail and added provinces in Japan, Korea, and China.

==Reception==
&quot;Europa Universalis II&quot; was nominated for &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;″s 2002 &quot;Strategy Game of the Year&quot; award, which ultimately went to &quot;Freedom Force&quot;. &quot;Europa Universalis II&quot; received &quot;generally favourable&quot; reviews according to review aggregator Metacritic.

<text>Old Maid is a 19th-century American card game for two or more players, presumed to have derived from an ancient European gambling game in which the loser pays for the drinks.

== History ==
The rules of the game are first recorded in a book for girls by Eliza Leslie, who published them in America in 1831 and England in 1835 under the names Old Maid (when played by girls) or Old Bachelor (when played by boys). However, it may well be older and derived the German game of Black Peter, whose rules are recorded as early as 1821. Meanwhile the rules of the French game, Vieux Garçon, first appear in 1853. All these games are probably ancient and derived from simple gambling games in which the aim was to determine a loser who had to pay for the next round of drinks (c.f. drinking game). 

These games originally employed a pack of 32 or 52 French cards, the queen of diamonds or jack of spades typically being the odd card and the player who is last in and left holding a single queen or jack becoming the &quot;old maid&quot;, &quot;&quot;, or &quot;Black Peter&quot; depending on the game. The term &quot;old maid&quot; predates the game and referred to a childless or unmarried woman. In its day it was seen as the equivalent of &quot;old bachelor&quot;.

Apart from reprints of Leslie, the game largely disappeared from the literature during the mid-19th century but experienced something of a revival in the 1880s.. This was boosted in England when proprietary cards emerged with nursery rhyme figures in 1883 under the name Merry Matches which, according to &quot;Bazaar, Exchange and Mart&quot; was a &quot;newly invented game&quot;, despite its obvious derivation from Old Maid.

== Rules ==
=== Earliest rules (1831) ===
The following is a summary of the rules by Leslie (1831):

Old Maid is a girls&#x27; game and any number may play. Three queens are removed from a standard pack of 52 cards, leaving the fourth queen representing the &quot;Old Maid&quot;. Players may cut for deal, the one cutting the highest card dealing first. Aces are high. The cards are dealt equally all round and face down. The player to the left of the dealer begins by throwing down a pair of cards held in her hand e.g. two kings or two threes. The discards are placed face up in the middle of the table. If she is unable to discard a pair, she must draw a card from the player to her left who, for this purpose, lays her cards face down on the table. If the card drawn by the player whose turn it is pairs with one in her hand, she discards the pair; otherwise she keeps it and misses the opportunity to discard a pair. The turn then passes clockwise and players have the same options. The first player to shed all her cards wins the game. The rest continue to see who will be left with the Old Maid.

If the game is played by boys, it is called Old Bachelor and three knaves are discarded instead of three queens.

=== Modern rules (2011) ===
There are commercial card packs specifically designed for playing Old Maid, but the game can just as easily be played with a standard 52-card pack. The following rules are based on Arnold (2011), supplemented by other sources where indicated:

A standard pack is used (or two if more than six play) from which a single queen is removed. The cards are shuffled and all 51 are dealt out singly; it being irrelevant if some players have an extra card. Players discard any pairs dealt at the outset. If a triplet is held, two are discarded and one kept; if a quartet is held, two pairs are discarded. Play starts with the player to the dealer&#x27;s left offering a fan of face-down cards to the next player on the left. That player selects a card and discards it by pairing or adds it to the hand. Play continues clockwise in this manner, players dropping out when they have no hand cards left. The player left holding the single queen is the &#x27;old maid&#x27; and loses.

== Variations ==
* A specific card is removed, typically any Queen card, e.g. Queen of Hearts. 
* A joker is added to the pack. This card acts as the Old Maid.
* A card is removed from the pack at random. The resulting unmatchable card, the Old Maid, cannot be identified as easily.
* The suit colours of a discarded pair must match: with ; with .
* Players discard only after the dealer has taken a card.
* Players take a new card before giving one up. This can result in a player being stuck in &quot;old maid purgatory&quot;, i.e. with one card and no way to get rid of it.

=== Merry Matches ===
&quot;Merry Matches&quot;, a proprietary card game by Wyman &amp; Sons of London, appeared in 1883. It was originally published as a black-and-white game, but a coloured version appeared in 1884. There were 31 cards, the pairs &quot;to be wed&quot; including: Tommy Tucker and Goody Two-Shoes, Little Jack Horner and Miss Muffet, Father Christmas and Mrs Bond, Jack and Jill, Little Boy Blue and Little Bo Peep, the Prince and Cinderella, Dr Faustus and Dame Darden, The Man all tattered and torn and The Maiden all forlorn, Simple Simon and Lucy Locket, Father William and Old Mother Hubbard, Little Red Riding Hood and Tom, Tom, the Piper&#x27;s Son. The odd card was Mistress Mary. The aims were threefold: to wed as many couples as possible, to make a match between Father Christmas and Mrs Bond, and to avoid being left with Mistress Mary, the penalty for which was to give every other player 2 counters. The player who weds Father Christmas with Mrs Bond sweeps the pool and those making matches during the game receive &quot;wedding presents&quot; of 1 counter from each other player.

=== Scabby Queen ===
Scabby queen is a modern variation of Old Maid played with a standard pack of cards from which the Queen of Clubs has been removed. The player left with the &quot;scabby queen&quot; (Q) is the loser and receives a number of raps on the knuckles with the edge of the pack. The number of raps is decided by reshuffling the pack and getting the loser to draw a card. He or she get the number of raps based on the face value of the card or, if it is a jack or king, 10 raps; if it is a queen, 21 raps. If the loser draws a red card, he or she receives soft raps; if a black card, hard raps. Scabby Queen is recorded in 2002 as a game played in Perthshire, Scotland, but also known as Raps in Derbyshire, Raps or Chase the Bitch in Staffordshire, and Executioner in Hampshire. It some parts of Britain it is called Chase the Ace, but that is also the name of a different game.

=== Black Peter ===

The equivalent game in many European countries is known (in each country&#x27;s own language) as &quot;Peter&quot; or &quot;Black Peter&quot;, and is often played with special cards, typically 31 or 37, in which the odd one out is typically a chimney sweep or a black cat. The game can also be played with a standard 32-card pack from which a black jack is removed. The loser often gets a smudge on his or her face with a piece of soot or piece of burnt cork.

=== Regional variants===
* Trinidad: &quot;Jackass&quot;. The J is removed leaving the J as the odd card. The player left holding it is the &quot;jackass&quot;.
* Turkey: (&quot;Priest eloped&quot;). As Old Maid, but king is removed instead of queen or knave.

<text>East Java (, , , Pegon: جاوا وتان) is a province of Indonesia located in the easternmost third of Java island. It has a land border only with the province of Central Java to the west; the Java Sea and the Indian Ocean border its northern and southern coasts, respectively, while the narrow Bali Strait to the east separates Java from Bali by around . Located in eastern Java, the province also includes the island of Madura (which is connected to Java by the longest bridge in Indonesia, the Suramadu Bridge), as well as the Kangean islands and other smaller island groups located further east (in the northern Bali Sea) and the Masalembu archipelago to the north. Its capital is Surabaya, the second largest city in Indonesia, a major industrial center and also a major business center. Banyuwangi is the largest regency in East Java and the largest on the island of Java.

The province covers an area of , and according to the 2010 Census, there were 37,476,757 people residing there, making it Indonesia&#x27;s second-most-populous province; the 2020 Census showed an increase to 40,665,696 people, while the official estimate for mid 2023 was 41,527,930 (comprising 20,711,680 males and 20,816,260 females). Almost a quarter of the population lives inside greater Surabaya metropolitan area. East Java is inhabited by many different ethnic groups, such as the Javanese, Madurese and Chinese. Most of the people in East Java adheres to Islam, forming around 94% of the total population. Other religions are also practiced, such as Christianity, Buddhism and Confucianism which are mostly practised by Tionghoa people and immigrants from Eastern Indonesia and North Sumatra, and also Hinduism which are practised by the Tenggerese people in the Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park and the Balinese people inhabiting the easternmost part of the province bordering Bali as well as the dominant minority Indian Indonesians in Surabaya city.

The Indonesian language is the official language of the province as well as the whole nation, but Javanese and Madurese are most frequently used, especially the Surabaya dialect (Javanese: or — the Javanese dialect of Surabaya) used mainly in the capital Surabaya. Indonesian is only used for inter-ethnic communication and official purposes.

East Java offers different types of tourist attractions. There are a variety of natural attractions, including mountains, beaches, caves, and waterfalls. Almost every regency or city in East Java has its own unique tourist destinations, such as the Ijen volcano in Banyuwangi, Baluran National Park in Situbondo, and Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park in Malang, Pasuruan, Lumajang, and Probolinggo.

== History ==
=== Prehistory ===
East Java has been inhabited by humans since prehistoric times. This was proven by the discovery of fossils remains of the &quot;Pithecanthropus mojokertensis&quot; in Kepuhlagen, Mojokerto; &quot;Pithecanthropus erectus&quot; on Trinil, Ngawi; and &quot;Homo wajakensis&quot; in Wajak, Tulungagung.

=== Pre-Islamic era ===

The Dinoyo inscriptions found near the city of Malang are the oldest written sources in East Java, dating from 760 CE. It tells of many political and cultural events in the Kingdom of Kanjuruhan. The name Malang is thought to come from the name of a sacred building called Malangkuseswara. This name is contained in the Mantyasih inscription written in 907 CE.

In 1222, Ken Arok founded the Kingdom of Singhasari, which he ruled until 1292. Before coming to power, Ken Arok seized power in Tumapel (Kediri) from Tungul Ametung. Ken Arok&#x27;s descendants became kings of Singhasari and Majapahit from the 13th until the 15th century.

In 1227, Anusapati killed Ken Arok, and later became king of Singhasari. Anusapati&#x27;s power only lasted 20 years, before he was killed by Tohjaya. Three years later, Tohjaya was killed in an uprising led by Jaya Wisnuwardhana, son of Anusapati. In 1268, Wisnuwardhana died, and he was succeeded by Kertanegara (1268–1292). In 1292 Kertanegara was defeated by a rebel named Jayakatwang, ending the Singhasari.

In 1293, Kublai Khan, founder of the Yuan dynasty, sent a large invasion fleet to Java with 20,000 to 30,000 soldiers, beginning the Mongol invasion of Java. This was a punitive expedition against King Kertanegara of Singhasari, who had refused to pay tribute to the Yuan and maimed one of its ministers. However, it ended with failure for the Mongols.

In 1294, the Kingdom of Majapahit was founded by Raden Wijaya. The Majapahit reached its peak during the reign of Hayam Wuruk. He was accompanied by the &quot;Mahapatih&quot; Gajah Mada. Together they managed to unite the archipelago under the name Dwipantara. Majapahit developed to become one of the strongest empires in Southeast Asia.

In 1357, the Battle of Bubat occurred, starting a war between the Sunda Kingdom and the Majapahit. The event stemmed from the desire of king Hayam Wuruk to take a Sundanese princess. Dyah Pitaloka as queen. However, because of a misunderstanding about the procedure of marriage, leading to a battle in Bubat. Majapahit troops, under the command of Gajah Mada, captured and killed the present Members of the Royal Family of Pajajaran. In 1389, Hayam Wuruk died, and was succeeded by Wikramawardhana. This resulted in the beginning of the decline of the Majapahit Empire. As the Majapahit Empire went into decline in the late 1300s, Islam moved to fill the vacuum.

=== Islamic era ===


The precise date when Islam entered Java remains unclear. This is due to the absence of a definite source regarding the arrival of Islam in Java. However, according to some experts, it is estimated that Islam entered Java around the 11th century, with the tomb of Fatimah Binti Maimun in the village of Leran in Gresik Regency which dates from 475 AH (1085 AD). The tomb also shows that by the 11th century, the North coast of Java had been frequented by Arab traders from the Middle East. In addition, several Islamic tombs were discovered in Trowulan, located in what is now part of the Mojokerto Regency, near the site of the former Majapahit palace.

In the 15th century, a Chinese Hui voyager named Ma Huan visited East Java. He then wrote the book &quot;Yingya Shenglan&quot;, which tells the story of the countries he visited over the course of the Ming treasure voyages. He mentioned that at that time, there were three different peoples inhabiting Eastern Java: Arabs from the Middle East, the ancestor of the modern Arab Indonesians; Chinese Muslims originating from modern-day Guangdong province, and the native Javanese people.

By the 16th century, the Majapahit Empire was defeated by Islamic kingdoms in Java, resulting in the exile of many Majapahit aristocrats to the neighbouring island of Bali. Those who remained in Java were forced to convert to Islam, while a small pocket of isolated people living in the Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park spread around Pasuruan, Probolinggo, Malang, and Lumajang Regencies remains adhered to Hinduism to this day. They are known as the Tenggerese people. Their population of roughly 100,000 is centered in 30 villages in the isolated Tengger mountains.

When Islamic sultanates started ruling Java, cities in the northern coast started developing, becoming thriving ports. One of them was the town of Tuban, which was a wealthy and important port with many Chinese settlers. Being a port of the Majapahit and the point of departure for the Moluccas, it exported an abundant supply of foodstuffs and imported a rich variety of products from the Moluccas. At the end of the 16th century, Islam had surpassed Hinduism and Buddhism as the dominant religion in Java. At first, the spread of Islam was very rapid and was accepted by ordinary people, until the da&#x27;wah entered and it was carried out by the rulers of the island.

=== European colonization ===
The relationship between the Javanese and European colonial powers began in 1522, with the signing of a treaty between the Sunda Kingdom and the Portuguese Empire in Malacca. After the failure of the treaty, the Portuguese presence was then limited to Malacca in the Malay Peninsula and the Maluku Islands. An expedition under the leadership of the Dutch explorer Cornelis de Houtman consisting of four ships in 1596 became the beginning of Dutch presence in the island. At the end of the 18th century, the Dutch had succeeded in expanding their influence on the Islamic sultanates in the interior of the island of Java.

At the onset of the Napoleonic Wars, the British conquered Java in 1811. Java briefly became part of the British Empire, with Sir Stamford Raffles as its Governor-General. In 1814, Britain returned Java to the Netherlands as stipulated in the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814.

=== Japanese occupation and revolution ===

During the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies, there was persistent resistance against the Japanese rule. In Blitar, an uprising by &quot;Pembela Tanah Air&quot; (PETA) led by Supriyadi, Moeradi, Halir Mangkudijoyo, and Soemarto occurred in early 1945, but it was crushed by the Japanese.

Two weeks after the proclamation of independence, Surabaya established its own government under, Raden Sudirman. The formation of government in Surabaya caused disputes between the republican forces and Japanese troops, resulting in various skirmishes across the city. This was because when the Japanese surrendered, they were obliged to remain in power until the allied forces arrived. The arrival of allied forces in Surabaya created tensions with the newly established government of Indonesia, reaching peak on 10 November 1945 where a major battle between the Surabayan residents led by Sutomo and allied forces.

The battle forced the governor, Suryo, on the advice of People&#x27;s Security Army (TKR), to move the seat of the government to Mojokerto. A week later, the government retreated again to a more secure location in Kediri. However, security situation Kediri worsen until finally, in February 1947, the East Java provincial government fled to Malang. While the administration was based in Malang, Governor Soerjo was replaced by R.P. Suroso, who was in turn replaced again by Dr. Moerdjani. On 21 July 1947, although still bound by the Linggadjati Agreement, a ceasefire agreement in effect since 14 October 1946, the Dutch commenced a military action, Operation Product, which led to deteriorating security conditions in Malang. The East Java provincial government moved again to Blitar.

This military action ended after the Renville Agreement. However, this agreement reduced the territory controlled by the East Java provincial government. The Netherlands then turned the areas under its control into new federal states, the State of Madura and the State of East Java. Amid the difficulties faced by the government of Indonesia, a left-wing opposition group, &quot;Front Demokrasi Rakyat&quot; (FDR, People&#x27;s Democratic Front) launched rebellion in Madiun on 18 September 1948. However, eventually this revolt was defeated by the Indonesian Army. On 19 December 1948, the Dutch launched Operation Kraai. Blitar, the seat of the East Java provincial government was attacked by the Dutch. Governor Moerdjani and his staff were forced to flee and joined the guerrillas on the slopes of Mount Wilis. Operation Kraai ended after the Roem–Van Roijen Agreement on 7 May 1949.

Following the Dutch–Indonesian Round Table Conference, at which the Netherlands agreed to transfer sovereignty to the United States of Indonesia, the Dutch withdrew its troops from East Java. East Java changed its status from a province into a state. However, on 25 February 1950, this was dissolved and became part of the territory of the Republic of Indonesia. The State of Madura also decided to join Indonesia.

=== Contemporary era ===
Along with rapid growth of urbanization in East Java, the governments could not satisfy the population&#x27;s needs for affordable housing, which led to the building of shanty towns along the rivers and rail tracks. Today, the shanty towns still exist; although some have been transformed into &quot;better&quot; housing.

East Java has twice hosted the Indonesian National Games () (PON), the 7th (1969) and 15th PONs (2000), and became the overall champions in 2000 and 2008.

== Geography ==
East Java province borders the Java Sea in the north, the Strait of Bali in the east, and the Indian Ocean in the south, as well as the Central Java province in the west. The length of the east–west stretch of about 400 km. The width of the stretch of the north–south in the west about 200 km, but in the eastern part of narrower by about 60 km. Madura is the largest island in East Java, separated from the mainland Java by the Strait of Madura. Bawean Island is located about 150 km north of Java. In the east of Madura there are clusters of islands, the easternmost are the Kangean Islands and the northernmost are the Masalembu Islands. Off the south coast of Java there are two small islands namely Nusa Barong and Sempu Island.

=== Geology ===
In physiographic of geology, East Java Province can be grouped into three zones: the southern zone (plato), the middle zone (volcanic), and the northern zone (folds). Lowlands and highlands in the middle (of Ngawi, Blitar, Malang, to Bondowoso) has a fairly fertile soil. In the northern part ( Bojonegoro, Tuban, Gresik, to Madura Island) lies the Kapur Utara mountains and the Kendeng mountains which are relatively barren.

In the middle of the province stretch mountain ranges and volcanoes: On the border with Central Java is Mount Lawu (3,265 metres). Southeast from Madiun is Mount Wilis (2,169 metres), and Mount Liman (2,563 metres). In the middle of the corridor lies the Anjasmoro mountains with peaks Mount Arjuno (3,339 metres), Mount Welirang (3,156 metres), Mount Anjasmoro (2,277 metres), Mount Kawi (2,551 metres), and Mount Kelud (1,731 metres); The mountains are located in most Kediri, Blitar, Malang, Pasuruan, Mojokerto and Jombang. The group has the peak of Mount Bromo Tengger (2,329 metres), and Mount Semeru (3,676 metres). Mount Semeru, which is also called Mahameru is the highest mountain in the island of Java. In the easternmost part if the province, there are two groups of mountains: the Iyang mountains with the peak Mount Argopuro (3,088 metres), the Ijen mountains with the peak Mount Raung (3344 metres) In the south there is a series of hills, that of the south coast of Pacitan, Trenggalek, Tulungagung, Blitar, Malang. the Kapur Selatan mountains is a continuation of a series of the Sewu mountains in Yogyakarta.

=== Water ===
Two of the most important rivers in East Java are the Brantas River (290 kilometres), and the Solo River (548 kilometers). The Brantas River has headwaters on the slopes Mount Arjuno near Batu, and flows through most areas in East Java, like Malang, Blitar, Tulungagung, Kediri, Jombang and Mojokerto. In Mojokerto, the Brantas River split into two: Kali Mas, and Porong; both empty into the Madura Strait. The Solo River has headwaters on the slopes of Mount Lawu which lies on the border between East Java and Central Java, and flows through a portion of the eastern part of Central Java and East Java, which eventually empties into the sea at Gresik. The Brantas River and Bengawan Solo are managed by Perum Jasa Tirta I. On the slopes of Mount Lawu near the border with Central Java are Sarangan, a natural lake.

This division has remained unchanged since the creation of the province, except for the creation of the new city of Batu on 21 June 2001 (by separation from Malang Regency). These regencies and cities with their areas and populations at the 2000, 2010 and 2020 Censuses, together with the official estimates as at mid 2023, are listed below, grouped geographically into five (unofficial) sub-regions entirely for convenience of access. The sub-regions have no official status. These regencies and cities are divided as at 2023 into 666 districts (&quot;kecamatan&quot;) which are in turn composed of 8,494 administrative villages (rural &quot;desa&quot; and urban &quot;kelurahan&quot;):

Akin to Central Java, the region&#x27;s birth rates are not necessarily any lower than the rest of Java, however due to net population outflows, especially in times of calamity, not limited to volcanic eruptions or droughts, the region has varying rates of population growth that are generally lower than national average. Ethnic Javanese dominate the Java mainland as well as the total population of the province overall, while ethnic Madurese inhabit Madura and the Kangean and Masalembu archipelagos, though centuries of migrations have led the Java mainland to have a larger proportion of Madurese people than Madura itself. Minorities include distinct Javanese ethnicities such as the Tengger people in the Mount Bromo region, and the Samin and the Osing people in Banyuwangi. East Java also hosts a significant population of foreign ethnic groups, such as Chinese, Indians, and Arabs.

Javanese as spoken in the western part of East Java (&quot;Kulonan&quot;) is a similar dialect to the one spoken in Central Java, with its hierarchy of high, medium, and low registers. In the eastern part, such as Surabaya, Malang, and others, a more egalitarian version of Javanese is spoken, with less regard of hierarchy and a richer vocabulary for vulgarity. The dialect is notable for its roughness compared to other dialects spoken elsewhere in Java (especially the Mataram dialect spoken around Surakarta and Yogyakarta, which is renowned for its smoothness) and contributes to the stereotype among Javanese people of East Javanese being &quot;blunt&quot; and &quot;loud&quot;. Variants of Javanese are also used by Osing and Tengger minorities, the former utilizing a Balinese-influenced Javanese by virtue of its closeness with Bali island, and the latter speaking an archaic form of the language that retains many features now lost in other more-innovative Javanese dialects.
Other than Javanese, minority language includes Madurese, spoken by around 4 million ethnic Madurese people inhabiting the Madura Islands; though they live practically next door with the Javanese, the language is actually more closer genetically to Balinese, and Sundanese.

<text>Luis Walter Alvarez (June 13, 1911 – September 1, 1988) was an American experimental physicist, inventor, and professor who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1968 for his discovery of resonance states in particle physics using the hydrogen bubble chamber. In 2007 the &quot;American Journal of Physics&quot; commented, &quot;Luis Alvarez was one of the most brilliant and productive experimental physicists of the twentieth century.&quot;

After receiving his PhD from the University of Chicago in 1936, Alvarez went to work for Ernest Lawrence at the Radiation Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley. Alvarez devised a set of experiments to observe K-electron capture in radioactive nuclei, predicted by the beta decay theory but never before observed. He produced tritium using the cyclotron and measured its lifetime. In collaboration with Felix Bloch, he measured the magnetic moment of the neutron.

In 1940, Alvarez joined the MIT Radiation Laboratory, where he contributed to a number of World War II radar projects, from early improvements to Identification friend or foe (IFF) radar beacons, now called transponders, to a system known as VIXEN for preventing enemy submarines from realizing that they had been found by the new airborne microwave radars. The radar system for which Alvarez is best known and which has played a major role in aviation, most particularly in the post war Berlin airlift, was Ground Controlled Approach (GCA). Alvarez spent a few months at the University of Chicago working on nuclear reactors for Enrico Fermi before coming to Los Alamos to work for Robert Oppenheimer on the Manhattan project. Alvarez worked on the design of explosive lenses, and the development of exploding-bridgewire detonators. As a member of Project Alberta, he observed the Trinity nuclear test from a B-29 Superfortress, and later the bombing of Hiroshima from the B-29 &quot;The Great Artiste&quot;.

After the war Alvarez was involved in the design of a liquid hydrogen bubble chamber that allowed his team to take millions of photographs of particle interactions, develop complex computer systems to measure and analyze these interactions, and discover entire families of new particles and resonance states. This work resulted in his being awarded the Nobel Prize in 1968. He was involved in a project to x-ray the Egyptian pyramids to search for unknown chambers. With his son, geologist Walter Alvarez, he developed the Alvarez hypothesis which proposes that the extinction event that wiped out the non-avian dinosaurs was the result of an asteroid impact.

== Early life ==
Luis Walter Alvarez was born into a Roman Catholic family in San Francisco on June 13, 1911, the second child and oldest son of Walter C. Alvarez, a physician, and his wife Harriet née Smyth, and a grandson of Luis F. Álvarez, a Spanish physician, born in Asturias, Spain, who lived in Cuba for a while and finally settled in the United States, who found a better method for diagnosing macular leprosy. He had an older sister, Gladys, a younger brother, Bob, and a younger sister, Bernice. His aunt, Mabel Alvarez, was a California artist specializing in oil painting.

He attended Madison School in San Francisco from 1918 to 1924, and then San Francisco Polytechnic High School. In 1926, his father became a researcher at the Mayo Clinic, and the family moved to Rochester, Minnesota, where Alvarez attended Rochester High School. He had always expected to attend the University of California, Berkeley, but at the urging of his teachers at Rochester, he instead went to the University of Chicago, where he received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1932, his master&#x27;s degree in 1934, and his PhD in 1936. As an undergraduate, he belonged to the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity. As a postgraduate he moved to Gamma Alpha.

In 1932, as a graduate student at Chicago, he discovered the field of physics and had the rare opportunity to use the equipment of legendary physicist Albert A. Michelson. Alvarez also constructed an apparatus of Geiger counter tubes arranged as a cosmic ray telescope, and under the aegis of his faculty advisor Arthur Compton, conducted an experiment in Mexico City to measure the so-called East–West effect of cosmic rays. Observing more incoming radiation from the west, Alvarez concluded that primary cosmic rays were positively charged. Compton submitted the resulting paper to the &quot;Physical Review&quot;, with Alvarez&#x27;s name at the top.

Alvarez was an agnostic even though his father had been a deacon in a Congregational church.

== Early work ==

Alvarez&#x27;s sister, Gladys, worked for Berkeley physicist Ernest Lawrence as a part-time secretary, and mentioned Alvarez to Lawrence. Lawrence then invited Alvarez to tour the Century of Progress exhibition in Chicago with him. After he completed his oral exams in 1936, Alvarez, now engaged to be married to Geraldine Smithwick, asked his sister to see if Lawrence had any jobs available at the Radiation Laboratory. A telegram soon arrived from Gladys with a job offer from Lawrence. This started a long association with the University of California, Berkeley. Alvarez and Smithwick were married in one of the chapels at the University of Chicago and then headed for California. They had two children, Walter and Jean. They were divorced in 1957. On December 28, 1958, he married Janet L. Landis, and had two more children, Donald and Helen.

At the Radiation Laboratory he worked with Lawrence&#x27;s experimental team, which was supported by a group of theoretical physicists headed by Robert Oppenheimer. Alvarez devised a set of experiments to observe K-electron capture in radioactive nuclei, predicted by the beta decay theory but never observed. Using magnets to sweep aside the positrons and electrons emanating from his radioactive sources, he designed a special purpose Geiger counter to detect only the &quot;soft&quot; X-rays coming from K capture. He published his results in the &quot;Physical Review&quot; in 1937.

When deuterium (hydrogen-2) is bombarded with deuterium, the fusion reaction yields either tritium (hydrogen-3) plus a proton or helium-3 plus a neutron (). This is one of the most basic fusion reactions, and the foundation of the thermonuclear weapon and the current research on controlled nuclear fusion. At that time the stability of these two reaction products was unknown, but based on existing theories Hans Bethe thought that tritium would be stable and helium-3 unstable. Alvarez proved the reverse by using his knowledge of the details of the 60-inch cyclotron operation. He tuned the machine to accelerate doubly ionized helium-3 nuclei and was able to get a beam of accelerated ions, thus using the cyclotron as a kind of super mass spectrometer. As the accelerated helium came from deep gas wells where it had been for millions of years, the helium-3 component had to be stable. Afterwards Alvarez produced the radioactive tritium using the cyclotron and the reaction and measured its lifetime.

In 1938, again using his knowledge of the cyclotron and inventing what are now known as time-of-flight techniques, Alvarez created a mono-energetic beam of thermal neutrons. With this he began a long series of experiments, collaborating with Felix Bloch, to measure the magnetic moment of the neutron. Their result of , published in 1940, was a major advance over earlier work.

== World War II ==

=== Radiation Laboratory ===
The British Tizard Mission to the United States in 1940 demonstrated to leading American scientists the successful application of the cavity magnetron to produce short wavelength pulsed radar. The National Defense Research Committee, established only months earlier by President Franklin Roosevelt, created a central national laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) for the purpose of developing military applications of microwave radar. Lawrence immediately recruited his best &quot;cyclotroneers&quot;, among them Alvarez, who joined this new laboratory, known as the Radiation Laboratory, on November 11, 1940. Alvarez contributed to a number of radar projects, from early improvements to Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) radar beacons, now called transponders, to a system known as VIXEN for preventing enemy submarines from realizing that they had been found by the new airborne microwave radars. Enemy submarines would wait until the radar signal was getting strong and then submerge, escaping attack. But VIXEN transmitted a radar signal whose strength was the cube of the distance to the submarine so that as they approached the sub, the signal—as measured by the sub—got progressively weaker, and the sub assumed the plane was getting farther away and did not submerge.

One of the first projects was to build equipment to transition from the British long-wave radar to the new microwave centimeter-band radar made possible by the cavity magnetron. In working on the Microwave Early Warning system (MEW), Alvarez invented a linear dipole array antenna that not only suppressed the unwanted side lobes of the radiation field but also could be electronically scanned without the need for mechanical scanning. This was the first microwave phased-array antenna, and Alvarez used it not only in MEW but in two additional radar systems. The antenna enabled the Eagle precision bombing radar to support precision bombing in bad weather or through clouds. It was completed rather late in the war; although a number of B-29s were equipped with Eagle and it worked well, it came too late to make much difference.
The radar system for which Alvarez is best known and which has played a major role in aviation, most particularly in the post-war Berlin airlift, was Ground Controlled Approach (GCA). Using Alvarez&#x27;s dipole antenna to achieve a very high angular resolution, GCA allows ground-based radar operators to watch special precision displays to guide a landing airplane to the runway by transmitting verbal commands to the pilot. The system was simple, direct, and worked well, even with previously untrained pilots. It was so successful that the military continued to use it for many years after the war, and it was still in use in some countries in the 1980s. Alvarez was awarded the National Aeronautic Association&#x27;s Collier Trophy in 1945 &quot;for his conspicuous and outstanding initiative in the concept and development of the Ground Control Approach system for safe landing of aircraft under all weather and traffic conditions&quot;.

Alvarez spent the summer of 1943 in England testing GCA, landing planes returning from battle in bad weather, and also training the British in the use of the system. While there he encountered the young Arthur C. Clarke, who was an RAF radar technician. Clarke subsequently used his experiences at the radar research station as the basis for his novel &quot;Glide Path&quot;, which contains a thinly disguised version of Alvarez. Clarke and Alvarez developed a long-term friendship.

=== Manhattan Project ===

In the fall of 1943, Alvarez returned to the United States with an offer from Robert Oppenheimer to work at Los Alamos on the Manhattan Project. However, Oppenheimer suggested that he first spend a few months at the University of Chicago working with Enrico Fermi before coming to Los Alamos. During these months, General Leslie Groves asked Alvarez to think of a way that the US could find out if the Germans were operating any nuclear reactors, and, if so, where they were. Alvarez suggested that an airplane could carry a system to detect the radioactive gases that a reactor produces, particularly xenon-133. The equipment did fly over Germany, but detected no radioactive xenon because the Germans had not built a reactor capable of a chain reaction. This was the first idea of monitoring fission products for intelligence gathering. It would become extremely important after the war.
As a result of his radar work and the few months spent with Fermi, Alvarez arrived at Los Alamos in the spring of 1944, later than many of his contemporaries. The work on the &quot;Little Boy&quot; (a uranium bomb) was far along so Alvarez became involved in the design of the &quot;Fat Man&quot; (a plutonium bomb). The technique used for uranium, that of forcing the two sub-critical masses together using a type of gun, would not work with plutonium because the high level of background spontaneous neutrons would cause fissions as soon as the two parts approached each other, so heat and expansion would force the system apart before much energy has been released. It was decided to use a nearly critical sphere of plutonium and compress it quickly by explosives into a much smaller and denser core, a technical challenge at the time.

To create the symmetrical implosion required to compress the plutonium core to the required density, thirty-two explosive charges were to be simultaneously detonated around the spherical core. Using conventional explosive techniques with blasting caps, progress towards achieving simultaneity to within a small fraction of a microsecond was discouraging. Alvarez directed his graduate student, Lawrence H. Johnston, to use a large capacitor to deliver a high voltage charge directly to each explosive lens, replacing blasting caps with exploding-bridgewire detonators. The exploding wire detonated the thirty-two charges to within a few tenths of a microsecond. The invention was critical to the success of the implosion-type nuclear weapon. He also supervised the RaLa Experiments. Alvarez later wrote that:


Again working with Johnston, Alvarez&#x27;s last task for the Manhattan Project was to develop a set of calibrated microphone/transmitters to be parachuted from an aircraft to measure the strength of the blast wave from the atomic explosion, so as to allow the scientists to calculate the bomb&#x27;s energy. After being commissioned as a lieutenant colonel in the United States Army, he observed the Trinity nuclear test from a B-29 Superfortress that also carried fellow Project Alberta members Harold Agnew and Deak Parsons (who were respectively commissioned at the rank of captain).

Flying in the B-29 Superfortress &quot;The Great Artiste&quot; in formation with the &quot;Enola Gay&quot;, Alvarez and Johnston measured the blast effect of the Little Boy bomb which was dropped on Hiroshima. A few days later, again flying in &quot;The Great Artiste&quot;, Johnston used the same equipment to measure the strength of the Nagasaki explosion.

== Bubble chamber ==
Returning to the University of California, Berkeley as a full professor, Alvarez had many ideas about how to use his wartime radar knowledge to improve particle accelerators. Though some of these were to bear fruit, the &quot;big idea&quot; of this time would come from Edwin McMillan with his concept of phase stability which led to the synchrocyclotron. Refining and extending this concept, the Lawrence team would build the world&#x27;s then-largest proton accelerator, the Bevatron, which began operating in 1954. Though the Bevatron could produce copious amounts of interesting particles, particularly in secondary collisions, these complex interactions were hard to detect and analyze at the time.

Seizing upon a new development to visualize particle tracks, created by Donald Glaser and known as a bubble chamber, Alvarez realized the device was just what was needed, if only it could be made to function with liquid hydrogen. Hydrogen nuclei, which are protons, made the simplest and most desirable target for interactions with the particles produced by the Bevatron. He began a development program to build a series of small chambers, and championed the device to Ernest Lawrence.

The Glaser device was a small glass cylinder () filled with ether. By suddenly reducing the pressure in the device, the liquid could be placed into a temporary superheated state, which would boil along the disturbed track of a particle passing through. Glaser was able to maintain the superheated state for a few seconds before spontaneous boiling took place. The Alvarez team built chambers of 1.5 in, 2.5 in, 4 in, 10 in, and 15 in using liquid hydrogen, and constructed of metal with glass windows, so that the tracks could be photographed. The chamber could be cycled in synchronization with the accelerator beam, a picture could be taken, and the chamber recompressed in time for the next beam cycle.

This program built a liquid hydrogen bubble chamber almost long, employed dozens of physicists and graduate students together with hundreds of engineers and technicians, took millions of photographs of particle interactions, developed computer systems to measure and analyze the interactions, and discovered families of new particles and resonance states. This work resulted in the Nobel Prize in Physics for Alvarez in 1968, &quot;For his decisive contributions to elementary particle physics, in particular the discovery of a large number of resonant states, made possible through his development of the technique of using hydrogen bubble chambers and data analysis.&quot;

== Scientific detective work ==
In 1964, Alvarez proposed what became known as the High Altitude Particle Physics Experiment (HAPPE), originally conceived as a large superconducting magnet carried to high altitude by a balloon in order to study extremely high-energy particle interactions. In time the focus of the experiment changed toward the study of cosmology and the role of both particles and radiation in the early universe. This work was a large effort, carrying detectors aloft with high-altitude balloon flights and high-flying U-2 aircraft, and an early precursor of the COBE satellite-born experiments on the cosmic background radiation (which resulted in the award of the 2006 Nobel Prize, shared by George Smoot and John Mather).

Alvarez proposed muon tomography in 1965 to search the Egyptian pyramids for unknown chambers. Using naturally occurring cosmic rays, his plan was to place spark chambers, standard equipment in the high-energy particle physics of this time, beneath the Pyramid of Khafre in a known chamber. By measuring the counting rate of the cosmic rays in different directions the detector would reveal the existence of any void in the overlaying rock structure.

Alvarez assembled a team of physicists and archeologists from the United States and Egypt, the recording equipment was constructed and the experiment carried out, though it was interrupted by the 1967 Six-Day War. Restarted after the war, the effort continued, recording and analyzing the penetrating cosmic rays until 1969, when he reported to the American Physical Society that no chambers had been found in the 19% of the pyramid surveyed.

In November 1966, &quot;Life&quot; magazine published a series of photographs from the 1963 &quot;Zapruder film&quot;, believed to be the most complete document of the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Alvarez, an expert in optics and photoanalysis, became intrigued by the pictures and began to study what could be learned from the film. Alvarez demonstrated both in theory and experiment that the backward snap of the President&#x27;s head was consistent with his being shot from behind being called the &quot;jet-effect&quot; theory. Alvarez&#x27;s theory was later refined and corroborated by other researchers. Alvarez also investigated the timing of the gunshots and the shockwave that disturbed the camera, and the speed of the camera, pointing out a number of details that the FBI photo analysts either overlooked or got wrong. He produced a paper intended as a tutorial, with informal advice for the physicist intent on arriving at the truth of the case.

== Dinosaur extinction hypothesis ==


In 1980 Alvarez and his son, geologist Walter Alvarez, along with nuclear chemists Frank Asaro and Helen Michel, &quot;uncovered a calamity that literally shook the Earth and is one of the great discoveries about Earth&#x27;s history&quot;.

During the 1970s, Walter Alvarez was doing geologic research in central Italy. There he had located an outcrop on the walls of a gorge whose limestone layers included strata both above and below the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary. Exactly at the boundary is a thin layer of clay. Walter told his father that the layer marked where the dinosaurs and much else became extinct and that nobody knew why, or what the clay was about—it was a big mystery, and he intended to solve it.

Alvarez had access to the nuclear chemists at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory and was able to work with Frank Asaro and Helen Michel, who used the technique of neutron activation analysis to study the clay. In 1980, Alvarez, Alvarez, Asaro, and Michel published a seminal paper proposing an extraterrestrial cause for the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction (then called the Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction). In the years following the publication of their article, the clay was also found to contain soot, glassy spherules, shocked quartz crystals, microscopic diamonds, and rare minerals formed only under conditions of great temperature and pressure.

Publication of the 1980 paper brought criticism from the geologic community, and an often acrimonious scientific debate ensued. Ten years later, after Alvarez&#x27;s death, evidence was found of a large impact crater off the coast of the Yucatán peninsula in Mexico, providing support for the theory. Other researchers later found that the end-Cretaceous extinction of the dinosaurs may have occurred rapidly in geologic terms, over thousands of years, rather than millions of years as had previously been supposed. While alternative extinction theories have been proposed, including increased volcanism at the Deccan Traps, the impact crater theory remains dominant among relevant scholars.

== Aviation ==
In his autobiography, Alvarez said, &quot;I think of myself as having had two separate careers, one in science and one in aviation. I&#x27;ve found the two almost equally rewarding.&quot; An important contributor to this was his enjoyment of flying. He learned to fly in 1933, later earning instrument and multi-engine ratings. Over the next 50 years he accumulated over 1000 hours of flight time, most of it as pilot in command. He said, &quot;I found few activities as satisfying as being pilot in command with responsibility for my passengers&#x27; lives.&quot;

Alvarez made numerous professional contributions to aviation. During World War II he led the development of multiple aviation-related technologies. Several of his projects are described above, including Ground Controlled Approach (GCA) for which he was awarded the Collier Trophy in 1945. He also held the basic patent for the radar transponder, for which he assigned rights to the U.S. government for $1.

Later in his career Alvarez served on multiple high level advisory committees related to civilian and military aviation. These included a Federal Aviation Administration task group on future air navigation and air traffic control systems, the President&#x27;s Science Advisory Committee Military Aircraft Panel, and a committee studying how the scientific community could help improve the United States&#x27; capabilities for fighting a nonnuclear war.

Alvarez&#x27;s aviation responsibilities led to many adventures. For example, while working on GCA he became the first civilian to fly a low approach with his view outside the cockpit obstructed. He also flew many military aircraft from the co-pilot&#x27;s seat, including a B-29 Superfortress and a Lockheed F-104 Starfighter. In addition, he survived a crash during World War II as a passenger in a Miles Master.

==Other activities==
Alvarez was a member of the JASON Defense Advisory Group and the Bohemian Club.

== Death ==
Alvarez died on September 1, 1988, of complications from a succession of recent operations for esophageal cancer. His remains were cremated, and his ashes were scattered over Monterey Bay. His papers are in The Bancroft Library at the University of California, Berkeley.

==In popular culture==

A thinly-disguised version of Alvarez appears in Sir Arthur C. Clarke&#x27;s 1963 novel &quot;Glide Path&quot;.

In the 2023 film &quot;Oppenheimer&quot;, directed by Christopher Nolan, Alvarez was portrayed by actor Alex Wolff.

<doc id="320447" wikidata="Q120319" url="?curid=320447" title="Mallet locomotive">
<text>A Mallet locomotive is a type of compound articulated steam locomotive, invented by the Swiss engineer Anatole Mallet (1837–1919).

The front of the locomotive is articulated on a bogie. The compound steam system fed steam at boiler pressure to high-pressure cylinders driving the rear set of driving wheels (rigidly connected to the boiler). The exhaust steam from these cylinders was fed into a low-pressure receiver and was then sent to low-pressure cylinders that powered the driving wheels on the swiveling bogie towards the front of locomotive.

==Compounding==

Steam under pressure is converted into mechanical energy more efficiently if it is used in a compound engine; in such an engine steam from a boiler is used in high-pressure (HP) cylinders and then under reduced pressure in a second set of cylinders. The lower-pressure steam occupies a larger volume and the low-pressure (LP) cylinders are larger than the high-pressure cylinders.

A third stage (triple expansion) may be employed. Compounding was proposed by the British engineer Jonathan Hornblower in 1781.

The American engineer W. S. Hudson patented a system of compounding for railway locomotives in 1873 in which he proposed an intermediate receiver surrounded by hot gas from the fire, so that the low-pressure steam is partly superheated.

Mallet proposed cross-compounding in which a conventional steam locomotive configuration would have one high-pressure cylinder and one low-pressure cylinder. He patented the system in 1874, and in 1876 the first locomotive to the patent was built, an for the Bayonne and Biarritz Railway. Several others followed for railways in mainland Europe.

The London and North Western Railway locomotive engineer F W Webb adopted the idea and converted some existing locomotives in 1879, followed by de Glehn and others in the 1880s and several American engineers in the 1890s which included some vertical boiler railcar applications.

==Articulation==

Mallet found typical main line railways were unwilling to adopt his ideas. In 1884, he proposed compounding combined with articulation; on lightly engineered secondary lines this could give greater power to locomotives whose axle load and size were limited. His patent 162876 in France specified four cylinders, two large and two small, with one pair of cylinders acting on two or three fixed axles, and the other pair acting on axles mounted in a swivelling truck.

The weight of the front part of the boiler was to be supported on an arc-shaped radial bearing. The truck could therefore turn into a curve and move to some extent laterally. Typically the support bearing was placed beneath the smokebox, hollowed and with a sliding seal to provide a route for exhaust steam from the low-pressure cylinders to discharge through a blastpipe within the smoke box.

Mallet considered that the major advantage of this arrangement was that it enabled the cylinders on the truck to be fed with low-pressure steam: the high-pressure cylinders were on the fixed main frame and only low-pressure steam needed to be carried through movable pipes to the swivelling truck.

==The Mallet concept==
This came to be understood as a &quot;Mallet&quot; locomotive: an articulated locomotive in which the rear set of driving wheels were fixed in the main frame of the locomotive; an articulated truck carrying a second set of driving wheels; and compounding in which the high-pressure cylinders drove the axles on the main frame and the articulated axles were driven by low-pressure steam.

Mallet asserted that the advantages of his concept were:
* all the locomotive weight would be adhesive, yet there would be great flexibility of the locomotive as a vehicle;
* the difficulties with Meyer, Fairlie and other then-existing articulated systems would be eliminated as the moving pipes would be carrying low-pressure steam at only pressure, and would be easier to keep steam-tight; and
* A simple type of very powerful locomotive would be created.

The large-diameter pipe conveying the low-pressure steam from the high-pressure to the low-pressure cylinders acted also as a receiver, forming a buffer for the gas flow.

Independent cut-offs for the high-pressure and low-pressure cylinders were advocated by Mallet, but driving standards were inadequate and he later used combined cut-off control.

==European versions==

Large numbers of Mallet designs for narrow-gauge railways were built, but in 1889 the first six standard gauge examples were built by J A Maffei for the Swiss Central railways, and an banker (US: pusher) for the Gotthard Bahn, the last being the most powerful and heaviest locomotive in the world at the time. By 1892 110 Mallets were at work, of which 24 were standard gauge; by 1900 there were nearly 400, of which 218 were on standard gauge or Russian gauge ().

One of the examples in Germany was the class of s built by Maffei for Bavarian State Railways between 1913 and 1923. Mallet designs were popular in Hungary as well; 30 of were built between 1898 and 1902 (the last one served until 1958). was a (1B)B locomotive in service between 1905–1969 and until 1962. The strongest Mallet locomotives in Europe were the members of the MÁV 601 which were built for the Hungarian State Railways, a locomotive. With their length, weight and power output, the MÁV 601 was the longest, heaviest and most powerful steam locomotive built before and during World War I in Europe.

==North American versions==

The first Mallet locomotive in the United States was Baltimore and Ohio Railroad number 2400, built by Alco in 1904. Nicknamed &quot;Old Maude&quot;, it was an weighing and with axle loads of . Received negatively at first due to speed limitation arising from the short wheelbase and stiff suspension, it gained support during service, and it was soon followed by Baldwin examples, and then steadily heavier and more powerful successors.

In Canada, the Canadian Pacific Railway experimented with an unusual design of Mallet promoted by H.H. Vaughan, then Chief Mechanical Officer and Assistant to the CPR Vice-president. Their in-house compound design located both the high and low pressure cylinders adjacent to one another in the center of the locomotive driving opposite directions. Produced in the CPR&#x27;s Angus shops, road numbers 1950 to 1954 were outshopped between 1909 and 1911. An additional &quot;simple&quot; (as opposed to compound) unit with road #1955 featuring the same arrangement was also produced. These were used in helper service in the Rockies and Selkirks. The units were unpopular with crews owing to frequent steam leakages and derailments resulting from the lack of pilot wheels. While not an outright failure these were considered an unsuccessful design, and by 1916-1917 these units had been converted to a conventional 2-10-0 arrangement. These six locomotives were ultimately the only articulated locomotives operated by a Canadian railway.

As weight and power and length increased, there were experiments with flexible boiler casings; from 1910 the Santa Fe road introduced jointed-boiler locomotives weighing , with a long boiler barrel, with a firetube reheater and a firetube feedwater section in front, each separated by a blank section, and variants of a telescopic or bellows type boiler casing. These were unsuccessful, and later engines used conventional boilers.

The largest compound Mallets were ten s built for the Virginian by Alco in 1918; in pairs they pushed coal trains headed by a . The AT&amp;SF also had a number of compound s, assembled in their own shops from existing s using a kit, supplied by Baldwin, consisting of the front 10-wheel frame and a boiler extension.

Although compounds had been considered obsolescent since the 1920s, C&amp;O thought them appropriate, in the late 1940s, for low-speed coal-mine pickup runs converging on the classification yard at Russell, Kentucky. Only ten (of 25 originally ordered) were built before the order was cancelled, the last delivered in September 1949. The final loco, Chesapeake and Ohio 1309, is preserved on the Western Maryland Scenic Railroad. The 1309 was also the last steam locomotive that Baldwin built for the North American market.

The last compound Mallets to remain in use on a major North American railroad were the N&amp;W class Y6b locomotives, retired in July 1959. Norfolk &amp; Western 2156 is the sole surviving Y6a, preserved at the National Museum of Transportation in St. Louis.

===Simple expansion versions in the US===

By about 1920, the U.S. version of the Mallet as a huge slow-speed pusher had reached a plateau; the size of the low-pressure cylinders became a limiting factor even on the large loading gauge permitted in the U.S., and reciprocating masses posed serious dynamic problems above walking pace. Moreover, there were adhesion stability problems where the front engine tended to slip and then stall uncontrollably because of an imbalance of tractive effort and axle load, accentuated by the drawbar reaction, and inability of the intermediate steam receiver to accommodate the sudden pressure change. This was further worsened by dynamic instability of the front end in running.

The Chesapeake and Ohio Railway introduced 25 simple (non-compound expansion) locomotives in 1924 and 20 more in 1926. Although the simple-expansion concept diverged from Mallet&#x27;s original patent, the locomotives were clearly a continuation of the concept and were still referred to as &quot;Mallet&quot; locomotives. As the front truck cylinders were now using boiler pressure steam, special arrangements were necessary to deliver it, through the truck pivot pin where only radial movement took place. These new locomotives took over service on a division; a single locomotive hauled in five hours.

Mallet development culminated in 1941 with the 4-8-8-4 Big Boy type on the Union Pacific railroad. They weighed with a tender; at long (including the tender), they could only be turned on a few of the system&#x27;s turntables. They could develop on the drawbar at and were designed for a top speed of , though they rarely saw these speeds. Slightly shorter but even heavier and more powerful were s built by Lima for the C&amp;O and the Virginian between 1941 and 1948, which weighed and could produce up to at .

==The last Mallets==

These U.S. locomotives were paralleled to some extent by heavy-haul versions in the USSR, though without any attempt at faster running. Two examples built in Russia in 1954–55 were probably the last Mallets built in Europe. Four locomotives numbered BB81 to BB84 were built by Nippon Sharyo in 1962 for the Indonesian State Railways&#x27; Aceh railway line. They were probably the only Mallets to be built in Asia and the last Mallets ever built.

==Other continents==

Although it had found early favor in Europe, especially on lightly engineered railways, the Mallet type was generally superseded by the Garratt locomotive by the mid-1920s.
In the former Dutch East Indies, now Indonesia, Mallets of several types and sizes remained in use into the 1980s. The first generation of mallet used by &quot;Staatsspoorwegen&quot; (SS) was the SS500 / BB10 class manufactured by Sächsische Maschinenfabrik (Hartmann) and Schwartzkopff, which came in 1899 for the mountainous track in West Java. SS later introduced the larger SS 520 / CC10 class in 1904, built by several European manufacturers. Desiring for more powerful Mallets, SS ordered the SS 1200 / DD50 class in 1916 and the improved SS 1209 / DD51 class in 1919 from ALCO. As SS considered the American-made Mallets uneconomical to operate due to high fuel consumption, they ordered another batch of 2-8-8-0 in 1923 from various European manufacturers, which were classed as the SS 1250 / DD52. 

SS introduced the SS 1600 / CC50 in 1927. The class filled the gap for more powerful Mallet than CC10 class, yet lighter than the DD52 class. In 1962, the Indonesian State Railways (DKA) ordered a series of s, basically an updated version of the earlier Dutch design, for the old Aceh tramway. Constructed by Nippon Sharyo in Japan, they were the only Mallets built in Asia. In contrast to the rest of the Indonesian railways it has a gauge of , in contrast to used in Java and the rest of Sumatra. Smaller Mallets were used by plantations and other industries, all of the type. These ran mostly on and gauge networks.

Mallets were employed in Brazilian , tight-radius railroads.

One Mallet ran in New Zealand, and is preserved at Glenbrook Vintage Railway, Auckland.

Four Mallets ran in Australia, including two on the Magnet Tramway in Tasmania.

==Preservation==
Several Mallets have been preserved, some in operational condition. A number of the Union Pacific &quot;Big Boys&quot;, are preserved, including one overlooking Omaha, Nebraska where UP is based. In January 2014, Big Boy #4014 was removed from its museum ground parking track in Pomona, California, and hauled to Cheyenne, Wyoming, for restoration to operating condition; this was completed in May 2019. No. 4014 is the largest, heaviest, and most powerful operational steam locomotive in the world.

Two of Union Pacific&#x27;s Challengers survived into preservation. Challenger #3985 was the largest operational steam locomotive in the world until the restoration of UP 4014. It was taken out of service in October 2010 due to mechanical problems and retired from the Union Pacific&#x27;s excursion program in January 2020. As of January 2023, No. 3985 is being restored to operating condition by the Railroading Heritage of Midwest America.

Chesapeake &amp; Ohio 2-6-6-2 #1309, the last domestic steam locomotive built by Baldwin, was scheduled for restoration in September 2017. &quot;New as they were, the last C&amp;O steam engines never got adequate maintenance, lengthening the list of work needed to bring 1309 back to life.&quot; The locomotive was fired up and moved under her own steam on December 31, 2020, the first time she had done so in 64 years. On December 17, 2021, C&amp;O 1309 (now WMSR 1309) entered excursion service on the Western Maryland Scenic Railroad.

The single surviving example of a cab-forward Mallet is Southern Pacific 4294, on display at the California State Railroad Museum in Sacramento, California.

Several smaller logging-railroad Mallets have been restored to operating condition, including Black Hills Central #110 in Hill City, South Dakota, Clover Valley Lumber Company #4 in Sunol, California, and Columbia River Belt Line #7 &quot;Skookum&quot; in Garibaldi, Oregon (#7 is currently based in Sunol with #4).

Three Indonesian State Railways Mallet classes were preserved, consisting of a BB10 class, 3 units of CC50 class, and a 0-4-4-2T BB84. The BB10 12 which was manufactured in 1902 by Sächsische Maschinenfabrik and CC50 29 manufactured in Swiss Locomotive and Machine Works (SLM) are preserved at the Ambarawa Railway Museum. While the CC50 22, the Dutch-built Werkspoor Indonesian Mallet had been returned to the Netherlands and is now exhibited in the Dutch Railway Museum. Meanwhile, another of the CC50 class, the CC50 01 is preserved at Transportation Museum in Taman Mini Indonesia Indah (TMII). The BB84 of Aceh railway is preserved as a monument in Banda Aceh city.

Another industrial type has been purchased and restored by the Statfold Barn Railway in the UK. This saw its first operation in Europe in 2011 and after initial trials on the owners&#x27; railway, was transferred to the Welsh Highland Railway as its power is better suited to that railway.

A number of Mallets were constructed for the Nordhausen Wernigerode Eisenbahn, now part of the Harz Narrow Gauge Railways system in Germany. Running numbers 99 5901-3 and 99 5906 are in working order.

The Blonay–Chamby museum railway has two Mallets. First to be acquired was the Hanomag G 2x 3/3 No104. At 56 tonnes this locomotive was one of the largest steam metre gauge locos ever built in Europe. It was in service until 1979, and as of September 2021 is still under restoration. There is also a G 2x 2/2 No.105 built by Maschinenfabrik Karlsruhe. As of September 2021 it hauls tourist trains on 5% grades.

ABPF-SC (Brazilian Association for Railroad Preservation – Santa Catarina branch) has restored a Mallet to working order. It hauls tourist steam trains on 3% grades. The first official train ran on April 30, 2017.

==Terminology==
As a French-speaking Swiss, Mallet pronounced his name accordingly, something like &quot;Ma-lay&quot;.

Mallet&#x27;s original patent specifies compound expansion, but after his death in 1919 many locomotives (particularly in the United States) were articulated Mallet style without using compounding (for instance the Union Pacific Big Boy). When fleets of such locomotives appeared in the middle 1920s the trade press called them &quot;Simple Mallets&quot; — i.e., simple locomotives articulated like Mallets. The term &quot;Mallet&quot; continued to be widely used for simple as well as compound locomotives.

<text>The Black Stone () is a rock set into the eastern corner of the Kaaba, the ancient building in the center of the Grand Mosque in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. It is revered by Muslims as an Islamic relic which, according to Muslim tradition, dates back to the time of Adam and Eve.

The stone was venerated at the Kaaba in pre-Islamic pagan times. According to Islamic tradition, it was set intact into the Kaaba&#x27;s wall by the Islamic prophet Muhammad in 605 CE, five years before his first revelation. Since then, it has been broken into fragments and is now cemented into a silver frame in the side of the Kaaba. Its physical appearance is that of a fragmented dark rock, polished smooth by the hands of pilgrims. It has often been described as a meteorite.

Muslim pilgrims circle the Kaaba as a part of the &quot;tawaf&quot; ritual during the &quot;hajj&quot; and many try to stop to kiss the Black Stone, emulating the kiss that Islamic tradition records that it received from Muhammad. While the Black Stone is revered, Islamic theologians emphasize that it has no divine significance and that its importance is historical in nature.

== Physical description ==

The Black Stone was originally a single piece of rock but today consists of several pieces that have been cemented together. They are surrounded by a silver frame which is fastened by silver nails to the Kaaba&#x27;s outer wall. The fragments are themselves made up of smaller pieces which have been combined to form the seven or eight fragments visible today. The Stone&#x27;s exposed face measures about by . Its original size is unclear and the recorded dimensions have changed considerably over time, as the pieces have been rearranged in their cement matrix on several occasions. In the 10th century, an observer described the Black Stone as being one cubit () long. By the early 17th century, it was recorded as measuring . According to Ali Bey in the 18th century, it was described as high, and Muhammad Ali Pasha reported it as being long by wide.

The Black Stone is attached to the east corner of the Kaaba, known as &quot;al-Rukn al-Aswad&quot; (the &#x27;Corner of the Black Stone&#x27;). The choice of the east corner may have had ritual significance; it faces the rain-bringing east wind (&quot;al-qabul&quot;) and the direction from which Canopus rises.

The silver frame around the Black Stone and the black &quot;kiswah&quot; or cloth enveloping the Kaaba were for centuries maintained by the Ottoman Sultans in their role as Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques. The frames wore out over time due to the constant handling by pilgrims and were periodically replaced. Worn-out frames were brought back to Istanbul, where they are still kept as part of the sacred relics in the Topkapı Palace.

===Appearance of the Black Stone===
The Black Stone was described by European travellers to Arabia in the 19th- and early-20th centuries, who visited the Kaaba disguised as pilgrims. Swiss traveller Johann Ludwig Burckhardt visited Mecca in 1814, and provided a detailed description in his 1829 book &quot;Travels in Arabia&quot;:

Visiting the Kaaba in 1853, Richard Francis Burton noted that:

Ritter von Laurin, the Austrian consul-general in Egypt, was able to inspect a fragment of the Stone removed by Muhammad Ali in 1817 and reported that it had a pitch-black exterior and a silver-grey, fine-grained interior in which tiny cubes of a bottle-green material were embedded. There are reportedly a few white or yellow spots on the face of the Stone, and it is officially described as being white with the exception of the face.

== History and tradition ==


The Black Stone was held in reverence well before Islam. It had long been associated with the Kaaba, which was built in the pre-Islamic period and was a site of pilgrimage of Nabataeans who visited the shrine once a year to perform their pilgrimage. The Kaaba held 360 idols of the Meccan gods. The Semitic cultures of the Middle East had a tradition of using unusual stones to mark places of worship, while bowing, worshiping and praying to such sacred objects is also described in the Tanakh as idolatrous and was the subject of prophetic rebuke. The meteorite-origin theory of the Black Stone has seen it likened by some writers to the meteorite which was placed and worshipped in the Greek Temple of Artemis.

The Kaaba has been associated with fertility rites of Arabia. Some New Age writers remark on the apparent similarity of the Black Stone and its frame to the external female genitalia. However, the silver frame was placed on the Black Stone to secure the fragments, after the original stone was broken.

A &quot;red stone&quot; was associated with the deity of the south Arabian city of Ghaiman, and there was a &quot;white stone&quot; in the Kaaba of al-Abalat (near the city of Tabala, south of Mecca). Worship at that time period was often associated with stone reverence, mountains, special rock formations, or distinctive trees. The Kaaba marked the location where the sacred world intersected with the profane, and the embedded Black Stone was a further symbol of this as an object as a link between heaven and earth. Aziz Al-Azmeh claims that the divine name &quot;ar-Rahman&quot; (one of the names of God in Islam and cognate to one of the Jewish names of God &quot;Ha&#x27;Rachaman&quot;, both meaning &quot;the Merciful One&quot; or &quot;the Gracious One&quot;) was used for astral gods in Mecca and might have been associated with the Black Stone. Muhammad is said to have called the stone &quot;the right hand of al-Rahman&quot;.

=== Muhammad ===
According to Islamic belief, Muhammad is credited with setting the Black Stone in the current place in the wall of the Kaaba. A story found in Ibn Ishaq&#x27;s &quot;Sirah Rasul Allah&quot; tells how the clans of Mecca renovated the Kaaba following a major fire which had partly destroyed the structure. The Black Stone had been temporarily removed to facilitate the rebuilding work. The clans could not agree on which one of them should have the honour of setting the Black Stone back in its place.

They decided to wait for the next man to come through the gate and ask him to make the decision. That person was 35-year-old Muhammad, five years before his prophethood. He asked the elders of the clans to bring him a cloth and put the Black Stone in its centre. Each of the clan leaders held the corners of the cloth and carried the Black Stone to the right spot. Then, Muhammad set the stone in place, satisfying the honour of all of the clans. After his Conquest of Mecca in 630, Muhammad is said to have ridden round the Kaaba seven times on his camel, touching the Black Stone with his stick in a gesture of reverence.

===Desecrations===
The Stone has suffered repeated desecrations and damage over the course of time. It is said to have been struck and smashed to pieces by a stone fired from a catapult during the Umayyad Caliphate&#x27;s siege of Mecca in 683. The fragments were rejoined by Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr using a silver ligament. In January 930, it was stolen by the Qarmatians, who carried the Black Stone away to their base in Hajar (modern Eastern Arabia). According to Ottoman historian Qutb al-Din, writing in 1857, the Qarmatian leader Abu Tahir al-Jannabi set the Black Stone up in his own mosque, the &quot;Masjid al-Dirar&quot;, with the intention of redirecting the &quot;hajj&quot; away from Mecca. This failed, as pilgrims continued to venerate the spot where the Black Stone had been.

According to the historian al-Juwayni, the Stone was returned twenty-three years later, in 952. The Qarmatians held the Black Stone for ransom, and forced the Abbasids to pay a huge sum for its return. It was wrapped in a sack and thrown into the Friday Mosque of Kufa, accompanied by a note saying &quot;By command we took it, and by command we have brought it back.&quot; Its abduction and removal caused further damage, breaking the stone into seven pieces. Its abductor, Abu Tahir, is said to have met a terrible fate; according to Qutb al-Din, &quot;the filthy Abu Tahir was afflicted with a gangrenous sore, his flesh was eaten away by worms, and he died a most terrible death.&quot; To protect the shattered stone, the custodians of the Kaaba commissioned a pair of Meccan goldsmiths to build a silver frame to surround it, and it has been enclosed in a similar frame ever since.

In the 11th century, a man allegedly sent by the Fatimid caliph al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah attempted to smash the Black Stone but was killed on the spot, having caused only slight damage. In 1674, according to Johann Ludwig Burckhardt, someone allegedly smeared the Black Stone with excrement so that &quot;every one who kissed it retired with a sullied beard&quot;. According to the archaic Sunni belief, by the accusation of one boy, the Persian of an unknown faith was suspected of sacrilege, where Sunnis of Mecca &quot;have turned the circumstance to their own advantage&quot; by assaulting, beating random Persians and forbidding them from Hajj until the ban was overturned by the order of Muhammad Ali. The explorer Sir Richard Francis Burton pointed out on the alleged &quot;excrement action&quot; that &quot;it is scarcely necessary to say that a Shi&#x27;a, as well as a Sunni, would look upon such an action with lively horror&quot;, and that the real culprit was &quot;some Jew or Christian, who risked his life to gratify a furious bigotry&quot;.

== Ritual role ==

The Black Stone plays a central role in the ritual of , when pilgrims kiss the Black Stone, touch it with their hands or raise their hands towards it while repeating the &quot;God is Greatest&quot;. They perform this in the course of walking seven times around the Kaaba in a counterclockwise direction (), emulating the actions of Muhammad. At the end of each circuit, they perform and may approach the Black Stone to kiss it at the end of . In modern times, large crowds make it practically impossible for everyone to kiss the stone, so it is currently acceptable to point in the direction of the Stone on each of their seven circuits around the Kaaba. Some even say that the Stone is best considered simply as a marker, useful in keeping count of the ritual circumambulations that one has performed.

Writing in &quot;Dawn in Madinah: A Pilgrim&#x27;s Passage&quot;, Muzaffar Iqbal described his experience of venerating the Black Stone during a pilgrimage to Mecca:

The Black Stone and the Kaaba&#x27;s opposite corner, , are both often perfumed by the mosque&#x27;s custodians. This can cause problems for pilgrims in the state of (&#x27;consecration&#x27;), who are forbidden from using scented products and will require a (donation) as a penance if they touch either.

== Meaning and symbolism ==

One tradition holds that the Black Stone was placed by Adam in the original Kaaba. 
Muslims believe that the stone was originally pure and dazzling white, but has since turned black because of the sins of the people who touch it.

According to a prophetic tradition, &quot;Touching them both (the Black Stone and ) is an expiation for sins.&quot; Adam&#x27;s altar and the stone were said to have been lost during Noah&#x27;s Flood and forgotten. Ibrahim (Abraham) was said to have later found the Black Stone at the original site of Adam&#x27;s altar when the angel Jibrail revealed it to him. Ibrahim ordered his son Ismael – who in Muslim belief is an ancestor of Muhammad – to build a new temple, the Kaaba, into which the stone was to be embedded.

Another tradition says that the Black Stone was originally an angel that had been placed by God in the Garden of Eden to guard Adam. The angel was absent when Adam ate the forbidden fruit and was punished by being turned into a jewel – the Black Stone. God granted it the power of speech and placed it at the top of Abu Qubays, a mountain in the historic region of Khurasan, before moving the mountain to Mecca. When Ibrahim took the Black Stone from Abu Qubays to build the Kaaba, the mountain asked Ibrahim to intercede with God so that it would not be returned to Khurasan and would stay in Mecca.

Another tradition holds that it was brought down to Earth by &quot;an angel from heaven&quot;.

According to some scholars, the Black Stone was the same stone that Islamic tradition describes as greeting Muhammad before his prophethood. This led to a debate about whether the Black Stone&#x27;s greeting comprised actual speech or merely a sound, and following that, whether the stone was a living creature or an inanimate object. Whichever was the case, the stone was held to be a symbol of prophethood.

A hadith records that, when the second Caliph Umar ibn al-Khattab (580–644) came to kiss the stone, he said in front of all assembled: &quot;No doubt, I know that you are a stone and can neither harm anyone nor benefit anyone. Had I not seen Allah&#x27;s Messenger [Muhammad] kissing you, I would not have kissed you.&quot; In the hadith collection Kanz al-Ummal, it is recorded that Ali responded to Umar, saying, &quot;This stone (Hajar Aswad) can indeed benefit and harm.[...] Allah says in Quran that he created human beings from the progeny of Adam and made them witness over themselves and asked them, &#x27;Am I not your creator?&#x27; Upon this, all of them confirmed it. Thus Allah wrote this confirmation. And this stone has a pair of eyes, ears and a tongue and it opened its mouth upon the order of Allah, who put that confirmation in it and ordered to witness it to all those worshippers who come for Hajj.&quot;

Muhammad Labib al-Batanuni, writing in 1911, commented on the practice that the pre-Islamic practice of venerating stones (including the Black Stone) arose not because such stones are &quot;sacred for their own sake, but because of their relation to something holy and respected&quot;. The Indian Islamic scholar Muhammad Hamidullah summed up the meaning of the Black Stone:

In recent years several literalist views of the Black Stone have emerged. A small minority accepts as literally true a hadith, usually taken as allegorical, which asserts that &quot;the Stone will appear on the Day of Judgement () with eyes to see and a tongue to speak, and give evidence in favour of all who kissed it in true devotion, but speak out against whoever indulged in gossip or profane conversations during his circumambulation of the Kaaba&quot;.

== Scientific origins ==
The nature of the Black Stone has been much debated. It has been described variously as basalt stone, an agate, a piece of natural glass or—most popularly—a stony meteorite. , the curator of the Austro-Hungarian imperial collection of minerals, published the first comprehensive analysis of the Black Stone in 1857, in which he favoured a meteoritic origin for the stone. Robert Dietz and John McHone proposed in 1974 that the Black Stone was actually an agate, judging from its physical attributes and a report by an Arab geologist that the stone contained clearly discernible diffusion banding characteristic of agates.

A significant clue to its nature is provided by an account of the stone&#x27;s recovery in 951 CE, after it had been stolen 21 years earlier. According to a chronicler, the stone was identified by its ability to float in water, which would rule out the Black Stone being an agate, a basalt lava, or a stony meteorite, though it would be compatible with it being glass or pumice.

Elsebeth Thomsen of the University of Copenhagen proposed a different hypothesis in 1980. She suggested that the Black Stone may be a glass fragment, or impactite, from the impact of a fragmented meteorite that fell 6,000 years ago at Wabar, a site in the Rub&#x27; al Khali desert east of Mecca. A 2004 scientific analysis of the Wabar site suggests that the impact event happened much more recently than first thought and might have occurred within the last 200–300 years.

The meteoritic hypothesis is viewed by geologists as doubtful. The British Natural History Museum suggests that it may be a pseudometeorite; in other words, a terrestrial rock mistakenly attributed to a meteoritic origin.

The Black Stone has never been analysed with modern scientific techniques and its origins remain the subject of speculation.

<text>In economic theory, a factor price is the unit cost of using a factor of production, such as labor or physical capital.

There has been much debate as to what determines factor prices. Classical and Marxist economists argue that factor prices decided the value of a product and therefore the value is intrinsic within the product. For this reason, the term ″natural price″ is often used instead.

Marginalist economists argue that the factor price is a function of the demand for the final product, and so they are imputed from the finished product. The theory of imputation was first expounded by the Austrian economist Friedrich von Wieser.

<text>Charles Havice Moore II (born 9 September 1938), better known as Chuck Moore, is an American computer engineer and programmer, best known for inventing the Forth programming language in 1968. He cofounded FORTH, Inc., with Elizabeth Rather in 1971 and continued to evolve the language with an emphasis on simplicity.

Beginning in the early 1980s, Moore shifted focus to designing stack machines in hardware conjoined with Forth-like languages to run on them. He developed the Novix NC4000 and ShBoom (which evolved into the Ignite processor), then the minimal instruction set MuP21, and i21. He distanced himself from Forth proper, which by then had an official standard, and built ever more minimalist stack languages to support his own needs, particularly processor design. In the early 1990s, he implemented a system called OK for direct editing of x86 machine code without a compiler or assembler. He changed direction with colorForth, which uses internal tokens in the source code to guide a tiny compiler. He chose to visualize these tokens as different colors in a program, so code to be compiled and code to be interpreted are displayed distinctly.

In the 2000s he created a series of low-power chips, marketed by GreenArrays, containing up to 144 individual stack processors.

== Early career ==
Moore began programming at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory by the late 1950s. He attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and received a bachelors in physics in 1961. He entered Stanford University for graduate school to study mathematics but in 1965 he left to move to New York City to become a freelance programmer.

== Forth ==
In 1968, while employed at the United States National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO), Moore invented the initial version of the Forth language to help control radio telescopes. In 1971 he co-founded (with Elizabeth Rather) FORTH, Inc., the first, and still one of the leading, purveyors of Forth solutions. During the 1970s he ported Forth to dozens of computer architectures.

== Hardware design==
In the 1980s, Moore turned his attention and Forth development techniques to CPU design, developing several stack machine microprocessors and gaining several microprocessor-related patents along the way. His designs have all emphasized high performance at low power usage. He also explored alternate Forth architectures such as cmForth and machine Forth, which more closely matched his chips&#x27; machine languages.

In 1983 Moore founded Novix, Inc., where he developed the NC4000 processor. This design was licensed to Harris Semiconductor which marketed an enhanced version as the RTX2000, a radiation hardened stack processor which has been used in numerous NASA missions. In 1985 at his consulting firm Computer Cowboys, he developed the Sh-Boom processor. Starting in 1990, he developed his own VLSI CAD system, OKAD, to overcome limitations in existing CAD software. He used these tools to develop several multi-core minimal instruction set computer (MISC) chips: the MuP21 in 1990 and the F21 in 1993.

Moore was a founder of iTv Corp, one of the first companies to work on internet appliances. In 1996 he designed another custom chip for this system, the i21.

Moore developed the colorForth dialect of Forth, a language derived from the scripting language for his custom VLSI CAD system, OKAD. In 2001, he rewrote OKAD in colorForth and designed the c18 processor.

In 2005, Moore co-founded and became Chief Technology Officer of IntellaSys, which develops and markets his chip designs, such as the seaForth-24 multi-core processor.

In 2009, he co-founded and became CTO of GreenArrays, Inc which is marketing the GA4 and GA144 multi-computer chips.

<text>The Snowdome is an indoor ski slope just off the A5 road in Tamworth, Staffordshire, England. It opened in May 1994 and was the first full-sized recreational indoor ski slope in the UK.

==Facilities==
The slope is long by wide with an incline of around 1:7. There are also 2 serial &#x27;travelator&#x27; lifts for access back to the top and two rope-tows.

The Snowdome has a learner slope underneath the main slope. The main slope also holds regular &#x27;ramp nights&#x27; in which several objects are added, including a gas pipe, mini rail and a quarter pipe.

There is also one ice rink and one ice track - the UK’s only - which circles the real Snow Fun Park and the ice rink with a number of other things.

The complex also contains a swimming pool and gym—formerly known as Peaks Leisure Centre, but now owned and managed by the Snowdome as &#x27;Snowdome Swim&#x27; and &#x27;Snowdome Fitness&#x27; respectively. There is also a bar (aspens), a shop Ellis Brigham, and a coffee shop on site.

==Events==

Construction work started in early 2009 for Sawley Cross properties to build a 120-bed, £7M hotel on land adjacent to the snowdome. The Holiday Inn Hotel opened in late November 2009.

== Incidents ==
On 24 September 2021, a twelve-year-old boy was killed after being injured at a tobogganing party at the snowdome.

<doc id="320460" wikidata="Q5359785" url="?curid=320460" title="Eleven-plus">
<text>The eleven-plus (11+) is a standardised examination administered to some students in England and Northern Ireland in their last year of primary education, which governs admission to grammar schools and other secondary schools which use academic selection. The name derives from the age group for secondary entry: 11–12 years.

The eleven-plus was once used throughout the UK, but is now only used in counties and boroughs in England that offer selective schools instead of comprehensive schools. Also known as the transfer test, it is especially associated with the Tripartite System which was in use from 1944 until it was phased out across most of the UK by 1976.

The examination tests a student&#x27;s ability to solve problems using a test of verbal reasoning and non-verbal reasoning, and most tests now also offer papers in mathematics and English. The intention was that the eleven-plus should be a general test for intelligence (cognitive ability) similar to an IQ test, but by also testing for taught curriculum skills it is evaluating academic ability developed over previous years, which implicitly indicates how supportive home and school environments have been.

Introduced in 1944, the examination was used to determine which type of school the student should attend after primary education: a grammar school, a secondary modern school, or a technical school. The base of the Tripartite System was the idea that skills were more important than financial resources in determining what kind of schooling a child should receive: different skills required different schooling.

In some local education authorities the Thorne plan or scheme or system developed by Alec Clegg, named in reference to Thorne Grammar School, which took account of primary school assessment as well as the once-off 11+ examination, was later introduced.

== Within the Tripartite System ==

The Tripartite System of education, with an academic, a technical and a functional strand, was established in the 1940s. Prevailing educational thought at the time was that testing was an effective way to discover the strand to which a child was most suited. The results of the exam would be used to match children&#x27;s secondary schools to their abilities and future career needs.

When the system was implemented, technical schools were not available on the scale envisaged. Instead, the Tripartite System came to be characterised by fierce competition for places at the prestigious grammar schools. As such, the eleven-plus took on a particular significance. Rather than allocating according to need or ability, it became seen as a question of passing or failing. This led to the exam becoming widely resented by some although strongly supported by others.

=== Structure ===

The structure of the eleven-plus varied over time, and among the different counties which used it. Usually, it consisted of three papers:

* Arithmetic – A mental arithmetic test.
* Writing – An essay question on a general subject.
* General Problem Solving – A test of general knowledge, assessing the ability to apply logic to simple problems.

Some exams have:

* Verbal Reasoning
* Non-Verbal Reasoning

Most children took the eleven-plus in their final year of primary school: usually at age 10 or 11. In Berkshire and Buckinghamshire it was also possible to sit the test a year early – a process named the &quot;ten-plus&quot;; later, the Buckinghamshire test was called the &quot;twelve-plus&quot; and taken a year later than usual.

Originally, the test was voluntary; , some 30% of students in Northern Ireland do not sit for it.

In Northern Ireland, pupils sitting the exam were awarded grades in the following ratios: A (25%), B1 (5%), B2 (5%), C1 (5%), C2 (5%), D (55%). There was no official distinction between pass grades and fail grades.

== Current practice ==

There are 163 remaining grammar schools in various parts of England, and 67 in Northern Ireland. In counties in which vestiges of the Tripartite System still survive, the eleven-plus continues to exist. Today it is generally used as an entrance test to a specific group of schools, rather than a blanket exam for all pupils, and is taken voluntarily. For more information on these, see the main article on grammar schools.

Eleven-plus and similar exams vary around the country but will use some or all of the following components:

* Verbal Reasoning (VR)
* Non-Verbal reasoning (NVR)
* Mathematics (MA)
* English (EN)

Eleven-plus tests take place in September of children&#x27;s final primary school year with results provided to parents in October to allow application for secondary schools. In Lincolnshire children will sit the Verbal Reasoning and Non-Verbal Reasoning. In Buckinghamshire children sit tests in Verbal Reasoning, Mathematics and Non-Verbal reasoning. In Kent, where the eleven-plus test is more commonly known as the Kent Test, children sit all four of the above disciplines; however the Creative Writing, which falls as part the English test, will only be used in circumstances of appeal. In the London Borough of Bexley from September 2008, following a public consultation, pupils sitting the Eleven-Plus exam are only required to do a Mathematics and Verbal Reasoning paper. In Essex, where the examination is optional, children sit Verbal Reasoning, Mathematics and English. Other areas use different combinations. Some authorities/areas operate an opt-in system, while others (such as Buckinghamshire) operate an opt-out system where all pupils are entered unless parents decide to opt out. In the North Yorkshire, Harrogate/York area, children are only required to sit two tests: Verbal and Non-Verbal Reasoning.

Independent schools in England generally select children at the age of 13, using a common set of papers known as the Common Entrance Examination. About ten do select at eleven; using papers in English, Mathematics and Science. These also have the Common entrance exam name.

=== Scoring ===

England has 163 grammar schools 155 of which control their own admissions including the choice of test. (143 Academy Converters, six Foundation schools and six Voluntary aided schools control their own admissions. Admissions for the remaining seven Community Schools and one Voluntary Controlled school are determined by the local authority.;

Over 95% of grammar schools now determine their own admissions policies, choosing what tests to set and how to weight each component. Although some form consortia with nearby schools to agree on a common test, there may be as many as 70 different 11+ tests set across the country meaning it is not possible to refer to &quot;the eleven plus test&quot; as a single entity.

Tests are multiple choice. The number of questions varies but the guidance provided by GLA 
 shows that full length Maths and English Comprehension tests are both 50 minutes duration and consist of about 50 questions. Verbal Reasoning is 60 minutes containing 80 questions. Non-Verbal Reasoning is 40 minutes broken into four 10-minute separately-timed sections each containing 20 questions. At a rate of one question every 30 seconds, it could be argued that the test is one of speed rather than intelligence.

One mark is awarded for each correct answer. No marks are deducted for incorrect or un-attempted responses.
 There are usually five possible answers, one of which is always correct meaning a random guess has a 20% chance of being correct and a strategy of guessing all un-attempted questions in the last few seconds of the exam will, if anything, gain the candidate a few additional marks which may make the difference needed to gain a place.

The actual marks from these tests, referred to as &quot;raw&quot; marks, are not disclosed by all schools, and instead parents are given &quot;Standard Age Scores&quot; (SAS). A standard score shows how well the individual has performed relative to the mean (average) score for the &quot;population&quot; although the term &quot;population&quot; is open to interpretation. GL Assessment, who set the majority of 11+ tests, say it should be, &quot;a very large, representative sample of students usually across the UK&quot;; however, grammar schools may &quot;standardise&quot; their tests against just those children who apply to them in a given year, as this enables them to match supply to demand.

Test results follow a normal distribution resulting in the familiar bell curve which reliably predicts how many test takers gain each different score. For example, only 15.866% score more than one standard deviation above the mean (+1σ generally represented as 115 SAS) as can be seen by adding up the proportions in this graph based on the original provided by M. W. Toews).

By &quot;standardising&quot; on just the cohort of applicants, a school with for example, 100 places which regularly gets 800 applications can set a minimum pass mark of 115 which selects approximately 127 applicants filling all of the places and leaving about 27 on the waiting list. The downside of this &quot;local standardisation&quot;, as it has been called, is parents are frequently unaware that their children are being judged as much by the standard of other applicants as their own abilities.
Another issue with the lack of national standards in testing is it prevents any comparison &quot;between&quot; schools. Public perception may be that only pupils who are of &quot;grammar school standard&quot; are admitted to grammar schools; however, other information such as the DfE league tables calls into question the existence of any such &quot;standard&quot;. Competition for places at Sutton Grammar School is extremely fierce with, according to an online forum over 2,500 applicants in 2016. At the other end of the scale, Buckinghamshire council website says, &quot;If your child&#x27;s STTS is 121 or above, they qualify for grammar school. We expect that about 37% of children will get an STTS of 121 or more.&quot; Official statistics show 100% of those admitted to Sutton Grammar School have, &quot;high prior attainment at the end of key stage 2&quot;, compared to only 44% of those who attend Skegness Grammar School. The Grammar Schools Heads Association&#x27;s Spring 2017 newsletter says the government are considering a national selection test which would remove the lack of consistency between different 11+ tests. 
Between them, GL and CEM earn an estimated £2.5m annually from setting and marking the 11+ tests. Releasing the raw marks would bring some clarity to the admissions process but attempts to do so have generally been unsuccessful. GL have used the fact that they are not covered by Freedom of Information legislation to withhold information made for information relating to the 11+ exams used by Altrincham Grammar School for Boys, who stated, &quot;Our examination provider, GL Assessment Limited (GL) is not subject to the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FOI) as it is not a public body.“, whilst their main rival CEM successfully argued in court that, &quot;one of the benefits of its 11+ testing is that it is &#x27;tutor proof&#x27;” and releasing the raw marks would undermine this unique selling point.

When a standard score is calculated the results is a negative value for any values below the mean. As it would seem very strange to be given a negative score Goldstein and Fogelman (1974) explain, &quot;It is common to &#x27;normalise&#x27; the scores by transforming them to give a distribution with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15.&quot; Thus a normalised SAS of 100 indicates the mean (average) achievement whilst a score of 130 would be two standard deviations above the mean. A score achieved by only 2.2% of the &quot;population&quot;. Most, but not all, authorities normalise follow this convention. The following table showing the normalisation values used by some for 2017 entry (tests taken in 2016).

=== Northern Ireland ===
The system in Northern Ireland differed from that in England. The last eleven-plus was held in November 2008. A provision in the Education Order (NI) 1997 states that &quot;the Department may issue and revise guidance as it thinks appropriate for admission of pupils to grant-aided schools&quot;. Citing this on 21 January 2008, Northern Ireland&#x27;s Education Minister Caitríona Ruane passed new guidelines regarding post-primary progression as regulation rather than as legislation. This avoided the need for the proposals to be passed by the Northern Ireland Assembly, where cross-party support for the changes did not exist. Some schools, parents and political parties object to the new legal framework. As a result, many post-primary schools are setting their own entrance examinations.

== Controversy ==
The 11-plus was a result of major changes which took place in English and Welsh education in the years up to 1944. In particular, the Hadow Report of 1926 called for the division of primary and secondary education to take place on the cusp of adolescence at 11 or 12. The implementation of this break by the Butler Act seemed to offer an ideal opportunity to implement streaming, since all children would be changing school anyway. Thus testing at 11 emerged largely as an historical accident, without other specific reasons for testing at that age.

The test, composed of Maths, English and Verbal Reasoning could not be passed by 10-year-olds who had not been trained for the test. A former highmaster of Manchester Grammar School asserted on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s The Moral Maze that no child who had not seen the verbal reasoning tests that formed the basis of the 11-plus before attempting them would have a &quot;hope in hell&quot; of passing them, and he had dispensed with the 11-plus as &quot;worthless&quot;. Instead he used personal interviews. Children in school were drilled in the 11-plus until it was &quot;coming out of their ears&quot;. Families had to play the system, little booklets were available from local newsagents that showed how to pass the exam and contained many past papers with all the answers provided, which the children then learned by rote.

Criticism of the 11-plus arose on a number of grounds, though many related more to the wider education system than to academic selection generally or the 11-plus specifically. The proportions of schoolchildren gaining a place at a grammar school varied by location and sex. 35% of pupils in the South West of England secured grammar school places as opposed to 10% in Nottinghamshire. In some areas, because of the continuance of single-sex schooling in those areas, there were sometimes fewer places for girls than for boys. Some areas were coeducational and had equal number of places for each sex.

Critics of the 11-plus also claimed that there was a strong class bias in the exam. JWB Douglas, studying the question in 1957, found that children on the borderline of passing were more likely to get grammar school places if they came from middle-class families. For example, questions about the role of household servants or classical composers were far easier for middle-class children to answer than for those from less wealthy or less educated backgrounds. In response, the 11-plus was redesigned during the 1960s to be more like an IQ test. However, even after this modification, grammar schools were largely attended by middle-class children while secondary modern schools were attended by mostly working-class children. By testing cognitive skills the child&#x27;s innate ability is evaluated as a predictor to future academic performance and is largely independent of background and support . The problem lies with the testing of academic subjects, such as Maths and English, where a child from a working class background with a less supportive school and less educated parents is being measured on their learning environment instead of potential to succeed .

Passing – or not passing – the 11-plus was a &quot;defining moment in many lives&quot;, with education viewed as &quot;the silver bullet for enhanced social mobility.&quot; Richard Hoggart claimed in 1961 that &quot;what happens in thousands of homes is that the 11-plus examination is identified in the minds of parents, not with &#x27;our Jimmy is a clever lad and he&#x27;s going to have his talents trained&#x27;, but &#x27;our Jimmy is going to move into another class, he&#x27;s going to get a white-collar job&#x27; or something like that.&quot;

<text>Keith Coogan (born Keith Eric Mitchell; January 13, 1970) is an American actor. He is the grandson of actor Jackie Coogan.

==Early life==
Keith Eric Mitchell was born on January 13, 1970, in Palm Springs, California, the son of Leslie Diane Coogan Mitchell, a realtor. He changed his name to &quot;Keith Coogan&quot; in 1986, two years after the death of his grandfather, Jackie Coogan.

==Career==
As a child, he appeared on episodes of &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot;, &quot;The Waltons&quot;, &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;, &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot;, &quot;Mork &amp; Mindy&quot;, &quot;Eight Is Enough&quot;, &quot;Knight Rider&quot;, &quot;Growing Pains&quot;, &quot;Silver Spoons&quot;, &quot;Fame&quot;, and &quot;CHiPs&quot;.

In 1982, Coogan also appeared as &#x27;William&#x27; in the adaptation of Ray Bradbury&#x27;s &quot;All Summer in a Day&quot; that aired on the PBS series &quot;WonderWorks&quot;. He also appeared in the TV movie Memorial Day (1983 film) but imdb.com has the wrong Keith Mitchell credited.

He has also starred in films including &quot;Adventures in Babysitting&quot;, &quot;Cousins&quot;, &quot;Hiding Out&quot;, &quot;Cheetah&quot;, &quot;Toy Soldiers&quot;, &quot;Book of Love&quot;, and &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Mom the Babysitter&#x27;s Dead&quot;, and straight-to-video releases such as &quot;Python&quot;, &quot;Soulkeeper&quot;, and &quot;Downhill Willie&quot;. He guest-starred on &quot;Joan of Arcadia&quot; and &quot;Married to the Kellys&quot;.

His theater credits include John Olive&#x27;s &quot;The Voice of the Prairie&quot;, James McLure&#x27;s &quot;Pvt. Wars&quot;, and an unfinished Louisville work by Marsha Norman, &quot;The Holdup&quot;. All were performed at Timothy and Buck Busfield&#x27;s &quot;B&quot; St. Theater in Sacramento, California, during the 1992 and 1993 seasons.

In 2008, he worked in Dallas, Texas, on a short film, &quot;The Keith Coogan Experience&quot;. On January 1, 2010, Coogan started the &quot;Monologue a Day Project&quot;, where he learns a monologue or other short piece every day, &quot;as inspired by Julie &amp; Julia&quot;, and posts the resulting video performance on blogspot.com.

Coogan was featured in the minidocumentary, &quot;Simply Coogan – An Interview with Keith Coogan&quot;, released by Coogan on December 13, 2010, which coincided with his birthday celebrations.

Coogan hosted &quot;The Call Sheet&quot; on the SkidRowStudios.com radio podcast network, an entertainment industry-based show that also covered tech news and politics.

<text>The XLR connector is a type of electrical connector primarily used in professional audio, video, and stage lighting equipment. XLR connectors are cylindrical, with three to seven connector pins, and are often employed for analog balanced audio interconnections, AES3 digital audio, portable intercom, DMX512 lighting control, and for low-voltage power supply. XLR connectors are part of the international standard for dimensions, IEC 61076-2-103. The XLR connector resembles the DIN connector, but is larger, more robust and physically incompatible.

The generic term &quot;XLR&quot; began as a trademark of Cannon Electric, with the letters standing for X model connector with an added &quot;L&quot;atch feature, and &quot;R&quot;esilient neoprene rubber surrounding the female contacts.

== History and manufacturers ==
The XLR connector (also Cannon plug and Cannon connector) was invented by James H. Cannon, founder of the Cannon Electric company, Los Angeles, California. The XLR connector originated from the &quot;Cannon X&quot; series of connectors; by 1950, a latching mechanism was added to the connector, which produced the &quot;Cannon XL&quot; model of connector, and by 1955, the female connector featured synthetic-rubber insulation polychloroprene (neoprene), identified with the part-number prefix &quot;XLR&quot;. There was also the &quot;XLP&quot; series of connectors with hard plastic insulation, but the XLR model name is commonly used for all of the variants.

Originally, the ITT Cannon company manufactured XLR connectors in two locations: Kanagawa, Japan, and Melbourne, Australia. The Australian factory was sold to Alcatel Components in 1992 and then acquired by Amphenol in 1998. Later, the Switchcraft corporation manufactured compatible connectors, followed by the Neutrik company, which made improvements to the connector, and produced a second-generation design (the X-series) that had only four parts for the cable connector, and eliminated the small screws used in the models of XLR connectors made by Cannon and Switchcraft, as well as in earlier Neutrik series.

== Design ==
XLR connectors are available in male and female versions in both cable and chassis mounting designs, a total of four styles. This is slightly unusual as many other connector designs omit one of the styles (typically a chassis mounting male connector).

The female XLR connectors are designed with a longer metal sleeve to first connect pin 1 (the earth pin), before the other pins make contact, when a male XLR connector is inserted. With the ground connection established before the signal lines are connected, the insertion (and removal) of XLR connectors in live equipment is possible without hearing an annoying static pop (as usually happens with, for example, RCA connectors).

The number of pins varies. As of 2016, XLR connectors are available with up to 10 pins, and mini XLR connectors with up to eight. XLR connectors from different manufacturers will intermate, with the exception of six-pin models, which are available in two incompatible designs. The older Switchcraft six-pin design adds a center pin to the standard five-pin design, whereas the newer Neutrik design is a different pattern. The Switchcraft six-pin female will accept a standard five-pin male plug whereas the Neutrik six-pin design will not. Neutrik offers connectors in both six-pin designs.

The terminology for labeling the corresponding members of a pair of mating connectors follows the usual rules for the gender of connectors: a &#x27;male&#x27; connector is the one with pins on the &quot;smallest&quot; element, &#x27;female&#x27; has corresponding receptacles. A &#x27;plug&#x27; connector enters the &#x27;socket&#x27; connector, judged by the largest element. For most XLR, plugs are male and sockets are female. XLR are unusual as, at least in audio applications, all four combinations of male and female, plugs and sockets are equally common. A common misnomer is that &#x27;plugs&#x27; are free connectors and &#x27;sockets&#x27; are panel-mounted, but XLR uses many free female sockets and panel-mounted male plugs. There is a loose convention for audio work that signals are generated by equipment with male pins and transmitted to those with female receptacles. The circumference of an XLR connector at the widest point is .

== Current patterns and applications ==
===Three-pin (XLR3)===
Three-pin XLR connectors are by far the most common style, and are an industry standard for balanced audio signals. The great majority of professional microphones use the XLR connector. In previous years, they were used for loudspeaker connections, for instance by Trace Elliot in its bass enclosures. The XLR could accept 14 AWG () wire with a current-carrying capacity of 15 amps, suitable for most loudspeakers, but they have been superseded by the Speakon connector for professional loudspeakers. The Speakon connector accepts larger wire and carries more current, and it provides a better shield for the contacts, which may carry dangerous voltages when connected to an amplifier.

Three-pin XLR connectors are used to interconnect powered speakers with line-level signals used for PA system applications.

Rechargeable devices exist that use three-pin XLR connectors. These can be found on electric powered mobility wheelchairs and scooters. The connectors carry from 2 to 10 amps at 24 volts.

An obsolete use for three-pin XLR connectors was for MIDI data on some Octave-Plateau synthesizers including the Voyetra-8.

The three-pin XLR connector is commonly used for DMX512, on lighting and related control equipment, particularly at the budget / DJ end of the market. However, using three-pin XLR connectors for DMX512 is specifically prohibited by section 7.1.2 of the DMX512 standard. Use of the three-pin XLR in this context firstly presents a risk of damage to the lighting equipment should an audio cable carrying 48-volt phantom power be accidentally connected.

===Four-pin (XLR4)===
Four-pin XLR connectors are used in a variety of applications.

They are the standard connector for intercom headsets, such as systems made by Clear-Com and Telex. Two pins are used for the mono headphone signal and two pins for the unbalanced microphone signal.

Another common use is for DC power connections for professional film and video cameras and related equipment. Some desk microphones with LEDs use them. The fourth pin is used to power the LED indicating that the microphone is on.
Other uses for the four-pin XLR include some scrollers (colour-changing devices for stage lighting), AMX analog lighting control (now obsolete) and some pyrotechnic equipment.

Four-pin XLR is used for balanced headphone connections, from a balanced amplifier, where there is no common earth between the two channels. Connection diagram: 1. left channel (+) phase; 2. left channel (−) phase; 3. right channel (+) phase; 4. right channel (−) phase.

===Five-pin (XLR5)===
Five-pin XLR connectors are the standard for DMX512 digital lighting control.

Other common uses are for dual-element or stereo microphones (two balanced audio signals with a common ground) and stereo intercom headset (three pins for the stereo headphone signal - left, right, and ground, and two pins for the unbalanced microphone signal).

Additionally, five-pin XLR is commonly used for DC power in audio equipment.

XLR 5 is used in aviation headsets, where it can supply power for active noise cancellation.

===Six-pin (XLR6)===
Six-pin XLR connectors are used for dual channel intercom systems and stage lighting control applications. Another common use is professional stereo headset with balanced microphone (headphone left-pin 4, headphone right-pin 5, headphone common-pin 3, mic high-pin 2, mic low-pin 1, mic ground-pin 6).

===Seven-pin (XLR7)===
Seven-pin XLR connectors are used to connect some valve (tube) condenser microphones to their power supplies (carrying signal, polarisation voltage, heater and HT).

Used by several models of Le Maitre and Ultratec fog machines for remote control.

An obsolete use for seven-pin XLR connectors was analogue lighting control signals, as well as for wired intercom in broadcast studios, specifically with Ward-Beck intercoms.

===PDN===
The &quot;loudspeaker Cannon&quot; (known as a &quot;PDN&quot; connector) had blue or white insulation (depending on its gender), and was intended for connections between audio power amplifiers and loudspeakers. These are manufactured by Amphenol (formerly by Alcatel Components and ITT Cannon Australia).

==Obsolete patterns==
Many other types of connectors using the XLR type shell exist, with various pin configurations. One is the now obsolete three-pin power pattern connector manufactured by ITT Cannon.

The &quot;power Cannon&quot; (also called the &quot;XLR-LNE&quot; connector) had shrouded pins and red insulation; it was intended as a mains power plug, alternative to the IEC 60320 series of connectors, but was only used on a few pieces of equipment.

===Two-pin (XLR2)===
A two-pin variant was used as the DC power input socket on Yamaha&#x27;s 1970s CP-series &#x27;Electric Grand&#x27; pianos (CP-60, CP-70 and CP-80).

== Technical usage information ==

This section contains more technical information relating the most common applications of XLR connectors.

===Three-pin in audio use===

EIA Standard RS-297-A describes the use of the three-pin XLR - known as XLR3 - for balanced audio signal level applications:
Prior to the introduction of this standard, the wiring of pins 2 and 3 varied. The pin 2 &quot;hot&quot; and pin 3 &quot;cold&quot; convention was typically used by European and Japanese equipment manufacturers, but American companies used pin 3 &quot;hot&quot; and pin 2 &quot;cold&quot;. This caused problems when interconnecting equipment with unbalanced connections. The pin 3 &quot;hot&quot; convention is now obsolete but is still found on vintage equipment. Pin 1 has always been ground and/or shield if the cable is shielded, and many connectors connect it internally to the connector shell or case.

Although covered in industry technical standards, there is still some disagreement on the best way to handle the use of pin 1 for grounding (earthing). The main controversy is whether the shell of the connector should be connected to pin 1 or the shield, or left floating. AES standards mentioned above recommend that shells of cable-mounted connectors should never be connected to pin 1 or the shield, because inadvertent contact of the shell with another grounded surface while in use can create unwanted current paths for fault current, potentially causing hum and other noise. On the other hand, equipment containing active circuitry should always have pin 1 connected to the conductive enclosure of the equipment as close as possible to the point where the signal enters the enclosure. The argument centers on the radio frequency shielding provided by the shell of the connector, which may be reduced if it is left floating. An alternative solution is to connect the shell to pin 1 and the shield through a small value capacitor, providing RF shielding but allowing very little audio-frequency current to flow. This capability can be built into a fixed jack or a cable terminated with XLR connectors.

The standard signal flow for audio in XLR connectors is that the output is a male connector and the input is female. In other words, the pins on the plug point in the direction of signal flow. Phantom power, if used, originates from the socket and flows into the plug, (the opposite direction to the signal and the normal direction for power circuits). The voltages of microphone and line level audio signals are not hazardous. The male XLR is usually incorporated in the body of a microphone.

Since equipment often requires an input on a TRS phone jack or an XLR connector, Neutrik and Amphenol offer several models of combination connector that accept both XLR and TS or TRS phone plugs.

=== Four-pin – DC power ===
The most common standard is for pin 1 to be ground and pin 4 to be 12 volts (nominal), with pins 2 and 3 unused. This configuration is used on most professional video cameras and is also common on audio equipment designed for location use. There are other non-standard arrangements, particularly found on older equipment.

=== Four-pin – intercom headset ===
Clear-Com, Telex, RTS and many other production intercom systems use four-pin XLR connectors for attaching monaural intercom headsets or handsets. The standard pinout for four-pin XLR headsets is: Pin 1 = Microphone ground (screen/shield); Pin 2 = Microphone signal (&quot;hot&quot;) input; Pin 3 = Headphone ground (return); Pin 4 = Headphone signal (&quot;hot&quot;) output.

=== Five-pin – DMX512 and DC power for audio systems ===

The five-pin XLR is the standard connector for DMX512, the most common protocol for controlling professional lighting and related equipment. Three-pin XLR connectors are increasingly common instead. These are electrically compatible with a simple jumpering 1–1, 2–2, 3–3 between them. However, using three-pin XLR connectors for DMX512 is specifically prohibited by section 7.1.2 of the DMX512 standard.

Five-pin XLR is also a common power connector in modular professional audio systems, such as the Automated Processes, Inc.&#x27;s (API) Lunchbox format. This format is becoming increasingly popular and five-pin XLR for DC power is used by many third-party module and chassis developers such as BAE Audio and JLM Audio. It is also used by Slate Digital for the VMS1 microphone preamp. Typically the pin configuration is:

Pin 1: Chassis Ground
Pin 2: Power Ground
Pin 3: Positive Voltage (Typically +15 volts or +16 volts)
Pin 4: Negative Voltage (Typically -15 volts or -16 volts)
Pin 5: Phantom Power Voltage (Typically +48 volts)

Where XLR connectors are used for DC power, the genders are reversed with respect to their standard use for line-level and mic-level audio. Typically, audio signals on XLR connectors &quot;follow the pin,&quot; such that a male connector is an output and a female connector is an input. In most power applications (not just XLR connectors) the female connector is the output and the male connector is the input. This makes accidental contact with live parts less likely. In audio devices it also prevents accidental application of DC power to signal inputs.

==Other uses==
Three-pin XLR connectors were once used extensively on loudspeaker cables, because when first introduced they represented a new standard of ruggedness, and economical alternatives were not readily available. Often, two-conductor loudspeaker cable had three-pin female connectors on both ends, to distinguish it from a three-conductor shielded signal-level cable, which has a female connector at one end and a male at the other. Either pin 2 or 3 was live, depending on the manufacturer, with pin 1 always the &#x27;earth&#x27; return. This use has become both obsolete and dangerous to equipment but is still sometimes encountered on older equipment. For example, some loudspeakers have a built-in male connector as an &quot;input&quot; connector for speaker-level signal. This has been superseded in professional audio applications by the Neutrik Speakon connector.

Three pin XLR connectors are popular power connectors for charging ebike batteries (24V, 36v and 48v).

==Phantom power==

Some microphones such as condenser microphones require power. An alternative to battery power is phantom power, which consists of direct current applied equally through the two signal lines of a balanced audio connector, usually a three-pin XLR connector. The supply voltage is referenced to the ground pin of the connector (pin 1 of an XLR), which normally is connected to the cable shield or a ground wire in the cable or both. Phantom power is usually supplied at a nominal 48 volts DC, although lower voltages are permissible and modern microphones will often operate over a wide range.

It is common for modern mixers to have a built-in switch-operated 48-volt power supply which supplies all mic inputs with phantom power, thus eliminating the need for bulky external supplies on individual mics.

==XLD keyed variant==
The XLD connector is a proposed keyed variant of the XLR connector. The keys prevent accidental mixing of XLR and XLD connectors. XLD plugs and sockets are used mostly in professional audio and video electronics cabling applications.

The XLD connector is proposed by the Audio Engineering Society AES42 digital microphone interface standard.

The connectors are similar to XLR but with an extra coding key and groove that allows control over the intermating of XLD plugs and XLR sockets. A connector with the coding key installed will not mate with a connector that does not have the matching groove. By suitably keying connectors, analog microphones can be protected from damage by the high current digital phantom power supply provided for digital microphones.

==Mini XLR connector==

The &quot;Mini XLR Connector&quot;, also known as the &quot;TQG&quot; or &quot;TA3&quot;/&quot;TA4&quot; connector (number depending on number of poles), is used on compact items such as UHF wireless microphone beltpacks, some studio and field recording headphones, as well as Audio Technica condenser microphones, but is not in general use on major items such as mixing desks. The Mini XLR Connector was first devised by Switchcraft and is also available from Rean, and various other sources. As yet, the Mini XLR connectors do not appear to be covered by any ISO or national standard.

<text>The University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg (), commonly known as Wits University or Wits, is a multi-campus public research university situated in the northern areas of central Johannesburg, South Africa. The university has its roots in the mining industry, as do Johannesburg and the Witwatersrand in general. Founded in 1896 as the South African School of Mines in Kimberley, it is the third oldest South African university in continuous operation.

The university has an enrollment of 40,259 students as of 2018, of which approximately 20 percent live on campus in the university&#x27;s 17 residences. 63 percent of the university&#x27;s total enrollment is for undergraduate study, with 35 percent being postgraduate and the remaining 2 percent being Occasional Students.

==History==

===Early years: 1896–1922===
The university was founded in Kimberley in 1896 as the South African School of Mines. It is the third oldest South African university in continuous operation, after the University of Cape Town (founded in 1829), and Stellenbosch University (founded in 1866). Eight years later, in 1904, the school was moved to Johannesburg and renamed the Transvaal Technical Institute. The school&#x27;s name changed yet again in 1906 to Transvaal University College. In 1908, a new campus of the Transvaal University College was established in Pretoria. The Johannesburg and Pretoria campuses separated on 17 May 1910, each becoming a separate institution. The Johannesburg campus was reincorporated as the South African School of Mines and Technology, while the Pretoria campus remained the Transvaal University College until 1930 when it became the University of Pretoria. In 1920, the school was renamed the University College, Johannesburg.

===Open years: 1922–1959===
Finally, on 1 March 1922, the University College, Johannesburg, was granted full university status after being incorporated as the University of the Witwatersrand. The Johannesburg municipality donated a site in Milner Park, north-west of Braamfontein, to the new institution as its campus and construction began the same year, on 4 October. The first Chancellor of the new university was Prince Arthur of Connaught and the first Principal (a position that would be merged with that of Vice-Chancellor in 1948) was Professor Jan Hofmeyr. Hofmeyr set the tone of the university&#x27;s subsequent opposition to apartheid when, during his inaugural address as Principal he declared, while discussing the nature of a university and its desired function in a democracy, that universities &quot;should know no distinctions of class, wealth, race or creed&quot;. True to Hofmeyr&#x27;s words, from the outset Wits was an open university with a policy of non-discrimination on racial or any other grounds.

Initially, there were six faculties—Arts, Science, Medicine, Engineering, Law and Commerce—37 departments, 73 academic staff, and approximately 1,000 students. In 1923, the university began moving into the new campus, slowly vacating its former premises on Ellof Street for the first completed building in Milner Park: the Botany and Zoology Block. In 1925, the Prince of Wales (the future Edward VIII) officially opened Central Block (which includes the Great Hall).

The university&#x27;s first library, housed at the time in what was meant to be a temporary construction, was destroyed in a fire on Christmas Eve in 1931. Following this, an appeal was made to the public for £80,000 to pay for the construction of a new library, and the acquisition of books. This resulted in the fairly rapid construction of the William Cullen Library; opened in 1934. During this period, as the Great Depression hit South Africa, the university was faced with severe financial restrictions. Nonetheless, it continued to grow at an impressive rate. From a total enrolment of 2,544 students in 1939, the university grew to 3,100 in 1945. This growth led to accommodation problems, which were temporarily resolved by the construction of wood and galvanised-iron huts in the centre of the campus (which remained in use until 1972).

During World War II, Wits was involved in South Africa&#x27;s war efforts. The Bernard Price Institute of Geophysical Research was placed under the Union of South Africa&#x27;s defence ministry, and was involved in important research into the use of radar. Additionally, an elite force of female soldiers was trained on the university&#x27;s campus.

In 1948 the National Party (NP) was voted into power by South Africa&#x27;s white electorate, and apartheid (Afrikaans for &quot;separateness&quot;) policies started to become law. The racist separation policies sparked a response, in 1957, by Wits, the University of Cape Town, Rhodes University and the University of Natal, who issued a joint statement entitled &quot;The Open Universities in South Africa&quot;, committing themselves to the principles of university autonomy and academic freedom.

In 1959, the apartheid government&#x27;s &quot;Extension of University Education Act&quot; forced restricted registrations of black students for most of the apartheid era; despite this, several notable black leaders graduated from the university. Wits protested strongly and continued to maintain a firm and consistent stand in opposition to apartheid. This marked the beginning of a period of conflict with the apartheid regime, which also coincided with a period of massive growth for the university. It was desegregated once again, prior to the abolition of apartheid, in 1990. Several of apartheid&#x27;s most provocative critics, of either European or African descent, were one-time students and graduates of the university.

===Growth and opposition to apartheid: 1959–1994===

As the university continued to grow (from a mere 6,275 students in 1963, to 10,600 in 1975, to over 16,400 by 1985), the expansion of the university&#x27;s campus became imperative. In 1964, the medical library and administrative offices of the Faculty of Medicine moved to Esselen Street, in the Hillbrow district of Johannesburg. In 1968, the Graduate School of Business was opened in Parktown. A year later, the Ernest Oppenheimer Hall of Residence and Savernake, the new residence of the Vice-Chancellor (replacing Hofmeyr House on the main campus) were both established, also in Parktown. That same year, the Medical School&#x27;s new clinical departments were opened.

During the course of the 1960s, Wits acquired a limestone cave renowned for its archaeological material located at Sterkfontein. A farm next to Sterkfontein named Swartkrans rich in archaeological material was purchased in 1968, and excavation rights were obtained for archaeological and palaeontological purposes at Makapansgat, located in Limpopo Province.

The 1960s also witnessed widespread protest against apartheid policies. This resulted in numerous police invasions of campus to break up peaceful protests, as well as the banning, deportation and detention of many students and staff. Government funding for the university was cut, with funds originally meant for Wits often being channelled to the more conservative Afrikaans universities instead. Nonetheless, in the words of Clive Chipkin, the &quot;university environment was filled with deep contradictions&quot;, and the university community was by no means wholly united in opposition to apartheid. This stemmed from the Wits Council being dominated by &quot;highly conservative members representing mining and financial interests&quot;, and was compounded by the fact that the mining industry provided major financial support for the university. With a strongly entrenched &quot;[c]olonial mentality&quot; at Wits, along with &quot;high capitalism, the new liberalism and communism of a South African kind, combined with entrenched white settler mores (particularly in the Engineering and Science faculties) ... the university ... was an arena of conflicting positions generally contained within polite academic conventions&quot;.

The 1970s saw the construction of Jubilee Hall and the Wartenweiler Library, as well as the opening of the Tandem Accelerator; the first, and to date only, nuclear facility at a South African university. In 1976, Lawson&#x27;s Corner in Braamfontein was acquired and renamed University Corner. Senate House, the university&#x27;s main administrative building, was completed in 1977. The university underwent a significant expansion programme in the 1980s. The Medical School was moved to new premises on York Street in Parktown on 30 August 1982. Additionally, in 1984 the university acquired the Milner Park showgrounds from the Witwatersrand Agricultural Society. These became West Campus, with the original campus becoming East Campus. In 1984, the Chamber of Mines building opened. A large walkway named the Amic Deck was constructed across the De Villiers Graaff Motorway which bisects the campus, linking East Campus with West Campus.

The 1980s also witnessed a period of heightened opposition to apartheid, as the university struggled to maintain its autonomy in the face of attacks from the apartheid state. Wits looked anew to the &quot;Open Universities&quot; statement of 1957, to which the University of the Western Cape now also added its voice. As the apartheid government attempted, through the threat of financial sanctions, to bring Wits under firmer control, protest escalated culminating in the General Assembly of 28 October 1987, at which the university reiterated its commitment to the values underlying the &quot;Open Universities&quot; statement.

University management itself came under increasing grassroots pressure to implement change within the university. A Wits-initiated research project, &quot;Perspectives of Wits&quot; (&quot;POW&quot;), published in 1986, revealed a surprising disconnect between the perceptions disadvantaged communities had of Wits and the image Wits had been attempting to convey of itself as a progressive opponent of apartheid. &quot;POW&quot;, which had involved interviews with members of organisations among disadvantaged communities in the PWV area, international academics, students and staff at Wits, and even a meeting with the then-banned ANC in Lusaka, revealed that to many in the surrounding disadvantaged communities, there was a perception of Wits as an elitist institution dominated by white interests. A need was identified for further transformation of the university.

However, instead of translating &quot;POW&quot;&#x27;s proposals into institutional plans for transformation, Wits reacted in a defensive manner and refused to even acknowledge many of the criticisms that had been raised. Within the university community the perception was different—it was felt that Wits was on the right track. The contradiction between internal and external perceptions would increasingly undermine the unity of the university community, as progressive elements on campus began to take more radical positions in opposition to apartheid. Internal debates about, among other things, the international academic boycott of South Africa and the role of academics in the anti-apartheid struggle led to increasing division within the university. University management was increasingly seen as isolated and out of touch, and began to be referred to by the metonym &quot;the eleventh floor&quot;, referring to the eleventh floor of Senate House where top management at Wits is located.

Nonetheless, the university community in general continued to uphold its opposition to apartheid and its commitment to university autonomy and academic freedom. The remainder of the 1980s saw numerous protests on campus, which often ended with police invasions of the university. In 1990, when Nelson Mandela was released, the students of Men&#x27;s Res, on East Campus, unofficially renamed the lawn outside their residence &quot;Mandela Square&quot;.


===Post-apartheid: 1994–present===
On 25 February 2000, university management began implementing a policy called &quot;Wits 2001&quot; under which work deemed &#x27;non-core&#x27; to the functioning of the university (such as cleaning and landscaping) was outsourced to external contractors; the university&#x27;s academic departments were also restructured: the university&#x27;s nine faculties were reduced to five, the university&#x27;s 99 departments were merged into 40 schools, and courses that were deemed redundant following a mass review were cancelled. Wits management did, however, initiate programmes to ameliorate some of the negative effects of Wits 2001. These included the implementation of early retirement and voluntary severance packages to minimise retrenchments. Additionally, many of the affected employees&#x27; children were studying at Wits at the time, and received bursaries as part of their parents&#x27; employment contracts with Wits. The university therefore continued to offer bursaries to them until the completion of the degrees for which they were then enrolled, as well as offering bursaries to the children of affected employees who matriculated in 2000.

Wits 2001 attracted widespread criticism from the workers and staff affected, as well as from students and other staff. The arguments behind the restructuring were criticised as badly reasoned, and the policy itself was criticised as being regressive and neoliberal. The then-vice-chancellor, Professor Colin Bundy, said in defence of Wits 2001 that &quot;[t]his fundamental reorganisation of both academic activities and support services will equip the university for the challenges of higher education in the 21st Century&quot;. Management issued a statement on 30 May 2000 responding to criticism of Wits 2001 from the National Education, Health and Allied Workers&#x27; Union (NEHAWU), the largest trade union among Wits employees, in which it defended Wits 2001 as constituting the &quot;outsourcing [of] contracts for certain non-core functions, rather than any shift in ownership relations or governance&quot; contra NEHAWU&#x27;s claims that it constituted privatisation. Management further defended the changes as &quot;improving the financial sustainability of Wits, taking pressure off management and students, and allowing for better academic and support facilities and services&quot;. Along with &quot;Igoli 2002&quot; in Johannesburg, Wits 2001 was one of the policies implemented in the early 2000s which resulted in the formation of the Anti-Privatisation Forum (APF).

In 2001, the Johannesburg College of Education was incorporated into the university as Wits Education Campus under the national Department of Education&#x27;s plan to reform tertiary education in South Africa. In 2003, a student mall, called the Matrix, was opened in the Student Union Building on East Campus.

In 2015 to 2016, the FeesMustFall movement and protests resulted in shut downs at Wits and other leading South African universities. In March 2021, one person was killed at the Braamfontein campus after police fired rubber bullets at students protesting the university&#x27;s decision to bar students owing more than 150,000 rand from registering for the new academic year. According to the university, it is owed over a billion rand from students over the last seven years and was at risk of financial unsustainability. One of the mechanisms used by Wits management to finance this debt, has been to outsource online education to for-profit online program management (OPM) companies. Wits has entered into a few &quot;public-private&quot; partnerships to offer online programmes, in return for a cut of generated revenue. 

In 2022, Wits celebrated their centenary. As part of the centenary, Wits has also sought to address funding for the ‘missing middle&#x27;. Who are &#x27;too poor to be rich and too rich to be poor&#x27;. Wits received a large R150 million endowment from Wits alumnus Natie Kirsh, for deserving missing middle students. Student debt remains and 55 199 students (May 2024) owe Wits more than R3.5-billion in unpaid fees.

===Coat of arms===
The current coat of arms of the university was designed by Professor G. E. Pearse, and edited by Professor W. D. Howie to correct heraldic inaccuracies, before being accepted by the State Herald of South Africa in 1972. The design of the coat of arms incorporates a gold background in the upper section of the shield to represent the Witwatersrand gold fields – on which the mining industry that gave rise to the university is based – along with an open book superimposed upon a cogwheel, representing knowledge and industry. The silver wavy bars on the lower section of the shield represent the Vaal and Limpopo rivers which form the northern and southern borders of the Witwatersrand gold fields. Above the shield is the head of a Kudu, an antelope typical of the Witwatersrand and the university&#x27;s mascot. The university&#x27;s motto, &quot;Scientia et Labore&quot;, meaning &quot;Through Knowledge and Work&quot; in Latin, appears just below the shield.

The university&#x27;s coat of arms evolved from the badge of the South African School of Mines. This badge consisted of a diamond with a shield superimposed upon it. A prospector&#x27;s pick and a sledge hammer overlaid with broken ore and a mill appeared on the shield. The South African School of Mine&#x27;s motto was the same as the university&#x27;s current one, and surrounded the shield.

==Governance and administration==


As set out in the &quot;Higher Education Act&quot; (Act No. 101 of 1997) and in the Statute of the University of the Witwatersrand, the university is governed by Council. The Chancellor of the university is the ceremonial head of the university who, in the name of the university, confers all degrees. The positions of Principal and Vice-Chancellor are merged, with the Vice-Chancellor responsible for the day-to-day running of the university and accountable to Council. Council is responsible for the selection of all Vice-Chancellors, Deputy Vice-Chancellors and Deans of Faculty.

The responsibility for regulating all teaching, research and academic functions of the university falls on Senate. Additionally, the interests of the university&#x27;s students are represented by the Students&#x27; Representative Council (SRC), which also selects representatives to Senate and Council.

==Campuses==

The university is divided into five academic campuses, the main administrative campus is East Campus. Across the De Villiers Graaff Motorway lies West Campus. The two are joined by a brick-paved walkway across the highway called the Amic Deck. East and West Campus effectively form a single campus, bordered by Empire Road to the north, Jan Smuts Avenue to the east, Jorrissen Street and Enoch Sontonga Road to the south and Annet Road to the west. The historic East Campus is primarily the home of the faculties of Science and Humanities, as well as the University Council, Senate and management. West Campus houses the faculties of Engineering and the Built Environment, and Commerce, Law and Management. East Campus is home to four residences, namely Men&#x27;s Res (male), Sunnyside (female), International House (mixed) and Jubilee Hall (female). West Campus is home to David Webster Hall (female), Barnato Hall and West Campus Village (both mixed).

Wits has three more academic campuses, all located in Parktown. Wits Education Campus (WEC) houses the school of education, within the Faculty of Humanities. WEC boasts three female residences, forming the Highfield cluster, namely Girton, Medhurst and Reith Hall. East of WEC (across York Road), lies Wits Medical Campus which is the administration and academic centre of the Faculty of Health Sciences. West of WEC (across Victoria Avenue) lies the Wits Management Campus, with the Wits Business School. Within the Wits Management Campus are the Ernest Oppenheimer Hall (male residence) and the mixed Parktown Village.

There are centres that are not academic although referred to by the university as campuses. These are Graduate Lodge, Campus Lodge, South Court and Braamfontein Centre; all in the city district of Braamfontein and all mixed gender. Furthermore, there is the Wits Junction (mixed) and the Knockando Halls of Residence (a male residence located on the grounds of a Parktown mansion called &quot;Northwards&quot;) in Parktown, and the mixed Esselen Street Residence in Hillbrow.

==Sites==
===Provincial heritage sites and heritage objects===
The University of the Witwatersrand houses two provincial heritage sites and two heritage objects. The Great Hall (technically the façade of the Robert Sobukwe Building, formerly known as Central Block, in which the Great Hall is located), and the Dias Cross housed in the William Cullen Library are both provincial heritage sites. They were formerly national monuments, until 1 April 2000 when the National Monuments Council was replaced by a new system which made former national monuments the responsibility of provincial governments following the passage of the &quot;National Heritage Resources Act&quot;. The heritage objects are Jan Smuts&#x27; study, housed in Jan Smuts House, and the Paul Loewenstein Collection of rock art. All of the university&#x27;s national heritage sites and objects are located on East Campus.

===Wits Institute of Social and Economic Research (WiSER)===

The University of the Witwatersrand is home to the Wits Institute of Social and Economic Research (WiSER), founded in 2001 by Deborah Posel.

===Cradle of Humankind===

Wits acquired the Sterkfontein and Swartkrans sites in the 1960s, both of which were rich in fossil remains of early hominids. In 1999, the area was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO as the &quot;Cradle of Humankind&quot;. As a World Heritage Site, responsibility for the site shifted from the university to the government of Gauteng Province, with the provincial government becoming the designated management authority responsible for developing and protecting the site. It is aided by the South African Heritage Resources Agency, which has also declared the area a national heritage site. The university&#x27;s archaeology and palaeontology departments, within the School of Geosciences of the Faculty of Science, continue to play a leading part in excavations of the site; and Wits retains ownership of Sterkfontein&#x27;s intellectual rights. Professor Lee Berger discovered Australopithecus sediba (2010) and Homo naledi (2015) at the site.

===Museums===
The university hosts at least fourteen museums. These include the Adler Museum of Medicine, the Palaeontology Museum and the only Geology Museum in Gauteng Province. The displays include a vast spectra not limited to the Taung skull, various dinosaur fossils and butterflies.

===Rock art===
The Roberts-Pager Collection of Khoisan rock art copies is located in the Van Riet Lowe building on East Campus.

===Johannesburg Planetarium===

The Johannesburg Planetarium was the first full-sized planetarium in Africa and the second in the Southern Hemisphere. It was originally bought by the Johannesburg municipality to be set up as part of the celebration of the city&#x27;s seventieth anniversary. After acquiring an old projector from the Hamburg Planetarium, which was modernised before being shipped to South Africa, the municipality sold the projector to the university for use as both an academic facility for the instruction of students, and as a public amenity. Plans for a new building to house the projector were first drawn up in 1958, and construction began in 1959. The planetarium finally opened on 12 October 1960. The Johannesburg Planetarium is often consulted by the media, and the public, in order to explain unusual occurrences in the skies over South Africa. In 2010, the Johannesburg Planetarium celebrated its golden jubilee.

===Wits Art Museum===
The museum&#x27;s collection started in the 1950s and has since grown substantially. In 1972 the Gertrude Posel Gallery was established on the ground floor of Senate House on East Campus. It was joined in 1992 by the Studio Gallery which formed the &quot;lower gallery&quot; reserved for the display of African art. The galleries&#x27; collections grew steadily, with the Studio Gallery becoming renowned for having one of the best collections of African beadwork in the world, and by 2002 it was decided that more space was needed. Thus, the Gertrude Posel Gallery and the Studio Gallery were closed. The ground floor of University Corner was selected as the site for the new Wits Art Museum, which now houses the collections after it was completed and launched in 2012.

===Wits Theatre===

The Wits Theatre is a performing arts complex within the university, although it also caters for professional companies, dance studios and schools. It is run by the university&#x27;s Performing Arts Administration (PAA). Prior to the opening of the Wits Theatre, the Wits Schools of Dramatic Art and Music had been staging productions in a building on campus called the Nunnery, a former convent. The Nunnery has been retained as a teaching venue.

=== Wits Centre for Diversity Studies (WiCDS) ===

The Wits Centre for Diversity Studies (WiCDS) was established in 2014 at the University of Witwatersrand. It is based in the Faculty of Humanities and aims to build capacity to meet the challenges of diverse societies, especially in post-apartheid South Africa through interdisciplinary postgraduate education and research.

==Academics==

===Reputation and ranking===


In 2019 Wits was ranked 201–300 globally and 2nd nationally in the Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU), commonly known as Shanghai Ranking. In the 2019/2020 Centre for World University Rankings (CWUR) Wits is ranked 254 globally (top 1.3% in the world). In the 2019 US News Best global Universities Rankings, Wits was ranked 2nd in Africa and #197 globally with a Global score of 59.9. Wits ranked #194 globally in the 2020 Times Higher Education World University Rankings.

The University of Witwatersrand Business School was ranked 6th best among all business schools in Africa and the Middle East in the 2010 according to the QS Global 200 Business Schools Report. Additionally, the Business School&#x27;s MBA program has been ranked as the top MBA program in South Africa by the Financial Mail for the past 6 years.

==Frankenwald==


In 1905 the mining magnate Alfred Beit donated a large piece of land, Frankenwald Estate, north of Johannesburg, to the Transvaal Colony to be used for &#x27;educational purposes&#x27; – the land was transferred to Wits in 1922 by an Act of Parliament. According to the Mail &amp; Guardian the university entered into an agreement in 2001 with a private developer, , to build a shopping centre, offices, light industry and medium and high-density housing on the property.

==Student demographics==
Like other South African universities, the University of Witwatersrand promotes diversity in order to address the widespread inequality and injustice caused by apartheid across South Africa. For this reason, the university&#x27;s admission policies promote diversity and Black Economic Empowerment by admitting students from a wide range of backgrounds. These policies enable the university to assemble a diverse student body that reflects the demographic profile of South Africa&#x27;s Gauteng region across a wide array of traits, including race, gender, socio-economic background, urban and rural geographic origin, culture, ethnicity, disability, religion, sexual orientation, national origin, and other traits.

===Gender composition===

<text>In algebraic geometry, an affine algebraic set is the set of the common zeros over an algebraically closed field of some family of polynomials in the polynomial ring formula_1 An affine variety or affine algebraic variety, is an affine algebraic set such that the ideal generated by the defining polynomials is prime.

Some texts use the term &quot;variety&quot; for any algebraic set, and &quot;irreducible variety&quot; an algebraic set whose defining ideal is prime (affine variety in the above sense).

In some contexts (see, for example, Hilbert&#x27;s Nullstellensatz), it is useful to distinguish the field in which the coefficients are considered, from the algebraically closed field (containing ) over which the common zeros are considered (that is, the points of the affine algebraic set are in ). In this case, the variety is said &quot;defined over&quot; , and the points of the variety that belong to are said &quot;-rational&quot; or &quot;rational over&quot; . In the common case where is the field of real numbers, a -rational point is called a &quot;real point&quot;. When the field is not specified, a &quot;rational point&quot; is a point that is rational over the rational numbers. For example, Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem asserts that the affine algebraic variety (it is a curve) defined by has no rational points for any integer greater than two.

== Introduction ==
An affine algebraic set is the set of solutions in an algebraically closed field of a system of polynomial equations with coefficients in . More precisely, if formula_2 are polynomials with coefficients in , they define an affine algebraic set 
:formula_3
An affine (algebraic) variety is an affine algebraic set that is not the union of two proper affine algebraic subsets. Such an affine algebraic set is often said to be &quot;irreducible&quot;. 

If is an affine algebraic set, and is the ideal of all polynomials that are zero on , then the quotient ring formula_4 is called the of &quot;X&quot;. If &quot;X&quot; is an affine variety, then &quot;I&quot; is prime, so the coordinate ring is an integral domain. The elements of the coordinate ring &quot;R&quot; are also called the &quot;regular functions&quot; or the &quot;polynomial functions&quot; on the variety. They form the &quot;ring of regular functions&quot; on the variety, or, simply, the &quot;ring of the variety&quot;; in other words (see #Structure sheaf), it is the space of global sections of the structure sheaf of &quot;X&quot;.

The dimension of a variety is an integer associated to every variety, and even to every algebraic set, whose importance relies on the large number of its equivalent definitions (see Dimension of an algebraic variety).

== Examples ==
* The complement of a hypersurface in an affine variety (that is for some polynomial ) is affine. Its defining equations are obtained by saturating by the defining ideal of . The coordinate ring is thus the localization formula_5. 
* In particular, formula_6 (the affine line with the origin removed) is affine.
* On the other hand, formula_7 (the affine plane with the origin removed) is not an affine variety; cf. Hartogs&#x27; extension theorem.
* The subvarieties of codimension one in the affine space formula_8 are exactly the hypersurfaces, that is the varieties defined by a single polynomial.
* The normalization of an irreducible affine variety is affine; the coordinate ring of the normalization is the integral closure of the coordinate ring of the variety. (Similarly, the normalization of a projective variety is a projective variety.)

== Rational points ==

For an affine variety formula_9 over an algebraically closed field , and a subfield of , a -&quot;rational point&quot; of is a point formula_10 That is, a point of whose coordinates are elements of . The collection of -rational points of an affine variety is often denoted formula_11 Often, if the base field is the complex numbers , points that are -rational (where is the real numbers) are called &quot;real points&quot; of the variety, and -rational points ( the rational numbers) are often simply called &quot;rational points&quot;.

For instance, is a -rational and an -rational point of the variety formula_12 as it is in and all its coordinates are integers. The point is a real point of that is not -rational, and formula_13 is a point of that is not -rational. This variety is called a circle, because the set of its -rational points is the unit circle. It has infinitely many -rational points that are the points 
:formula_14
where is a rational number.

The circle formula_15 is an example of an algebraic curve of degree two that has no -rational point. This can be deduced from the fact that, modulo , the sum of two squares cannot be .

It can be proved that an algebraic curve of degree two with a -rational point has infinitely many other -rational points; each such point is the second intersection point of the curve and a line with a rational slope passing through the rational point.

The complex variety formula_16 has no -rational points, but has many complex points.

If is an affine variety in defined over the complex numbers , the -rational points of can be drawn on a piece of paper or by graphing software. The figure on the right shows the -rational points of formula_17

==Singular points and tangent space==
Let be an affine variety defined by the polynomials formula_18 and formula_19 be a point of .

The Jacobian matrix of at is the matrix of the partial derivatives 
:formula_20

The point is &quot;regular&quot; if the rank of equals the codimension of , and &quot;singular&quot; otherwise.

If is regular, the tangent space to at is the affine subspace of formula_8 defined by the linear equations
:formula_22

If the point is singular, the affine subspace defined by these equations is also called a tangent space by some authors, while other authors say that there is no tangent space at a singular point.
A more intrinsic definition, which does not use coordinates is given by Zariski tangent space.

== The Zariski topology ==

The affine algebraic sets of &quot;k&quot;&quot;n&quot; form the closed sets of a topology on &quot;k&quot;&quot;n&quot;, called the Zariski topology. This follows from the fact that formula_23 formula_24 formula_25 and formula_26 (in fact, a countable intersection of affine algebraic sets is an affine algebraic set).

The Zariski topology can also be described by way of basic open sets, where Zariski-open sets are countable unions of sets of the form formula_27 for formula_28 These basic open sets are the complements in &quot;k&quot;&quot;n&quot; of the closed sets formula_29 zero loci of a single polynomial. If &quot;k&quot; is Noetherian (for instance, if &quot;k&quot; is a field or a principal ideal domain), then every ideal of &quot;k&quot; is finitely-generated, so every open set is a finite union of basic open sets.

If &quot;V&quot; is an affine subvariety of &quot;k&quot;&quot;n&quot; the Zariski topology on &quot;V&quot; is simply the subspace topology inherited from the Zariski topology on &quot;k&quot;&quot;n&quot;.

== Geometry–algebra correspondence ==
The geometric structure of an affine variety is linked in a deep way to the algebraic structure of its coordinate ring. Let &quot;I&quot; and &quot;J&quot; be ideals of &quot;k[V]&quot;, the coordinate ring of an affine variety &quot;V&quot;. Let &quot;I(V)&quot; be the set of all polynomials in formula_30 that vanish on &quot;V&quot;, and let formula_31 denote the radical of the ideal &quot;I&quot;, the set of polynomials &quot;f&quot; for which some power of &quot;f&quot; is in &quot;I&quot;. The reason that the base field is required to be algebraically closed is that affine varieties automatically satisfy Hilbert&#x27;s nullstellensatz: for an ideal &quot;J&quot; in formula_30 where &quot;k&quot; is an algebraically closed field, formula_33

Radical ideals (ideals that are their own radical) of &quot;k[V]&quot; correspond to algebraic subsets of &quot;V&quot;. Indeed, for radical ideals &quot;I&quot; and &quot;J&quot;, formula_34 if and only if formula_35 Hence &quot;V(I)=V(J)&quot; if and only if &quot;I=J&quot;. Furthermore, the function taking an affine algebraic set &quot;W&quot; and returning &quot;I(W)&quot;, the set of all functions that also vanish on all points of &quot;W&quot;, is the inverse of the function assigning an algebraic set to a radical ideal, by the nullstellensatz. Hence the correspondence between affine algebraic sets and radical ideals is a bijection. The coordinate ring of an affine algebraic set is reduced (nilpotent-free), as an ideal &quot;I&quot; in a ring &quot;R&quot; is radical if and only if the quotient ring &quot;R/I&quot; is reduced.

Prime ideals of the coordinate ring correspond to affine subvarieties. An affine algebraic set &quot;V(I)&quot; can be written as the union of two other algebraic sets if and only if &quot;I=JK&quot; for proper ideals &quot;J&quot; and &quot;K&quot; not equal to &quot;I&quot; (in which case formula_36). This is the case if and only if &quot;I&quot; is not prime. Affine subvarieties are precisely those whose coordinate ring is an integral domain. This is because an ideal is prime if and only if the quotient of the ring by the ideal is an integral domain.

Maximal ideals of &quot;k[V]&quot; correspond to points of &quot;V&quot;. If &quot;I&quot; and &quot;J&quot; are radical ideals, then formula_37 if and only if formula_38 As maximal ideals are radical, maximal ideals correspond to minimal algebraic sets (those that contain no proper algebraic subsets), which are points in &quot;V&quot;. If &quot;V&quot; is an affine variety with coordinate ring formula_39 this correspondence becomes explicit through the map formula_40 where formula_41 denotes the image in the quotient algebra &quot;R&quot; of the polynomial formula_42 An algebraic subset is a point if and only if the coordinate ring of the subset is a field, as the quotient of a ring by a maximal ideal is a field.

The following table summarises this correspondence, for algebraic subsets of an affine variety and ideals of the corresponding coordinate ring:
==Products of affine varieties==
A product of affine varieties can be defined using the isomorphism then embedding the product in this new affine space. Let and have coordinate rings and respectively, so that their product has coordinate ring . Let be an algebraic subset of and an algebraic subset of Then each is a polynomial in , and each is in . The product of and is defined as the algebraic set in The product is irreducible if each , is irreducible.

The Zariski topology on is not the topological product of the Zariski topologies on the two spaces. Indeed, the product topology is generated by products of the basic open sets and Hence, polynomials that are in but cannot be obtained as a product of a polynomial in with a polynomial in will define algebraic sets that are in the Zariski topology on but not in the product topology.

== Morphisms of affine varieties ==
A morphism, or regular map, of affine varieties is a function between affine varieties that is polynomial in each coordinate: more precisely, for affine varieties and , a morphism from to is a map of the form where for each These are the morphisms in the category of affine varieties.

There is a one-to-one correspondence between morphisms of affine varieties over an algebraically closed field and homomorphisms of coordinate rings of affine varieties over going in the opposite direction. Because of this, along with the fact that there is a one-to-one correspondence between affine varieties over and their coordinate rings, the category of affine varieties over is dual to the category of coordinate rings of affine varieties over The category of coordinate rings of affine varieties over is precisely the category of finitely-generated, nilpotent-free algebras over 

More precisely, for each morphism of affine varieties, there is a homomorphism between the coordinate rings (going in the opposite direction), and for each such homomorphism, there is a morphism of the varieties associated to the coordinate rings. This can be shown explicitly: let and be affine varieties with coordinate rings and respectively. Let be a morphism. Indeed, a homomorphism between polynomial rings factors uniquely through the ring and a homomorphism is determined uniquely by the images of Hence, each homomorphism corresponds uniquely to a choice of image for each . Then given any morphism from to a homomorphism can be constructed that sends to formula_43 where formula_44 is the equivalence class of in 

Similarly, for each homomorphism of the coordinate rings, a morphism of the affine varieties can be constructed in the opposite direction. Mirroring the paragraph above, a homomorphism sends to a polynomial formula_45 in . This corresponds to the morphism of varieties defined by 

== Structure sheaf ==
Equipped with the structure sheaf described below, an affine variety is a locally ringed space.

Given an affine variety &quot;X&quot; with coordinate ring &quot;A&quot;, the sheaf of &quot;k&quot;-algebras formula_46 is defined by letting formula_47 be the ring of regular functions on &quot;U&quot;.

Let &quot;D&quot;(&quot;f&quot;) = { &quot;x&quot; | &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) ≠ 0 } for each &quot;f&quot; in &quot;A&quot;. They form a base for the topology of &quot;X&quot; and so formula_46 is determined by its values on the open sets &quot;D&quot;(&quot;f&quot;). (See also: sheaf of modules#Sheaf associated to a module.)

The key fact, which relies on Hilbert nullstellensatz in the essential way, is the following:

Proof: The inclusion ⊃ is clear. For the opposite, let &quot;g&quot; be in the left-hand side and formula_49, which is an ideal. If &quot;x&quot; is in &quot;D&quot;(&quot;f&quot;), then, since &quot;g&quot; is regular near &quot;x&quot;, there is some open affine neighborhood &quot;D&quot;(&quot;h&quot;) of &quot;x&quot; such that formula_50; that is, &quot;h&quot;&quot;m&quot; &quot;g&quot; is in &quot;A&quot; and thus &quot;x&quot; is not in &quot;V&quot;(&quot;J&quot;). In other words, formula_51 and thus the Hilbert nullstellensatz implies &quot;f&quot; is in the radical of &quot;J&quot;; i.e., formula_52. formula_53

The claim, first of all, implies that &quot;X&quot; is a &quot;locally ringed&quot; space since
:formula_54
where formula_55. Secondly, the claim implies that formula_46 is a sheaf; indeed, it says if a function is regular (pointwise) on &quot;D&quot;(&quot;f&quot;), then it must be in the coordinate ring of &quot;D&quot;(&quot;f&quot;); that is, &quot;regular-ness&quot; can be patched together.

Hence, formula_57 is a locally ringed space.

== Serre&#x27;s theorem on affineness ==

A theorem of Serre gives a cohomological characterization of an affine variety; it says an algebraic variety is affine if and only if formula_58 for any formula_59 and any quasi-coherent sheaf &quot;F&quot; on &quot;X&quot;. (cf. Cartan&#x27;s theorem B.) This makes the cohomological study of an affine variety non-existent, in a sharp contrast to the projective case in which cohomology groups of line bundles are of central interest.

==Affine algebraic groups==

An affine variety over an algebraically closed field is called an affine algebraic group if it has:
* A &quot;multiplication&quot; , which is a regular morphism that follows the associativity axiom—that is, such that for all points , and in 
* An &quot;identity element&quot; such that for every in 
* An &quot;inverse morphism&quot;, a regular bijection such that for every in 

Together, these define a group structure on the variety. The above morphisms are often written using ordinary group notation: can be written as , or ; the inverse can be written as or Using the multiplicative notation, the associativity, identity and inverse laws can be rewritten as: , and .

The most prominent example of an affine algebraic group is the general linear group of degree This is the group of linear transformations of the vector space if a basis of is fixed, this is equivalent to the group of invertible matrices with entries in It can be shown that any affine algebraic group is isomorphic to a subgroup of . For this reason, affine algebraic groups are often called linear algebraic groups. 

Affine algebraic groups play an important role in the classification of finite simple groups, as the groups of Lie type are all sets of -rational points of an affine algebraic group, where is a finite field.

== Generalizations ==
* If an author requires the base field of an affine variety to be algebraically closed (as this article does), then irreducible affine algebraic sets over non-algebraically closed fields are a generalization of affine varieties. This generalization notably includes affine varieties over the real numbers.

* An affine variety plays a role of a local chart for algebraic varieties; that is to say, general algebraic varieties such as projective varieties are obtained by gluing affine varieties. Linear structures that are attached to varieties are also (trivially) affine varieties; e.g., tangent spaces, fibers of algebraic vector bundles.

* An affine variety is a special case of an affine scheme, a locally-ringed space that is isomorphic to the spectrum of a commutative ring (up to an equivalence of categories). Each affine variety has an affine scheme associated to it: if is an affine variety in with coordinate ring then the scheme corresponding to is the set of prime ideals of The affine scheme has &quot;classical points&quot;, which correspond with points of the variety (and hence maximal ideals of the coordinate ring of the variety), and also a point for each closed subvariety of the variety (these points correspond to prime, non-maximal ideals of the coordinate ring). This creates a more well-defined notion of the &quot;generic point&quot; of an affine variety, by assigning to each closed subvariety an open point that is dense in the subvariety. More generally, an affine scheme is an affine variety if it is reduced, irreducible, and of finite type over an algebraically closed field

<text>In algebraic geometry, a projective variety is an algebraic variety that is a closed subvariety of a projective space. That is, it is the zero-locus in formula_1 of some finite family of homogeneous polynomials that generate a prime ideal, the defining ideal of the variety.

A projective variety is a projective curve if its dimension is one; it is a projective surface if its dimension is two; it is a projective hypersurface if its dimension is one less than the dimension of the containing projective space; in this case it is the set of zeros of a single homogeneous polynomial.

If &quot;X&quot; is a projective variety defined by a homogeneous prime ideal &quot;I&quot;, then the quotient ring

:formula_2

is called the homogeneous coordinate ring of &quot;X&quot;. Basic invariants of &quot;X&quot; such as the degree and the dimension can be read off the Hilbert polynomial of this graded ring.

Projective varieties arise in many ways. They are complete, which roughly can be expressed by saying that there are no points &quot;missing&quot;. The converse is not true in general, but Chow&#x27;s lemma describes the close relation of these two notions. Showing that a variety is projective is done by studying line bundles or divisors on &quot;X&quot;.

A salient feature of projective varieties are the finiteness constraints on sheaf cohomology. For smooth projective varieties, Serre duality can be viewed as an analog of Poincaré duality. It also leads to the Riemann–Roch theorem for projective curves, i.e., projective varieties of dimension 1. The theory of projective curves is particularly rich, including a classification by the genus of the curve. The classification program for higher-dimensional projective varieties naturally leads to the construction of moduli of projective varieties. Hilbert schemes parametrize closed subschemes of formula_1 with prescribed Hilbert polynomial. Hilbert schemes, of which Grassmannians are special cases, are also projective schemes in their own right. Geometric invariant theory offers another approach. The classical approaches include the Teichmüller space and Chow varieties.

A particularly rich theory, reaching back to the classics, is available for complex projective varieties, i.e., when the polynomials defining &quot;X&quot; have complex coefficients. Broadly, the GAGA principle says that the geometry of projective complex analytic spaces (or manifolds) is equivalent to the geometry of projective complex varieties. For example, the theory of holomorphic vector bundles (more generally coherent analytic sheaves) on &quot;X&quot; coincide with that of algebraic vector bundles. Chow&#x27;s theorem says that a subset of projective space is the zero-locus of a family of holomorphic functions if and only if it is the zero-locus of homogeneous polynomials. The combination of analytic and algebraic methods for complex projective varieties lead to areas such as Hodge theory.

== Variety and scheme structure ==

=== Variety structure ===
Let &quot;k&quot; be an algebraically closed field. The basis of the definition of projective varieties is projective space formula_1, which can be defined in different, but equivalent ways:

* as the set of all lines through the origin in formula_5 (i.e., all one-dimensional vector subspaces of formula_5)
* as the set of tuples formula_7, with formula_8 not all zero, modulo the equivalence relation formula_9 for any formula_10. The equivalence class of such a tuple is denoted by formula_11 This equivalence class is the general point of projective space. The numbers formula_8 are referred to as the homogeneous coordinates of the point.

A &quot;projective variety&quot; is, by definition, a closed subvariety of formula_1, where closed refers to the Zariski topology. In general, closed subsets of the Zariski topology are defined to be the common zero-locus of a finite collection of homogeneous polynomial functions. Given a polynomial formula_14, the condition

:formula_15

does not make sense for arbitrary polynomials, but only if &quot;f&quot; is homogeneous, i.e., the degrees of all the monomials (whose sum is &quot;f&quot;) are the same. In this case, the vanishing of

:formula_16

is independent of the choice of formula_17.

Therefore, projective varieties arise from homogeneous prime ideals &quot;I&quot; of formula_18, and setting

:formula_19

Moreover, the projective variety &quot;X&quot; is an algebraic variety, meaning that it is covered by open affine subvarieties and satisfies the separation axiom. Thus, the local study of &quot;X&quot; (e.g., singularity) reduces to that of an affine variety. The explicit structure is as follows. The projective space formula_1 is covered by the standard open affine charts

:formula_21

which themselves are affine &quot;n&quot;-spaces with the coordinate ring

:formula_22

Say &quot;i&quot; = 0 for the notational simplicity and drop the superscript (0). Then formula_23 is a closed subvariety of formula_24 defined by the ideal of formula_25 generated by

:formula_26

for all &quot;f&quot; in &quot;I&quot;. Thus, &quot;X&quot; is an algebraic variety covered by (&quot;n&quot;+1) open affine charts formula_27.

Note that &quot;X&quot; is the closure of the affine variety formula_23 in formula_1. Conversely, starting from some closed (affine) variety formula_30, the closure of &quot;V&quot; in formula_1 is the projective variety called the of &quot;V&quot;. If formula_32 defines &quot;V&quot;, then the defining ideal of this closure is the homogeneous ideal of formula_18 generated by

:formula_34

for all &quot;f&quot; in &quot;I&quot;.

For example, if &quot;V&quot; is an affine curve given by, say, formula_35 in the affine plane, then its projective completion in the projective plane is given by formula_36

=== Projective schemes ===
For various applications, it is necessary to consider more general algebro-geometric objects than projective varieties, namely projective schemes. The first step towards projective schemes is to endow projective space with a scheme structure, in a way refining the above description of projective space as an algebraic variety, i.e., formula_37 is a scheme which it is a union of (&quot;n&quot; + 1) copies of the affine &quot;n&quot;-space &quot;kn&quot;. More generally, projective space over a ring &quot;A&quot; is the union of the affine schemes

:formula_38

in such a way the variables match up as expected. The set of closed points of formula_39, for algebraically closed fields &quot;k&quot;, is then the projective space formula_37 in the usual sense.

An equivalent but streamlined construction is given by the Proj construction, which is an analog of the spectrum of a ring, denoted &quot;Spec&quot;, which defines an affine scheme. For example, if &quot;A&quot; is a ring, then

:formula_41

If &quot;R&quot; is a quotient of formula_42 by a homogeneous ideal &quot;I&quot;, then the canonical surjection induces the closed immersion

:formula_43

Compared to projective varieties, the condition that the ideal &quot;I&quot; be a prime ideal was dropped. This leads to a much more flexible notion: on the one hand the topological space formula_44 may have multiple irreducible components. Moreover, there may be nilpotent functions on &quot;X&quot;.

Closed subschemes of formula_39 correspond bijectively to the homogeneous ideals &quot;I&quot; of formula_42 that are saturated; i.e., formula_47 This fact may be considered as a refined version of projective Nullstellensatz.

We can give a coordinate-free analog of the above. Namely, given a finite-dimensional vector space &quot;V&quot; over &quot;k&quot;, we let

:formula_48

where formula_49 is the symmetric algebra of formula_50. It is the projectivization of &quot;V&quot;; i.e., it parametrizes lines in &quot;V&quot;. There is a canonical surjective map formula_51, which is defined using the chart described above. One important use of the construction is this (cf., ). A divisor &quot;D&quot; on a projective variety &quot;X&quot; corresponds to a line bundle &quot;L&quot;. One then set

:formula_52;

it is called the complete linear system of &quot;D&quot;.

Projective space over any scheme &quot;S&quot; can be defined as a fiber product of schemes

:formula_53

If formula_54 is the twisting sheaf of Serre on formula_55, we let formula_56 denote the pullback of formula_54 to formula_58; that is, formula_59 for the canonical map formula_60

A scheme &quot;X&quot; → &quot;S&quot; is called projective over &quot;S&quot; if it factors as a closed immersion

:formula_61

followed by the projection to &quot;S&quot;.

A line bundle (or invertible sheaf) formula_62 on a scheme &quot;X&quot; over &quot;S&quot; is said to be very ample relative to &quot;S&quot; if there is an immersion (i.e., an open immersion followed by a closed immersion)

:formula_63

for some &quot;n&quot; so that formula_54 pullbacks to formula_62. Then a &quot;S&quot;-scheme &quot;X&quot; is projective if and only if it is proper and there exists a very ample sheaf on &quot;X&quot; relative to &quot;S&quot;. Indeed, if &quot;X&quot; is proper, then an immersion corresponding to the very ample line bundle is necessarily closed. Conversely, if &quot;X&quot; is projective, then the pullback of formula_54 under the closed immersion of &quot;X&quot; into a projective space is very ample. That &quot;projective&quot; implies &quot;proper&quot; is deeper: the &quot;main theorem of elimination theory&quot;.

== Relation to complete varieties ==

By definition, a variety is complete, if it is proper over &quot;k&quot;. The valuative criterion of properness expresses the intuition that in a proper variety, there are no points &quot;missing&quot;.

There is a close relation between complete and projective varieties: on the one hand, projective space and therefore any projective variety is complete. The converse is not true in general. However:

*A smooth curve &quot;C&quot; is projective if and only if it is complete. This is proved by identifying &quot;C&quot; with the set of discrete valuation rings of the function field &quot;k&quot;(&quot;C&quot;) over &quot;k&quot;. This set has a natural Zariski topology called the Zariski–Riemann space.
* Chow&#x27;s lemma states that for any complete variety &quot;X&quot;, there is a projective variety &quot;Z&quot; and a birational morphism &quot;Z&quot; → &quot;X&quot;. (Moreover, through normalization, one can assume this projective variety is normal.)

Some properties of a projective variety follow from completeness. For example,

:formula_67

for any projective variety &quot;X&quot; over &quot;k&quot;. This fact is an algebraic analogue of Liouville&#x27;s theorem (any holomorphic function on a connected compact complex manifold is constant). In fact, the similarity between complex analytic geometry and algebraic geometry on complex projective varieties goes much further than this, as is explained below.

Quasi-projective varieties are, by definition, those which are open subvarieties of projective varieties. This class of varieties includes affine varieties. Affine varieties are almost never complete (or projective). In fact, a projective subvariety of an affine variety must have dimension zero. This is because only the constants are globally regular functions on a projective variety.

== Examples and basic invariants ==

By definition, any homogeneous ideal in a polynomial ring yields a projective scheme (required to be prime ideal to give a variety). In this sense, examples of projective varieties abound. The following list mentions various classes of projective varieties which are noteworthy since they have been studied particularly intensely. The important class of complex projective varieties, i.e., the case formula_68, is discussed further below.

The product of two projective spaces is projective. In fact, there is the explicit immersion (called Segre embedding)

:formula_69

As a consequence, the product of projective varieties over &quot;k&quot; is again projective. The Plücker embedding exhibits a Grassmannian as a projective variety. Flag varieties such as the quotient of the general linear group formula_70 modulo the subgroup of upper triangular matrices, are also projective, which is an important fact in the theory of algebraic groups.

=== Homogeneous coordinate ring and Hilbert polynomial ===

As the prime ideal &quot;P&quot; defining a projective variety &quot;X&quot; is homogeneous, the homogeneous coordinate ring

:formula_71

is a graded ring, i.e., can be expressed as the direct sum of its graded components:

:formula_72

There exists a polynomial &quot;P&quot; such that formula_73 for all sufficiently large &quot;n&quot;; it is called the Hilbert polynomial of &quot;X&quot;. It is a numerical invariant encoding some extrinsic geometry of &quot;X&quot;. The degree of &quot;P&quot; is the dimension &quot;r&quot; of &quot;X&quot; and its leading coefficient times r! is the degree of the variety &quot;X&quot;. The arithmetic genus of &quot;X&quot; is (−1)&quot;r&quot; (&quot;P&quot;(0) − 1) when &quot;X&quot; is smooth.

For example, the homogeneous coordinate ring of formula_1 is formula_42 and its Hilbert polynomial is formula_76; its arithmetic genus is zero.

If the homogeneous coordinate ring &quot;R&quot; is an integrally closed domain, then the projective variety &quot;X&quot; is said to be projectively normal. Note, unlike normality, projective normality depends on &quot;R&quot;, the embedding of &quot;X&quot; into a projective space. The normalization of a projective variety is projective; in fact, it&#x27;s the Proj of the integral closure of some homogeneous coordinate ring of &quot;X&quot;.

=== Degree ===

Let formula_77 be a projective variety. There are at least two equivalent ways to define the degree of &quot;X&quot; relative to its embedding. The first way is to define it as the cardinality of the finite set

:formula_78

where &quot;d&quot; is the dimension of &quot;X&quot; and &quot;H&quot;&quot;i&quot;&#x27;s are hyperplanes in &quot;general positions&quot;. This definition corresponds to an intuitive idea of a degree. Indeed, if &quot;X&quot; is a hypersurface, then the degree of &quot;X&quot; is the degree of the homogeneous polynomial defining &quot;X&quot;. The &quot;general positions&quot; can be made precise, for example, by intersection theory; one requires that the intersection is proper and that the multiplicities of irreducible components are all one.

The other definition, which is mentioned in the previous section, is that the degree of &quot;X&quot; is the leading coefficient of the Hilbert polynomial of &quot;X&quot; times (dim &quot;X&quot;)!. Geometrically, this definition means that the degree of &quot;X&quot; is the multiplicity of the vertex of the affine cone over &quot;X&quot;.

Let formula_79 be closed subschemes of pure dimensions that intersect properly (they are in general position). If &quot;mi&quot; denotes the multiplicity of an irreducible component &quot;Zi&quot; in the intersection (i.e., intersection multiplicity), then the generalization of Bézout&#x27;s theorem says:

:formula_80

The intersection multiplicity &quot;mi&quot; can be defined as the coefficient of &quot;Zi&quot; in the intersection product formula_81 in the Chow ring of formula_82.

In particular, if formula_83 is a hypersurface not containing &quot;X&quot;, then

:formula_84

where &quot;Zi&quot; are the irreducible components of the scheme-theoretic intersection of &quot;X&quot; and &quot;H&quot; with multiplicity (length of the local ring) &quot;mi&quot;.

A complex projective variety can be viewed as a compact complex manifold; the degree of the variety (relative to the embedding) is then the volume of the variety as a manifold with respect to the metric inherited from the ambient complex projective space. A complex projective variety can be characterized as a minimizer of the volume (in a sense).

=== The ring of sections ===
Let &quot;X&quot; be a projective variety and &quot;L&quot; a line bundle on it. Then the graded ring

:formula_85

is called the ring of sections of &quot;L&quot;. If &quot;L&quot; is ample, then Proj of this ring is &quot;X&quot;. Moreover, if &quot;X&quot; is normal and &quot;L&quot; is very ample, then formula_86 is the integral closure of the homogeneous coordinate ring of &quot;X&quot; determined by &quot;L&quot;; i.e., formula_87 so that formula_88 pulls-back to &quot;L&quot;.

For applications, it is useful to allow for divisors (or formula_89-divisors) not just line bundles; assuming &quot;X&quot; is normal, the resulting ring is then called a generalized ring of sections. If formula_90 is a canonical divisor on &quot;X&quot;, then the generalized ring of sections

:formula_91

is called the canonical ring of &quot;X&quot;. If the canonical ring is finitely generated, then Proj of the ring is called the canonical model of &quot;X&quot;. The canonical ring or model can then be used to define the Kodaira dimension of &quot;X&quot;.

=== Projective curves ===

Projective schemes of dimension one are called &quot;projective curves&quot;. Much of the theory of projective curves is about smooth projective curves, since the singularities of curves can be resolved by normalization, which consists in taking locally the integral closure of the ring of regular functions. Smooth projective curves are isomorphic if and only if their function fields are isomorphic. The study of finite extensions of

:formula_92

or equivalently smooth projective curves over formula_93 is an important branch in algebraic number theory.

A smooth projective curve of genus one is called an elliptic curve. As a consequence of the Riemann–Roch theorem, such a curve can be embedded as a closed subvariety in formula_94. In general, any (smooth) projective curve can be embedded in formula_95 (for a proof, see Secant variety#Examples). Conversely, any smooth closed curve in formula_94 of degree three has genus one by the genus formula and is thus an elliptic curve.

A smooth complete curve of genus greater than or equal to two is called a hyperelliptic curve if there is a finite morphism formula_97 of degree two.

=== Projective hypersurfaces ===

Every irreducible closed subset of formula_1 of codimension one is a hypersurface; i.e., the zero set of some homogeneous irreducible polynomial.

=== Abelian varieties ===
Another important invariant of a projective variety &quot;X&quot; is the Picard group formula_99 of &quot;X&quot;, the set of isomorphism classes of line bundles on &quot;X&quot;. It is isomorphic to formula_100 and therefore an intrinsic notion (independent of embedding). For example, the Picard group of formula_1 is isomorphic to formula_102 via the degree map. The kernel of formula_103 is not only an abstract abelian group, but there is a variety called the Jacobian variety of &quot;X&quot;, Jac(&quot;X&quot;), whose points equal this group. The Jacobian of a (smooth) curve plays an important role in the study of the curve. For example, the Jacobian of an elliptic curve &quot;E&quot; is &quot;E&quot; itself. For a curve &quot;X&quot; of genus &quot;g&quot;, Jac(&quot;X&quot;) has dimension &quot;g&quot;.

Varieties, such as the Jacobian variety, which are complete and have a group structure are known as abelian varieties, in honor of Niels Abel. In marked contrast to affine algebraic groups such as formula_104, such groups are always commutative, whence the name. Moreover, they admit an ample line bundle and are thus projective. On the other hand, an abelian scheme may not be projective. Examples of abelian varieties are elliptic curves, Jacobian varieties and K3 surfaces.

== Projections ==
Let formula_105 be a linear subspace; i.e., formula_106 for some linearly independent linear functionals &quot;si&quot;. Then the projection from &quot;E&quot; is the (well-defined) morphism

:formula_107

The geometric description of this map is as follows:

*We view formula_108 so that it is disjoint from &quot;E&quot;. Then, for any formula_109, formula_110 where formula_111 denotes the smallest linear space containing &quot;E&quot; and &quot;x&quot; (called the join of &quot;E&quot; and &quot;x&quot;.)
*formula_112 where formula_113 are the homogeneous coordinates on formula_114
*For any closed subscheme formula_115 disjoint from &quot;E&quot;, the restriction formula_116 is a finite morphism.

Projections can be used to cut down the dimension in which a projective variety is embedded, up to finite morphisms. Start with some projective variety formula_117 If formula_118 the projection from a point not on &quot;X&quot; gives formula_119 Moreover, formula_120 is a finite map to its image. Thus, iterating the procedure, one sees there is a finite map

:formula_121

This result is the projective analog of Noether&#x27;s normalization lemma. (In fact, it yields a geometric proof of the normalization lemma.)

The same procedure can be used to show the following slightly more precise result: given a projective variety &quot;X&quot; over a perfect field, there is a finite birational morphism from &quot;X&quot; to a hypersurface &quot;H&quot; in formula_122 In particular, if &quot;X&quot; is normal, then it is the normalization of &quot;H&quot;.

== Duality and linear system ==
While a projective &quot;n&quot;-space formula_1 parameterizes the lines in an affine &quot;n&quot;-space, the dual of it parametrizes the hyperplanes on the projective space, as follows. Fix a field &quot;k&quot;. By formula_124, we mean a projective &quot;n&quot;-space
:formula_125
equipped with the construction:
:formula_126, a hyperplane on formula_127
where formula_128 is an &quot;L&quot;-point of formula_124 for a field extension &quot;L&quot; of &quot;k&quot; and formula_130

For each &quot;L&quot;, the construction is a bijection between the set of &quot;L&quot;-points of formula_124 and the set of hyperplanes on formula_127. Because of this, the dual projective space formula_124 is said to be the moduli space of hyperplanes on formula_39.

A line in formula_124 is called a pencil: it is a family of hyperplanes on formula_39 parametrized by formula_137.

If &quot;V&quot; is a finite-dimensional vector space over &quot;k&quot;, then, for the same reason as above, formula_138 is the space of hyperplanes on formula_139. An important case is when &quot;V&quot; consists of sections of a line bundle. Namely, let &quot;X&quot; be an algebraic variety, &quot;L&quot; a line bundle on &quot;X&quot; and formula_140 a vector subspace of finite positive dimension. Then there is a map:

:formula_141

determined by the linear system &quot;V&quot;, where &quot;B&quot;, called the base locus, is the intersection of the divisors of zero of nonzero sections in &quot;V&quot; (see Linear system of divisors#A map determined by a linear system for the construction of the map).

== Cohomology of coherent sheaves ==

Let &quot;X&quot; be a projective scheme over a field (or, more generally over a Noetherian ring &quot;A&quot;). Cohomology of coherent sheaves formula_142 on &quot;X&quot; satisfies the following important theorems due to Serre:

#formula_143 is a finite-dimensional &quot;k&quot;-vector space for any &quot;p&quot;.
#There exists an integer formula_144 (depending on formula_145; see also Castelnuovo–Mumford regularity) such that formula_146 for all formula_147 and &quot;p&quot; &gt; 0, where formula_148 is the twisting with a power of a very ample line bundle formula_149

These results are proven reducing to the case formula_150 using the isomorphism

:formula_151

where in the right-hand side formula_145 is viewed as a sheaf on the projective space by extension by zero. The result then follows by a direct computation for formula_153 &quot;n&quot; any integer, and for arbitrary formula_142 reduces to this case without much difficulty.

As a corollary to 1. above, if &quot;f&quot; is a projective morphism from a noetherian scheme to a noetherian ring, then the higher direct image formula_155 is coherent. The same result holds for proper morphisms &quot;f&quot;, as can be shown with the aid of Chow&#x27;s lemma.

Sheaf cohomology groups &quot;Hi&quot; on a noetherian topological space vanish for &quot;i&quot; strictly greater than the dimension of the space. Thus the quantity, called the Euler characteristic of formula_145,

:formula_157

is a well-defined integer (for &quot;X&quot; projective). One can then show formula_158 for some polynomial &quot;P&quot; over rational numbers. Applying this procedure to the structure sheaf formula_159, one recovers the Hilbert polynomial of &quot;X&quot;. In particular, if &quot;X&quot; is irreducible and has dimension &quot;r&quot;, the arithmetic genus of &quot;X&quot; is given by

:formula_160

which is manifestly intrinsic; i.e., independent of the embedding.

The arithmetic genus of a hypersurface of degree &quot;d&quot; is formula_161 in formula_1. In particular, a smooth curve of degree &quot;d&quot; in formula_94 has arithmetic genus formula_164. This is the genus formula.

== Smooth projective varieties ==
Let &quot;X&quot; be a smooth projective variety where all of its irreducible components have dimension &quot;n&quot;. In this situation, the canonical sheaf ω&quot;X&quot;, defined as the sheaf of Kähler differentials of top degree (i.e., algebraic &quot;n&quot;-forms), is a line bundle.

===Serre duality===
Serre duality states that for any locally free sheaf formula_145 on &quot;X&quot;,

:formula_166

where the superscript prime refers to the dual space and formula_167 is the dual sheaf of formula_145.
A generalization to projective, but not necessarily smooth schemes is known as Verdier duality.

===Riemann–Roch theorem===
For a (smooth projective) curve &quot;X&quot;, &quot;H&quot;2 and higher vanish for dimensional reason and the space of the global sections of the structure sheaf is one-dimensional. Thus the arithmetic genus of &quot;X&quot; is the dimension of formula_169. By definition, the geometric genus of &quot;X&quot; is the dimension of &quot;H&quot;0(&quot;X&quot;, &quot;ω&quot;&quot;X&quot;). Serre duality thus implies that the arithmetic genus and the geometric genus coincide. They will simply be called the genus of &quot;X&quot;.

Serre duality is also a key ingredient in the proof of the Riemann–Roch theorem. Since &quot;X&quot; is smooth, there is an isomorphism of groups

:formula_170

from the group of (Weil) divisors modulo principal divisors to the group of isomorphism classes of line bundles. A divisor corresponding to ω&quot;X&quot; is called the canonical divisor and is denoted by &quot;K&quot;. Let &quot;l&quot;(&quot;D&quot;) be the dimension of formula_171. Then the Riemann–Roch theorem states: if &quot;g&quot; is a genus of &quot;X&quot;,

:formula_172

for any divisor &quot;D&quot; on &quot;X&quot;. By the Serre duality, this is the same as:

:formula_173

which can be readily proved. A generalization of the Riemann–Roch theorem to higher dimension is the Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem, as well as the far-reaching Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch theorem.

== Hilbert schemes ==

&quot;Hilbert schemes&quot; parametrize all closed subvarieties of a projective scheme &quot;X&quot; in the sense that the points (in the functorial sense) of &quot;H&quot; correspond to the closed subschemes of &quot;X&quot;. As such, the Hilbert scheme is an example of a moduli space, i.e., a geometric object whose points parametrize other geometric objects. More precisely, the Hilbert scheme parametrizes closed subvarieties whose Hilbert polynomial equals a prescribed polynomial &quot;P&quot;. It is a deep theorem of Grothendieck that there is a scheme formula_174 over &quot;k&quot; such that, for any &quot;k&quot;-scheme &quot;T&quot;, there is a bijection

:formula_175

The closed subscheme of formula_176 that corresponds to the identity map formula_177 is called the &quot;universal family&quot;.

For formula_178, the Hilbert scheme formula_179 is called the Grassmannian of &quot;r&quot;-planes in formula_1 and, if &quot;X&quot; is a projective scheme, formula_174 is called the Fano scheme of &quot;r&quot;-planes on &quot;X&quot;.

== Complex projective varieties ==
In this section, all algebraic varieties are complex algebraic varieties. A key feature of the theory of complex projective varieties is the combination of algebraic and analytic methods. The transition between these theories is provided by the following link: since any complex polynomial is also a holomorphic function, any complex variety &quot;X&quot; yields a complex analytic space, denoted formula_182. Moreover, geometric properties of &quot;X&quot; are reflected by the ones of formula_182. For example, the latter is a complex manifold if and only if &quot;X&quot; is smooth; it is compact if and only if &quot;X&quot; is proper over formula_184.

===Relation to complex Kähler manifolds===
Complex projective space is a Kähler manifold. This implies that, for any projective algebraic variety &quot;X&quot;, formula_182 is a compact Kähler manifold. The converse is not in general true, but the Kodaira embedding theorem gives a criterion for a Kähler manifold to be projective.

In low dimensions, there are the following results:

*(Riemann) A compact Riemann surface (i.e., compact complex manifold of dimension one) is a projective variety. By the Torelli theorem, it is uniquely determined by its Jacobian.
*(Chow-Kodaira) A compact complex manifold of dimension two with two algebraically independent meromorphic functions is a projective variety.

===GAGA and Chow&#x27;s theorem===
Chow&#x27;s theorem provides a striking way to go the other way, from analytic to algebraic geometry. It states that every analytic subvariety of a complex projective space is algebraic. The theorem may be interpreted to saying that a holomorphic function satisfying certain growth condition is necessarily algebraic: &quot;projective&quot; provides this growth condition. One can deduce from the theorem the following:

* Meromorphic functions on the complex projective space are rational.
* If an algebraic map between algebraic varieties is an analytic isomorphism, then it is an (algebraic) isomorphism. (This part is a basic fact in complex analysis.) In particular, Chow&#x27;s theorem implies that a holomorphic map between projective varieties is algebraic. (consider the graph of such a map.)
* Every holomorphic vector bundle on a projective variety is induced by a unique algebraic vector bundle.
* Every holomorphic line bundle on a projective variety is a line bundle of a divisor.

Chow&#x27;s theorem can be shown via Serre&#x27;s GAGA principle. Its main theorem states:

:Let &quot;X&quot; be a projective scheme over formula_184. Then the functor associating the coherent sheaves on &quot;X&quot; to the coherent sheaves on the corresponding complex analytic space &quot;X&quot;an is an equivalence of categories. Furthermore, the natural maps
::formula_187
:are isomorphisms for all &quot;i&quot; and all coherent sheaves formula_145 on &quot;X&quot;.

===Complex tori vs. complex abelian varieties===
The complex manifold associated to an abelian variety &quot;A&quot; over formula_184 is a compact complex Lie group. These can be shown to be of the form

:formula_190

and are also referred to as complex tori. Here, &quot;g&quot; is the dimension of the torus and &quot;L&quot; is a lattice (also referred to as period lattice).

According to the uniformization theorem already mentioned above, any torus of dimension 1 arises from an abelian variety of dimension 1, i.e., from an elliptic curve. In fact, the Weierstrass&#x27;s elliptic function formula_191 attached to &quot;L&quot; satisfies a certain differential equation and as a consequence it defines a closed immersion:

:formula_192

There is a &quot;p&quot;-adic analog, the p-adic uniformization theorem.

For higher dimensions, the notions of complex abelian varieties and complex tori differ: only polarized complex tori come from abelian varieties.

===Kodaira vanishing===
The fundamental Kodaira vanishing theorem states that for an ample line bundle formula_62 on a smooth projective variety &quot;X&quot; over a field of characteristic zero,

:formula_194

for &quot;i&quot; &gt; 0, or, equivalently by Serre duality formula_195 for &quot;i&quot; &lt; &quot;n&quot;. The first proof of this theorem used analytic methods of Kähler geometry, but a purely algebraic proof was found later. The Kodaira vanishing in general fails for a smooth projective variety in positive characteristic. Kodaira&#x27;s theorem is one of various vanishing theorems, which give criteria for higher sheaf cohomologies to vanish. Since the Euler characteristic of a sheaf (see above) is often more manageable than individual cohomology groups, this often has important consequences about the geometry of projective varieties.

<text>Brooklyn College is a public university in Brooklyn in New York City, United States. It is part of the City University of New York system and enrolls nearly 14,000 students on a campus in the Midwood and Flatbush sections of Brooklyn as of fall 2023.

New York City&#x27;s first public coeducational liberal arts college, the college was formed in 1930 by the merger of the Brooklyn branches of Hunter College (centered in Manhattan), then a women&#x27;s college, and of the City College of New York (also Manhattan), then a men&#x27;s college. Once tuition-free, the city&#x27;s 1975 fiscal crisis ended the free tuition policy. The college also consolidated to its main campus.

Prominent alumni of Brooklyn College include US senators, federal judges, US financial chairmen, Olympians, CEOs, and recipients of Academy Awards, Emmy Awards, Pulitzer Prizes, and Nobel Prizes.

==College history==

===Early decades===
Brooklyn College was founded in 1930. That year, as directed by the New York City Board of Higher Education on April 22, the college authorized the combination of the Downtown Brooklyn branches of Hunter College, at that time a city women&#x27;s college, and the City College of New York, then a men&#x27;s college (both these branches had been established in 1926). The third oldest higher education institution in what would become the City University system, Brooklyn College became the first public coeducational liberal arts college in New York City. The school opened in September 1930, holding separate classes for men and women until their junior years. Admission would require passing a stringent entrance exam.
In 1932, architect Randolph Evans drafted a plan for the campus on a substantial plot that his employer owned in Brooklyn&#x27;s Midwood section. Evans sketched a Georgian campus facing a central quadrangle, and anchored by a library building with a tower. Evans presented the sketches to the college&#x27;s then president, Dr. William A. Boylan, who approved the layout.

The land was bought for $1.6 million (equivalent to $ in ), and construction allotment was $5 million (equivalent to $ in ). Construction began in 1935. At the groundbreaking ceremony was Mayor Fiorello La Guardia and Brooklyn Borough President Raymond Ingersoll. In 1936, United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt visited and laid the gymnasium&#x27;s cornerstone. The new campus opened for the fall 1937 semester. In the 1940s, Boylan, Ingersoll, Roosevelt and La Guardia each became namesake of a campus building.

During the tenure of its second president, Harry Gideonse, from 1939 to 1966, Brooklyn College ranked high nationally in number of alumni with doctorate degrees. As academics fled Nazi Germany, nearly a third of refugee historians who were female would at some point work at Brooklyn College. In 1944, sociologist Marion Vera Cuthbert became the first permanent black faculty member appointed at any of the New York municipal colleges. And in 1956, with John Hope Franklin joining, Brooklyn College became the first &quot;white&quot; college to hire on a permanent basis a historian who was black.

In 1959, still tuition-free, about 8,000 undergraduates were enrolled. In 1962, the college joined six other colleges to form the City University of New York, creating the world&#x27;s second-largest university. In 1983, Brooklyn College named its library the Harry D. Gideonse Library.

Nevertheless, Gideonse remains a controversial figure in the college&#x27;s history; as one account noted, he is &quot;either lauded as a hero and great educator in hagiographic accounts . . . or decried by faculty and alumni as an autocrat who stifled academic freedom and students&#x27; rights.&quot;

In addition to his curricular and student life reforms, Gideonse was known for his decades-long campaign to ferret out Communists among the college community and his testimony before congressional and state investigating committees during the Second Red Scare.

On the other hand, perhaps retaining the memory of the time when, as a University of Chicago professor, he was unjustly accused of being a Communist and advocating &quot;free love,&quot; Gideonse also attacked those who, without evidence, charged faculty, staff and students with being subversives and defended faculty free speech rights against outside critics.

The college&#x27;s third president, Francis Kilcoyne, served from 1966 to 1967. The fourth president, Harold Syrett, resigned due to ill health in February 1969, when George A. Peck was named acting president. John Kneller, Brooklyn College&#x27;s fifth president, served from 1969 until 1979. These presidents served during what were perhaps the most tumultuous years for Brooklyn College.

During the Vietnam War, as they did on other U.S. campuses, student protests rocked Brooklyn College. President Gideonse, in a 1965 television interview, blamed demonstrations on Communists who were &quot;duping the innocents&quot; into demanding more freedom on campus, leading the New York Civil Liberties Union to criticize Gideonse for &quot;his efforts to smear student groups at the college with the Communist label.&quot;

Also in 1965, student protests forced the Gideonse administration to rescind new, stricter dress rules that forbade male students from wearing dungarees or sweatshirts on campus at any time and mandated that female students wear skirts and blouses even in extremely cold weather. After Gideonse&#x27;s retirement in June 1966, a newly-appointed dean of administration, Dante Negro, said he was not bothered by the students&#x27; more casual dress &quot;that makes it hard to distinguish between the sexes,&quot; calling it &quot;a passing fad.&quot;

On October 21, 1967, a front-page story in &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that the college was virtually closed down by a strike of thousands of students angered by police action against antiwar demonstrators protesting U.S. Navy recruiters earlier in the week. Five days later, another front-page &quot;Times&quot; story reported that students had agreed to return to classes after an agreement was reached with college administrators after negotiations. A few days after that, President Kilcoyne walked out when New York Mayor John V. Lindsay appeared at the college, citing Lindsay&#x27;s insult in calling the school &quot;Berkeley East.&quot;

Around the same time, the college&#x27;s students were involved in campus protests involving racial issues. In May 1968, Brooklyn College news again made the front page of &quot;The New York Times&quot; when police broke up a 16-hour sit-in at the registrar&#x27;s office to demand that more Black and Puerto Rican students be admitted to the school. At trial, a Black Brooklyn judge reacted angrily when one student said they had been reacting to racism and sentenced him and 32 other white students to five days in jail for the sit-in. In May 1969, 19 or 20 Brooklyn College students faced criminal charges in connection with campus disorders during the spring semester, including raids in which students allegedly ransacked files and smoke-bombed the library.

In late April 1970, students demanding more open admissions and racial diversity staged a sit-in at President Kneller&#x27;s office, holding him and five deans there for several hours. The next week, in early May 1970, students seized the president&#x27;s office and other buildings during a student strike upon the Kent State shootings and the Cambodian Campaign. President Kneller terminated classes, but kept campus buildings open for students and faculty, obtaining a court order against students occupying buildings.

In October 1974, 200 Hispanic students took over the registrar&#x27;s office to protest President Kneller&#x27;s appointment of a chair of the Puerto Rican Studies Department different from that of the person selected by a faculty search committee. Defying a judge&#x27;s temporary court order to leave the building, the protesters were supported at a rallies outside Boylan Hall by many student groups and the alumni association, but Kneller refused to rescind his controversial appointment. Protests flared up again in the spring 1975 semester with another takeover of the registrar&#x27;s office. By January 1976, the college&#x27;s faculty union voted &quot;no confidence&quot; in Kneller, charging that he &quot;consistently ignored faculty rights&quot; and failed to provide leadership.

Brooklyn College, along with the rest of CUNY, shut down for two weeks in May and June 1976 as the university was unable to pay its bills. Amid New York City&#x27;s financial crisis, near bankruptcy, Brooklyn College&#x27;s campus in downtown Brooklyn closed, leaving the Midwood campus as the Brooklyn College&#x27;s only campus. In the fall of 1976, with some 30,000 undergraduates enrolled, the college charged tuition for the first time.

In January 1978, the college&#x27;s Faculty Council approved a vote of &quot;no confidence&quot; in President Kneller on Wednesday and recommended to the Board of Higher Education that he be replaced.

Brooklyn College&#x27;s sixth president was Robert Hess, who served from 1979 to 1992. Hess initiated major changes in the college curriculum, mandating a standard core for all students. Implementation of the new curriculum was aided by a large grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities. By 1984, in a national report&#x27;s otherwise gloomy assessment of humanities education, Brooklyn College was singled out as &quot;a bright spot&quot; among American universities for stressing the study of the humanities.

In a 1988 survey of thousands of American college deans, Brooklyn College ranked 5th in providing students with a strong general education, and was the only public institution among the top five. As of 1989, Brooklyn College ranked 11th in the US, and ahead of six of the eight Ivy League universities, by number of graduates who had acquired doctoral degrees. At Brooklyn College being called “the poor man’s Harvard,” President Hess quipped, “I like to think of Harvard as the rich man’s Brooklyn College.”

Even as Brooklyn College rebounded academically, it suffered a severe budget crunch in the 1988-1989 school year due to reductions in state financing; this resulted in fewer courses, larger classes, no new faculty and staff hirings, supply shortages, and deferral of maintenance of buildings and grounds.

Vernon Lattin was the seventh president of Brooklyn College, from 1992 to 2000. 
During Lattin&#x27;s tenure, Brooklyn College began a complete overhaul of campus buildings and vastly improved computer and Internet access for students and faculty. The college returned to intercollegiate sports competition and the college chess team won U.S. and international championships. Lattin was also president at the time of the first individual million-dollar donation to the Brooklyn College Foundation.

===Modern history===
Brooklyn College&#x27;s campus leafy East Quad looks much like it did when it was originally constructed. The campus also serves as home to BCBC/ Brooklyn College Presents complex and its four theaters, including the George Gershwin.

Gershwin Hall was demolished and replaced by The Leonard &amp; Claire Tow Center for the Performing Arts, for which ground was broken in 2011. The performing arts center was named for alumni Leonard and Claire Tow, who gifted $10 million to the college. Other changes to the original design include the demolition of Plaza Building, due to its inefficient use of space, poor ventilation, and significant maintenance costs. To replace the Plaza Building, the college constructed West Quad Center, designed by the notable Uruguayan architect Rafael Viñoly. The new building contains classroom space, offices, gymnasiums and a swimming pool. It houses the offices of Registration, Admissions, Financial Aid, and the Department of Physical Education and Exercise Science. The grounds contain a quadrangle with grassy areas and trees. New façades are being constructed on Roosevelt and James halls where they once connected with Plaza Building. The 2009–10 CUNYAC championship men&#x27;s basketball team now plays its home games in the West Quad Center.

This followed a major $70 million library renovation completed in 2003 that saw the library moved to a temporary home while construction took place. The Brooklyn College library is now located in its original location in a completely renovated and expanded LaGuardia Hall.

From 2000 to 2009 when he retired, Christoph M. Kimmich was the eighth president of Brooklyn College. In the 2003 edition of &quot;The Best 345 Colleges&quot;, the &quot;Princeton Review&quot; named Brooklyn College as the most beautiful campus in the country and ranked it fifth in the nation for &quot;Best Academic Bang for the Buck&quot;.

Karen L. Gould was named the ninth president of Brooklyn College in 2009. Among her accomplishments were creating a new graduate film school and four new academic schools, new athletic fields, and increasing enrollment in the sciences. Her tenure was marked by repeated free speech controversies involving Israel that drew both criticism and praise. After 42 years in higher education, Gould announced her retirement in 2015.

Michelle Anderson became the 10th president of Brooklyn College in 2016. In 2016, Brooklyn College announced a new home for the Koppelman School of Business, with the planned construction of a new building, Koppelman Hall, on property adjacent to the 26-acre campus bought in 2011. This increased the campus size to 35 acres.

For four straight years, starting in 2018, U.S. News &amp; World Report named Brooklyn College the most ethnically diverse college in the North Region.

==Organization==



Brooklyn College has five schools:
* Murray Koppelman School of Business
* School of Education
* School of Humanities and Social Sciences
* School of Natural and Behavioral Sciences
* School of Visual, Media, and Performing Arts

==Academics==

===Undergraduate curriculum===
Beginning in 1981, the college instituted a group of classes that all undergraduates were required to take, called &quot;Core Studies&quot;. The classes were: Classical Origins of Western Culture, Introduction to Art, Introduction to Music, People, Power, and Politics, The Shaping of the Modern World, Introduction to Mathematical Reasoning and Computer Programming, Landmarks of Literature, Chemistry, Physics, Biology, Geology, Studies in African, Asian, and Latin American Cultures, and Knowledge, Existence and Values.

In 2006, the Core Curriculum was revamped, and the 13 required courses were replaced with 15 courses in 3 disciplines, from which students were required to take 11. In the fall of 2013, Brooklyn College embarked on CUNY&#x27;s new general education alternative, the Pathways curriculum, consisting of three components: Required Core (four courses), Flexible Core (six courses) and College Option (four courses)—totaling 42 credits. Brooklyn College offers over a hundred majors varying from the visual arts to Women&#x27;s Studies.

===Division of Graduate Studies===
The Division of Graduate Studies at Brooklyn College was established in 1935 and offers more than seventy programs in the arts, education, humanities, sciences, and computer and social sciences. Among those programs is the Graduate theatre program, which is the top ranked in the CUNY system and 14th in the United States; faculty include Tony Award nominee Justin Townsend.

===B.A.–M.D. program===
The Brooklyn College B.A.–M.D. program is an eight-year program affiliated with SUNY Downstate Medical Center. The program follows a rigorous selection process, with a maximum of 15 students selected every year. Each student selected to the program receives a Brooklyn College Presidential Scholarship. B.A.–M.D. students must engage in community service for three years, beginning in their lower sophomore semester. During one summer of their undergraduate studies, students are required to volunteer in a clinical setting where they are involved in direct patient care. B.A.–M.D. students are encouraged to major in the humanities or social sciences.

===The Scholars Program===
The Scholars Program is home to a small number of students with strong writing ability and academic record. Being the oldest honors program in the CUNY system, The Scholars Program has served as a model for many other honors programs nationwide. It was established in 1960 and is an interdisciplinary liberal arts program. The program offers honors-level Core courses and seminars as well as small, personalized classes. Upon graduation from Brooklyn College, many Scholars continue their education in competitive programs at top-ranked universities like Princeton, Yale, and New York University. The program accepts incoming freshmen in addition to matriculated sophomores and transfer students (up to 48 credits). Once admitted, they receive a Brooklyn College Foundation Presidential Scholarship of up to $4,000 for every year of their undergraduate study at Brooklyn College and a laptop computer.

===Coordinated Engineering Program===
The Coordinated Honors Engineering Program offers a course of study equivalent to the first two years at any engineering school. Students who maintain the required academic level are guaranteed transfer to one of the three coordinating schools—New York University Tandon School of Engineering, City College of New York School of Engineering, and the College of Staten Island Engineering Science Program—to complete their bachelor&#x27;s degree in engineering. Coordinating Engineering students have also transferred to the New York Institute of Technology, Stony Brook University, University of Wisconsin, University of Michigan, Cooper Union, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Students admitted as incoming First-Year receive a Brooklyn College Foundation Presidential Scholarship that provides full tuition for their two years of full-time undergraduate study in the Coordinated Engineering Program. As members of the Honors Academy, Engineering Honors students take advantage of individual advising, faculty consultation, and early registration. In the Commons they find study facilities, computer access, academic, scholarship, internship, and career opportunities, and, above all, intellectual stimulation among other talented students like themselves. Students applying to the Engineering Honors Program will also be considered for the Scholars Program.

===Feirstein Graduate School of Cinema===

Barry R. Feirstein Graduate School of Cinema is the first public graduate film school in New York City. It is the only film school in America to have its own classroom on a film lot with the collaboration of Steiner Studios, the largest soundstage on the East Coast. The program offers a two-year M.A. in Cinema Studies, a two-year M.F.A. in Cinema Arts in the discipline of Producing, and a three-year M.F.A in Cinema Arts with five disciplines of cinematography,
directing, post-production, screenwriting, and Digital Arts and Visual Effects. The school opened in the fall of 2015. The first graduating class was in Spring 2018.

===Rankings===
&quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked the school tied for 62nd overall as a Regional college (North region), 6th in &quot;Top Performers on Social Mobility&quot;, 15th in &quot;Top Public Schools&quot;, and tied for 33rd in &quot;Best Colleges for Veterans&quot; for 2021.

==Athletics==
Brooklyn College athletic teams are nicknamed the Bulldogs. The college is a member at the Division III level of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA); primarily competing in the City University of New York Athletic Conference (CUNYAC) since the 1996–97 academic year (which they also competed in a previous stint from 1978–79 to 1979–80). The Bulldogs previously competed in the East Coast Conference at the Division I level during the 1991–92 academic year.

Men&#x27;s sports include basketball, cheerleading, cross country, soccer, swimming &amp; diving, tennis and volleyball; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cheerleading, cross country, soccer, softball, swimming &amp; diving, tennis and volleyball. Their basketball program would find infamy for being the first reported incident of a potential bribe to fix a game against the Municipal University of Akron (now just the University of Akron) on January 29, 1945, leading to five arrests against Brooklyn College&#x27;s players in question. Another former basketball player of theirs, a previous captain named David Budin, would later be involved as a part of the 1961 NCAA University Division men&#x27;s basketball gambling scandal as a late addition for Jack Molinas&#x27; rigging group in question. From 1971–77, future Olympic coach Michel Sebastiani was the head fencing coach of the men’s fencing team.  The football field was used for the outdoor scenes in the 1978 adult film Debbie Does Dallas.

===Mascot===
In 2010, Brooklyn College adopted the Bulldog as its new mascot. The athletic program was originally known as the Kingsmen. In 1994, the mascot was changed to the Bridges. However, after the school built new facilities and underwent other changes the athletic director pushed for a new name to reflect the new program.

<text>Gaydar (a portmanteau of &quot;gay&quot; and &quot;radar&quot;) is a colloquialism referring to the intuitive ability of a person to assess others&#x27; sexual orientations as homosexual, bisexual or straight. Gaydar relies on verbal and nonverbal clues and LGBT stereotypes, including a sensitivity to social behaviors and mannerisms like body language, the tone of voice used by a person when speaking, overt rejections of traditional gender roles, a person&#x27;s occupation, and grooming habits.

Similarly, transdar (a term in use since at least ) refers to the ability for trans people to recognize trans people who pass well, by subtle cues such as &quot;the size of the hands and wrists&quot;.

However, the assumption of sexual orientation by outward appearance or behavior has been challenged by situations in which masculine gay men do not act in a stereotypically gay fashion, or in which metrosexual men (regardless of sexuality) exhibit a lifestyle, spending habits, and concern for personal appearance stereotypical of fashionable urban gay men. For women, a tomboy might be mistaken for being butch, or a lesbian might act and appear in traditionally feminine ways.

Since at least 2015, media outlets such as Australia&#x27;s ABC News have called the gaydar &quot;damaging&quot; and possibly &quot;dangerous&quot; due to its perpetuation of harmful stereotypes, its potential to lead to harassment, and its potential to dissuade people from coming out of the closet on their own terms. &quot;Gayety&quot; argues that the only way to assess a person&#x27;s sexuality is based on their open identification and whom they are dating.

== Scientific research ==

In 1987, a &quot;Journal of Homosexuality&quot; study asked people to judge sexual orientation from video clips, with results concluding that it was a myth. 

A 1999 study in the &quot;Journal of Personality and Social Psychology&quot; showed that people could judge sexual orientation more accurately than chance. This study asked people to indicate their sexual orientation using the Kinsey scale and then had others view very brief silent clips of the people talking using thin-slicing. The viewers rated their sexual orientations on the same scale and the researchers found a significant correlation between where the people said they were on the scale and where they were perceived to be on the scale. Studies in 2008 and 2010 have repeated this finding and have even shown that home videos of children can be used to judge accurately their sexual orientation later in life.

Later studies found that gaydar was also accurate at rates greater than chance for judgments just from the face. Study participants use gendered facial cues and stereotypes of gay people to make their judgments, but reliably misjudge sexual orientation for people countering stereotypes. The ethnicity, and nationality of neither the person making the judgment nor the person they are judging seems to make a difference when making judgments from faces. Even individual facial features (just the eyes) can sometimes give enough information to tell whether a man or woman is gay, straight, or lesbian. One study showed that judgments of men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s faces for about 1/25 of a second was enough time to tell whether they were gay, straight, or lesbian. People&#x27;s judgments were no more accurate when they had more time to make their judgments. Follow-up work to this suggested that gaydar happens automatically when someone sees another person and that seeing someone’s face automatically activates stereotypes about gays and straights. People seem not to know that they have gaydar, though. Gay men have more accurate gaydar than straight men, and women have more accurate gaydar when they are ovulating. One study hypothesized that this might be because homosexual people are more attentive to detail than heterosexual people are, apparently as an adopted perceptual style aiding in the recognition of other homosexual people.

Other studies have found that men and women with body shapes and walking styles similar to people of the opposite sex are more often perceived as gay.

A study by UCLA assistant professor Kerri Johnson found that observers were able to accurately guess the sexual orientation of men 60 percent of the time, slightly better than would be achieved by random chance; with women, their guesses didn&#x27;t exceed chance. Gender-specific body movements are not reliably associated with a person&#x27;s sexual orientation; this is true of face shape, but surprisingly not for voices, even though people think they are associated with a person&#x27;s sexual orientation. A handful of studies have investigated the question of gaydar from the voice. They have found that people can tell who is gay and straight from their voices, but have mostly focused on men (sometimes terming the vocal difference &quot;gay lisp&quot;). Detailed acoustic analyses have highlighted a number of factors in a person&#x27;s voice that are used, one of which is the way that gay and straight men pronounce &quot;s&quot; sounds. Acoustic cues have also been shown to contribute to perception of homosexuality in other languages, including Mandarin (for men) and Spanish (for men and women).

Research by William T. L. Cox and his colleagues proposed that &quot;gaydar&quot; is simply an alternate label for using LGBT stereotypes to infer orientation (e.g., inferring that fashionable men are gay). This work points out that the scientific work reviewed above that claims to demonstrate accurate gaydar falls prey to the false positive paradox (see also the base rate fallacy), because the alleged accuracy discounts the very low base rate of LGBT people in real populations, resulting in a scenario where the &quot;accuracy&quot; reported above in lab studies translates to high levels of inaccuracy in the real world. Cox writes, &quot;Most people think of stereotyping as inappropriate. But if you&#x27;re not calling it &#x27;stereotyping&#x27;, if you&#x27;re giving it this other label and camouflaging it as &#x27;gaydar,&#x27; it appears to be more socially and personally acceptable.&quot;

== Electronic device ==
In the early 2000s, an electronic device based on the Japanese Lovegety wireless dating device was marketed as &#x27;Gaydar&#x27; and reported on widely in the media. This was a keychain-sized device that would send out a wireless signal, alerting the user via a vibration, beep, or flash when a similar device was within . This lets the user know that a like-minded person was nearby.

== Artificial intelligence ==
Stanford University researchers Michal Kosinski and Yilun Wang carried out a study in 2017 which claimed that a facial recognition algorithm using neural networks could identify sexual orientation in 81% of the tested cases for men and 74% with women by reviewing photos of online dating profiles. Kosinski voiced concern about privacy and the potential for misuse of AI, and suggested that his findings were consistent with the prenatal hormone theory of sexual orientation, which hypothesizes that levels of androgens exposure in the womb help determine whether a person is straight, bisexual or gay. PHT predicts that gay and straight individuals may choose to present themselves differently on their profile pictures or have different facial appearance. 

Two replication studies confirmed the main findings of this study. It also found that even when faces are blurred it is possible to classify sexual orientation. 

A blog post by AI researcher Blaise Agüera y Arcas criticized the study for using photos from an uncontrolled environment. Rather than picking up on the facial structure, it was likely the algorithm was identifying factors in grooming, lifestyle, and photo angle; a small set of questions about differences including makeup use, facial hair, and eyeglass use was nearly as accurate as of the original study.

<text>SmallBASIC is a BASIC programming language dialect with interpreters released as free software under the GNU General Public License version 3 for Microsoft Windows, Linux and Android.

==Description==
The dialect is described by the authors as a second generation BASIC, and has a lot in common with QBasic. SmallBASIC includes trigonometric, matrices and algebra functions, a built in IDE, a string library, system, sound, and graphic commands along with structured programming syntax.

==Intended application==
The &quot;Small&quot; prefix in the name SmallBASIC reflects the project&#x27;s original intention of being used with the Palm, a small hand-held device. SmallBASIC was designed for portability, and is written in C with separate modules containing any code that is unique to a particular platform.

SmallBASIC is intended to support the same sorts of applications supported by GW-BASIC and QBasic on the IBM PC, with support for drawing Graphic Primitives to the screen, creating sounds, String Manipulation, and displaying text in various fonts. SmallBASIC also adds functions such as &quot;File Save&quot;, &quot;Save As&quot;, &quot;Close File&quot;, and &quot;Open File&quot; to the Palm, a device with no native filesystem. SmallBASIC is also intended as a tool for mathematics, with built-in functions for Unit conversion, Algebra, Matrix math, Trigonometry, Statistics, and for two and three dimensional Equation Graphing.

==History==

SmallBASIC was designed to run on minimal hardware. One of the primary platforms supported was Palm OS, where memory, CPU cycles, and screen space were limited. The SmallBASIC graphics engine could use ASCII graphics (similar to ASCII art) and therefore ran many programs on pure text devices. SmallBASIC runs even on Palm OS wristwatches made by Fossil, Inc.

==Platforms==

SmallBASIC is available for all POSIX-Compliant operating systems (including Linux, BSD, and UNIX), DOS/DJGPP, Win32, FLTK, VTOS, Franklin eBookMan, Cygwin/MingW, Helio/VT-OS, Android, the Nokia N770 Internet Tablet., and on any system that supports SDL, FLTK, SVGALib, Linux framebuffer, or Windows GUI.

== Syntax ==

The syntax of SmallBASIC has a lot in common with QBasic. Line numbers are not required, and statements are terminated by newlines. Multiple statements may be written on a single line by separating each statement with a colon (:)

An example &quot;Hello, World!&quot; program is:
PRINT &quot;Hello, World!&quot;
An example of how SmallBASIC allows to load an image file and display the image:
I = IMAGE(&quot;image_name.png&quot;) &#x27;Loads a png file
I.SHOW(100,100) &#x27;shows the image on screen at the coordinates 100,100 
==Loadable modules==

External modules can be written in C to extend the functionality provided by SmallBASIC. Since version 12.20 modules for Raylib, Nuklear and WebSockets are included in the release. Additionally a loadable module to access the GPIO connector of the Raspberry Pi exists.

==Reception==
*Tech Republic calls it &quot;&quot;an excellent tool to begin programming with.&quot;
*ASCII-World says &quot;SmallBASIC is an excellent tool for mathematics&quot;&quot;
* David Mertz, Ph.D. and Andrew Blais, Ph.D. of Gnosis Software say &quot;SmallBASIC has one of the better development interfaces [we have] reviewed. &quot;

<doc id="320482" wikidata="Q379915" url="?curid=320482" title="Adventure (1980 video game)">
<text>Adventure is a 1980 action-adventure game developed by Warren Robinett and published by Atari, Inc. for the Atari Video Computer System (later renamed Atari 2600). The player controls a square avatar whose quest is to explore an open-ended environment to find a magical chalice and return it to the golden castle. The game world is populated by roaming enemies: three dragons that can eat the avatar and a bat that randomly steals and moves items around the game world. &quot;Adventure&quot; introduced new elements to console games, including enemies that continue to move when offscreen.

The game was conceived as a graphical version of the 1977 text adventure &quot;Colossal Cave Adventure&quot;. Warren Robinett spent approximately one year designing and coding the game, while overcoming a variety of technical limitations in the Atari 2600 console hardware, as well as difficulties with management within Atari. As a result of conflicts with Atari&#x27;s management which denied giving public credit for programmers, Robinett programmed a secret room that contained his name within the game, only found by players after the game shipped and Robinett had left Atari. While not the first such Easter egg, Robinett&#x27;s secret room pioneered this idea within video games and other forms of media, and since has transcended into popular culture, such as the climax of Ernest Cline&#x27;s novel &quot;Ready Player One&quot; and its film adaptation.

&quot;Adventure&quot; received positive reviews at the time of its release and in the decades since, often named as one of the industry&#x27;s most influential games and among the greatest video games of all time. It is considered one of the first action-adventure and console fantasy games, and inspired other games in the genre. More than one million cartridges of &quot;Adventure&quot; were sold, and the game has been included in numerous Atari 2600 game collections for modern computer hardware. The game&#x27;s prototype code was used as the basis for the 1979 &quot;Superman&quot; game, and a planned sequel eventually formed the basis for the &quot;Swordquest&quot; games.

==Gameplay==
In &quot;Adventure&quot;, the player&#x27;s goal is to recover the Enchanted Chalice that an evil magician has stolen and hidden in the kingdom and return it to the Golden Castle. The kingdom is made of a total of 30 rooms, with various obstacles, enemies, and mazes located in and around the Golden, White, and Black Castles. The kingdom is guarded by three dragonsthe yellow Yorgle, the green Grundle, and the red Rhindlethat protect or flee from various items and attack the player&#x27;s avatar. An hostile bat can roam the kingdom freely, carrying an item or a dragon around; the bat was to be named &quot;Knubberrub&quot; but the name is not in the manual. The bat&#x27;s two states are agitation and non-agitation. When in the agitated state, the bat will either pick up or swap what it currently carries with an object in the present room, eventually returning to the non-agitated state where it will not pick up an object. The bat continues to fly around even offscreen, swapping objects.

The player&#x27;s avatar is a simple square shape that can move within and between rooms, each represented by a single screen. Helpful objects include keys that open the castles, a magnet that pulls items towards the player, a magic bridge that the player can use to cross certain obstacles, and a sword which can be used to defeat the dragons. The player may only carry one object at a time. If eaten by a dragon, the player can then opt to resurrect the dead avatar instead of completely restarting the game. The avatar reappears at the Golden Castle and all objects remain at their latest location, but all slain dragons are resurrected. The ability to resurrect the avatar without resetting the entire game is considered one of the earliest examples of a &quot;continue game&quot; option in video games.

The game offers three different skill levels. Level 1 is the easiest, as it uses a simplified room layout and does not include the White Castle, bat, red dragon, or invisible mazes. Level 2 is the full version of the game, with the various objects appearing in set positions at the start. Level 3 is similar to Level 2, but the location of the objects is randomized for a greater challenge. The player can use the difficulty switches on the Atari 2600 to further control the game&#x27;s difficulty; one switch controls the dragons&#x27; bite speed, and one causes them to flee when the player carries the sword.

==Development==

&quot;Adventure&quot; was designed and programmed by Atari employee Warren Robinett, and published by Atari, Inc. At the time, Atari programmers were generally given full control on the creative direction and development cycle for their games, and this required them to plan for their next game as they neared completion of their current one to stay productive. Robinett was finishing his work on &quot;Slot Racers&quot; when he was given an opportunity to visit the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory by Julius Smith, one of several friends he was sharing a house with. There, he was introduced to the 1977 version of the computer text game &quot;Colossal Cave Adventure&quot;, created by Will Crowther and modified by Don Woods. After playing the game for several hours, he was inspired to create a graphical version.

Robinett began designing his graphics-based game with the help of a Hewlett-Packard 1611A logic analyzer (a debugging tool) around May to June 1978. He was soon aware that memory use was critical because Atari 2600 cartridge ROMs have only 4096 bytes (4 KB), and the system has 128 bytes of RAM for program variables. In contrast, &quot;Colossal Cave Adventure&quot; uses hundreds of kilobytes of memory on a large computer. The final game uses nearly all of the available memory (including 5% of the cartridge storage for Robinett&#x27;s Easter egg), with 15 unused bytes from the ROM capacity. Robinett credits Ken Thompson, his professor at University of California, Berkeley, with teaching him the skills needed to use the limited memory efficiently. Thompson had required his students to learn the C programming language that he had invented at AT&amp;T, and Robinett carried C techniques into assembly language.

Robinett first identified ways to translate the elements of &quot;Colossal Cave Adventure&quot; into simple, easily recognizable graphics that the player interacts with directly, replacing text-based commands with joystick controls. Due to the system&#x27;s low resolution pixels, Robinett noted the dragons look more like ducks. Robinett developed workarounds for various technical limitations of the Atari 2600, which has only one playfield and five memory-mapped registers available to represent moving objects. Only two of these registers are capable of representing more complex sprites, so he used those for objects and creatures within the game. He used the register originally designated for the ball in games such as &quot;Pong&quot; to represent the player&#x27;s avatar. Finally, he used the registers assigned for missiles, such as the bullets in &quot;Combat&quot;, for additional walls in the playing field to be able to represent different rooms within the game with the same playfield. Another hardware limitation forces the left and right sides of nearly every screen to be mirrored, which fostered the creation of the game&#x27;s confusing mazes. The exceptions include two screens in the Black Castle catacombs and two in the main hallway beneath the Golden Castle. They are mirrored, but contain a vertical wall object in the room to make an asymmetrical screen, as well as provide a secret door for an Easter egg. Robinett originally intended for all rooms to be bidirectionally connected, but programming bugs make a few such connections unidirectional, which are explained away as &quot;bad magic&quot; in the game&#x27;s manual.

Robinett overcame these limitations to introduce concepts novel to video games. He constructed thirty different rooms in the games, whereas most games of the time present only a single screen. Furthermore, off-screen objects such as the bat continue to move according to their programming behavior.

In addition to the technical limitations, Robinett had struggled with Atari&#x27;s management over the game. Around the time of &quot;Adventure&quot;″s development, Atari, now owned by Warner Communications, had hired Ray Kassar as general manager of their Consumer Division, and he was later promoted to president and CEO of Atari in December 1978. Kassar interacted with the programmers rarely and generally treated their contributions with indifference. Robinett was initially discouraged from working on &quot;Adventure&quot; by his supervisor, George Simcock, who said the ambitious game could not be done on Atari 2600 based on knowing how much memory &quot;Colossal Cave Adventure&quot; uses. When Robinett developed a working prototype within one month, Atari&#x27;s management team was impressed, encouraging him to continue the game. The management later tried to convince Robinett to make it a tie-in work for the upcoming film &quot;Superman&quot; (1978), which was owned by Warner Communication, but Robinett remained committed to his initial idea. Instead, Atari developer John Dunn agreed to take Robinett&#x27;s prototype source code to make the 1979 &quot;Superman&quot; game.

A second prototype was completed near the end of 1978, with only about eight rooms, a single dragon, and two objects. Robinett recognized that it demonstrated his design goals, but was boring. He put the game aside for a few months and came back with additional ideas, finishing it by June 1979. Two changes were the possibility of being eaten by the dragon and resetting the avatar, and the addition of the sword object with which to kill the dragon. Robinett found that the various possibilities that arose from this combination of elements improved the excitement of the game, and subsequently made three dragons, reusing the same source code for the behavior of all three. The magnet was created to work around a potential situation where the player could irretrievably drop an object into a wall space.

To develop the plot for the game, Robinett worked with Steve Harding, the author for nearly all Atari 2600 game manuals at that time. Harding developed most of the plot after playing the game, with Robinett revising elements where he saw fit. Robinett states that he had come up with the names for the three dragons and offered a friend&#x27;s suggestion for naming the bat &quot;Knubberrub&quot;.

Robinett submitted the source code for &quot;Adventure&quot; to Atari management in June 1979 and soon left Atari. Atari released the game in early 1980.

==Easter egg==


Generally defined as a &quot;message, trick, or unusual behavior hidden inside a computer program by its creator&quot;, the Easter egg concept was popularized by &quot;Adventure&quot;, influenced by the corporate culture at Atari. After Atari&#x27;s acquisition by Warner Communications in 1976, there was a culture clash between the executives from New York, and the Californian programmers who were more laid back. Atari removed the names of game developers from their products, as a means to prevent competitors from identifying and recruiting Atari&#x27;s programmers. This also was used as a means to deny the developers a bargaining chip in any negotiations they may have with management, according to Robinett. These attitudes led to the departure of several programmers; notably, David Crane, Larry Kaplan, Alan Miller, and Bob Whitehead all left Atari due to lack of recognition and royalty payments, and formed Activision as a third-party 2600 developer, making many hit games in competition with Atari.

Unknown to anyone else, Robinett embedded his name in his game in the form of a hidden and virtually inaccessible room displaying the text &quot;Created by Warren Robinett&quot;, inspired by popular rumors that the Beatles had hidden messages in songs. In 2015, Robinett recalled the message as a means of self-promotion, noting that Atari had paid him only around US$22,000 per year without any royalties, while Atari would sell one million units of a game at US$25 apiece. This secret is one of the earliest known Easter eggs in a video game.

Robinett kept the secret for more than one year, even from all Atari employees. He was unsure of whether it would be discovered by other Atari personnel prior to publishing. It is not mentioned in the game&#x27;s manual, as the manual&#x27;s author was unaware. After the game was released, Adam Clayton, a fifteen-year-old from Salt Lake City, discovered it and sent a letter of explanation to Atari. Robinett had already quit the company by this point, so Atari tasked designers with finding the responsible code. The employee who found it said that if he were to fix it, he would change the message in the game to say &quot;Fixed by Brad Stewart&quot;. Furthermore, the cost of creating a new read-only memory (ROM) mask, or memory chip, was around at the time of the game&#x27;s release, making this change a costly endeavor. Steve Wright, the director of software development of the Atari Consumer Division, argued for retaining the message, believing it gave players additional incentive to find it and play their games more, and suggested these were like Easter eggs for players to find. Atari eventually decided to leave the access mechanism in-game, and dubbed such hidden features &quot;Easter eggs&quot;, saying they would be adding more such secrets to later games. Wright made it an official policy at Atari that all future games should include Easter eggs, often limited to being the initials of the game developer.

The Easter egg is accessed by setting difficulty levels 2 or 3 and first retrieving the Gray Dot from the Black Castle catacombs. The dot is a single pixel object which is invisibly embedded in the south wall of a sealed chamber accessible only with the bridge, and the player must bounce the avatar along the bottom wall to pick it up. The dot can be seen when in a catacombs passage or when held over a normal wall, and becomes again invisible when carried or dropped in most rooms. The dot is not attracted to the magnet, unlike all other inanimate objects. The player must bring the dot along with two or more other objects to the east end of the corridor below the Golden Castle. This causes the barrier on the right side of the screen to blink rapidly, and the player avatar is then able to push through the wall into a new room displaying the words &quot;Created by Warren Robinett&quot; in text which continuously changes color.

The text was removed from the version on the Atari Classics 10-in-1 TV Games standalone gaming unit, replaced with &quot;TEXT?&quot; It has been included in most subsequent reissues of the game.

&quot;Adventure&quot; received mostly positive reviews in the years immediately after its release and has generally been viewed positively since then.

Norman Howe reviewed &quot;Adventure&quot; in &quot;The Space Gamer&quot; No. 31. Howe commented that &quot;&quot;Adventure&quot; is a good game, as video games are measured. It is neither as interesting nor as complex as &quot;Superman&quot;, but it shows great promise for things to come.&quot;

Bill Kunkel and Frank Laney in the January 1981 issue of &quot;Video&quot; called &quot;Adventure&quot; a &quot;major design breakthrough&quot; and that it &quot;shatters several video-game conventions&quot; such as scoring and time limits. They added that it was &quot;much more ambitious&quot; than average home video games, but the graphics were underwhelming, such as the hero being a square. The 1982 book &quot;How to Win at Home Video Games&quot; called it too unpredictable with an &quot;illogical mission&quot;, concluding that &quot;even devoted strategists may soon tire of &quot;Adventure&quot;″s excessive trial and error.&quot; &quot;Electronic Games&quot; in 1983 stated that the game&#x27;s &quot;graphics are tame stuff&quot;, but it &quot;still has the power to fascinate&quot; and that &quot;the action adventure concepts introduced in &quot;Adventure&quot; are still viable today&quot;. A separate review from 1983 in the magazine&#x27;s &quot;Electronic Games 1983 Software Encyclopedia&quot; awarded the game a 9 out of 10 rating, praising its gameplay and single player gaming as excellent and outstanding respectively while only finding its graphics and sound as merely &quot;good&quot;.

Jeremy Parish of &quot;1UP.com&quot; wrote in 2010 that &quot;Adventure&quot; is &quot;a work of interpretive brilliance&quot; that &quot;cleverly extracted the basic elements of exploration, combat and treasure hunting from the text games and converted them into icons&quot;, but also conceded that it &quot;seems almost unplayably basic these days&quot;.

Atari Headquarters scored the game 8 of 10, noting its historical importance while panning the graphics and sound, concluding that &quot;Adventure&quot; was &quot;very enjoyable&quot; regardless of its technological shortcomings. In 1995, &quot;Flux&quot; magazine ranked Adventure 35th on their Top 100 Video Games. They described the game as: &quot;challenging and incredibly fun.&quot;

==Legacy==
Considered one of the first action-adventure video games and fantasy games for consoles, on video game consoles. It is the first video game to contain a widely known Easter egg, and the first to allow a player to use multiple, portable, on-screen items while exploring an open-ended environment, making it one of the first examples, even as small and primitive as it is, of an open world game. The game is the first to use a &quot;fog of war&quot; effect in its catacombs, which obscures most of the playing area except for the player&#x27;s immediate surroundings.

The game has been voted the best Atari 2600 game in numerous polls, and has been noted as a significant step in the advancement of home video games. &quot;GamePro&quot; ranked it as the 28th most important video game of all time in 2007. In 2010, &quot;1UP.com&quot; listed it as one of the most important games ever made in its &quot;The Essential 50&quot; feature. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; named &quot;Adventure&quot; as one of the top 10 games for the Atari 2600.

A sequel to &quot;Adventure&quot; was first announced in early 1982. The planned sequel eventually evolved into the &quot;Swordquest&quot; series of games. In 2005, a sequel written by Curt Vendel was released by Atari on the Atari Flashback 2 system. In 2007, AtariAge released a self-published sequel called &quot;Adventure II&quot; for the Atari 5200, which is heavily inspired by the original; . Robinett himself took the idea of using items from &quot;Adventure&quot; into his next game, &quot;Rocky&#x27;s Boots&quot;, but added the ability to combine them to form new items.

In both the 2011 novel &quot;Ready Player One&quot; and its 2018 film version the Easter egg in &quot;Adventure&quot; is prominently mentioned as the inspiration for a contest to find an Easter egg hidden in the fictional virtual reality game OASIS, and finding the secret room within &quot;Adventure&quot; is a core plot element within both versions, with footage from the game (specifically the Easter egg) incorporated into the film version.

The Lego Atari 2600 set includes three &quot;cartridges&quot; and three corresponding dioramas. The diorama for &quot;Adventure&quot; has a scene of the game&#x27;s castle with an egg hidden at its center, referencing the Easter egg.

<text>PJSC Gazprom () is a Russian majority state-owned multinational energy corporation headquartered in the Lakhta Center in Saint Petersburg. The Gazprom name is a contraction of the Russian words &quot;gazovaya promyshlennost&quot; (, gas industry). In January 2022, Gazprom displaced Sberbank from the first place in the list of the largest company in Russia by market capitalization. In 2022, the company&#x27;s revenue amounted to 8 trillion rubles. 

Gazprom is vertically integrated and is active in every area of the gas industry, including exploration and production, refining, transport, distribution and marketing, and power generation. In 2018, Gazprom produced twelve percent of the global output of natural gas, producing 497.6 billion cubic meters of natural and associated gas and 15.9 million tonnes of gas condensate. Gazprom then exports the gas through pipelines that the company builds and owns across Russia and abroad, such as Power of Siberia and TurkStream. In the same year, Gazprom has proven reserves of 35.1 trillion cubic meters of gas and 1.6 billion tons of gas condensate. Gazprom is also a large oil producer through its subsidiary Gazprom Neft, producing about 41 million tons of oil with reserves amounting to 2 billion tons. The company also has subsidiaries in industrial sectors, including finance, media and aviation, and majority stakes in other companies.

Gazprom was created in 1989, when the Soviet Ministry of Gas Industry was converted to a corporation, becoming the first state-run corporate enterprise in the Soviet Union. After the Soviet Union&#x27;s dissolution, Gazprom was privatized, retaining its Russia-based assets. At that time, Gazprom evaded taxes and state regulations and engaged in asset stripping. The company later returned to government control in the early 2000s, and since then, the company has been involved in the Russian government&#x27;s diplomatic efforts, setting of gas prices, and access to pipelines.

The company is majority-owned by the Russian government, via the Federal Agency for State Property Management and Rosneftegaz, while the remaining shares are traded publicly. Gazprom is listed on the Moscow Exchange. Many arbitration cases have been decided against Gazprom.

==History==
===Origins===
In 1943, during World War II, the government of the Soviet Union developed a domestic gas industry. In 1965, it centralized gas exploration, development, and distribution within the Ministry of Gas Industry. In the 1970s and 1980s, the Ministry of Gas Industry found large natural gas reserves in Siberia, the Ural region and the Volga Region. The Soviet Union became a major gas producer. In August 1989, under the leadership of the minister of Gas Industry of the Soviet Union (1985-1989) Viktor Chernomyrdin, the Ministry of Gas Industry was renamed the &quot;State Gas Concern Gazprom&quot;, and became the Soviet Union&#x27;s first state-run corporate enterprise. In late 1991, when the Soviet Union dissolved, gas industry assets were transferred to newly established national companies, such as Naftogaz and Turkmengaz. Gazprom kept assets located in Russia and secured a monopoly in the gas sector.

=== Privatization ===
In December 1992, when Boris Yeltsin, the Russian President, appointed Viktor Chernomyrdin, Gazprom&#x27;s Chairman, his Prime Minister, the company&#x27;s political influence increased. Rem Viakhirev took the chairmanship of Gazprom&#x27;s Board of Directors and Managing Committee. Following the Decree of the President of the Russian Federation of 5 November 1992, and the Resolution of the Government of Russia of 17 February 1993, Gazprom became a joint-stock company. Gazprom began to distribute shares under the voucher method. (Each Russian citizen received vouchers to purchase shares of formerly state-owned companies). By 1994, 33% of Gazprom&#x27;s shares had been bought by 747,000 members of the public, mostly in exchange for vouchers. Fifteen percent of the stock was allocated to Gazprom employees. The state retained 40% of the shares. That amount was gradually lowered to thirty-eight percent. Trading of Gazprom&#x27;s shares was heavily regulated. Foreigners were prohibited from owning more than nine-percent of the shares. In October 1996, 1% of Gazprom&#x27;s equity was offered for sale to foreigners as Global Depository Receipts. In 1997, Gazprom offered a bond issue of US$2.5 billion.

Chernomyrdin, as Prime Minister of Russia, ensured Gazprom avoided tight state regulation. Gazprom evaded taxes, and the Government of Russia received little in dividends. Gazprom managers and board members, such as Chernomyrdin and the Gazprom Chief Executive Officer, Rem Viakhirev, engaged in asset-stripping. Gazprom assets were shared amongst their relatives. Itera, a gas trading company also received Gazprom assets. In March 1998, for reasons unrelated to his activities at Gazprom, Chernomyrdin was fired by Yeltsin. On 30 June 1998, Chernomyrdin was made Chairman of the Board of Directors of Gazprom.

===State control===

When, in June 2000, Vladimir Putin became the President of Russia, he acted to gain control over Russia&#x27;s oligarchs, and increase the Government of Russia&#x27;s control in important companies through a program of national champions. Putin fired Chernomyrdin from his position as the Chairman of the Gazprom board. The Russian Government&#x27;s stock in Gazprom gave Putin the power to vote out Viakhirev. Chernomyrdin and Viakhirev were replaced by Dmitry Medvedev and Alexei Miller. They were Putin&#x27;s prior employees in Saint Petersburg. Putin&#x27;s actions were aided by the shareholder activism of Hermitage Capital Management Chief Executive Officer William Browder, and the former Russian Finance Minister Boris Fyodorov. Miller and Medvedev were to stop asset stripping at Gazprom and to recover losses. Itera was denied access to Gazprom&#x27;s pipelines and came close to bankruptcy. In 2006, Itera agreed to return stolen assets to Gazprom for a fee. Browder was deported from Russia, in 2005, and the Russian arm of Hermitage Capital Management was seized two years later.

In April 2001, Gazprom acquired NTV, Russia&#x27;s only nationwide state-independent television station, from Vladimir Gusinsky&#x27;s company, Media-Most Holdings. Gusinsky fell out of Putin&#x27;s favor after using NTV to publish criticism from the families of sailors who died during the Kursk submarine disaster and additional criticism of Putin&#x27;s handling of the Second Chechen War. Gusinsky then fled Russia allowing Gazprom to take over NTV without his opposition.

In June 2005, Gazprombank, Gazpromivest Holding, Gazfond and Gazprom Finance B. V., subsidiaries of Gazprom, sold a 10.7399% share of their stock for $7 billion to , a state-owned company. Some analysts said the amount paid by Rosneftegaz for the stock was too low. The sale was completed by 25 December 2005. With the purchased stock and the thirty-eight percent share held by the State Property Committee, the Government of Russia gained control of Gazprom. The Government of Russia revoked the Gazprom twenty percent foreign ownership rule and the company became open to foreign investment. In September 2005, Gazprom bought 72.633 percent of the oil company Sibneft for $13.01 billion. Sibneft was renamed Gazprom Neft. The purchase was aided by a $12 billion loan. Gazprom became Russia&#x27;s largest company. On the day of the deal the company worth was valued at £69.7 billion (US$123.2 billion).
In July 2006, &quot;On Gas Export&quot; was enacted with nearly unanimous vote from the State Duma. This law gave Gazprom the exclusive right to export natural gas from Russia. In December 2006, Gazprom signed an agreement with Royal Dutch Shell, Mitsui and Mitsubishi, to take over fifty percent plus one share of Sakhalin Energy.

In June 2007, TNK-BP, a subsidiary of BP plc, agreed to sell its stake in Kovykta field in Siberia to Gazprom after the Government of Russia questioned BP&#x27;s right to export gas from Russia.

On 1 August 2007, Gazprom&#x27;s Sergey Kuprianov threatened Belarus with stoppage of their gas flow if the latter failed to pay off their debts and if so they would experience a 300% price increase. Two days later he saw significant progress towards payment and he expected to be paid by the next week.

On 23 June 2007, the governments of Russia and Italy signed a memorandum of understanding towards a joint venture between Gazprom and Eni SpA to construct a 558-mile (900 km) gas pipeline to carry gas per year from Russia to Europe. This South Stream pipeline would extend under the Black Sea to Bulgaria with a south fork to Italy and a north fork to Hungary.

On 18 December 2007, Frank-Walter Steinmeier (who was then Foreign Minister of Germany) and Dmitry Medvedev signed an agreement on behalf of BASF to exploit another gas field. At the time, German demand was 40% covered by Russian supply. Some German academics warned that Germany had become too dependent of Russia but Steinmeier, citing the new Ostpolitik, disregarded them.

On 11 February 2008 Kuprianov threatened Ukraine with a stoppage of flow; in January 2009 the threat was executed, beginning the 2009 Russia–Ukraine gas dispute. BASF&#x27;s Jürgen Hambrecht was concerned about the reliability of his firm&#x27;s supply but Miller assuaged his worries in a phone call, and the Europeans did nothing to change course for more than a decade.

On 1 December 2014, during a visit to Turkey, Putin said the SouthStream project would not proceed and 63 billion cubic metres per year (bcm/y) of gas would be shipped to Turkey instead of Bulgaria. Bulgaria was being sued by the European Union for signing a contract with Russia, which was not aligned with European Union regulations. The president of Bulgaria, Rosen Plevneliev, pressured the European Union and Russia to quickly resolve the matter.

===Continual rise===


On 4 September 2012, the European Commission announced an anti-trust investigation into Gazprom&#x27;s activities. This was based on &quot;concerns that Gazprom may be abusing its dominant market position in upstream gas supply markets.&quot; In late November 2013, Gazprom expanded its media interests by acquiring &quot;Profmedia&quot; from Vladimir Potanin.

On 21 May 2014, in Shanghai, Gazprom and the China National Petroleum Corporation made a contract worth $400 billion over thirty years. The contract was for Gazprom to deliver 38 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year to China beginning in 2018. In August 2014, construction began with pipes for the Power of Siberia pipeline delivered to Lensk, Yakutia. Russia will start supplying natural gas to China through the Power of Siberia pipeline on 20 December 2019 as part of the two countries&#x27; $400 billion energy pact. Beijing and Moscow are now negotiating over a second Far Eastern gas pipeline.

In June 2014, Gazprom negotiated with the International Petroleum Investment Company (IPIC of Abu Dhabi) over a 24.9 percent stake in the Austrian oil and gas firm OMV. In July 2014, Gazprom acquired Central Partnership, one of the largest film distributors in Russia.

In September 2015 the Nord Stream 2 contracts were signed, and by July 2021 the pipeline was commissioned.

===Loss of EU revenue===
Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the threat by Russia of reducing the supply of gas to Europe risked the Gazprom export market. When it was implemented, exports by Gazprom fell from the 185Bcm achieved in 2021 to 100Bcm in 2022 and fell again in 2023. The revenue of Gazprom, whilst initially supported by high prices collapsed in 2023 resulting in a trading loss and the need to increase the price in the domestic market by 34% over 3 years. Gazprom has also opened itself up to compensation claims for failure to supply gas under long term contracts.

==Supply and reserves==
===Production===
In 2011, Gazprom produced of natural gas, which was 17 percent of the worldwide production and 83 percent of Russian production. Of this amount, the Yamburg subsidiary produced 41 percent, Urengoy 23.6 percent, Nadym 10.9 percent, Noyabrsk 9.3 percent and others 15.2 percent. In addition, the company produced 32.28 million tons of oil and 12.07 million tons of gas condensate.

The majority of Gazprom&#x27;s fields are located in the Nadym-Pur-Taz region (near the Gulf of Ob) in Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug in Western Siberia. Historically, the three largest fields are Medvezhe, Urengoy and Yamburg. After more than twenty years of production, the fields are now in decline. Production from the fields has decreased by twenty to twenty-five bcm per year. The production at Zaporliarnoe, Gazprom&#x27;s fourth largest field, increased until 2004, offsetting the decline in the other fields. Since 2004, Gazprom has maintained production by activating new smaller fields and by purchasing production assets from other companies.

Gazprom Neft produces crude oil. In 2005, Gazprom purchased 75 percent of the Gazprom Neft shares for $13.1 billion.

=== Imports from Central Asia ===
Gazprom&#x27;s ability to supply natural gas to the domestic market and for reexport relied to a large extent on imports from Central Asia. In 2007, Gazprom imported a total of from Central Asia: from Turkmenistan, from Kazakhstan, and from Uzbekistan. In particular, Gazprom purchased seventy-five percent of Turkmenistan gas exports in order to supply gas to Ukraine. In 2008, Gazprom paid $130/mcm to $180/mcm for gas from Central Asia.

===Reserves===
In 2015, Gazprom&#x27;s proved and probable reserves of natural gas were , a 3.8% increase from the 2011 figure which represented 18.4% of the world&#x27;s reserves. In 2015, the reserves of crude oil were 1.355 billion tons and the reserves of gas condensate were 933.3 billion tons. 59.8 percent of Gazprom&#x27;s natural gas reserves (Categories A+B+C1) were located in the Urals Federal District (decreasing), 20.5 percent in the Arctic shelf (increasing), and 8.3 percent in the Southern Federal District and North Caucasus Federal District.

==Development and exploration==
Gazprom invested about 480 billion rubles ($20 billion) in new major projects in order to maintain supply. Nearly 37 percent of Gazprom&#x27;s reserves are located in the Yamal Peninsula and in the Barents Sea.

===Blue Stream Pipeline===

One of Gazprom&#x27;s major projects is the Blue Stream Pipeline. The Blue Stream Pipeline delivers natural gas to Turkey via the Black Sea. In 1997, the Blue Stream Pipeline agreement between Turkey and Russia was signed. In 2000, the first joint was welded. The pipeline transports 16 billion cubic meters each year.

===Yamal Peninsula===

Exploration of the Yamal peninsula has found reserves of over 10 trillion cubic metres of natural gas and over 500 million tons of oil and gas condensate. About 60 percent of these reserves are located in Bovanenkovo, Kharasavey and Novoportovo. The natural gas production capacity of the Bovanenkovo field was estimated to be , with potential to increase to . 
===Shtokman field===

The Shtokman field is one of the world&#x27;s largest natural gas fields. It is located in the central part of the Barents Sea, northeast of the city of Murmansk and west of the Yamal Peninsula. The field is estimated to contain up to of gas. Potential production is in the initial phases, with a potential increase to . Gazprom, TotalEnergies (France) and Statoil (Norway) created a joint company Shtokman Development AG for development of the field.

===Khanty-Mansiysk autonomous area (Arctic shelf)===
In 2013, in Amsterdam, Alexey Miller, chairman of the Gazprom management committee, and Jorma Ollila, chairman of the board of directors of Royal Dutch Shell, signed in the presence of Putin and Mark Rutte, prime minister of the Netherlands, a memorandum outlining the principles of cooperation within hydrocarbons exploration and development in the Arctic shelf and a section of the deep-water shelf.
===Exploration===
In 2008, Gazprom carried out of explorative well drilling; of 2D seismic and of 3D seismic survey. As a result, gas reserves grew by , and crude oil and gas condensate reserves grew by 61 million tons.

Gazprom carries out prospecting and exploration in foreign countries such as India, Pakistan, Algeria, Venezuela, Vietnam, Libya, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan.

==Transportation==

Gazprom&#x27;s Unified Gas Supply System (UGSS) includes of gas trunklines and branches and 218 compressor stations with a 41.4 GW capacity. The UGSS is the largest gas transmission system in the world. In 2008, the transportation system carried of gas. Gazprom has claimed the UGSS has reached its capacity. Major transmission projects included the Nord Stream pipelines, as well as pipelines inside Russia.

=== Liquefied Natural Gas ===
In 2021 Russia had two large liquefied natural gas (LNG) production plants, Yamal LNG and Sakhalin-2 LNG both of which Gazprom has an interest in. 

In March 2021, the Russian Government authorised a long-term programme to develop and expand the liquefied natural gas industry in Russia with nine more LNG plants, to address the growing global LNG market. 

In August 2021 Russia&#x27;s first LNG bunkering vessel, &quot;Dmitry Mendeleev&quot;, was completed for Gazprom.

In October 2021, Gazprom and RusGazDobycha announced they would build a new plant, Baltic LNG, at Ust-Luga, with access to the Baltic Sea for sea transportation westward. It would process ethane-containing natural gas with a capacity of 13 million tons of LNG per year.

In 2024, Gazprom faced a significant shortage of LNG tankers, leading the company to use the Marshal Vasilevskiy floating storage and regasification unit (FSRU) for exporting LNG from its Portovaya facility. This shortage occurred because Gazprom&#x27;s regular tankers, such as the Pskov, were involved in extended voyages to Asia, avoiding the Suez Canal and Red Sea due to security threats from Houthi attacks.

==Sales==
In 2006, Gazprom sold of gas to domestic customers; to the rest of Europe; and to CIS countries and the Baltic states. Gazprom received about 60 percent of its revenue from its sales to European customers. In 2008, the average gas price paid by Russian industrial customers was $71/mcm, while households paid $54/mcm.

Since 2000, Natural gas prices have fluctuated. In late 2007, the price of natural gas at the New York NYMEX was . At a conversion of 26,4 m3 per million Btu it would correspond to a price of $285 per 1,000 cubic metres. At the same time, based on their respective contracts with Gazprom, German customers paid $250 per cubic metre (m3), Polish customers $290 per m3, Ukraine customers $130 per m3 and Russian customers $49 per m3.

Since the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and as a result of falling export revenue, the domestic market will see price rises of 34% by July 2025.

=== Exports ===
Gazprom delivered gas to 25 European countries. Its main export arm is Gazprom Export LLC, founded in 1973 and before 1 November 2006 known as Gazexport, which has a monopoly on gas exports to countries outside of the former Soviet Union. The majority of Russian gas in Europe was sold on 25-year contracts. In late 2004, Gazprom was the sole gas supplier to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Estonia, Finland, Macedonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Serbia and Slovakia. It provided 97 percent of Bulgaria&#x27;s gas, 89 percent of Hungary&#x27;s gas, 86 percent of Poland&#x27;s gas, nearly 75 percent of the Czech Republic&#x27;s, 67 percent of Turkey&#x27;s, 65 percent of Austria&#x27;s, about 40 percent of Romania&#x27;s, 36 percent of Germany&#x27;s, 27 percent of Italy&#x27;s, and 25 percent of France&#x27;s gas. By December 2010 with strong support from Alexander Medvedev and Antonio Fallico, who was Russia&#x27;s honorary consul in Verona, a former Italian communist and a close associate of both Alexey Anatolievich Matveev (; born 21 December 1963) and Vladimir Putin, Italy&#x27;s gas supplied by Russia had greatly increased from 25 percent in 2004 to 70 percent. In May 2006, the European Union received about 25 percent of its gas supply from Gazprom. In 2006, Gazprom entered several long term gas contracts with European companies. The contract prices were mainly linked to oil prices.

In 2014, Europe was the source of 40% of Gazprom&#x27;s revenue. The proportion of Europe&#x27;s gas bought in the spot market rose from 15 percent in 2008 to 44 percent in 2012.

In September 2013, during the G20 summit, Gazprom signed an agreement with CNPC that the Henry Hub index would not be used to settle prices for their trades. In May 2014, Putin met with Xi Jinping and negotiated a $400bn deal between Gazprom and CNPC. Under the contract, Russia was to supply 38 billion cubic meters of gas annually over 30 years at a cost of $350 per thousand cubic meters beginning in 2018. In 2013, the average price of Gazprom&#x27;s gas in Europe was about $380 per thousand cubic meters. China offered a loan of about $50bn to finance development of the gas fields and the construction of the pipeline by Russia up to the Chinese border, with the Chinese to build the remaining pipeline.

In January 2023, as a result of the sanctions imposed on Russia (as a result of the invasion of Ukraine in 2022), Gazprom announced its exports of gas fell 45% from 185Bcm to 101Bcm, mainly due to the loss of the European market. During 2023 exports fell again, with Europe purchasing just 28Bcm, a level not seen since the 1970&#x27;s.

===Price disputes===
On 1 January 2006 during the Russia-Ukraine gas dispute, Gazprom ceased the supply of gas to the Ukrainian market. Gazprom called on the government of Ukraine to increase its payment for natural gas in line with increases in global fuel prices. During the night of 3 January 2006, and early morning of 4 January 2006, Naftogas of Ukraine and Gazprom negotiated a deal that temporarily resolved the long-standing gas price conflict between Russia and Ukraine.

On 3 April 2006, Gazprom announced it would triple the price of natural gas to Belarus after 31 December 2006. In December 2006, Gazprom threatened to cease supply of gas to Belarus at 10 am Moscow time on 1 January 2007, unless Belarus increased payments from $47 to $200 per 1,000 cubic metres or to cede control over its distribution network. Some analysts suggested Moscow was penalising Alexander Lukashenko, the President of Belarus, for not delivering on pledges of closer integration with Russia, while others noted that other countries like Armenia were paying as much for their gas as Belarus would with the new price levels.

Gazprom later requested a price of $105, yet Belarus still refused the agreement. Belarus responded that if supplies were cut, it would deny Gazprom access to its pipelines, which would impair gas transportation to Europe. However, on 1 January 2007, just a few hours before the deadline, Belarus and Gazprom signed a last-minute agreement. Under the agreement, Belarus undertook to pay $100 per 1,000 cubic metre in 2007. The agreement also allowed Gazprom to purchase 50 percent of the shares in Beltransgaz, the Belarusian pipeline network. Immediately following the signing of this agreement, Belarus declared a $42/ton transportation tax on Russian oil travelling through the Gazprom pipelines crossing its territory.

On 13 March 2008, after a three-day period where gas supplies to Ukraine were halved, Gazprom agreed to supply Ukraine with gas for the rest of the year. The contract removed intermediary companies.

On 1 April 2014, Gazprom increased the gas price charged to Ukraine from $268.50 to $385.50 (£231.00) per 1,000 cubic metres. Ukraine&#x27;s unpaid gas bills to Russia stood at $1.7bn (£1.02bn). On 30 October 2014, Russia agreed to resume gas supplies to Ukraine over the winter in a deal brokered by the European Union.

==Corporate affairs==
Gazprom is a vertically integrated company, one which owns its supply and distribution activities. Gazprom owns all its main gas processing facilities in Russia. It operates Russia&#x27;s high pressure gas pipelines and since 2006, it has held a legal export monopoly. Other natural gas producers, such as Novatek, Russia&#x27;s second largest gas company, are forced to use Gazprom&#x27;s facilities for processing and transport of natural gas.


At the end of 2008, Gazprom had 221,300 employees in its major gas production, transportation, underground storage and processing subsidiaries. Of these employees, 9.5 percent were in management, 22.9 percent were specialists, 63.4 percent were workers and 4.2 percent were other employees. Gazprom&#x27;s headquarters were in the Cheryomushki District, South-Western Administrative Okrug, Moscow until 2021, when they moved to the Lakhta Centre in Saint Petersburg.

Gazprom is a &quot;national champion&quot;, a concept advocated by Putin, in which large companies in strategic sectors are expected not only to seek profit, but also to advance Russia&#x27;s national interests. For example, Gazprom sells gas to its domestic market at a price less than that of the global market. In 2008, Gazprom&#x27;s activities made up 10 percent of the Russian gross domestic product

Due to its large projects, including international pipes like Nord Stream 1 and Turkish Stream, Gazprom used to be a substantial source of revenue for several domestic suppliers and contractors.

=== Shareholders ===
, Gazprom&#x27;s main shareholders were the Federal Agency for State Property Management with 38.37% and Rosneftegaz with 10.97%. Together with a 0.89 share of Rosgazifikatsiya, they guaranteed a majority control of the company by the Russian government. The rest of the shares were held by investors, including 25.20% by ADR holders on foreign stock markets, and 24.57% by other legal entities and individuals.

Gazprom is listed on the stock markets of Moscow and Karachi. It is the top component of the MICEX and RTS indices. Gazprom used to be listed on the London, Berlin, Frankfurt and Singapore markets before the 2022 sanctions.

===Subsidiaries===

Gazprom has several hundred subsidiaries in Russia and abroad which are owned and controlled directly or indirectly by the company. It has incorporated a subsidiary in the United Kingdom, named Gazprom International UK Ltd, and the Netherlands, named Gazprom International Projects BV.

==Sports sponsorships==
Gazprom is the owner and sponsor of the Russian Premier League football club FC Zenit Saint Petersburg and its other sporting departments (Basketball and volleyball), as well as volleyball club VC Zenit-Kazan and Gazprom-Ugra Surgut at Russian Volleyball Super League. Gazprom also owns SKA St Petersburg of the KHL.

On 1 January 2007, Gazprom became the sponsor of the German Bundesliga club FC Schalke 04 at a cost of up to €25 million per year. On 23 November 2009, the partnership was extended for a further five years. Schalke then suspended their sponsorship of Gazprom after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The sponsorship was worth $150m (USD) over five years.

On 9 July 2010, Gazprom became a sponsor of the Serbian SuperLiga football club Red Star Belgrade. In 2010, Gazprom was a &quot;Gold Partner&quot; of the Russian professional cycling team, Team Katusha, together with Itera, and Russian Technologies (Rostekhnologii). 

On 17 July 2012, Gazprom became the official &quot;Global Energy&quot; partner of the UEFA Champions League 2012 winners Chelsea. The sponsorship continued for three years to 2015.

In September 2013, Gazprom became an official partner of FIFA tournaments from 2015 to 2018. The contract included the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia.

Gazprom also was a sponsor for the defunct-Minardi F1 team in 2002–2003.

In April 2021, Gazprom became a sponsor of the International Amateur Boxing Association (AIBA, now the International Boxing Association) as &quot;general partner&quot;. The sponsorship became controversial due to the IBA&#x27;s increased Russian ties under president Umar Kremlev. This partnership ended in 2023. 

On 9 July 2012, Gazprom became a sponsor of the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Super Cup. The sponsorship continued for three seasons until 2015. In 2021, the partnership was also extended until 2024. The company was also set to serve as the global partner for UEFA Euro 2020 and 2024; however, due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Gazprom&#x27;s sponsorship for the Champions League and Euro 2024 was voided, marking the end of their 10-year partnership with UEFA.

==Environmental record==
Gazprom is one of the worlds largest greenhouse gas emitters if use of its products are included. A large part of greenhouse gas emissions by Russia are from methane leaks and its many gas-fired power plants.

==Controversies==

=== Geopolitical leverage ===

Repeatedly, Gazprom has been accused of being a political and economical weapon of Russia, using the supply and price of natural gas to gain control over Europe and most noteworthy, Ukraine. “Regardless of how the stand-off over Ukraine develops, one lesson is clear: excessive dependence on Russian energy makes Europe weak,” said Donald Tusk, former prime minister of Poland in April 2014. The friction resulted in two boycott campaigns in Ukraine, one that started in 2005, the other in 2013. Russia denies weaponizing energy via Gazprom. In December 2019, Gazprom paid $2.9 billion to Ukrainian counterpart Naftogaz as ordered by a Stockholm court ruling’s award on damage claims stemming from alleged economical harassment.

In the wake of the 2022 Russian Invasion of Ukraine Gazprom had issues with many EU countries, and stated it would cut off supplies to French energy supplier, Engie, over failure to pay in full for deliveries. This was disputed, with France&#x27;s Energy Transition Minister Agnes Pannier-Runacher stating, &quot;Very clearly Russia is using gas as a weapon of war and we must prepare for the worst case scenario of a complete interruption of supplies.&quot;

===Yukos Oil fraud===
Yuganskneftegaz was the core production subsidiary of the Yukos Oil Company, which was previously run by a Russian businessman, Mikhail Khodorkovsky. In 2003, the Russian tax authorities charged Yukos and Khodorkovsky with tax evasion. On 14 April 2004, Yukos was presented with a bill for over US$35 bn in back taxes and a demand to pay the entire bill the same day. Requests by Yukos to defer payment, allow payment by installments or to discharge the debt by sale of peripheral assets, including its shareholding in the Sibneft oil company, were also refused.

The bailiffs froze Yukos&#x27; shares in Yuganskneftegaz and on 19 November 2004, they placed a notice in the Russian government newspaper &quot;Rossiyskaya Gazeta&quot;. Yuganskneftegaz would be sold at an auction thirty days later on 19 December 2004. The conditions for participation in the auction included an advance deposit of US$1.7 bn and prior clearance by the Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service. In early December 2004, Gazprom submitted an application to participate in the auction via its wholly owned subsidiary, Gazpromneft.

On 15 December 2004, Yukos filed for bankruptcy protection in a Houston court and obtained a temporary injunction prohibiting Gazprom from participating in the auction. On 16 December 2004, a group of Western banks withdrew their financial support for Gazprom&#x27;s application. On the same day, Baikalfinansgrup, a previously unknown company, applied to participate in the auction.

On 19 December 2004, only two companies appeared at the auction, Gazpromneft and Baikalfinansgrup. Gazpromneft declined to place any offer. Baikalfinansgrup acquired Yuganskneftegaz on its first bid. On 23 December 2004, Baikalfinansgrup was acquired by Rosneft. Rosneft later disclosed in its annual financial statement that it had financed the acquisition of Yuganskneftegaz. At the time, Sergey Bogdanchikov was the president of Rosneft and the chief executive officer of Gazpromneft.

Shortly after the auction, the planned merger between Gazprom and Rosneft was abandoned, and Bogdanchikov resigned his post as chief executive officer of Gazpromneft.

On 7 February 2006, in response to a question by a Spanish journalist, Vladimir Putin disclosed that Rosneft had used Baikalfinansgrup as a vehicle to acquire Yuganskneftegaz in order to protect itself against litigation.

=== Antitrust ===
On 22 April 2015, Gazprom was charged by the European Commission with using territorial restrictions to engage in anticompetitive behavior and using its dominant position to impose unfair prices. The company was accused of preventing competition in Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Slovakia. The territorial restrictions prevented the import of gas at potentially more competitive prices. The restrictions also prevented gas from reaching areas of high demand and avoiding areas of excessive supply. Gazprom was also accused of compelling entities to consent to the now defunct South Stream pipeline by necessitating a consent clause in long term contracts.

In 2018, Gazprom agreed to a settlement which involved dropping all contractual barriers to the free flow of gas in Central and Eastern European gas markets and to take various steps to improve economic cooperation. Customers would be given an explicit contractual right to trigger a price review when prices paid diverged from competitive price benchmarks, and be allowed more frequent and efficient price reviews. Gazprom agreed to not seek any damages from its Bulgarian partners following the termination of the South Stream project. Had the case gone to court, the company could have been forced to pay fines of up to $12 billion.

In 2020, Gazprom agreed to reimburse Poland&#x27;s PGNiG close to $1.5 billion for years of compelling it to overpay for its gas supply.

=== Methane leaks ===
In June 2021, a massive methane plume over Russia resulted from the partial shutdown of a Gazprom PJSC pipeline for emergency repair. The company said the repairs, which took place on 4 June, released 2.7 million cubic meters (1,830 metric tons) of methane. That amount has roughly the same short term planet-warming impact of 40,000 internal-combustion cars in the U.S. driving for a year, according to the Environmental Defense Fund. The climate warming effect of methane is judged to be 86-times more powerful than carbon dioxide.

=== Nord Stream pipelines ===
Nord Stream is a system of offshore natural gas pipelines in Europe, running under the Baltic Sea from Russia to Germany. The pipelines are owned and operated by subsidiaries of Gazprom. The Nord Stream projects have been fiercely opposed by the United States and Ukraine, as well as by other Central and Eastern European countries, because of concerns that the pipelines would increase Russia&#x27;s influence in Europe, and because of the knock-on reduction of transit fees for use of the existing pipelines in Central and Eastern European countries. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz suspended certification of Nord Stream 2 on 22 February 2022 because Vladimir Putin led Russia to recognize the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine as independent republics. On 2 March 2022, it was reported that Nord Stream 2 AG, a Gazprom subsidiary, had ended business operations and laid off all 106 members of its staff as a result of International sanctions, though earlier reports that it had filed for bankruptcy were denied.

On 26 September 2022, a severe drop in pressure in both NS1 and NS2 was associated with a rupture in both pipes due to sabotage.

===Greenpeace protest against Arctic drilling===
Gazprom&#x27;s oil drilling in the Arctic has drawn protests from environmental groups, particularly Greenpeace. Greenpeace has opposed oil drilling in the Arctic on the grounds that oil drilling damages the Arctic ecosystem and that there are no safety plans in place to prevent oil spills.

In August 2012, Greenpeace had staged protests against the Prirazlomnaya oil platform, the world&#x27;s first offshore Arctic drill site. On 18 September 2013, the Greenpeace vessel MV &quot;Arctic Sunrise&quot; staged a protest and attempted to board Gazprom&#x27;s Prirazlomnaya oil platform. Greenpeace stated that the drill site could cause massive disruption to the Arctic ecosystem. After arresting two campaigners attempting to climb the rig, the Russian Coast Guard seized control of the Greenpeace ship by dropping down from a helicopter and arresting thirty Greenpeace activists. &quot;Arctic Sunrise&quot; was towed by the Russian Coast Guard to Murmansk.

The Russian government intended to charge the Greenpeace campaigners with piracy and hooliganism, which carried a maximum penalty of fifteen years imprisonment. Greenpeace argued their operatives were in international waters. The Russian government&#x27;s actions generated protests from governments and environmentalists worldwide. According to Phil Radford, Executive Director of Greenpeace in the US at the time, the reaction of the Russian Coast Guard and the courts were the &quot;stiffest response that Greenpeace has encountered from a government since the bombing of the Rainbow Warrior in 1985.&quot; The charges of piracy were dropped in October 2013. In November 2013, 27 of the 30 activists were released on bail.

In May 2014, the first shipment of Arctic oil arrived at a refinery in the Netherlands and was purchased by the French company, TotalEnergies.

The episode is portrayed in the 3-hour television documentary &quot;On Thin Ice: Putin v Greenpeace&quot;.

=== Sanctions ===
Following Russia&#x27;s continued aggression towards Ukraine, the US tightened its debt financing restrictions on Gazprombank on 17 July 2014. On 12 September 2014, the United States barred U.S. persons from selling goods and services to Gazprom and Gazprom Neft in connection with certain deepwater, Arctic offshore and shale projects. On 31 July 2014, the EU placed financial restrictions on Gazprombank. On 8 September 2014, the EU placed financial restrictions on Gazprom Neft.

In April 2018, the United States placed CEO Alexey Miller among the Specially Designated Nationals. This sanction bars U.S. individuals and entities from having any dealings with him. Entities outside U.S. jurisdiction may also face punishment if the U.S. government deems they are aiding a sanctioned entity. Miller himself claimed to be proud of the sanction: “Not being included in the first list I even had some doubts – may be something is wrong (with me)? But I am finally included. This means that we are doing everything right,” Miller said through his spokesman.

In December 2019, the U.S. sanctioned firms involved in the Nord Stream 2 project.

On 24 February 2022, upon the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the U.S. expanded penalties on Nord Stream 2 AG, a subsidiary of Gazprom, and sanctioned its CEO Matthias Warnig. It also expanded debt and equity prohibitions against Gazprombank, Gazprom, and Gazprom Neft. In addition, following the invasion, in March 2022 the European Union formally approved a ban on investments in the Russian energy sector, including Gazprom Neft. 

The UK banned Gazprom from its debt and equity markets on 2 March 2022, sanctioned Gazprombank on 24 March 2022, and Gazprom board members on 1 March 2023. Gazprom Energy, a UK firm, stated that &quot;supplies 20.8% of non-domestic gas volume in Great Britain. We source our gas through commodity exchanges in exactly the same way as our competitors and we do not depend on gas supplies from Russia.&quot;

; Effect of sanctions
2022, due to economic sanctions, Gazprom took the unprecedented step of suspending dividends for the first time since 1998.

On 18 July 2022, amid the Nord Stream 1 maintenance period, Gazprom sent a letter declaring &quot;force majeure,&quot; declaring that due to extraordinary circumstances it could not guarantee a gas supply. On 26 September 2022 there was a rupture in both pipes due to sabotage.

In the first half of 2022 Gazprom made high profits, roughly equalling the profit for the whole of 2021, due to high prices. In the second half of 2022 and into 2023 Gazprom probably did not make a profit at all as a result of falling exports. Overall Gazprom made a profit of 1.226 trillion roubles ($15.77 billion) in 2022, down 40%, after an extra tax was levied in late 2022.

On 19 December 2022 the European Energy ministers agreed on a price cap for natural Gas at €180 per megawatt-hour aiming to stop Russia forcing European gas prices upwards.

Exports of gas by Gazprom from Russia in 2021 was 185Bcm, in 2022 it fell by 45% to 100Bcm and in 2023 it fell again to 62Bcm.

===Private army===

In February 2023 Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin signed an order giving Gazprom Neft the right to form its own private army.

===Reducing and ceasing supplies to gas companies===
After the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine and the west introducing sanctions, western gas companies continued to pay, normally Gazprom Bank accounts in euros and dollars, which meant that the funds became blocked by sanctions. On 31 March, President Vladimir Putin signed a decree − , requiring payment to be made by alternate means. A number of western companies refused to pay except in accordance with their contracts, accordingly Gazprom ceased supply to those companies. There had also been cases of short delivery by Gazprom. This created the 2022–2023 Russia–European Union gas dispute

Arbitration cases through the International Court of Arbitration have been started by a number of western companies with long term contracts, for damages due to short supply or cessation of supplies in breach of Gazprom&#x27;s contractual obligations, including Germany&#x27;s Uniper, who is claiming €11.6 billion compensation from Gazprom and Engie which opened proceedings in February 2023 for short delivery,

Gazprom went to arbitration for €300m for unpaid gas from Gasum in Finland, which arbitration decided was payable, but not in rubles.

India&#x27;s GAIL is also seeking compensation through a London arbitration court over Gazprom&#x27;s short delivery of LNG to India which were disrupted by sanctions against a Gazprom subsidiary in Germany.

<text>Pikk Hermann (Estonian ; ) is a tower of the Toompea Castle, on Toompea (Domberg) hill in Tallinn (Reval), the capital of Estonia. The first part of the tower was built in 1360–1370. It was rebuilt (height brought to ) in the 16th century. A staircase with 215 steps now leads to the top of the tower. It consists of ten internal floors and a viewing platform at the top.

Pikk Hermann is situated next to the building of the Estonian parliament (&quot;Riigikogu&quot;). The flag on the top of the tower at above sea level is one of the main symbols of the national government in force. 
The national flag, a blue-black-white tricolour measuring by , is raised and the national anthem is played at the time of sunrise (or at 7 am, whichever is later) and lowered at the time of sunset. While it is lowered, the melody of &quot;Mu isamaa on minu arm&quot; (My Fatherland Is My Love) is heard. For the first time, the national flag was raised to the top of Pikk Hermann in 1918, when Estonia became an independent country.

<doc id="320492" wikidata="Q4920406" url="?curid=320492" title="Black Bottom, Detroit">
<text>Black Bottom was a predominantly black neighborhood in Detroit, Michigan. The term has sometimes been used to apply to the entire neighborhood including Paradise Valley, but many consider the two neighborhoods to be separate. Together, Black Bottom and Paradise Valley were bounded by Brush Street to the west, the Grand Trunk railroad tracks to the east, south to the Detroit River, and bisected by Gratiot Avenue. The area north of Gratiot Avenue to Grand Boulevard was defined as Paradise Valley.

Although the name &quot;Black Bottom&quot; is often erroneously believed to be a reference to the African-American community that developed in the 20th century, the neighborhood was actually named by early French colonial settlers for the dark, fertile topsoil found in the area (known as river bottomland). During World War I, Black Bottom was home to many Eastern European Jewish immigrants, and the Great Migration influx of southern African Americans combined with redlining created a majority black neighborhood within Detroit. As the Black Bottom grew, it became a lively area with jazz bars and nightclubs. From the 1930s to the 1950s, residents in Black Bottom made significant contributions to American music, including blues, Big Band, and jazz.

Despite the rich cultural and musical hub of Black Bottom, the neighborhood was plagued with urban poverty. Most of Black Bottom&#x27;s residents were employed in manufacturing and the automotive factory jobs. Some black business owners and clergymen operating in the neighborhood were able to rise to the middle class, however many moved to the newer and better-constructed Detroit West Side neighborhoods. Historical lack of access for the general population of African Americans to New Deal and Veterans Administration housing benefits combined with redlining segregated the neighborhoods from surrounding areas.

In the early 1960s, the Black Bottom and Paradise Valley neighborhoods were demolished for the purpose of slum clearance and to make way for the construction of I-375. Homes and businesses were demolished, and residents relocated to outside neighborhoods.&lt;ref name=&quot;then/now&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
Historically, the primary business district was in an area bounded by Vernor, John R., Madison, and Hastings, with Gratiot Avenue running through the district as a &quot;spoke&quot; on the &quot;hub-and-spoke&quot; road layout of Detroit. The business district included hotels, restaurants, music stores, bowling alleys, shops, policy offices, and grocery stores. There were 17 nightclubs in the business district. The sunken I-375 highway passes directly over where Hastings Avenue once was.

==History==

Historically, this geographical area was the source of the River Savoyard, which was buried as a sewer in 1827. The river&#x27;s flooding produced rich bottomland soils, for which early French colonial settlers named the area &quot;Black Bottom&quot;. Before World War I, European immigrants populated the area and built the frame houses.

In the early 20th century, European immigrants and blacks lived together in an ad-hoc integrated neighborhood. Coleman Young, the first black mayor of Detroit, moved to Black Bottom with his family in 1923; he states his neighbors as Italian, Syrian, German, and Jewish. Young is quoted as having &quot;loved that neighborhood.&quot; Surrounding neighborhoods passed restrictive covenants prohibiting blacks from purchasing or renting property in the adjacent areas, functionally confining residents to Black Bottom. During the Great Migration, the area was primarily settled by blacks who established a community of businesses, social institutions, and night clubs. Detroit&#x27;s Broadway Avenue Historic District contains a sub-district sometimes called the &quot;Harmonie Park District.&quot; It is associated with the legacy of Detroit&#x27;s music from the 1930s-1950s.

The area&#x27;s main commercial avenues were Hastings and St. Antoine streets. Paradise Valley contained night clubs where famous artists such as Billie Holiday, Sam Cooke, Ella Fitzgerald, Duke Ellington, Billy Eckstine, Pearl Bailey, and Count Basie regularly performed. In 1941, Orchestra Hall was named &quot;Paradise Theatre&quot;. Reverend C. L. Franklin, father of singer Aretha Franklin, originally established his New Bethel Baptist Church on Hastings Street.

Black Bottom was one of the poorest and densest sections of Detroit, with a third of black Detroiters living within Paradise Valley. Homes commonly held three to four families within the dwelling. Overcrowding, disease, crime, and vermin ran rampant. Income inequality and redlining contributed to deferred housing upkeep and maintenance, which further deteriorated housing conditions.

Following World War II, two-thirds of the physical structures of Black Bottom had been classified as aging and substandard, lacking modern amenities, or sitting in significant disrepair. The city government considered these areas slums and designated those remaining after the highway construction for clearance through a series of revitalization projects. Areas of both Black Bottom and Paradise Valley faced destruction for the construction of medical and city-run institutions, as well as public housing projects. The passage of the Federal Housing Act of 1949 funded demolition. The city of Detroit sent photographers out to document structures. The photographs are now housed in the Burton Historical Collection at the Detroit Public Library. By 1950, 423 residences, 109 businesses, 22 manufacturing plants, and 93 vacant lots had been condemned for the freeway project.

The Federal Highway Act of 1956 funded the highway construction over Hastings Street and surrounding city blocks. The highways, such as the Chrysler Freeway (formerly Oakland-Hastings), bisected the rest of the Lower East Side, including Paradise Valley and Black Bottom. The Edsel Ford Freeway also cut through the northernmost part of Paradise Valley.

The sites of Black Bottom and Paradise Valley were replaced with private housing from the Gratiot Redevelopment Project. The city also supported construction of Lafayette Park, a modernist residential development designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, intended as a model neighborhood containing residential townhouses, apartments and high-rises with commercial areas. Many of the former residents of Black Bottom were relocated to public housing projects, such as the Brewster-Douglass Housing Projects (a public housing project built near Black Bottom starting in the 1930s) and Jeffries Homes. Jeffries Homes was demolished in 2001, and Brewster-Douglass was demolished in 2008.

In 2000, the final three structures of Paradise Valley were razed. A Michigan Historical Site marker sign on the former intersection of Adams Avenue and St. Antoine St., currently near Ford Field, exists as the last physical marker of the neighborhood. Architect Emily Kutil plans to recreate the neighborhood virtually, using photos from the Detroit Public Library&#x27;s Burton Historical Collection, through a website called Black Bottom Street View. The website will purportedly also feature oral histories from past residents.

The University of Michigan and Bedrock Detroit previously announced a new project at 1400 S. Antoine St. (at the intersection of Gratiot Ave. and I-375) for a 190,000 square feet structure including &quot;residential units, a hotel, a conference center and a business collaboration and incubation space.&quot; Project funders included Stephen M. Ross and Dan Gilbert. Professor Stephen Ward of the University of Michigan&#x27;s Department of Afro-American studies challenged the project; signing a Change.org petition entitled &quot;#UMichRegentrifiers: Invest in Detroiters&quot; which was created by a University of Michigan student opposing the project. This project was cancelled and moved to a different location downtown in 2021. The site remains empty with no concrete plans as of early 2024.

In September 2022, the Federal Highway Administration awarded Detroit a $104-million grant for the I-375 project which would demolish the current 1.062 mile-long sunken highway to construct a proposed lower speed boulevard at street-level. This project is slated to start construction in 2025. This project will reconnect neighborhood streets cut off by the sunken highway for decades.

<text>Romania is a sovereign state located in Southeastern Europe. Following rapid economic growth in the early 2000s, Romania has an economy predominantly based on services, and is a producer and net exporter of machines and electric energy, featuring companies like Automobile Dacia and OMV Petrom. It has been a member of NATO since 2004, and part of the European Union since 2007. A strong majority of the population identify themselves as Eastern Orthodox Christians and are native speakers of Romanian, a Romance language. The cultural history of Romania is often referred to when dealing with influential artists, musicians, inventors and sportspeople. For similar reasons, Romania has been the subject of notable tourist attractions.
