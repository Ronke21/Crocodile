<text>Pedro González de Mendoza (3 May 1428 – 11 January 1495) was a Spanish cardinal, statesman and lawyer. He served on the council of King Henry IV of Castile and in 1467 fought for him at the Second Battle of Olmedo. In 1468 he was named bishop of Sigüenza and in 1473 he became cardinal and archbishop of Seville and appointed chancellor of Castile. 

In the subsequent succession dispute, Mendoza supported Isabel&#x27;s right to succeed her brother, Enrique IV, and participated in the battle of Toro, where the forces of Ferdinand and Isabella defeated the supporters of Juana la Beltraneja. Mendoza&#x27;s Castilian chancellorship was reconfirmed by Isabel, and in 1482 he became cardinal-archbishop of Toledo and Primate of Spain. He presided over the royal council for 20 years and his influence was such that he was called &quot;the Third King&quot; during the reign of Isabel and Ferdinand.

== Biography ==
Pedro González de Mendoza was born on 3 May 1428 at Guadalajara in New Castile. He was the fifth son of Íñigo López de Mendoza and Catalina Suarez de Figueroa. The Mendoza family was the most powerful noble family in Spain at the time.

González de Mendoza remained in Guadalajara until 1442 when he was sent to Toledo to continue his education under the auspices of Archbishop Gutierre Álvarez de Toledo. In Toledo he studied rhetoric, history and Latin. While still a teenager he was granted several ecclesiastical benefices, including the parish of Santa María in the town of Hita and the archdeacon of Guadalajara. When the archbishop died in 1446, he moved to the University of Salamanca, where he studied civil and canon law and earned doctorates in both by 1452.

In 1452 he joined the court of Juan II of Castile as a member of the Royal Chapel. As a result of his influential family and status as chaplain to the king, Mendoza was soon appointed to his first bishopric: in 1453 he was selected by Juan II to become Bishop of Calahorra. The pope later confirmed his election and Mendoza was consecrated in 1454 by Alfonso Carrillo de Acuña, the Archbishop of Toledo.

As Bishop of Calahorra he was also &quot;señor&quot;, or civil and military ruler, of the town and its dependent district. In his secular capacity he led the levies of Calahorra in the civil wars of the reign of Henry IV. He fought for the king at the second battle of Olmedo on 20 August 1467 and was wounded in the arm.

During these years he became attached to Mencia de Lemos, a Portuguese lady-in-waiting of the Consort queen. They had two sons, Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar Mendoza, who was once selected to be the husband of Lucrezia Borgia, and Diego Hurtado de Mendoza, 1st Count of Melito who became the grandfather of the princess of Eboli of the reign of Philip II of Spain (see Antonio Perez).

By Inés de Tovar, a lady of a Valladolid family, he had a third son (Juan Hurtado de Mendoza y Tovar) who afterwards emigrated to France.

In 1467 Pedro became Bishop of Sigüenza. In 1473 he was created cardinal, was promoted to the Archdiocese of Seville and named chancellor of Castile. During the last years of the reign of King Henry IV. he was the partisan of the Princess Isabella, afterwards queen, while his eldest brother Diego Hurtado de Mendoza, 2nd marquis of Santillana, remained however faithful to king Henry IV of Castile, till his death in December 1474.

Pedro, the cadet brother, fought for her at the Battle of Toro on 1 March 1476, when King Henry IV had died already. He had a prominent part in placing her on the throne; and served her indefatigably in her efforts to suppress the disorderly nobles of Castile. In 1482 he became Archbishop of Toledo.

When his oldest brother and head of the whole family, Diego, swore allegiance to Princess Isabella after Henry&#x27;s death in December 1474, he was duly rewarded by Queen Isabella I of Castile, awarding Diego the title of Duke of the Infantado on 22 July 1475. The title would be awarded the Grandee of Spain in 1519 by king Charles I of Spain.

During the conquest of Granada, Pedro contributed largely to the maintenance of the army. On 2 January 1492, he occupied the town in the name of the Catholic sovereigns. Though his life was worldly, and though he was more soldier and statesman than priest, the &quot;Great Cardinal&quot;, as he was commonly called, did not neglect his duty as a bishop. He used his influence with the queen and also at Rome to arrange a settlement of the disputes between the Spanish sovereigns and the papacy. He was also an advocate of Christopher Columbus.

Though he maintained a splendid household as archbishop of Toledo, and, provided handsomely for his children, he devoted part of his revenue to charity, and with a part he endowed the Palacio de Santa Cruz for a college of Valladolid University. His health broke down at the close of 1493.

Queen Isabella visited and nursed him on his deathbed in Guadalajara. It is said that he recommended her to choose as his successor the Franciscan Jimenez de Cisneros, a man who had no likeness to himself save in political faculty and devotion to the authority of the Crown.

<text>During the 18th and 19th centuries, a sloop-of-war was a warship of the British Royal Navy with a single gun deck that carried up to 18 guns. The rating system of the Royal Navy covered all vessels with 20 or more guns; thus, the term encompassed all unrated warships, including gun-brigs and cutters. In technical terms, even the more specialised bomb vessels and fire ships were classed by the Royal Navy as sloops-of-war, and in practice these were employed in the role of a sloop-of-war when not carrying out their specialised functions.

In World War I and World War II, the Royal Navy reused the term &quot;sloop&quot; for specialised convoy-defence vessels, including the of the First World War and the highly successful of the Second World War, with anti-aircraft and anti-submarine capabilities. They performed similar duties to the destroyer escorts of the United States Navy, and also performed similar duties to the smaller corvettes of the Royal Navy.

==Rigging==
A sloop-of-war was quite different from a civilian or mercantile sloop, which was a general term for a single-masted vessel rigged in a way that would today be called a gaff cutter (but usually without the square topsails then carried by cutter-rigged vessels), though some sloops of that type did serve in the 18th century British Royal Navy, particularly on the Great Lakes of North America.

In the first half of the 18th century, most naval sloops were two-masted vessels, usually carrying a ketch or a snow rig. A ketch had main and mizzen masts but no foremast. A snow had a foremast and a main mast immediately abaft which a small subsidiary mast was fastened on which the spanker was set.

=== Ship sloop ===
The first three-masted, i.e., &quot;ship rigged&quot;, sloops appeared during the 1740s, and from the mid-1750s most new sloops were built with a three-masted (ship) rig. The third mast afforded the sloop greater mobility and the ability to back sail.

===Brig sloop===

In the 1770s, the two-masted sloop re-appeared in a new guise as the &quot;brig sloop&quot;, the successor to the former snow sloops. Brig sloops had two masts, while &quot;ship sloops&quot; continued to have three (since a brig is a two-masted, square-rigged vessel, and a ship is a square-rigger with three or more masts, though never more than three in that period).

In the Napoleonic period, Britain built huge numbers of brig sloops of the (18 guns) and the (10 guns). The brig rig was economical of manpower – important given Britain&#x27;s chronic shortfall in trained seamen relative to the demands of the wartime fleet. When armed with carronades (32-pounders in the &quot;Cruizer&quot; class, 18-pounders in the &quot;Cherokee&quot; class), they had the highest ratio of firepower to tonnage of any ships in the Royal Navy, albeit within the short range of the carronade. The carronades also used much less manpower than the long guns normally used to arm frigates. Consequently, the &quot;Cruizer&quot; class were often used as cheaper and more economical substitutes for frigates, in situations where the frigates&#x27; high cruising endurance was not essential. A carronade-armed brig, however, would be at the mercy of a frigate armed with long guns, so long as the frigate maneuvered to exploit its superiority of range. The other limitation of brig sloops as opposed to post ships and frigates was their relatively restricted stowage for water and provisions, which made them less suitable for long-range cruising. However, their shallower draught made them excellent raiders against coastal shipping and shore installations.

===Bermuda sloop===

The Royal Navy also made extensive use of the Bermuda sloop, both as a cruiser against French privateers, slavers, and smugglers, and also as its standard &quot;advice&quot; vessels, carrying communications, vital persons and materials, and performing reconnaissance duties for the fleets.

Bermuda sloops were found with gaff rig, mixtures of gaff and square rig, or a Bermuda rig. They were built with up to three masts. The single masted ships had huge sails and harnessed tremendous wind energy, which made them demanding to sail and required large, experienced crews. The Royal Navy favoured multi-masted versions, as it was perennially short of sailors at the end of the 18th century, and its personnel received insufficient training (particularly in the Western Atlantic, priority being given to the continuing wars with France for control of Europe). The longer decks of the multi-masted vessels also had the advantage of allowing more guns to be carried.

==Classification==
Originally a sloop-of-war was smaller than a sailing frigate and was (by virtue of having too few guns) outside the rating system. In general, a sloop-of-war would be under the command of a master and commander rather than a post captain, although in day-to-day use at sea the commanding officer of any naval vessels would be addressed as &quot;captain&quot;.

A ship sloop was generally the equivalent of the smaller corvette of the French Navy (although the French term also covered ships up to 24 guns, which were classed as post ships within the sixth rate of the British Navy). The name corvette was subsequently also applied to British vessels, but not until the 1830s.

American usage, while similar to British terminology into the beginning of the 19th century, gradually diverged. By about 1825 the United States Navy used &quot;sloop-of-war&quot; to designate a flush-deck ship-rigged warship with all armament on the gun deck; these could be rated as high as 26 guns and thus overlapped &quot;third-class frigates,&quot; the equivalent of British post-ships. The Americans also occasionally used the French term &quot;corvette.&quot;

==History==
In the Royal Navy, the sloop evolved into an unrated vessel with a single gun deck and three masts, two square rigged and the aft-most fore-and-aft rigged (corvettes had three masts, all of which were square-rigged). Steam sloops had a transverse division of their lateral coal bunkers in order that the lower division could be emptied first, to maintain a level of protection afforded by the coal in the upper bunker division along the waterline.

During the War of 1812 sloops of war in the service of the United States Navy performed well against their Royal Navy equivalents. The American ships had the advantage of being ship-rigged rather than brig-rigged, a distinction that increased their manoeuvrability. They were also larger and better armed. &quot;Cruizer-&quot;class brig-sloops in particular were vulnerable in one-on-one engagements with American sloops-of-war.

=== Decline ===
In the second half of the 19th century, successive generations of naval guns became larger and with the advent of steam-powered sloops, both paddle and screw, by the 1880s even the most powerful warships had fewer than a dozen large calibre guns, and were therefore technically sloops. Since the rating system was no longer a reliable indicator of a ship&#x27;s combat power, it was abolished altogether and with it the classifications of sloops, corvettes and frigates. Instead a classification based on the intended role of the ship became common, such as cruiser and battleship.

===Revival===
During the First World War, the sloop rating was revived by the British Royal Navy for small warships not intended for fleet deployments. Examples include the Flower classes of &quot;convoy sloops&quot;, those designed for convoy escort, and the of &quot;minesweeping sloops&quot;, those intended for minesweeping duty.

The Royal Navy continued to build vessels rated as sloops during the interwar years. These sloops were small warships intended for colonial &quot;gunboat diplomacy&quot; deployments, surveying duties, and acting during wartime as convoy escorts. As they were not intended to deploy with the fleet, sloops had a maximum speed of less than . A number of such sloops, for example the and classes, were built in the interwar years. Fleet minesweepers such as the were rated as &quot;minesweeping sloops&quot;. The Royal Navy officially dropped the term &quot;sloop&quot; in 1937, although the term remained in widespread and general use.

===World War II===

During World War II, 37 ships of the were built for convoy escort duties. However, the warship-standards construction, propulsion and sophisticated armaments of the sloop of that time shared bottlenecks with destroyers and did not lend themselves to mass production on commercial shipyards, thus the sloop was supplanted by the corvette, and later the frigate, as the primary escort vessel of the Royal Navy. Built to mercantile standards and with (initially) simple armaments, these vessels, notably the and classes, were produced in large numbers for the Battle of the Atlantic. In 1948 the Royal Navy reclassified its remaining sloops and corvettes as frigates, even though the term sloop had been officially defunct for nine years.

===2010s===
The Royal Navy has proposed a concept, known as the &quot;Future Black Swan-class Sloop-of-war&quot;, as an alternative to the Global Corvette of the Global Combat Ship programme.

==Notable sloops==
* Perhaps the most famous sloop was , in which Captain James Cook made his second and third Pacific voyages. This was not a purpose-built naval sloop, but was a former merchant collier purchased by the Royal Navy and adapted for exploration purposes. Cook called &quot;Resolution&quot; &quot;the ship of my choice&quot;, and &quot;the fittest for service of any I have seen&quot;.
* , a sloop of the Continental Navy which served on diplomatic missions to France. &quot;Independence&quot; was the first ship acquired by the Continental Congress for use during the American Revolutionary War. She captured two British prizes during her cruises to Europe.
* In 1780, , a sloop bearing 16 six-pounders and a crew of 99 seamen delivered Major John Andre to his meeting with General Benedict Arnold, near Haverstraw, New York, to finalise plans for Arnold&#x27;s surrender of West Point to the British. After Andre&#x27;s capture and the unmasking of the plot, Arnold fled to British lines, borne down the Hudson River aboard &quot;Vulture&quot;.
* , a &quot;Cherokee&quot;-class brig-sloop re-rigged as a three-masted barque, is famous as the ship Charles Darwin sailed around the world in between 1831 and 1836.
* In 1804 Commodore Sir Samuel Hood, commissioned Diamond Rock, a small island south of Fort-de-France in Martinique, as HM Sloop-of-War &quot;Fort Diamond&quot;, following his establishment of a fortified garrison on the rock.

* In 1805, (a Bermuda sloop) brought back news of the British victory at the Battle of Trafalgar.
* In 1800 and 1801 Lord Cochrane commanded , a brig-sloop of 14 guns, through a series of famous exploits in the Mediterranean. &quot;Speedy&quot; served as the inspiration for the fictional Jack Aubrey&#x27;s first command, &quot;Sophie&quot;.
* , a United States Navy sloop-of-war which was captured by the British in Canadian waters. Later she was liberated by the U.S. Navy at the Battle of Lake Champlain.

* In 1813, was dispatched to Fort Astoria at the mouth of the Columbia River during the War of 1812 to seize the post, which as it turned out had already been sold to the North-West Company; the fort was renamed by the ship&#x27;s Captain Black as Fort George.
* , a U.S. Navy sloop which served with distinction during the War of 1812. She is responsible for sinking or capturing at least four British warships and capturing several other merchant vessels. This within months of her commissioning and before her own sinking during a Caribbean storm in October 1814.
* In 1826, , acting as a warship of the Navy of the 1st Hellenic Republic under the command of Capt Frank Abney Hastings, was the first steam warship to see action. At the time the European armadas had no steam-warships.
* , a U.S. Navy sloop-of-war which served during the Mexican–American War in the California Campaign. She participated in combat during the Second Opium War, specifically the Battle of the Pearl River Forts. Later she served in the American Civil War, at the Battle of Forts Jackson and St. Philip.
* In 1843, , flagship of Commodore Edwin Moore, and vessel of the Second Texas Navy, and was a participant in the naval Battle of Campeche, which is the only historical example of a sail navy having defeated a steam navy.
* , an 1854 sloop which is currently a museum ship. It was the last all-sail warship designed and built by the U.S. Navy.
* , an 1861 steam sloop-of-war best known for defeating the Confederate commerce raider in a duel off the coast of Cherbourg, France in June 1864.
* , a 1938 sloop which was the first ship ever to be sunk by a guided missile, an event which occurred on 27 August 1943, when it was hit by a Henschel Hs 293 glide bomb launched from a Dornier Do 217.
* On 4 March 1942 HMAS &quot;Yarra&quot; sunk with the loss of 147 of 160 hands, while defending three ships under her protection from three Japanese cruisers and four destroyers. The actions of her crew are considered some of the bravest in the history of the Royal Australian Navy.
* , commanded by Captain Frederic John Walker, participated in the sinking of 14 U-boats between 1943 and 1944 as part of the 2nd Escort Group.
* In 1949, , a &quot;Black Swan&quot;-class sloop of the Royal Navy became involved in an international incident when she became trapped in the Yangtze River by Communist Chinese shore batteries. She made a famous escape on 30 July 1949, later turned into a feature film &quot;Yangtse Incident: The Story of HMS Amethyst&quot;.

<text>Íñigo López de Mendoza, 1st Marquess of Santillana (19 August 139825 March 1458) was a Castilian politician and poet who held an important position in society and literature during the reign of John II of Castile.

== Biography ==
He was born at Carrión de los Condes in Old Castile to a noble family which figured prominently in the arts. His grandfather, Pedro González de Mendoza I, and his father, Diego Hurtado de Mendoza, Admiral of Castile, were both poets with close ties to the great literary figures of the time: Chancellor Lopez de Ayala, Fernán Pérez de Guzmán and Gómez Manrique.

His mother, Doña Leonor Lasso de la Vega, was a wealthy heiress belonging to the House of Lasso de la Vega.

Lopez de Mendoza&#x27;s father died when he was five years old, which brought his family into financial difficulties. Part of his childhood was spent living in his grandmother&#x27;s household, and in the home of his uncle, the future Archbishop of Toledo. As a youth, he spent time in the court king Alfonso V of Aragón, where he was exposed to the work of poets in the Provençal, Valencia and Catalan traditions, the classic Humanist works of Virgil and Dante Alighieri, and the lyricism of troubadours such as Enrique de Villena.

In 1412, Don Íñigo married a wealthy heiress, Catarina Suárez de Figueroa. With this union, he acquired great fortune and became one of the most powerful nobles of his time. His sixth son from the marriage would one day become Cardinal Mendoza.

As a politician, Don Íñigo remained loyal to Juan II throughout his life, for which he was richly rewarded with land and the title of Marquess of Santillana in 1445, after the First Battle of Olmedo. When his wife Doña Catarina de Figueroa died, the Marquess retired to his palace of Guadalajara to spend the rest of his life in peaceful study and contemplation.

Lopez de Mendoza was a great admirer of Dante Alighieri and his work is categorized within the allegorical-Dantesque School. He also assimilated Petrarch and Giovanni Boccaccio&#x27;s Humanism.

He is especially remembered for his &quot;serranillas&quot;, which are small poems that focus on commonplace subjects. He also wrote pastoral novels inspired by French tradition, and was originator of the Castilian Sonnet.

<doc id="318246" wikidata="Q694432" url="?curid=318246" title="Phelsuma grandis">
<text>Phelsuma grandis is a diurnal arboreal species of day gecko. These geckos are part of the &quot;Phelsuma&quot; group, which consists of in excess of 70 species and subspecies. They are commonly referred to as the Madagascar giant day gecko, due to their large size. They are native to areas of tropical and subtropical forest in northern Madagascar, but have been introduced to several other subtropical locations outside their range. &quot;P. grandis&quot; feeds on various invertebrates, very small vertebrates, and nectars. It is bred and sold as an exotic pet.

==Taxonomy==
Its generic name is a Latinized version of the last name of Dutch physician Murk van Phelsum. Its specific name &quot;grandis&quot; is Latin for &quot;great&quot;.

The species &quot;Phelsuma grandis&quot; described by Gray 1870 was elevated from subspecies status (&quot;P. madagascariensis grandis&quot;) by Raxworthy et al. in 2007, after environmental niche modeling revealed significant and reliable differences between it and other members of the &quot;P. madagascariensis&quot;-clade. This elevation has since received further molecular support. &quot;P. grandis&quot; possesses also the junior synonyms &quot;Phelsuma madagascariensis venusta&quot; Mertens, 1964 and &quot;Phelsuma madagascariensis notissima&quot; Mertens, 1970 (fide Meier, 1982). The common name, appended to the current accepted name, has been given as Madagascar giant day gecko or variants such as Giant Day Gecko.

==Description==

This lizard reaches a total length of 9–11″ (23–28cm), with females generally being smaller than males. The body colour is bright green or, rarely, bluish green. A red stripe extends from the nostril to the eye. On the back there are typically red coloured dots or bars. These red markings are quite variable, and in some cases, completely absent, though the line extending from the nostril to the eye is always present. Some specimens may have small blue spots. Adult specimens may have large sacs on their necks. These are stored calcium sacks. Young individuals of the species often exhibit much more red than their parents, but as time passes, many of the markings fade, to leave those that will stay for the remainder of the gecko&#x27;s life. The underside of these animals is a creamy white ranging to an eggy yellow. When stressed, the colouration darkens, rendering the whole animal a dark green, and the red markings on the face and back more orange in hue.

==Distribution and habitat==

This species is widely distributed in northern and northwest Madagascar. There are a few recorded populations of this species also in Florida and Hawaii. It was introduced to Reunion Island in the mid-1990s and can be found in Mauritius, mainly in the northern part of the island at first, then in Floreal and in the upper Plaine Wilhems, and has since spread to such an extent that the species is considered a threat to the native biodiversity.

==Behaviour==
Like most Phelsuma species, the males can be quite quarrelsome and territorial and will not accept other males in their neighborhood. They only allow females to enter their territory. In captivity, where the females cannot escape, the males can also sometimes seriously wound a female. In this case the male and female must be separated. Breeding behavior includes, the shaking of the tail or body, vocalizing, and if the female does not accept the male she may turn a darker green. 

The day geckos may move slowly, but when they are startled they can move very fast. They are known for being very good at escaping their enclosures. Giant day geckos have no eyelids, so to keep their eyes clean, they lick them often.

==Diet==
These day geckos feed on various insects and other invertebrates, and occasionally have been recorded consuming small vertebrates. They also like to lick soft, sweet fruit, pollen and nectar. Geckos in the wild and in captivity have been observed consuming their own young.

==Reproduction==
The breeding season is between December and June. During this period, females can lay multiple pairs of eggs. The young will hatch after approximately 48–80 days depending on temperature.

<text>Haßberge is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in Bavaria, Germany. It is bounded by (from the northeast and clockwise) the districts of Coburg, Bamberg, Schweinfurt and Rhön-Grabfeld, and by the state of Thuringia (district of Hildburghausen).

==History==
The district was established in 1972 by merging the districts of Haßfurt, Ebern and Hofheim.

==Geography==
The district is named after the Haßberge hill chain, which is located south of the Thuringian border. It is an eastern extension of the Rhön mountains and densely forested. South of the hills the Main river crosses the district from east to west. South of the river there is the Steigerwald forest, whose northern parts belong to the district. Both the Haßberge hills and the Steigerwald are nature parks.

==Coat of arms==
The three jags are from the arms of Würzburg; the lion symbolises the city of Bamberg. These two bishoprics owned most of the region in medieval times. Below there is a motive from the Saxon coat of arms, since the city of Königsberg once belonged to Saxe-Coburg and did not become a part of Bavaria before 1920.

<doc id="318251" wikidata="Q6142512" url="?curid=318251" title="James Ruse">
<text>James Ruse (9 August 17595 September 1837) was a Cornish farmer who, at age 23, was convicted of burglary and was sentenced to seven years&#x27; transportation. He arrived at Sydney Cove, New South Wales, on the First Fleet with 18 months of his sentence remaining. Ruse applied to Colony Governor Arthur Phillip for a land grant, stating that he had been bred for farming. Governor Phillip, desperate to make the colony self-sufficient, allocated Ruse an allotment at Rose Hill (now Rosehill, near Parramatta), where he proved himself industrious and showed that it was possible for a family to survive in New South Wales through farming. Ruse received a land grant, from which he grew and sold 600 bushels of wheat . Ruse was the recipient of the first land grant in New South Wales. Ruse would later exchange the Rose Hill grant for more fertile land on the Hawkesbury River later in his life, after almost losing his farm and thus going bankrupt because of flooding, Ruse found work as a seaman, and later, a farm 
overseer.

==Early life==

James Ruse was born at Launceston, Cornwall, England on 9 August 1759. He was baptised on 26 August at Lawhitton.

In 1782, he was tried at the Cornwall Assizes and sentenced to death for &quot;seriously breaking and entering the dwelling house of Thomas Olive and stealing thereout 2 silver watches and other goods&quot;. He was reprieved and sentenced to transportation for seven years. He was sent on the &quot;Scarborough&quot;, one of the First Fleet, and arrived in Australia on 22 January 1788.

== Pioneering farmer ==
In 1789, Ruse produced the first successful corn harvest in New South Wales. That harvest failed to yield sufficient corn to make flour for the colony, but Ruse produced enough seeds for the next year&#x27;s crop, which was successful. Such was the colony&#x27;s need for a food supply that Governor Phillip rewarded Ruse for his success with the first land grant made in New South Wales, along with a gift of pigs and chickens. In February 1791, Ruse declared to the authorities that he was self-sufficient, and two months later, in March, he was granted a further 30 acres.
Ruse expected to reap about eight bushels (290 litres) to the acre. After Ruse&#x27;s sentence expired in 1792, the title of his land was deeded to him, the first land grant in the colony. In 1793, he sold his land to Dr. John Harris of the New South Wales Corps for 40 pounds. The property is now the Experiment Farm Cottage Museum of the National Trust of Australia.

In 1794, Ruse moved further out, to the junction of the Hawkesbury River with South Creek, where he operated a less successful farm. Later, his source of income was wiped out by flooding, which was always a risk involved with farming in the Hawkesbury. Ruse seems to have been away from his family for some time and it has been assumed that he went to sea at the same time that he had his son James the younger indentured to Kable and Underwood. This left his wife, Elizabeth to take care of the family on her own. During this period, she had two children with convict James Kiss. These children were Ann Ruse Kiss (b. 1801) and William James Ruse Kiss (1806−1853). James Ruse was heavily in debt and it is suggested that the hard work of his wife Elizabeth saved him from bankruptcy. Elizabeth is shown in the records as supplying crops to the stores in her own right.

From 1828, James was employed as an overseer of Denham Court. In 1836, James Ruse and James Kiss were received into the Catholic church together. Ruse died at Campbelltown on 5 September 1837 and is buried with wife Elizabeth and daughter Mary. 

Ruse&#x27;s gravestone, parts of which he carved himself, reads:
&quot;Gloria in Axcelsis

SACRED TO THE MEMEREY OF JAMES RUSE WHO DEPARTED THIS LIFE SEPT. 5TH IN THE YEAR OF HOURE LORD 1837 NATEF OF CORNWELL AND ARIVED IN THIS COLENEY BY THE FIRST FLEET AGED 78

MY MOTHER REREAD ME TENDERELY WITH ME SHE TOCK MUCH PAINES AND WHEN I ARIVED IN THIS COELNEY I SOWD THE FORST GRAIN AND NOW WITH MY HEVENLY FATHER I HOPE

FOR EVER TO REMAIN&quot;

== Family life ==
James Ruse married Susannah Norcott in South Petherwin, Cornwall, in 1779. They had one daughter, Elizabeth (1779−1779) and one son, Richard (1781−1842).

After being transported for his crime and creating a new life in New South Wales, Ruse married fellow convict Elizabeth Parry (1769 – 27 May 1836) on 5 September 1790. They had five children together – Rebecah (1791−1792), James (1793−1866), Elizabeth (1794−1875), Susannah (1796 – 1872), and Mary (1798−1871).

Although the family history of James Ruse is well-documented, historical records never identified the parents of Ann Ruse Kiss (b. 1801) and William James Ruse Kiss (1806−1853), who were believed to have been adopted by the Ruse family. In 2019, genetic testing of their descendants indicated that they were in fact the children of Elizabeth Ruse and James Kiss. It is unknown whether James Ruse was aware of Kiss&#x27; involvement with Elizabeth.

== Legacy ==
The memory of James Ruse is perpetuated in the naming of key locations in Sydney, including James Ruse Agricultural High School in Carlingford; James Ruse Drive, running from Granville to Northmead, near Parramatta; and Ruse, a suburb in southwest Sydney.

A replica of his tombstone stands in the front garden of Barrengarry House, the administration block at James Ruse Agricultural High School. The original headstone, carved by Ruse himself, was moved by his descendants to a secure location after vandals damaged some headstones in the Old St Johns cemetery at Campbelltown. The headstone is now in the care of the Campbelltown and Airds Historical Society at Glenalvon House in Lithgow Street, Campbelltown.

In 1980, the noted Cornish folk singer Brenda Wootton wrote and recorded the song &quot;James Ruse&quot; which uses as a chorus the last four lines of the headstone&#x27;s inscription.

<doc id="318255" wikidata="Q367016" url="?curid=318255" title="Realdo Colombo">
<text>Matteo Realdo Colombo (c. 1515 – 1559) was an Italian professor of anatomy and a surgeon at the University of Padua between 1544 and 1559.

== Early life and education ==
Matteo Realdo Colombo or Realdus Columbus, was born in Cremona, Lombardy, the son of an apothecary named Antonio Colombo. Although little is known about his early life, it is known he took his undergraduate education in Milan, where he studied philosophy, and he appears to have pursued his father&#x27;s profession for a short while afterwards. He left the apothecary&#x27;s life and apprenticed to the surgeon Giovanni Antonio Lonigo, under whom he studied for 7 years. In 1538 he enrolled in the University of Padua where he was noted to be an exceptional student of anatomy. While still a student, he was awarded a Chair of Sophistics at the university. In 1542 he returned briefly to Venice to assist his mentor, Lonigo.

== Academic career ==

Realdo Colombo studied philosophy in Milan, and then he trained to be a surgeon for several years under a Venetian named Giovanni Antonio Plato, also known as Lonigo or Leonicus. By 1538, during the years of Andreas Vesalius, Columbo had arrived at Padua where he studied medicine, anatomy, and he lectured to arts students on sophistics, or logic. Columbo became a close friend of Vesalius and possibly assisted him at a dissection. Vesalius was away in Basel when Columbo was temporarily appointed to teach in his place, and eventually, Colombo received this position more permanently.

In 1544, Colombo went to the University of Pisa and performed many dissections; he was referred to “As Master of Anatomy and Surgery.” Then in 1548, Columbo went to Rome where he taught anatomy at the papal university for about ten years until his death in 1559. While Colombo was in Rome, he took on a project with Michelangelo and became his personal physician and friend. He intended to collaborate with Michelangelo on an illustrated anatomy text to rival &quot;De Fabrica&quot; but this never came to pass, likely due to Michelangelo&#x27;s advanced age. Although not much is known about Colombo&#x27;s biography, his relationship with the more familiar Michelangelo has helped historians better understand his views. He also performed the autopsy on the body of St. Ignatius of Loyola.

== Colombo and Vesalius ==
The relationship between Colombo and Vesalius is not entirely clear. Colombo was appointed to one of the posts in surgery at the University of Padua in 1541 to replace Vesalius while he traveled to Basel in order to supervise the printing of De Humani Corporis Fabrica. It is often thought that Colombo was a student of Vesalius, but this may not have been the case. Regardless, they had become bitter rivals by 1555. While teaching Vesalius&#x27; classes in 1543, Colombo pointed out several errors Vesalius made, most notably attributing properties of cows&#x27; eyes to the eyes of humans as well as claiming to have discovered a vein in the human body, the existence of which Vesalius had previously denied. Although Vesalius has been much maligned for correcting Galen, Colombo was the one to criticize him for his own mistakes. When Vesalius returned, he was outraged. He publicly ridiculed Colombo, calling him an &quot;Ignoramus&quot; and stating that &quot;what meager knowledge [Colombo] has of anatomy he learned from me&quot; on a number of occasions. Despite Vesalius&#x27;s claims, it is likely that Colombo was a proper colleague of Vesalius rather than a student. For one thing, Vesalius attributes many of his discoveries in &quot;De Fabrica&quot; to Colombo who is referred to as a, &quot;very good friend.&quot; Vesalius and Colombo were also from very different academic backgrounds. Vesalius was a Galenic expert, trained in Leuven, whereas Colombo began his study of anatomy as a surgeon. Finally, Colombo refers frequently to Lonigo as his teacher of surgery and anatomy, never mentioning Vesalius. While both Colombo and Vesalius were in favor of returning to the anatomical practice of vivisection, as the Alexandrians did, Colombo was the only one to actually do so. This is one of the main reasons as to why Colombo criticized Vesalius. Vesalius criticized Galen while he himself continued to show the anatomy of animals, instead of humans, in his book.

== Colombo and Falloppio ==
Colombo&#x27;s only published text, &quot;De Re Anatomica&quot;, was released shortly after his death in 1559. His sons, Lazarus and Phoebus, were responsible for overseeing the final stages of the publishing process of his book after Colombo’s death interrupted it. Many of the contributions made in &quot;De Re Anatomica&quot; overlapped the discoveries of another anatomist, Gabriele Falloppio, most notably in that both Colombo and Falloppio claimed to have discovered the clitoris. Although both Colombo and Falloppio gave claim to what was actually the re-discovery of the clitoris, it is Colombo who is credited as having been the anatomist who correctly identified the clitoris as a predominantly sexual organ. Falloppio published his own book, &quot;Observationes Anatomicae&quot;, in 1561, but there is evidence that Falloppio had written notes on his discovery of the clitoris eleven years earlier in 1550. In 1574, Leone Giovanni Battista Carcano (1536–1606), a student of Falloppio, formally charged Colombo of plagiarism, although since Colombo had been dead for over a decade nothing came of these charges.

== Colombo’s criticisms of Galen ==
Realdo Colombo did not accept the work of previous anatomists without proof, and in some cases sought to criticize or discredit them. He especially criticized Galen’s work, and was angered by those who swore on Galen’s ideas, saying “that they dare to affirm that Galen is to be taken as Gospel, and that nothing in his writing is not true!” For example, he argued that Galen’s use of animals in dissection was not solid evidence that his anatomy was sound. He also criticized Vesalius for his hypocrisy in correcting Galen’s work while still avoiding human dissection. Colombo instead respected the work of Alexandrian physicians, as he viewed their use of human dissection as more accurate than animal dissection or vivisection. His use of vivisection to examine the contractions of the heart and arteries contradicted Galen’s findings, and supported the theories of the Alexandrian physician Erasistratus.

Prior to Colombo’s work, anatomists such as Galen and Vesalius examined blood vessels separately from the organs of the body. Colombo instead considered these vessels together with the organs they support, and from this was able to conceptualize the flow of blood to and from each organ, supporting his discovery of pulmonary transition of the blood. Colombo also viewed the lungs separately from the heart, and assigned it as having a special role in respiration. This approach to examination gave him a more firm understanding of the functions of the organs as well, and strengthened his criticisms of Galen.

== Methodology ==
Colombo put an emphasis on vivisection, the practice of experimentation or scientific research on live animals, in order to learn about the different bodily functions of the human body. According to Colombo’s book, “De Re Anatomica Libri XV,” he put energy into dissecting, in particular the cadavers of men. Colombo anatomized the live, active body whereas his contemporaries had anatomized the dead body. Colombo’s concentration on vivisection revived the practice of ancient Alexandrian anatomists, using live animals instead of dead, which led him to adopting this new way of conceptualizing the body. The vivisection method enabled Colombo to study the operation of the voice, the motion of the lungs, the heart and the motion of the arteries, the dilation and contraction of the brain, variations of the pulse and other functions.

With the centrality of vivisection, the three ‘rivers’ was also emphasized in Colombo’s book, specifically Book XI. “There are three fountain-heads, the liver, heart, and brain, from which are distributed throughout the body the three rivers of the natural blood, the vital blood and the animal spirits respectively. The view of the three rivers does not come from any known ancient source.”
Although there were many important organs like the liver in the abdomen area and the heart, for Columbo, the supreme organ was the brain. Colombo described the organs in the form of hierarchy and because the brain was said to be the most noble of organ, it was ‘King of the principal members’ of the body. The supremacy of the brain was directly related to his view of the three rivers. “What is generated in the brain and distributed through the nerves, is what differentiates the live body from the dead one.” Among other reasons, the most important one for the brain being King of all organs, is the fact that the brain is the source of sense and motion.

== Contributions to anatomy ==
Colombo made several important advances in anatomy, including the discovery of the pulmonary circuit which paved the way for William Harvey&#x27;s discovery of circulation years later. In the Galenic tradition, blood passed between the ventricles of the heart through micropores in the heart&#x27;s septum and venous blood became arterial blood in the left ventricle of the heart where air was supplied by the pulmonary vein. During vivisections of dogs and other animals, Colombo repeatedly found only blood, and no air, in the pulmonary vein. In his model, venous blood travelled from the heart to the lungs where it was mixed with air and then returned to the heart. The permeability of the septum was questioned by Michael Servetus in &quot;Christianismi Restitutio&quot; in 1553 and by Ibn al-Nafis in the 13th century and both proposed that the blood was pushed from the right ventricle to the left via the lungs, however, both of these accounts were largely forgotten. Colombo was the first to propose the pulmonary circuit in an intellectual climate that could expand on his theory. In addition to the pulmonary circuit, Colombo also discovered that the main action of the heart was contraction, rather than dilation as had previously been thought. Both of these discoveries were later confirmed by William Harvey.

In addition, Colombo is credited with coining the term &quot;placenta&quot; and in his work describes the placenta as a place where pure and perfect blood is stored for the baby before birth. He believes Galen misinterpreted the placenta when it comes to humans and challenges Galen’s views on the placenta because Galen only performed dissections on animals. Colombo argues that performing vivisections helps one to understand how the system works as a whole. At the time his work in this anatomical area was revolutionary and provided the basis for the understanding of the placenta and other anatomical structures we have today. These detailed descriptions and critiques are in his book &quot;De Re Anatomica Libri XV&quot;.

Much cited is Columbo&#x27;s naming and description of the clitoris as &quot;Amor Veneris, vel Dulcedo Appelletur.&quot; He stated, &quot;It should be called the love or sweetness of Venus.&quot;
(See historical and modern perceptions of the clitoris.)
While Colombo was not the first to discover the clitoris, he is one of the first to propose its role in female sexual pleasure. This finding caused quite a stir amongst the general public as it was already thought that females had anatomy corresponding to their male counterparts; the addition of a bodily structure could cause women to be viewed as hermaphrodites.

The structure of Colombo&#x27;s book, &quot;On anatomizing&quot;, is indicative of the way in which Colombo went about dissecting subjects for his research. Not only was the order and structure of this work very thought out, but also it differed from the structure of other anatomists at the time.

Colombo&#x27;s anatomical text consisted of 15 different books, each of which covered information concerning a different part of the body. Book 1 described the bones, while Book 2 and Book three, respectively, outlined the cartilages and ligaments that could be found within the human body. Book 4 explains the skeleton as a whole, bringing together the individually discussed anatomical elements described in the preceding three books. The muscles of the human body are described in Book 5, and the liver and veins share the content of Book 6. Book 7 explains the heart and arteries and is followed by a Book 8&#x27;s discussion of the brain and nerves. Glands in general are described in Book 9, and Book 10 is dedicated to the explanation of the eyes. The viscera are covered in Book 11. Book 12 outlines the formation of the fetus while book 13 details the covering of the human body, or skin. Vivisections, a practice used regularly by Colombo are described in Book 14. Book 15 closes out the anatomical text by listing things Colombo himself saw that fell under the category of &quot;things rarely seen in anatomy.&quot;

This method of organizing his anatomical work was, at this time, a break from previous anatomizing tradition. Colombo dealt with each major organ in conjunction with their vessels, whereas previous anatomists, including Vesalius, separated organs from their vessels. In addition to this break from tradition, Colombo did not include the lungs in his discussion of the heart and their vessels, the arteries. It was this severing of the conceptual link between the lungs and the heart that had existed since the time of Galen that made Colombo’s discovery of the pulmonary transit of blood possible.

==In fiction==
Federico Andahazi&#x27;s 1997 novel (&quot;The Anatomist&quot;) compares Colombo to Christopher Columbus, drawing parallels between the discovery of the clitoris and of the New World.

<text>Grace Abbott (November 17, 1878 – June 19, 1939) was an American social worker who specifically worked in improving the rights of immigrants and advancing child welfare, especially the regulation of child labor. She served as director of the U.S. Children&#x27;s Bureau from 1921 to 1934. 

==Biography==
Grace Abbott was born in Grand Island, Nebraska, to a family of reformers on November 17 1878. Her father, O. A. Abbott, was active in politics and her mother, Elizabeth M. Griffin, was an abolitionist and early suffragist. Her elder sister, Edith Abbott, was a social worker, educator, and researcher, professional interests that often complemented Grace&#x27;s. 

Abbott graduated from Grand Island College in 1898. Before embarking on her career in social work, she was employed as a high school teacher in her hometown through 1906. In 1903, she started graduate studies at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.

In 1907, she moved to Chicago, where she entered the career of social work. She took up residency in the Hull House, an urban center for women engaged in early proto-feminism and social reform, as well as a safe haven for the poor. In 1909, Abbott received a Ph.M. in political science from the University of Chicago. She wrote a series of weekly articles in the Chicago Evening Post, titled &quot;Within the City&#x27;s Gates&quot; from 1909 to 1910, which brought to light the exploitation of immigrants.

Abbott served on several committees and organizations for advancing the societal cause of child welfare, including the Immigrants&#x27; Protective League (1908-1917), the National Consumers&#x27; League, and the Women&#x27;s Trade Union League. In 1911, she co-founded the Joint Committee for Vocational Training with Sophonisba Breckenridge, PhD, JD, and Edith Abbott, PhD, JD.

From 1917 to 1919, she worked for the U.S. Children&#x27;s Bureau, under Julia Lathrop. Abbott was the director of the child labor division of the agency, and it was in this capacity that she was responsible for administering the Keating-Owen Act (1916). This law was reversed by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1918. She was responsible for portions of this law continuing by inserting clauses into the war-goods contracts between the federal government and private industries.

After working for the Illinois State Immigrants Commission from 1919 to 1921, Abbott was appointed by President Warren G. Harding as director of the U.S. Children&#x27;s Bureau. She directed the bureau from 1921 until 1934. During this period, one of her main responsibilities was overseeing the enforcement of the Sheppard-Towner Act.

In 1924, she worked tirelessly to pass a constitutional amendment against child labor, an amendment that never gained statewide ratification. Abbott was an author of several sociological texts, including &quot;The Immigrant and the Community&quot; (1917) and &quot;The Child and the State&quot; (1938, 2 volumes). 

Abbott served as president of the National Conference of Social Work from 1923 to 1924, and was a member of the committee that organized the first Conference on Social Work, held in Paris, in 1928. In addition to her responsibilities at the Children’s Bureau, from 1922 to 1934, Abbott was the official representative of the U.S. on the League of Nations&#x27; advisory committees on trafficking of women and on child welfare.

Abbott pioneered the process of incorporating sociological data relating to child labor, juvenile delinquency, dependency, and statistics into the lawmaking process; she spent much of her time as a political lobbyist for social issues in Washington, D.C. She was associated with the Social Security Administration from 1934 until her death in 1939; during that time period, Abbott helped draft the Social Security Act and chaired several government committees on child welfare and social issues. In addition, after leaving the Children&#x27;s Bureau in 1934, she taught at the University of Chicago School of Social Service Administration until her death five years later.

Like many professional women of her generation, Abbott never married. 

During a 1938 health checkup, doctors discovered that she was suffering from multiple myeloma. The disease caused her death one year later. Cancer was considered such a dreaded disease at the time that she and her sister hid her diagnosis and her obituary in &quot;The New York Times&quot; listed her cause of death as &quot;anemia&quot;.

Abbott is a member of the Nebraska Hall of Fame, inducted in 1976.

The School of Social Work at the University of Nebraska at Omaha is named in her honor.

<doc id="318257" wikidata="Q653208" url="?curid=318257" title="Monolith">
<text>A monolith is a geological feature consisting of a single massive stone or rock, such as some mountains. Erosion usually exposes the geological formations, which are often made of very hard and solid igneous or metamorphic rock. Some monoliths are volcanic plugs, solidified lava filling the vent of an extinct volcano.

In architecture, the term has considerable overlap with megalith, which is normally used for prehistory, and may be used in the contexts of rock-cut architecture that remains attached to solid rock, as in monolithic church, or for exceptionally large stones such as obelisks, statues, monolithic columns or large architraves, that may have been moved a considerable distance after quarrying. It may also be used of large glacial erratics moved by natural forces.

The word derives, via the Latin , from the Ancient Greek word (), from () meaning &quot;one&quot; or &quot;single&quot; and () meaning &quot;stone&quot;.

<text>Koch&#x27;s giant day gecko (&quot;Phelsuma madagascariensis kochi)&quot;, also known commonly as Koch&#x27;s day gecko, the Madagascar day gecko, and the Maevatanana day gecko, is a diurnal subspecies of gecko, a lizard in the family Gekkonidae. The subspecies is native to northwestern and western Madagascar and typically inhabits trees. It feeds on insects and nectar.

==Etymology==
The subspecific name, &quot;kochi&quot;, is in honor of German ornithologist and herpetologist K.L. Koch of the &quot;Naturmuseum Senckenberg&quot; in Frankfurt.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
Koch&#x27;s giant day gecko is often treated as its own species, &quot;Phelsuma kochi&quot; .

==Description==
&quot;P. m. kochi&quot; is among the largest living day geckos. It can reach a total length (including tail) of . The body colour is a dark, dull green. A faint red stripe extends from the nostril to the eye. On the back there may be little reddish dots present. The neck and flanks often are light grey. The ventral side is off-white.

==Geographic range==
&quot;P. m. kochi&quot; is widely distributed in northwestern and western Madagascar on the coast and in the inland. It was first discovered in the region around Maevatanana, where the holotype was collected.

==Habitat==
&quot;P. m. kochi&quot; is often found on different trees such as banana trees where it can be seen basking. It avoids human dwellings. The climate is very dry throughout the year and the temperature can be as high as 40 °C (104 °F).

==Diet==
Koch&#x27;s giant day gecko feeds on various insects and other invertebrates. It also like to lick soft, sweet fruit, pollen and nectar.

==Behaviour==
This subspecies, &quot;P. m. kochi&quot;, is not quite as quarrelsome and aggressive as &quot;P. m. madagascariensis&quot; and &quot;P. m. grandis&quot;.

==Reproduction==
The pairing season for &quot;P. m. kochi&quot; is between November and the first weeks of May. During this period, the sexually mature females lay up to 6 pairs of eggs. At a temperature of 28 °C (82 °F), the young will hatch after approximately 63–68 days. The juveniles measure and reach sexual maturity after one year.

==Care and maintenance in captivity==
&quot;P. m. kochi&quot; should be housed in pairs although successful group breeding with one male and several females has been reported. They need a large, well planted terrarium. The temperature should be about 28 °C (82 °F) during the day. The humidity should be maintained around 65%. In captivity, these animals can be fed with crickets, wax moths, fruit flies, mealworms, and houseflies.

<text>The Pont Neuf (, &quot;New Bridge&quot;) is the oldest standing bridge across the river Seine in Paris, France. It stands by the western (downstream) point of the Île de la Cité, the island in the middle of the river that was, between 250 and 225 BCE, the birthplace of Paris, then known as Lutetia and, during the medieval period, the heart of the city.

The bridge is composed of two separate spans, one of five arches joining the left bank to the &quot;Île de la Cité&quot;, another of seven joining the island to the right bank. Old engraved maps of Paris show that the newly built bridge just grazed the downstream tip of the &quot;Île de la Cité&quot;; since then, the natural sandbar building of a mid-river island, aided by stone-faced embankments called &quot;quais&quot;, has extended the island. Today the tip of the island is the location of the &quot;Square du Vert-Galant&quot;, a small public park named in honour of Henry IV, nicknamed the &quot;Green Gallant&quot;.

The name &quot;Pont Neuf&quot; was given to distinguish it from older bridges that were lined on both sides with houses, and has remained after all of those were replaced. Its name notwithstanding, it has long been the oldest bridge in Paris crossing the Seine. It has been listed since 1889 as a &quot;monument historique&quot; by the French Ministry of Culture.

==Construction==
As early as 1550, Henry II considered building a new bridge at the Ile de la Cite because the existing Pont Notre-Dame was congested and needed repair. The idea was not advanced for lack of funds. By 1577, however, Henry III released funds from the national treasury for a new bridge and appointed a building commission for its designing and planning. Henry rejected the first design proposed by the committee, which included monumental arches, but no plan for buildings along the sides. The commission proceeded in 1578 with modifications to its initial plan, perhaps devised by the royal architect, Androuet de Cerceau. While Henry had already allowed for piers to be driven for the northern arm of bridge, the first construction under the 1579 design indicated a wider deck in preparation of buildings to be constructed on the side. The houses were never built, but the wide bridge deck was retained.

In February 1578, the decision to build the bridge was made by Henry III who laid its first stone in on 31 May 1578, the same year when the foundations of four piers and one abutment were completed. Pierre des Isles, one of the builders, convinced the supervisory commission that the bridge, which was originally planned straight, would be more resistant to the river currents if its two sections were built at a slight angle. The change was adopted in May 1578.

Further design changes were made during the summer of 1579. First, the number of arches was changed from eight and four to seven and five. This was not a problem on the north side, where nothing had been built, but on the south, where the four piles and the abutment on the Left Bank were already laid, the addition of the fifth arch necessitated reducing the length of the platform on the island, the &quot;terre-plein&quot;, from 28.5 toises to about 19. Second, it was decided to allow houses to be built on the bridge (though they never were). This required the widening of the bridge. The remaining piers were built over the next nine years. After a long delay beginning in 1588, due to political unrest and to the Wars of Religion, construction was resumed in 1599 under the reign of Henry IV. The bridge was opened to traffic in 1604 and completed in July 1606. It was inaugurated by Henry IV in 1607.

Like most bridges of its time, the &quot;Pont Neuf&quot; is constructed as a series of many short arch bridges, following Roman precedents. It was the first stone bridge in Paris not to support houses in addition to a thoroughfare, and was also fitted with pavements protecting pedestrians from mud and horses; pedestrians could also step aside into its bastions to let a bulky carriage pass. The decision not to include houses on the bridge can be traced back directly to Henry IV, who decided against their inclusion on the grounds that houses would impede a clear view of the Louvre, which the newly built &quot;galerie du bord de l&#x27;eau&quot; linked to the Tuileries Palace.

Pont Neuf was for a long time the widest bridge in Paris. It has undergone much repair and renovation work, including rebuilding of seven spans in the long arm and lowering of the roadway by changing the arches from an almost semi-circular to elliptical form (1848–1855), lowering of sidewalks and faces of the piers, spandrels, cornices and replacing crumbled corbels as closely to the originals as possible. In 1885, one of the piers of the short arm was undermined, removing the two adjacent arches, requiring them to be rebuilt and all the foundations strengthened.

A major restoration of the &quot;Pont Neuf&quot; was begun in 1994 and was completed in 2007, the year of its 400th anniversary.

==&quot;Mascarons&quot;==

The &quot;mascarons&quot; are the stone masks, 381 in number, each being different and which decorate the sides of the bridge. They represent the heads of forest and field divinities from ancient mythology, as well as satyrs and sylvains. They are copies of the originals attributed to the French Renaissance sculptor Germain Pilon (1525–1590), who also sculpted the tomb of King Henry II of France and Queen Catherine de&#x27;Medici in the Basilica of St Denis, five kilometers north of Paris. The &quot;mascarons&quot; remained in place until 1851–1854, when the bridge was completely rebuilt. At that time six of the original &quot;mascarons&quot; from the 16th century were placed in the Musée Carnavalet, along with eight molds of other originals. Eight other originals were first placed in the Musée de Cluny – Musée national du Moyen Âge, and are now in the French National Museum of the Renaissance in the &quot;Château d&#x27;Écouen&quot;. During their reconstruction, the Renaissance masks were replaced with copies made by noted 19th-century sculptors, including Hippolyte Maindron, Hubert Lavigne, Antoine-Louis Barye and Fontenelle. Fontenelle made 61 masks, which are found on the upstream side of the bridge between the right bank and the &quot;Île de la Cité&quot;.

==Equestrian statue of Henry IV==
At the point where the bridge crosses the Île de la Cité, there stands a bronze equestrian statue of king Henry IV, originally commissioned from Giambologna under the orders of Marie de Médicis, Henri&#x27;s widow and Regent of France. After his death, Giambologna&#x27;s assistant Pietro Tacca completed the statue, which was erected on its pedestal by Pietro Francavilla, in 1614. It was destroyed in 1792 during the French Revolution, but was rebuilt in 1818, following the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy. Commissioned from public donations, bronze for the new statue was obtained from a statue of Louis Charles Antoine Desaix and melted down. The new statue was cast from a mold made using a surviving cast of the original. Inside the statue, the new sculptor François-Frédéric Lemot put four boxes, containing a history of the life of Henry IV, a 17th-century parchment certifying the original statue, a document describing how the new statue was commissioned, and a list of people who contributed to a public subscription.
==La Samaritaine==
Between 1712 and 1719, replacing an earlier one, a large pump house was built on the bridge. It was decorated with an image of the Samaritan woman at the well. As a result, the structure (which included a carillon) was named &quot;La Samaritaine&quot;. Years after it was torn down (in 1813), Ernest Cognacq, a 19th-century merchant, set up a stand on the site and gradually grew his business to what became, in 1869, the department store La Samaritaine.

==As the centre of Paris==


Upon completion, Pont Neuf attracted throngs of visitors, many of whom used the bridge as a public square, conducting business, socializing, and taking in the view. One contemporary writer repeated a proverb about Pont Neuf to illustrate the variety of people who frequented the bridge, &quot;one never crossed the Pont Neuf without meeting three things: a monk, a girl and a white horse.&quot; 

All through the 18th century, the &quot;Pont Neuf&quot; was the center of Paris, lively with both crime and commerce: Czar Peter the Great, who came to study French civilization under the regency of the Duke d&#x27;Orleans, declared that he had found nothing more curious in Paris than the Pont Neuf; and, sixty years later, the philosopher Franklin wrote to his friends in America that he had not understood the Parisian character except in crossing the Pont Neuf.

In 1862, Édouard Fournier traced its history in his lively two-volume &quot;Histoire du Pont-Neuf&quot;. He describes how, even before it was completed (in 1607), gangs hid out in and around it, robbing and murdering people. It remained a dangerous place even as it became busier. For a long time, the bridge even had its own gallows.

This did not prevent people from congregating there, drawn by various stands and street performers (acrobats, fire-eaters, musicians, etc.). Charlatans and quacks of various sorts were also common, as well as the hustlers (shell game hucksters, etc.) and pickpockets often found in crowds – not to mention a lively trade in prostitution. Among the many businesses which, however, unofficially set up there, were several famous tooth pullers.

In 1701, Cotolendi quoted a letter supposedly written by a Sicilian tourist:

One finds on the Pont-Neuf an infinity of people who give tickets, some put fallen teeth back in, and others make crystal eyes; there are those who cure incurable illnesses; those who claim to have discovered the virtues of some powdered stones to white and to beautify the face. This one claims he makes old men young; there are those who remove wrinkles from the forehead and the eyes, who make wooden legs to repair the violence of bombs; finally everybody is so applied to work, so strongly and continually, that the devil can tempt no one but on Holidays and Sundays.

With its numerous sellers of pamphlets and satirical performers, it was also a center for social commentary:

In the 16th cent. the Pont-Neuf was the scene of the recitals of Tabarin, a famous satirist of the day, and it was long afterwards the favourite rendezvous of news-vendors, jugglers, showmen, loungers, and thieves. Any popular witticism in verse was long known as &quot;un Pont-Neuf&quot;.

In the seventeenth century, that bridge of memories, the old &quot;Pont Neuf&quot; of Paris, was the rendezvous of quacksalvers and mountebanks. Booths for the sale of various articles lined the sides of the bridge. People flocked there to see the sights, laugh, chat, make love and enjoy life as only Parisians can. Students and &quot;grisettes&quot; of the &quot;Quartier latin&quot; elbowed ladies and gentlemen of the court. Bourgeois families came to study the flippant manners of the aristocrats. Poodle clippers plied their trade; jugglers amused the &quot;quid nuncs&quot; with feats of dexterity; traveling dentists pulled teeth and sold balsams; clowns tumbled; and last, but not least, pickpockets lifted purses and silk handkerchiefs with impunity. Says Augustus J. C. Hare (Walks in Paris): &quot;So central an artery is the Pont Neuf, that it used to be a saying with the Parisian police, that if, after watching three days, they did not see a man cross the bridge, he must have left Paris.&quot; One of the principal vendors of quack nostrums of the &quot;Pont Neuf&quot; was Montdor. He was aided by a buffoon named Tabarin, who made facetious replies to questions asked by his master, accompanied with laughable grimaces and grotesque gestures. The modern ringmaster and clown of the circus have similar scenes together, minus the selling of medicines.

Under Louis XV, thieves and entertainers were joined by recruiters, or &quot;sellers of human flesh&quot;, who did their best to lure newcomers to Paris and others &quot;with as much violence as the sale of Negros in the Congo&quot;. Silversmiths and other luxury businesses nearby (which gave their name to the &quot;Quai des Orfèvres&quot;) drew visitors as well.

One yearly event, held on the nearby &quot;Place Dauphine&quot;, prefigured the &quot;Salon des Refusés&quot; which would give rise to the Impressionists. During the celebration of the Corpus Christi (&quot;Fête-Dieu&quot;), the &quot;Place Dauphine&quot; hosted one of the most magnificent &quot;reposoirs&quot; (portable altars for the Host).

Along with all the rich silverwork and tapestries placed on it, some local silversmiths ordered paintings for these. This led to art dealers being asked to participate and, ultimately, to the newest talents being shown at the &quot;Petite Fête-Dieu&quot; (the Small Corpus Christi), a reduced version of the Corpus Christi holiday which took place eight days later. Though their canvases were only shown from six in the morning to noon, this became an important opportunity for unknown artists to draw attention. Among other things, this led to the painters there signing their work, as was not frequent in the Salon – which was not always an advantage when the work was publicly and loudly critiqued.

Showing works, which often had no pretense of a religious subject, they might then be noticed and find an entree into the official Academy. Chardin is one of the most famous painters to have started this way.

In 1720, a young man of about twenty-two, son of the man who maintained the king&#x27;s billiards, displayed a canvas here showing an antique bas-relief. J.-B. Vanloo passed by, looked at the canvas for a long time, found great qualities there, and bought it. He wanted afterwards to know the young painter, encouraged him, gave him advice, of which the latter perhaps had no need, got him work, which was more useful, and eight years later, the unknown of the &quot;place Dauphine&quot; was his colleague at the Academy of Painting... he was called Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin.

The slow decline of the bridge&#x27;s central role began in 1754: &quot;Starting in 1754, the first year of the vogue, the madness of the boulevards, it was no longer the thing to talk about the &quot;Cours&quot; [the Champs-Elysées], and still less of this poor Pont-Neuf. To the Boulevard, at once, long live the Boulevard!&quot;. Still the bridge remained a lively place through the end of the century. With time, people became wary of its reputation and other changes subdued its atmosphere. In 1840, Lacroix wrote: &quot;Once the pont Neuf was a perpetual fair; at present, it is just a bridge to be crossed without stopping.&quot;

==Possible first photograph of human being==

 In 1838, Louis Daguerre produced his famous daguerreotype portrait of the &quot;View of the Boulevard du Temple&quot;, widely considered the first photograph where a human can be seen. However, between 1836 and 1837, Daguerre made several tests, in order to experiment with and perfect the new technique in an outdoor environment. 

One surviving example is an image of the Pont Neuf and the equestrian statue of Henry IV, made possibly as early as 1836. On the lower-left side of the image, what appears to be a worker, or perhaps two, can be seen lying against the fence, in the shadow of the statue.

==Christo&#x27;s project==
In 1985, after years of negotiation with the mayor of Paris, the art duo Christo and Jeanne-Claude wrapped the Pont Neuf.

<text>Moschidae is a family of pecoran even-toed ungulates, containing the musk deer (&quot;Moschus&quot;) and its extinct relatives. They are characterized by long &quot;saber teeth&quot; instead of horns, antlers or ossicones, modest size (&quot;Moschus&quot; only reaches ; other taxa were even smaller) and a lack of facial glands. While various Oligocene and Miocene pecorans were previously assigned to this family, recent studies find that most should be assigned to their own clades, although further research would need to confirm these traits. As a result, &quot;Micromeryx&quot;, &quot;Hispanomeryx&quot;, and &quot;Moschus&quot; are the only undisputed moschid members, making them known from at least 18 Ma. The group was abundant across Eurasia and North America during the Miocene, but afterwards declined to only the extant genus &quot;Moschus&quot; by the early Pleistocene.

==Taxonomy and classification==
Until the early 21st century, it was believed that the musk deer (family Moschidae) were an adjacent, sister-group to the &quot;true deer&quot; of the family Cervidae (caribou, moose, elk, and roughly 40–50 other species); however, a 2003 phylogenetic study by Alexandre Hassanin (of the National Museum of Natural History, France) and co., based on mitochondrial and nuclear analyses, revealed that Moschidae and Bovidae (antelope, cattle, goats, sheep), together, form a sister-clade to Cervidae. According to the study, the Cervidae diverged from the Bovidae-Moschidae clade roughly 27–28 million years ago. The following cladogram is based on this 2003 study:

<doc id="318270" wikidata="Q3866060" url="?curid=318270" title="Musk deer">
<text>Musk deer can refer to any one, or all eight, of the species that make up Moschus, the only extant genus of the family Moschidae. Despite being commonly called deer, they are not true deer belonging to the family Cervidae, but rather their family is closely related to Bovidae, the group that contains antelopes, bovines, sheep, and goats. The musk deer family differs from cervids, or true deer, by lacking antlers and preorbital glands also, possessing only a single pair of teats, a gallbladder, a caudal gland, a pair of canine tusks and—of particular economic importance to humans—a musk gland.

Musk deer live mainly in forested and alpine scrub habitats in the mountains of South Asia, notably the Himalayas. Moschids, the proper term when referring to this type of deer rather than one/multiple species of musk deer, are entirely Asian in their present distribution, being extinct in Europe where the earliest musk deer are known to have existed from Oligocene deposits.

==Characteristics==

Musk deer resemble small deer, with a stocky build and hind legs longer than their front legs. They are about long, high at the shoulder, and weigh between . The feet of musk deer are adapted for climbing in rough terrain. Like the Chinese water deer, a cervid, they have no antlers, but the males do have enlarged upper canines, forming sabre-like tusks. The dental formula is similar to that of true deer: 

The musk gland is found only in adult males. It lies in a sac located between the genitals and the umbilicus, and its secretions are most likely used to attract mates.

Musk deer are herbivores, living in hilly, forested environments, generally far from human habitation. Like true deer, they eat mainly leaves, flowers, and grasses, with some mosses and lichens. They are solitary animals and maintain well-defined territories, which they scent mark with their caudal glands. Musk deer are generally shy and either nocturnal or crepuscular.

Males leave their territories during the rutting season and compete for mates, using their tusks as weapons. In order to indicate their area, musk deer build latrines. These locations can be used to identify the musk deer&#x27;s existence, number, and preferred habitat in the wild. Female musk deer give birth to a single fawn after about 150–180 days. The newborn young are very small and essentially motionless for the first month of their lives, a feature that helps them remain hidden from predators.

Musk deer have been hunted for their scent glands, which are used in perfumes. The glands can fetch up to $45,000/kg on the black market. It is rumored that ancient royalty wore the scent of the musk deer, and that it is an aphrodisiac.

== Population ==
Musk deer have a global population between 400,000 to 800,000 currently, however the exact count is undetermined. They are widely spread; however, their population density increases within China, Russia, and Mongolia. Musk deer are commonly found in China, and they are spread over 17 provinces. This population is mainly located around the Himalayas in southern Asia, southeast Asia, and eastern Asia. They are also found in a few spots in Russia. As of 2003, they became a protected species due to their declined overall population. Musk deer have many subspecies that have varying population sizes, within the overall total, and all are threatened. Over the past twenty years, the populations have been able to slightly recover due to the captive breeding of these animals, specifically in China. Musk deer populations are recovering due to the protocols and rules being set in place to protect the species.

== Habitat ==
The musk deer species is generally solitary and lives in the higher regions of mountain ranges, such as the Himalayas. The varying species&#x27; habitats include different atmospheres and necessary resources for their survival, while including similar universal resources. Musk deer population has been declining recently due to environmental and human factors. As a large-bodied mammal, they have great needs that are not able to be sustained due to habitat fragmentation. This species is largely protected due to the threat of extinction, due to the increase in illegal hunting. Illegal hunting has significantly decreased the population throughout many of the provinces musk deer occupy. Their habitats are being lost to colonization and deforestation and hunting for musk deer was on the rise. They were hunted for their distinct products that are very valuable in the market. Since then, the Chinese government has stepped in to regulate these issues. They have placed rules pertaining to the killing of musk deer and created havens for the deer to survive. To help with the declining numbers, the deforestation of their natural habitat should be stopped and new habitats should be invested in them. Global climate change has also driven the musk deer population down. The warmer climates result in the drive to higher elevations and latitudes. Global warming and habitat fragmentation are two causes for the population decrease.

==Evolution==
Musk deer are the only surviving members of the Moschidae, a family with a fossil record extending over 25 million years to the late Oligocene. The group was abundant across Eurasia and North America until the late Miocene, but underwent a substantial decline, with no Pliocene fossil record and &quot;Moschus&quot; the only genus since the Pleistocene. The oldest records of the genus &quot;Moschus&quot; are known from the Late Miocene (Turolian) of Lufeng, China.

=== Taxonomy ===
While they have been traditionally classified as members of the deer family (as the subfamily &quot;Moschinae&quot;) and all the species were classified as one species (under &quot;Moschus moschiferus&quot;), recent studies have indicated that moschids are more closely related to bovids (antelope, goats, sheep and cattle).

<text>An arch bridge is a bridge with abutments at each end shaped as a curved arch. Arch bridges work by transferring the weight of the bridge and its loads partially into a horizontal thrust restrained by the abutments at either side, and partially into a vertical load on the arch supports. A viaduct (a long bridge) may be made from a series of arches, although other more economical structures are typically used today.

== History ==

Possibly the oldest existing arch bridge is the Mycenaean Arkadiko Bridge in Greece from about 1300 BC. The stone corbel arch bridge is still used by the local populace. The well-preserved Hellenistic Eleutherna Bridge has a triangular corbel arch. The 4th century BC Rhodes Footbridge rests on an early voussoir arch.

Although true arches were already known by the Etruscans and ancient Greeks, the Romans were – as with the vault and the dome – the first to fully realize the potential of arches for bridge construction. A list of Roman bridges compiled by the engineer Colin O&#x27;Connor features 330 Roman stone bridges for traffic, 34 Roman timber bridges and 54 Roman aqueduct bridges, a substantial part still standing and even used to carry vehicles. A more complete survey by the Italian scholar Vittorio Galliazzo found 931 Roman bridges, mostly of stone, in as many as 26 countries (including former Yugoslavia).

Roman arch bridges were usually semicircular, although a number were segmental arch bridges (such as Alconétar Bridge), a bridge which has a curved arch that is less than a semicircle. The advantages of the segmental arch bridge were that it allowed great amounts of flood water to pass under it, which would prevent the bridge from being swept away during floods and the bridge itself could be more lightweight. Generally, Roman bridges featured wedge-shaped primary arch stones (voussoirs) of the same in size and shape. The Romans built both single spans and lengthy multiple arch aqueducts, such as the Pont du Gard and Segovia Aqueduct. Their bridges featured from an early time onwards flood openings in the piers, e.g. in the Pons Fabricius in Rome (62 BC), one of the world&#x27;s oldest major bridges still standing.

Roman engineers were the first and until the Industrial Revolution the only ones to construct bridges with concrete, which they called Opus caementicium. The outside was usually covered with brick or ashlar, as in the Alcántara Bridge.

The Romans also introduced segmental arch bridges into bridge construction. The Limyra Bridge in southwestern Turkey features 26 segmental arches with an average span-to-rise ratio of 5.3:1, giving the bridge an unusually flat profile unsurpassed for more than a millennium. Trajan&#x27;s bridge over the Danube featured open-spandrel segmental arches made of wood (standing on concrete piers). This was to be the longest arch bridge for a thousand years both in terms of overall and individual span length, while the longest extant Roman bridge is the long Puente Romano at Mérida. The late Roman Karamagara Bridge in Cappadocia may represent the earliest surviving bridge featuring a pointed arch.

In medieval Europe, bridge builders improved on the Roman structures by using narrower piers, thinner arch barrels and higher span-to-rise ratios on bridges. Gothic pointed arches were also introduced, reducing lateral thrust, and spans increased as with the eccentric Puente del Diablo (1282).

The 14th century in particular saw bridge building reaching new heights. Span lengths of , previously unheard of in the history of masonry arch construction, were now reached in places as diverse as Spain (Puente de San Martín), Italy (Castelvecchio Bridge) and France (Devil&#x27;s bridge and Pont Grand) and with arch types as different as semi-circular, pointed and segmental arches. The bridge at Trezzo sull&#x27;Adda, destroyed in the 15th century, even featured a span length of , not matched until 1796.

Constructions such as the acclaimed Florentine segmental arch bridge Ponte Vecchio (1345) combined sound engineering (span-to-rise ratio of over 5.3 to 1) with aesthetical appeal. The three elegant arches of the Renaissance Ponte Santa Trinita (1569) constitute the oldest elliptic arch bridge worldwide. Such low rising structures required massive abutments, which at the Venetian Rialto bridge and the Fleischbrücke in Nuremberg (span-to-rise ratio 6.4:1) were founded on thousands of wooden piles, partly rammed obliquely into the grounds to counteract more effectively the lateral thrust.
In China, the oldest existing arch bridge is the Zhaozhou Bridge of 605 AD, which combined a very low span-to-rise ratio of 5.2:1, with the use of spandrel arches (buttressed with iron brackets). The Zhaozhou Bridge, with a length of and span of , is the world&#x27;s first wholly stone open-spandrel segmental arch bridge, allowing a greater passage for flood waters. Bridges with perforated spandrels can be found worldwide, such as in China (Zhaozhou Bridge, 7th century). Greece (Bridge of Arta, 17th century) and Wales (Cenarth Bridge, 18th century).

In more modern times, stone and brick arches continued to be built by many civil engineers, including Thomas Telford, Isambard Kingdom Brunel and John Rennie. A key pioneer was Jean-Rodolphe Perronet, who used much narrower piers, revised calculation methods and exceptionally low span-to-rise ratios. Different materials, such as cast iron, steel and concrete have been increasingly used in the construction of arch bridges.

== Simple compression arch bridges ==
=== Advantages of simple materials ===
Stone, brick and other such materials are strong in compression and somewhat so in shear, but cannot resist much force in tension. As a result, masonry arch bridges are designed to be constantly under compression, so far as is possible. Each arch is constructed over a temporary falsework frame, known as a centring. In the first compression arch bridges, a keystone in the middle of the bridge bore the weight of the rest of the bridge. The more weight that was put onto the bridge, the stronger its structure became. Masonry arch bridges use a quantity of fill material (typically compacted rubble) above the arch in order to increase this dead-weight on the bridge and prevent tension from occurring in the arch ring as loads move across the bridge. Other materials that were used to build this type of bridge were brick and unreinforced concrete. When masonry (cut stone) is used the angles of the faces are cut to minimize shear forces. Where random masonry (uncut and unprepared stones) is used they are mortared together and the mortar is allowed to set before the falsework is removed.

Traditional masonry arches are generally durable, and somewhat resistant to settlement or undermining. However, relative to modern alternatives, such bridges are very heavy, requiring extensive foundations. They are also expensive to build wherever labor costs are high.

===Construction sequence===
* Where the arches are founded in a watercourse bed (on piers or banks) the water is diverted so the gravel can first be excavated and replaced with a good footing (of strong material). From these, the foundation piers are erected/raised to the height of the intended base of the arches, a point known as the springing.
* Falsework centering (in British English: arch frame) is fabricated, typically from timbers and boards. Since each arch of a multi-arch bridge will impose a thrust upon its neighbors, it is necessary either that all arches of the bridge be raised at the same time, or that very wide piers be used. The thrust from the end arches is taken into the earth by substantial (vertical) footings at the canyon walls, or by large inclined planes forming in a sense ramps to the bridge, which may also be formed of arches.
* The several arches are (or single arch is) constructed over the centering. Once each basic arch barrel is constructed, the arches are (or arch is) stabilized with infill masonry above, which may be laid in horizontal running bond courses (layers). These may form two outer walls, known as the spandrels, which are then infilled with appropriate loose material and rubble.
* The road is paved and parapet walls protectively confine traffic to the bridge.

== Types of arch bridge ==
=== Corbel arch bridge ===
The corbel arch bridge is a masonry, or stone, bridge where each successively higher course (layer) cantilevers slightly more than the previous course. The steps of the masonry may be trimmed to make the arch have a rounded shape. The corbel arch does not produce thrust, or outward pressure at the bottom of the arch, and is not considered a true arch. It is more stable than a true arch because it does not have this thrust. The disadvantage is that this type of arch is not suitable for large spans.

=== Aqueducts and canal viaducts ===
In some locations it is necessary to span a wide gap at a relatively high elevation, such as when a canal or water supply must span a valley. Rather than building extremely large arches, or very tall supporting columns (difficult using stone), a series of arched structures are built one atop another, with wider structures at the base. Roman civil engineers developed the design and constructed highly refined structures using only simple materials, equipment, and mathematics. This type is still used in canal viaducts and roadways as it has a pleasing shape, particularly when spanning water, as the reflections of the arches form a visual impression of circles or ellipses.


=== Deck arch bridge ===

This type of bridge comprises an arch where the deck is completely above the arch. The area between the arch and the deck is known as the spandrel. If the spandrel is solid, usually the case in a masonry or stone arch bridge, the bridge is called a &quot;closed-spandrel deck arch bridge&quot;. If the deck is supported by a number of vertical columns rising from the arch, the bridge is known as an &quot;open-spandrel deck arch bridge&quot;. The Alexander Hamilton Bridge is an example of an open-spandrel arch bridge. Finally, if the arch supports the deck only at the top of the arch, the bridge is called a cathedral arch bridge.


=== Through arch bridge ===

This type of bridge has an arch whose base is at or below the deck, but whose top rises above it, so the deck passes through the arch. The central part of the deck is supported by the arch via suspension cables or tie bars, as with a tied-arch bridge. The ends of the bridge may be supported from below, as with a deck arch bridge. Any part supported from arch below may have spandrels that are closed or open.

The Sydney Harbour Bridge and the Bayonne Bridge are a through arch bridge which uses a truss type arch.

=== Tied-arch bridge ===
Also known as a bowstring arch, this type of arch bridge incorporates a tie between two opposite ends of the arch. The tie is usually the deck and is capable of withstanding the horizontal thrust forces which would normally be exerted on the abutments of an arch bridge.

The deck is suspended from the arch. The arch is in compression, in contrast to a suspension bridge where the catenary is in tension. A tied-arch bridge can also be a through arch bridge.

=== Hinged arch bridge ===
An arch bridge with hinges incorporated to allow movement between structural elements. A single-hinged bridge has a hinge at the crown of the arch, a two-hinged bridge has hinges at both springing points and a three-hinged bridge has hinged in all three locations.

==Gallery==


== Use of modern materials ==
Most modern arch bridges are made from reinforced concrete. This type of bridge is suitable where a temporary centring may be erected to support the forms, reinforcing steel, and uncured concrete. When the concrete is sufficiently set the forms and falseworks are then removed. It is also possible to construct a reinforced concrete arch from precast concrete, where the arch is built in two halves which are then leaned against each other.

Many modern bridges, made of steel or reinforced concrete, often bear some of their load by tension within their structure. This reduces or eliminates the horizontal thrust against the abutments and allows their construction on weaker ground. Structurally and analytically they are not true arches but rather a beam with the shape of an arch. See truss arch bridge for more on this type.

A modern evolution of the arch bridge is the long-span through arch bridge. This has been made possible by the use of light materials that are strong in tension such as steel and prestressed concrete.

<text>Boehme&#x27;s giant day gecko (&quot;Phelsuma madagascariensis boehmei&quot;) is a diurnal species of gecko, a lizard in the family Gekkonidae. The species is endemic to eastern Madagascar and typically inhabits rainforests and dwells on trees. Boehme&#x27;s giant day gecko feeds on insects and nectar.

==Etymology==
Both the specific name, &quot;boehmei&quot;, and the common name, Boehme&#x27;s giant day gecko, are in honor of German herpetologist Wolfgang Böhme.

==Description==
&quot;P. m. boehmei&quot; is among the largest living day geckos. It can reach a total length of about . The body colour is bright green. The skin between the scales has a black colour. A dark red-coloured stripe extends from the nostril to behind the eye. On the head and back there are irregularly shaped brownish or red-brick-coloured dots.

==Geographic range==
Boehme&#x27;s giant day gecko only inhabits the region around Andasibe and Ranomafana in eastern Madagascar.

==Habitat==
&quot;P. m. boehmei&quot; is a rainforest species and is often found on trees high in the canopy. The east coast of Madagascar has a humid and warm climate. However, from June–August, the night temperature can be as low as and around during the day.

==Diet==
Boehme&#x27;s giant day gecko feeds on various insects and other invertebrates. It also likes to lick soft, sweet fruit, pollen and nectar.

==Behaviour==
&quot;P. m. boehmei&quot; is apparently not as quarrelsome as other members of the genus &quot;Phelsuma&quot;.

==Reproduction==
The pairing season of Boehme&#x27;s giant day gecko is between November and January. During this period, the females lay up to 6 pairs of eggs. At a temperature of , the young will hatch after approximately 48–55 days. The hatchlings measure .

==Care and maintenance in captivity==
&quot;P. m. boehmei&quot; should be housed in pairs, and needs a large, well planted terrarium. The humidity should be maintained between 75 and 100%. It is often suggested (McKeown, 1993; Henkel &amp; Schmidt, 1995) that the daytime temperature should be between between November and January. These authors also suggest that between July and August, the daytime temperature should be while dropping it to at night. This way one simulates the rainforest environment. However, the period between July and August corresponds with the warmest months on the northern hemisphere so active cooling might be necessary. For some breeders it therefore may be more adequate to shift this essential drop in temperature to the colder months (November–January) and the higher temperature to the months April–August. In captivity, &quot;P. m. boehmei&quot; can be fed with crickets, wax moths, fruit flies, mealworms, and houseflies.

<doc id="318280" wikidata="Q157655" url="?curid=318280" title="Mairead Maguire">
<text>Mairead Maguire (born 27 January 1944), also known as Mairead Corrigan Maguire and formerly as Mairéad Corrigan, is a peace activist from Northern Ireland. She co-founded, with Betty Williams and Ciaran McKeown, the Women for Peace, which later became the Community for Peace People, an organization dedicated to encouraging a peaceful resolution of the Troubles in Northern Ireland. Maguire and Williams were awarded the 1976 Nobel Peace Prize.

==Early life (1944–1976)==
Maguire was born into a Roman Catholic community in Belfast, Northern Ireland, the second of eight children – five sisters and two brothers. Her parents were Andrew and Margaret Corrigan. She attended St. Vincent&#x27;s Primary School, a private Catholic school, until the age of 14, at which time her family could no longer pay for her schooling. After working for a time as a babysitter at a Catholic community centre, she was able to save enough money to enroll in a year of business classes at Miss Gordon&#x27;s Commercial College, which led her at the age of 16 to a job as an accounting clerk with a local factory. She volunteered regularly with the Legion of Mary, spending her evenings and weekends working with children and visiting inmates at Long Kesh prison. When she was 21 she began working as a secretary for the Guinness brewery, where she remained employed until December 1976.

Maguire told &quot;The Progressive&quot; in 2013 that her early Catholic heroes included Dorothy Day and the Berrigan brothers.

==Northern Ireland peace movement (1976–1980)==
Maguire became active with the Northern Ireland peace movement after three children of her sister, Anne Maguire, were run over and killed by a car driven by Danny Lennon, a Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) fugitive who had been fatally shot by British troops while trying to make a getaway. Danny Lennon had been released from prison in April 1976 after serving three years for suspected involvement in the IRA. On 10 August, Lennon and accomplice John Chillingworth were transporting an Armalite rifle through Andersonstown, Belfast, when British troops, claiming to have seen a rifle pointed at them, opened fire on the vehicle, instantly killing Lennon and critically wounding Chillingworth. The car Lennon drove went out of control and mounted a pavement on Finaghy Road North, colliding with Anne Maguire and three of her children who were out shopping. Joanne (8) and Andrew (6 weeks) died at the scene; John Maguire (2) succumbed to his injuries at a hospital the following day.

Betty Williams, a resident of Andersonstown who happened to be driving by, witnessed the tragedy and accused the IRA of firing at the British patrol and provoking the incident. In the days that followed she began gathering signatures for a peace petition from Protestants and Catholics and was able to assemble some 200 women to march for peace in Belfast. The march passed near the home of Maguire (then Mairead Corrigan) who joined it. She and Williams thus became &quot;the joint leaders of a virtually spontaneous mass movement.&quot;

The next march, to the burial sites of the three Maguire children, brought 10,000 Protestant and Catholic women together. The marchers, including Maguire and Williams, were physically attacked by IRA members. By the end of the month Maguire and Williams had brought 35,000 people onto the streets of Belfast petitioning for peace between the republican and loyalist factions. Initially adopting the name &quot;Women for Peace,&quot; the movement changed its name to the gender-neutral &quot;Community of Peace People,&quot; or simply &quot;Peace People,&quot; when &quot;Irish Press&quot; correspondent Ciaran McKeown joined. In contrast with the prevailing climate at the time, Maguire was convinced that the most effective way to end the violence was not through violence but through re-education. The organization published a biweekly paper, Peace by Peace, and provided for families of prisoners a bus service to and from Belfast&#x27;s jails. In 1977, she and Betty Williams received the 1976 Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts. Aged 32 at the time, she was the youngest Nobel Peace Prize laureate until Malala Yousafzai was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.

==After the Nobel Prize (since 1980)==
Though Betty Williams resigned from the Peace People in 1980, Maguire has continued her involvement in the organization to this day and has served as the group&#x27;s honorary president. It has since taken on a more global agenda, addressing an array of social and political issues from around the world.
In January 1980, after a prolonged battle with depression over the loss of her children in the 1976 Finaghy Road incident, Maguire&#x27;s sister Anne committed suicide. A year and a half later, in September 1981, Mairead married Jackie Maguire, who was her late sister&#x27;s widower. She has three stepchildren and two children of her own, John Francis (b. 1982) and Luke (b. 1984).

In 1981 Maguire co-founded the Committee on the Administration of Justice, a nonsectarian organisation dedicated to defending human rights.

She is a member of the anti-abortion group Consistent Life Ethic, which is against abortion, capital punishment and euthanasia.

Maguire has been involved in a number of campaigns on behalf of political prisoners around the world. In 1993 she and six other Nobel Peace Prize laureates tried unsuccessfully to enter Myanmar from Thailand to protest the protracted detention of opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi. She was a first signatory on a 2008 petition calling on Turkey to end its torture of Kurdish leader Abdullah Öcalan. In October 2010, she signed a petition calling on China to release Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo from house arrest.

Maguire was selected in 2003 to serve on the honorary board of the International Coalition for the Decade, a coalition of national and international groups, presided over by Christian Renoux, whose aim was to promote the United Nations&#x27; 1998 vision of the first decade of the twenty-first century as the International Decade for the Promotion of a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for the Children of the World.

In 2006, Maguire was one of the founders of the Nobel Women&#x27;s Initiative along with fellow Peace Prize laureates Betty Williams, Shirin Ebadi, Wangari Maathai, Jody Williams, and Rigoberta Menchú Tum. The Initiative describes itself as six women representing North and South America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa who decided to bring together their &quot;extraordinary experiences in a united effort for peace with justice and equality&quot; and &quot;to help strengthen work being done in support of women&#x27;s rights around the world&quot;.

Maguire supported the Occupy movement and has described WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange as &quot;very courageous&quot;. She has also praised Chelsea Manning. &quot;I think they&#x27;ve been tremendously courageous in telling the truth&quot;, she has said, adding that &quot;the American government and NATO have destroyed Iraq and Afghanistan. Their next targets will be Syria and Iran&quot;.

Together with Desmond Tutu and Adolfo Pérez Esquivel, Maguire published a letter in support of Chelsea Manning, saying: &quot;The words attributed to Manning reveal that he went through a profound moral struggle between the time he enlisted and when he became a whistleblower. Through his experience in Iraq, he became disturbed by top-level policy that undervalued human life and caused the suffering of innocent civilians and soldiers. Like other courageous whistleblowers, he was driven foremost by a desire to reveal the truth&quot;.

Maguire has also earned a degree from the Irish School of Ecumenics at Trinity College Dublin. She works with various interchurch and interfaith organizations and is a councilor with the International Peace Council. She is also a Patron of the Methodist Theological College, and of the Northern Ireland Council for Integrated Education.

In April 2019 Maguire collected the 2019 &quot;GUE/NGL Award for Journalists, Whistleblowers &amp; Defenders of the Right to Information&quot; on behalf of Julian Assange who was at the time imprisoned by the United Kingdom.

Maguire is an outspoken critic of U.S. and British policy in the Middle East, particularly in Iraq and Afghanistan. She has also been personally critical of U.S. President Barack Obama&#x27;s leadership. Her activism in the U.S. has occasionally brought her into confrontations with the law.

After initially accepting an invitation to a 2012 Nobel summit in Chicago, she changed her mind because the event was hosted by the U.S. State Department, &quot;and to me the Nobel Peace laureates should not be hosted by a State Department that is continuing with war, removing basic civil liberties and human rights and international law and then talking about peace to young people. That&#x27;s a double standard&quot;.

Maguire said in a 2013 interview that ever since her 40-day fast and arrest outside the White House in 2003 (see below), &quot;whenever I now come into America, I&#x27;m always questioned as to what my background is&quot;.

In 2015, Maguire spoke with &quot;Democracy Now&quot; in a sit-down interview titled, &quot;No to Violence, Yes to Dialogue&quot;, which included two other Nobel Peace Prize Laureates, Jody Williams and Leymah Gbowee. Maguire discussed the desire &quot;to end militarism and war, and to build peace and international law and human rights and democracy&quot;.

====Iraq and Afghanistan====
Maguire voiced strong opposition to the U.N. sanctions against Iraq, which is alleged by some to have resulted in hundreds of thousands of civilian deaths, calling them &quot;unjust and inhuman&quot;, &quot;a new kind of bomb&quot;, and &quot;even more cruel than weapons&quot;. During a visit to Baghdad with Argentinian colleague Adolfo Pérez Esquivel in March 1999, Maguire urged then-U.S. President Bill Clinton and British Prime Minister Tony Blair to end the bombing of Iraq and to permit the lifting of U.N. sanction. &quot;I have seen children dying with their mothers next to them and not being able to do anything&quot;, Maguire said. &quot;They are not soldiers&quot;.

In the aftermath of al-Qaeda&#x27;s attacks on the U.S. in September 2001, as it became clear that the U.S. would retaliate and deploy troops in Afghanistan, Maguire campaigned against the impending war. In India she claimed to have marched with &quot;hundreds of thousands of Indian people walking for peace&quot;. In New York, Maguire was reported to have marched with 10,000 protesters, purportedly including families of 9/11 victims, as U.S. war planes were already en route to strike Taliban targets in Afghanistan.

In the period leading up to the March 2003 invasion of Iraq, Maguire campaigned vigorously against the anticipated hostilities. Speaking at the 23rd War Resisters&#x27; International Conference in Dublin, Ireland in August 2002, Maguire called on the Irish government to oppose the Iraq War &quot;in every European and world forum of which they are a part&quot;. On 17 March 2003, St. Patrick&#x27;s Day, Maguire protested the war outside the United Nations Headquarters with, among other activists, Frida Berrigan. On 19 March, Maguire addressed an audience of 300 people in a chapel at Le Moyne College in Syracuse, N.Y. &quot;Armies with all their advanced weapons of mass destruction are facing the Iraqi people who have nothing&quot;, she told the crowd. &quot;In anybody&#x27;s language, it&#x27;s not fair&quot;. Around this time, Maguire held a 30-day vigil and began a 40-day liquid fast outside the White House, joined by members of Pax Christi USA and Christian church leaders. As the war got under way in the days that followed, Maguire described the invasion as an &quot;ongoing and shameful slaughter&quot;. &quot;Daily we sit, facing Mecca in solidarity with our Muslim brothers and sisters in Iraq, and we ask Allah for forgiveness&quot;, she said in a statement to the press on 31 March. Maguire would later remark that the media in the U.S. distorted news from Iraq and that the Iraq War was carried out in pursuit of American &quot;economic and military interests&quot;. In February 2006 she expressed her belief that George W. Bush and Tony Blair &quot;should be made accountable for illegally taking the world to war and for war crimes against humanity&quot;.

====Criticism of President Barack Obama====
Maguire expressed disappointment with the selection of U.S. President Barack Obama as winner of the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize. &quot;They say this is for his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and co-operation between peoples&quot;, she said, &quot;and yet he continues the policy of militarism and occupation of Afghanistan, instead of dialogue and negotiations with all the parties to the conflict. [...] Giving this award to the leader of the most militarised country in the world, which has taken the human family against its will to war, will rightly be seen by many people around the world as a reward for his country&#x27;s aggression and domination&quot;.

After declining to meet with the Dalai Lama during his visit to the U.S. in 2008, citing conflicting travel schedules, Obama declined to meet with the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader again in 2009. Maguire condemned what she considered Obama&#x27;s deliberate refusal to meet with the Dalai Lama, calling it &quot;horrifying&quot;.

Speaking at the Carl von Ossietzky Medal Award Ceremony in Berlin in December 2010, Maguire imputed criminal accountability to President Obama for violation of international law. &quot;When President Obama says he wants to see a world without nuclear weapons and says, in respect of Iran and their alleged nuclear weapons ambitions, that &#x27;all option are on the table,&#x27; this is clearly a threat to use nuclear weapons, clearly a criminal threat against Iran, under the world court advisory opinion. The Nuremberg Charter of 8 August 1945 says the threat or use of nuclear weapons is criminal, so officials in all nine nuclear weapons states who maintain and use nuclear deterrence as a threat are committing crimes and breaking international law&quot;.

====Confrontations with the law====
Maguire was twice arrested in the United States. On 17 March 2003, she was arrested outside the United Nations headquarters in New York City during a protest against the Iraq War. Later that month, on 27 March, she was one of 65 anti-war protesters briefly taken into custody by police after penetrating a security barricade near the White House.

In May 2009, following a visit to Guatemala, immigration authorities at the Houston Airport in Texas detained Maguire for a number of hours, during which time she was questioned, fingerprinted and photographed, and consequently missed her connecting flight to Northern Ireland. &quot;They insisted I must tick the box in the Immigration form admitting to criminal activities,&quot; she explained. In late July that same year, Maguire was again detained by immigration authorities, this time at the Dulles International Airport in Virginia, on her way from Ireland to New Mexico to meet with colleague Jody Williams. As in May, the delay resulted in Maguire missing her connecting flight.

===Israel===
Maguire first visited Israel at age 40 in 1984. She came then as part of an interfaith initiative seeking forgiveness from Jews for years of persecution by Christians in Jesus&#x27; name. Her second visit was in June 2000, this time in response to invitations from Rabbis for Human Rights and the Israeli Committee Against House Demolitions. The two groups had taken upon themselves to defend Ahmed Shamasneh in an Israeli military court against charges of illegally constructing his home in the West Bank town of Qatanna, and Maguire traveled to Israel to observe the court proceedings and support the Shamasneh family.

In a 2013 interview, she omitted any mention of her 1984 trip to Israel, saying that &quot;I first went to Israel/Palestine at the invitation of Rabbis for Human Rights and the Israeli Committee against House Demolitions&quot; and &quot;was absolutely horrified&quot; at Palestinians&#x27; living conditions. It was after that visit that she &quot;started going on a regular basis&quot; because she was &quot;very hopeful that there is a solution to the Israeli/Palestinian injustice. In Northern Ireland, people said there would never be a solution. But once people begin to have the political will and force their governments to sit down, it can happen&quot;.
Maguire has at times been fiercely critical of the State of Israel, even calling for its membership in the United Nations to be revoked or suspended. She has accused the Israeli government of &quot;carrying out a policy of ethnic cleansing against Palestinians...in east Jerusalem&quot; and supports boycott and divestment initiatives against Israel. Concomitantly, Maguire has also said that she loves Israel and that &quot;to live in Israel for Jewish people, is to live in fear of suicide bombs and Kassam rockets&quot;.

A 2013 profile of Maguire in The Progressive noted that &quot;she hasn&#x27;t lost her passion yet&quot; and that &quot;it is the Israeli occupation of Palestine that has occupied much of her attention in recent years&quot;.

====Mordechai Vanunu advocacy====
Maguire has been a vocal supporter of Mordechai Vanunu, a former Israeli nuclear technician who revealed details of Israel&#x27;s nuclear defence program to the British press in 1986 and subsequently served 18 years in prison for treason. Maguire flew to Israel in April 2004 to greet Vanunu upon his release and has since flown to meet with him in Israel on several occasions.

In an open letter addressed to the Israeli people in July 2010, after Vanunu was returned to prison for violating the terms of his parole, Maguire urged Jews in Israel to petition their government for Vanunu&#x27;s release and freedom. She praised Vanunu as &quot;a man of peace&quot;, &quot;a great visionary&quot;, &quot;a true Gandhian spirit&quot; and compared his actions to those of Alfred Nobel.

====References to the Holocaust====
At a joint press conference with Mordechai Vanunu in Jerusalem in December 2004, Maguire compared Israel&#x27;s nuclear weapons to the Nazi gas chambers in Auschwitz. &quot;When I think about nuclear weapons, I&#x27;ve been to Auschwitz concentration camp&quot;. She added, &quot;Nuclear weapons are only gas chambers perfected ... and for a people who already know what gas chambers are, how can you even think of building perfect gas chambers&quot;.

In January 2006, close to Holocaust Memorial Day, Maguire asked that Mordechai Vanunu be remembered together with the Jews that perished in the Holocaust. &quot;As we, with sorrow and sadness, remember the Holocaust Victims, we remember too those individuals of conscience who refused to be silenced in the face of danger and paid with their freedom and lives in defending their Jewish brothers and sisters, and we remember our brother Mordechai Vanunu – the lonely Israeli prisoner in his own country, who refused to be silent&quot;.

In a speech delivered in February 2006 to the Nuclear Age Peace Foundation in Santa Barbara, California, Maguire again made a comparison between nuclear weapons and the Nazis. &quot;Last April some of us protested at Dimona Nuclear Plant, in Israel, calling for it to be open to UN Inspection, and bombs to be destroyed. Israeli Jets flew overhead, and a train passed into the Dimona nuclear site. This brought back to me vivid memories of my visit to Auschwitz concentration camp, with its rail tracks, trains, destruction and death&quot;.

Maguire firmly denied comparing Israel to Nazi Germany in an interview with Tal Schneider of &quot;Lady Globes&quot; in November 2010. &quot;I have for years been speaking out against nuclear weapons. I am actively opposed to nuclear weapons in Britain, in the United States, in Israel, in any country, because nuclear weapons are the ultimate destruction of humankind. But I have never said that Israel is like Nazi Germany, and I don&#x27;t know why I am quoted like that in Israel. I also never compared Gaza to an extermination camp. I visited the death camps in Austria, with Nobel Prize laureate Elie Wiesel, and I think it is terrible that people did not try to stop the genocide of the Jewish people&quot;.

====Palestinian activism====
Maguire said in a 2007 speech that Israel&#x27;s separation wall &quot;is a monument to fear and failed politics&quot; and that &quot;for many Palestinians daily living is so hard, it is indeed an act of resistance.&quot; She praised the &quot;inspirational work of the International Solidarity Movement&quot; and paid tribute to the memory of &quot;Rachel Corrie, who gave her life protesting the demolition of Palestinian homes by Israeli military&quot;, saying that &quot;it is the Rachels of this world who reminds us that we are responsible for each other, and we are interconnected in a mysteriously spiritual and beautiful way&quot;.

On 20 April 2007, Maguire participated in a protest against the construction of Israel&#x27;s separation barrier outside the Palestinian village of Bil&#x27;in. The protest was held in a no-access military zone. Israeli forces used tear-gas grenades and rubber-coated bullets in an effort to disperse the protesters, while the protesters hurled rocks at the Israeli troops, injuring two Border Guard policemen. One rubber bullet hit Maguire in the leg, whereupon she was transferred to an Israeli hospital for treatment. She was also reported to have inhaled large quantities of tear gas.

In October 2008, Maguire arrived in Gaza aboard the SS &quot;Dignity&quot;. Although Israel had insisted that the yacht would not be permitted to approach Gaza, then-Prime Minister Ehud Olmert ultimately capitulated and allowed the ship to sail to its destination without incident. During her stay in Gaza, Maguire met with Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh. She was photographed accepting an honorary golden plate depicting the Palestinian flag draped over all of Israel and the occupied territories.

In March 2009, Maguire joined a campaign for the immediate and unconditional removal of Hamas from the European Union list of proscribed terrorist organisations.
On 30 June 2009, Maguire was taken into custody by the Israeli military along with twenty others, including former U.S. Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney. She was on board a small ferry, the MV &quot;Spirit of Humanity&quot; (formerly the &quot;Arion&quot;), said to be carrying humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip, when Israel intercepted the vessel off the coast of Gaza. From an Israeli prison, she gave a lengthy interview with Democracy Now! via cell phone, and was deported on 7 July 2009 to Dublin. on 2 July 2009. In the interview, she rejected Israeli authorities&#x27; claim that aid can pass freely into Gaza, charging that &quot;Gaza is like a huge prison...a huge occupied territory of one-and-a-half million people who have been subjected to collective punishment by the Israeli government&quot;. She further said that &quot;the tragedy is that the American government, the UN and Europe, they remain silent in the face of the abuse of Palestinian human rights, like freedom, and it&#x27;s really tragic&quot;. In addition, she claimed that when her boat was approached by Israeli naval vessels in international waters, &quot;we were in grave danger of actually being killed at that point...really we were in a very, very dangerous position. So we were literally hijacked, taken at gunpoint by the Israeli military&quot;.

In May–June 2010, Maguire was a passenger on board the MV &quot;Rachel Corrie&quot;, one of seven vessels that were part of the Gaza Freedom Flotilla, a flotilla of pro-Palestinian activists that attempted to bust the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of the Gaza Strip. In an interview with BBC Radio Ulster while still at sea, Maguire called the blockade an &quot;inhumane, illegal siege.&quot; Having been delayed due to mechanical problems, the &quot;Rachel Corrie&quot; did not actually sail with the flotilla and only approached the Gazan coast several days after the main flotilla did. In contrast with the violence that characterised the arrival of the first six ships, Israel&#x27;s takeover of the &quot;Rachel Corrie&quot; was met only with passive resistance. Israeli naval forces were even lowered a ladder by the passengers to assist their ascent onto the deck. After the incident, Maguire said she did not feel her life was in danger as the ship&#x27;s captain, Derek Graham, had been in touch with the Israeli navy to assure them that there would be no violent resistance.

On 28 September 2010, Maguire landed in Israel as part of a delegation of the Nobel Women&#x27;s Initiative. She was refused an entry visa by Israeli authorities on the grounds that she had twice in the past tried to run Israel&#x27;s naval embargo of the Gaza Strip and that a 10-year exclusion order was in effect against her. She fought her deportation with the help of Adalah, an NGO devoted to the rights of Palestinians in Israel. Fatmeh El-Ajou, an attorney for Adalah noted, &quot;We believe that the decision to refuse entry to Ms. Maguire is based on illegitimate, irrelevant, and arbitrary political considerations&quot;. Her legal team filed a petition against the order with the Central District Court on Maguire&#x27;s behalf, but the court ruled pronounced that the deportation order was valid. Maguire then appealed to Israel&#x27;s Supreme Court. Initially, the Court proposed that Maguire be allowed to remain in the country for a few days on bail despite the deportation order; however, the state rejected the proposal, arguing that Maguire had known prior to her arrival she was barred from entering Israel and that her conduct amounted to taking the law into her own hands. A three-judge panel accepted the state&#x27;s position and upheld the ruling of the Central District Court. At one point during the hearing, Maguire reportedly spoke up, saying that Israel must stop &quot;its apartheid policy and the siege on Gaza&quot;. One of the judges scolded her saying, &quot;This is no place for propaganda&quot;. Corrigan-Maguire was deported on a flight to the UK the following morning, 5 October 2010.

As preparations for a second Gaza flotilla got underway in the summer of 2011, with the Irish MV Saoirse expected to take part, Maguire expressed her support for the campaign and called on Israel to grant the flotilla passengers safe passage to Gaza.

Maguire said in a December 2011 interview that &quot;Hamas is an elected party and should be recognized as such by all. It has the democratic vote and should be recognised&quot;. She pointed out that on her 2008 Gaza trip she had been invited to speak &quot;to the Hamas parliament&quot;.
In March 2014, Maguire tried to arrive to Gaza through Egypt, as a part of activist delegation which also included the American anti-war activist Medea Benjamin. The members of the delegation were arrested in Cairo, questioned and deported.

In 2016, Maguire attempted to break Israel&#x27;s naval blockade of the Gaza Strip along with 13 other activists on board the Women&#x27;s Boat to Gaza, until they were stopped by the Israeli Navy approximately offshore. The boat was escorted to the port of Ashdod. The Israeli military said the interception was brief and without injuries. Maguire complained that she and the activists were &quot;arrested, kidnapped, illegally, in international waters and taken against our wishes to Israel&quot;.

===Comparison of Palestinians and Israelis===
Maguire has more than once suggested that Palestinians are more interested in peace than the Israeli government. She said in a 2011 interview that when she and some colleagues left Gaza in 2008, &quot;we were very hopeful because there is a passionate desire among the Palestinian people for peace, and then Operation Cast Lead started the following week. That was horrific&quot;. Israel, she said, had killed Palestinian farmers and fishermen who were just &quot;trying to fish for their families&quot;, thus proving &quot;that the Israeli government does not want peace&quot;. In a 2013 interview, she repeated the same point, saying that in Gaza in 2008, she had been told by Hamas and Fatah leaders &quot;that they want dialogue and peace&quot;, yet a week later &quot;Israel bombed Gaza, committing war crimes&quot;, showing &quot;that there is no political will for peace in the Israeli government&quot;.

=== Russell Tribunal===
In October 2012, Maguire traveled to New York City to serve on the Russell Tribunal on Israel/Palestine alongside writer Alice Walker, activist Angela Davis, former Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney, and Pink Floyd&#x27;s Roger Waters. During her participation in the Russell Tribunal, Maguire, according to one report, &quot;asked the question that seems to be taboo in the U.S.: Why does President Barack Obama allow Israel to threaten Iran with war when Iran has signed the NPT and Israel has at least 200 nuclear weapons? Why does the president not demand that Israel sign the NPT?&quot;

After her work on the Russell Tribunal was completed Maguire said that the experience had &quot;opened the mind, and deepened the understanding of all those present to the facts of the ongoing injustice which the Palestinians are daily suffering under Israeli siege and occupation. The RToP&#x27;s findings and conclusions challenge Governments and civil society to have courage and act by implementing sanctions, BDS etc., thereby refusing to be silent and complicit in the face of Israel&#x27;s violation of International Laws. The RToP was brilliant, informative and decisive, reminding us that all our Governments, and we the people, have a moral and legal responsibility to act to protect Human Rights and International Law and we cannot be silent when injustice is being done to anyone, anywhere&quot;.

== Rohingya issue ==

In March 2018, Maguire and two Nobel peace laureates Shirin Ebadi and Tawakkol Karman visited Rohingya camps in Cox&#x27;s Bazar and shared opinions on the crisis. After returning to Dhaka they discussed the Rohingya crisis with members of the civil society of Bangladesh.

==Personal philosophy and vision==

Mairead Maguire is a proponent of the belief that violence is a disease that humans develop but are not born with. She believes humankind is moving away from a mindset of violence and war and evolving to a higher consciousness of nonviolence and love. Among the figures she considers spiritual prophets in this regard are Jesus, Francis of Assisi, Gandhi, Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan, Fr. John L. McKenzie, and Martin Luther King Jr.

Maguire professes to rejects violence in all its forms. &quot;As a pacifist I believe that violence is never justified, and there are always alternatives to force and threat of force. We must challenge the society that tells us there is no such alternative. In all areas of our lives we should adopt nonviolence, in our lifestyles, our education, our commerce, our defence, and our governance.&quot; Maguire has called for the abolition of all armies and the establishment of a multi-national community of unarmed peacekeepers in their stead.

===The Vision of Peace: Faith and Hope in Northern Ireland===
Maguire has written a book, &quot;The Vision of Peace: Faith and Hope in Northern Ireland.&quot; Published in 2010, it is a collection of essays and letters, in many of which she discusses the connections between her political activities and her faith. Most of the book is about Northern Ireland, but Maguire also discusses the Holocaust, India, East Timor, and Yugoslavia. Maguire writes that &quot;hope for the future depends on each of us taking non-violence into our hearts and minds and developing new and imaginative structures which are non-violent and life-giving for all... Some people will argue that this is too idealistic. I believe it is very realistic... We can rejoice and celebrate today because we are living in a miraculous time. Everything is changing and everything is possible.&quot;

==Awards and honours==
Maguire has received numerous awards and honours in recognition of her work. Yale University awarded Maguire an honorary Doctor of Laws degree in 1977. In the same year, she received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. The College of New Rochelle awarded her an honorary degree 1978, as well. In 1998 Maguire received an honorary degree from Regis University, a Jesuit institution in Denver, Colorado. The University of Rhode Island awarded her an honorary degree in 2000. She was presented with the Science and Peace Gold Medal by the Albert Schweitzer International University in 2006, for meaningfully contributing to the spread of culture and the defence of world peace.

In 1990 she was awarded the Pacem in Terris Award, named after a 1963 encyclical letter by Pope John XXIII that called upon all people of good will to secure peace among all nations. The Davenport Catholic Interracial Council extolled Maguire for her peace efforts in Northern Ireland and for being &quot;a global force against violence in the name of religion.&quot; Pacem in terris is Latin for &quot;Peace on Earth&quot;.

The Nuclear Age Peace Foundation honoured Maguire with the Distinguished Peace Leadership Award in 1992, &quot;for her moral leadership and steadfast commitment to social justice and nonviolence.&quot;

==Criticism==
===Nobel Prize decision and Peace People movement===
Referring to the decision to award Maguire and Betty Williams the 1976 Nobel Peace Prize, journalist Michael Binyon of &quot;The Times&quot; commented, &quot;The Nobel committee has made controversial awards before. Some have appeared to reward hope rather than achievement.&quot; He described as sadly &quot;negligible&quot; the two women&#x27;s contribution to bringing peace to Northern Ireland.

Alex Maskey of Sinn Féin charged that at the time of the Troubles, the Peace People movement was hijacked by the British government and used to turn public opinion against Irish republicanism. &quot;For me and others, the Peace People and their good intentions were quickly exploited and absorbed into British state policy,&quot; Maskey opined.

Derek Brown, the Belfast correspondent for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, wrote that Maguire and Betty Williams were &quot;both formidably articulate and, in the best possible sense, utterly naive.&quot; He described their call for an end to violence in response to the will of the people as an &quot;awesomely impractical demand.&quot;

In his extensive study of the Peace People movement, Rob Fairmichael found that the Peace People were seen by some as being &quot;more anti-IRA than anti-UDA,&quot; i.e. more opposed to republican factions than to loyalist ones. Fairmichael also noted that &quot;Betty Williams and Mairead Corrigan were beaten up numerous times and at times the leaders were threatened by a hostile crowd.&quot; Fairmichael noted, as examples of forms that some of the extreme negative reactions took.

===Prize money controversy===
While most Nobel Prize laureates keep their prize money, it is not uncommon for prize winners to donate prize money to scientific, cultural or humanitarian causes. Maguire and Williams&#x27; decision to keep their prize funds created controversy in Northern Ireland. The move angered many people, including members of the Peace People, and fuelled unpleasant rumours about the two women. Rob Fairmichael writes of &quot;gossip of fur coats&quot; and concludes that the prize money controversy was perceived by the public, in the context of the Peace People&#x27;s eventual decline, as specifically problematic.

===Israeli and Pro-Israeli reactions===
In the wake of the 2009 Gaza flotilla, Ben-Dror Yemini, a popular columnist for the Israeli daily &quot;Ma&#x27;ariv&quot;, wrote that Maguire was obsessed with Israel. &quot;There is a lunatic coalition that does not concern itself with the slaughtered in Sri Lanka or with the oppressed Tibetans. They see only the struggle against the Israeli Satan.&quot; He further charged that Maguire chose to identify with a population that elected an openly antisemitic movement to lead it – one whose raison d&#x27;etre is the destruction of the Jewish state.

Eliaz Luf, the deputy head of the Israeli foreign mission to Canada, has argued that Maguire&#x27;s activism plays into the hands of Hamas and other terrorist organisations in Gaza.

Michael Elterman, Chairman of the Canada-Israel Committee Pacific Region, warned that Maguire&#x27;s actions, though probably well-intentioned, have promoted a hateful, antisemitic agenda.

In a 4 October 2010 editorial entitled &quot;The disingenuous Nobel laureate,&quot; the &quot;Jerusalem Post&quot; called Maguire&#x27;s comparison of Israel&#x27;s nuclear weapons to the gas chambers of Auschwitz &quot;outrageous&quot; and maintained that &quot;Israel can and must use its sovereignty to stop people like Maguire who are essentially seeking to endanger the lives of Israeli citizens.&quot; The Post applauded Maguire&#x27;s expulsion from Israel, &quot;not because of Maguire&#x27;s outrageous comparison in 2004 of Israel&#x27;s purported nuclear capability to Auschwitz&#x27;s gas chambers, nor because of her absurd, reprehensible accusation made in court Monday that Israel is an &quot;apartheid state&quot; perpetrating &quot;ethnic cleansing against Palestinians,&quot; but because she had taken &quot;actions that undermine Israel&#x27;s ability to protect itself.&quot;&quot;

The &quot;Post&quot; argued that if Maguire and others &quot;truly desire to improve the lives of Gazans, they should send their humanitarian aid in coordination with Israel,&quot; pressure Hamas &quot;and the other radical Islamists who control the Gaza Strip to stop senseless ballistic attacks on Israeli towns and villages, kibbutzim and moshavim,&quot; and &quot;insist that Hamas provide Gaza&#x27;s citizens with a stable, responsible leadership that respects human rights and religious freedom, as well as that it accept the UN-recognized right of the Jewish people to self-determination and political sovereignty in their historical homeland.&quot; But Maguire &quot;seems more intent on enabling Israel&#x27;s terrorist enemies,&quot; exploiting &quot;charges of a &#x27;humanitarian crisis&#x27; in Gaza in order to empower Hamas terrorists.&quot; Jewish and Israeli opinion is not all negative. Following the June 2010 Gaza flotilla raid, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was careful to distinguish between Maguire&#x27;s nonviolent resistance aboard the &quot;Rachel Corrie&quot;, which he referred to as &quot;a flotilla of peace activists – with whom we disagree, but whose right to a different opinion we respect,&quot; and the conduct of the activists aboard the other six vessels, which he described as &quot;a flotilla of hate, organized by violent, terrorism-supporting extremists.&quot; Gideon Levy strongly defended Maguire in the Israeli newspaper &quot;Haaretz&quot; in October 2010, calling her &quot;the victim of state terror&quot; after Israel refused to allow her to enter the country and kept her detained for several days.

<text>Marguerite Catherine Perey (19 October 1909 – 13 May 1975) was a French physicist and a student of Marie Curie. In 1939, Perey discovered the element francium by purifying samples of lanthanum that contained actinium. In 1962, she was the first woman to be elected to the French Académie des Sciences, an honor denied to her mentor Curie. Perey died of cancer in 1975.

==Early life==
Perey was born in 1909 in Villemomble, France, just outside Paris where the Curie&#x27;s Radium Institute was located. Although she hoped to study medicine, the death of her father left the family in financial difficulties.

Perey earned a chemistry diploma from Paris&#x27; Technical School of Women&#x27;s Education in 1929; while not a &quot;degree&quot;, it did qualify her to work as a chemistry technician. In 1929 at the age of 19, Perey interviewed for a role as a personal assistant (technician) to Marie Curie at Curie&#x27;s Radium Institute in Paris, France, and was hired. Marie Curie took on a mentoring role to Perey, taking her on as her personal assistant.

==Early career==
Under Marie Curie&#x27;s guidance at the Radium Institute, Perey learned how to isolate and purify radioactive elements, focusing on the chemical element actinium (discovered in Curie&#x27;s laboratory in 1899 by chemist André-Louis Debierne). Perey spent a decade sifting out actinium from all the other components of uranium ore, which Curie then used in her study of the decay of the element. Marie Curie died of aplastic anemia only five years after Perey began working with her, but Perey and Debierne continued their research on actinium and Perey was promoted to radiochemist.

==Discovery of francium==

In 1935, Perey read a paper by American scientists claiming to have discovered a type of radiation called beta particles being emitted by actinium and was skeptical because the reported energy of the beta particles didn&#x27;t seem to match actinium. She decided to investigate for herself, theorizing that actinium was decaying into another element (a daughter atom) and that the observed beta particles were actually coming from that daughter atom. She confirmed this by isolating extremely pure actinium and studying its radiation very quickly; she detected a small amount of alpha radiation, a type of radiation that involves the loss of protons and therefore changes an atom&#x27;s identity. Loss of an alpha particle (consisting of 2 protons and 2 neutrons) would turn actinium (element 89, with 89 protons) into the theorized but never-before-seen element 87.

Perey announced the discovery of the never-before-seen element 87 as a note in the &quot;Comptes Rendus&quot; presented at the Académie des Sciences by Jean Baptiste Perrin on 9 January 1939 with the title &quot;On an element 87, derived from actinium.&quot; Perey&#x27;s discovery was announced by Perrin, not Perey herself, because she was only a laboratory assistant with no university degree. Perey named the element francium, after her home country, and it joined the other alkali metals in Group 1 of the periodic table of elements. Francium is the second rarest element (after astatine) — only about 550g exists in the entire Earth&#x27;s crust at any given time — and it was the last element to be discovered in nature. (Five elements that were discovered synthetically were later found to exist in nature: technetium, promethium, astatine, neptunium, and plutonium.)

==Later career==

Perey received a grant to study at Paris&#x27; Sorbonne, but because she didn&#x27;t have a bachelor&#x27;s degree, the Sorbonne required her to take courses and obtain the equivalent of a B.S. to fulfill their PhD program requirements before she could earn her doctorate. She graduated from the Sorbonne in 1946 with a Doctorate of Physics. After obtaining her PhD, Perey returned to the Radium Institute as a senior scientist and worked there until 1949.

Perey was made the head of the department of nuclear chemistry at the University of Strasbourg in 1949, where she developed the university&#x27;s radiochemistry and nuclear chemistry program and continued her work on francium. She founded a laboratory that in 1958 became the Laboratory of Nuclear Chemistry in the Center for Nuclear Research, for which she served as director. She also served as a member of the Atomic Weights Commission from 1950 to 1963.

Because of her work with francium, Perey was nominated five times for a Nobel Prize, but she never received it.

Ironically, Perey hoped that francium would help diagnose cancer, but in fact it itself was carcinogenic, and Perey developed bone cancer which eventually killed her. Perey died on 13 May 1975 (age 65). She is credited with championing better safety measures for scientists working with radiation.

==Legacy==

Perey&#x27;s archives with materials dating from 1929 to 1975 are housed at the University of Strasbourg. They include laboratory notebooks, course materials from her work as professor of nuclear chemistry, papers from her laboratory directorship, and publications. All documents are currently held at the &quot;Archives départementales du Bas-Rhin&quot; (Departmental archives of the Bas-Rhin).

<doc id="318283" wikidata="Q5879848" url="?curid=318283" title="Holdout (gambling)">
<text>In gambling jargon, a holdout is any of numerous accessories used by cheats to help them &quot;hold-out&quot; a card (or cards) during a card game. Some holdout devices are extremely simple and require moderate or advanced manipulative skill to be used properly. On the other hand, there is a group of holdout devices which are mechanical in nature, therefore they fall under a separate category of holdout machines. Even if those machines are complex mechanical apparatuses, they still require a good level of skill from the cheat&#x27;s part, to be used so that they work but are not noticed.

Most of the holdout devices used today were invented in the 19th century. One of the most successful of these devices was used by J.P. Kepplinger around 1888. The Kepplinger holdout device and many others were described in detail by the magician John Nevil Maskelyne.

The main purpose of any holdout device is to temporarily hold a card out of the game, so that the cheat may retrieve it at some later convenient time. Only one card out of play can tremendously increase the odds of winning. The cheat not only knows the identity of this card (an advantage that no other player has) and knows that it couldn&#x27;t possibly be dealt to any other player, but this card also serves as if an extra card was dealt to the cheat on every round. In effect, this is as if the cheat was dealt a bonus card, so that he may decide which combination of cards he likes best and finally discard the unwanted one, only to possibly use it on the next round (or at least switch it for a better one).

==Types==
Some of the most popular holdouts are:
* the arm pressure, sleeve holdout
* the ring holdout
* the vest holdout
* the Kepplinger holdout
* the cuff holdout
* the Braden Mammone holdout, the term is now known as &quot;Momming-out&quot;

<text>Card players are those participating in a card game. Various names are given to card players based on their role or position.

== Position ==

=== Games of Anglo-American origin ===
In games of Anglo-American origin played in English-speaking countries, age refers to the order of priority in which players make the first lead, bid or bet, based on their position at the table. This changes constantly as the dealer rotates either clockwise or anticlockwise around the table. They are traditionally referred to as follows:

; Eldest hand (or elder hand): the player who enjoys greatest priority and e.g. is the first to receive cards in the deal. Elder is the non-dealer in two-hand games.

; Youngest hand (or younger hand): the player who has the lowest priority and who e.g. is the last to bid or play at the start of a game (often the dealer).

;Pone: Also pony or poney. Short for &quot;opponent&quot;. American or Old English term for non-dealer in some two-player games e.g. Colonel or the player on the dealer&#x27;s right, who cuts the cards, e.g. in Vingt-Un i.e. youngest hand.

Alternatively the players are simply numbered as follows:

;First hand: the player who leads to the first trick and who leads any bidding. Same as eldest hand or forehand.

;Second hand: the player who bids or plays second.

;Third hand: the player who bids or plays third.

;Fourth hand: the player who bids or plays fourth.

=== Games of European origin ===
In games originating in Europe, the following terminology indicating the players&#x27; priority is used:

;Forehand: the player who leads to the first trick and who leads any bidding. Same as eldest hand.

;Middlehand: the player between forehand and rearhand in a three-person game. In Skat and similar 3-hand games, the second player in turn to bid. In four-hand games, middlehand is the player after forehand so the order is: forehand, middlehand, rearhand, dealer.

;Rearhand: the player with least priority, e.g. the last to bid or play. Sometimes also called endhand.

== Roles ==
Players may also be referred to by their roles as follows:
;Active player: a player who receives cards in the current deal and is not sitting out temporarily because a) there are more players than the game is designed for, or b) they have withdrawn due to poor cards
;Adversary: an opponent (q.v.)
;Captain: in certain team games, the player who collects information from his teammate(s) and directs the tactics.
;Cutter: the player whose is entitled to cut the cards; usually the opposite side of the dealer to forehand (or eldest/elder hand).
;Dealer: the person who distributes or deals the cards to players in a card game.
;Declarer: the highest bidder, who declares and then strives to make good the stated contract.
;Defender: a player who plays against the declarer, usually with other defenders.
;King: in games where there is one player more than the rules permit, players take turns at being &#x27;king&#x27;, usually dealing and then sitting out. A king may or may not score points with the other players. A common practice in German games, but also found in e.g. American six-bid solo. In Low German the King was also called a &quot;Stillsitter&quot;, for example in Ombre whereby the fourth player, in turn, did not play but paid (or was paid).

;Opponent: a player of the opposing side; a defender (q.v); or any other player in a round game.
;Partner: a player who plays co-operatively in a team and who shares the winnings or losses. Partnerships may be fixed for the whole session or vary from deal to deal.
;Pitcher: in games like Phat and Pitch, a player who establishes trumps in leading to the first trick. 
;Soloist: a player who plays a Solo game, i.e. plays alone, as the declarer, against 2 or more other defenders.

In partnership games there may be a:
;Declaring team or declaring side: the declarer&#x27;s team or side
;Defending team or defending side: the team or side opposing the declarer and declarer&#x27;s partner

==Dealing==

=== Choice of dealer ===
In most card games, the role of dealer rotates, either clockwise or anticlockwise. The first dealer may be decided in one of several ways:

* The youngest player is invited to deal first
* The first dealer is chosen by lot i.e. players draw cards from a shuffled pack and the player with the highest card deals first (e.g. Schafkopf, Poker)
* The first dealer is chosen by lot i.e. players draw cards from a shuffled pack and the player with the lowest card deals first (e.g. Whist)

In casinos, the dealer is always the house banker for obvious reasons.

=== Distribution ===
The distribution of the cards is conducted by the dealer in accordance with the game rules. The dealer may deal the cards one at a time, or in groups or packets, as indicated by the rules. In some games, all cards are dealt, while in other versions, some cards are left undistributed and are placed – or stacked – in the centre of the table as a talon or widow. The cards distributed to a player are known as the player&#x27;s &quot;hand&quot;.

Normally the dealer shuffles the cards and then hands the pack to a player to cut it, who then lifts at least three cards from the pack. In games where the deal is clockwise, this player will be on the right of the dealer; however, if the deal is anti-clockwise, this player is on the left of the dealer. The dealer generally distributes cards to each player individually or in packets in the direction of play, beginning with eldest hand, also known as forehand. The cards are dealt face-down in front of the players, and the dealer places any left-over cards face-down in the centre of the table.

=== Other duties ===
The duties of a dealer differ from game to game. Their job usually involves distributing cards for games such as poker, contract bridge, blackjack, roulette or skat but may also involve other duties, for example:
* Contract bridge: the dealer is an opener who opens the auction and makes the first call, after which the auction progresses clockwise.
* In poker, the dealer controls the action during a hand and manages the pot.
* In blackjack, a player plays against a dealer, or &quot;house&quot;. If the hand of a player is closer to 21 than the dealer&#x27;s, without going over, the player wins.
* In a three-player skat game, the dealer takes on the role of rearhand. The player sitting on the left of the dealer is called the &quot;forehand&quot;, and the player sitting to the dealer&#x27;s right is called middlehand.

=== Casino dealers ===
Casino dealers must have a comprehensive and accurate knowledge of the games for which they deal. They should know the rules of the different card games, understand the odds of winning in various situations, and they must be able to communicate this information correctly to all levels of players. It is also the responsibility of the dealer to watch the play carefully and check to make sure that no one is cheating.

<doc id="318292" wikidata="Q515268" url="?curid=318292" title="Welsh Office">
<text>The Welsh Office () was a department in the Government of the United Kingdom with responsibilities for Wales. It was established in April 1965 to execute government policy in Wales, and was headed by the Secretary of State for Wales, a post which had been created in October 1964. It was disbanded on 1 July 1999 when most of its powers were transferred to the National Assembly for Wales, with some powers transferred to the Office of the Secretary of State for Wales (), a department popularly known as the Wales Office.

The Welsh Office took over the responsibilities related to housing, local government and town and country planning, etc. for Wales which had previously been the responsibilities of several other government departments. Its responsibilities included Monmouthshire, which for some purposes had earlier been considered by some to lie within England.

==Precursors==
Wales had been incorporated into the English legal system through the Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542. Legislation specific to Wales, such as the Sunday Closing (Wales) Act 1881 and the Welsh Intermediate Education Act 1889, began to be introduced in the late 19th century. Responsibility for Welsh education was given to the Welsh Department of the Board of Education in 1907, and the following year the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire was established. The Welsh Board of Health was formed in 1919, and the Welsh Department of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in 1922. A Boundary Commission for Wales was set up under the House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act 1944.

A Council for Wales and Monmouthshire was established in 1949 to monitor the effects of government policy. Government departments which had established Welsh offices or units by 1951 included the Ministry of Housing and Local Government, the Ministry of Transport, and the Forestry Commission, and 1951 the office of Minister for Welsh Affairs was created. This post was vested in the Home Secretary until 1957, when it was transferred to the Minister of Housing and Local Government, assisted by a Minister of State.

==Establishment and development==
The post of Minister for Welsh Affairs was replaced in 1964 by the office of Secretary of State for Wales, which was given responsibility for the new Welsh Office in 1965. The Welsh Office was created to execute government policy in Wales. It took over, from other departments, functions relating to economic planning, housing, local government, sewerage, environmental health, town and country planning, Welsh national parks, historic buildings, and cultural activities. The Welsh Language Act 1967 formally dissolved the legislation which provided that references made in Parliament to England automatically included Wales, under the Wales and Berwick Act 1746.

By 1969, the role of the Welsh Office had expanded to also cover responsibilities for highway construction and maintenance, tourism, water, forestry, common land, the Historic Buildings Council for Wales, and the Countryside Commission in Wales. That year it was also given responsibility for health and welfare services, and for the use of the Welsh language in the registration of births, marriages and deaths. During the 1970s, changes in central government led to the delegation of additional functions. Most responsibilities for primary and secondary education in Wales, were transferred in 1970; and most of the child care responsibilities of the Home Office were passed to the Welsh Office in 1971. Responsibilities relating to the promotion of industry in Wales were passed to the Welsh Office in 1974-75; and in 1978 it assumed control of further education functions, and the training and supply of teachers for primary and secondary education. In 1978, it also gained sole responsibility for agriculture and fishery matters in Wales.

By 1998, the Welsh Office comprised the following departments:
*Agriculture
*Transport Planning and Environment Group
*Welsh Office Health Department
*Economic Development Group
*Establishments Group
*Finance Group
*Education Department
*Health Professionals Group
*Industry and Training Group
*Legal Group
*Local Government Group.
Most of these had headquarters in Cardiff, with offices in London to help co-ordinate policies with Whitehall departments, and to provide secretariat and support services for Ministers and the Permanent Secretary.

==Establishment of the National Assembly==
Following the referendum on Welsh devolution in 1997, the Welsh Office was formally disbanded on 1 July 1999 and the majority of its powers were transferred to the National Assembly for Wales, now known as the Senedd. The cabinet position of Secretary of State for Wales was retained as the head of a newly formed Wales Office.

==Secretary of State for Wales==

<doc id="318294" wikidata="Q1415247" url="?curid=318294" title="Film preservation">
<text>Film preservation, or film restoration, describes a series of ongoing efforts among film historians, archivists, museums, cinematheques, and non-profit organizations to rescue decaying film stock and preserve the images they contain. In the widest sense, preservation assures that a movie will continue to exist in as close to its original form as possible.

For many years the term &quot;preservation&quot; was synonymous with &quot;duplication&quot; of film. The goal of a preservationist was to create a durable copy without any significant loss of quality. In more modern terms, film preservation includes the concepts of handling, duplication, storage, and access. The archivist seeks to protect the film and share its content with the public.

Film preservation is not to be confused with film revisionism, in which long-completed films are modified with the insertion of outtakes or new musical scores, the addition of sound effects, black-and-white film being colorized, older soundtracks converted to Dolby stereo, or minor edits and other cosmetic changes being made.

By the 1980s, it was becoming apparent that the collections of motion picture heritage were at risk of becoming lost. Not only was the preservation of nitrate film an ongoing problem, but it was then discovered that safety film, used as a replacement for the more volatile nitrate stock, was beginning to be affected by a unique form of decay known as &quot;vinegar syndrome&quot;, and color film manufactured, in particular, by Eastman Kodak, was found to be at risk of fading. At that time, the best-known solution was to duplicate the original film onto a more secure medium.

A common estimate is that 90 percent of all American silent films made before 1920 and 50 percent of American sound films made before 1950 are lost films.

Although institutional practices of film preservation date back to the 1930s, the field received an official status only in 1980, when UNESCO recognized &quot;moving images&quot; as an integral part of the world&#x27;s cultural heritage.

==The problem of film decay==
The great majority of films made in the silent era are now considered to be lost forever. Movies of the first half of the 20th century were filmed on an unstable, highly flammable cellulose nitrate film base, which required careful storage to slow its inevitable process of decomposition over time. Most films made on nitrate stock were not preserved; over the years, their negatives and prints crumbled into powder or dust. Many of them were recycled for their silver content, or destroyed in studio or vault fires. The largest cause, however, was intentional destruction. As film preservationist Robert A. Harris explains, &quot;Most of the early films did not survive because of wholesale junking by the studios. There was no thought of ever saving these films. They simply needed vault space and the materials were expensive to house.&quot; Silent films had little or no commercial value after the advent of sound films in the 1930s, and as such, they were not kept. As a result, preserving the now-rare silent films has been proposed as a high priority amongst film historians.

Because of the fragility of film stock, proper preservation of film usually involves storing the original negatives (if they have survived) and prints in climate-controlled facilities. The vast majority of films were not stored in this manner, which resulted in the widespread decay of film stocks.

The problem of film decay is not limited to films made on cellulose nitrate. Film industry researchers and specialists have found that color films (made using processes for Technicolor and its successors) are also decaying at an increasingly rapid rate. A number of well-known films only exist as copies of original film productions or exhibition elements because the originals have decomposed beyond use. Cellulose acetate film, which was the initial replacement for nitrate, has been found to suffer from &quot;vinegar syndrome&quot;. Polyester film base, which replaced acetate, also suffers from fading colors.

Storage at carefully controlled low temperatures and low humidity can inhibit both color fading and the onset of vinegar syndrome. However, once degradation begins to occur, the chemical reactions involved will promote further deterioration. &quot;There is no indication that we will ever find a way to arrest decomposition once it has started. All we can do is inhibit it,&quot; says the director of the AMIA (Association of Moving Image Archivists) board, Leo Enticknap.

===Film decay as an art form===
In 1991, filmmaker and former deputy director of the Eye Filmmuseum in Amsterdam, Peter Delpeut, made the film Lyrical Nitrate, with decaying films from the Desmet Collection.

In 2002, filmmaker Bill Morrison produced &quot;Decasia&quot;, a film solely based on fragments of old unrestored nitrate-based films in various states of decay and disrepair, providing a somewhat eerie aesthetic to the film. The film was created to accompany a symphony of the same name, composed by Michael Gordon and performed by his orchestra. The footage used was from old newsreel and archive film and was obtained by Morrison from several sources, such as the George Eastman House, the archives of the Museum of Modern Art, and the Fox Movietone News film archives at the University of South Carolina.

==Preservation through careful storage==

The &quot;preservation&quot; of film usually refers to physical storage of the film in a climate-controlled vault, and sometimes to the actual repair and copying of the film element. Preservation is different from &quot;restoration&quot;, as restoration is the act of returning the film to a version most faithful to its initial release to the public and often involves combining various fragments of film elements.

Film is best preserved by proper protection from external forces while in storage along with being under controlled temperatures. For most film materials, the Image Permanence Institute finds that storing film media in frozen temperatures, with relative humidity (RH) between 30% and 50%, greatly extends its useful life. These measures inhibit deterioration better than any other methods and are a cheaper solution than replicating deteriorating films.

==Preparing a film for preservation and restoration==
In most cases, when a film is chosen for preservation or restoration work, new prints are created from the original camera negative or from a composite restoration negative, which can be made from a combination of elements for general screening. It is therefore particularly important to keep camera negatives or digital masters under safe storage conditions.

The original camera negative is the remaining, edited, film negative that passed through the camera on the set. This original camera negative may, or may not, remain in original release form, depending upon number of subsequent re-releases after the initial release for theatrical exhibition.
Restorers sometimes create a composite negative (or composite dupe) by recombining duplicated sections of the best remaining material, sometimes on &quot;a shot-to-shot, frame-by-frame basis&quot; to approximate the original configuration of the original camera negative at some time in the film&#x27;s release cycle.

In traditional photochemical restorations, image polarity considerations must be observed when recombining surviving materials and the final, lowest generation restoration master may be either a duplicate negative or a fine grain master positive.
Preservation elements, such as fine-grain master positives and duplicate printing negatives, are generated from this restoration master element to make both duplication masters and access projection prints available for future generations.

==Choosing an archival medium==
===Film as an archival medium===

Film preservationists would prefer that the film images, whether restored through photochemical or digital processes, be eventually transferred to other film stock, because no digital media exists that has proven truly archival because of rapidly evolving and shifting data formats, while a well-developed and stored, modern film print can last upwards of 100 years.

While some in the archival community feel that conversion from film to a digital image results in a loss of quality that can make it more difficult to create a high-quality print based upon the digital image, digital imaging technology has become increasingly advanced to the point where 8K scanners can capture the full resolution of images filmed at as high as 65 mm.
70 mm IMAX film has a theoretical resolution of 18K, the highest possible resolution given the sensor.

Of course, having an intermediate digital stage, followed by forming a new film master by lasering the digital results onto new film stock does represent an extra generation. So would an intermediate film master that was restored frame-by-frame by hand. The choice of film vs. digital restoration will be driven by the amount, if any, of restoration required, the taste and skill set of the restorer, and the economics of film restoration vs. digital restoration.

===Digital as an archival medium===
, digital scanners can capture images as large as 65 mm in full resolution. That is the typical image size on a traditional (as opposed to the IMAX process) 70 mm film which used a portion of the film surface for its multitrack magnetic sound stripe. The cost of a 70 mm print of a two and a half hour film ran upwards of $170,000; while a hard disk capable of storing such a movie typically cost a few hundred dollars, with an archival optical disk even less. The problem of having to transfer the data as new generations of equipment come along will continue, however, until true archival standards are put in place.

==Digital film preservation==

In the context of film preservation, the term &quot;digital preservation&quot; highlights the use of digital technology for the transfer of films from 8 mm to 70 mm in size to digital carriers, as well as all practices for ensuring the longevity and access to digitized or digitally born film materials. On purely technical and practical terms, digital film preservation stands for a domain specific subset of digital curation practices.

The aesthetic and ethical implications of the use of digital technology for film preservation are major subjects of debate. For instance, the senior curator of George Eastman House Paolo Cherchi Usai has decried the shift from analogue to digital preservation of film as ethically unacceptable, arguing, on philosophical terms, that the medium of film is an essential ontological precondition for the existence of cinema. In 2009, the senior curator of EYE Film Institute Netherlands Giovanna Fossati has discussed the use of digital technologies for the restoration and preservation of film in a more optimistic way as a form of remediation of the cinematic medium, and has positively reflected on digital technologies&#x27; ability to broaden restoration possibilities, improve quality, and reduce costs. According to the cinema scholar Leo Enticknap, the views held by Usai and Fossati could be seen as representative of the two poles of the digital debate in film preservation. It should be kept in mind, however, that both Usai and Fossati&#x27;s arguments are highly complex and nuanced, and likewise, the debate about the utility of digital technologies in film preservation is complex and continually evolving.

==Advancements==
In 1935, New York&#x27;s Museum of Modern Art began one of the earliest institutional attempts to collect and preserve motion pictures, obtaining original negatives of the Biograph and Edison companies and the world&#x27;s largest collection of D. W. Griffith films. The following year, Henri Langlois founded the Cinémathèque Française in Paris, which would become the world&#x27;s largest international film collection.

For thousands of early silent films stored in the Library of Congress, mostly between 1894 and 1912, the only existing copies were printed on rolls of paper submitted as copyright registrations. 
For these, an optical printer was used to copy these images onto safety film stock, a project that began in 1947 and continues today. 
The Library hosts the National Film Preservation Board, whose National Film Registry annually selects 25 U.S. films &quot;showcasing the range and diversity of American film heritage&quot;.
The George Eastman House International Museum of Photography and Film was chartered in 1947 to collect, preserve and present the history of photography and film, and in 1996 opened the Louis B. Mayer Conservation Center, one of only four film conservation centers in the United States. The American Film Institute was founded in 1967 to train the next generation of filmmakers and preserve the American film heritage. Its collection now includes over 27,500 titles.

In 1978, Dawson City, Yukon Territory, Canada, a construction excavation inadvertently found a forgotten collection of more than 500 discarded films from the early 20th century that were buried in and preserved in the permafrost. This fortunate discovery was shared and moved to the United States&#x27; Library of Congress and Library and Archives Canada for transfer to safety stock and archiving. However, to move such highly flammable material such a distance ultimately required assistance from the Canadian Armed Forces to make the delivery to Ottawa. The story of this discovery as well as excerpts of these films can be seen in the 2016 documentary film, &quot;Dawson City: Frozen Time&quot;.

Another high-profile restoration by staff at the British Film Institute&#x27;s National Film and Television Archive is the Mitchell and Kenyon collection, which consists almost entirely of actuality films commissioned by traveling fairground operators for showing at local fairgrounds or other venues across the UK in the early part of the twentieth century. The collection was stored for many decades in two large barrels following the winding-up of the firm, and was discovered in Blackburn in the early 1990s. The restored films now offer a unique social record of early 20th-century British life.

Individual preservationists who have contributed to the cause include Robert A. Harris and James Katz (&quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;, &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, and several Alfred Hitchcock films), Michael Thau (&quot;Superman&quot;), and Kevin Brownlow (&quot;Intolerance&quot; and &quot;Napoleon&quot;). Other organizations, such as the UCLA Film and Television Archive, have also preserved and restored films; a major part of UCLA&#x27;s work includes such projects as &quot;Becky Sharp&quot; and select Paramount/Famous Studios and Warner Bros. cartoons whose credits were once altered due to rights taken over by different entities.

==Studio efforts==
In 1926 Will Hays asked for film studios to preserve their films by storing them at 40 degrees at low humidity in an Eastman Kodak process, so that &quot;schoolboys in the year 3,000 and 4,000 A.D. may learn about us&quot;.

Beginning in the 1970s, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, aware that the original negatives to many of its Golden Age films had been destroyed in a fire, began a preservation program to restore and preserve all of its films by using whatever negatives survived, or, in many cases, the next best available elements (whether it be a fine-grain master positive or mint archival print). From the onset, it was determined that if some films had to be preserved, then it would have to be &quot;all&quot; of them. In 1986, when Ted Turner acquired MGM&#x27;s library (which by then had included Warner Bros.&#x27; pre-1950, MGM&#x27;s pre-May 1986, and a majority of the RKO Radio Pictures catalogs), he vowed to continue the preservation work MGM had started. Warner Bros. Discovery, the current owner of Turner Entertainment, continues this work today.

The cause for film preservation came to the forefront in the 1980s and early 1990s when such famous and influential film directors as Steven Spielberg and Martin Scorsese contributed to the cause. Spielberg became interested in film preservation when he went to view the master of his film &quot;Jaws,&quot; only to find that it had badly decomposed and deteriorated—a mere fifteen years after it had been filmed. Scorsese drew attention to the film industry&#x27;s use of color-fading film stock through his use of black-and-white film stock in his 1980 film &quot;Raging Bull&quot;. His film, &quot;Hugo&quot; included a key scene in which many of film pioneer Georges Méliès&#x27; silent films are melted down and the raw material recycled as shoes; this was seen by many movie critics as &quot;a passionate brief for film preservation wrapped in a fanciful tale of childhood intrigue and adventure&quot;.

Scorsese&#x27;s concern about the need to save motion pictures of the past led him to create The Film Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to film preservation, in 1990. He was joined in this effort by fellow film makers who served on the foundation&#x27;s board of directors—Woody Allen, Robert Altman, Francis Ford Coppola, Clint Eastwood, Stanley Kubrick, George Lucas, Sydney Pollack, Robert Redford, and Steven Spielberg. In 2006, Paul Thomas Anderson, Wes Anderson, Curtis Hanson, Peter Jackson, Ang Lee, and Alexander Payne were added to the board of directors of The Film Foundation, which is aligned with the Directors Guild of America.

By working in partnership with the leading film archives and studios, The Film Foundation has saved nearly 600 films, often restoring them to pristine condition. In many cases, original footage that had been excised—or censored by the Production Code in the U.S.—from the original negative, has been reinstated. In addition to the preservation, restoration, and presentation of classic cinema, the foundation teaches young people about film language and history through &quot;The Story of Movies&quot;, an educational program claimed to be &quot;used by over 100,000 educators nationwide&quot;.

In the age of digital television, high-definition television and DVD, film preservation and restoration has taken on commercial as well as historical importance, since audiences demand the highest possible picture quality from digital formats. Meanwhile, the dominance of home video and ever-present need for television broadcasting content, especially on specialty channels, has meant that films have proven a source of long-term revenue to a degree that the original artists and studio management before the rise of these media never imagined. Thus media companies have a strong financial incentive to carefully archive and preserve their complete library of films.

==Obstacles in restoration==
The process of restoration is expensive due to physical damage incurred on older films, and restoration efforts often require multiple copies or fragments which contain better-quality versions of certain scenes or soundtracks. As of 2020, Martin Scorsese&#x27;s non-profit The Film Foundation, dedicated to film preservation, estimates the average cost of photochemical restoration of a color feature with sound to be $80,000 to $450,000, with digital 2K or 4K restoration being &quot;several hundred thousand dollars&quot;.

==Education==

The practice of film preservation is more craft than science. Until the early 1990s there were no dedicated academic programs in film preservation. Practitioners had often entered the field through related education (e.g. library or archival science), related technical experience (e.g. film lab work), or driven by sheer passion for working with film.

In the last two decades universities globally began offering graduate degrees in film preservation and film archiving, which are often taught conjointly (the latter focusing more on skills related to the description, cataloguing, indexing and broadly speaking management of film and media collections).

The recent years rapid incursion of digital technologies in the field has somewhat redefined the vocational scope of film preservation. In response, the majority of graduate programs in film preservation have begun offering courses on digital film preservation and digital film and media collection management.
Some established graduate programs in the field are:
*MA in Film Archiving, University of East Anglia no longer available
*Film Preservation Certificate, Selznick School of Film Preservation
*MA in Film and Media Preservation, Selznick School of Film Preservation offered jointly with the University of Rochester
*MA in Moving Image Archiving and Preservation, New York University, Tisch School of the Arts
*MA in Heritage Studies: Preservation and Presentation of the Moving Image, University of Amsterdam
*Graduate Certificate in Audiovisual Archiving, Charles Sturt University, Australia
*MA in Moving Image Archive Studies, UCLA
*MA in Film Preservation, Ryerson University, Canada offered since 2013 as specialization in the graduate program of Film + Photography Preservation and Collection Management

<text>The Epstein Theatre, formerly Neptune Theatre, is a theatre in Liverpool, England. The theatre, a Grade II listed building, closed on 30 June 2023 following a decision by Liverpool City Council to end its financial support to the venue.

==History==
The theatre originally opened in 1913 as Crane&#x27;s Music Hall. The Crane Brothers&#x27; music store had been trading for several years when they opened the music hall above their store on Hanover Street in central Liverpool. Over the first few years, many amateur drama groups staged productions there, thus leading to its renaming as the Crane Theatre in 1938.

Little changed over the next twenty years, until Summer of 1967 when the Liverpool Corporation took over the ownership of the building spending £7,000 on a refurbishment including a front of house bar (now known as Brian&#x27;s Bar), the stage was rebuilt and the Hanover House ‘Good&#x27;s Lift’ was installed (located on school lane, granting access to stalls of the theatre only). Re-opening as &quot;The Neptune&quot; in 1968, the Liverpool Corporation believed that the theatre &quot;should be ran by local people for local people&quot;. The name was selected due to Liverpool&#x27;s links with the maritime through the Docks, an allusion to Neptune, the Roman god of the seas. One of the main reasons for the acquisition of the theatre from the Cranes was due to Brian Epstein opening up North End Music Store (NEMS) in Whitechapel, introducing competition they had previously not had to consider. 

However, once again in 1993, the corporation, by now named Liverpool Council presented the theatre with the risk of closure. This caused a huge outcry around the city and many performers, including Dame Judi Dench, were part of the campaign to keep the theatre open. In order to attract audiences, a professional pantomime &quot;Snow White&quot; was staged in the theatre. This proved to be a huge success, with a professional panto then being held every year in the theatre.

Upon reopening in 2011 after the £1.2m refurbishment (as a result in closing in 2005 for health and safety reasons) the theatre was dedicated to the memory of Beatles manager Brian Epstein, for his contributions to the city&#x27;s cultural and musical scene. Epstein was known to have also performed on the stage in the theatre as a child. Local artist Tony Brown offered a portrait of Epstein on permanent loan to the theatre and this now hangs in the bar.

Entertaining Liverpool since 1911, the Epstein has been a home to many, either that be performers (amateur or not), customers or avid theatre goers, therefore when it was announced to the public on 8 June 2023 that the theatre was closing once again due to insufficient funding for the lease after the council chose to retract the agreement with the theatre to subsidise the lease with £100,000 per year (the agreement existing since 1967), the news was greeted with the sorrows of all those who have fond memories of the establishment. The Liverpool City Council released a statement for their decision saying that, &quot;it does not provide the best value for the tax payers money.&quot; 

After 112 years of being a staple of Liverpool&#x27;s Arts and Culture, and being closed down for the fourth time, the Epstein is to lay dormant for the foreseeable future until it is revived once again, truly earning its title as &quot;The Theatre that Refuses to Die.&quot; 

The theatre was chosen for a special BBC filming of Steve Coogan&#x27;s &quot;Paul &amp; Pauline Calf&#x27;s Cheese and Ham Sandwich&quot; programme.
It was the home of long-established Crosby Gilbert And Sullivan Society until 2016.
Its striking interior has often been used as a location for film and TV productions.

==Refurbishment==

After acquiring the theatre from the Crane&#x27;s in 1967, the Liverpool Corporation decided to lease the building formally known as Crane&#x27;s (now known as Hanover House) to Mr. David Ramsey since then the lease of the building has been distributed between the Ramsey&#x27;s, To which the Council then subleased the building back off the Ramsey&#x27;s to lease to the Epstein. As part of this lease the council in 1967 agreed to help subsidise the lease with £100,000 per year to the Epstein, helping with maintenance, utilities, and rent. This helped with the £7,000 refurbishment in 1967 (with it opening in 1968) and again in 2011 with £1.2 million refurbishment after the theatre laid dormant for 6 years. As of 2023, the council released a statement regarding their withdrawal with their deal saying that the theatre no longer, &quot;provided the best value for the tax payer&#x27;s money&quot;. Even after negotiations from Epstein Entertainment LTD for the Council to subsidise the lease by £50,000 per year, half of the price of their previous agreement the council denied the proposal leaving a lack of financial backing for the theatre to remain open. Leading to 8 June 2023 where it was released in a press statement given by Epstein Entertainment LTD that despite the business being solvent, that the theatre was to close on 30 June 2023, with the last show on 28 June 2023. 

In 2005 the theatre closed for refurbishment, with an estimated reopening date of September 2007. In 2007 Liverpool City Council, who lease the Theatre from Mr. David Ramsey owner of the building, commissioned an independent valuation of the Theatre&#x27;s rental value, after months of negotiations with no progression on the terms of the new lease. The refurbished theatre eventually reopened in May 2011. 
Since its refurbishment it has hosted pantomimes such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs starring Amanda Harrington from Desperate Scousewives and other charity events.

<text>Jean Daninos (2 December 1906 – 13 October 2001) was a Greek-French constructor of luxury cars Facel Vega, born in Paris.

The brother of the Pierre Daninos, Jean Daninos had founded the company FACEL (Forges et Ateliers des Constructions d&#x27;Eure-et-Loir, &quot;forge and construction workshop for the department of Eure-et-Loir&quot;) in 1939 with hopes of one day designing and manufacturing his own automobile. An engineer, he had previously collaborated with Citroën on the Traction Avant and had worked in the aviation field.

The FACEL company produced the bodies of custom cars like the Panhard Dyna cabriolet and the Ford Comète.He had also a long time business partnership with Henri Théodore Pigozzi CEO of Simca. All the stylish Aronde sports derivatives (coupes and convertibles called PLein Ciel and Océane, targeted for well to do women customers ) were manufactured by Facel.
However Pigozzi and Simca chose cheaper and more trendy Carrozeria Bertone for the later the Simca 1000 derivatives (Simca 1200S) and ended the Simca partnership. The first Facel Vega model, designed by Daninos himself, debuted in 1954, equipped with a Chrysler engine. Daninos counted among his clients celebrities including (Tony Curtis, Ava Gardner) and racing drivers (Stirling Moss, Maurice Trintignant). Several sports car models followed until the company&#x27;s demise in the mid-1960s. During ten years of production, FACEL had manufactured 3,000 automobiles.

Daninos died in Cannes at age 94 from cancer. He was buried with his relatives in Jouy-en-Josas.

<doc id="318313" wikidata="Q1141061" url="?curid=318313" title="Electoral system of Australia">
<text>The electoral system of Australia comprises the laws and processes used for the election of members of the Australian Parliament and is governed primarily by the &quot;Commonwealth Electoral Act 1969&quot;. The system presently has a number of distinctive features including compulsory enrolment; compulsory voting; majority-preferential instant-runoff voting in single-member seats to elect the lower house, the House of Representatives; and the use of the single transferable vote proportional representation system to elect the upper house, the Senate.

The timing of elections is governed by the Constitution and political conventions. Generally, elections are held approximately every three years and are conducted by the independent Australian Electoral Commission (AEC).

== Conduct of elections ==
Federal elections, by-elections and referendums are conducted by the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC).

== Voter registration ==
In Australia, voter registration is called enrolment, which is a prerequisite for voting at federal elections, by-elections and referendums. Enrolment is compulsory for Australian citizens over 18 years of age who have lived at their current address for at least one month. Residents in Australia who had been enrolled as British subjects on 25 January 1984, though not Australian citizens, continue to be enrolled. They cannot opt out of enrolment, and must keep their details updated, and vote. (These comprise about 9% of enrolments.)

===Electoral rolls===

The AEC maintains a permanent Commonwealth electoral roll. State and local elections are today based upon the Commonwealth electoral roll, maintained under joint roll arrangements, though each state and territory regulates its own part of the electoral roll. The same enrolment application or update form can be used for Commonwealth, state and local rolls.

=== Enrolment of electors ===
Special rules apply to citizens going or living outside the country, to military personnel and to prisoners, all of which do not reside at their normal residential address for electoral purposes. Homeless people or those otherwise with no fixed address have a particular problem with registration, not having a current address to give. Enrolment is optional for 16- or 17-year-olds, but they cannot vote until they turn 18. A person can register or update their details online or by mailing in a paper form.

If a change of address causes an individual to move to another electorate (electoral division), they are legally obliged to notify the AEC within 8 weeks. The AEC monitors house and apartment sales and sends a reminder (and the forms) to new residents if they have moved to another electorate, making compliance with the law easier. The AEC conducts periodic door-to-door and postal campaigns to try to ensure that all eligible persons are registered in the correct electorate. An individual has 8 weeks after turning 18 to register and the 8-week period also applies to update of details. Failure to enrol or update details can incur a fine.

===Closing of electoral rolls before an election===
Federal and state electoral rolls are closed for new enrolments or update of details before each election. For federal elections, they are closed 7 days after the issue of writs for election. The closing dates vary for state and territory elections. Historically, most new applications and updates are received after an election is called, before the closing of rolls.

===Prisoners===

Persons who are serving prison terms may be disqualified to vote, based on the length of their sentence. Federally, prisoners serving a full time prison sentence of less than three years must enrol and vote in federal elections. There are varying laws for prisoners&#x27; eligibility to vote in state or territory elections:
* In the Australian Capital Territory and South Australia, all prisoners are eligible. 
* In Victoria, prisoners must be serving a sentence of less than five years to be eligible.
* In Queensland, Tasmania and the Northern Territory, prisoners must be serving a sentence of less than three years to be eligible.
* In New South Wales and Western Australia, prisoners must be serving a sentence of less than one year to be eligible.

Despite those serving short sentences being allowed and required to vote, voter turnout amongst prisoners is low. In 2010, a Victorian government review found only 26% of prisoners serving less than three year sentences were enrolled, despite them being eligible and legally obliged to do so. At the 2013 federal election, only 2 prisoners at the Silverwater Correctional Centre voted, according to the general manager of the prison.

==Public funding of political parties==
To receive federal public funding, a political party must be registered under the Electoral Act, which requires that they have at least 1500 members. All nominations for party-endorsed candidates must be signed by the Registered Officer of a registered party. The name of registered parties appear on ballot papers. Separate registers of parties are maintained for each state and territory, with their own membership requirements.

To receive public funding, a candidate (party-endorsed or independent) must receive at least 4% of the first preference vote in the division or the state or territory they contested.

==Nomination==
Candidates for either house must formally nominate with the Electoral Commission. The nomination for a party-endorsed candidate must be signed by the Registered Officer of a party registered under the Electoral Act. Fifty signatures of eligible voters are required for an independent candidate.

A deposit of $2,000 is required for a candidate for the House of Representatives or the Senate. (Before March 2019, the deposit for the House of Representatives was $1,000.) This deposit is refunded if the candidate is elected or gains at least 4% of the first preference vote.

Between 10 and 27 days must be allowed after the issue of writs before the close of nominations.

The name and political affiliation of candidates who are disendorsed by or resign from a party after the close of nominations, continue to appear on the ballot paper, and they stand as independents. However, complications arise for senate candidates in that position in respect of voting &quot;above the line&quot; as party lists would also have been registered.

==Election day==
The date and type of federal election is determined by the Prime Minister – after a consideration of constitutional requirements, legal requirements, as well as political considerations – who advises the Governor-General to set the process in motion by dissolving either or both houses and issuing writs for election for the House of Representatives and territorial senators. The Constitution of Australia does not require simultaneous elections for the Senate and the House of Representatives, but it has long been preferred that elections for the two houses take place simultaneously. The most recent House-only election took place in 1972, and the most recent Senate-only election took place in 1970. The last independently dated Senate election writ occurred during the Gair Affair in 1974. Federal elections must be held on a Saturday which has been the case since the 1913 federal election.

Subject to those considerations, an election for the House of Representatives can be called at any time before the expiration of the three-year term of the House of Representatives The term of the House of Representatives starts on the first sitting day of the House following its election and runs for a maximum of three years, but the House can be dissolved earlier. The date of the first sitting can be extended provided that &quot;There shall be a session of the Parliament once at least in every year, so that twelve months shall not intervene between the last sitting of the Parliament in one session and its first sitting in the next session, but subject to the requirement that the House shall meet not more than 30 days after the date appointed for the return of the writs.&quot; The actual date of the election is later. Between 10 and 27 days must be allowed for nominations, and the actual election would be set between 21 and 31 days after the close of nominations. Accordingly, between 31 and 58 must be allowed after the issue of the writs to the election.

The term of senators ends on 30 June either three (for half the senators if it follows a double-dissolution) or six years after their election. Elections of senators at a half-Senate election must take place in the year before the terms expire, except if parliament is dissolved earlier. The terms of senators from the territories align with House elections. The latest date that a half-Senate election can be held must allow time for the votes to be counted and the writs to be returned before the newly elected senators take office on 1 July. This took over a month in 2016, so practically, the date in which a half-Senate election is to take place must be between 1 July of the year before Senate terms expire until mid-May of the expiry year.

A double dissolution cannot take place within six months before the date of the expiry of the House of Representatives.

===Constitutional and legal provisions===
The Constitutional and legal provisions which impact on the choice of election dates include:

*Section 12 of the Constitution says: &quot;The Governor of any State may cause writs to be issued for the election of Senators for that State&quot;
*Section 13 of the Constitution provides that the election of senators shall be held in the period of twelve months before the places become vacant.
*Section 28 of the Constitution says: &quot;Every House of Representatives shall continue for three years from the first sitting of the House, and no longer, but may be sooner dissolved by the Governor-General.&quot; Since the 47th Parliament of Australia opened on 26 July 2022, it will expire on 25 July 2025.
*Section 32 of the Constitution says: &quot;The writs shall be issued within ten days from the expiry of a House of Representatives or from the proclamation of a dissolution thereof.&quot; Ten days after 25 July 2025 is 4 August 2025.
*Section 156 (1) of the CEA says: &quot;The date fixed for the nomination of the candidates shall not be less than 10 days nor more than 27 days after the date of the writ&quot;. Twenty-seven days after 4 August 2025 is 31 August 2025.
*Section 157 of the CEA says: &quot;The date fixed for the polling shall not be less than 23 days nor more than 31 days after the date of nomination&quot;. Thirty-one days after 31 August 2025 is 1 October 2025, a Wednesday.
*Section 158 of the CEA says: &quot;The day fixed for the polling shall be a Saturday&quot;. The Saturday before 1 October 2025 is 27 September 2025. This is therefore the latest possible date for the lower house election.

==Voting system==

=== Compulsory voting ===
Voting is compulsory at federal elections, by-elections and referendums for those on the electoral roll, as well as for State and Territory elections. Australia enforces compulsory voting. People who do not vote are asked to explain their failure to do so. If no satisfactory reason is provided (for example, illness or religious prohibition), a fine of up to $170 is imposed, and failure to pay the fine may result in a court hearing and additional costs. About 5% of enrolled voters fail to vote at most elections. In South Australia, Tasmania and Western Australia voting at local elections is not compulsory. In the other states, local council elections are also compulsory.

Compulsory voting was introduced for the Queensland state election in 1915, for federal elections since the 1925 federal election, and Victoria introduced it for the Legislative Assembly at the 1927 state election and for Legislative Council elections in 1935. New South Wales and Tasmania introduced compulsory voting in 1928, Western Australia in 1936 and South Australia in 1942.

Though the immediate justification for compulsory voting at the federal level was the low voter turnout (59.38%) at the 1922 federal election, down from 71.59% at the 1919 federal election, its introduction was a condition of the Country Party agreeing to form an alliance with the then minority Nationalist Party. Compulsory voting was not on the platform of either the Stanley Bruce-led Nationalist/Country party coalition government or the Matthew Charlton-led Labor opposition. The change took the form of a private member&#x27;s bill initiated by Herbert Payne, a backbench Tasmanian Nationalists senator, who on 16 July 1924 introduced the bill in the Senate. Payne&#x27;s bill was passed with little debate (the House of Representatives agreeing to it in less than an hour), and in neither house was a division required, hence no votes were recorded against the bill. It received royal assent on 31 July 1924 as the &quot;Commonwealth Electoral Act 1924&quot;. The 1925 federal election was the first to be conducted under compulsory voting, which saw the turnout rise to 91.4%. The turnout increased to about 95% within a couple of elections and has stayed at about that level since. Compulsory voting at referendums was considered when a referendum was proposed in 1915, but, as the referendum was never held, the idea was put on hold.

It is an offence to &quot;mislead an elector in relation to the casting of his vote&quot;. An &quot;informal vote&quot; is a ballot paper that does not indicate a clear voting preference, is left blank, or carries markings that might identify the voter. The number of informal votes is counted but, in the determination of voter preferences, they are not included in the total number of (valid) votes cast. Around 95% of registered voters attend polling, and around 5% of House of Representatives votes are informal.

When compulsory voting was introduced in Victoria in 1926 for the Legislative Assembly, the turnout increased from 59.24% at the 1924 state election to 91.76% at the 1927 state election, but the informal vote increased from 1.01% in 1924 to 1.94% in 1927. But when it was introduced for the 1937 Legislative Council election, which was not held on the same day as for the Legislative Assembly, the turnout increased from 10% to only 46%.

The requirement is for the person to enrol, attend a polling station and have their name marked off the electoral roll as attending, receive a ballot paper and take it to an individual voting booth, mark it, fold the ballot paper and place it in the ballot box. There is no explicit requirement for a choice to be made, the ballot paper is only to be &#x27;marked&#x27;. According to the act, how a person marks the paper is completely up to the individual. Despite the risk of sanctions, the voter turnout at federal elections is dropping, with 1.4 million eligible voters, or nearly 10% of the total, failing to vote at the 2016 federal election, the lowest turnout since compulsory voting began. At the 2010 Tasmanian state election, with a turnout of 335,353 voters, about 6,000 people were fined $26 for not voting, and about 2,000 paid the fine. A postal vote is available for those for whom it is difficult to attend a polling station. Early, or pre-poll, voting at an early voting centre is also available for those who might find it difficult to get to a polling station on election day.

===Debate over compulsory voting===
Following the 2004 federal election, at which the Liberal–National coalition government won a majority in both houses, a senior minister, Senator Nick Minchin, said that he favoured the abolition of compulsory voting. Some prominent Liberals, such as Petro Georgiou, former chair of the Parliament&#x27;s Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, have spoken in favour of compulsory voting.

Peter Singer, in &quot;Democracy and Disobedience&quot;, argues that compulsory voting could negate the obligation of a voter to support the outcome of the election, since voluntary participation in elections is deemed to be one of the sources of the obligation to obey the law in a democracy. In 1996 Albert Langer was jailed for three weeks on contempt charges in relation to a constitutional challenge on a legal way not to vote for either of the major parties. Chong, Davidson and Fry, writing in the journal of the right wing think tank the CIS, argue that Australian compulsory voting is disreputable, paternalistic, disadvantages smaller political parties, and allows major parties to target marginal seats and make some savings in pork-barrelling because of this targeting. Chong et al. also argue that denial is a significant aspect of the debate about compulsory voting.

A counter argument to opponents of compulsory voting is that in these systems the individual still has the practical ability to abstain at the polls by voting informally if they so choose, due to the secrecy of the ballot. A spoilt vote does not count towards any political party and effectively is the same as choosing not to vote under a non-compulsory voting system. However, Singer argues that even the appearance of voluntary participation is sufficient to create an obligation to obey the law.

In the 2010 Australian election, Mark Latham urged Australians to vote informally by handing in blank ballot papers for the 2010 election. He also stated that he feels it is unfair for the government to force citizens to vote if they have no opinion or threaten them into voting with a fine. An Australian Electoral Commission spokesman stated that the Commonwealth Electoral Act did not contain an explicit provision prohibiting the casting of a blank vote. How the Australian Electoral Commission arrived at this opinion is unknown; it runs contrary to the opinions of Chief Justice Sir Garfield Barwick, who wrote that voters must actually mark the ballot paper and deposit that ballot into a ballot box, and Justice Blackburn who was of the opinion that casting an invalid vote was a violation of the Act.

Tim Evans, a Director of Elections Systems and Policy of the AEC, wrote in 2006 that &quot;It is not the case, as some people have claimed, that it is only compulsory to attend the polling place and have your name marked off and this has been upheld by a number of legal decisions.&quot; Yet, practically, it remains the fact that having received a ballot paper, the elector can simply fold it up and put it into the ballot box without formally marking it, if the elector objects, in principle, to casting a vote. However, the consistently low number of informal votes each election indicates that having attended, had his or her name marked off, very few electors then choose not to vote formally.

Proponents of compulsory voting have promoted benefits such as the difficulty for coercion to be used to prevent disadvantaged people (the old, illiterate or disabled) to vote, and for obstacles to be put in the way of classes of individuals (ethnic/coloured; either registration requirements or placement of voting booths) as often happens under other voting systems. They also suggest jury duty and compulsory military service as vastly more onerous citizen&#x27;s compulsions than attending a local voting booth once every few years.

=== Turnout and informal votes ===

===Ranked (or preferential) voting===
Australia uses various forms of ranked voting for almost all elections. Under this system, voters number the candidates on the ballot paper in the order of their preference. The preferential system was introduced for federal elections in 1918, in response to the rise of the Country Party, a party representing small farmers. The Country Party was seen to have split the anti-Labor vote in conservative country areas, allowing Labor candidates to win on a minority vote. The conservative federal government of Billy Hughes introduced preferential voting as a means of allowing competition between the two conservative parties without putting seats at risk. It was first used in the form of instant-runoff voting at the Corangamite by-election on 14 December 1918. The system was first used for election for the Queensland Parliament in 1892. In the form of single transferable voting, ranked voting was introduced in the Tasmanian House of Assembly in 1906 as a result of the work of Andrew Inglis Clark and Catherine Helen Spence, building on the original concept invented in 1859 by Briton Thomas Hare, and following the use of STV in Tasmanian state elections in the 1890s.

Preferential voting has gradually extended to both upper and lower houses, in the federal, state and territory legislatures, and is also used in municipal elections, and most other kinds of elections as well, such as internal political party elections, trade union elections, church elections, elections to company boards and elections in voluntary bodies such as football clubs. Negotiations for disposition of preference recommendations to voters are taken very seriously by candidates because transferred preferences carry the same weight as primary votes. (A vote is only transferred if use of the earlier preference means the ballot cannot be used effectively.)

Political parties usually produce how-to-vote cards to assist and guide voters in the ranking of candidates. When parties declare how they are preferencing other parties, typically in the lead-up to an election, they are declaring how they will instruct their supporters via these cards: there is no mechanism in the electoral system for inter-party preferences.

===Secret balloting===
Secret balloting was implemented by Tasmania, Victoria and South Australia in 1856, followed by other Australian colonies: New South Wales (1858), Queensland (1859), and Western Australia (1877). Colonial (soon to become States) electoral laws, including the secret ballot, applied for the first election of the Australian Parliament in 1901, and the system has continued to be a feature of all elections in Australia and also applies to referendums.

The Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 does not explicitly set out the secret ballot but a reading of sections 206, 207, 325 and 327 of the Act would imply its assumption. Sections 323 and 226(4) do however, apply the principle of a secret ballot to polling staff and would also support the assumption.

Proxy voting is not permitted at federal and state elections.

===Alternative voting methods===
Most voting takes place with registered voters attending a polling station on election day, where they are given a ballot paper which they mark in a prescribed manner and then place it into a ballot box. However, alternative voting methods are available. For example, a person may vote by an absentee ballot whereby a voter attends a voting place which is not in the electoral district in which they are registered to vote. Instead of marking the ballot paper and putting it in the ballot box, the voter&#x27;s ballot paper is placed in an envelope and then it is sent by the voting official to the voter&#x27;s home district to be counted there. Other alternatives are postal voting and early voting, known as &quot;pre-poll voting&quot;, which are also available to voters who would not be in their registered electoral districts on an election day.

A form of postal voting was introduced in Western Australia in 1877, followed by an improved method in South Australia in 1890. On the other hand, concerns about postal voting have been raised as to whether it complies with the requirements of a secret ballot, in that people cast their vote outside the security of a polling station, and whether voters can cast their vote privately free from another person&#x27;s coercion.

In voting for the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly, voters may choose between voting electronically or on paper. Otherwise, Australian elections are carried out using paper ballots. If more than one election takes place, for example for the House of Representatives and the Senate, then each election is on a separate ballot paper, which are of different colours and which are deposited into separate ballot boxes.

===Electoral reform===
There are organisations, such as the Proportional Representation Society of Australia (PRSA), and political parties, such as the Australian Greens, that support changing the electoral system to the House of Representatives to that of a proportional representation system.

==Allocation process==
===Allocation process for House of Representatives (instant-runoff/alternative vote)===

The main elements of the operation of preferential voting for single-member House of Representatives divisions are as follows:

* Voters are required to place the number &quot;1&quot; against their first choice of candidate, known as the &quot;first preference&quot; or &quot;primary vote&quot;.
* Voters are then required to place the numbers &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, etc., against all of the other candidates listed on the ballot paper, in order of preference. (&quot;Every&quot; candidate must be numbered, otherwise the vote becomes &quot;informal&quot; (spoiled) and does not count.)
* Prior to counting, each ballot paper is examined to ensure that it is validly filled in (and not invalidated on other grounds).
* The number &quot;1&quot; or first preference votes are counted first. If no candidate secures an absolute majority (more than half) of first preference votes, then the candidate with the fewest votes is excluded from the count.
* The votes for the eliminated candidate (i.e., from the ballots that placed the eliminated candidate first) are re-allocated to the remaining candidates according to the number &quot;2&quot; or &quot;second preference&quot; votes.
* If no candidate has yet secured an absolute majority of the vote, then the next candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated. This preference allocation is repeated until there is a candidate with an absolute majority. Where a second (or subsequent) preference is expressed for a candidate who has already been eliminated, the voter&#x27;s third or subsequent preferences are used.

Following the full allocation of preferences, it is possible to derive a two-party-preferred figure, where the votes have been allocated between the two main candidates in the election. In Australia, this is usually between the candidates from the Coalition parties and the Australian Labor Party.

=== Alternative allocation methods for Senate (single transferable vote)===

For the Australian Senate, each State constitutes one multi-member electorate. Currently, 12 senators are elected from each State, one half every three years, except in the case of double dissolution when elections for all 12 senators in each State take place. The number of senators to be elected determines the &#x27;quota&#x27; that guarantees election under quota-preferential voting (Single transferable voting). For a half-Senate election of 6 places to be filled, the quota in each State is 14.28% (calculated using the formula 1/(6+1)), while after a double dissolution the quota is 7.69% (calculated using the formula 1/(12+1)). The AEC also conducts a special recount after a double dissolution using a half-Senate quota for the purpose of allocating long and short terms so that rotation of senators can be re-established, however the Senate has never used the results to allocate terms, despite two bipartisan senate resolutions to use it.

The federal Senate electoral system from 1984 to 2013, and those currently used for some state legislatures, provide for simultaneous registration of party-listed candidates and party-determined orders of voting preference, known as &#x27;group voting tickets&#x27; or &#x27;above the line voting&#x27; which involves placing the number &#x27;1&#x27; in a single box and the vote is then allocated in accordance with the party&#x27;s registered voting preferences. The AEC automatically allocates preferences, or votes, in the predetermined order outlined in the group voting ticket. Each party or group can register up to three group voting tickets. This highly complex system has potential for unexpected outcomes, including the possible election of a candidate who may have initially received an insignificant primary vote tally (see, for example, the Minor Party Alliance at the 2013 federal election). An estimated 95% of all votes are cast &#x27;above the line&#x27;.

The alternative for Senate elections from 1984 to 2013 was to use &#x27;below the line voting&#x27; by numbering a large number of individual candidate&#x27;s boxes in the order of the voter&#x27;s preference. To be valid, the voter placed sequential numbers against every candidate on the ballot paper, and the risk of error and invalidation of the vote was significant.

In 2016, the Senate voting system was changed again to abolish group voting tickets and introduce optional preferential voting. An &quot;above the line&quot; vote for a party now allocates preferences to the candidates of that party only, in the order in which they are listed. The AEC directs voters to number 6 or more boxes above the line. If, instead, voters choose to vote for individual candidates in their own order of preference &quot;below the line&quot;, at least 12 boxes must be numbered. (See also Australian Senate#Electoral system).

==Gerrymandering and malapportionment==
Malapportionment occurs when the numbers of voters in electorates are not equal. Malapportionment can occur through demographic change or through the deliberate weighting of different zones, such as rural v. urban areas. Malapportionment differs from a gerrymander, which occurs when electoral boundaries are drawn to favour one political party or group over others.

There is no scope for malapportionment of Senate divisions, with each State constituting one multi-member electorate, though no account is taken of differences in the relative populations of states.

For the House of Representatives, members are elected from single member electorates known as divisions. Every month on the same day, the AEC compares the enrolment of each division versus the average divisional enrolment of the respective state/territory. If the number of electors in more than one third of the divisions in a State or one of the divisions in a Territory deviates from the respective State/Territory&#x27;s average divisional enrolment by more than 10% for a period of more than two months, this is considered malapportionment and triggers a redistribution of divisions for that State or Territory.

Australia has seen very little gerrymandering of electoral boundaries, relevant only for the House of Representatives and State Legislative Assemblies, which have nearly always been drawn up by public servants or independent boundary commissioners. But Australia has seen systematic malapportionment of electorates. All colonial legislatures before Federation, and the federal parliament after it, allocated more representation to rural districts than their populations merited. This was justified on several grounds, such as that country people had to contend with greater distances and hardships, that country people (and specifically farmers) produced most of the nation&#x27;s real wealth, and that greater country representation was necessary to balance the radical tendencies of the urban population.

However, in the later 20th century, these arguments were successfully challenged, and by the early 21st century malapportionment was abolished in all states. In all states, electoral districts must have roughly the same number of voters, with variations allowed for rural areas due to their sparse population. Proponents of this concept call this &quot;one vote, one value&quot;.

For the 2019 Federal election, most electorates contained between 105,000 and 125,000 voters. However, in Tasmania 5 electorates contained between 73,000 and 80,000 voters, because the Constitution (s.24) grants Tasmania a minimum of 5 members in the House of Representatives.

===Examples===
The most conspicuous examples of malapportionment were those of South Australia, Queensland and Western Australia.

====South Australia====
In South Australia, the 1856 Constitution stipulated that there must be two rural constituencies for every urban constituency.

By the early 1960s, the urban-rural voter ratio was almost exactly reversed: more than two-thirds of the state&#x27;s population lived in Adelaide and its suburbs, but the rural areas elected two-thirds of the legislature. This was despite the fact that by this time, rural seats had on average one-quarter as many voters as urban seats: in one of the more extreme cases, a vote in the rural seat of Frome was worth 10 times a vote in an Adelaide seat.

The setup allowed the Liberal and Country League to stay in office from 1932 to 1965, the last 27 of these under Thomas Playford. However, from 1947, the LCL lost by increasing margins in terms of actual votes, and in 1953, even retained power despite losing the two-party vote and Labor winning a majority of the primary vote. Largely because Playford was the main beneficiary, the setup was called &quot;the Playmander&quot;, although it was not strictly speaking a gerrymander.

The gross inequities of this system came into sharp focus during three consecutive state elections in the 1960s:

*In 1962, Labor won 54.3% of the two party vote, a margin normally large enough for a comprehensive victory, but came up one seat short of a majority as it only managed a two-seat swing, and Playford was able to continue in power with the support of two independents.
* While the Playmander was overcome when Labor defeated the LCL in 1965, the rural weighting was strong enough that Labor won only a one-seat majority, despite winning 54.3% of the two-party vote.
* In 1968, the LCL regained power despite Labor winning the popular vote with 53.2% to the LCL&#x27;s 46.8%, as Labor suffered a two-seat swing, leaving both parties with 19 seats each before conservative independent Tom Stott threw his support to the LCL for a majority.

Playford&#x27;s successor as LCL leader, Steele Hall, was highly embarrassed at the farcical manner in which he became Premier, and immediately set about enacting a fairer system: a few months after taking office, Hall enacted a new electoral map with 47 seats: 28 seats in Adelaide and 19 in the country.

Previously, there had been 39 seats (13 in Adelaide and 26 in country areas), but, for some time, the LCL&#x27;s base in Adelaide had been limited to the wealthy eastern crescent and the area around Holdfast Bay.

While it came up slightly short of &quot;one vote, one value&quot;, as Labor had demanded, the new system allowed Adelaide to elect a majority of the legislature, which all but assured a Labor victory at the next election; despite this, Hall knew he would be effectively handing the premiership to his Labor counterpart, Don Dunstan.

In the first election under this system, in 1970, Dunstan won handily, picking up all eight new seats.

After Premier Don Dunstan introduced the Age of Majority (Reduction) Bill in October 1970, the voting age in South Australia was lowered to 18 years old in 1973.

====Queensland====
In Queensland, the malapportionment initially benefitted the Labor Party, since many small rural constituencies were dominated by workers in provincial cities who were organised into the powerful Australian Workers&#x27; Union. But after 1957, the Country Party (later renamed the National Party) governments of Sir Frank Nicklin and Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen tweaked the system to give the upper hand to their rural base and isolate Labor support in Brisbane and provincial cities. In later years, this system made it possible for Bjelke-Petersen to win elections with only a quarter of the first preference votes. On average, a Country/National seat took only 7,000 votes to win, compared with 12,000 for a Labor seat. Combined with the votes of the Liberals (in Queensland, the National Party had historically been the senior partner in the non-Labor coalition), this was enough to lock Labor out of power even in years when Labor was the biggest single party in the legislature. This &quot;Bjelkemander&quot; was not overcome until the final defeat of the Nationals in 1989. Under new Labor premier Wayne Goss, a revised map was enacted with 40 seats in Brisbane and 49 in the country. Seats had roughly the same number of voters, with a greater tolerance allowed for seats in rural areas.

====Western Australia====
Western Australia retained a significant malapportionment in the Legislative Assembly until 2008. Under the previous system, votes in the country were worth up to four times the value of votes in Perth, the state&#x27;s capital city. On 20 May 2005 the state Parliament passed new electoral laws, removing the malapportionment with effect from the following election. Under the new laws, electorates must have a population of 21,343, with a permitted variation of 10%. Electorates with a land area of more than are permitted to have a variation of 20%, in recognition of the difficulty of representing the sparsely populated north and east of the state. Large districts would be attributed an extra number of notional voters, equal to 1.5% the area of the district in square kilometres, for the purposes of this calculation. This Large District Allowance will permit large rural districts to have many fewer voters than the average district enrolment. The Office of the Electoral Distribution Commissioners gives the following example: Central Kimberley-Pilbara district has 12601 electors and an area of 600038 square kilometres. The average district enrolment for WA is 21343. Central Kimberley-Pilbara thus obtains 9000 notional extra electors, bringing its notional total to 21601, which is acceptably close to the average district enrolment.

A modified form of malapportionment was, however, retained for the Legislative Council, the state upper house. Rural areas are still slightly overrepresented, with as much as six times the voting power of Perth on paper. According to ABC election analyst Antony Green, the rural weighting in the Legislative Council is still significant enough that a Liberal state premier has no choice but to include the National Party in his government, even if the Liberals theoretically have enough seats in the Legislative Assembly to govern alone.

This situation remained until November 2021, when the &quot;Electoral Legislation Amendment (Electoral Equality) Bill 2021&quot; was passed, replacing the malapportioned regions with a single state-wide electorate of 37 members. GVTs were also replaced by optional preferential voting. The changes will take effect in the 2025 state election.

==Federal Parliament==

The Parliament of Australia is a bicameral (two-house) parliament. It combines some of the features of the Parliament of the United Kingdom with some features of the United States Congress. This is because the authors of the Australian Constitution had two objectives: to reproduce as faithfully as possible the Westminster system of parliamentary government, while creating a federation in which there would be a division of powers between the national government and the states, regulated by a written constitution.

In &quot;structure&quot;, the Australian Parliament resembles the United States Congress. There is a House of Representatives elected from single-member constituencies of approximately equal population, and there is a Senate consisting of an equal number of senators from each state, regardless of population (since 1975 there have also been senators representing the territories).

But in &quot;function&quot;, the Australian Parliament follows the Westminster system. The Prime Minister holds office because they can command the support of the majority of the House of Representatives, and must resign or advise an immediate election if the house passes a vote of no-confidence in their administration. If they fail to do so, he risks dismissal by the Governor-General. All ministers are required to be members of Parliament (although the constitution permits a person who is not currently a member of parliament to hold a ministerial portfolio for a maximum period of three months).

===The House of Representatives===
The Australian House of Representatives has 151 members elected from single-member constituencies (formally called &quot;Electoral Divisions&quot;, but usually called &quot;seats&quot; or &quot;electorates&quot; in Australia; see Australian electorates) for three-year terms. Voters must fill in the ballot paper by numbering all the candidates in order of their preference. Failure to number all the candidates, or an error in numbering, renders the ballot &quot;informal&quot; (invalid). The average number of candidates has tended to increase in recent years: there are frequently 10 or 12 candidates in a seat, and at the Wills by-election in April 1992 there were 22 candidates. This has made voting increasingly onerous, but the rate of informal voting has increased only slightly.

The low rate of informal voting is largely attributed to advertising from the various political parties indicating how a voter should number their ballot paper, called a &quot;How-to-Vote Card&quot;. On election day, volunteers from political parties stand outside polling places, handing voters a card which advises them how to cast their vote for their respective party. Thus, if a voter wishes to vote for the Liberal Party, they may take the Liberal How-to-Vote Card and follow its instructions. While they can lodge their vote according to their own preferences, Australian voters show a high degree of party loyalty in following their chosen party&#x27;s card.

A disinterested voter who has formed no personal preference may simply number all the candidates sequentially, 1, 2, 3, etc., from top to bottom of the ballot paper, a practice termed &quot;donkey voting,&quot; which advantages those candidates whose names are placed nearest to the top of the ballot paper. Before 1984, candidates were listed in alphabetical order, which led to a profusion of Aaronses and Abbotts contesting elections. A notable example was the 1937 Senate election, in which the Labor candidate group in New South Wales consisted of Amour, Ashley, Armstrong and Arthur—all of whom were elected. Since 1984, the listed order of candidates on the ballot paper has been determined by drawing lots, a ceremony performed publicly by electoral officials immediately after the appointed time for closure of nominations.

====Lower house primary, two-party and seat results since 1910====
A two-party system has existed in the Australian House of Representatives since the two non-Labor parties merged in 1909. The 1910 election was the first to elect a majority government, with the Australian Labor Party concurrently winning the first Senate majority. A two-party-preferred vote (2PP) has been calculated since the 1919 change from first-past-the-post to preferential voting and subsequent introduction of the Coalition. ALP = Australian Labor Party, L+NP = grouping of Liberal/National/LNP/CLP Coalition parties (and predecessors), Oth = other parties and independents.


====Counting votes in elections for the House of Representatives====

The House of Representatives uses full preferential voting, which is known outside Australia by names such as &quot;instant runoff voting&quot; (IRV) and &quot;alternative voting&quot;.

When the polls close at 6 pm on election day, the votes are counted. The count is conducted by officers of the Australian Electoral Commission, watched by nominated volunteer observers from the political parties, called &quot;scrutineers&quot;, who are entitled to observe the whole voting process from the opening of the booth. The votes from each polling booth in the electorate are tallied at the office of the returning officer for the electorate. If one of the candidates has more than 50% of the vote, then they are declared elected. Australian politics are influenced by social and economic demographics, though the correlation between &quot;class&quot; and voting is not always simple. Typically, the National Party will poll higher in rural seats. The Liberal Party and the Australian Labor Party are not as easily generalised. In a strong seat, the elected party might win up to 80% of the two-party-preferred vote. In the 2004 federal election, the highest winning margin in a seat was 25.1%, with most seats won by a margin of less than 10%.

In the remaining seats, no single candidate will have a majority of the &quot;primary votes&quot; (or &quot;first-preference votes&quot;). A hypothetical result might look like this:

On election night, an interim distribution of preferences called a TCP (two-candidate-preferred) count is performed. The electoral commission nominates the two candidates it believes are most likely to win the most votes and all votes are distributed immediately to one or the other preferred candidate. This result is indicative only and subsequently the formal count will be performed after all &quot;declaration&quot; (e.g. postal, absent votes) votes are received.

In this example, the candidate with the smallest vote, Davies, will be eliminated, and his or her &quot;preferences&quot; will be distributed: that is, his or her 4,000 votes will be individually re-allocated to the remaining candidates according to which candidate received the number 2 vote on each of those 4000 ballot papers. Suppose Davies&#x27;s preferences split 50/50 between Smith and Jones. After re-allocation of Davies&#x27;s votes, Smith would have 47% and Jones 37% of the total votes in the electorate. White would then be eliminated. Suppose all of White&#x27;s preferences went to Smith. Smith would then have 53% and would be declared elected. Johnson&#x27;s votes would not need to be distributed.

====Exhausted preferences====
The &quot;exhausted&quot; counts correspond to votes that ought to be informal, if strictly following the rules above, but were deemed to have expressed some valid preferences. The Electoral Act has since been amended to almost eliminate exhausted votes.

Section 268(1)(c) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 now has the effect of making the vote of any elector that does not preference every candidate on the ballot paper an informal vote as opposed to counting the vote until the voter&#x27;s preference exhausts.

====Two-party majorities, swings and pendulums====

Since 1984 the preferences of all candidates in House of Representatives seats have been distributed, even if this is not necessary to determine the winner of the seat. This is done to determine the percentage of the votes obtained by the winning candidate after the distribution of all preferences. This is called the two-party-preferred vote. For example, if (in the example given above), Smith finished with 58% of the vote after the distribution of Johnson&#x27;s preferences, Smith&#x27;s two-party vote would be 58% and the seat would be said to have a &quot;two-party majority&quot; of 8%. It would therefore need a &quot;two-party swing&quot; of 8 percentage points to be lost to the other side of politics at the next election.

Once the two-party majorities in all seats are known, they can then be arranged in a table to show the order in which they would be lost in the event of an adverse swing at the next election. Such tables frequently appear in the Australian media and are called &quot;election pendulums&quot; or sometimes &quot;Mackerras pendulums&quot; after the political scientist Malcolm Mackerras, who popularised the idea of the two-party vote in his 1972 book &quot;Australian General Elections&quot;.

Here is a sample of the federal election pendulum from the 2001 election, showing some of the seats held by the Liberal-National Party coalition government, in order of their two-party majority. A seat with a small two-party majority is said to be a &quot;marginal seat&quot; or a &quot;swinging seat&quot;. A seat with a large two-party majority is said to be a &quot;safe seat&quot;, although &quot;safe&quot; seats have been known to change hands in the event of a large swing.

====Redistributions====

The boundaries of Australian electoral divisions are reviewed periodically by the Australian Electoral Commission and redrawn in a process called redistribution.

The &quot;Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918&quot; requires that all seats have approximately an equal number of enrolled voters. When the Commission determines that population shifts within a state have caused some seats to have too many or too few voters, a redistribution is called and new boundaries are drawn up.

Redistributions are also held when the Commission determines (following a formula laid down in the &quot;Electoral Act&quot;) that the distribution of seats among the states and territories must be changed because some states are growing faster than others.

====House casual vacancies====

If a member&#x27;s seat becomes vacant mid-term, whether through disqualification, resignation, death or some other possible reason, a by-election may be held to fill the casual vacancy. A member may resign by tendering the resignation to the Speaker, as required by section 37 of the Australian Constitution, or in the absence of the Speaker to the Governor-General. A resignation is not effective until it is tendered in writing to the Speaker or Governor-General. If a redistribution has taken place since the last election, the by-election is held on the basis of the boundaries at the time of original election.

===Senate===

The Australian Senate has 76 members: each of the six states elects 12 senators, and the Northern Territory (NT) and the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) each elect two senators. The several other Australian Territories have very small populations and are represented by Northern Territory and ACT Senators (for example, Christmas Island residents are represented by NT Senators, while Jervis Bay Territory and Norfolk Island residents are represented by ACT Senators).

Senators for the states serve six-year terms, with half the senators from each state usually being elected at each federal election. The terms of the territory senators coincide with the duration of the House of Representatives.

The Senate is elected both proportionately and preferentially, except that each state has an equal number of seats so that the distribution of seats to states is non-proportional to the total Australian population. Thus, although within each state the seats proportionally represent the vote for that state, overall the less populous states are proportionally stronger in representation for their population compared to the more populous states.

At the 2013 federal election, the Senate election, contested by over 50 groups, saw extensive &quot;preference deals&quot; (legitimate manipulation of group voting tickets), resulting in the election to the Senate of Ricky Muir from the Australian Motoring Enthusiast Party, who had received only 0.5% of first-preference support. This exploitation of the system was alleged to undermine the entitlement of voters &quot;to be able to make real choices, not forced ones—and to know who they really are voting for&quot;.

Following the 2013 election, the Abbott Liberal government announced it would investigate changing the electoral system for the Senate in order to prevent the preference system being abused. On 22 February 2016, the Turnbull Liberal government announced several proposed changes. The changes had the support of the Liberal/National Coalition, the Australian Greens, and Nick Xenophon − a three-vote majority. The Senate reform legislation passed both houses of the Parliament of Australia on 18 March 2016 after the Senate sat all night debating the bill.

The changes abolished group voting tickets and introduced &quot;optional&quot; preferential voting, along with party logos on the ballot paper. The ballot paper continues to have a box for each party above a heavy line, with each party&#x27;s candidates in a column below that party&#x27;s box below the solid line. Previously, a voter could either mark a single box &quot;above the line&quot;, which triggered the party&#x27;s group voting ticket (a pre-assigned sequence of preferences), or place a number in every box &quot;below the line&quot; to assign their own preferences. As a result of the changes, voters may assign their preferences for parties above the line (numbering as many boxes as they wish), or individual candidates below the line, and are not required to fill all of the boxes. Both above and below the line voting are now optional preferential voting. For above the line, voters are instructed to number at least their first six preferences, however, a &quot;savings provision&quot; still counts the ballot if less than six are given. As a result, fewer votes are classed as informal, however, more ballots do &quot;exhaust&quot; as a result (i.e. some votes are not counted towards electing any candidate). For below the line, voters are required to number at least their first 12 preferences. Voters are still free to continue numbering as many preferences as they like beyond the minimum number specified. Another savings provision allows ballot papers with at least 6 below the line preferences to be formal, catering for people who confuse the above and below the line instructions; an additional change to the savings provision will also accept below the line votes with a higher number of sequence errors than previously, treating the sequence as stopping at the first error (missed or repeated numbers).

As a result of these reforms, it is now much less likely that a candidate with such a minuscule primary vote as Muir&#x27;s in 2013 could win election to the Senate. ABC electoral psephologist Antony Green wrote several publications on various aspects of the proposed Senate reforms.

Usually, a party can realistically hope to win no more than three of a state&#x27;s Senate seats. For this reason, a person listed as fourth or lower on a party ticket is said to be in an &quot;unwinnable&quot; position. For example, incumbent Liberal South Australian Senator Lucy Gichuhi was ranked fourth on the Liberal ticket for the 2019 election, a move that commentators believed made it difficult, if not impossible, for her to win another term.

====Senate count====
The form of preferential voting used in the Senate is technically known as the &quot;Unweighted Inclusive Gregory Method&quot;.

The system for counting Senate votes is complicated, and a final result is sometimes not known for several weeks. When the Senate vote is counted, a &quot;quota&quot; for election is determined. This is the number of valid votes cast, divided by the number of senators to be elected plus one.

For example, here is the Senate result for the state of New South Wales from the 1998 federal election. For greater clarity the votes cast for 50 minor party and independent candidates have been excluded.

The quota for election was 3,755,725 divided by seven, or 536,533.

* Enrolment: 4,031,749
* Turnout: 3,884,333 (96.3%)
* Informal votes: 128,608 (03.3%)
* Formal votes: 3,755,725
* Quota for election: 536,533

In this table, the group number allocated to each list is shown with the number of quotas polled by each list. Thus, &quot;Q:2.7073&quot; next to the Labor Party list indicates that the Labor candidates between them polled 2.7073 quotas.

It will be seen that the leading Labor and Liberal candidates, Hutchins and Heffernan, polled more than the quota. They were therefore elected on the first count. Their &quot;surplus votes&quot; were then distributed. The surplus is the candidate&#x27;s vote minus the quota. Hutchins&#x27;s surplus was thus 1,446,231 minus 536,533, or 909,698. These votes are multiplied by a factor (called the &quot;transfer value&quot;) based on the proportion of ballot papers preferencing other parties. ABC Election commentator Antony Green believes that this method distorts preference allocation.

After Hutchins&#x27;s surplus votes were distributed, the count looked like this:

It will be seen that virtually all of Hutchins&#x27;s surplus votes went to Faulkner, the second candidate on the Labor ticket, who was then elected. This is because all those voters who voted for the Labor party &quot;above the line&quot; had their second preferences &quot;automatically allocated&quot; to the second Labor candidate. All parties lodge a copy of their how-to-vote card with the Electoral Commission, and the commission follows this card in allocating the preferences of those who vote &quot;above the line.&quot; If a voter wished to vote, for example, Hutchins 1 and Heffernan 2, they would need to vote &quot;below the line&quot; by numbering each of the 69 candidates.

In the third count, Heffernan&#x27;s surplus was distributed and these votes elected Tierney. Faulkner&#x27;s surplus was then distributed, but these were insufficient to elect Forshaw. Likewise, Tierney&#x27;s surplus was insufficient to elect McDonald.

After this stage of the count, the remaining candidates in contention (that is, the leading candidates in the major party tickets) were in the following position:

All the other candidates were then eliminated one by one, starting with the candidates with the smallest number of votes, and their votes were distributed among the candidates remaining in contention in accordance with the preferences expressed on their ballot papers. After this process was completed, the remaining candidates were in the following position:

Sutton was then eliminated. 80% of Sutton&#x27;s preferences went to Ridgeway, giving Ridgeway more votes than McDonald. McDonald was then eliminated, and 93% of his preferences went to Ridgeway, thus giving him a quota and the fifth Senate seat. Ridgeway&#x27;s surplus was then distributed, and 96% of his votes went to Forshaw, thus giving him a quota and the sixth seat. Oldfield was the last remaining unsuccessful candidate. Provision for exhausted votes has been made in the current arrangements by providing that the last candidate does not require a quota, just a majority of the remaining votes. However it leaves the possibility that the election could fail, if the number of exhausted votes exceeded two quotas, making it impossible for the second last candidate to reach a quota. With above the line voting running at around 95%, this possibility is extremely remote.

A final point needs to be explained. It was noted above that when a candidate polls more votes than the quota, their surplus vote is distributed to other candidates. Thus, in the example given above, Hutchins&#x27;s surplus was 909,698, or 1,446,231 (his primary vote) minus 536,533 (the quota). It may be asked: &quot;which&quot; 909,698 of Hutchins&#x27;s 1,446,231 primary votes are distributed? Are they chosen at random from among his votes? In fact they are all distributed, but at less than their full value. Since 909,698 is 62.9% of 1,446,231, each of Hutchins&#x27;s votes is transferred to other candidates as 62.9% of a vote: each vote is said to have a &quot;transfer value&quot; of 0.629. This avoids any possibility of an unrepresentative sample of his votes being transferred. After each count the candidate&#x27;s &quot;progressive total&quot; is rounded down to the nearest whole number. This means that a small number of votes are &quot;lost by fractionation&quot; in the final count.

If at the end of the Senate count the two candidates remaining have an equal number of votes, the Australian Electoral Officer for the state shall select one at random.

==== Senate casual vacancies ====

If a senator&#x27;s seat becomes vacant mid-term, through disqualification, resignation, death or other cause, the legislature of the relevant state or territory chooses a replacement senator. A senator may resign by tendering their resignation to the President of the Senate or to the Governor-General, as required by section 19 of the constitution. A resignation is not effective until it is tendered in writing to the President or Governor-General.

===Double dissolutions===

Under the Australian Constitution, the House of Representatives and the Senate generally have equal legislative powers (the only exception being that appropriation (supply) bills must originate in the House of Representatives). This means that a government formed in the House of Representatives can be frustrated if a Senate majority rejects or delays passage of its legislative bills.

In such circumstances, Section 57 of the constitution empowers the Governor-General to dissolve both the House of Representatives and the Senate (termed a &quot;double dissolution&quot;) and issue writs for an election in which every seat in Parliament is contested. The Governor-General would usually take such action only on the advice of the Prime Minister.

<text>Henning Scherf (born 31 October 1938) is a German lawyer and politician of the SPD party who served as President of the Senate and Mayor of Bremen from 4 July 1995 to 8 November 2005.

==Education==
Scherf was born in Bremen. After studying law and social sciences from 1958 until 1962 in Berlin, Hamburg and Freiburg he worked for a Protestant students association (Evangelisches Studentenwerk) until 1964. In 1968 he received his law doctorate from University of Hamburg.

==Political career==
Scherf has been a member of the Social Democratic Party of Germany since 1963.

Scherf went into politics after practicing as a lawyer in Bremen, and was elected to the Bremer Bürgerschaft (parliament) in 1971. From 1978 until 2005 he was a member of Bremen Senate (government) in various functions, including Senator for Finances, Senator for Youth and Social Issues, Senator for Health and Sport, Mayor, Senator for Education and Sciences and Senator of Law and Constitution. In 1995 Scherf was elected President of the Senate and Mayor of Bremen.
He was also the head of the &quot;Vermittlungsausschuss&quot; (negotiations-committee) which resolves conflicts concerning legislation between &quot;Bundesrat&quot; and &quot;Bundestag&quot;, the two houses of the German parliament at the federal level.

Scherf has been re-elected twice due to his popularity in Bremen. He is well known for his warm and friendly character despite his looks (he is 2 m tall). His diplomatic skills, especially in forging compromises and running negotiations, are considered legendary, not only by members of his own party.

For some time Scherf was urged by the people to run for the German Presidency (Bundespräsident) which he declined because of family reasons.

==Other activities==
* Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research, Member of the Board of Trustees
* Gustav Heinemann Civic Award of the SPD, Chairman of the Board of Trustees

==Personal life==
Henning Scherf married his wife Luise in 1960. The couple has three children and nine grandchildren.

He is well known for going to work by bicycle and refusing to accept a car and a driver provided by the city. He also has the habit of only drinking warm water with his meals.

<text>Chevrotains, or mouse-deer, are diminutive, even-toed ungulates that make up the family Tragulidae, and are the only living members of the infraorder Tragulina. The 10 extant species are placed in three genera, but several species also are known only from fossils. The extant species are found in forests in South and Southeast Asia; a single species, the water chevrotain, is found in the rainforests of Central and West Africa. In November 2019, conservation scientists announced that they had photographed silver-backed chevrotains (&quot;Tragulus versicolor&quot;) in a Vietnamese forest for the first time since the last confirmed sightings in 1990.

They are solitary, or live in loose groupings or pairs, and feed almost exclusively on plant material. Chevrotains are the smallest hoofed mammals in the world. The Asian species weigh between , while the African chevrotain is considerably larger, at . With an average length of and an average height of , the Java mouse-deer is the smallest surviving ungulate (hoofed) mammal, as well as the smallest artiodactyl (even-toed ungulate). Despite their common name of &quot;mouse deer&quot;, they are not closely related to true deer.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;chevrotain&quot; comes from the Middle French word &quot;chevrot&quot; (kid or fawn), derived from &quot;chèvre&quot; (goat).

The single African species is consistently known as &quot;chevrotain&quot;. The names &quot;chevrotain&quot; and &quot;mouse-deer&quot; have been used interchangeably among the Asian species, though recent authorities typically have preferred chevrotain for the species in the genus &quot;Moschiola&quot; and mouse-deer for the species in the genus &quot;Tragulus&quot;. Consequently, all species with pale-spotted or -striped upper parts are known as &quot;chevrotain&quot; and without are known as &quot;mouse-deer&quot;.

The Telugu name for the Indian spotted chevrotain is &quot;jarini pandi&quot;, which literally means &quot;a deer and a pig&quot;. In Kannada, it is called &quot;barka&quot; (ಬರ್ಕ), in Malayalam, it is called &quot;kūramān&quot;, and the Konkani name for it is &quot;barinka&quot;. The Tamil term is &quot;sarukumāṉ&quot; &quot;leaf-pile deer&quot;. The Sinhala name roughly translates to &quot;mouse-like deer&quot;. This was used in the scientific name of the Sri Lankan spotted chevrotain, &quot;M. meminna&quot;.

==Biology==
The family was widespread and successful from the Oligocene (34 million years ago) through the Miocene (about 5 million years ago), but has remained almost unchanged over that time and remains as an example of an archaic ruminant type. They have four-chambered stomachs to ferment tough plant foods, but the third chamber is poorly developed. Unlike other artiodactyls, they lack an carotid rete, and so cannot heat exchange cool blood entering their brains, a thermoregulatory innovation that allows other artiodactyls to exploit hot arid habitats. Though most species feed exclusively on plant material, the water chevrotain occasionally takes insects and crabs or scavenges meat and fish. Like other ruminants, they lack upper incisors. They give birth to only a single young.

In other respects, however, they have primitive features, closer to nonruminants such as pigs. All species in the family lack antlers and horns, but both sexes have elongated canine teeth. These are especially prominent in males, where they project out on either side of the lower jaw, and are used in fights. Their legs are short and thin, which leave them lacking in agility, but also helps to maintain a smaller profile to aid in running through the dense foliage of their environments. Other pig-like features include the presence of four toes on each foot, the absence of facial scent glands, premolars with sharp crowns, and the form of their sexual behaviour and copulation.
They are solitary or live in pairs. The young are weaned at three months of age, and reach sexual maturity between 5 and 10 months, depending on species. Parental care is relatively limited. Although they lack the types of scent glands found in most other ruminants, they do possess a chin gland for marking each other as mates or antagonists, and, in the case of the water chevrotain, anal and preputial glands for marking territory. Their territories are relatively small, on the order of , but neighbors generally ignore each other, rather than compete aggressively.

Some of the species show a remarkable affinity with water, often remaining submerged for prolonged periods to evade predators or other unwelcome intrusions. This has also lent support to the idea that whales evolved from water-loving creatures that looked like small deer.

==Taxonomy==
Tragulidae&#x27;s placement within Artiodactyla can be represented in the following cladogram:

Traditionally, only four extant species were recognized in the family Tragulidae. In 2004, &quot;T. nigricans&quot; and &quot;T. versicolor&quot; were split from &quot;T. napu&quot;, and &quot;T. kanchil&quot; and &quot;T. williamsoni&quot; were split from &quot;T. javanicus&quot;. In 2005, &quot;M. indica&quot; and &quot;M. kathygre&quot; were split from &quot;M. meminna&quot;. With these changes, the 10 extant species are:

* Family Tragulidae
** Genus &quot;Hyemoschus&quot;
*** Water chevrotain, &quot;Hyemoschus aquaticus&quot;
** Genus &quot;Moschiola&quot;
*** Indian spotted chevrotain, &quot;Moschiola indica&quot;
*** Sri Lankan spotted chevrotain, &quot;Moschiola meminna&quot;
*** Yellow-striped chevrotain, &quot;Moschiola kathygre&quot;
** Genus &quot;Tragulus&quot;
*** Java mouse-deer, &quot;Tragulus javanicus&quot;
*** Lesser mouse-deer or kanchil, &quot;Tragulus kanchil&quot;
*** Greater mouse-deer, &quot;Tragulus napu&quot;
*** Philippine mouse-deer, &quot;Tragulus nigricans&quot;
*** Vietnam mouse-deer, &quot;Tragulus versicolor&quot;
*** Williamson&#x27;s mouse-deer, &quot;Tragulus williamsoni&quot;

==Ancient chevrotains==

The Hypertragulidae were closely related to the Tragulidae.

The six extinct chevrotain genera include:

*Genus &quot;Yunnanotherium&quot;
*Genus &quot;Archaeotragulus&quot;
**&quot;Archaeotragulus krabiensis&quot; Metais, Chaimanee, Jaeger and Ducrocq, 2001 (late Eocene) from Krabi, Thailand

The extinct chevrotains might also include
*Genus &quot;Krabitherium&quot;
**&quot;Krabitherium waileki&quot; Metais, Chaimanee, Jaeger and Ducrocq, 2007 (late Eocene) from Krabi, Thailand
*Genus &quot;Nalameryx&quot;
**&quot;Nalameryx savagei&quot;
**&quot;Nalameryx sulaimani&quot;

== Mythology ==
According to the &quot;Malay Annals&quot;, King Parameswara, seeking a place to found a new city, came to a place where he saw a mouse deer (&quot;kancil&quot; in Malay) kicking his hunting dog into the river. He thought this boded well, remarking, &#x27;this place is excellent, even the mouse deer is formidable; it is best that we establish a kingdom here&#x27;. He then founded there the city of Malacca. In memory of this founding legend, the coat of arms of Malacca depicts two mouse deer.

The mouse deer or Sang Kancil is also a clever character from several Malay folktales.

<text>The flat-tailed day gecko (Phelsuma serraticauda) is a diurnal gecko lives in eastern Madagascar. It is endangered due to illegal collection for the international pet trade. It typically inhabits rainforests and dwells on trees. The flat-tailed day gecko feeds on insects and nectar.

==Description==
This lizard can reach an average total length of about 13 cm whereas females are slightly smaller. Some males may even reach a length of 15 cm. The body colour is dark green or yellowish green. Remarkable is the broad, flattened tail with serrated edges. On the lower back three red tear-shaped markings dots are present. On the neck, which may be bluish, two longitudinal yellow stripes are present. On the snout and head, there are three transversal red bars.

==Distribution==
This species occurs on the east coast of Madagascar. It is only known from the region 12 km north of Toamasina.

==Habitat==

&quot;Phelsuma serraticauda&quot; is largely restricted to coconut palms yet can also be found on banana trees.

==Diet==
These day geckos feed on various insects and other invertebrates. They also like to lick soft, sweet fruit, pollen and nectar.

==Behaviour==
This species lives in groups with one male and up to five females. Amongst the females, there is a well-developed dominance hierarchy. Juveniles are tolerated up to a certain size.

==Reproduction==
The females lay up to 4 pairs of eggs per year. At a temperature of 28 °C, the young will hatch after approximately 53–58 days. The juveniles are typically 40 mm in length.

==Captivity==
The flat-tailed day gecko is endangered due to illegal collection for the international pet trade.

<text>The Virginia Plan (also known as the Randolph Plan or the Large-State Plan) was a proposed plan of government for the United States presented at the Constitutional Convention of 1787. The plan called for the creation of a supreme national government with three branches and a bicameral legislature. The plan was drafted by James Madison and Edmund Randolph.

The Virginia Plan was notable for its role in setting the overall agenda for debate in the Convention and, in particular, for setting forth the idea of population-weighted representation in the proposed national legislature. The Virginia Plan favored the interests of states with large populations, and the New Jersey Plan was proposed in response to protect small state interests.

==Drafting and proposal==
From May 25 to September 17, 1787, the Constitutional Convention gathered in Philadelphia to revise the Articles of Confederation, the first plan of government of the United States. The Articles were widely criticized for creating a weak central government—the Confederation Congress—that was powerless to solve the nation&#x27;s problems. Under the Articles, Congress was unable to raise taxes to pay for a military or pay off foreign debts. It also lacked the authority to control foreign and interstate commerce. The Articles had no provision for executive and judicial branches, which meant the Confederation government lacked effective means to enforce its own laws and treaties against non-compliant states.

James Madison, a delegate from Virginia, believed that the solution to America&#x27;s problems was to be found in a strong central government. Congress needed compulsory taxation authority as well as power to regulate foreign and interstate commerce. To prevent state interference with the national government&#x27;s authority, Madison believed there needed to be a way to enforce the national supremacy, such as an explicit right of Congress to use force against non-compliant states and the creation of a national court system. Madison also believed that to be a truly national government, Congress would need to exercise authority over citizens directly—not simply through the states. This would require a change in how states were represented in Congress; under the Articles each state received one vote. Madison believed representation ought to be apportioned by population, with more populous states having more votes than less populous states.

Madison was also concerned with preventing a tyranny of the majority. The government needed to be neutral between the various factions or interest groups that divided society—creditors and debtors, rich and poor, or farmers, merchants and manufacturers. Madison believed that a single faction could more easily control the government within a state but would have a more difficult time dominating a national government comprising many different interest groups. To protect both national authority and minority rights, Madison believed Congress should be granted veto power over state laws.

While waiting for the Convention to formally begin, Madison sketched out the Virginia Plan in consultation with members of the Virginia and Pennsylvania delegations, particularly Virginia&#x27;s governor, Edmund Randolph, who largely shared his vision of a strong national government. While Madison is often given chief credit for producing the plan, it was Randolph who contributed substantial elements of it and then officially put it before the Convention on May 29, 1787. In his introduction, Randolph highlighted the problems facing the Confederation. Referring to Shays&#x27; Rebellion in Massachusetts, he warned of &quot;anarchy from the laxity of government&quot;. The solution to these problems, he asserted, must be based on &quot;the republican principle&quot;.

==Resolutions==
Calling for the creation of a supreme national government, the Virginia Plan was a radical departure from the Articles of Confederation. Modeled on the existing state governments, the plan called for three branches of government (executive, legislative and judicial). Since the legislature appointed both the executive and judicial branches, however, the plan lacked the system of checks and balances that became central to the US Constitution. It was presented to the Convention as fifteen draft resolutions that outlined basic principles of government.

# The Articles of Confederation needed to be &quot;corrected and enlarged&quot; to achieve their original purpose, which was to provide for the &quot;common defense, security of liberty, and general welfare&quot;. While presented as a revision of the Articles, the Virginia Plan was in reality a replacement of the Articles.
# Representation in the national legislature should be apportioned according either to &quot;quotas of contribution&quot; (a state&#x27;s wealth as reflected in the taxes it paid) or the size of each state&#x27;s non-slave population. This would provide large states, like Virginia, more representation than they had under the Articles of Confederation, which gave each state equal representation regardless of population. For this reason, the plan was called the &quot;large-state plan&quot;.
# The unicameral Confederation Congress should be replaced with a bicameral legislature. 
# Unlike members of the Confederation Congress who were elected by and responsible to the state legislatures, the members of the first branch of the legislature (what would become the House of Representatives) would be elected by the people. Members of the first branch would be subject to rotation in office and recall elections.
# The first branch of the legislature would select the members of the second branch (what would become the Senate) from candidates nominated by state legislatures. 
# The national legislature would have all the legislative power belonging to the Confederation Congress in addition to new powers. These new powers include &quot;to legislate in all cases to which the separate states are incompetent&quot; and the ability to veto any state law that was contrary to the articles of union.
# The national legislature would choose a national executive to serve a single term. The executive would have a &quot;general authority to execute the national laws&quot; as well as the executive powers granted to the Confederation Congress, including the power to make war and treaties.
# The executive together with a &quot;convenient number&quot; of judges would form a council of revision with the power to veto any act of the national or state legislatures. This veto could be overridden by an unspecified number of votes of the national legislature.
# The national judiciary would include a supreme tribunal and inferior tribunals chosen by the national legislature. Judges would hold office during good behavior. The judicial branch would have jurisdiction over piracy, felonies on the high seas, enemy captures, cases involving foreigners or citizens of multiple states, cases involving collection of national revenue, questions involving &quot;national peace and harmony&quot;, and impeachment of national officials.
# There should be procedures for the admission of new states into the Union.
# The United States will guarantee a republican government to each state.
# &quot;[P]rovision ought to be made for the continuance of Congress and their authorities and privileges, until a given day after the reform of the articles of Union shall be adopted, and for the completion of all their engagements.&quot;
# A process for amending the constitution will be provided that does not require the assent of the national legislature.
# State officers would take an oath to support the constitution. 
# The proposals of the Constitutional Convention would be ratified by assemblies elected by the people. 

==Reaction==
Large states supported this plan, and smaller states generally opposed it, preferring alternatives that guaranteed each state equal representation regardless of population. On June 15, 1787, the smaller states presented the New Jersey Plan, which proposed a single-chamber legislature where each state, regardless of population, would have one vote, as under the Articles of Confederation. In July, after the meeting of the First Committee of Eleven, the Convention settled on the Connecticut Compromise, creating a House of Representatives apportioned by population and a Senate in which each state is equally represented. 

==Popular culture==
The Virginia Plan and the debate surrounding it are prominently featured in the 1989 film &quot;A More Perfect Union&quot;, which depicts the events of the 1787 Constitutional Convention. Presented largely from the viewpoint and words of James Madison, the movie was mainly filmed in Independence Hall.

<doc id="318329" wikidata="Q920507" url="?curid=318329" title="Square academic cap">
<text>The square academic cap, graduate cap, cap, mortarboard (because of its similarity in appearance to the mortarboard used by brickmasons to hold mortar) or Oxford cap is an item of academic dress consisting of a horizontal square board fixed upon a skull-cap, with a tassel attached to the centre. In the UK and the US, it is commonly referred to informally in conjunction with an academic gown as a &quot;cap and gown&quot;. It is also sometimes termed a square, trencher, or corner-cap. The adjective academical is also used.

The cap, together with the gown and sometimes a hood, now form the customary uniform of a university graduate in many parts of the world, following a British model.
== Origins ==

The mortarboard may have developed from the biretta, a similar-looking hat worn by Roman Catholic clergy. The biretta itself may have been a development of the Roman &quot;pileus quadratus&quot;, a type of skullcap with superposed square and tump (meaning small mound). A reinvention of this type of cap is known as the Bishop Andrewes cap. The Italian &quot;biretta&quot; is a word derived from the Medieval Latin &quot;birretum&quot; from the Late Latin &quot;&quot; &quot;large hooded cloak&quot;, which is perhaps of Gaulish origin, or from Ancient Greek πυρρός &quot;pyrrhos&quot; &quot;flame-coloured, yellow&quot;.

== Tassel ==
=== United Kingdom ===

In the UK, the tassel is shorter and is gathered at the button at the centre of the board. The US style is slightly longer, gathered at a cord attached to the button.

At the University of Cambridge, undergraduates by ancient convention used to cut their tassels very short so that the tassel does not extend beyond the edge of the board. After they graduated, they wore the square cap with the tassel at the normal length. This convention has now fallen into disuse; few people now wear headgear with academic dress at any time and undergraduates in particular have no need to wear the cap.

=== United States ===
The American Council on Education (ACE) code states that &quot;The tassel should be black or the colour appropriate to the subject,&quot; and makes an exception only for the gold tassel. The gold metallic tassel is reserved for those entitled to wear the doctoral gown, as is the use of velvet for headwear. Only one tassel is worn at a time.


Other countries may have different colours for different disciplines. 

For schools where the graduation regalia is rented or borrowed by the student, the tassel might be a part of the rental or provided separately. Some schools that do not provide a tassel for graduates to keep may offer a souvenir tassel that is not worn with the regalia.

== Traditional wear ==

As with other forms of headdress, academic caps are not generally worn indoors by men (other than by the Chancellor or other high officials), but are usually carried.

At the University of Oxford, caps are mandatory dress for matriculation events and for all examinations. It is a commonly repeated myth at Oxford that the cap must be held and may not be worn at all except at the student&#x27;s graduation; however, there is no rule in the university to this effect, and undergraduates wearing formal academic dress may either carry the cap or wear it. In particular, women undergraduates who exercise the right to wear a soft Canterbury cap must wear it on their head, rather than carrying it. Additionally, all undergraduates appearing before the Proctors&#x27; Court are required to present themselves wearing their caps, before removing them as proceedings start.

In some graduation ceremonies caps have been dispensed with for men, being issued only to women, who do wear them indoors, or have been abandoned altogether. This has led to urban legends in universities in the United Kingdom and Ireland which have as a common theme the idea that the wearing of the cap was abandoned in protest at the admission of women to the university. In Ireland, a common belief holds that only women wear the mortarboard because a bachelor&#x27;s degree was thought to be the maximum education they could attain and thus represented the &#x27;capping&#x27; of their education, however there is little evidence for this. Dr. David Fleming of the History Department at the University of Limerick called this reason &#x27;complete nonsense and an urban myth&#x27;, while the university&#x27;s gown partner, Phelan Nolan said &#x27;Women used to wear hats in Church and that is where the tradition has come from&#x27;.

There are several types of mortarboard. The most common in the UK is the &#x27;folding skull&#x27; in which the skull part can be folded for ease of storing and carrying. Traditionally, the mortarboard had a &#x27;rigid skull&#x27; which is considered more aesthetically pleasing and better fitting than a folding-skull one. In addition, the rigid skull type has the advantage of being easier to doff than the folding skull version, as there is no possibility of the skull collapsing in on itself. Many degree ceremonies in British universities include the ritual doffing of caps. Both types require the wearer to wear the appropriate size to fit. In the US, an &#x27;elasticated skull&#x27; is mostly used, which eliminates the need to make many mortarboards in different hat sizes. Some mortarboards, especially those in east Asia are laced-up at the back of the skull cap.

The correct way to wear a mortarboard is to have the larger part of the skull of the mortarboard at the back of the head with the top board parallel to the ground. A properly fitting mortarboard should not fall off easily.

Until the second half of the twentieth century, mortarboards were often worn by schoolteachers, and the hat remains an icon of the teaching profession.

Mortarboards are often seen in party supply shops in the United States in May and June, when they appear in the form of party decorations, on commemorative gifts such as teddy bears, and on congratulatory greeting cards.

=== Mourning cap ===

A version of the mortarboard is worn during mourning. Instead of a tassel and button on top of the board, there are two black ribbons that are attached from corner to corner of the board forming a cross. At the centre where the two ribbons intersect a black ribbon rosette is attached. The ribbon for the wide ribbons is grosgrain ribbon whilst the rosette can be made of either the same grosgrain or satin. This mourning cap can be worn when mourning a personal friend or a family relative.

Another version has nine ribbon bows called &quot;butterflies&quot; attached to the back of the skull cap (three running vertically down the back seam, two vertically on either side further towards the sides and one on either side at the sides of the skull) in addition to the above. This cap is worn during the mourning of the monarch, a member of the royal family or the university chancellor.

The mourning cap is worn with mourning bands (normal bands but with a pleat running down each band) and a mourning gown which is either a Cambridge DD undress gown with &quot;pudding-sleeves&quot; but in black stuff rather than silk as worn in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries or a plain black stuff gown. Hoods are not worn, as they are considered festal items. However, Cambridge proctors in the past wore their MA hoods squared, so as to conceal the lining; since the lining was white it did not clash with the black and white colour scheme of mourning.

<text>&#x27; (), popularly known as Libé&quot;&quot;&#x27; (), is a daily newspaper in France, founded in Paris by Jean-Paul Sartre and Serge July in 1973 in the wake of the protest movements of May 1968. Initially positioned on the far left of France&#x27;s political spectrum, the editorial line evolved towards a more centre-left stance at the end of the 1970s, where it remains as of 2012.

The publication describes its &quot;DNA&quot; as being &quot;liberal libertarian&quot;. It aims to act as a common platform for the diverse tendencies within the French Left, with its &quot;compass&quot; being &quot;the defence of freedoms and of minorities&quot;. Edouard de Rothschild&#x27;s acquisition of a 37% capital interest in 2005, and editor Serge July&#x27;s campaign for the &quot;yes&quot; vote in the referendum establishing a Constitution for Europe the same year, alienated it from a number of its left-wing readers.

In its early days, it was noted for its irreverent and humorous style and unorthodox journalistic culture. All employees, including management, received the same salary. In addition to traditional editor&#x27;s notes, known as Note de la rédaction and marked as N.D.L.R., it included the innovative NDLC (&quot;note de la claviste&quot;), apt and witty comments inserted at the last moment by the typesetter. It was the first French daily to have a website. It had a circulation of about 67,000 in 2018. &quot;Libération&quot; has been considered a newspaper of record in France.

==History==
===First period (1973–81)===
 was founded by Jean-Paul Sartre, Philippe Gavi, Bernard Lallement, Jean-Claude Vernier, Pierre Victor alias Benny Lévy and Serge July and was first published on 3 February 1973, in the wake of the protest movements of May 1968. Sartre remained editor of until 24 May 1974. During this period one of the contributors was Samir Frangieh, a leftist Lebanese journalist.

The paper was initially run along non-hierarchical lines, with all staff – from the editor-in-chief to the janitor – receiving the same salary, but this later gave way to a &quot;normal set-up&quot;. In the early 1980s it began to take advertisements and allowed external bodies to have a stake in its financing, which it had completely refused before, but continued to maintain a left leaning editorial stance.

===Second period (since 1981)===
After several crises, temporarily stopped being published in February 1981. It resumed publication on 13 May under a new format, with Serge July as new director.

Although is not affiliated with any political party, it has, from its theoretical origins in the May 1968 turmoil in France, a left-wing slant. According to co-founder and former director Serge July, &quot;Libé&quot; was an activist newspaper that, however, does not support any particular political party, acts as a counter-power, and generally has bad relations with both left-wing and right-wing administrations. &quot;Libé&quot;&#x27;s opinion pages (&quot;rebonds&quot;) publish views from many political standpoints. An example of their proclaimed independent, &quot;counter-power&quot; slant is when in 1993 leaked Socialist president François Mitterrand&#x27;s illegal wiretapping program.

 is known for its sometimes alternative points of view on cultural and social events. For instance, in addition to reports about crimes and other events, it also chronicles daily criminal trials, bringing in a more human vision of petty criminals. As Serge July puts it, &quot;the equation of consisted in combining counter-culture and political radicalism&quot;. The editors&#x27; decision, in 2005, to support the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe (TCE) was criticized by many of its readers, who later decided to vote &quot;no&quot; to a treaty seen as too neoliberal, lacking social views deemed necessary to the solid foundation of a &quot;European nation&quot;.

On 11 December 2010, started hosting a mirror of the WikiLeaks website, including the United States diplomatic cables and other document collections, in solidarity with WikiLeaks, in order to prevent it from being &quot;suffocated&quot; by &quot;governments and companies that were trying to block [WikiLeaks&#x27;] functioning without even a judicial decision&quot;.

In June 2015, , working with WikiLeaks, reported that the United States National Security Agency had been secretly spying on the telephone conversations of presidents Jacques Chirac, Nicolas Sarkozy and François Hollande from at least 2006 through 2012.

===Édouard de Rothschild&#x27;s involvement===
In 2005 badly needed funds, and Serge July strove to convince the board to allow Édouard de Rothschild to buy a stake in the paper. The board agreed on 20 January 2005. Social conflicts arose shortly after. On 25 November 2005, the paper went on strike, protesting against the layoff of 52 workers. Rothschild, who had promised he would not interfere in editorial decisions, decided that he was not playing an active enough role in the paper&#x27;s management. In May 2006 the paper announced a weekend magazine called &quot;Libé week-end&quot;, with a supplement called &quot;Ecrans&quot; (covering television, internet and film), and another called &quot;R&quot;. (The latter was abandoned in September of the same year.)

On 13 June 2006, Serge July told the editorial staff that Édouard de Rothschild was refusing to invest more money in the paper unless Louis Dreyfus (directeur général) and himself left the paper. July had accepted, believing the paper&#x27;s future existence to depend on his decision. The journalists were shocked. The next day, they published a public statement praising the paper&#x27;s founder and expressing their worries about journalistic independence. Serge July left the paper on 30 June 2006.

A debate between Bernard Lallement, the first administrator-manager of and Edouard de Rothschild took place in newspaper. In a column published on 4 July 2006, Lallement argued that July&#x27;s departure was the end of an era where &quot;writing meant something&quot;. Lallement painted a bleak picture of &#x27;s future, as well as that of the press as a whole. Criticizing Rothschild&#x27;s interference, Lallement quoted Sartre, who had famously said that &quot;Money doesn&#x27;t have any ideas&quot;. Later, on his blog, Lallement argued that Rothschild, who had had no historic attachment to the paper, was only interested in making money, not in the paper itself. On 6 July, Rothschild declared: &quot; needs help and moral, intellectual and financial support. doesn&#x27;t need a requiem.&quot;

Sixty-two employees—including 35 journalists, such as Antoine de Gaudemar, chief editor, Sorj Chalandon, who was awarded the Albert Londres Prize, both present since the 1973 creation of &quot;Libé&quot;, and Pierre Haski, deputy editor, present since 1981—were about to resign at end of January 2007 (on a total of 276 employees). With the 55 other employees who left the newspaper at the end of 2005, this made a total of about 150 staff who had left since Rothschild&#x27;s ownership, not including tens of resignations (including Florence Aubenas, Dominique Simonnot, Antoine de Baecque, Jean Hatzfeld)

In May 2007, former journalists, including Pierre Haski and Pascal Riché (Op-Ed editor of ) created the news website &quot;Rue 89&quot;.

In 2014, the newspaper once again found itself in the news, following a public dispute between its journalists and shareholders over the future of the newspaper. In the face of falling circulation the latter had sought to re-invent the paper&#x27;s web site as a social network. The editor-in-chief Nicolas Demorand resigned over the row.

<text>Aimé Fernand David Césaire (; ; 26 June 1913 – 17 April 2008) was a Martiniquais poet, author, and politician. He was &quot;one of the founders of the Négritude movement in Francophone literature&quot; and coined the word in French. He founded the Parti progressiste martiniquais in 1958, and served in the French National Assembly from 1945 to 1993 and as President of the Regional Council of Martinique from 1983 to 1988. He was also the Mayor of Fort-de-France for 56 years, from 1945–2001.

His works include the book-length poem &quot;Cahier d&#x27;un retour au pays natal&quot; (1939), &quot;Une Tempête&quot;, a response to William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;The Tempest&quot;, and &quot;Discours sur le colonialisme&quot; (&quot;Discourse on Colonialism&quot;), an essay describing the strife between the colonizers and the colonized. Césaire&#x27;s works have been translated into many languages.

==Student, educator and poet==

Aimé Césaire was born in Basse-Pointe, Martinique, French Caribbean, in 1913. His father was a tax inspector, and his mother was a dressmaker. &#x27;Although in his Cahier he evoked his childhood as poverty-stricken and squalid, his family was part of the island&#x27;s small, black middle class.&#x27; His family moved to the capital of Martinique, Fort-de-France, in order for Césaire to attend the only secondary school on the island, Lycée Victor Schœlcher. He believed that he was of Igbo descent, and thought of his first name &quot;Aimé&quot; as a retention of an Igbo name; though the name is of French origin, ultimately from the Old French word &quot;amée&quot;, meaning beloved, its pronunciation is similar to the Igbo , which forms the basis for many Igbo given names. Césaire traveled to Paris to attend the Lycée Louis-le-Grand on an educational scholarship. In Paris, he passed the entrance exam for the École Normale Supérieure in 1935 and created the literary review &quot;L&#x27;Étudiant noir&quot; (&quot;The Black Student&quot;) with Léopold Sédar Senghor and Léon Damas. Manifestos by these three students in its third number (May–June 1935) initiated the Négritude movement later substantial in both pan-Africanist theory and the actual decolonization of the French Empire in Africa. In 1934 Césaire was invited to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia by his friend Petar Guberina where in Šibenik he started writing his poem &quot;Notebook of a Return to the Native Land&quot;, which was one of the first expressions of the concept of Négritude. Upon returning home to Martinique in 1936, Césaire began work on his long poem &quot;Cahier d&#x27;un retour au pays natal (Notebook of a Return to the Native Land)&quot;, a poetic exploration of Caribbean life and cultural complexities in the New World.

Césaire married fellow Martinican student Suzanne Roussi in 1937. Together they moved back to Martinique in 1939 with their young son. Césaire became a teacher at the Lycée Schoelcher in Fort-de-France, where he taught Frantz Fanon, becoming an influence on Frantz Fanon&#x27;s intellectual development and ideas. Césaire also served as an inspiration for, but did not teach, writer Édouard Glissant.

==World War II==

The years of World War II were a period of increased literary and intellectual engagement for the Césaires. In 1941, Aimé Césaire and Suzanne Roussi founded the literary review &quot;Tropiques&quot;, with the help of other Martinican intellectuals such as René Ménil and Aristide Maugée, in order to challenge the cultural status quo and alienation that characterized Martinican identity at the time. In this sense, according to Ursula Heise, the publications of the French botanist Henri Stehlé in &quot;Tropiques&quot; in the early 1940s, concerning the Martinican flora, and &quot;the invocations of Césaire to the Antillean ecology operate as indices of a racial and cultural authenticity which is distinguished from European identity...&quot;. During an interview granted in 1978, Césaire explains that his aim for including these articles in &quot;Tropiques&quot; was &quot;to allow Martinique to refocus&quot; and &quot;to lead Martinicans to reflect&quot; on their close environment. Despite instances of censorship, Césaire continued to advocate for Martinican cultural identity. He also became close to French surrealist poet André Breton, who spent time in Martinique during the war. The two had met in 1940, and Breton later championed Césaire&#x27;s work.

In 1947, his book-length poem &quot;Cahier d&#x27;un retour au pays natal&quot;, which had first appeared in the Parisian periodical &quot;Volontés&quot; in 1939 after rejection by a French book publisher, was published. The book mixes poetry and prose to express Césaire&#x27;s thoughts on the cultural identity of black Africans in a colonial setting. Breton contributed a laudatory introduction to this 1947 edition, saying that the &quot;poem is nothing less than the greatest lyrical monument of our times.&quot; When asked by René Depestre about his writing style, Césaire replied by saying that &quot;Surrealism provided me with what I had been confusedly searching for.&quot;

==Political career==
In 1945, with the support of the French Communist Party (PCF), Césaire was elected mayor of Fort-de-France and deputy to the French National Assembly for Martinique. He managed to get a law addressing departmentalization approved unanimously on 19 March 1946. While departmentalization was implemented in 1946, the status did not bring many meaningful changes to the people of Martinique.

Like many left-wing intellectuals in 1930s and 1940s France, Césaire looked toward the Soviet Union as a source of progress, virtue, and human rights. He later grew disillusioned with the Soviet Union after the 1956 suppression of the Hungarian Revolution. He announced his resignation from the PCF in a text entitled &quot;Lettre à Maurice Thorez&quot; (Letter to Maurice Thorez). In 1958 Césaire founded the Parti Progressiste Martiniquais. Césaire and the Parti Progressiste Martiniquais remained influential in Martinique&#x27;s politics during the latter half of the 20th century. Césaire declined to renew his mandate as deputy in the National Assembly in 1993, after a 47-year continuous term.

His writings during this period reflect his passion for civic and social engagement. He wrote &quot;Discours sur le colonialisme&quot; (&quot;Discourse on Colonialism&quot;), a critique of European colonial practices and attitudes that was republished in the French review &quot;Présence Africaine&quot; in 1955 (English translation 1957). In 1960, he published &quot;Toussaint Louverture&quot;, based on the life of the Haitian revolutionary. In 1969, he published the first version of &quot;Une Tempête&quot;, an adaptation of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot; with themes resonating with a black audience.

Césaire served as President of the Regional Council of Martinique from 1983 to 1988. He retired from politics in 2001.

==Later life==
In 2006, he refused to meet the leader of the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP), Nicolas Sarkozy, a potential contender at the time for the 2007 presidential election, because the UMP had voted for the 2005 French law on colonialism. This law required teachers and textbooks to &quot;acknowledge and recognize in particular the positive role of the French presence abroad, especially in North Africa&quot;, a law criticized by opponents for portraying a positive role of colonialism and French presence abroad, especially during the Algerian War. President Jacques Chirac finally had the controversial law repealed.

On 9 April 2008, Césaire had serious heart troubles and was admitted to Pierre Zobda Quitman hospital in Fort-de-France. He died on 17 April 2008.

Césaire was accorded the honor of a state funeral, held at the Stade de Dillon in Fort-de-France on 20 April. French President Nicolas Sarkozy was present but did not make a speech. The honor of making the funeral oration was left to his longtime friend Pierre Aliker, who had served for many years as deputy mayor under Césaire.

==Legacy==
Martinique&#x27;s airport at Le Lamentin was renamed Martinique Aimé Césaire International Airport on 15 January 2007.
A national commemoration ceremony was held on 6 April 2011, as a plaque in Césaire&#x27;s name was inaugurated in the Panthéon in Paris. He was also proclaimed as a national hero in Martinique.

Césaire&#x27;s influence has been recognized in poetry from his era and in later works. Most notably, his relation to Frantz Fanon, famed author of &quot;Black Skin, White Masks&quot;, as mentor and inspiration is tangible. Fanon&#x27;s personal testimony in &quot;Black Skin, White Masks&quot; explains the &quot;liberating effect of Césaire’s word and action&quot; that he felt in traversing the changing colonial landscape. More generally, Césaire&#x27;s works conceptualized African unity and black culture in ways that allowed for the creation of black spaces where there previously were none, from the establishment of several literary journals to his reworking of Caliban&#x27;s speech from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot;. Césaire&#x27;s works have been described as significant contributions to postcolonial literature in France, its former colonies, and the Caribbean. In 2021, the Musée de l&#x27;Homme for its &quot;Portraits de France&quot; exhibition paid tribute to Aimé Césaire through a work by the artist Hom Nguyen.

====&quot;Discourse on Colonialism&quot;====

Césaire&#x27;s &quot;Discourse on Colonialism&quot; challenges the narrative of the colonizer and the colonized. This text criticizes the hypocrisy of justifying colonization with the equation &quot;Christianity=civilized, paganism=savagery&quot; comparing white colonizers to &quot;savages&quot;. Césaire writes that &quot;no one colonizes innocently, that no one colonizes with impunity either&quot; concluding that &quot;a nation which colonizes, that a civilization which justifies colonization - and therefore force - is already a sick civilization&quot;. He condemns the colonizers, saying that though the men may not be inherently bad, the practice of colonization ruins them.

Césaire&#x27;s text intertwines slavery, imperialism, capitalism, republicanism, and modernism, stating that they were linked together and influenced one another in undeniable ways. Importantly, all of those oppressive forces came together to hurt the colonized and empower the colonizer. This position was considered radical at the time.

Césaire continues to deconstruct the colonizer, and ultimately concludes that by colonizing those white men often lose touch with who they were, and become brutalized into hidden instincts that result in the rape, torture, and race hatred that they put onto the people they colonize. He also examines the effects colonialism has on the colonized, stating that &quot;colonization = &#x27;thing-ification&#x27;&quot;, where because the colonizers are able to &quot;other&quot; the colonized, they can justify the means by which they colonize.

The text also continuously references Nazism, blaming the barbarism of colonialism and how whitewashed and accepted the tradition, for Hitler&#x27;s rise to power. He says that Hitler lives within and is the demon of &quot;the very distinguished, very humanistic, very Christian bourgeois of the twentieth century.&quot; Particularly, Césaire argues that Nazism was not an exception or singular event in European history; rather, the natural progression of a civilization that justified colonization without &quot;perceiving the dangers involved in proceeding towards savagery.&quot; Césaire compared colonial violence to Nazism, arguing: &quot;they tolerated that Nazism before it was inflicted on them, they absolved it, shut their eyes to it, legitimized it, because, until then, it had been applied only to non-European peoples.&quot;

Césaire&#x27;s wishes for post-war Europe centered around decolonization, arguing that decolonization was the way forward for Europe out of &quot;the binarism of capitalism/communism.&quot; Césaire believed that the only possible redemption for Europe’s dark path which had led to Nazism was through interactions with the &quot;Third World&quot;. Decolonization offered an alternative to the dual negatives of capitalism and communism, employing pluralism as a way to usher in a new, more tolerant Europe. He was critical of neo-imperialism and US capitalism, and in many ways his fearful vision of the future has come to fruition today. Critiques of French universalism were also apparent in the text, particularly citing the issues that universalism caused for the departmentalization of Martinique of which Césaire was the main propagator. Departmentalization was an important goal for Césaire both in his texts and in his political career.

Césaire originally wrote his text in French in 1950, but later worked with Joan Pinkham to translate it to English. The translated version was published in 1972.

<text>The McTickles was a British gag-a-day comic strip in the British comic book magazine &quot;The Beano&quot;. It was drawn by Vic Neill and ran from 1971 to 1974.

==Concept==

Chief Jock and his highland clan fought a comic war of attrition against their rivals the McNasties, while avoiding the pranks played on them by the &quot;McHaggises&quot;, small round animals with a similar shape to a haggis and with long noses and thistles for ears. Some McHaggises had legs of different length on opposite sides of their bodies, allowing them to remain horizontal while walking around the sides of mountains. The many types of &#x27;McHaggises&#x27; included the Spiky Hedgehoggis, the Fiery McHaggis, the Roller McHaggis, and many others (This is in fact a common joke used by Scottish people when &quot;explaining&quot; the haggis to uninitiated visitors.) Another recurring comic device was to prefix &quot;Mc&quot; to important words and onomatopoeia. For example, if someone fired a gun, the sound would be written &quot;McBang&quot;.The leader of The McTickles was named Chief Jock and the other Mctickles were Morag (Stroppy middle-aged woman), Murdo who had a long beard, Nickol who was one of the younger clan members, Donald who is also one of the younger clan members and some others who were never named.

==History==

After four years the strip was replaced by another Scottish-highland themed strip, &quot;Wee Ben Nevis&quot;, also drawn by Neill.</text><links>

<doc id="318339" wikidata="Q118930138" url="?curid=318339" title="Wee Ben Nevis">
<text>Wee Ben Nevis was a British gag-a-day comic, published in the comic book magazine &quot;The Beano&quot;, first appearing in issue 1678, dated 14 September 1974, and continuing until 7 May 1977. It was drawn by Vic Neill, and replaced &quot;The McTickles&quot;, another Scottish themed strip by the same artist.

==Concept==
Wee Ben Nevis was a fictional Scottish Highlands boy of superhuman strength. In the first storyline, Wee Ben is sent by his father (Big Ben Nevis) to Pudding College in England. On arriving, he meets the headmaster Prof. Egwell Fryd, who instructs him to &quot;tidy up the classroom&quot;. Unfortunately, Wee Ben&#x27;s idea of &quot;tidying up&quot; involves stuffing all the other students into cupboards. For the next few years, he brought chaos to staff and students alike. Much of the humour stemmed from the fact that Wee Ben never realised (or at least never anticipated) his own strength.

His name is a pun on the Scottish mountain Ben Nevis.

Auberon Waugh described the feature as having &quot;strong undertones of Scottish Nationalism by its untrue suggestion that Scotsmen have superhuman strength despite their diminutive stature&quot;.

<text>The Lugii (or &quot;Lugi&quot;, &quot;Lygii&quot;, &quot;Ligii&quot;, &quot;Lugiones&quot;, &quot;Lygians&quot;, &quot;Ligians&quot;, &quot;Lugians&quot;, or &quot;Lougoi&quot;) were a group of tribes mentioned by Roman authors living in ca. 100 BC–300 AD in Central Europe, north of the Sudetes mountains in the basin of upper Oder and Vistula rivers, covering most of modern southern and middle Poland (regions of Silesia, Greater Poland, Mazovia and Lesser Poland). 

Most archaeologists identify the Lugians with the Przeworsk culture, which is also associated with the Vandals, and it has been suggested that the Lugians and Vandals may have been closely related or even the same. While this culture was strongly Celtic-influenced in early Roman times, the Lugii are also sometimes regarded as Germanic, like the Vandals. 

They played an important role on the middle part of the Amber Road from Sambia at the Baltic Sea to the provinces of Roman Empire: Pannonia, Noricum and Raetia. The Lugii should not be confused with a tribe of the same name, usually spelled as &quot;Lugi&quot;, that inhabited the southern part of Sutherland in Scotland. The Lugii have been identified by many modern historians as the same people as the Vandals, with whom they must certainly have been strongly linked during Roman times.

== Etymology ==
The etymology of the name &quot;Lugii&quot; is uncertain. It could be related to the Celtic root &quot;*leug-&quot; (&#x27;swamp&#x27;), &quot;*lugiyo-&quot; (&#x27;oath&#x27;; cf. Gaulish &quot;luge&quot;, &#x27;by the oath&#x27;, OIr. &quot;luige&quot; &#x27;oath&#x27;), *&quot;lugo&quot;- (&#x27;black&#x27;, cf. Ir. &quot;loch&quot;), or possibly to the name of the god &quot;Lug&quot;.

==History==
The Lugii are first mentioned in Strabo&#x27;s &quot;Geographica&quot;. He writes that the Lugians were &quot;a great people&quot; and—together with other peoples like Semnones, Lombards and the otherwise unknown Zumi, Butones, Mugilones and Sibini—were part of a federation subjected to the rule of Maroboduus, ruler of the Marcomanni with their centre in modern Bohemia 9 BC–19 AD. In 19 AD Maroboduus was overthrown with the help of Arminius of the Cherusci.

The Lugii are not mentioned at all by Pliny the Elder, who instead mentions the Vandilii living in the same area as one of the most important peoples of Germania, including the tribes Burgundiones, Varines, Charines and Gutones.

The next mention of Lugii are the times of the Roman emperor Claudius (41–54). According to Tacitus&#x27;s &quot;Annales,&quot; in 50 &#x27;a great multitude&#x27; of Lugians and Hermunduri, led by the Hermundurian Vibilius, took part in the fall of Vannius, who the Romans had imposed as a ruler to replace Maroboduus. In the book &quot;Germania&quot; (43:3), Tacitus mentions the name &quot;Vandilii&quot; as a &quot;genuine and ancient name&quot;, but does not mention the Vandilii in the list of peoples at all. Tacitus however describes the Lugii, writing that they were divided into many tribes (&#x27;civitates&#x27;), of which he mentions the five most powerful: Harii, Helveconae, Manimi, Helisii and Nahanarvali. 

The next information about the Lugians comes from Cassius Dio&#x27;s work &quot;Roman History&quot;, in which he mentions events of 91–92 during the reign of emperor Domitian. The Lugii allied themselves with the Romans and asked them for help against some of the Suebi. Domitian sent 100 horsemen to support the Lugians. It is not known if these horsemen really arrived at their destination; if they did, it would be the first recorded presence of Roman soldiers on what is now Poland. The 12th century Chronica Polonorum by Wincenty Kadlubek mentions the alliance between the Lugii and the Romans.

Ptolemy mentions the Lugi Omani (Λοῦγοι οἱ Ὀμανοί), the Lugi Diduni (Λοῦγοι οἱ Διδοῦνοι) and the Lugi Buri (Λοῦγοι οἱ Βοῦροι) located on or near the upper Vistula in Germania Magna in what is now south Poland (Book 2, Chapter 10, 4th map of Europe). Ptolemy does not mention the Vandals at all. The Buri, who according to Ptolemy were part of the Lugians, (Tacitus treated them separately, and as Suebian in language) took an important role during the Marcomannic Wars (166–180): the Romans were forced to organize a separate military campaign against them called &#x27;Expeditio Burica&#x27; in 182-183 during the reign of emperor Commodus.

The later history of the Lugians is uncertain, but some historians assume that the Lugians can be identified with the &#x27;Longiones&#x27; tribe mentioned in Zosimus&#x27;s &quot;New History&quot; (&quot;Historia Nova&quot;), as being defeated by the Emperor Probus in year 279 in the province of Raetia near the Lygis river (usually identified with Lech river in modern Austria and Bavaria). Another mention might be a great people of &#x27;Lupiones-Sarmatae&#x27; shown on the Latin map Tabula Peutingeriana generally dated to 2nd-4th century AD.

The Lugii were probably completely absorbed into the Vandals by the 3rd century. While the two peoples are located by Roman authors as living in the same region, they are never mentioned simultaneously. According to John Anderson, the &quot;Lugii and Vandilii are designations of the same tribal group, the latter an extended ethnic name, the former probably a cult-title.&quot; Herwig Wolfram notes that &quot;In all likelihood the Lugians and the Vandals were one cultic community that lived in the same region of the Oder in Silesia, where it was first under Celtic and then under Germanic domination.&quot;

<text>Tylopoda (meaning &quot;calloused foot&quot;) is a suborder of terrestrial herbivorous even-toed ungulates belonging to the order Artiodactyla. They are found in the wild in their native ranges of South America and Asia, while Australian feral camels are introduced. The group has a long fossil history in North America and Eurasia. Tylopoda appeared during the Eocene around 50 million years ago.

Tylopoda has only one extant family, Camelidae, which includes camels, llamas, guanacos, alpacas and vicuñas. This group was much more diverse in the past, containing a number of extinct families in addition to the ancestors of living camelids (see below).

Tylopods are not ruminants.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
Tylopoda was named by Illiger (1811) and considered monophyletic by Matthew (1908). It was treated as an unranked clade by Matthew (1908) and as a suborder by Carroll (1988), Ursing et al. (2000) and Whistler and Webb (2005). It was assigned to Ruminantia by Matthew (1908); to Artiodactyla by Flower (1883) and Carroll (1988); to Neoselenodontia by Whistler and Webb (2005); and to Cetartiodactyla by Ursing et al. (2000) and by Agnarsson and May-Collado (2008).

The main problem with circumscription of Tylopoda is that the extensive fossil record of camel-like mammals has not yet been thoroughly examined from a cladistic standpoint. Tylopoda is a highly distinctive lineage among the artiodactyls, but its exact relationships are somewhat elusive because the six living species are all closely related and can be considered &quot;living fossils&quot;, the sole surviving lineage of a prehistorically wildly successful radiation. More recent studies suggest that tylopods are not as closely related to ruminants as traditionally believed, expressed in cladogram form as:

Tylopoda are extremely conservative in their lifestyle and (like ruminants) seem to have occupied the same ecological niche since their origin over 40 million years ago. Thus, it seems that the previous assumption of a close relationship between Tylopoda and ruminants is simply because all other close relatives (whales, pigs etc.) are so divergent in their adaptations as to have obscured most indications of relationship, or at least those visible to phenetic analyses. However, the rather basal position that Tylopoda appears to have among the even-toed ungulates and relatives means that the oldest members of this lineage are still morphologically very primitive and hard to distinguish from the ancestors of related lineages. The first major modern and comprehensive analysis of the problem (in 2009) supported this; while some taxa traditionally considered Tylopoda could be confirmed to belong to this suborder (and a few refuted), the delimitation of this group is still very much disputed despite (or because of) an extensive fossil record.
The taxa currently assigned (with some reliability) to Tylopoda are:

Basal and &quot;incertae sedis&quot;
* Genus †&quot;Gobiohyus&quot;?
* Family †Homacodontidae
Superfamily Cameloidea
* Family †Oromerycidae
* Family Camelidae
Superfamily †Merycoidodontoidea (=Oreodontoidea)
* Family †&quot;Agriochoeridae&quot; (paraphyletic)
* Family †Merycoidodontidae
===Disputed Tylopoda===
Several additional prehistoric (cet)artiodactyl taxa are sometimes assigned to the Tylopoda, but other authors consider them &quot;incertae sedis&quot; or basal lineages among the (Cet)artiodactyla or as more closely related to other artiodactyl groups like ruminants:
* Family †Antiacodontidae
* Family †Choeropotamidae (= Haplobunodontidae)
* Family †&quot;Diacodexeidae&quot; (paraphyletic)
* Family †Leptochoeridae

* Family †Anoplotheriidae
* Family †Cainotheriidae
* Family †Xiphodontidae
Some studies have considered Protoceratidae closely related to Tylopoda, but others have considered them more closely related to the ruminants.

<text>Quo Vadis: A Narrative of the Time of Nero () is a historical novel written by Henryk Sienkiewicz in Polish.

The novel &quot;Quo Vadis&quot; tells of a love that develops between a young Christian woman, Lygia (Ligia in Polish), and Marcus Vinicius, a Roman patrician. It takes place in the city of Rome under the rule of emperor Nero, AD 64.

Sienkiewicz studied the Roman Empire extensively before writing the novel, with the aim of getting historical details correct. Consequently, several historical figures appear in the book. As a whole, the novel carries a pro-Christian message.

It was first published in instalments in the &quot;Gazeta Polska&quot; between 26 March 1895 and 29 February 1896, as well as in two other journals, &quot;Czas&quot; and &quot;Dziennik Poznański&quot;, starting two and three days later. It was published in book form in 1896 and has been translated into more than 50 languages. The novel contributed to Sienkiewicz&#x27;s Nobel Prize in Literature in 1905.

Several movies have been based on &quot;Quo Vadis&quot;, including two Italian silent films in 1913 and 1924, a Hollywood production in 1951, a 1985 miniseries directed by Franco Rossi, and a 2001 adaptation by Jerzy Kawalerowicz.

In May 2024, a copy of the novel in the author&#x27;s own hand was presented at a permanent exhibition in the Palace of the Commonwealth in Warsaw.

==Synopsis==
A young Roman patrician, Marcus Vinicius, falls in love with Lygia, a barbarian hostage being raised in the house of the retired general Aulus Plautius. Vinicius&#x27; courtier uncle Petronius uses his influence with the Emperor Nero to have Lygia placed in Vinicius&#x27; custody, but first, Nero forces her to appear at a feast on the Palatine Hill. Secretly a Christian after having been converted by Plautius&#x27; wife Pomponia Graecina, Lygia is appalled by the degenerate Roman court. She is rescued by her fellow Christians while being escorted to Vinicius&#x27; house the following day, and disappears.

Petronius takes pity on the desolate Vinicius, and hires cunning Greek philosopher Chilo Chilonis to help him find Lygia. Chilo soon establishes that Lygia was Christian, and goes undercover in the Christian community in Rome to find her. When he tells Vinicius that the entire Christian community is going to meet at night outside the city to hear the Apostle Peter, Vinicius insists on attending the meeting himself the in hope of seeing Lygia there. At the meeting, a disguised Vinicius is strangely touched by Peter&#x27;s words, but forgets everything when he sees Lygia. He traces Lygia to her hiding place in Transtiber Rome, but is stopped and severely wounded by her barbarian bodyguard Ursus when he goes in to kidnap her.

Instead of killing Vinicius, Lygia and her Christian friends take him in and nurse him back to health. At this point, Lygia falls in love with him, and confides in the Apostle Paul. He tells her that she cannot marry a non-Christian, so she leaves Vinicius&#x27; bedside and disappears a second time.

After returning to health, Vinicius is a changed man. He starts treating his slaves with more kindness, and rejects the advances of the depraved empress Poppaea Sabina. When Chilo brings him information of Lygia&#x27;s new hiding place and advises him to surround the house with soldiers, Vinicius has him whipped. Chilo swears revenge, while Vinicius goes to Lygia&#x27;s hiding place alone. After promising Lygia&#x27;s guardians, the Apostles Peter and Paul, to convert, he is engaged to Lygia with their blessing.

Emperor Nero and his court, including Vinicius, go to Antium for recreation. Nero is composing a poem about the burning of Troy, and expresses regret at never having seen a real city burning. Later, the courtiers are shocked when news comes that Rome is aflame. Vinicius rides back to Rome to save Lygia, and Peter baptizes him on the spot after he rescues Lygia and him from the flames.

When Nero returns to Rome and sings his poem about Troy in public, the masses accuse him of igniting the fire. Nero&#x27;s advisors decide they need a scapegoat. The Prefect of the Praetorian Guard, Tigellinus, suggests the Christians. The idea has been given to him by Chilo, still desperate for revenge on Vinicius after his whipping. Vinicius&#x27; uncle Petronius protests, but the empress Poppaea—still nursing a grudge against Vinicius for spurning her advances—overrules him.

Chilo divulges the Christians&#x27; hiding place to the authorities, and many of the are arrested, including Lygia. Nero has planned a series of games in the arena, at which the Christians will be butchered in &quot;revenge&quot; for the fire. Even the Roman mob is shocked, though, by the cruelty of the exhibitions&#x27; in the penultimate show, Christians are set alight on crosses to illuminate a luxurious feast open to the Roman public. Chilo is so appalled by the scene that he repents and publicly accuses Nero of igniting the fire. As the court scatters, Paul emerges from the shadows and promises Chilo salvation if he truly repents. This gives Chilo the courage to die bravely in the arena the following day, after refusing to retract his accusation.

Meanwhile, Lygia and her bodyguard Ursus have been kept for the final show, in which they are exposed to an aurochs in the arena, but when Ursus manages to break the animal&#x27;s neck, the crowd is impressed and forces Nero to spare the two. She is then married to Vinicius, and the two move away to the latter&#x27;s mansion in Sicily, where they live openly as Christians.

The rest of the novel relates the historical events of Peter&#x27;s martyrdom (&quot;Quo vadis, Domine?&quot;), Petronius&#x27; suicide in the aftermath of the Pisonian conspiracy, and concludes with an account of Nero&#x27;s ultimate death based on Suetonius.

==Characters==
===Fictional===
* Marcus Vinicius (son of the historical Marcus Vinicius), a military tribune and Roman patrician who recently returned to Rome. On arrival, he meets and falls in love with Lygia. He seeks the counsel of his uncle Petronius to find a way to possess her.

* Callina usually known as Lygia (Ligia in some translations), the daughter of a deceased king of the Lugii, a barbarian tribe (hence her nickname). Lygia is technically a hostage of the Senate and people of Rome, and was forgotten years ago by her own people. A great beauty, she has converted to Christianity, but her religion is originally unknown to Marcus.
* Eunice household slave of Petronius. Eunice is a beautiful young Greek woman who has fallen in love with her master, although he is initially unaware of her devotion.
* Chilon Chilonides a charlatan and a private investigator. He is hired by Marcus to find Lygia. This character is severely reduced in the 1951 film and the 1985 miniseries, but in the novel itself, as well as in the Polish miniseries of 2001, Chilon is a major figure as doublecrossing traitor. His end is clearly inspired by Saint Dismas.
* Ursus the bodyguard of Lygia. As a fellow tribesman, he served her late mother, and he is strongly devoted to Lygia. As a Christian, Ursus struggles to follow the religion&#x27;s peaceful teachings, given his great strength and barbarian mindset.
* Crispus a Christian zealot who verges on fanaticism.

===Historical===
* Gaius Petronius titled the &quot;arbiter of elegance,&quot; former governor of Bithynia. Petronius is a member of Nero&#x27;s court who uses his wit to flatter and mock him at the same time. He is loved by the Roman mob for his liberal attitudes. Somewhat amoral and a bit lazy, he tries to help his nephew, but his cunning plan is thwarted by Lygia&#x27;s Christian friends.
* Nero Emperor of Rome, portrayed as incompetent, petty, cruel, and subject to manipulation by his courtiers. He listens most intently to flatterers and fools. The novel does indicate, though, that the grossly exaggerating flatteries concerning his abilities as a poet actually have some basis in fact.
* Tigellinus the prefect of the feared Praetorian Guard. He is a rival of Petronius for Nero&#x27;s favour, and he incites Nero into committing acts of great cruelty.
* Poppaea Sabina the wife of Nero. She passionately envies and hates Lygia.
* Acte an Imperial slave and former mistress of Nero. Nero has grown tired of her and now mostly ignores her, but she still loves him. She studies the Christian faith, but does not consider herself worthy of full conversion. In the 1951 film, it is she who helps Nero commit suicide.
* Seneca Nero&#x27;s adviser.
* Aulus Plautius a respected retired Roman general who commanded the invasion of Britain. Aulus seems unaware (or simply unwilling to know) that Pomponia, his wife, and Lygia, his adoptive daughter, profess the Christian religion.
* Pomponia Graecina a Christian convert. Dignified and much respected, Pomponia and Aulus are Lygia&#x27;s adoptive parents, but they are unable to legalize her status. According to Roman law Lygia is still a hostage of the Roman state (i.e., of the Emperor), but she is cared for by the elderly couple.
* Peter the Apostle a weary and aged man with the task of preaching Christ&#x27;s message. He is amazed by the power of Rome and the vices of Emperor Nero, whom he names the Beast. Sometimes Peter doubts that he will be able to plant and protect the &quot;good seed&quot; of Christianity.
* Paul of Tarsus takes a personal interest in converting Marcus.
* Galba a Roman Emperor after Nero.
* Epaphroditus a courtier who helps Nero commit suicide.

==Origin of the term==
&quot;Quo vadis, Domine?&quot; is Latin for &quot;Where are you going, Lord?&quot; and appears in Chapter 69 of the novel in a retelling of a story from the apocryphal Acts of Peter, in which Peter flees Rome, but on his way meets Jesus and asks him why he is going to Rome. Jesus says, &quot;If thou desertest my people, I am going to Rome to be crucified a second time&quot;, which shames Peter into going back to Rome to accept martyrdom.

==Historical events==

Sienkiewicz alludes to several historical events and merges them in his novel, but some of them are of doubtful authenticity.
* In AD 57, Pomponia was indeed charged with practising a &quot;foreign superstition&quot;, usually understood to mean conversion to Christianity. Nevertheless, the religion itself is not clearly identified. According to ancient Roman tradition, she was tried in a family court by her own husband Aulus (the &quot;pater familias&quot;), to be subsequently acquitted. However, inscriptions in the catacombs of Saint Callistus in Rome suggest that members of Graecina&#x27;s family were indeed Christians.
* The rumor that Vespasian fell asleep during a song sung by Nero is recorded by Suetonius in the &quot;Lives of the Twelve Caesars&quot;.
* The death of Claudia Augusta, sole child of Nero, in AD 63.
* The Great Fire of Rome in AD 64 in the novel is started by orders of Nero. No hard evidence to support this has been found, and fires were very common in Rome at the time. In Chapter 50, senior Jewish community leaders advise Nero to blame the fires on Christians; no historical record of this exists, either. The fire opens space in the city for Nero&#x27;s palatial complex, a massive villa with lush artificial landscapes and a 30-meter-tall sculpture of the emperor, as well as an ambitious urban planning program involving the creation of buildings decorated with ornate porticos and the widening of the streets (the urban renewal was carried out only after Nero&#x27;s death).
* The suicide of Petronius clearly is based on the account of Tacitus.

==Similarities with Barrett play==
Playwright-actor-manager Wilson Barrett produced his successful play &quot;The Sign of the Cross&quot; in the same year as publication of &quot;Quo Vadis?&quot; started. The play was first performed 28 March 1895. Several elements in the play strongly resemble those in &quot;Quo Vadis&quot;. In both, a Roman soldier named Marcus falls in love with a Christian woman and wishes to &quot;possess&quot; her. (In the novel, her name is Lygia; in the play she is Mercia.) Nero, Tigellinus, and Poppea are major characters in both the play and novel, and in both, Poppea lusts after Marcus. Petronius, however, does not appear in &quot;The Sign of the Cross&quot;, and the ending of the play diverges from that of &quot;Quo Vadis&quot;.

==Adaptations==
=== Theatre ===
Stanislaus Stange adapted the novel into a stage play of the same name which premiered in Chicago at McVicker&#x27;s Theater&#x27;s on 13 December 1899. It was later produced the following year on Broadway by F. C. Whitney in a production using music by composer Julian Edwards. The play was also staged at the West End&#x27;s Adelphi Theatre in 1900.

Jeannette Leonard Gilder also adapted the novel into a stage play of the same name which was also staged on Broadway in the year 1900 at the Herald Square Theatre.

=== Cinema ===
Film versions of the novel were produced in
* 1901
* 1910 &quot;Au temps des premiers chrétiens&quot; by André Calmettes 
* 1913
* 1924
* 1951 version directed by Mervyn LeRoy was nominated for eight Academy Awards.

=== Television ===
The novel was also the basis for a 1985 mini-series starring Klaus Maria Brandauer as Nero and a 2001 Polish mini-series directed by Jerzy Kawalerowicz.

=== Others ===
It was satirized as the quintessential school play gone horribly awry in &quot;Shivering Shakespeare&quot;, a 1930 Little Rascals short by Hal Roach.

Jean Nouguès composed an opera based on the novel to a libretto by Henri Caïn; it was premiered in 1909. Feliks Nowowiejski composed an oratorio based on the novel, performed for the first time in 1907, and then his most popular work.

==Ursus series (1960–1964)==

Following Buddy Baer&#x27;s portrayal of Ursus in the classic 1951 film &quot;Quo Vadis&quot;, Ursus was used as a superhuman Roman-era character who became the protagonist in a series of Italian adventure films made in the early 1960s.

When the Hercules film craze hit in 1959, Italian filmmakers were looking for other muscleman characters similar to Hercules whom they could exploit, resulting in the nine-film Ursus series listed below. Ursus was referred to as a &quot;Son of Hercules&quot; in two of the films when they were dubbed in English (in an attempt to cash in on the then-popular Hercules craze), although in the original Italian films, Ursus had no connection to Hercules whatsoever. In the English-dubbed version of one Ursus film (retitled &quot;Hercules, Prisoner of Evil&quot;), Ursus was referred to throughout the entire film as Hercules.

There were a total of nine Italian films that featured Ursus as the main character, listed below as follows: Italian title/ English translation of the Italian title (American release title);
* &quot;Ursus&quot; / &quot;Ursus&quot; (&quot;Ursus, Son of Hercules&quot;, 1960) a.k.a. &quot;Mighty Ursus&quot;, a.k.a. &quot;Le fureur d&#x27;Hercule&quot;, starring Ed Fury
* &quot;La Vendetta di Ursus&quot; / &quot;The Revenge of Ursus&quot; (&quot;The Vengeance of Ursus&quot;, 1961), starring Samson Burke
* &quot;Ursus e la Ragazza Tartara&quot; / &quot;Ursus and the Tartar Girl&quot; (&quot;Ursus and the Tartar Princess&quot;, 1961) a.k.a. &quot;The Tartar Invasion&quot;, a.k.a. &quot;The Tartar Girl&quot;; starring Joe Robinson, Akim Tamiroff, Yoko Tani, directed by Remigio Del Grosso
* &quot;Ursus Nella Valle dei Leoni&quot; / &quot;Ursus in the Valley of the Lions&quot; (&quot;Valley of the Lions&quot;, 1962) starring Ed Fury, this film revealed the origin story of Ursus

==Recognition==
In the small church of &quot;Domine Quo Vadis&quot;, there is a bronze bust of Henryk Sienkiewicz. It is said that Sienkiewicz was inspired to write his novel &quot;Quo Vadis&quot; while sitting in this church.

<text>Camelids are members of the biological family Camelidae, the only currently living family in the suborder Tylopoda. The seven extant members of this group are: dromedary camels, Bactrian camels, wild Bactrian camels, llamas, alpacas, vicuñas, and guanacos. Camelids are even-toed ungulates classified in the order Artiodactyla, along with species including whales, pigs, deer, cattle, and antelopes.

==Characteristics==
Camelids are large, strictly herbivorous animals with slender necks and long legs. They differ from ruminants in a number of ways. Their dentition show traces of vestigial central incisors in the incisive bone, and the third incisors have developed into canine-like tusks. Camelids also have true canine teeth and tusk-like premolars, which are separated from the molars by a gap. As in ruminants, the upper incisors are largely absent and are replaced by a dental pad consisting of connective tissue covered with epithelium. The musculature of the hind limbs differs from those of other ungulates in that the legs are attached to the body only at the top of the thigh, rather than attached by skin and muscle from the knee upwards. Because of this, camelids have to lie down by resting on their knees with their legs tucked underneath their bodies. They have three-chambered stomachs, rather than four-chambered ones; their upper lips are split in two, with each part separately mobile; and, uniquely among mammals, their red blood cells are elliptical. They also have a unique type of antibodies, which lack the light chain, in addition to the normal antibodies found in other mammals. These so-called heavy-chain antibodies are being used to develop single-domain antibodies with potential pharmaceutical applications.

Camelids do not have hooves; rather, they have two-toed feet with toenails and soft foot pads (Tylopoda is Greek for &quot;padded foot&quot;). Most of the weight of the animal rests on these tough, leathery sole pads. The South American camelids have adapted to the steep and rocky terrain by adjusting the pads on their toes to maintain grip. The surface area of Camels foot pads can increase with increasing velocity in order to reduce pressure on the feet and larger members of the camelid species will usually have larger pad area, which helps to distribute weight across the foot. Many fossil camelids were unguligrade and probably hooved, in contrast to all living species.

Camelids are behaviorally similar in many ways, including their walking gait, in which both legs on the same side are moved simultaneously. While running, camelids engage a unique &quot;running pace gait&quot; in which limbs on the same side move in the same pattern they walk, with both left legs moving and then both right, which ensures that the fore and hind limb will not collide while in fast motion. During this motion, all four limbs momentarily are off the ground at the same time. Consequently, camelids large enough for human beings to ride have a typical swaying motion.

Dromedary camels, bactrian camels, llamas, and alpacas are all induced ovulators.

The three Afro-Asian camel species have developed extensive adaptations to their lives in harsh, near-waterless environments. Wild populations of the Bactrian camel are even able to drink brackish water, and some herds live in nuclear test areas.

Comparative table of the seven extant species in the family Camelidae:
==Evolution==
Camelids are unusual in that their modern distribution is almost the inverse of their area of origin. Camelids first appeared very early in the evolution of the even-toed ungulates, around 50 to 40 million years ago during the middle Eocene, in present-day North America. Among the earliest camelids was the rabbit-sized &quot;Protylopus&quot;, which still had four toes on each foot. By the late Eocene, around 35 million years ago, camelids such as &quot;Poebrotherium&quot; had lost the two lateral toes, and were about the size of a modern goat.

The family diversified and prospered, with the two living tribes, the Camelini and Lamini, diverging in the late early Miocene, about 17 million years ago, but remained restricted to North America until about 6 million years ago, when &quot;Paracamelus&quot; crossed the Bering land bridge into Eurasia, giving rise to the modern camels, and about 3-2 million years ago, when &quot;Hemiauchenia&quot; emigrated into South America (as part of the Great American Interchange), giving rise to the modern llamas. A population of &quot;Paracamelus&quot; continued living in North America and evolved into the high arctic camel, which survived until the middle Pleistocene.

The original camelids of North America remained common until the quite recent geological past, but then disappeared, possibly as a result of hunting or habitat alterations by the earliest human settlers, and possibly as a result of changing environmental conditions after the last ice age, or a combination of these factors. Three species groups survived - the dromedary of northern Africa and southwest Asia; the Bactrian camel of central Asia; and the South American group, which has now diverged into a range of forms that are closely related, but usually classified as four species - llamas, alpacas, guanacos, and vicuñas. Camelids were domesticated by early Andean peoples, and remain in use today.

Fossil camelids show a wider variety than their modern counterparts. One North American genus, &quot;Titanotylopus&quot;, stood 3.5 m at the shoulder, compared with about 2.0 m for the largest modern camelids. Other extinct camelids included small, gazelle-like animals, such as &quot;Stenomylus&quot;. Finally, a number of very tall, giraffe-like camelids were adapted to feeding on leaves from high trees, including such genera as &quot;Aepycamelus&quot; and &quot;Oxydactylus&quot;.

Whether the wild Bactrian camel (&quot;Camelus ferus&quot;) is a distinct species or a subspecies (&quot;C. bactrianus ferus&quot;) is still debated. The divergence date is 0.7 million years ago, long before the start of domestication.

<text>A corona discharge is an electrical discharge caused by the ionization of a fluid such as air surrounding a conductor carrying a high voltage. It represents a local region where the air (or other fluid) has undergone electrical breakdown and become conductive, allowing charge to continuously leak off the conductor into the air. A corona discharge occurs at locations where the strength of the electric field (potential gradient) around a conductor exceeds the dielectric strength of the air. It is often seen as a bluish glow in the air adjacent to pointed metal conductors carrying high voltages, and emits light by the same mechanism as a gas discharge lamp, chemiluminescence. Corona discharges can also happen in weather, such as thunderstorms, where objects like ship masts or airplane wings have a charge significantly different from the air around them (St. Elmo&#x27;s fire).

In many high-voltage applications, corona is an unwanted side effect. Corona discharge from high-voltage electric power transmission lines constitutes an economically significant waste of energy for utilities. In high-voltage equipment like cathode-ray-tube televisions, radio transmitters, X-ray machines, and particle accelerators, the current leakage caused by coronas can constitute an unwanted load on the circuit. In the air, coronas generate gases such as ozone (O3) and nitric oxide (NO), and in turn, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and thus nitric acid (HNO3) if water vapor is present. These gases are corrosive and can degrade and embrittle nearby materials, and are also toxic to humans and the environment.

Corona discharges can often be suppressed by improved insulation, corona rings, and making high-voltage electrodes in smooth rounded shapes. However, controlled corona discharges are used in a variety of processes such as air filtration, photocopiers, and ozone generators.

== Introduction ==

A corona discharge is a process by which a current flows from an electrode with a high potential into a neutral fluid, usually air, by ionizing that fluid so as to create a region of plasma around the electrode. The ions generated eventually pass the charge to nearby areas of lower potential, or recombine to form neutral gas molecules.

When the potential gradient (electric field) is large enough at a point in the fluid, the fluid at that point ionizes and it becomes conductive. If a charged object has a sharp point, the electric field strength around that point will be much higher than elsewhere. Air near the electrode can become ionized (partially conductive), while regions more distant do not. When the air near the point becomes conductive, it has the effect of increasing the apparent size of the conductor. Since the new conductive region is less sharp, the ionization may not extend past this local region. Outside this region of ionization and conductivity, the charged particles slowly find their way to an oppositely charged object and are neutralized.

Along with the similar brush discharge, the corona is often called a &quot;single-electrode discharge&quot;, as opposed to a &quot;two-electrode discharge&quot;—an electric arc. A corona forms only when the conductor is widely enough separated from conductors at the opposite potential that an arc cannot jump between them. If the geometry and gradient are such that the ionized region continues to grow until it reaches another conductor at a lower potential, a low resistance conductive path between the two will be formed, resulting in an electric spark or electric arc, depending upon the source of the electric field. If the source continues to supply current, a spark will evolve into a continuous discharge called an arc.

Corona discharge forms only when the electric field (potential gradient) at the surface of the conductor exceeds a critical value, the dielectric strength or disruptive potential gradient of the fluid. In air at sea level pressure of 101 kPa, the critical value is roughly 30 kV/cm, but this decreases with pressure, therefore, corona discharge is more of a problem at high altitudes. Corona discharge usually forms at highly curved regions on electrodes, such as sharp corners, projecting points, edges of metal surfaces, or small diameter wires. The high curvature causes a high potential gradient at these locations so that the air breaks down and forms plasma there first. On sharp points in the air, corona can start at potentials of 2–6 kV. In order to suppress corona formation, terminals on high-voltage equipment are frequently designed with smooth large-diameter rounded shapes like balls or toruses. Corona rings are often added to insulators of high-voltage transmission lines.

Coronas may be &quot;positive&quot; or &quot;negative&quot;. This is determined by the polarity of the voltage on the highly curved electrode. If the curved electrode is positive with respect to the flat electrode, it has a &quot;positive corona&quot;; if it is negative, it has a &quot;negative corona&quot;. (See below for more details.) The physics of positive and negative coronas are strikingly different. This asymmetry is a result of the great difference in mass between electrons and positively charged ions, with only the electron having the ability to undergo a significant degree of ionizing inelastic collision at common temperatures and pressures.

An important reason for considering coronas is the production of ozone around conductors undergoing corona processes in air. A negative corona generates much more ozone than the corresponding positive corona.

== Applications ==
Corona discharge has a number of commercial and industrial applications:

* Removal of unwanted electric charges from the surface of aircraft in flight and thus avoiding the detrimental effect of uncontrolled electrical discharge pulses on the performance of avionic systems
* Manufacture of ozone
* Sanitization of pool water
* In an electrostatic precipitator, removal of solid pollutants from a waste gas stream, or scrubbing particles from the air in air-conditioning systems
* Photocopying
* Air ionisers
* Production of photons for Kirlian photography to expose photographic film
* EHD thrusters, lifters, and other ionic wind devices
* Nitrogen laser
* Ionization of a gaseous sample for subsequent analysis in a mass spectrometer or an ion mobility spectrometer
* Static charge neutralization, as applied through antistatic devices like ionizing bars
* Refrigeration of electronic devices by forced convection

Coronas can be used to generate charged surfaces, which is an effect used in electrostatic copying (photocopying). They can also be used to remove particulate matter from air streams by first charging the air, and then passing the charged stream through a comb of alternating polarity, to deposit the charged particles onto oppositely charged plates.

The free radicals and ions generated in corona reactions can be used to scrub the air of certain noxious products, through chemical reactions, and can be used to produce ozone.

== Problems ==

Coronas can generate audible and radio-frequency noise, particularly near electric power transmission lines. Therefore, power transmission equipment is designed to minimize the formation of corona discharge.

Corona discharge is generally undesirable in:
* Electric power transmission, where it causes:
** Power loss
** Audible noise
** Electromagnetic interference
** Purple glow
** Ozone production
** Insulation damage
** Possible distress in animals that are sensitive to ultraviolet light
* Electrical components such as transformers, capacitors, electric motors, and generators:
** Corona can progressively damage the insulation inside these devices, leading to equipment failure.
** Elastomer items such as O-rings can suffer ozone cracking.
** Plastic film capacitors operating at mains voltage can suffer progressive loss of capacitance as corona discharges cause local vaporization of the metallization.

In many cases, coronas can be suppressed by corona rings, toroidal devices that serve to spread the electric field over larger areas and decrease the field gradient to below the corona threshold.

== Mechanism ==
Corona discharge occurs when the electric field is strong enough to create a chain reaction; electrons in the air collide with atoms hard enough to ionize them, creating more free electrons that ionize more atoms. The diagrams below illustrate at a microscopic scale the process which creates a corona in the air next to a pointed electrode carrying a high negative voltage with respect to ground. The process is: 
# A neutral atom or molecule, in a region of the strong electric field (such as the high potential gradient near the curved electrode), is ionized by a natural environmental event (for example, being struck by an ultraviolet photon or cosmic ray particle), to create a positive ion and a free electron.&lt;br&gt;
# The electric field accelerates these oppositely charged particles in opposite directions, separating them, preventing their recombination, and imparting kinetic energy to each of them. 
# The electron has a much higher charge/mass ratio and so is accelerated to a higher velocity than the positive ion. It gains enough energy from the field that when it strikes another atom it ionizes it, knocking out another electron, and creating another positive ion. These electrons are accelerated and collide with other atoms, creating further electron/positive-ion pairs, and these electrons collide with more atoms, in a chain reaction process called an &quot;electron avalanche&quot;. Both positive and negative coronas rely on electron avalanches. In a positive corona, all the electrons are attracted inward toward the nearby positive electrode and the ions are repelled outwards. In a negative corona, the ions are attracted inward and the electrons are repelled outwards.&lt;br&gt;
# The glow of the corona is caused by electrons recombining with positive ions to form neutral atoms. When the electron falls back to its original energy level, it releases a photon of light. The photons serve to ionize other atoms, maintaining the creation of electron avalanches.&lt;br&gt;
# At a certain distance from the electrode, the electric field becomes low enough that it no longer imparts enough energy to the electrons to ionize atoms when they collide. This is the outer edge of the corona. Outside this, the ions move through the air without creating new ions. The outward moving ions are attracted to the opposite electrode and eventually reach it and combine with electrons from the electrode to become neutral atoms again, completing the circuit.

Thermodynamically, a corona is a very &quot;nonequilibrium&quot; process, creating a non-thermal plasma. The avalanche mechanism does not release enough energy to heat the gas in the corona region generally and ionize it, as occurs in an electric arc or spark. Only a small number of gas molecules take part in the electron avalanches and are ionized, having energies close to the ionization energy of 1–3 ev, the rest of the surrounding gas is close to ambient temperature.

The onset voltage of corona or corona inception voltage (CIV) can be found with &quot;Peek&#x27;s law&quot; (1929), formulated from empirical observations. Later papers derived more accurate formulas.

== Positive coronas ==

=== Properties ===
A positive corona is manifested as a uniform plasma across the length of a conductor. It can often be seen glowing blue/white, though many of the emissions are in the ultraviolet. The uniformity of the plasma is caused by the homogeneous source of secondary avalanche electrons described in the mechanism section, below. With the same geometry and voltages, it appears a little smaller than the corresponding negative corona, owing to the lack of a non-ionising plasma region between the inner and outer regions.

A positive corona has a much lower density of free electrons compared to a negative corona; perhaps a thousandth of the electron density, and a hundredth of the total number of electrons.
However, the electrons in a positive corona are concentrated close to the surface of the curved conductor, in a region of the high potential gradient (and therefore the electrons have high energy), whereas in a negative corona many of the electrons are in the outer, lower-field areas. Therefore, if electrons are to be used in an application which requires high activation energy, positive coronas may support a greater reaction constant than corresponding negative coronas; though the total number of electrons may be lower, the number of very high energy electrons may be higher.

Coronas are efficient producers of ozone in the air. A positive corona generates much less ozone than the corresponding negative corona, as the reactions which produce ozone are relatively low-energy. Therefore, the greater number of electrons of a negative corona leads to increased production.

Beyond the plasma, in the &quot;unipolar region&quot;, the flow is of low-energy positive ions toward the flat electrode.

=== Mechanism ===
As with a negative corona, a positive corona is initiated by an exogenous ionization event in a region of a high potential gradient. The electrons resulting from the ionization are attracted &quot;toward&quot; the curved electrode, and the positive ions repelled from it. By undergoing inelastic collisions closer and closer to the curved electrode, further molecules are ionized in an electron avalanche.

In a positive corona, secondary electrons, for further avalanches, are generated predominantly in the fluid itself, in the region outside the plasma or avalanche region. They are created by ionization caused by the photons emitted from that plasma in the various de-excitation processes occurring within the plasma after electron collisions, the thermal energy liberated in those collisions creating photons which are radiated into the gas. The electrons resulting from the ionization of a neutral gas molecule are then electrically attracted back toward the curved electrode, attracted &quot;into&quot; the plasma, and so begins the process of creating further avalanches inside the plasma.

== Negative coronas ==

=== Properties ===
A negative corona is manifested in a non-uniform corona, varying according to the surface features and irregularities of the curved conductor. It often appears as tufts of the corona at sharp edges, the number of tufts altering with the strength of the field. The form of negative coronas is a result of its source of secondary avalanche electrons (see below). It appears a little larger than the corresponding positive corona, as electrons are allowed to drift out of the ionizing region, and so the plasma continues some distance beyond it. The total number of electrons and electron density is much greater than in the corresponding positive corona. However, they are of predominantly lower energy, owing to being in a region of lower potential gradient. Therefore, whilst for many reactions, the increased electron density will increase the reaction rate, the lower energy of the electrons will mean that reactions which require higher electron energy may take place at a lower rate.

=== Mechanism ===
Negative coronas are more complex than positive coronas in construction. As with positive coronas, the establishing of a corona begins with an exogenous ionization event generating a primary electron, followed by an electron avalanche.

Electrons ionized from the neutral gas are not useful in sustaining the negative corona process by generating secondary electrons for further avalanches, as the general movement of electrons in a negative corona is outward from the curved electrode. For negative corona, instead, the dominant process generating secondary electrons is the photoelectric effect, from the surface of the electrode itself. The work function of the electrons (the energy required to liberate the electrons from the surface) is considerably lower than the ionization energy of air at standard temperatures and pressures, making it a more liberal source of secondary electrons under these conditions. Again, the source of energy for the electron-liberation is a high-energy photon from an atom within the plasma body relaxing after excitation from an earlier collision. The use of ionized neutral gas as a source of ionization is further diminished in a negative corona by the high-concentration of positive ions clustering around the curved electrode.

Under other conditions, the collision of the positive species with the curved electrode can also cause electron liberation.

The difference, then, between positive and negative coronas, in the matter of the generation of secondary electron avalanches, is that in a positive corona they are generated by the gas surrounding the plasma region, the new secondary electrons travelling inward, whereas in a negative corona they are generated by the curved electrode itself, the new secondary electrons travelling outward.

A further feature of the structure of negative coronas is that as the electrons drift outwards, they encounter neutral molecules and, with electronegative molecules (such as oxygen and water vapor), combine to produce negative ions. These negative ions are then attracted to the positive uncurved electrode, completing the &#x27;circuit&#x27;.

== Electrical wind ==
Ionized gases produced in a corona discharge are accelerated by the electric field, producing a movement of gas or &quot;electrical wind&quot;. The air movement associated with a discharge current of a few hundred microamperes can blow out a small candle flame within about 1 cm of a discharge point. A pinwheel, with radial metal spokes and pointed tips bent to point along the circumference of a circle, can be made to rotate if energized by a corona discharge; the rotation is due to the differential electric attraction between the metal spokes and the space charge shield region that surrounds the tips.

<text>Charles Munch (; born Karl Münch; 26 September 1891 – 6 November 1968) was an Alsatian French symphonic conductor and violinist. Noted for his mastery of the French orchestral repertoire, he was best known as music director of the Boston Symphony Orchestra.

==Life and career==
Munch was born in 1891 in Strasbourg, Alsace. The son of organist and choir director Ernst Münch, he was the fifth of six children. He was the brother of conductor Fritz Münch and the cousin of conductor and composer Hans Münch. Although his first ambition was to be a locomotive engineer, he studied violin at the Strasbourg Conservatory. His father, Ernst, was a professor of organ at the conservatory and performed at the cathedral; he also directed an orchestra with his son Charles in the second violins.

After receiving his diploma in 1912, Charles studied with Carl Flesch in Berlin and Lucien Capet at the Conservatoire de Paris. He was conscripted into the German army in World War I, serving as a sergeant gunner. He was gassed at Péronne and wounded at Verdun. Munch considered that &quot;as an Alsacian and as a musician, [he was] purely and profoundly German, but that [he was] a friend of many countries and first and foremost a musician and a conductor&quot;.

In 1920, Munch became professor of violin at the Strasbourg Conservatory and assistant concertmaster of the Strasbourg Philharmonic Orchestra under Joseph Guy Ropartz, who directed the conservatory. In the early 1920s he was concertmaster for Hermann Abendroth&#x27;s Gürzenich Orchestra in Cologne. He then served as concertmaster of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra under Wilhelm Furtwängler and Bruno Walter from 1926 to 1933.

At the age of 41, Munch made his conducting debut in Paris on 1 November 1932. Munch&#x27;s fiancée, Geneviève Maury, granddaughter of a founder of the Nestlé Chocolate Company, rented the hall and hired the Walther Straram Concerts Orchestra. Munch also studied conducting with Czech conductor Fritz Zweig, who had fled Berlin during his tenure at Berlin&#x27;s Krolloper.

Following this success, Munch conducted the Concerts Siohan, the Lamoureux Orchestra, the new Orchestre Symphonique de Paris, the Biarritz Orchestra (Summer 1933), the Société Philharmonique de Paris (1935 to 1938), and the Orchestre de la Société des concerts du Conservatoire (1937 to 1946). He became known as a champion of Hector Berlioz, and befriended Arthur Honegger, Albert Roussel, and Francis Poulenc. During these years, Munch gave first performances of works by Honegger, Jean Roger-Ducasse, Joseph Guy Ropartz, Roussel, and Florent Schmitt. He became director of the Société Philharmonique de Paris in 1938 and was featured in the French epic Les Enfants du Paradis, filmed (1945) during the German occupation of Paris. For two years, he taught conducting at the École Normale de Musique (from 1937 to 1939). One of his pupils there was also Czech composer-conductor Vítězslava Kaprálová.

Munch remained in France conducting the Conservatoire Orchestra during the German occupation, believing it best to maintain the morale of the French people. He refused conducting engagements in Germany and also refused to perform contemporary German works. He protected members of his orchestra from the Gestapo and contributed from his income to the French Resistance. For this, he received the Légion d&#x27;honneur with the red ribbon in 1945 and the degree of &quot;Commandeur&quot; in 1952.

===Boston Symphony Orchestra===

Munch made his début with the Boston Symphony Orchestra on 27 December 1946. He was its Music Director from 1949 to 1962. Munch was also Director of the Berkshire Music Festival and Berkshire Music Center (Tanglewood) from 1951 through 1962. He led relaxed rehearsals which orchestra members appreciated after the authoritarian Serge Koussevitzky. Among his pupils at Tanglewood was Serge Fournier and the first prize winner of the International Competition of Orchestra Conductors, Seiji Ozawa. Munch also received honorary degrees from Boston College, Boston University, Brandeis University, Harvard University, and the New England Conservatory of Music.

He excelled in the modern French repertoire, especially Claude Debussy and Maurice Ravel, and was considered to be an authoritative performer of Hector Berlioz. However, Munch&#x27;s programs also regularly featured works by composers such as Bach, Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, Schumann, Brahms, and Wagner. His thirteen-year tenure in Boston included 39 world premieres and 58 American first performances, and offered audiences 168 contemporary works. Fourteen of these premieres were works commissioned by the Boston Symphony and the Koussevitzky Music Foundation to celebrate the Orchestra&#x27;s 75th Anniversary in 1956. (A 15th commission was never completed.)

Munch invited former Boston Symphony music director Pierre Monteux to guest conduct, record, and tour with the orchestra after an absence of more than 25 years. Under Munch, guest conductors became an integral part of the Boston Symphony&#x27;s programming, both in Boston and at Tanglewood.

Munch led the Boston Symphony on its first transcontinental tour of the United States in 1953. He became the first conductor to take them on tour overseas: Europe in 1952 and 1956, and East Asia and Australia in 1960. During the 1956 tour, the Boston Symphony was the first American orchestra to perform in the Soviet Union.

The Boston Symphony under Munch made a series of recordings for RCA Victor from 1949 to 1953 in monaural sound and from 1954 to 1962 in both monaural and stereophonic versions.

Selections from Boston Symphony rehearsals under Leonard Bernstein, Koussevitzky, and Munch were broadcast nationally on the NBC Radio Network from 1948–1951. NBC carried portions of the Orchestra&#x27;s performances from 1954–1957. Beginning in 1951, the BSO was broadcast over local radio stations in the Boston area. Starting in 1957, Boston Symphony performances under Munch and guest conductors were disseminated regionally, nationally, and internationally through the Boston Symphony Transcription Trust. Under Munch, the Boston Symphony appeared on television. The first BSO television broadcast was under Bernstein in 1949 at Carnegie Hall.

===Orchestre de Paris===
Munch returned to France and in 1963 became president of the École Normale de Musique. He was also named president of the Guilde française des artistes solistes. During the 1960s, Munch appeared regularly as a guest conductor throughout America, Europe, and Japan. In 1967, at the request of France&#x27;s Minister of Culture, André Malraux, he founded the first full-time salaried French orchestra, the Orchestre de Paris, and conducted its first concert on 14 November 1967. The following year, he died of a heart attack suffered at his hotel in Richmond, Virginia while on an American tour with his new orchestra. His remains were returned to France where he is buried in the Cimetière de Louveciennes. EMI recorded his final sessions, including Ravel&#x27;s &quot;Piano Concerto in G&quot;, with this orchestra, and released them posthumously.

==Books==
In 1955, Oxford University Press published &quot;I Am a Conductor&quot; by Munch in a translation by Leonard Burkat. It was originally issued in 1954 in French as &quot;Je suis chef d&#x27;orchestre&quot;. The work is a collection of Munch&#x27;s thoughts on conducting and the role of a conductor.

D. Kern Holoman wrote Munch&#x27;s first biography in English, &quot;Charles Munch&quot;. It was published by Oxford University Press in 2011.

==Recordings==
Munch&#x27;s discography is extensive, both in Boston on RCA Victor and at his various European posts and guest conducting assignments on various labels, including English Decca, EMI, Nonesuch, Erato and Auvidis-Valois.

He began making records in Paris before the war, for EMI. Munch then made a renowned series of Decca Full Frequency Range Recordings (FFRR) in the late 1940s. After several recordings with the New York Philharmonic for Columbia, Munch began making recordings for RCA Victor soon after his arrival in Boston as Music Director. These included memorable Berlioz, Honegger, Roussel, and Saint-Saëns tapings.

His first stereophonic recording with the Boston Symphony, in Boston&#x27;s Symphony Hall in February 1954, was devoted to a complete version of &quot;The Damnation of Faust&quot; by Hector Berlioz and was made simultaneously in monaural and experimental stereophonic sound, although only the mono recording was released commercially. The stereo tape survives only fragmentarily. The monaural version of this recording was added to the Library of Congress&#x27;s national registry of sound. Among his final recordings in Boston was a 1962 performance of César Franck&#x27;s symphonic poem &quot;Le chasseur maudit&quot;.

Upon Munch&#x27;s return to Paris, he made Erato disks with the Orchestre Lamoureux, and with the Orchestre de Paris he again recorded for EMI. He also made recordings for a number of other companies including Decca/London.

A number of Munch&#x27;s recordings have been available continuously since their original releases, among them Saint-Saëns&#x27;s &quot;Organ&quot; Symphony and Ravel&#x27;s &quot;Daphnis and Chloe.&quot; RCA reissued &quot;Munch Conducts Berlioz&quot; in a multi-disc set, including all of their Munch recordings. BMG/Japan has issued two different editions of Munch&#x27;s RCA Victor recordings on CD, 1998 and 2006. The latter was made up of 41 CDs and encompassed all but a handful of Munch recordings with the Boston Symphony. in 2016, Sony released all of Munch&#x27;s Columbia and RCA Victor recordings including performances by the Boston Symphony Orchestra, New York Philharmonic, and Philadelphia Orchestra. Many of these had never been officially released on compact disc. In 2018, Warner Classics issued a comprehensive CD box set of Munch&#x27;s recordings, drawn from their archives of the labels of the former EMI group. Eloquence Australia released a CD box set of Munch&#x27;s complete DECCA recordings in 2020.

== Television ==
The Boston Symphony appeared on television with Munch locally on WGBH-TV, Boston, and nationally through a syndicated series. NHK broadcast throughout Japan the opening concert of the Boston Symphony&#x27;s tour of Japan in 1960. Munch also appeared on film or television with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the Czech Philharmonic, the Hungarian Radio and Television Orchestra, the Orchestre National de l&#x27;ORTF, and the Orchestre de Radio-Canada. Several of these performances have been issued on DVD.

<text>Charles Munch (born 1945) is an American artist.

Munch and his four brothers and sisters, including his twin sister, were raised and attended public schools in Webster Groves, a suburb of St. Louis, Missouri where he was born. They spent summers in Door County, Wisconsin, where Munch was impressed by the clarity of light and color on the shore of Lake Michigan.

After spending two years at Reed College, Portland, Oregon, and beginning his training as an artist with realist painter Willard Midgette, Munch attended the Portland Art Museum School and the New York Studio School of Drawing, Painting and Sculpture. He returned to Reed College and graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1968, majoring in painting.

Munch apprenticed himself to William Suhr, who was paintings conservator for the Frick Collection in New York City. He worked part-time as a freelance paintings conservator for the next 45 years. In 1970 he and his partner Jane Furchgott began two years of travel, visiting most of the major museums in the United States and western Europe. They finally settled in Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin, where Munch developed a detailed realistic style of painting.

During the course of six months in 1981, Munch transitioned from his realistic paintings to a style that was brightly colored, formally simplified, and emotionally expressive—a blend of elements including early Italian Renaissance, Post-Impressionism, and Pop Art. His distinctive form of representation uses broad outlines and contrasting interior colors to create luminous light and atmosphere. The deceptively simple forms and large areas of clear color in his paintings combine to create unforgettable icons of psychological drama. His subjects vary, but the emphasis is on northwoods landscapes and the animals and people that inhabit them.

Since 1982 Munch has lived on a remote hilltop near Lone Rock, Wisconsin. He has exhibited extensively, including major exhibitions at the Milwaukee Art Museum, The Chicago Cultural Center, The Madison Museum of Contemporary Art, and retrospectives at the Fairfield Gallery, Sturgeon Bay WI, and the Museum of Wisconsin Art, West Bend WI. He has shown regularly at the Tory Folliard Gallery, Milwaukee; the Abel Contemporary Gallery, Stoughton WI .

<text>Yevgeny Aleksandrovich Mravinsky () (19 January 1988) was a Soviet and Russian conductor, pianist, and music pedagogue; he was a professor at Leningrad State Conservatory.

==Biography==
Mravinsky was born in Saint Petersburg. The soprano Yevgeniya Mravina was his aunt. His father, Alexandr Konstantinovich Mravinsky, died in 1918, and in that same year, the young Mravinsky began to work backstage at the Mariinsky Theatre, serving as a ballet répétiteur from 1923 to 1931. After initially studying biology at the university in Leningrad, in 1924 he succeeded in entering the Leningrad Conservatory as a non–fee–paying student thanks to his half-aunt Alexandra Kollontai, who recommended him to the rector, Alexander Glazunov, and the commissar for enlightenment, Anatoly Lunacharsky.

Mravinsky&#x27;s first public conducting appearance was in 1929. Throughout the 1930s, he conducted at the Kirov Ballet and Bolshoi Opera. In September 1938, he won the All-Union Conductors Competition in Moscow.

In 1931, Mravinsky made his debut with the Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra. In October 1938, he was appointed its principal conductor, a post which he held until his death. Under Mravinsky, the Leningrad Philharmonic gained international renown, particularly in performances of Russian music. During World War II, Mravinsky and the orchestra were evacuated to Siberia.

The music of Dmitri Shostakovich was closely associated with Mravinsky, beginning with conducting the world premiere of the composer&#x27;s Fifth Symphony. The conductor would subsequently lead the world premieres of the Sixth, Eighth (which Shostakovich dedicated to Mravinsky), Ninth, Tenth, and Twelfth Symphonies, as well as the &quot;Song of the Forests&quot;, Violin Concerto No. 1, and Cello Concerto No. 1. In 1962, Mravinsky had declined to conduct the premiere of Shostakovich&#x27;s Symphony No. 13, in the wake of the diagnosis of his third wife Inna&#x27;s terminal cancer. This action caused a disruption in the working relationship between Shostakovich and Mravinsky, which included Mravinsky also refusing to conduct the premiere of Shostakovich&#x27;s Cello Concerto No. 2, pleading inadequate time to prepare the work. In the early 1970s, Mravinsky and Shostakovich repaired their working relationship. Of the remaining Shostakovich symphonies that he did not premiere, Mravinsky only performed (and recorded) the Seventh, Eleventh, and Fifteenth.

He also premiered Sergei Prokofiev&#x27;s Sixth Symphony.

Mravinsky made studio recordings from 1938 to 1961, including recording the symphonies of Tchaikovsky for Deutsche Grammophon, first in monaural sound in Vienna, then stereo remakes in London. His issued recordings post-1961 were taken from live concerts. His final recording was of an April 1984 live performance of Shostakovich&#x27;s Symphony No. 12.

In 1946, Mravinsky&#x27;s international career began with tours of Finland and Czechoslovakia at the Prague Spring Festival. Later tours with an orchestra included a June 1956 itinerary to western Europe. Their only appearance in the United Kingdom was in September 1960 at the Edinburgh Festival and the Royal Festival Hall, London. Their first tour to Japan was in May 1973. Their last foreign tour was in 1984, to West Germany.

On 6 March 1987, Mravinsky led his final concert, a program consisting of Schubert&#x27;s Symphony No. 8 and Brahms&#x27; Symphony No. 4. After a prolonged illness, Mravinsky died in Leningrad in 1988 at the age of 84.

Mravinsky was married four times. His first marriage was to Marianna Schwalck (1888–1979), in 1922. His second marriage was to Olga Alexeyevna Karpova (1903-1990), in 1938. Both ended in divorce. His marriage to his third wife, Inna Mikhailovna Serikova (1923-1964), lasted from 1960 until her death. His fourth marriage was to Alexandra Mikhailovna Vavilina (born 1928), from 1967 until his death.

==Conducting style==
Surviving videos show that Mravinsky had a sober appearance on the podium, making simple but clear gestures, often without a baton. The critic James McCarthy said of Mravinsky&#x27;s Tchaikovsky performances:

The Leningrad Philharmonic play like a wild stallion only just held in check by the willpower of its master. Every smallest movement is placed with fierce pride; at any moment it may break into such a frenzied gallop that you hardly know whether to feel exhilarated or terrified.

==Method==
In a 1970s interview on Leningrad Television, when asked how he chose a particular interpretation of the music he conducted, Mravinsky explained that he tried to understand what the composer&#x27;s intention was by immersing himself in the &quot;atmosphere&quot; of the music (he used the term &quot;atmospherization&quot;).

==Recordings==
Mravinsky recorded for the state classical label Melodiya and for Deutsche Grammophon. Additionally, in the 21st century, his recordings were made available by Erato Records and Profil – G Haenssler.

<doc id="318361" wikidata="Q3072372" url="?curid=318361" title="Final Lap">
<text>is a 1987 racing simulation video game developed and published by Namco. Atari Games published the game in the United States in 1988. It was the first game to run on Namco&#x27;s then-new System 2 hardware and is a direct successor to Namco&#x27;s &quot;Pole Position&quot; (1982) and &quot;Pole Position II&quot; (1983). It was ported to the Famicom by Arc System Works, making it Arc System Works&#x27; debut game.

&quot;Final Lap&quot; was the first racing game to allow up to eight players to simultaneously race on the Suzuka Circuit in a Formula One race. This was, at the time, considered a revolutionary feature, and was implemented by linking together up to four two-player sitdown-style arcade cabinets.

There was also a single-player mode, in which the player&#x27;s score was based on how far the car traveled until time ran out or if the player completed four laps. It was a major commercial success in Japan, becoming the third highest-grossing arcade game of 1988, the highest-grossing dedicated arcade game of 1989, and second highest dedicated arcade game of 1990.

==Gameplay==

The player drives Formula One cars of the 1987 season and may choose between Williams-Honda, Lotus-Honda, McLaren-Porsche, or March-Cosworth. 1987 was the first year a Formula One grand prix was held on the Suzuka Circuit, the main track in the game. The track layout is reproduced accurately, going so far as to include sponsor billboards, but the length is greatly shortened, and it takes less than forty seconds to complete one lap in the game.

The Famicom version is mostly unrelated to the original arcade game, including more tracks and somewhat simpler game play. The Famicom version features both a single-player and two-player split screen mode. The game uses an upgrade system, rather than different cars. The game will slowly increase the computer controlled car&#x27;s difficulty, requiring the player to continuously upgrade the car in order to keep up. The upgrades consist of engine upgrades, brake upgrades, tire upgrades, and extra boost. The game was released in Japan on August 12, 1988.

==Reception==

&quot;Final Lap&quot; was a major commercial success in Japan, where it remained one of the most-popular and profitable arcade games, being towards the top of arcade earnings charts for three consecutive years. It was Japan&#x27;s third highest-grossing arcade game of 1988 (below &quot;After Burner&quot; and &quot;Operation Wolf&quot;), and went on to become Japan&#x27;s highest-grossing dedicated arcade game of 1989. It was later Japan&#x27;s second highest-grossing dedicated arcade game of 1990 (below &quot;Super Monaco GP&quot;).

The game received positive reviews from critics. Clare Edgeley of &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; called it &quot;a first class racing sim&quot; that is &quot;tremendously addictive&quot; especially in multiplayer mode and a &quot;definitive must&quot; for all racing drivers.

==Legacy==
&quot;Final Lap&quot; was followed by &quot;Final Lap 2&quot; in 1990 which featured courses in Japan, the United States, Italy, and Monaco; &quot;Final Lap 3&quot; in 1992, which featured courses in England, France, San Marino, and Spain; and &quot;Final Lap R&quot; in 1993, which featured courses in Belgium, Brazil, Germany, and Hungary.

There were also a number of spin-offs: a racing-RPG &quot;Final Lap Twin&quot; released for the TurboGrafx-16 in 1989; and &quot;Final Lap 2000&quot; and &quot;Final Lap Special&quot;, a pair of games released for the WonderSwan and WonderSwan Color respectively.

<text>Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, commonly known by the abbreviations RuBisCo, rubisco, RuBPCase, or RuBPco, is an enzyme () involved in the light-independent (or &quot;dark&quot;) part of photosynthesis, including the carbon fixation by which atmospheric carbon dioxide is converted by plants and other photosynthetic organisms to energy-rich molecules such as glucose. It emerged approximately four billion years ago in primordial metabolism prior to the presence of oxygen on Earth. It is probably the most abundant enzyme on Earth. In chemical terms, it catalyzes the carboxylation of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (also known as RuBP).

==Alternative carbon fixation pathways==
RuBisCO is important biologically because it catalyzes the primary chemical reaction by which inorganic carbon enters the biosphere. While many autotrophic bacteria and archaea fix carbon via the reductive acetyl CoA pathway, the 3-hydroxypropionate cycle, or the reverse Krebs cycle, these pathways are relatively small contributors to global carbon fixation compared to that catalyzed by RuBisCO. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, unlike RuBisCO, only temporarily fixes carbon. Reflecting its importance, RuBisCO is the most abundant protein in leaves, accounting for 50% of soluble leaf protein in plants (20–30% of total leaf nitrogen) and 30% of soluble leaf protein in plants (5–9% of total leaf nitrogen). Given its important role in the biosphere, the genetic engineering of RuBisCO in crops is of continuing interest (see below).

== Structure ==
In plants, algae, cyanobacteria, and phototrophic and chemoautotrophic Pseudomonadota (formerly proteobacteria), the enzyme usually consists of two types of protein subunit, called the large chain (L, about 55,000 Da) and the small chain (S, about 13,000 Da). The &quot;large-chain&quot; gene (&quot;rbcL&quot;) is encoded by the chloroplast DNA in plants. There are typically several related &quot;small-chain&quot; genes in the nucleus of plant cells, and the small chains are imported to the stromal compartment of chloroplasts from the cytosol by crossing the outer chloroplast membrane. The enzymatically active substrate (ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate) binding sites are located in the large chains that form dimers in which amino acids from each large chain contribute to the binding sites. A total of eight large chains (= four dimers) and eight small chains assemble into a larger complex of about 540,000 Da. In some Pseudomonadota and dinoflagellates, enzymes consisting of only large subunits have been found.

Magnesium ions () are needed for enzymatic activity. Correct positioning of in the active site of the enzyme involves addition of an &quot;activating&quot; carbon dioxide molecule () to a lysine in the active site (forming a carbamate). operates by driving deprotonation of the Lys210 residue, causing the Lys residue to rotate by 120 degrees to the &quot;trans&quot; conformer, decreasing the distance between the nitrogen of Lys and the carbon of . The close proximity allows for the formation of a covalent bond, resulting in the carbamate. is first enabled to bind to the active site by the rotation of His335 to an alternate conformation. is then coordinated by the His residues of the active site (His300, His302, His335), and is partially neutralized by the coordination of three water molecules and their conversion to −OH. This coordination results in an unstable complex, but produces a favorable environment for the binding of . Formation of the carbamate is favored by an alkaline pH. The pH and the concentration of magnesium ions in the fluid compartment (in plants, the stroma of the chloroplast) increases in the light. The role of changing pH and magnesium ion levels in the regulation of RuBisCO enzyme activity is discussed below. Once the carbamate is formed, His335 finalizes the activation by returning to its initial position through thermal fluctuation.

==Enzymatic activity==

RuBisCO is one of many enzymes in the Calvin cycle. When Rubisco facilitates the attack of at the C2 carbon of RuBP and subsequent bond cleavage between the C3 and C2 carbon, 2 molecules of glycerate-3-phosphate are formed. The conversion involves these steps: enolisation, carboxylation, hydration, C-C bond cleavage, and protonation.

=== Substrates ===
Substrates for RuBisCO are ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate and carbon dioxide (distinct from the &quot;activating&quot; carbon dioxide). RuBisCO also catalyses a reaction of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate and molecular oxygen (O2) instead of carbon dioxide ().
Discriminating between the substrates and O2 is attributed to the differing interactions of the substrate&#x27;s quadrupole moments and a high electrostatic field gradient. This gradient is established by the dimer form of the minimally active RuBisCO, which with its two components provides a combination of oppositely charged domains required for the enzyme&#x27;s interaction with O2 and . These conditions help explain the low turnover rate found in RuBisCO: In order to increase the strength of the electric field necessary for sufficient interaction with the substrates’ quadrupole moments, the C- and N- terminal segments of the enzyme must be closed off, allowing the active site to be isolated from the solvent and lowering the dielectric constant. This isolation has a significant entropic cost, and results in the poor turnover rate.

==== Binding RuBP ====
Carbamylation of the ε-amino group of Lys210 is stabilized by coordination with the . This reaction involves binding of the carboxylate termini of Asp203 and Glu204 to the ion. The substrate RuBP binds displacing two of the three aquo ligands.

==== Enolisation ====
Enolisation of RuBP is the conversion of the keto tautomer of RuBP to an enediol(ate). Enolisation is initiated by deprotonation at C3. The enzyme base in this step has been debated, but the steric constraints observed in crystal structures have made Lys210 the most likely candidate. Specifically, the carbamate oxygen on Lys210 that is not coordinated with the Mg ion deprotonates the C3 carbon of RuBP to form a 2,3-enediolate.

==== Carboxylation====

Carboxylation of the 2,3-enediolate results in the intermediate 3-keto-2-carboxyarabinitol-1,5-bisphosphate and Lys334 is positioned to facilitate the addition of the substrate as it replaces the third -coordinated water molecule and add directly to the enediol. No Michaelis complex is formed in this process. Hydration of this ketone results in an additional hydroxy group on C3, forming a gem-diol intermediate. Carboxylation and hydration have been proposed as either a single concerted step or as two sequential steps. Concerted mechanism is supported by the proximity of the water molecule to C3 of RuBP in multiple crystal structures. Within the spinach structure, other residues are well placed to aid in the hydration step as they are within hydrogen bonding distance of the water molecule.

==== C-C bond cleavage====
The gem-diol intermediate cleaves at the C2-C3 bond to form one molecule of glycerate-3-phosphate and a negatively charged carboxylate. Stereo specific protonation of C2 of this carbanion results in another molecule of glycerate-3-phosphate. This step is thought to be facilitated by Lys175 or potentially the carbamylated Lys210.

===Products===
When carbon dioxide is the substrate, the product of the carboxylase reaction is an unstable six-carbon phosphorylated intermediate known as 3-keto-2-carboxyarabinitol-1,5-bisphosphate, which decays rapidly into two molecules of glycerate-3-phosphate. This product, also known as 3-phosphoglycerate, can be used to produce larger molecules such as glucose.

When molecular oxygen is the substrate, the products of the oxygenase reaction are phosphoglycolate and 3-phosphoglycerate. Phosphoglycolate is recycled through a sequence of reactions called photorespiration, which involves enzymes and cytochromes located in the mitochondria and peroxisomes (this is a case of metabolite repair). In this process, two molecules of phosphoglycolate are converted to one molecule of carbon dioxide and one molecule of 3-phosphoglycerate, which can reenter the Calvin cycle. Some of the phosphoglycolate entering this pathway can be retained by plants to produce other molecules such as glycine. At ambient levels of carbon dioxide and oxygen, the ratio of the reactions is about 4 to 1, which results in a net carbon dioxide fixation of only 3.5. Thus, the inability of the enzyme to prevent the reaction with oxygen greatly reduces the photosynthetic capacity of many plants. Some plants, many algae, and photosynthetic bacteria have overcome this limitation by devising means to increase the concentration of carbon dioxide around the enzyme, including carbon fixation, crassulacean acid metabolism, and the use of pyrenoid.

Rubisco side activities can lead to useless or inhibitory by-products. Important inhibitory by-products include xylulose 1,5-bisphosphate and glycero-2,3-pentodiulose 1,5-bisphosphate, both caused by &quot;misfires&quot; halfway in the enolisation-carboxylation reaction. In higher plants, this process causes RuBisCO self-inhibition, which can be triggered by saturating and RuBP concentrations and solved by Rubisco activase (see below).

===Rate of enzymatic activity===
Some enzymes can carry out thousands of chemical reactions each second. However, RuBisCO is slow, fixing only 3–10 carbon dioxide molecules each second per molecule of enzyme. The reaction catalyzed by RuBisCO is, thus, the primary rate-limiting factor of the Calvin cycle during the day. Nevertheless, under most conditions, and when light is not otherwise limiting photosynthesis, the speed of RuBisCO responds positively to increasing carbon dioxide concentration.

RuBisCO is usually only active during the day, as ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate is not regenerated in the dark. This is due to the regulation of several other enzymes in the Calvin cycle. In addition, the activity of RuBisCO is coordinated with that of the other enzymes of the Calvin cycle in several other ways:

====By ions====
Upon illumination of the chloroplasts, the pH of the stroma rises from 7.0 to 8.0 because of the proton (hydrogen ion, ) gradient created across the thylakoid membrane. The movement of protons into thylakoids is driven by light and is fundamental to ATP synthesis in chloroplasts &quot;(Further reading: Photosynthetic reaction centre; Light-dependent reactions)&quot;. To balance ion potential across the membrane, magnesium ions () move out of the thylakoids in response, increasing the concentration of magnesium in the stroma of the chloroplasts. RuBisCO has a high optimal pH (can be &gt;9.0, depending on the magnesium ion concentration) and, thus, becomes &quot;activated&quot; by the introduction of carbon dioxide and magnesium to the active sites as described above.

====By RuBisCO activase====
In plants and some algae, another enzyme, RuBisCO activase (Rca, , ), is required to allow the rapid formation of the critical carbamate in the active site of RuBisCO. This is required because ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) binds more strongly to the active sites of RuBisCO when excess carbamate is present, preventing processes from moving forward. In the light, RuBisCO activase promotes the release of the inhibitory (or — in some views — storage) RuBP from the catalytic sites of RuBisCO. Activase is also required in some plants (e.g., tobacco and many beans) because, in darkness, RuBisCO is inhibited (or protected from hydrolysis) by a competitive inhibitor synthesized by these plants, a substrate analog 2-carboxy-D-arabitinol 1-phosphate (CA1P). CA1P binds tightly to the active site of carbamylated RuBisCO and inhibits catalytic activity to an even greater extent. CA1P has also been shown to keep RuBisCO in a conformation that is protected from proteolysis. In the light, RuBisCO activase also promotes the release of CA1P from the catalytic sites. After the CA1P is released from RuBisCO, it is rapidly converted to a non-inhibitory form by a light-activated CA1P-phosphatase. Even without these strong inhibitors, once every several hundred reactions, the normal reactions with carbon dioxide or oxygen are not completed; other inhibitory substrate analogs are still formed in the active site. Once again, RuBisCO activase can promote the release of these analogs from the catalytic sites and maintain the enzyme in a catalytically active form. However, at high temperatures, RuBisCO activase aggregates and can no longer activate RuBisCO. This contributes to the decreased carboxylating capacity observed during heat stress.

====By activase====
The removal of the inhibitory RuBP, CA1P, and the other inhibitory substrate analogs by activase requires the consumption of ATP. This reaction is inhibited by the presence of ADP, and, thus, activase activity depends on the ratio of these compounds in the chloroplast stroma. Furthermore, in most plants, the sensitivity of activase to the ratio of ATP/ADP is modified by the stromal reduction/oxidation (redox) state through another small regulatory protein, thioredoxin. In this manner, the activity of activase and the activation state of RuBisCO can be modulated in response to light intensity and, thus, the rate of formation of the ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate substrate.

====By phosphate====
In cyanobacteria, inorganic phosphate (Pi) also participates in the co-ordinated regulation of photosynthesis: Pi binds to the RuBisCO active site and to another site on the large chain where it can influence transitions between activated and less active conformations of the enzyme. In this way, activation of bacterial RuBisCO might be particularly sensitive to Pi levels, which might cause it to act in a similar way to how RuBisCO activase functions in higher plants.

====By carbon dioxide====
Since carbon dioxide and oxygen compete at the active site of RuBisCO, carbon fixation by RuBisCO can be enhanced by increasing the carbon dioxide level in the compartment containing RuBisCO (chloroplast stroma). Several times during the evolution of plants, mechanisms have evolved for increasing the level of carbon dioxide in the stroma (see carbon fixation). The use of oxygen as a substrate appears to be a puzzling process, since it seems to throw away captured energy. However, it may be a mechanism for preventing carbohydrate overload during periods of high light flux. This weakness in the enzyme is the cause of photorespiration, such that healthy leaves in bright light may have zero net carbon fixation when the ratio of O2 to available to RuBisCO shifts too far towards oxygen. This phenomenon is primarily temperature-dependent: high temperatures can decrease the concentration of dissolved in the moisture of leaf tissues. This phenomenon is also related to water stress: since plant leaves are evaporatively cooled, limited water causes high leaf temperatures. plants use the enzyme PEP carboxylase initially, which has a higher affinity for . The process first makes a 4-carbon intermediate compound, hence the name plants, which is shuttled into a site of photosynthesis then decarboxylated, releasing to boost the concentration of .

Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) plants keep their stomata closed during the day, which conserves water but prevents the light-independent reactions (a.k.a. the Calvin Cycle) from taking place, since these reactions require to pass by gas exchange through these openings. Evaporation through the upper side of a leaf is prevented by a layer of wax.

== Genetic engineering ==

Since RuBisCO is often rate-limiting for photosynthesis in plants, it may be possible to improve photosynthetic efficiency by modifying RuBisCO genes in plants to increase catalytic activity and/or decrease oxygenation rates. This could improve sequestration of and be a strategy to increase crop yields. Approaches under investigation include transferring RuBisCO genes from one organism into another organism, engineering Rubisco activase from thermophilic cyanobacteria into temperature sensitive plants, increasing the level of expression of RuBisCO subunits, expressing RuBisCO small chains from the chloroplast DNA, and altering RuBisCO genes to increase specificity for carbon dioxide or otherwise increase the rate of carbon fixation.

=== Mutagenesis in plants ===
In general, site-directed mutagenesis of RuBisCO has been mostly unsuccessful, though mutated forms of the protein have been achieved in tobacco plants with subunit C4 species, and a RuBisCO with more C4-like kinetic characteristics have been attained in rice via nuclear transformation. Robust and reliable engineering for yield of RuBisCO and other enzymes in the C3 cycle was shown to be possible, and it was first achieved in 2019 through a synthetic biology approach.

One avenue is to introduce RuBisCO variants with naturally high specificity values such as the ones from the red alga &quot;Galdieria partita&quot; into plants. This may improve the photosynthetic efficiency of crop plants, although possible negative impacts have yet to be studied. Advances in this area include the replacement of the tobacco enzyme with that of the purple photosynthetic bacterium &quot;Rhodospirillum rubrum&quot;. In 2014, two transplastomic tobacco lines with functional RuBisCO from the cyanobacterium &quot;Synechococcus elongatus&quot; PCC7942 (Se7942) were created by replacing the RuBisCO with the large and small subunit genes of the Se7942 enzyme, in combination with either the corresponding Se7942 assembly chaperone, RbcX, or an internal carboxysomal protein, CcmM35. Both mutants had increased fixation rates when measured as carbon molecules per RuBisCO. However, the mutant plants grew more slowly than wild-type.

A recent theory explores the trade-off between the relative specificity (i.e., ability to favour fixation over O2 incorporation, which leads to the energy-wasteful process of photorespiration) and the rate at which product is formed. The authors conclude that RuBisCO may actually have evolved to reach a point of &#x27;near-perfection&#x27; in many plants (with widely varying substrate availabilities and environmental conditions), reaching a compromise between specificity and reaction rate. It has been also suggested that the oxygenase reaction of RuBisCO prevents depletion near its active sites and provides the maintenance of the chloroplast redox state.

Since photosynthesis is the single most effective natural regulator of carbon dioxide in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, a biochemical model of RuBisCO reaction is used as the core module of climate change models. Thus, a correct model of this reaction is essential to the basic understanding of the relations and interactions of environmental models.

=== Expression in bacterial hosts ===
There currently are very few effective methods for expressing functional plant Rubisco in bacterial hosts for genetic manipulation studies. This is largely due to Rubisco&#x27;s requirement of complex cellular machinery for its biogenesis and metabolic maintenance including the nuclear-encoded RbcS subunits, which are typically imported into chloroplasts as unfolded proteins. Furthermore, sufficient expression and interaction with Rubisco activase are major challenges as well. One successful method for expression of Rubisco in &quot;E. coli&quot; involves the co-expression of multiple chloroplast chaperones, though this has only been shown for &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot; Rubisco.

== Depletion in proteomic studies ==
Due to its high abundance in plants (generally 40% of the total protein content), RuBisCO often impedes analysis of important signaling proteins such as transcription factors, kinases, and regulatory proteins found in lower abundance (10-100 molecules per cell) within plants. For example, using mass spectrometry on plant protein mixtures would result in multiple intense RuBisCO subunit peaks that interfere and hide those of other proteins.

Recently, one efficient method for precipitating out RuBisCO involves the usage of protamine sulfate solution. Other existing methods for depleting RuBisCO and studying lower abundance proteins include fractionation techniques with calcium and phytate, gel electrophoresis with polyethylene glycol, affinity chromatography, and aggregation using DTT, though these methods are more time-consuming and less efficient when compared to protamine sulfate precipitation.

== Evolution of RuBisCO ==
=== Phylogenetic studies ===
The chloroplast gene &quot;rbcL&quot;, which codes for the large subunit of RuBisCO has been widely used as an appropriate locus for analysis of phylogenetics in plant taxonomy.

=== Origin ===

Non-carbon-fixing proteins similar to RuBisCO, termed RuBisCO-like proteins (RLPs), are also found in the wild in organisms as common as &quot;Bacillus subtilis&quot;. This bacterium has a rbcL-like protein with a 2,3-diketo-5-methylthiopentyl-1-phosphate enolase function, part of the methionine salvage pathway. Later identifications found functionally divergent examples dispersed all over bacteria and archaea, as well as transitionary enzymes performing both RLP-type enolase and RuBisCO functions. It is now believed that the current RuBisCO evolved from a dimeric RLP ancestor, acquiring its carboxylase function first before further oligomerizing and then recruiting the small subunit to form the familiar modern enzyme. The small subunit probably first evolved in anaerobic and thermophilic organisms, where it enabled RuBisCO to catalyze its reaction at higher temperatures. In addition to its effect on stabilizing catalysis, it enabled the evolution of higher specificities for over O2 by modulating the effect that substitutions within RuBisCO have on enzymatic function. Substitutions that do not have an effect without the small subunit suddenly become beneficial when it is bound. Furthermore, the small subunit enabled the accumulation of substitutions that are only tolerated in its presence. Accumulation of such substitutions leads to a strict dependence on the small subunit, which is observed in extant Rubiscos that bind a small subunit.

=== C4 ===
With the mass convergent evolution of the C4-fixation pathway in a diversity of plant lineages, ancestral C3-type RuBisCO evolved to have faster turnover of in exchange for lower specificity as a result of the greater localization of from the mesophyll cells into the bundle sheath cells. This was achieved through enhancement of conformational flexibility of the “open-closed” transition in the Calvin cycle. Laboratory-based phylogenetic studies have shown that this evolution was constrained by the trade-off between stability and activity brought about by the series of necessary mutations for C4 RuBisCO. Moreover, in order to sustain the destabilizing mutations, the evolution to C4 RuBisCO was preceded by a period in which mutations granted the enzyme increased stability, establishing a buffer to sustain and maintain the mutations required for C4 RuBisCO. To assist with this buffering process, the newly-evolved enzyme was found to have further developed a series of stabilizing mutations. While RuBisCO has always been accumulating new mutations, most of these mutations that have survived have not had significant effects on protein stability. The destabilizing C4 mutations on RuBisCO has been sustained by environmental pressures such as low concentrations, requiring a sacrifice of stability for new adaptive functions.

==History of the term==
The term &quot;RuBisCO&quot; was coined humorously in 1979, by David Eisenberg at a seminar honouring the retirement of the early, prominent RuBisCO researcher, Sam Wildman, and also alluded to the snack food trade name &quot;Nabisco&quot; in reference to Wildman&#x27;s attempts to create an edible protein supplement from tobacco leaves.

The capitalization of the name has been long debated. It can be capitalized for each letter of the full name (Ribulose-1,5 bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase), but it has also been argued that is should all be in lower case (rubisco), similar to other terms like scuba or laser.

<doc id="318373" wikidata="Q1280849" url="?curid=318373" title="Four Brothers (jazz standard)">
<text>Four Brothers is a jazz standard in AABA format written by Jimmy Giuffre in 1947, based on the chord changes of &#x27;Jeepers Creepers&#x27;. The song was written for the &quot;Four Brothers&quot; saxophone section of Woody Herman&#x27;s second band, and has since been covered by many groups.

== Notable recordings ==
Woody Herman recorded it on December 27, 1947, for Columbia records with his second Herd, which had been organized earlier that year. It features the &quot;Four Brothers&quot; saxophone section of Zoot Sims, Serge Chaloff, Herbie Steward, and Stan Getz, playing in that order. All four played in the light, almost vibrato-less, style of their idol, Lester Young. The song so typifies the sound of Woody Herman&#x27;s second Herd that the band is also known as the Four Brothers Band.

Giuffre recorded it in 1955 when it was released on his debut album by Capitol. He again recorded it in 1958, an album released by Atlantic titled &quot;The Four Brothers Sound&quot;.

<text>The following is a list of historically important scientific experiments and observations demonstrating something of great scientific interest, typically in an elegant or clever manner.

==Astronomy==
* Ole Rømer makes the first quantitative estimate of the speed of light in 1676 by timing the motions of Jupiter&#x27;s satellite Io with a telescope
* Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson detect the cosmic microwave background radiation, giving support to the theory of the Big Bang (1964)
* Kerim Kerimov launches Kosmos 186 and Kosmos 188 as experiments on automatic docking eventually leading to the development of space stations (1967)
* The Supernova Cosmology Project and the High-Z Supernova Search Team discover, by observing Type Ia supernovae, that the expansion of the Universe is accelerating (1998)
*Galileo Galilei uses a telescope to observe that the moons of Jupiter appear to circle Jupiter. This evidence supports the heliocentric model, and weakens the geocentric model of the cosmos (1609)

==Biology==
* Robert Hooke, using a microscope, observes cells (1665).
* Anton van Leeuwenhoek discovers microorganisms (1674–1676).
* James Lind, publishes &#x27;A Treatise of the Scurvy&#x27; which describes a controlled shipboard experiment using two identical populations but with only one variable, the consumption of citrus fruit (1753). 
* Edward Jenner tests his hypothesis for the protective action of mild cowpox infection for smallpox, the first vaccine (1796).
* Gregor Mendel&#x27;s experiments with the garden pea led him to surmise many of the fundamental laws of genetics (dominant vs recessive genes, the 1–2–1 ratio, see Mendelian inheritance) (1856–1863).
*Charles Darwin demonstrates evolution by natural selection using many examples (1859).
* Louis Pasteur uses S-shaped flasks to prevent spores from contaminating broth. This disproves the theory of Spontaneous generation (1861) extending the rancid meat experiment of Francesco Redi (1668) to the micro scale.
*Charles Darwin and his son Francis, using dark-grown oat seedlings, discover the stimulus for phototropism is detected at the tip of the shoot (the coleoptile tip), but the bending takes place in the region below the tip (1880).
* Emil von Behring and Kitasato Shibasaburō demonstrate passive immunity, protection of animals from infection by injection of immune serum (1890).
* Thomas Hunt Morgan identifies a sex chromosome linked gene in &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; (1910) and his student Alfred Sturtevant develops the first genetic map (1913).
*Alexander Fleming demonstrates that the zone of inhibition around a growth of penicillin mould on a culture dish of bacteria is caused by a diffusible substance secreted by the mould (1928).
* Frederick Griffith demonstrates (Griffith&#x27;s experiment) that living cells can be transformed via a transforming principle, later discovered to be DNA (1928). 
* Karl von Frisch decodes the waggle dance honey bees use to communicate the location of flowers (1940). 
* George Wells Beadle and Edward Lawrie Tatum moot the &quot;one gene-one enzyme hypothesis&quot; based on induced mutations in bread mold &quot;Neurospora crassa&quot; (1941). 
* Luria–Delbrück experiment demonstrates that in bacteria, beneficial mutations arise in the absence of selection, rather than being a response to selection (1943). 
* Barbara McClintock breeds maize plants for color, which leads to the discovery of transposable elements or jumping genes (1944). 
* Linus Pauling and colleagues show in &quot;Sickle Cell Anemia, a Molecular Disease&quot; that a human genetic disease, sickle cell anemia, is caused by a molecular change in a specific protein, hemoglobin (1949). 
* Hershey–Chase experiment (by Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase) uses bacteriophage to prove that DNA is the hereditary material (1952).
* Meselson–Stahl experiment proves that DNA replication is semiconservative (1958). 
* Crick, Brenner et al. experiment using frameshift mutations to support the triplet nature of the genetic code (1961). 
* Nirenberg and Matthaei experiment demonstrating &quot;in vitro&quot; protein synthesis using synthetic RNA as to substitute for messenger RNA (1961).
* John Gurdon clones an animal, a frog tadpole, from an egg cell using the nucleus from an intestinal cell (1962).
* Roger W. Sperry shows the potential independence of the two sides of the human brain using &quot;split-brain&quot; patients (1962–1965). 
* Nirenberg and Leder experiment, binding tRNA to ribosomes with synthetic RNA to decipher the genetic code (1964). 
* Demonstration of the role of reverse transcriptases in tumor viruses, independently by Howard Temin and David Baltimore, 1970. 
* Herbert Boyer and Stanley Cohen selectively clone genes in bacteria, using bacterial plasmids cut by specific endonucleases (1975).
* Mary-Dell Chilton shows that crown gall tumors of plants are caused by the transfer of a small piece of DNA from the bacterium &quot;Agrobacterium tumefaciens&quot; into the host plant, where it becomes part of its genome (1977). 
* Napoli, Lemieux and Jorgensen discover the principle of RNA interference (1990).

==Chemistry==
*Robert Boyle uses an air pump to determine the inverse relationship between the pressure and volume of a gas. This relationship came to be known as Boyle&#x27;s law (1660–1662).
*Joseph Priestley suspends a bowl of water above a beer vat at a brewery and synthesizes carbonated water (1767).
*Antoine Lavoisier determines that oxygen combines with materials upon combustion, thus disproving phlogiston theory (1783).
*Antoine Lavoisier determines that chemical reactions in a closed container do not alter total mass. From these observations he establishes the law of conservation of mass (1789).
*Benjamin Thompson, Count Rumford demonstrates that the heat developed by the friction of boring cannon is nearly inexhaustible. This result was presented in opposition to caloric theory (1798).
*Humphry Davy uses electrolysis to isolate elemental potassium, sodium, calcium, strontium, barium, magnesium, and chlorine (1807–1810).
*Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac studies reactions among gases and determines that their volumes combine chemically in simple integer ratios (1809).
*Robert Brown studies very small particles in water under the microscope and observes Brownian motion which was later named in his honor (1827).
*Friedrich Wöhler synthesizes the organic compound urea using inorganic reactants, disproving the application of vitalism to chemical processes (1828).
*Thomas Graham measures the rates of effusion for different gases and establishes Graham&#x27;s law of effusion and diffusion (1833).
*Julius Robert von Mayer and James Prescott Joule measure the heat generated by mechanical work. This establishes the principle of conservation of energy and the kinetic theory of heat (1842–1843).
*Louis Pasteur separates a racemic mixture of two enantiomers by sorting individual crystals, and demonstrates their impact on the polarization of light (1849).

<doc id="318375" wikidata="Q157635" url="?curid=318375" title="Zubin Mehta">
<text>Zubin Mehta (born 29 April 1936) is an Indian conductor of Western classical music. He is music director emeritus of the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra (IPO) and conductor emeritus of the Los Angeles Philharmonic.

Mehta&#x27;s father was the founder of the Bombay Symphony Orchestra, and Mehta received his early musical education from him. When he was 18, he enrolled in the Vienna state music academy, from which he graduated after three years with a diploma as a conductor. He began winning international competitions and conducted the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic at the age of 21. Beginning in the 1960s, Mehta gained experience by substituting for celebrated maestros throughout the world.

Mehta was music director of the Montreal Symphony Orchestra from 1961 to 1967 and of the Los Angeles Philharmonic from 1962 to 1978, the youngest music director ever for any major North American orchestra. In 1969, he was appointed Music Adviser to the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra and in 1981 he became its Music Director for Life. From 1978 to 1991, Mehta was music director of the New York Philharmonic. He was chief conductor of the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino in Florence from 1985 to 2017.

He is an honorary citizen of both Florence and Tel Aviv and was made an honorary member of the Vienna State Opera in 1997 and of the Bavarian State Opera in 2006. The title of Honorary Conductor was bestowed on him by numerous orchestras throughout the world. More recently, Mehta made several tours with the Bavarian State Opera and kept up a busy schedule of guest conducting appearances. In December 2006, he received the Kennedy Center Honor and in October 2008 he was honored by the Japanese Imperial Family with the Praemium Imperiale.
In 2016, Mehta was appointed Honorary Conductor of the Teatro San Carlo, Naples.

==Early years and education==
Mehta was born into a Parsi family in Bombay (now Mumbai), India, during the British Raj, the older son of Mehli (1908–2002) and Tehmina (Daruvala) Mehta. His native language is Gujarati. His father was a self-taught violinist who founded and conducted the Bombay Symphony Orchestra and later the American Youth Symphony, which he conducted for 33 years after moving to Los Angeles. His father had previously lived in New York to study with violinist Ivan Galamian, a noted teacher who also taught Itzhak Perlman and Pinchas Zukerman. His father returned to Bombay as an accomplished violinist of the Russian school. Mehta has said that on many occasions when he conducts in the U.S., someone approaches him to say, &quot;You don&#x27;t know how much I loved your father!&quot;

Mehta has described his childhood as surrounded by music at home all the time, and has said he probably learned to speak Gujarati and sing around the same time. He says his father had a strong influence on him, and he listened to his quartet daily after his father returned from the US after the Second World War. Mehta was first taught to play violin and piano by his father. When he reached his early teens, his father allowed him to lead sectional rehearsals of the Bombay Symphony, and at sixteen, he was conducting the full orchestra during rehearsals.

Mehta graduated from St. Mary&#x27;s School, Mumbai and went on to study medicine at St. Xavier&#x27;s College, Mumbai, at the urging of his mother, who wanted him to take up a profession more &quot;respectable&quot; than music. At age eighteen, he dropped out after two years to move to Vienna, one of Europe&#x27;s music centers, in order to study music under Hans Swarowsky at the state music academy. He lived on $75 per month, and was a contemporary of conductor Claudio Abbado and conductor-pianist Daniel Barenboim.

He remained at the academy for three years, during which time he also studied the double bass, which he played in the Vienna Chamber Orchestra. Swarowsky recognized Mehta&#x27;s abilities early on, describing him as a &quot;demoniac conductor&quot; who &quot;had it all&quot;. While still a student, after the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, he organized a student orchestra in seven days and conducted it in a concert at a refugee camp outside Vienna.

Mehta graduated in 1957 when he was 21 with a diploma in conducting. In 1958, he entered the Liverpool International Conductor&#x27;s Competition with 100 contestants and took first prize. The prize included a year&#x27;s contract as associate conductor of the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic, which he conducted in 14 concerts, all of which received rave reviews.

He then was a third-place prizewinner at the summer academy at the Tanglewood Music Center in Massachusetts. At that competition he attracted the notice of Charles Munch, then the conductor of the Boston Symphony, who later helped his career. In 1958, he boldly programmed an all-Schoenberg concert, which did so well that he accepted further bookings. That same year he also married a Canadian voice student, Carmen Lasky, whom he met in Vienna.

==Conducting career==
===1960s===

During 1960 and 1961, Mehta was asked to substitute for celebrated maestros throughout the world, receiving high critical acclaim for most of those concerts. In 1960, he conducted a series for the Vienna Symphony and later that summer made his New York conducting debut leading the New York Philharmonic.

In 1960, with the help of Charles Munch, Mehta became the chief conductor and Music Director of the Montreal Symphony Orchestra, a post he held until 1967. By 1961, he had already conducted the Vienna, Berlin and Israel Philharmonic orchestras. In 1962, he took the Montreal Symphony on a concert tour to Russia, Paris and Vienna. Mehta was most apprehensive about his concert in Vienna, which he said was considered the &quot;capital of Western music&quot;. His single concert there received a 20-minute ovation, 14 curtain calls, and two encores.

In 1961, he was named assistant conductor of the Los Angeles Philharmonic (LAP), although the orchestra&#x27;s music director designate, Georg Solti, was not consulted on the appointment, and resigned in protest. The orchestra had been without a permanent conductor for four years when Mehta started directing it.

Mehta was named Music Director of the orchestra and held the post from 1962 to 1978. When he began his first season with the orchestra in 1962, he was 26, the youngest person ever to hold that title. As he had also conducted the Montreal Symphony during those early years, he became the first person to direct two North American symphony orchestras at the same time.

As the LAP&#x27;s first conductor in four years, Mehta worked to polish its overall sound to something closer to the Vienna Philharmonic&#x27;s. He succeeded in making its sound warmer and richer by fostering competition among the musicians, shifting assignments, giving promotions and changing seating arrangements. He also inspired the musicians; 21-year-old cellist Jacqueline du Pré said, &quot;He provides a magic carpet for you to float on.&quot; Cellist Kurt Reher recalls Mehta&#x27;s first rehearsal with the orchestra: &quot;within two beats we were entranced. It seemed this young man had the ability, the musical knowledge of a man of 50 or 55.&quot;

In 1965, after Mehta&#x27;s debut with the Metropolitan Opera&#x27;s performance of &quot;Aida&quot;, music critic Alan Rich wrote, &quot;Mehta brought to the conducting of the score a kind of bedazzlement that has no peer in recent times ... It was a lunging, teeming, breathless performance that still had plenty of breath.&quot; He subsequently conducted the Met in performances of &quot;Carmen&quot;, &quot;Tosca&quot;, and &quot;Turandot&quot;.

For Montreal&#x27;s Expo 67, he conducted both the Montreal and the Los Angeles orchestras together for a performance of Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;Symphonie fantastique&quot;. Also that year, Mehta conducted the world premier of Marvin David Levy&#x27;s &quot;Mourning Becomes Electra&quot;.

By May 1967, his schedule was becoming overcrowded and he resigned his Montreal post. That fall he took the 107-member Los Angeles Philharmonic on an eight-week tour, including engagements in Vienna, Paris, Athens, and Bombay. By 1968, his popularity kept him busier than the year before, including 22 weeks of concerts with the Los Angeles Philharmonic, three operas at the Met, television appearances in the U.S. and Italy, five recording sessions, and guest appearances at five festivals and with five orchestras. &quot;Time&quot; magazine put him on its cover in January 1968. In 1969 his schedule remained equally active.

In 1970, Mehta performed with Frank Zappa&#x27;s Mothers of Invention on Zappa&#x27;s &quot;200 Motels&quot; and Edgar Varese&#x27;s Intergrales, at UCLA&#x27;s Pauley Pavilion basketball stadium with an audience of 12,000. There is no authorized recording, though some bootlegs exist.

===1970s–1980s===
In 1978, Mehta became the Music Director and Principal Conductor of the New York Philharmonic and remained there until his resignation in 1991.

He became music director of the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra (IPO) in 1977. He began the first of many guest appearances with the IPO in 1961. In 1966, he toured with the orchestra, and during the 1967 Arab–Israeli war, he rushed back to Israel to conduct several special concerts to demonstrate solidarity with its people. He was appointed IPO&#x27;s Music Advisor in 1969, Music Director in 1977, and was made its Music Director for Life in 1981.

During his five-decade connection with the IPO, he has conducted it in thousands of concerts in Israel and abroad. He conducted concerts with the IPO in South Lebanon in 1982, after which Arabs rushed onstage to hug the musicians. He conducted it during the Gulf War in 1991, when the audience brought gas masks; in 2007, it played for an entirely Arab audience in Nazareth. He claims to have a deep kinship with Israel&#x27;s musicians and the spirit and tradition of the Jewish people. He adds that conducting the IPO is &quot;something I do for my heart&quot;. Recalling those earlier years, he says: &quot;How I would love to see that sight again today, of Arabs and Jews hugging each other. I&#x27;m a positive thinker. I know this day will come.&quot;

In 1978, Mehta left the Los Angeles Philharmonic to become music director for the New York Philharmonic (NYP). Among the reasons he wanted to direct the NYP was that it allowed him to experiment with new ideas, such as taking the orchestra to Harlem. There, they played at the Abyssinian Baptist Church each year. Accompanying the orchestra with Mehta for various concerts were Isaac Stern, Itzhak Perlman, and Kathleen Battle. He stayed with the NYP until 1991.

From 1985 to 2017, Mehta was chief conductor of the Teatro del Maggio Musicale Fiorentino in Florence. From 1998 until 2006, he was music director of the Bavarian State Opera in Munich. The Munich Philharmonic named him its Honorary Conductor. Since 2005, Mehta has been the main conductor of the Palau de les Arts, the new opera house of the Ciutat de les Arts i les Ciències in Valencia, Spain.

While he was the conductor of the New York Philharmonic, Mehta commissioned Ravi Shankar&#x27;s Concerto No. 2 for sitar and orchestra. Following New York performances, the concerto was later recorded with the London Philharmonic Orchestra.

===1990s===
In 1998, he went to Munich where he began directing the Bavarian State Opera, because, he said, it provided &quot;another panorama for me, to be involved in the running of an opera house&quot;.

In 1990, he conducted the Orchestra del Maggio Musicale Fiorentino and the Orchestra del Teatro dell&#x27;Opera di Roma in the first ever Three Tenors concert in Rome, joining the tenors again in 1994 at the Dodger Stadium, Los Angeles. In between those appearances, he conducted the historic 1992 production of &quot;Tosca&quot; in which each act took place in the actual setting and at the actual time specified in the score. This production starred Catherine Malfitano in the title role, Plácido Domingo as Cavaradossi and Ruggero Raimondi as Baron Scarpia. Act I was telecast live from Rome&#x27;s Basilica of Sant&#x27;Andrea della Valle on Saturday, 11 July, at noon (Central European Daylight Saving Time); act II was telecast later that evening from the Palazzo Farnese at 9:40 p.m.; act III was telecast live on Sunday, 12 July, at 7:00 am from the Castel Sant&#x27;Angelo, also known as Hadrian&#x27;s Tomb.
In June 1994, Mehta performed the Mozart Requiem with the members of the Sarajevo Symphony Orchestra and Chorus at the ruins of Sarajevo&#x27;s National Library, in a fundraising concert for the victims of armed conflict and remembrance of the thousands of people killed in the Yugoslav Wars. On 29 August 1999, he conducted Mahler&#x27;s Symphony No. 2 (&quot;Resurrection&quot;), at the vicinity of Buchenwald concentration camp in Weimar, with the Bavarian State Orchestra and the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra sitting alongside each other.

He toured India (Mumbai) in 1984 with the New York Philharmonic, and again in November–December 1994 with the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra, along with soloists Itzhak Perlman and Gil Shaham. In 1997 and 1998, Mehta worked in collaboration with Chinese film director Zhang Yimou on a production of Giacomo Puccini&#x27;s opera &quot;Turandot&quot;, which they took to Florence and to Beijing, where it was staged in its actual surroundings in the Forbidden City, with over 300 extras and 300 soldiers, for nine historic performances. The making of this production was chronicled in the documentary &quot;The Turandot Project&quot;, which Mehta narrated.

Mehta was a guest conductor for the American Russian Young Artists Orchestra.

===2000s===

On 26 December 2005, the first anniversary of the Indian Ocean tsunami, Mehta and the Bavarian State Orchestra performed for the first time in Chennai (formerly Madras) at the Madras Music Academy. This tsunami memorial concert was organized by the German consulate in Chennai along with the Max-Mueller Bhavan/Goethe-Institut. 2006 was his last year with the Bavarian State Orchestra.

===2010s===
In 2011, Mehta&#x27;s performance with the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra at The Proms in London was picketed and interrupted by pro-Palestinian protesters, which caused the BBC to halt the live radio relay of the concert, the first such incident in Proms history. In September 2013, Mehta appeared with the Bavarian State Orchestra at a special concert, &quot;Ehsaas e Kashmir&quot;, organized by the German Embassy in India, at Mughal Gardens, Srinagar. Mehta and the orchestra renounced their usual fees for this concert.

In October 2015, he returned to Chennai to perform with the Australian World Orchestra (AWO) at the Madras Music Academy.

In 2016, the Harbin Symphony Orchestra and the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra performed two concerts conducted by Mehta in the frame of 33rd Harbin Summer Music Festival at Harbin Concert Hall.

In December 2016, the Israel Philharmonic announced that Mehta would conclude his tenure as music director in October 2019. He now has the title of music director emeritus of the Israel Philharmonic.

In August 2022, Mehta conducted the Australian World Orchestra (AWO) in Sydney and Melbourne at Concert Hall, Sydney Opera House and Hamer Hall, Arts Centre Melbourne. He also conducted the AWO at the Edinburgh International Festival and the BBC Proms 2022.

==Personal life==
Mehta&#x27;s first marriage was to Canadian soprano Carmen Lasky in 1958. They have a son, Mervon (since April 2009, Executive Director of Performing Arts for The Royal Conservatory in Toronto), and a daughter, Zarina. In 1964 they divorced. Two years after the divorce, Carmen married Mehta&#x27;s brother, Zarin Mehta, formerly the Executive Director of the New York Philharmonic. In July 1969, Mehta married Nancy Kovack, an American former film and television actress. A permanent resident of the United States, Mehta retains his Indian citizenship.

One of his close friends was Ravi Shankar, whom he first met in the 1960s when Mehta directed him with the Montreal Symphony. Their friendship continued after they were both living in Los Angeles and later in New York. &quot;This was a wonderful period in my life and Zubin and I really had a great time.&quot;

His second daughter Alexandra was born in Los Angeles in 1967.
His son Ori was born in the 1990s as the result of an extra-marital affair in Israel during Mehta&#x27;s second marriage.

<text>Jann Arden (born Jann Arden Anne Richards; March 27, 1962) is a Canadian singer-songwriter, author and actress. She is best known for her signature ballads, &quot;Could I Be Your Girl&quot; and &quot;Insensitive&quot;, which is her biggest hit to date, as well as other ballads, such as &quot;Cherry Popsicle&quot; and &quot;I Would Die for You&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Jann Arden was born in Calgary and moved as a child to Springbank, Alberta, where she attended Springbank Community High School. Her father was a construction contractor and her mother was a dental assistant. She is the middle child of three children.

Arden grew up in a troubled family dynamic. Her father was an abusive alcoholic. Her brother was convicted of the first-degree murder of 21 year-old Carrie Louise Marshall in Creston, British Columbia, and was incarcerated in Alberta in 1992.

After she graduated high school, Arden settled in Vancouver and sang with a series of bar bands. With these bands, she would sing cover songs of Led Zeppelin, Tina Turner, and Billie Holiday in a variety of locations including lounges, bars and ski resorts. During this time, she had attempted to launch a solo singing career but she was battling a bout of alcoholism which held her back.

==Career==
Arden released her first single, &quot;Never Love a Sailor&quot;, on the Canadian label Circa in 1981 under the name Jann Richards. She was discovered in 1985 by Calgary manager Neil MacGonigill, who worked with her from 1985 to 1998, both managing her career and acting as executive producer of her earlier albums. The two subsequently became estranged.

Arden released her critically acclaimed debut album, &quot;Time for Mercy&quot;, in 1993, and followed with a single &quot;I Would Die For You&quot;. Both were credited among the six Alberta Recording Industry Awards won by Arden in 1994.

Arden&#x27;s 1994 album &quot;Living Under June&quot; featured her biggest hit to date outside of Canada, &quot;Insensitive&quot;, which was released as a single from the soundtrack to the Christian Slater film &quot;Bed of Roses&quot; (number 12 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100). Another single from that same album, &quot;Could I Be Your Girl&quot;, has also had significant and consistent airplay on Canadian adult contemporary radio and featured a dance remix version which circulated on pop radio at the time.

Subsequent albums include 1997&#x27;s &quot;Happy?&quot;, 2000&#x27;s &quot;Blood Red Cherry&quot;, and 2003&#x27;s &quot;Love Is the Only Soldier&quot;. She also released a greatest hits album, &quot;Greatest Hurts&quot;, in 2001, and a live album, &quot;Jann Arden Live with the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra&quot; (2002). In 2005, she released her eighth album (her sixth album of new material), self-titled &quot;Jann Arden&quot;.

In 1998, respondents to &quot;Chart&quot; magazine&#x27;s year-end reader&#x27;s poll named Arden the Canadian celebrity most deserving of her own talk show.

Arden revealed that one of her brothers is serving a life sentence in prison and that her song &quot;Hangin&#x27; by a Thread&quot; is dedicated to him. Arden released her ninth album, &quot;Uncover Me,&quot; on February 6, 2007. This album was her first comprising cover songs exclusively, except for one original piece, &quot;Counterfeit Heart&quot;. This was followed by her &quot;Uncover Me Tour&quot; across Canada during the spring of 2007.

On the weekend of March 24, 2007, Arden was admitted to intensive care for heart-related concerns, diagnosed as Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, a condition commonly associated with acute stress and exhaustion.

She had a 2007 USA summer tour with Michael Bublé. In 2010, they also carried the Olympic torch. She co-wrote his 2013 song &quot;Close Your Eyes&quot;.

In September 2009, Arden released her tenth album, &quot;Free&quot;, and its first single, &quot;A Million Miles Away,&quot; in June. She then began a cross-country Canadian tour in November 2009, with some proceeds going to the &quot;Raise-a-Reader Concert Series&quot;.

In November 2010, Arden released her first ever live CD and DVD set, entitled &quot;Spotlight&quot;. Her latest autobiography, &quot;Falling Backwards&quot;, was released on November 1, 2011, along with a second album of cover songs, &quot;Uncover Me 2&quot;. Arden&#x27;s thirteenth album, &quot;Everything Almost&quot;, was released April 29, 2014, through Universal Music Canada. In October 2015, Arden released her fourteenth and first Christmas album, &quot;A Jann Arden Christmas&quot;.

In addition to her music, Arden has also written memoirs: &quot;If I Knew, Don&#x27;t You Think I&#x27;d Tell You?&quot; (2002), &quot;I&#x27;ll Tell You One Damn Thing, and That&#x27;s All I Know!&quot; (2004), &quot;Falling Backwards&quot; (2011) and &quot;Feeding My Mother&quot; (2017).

Published in 2017, Arden&#x27;s book &quot;Feeding My Mother: Comfort and Laughter in the Kitchen as My Mom Lives with Memory Loss&quot;, relates her involvement with her mother while the latter was experiencing Alzheimer&#x27;s. She discussed that era in the book: &quot;I am a mother to my mother. It&#x27;s a massive learning curve, not only because I didn&#x27;t have children of my own, but because there isn&#x27;t a handbook telling me what I should or shouldn&#x27;t be doing. Alzheimer&#x27;s is a different disease for every single person it inhabits. Everything is trial by fire.&quot;

Released in 2018, her album &quot;These are the Days&quot; includes 11 songs about the most difficult time in her life. In a CBC interview, she recalled, &quot;My mom and dad both were diagnosed with basically dementia and Alzheimer&#x27;s and a litany of other things. My health wasn&#x27;t great. I was floundering&quot;.

In 2018, she launched &quot;The Business of Life&quot;, a lifestyle podcast on topics such as entrepreneurship, motherhood, writing, relationships and navigating life challenges, which she cohosts with Arlene Dickinson.

In October 2018, it was announced that Arden had been confirmed as a celebrity judge on CTV&#x27;s music series, The Launch. While on the show, Arden mentored Winnipeg based singer-songwriter Olivia Lunny.

In a June 6, 2023, appearance on &quot;The Marilyn Denis Show&quot;, Arden announced that she had written a novel, which was slated for publication in November.

On January 31, 2025, she released &quot;Mixtape&quot;, an album of most 1990 pop covers that originally began as an idea for a collection of 1970s. Arden said her record label intervened early in the process and convinced her to reconsider the project with a more contempoary colleciton of popular hits. She said she hoped leftover songs from the original idea might later see a release.

==Personal life==

Arden has chosen to remain private about most of her personal life, including romantic relationships. In 2019, she told The Canadian Press while promoting her sitcon &quot;Jann&quot;, which features a fictional version of her in a relationship with a woman, that she considered herself &quot;fluid.&quot; She said earlier in her career she felt pressured to “stand under a word,” be it gay, straight or bisexual. She said she had chosen to keep her relationships private for the sake of her partners.

On social media, Arden has been more open about her love for animals. In 2012, she garnered some attention when VIA Rail kicked her and her dog off a train. She also posted about her dog Midi&#x27;s death in 2021.

In June 2018, CTV announced that Arden would star in &quot;Jann&quot;, a comedy television series based on a &quot;fictionalized version&quot; of her own life. The series premiered on March 20, 2019. During the promotion of the series, in which the fictionalized version of Arden is depicted as having recently broken up with a long-term female partner, Arden spoke openly to the press for the first time about having been in relationships with both men and women throughout her life. , &quot;Jann&quot; is Canada&#x27;s most popular comedy TV series, drawing more than one million viewers per episode. At the 8th Canadian Screen Awards in 2020, she received a nomination for Best Actress in a Comedy Series.

In 2020, Arden was named by the Canadian Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences as its 2020 inductee into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame; however, due to the cancellation of the Juno Awards of 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada, she actually received her induction tribute at the Juno Awards of 2021.

Other songs including &quot;Good Mother&quot; and &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know Me&quot; were also featured on the series.

<doc id="318378" wikidata="Q178692" url="?curid=318378" title="Crane (machine)">
<text>A crane is a machine used to move materials both vertically and horizontally, utilizing a system of a boom, hoist, wire ropes or chains, and sheaves for lifting and relocating heavy objects within the swing of its boom. The device uses one or more simple machines, such as the lever and pulley, to create mechanical advantage to do its work. Cranes are commonly employed in transportation for the loading and unloading of freight, in construction for the movement of materials, and in manufacturing for the assembling of heavy equipment.

The first known crane machine was the shaduf, a water-lifting device that was invented in ancient Mesopotamia (modern Iraq) and then appeared in ancient Egyptian technology. Construction cranes later appeared in ancient Greece, where they were powered by men or animals (such as donkeys), and used for the construction of buildings. Larger cranes were later developed in the Roman Empire, employing the use of human treadwheels, permitting the lifting of heavier weights. In the High Middle Ages, harbour cranes were introduced to load and unload ships and assist with their construction—some were built into stone towers for extra strength and stability. The earliest cranes were constructed from wood, but cast iron, iron and steel took over with the coming of the Industrial Revolution.

For many centuries, power was supplied by the physical exertion of men or animals, although hoists in watermills and windmills could be driven by the harnessed natural power. The first &quot;mechanical&quot; power was provided by steam engines, the earliest steam crane being introduced in the 18th or 19th century, with many remaining in use well into the late 20th century. Modern cranes usually use internal combustion engines or electric motors and hydraulic systems to provide a much greater lifting capability than was previously possible, although manual cranes are still utilized where the provision of power would be uneconomic.

There are many different types of cranes, each tailored to a specific use. Sizes range from the smallest jib cranes, used inside workshops, to the tallest tower cranes, used for constructing high buildings. Mini-cranes are also used for constructing high buildings, to facilitate constructions by reaching tight spaces. Large floating cranes are generally used to build oil rigs and salvage sunken ships.

Some lifting machines do not strictly fit the above definition of a crane, but are generally known as cranes, such as stacker cranes and loader cranes.

==Etymology==
Cranes were so called from the resemblance to the long neck of the bird, cf. , French &quot;grue&quot;.

==History==
=== Ancient Near East ===
The first type of crane machine was the shadouf, which had a lever mechanism and was used to lift water for irrigation. It was invented in Mesopotamia (modern Iraq) circa 3000 BC. The shadouf subsequently appeared in ancient Egyptian technology circa 2000 BC.

===Ancient Greece===

A crane for lifting heavy loads was developed by the Ancient Greeks in the late 6th century BC. The archaeological record shows that no later than c. 515 BC distinctive cuttings for both lifting tongs and lewis irons begin to appear on stone blocks of Greek temples. Since these holes point at the use of a lifting device, and since they are to be found either above the center of gravity of the block, or in pairs equidistant from a point over the center of gravity, they are regarded by archaeologists as the positive evidence required for the existence of the crane.

The introduction of the winch and pulley hoist soon led to a widespread replacement of ramps as the main means of vertical motion. For the next 200 years, Greek building sites witnessed a sharp reduction in the weights handled, as the new lifting technique made the use of several smaller stones more practical than fewer larger ones. In contrast to the archaic period with its pattern of ever-increasing block sizes, Greek temples of the classical age like the Parthenon invariably featured stone blocks weighing less than 15–20 metric tons. Also, the practice of erecting large monolithic columns was practically abandoned in favour of using several column drums.

Although the exact circumstances of the shift from the ramp to the crane technology remain unclear, it has been argued that the volatile social and political conditions of Greece were more suitable to the employment of small, professional construction teams than of large bodies of unskilled labour, making the crane preferable to the Greek polis over the more labour-intensive ramp which had been the norm in the autocratic societies of Egypt or Assyria.

The first unequivocal literary evidence for the existence of the compound pulley system appears in the &quot;Mechanical Problems&quot; (&quot;Mech&quot;. 18, 853a32–853b13) attributed to Aristotle (384–322 BC), but perhaps composed at a slightly later date. Around the same time, block sizes at Greek temples began to match their archaic predecessors again, indicating that the more sophisticated compound pulley must have found its way to Greek construction sites by then.

===Roman Empire===

The heyday of the crane in ancient times came during the Roman Empire, when construction activity soared and buildings reached enormous dimensions. The Romans adopted the Greek crane and developed it further. There is much available information about their lifting techniques, thanks to rather lengthy accounts by the engineers Vitruvius (&quot;De Architectura&quot; 10.2, 1–10) and Heron of Alexandria (&quot;Mechanica&quot; 3.2–5). There are also two surviving reliefs of Roman treadwheel cranes, with the Haterii tombstone from the late first century AD being particularly detailed.

The simplest Roman crane, the &quot;trispastos&quot;, consisted of a double-beam jib, a winch, a rope, and a block containing three pulleys. Having thus a mechanical advantage of 3:1, it has been calculated that a single man working the winch could raise (3 pulleys x = 150), assuming that represent the maximum effort a man can exert over a longer time period. Heavier crane types featured five pulleys (&quot;pentaspastos&quot;) or, in case of the largest one, a set of three by five pulleys (&quot;Polyspastos&quot;) and came with two, three or four masts, depending on the maximum load. The &quot;polyspastos&quot;, when worked by four men at both sides of the winch, could readily lift (3 ropes x 5 pulleys x 4 men x = ). If the winch was replaced by a treadwheel, the maximum load could be doubled to at only half the crew, since the treadwheel possesses a much bigger mechanical advantage due to its larger diameter. This meant that, in comparison to the construction of the ancient Egyptian pyramids, where about 50 men were needed to move a 2.5 ton stone block up the ramp ( per person), the lifting capability of the Roman &quot;polyspastos&quot; proved to be &quot;60 times&quot; higher ( per person).

However, numerous extant Roman buildings which feature much heavier stone blocks than those handled by the &quot;polyspastos&quot; indicate that the overall lifting capability of the Romans went far beyond that of any single crane. At the temple of Jupiter at Baalbek, for instance, the architrave blocks weigh up to 60 tons each, and one corner cornice block even over 100 tons, all of them raised to a height of about . In Rome, the capital block of Trajan&#x27;s Column weighs 53.3 tons, which had to be lifted to a height of about (see construction of Trajan&#x27;s Column).

It is assumed that Roman engineers lifted these extraordinary weights by two measures (see picture below for comparable Renaissance technique): First, as suggested by Heron, a lifting tower was set up, whose four masts were arranged in the shape of a quadrangle with parallel sides, not unlike a siege tower, but with the column in the middle of the structure (&quot;Mechanica&quot; 3.5). Second, a multitude of capstans were placed on the ground around the tower, for, although having a lower leverage ratio than treadwheels, capstans could be set up in higher numbers and run by more men (and, moreover, by draught animals). This use of multiple capstans is also described by Ammianus Marcellinus (17.4.15) in connection with the lifting of the Lateranense obelisk in the Circus Maximus (c. 357 AD). The maximum lifting capability of a single capstan can be established by the number of lewis iron holes bored into the monolith. In case of the Baalbek architrave blocks, which weigh between 55 and 60 tons, eight extant holes suggest an allowance of 7.5 ton per lewis iron, that is per capstan. Lifting such heavy weights in a concerted action required a great amount of coordination between the work groups applying the force to the capstans.
===Middle Ages===
During the High Middle Ages, the treadwheel crane was reintroduced on a large scale after the technology had fallen into disuse in western Europe with the demise of the Western Roman Empire. The earliest reference to a treadwheel (&quot;magna rota&quot;) reappears in archival literature in France about 1225, followed by an illuminated depiction in a manuscript of probably also French origin dating to 1240. In navigation, the earliest uses of harbor cranes are documented for Utrecht in 1244, Antwerp in 1263, Bruges in 1288 and Hamburg in 1291, while in England the treadwheel is not recorded before 1331.
Generally, vertical transport could be done more safely and inexpensively by cranes than by customary methods. Typical areas of application were harbors, mines, and, in particular, building sites where the treadwheel crane played a pivotal role in the construction of the lofty Gothic cathedrals. Nevertheless, both archival and pictorial sources of the time suggest that newly introduced machines like treadwheels or wheelbarrows did not completely replace more labor-intensive methods like ladders, hods and handbarrows. Rather, old and new machinery continued to coexist on medieval construction sites and harbors.

Apart from treadwheels, medieval depictions also show cranes to be powered manually by windlasses with radiating spokes, cranks and by the 15th century also by windlasses shaped like a ship&#x27;s wheel. To smooth out irregularities of impulse and get over &#x27;dead-spots&#x27; in the lifting process flywheels are known to be in use as early as 1123.

The exact process by which the treadwheel crane was reintroduced is not recorded, although its return to construction sites has undoubtedly to be viewed in close connection with the simultaneous rise of Gothic architecture. The reappearance of the treadwheel crane may have resulted from a technological development of the windlass from which the treadwheel structurally and mechanically evolved. Alternatively, the medieval treadwheel may represent a deliberate reinvention of its Roman counterpart drawn from Vitruvius&#x27; &quot;De architectura&quot; which was available in many monastic libraries. Its reintroduction may have been inspired, as well, by the observation of the labor-saving qualities of the waterwheel with which early treadwheels shared many structural similarities.

====Structure and placement====
The medieval treadwheel was a large wooden wheel turning around a central shaft with a treadway wide enough for two workers walking side by side. While the earlier &#x27;compass-arm&#x27; wheel had spokes directly driven into the central shaft, the more advanced &quot;clasp-arm&quot; type featured arms arranged as chords to the wheel rim, giving the possibility of using a thinner shaft and providing thus a greater mechanical advantage.
Contrary to a popularly held belief, cranes on medieval building sites were neither placed on the extremely lightweight scaffolding used at the time nor on the thin walls of the Gothic churches which were incapable of supporting the weight of both hoisting machine and load. Rather, cranes were placed in the initial stages of construction on the ground, often within the building. When a new floor was completed, and massive tie beams of the roof connected the walls, the crane was dismantled and reassembled on the roof beams from where it was moved from bay to bay during construction of the vaults. Thus, the crane &quot;grew&quot; and &quot;wandered&quot; with the building with the result that today all extant construction cranes in England are found in church towers above the vaulting and below the roof, where they remained after building construction for bringing material for repairs aloft.

Less frequently, medieval illuminations also show cranes mounted on the outside of walls with the stand of the machine secured to putlogs.

====Mechanics and operation====

In contrast to modern cranes, medieval cranes and hoists — much like their counterparts in Greece and Rome — were primarily capable of a vertical lift, and not used to move loads for a considerable distance horizontally as well. Accordingly, lifting work was organized at the workplace in a different way than today. In building construction, for example, it is assumed that the crane lifted the stone blocks either from the bottom directly into place, or from a place opposite the centre of the wall from where it could deliver the blocks for two teams working at each end of the wall. Additionally, the crane master who usually gave orders at the treadwheel workers from outside the crane was able to manipulate the movement laterally by a small rope attached to the load. Slewing cranes which allowed a rotation of the load and were thus particularly suited for dockside work appeared as early as 1340. While ashlar blocks were directly lifted by sling, lewis or devil&#x27;s clamp (German &quot;Teufelskralle&quot;), other objects were placed before in containers like pallets, baskets, wooden boxes or barrels.

It is noteworthy that medieval cranes rarely featured ratchets or brakes to forestall the load from running backward. This curious absence is explained by the high friction force exercised by medieval tread-wheels which normally prevented the wheel from accelerating beyond control.

====Harbour usage====

According to the &quot;present state of knowledge&quot; unknown in antiquity, stationary harbor cranes are considered a new development of the Middle Ages. The typical harbor crane was a pivoting structure equipped with double treadwheels. These cranes were placed docksides for the loading and unloading of cargo where they replaced or complemented older lifting methods like see-saws, winches and yards.

Two different types of harbor cranes can be identified with a varying geographical distribution: While gantry cranes, which pivoted on a central vertical axle, were commonly found at the Flemish and Dutch coastside, German sea and inland harbors typically featured tower cranes where the windlass and treadwheels were situated in a solid tower with only jib arm and roof rotating. Dockside cranes were not adopted in the Mediterranean region and the highly developed Italian ports where authorities continued to rely on the more labor-intensive method of unloading goods by ramps beyond the Middle Ages.

Unlike construction cranes where the work speed was determined by the relatively slow progress of the masons, harbor cranes usually featured double treadwheels to speed up loading. The two treadwheels whose diameter is estimated to be 4 m or larger were attached to each side of the axle and rotated together. Their capacity was 2–3 tons, which apparently corresponded to the customary size of marine cargo. Today, according to one survey, fifteen treadwheel harbor cranes from pre-industrial times are still extant throughout Europe. Some harbour cranes were specialised at mounting masts to newly built sailing ships, such as in Gdańsk, Cologne and Bremen. Beside these stationary cranes, floating cranes, which could be flexibly deployed in the whole port basin came into use by the 14th century.

A sheer hulk (or shear hulk) was used in shipbuilding and repair as a floating crane in the days of sailing ships, primarily to place the lower masts of a ship under construction or repair. Booms known as sheers were attached to the base of a hulk&#x27;s lower masts or beam, supported from the top of those masts. Blocks and tackle were then used in such tasks as placing or removing the lower masts of the vessel under construction or repair. These lower masts were the largest and most massive single timbers aboard a ship, and erecting them without the assistance of either a sheer hulk or land-based masting sheer was extremely difficult.

The concept of sheer hulks originated with the Royal Navy in the 1690s, and persisted in Britain until the early nineteenth century. Most sheer hulks were decommissioned warships; &quot;Chatham&quot;, built in 1694, was the first of only three purpose-built vessels. There were at least six sheer hulks in service in Britain at any time throughout the 1700s. The concept spread to France in the 1740s with the commissioning of a sheer hulk at the port of Rochefort.

===Early modern age===

A lifting tower similar to that of the ancient Romans was used to great effect by the Renaissance architect Domenico Fontana in 1586 to relocate the 361 t heavy Vatican obelisk in Rome. From his report, it becomes obvious that the coordination of the lift between the various pulling teams required a considerable amount of concentration and discipline, since, if the force was not applied evenly, the excessive stress on the ropes would make them rupture.

Cranes were also used domestically during this period. The chimney or fireplace crane was used to swing pots and kettles over the fire and the height was adjusted by a trammel.

===Industrial revolution===

With the onset of the Industrial Revolution the first modern cranes were installed at harbours for loading cargo. In 1838, the industrialist and businessman William Armstrong designed a water-powered hydraulic crane. His design used a ram in a closed cylinder that was forced down by a pressurized fluid entering the cylinder and a valve regulated the amount of fluid intake relative to the load on the crane. This mechanism, the hydraulic jigger, then pulled on a chain to lift the load.

In 1845 a scheme was set in motion to provide piped water from distant reservoirs to the households of Newcastle. Armstrong was involved in this scheme and he proposed to Newcastle Corporation that the excess water pressure in the lower part of town could be used to power one of his hydraulic cranes for the loading of coal onto barges at the Quayside. He claimed that his invention would do the job faster and more cheaply than conventional cranes. The corporation agreed to his suggestion, and the experiment proved so successful that three more hydraulic cranes were installed on the Quayside.

The success of his hydraulic crane led Armstrong to establish the Elswick works at Newcastle, to produce his hydraulic machinery for cranes and bridges in 1847. His company soon received orders for hydraulic cranes from Edinburgh and Northern Railways and from Liverpool Docks, as well as for hydraulic machinery for dock gates in Grimsby. The company expanded from a workforce of 300 and an annual production of 45 cranes in 1850, to almost 4,000 workers producing over 100 cranes per year by the early 1860s.

Armstrong spent the next few decades constantly improving his crane design; his most significant innovation was the hydraulic accumulator. Where water pressure was not available on site for the use of hydraulic cranes, Armstrong often built high water towers to provide a supply of water at pressure. However, when supplying cranes for use at New Holland on the Humber Estuary, he was unable to do this, because the foundations consisted of sand. He eventually produced the hydraulic accumulator, a cast-iron cylinder fitted with a plunger supporting a very heavy weight. The plunger would slowly be raised, drawing in water, until the downward force of the weight was sufficient to force the water below it into pipes at great pressure. This invention allowed much larger quantities of water to be forced through pipes at a constant pressure, thus increasing the crane&#x27;s load capacity considerably.

One of his cranes, commissioned by the Italian Navy in 1883 and in use until the mid-1950s, is still standing in Venice, where it is now in a state of disrepair.

==Mechanical principles==

There are three major considerations in the design of cranes. First, the crane must be able to lift the weight of the load; second, the crane must not topple; third, the crane must not fail structurally.

===Stability===
For stability, the sum of all moments about the base of the crane must be close to zero so that the crane does not overturn. In practice, the magnitude of load that is permitted to be lifted (called the &quot;rated load&quot; in the US) is some value less than the load that will cause the crane to tip, thus providing a safety margin.

Under United States standards for mobile cranes, the stability-limited rated load for a crawler crane is 75% of the tipping load. The stability-limited rated load for a mobile crane supported on outriggers is 85% of the tipping load. These requirements, along with additional safety-related aspects of crane design, are established by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in the volume ASME B30.5-2018 &quot;Mobile and Locomotive Cranes&quot;.

Standards for cranes mounted on ships or offshore platforms are somewhat stricter because of the dynamic load on the crane due to vessel motion. Additionally, the stability of the vessel or platform must be considered.

For stationary pedestal or kingpost mounted cranes, the moment produced by the boom, jib, and load is resisted by the pedestal base or kingpost. Stress within the base must be less than the yield stress of the material or the crane will fail.
===Dynamic Lift Factor===
==== Overview ====
The dynamic lift factor (DLF), also known as the design dynamic factor, is a critical parameter in the crane design and operation. It accounts for the dynamic effects that can increase the load on a crane&#x27;s structure and components during lifting operations. These effects include:

* Hoisting acceleration and deceleration of the load, which is a significant factor;
* Crane movement such as slewing or luffing;
* Load swinging;
* Wind forces acting on the crane, the load and the rigging; and
* Operator error or other unexpected events.
The DLF for a new crane design can be determined with analytical calculations and mathematical models following the relevant design specifications. If available, data from previous tests of similar crane types can be used to estimate the DLF. More sophisticated methods, such as finite element analysis or other simulation techniques, may also be used to model the crane&#x27;s behavior under various loading conditions, as deemed appropriate by the designer or certifying authority.To verify the actual DLF, control load tests can be conducted on the completed crane using instrumentation such as load cells, accelerometers, and strain gauges. This process is usually part of the crane&#x27;s type approval. 

In offshore lifting, where the crane and/or lifted object are on a floating vessel, the DLF is higher compared to onshore lifts because of the additional movement caused by wave action. This motion introduces additional acceleration forces and necessitates increased hoisting and lowering speeds to minimize the risk of repeated collisions when the load is near the deck. Additionally, the DLF increases further when lifting objects that are underwater or going through the splash zone. The wind speeds tend to be higher than onshore as well. 

Though actual DLF values are determined through crane tests under representative operational conditions, design specifications can be used for guidance. The values vary according to the specification, which reflects the type of crane and its usage. Here are some example typical values: 

* Jib cranes typically have a lower DLF (formula_1) compared to traveling gantry cranes (formula_2) because they are stiffer;
* For grab cranes, the DLF can increase by 20% to 30% reflecting the shock loads caused by the release of the lifted material; and
* The DLF generally decreases as the mass of the lifted object increases, as cranes tend to operate at lower velocities with heavier loads to ensure safety and stability. For offshore lifts, the DLF typically decreases from 1.3 at 100 tonnes to 1.1 at 2500 tonnes. 

==== Formulas ====
The methods for determining the DLF vary in the different crane specifications. The following formulas are examples from one specification. 

The working load (suspended load) is the total weight that a crane is designed to safely lift under normal operating conditions. It is

formula_3

where 
:formula_4 is the working load,
:formula_5 is the acceleration of gravity,
:formula_6 is the maximum lifted mass, which is also called the crane working load limit (WLL) or safe working load (SWL), and
:formula_7 is the mass of lifting appliances or parts of the crane that move with the lifted mass.

The DLF is then used as a multiplier to determine the force applied to the crane structure and componentsformula_8where

:formula_9 is the design force, and
:formula_10 is the DLF.
The DLF can then be calculated usingformula_11where 
:formula_12 is relative velocity between lifted object and hook at the time of pick-up, and
:formula_13 is the stiffness of the crane system at the hook.
The relative velocity is dependent on the crane&#x27;s operational requirements and the system stiffness at the hook can be determined by calculation or load deflection tests.

=== Construction ===
==== Truck-mounted ====
The most basic truck-mounted crane configuration is a &quot;boom truck&quot; or &quot;lorry loader&quot;, which features a rear-mounted rotating telescopic-boom crane mounted on a commercial truck chassis.

Larger, heavier duty, purpose-built &quot;truck-mounted&quot; cranes are constructed in two parts: the carrier, often called the &quot;lower&quot;, and the lifting component, which includes the boom, called the &quot;upper&quot;. These are mated together through a turntable, allowing the upper to swing from side to side. These modern hydraulic truck cranes are usually single-engine machines, with the same engine powering the undercarriage and the crane. The upper is usually powered via hydraulics run through the turntable from the pump mounted on the lower. In older model designs of hydraulic truck cranes, there were two engines. One in the lower pulled the crane down the road and ran a hydraulic pump for the outriggers and jacks. The one in the upper ran the upper through a hydraulic pump of its own. Many older operators favor the two-engine system due to leaking seals in the turntable of aging newer design cranes. Hiab invented the world&#x27;s first hydraulic truck mounted crane in 1947. The name, Hiab, comes from the commonly used abbreviation of Hydrauliska Industri AB, a company founded in Hudiksvall, Sweden 1944 by Eric Sundin, a ski manufacturer who saw a way to utilize a truck&#x27;s engine to power loader cranes through the use of hydraulics. 

Generally, these cranes are able to travel on highways, eliminating the need for special equipment to transport the crane unless weight or other size constrictions are in place such as local laws. If this is the case, most larger cranes are equipped with either special trailers to help spread the load over more axles or are able to disassemble to meet requirements. An example is counterweights. Often a crane will be followed by another truck hauling the counterweights that are removed for travel. In addition some cranes are able to remove the entire upper. However, this is usually only an issue in a large crane and mostly done with a conventional crane such as a Link-Belt HC-238. When working on the job site, outriggers are extended horizontally from the chassis then vertically to level and stabilize the crane while stationary and hoisting. Many truck cranes have slow-travelling capability (a few miles per hour) while suspending a load. Great care must be taken not to swing the load sideways from the direction of travel, as most anti-tipping stability then lies in the stiffness of the chassis suspension. Most cranes of this type also have moving counterweights for stabilization beyond that provided by the outriggers. Loads suspended directly aft are the most stable, since most of the weight of the crane acts as a counterweight. Factory-calculated charts (or electronic safeguards) are used by crane operators to determine the maximum safe loads for stationary (outriggered) work as well as (on-rubber) loads and travelling speeds.

Truck cranes range in lifting capacity from about to about . Although most only rotate about 180 degrees, the more expensive truck mounted cranes can turn a full 360 degrees.
====Loader====

A loader crane (also called a &quot;knuckle-boom crane&quot; or &quot;articulating crane&quot;) is an hydraulically powered articulated arm fitted to a truck or trailer, and is used for loading/unloading the vehicle cargo. The numerous jointed sections can be folded into a small space when the crane is not in use. One or more of the sections may be telescopic. Often the crane will have a degree of automation and be able to unload or stow itself without an operator&#x27;s instruction.

Unlike most cranes, the operator must move around the vehicle to be able to view his load; hence modern cranes may be fitted with a portable cabled or radio-linked control system to supplement the crane-mounted hydraulic control levers.

In the United Kingdom and Canada, this type of crane is often known colloquially as a &quot;Hiab&quot;, partly because this manufacturer invented the loader crane and was first into the UK market, and partly because the distinctive name was displayed prominently on the boom arm.

A rolloader crane is a loader crane mounted on a chassis with wheels. This chassis can ride on the trailer. Because the crane can move on the trailer, it can be a light crane, so the trailer is allowed to transport more goods.

====Telescopic====
A telescopic crane has a boom that consists of a number of tubes fitted one inside the other. A hydraulic cylinder or other powered mechanism extends or retracts the tubes to increase or decrease the total length of the boom. These types of booms are often used for short term construction projects, rescue jobs, lifting boats in and out of the water, etc. The relative compactness of telescopic booms makes them adaptable for many mobile applications.

Though not all telescopic cranes are mobile cranes, many of them are truck-mounted.

A telescopic tower crane has a telescopic mast and often a superstructure (jib) on top so that it functions as a tower crane. Some telescopic tower cranes also have a telescopic jib.

==== Rough-terrain ====

A rough terrain crane has a mounted on an undercarriage atop four rubber tires that is designed for off-road pick-and-carry operations. Outriggers are used to level and stabilize the crane for hoisting.

These telescopic cranes are single-engine machines, with the same engine powering the undercarriage and the crane, similar to a crawler crane. The engine is usually mounted in the undercarriage rather than in the upper, as with crawler crane. Most have 4 wheel drive and 4 wheel steering for traversing tighter and slicker terrain than a standard truck crane, with less site prep.

==== All-terrain ====

An all-terrain crane is a hybrid combining the roadability of a truck-mounted and on-site maneuverability of a rough-terrain crane. It can both travel at speed on public roads and maneuver on rough terrain at the job site using all-wheel and crab steering.

AT&#x27;s have 2–12 axles and are designed for lifting loads up to .

==== Crawler ====
Main article: Lattice boom crawler crane
A crawler crane has its boom mounted on an undercarriage fitted with a set of crawler tracks that provide both stability and mobility. Crawler cranes range in lifting capacity from about as seen from the XGC88000 crawler crane.

The main advantage of a crawler crane is its ready mobility and use, since the crane is able to operate on sites with minimal improvement and stable on its tracks without outriggers. Wide tracks spread the weight out over a great area and are far better than wheels at traversing soft ground without sinking in. A crawler crane is also capable of traveling with a load. Its main disadvantage is its weight, making it difficult and expensive to transport. Typically a large crawler must be disassembled at least into boom and cab and moved by trucks, rail cars or ships to its next location.

==== Pick-and-carry ====
A pick and carry crane is similar to a mobile crane in that is designed to travel on public roads; however, pick and carry cranes have no stabiliser legs or outriggers and are designed to lift the load and carry it to its destination, within a small radius, then be able to drive to the next job. Pick and carry cranes are popular in Australia, where large distances are encountered between job sites. One popular manufacturer in Australia was Franna, who have since been bought by Terex, and now all pick and carry cranes are commonly called &quot;Frannas&quot;, even though they may be made by other manufacturers. Nearly every medium- and large-sized crane company in Australia has at least one and many companies have fleets of these cranes. The capacity range is between as a maximum lift, although this is much less as the load gets further from the front of the crane. Pick and carry cranes have displaced the work usually completed by smaller truck cranes, as the set-up time is much quicker. Many steel fabrication yards also use pick and carry cranes, as they can &quot;walk&quot; with fabricated steel sections and place these where required with relative ease. 

Smaller pick and carry cranes may be based on an articulated tractor chassis, with the boom mounted over the front wheels. In Australia these are popularly known as &quot;wobbly cranes&quot;.

==== Carry-deck ====
A carry deck crane is a small 4 wheel crane with a 360-degree rotating boom placed right in the centre and an operators cab located at one end under this boom. The rear section houses the engine and the area above the wheels is a flat deck. Very much an American invention the Carry deck can hoist a load in a confined space and then load it on the deck space around the cab or engine and subsequently move to another site. The Carry Deck principle is the American version of the pick and carry crane and both allow the load to be moved by the crane over short distances.

==== Telescopic handler ====
Telescopic handlers are forklift-like trucks that have a set of forks mounted on a telescoping extendable boom like a crane. Early telescopic handlers only lifted in one direction and did not rotate; however, several of the manufacturers have designed telescopic handlers that rotate 360 degrees through a turntable and these machines look almost identical to the Rough Terrain Crane. These new 360-degree telescopic handler/crane models have outriggers or stabiliser legs that must be lowered before lifting; however, their design has been simplified so that they can be more quickly deployed. These machines are often used to handle pallets of bricks and install frame trusses on many new building sites and they have eroded much of the work for small telescopic truck cranes. Many of the world&#x27;s armed forces have purchased telescopic handlers and some of these are the much more expensive fully rotating types. Their off-road capability and their on site versatility to unload pallets using forks, or lift like a crane make them a valuable piece of machinery.

==== Block-setting crane ====

A block-setting crane is a form of crane. They were used for installing the large stone blocks used to build breakwaters, moles and stone piers.

==== Tower ====
Tower cranes are a modern form of balance crane that consist of the same basic parts. Fixed to the ground on a concrete slab (and sometimes attached to the sides of structures), tower cranes often give the best combination of height and lifting capacity and are used in the construction of tall buildings. The base is then attached to the mast which gives the crane its height. Further, the mast is attached to the slewing unit (gear and motor) that allows the crane to rotate. On top of the slewing unit there are three main parts which are: the long horizontal jib (working arm), shorter counter-jib, and the operator&#x27;s cab.

Optimization of tower crane location in the construction sites has an important effect on material transportation costs of a project, but site operators need to ensure they assess where the jib will oversail the property of other landowners and tenants as it rotates over the site. Under English law a landowner also owns the airspace above their property and developers will need to agree terms with adjacent property owners before oversailing their land.

The long horizontal jib is the part of the crane that carries the load. The counter-jib carries a counterweight, usually of concrete blocks, while the jib suspends the load to and from the center of the crane. The crane operator either sits in a cab at the top of the tower or controls the crane by radio remote control from the ground. In the first case the operator&#x27;s cab is most usually located at the top of the tower attached to the turntable, but can be mounted on the jib, or partway down the tower. The lifting hook is operated by the crane operator using electric motors to manipulate wire rope cables through a system of sheaves. The hook is located on the long horizontal arm to lift the load which also contains its motor.

In order to hook and unhook the loads, the operator usually works in conjunction with a signaller (known as a &quot;dogger&quot;, &quot;rigger&quot; or &quot;swamper&quot;). They are most often in radio contact, and always use hand signals. The rigger or dogger directs the schedule of lifts for the crane, and is responsible for the safety of the rigging and loads.

Tower cranes can achieve a height under hook of over 100 metres.
===== Components =====
Tower cranes are used extensively in construction and other industry to hoist and move materials. There are many types of tower cranes. Although they are different in type, the main parts are the same, as follows:
* Mast: the main supporting tower of the crane. It is made of steel trussed sections that are connected together during installation.
* Slewing unit: the slewing unit sits at the top of the mast. This is the engine that enables the crane to rotate.
* Operating cabin: on most tower cranes the operating cabin sits just above the slewing unit. It contains the operating controls, load-movement indicator system (LMI), scale, anemometer, etc.
* Jib: the jib, or operating arm, extends horizontally from the crane. A &quot;luffing&quot; jib is able to move up and down; a fixed jib has a rolling trolley car that runs along the underside to move loads horizontally.
* Counter jib: holds counterweights, hoist motor, hoist drum and the electronics. (In many older tower crane designs the hoisting devices and electronics were located in the mast foot.) 
* Hoist winch: the hoist winch assembly consists of the hoist winch (motor, gearbox, hoist drum, hoist rope, and brakes), the hoist motor controller, and supporting components, such as the platform. Many tower cranes have transmissions with two or more speeds.
* Hook: the hook is used to connect the material to the crane, suspended from the hoist rope either at the tip (on luffing jib cranes) or routed through the trolley (on hammerhead cranes).
* Weights: Large, moveable concrete counterweights are mounted toward the rear of the counterdeck, to compensate for the weight of the goods lifted and keep the center of gravity over the supporting tower.
===== Assembly =====
A tower crane is usually assembled by a telescopic jib (mobile) crane of greater reach (also see &quot;self-erecting crane&quot; below) and in the case of tower cranes that have risen while constructing very tall skyscrapers, a smaller crane (or derrick) will often be lifted to the roof of the completed tower to dismantle the tower crane afterwards, which may be more difficult than the installation.

Tower cranes can be operated by remote control, removing the need for the crane operator to sit in a cab atop the crane.

===== Operation =====
Each model and distinctive style of tower crane has a predetermined lifting chart that can be applied to any radii available, depending on its configuration. Similar to a mobile crane, a tower crane may lift an object of far greater mass closer to its center of rotation than at its maximum radius. An operator manipulates several levers and pedals to control each function of the crane.

===== Safety =====
When a tower crane is used in proximity to buildings, roads, power lines, or other tower cranes, a tower crane anti-collision system is used. This operator support system reduces the risk of a dangerous interaction occurring between a tower crane and another structure.

In some countries, such as France, tower crane anti-collision systems are mandatory.

===== Self-erecting tower cranes =====
Generally a type of pedestrian operated tower crane, self-erecting tower cranes are transported as a single unit and can be assembled by a qualified technician without the assistance of a larger mobile crane. They are bottom slewing cranes that stand on outriggers, have no counter jib, have their counterweights and ballast at the base of the mast, cannot climb themselves, have a reduced capacity compared to standard tower cranes, and seldom have an operator&#x27;s cabin.

In some cases, smaller self-erecting tower cranes may have axles permanently fitted to the tower section to make maneuvering the crane onsite easier.

Tower cranes can also use a hydraulic-powered jack frame to raise themselves to add new tower sections without any additional other cranes assisting beyond the initial assembly stage. This is how it can grow to nearly any height needed to build the tallest skyscrapers when tied to a building as the building rises. The maximum unsupported height of a tower crane is around 265 ft. For a video of a crane getting taller, see &quot;Crane Building Itself&quot; on YouTube.

For another animation of such a crane in use, see &quot;SAS Tower Construction Simulation&quot; on YouTube. Here, the crane is used to erect a scaffold, which, in turn, contains a gantry to lift sections of a bridge spire.

==== Climbing crane ====
Many tower cranes are designed to &quot;jump&quot; in stages, effectively lifting themselves to the next level. A specialty example of a climbing crane was introduced by Lagerwey Wind and Enercon to construct a wind turbine tower, where instead of erecting a large crane a smaller climbing crane can raise itself with the structure&#x27;s construction, lift the generator housing to its top, add the rotor blades, then climb down.

=== Cargo handling ===
====Rubber-tyred gantry crane====

==== Reach stacker ====

A reach stacker is a vehicle used for handling intermodal cargo containers in small terminals or medium-sized ports. Reach stackers are able to transport a container short distances very quickly and pile them in various rows depending on its access.

==== Sidelifter ====
A sidelifter crane is a road-going truck or semi-trailer, able to hoist and transport ISO standard containers. Container lift is done with parallel crane-like hoists, which can lift a container from the ground or from a railway vehicle.

=====Travel lift=====
A travel lift (also called a boat gantry crane, or boat crane) is a crane with two rectangular side panels joined by a single spanning beam at the top of one end. The crane is mobile with four groups of steerable wheels, one on each corner. These cranes allow boats with masts or tall super structures to be removed from the water and transported around docks or marinas. Not to be confused mechanical device used for transferring a vessel between two levels of water, which is also called a boat lift.

===== Straddle carrier =====
A Straddle carrier moves and stacks intermodal containers.

=== Industrial ===

====Ring====

Ring cranes are some of the largest and heaviest land-based cranes ever designed. A ring-shaped track support the main superstructure allowing for extremely heavy loads (up to thousands of tonnes).

====Hammerhead====
The &quot;hammerhead&quot;, or giant cantilever, crane is a fixed-jib crane consisting of a steel-braced tower on which revolves a large, horizontal, double cantilever; the forward part of this cantilever or jib carries the lifting trolley, the jib is extended backwards in order to form a support for the machinery and counterbalancing weight. In addition to the motions of lifting and revolving, there is provided a so-called &quot;racking&quot; motion, by which the lifting trolley, with the load suspended, can be moved in and out along the jib without altering the level of the load. Such horizontal movement of the load is a marked feature of later crane design. These cranes are generally constructed in large sizes and can lift up to 350 tons.

The design of &quot;Hammerkran&quot; evolved first in Germany around the turn of the 19th century and was adopted and developed for use in British shipyards to support the battleship construction program from 1904 to 1914. The ability of the hammerhead crane to lift heavy weights was useful for installing large pieces of battleships such as armour plate and gun barrels. Giant cantilever cranes were also installed in naval shipyards in Japan and in the United States. The British government also installed a giant cantilever crane at the Singapore Naval Base (1938) and later a copy of the crane was installed at Garden Island Naval Dockyard in Sydney (1951). These cranes provided repair support for the battle fleet operating far from Great Britain.

In the British Empire, the engineering firm Sir William Arrol &amp; Co. was the principal manufacturer of giant cantilever cranes; the company built a total of fourteen. Among the sixty built in the world, few remain; seven in England and Scotland of about fifteen worldwide.

The Titan Clydebank is one of the four Scottish cranes on the River Clyde and preserved as a tourist attraction.

====Level luffing====
Normally a crane with a hinged jib will tend to have its hook also move up and down as the jib moves (or &quot;luffs&quot;). A level luffing crane is a crane of this common design, but with an extra mechanism to keep the hook at the same level when the jib is pivoted in or out.

====Overhead====

An overhead crane, also known as a bridge crane, is a type of crane where the hook-and-line mechanism runs along a horizontal beam that itself runs along two widely separated rails. Often it is in a long factory building and runs along rails along the building&#x27;s two long walls. It is similar to a gantry crane. Overhead cranes typically consist of either a single beam or a double beam construction. These can be built using typical steel beams or a more complex box girder type. Pictured on the right is a single bridge box girder crane with the hoist and system operated with a control pendant. Double girder bridge are more typical when needing heavier capacity systems from 10 tons and above. The advantage of the box girder type configuration results in a system that has a lower deadweight yet a stronger overall system integrity. Also included would be a hoist to lift the items, the bridge, which spans the area covered by the crane, and a trolley to move along the bridge.

The most common overhead crane use is in the steel industry. At every step of the manufacturing process, until it leaves a factory as a finished product, steel is handled by an overhead crane. Raw materials are poured into a furnace by crane, hot steel is stored for cooling by an overhead crane, the finished coils are lifted and loaded onto trucks and trains by overhead crane, and the fabricator or stamper uses an overhead crane to handle the steel in his factory. The automobile industry uses overhead cranes for handling of raw materials. Smaller workstation cranes handle lighter loads in a work-area, such as CNC mill or saw.

Almost all paper mills use bridge cranes for regular maintenance requiring removal of heavy press rolls and other equipment. The bridge cranes are used in the initial construction of paper machines because they facilitate installation of the heavy cast iron paper drying drums and other massive equipment, some weighing as much as 70 tons.

In many instances the cost of a bridge crane can be largely offset with savings from not renting mobile cranes in the construction of a facility that uses a lot of heavy process equipment.

This electric overhead traveling crane is most common type of overhead crane, found in many factories. These cranes are electrically operated by a control pendant, radio/IR remote pendant, or from an operator cabin attached to the crane.
====Gantry====

A gantry crane has a hoist in a fixed machinery house or on a trolley that runs horizontally along rails, usually fitted on a single beam (mono-girder) or two beams (twin-girder). The crane frame is supported on a gantry system with equalized beams and wheels that run on the gantry rail, usually perpendicular to the trolley travel direction. These cranes come in all sizes, and some can move very heavy loads, particularly the extremely large examples used in shipyards or industrial installations. A special version is the container crane (or &quot;Portainer&quot; crane, named by the first manufacturer), designed for loading and unloading ship-borne containers at a port.

Most container cranes are of this type.
==== Jib ====
A jib crane is a type of crane - not to be confused with a crane rigged with a jib to extend its main boom - where a horizontal member (&quot;jib&quot; or &quot;boom&quot;), supporting a moveable hoist, is fixed to a wall or to a floor-mounted pillar. Jib cranes are used in industrial premises and on military vehicles. The jib may swing through an arc, to give additional lateral movement, or be fixed. Similar cranes, often known simply as hoists, were fitted on the top floor of warehouse buildings to enable goods to be lifted to all floors.

====Bulk-handling====
Bulk-handling cranes are designed from the outset to carry a shell grab or bucket, rather than using a hook and a sling. They are used for bulk cargoes, such as coal, minerals, scrap metal etc.

====Stacker====
A crane with a forklift type mechanism used in automated (computer-controlled) warehouses (known as an automated storage and retrieval system (AS/RS)). The crane moves on a track in an aisle of the warehouse. The fork can be raised or lowered to any of the levels of a storage rack and can be extended into the rack to store and retrieve the product. The product can in some cases be as large as an automobile. Stacker cranes are often used in the large freezer warehouses of frozen food manufacturers. This automation avoids requiring forklift drivers to work in below-freezing temperatures every day.

=== Marine ===
==== Floating ====

Floating cranes are used mainly in bridge building and port construction, but they are also used for occasional loading and unloading of especially heavy or awkward loads on and off ships. Some floating cranes are mounted on pontoons, others are specialized crane barges with a lifting capacity exceeding and have been used to transport entire bridge sections. Floating cranes have also been used to salvage sunken ships.

Crane vessels are often used in offshore construction.
The largest revolving cranes can be found on SSCV &quot;Sleipnir&quot;, which has two cranes with a capacity of each. For 50 years, the largest such crane was &quot;Herman the German&quot; at the Long Beach Naval Shipyard, one of three constructed by Nazi Germany and captured in the war. The crane was sold to the Panama Canal in 1996 where it is now known as &quot;Titan&quot;.

====Deck====
Deck cranes, also known as shipboard or cargo cranes, are located on ships and boats, used for cargo operations where no shore unloading facilities are available, raising and lowering loads (such as shellfish dredges and fish nets) into the water, and small boat unloading and retrieval. Most are diesel-hydraulic or electric-hydraulic, supporting an increasingly automated control interface.

=== Other types ===
==== Railroad ====

A railroad crane has flanged wheels for use on railroads.
The simplest form is a crane mounted on a flatcar. More capable devices are purpose-built. Different types of crane are used for maintenance work, recovery operations and freight loading in goods yards and scrap handling facilities.

==== Aerial ====
Aerial cranes or &quot;sky cranes&quot; usually are helicopters designed to lift large loads. Helicopters are able to travel to and lift in areas that are difficult to reach by conventional cranes. Helicopter cranes are most commonly used to lift loads onto shopping centers and high-rise buildings. They can lift anything within their lifting capacity, such as air conditioning units, cars, boats, swimming pools, etc. They also perform disaster relief after natural disasters for clean-up, and during wild-fires they are able to carry huge buckets of water to extinguish fires.

Some aerial cranes, mostly concepts, have also used lighter-than air aircraft, such as airships.

== Efficiency increase of cranes ==
Lifetime of existing cranes made of welded metal structures can often be extended for many years by after treatment of welds. During development of cranes, load level (lifting load) can be significantly increased by taking into account the IIW recommendations, leading in most cases to an increase of the permissible lifting load and thus to an efficiency increase.

==Similar machines==

The generally accepted definition of a crane is a machine for lifting and moving heavy objects by means of ropes or cables suspended from a movable arm. As such, a lifting machine that does not use cables, or else provides only vertical and not horizontal movement, cannot strictly be called a &#x27;crane&#x27;.

Types of crane-like lifting machine include:

* gin pole
* Block and tackle
* Capstan (nautical)
* Hoist (device)
* Winch
* Windlass
* Cherry picker
More technically advanced types of such lifting machines are often known as &quot;cranes&quot;, regardless of the official definition of the term.

==Special examples==
* Finnieston Crane, a.k.a. the &quot;Stobcross Crane&quot;
** Category A-listed example of a &quot;hammerhead&quot; (cantilever) crane in Glasgow&#x27;s former docks, built by the William Arrol company.

** capacity, lift-height

==Crane operators==
Crane operators are skilled workers and heavy equipment operators.

Key skills that are needed for a crane operator include:

*An understanding of how to use and maintain machines and tools
*Good team working skills
*Attention to details
*Good spatial awareness.
*Patience and the ability to stay calm in stressful situations

==Terminology==

The ISO 4306 series of specifications establish the vocabulary for cranes:

* Part 1: General
* Part 2: Mobile cranes
* Part 3: Tower cranes
* Part 4: Jib cranes
* Part 5: Bridge and gantry cranes

*Luffing
*Slewing
*Hoisting

<text>The Sud Aviation Super-Caravelle was an early design for a supersonic transport. Unlike most competing designs which envisioned larger trans-Atlantic aircraft and led to the likes of the Boeing 2707, the Super-Caravelle was a much smaller, shorter range design intended to replace Sud Aviation&#x27;s earlier and successful Caravelle. Design work started in 1960 and was announced in 1961 at the Paris Air Show, but was later merged with similar work at the British Aircraft Corporation (originally the Bristol 223) to create the Concorde project in November 1962. After work had begun on designing Concorde, the Super Caravelle name was instead used on a lengthened version of the original Caravelle design, the SE-210B.

==Design==
The Super-Caravelle looks very much like a smaller version of Concorde. It used Concorde&#x27;s unique ogive wing planform, and was otherwise similar in shape and layout with the exception of the nose area, which was more conventional and only the outermost section over the radar &quot;drooped&quot; for visibility on takeoff and landing. In normal use it was designed to carry up to 109 passengers between at about Mach 2. The size and range requirements were set to make the Super-Caravelle &quot;perfect&quot; for Air France&#x27;s European and African routes.

Concorde was originally to be delivered in two versions, a longer-range transatlantic version similar to the Bristol 223 that was eventually delivered as Concorde, and a smaller version for shorter range routes similar to the Super-Caravelle. After consultations with prospective customers, the smaller design was dropped.

<doc id="318380" wikidata="Q17126173" url="?curid=318380" title="Weight-bearing">
<text>In orthopedics, weight-bearing is the amount of weight a patient puts on an injured body part. Generally, it refers to a leg, ankle or foot that has been fractured or upon which surgery has been performed, but the term can also be used to refer to resting on an arm or a wrist. In general, it is described as a percentage of the body weight, because each leg of a healthy person carries the full body weight when walking, in an alternating fashion.

After surgery of the hip, or of the bones of the leg, ankle, or foot, it is of the utmost importance for recovery to get the right amount of weight-bearing when moving around with crutches or frames.

The grades of weight bearing for each phase of recovery will be determined by the surgeon. The Anti-Gravity Treadmill can allow testing of weight bearing by lowering effective body weight in 1% increments from 100 to 20% of body weight.

==Grades==

* &quot;Non-weight-bearing&quot; (NWB): The leg must not touch the floor and is not permitted to support any weight at all. The patient may hop on the other leg or use crutches or other devices for mobility. In this grade, 0% of the body weight may be rested on the leg.
* &quot;Touch-down weight-bearing&quot; or &quot;Toe-touch weight-bearing:&quot; The foot or toes may touch the floor (such as to maintain balance), but not support any weight. Do not place actual weight on the affected leg. Imagine having an egg underfoot that one is not to crush.
* &quot;Partial weight-bearing:&quot; A small amount of weight may be supported by the affected leg. The weight may be gradually increased up to 50% of the body weight, which would permit the affected person to stand with his body weight evenly supported by both feet (but not to walk).
* &quot;Weight-bearing as tolerated:&quot; Usually assigned to people that can support from 50 to 100% of the body weight on the affected leg, the affected person independently chooses the weight supported by the extremity. The amount tolerated may vary according to the circumstances.
* &quot;Full weight-bearing:&quot; The leg can now carry 100% of the body weight, which permits normal walking.

<doc id="318381" wikidata="Q23427" url="?curid=318381" title="South Ossetia">
<text>South Ossetia, officially the Republic of South Ossetia or the State of Alania, is a partially recognised landlocked country in the South Caucasus. It has an officially stated population of just over 56,500 people (2022), who live in an area of , with 33,000 living in the capital city, Tskhinvali.

As of 2024, only five members of the United Nations (UN) recognise South Ossetia as a sovereign stateRussia, Venezuela, Nicaragua, Nauru, and Syria. The Georgian government and all other UN member states regard South Ossetia as sovereign territory of Georgia.

The political status of South Ossetia is a central issue of the Georgian–Ossetian conflict and Georgia–Russia relations. The Georgian constitution designates the area as &quot;the former autonomous district of South Ossetia&quot;, in reference to the South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast disbanded in 1990. The Georgian government informally refers to the area as the Tskhinvali region and considers it a part of Georgia&#x27;s Shida Kartli region. Lacking effective control over the territory, Georgia maintains an administrative body called the Provisional Administration of South Ossetia.

The South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast, established by Soviet authorities in Moscow in 1922, declared independence from the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic in September 1990. Towards the end of 1990, the situation for ethnic Georgians in the region worsened sharply. There were reports of multiple cases of lootings and beatings committed both by Georgian and Ossetian forces and paramilitaries. The Georgian government responded by abolishing South Ossetia&#x27;s autonomy and dispatching its troops to the region. The escalating crisis led to the 1991–1992 South Ossetia War with Russian involvement on the Ossetian side. After the war, the conflict remained frozen throughout 1990s and saw two major escalations in 2000s: in 2004 and in 2008. The latter conflict led to the full-scale Russo-Georgian War of August 2008, during which Ossetian and Russian forces gained full &quot;de facto&quot; control of the territory of the former South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast. Since the 2008 war, Georgia and a significant part of the international community have regarded South Ossetia as occupied by the Russian military.

South Ossetia relies heavily on military, political, and financial aid from Russia. Since 2008, the South Ossetian government has expressed their intention of joining the Russian Federation; if successful, this would end its proclaimed independence. The prospect of a referendum on this matter has been raised multiple times in domestic politics, but none has taken place.

== History ==
=== Medieval and early modern period ===

The Ossetians are believed to originate from the Alans, a nomadic Iranian tribe. In the 8th century a consolidated Alan kingdom, referred to in sources of the period as Alania, emerged in the northern Caucasus Mountains. Around 1239–1277 Alania fell to the Mongol and later to the Timur&#x27;s armies, who massacred much of the Alanian population. The survivors among the Alans retreated into the mountains of the central Caucasus and gradually started migration to the south, across the Caucasus Mountains into the Kingdom of Georgia. In the village Zakagori, an inscription was found on a tombstone in the Ossetian language written in Syriac-Nestorian script, which dates back to 1326.
In the 17th century, by pressure of Kabardian princes, Ossetians started a second wave of migration from the North Caucasus to the Kingdom of Kartli. Ossetian peasants, who were migrating to the mountainous areas of the South Caucasus, often settled in the lands of Georgian feudal lords. The Georgian King of the Kingdom of Kartli permitted Ossetians to immigrate. According to Russian ambassador to Georgia Mikhail Tatishchev, at the beginning of the 17th century there was already a small group of Ossetians living near the headwaters of the Great Liakhvi. In the 1770s there were more Ossetians living in Kartli than ever before.
This period has been documented in the travel diaries of Johann Anton Güldenstädt who visited Georgia in 1772. The Baltic German explorer called modern North Ossetia–Alania simply Ossetia, while he wrote that Kartli (the areas of modern-day South Ossetia) was populated by Georgians and the mountainous areas were populated by both Georgians and Ossetians. Güldenstädt also wrote that the northernmost border of Kartli is the Major Caucasus Ridge. By the end of 18th century, the ultimate sites of Ossetian settlement on the territory of modern South Ossetia were in Kudaro (Jejora river estuary), Greater Liakhvi gorge, the gorge of Little Liakhvi, Ksani River gorge, Guda (Tetri Aragvi estuary) and Truso (Terek estuary).

The Georgian Kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti, including the territory of modern South Ossetia, was annexed by the Russian Empire in 1801. However, the Ossetians refused to submit to the new administration and considered themselves independent. In 1821-1830 the stage of annexation of South Ossetia began, which ended with the conquest of South Ossetia by Paul Rennenkampff in 1830. By 1830, Ossetia was completely under Russian control. Ossetian migration to Georgian areas continued in the 19th and 20th centuries, when Georgia was part of the Russian Empire and Ossetian settlements emerged in Trialeti, Borjomi, Bakuriani and Kakheti as well.

=== South Ossetia as a part of the Soviet Union ===

Following the Russian revolution, the area of modern South Ossetia became part of the Democratic Republic of Georgia. In 1918, conflict began between the landless Ossetian peasants living in Shida Kartli (Interior Georgia), who were influenced by Bolshevism and demanded ownership of the lands they worked, and the Menshevik government backed ethnic Georgian aristocrats, who were legal owners. Although the Ossetians were initially discontented with the economic policies of the central government, the tension soon transformed into ethnic conflict. The first Ossetian rebellion began in February 1918, when three Georgian princes were killed and their land was seized by the Ossetians. The central government of Tiflis retaliated by sending the National Guard to the area. However, the Georgian unit retreated after they had engaged the Ossetians. Ossetian rebels then proceeded to occupy the town of Tskhinvali and began attacking the ethnic Georgian civilian population. During uprisings in 1919 and 1920, the Ossetians were covertly supported by Soviet Russia, but even so, were defeated. According to allegations made by Ossetian sources, the crushing of the 1920 uprising caused the death of 5,000 Ossetians, while ensuing hunger and epidemics were the causes of death of more than 13,000 people.

The Soviet Georgian government, established after the Red Army invasion of Georgia in 1921, created an autonomous administrative unit for Transcaucasian Ossetians in April 1922 under pressure from Kavbiuro (the Caucasian Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union), called the South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast (AO). Some believe that the Bolsheviks granted this autonomy to the Ossetians in exchange for their (Bolshevik) loyalty in fighting the Democratic Republic of Georgia and favouring local separatists, since this area had never been a separate entity prior to the Russian invasion. The drawing of administrative boundaries of the South Ossetian AO was quite a complicated process. Many Georgian villages were included within the South Ossetian AO despite numerous protests by the Georgian population. While the city of Tskhinvali did not have a majority Ossetian population, it was made the capital of the South Ossetian AO. In addition to parts of Gori uezd and Dusheti uezd of Tiflis Governorate, parts of Racha uezd of Kutaisi Governorate (western Georgia) were also included within the South Ossetian AO. All these territories historically had been indigenous Georgian lands.

Historical Ossetia in the North Caucasus did not have its own political entity before 1924, when the North Ossetian Autonomous Oblast was created.

Although the Ossetians had their own language (Ossetian), Russian and Georgian were administrative/state languages. Under the rule of Georgia&#x27;s government during Soviet times, Ossetians enjoyed minority cultural autonomy, including speaking the Ossetian language and teaching it in schools. In 1989, two-thirds of Ossetians in the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic lived outside the South Ossetian AO.

=== Georgian-Ossetian conflict ===
==== 1989–2008 ====
Tensions in the region began to rise amid rising nationalism among both Georgians and Ossetians in 1989. Before this, the two communities of the South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast of the Georgian SSR had been living in peace with each other except for the 1918–1920 events. Both ethnicities had a normal degree of interaction and there were many Georgian-Ossetian intermarriages.

The dispute surrounding the presence of the Ossetian people in the South Caucasus has been one of the causes of conflict. Although Georgian historiography believes that Ossetian mass migration to the South Caucasus (Georgia) began in the 17th century, Ossetians claim to have been residing in the area since the ancient times, which is not supported by available sources. Some Ossetian historians accept that the migration of Ossetian ancestors to modern South Ossetia began after the Mongol invasions of the 13th century, while one South Ossetian &quot;de facto&quot; foreign minister in the 1990s said that the Ossetians first appeared in the area only in the early 17th century. Since it was created after the Russian invasion of 1921, South Ossetia was regarded as artificial creation by Georgians during the Soviet era.

The South Ossetian Popular Front (&quot;Ademon Nykhas&quot;) was created in 1988. On 10 November 1989, the South Ossetian regional council asked the Georgian Supreme Council to upgrade the region to the status of an &quot;autonomous republic&quot;. The decision to transform the South Ossetian AO into the South Ossetian ASSR by the South Ossetian authorities escalated the conflict. On 11 November, this decision was revoked by the Georgian parliament, the Supreme Soviet. The Georgian authorities removed the First Party Secretary of the oblast from his position.

The Georgian Supreme Council adopted a law barring regional parties in summer 1990. The South Ossetian regional council interpreted this as a move against Ademon Nykhas and subsequently passed a &quot;declaration of national sovereignty&quot;, proclaiming the South Ossetian Soviet Democratic Republic within the Soviet Union on 20 September 1990. Ossetians boycotted subsequent Georgian parliamentary elections and held their own contest in December.

In October 1990, the parliamentary election in Georgia was won by Zviad Gamsakhurdia&#x27;s &quot;Round Table&quot; block. On 11 December 1990, Zviad Gamsakhurdia&#x27;s government declared the Ossetian election illegitimate and abolished South Ossetia&#x27;s autonomous status altogether. Gamsakhurdia rationalised the abolition of Ossetian autonomy by saying, &quot;They [Ossetians] have no right to a state here in Georgia. They are a national minority. Their homeland is North Ossetia... Here they are newcomers.&quot;

When the Georgian parliament declared a state of emergency in the territory of South Ossetian AO on 12 December 1990, troops from both Georgian and Soviet interior ministries were sent to the region. After the Georgian National Guard was formed in early 1991, Georgian troops entered Tskhinvali on 5 January 1991. The 1991–1992 South Ossetia War was characterised by general disregard for international humanitarian law by uncontrollable militias, with both sides reporting atrocities. The Soviet military facilitated a ceasefire as ordered by Mikhail Gorbachev in January 1991. In March and April 1991, Soviet interior troops were reported actively disarming militias on both sides, and deterring the inter-ethnic violence. Zviad Gamsakhurdia asserted that the Soviet leadership was encouraging South Ossetian separatism in order to force Georgia not to leave the Soviet Union. Georgia declared its independence in April 1991.

As a result of the war, about 100,000 ethnic Ossetians fled the territory and Georgia proper, most across the border into North Ossetia. A further 23,000 ethnic Georgians fled South Ossetia to other parts of Georgia. Many refugees went to the North Ossetian Prigorodnyi District. In 1944, many South Ossetians were resettled in areas of North Ossetia from which the Ingush had been expelled by Stalin in 1944. In the 1990s the new wave of South Ossetians migrating to the former Ingush territory fuelled conflict between Ossetians and Ingush.

On 29 April 1991, the western part of South Ossetia was affected by an earthquake, which killed more than 200 and left tens of thousands homeless.

In late 1991, dissent was mounting against Gamsakhurdia in Georgia due to his intolerance of critics and attempts to concentrate political power. On 22 December 1991, after a coup d&#x27;état, Gamsakhurdia and his supporters were besieged by the opposition, which was backed by the national guard, in several government buildings in Tbilisi. The ensuing heavy fighting resulted in over 200 casualties and left the center of the Georgian capital in ruins. On 6 January, Gamsakhurdia and several of his supporters fled the city for exile. Afterwards, the Georgian military council, an interim government, was formed by a triumvirate of Jaba Ioseliani, Tengiz Kitovani and Tengiz Sigua, and, in March 1992, they invited Eduard Shevardnadze, a former Soviet minister, to come to Georgia to assume control of the Georgian State Council.

An independence referendum was held in South Ossetia on 19 January 1992, with voters being asked two questions: &quot;Do you agree that South Ossetia should be an independent country?&quot; and &quot;Do you agree with the South Ossetian parliament&#x27;s solution of 1 September 1991 on reunion with Russia?&quot; Both proposals were approved, but the results were not recognised internationally. Nonetheless, the South Ossetian regional council subsequently passed an &quot;act of state independence&quot; and declared the independence of the Republic of South Ossetia on 29 May 1992.

On 24 June 1992, Shevardnadze and the South Ossetian government signed the Sochi ceasefire agreement, brokered by Russia. The agreement included obligations to avoid the use of force, and Georgia pledged not to impose sanctions against South Ossetia. The Georgian government retained control over substantial portions of South Ossetia, including the town of Akhalgori. A Joined Peacekeeping force of Ossetians, Russians and Georgians was established. On 6 November 1992, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) set up a mission in Georgia to monitor the peacekeeping operation. From then until mid-2004, South Ossetia was generally peaceful.

Following the 2003 Rose Revolution, Mikheil Saakashvili became the President of Georgia in 2004. Ahead of the 2004 parliamentary and presidential elections, he promised to restore the territorial integrity of Georgia. During one of his early speeches, Saakashvili addressed the separatist regions, saying, &quot;[N]either Georgia nor its president will put up with disintegration of Georgia. Therefore, we offer immediate negotiations to our Abkhazian and Ossetian friends. We are ready to discuss every model of statehood by taking into consideration their interests for the promotion of their future development.&quot;

Since 2004, tensions began to rise as the Georgian authorities strengthened their efforts to bring the region back under their rule, after it succeeded in Adjara. Georgia sent police to close down the Ergneti black market, which was one of the region&#x27;s chief sources of revenue, selling foodstuffs and fuel smuggled from Russia. The Georgian authorities claimed the massive smuggling of goods for the Ergneti market through the Roki Tunnel, which was not under Georgian control, cost the country significant amounts of custom revenues. Georgia proposed to bring the Roki tunnel under joint control and monitoring, which was refused by the South Ossetian side. The antismuggling operation against the market resulted in a breakdown of South Ossetian trust in Georgia&#x27;s intentions. A wave of violence erupted between Georgian peacekeepers and South Ossetian militiamen and freelance fighters from Russia. This included hostage taking of dozens of Georgian peacekeepers, shootouts and shelling of Georgian controlled villages, which left dozens dead and wounded. A ceasefire deal was reached on 13 August though it was repeatedly violated.

The Georgian government protested against the allegedly increasing Russian economic and political presence in the region and against the uncontrolled military of the South Ossetian side. Georgian government officials have stated South Ossetian key security positions are occupied by (former) Russian security officials, while some political researchers speak of institutions being outsourced to the Russian Federation.

It also considered the peacekeeping force (consisting in equal parts of South Ossetians, North Ossetians, Russians and Georgians) to be non-neutral and demanded its replacement. Various proposals were launched by the Georgian side to internationalise the peacekeeping in South Ossetia. According to U.S. senator Richard Lugar, the United States supported Georgia&#x27;s call in 2006 for the withdrawal of Russian &quot;peacekeepers&quot; from the conflict zones. Later, EU South Caucasus envoy Peter Semneby said that &quot;Russia&#x27;s actions in the Georgia spy row have damaged its credibility as a neutral peacekeeper in the EU&#x27;s Black Sea neighbourhood.&quot; Joe Biden (Chairman, U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee), Richard Lugar, and Mel Martínez sponsored a resolution in June 2008 accusing Russia of attempting to undermine Georgia&#x27;s territorial integrity and called for replacing the Russian-comprised peacekeeping force operating under CIS mandate.

==== 2008 war ====
Tensions between Georgia and Russia began escalating in April 2008. A bomb explosion on 1 August 2008 targeted a car transporting Georgian peacekeepers. South Ossetians were responsible for instigating this incident, which marked the opening of hostilities and injured five Georgian servicemen. In response, several South Ossetian militiamen were hit. South Ossetian separatists began shelling Georgian villages on 1 August. These artillery attacks caused Georgian servicemen to return fire periodically from 1 August.

At around 19:00 on 7 August 2008, Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili announced a unilateral ceasefire and called for peace talks. However, escalating assaults against Georgian villages (located in the South Ossetian conflict zone) were soon matched with gunfire from Georgian troops, who then proceeded to move in the direction of the capital of the self-proclaimed Republic of South Ossetia (Tskhinvali) on the night of 8 August, reaching its center in the morning of 8 August. One Georgian diplomat told Russian newspaper &quot;Kommersant&quot; on 8 August that by taking control of Tskhinvali, Tbilisi wanted to demonstrate that Georgia would not tolerate the killing of Georgian citizens. According to Russian military expert Pavel Felgenhauer, the Ossetian provocation was aimed at triggering the Georgian response, which was needed as a pretext for premeditated Russian military invasion. According to Georgian intelligence, and several Russian media reports, parts of the regular (non-peacekeeping) Russian Army had already moved to South Ossetian territory through the Roki Tunnel before the Georgian military action.

Russia accused Georgia of &quot;aggression against South Ossetia&quot;, and launched a large-scale land, air, and sea invasion of Georgia with the pretext of a &quot;peace enforcement operation&quot; on 8 August 2008. Russian airstrikes against targets within Georgia were also launched. Abkhaz forces opened a second front on 9 August by attacking the Kodori Gorge, held by Georgia. Tskhinvali was seized by the Russian military by 10 August. Russian forces occupied the Georgian cities of Zugdidi, Senaki, Poti, and Gori (the last one after the ceasefire agreement was negotiated). The Russian Black Sea Fleet blockaded the Georgian coast.
A campaign of ethnic cleansing against Georgians in South Ossetia was conducted by South Ossetians, with Georgian villages around Tskhinvali being destroyed after the war had ended. The war displaced 192,000 people, and while many were able to return to their homes after the war, a year later around 30,000 ethnic Georgians remained displaced. In an interview published in &quot;Kommersant&quot;, South Ossetian leader Eduard Kokoity said he would not allow Georgians to return.

President of France Nicolas Sarkozy negotiated a ceasefire agreement on 12 August 2008. On 17 August, Russian president Dmitry Medvedev announced that Russian forces would begin to pull out of Georgia the following day. Russia recognised Abkhazia and South Ossetia as separate republics on 26 August. In response to Russia&#x27;s recognition, the Georgian government severed diplomatic relations with Russia. Russian forces left the buffer areas bordering Abkhazia and South Ossetia on 8 October and the European Union Monitoring Mission in Georgia assumed authority over the buffer areas. Since the war, Georgia has maintained that Abkhazia and South Ossetia are Russian-occupied Georgian territories.

On 30 September 2009, the European Union–sponsored &quot;Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on the Conflict in Georgia&quot; stated that, while preceded by months of mutual provocations, &quot;open hostilities began with a large-scale Georgian military operation against the town of Tskhinvali and the surrounding areas, launched in the night of 7 to 8 August 2008.&quot;

=== After the 2008 war ===
In 2016, a referendum on integration with Russia was proposed during an election campaign, but was put on hold indefinitely. A referendum on South Ossetia&#x27;s official name was held on 9 April 2017; over three-quarters of those who voted supported amendments to the South Ossetian constitution which gave the names &quot;Republic of South Ossetia&quot; and &quot;State of Alania&quot; equal status under the law.

South Ossetia was rocked by its most significant protests from 2020 to 2021 following the Murder of Inal Djabiev. Djabiev, a vocal member of the South Ossetian opposition to Anatoly Bibilov had been tortured to death by the South Ossetian Police resulting in months of protests and sacking of several government ministers.

President Anatoly Bibilov announced on 26 March 2022 that South Ossetian troops had been sent to assist Russia in its invasion of Ukraine. Bibilov announced on 30 March 2022 that South Ossetia would initiate the legal process to become part of Russia. Russian politicians reacted positively and said Russian law would permit (parts of) foreign nations to join the federation. They highlighted the necessity to &quot;express the will of the Ossetian people&quot; through a referendum. Ossetian leader Bibilov said in a lengthy interview that he planned to hold two referendums, one on annexation by Russia, and the second vote on joining North Ossetia, for which he set the election proceedings in motion on April 7, 2022. On May 13, the annexation referendum was scheduled to take place on July 17.

Following Biblov&#x27;s defeat in 2022 election, the new president, Alan Gagloev, suspended the referendum on May 30. Gagloyev announced in August 2022 that border crossings with Georgia would be open ten days a month.

== Geography ==
South Ossetia is a very mountainous region located in the Caucasus at the juncture of Asia and Europe. It occupies the southern slopes of the Greater Caucasus mountain range and its foothills which are part of the Iberia Plain, a geographic plateau that is roughly in the center of South Ossetia. The Likhi Range shapes the western geographic boundary of South Ossetia, although the northwestern corner of South Ossetia is located west of the range.

The Greater Caucasus Mountain Range forms the northern border of South Ossetia with Russia. There is only one main road through the mountain range from South Ossetia to Russia, the TransKAM highway through the Roki tunnel into North Ossetia, which was completed in 1986. The Transkam section located in South Ossetia is nominally part of the Georgian S10 highway even though Tbilisi effectively does not control that part. The Roki Tunnel was vital for the Russian military in the 2008 South Ossetia war because it is the only direct route through the Caucasus Mountains between Russia and South Ossetia.

South Ossetia covers an area of about , separated by the mountains from the more populous North Ossetia (which is a republic within Russia) and extending southwards almost to the Mtkvari river in Georgia. More than 89% of South Ossetia lies over above sea level, and its highest point is Mount Khalatsa at above sea level.

Out of the roughly 2,000 glaciers that exist in the Greater Caucasus, approximately 30% are located within Georgia. The 10 glaciers of the Liakhvi River basin and a handful of the Rioni River basin are located in South Ossetia.

Most of South Ossetia is in the Kura Basin with the northwestern part of it in the Black Sea basin. The Likhi and Racha ridges act as divide separating these two basins. Major rivers in South Ossetia include the Greater and Little Liakhvi, Ksani, Medzhuda, Tlidon, Canal Saltanis, Ptsa River and host of other tributaries.

=== Climate ===

South Ossetia&#x27;s climate is affected by subtropical influences from the East and Mediterranean influences from the West. The Greater Caucasus range moderates the local climate by serving as a barrier against cold air from the north, which results in the fact that, even at great heights, it is warmer there than in the Northern Caucasus. Climatic zones in South Ossetia are determined by distance from the Black Sea and by altitude. The plains of eastern Georgia are shielded from the influence of the Black Sea by mountains that provide a more continental climate.

The foothills and mountainous areas (including the Greater Caucasus Mountains) experience cool, wet summers and snowy winters, with snow cover often exceeding two meters in many regions. The penetration of humid air masses from the Black Sea to the west of South Ossetia is often blocked by the Likhi mountain range. The wettest periods of the year in South Ossetia generally occur during spring and autumn while the winter and summer months tend to be the driest. Elevation plays an important role in South Ossetia where climatic conditions above are considerably colder than in any lower-lying areas. The regions that lie above frequently experience frost even during the summer months.

The average temperature in South Ossetia in January is around +4 degrees Celsius, and the average temperature in July is around +20.3 degrees Celsius. The average yearly liquid precipitation in South Ossetia is around 598 millimetres. In general, summer temperatures average to across much of South Ossetia, and winter temperatures average to . Humidity is relatively low and rainfall across South Ossetia averages per year, but Alpine and highland regions have distinct microclimates. At higher elevations, precipitation is sometimes twice as heavy as in the eastern plains of Georgia. Alpine conditions begin at about , and above snow and ice are present year-round.
The Russian troops who patrol the borders of South Ossetia have reportedly been expanding the boundaries of the region through “encroaching occupation”, meaning they surreptitiously advance several feet at a time into Georgian-held territory.

== Political status ==


Following the 2008 South Ossetia war, Russia recognised South Ossetia as independent. This unilateral recognition by Russia was met by condemnation from Western Blocs, such as NATO, Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and the European Council due to the violation of Georgia&#x27;s territorial integrity. The EU&#x27;s diplomatic response to the news was delayed by disagreements between eastern European states, the UK wanting a harsher response and Germany, France and other states&#x27; desire not to isolate Russia. Former US envoy Richard Holbrooke said the conflict could encourage separatist movements in other former Soviet states along Russia&#x27;s western border. Several days later, Nicaragua became the second country to recognise South Ossetia. Venezuela recognised South Ossetia on 10 September 2009, becoming the third UN member state to do so.

The European Union, Council of Europe, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and most UN member countries do not recognise South Ossetia as an independent state. The &quot;de facto&quot; republic governed by the secessionist government held a second independence referendum on 12 November 2006, after its first referendum in 1992 was not recognised by most governments as valid. According to the Tskhinvali election authorities, the referendum turned out a majority for independence from Georgia where 99% of South Ossetian voters supported independence and the turnout for the vote was 95%. The referendum was monitored by a team of 34 international observers from Germany, Austria, Poland, Sweden and other countries at 78 polling stations. However, it was not recognised internationally by the UN, European Union, OSCE, NATO and the Russian Federation, given the lack of ethnic Georgian participation and the illegality of such a referendum without recognition from the Georgian government in Tbilisi. The European Union, OSCE and NATO condemned the referendum.

Parallel to the secessionist held referendum and elections, to Eduard Kokoity, the then President of South Ossetia, the Ossetian opposition movement (People of South Ossetia for Peace) organised their own elections contemporaneously in Georgian-controlled areas within South Ossetia, in which Georgian and some Ossetian inhabitants of the region voted in favour of Dmitry Sanakoyev as the alternative President of South Ossetia. The alternative elections of Sanakoyev claimed full support of the ethnic Georgian population.

In April 2007, Georgia created the Provisional Administrative Entity of South Ossetia, staffed by ethnic Ossetian members of the separatist movement. Dmitry Sanakoyev was assigned as the leader of the Entity. It was intended that this provisional administration would negotiate with central Georgian authorities regarding its final status and conflict resolution. On 10 May 2007, Sanakoyev was appointed by the President of Georgia as the Head of South Ossetian Provisional Administrative Entity.

On 13 July 2007, Georgia set up a state commission, chaired by the Prime Minister Zurab Noghaideli, to develop South Ossetia&#x27;s autonomous status within the Georgian state. According to the Georgian officials, the status was to be elaborated within the framework of &quot;an all-inclusive dialogue&quot; with all the forces and communities within the Ossetian society.

South Ossetia, Transnistria and Abkhazia are sometimes referred to as post-Soviet &quot;frozen conflict&quot; zones.

=== Plans for integration with the Russian Federation ===

On 30 August 2008, Tarzan Kokoity, the Deputy Speaker of South Ossetia&#x27;s parliament, announced that the region would soon be absorbed into Russia, so that South and North Ossetians could live together in one united Russian state. Russian and South Ossetian forces began giving residents in Akhalgori, the biggest town in the predominantly ethnic Georgian eastern part of South Ossetia, the choice of accepting Russian citizenship or leaving. However, Eduard Kokoity, the then president of South Ossetia, later stated that South Ossetia would not give up its independence by joining Russia: &quot;We are not going to say no to our independence, which has been achieved at the expense of many lives; South Ossetia has no plans to join Russia.&quot; Civil Georgia has said that this statement contradicts previous ones made by Kokoity earlier that day, when he indicated that South Ossetia would join North Ossetia in the Russian Federation.

The South Ossetian and Russian presidents signed an &quot;alliance and integration&quot; treaty on 18 March 2015. The agreement includes provisions to incorporate the South Ossetian military into Russia&#x27;s armed forces, integrate the customs service of South Ossetia into that of Russia&#x27;s, and commit Russia to paying state worker salaries in South Ossetia at rates equal to those in the North Caucasus Federal District. The Associated Press described the treaty as calling for &quot;nearly full integration&quot; and compared it to a 2014 agreement between Russia and Abkhazia. The Georgian Foreign Ministry described the signing of the treaty as &quot;actual annexation&quot; of the disputed region by Russia, and the United States and European Union said they would not recognise it.

In another move towards integration with the Russian Federation, South Ossetian President Leonid Tibilov proposed in December 2015 a name change to South Ossetia–Alania – in analogy with North Ossetia–Alania, a Russian federal subject. Tibilov furthermore suggested holding a referendum on joining the Russian Federation prior to April 2017, which would lead to a united &quot;Ossetia–Alania&quot;. In April 2016, Tibilov said he intended to hold the referendum before August of that year. However, on 30 May, Tibilov postponed the referendum until after the presidential election due in April 2017. At the name-change referendum, nearly 80 per cent of those who voted endorsed the name-change, while the presidential race was won by Anatoliy Bibilov – against the incumbent, Tibilov, who had been supported by Moscow and who, unlike Bibilov, was ready to heed Moscow&#x27;s wish for the integration referendum not be held any time soon.

On 30 March 2022, President Anatoly Bibilov announced his intention to begin legal proceedings in the near future to integration with the Russian Federation, although he subsequently lost the presidency in the 2022 South Ossetian presidential election.

=== Law on occupied territories of Georgia ===
In late October 2008, President Saakashvili signed into law legislation on the occupied territories passed by the Georgian Parliament. The law covers the breakaway regions of Abkhazia and Tskhinvali (territories of former South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast). The law spells out restrictions on free movement to, economic activity and concluding real estate transactions in these territories. In particular, according to the law, foreign citizens should enter the two breakaway regions only through Georgia. Entry into Abkhazia should be carried out from Zugdidi Municipality and into South Ossetia from Gori Municipality.

The main road leading to South Ossetia from the rest of Georgia passes through the Gori Municipality. However, this road is closed in both directions at Ergneti since 2008. The main crossing point that remained open for Georgians and South Ossetians, to the Akhalgori district, has been closed by South Ossetia since 2019. Furthermore, the South Ossetian authorities only allow entry of foreigners &quot;through the territory of the Russian Federation&quot;.

The Georgian legislation, however, also lists &quot;special&quot; cases in which entry into the breakaway regions will not be regarded as illegal. It stipulates that a special permit on entry into the breakaway regions can be issued if the trip there &quot;serves Georgia&#x27;s state interests; peaceful resolution of the conflict; de-occupation or humanitarian purposes.&quot; The law also bans any type of economic activity – entrepreneurial or non- entrepreneurial, if such activities require permits, licences or registration in accordance with Georgian legislation. It also bans air, sea and railway communications and international transit via the regions, mineral exploration and money transfers. The provision covering economic activities is retroactive, going back to 1990.

The law says that the Russian Federation – the state which has carried out military occupation – is fully responsible for the violation of human rights in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. The Russian Federation, according to the document, is also responsible for compensation of material and moral damage inflicted on Georgian citizens, stateless persons and foreign citizens, who are in Georgia and enter the occupied territories with appropriate permits. The law also says that de facto state agencies and officials operating in the occupied territories are regarded by Georgia as illegal. The law will remain in force until &quot;the full restoration of Georgian jurisdiction&quot; over the breakaway regions is realised.

In November 2009, during the opening ceremony of a new Georgian Embassy building in Kyiv, Ukraine, Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili stated that residents of South Ossetia and Abkhazia could also use its facilities: &quot;I would like to assure you, my dear friends, that this is your home, as well, and here you will always be able to find support and understanding&quot;.

== Politics ==
Until the armed conflict of August 2008, South Ossetia consisted of a checkerboard of Georgian-inhabited and Ossetian-inhabited towns and villages. The largely Ossetian capital city of Tskhinvali and most of the other Ossetian-inhabited communities were governed by the separatist government, while the Georgian-inhabited villages and towns were administered by the Georgian government. This close proximity and the intermixing of the two communities has made the Georgian–Ossetian conflict particularly dangerous, since any attempt to create an ethnically pure territory would involve population transfers on a large scale.

The political dispute has yet to be resolved and the South Ossetian separatist authorities govern the region with effective independence from Tbilisi. Although talks have been held periodically between the two sides, little progress was made under the government of Eduard Shevardnadze (1993–2003). His successor Mikheil Saakashvili (elected 2004) made the reassertion of Georgian governmental authority a political priority. Having successfully put an end to the &quot;de facto&quot; independence of the southwestern province of Ajaria in May 2004, he pledged to seek a similar solution in South Ossetia. After the 2004 clashes, the Georgian government has intensified its efforts to bring the problem to international attention. On 25 January 2005, President Saakashvili presented a Georgian vision for resolving the South Ossetian conflict at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe session in Strasbourg. Late in October, Prime Minister Zurab Noghaideli presented the Georgian action plan at the OSCE Permanent Council at Vienna, to which the US government and the OSCE expressed their support. The South Ossetian &quot;de facto&quot; authorities reacted by saying the plan is &quot;not realistic&quot; and &quot;contains nothing new for the South Ossetian side&quot;. On 6 December, the OSCE Ministerial Council in Ljubljana adopted a resolution supporting the Georgian peace plan. Prior to the Ministerial Council, the Russian Foreign Ministry rejected the Georgian plan, saying it differed from the plan Saakashvili presented at the UN General Assembly in September 2004, which was favoured by the South Ossetian side. After the OSCE resolution, the South Ossetian side surprised many with their own initiative reminiscent to the Georgian plan, triggering optimism in Tbilisi.

=== Government ===
According to Article 47 of the South Ossetian Constitution, the president of the Republic of South Ossetia is the head of state and head of the executive branch of government. The president of the republic is elected for five years by direct popular vote, with a maximum of two consecutive terms for the same person. South Ossetia&#x27;s legislative body is the unicameral parliament, which consists of 34 members who are elected by popular vote for five years in a mixed system of 17 single-member constituencies and 17 delegates elected through proportional representation (article 57).

Since 24 May 2022, Alan Gagloev has been the president of the republic, winning the contested election of the then incumbent Anatoly Bibilov.

=== Military ===
South Ossetia&#x27;s armed forces in 2017 were partially incorporated into the Russian Armed Forces. The Russian armed forces have established the 4th Guards Military Base in South Ossetia, which is based in Tskhinvali, with training sites north from the city (Dzartsem) and near Java, where a branch of the base is hosted at the village Ugardanta for the Russian Airborne Forces. Furthermore, Russia has established nearly 20 so called &quot;militarized border guard bases&quot; near the boundary line with Tbilisi controlled Georgia, which fall under the command and responsibility of the Russian FSB and are tasked with enforcing a &quot;state border&quot; between South Ossetia and Georgia. An estimated 3,000–3,500 Russian servicemen are deployed in South Ossetia, while an estimated 1,500 FSB personnel are deployed at the border guard bases. According to South Ossetian de facto authorities, about 450 South Ossetian citizens are employed at the 4th Russian Military Base.

On 26 March 2022, president Bibilov said that South Ossetia had sent troops to aid Russia during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, stating his troops &quot;understand perfectly that they are going to defend Russia, they are going to defend Ossetia too&quot;. Roughly a quarter of these troops would desert and hitchhike back to South Ossetia. Bibilov later said that the deserters would face no punishment.

== Demographics ==
Before the Georgian–Ossetian conflict roughly two-thirds of the population of South Ossetia was Ossetian and 25–30% was Georgian. The eastern quarter of South Ossetia, around the town and district of Akhalgori, was predominantly Georgian, while the center and west were predominantly Ossetian. Much of the mountainous north is sparsely inhabited (see map at Languages of the Caucasus).

The Georgian 2002 census was incomplete with regard to South Ossetia, as it took place only in areas under effective Georgian control at the time. This concerned the Georgian populated areas of Akhalgori district and the Georgian communities around Tskhinvali, in the Patara Liachvi and Didi Liakhvi valleys. although according to some estimates there were 47,000 ethnic Ossetians and 17,500 ethnic Georgians in South Ossetia in 2007.

2009 population estimate: During the war, according to Georgian officials, 15,000 Georgians moved to Georgia proper; South Ossetian officials indicate that 30,000 Ossetians fled to North Ossetia, and a total of 500 citizens of South Ossetia were killed.

According to the 2015 census conducted by the South Ossetian authorities, the region&#x27;s total population was 53,532, including 48,146 Ossetians (89.9%), 3,966 Georgians (7.4%), and 610 Russians. The Georgian authorities have questioned the accuracy of these data. Estimates based on official birth rates and school attendance suggest it may have been around 39,000 inhabitants, and an independent estimate from 2009 put the population at 26,000.

According to the South Ossetian Statistical agency the population estimate was 56,520 per 1 January 2022. Of these, 33,054 lived in Tskhinvali.

Eastern Orthodoxy is the major religion practised in South Ossetia, by Ossetians, Georgians and Russians.

== Economy ==
South Ossetia&#x27;s economy is primarily agricultural, although less than 10% of South Ossetia&#x27;s land area is cultivated. Cereals, fruit and vines are the major produce. Forestry and cattle industries are also maintained. A number of industrial facilities also exist, particularly around the capital, Tskhinvali. Following the war in the 1990s, South Ossetia struggled economically. South Ossetian GDP was estimated at US$15 million (US$250 per capita) in a work published in 2002. In 2017, the Administration of South Ossetia estimated its GDP to be nearly 100 million US dollars. South Ossetia&#x27;s poverty threshold stood at 3,062 rubles a month in the fourth quarter of 2007, or 23.5 per cent below Russia&#x27;s average, while South Ossetians have incomparably smaller incomes.

The majority of the population survives on subsistence farming. The South Ossetian authorities planned to improve finances by boosting the local production of flour and thus reducing the need for flour imports. For this purpose, the area planted with wheat was increased tenfold in 2008 from 130 hectares to 1,500 hectares. The wheat harvest in 2008 was expected to be 2,500 tons of grain. The South Ossetian Agriculture ministry also imported some tractors in 2008, and was expecting delivery of more farm machinery in 2009.

Before the 2008 Russo-Georgian War, South Ossetia&#x27;s industry consisted of 22 small factories, with a total production of 61.6 million rubles in 2006. In 2007, only 7 factories were functioning. In March 2009, it was reported that most of the production facilities were standing idle and were in need of repairs. Even successful factories have a shortage of workers, are in debt and have a shortage of working capital. One of the largest local enterprises is the Emalprovod factory, which has 130 employees. Additionally, after the 2008 war, Georgia cut off supplies of electricity to the Akhalgori region, which aggravated the socio-economic situation in that area.

By the end of 2021, the number of employed people was determined at 20,734 while 2,449 persons were registered as unemployed, on a total working age population of 34,308 (men 18–65, women 18–60). Virtually the only significant economic asset that South Ossetia possesses is control of the Roki Tunnel that is used to link Russia and Georgia, from which the South Ossetian government reportedly obtained a large part of its budget by levying customs duties on freight traffic before the war.

Since the 2008 war, South Ossetia and its economy are critically dependent on Russian economic assistance, and a year after the war, former President Edurard Kokoity was grateful for the Russian aid for reconstruction work. According to reports Russian donations made up nearly 99% of the budget of South Ossetia by 2010. By 2021 this has been reduced to 83%.
A new backup power transmission line running from Russia to South Ossetia was put into operation in November 2021, helping to ensure uninterrupted power supply to the region. It cost more than 1.3 billion rubles ($17m) to construct and was built within the framework of the Russian Investment program in South Ossetia.

In 2016, Armenia tried to persuade Georgia to open a transit route between Georgia and South Ossetia, but Georgia refused.

The socio-economic development program of South Ossetia for the 2022–2025 period is financed by Russia.The Aim of the program is for South Ossetia to reach the socio-economic indicators of the North Caucasus Federal District in 2025.

=== Currency ===
==== Zarin ====

One of South Ossetia&#x27;s official currencies is the Zarin which comes in the following denominations; 20, 25, and 50 Zarin coins, and a 100 Zarin bar. Despite being the official currency, the Zarin is not in circulation, and are used for ceremonial purposes, depicting key events and people in South Ossetian history and are either pure sterling silver (.925) or pure gold (.999) and are largely collectors items.

==== South Ossetian ruble ====
South Ossetia&#x27;s official circulated currency is the South Ossetian ruble, modeled off the Russian ruble, with the same denominations, decimalized to 100 Kopecks. South Ossetia mints 1, 5, 10, 20 and 50 Kopeck coins, as well as 1, 2, 5, 10, 50 and 100 ruble coins. South Ossetia does not print any paper money. The South Ossetian ruble is pegged to the Russian ruble, and is legal tender in South Ossetia, Russia, and Abkhazia, however, are in far less circulation than the Russian ruble, and are also largely ceremonial.

==== Russian ruble ====

By far the most widely used currency in South Ossetia, and one of the Republic&#x27;s official currencies, is the Russian ruble, which have been used in the day to day lives of South Ossetians since their independence in 1991. Additionally, since the South Ossetian ruble is pegged to the Russian ruble, the two are often used interchangeably, and due to the lack of South Ossetian paper money, it is common South Ossetians to use Russian paper money, but South Ossetian coins.

== Culture ==

=== Education ===
The country&#x27;s principal university is South Ossetian State University in Tskhinvali. After the Russo-Georgian War in 2008, education officials attempted to place most university-bound students from South Ossetia in Russian post-secondary education institutions.

=== Public holidays ===
=== Sport ===
South Ossetia has a national football team, which is not a member of FIFA or UEFA. The team won the 2019 CONIFA European Football Cup.

<text>Kurt Masur (; 18 July 192719 December 2015) was a German conductor. Called &quot;one of the last old-style maestros&quot;, he directed many of the principal orchestras of his era. He had a long career as the Kapellmeister of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, and also served as music director of the New York Philharmonic for about ten years. He made many recordings of classical music with major orchestras. Masur is also remembered for his actions to support peaceful demonstrations against the East German government in the 1989 demonstrations in Leipzig; those protests were part of the events leading up to the fall of the Berlin wall.

==Biography==

Masur was born in Brieg, Lower Silesia, Germany (now Brzeg, Poland), and studied piano, composition and conducting in Leipzig, Saxony.
His father was an electrical engineer, and as a young boy he completed an electrician&#x27;s apprenticeship; he occasionally worked in his father&#x27;s shop. From ages 10 to 16, he took piano lessons with Katharina Hartmann.

In October 1944, the Nazis announced that all men between the ages of 16 and 60 could be conscripted, which included the young conductor. Masur was drafted into the paratroopers late in 1944. He was sent to fight; &quot;[o]ut of the 150 people of his unit, only 27 [including Masur] survived&quot;, before being captured by American and British forces on 1 May 1945. Masur and his family were lucky: not a single family member died in the war.

From 1946 until 1948, he studied conducting, composition and piano at the University of Music and Theatre Leipzig. He left at 21, never finishing his studies, when offered a job as répétiteur at the Landestheater Halle an der Saale (since renamed the Halle Opera House, or Opernhaus Halle in German).

Masur was married three times, and had a total of five children. His first marriage to Brigitte Stütze produced three children, and ended in divorce in 1966. He and his second wife, Irmgard Elsa Kaul, had a daughter, Carolin Masur, who became an opera singer. Irmgard died in 1972 in a car accident in which Masur was severely injured. In 1975, he married his third wife, soprano and violist, Tomoko Sakurai: they had one son, Ken-David, a classical singer and conductor.

==Conducting career==
Masur conducted the Dresden Philharmonic for three years ending in 1958 and again from 1967 to 1972. He also worked with the Komische Oper of East Berlin. In 1970, he became Kapellmeister of the Gewandhausorchester Leipzig, serving in that post until 1996. With that orchestra, he performed Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth Symphony at the celebration of German reunification in 1990.

In 1991, Masur became music director of the New York Philharmonic (NYP). He was an unexpected choice who brought change to that orchestra at a time when its reputation had declined. &quot;Masur&#x27;s appointment was a clear signal that it was time for the orchestra to begin anew.&quot; Former concertmaster Glenn Dicterow said in 2012 &quot;It takes a big personality to unite 105 players onstage — to get everybody to be as inspired as he is — and, uh, it&#x27;s hard work, . . And he&#x27;s just so demanding and intense that I think that he got, just by his sheer intensity of his personality, I think it sort of transformed most of us.&quot; Masur directed the Philharmonic in a performance of Brahms&#x27;s &quot;Ein deutsches Requiem&quot; in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001. During his tenure, there were reports of tension between Masur and the NYP&#x27;s Executive Director at the time, Deborah Borda, which eventually contributed to his contract not being renewed beyond 2002. In a television interview with Charlie Rose, Masur stated that regarding his leaving the NYP, &quot;it was not my wish&quot;. Masur stood down as the NYP&#x27;s music director in 2002 and was named its Music Director Emeritus, a new title created for him. The critical consensus was that Masur improved the playing of the orchestra over his tenure.

In 2000, Masur became principal conductor of the London Philharmonic Orchestra (LPO) and held this position until 2007. In April 2002, Masur became music director of the Orchestre National de France (ONF) and served in this post until 2008, when he took the title of honorary music director of the ONF. On his 80th birthday, 18 July 2007, Masur conducted musicians from both orchestras at a Proms concert in London. Masur held the lifetime title of Honorary Guest Conductor of the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra. In 2012, following a series of cancellations of concert engagements, Masur disclosed on his website that he had Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

==Political views==
Although Masur spent most of his professional career in East Germany, he never joined the SED. In 1982, he received the National Prize of East Germany. His attitude to the regime began to change in 1989, after the arrest of a street musician in Leipzig. On 9 October 1989, he intervened in anti-government demonstrations in Leipzig in communist East Germany, negotiating an end to a confrontation that could have resulted in security forces attacking the protesters, one month before the fall of the Berlin wall.

==Death==
In 2015, Masur died at the age of 88 in Greenwich, Connecticut, from complications of Parkinson&#x27;s disease. His funeral was held in the Thomaskirche in Leipzig, with music played by the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra and the Thomanerchor. Burial took place in Leipzig&#x27;s South Cemetery. He was survived by his third wife, as well as his daughters Angelika and Carolin, his sons, Ken-David, Michael and Matthias, and nine grandchildren.

==Awards==

A professor at the Leipzig Academy of Music beginning in 1975, Masur received numerous honors. He received the Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany in 1995, and the Gold Medal of Honor for Music from the National Arts Club in 1996. In 1997, he was made a Commander of the Legion of Honor by the French government, as well as becoming a New York City Cultural Ambassador. In 1999, he received the Commander Cross of Merit of the Polish Republic.

In 2002, President of Germany Johannes Rau awarded him the Cross with Star of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany; in 2007, President of Germany Horst Köhler bestowed upon him the Grand Cross of the Order of Merit with Star and Ribbon; in 2008, he received the Wilhelm Furtwängler Prize in Bonn, Germany. Masur was also made an honorary citizen by his hometown, Brieg. In 2001, Masur became an honorary member of the Royal Academy of Music.

In 2010, he received the Leo Baeck Medal (Leo Baeck Institute) for his humanitarian work promoting tolerance and social justice. He received a Award in 2014 for his work in public policy.

On 18 July 2018, which would have been Masur&#x27;s 91st birthday, Google featured him in a Google Doodle in the United States, Germany, Belarus, Iceland, and Japan.
