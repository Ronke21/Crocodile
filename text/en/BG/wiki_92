<text>The , from &#x27;deeds, actions accomplished&#x27;) is a medieval narrative, a type of epic poem that appears at the dawn of French literature. The earliest known poems of this genre date from the late 11th and early 12th centuries, shortly before the emergence of the lyric poetry of the troubadours and trouvères, and the earliest verse romances. They reached their highest point of acceptance in the period 1150–1250.

Composed in verse, these narrative poems of moderate length (averaging 4000 lines) were originally sung, or (later) recited, by minstrels or jongleurs. More than one hundred &quot;chansons de geste&quot; have survived in approximately three hundred manuscripts that date from the 12th to the 15th century.

==Origins==
Since the 19th century, much critical debate has centered on the origins of the &quot;chansons de geste&quot;, and particularly on explaining the length of time between the composition of the &quot;chansons&quot; and the actual historical events which they reference. The historical events the &quot;chansons&quot; allude to occur in the 8th through 10th centuries, yet the earliest &quot;chansons&quot; that have survived were probably composed at the end of the 11th century: only three &quot;chansons de geste&quot; have a composition that incontestably dates from before 1150: the &quot;Chanson de Guillaume&quot;, &quot;The Song of Roland&quot; and &quot;Gormont et Isembart&quot;: the first half of the &quot;Chanson de Guillaume&quot; may date from as early as the 11th century; &quot;Gormont et Isembart&quot; may date from as early as 1068, according to one expert; and &quot;The Song of Roland&quot; probably dates from after 1086 to c.1100.

Three early theories of the origin of &quot;chansons de geste&quot; believe in the continued existence of epic material (either as lyric poems, epic poems or prose narrations) in these intervening two or three centuries. Critics like Claude Charles Fauriel, François Raynouard and German Romanticists like Jacob Grimm posited the spontaneous creation of lyric poems by the people as a whole at the time of the historic battles, which were later put together to form the epics. This was the basis for the &quot;cantilena&quot; theory of epic origin, which was elaborated by Gaston Paris, although he maintained that single authors, rather than the multitude, were responsible for the songs.

This theory was also supported by Robert Fawtier and by Léon Gautier (although Gautier thought the &quot;cantilenae&quot; were composed in Germanic languages). At the end of the 19th century, Pio Rajna, seeing similarities between the &quot;chansons de geste&quot; and old Germanic/Merovingian tales, posited a Germanic origin for the French poems. A different theory, introduced by the medievalist Paul Meyer, suggested the poems were based on old prose narrations of the original events.

Another theory (largely discredited today), developed by Joseph Bédier, posited that the early &quot;chansons&quot; were recent creations, not earlier than the year 1000, developed by singers who, emulating the songs of &quot;saints&#x27; lives&quot; sung in front of churches (and collaborating with the church clerics), created epic stories based on the heroes whose shrines and tombs dotted the great pilgrimage routes, as a way of drawing pilgrims to these churches. Critics have also suggested that knowledge by clerics of ancient Latin epics may have played a role in their composition.

Subsequent criticism has vacillated between &quot;traditionalists&quot; (&quot;chansons&quot; created as part of a popular tradition) and &quot;individualists&quot; (&quot;chansons&quot; created by a unique author), but more recent historical research has done much to fill in gaps in the literary record and complicate the question of origins. Critics have discovered manuscripts, texts and other traces of the legendary heroes, and further explored the continued existence of a Latin literary tradition (c.f. the scholarship of Ernst Robert Curtius) in the intervening centuries. The work of Jean Rychner on the art of the minstrels and the work of Parry and Lord on Yugoslavian oral traditional poetry, Homeric verse and oral composition have also been suggested to shed light on the &quot;oral&quot; composition of the &quot;chansons&quot;, although this view is not without its critics who maintain the importance of &quot;writing&quot; not only in the preservation of the texts, but also in their composition, especially for the more sophisticated poems.

==Subject matter and structure==
Composed in Old French and apparently intended for oral performance by jongleurs, the &quot;chansons de geste&quot; narrate legendary incidents (sometimes based on real events) in the history of France during the 8th, 9th and 10th centuries, the age of Charles Martel, Charlemagne and Louis the Pious, with emphasis on their conflicts with the Moors and Saracens, and also disputes between kings and their vassals.

The traditional subject matter of the &quot;chansons de geste&quot; became known as the Matter of France. This distinguished them from romances concerned with the Matter of Britain, that is, King Arthur and his knights; and with the so-called Matter of Rome, covering the Trojan War, the conquests of Alexander the Great, the life of Julius Cæsar and some of his Imperial successors, who were given medieval makeovers as exemplars of chivalry.

A key theme of the &quot;chansons de geste&quot;, which set them off from the romances (which tended to explore the role of the &quot;individual&quot;), is their critique and celebration of community/collectivity (their epic heroes are portrayed as figures in the destiny of the nation and Christianity) and their representation of the complexities of feudal relations and service.

The subject matter of the &quot;chansons&quot; evolved over time, according to public taste. Alongside the great battles and scenes of historic prowess of the early &quot;chansons&quot; there began to appear other themes. Realistic elements (money, urban scenes) and elements from the new court culture (female characters, the role of love) began to appear. Other fantasy and adventure elements, derived from the romances, were gradually added: giants, magic, and monsters increasingly appear among the foes along with Muslims. There is also an increasing dose of Eastern adventure, drawing on contemporary experiences in the Crusades; in addition, one series of &quot;chansons&quot; retells the events of the First Crusade and the first years of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. The conflicts of the 14th century (Hundred Years&#x27; War) brought a renewed epic spirit and nationalistic (or propagandistic) fervor to some &quot;chansons de geste&quot; (such as &quot;La Chanson de Hugues Capet&quot;).

The poems contain an assortment of character types; the repertoire of valiant hero, brave traitor, shifty or cowardly traitor, Saracen giant, beautiful Saracen princess, and so forth. As the genre matured, fantasy elements were introduced. Some of the characters that were devised by the poets in this genre include the fairy Oberon, who made his literary debut in &quot;Huon de Bordeaux&quot;; and the magic horse Bayard, who first appears in &quot;Renaud de Montauban&quot;. Quite soon an element of self-parody appears; even the august Charlemagne was not above gentle mockery in the &quot;Pèlerinage de Charlemagne&quot;.

The narrative structure of the has been compared to the one in the Nibelungenlied and in creole legends by Henri Wittmann on the basis of common narreme structure as first developed in the work of Eugene Dorfman and Jean-Pierre Tusseau

==Versification==
Early &quot;chansons de geste&quot; were typically composed in ten-syllable lines grouped in assonanced (meaning that the last stressed vowel is the same in each line throughout the stanza, but the last consonant differs from line to line) stanzas (called &quot;laisses&quot;). These stanzas are of variable length.

An example from the &quot;Chanson de Roland&quot; illustrates the technique of the ten-syllable assonanced form. The assonance in this stanza is on e:
Later &quot;chansons&quot; were composed in monorhyme stanzas, in which the last syllable of each line rhymes fully throughout the stanza. Later &quot;chansons&quot; also tended to be composed using alexandrines (twelve-syllable) lines, instead of ten-syllable lines (some early &quot;chansons&quot;, such as &quot;Girart de Vienne&quot;, were even adapted into a twelve-syllable version).

The following example of the twelve-syllable rhymed form is from the opening lines of &quot;Les Chétifs&quot;, a &quot;chanson&quot; in the Crusade cycle. The rhyme is on ie:
These forms of versification were substantially different than the forms found in the Old French verse romances (&quot;romans&quot;) which were written in octosyllabic rhymed couplets.

==Composition and performance==
The public of the &quot;chansons de geste&quot;—the lay (secular) public of the 11th to the 13th centuries—was largely illiterate, except for (at least to the end of the 12th century) members of the great courts and (in the south) smaller noble families. Thus, the &quot;chansons&quot; were primarily an oral medium.

Opinions vary greatly on whether the early &quot;chansons&quot; were first written down and then read from manuscripts (although parchment was quite expensive) or memorized for performance, or whether portions were improvised, or whether they were entirely the product of spontaneous oral composition and later written down. Similarly, scholars differ greatly on the social condition and literacy of the poets themselves; were they cultured clerics or illiterate jongleurs working within an oral tradition? As an indication of the role played by orality in the tradition of the &quot;chanson de geste&quot;, lines and sometimes whole stanzas, especially in the earlier examples, are noticeably formulaic in nature, making it possible both for the poet to construct a poem in performance and for the audience to grasp a new theme with ease.

Scholarly opinions differ on the exact manner of recitation, but it is generally believed that the &quot;chansons de geste&quot; were originally sung (whereas the medieval romances were probably spoken) by poets, minstrels or jongleurs, who would sometimes accompany themselves, or be accompanied, on the &quot;vielle&quot;, a mediæval fiddle played with a bow. Several manuscript texts include lines in which the jongleur demands attention, threatens to stop singing, promises to continue the next day, and asks for money or gifts. By the middle of the 13th century, singing had probably given way to recitation.

It has been calculated that a reciter could sing about a thousand verses an hour and probably limited himself to 1000–1300 verses by performance, making it likely that the performance of works extended over several days. Given that many &quot;chansons&quot; from the late 12th century on extended to over 10,000 verses or more (for example, &quot;Aspremont&quot; comprises 11,376 verses, while &quot;Quatre Fils Aymon&quot; comprises 18,489 verses), it is conceivable that few spectators heard the longest works in their entirety.

While poems like &quot;The Song of Roland&quot; were sometimes heard in public squares and were no doubt warmly received by a broad public, some critics caution that the &quot;chansons&quot; should probably not be characterized as popular literature and some &quot;chansons&quot; appear particularly tailored for an audience of aristocratic, privileged or warrior classes.

==List of &quot;chansons&quot;==
More than one hundred &quot;chansons de geste&quot; have survived in around three hundred manuscripts that date from the 12th to the 15th century. Several popular &quot;chansons&quot; were written down more than once in varying forms. The earliest &quot;chansons&quot; are all (more or less) anonymous; many later ones have named authors.

By the middle of the 12th century, the corpus of works was being expanded principally by &quot;cyclisation&quot;, that is to say by the formation of &quot;cycles&quot; of &quot;chansons&quot; attached to a character or group of characters—with new &quot;chansons&quot; being added to the ensemble by singing of the earlier or later adventures of the hero, of his youthful exploits (&quot;enfances&quot;), the great deeds of his ancestors or descendants, or his retreat from the world to a convent (&quot;moniage&quot;) – or attached to an event (like the Crusades).

About 1215 Bertrand de Bar-sur-Aube, in the introductory lines to his &quot;Girart de Vienne&quot;, subdivided the Matter of France, the usual subject area of the &quot;chansons de geste&quot;, into three cycles, which revolved around three main characters (see quotation at Matter of France). There are several other less formal lists of &quot;chansons&quot;, or of the legends they incorporate. One can be found in the fabliau entitled &quot;Des Deux Bordeors Ribauz&quot;, a humorous tale of the second half of the 13th century, in which a jongleur lists the stories he knows. Another is included by the Catalan troubadour Guiraut de Cabrera in his humorous &quot;ensenhamen&quot; &quot;Cabra juglar&quot;: this is addressed to a &quot;juglar&quot; (jongleur) and purports to instruct him on the poems he ought to know but does not.

The listing below is arranged according to Bertrand de Bar-sur-Aube&#x27;s cycles, extended with two additional groupings and with a final list of &quot;chansons&quot; that fit into no cycle. There are numerous differences of opinion about the categorization of individual &quot;chansons&quot;.

===&quot;Geste du roi&quot;===

The chief character is usually Charlemagne or one of his immediate successors. A pervasive theme is the King&#x27;s role as champion of Christianity. This cycle contains the first of the &quot;chansons&quot; to be written down, the &quot;Chanson de Roland&quot; or &quot;The Song of Roland&quot;.

* &quot;Chanson de Roland&quot; (c. 1100 for the Oxford text, the earliest written version); several other versions exist, including the Occitan &quot;Ronsasvals&quot;, the Middle High German &quot;Ruolandes liet&quot; and the Latin &quot;Carmen de Prodicione Guenonis&quot;.
* &quot;Le Pèlerinage de Charlemagne&quot; (&quot;Voyage de Charlemagne à Jérusalem et à Constantinople&quot;) dealing with a fictional expedition by Charlemagne and his knights (c. 1140; two 15th century reworkings)
* &quot;Fierabras&quot; (c. 1170)
* &quot;Aspremont&quot; (c. 1190); a later version formed the basis of &quot;Aspramonte&quot; by Andrea da Barberino
* &quot;Anseïs de Carthage&quot; (c. 1200)
* &quot;Chanson de Saisnes&quot; or &quot;Song of the Saxons&quot;, by Jean Bodel (c. 1200)
* &quot;Huon de Bordeaux&quot; originally c. 1215–1240, known from slightly later manuscripts. A &quot;prequel&quot; and four sequels were later added:
**&quot;Auberon&quot;
** &quot;Chanson d&#x27;Esclarmonde&quot;
** &quot;Clarisse et Florent&quot;
** &quot;Yde et Olive&quot;

* &quot;Les Enfances Ogier&quot; by Adenet le Roi (c. 1275) | to Ogier the Dane.
* &quot;Entrée d&#x27;Espagne&quot; (c. 1320)
* &quot;Hugues Capet&quot; (c. 1360)
* &quot;Galiens li Restorés&quot; known from a single manuscript of about 1490
* &quot;Aiquin&quot; or &quot;Acquin&quot;
* &quot;Otuel&quot; or &quot;Otinel&quot;
* &quot;Mainet&quot;
* &quot;Basin&quot;

* &quot;Gui de Bourgogne&quot;
* &quot;Macaire&quot; or &quot;La Chanson de la Reine Sebile&quot;
* &quot;Huon d&#x27;Auvergne&quot;, a &quot;chanson&quot; extant in four versions from Italy (Huondauvergne.org), dating from 1341 to 1441. Whether or not there was ever a French version is debated. The hero is mentioned among epic heroes in the &quot;Ensenhamen&quot; of Guiraut de Cabrera, and figures as a character in &quot;Mainet&quot;.

===&quot;Geste de Garin de Monglane&quot;===

The central character is not Garin de Monglane but his supposed great-grandson, Guillaume d&#x27;Orange. These &quot;chansons&quot; deal with knights who were typically younger sons, not heirs, who seek land and glory through combat with the Infidel (in practice, Muslim) enemy.

* &quot;Chanson de Guillaume&quot; (c. 1100)
* &quot;Couronnement de Louis&quot; (c. 1130)
* &quot;Le Charroi de Nîmes&quot; (c. 1140)
* &quot;La Prise d&#x27;Orange&quot; (c. 1150), reworking of a lost version from before 1122
* &quot;Aliscans&quot; (c. 1180), with several later versions
* &quot;La Bataille Loquifer&quot; by Graindor de Brie (fl. 1170)
* &quot;Le Moniage Rainouart&quot; by Graindor de Brie (fl. 1170)
* &quot;Foulques de Candie&quot;, by Herbert le Duc of Dammartin (fl. 1170)

* &quot;Floovant&quot; (late 12th); the hero is a son of Merovingian King Clovis I
* &quot;Aymeri de Narbonne&quot; by Bertrand de Bar-sur-Aube (late 12th/early 13th)
* &quot;Girart de Vienne&quot; by Bertrand de Bar-sur-Aube (late 12th/early 13th); also found in a later shorter version alongside &quot;Hernaut de Beaulande&quot; and &quot;Renier de Gennes&quot;
* &quot;Les Enfances Garin de Monglane&quot; (15th century)
* &quot;Garin de Monglane&quot; (13th century)
* &quot;Hernaut de Beaulande&quot;; a fragment of the 14th century and a later version
* &quot;Renier de Gennes&quot;
* &quot;Les Enfances Guillaume&quot; (before 1250)
* &quot;Les Narbonnais&quot; (c. 1205), in two parts, known as &quot;Le département des enfants Aymeri&quot;, &quot;Le siège de Narbonne&quot;
* &quot;Les Enfances Vivien&quot; (c. 1205)

* &quot;La Prise de Cordres&quot; (13th century)
* &quot;La Mort Aymeri de Narbonne&quot; (c. 1180)
* &quot;Les Enfances Renier&quot;
* &quot;Le Moniage Guillaume&quot; (1160–1180)

===&quot;Geste de Doon de Mayence&quot;===

This cycle concerns traitors and rebels against royal authority. In each case the revolt ends with the defeat of the rebels and their eventual repentance.

* &quot;Gormond et Isembart&quot;
* &quot;Girart de Roussillon&quot; (1160–1170). The hero Girart de Roussillon also figures in &quot;Girart de Vienne&quot;, in which he is identified as a son of Garin de Monglane. There is a later sequel:
** &quot;Auberi le Bourgoing&quot;
* &quot;Renaud de Montauban&quot; or &quot;Les Quatre Fils Aymon&quot; (end of the 12th century)
* &quot;Raoul de Cambrai&quot;, apparently begun by Bertholais; existing version from end of 12th century
* &quot;Doön de Mayence&quot; (mid-13th century)
* &quot;Doon de Nanteuil&quot; current in the second half of the 12th century, now known only in fragments which derive from a 13th-century version. To this several sequels were attached:
** &quot;Aye d&#x27;Avignon&quot;, probably composed between 1195 and 1205. The fictional heroine is first married to Garnier de Nanteuil, who is the son of Doon de Nanteuil and grandson of Doon de Mayence. After Garnier&#x27;s death she marries the Saracen Ganor
** &quot;Gui de Nanteuil&quot;, evidently popular around 1207 when the troubadour Raimbaut de Vaqueiras mentions the story. The fictional hero is son of the heroine of &quot;Aye d&#x27;Avignon&quot; (to which &quot;Gui de Nanteuil&quot; forms a sequel)
** &quot;Tristan de Nanteuil&quot;. The fictional hero is son of the hero of &quot;Gui de Nanteuil&quot;
** &quot;Parise la Duchesse&quot;. The fictional heroine is daughter of the heroine of Aye d&#x27;Avignon. Exiled from France, she gives birth to a son, Hugues, who becomes king of Hungary
* &quot;Maugis d&#x27;Aigremont&quot;
* &quot;Vivien l&#x27;Amachour de Monbranc&quot;

===Lorraine cycle===

This local cycle of epics of Lorraine traditional history, in the late form in which it is now known, includes details evidently drawn from &quot;Huon de Bordeaux&quot; and &quot;Ogier le Danois&quot;.

* &quot;, prequel, early 13th century
* &quot;, initial epic, 12th century
* &quot;, initial epic, end of 12th–early 13th century
* &quot;, sequel, 13th century, containing the only logical ending to the core story. Its original version is lost, only the narrative being preserved in the prose adaptation by Philippe de Vigneulles (1471–1528).
* &quot;&quot;, sequel, end of 12th–early 13th century
* &quot;Yon&quot;, later known as &quot;&quot;, sequel, 13th century

===Crusade Cycle===

Not listed by Bertrand de Bar-sur-Aube, this cycle deals with the First Crusade and its immediate aftermath.

* &quot;Chanson d&#x27;Antioche&quot;, apparently begun by Richard le Pèlerin c. 1100; earliest surviving text by Graindor de Douai c. 1180; expanded version 14th century
* &quot;Les Chétifs&quot; telling the adventures (mostly fictional) of the poor crusaders led by Peter the Hermit; the hero is Harpin de Bourges. The episode was eventually incorporated, c. 1180, by Graindor de Douai in his reworking of the &quot;Chanson d&#x27;Antioche&quot;
* &quot;Matabrune&quot; tells the story of old Matabrune and of the great-grandfather of Godefroi de Bouillon
* &quot;Le Chevalier au Cigne&quot; tells the story of Elias, grandfather of Godefroi de Bouillon. Originally composed around 1192, it was afterwards extended and divided into several &quot;branches&quot;
* &quot;Les Enfances Godefroi&quot; or &quot;Childhood exploits of Godefroi&quot; tells the story of the youth of Godefroi de Bouillon and his three brothers
* &quot;Chanson de Jérusalem&quot;
* &quot;La Mort de Godefroi de Bouillon&quot;, quite unhistorical, narrates Godefroi&#x27;s poisoning by the Patriarch of Jerusalem
* &quot;Baudouin de Sebourc&quot; (mid-14th century)
* &quot;Bâtard de Bouillon&quot; (early 14th century)

===Others===
* &quot;Gormont et Isembart&quot;
* &quot;Ami et Amile&quot;, followed by a sequel:
** &quot;Jourdain de Blaye&quot;
* &quot;Beuve de Hanstonne&quot;, and a related poem:
** &quot;Daurel et Beton&quot;, whose putative Old French version is lost; the story is known from an Occitan version of c. 1200
* &quot;Aigar et Maurin&quot;
* &quot;Aïmer le Chétif&quot;, a lost &quot;chanson&quot;
* &quot;Aiol&quot; (13th century)
* &quot;Théséus de Cologne&quot;, possibly a romance
* &quot;Siège d&#x27;Antioche&quot;

The &quot;chansons de geste&quot; reached their apogee in the period 1150–1250. By the middle of the 13th century, public taste in France had begun to abandon these epics, preferring, rather, the romances. As the genre progressed in the middle of the 13th century, only certain traits (like versification, &quot;laisse&quot; structure, formulaic forms, setting, and other clichés of the genre) remained to set the &quot;chansons&quot; apart from the romances. The 15th century saw the cycles of &quot;chansons&quot; (along with other chronicles) converted into large prose compilations (such as the compilation made by David Aubert). Yet, the themes of the epics continued to exert an influence through the 16th century.

==Legacy and adaptations==
The &quot;chansons de geste&quot; created a body of mythology that lived on well after they ceased to be produced in France.

The French &quot;chanson&quot; gave rise to the Old Spanish tradition of the &quot;cantar de gesta&quot;.

The &quot;chanson de geste&quot; was also adapted in southern (Occitan-speaking) France. One of the three surviving manuscripts of the &quot;chanson&quot; Girart de Roussillon (12th century) is in Occitan, as are two works based on the story of Charlemagne and Roland, &quot;Rollan a Saragossa&quot; and &quot;Ronsasvals&quot; (early 12th century). The &quot;chanson de geste&quot; form was also used in such Occitan texts as &quot;Canso d&#x27;Antioca&quot; (late 12th century), &quot;Daurel e Betó&quot; (first half of the 13th century), and &quot;Song of the Albigensian Crusade&quot; (c.1275) (cf Occitan literature).

In medieval Germany, the &quot;chansons de geste&quot; elicited little interest from the German courtly audience, unlike the romances which were much appreciated. While &quot;The Song of Roland&quot; was among the first French epics to be translated into German (by Konrad der Pfaffe as the &quot;Rolandslied&quot;, c.1170), and the German poet Wolfram von Eschenbach based his (incomplete) 13th century epic &quot;Willehalm&quot; (consisting of seventy-eight manuscripts) on the &quot;Aliscans&quot;, a work in the cycle of William of Orange (Eschenbach&#x27;s work had a great success in Germany), these remained isolated examples. Other than a few other works translated from the cycle of Charlemagne in the 13th century, the &quot;chansons de geste&quot; were not adapted into German, and it is believed that this was because the epic poems lacked what the romances specialized in portraying: scenes of idealized knighthood, love and courtly society.

In the late 13th century, certain French &quot;chansons de geste&quot; were adapted into the Old Norse &quot;Karlamagnús saga&quot;.

In Italy, there exist several 14th-century texts in verse or prose which recount the feats of Charlemagne in Spain, including a &quot;chanson de geste&quot; in Franco-Venetian, the &quot;Entrée d&#x27;Espagne&quot; (c.1320) (notable for transforming the character of Roland into a knight errant, similar to heroes from the Arthurian romances), and a similar Italian epic &quot;La Spagna&quot; (1350–1360) in ottava rima. Through such works, the &quot;Matter of France&quot; became an important source of material (albeit significantly transformed) in Italian romantic epics. &quot;Morgante&quot; (c.1483) by Luigi Pulci, &quot;Orlando innamorato&quot; (1495) by Matteo Maria Boiardo, &quot;Orlando furioso&quot; (1516) by Ludovico Ariosto, and &quot;Jerusalem Delivered&quot; (1581) by Torquato Tasso are all indebted to the French narrative material (the Pulci, Boiardo and Ariosto poems are founded on the legends of the paladins of Charlemagne, and particularly, of Roland, translated as &quot;Orlando&quot;).

The incidents and plot devices of the Italian epics later became central to works of English literature such as Edmund Spenser&#x27;s &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot;; Spenser attempted to adapt the form devised to tell the tale of the triumph of Christianity over Islam to tell instead of the triumph of Protestantism over Roman Catholicism.

The Welsh poet, painter, soldier and engraver David Jones&#x27;s Modernist poem &quot;In Parenthesis&quot; was described by contemporary critic Herbert Read as having &quot;the heroic ring which we associate with the old chansons de geste&quot;.

<text>The Spencer Gulf is the westernmost and larger of two large inlets (the other being Gulf St Vincent) on the southern coast of Australia, in the state of South Australia, facing the Great Australian Bight. It spans from the Cape Catastrophe and Eyre Peninsula in the west to Cape Spencer and Yorke Peninsula in the east.

The largest towns on the gulf are Port Lincoln, Whyalla, Port Pirie, and Port Augusta. Smaller towns on the gulf include Tumby Bay, Port Neill, Arno Bay, Cowell, Port Germein, Port Broughton, Wallaroo, Port Hughes, Port Victoria, Port Rickaby, Point Turton, and Corny Point.

==History==
The first recorded exploration of the gulf was that of Matthew Flinders in February 1802. Flinders navigated inland from the present location of Port Augusta to within of the termination of the water body.

The gulf was named &quot;Spencer&#x27;s Gulph&quot; by Flinders on 20 March 1802, after George John Spencer, the 2nd Earl Spencer. The Baudin expedition visited the gulf after Flinders with Nicholas Baudin giving it the name &quot;Golfe Bonaparte&quot; and Louis de Freycinet using the name &quot;Golfe de la Melomanie&quot; on the expedition&#x27;s published charts.

By the 1830s, the natural harbour of Port Lincoln had become the site of an unofficial settlement, due in part to its convenience as a base for whaling vessels – which had long operated in the Great Australian Bight. Prior to the selection of Adelaide, some consideration was given to Port Lincoln as the potential site of a capital city.

==Geography and topography==
The Gulf is wide at its mouth (from Cape Catastrophe to Cape Spencer) and long (from its mouth to Port Augusta). The western shore of the gulf is the Eyre Peninsula, while the eastern side is the Yorke Peninsula, which separates it from the smaller Gulf St Vincent. Its entrance was defined by Matthew Flinders in 1802 as a line from Cape Catastrophe on Eyre Peninsula to Cape Spencer on Yorke Peninsula. At the time of Flinders&#x27; exploration the gulf was noted to extend inland from a point near the Port Augusta crossing. This so-called extension of the gulf consists of a land depression and occasional watercourse known as the Pirie–Torrens corridor, and the inland waterbody Lake Torrens.

The northern end of the gulf is spanned by the Joy Baluch AM Bridge between Port Augusta and Port Augusta West and further north by Yorkey Crossing.

Informal names for subdivisions of the gulf waters are sometimes used. &quot;Northern Spencer Gulf&quot; refers to waters north of Wallaroo and Arno Bay, while &quot;Southern Spencer Gulf&quot; refers to waters south of that line, extending to the mouth of the gulf. &quot;Upper Spencer Gulf&quot; includes the waters north of Port Pirie, and includes the three towns sometimes referred to as the Iron Triangle: Whyalla, Port Augusta and Port Pirie. Its boundary lacks precise definition.

==Wildlife==
The land surrounding the gulf, consisting of the Eyre and Yorke Peninsulas, is the Eyre Yorke Block bioregion. This was originally wooded shrubland but has now mainly been cleared for agriculture. The arid Gawler bioregion extends to the Spencer Gulf on the north-west. Many of South Australia&#x27;s iconic marine species can be found on the shores and in the waters of Spencer Gulf.

=== Marine species ===
The rocky inshore reef along the coast near Port Bonython and Point Lowly is a breeding ground for the Northern Spencer Gulf population of Australian giant cuttlefish. They are a favorite food of local bottlenose dolphins, who have developed sophisticated techniques for safely eating these creatures. The Upper Spencer Gulf is also known for its snapper and Yellowtail kingfish fishing. Great white sharks are sometimes seen in Spencer Gulf by fishermen, and shark cage diving and surface tours operate out of Port Lincoln.

A relic population of tiger pipefish (&quot;Filicampus tigris&quot;), a subtropical species is range limited to Northern Spencer Gulf.

=== Marine mammals ===
Visiting southern right whales and humpback whales enter Spencer Gulf from June through to October, and can be seen as far north as Point Lowly and Port Augusta. New Zealand fur seals and Australian sea lions can be found in southern Spencer Gulf, with significant breeding colonies located at Dangerous Reef and in the Sir Joseph Banks Group. Occasional sightings occurring in Northern Spencer Gulf. Bottlenose dolphins can be seen in the gulf&#x27;s waters year-round.

=== Seabirds ===
Breeding colonies of little penguins exist on islands in Spencer Gulf. The northernmost colonies are located at Lipson Island and Wardang Island. In 2004, the Wardang Island colony&#x27;s population was approximately 8,000 penguins. Cape Barren geese and several species of cormorants also breed on islands in Spencer Gulf.

== Islands ==
Spencer Gulf contains a number of inshore and offshore islands. These include (from north to south): 
* Curlew Island (south of Port Augusta)
* Weeroona Island (north of Port Pirie)
* Shag Island (north of Port Broughton)
* Entrance Island (near Cowell)
* Bird Islands (near Wallaroo)
* Lipson Island (north of Tumby Bay)
* Tumby Island (south of Tumby Bay)
* Wardang Island &amp; the Goose Island group (near Port Victoria)
* The Sir Joseph Banks Group (offshore from Tumby Bay)
* Louth Island &amp; Rabbit Island (in Louth Bay)
* Boston Island (in Boston Bay)
* Grantham Island and Bicker Isles (in Proper Bay)
* Donington Island, Carcase Rock, Owen Island, Taylor Island, Grindal Island, Little Island, Lewis Island, Smith Island, Hopkins Island and Thistle Island (east of the Jussieu Peninsula).
* Middle Island, South Island and Royston Island (in Pondalowie Bay)
* Gambier Islands including Wedge Island (in the mouth of Spencer Gulf)

== Port development proposals ==
Due to its proximity to many identified mineral deposits in South Australia&#x27;s Far North, Eyre Peninsula and Braemar regions, there are multiple new port and harbour developments proposed for the region.

These include new or expanded facilities at (from north to south):
* Port Bonython - Port Bonython Bulk Commodities Export Facility - Spencer Gulf Port Link (proposed 2012)
*Port Playford - Iron ore transshipment port proposed to be constructed on the site of the former Playford A Power Station, south of Port Augusta
* Whyalla - Inner harbour expansion - Arrium (completed 2013)
* Port Pirie - Possible expansion for trans-shipment of iron ore from the Braemar region (concept stage)
* Lucky Bay - Lucky Bay Common User Export Facility (harbour expansion) - SeaSA (proposed 2013, construction commenced 2014)
* Myponie Point - Possible port location for Braemar region mineral exports (concept stage)
* Cape Hardy - Iron Road Limited (proposed 2013)
* Lipson Cove - Port Spencer (formerly known as Sheep Hill) - Centrex Metals (proposed 2011) The port could be completed in 2023.

== Seawater desalination plants ==
In 2022, the government of South Australia announced the Northern Water Supply Project, which as of 2023, is considering a business case for establishing a large seawater desalination plant in the upper Spencer Gulf. If constructed, water will be supplied for use to the Olympic Dam and Carapateena copper mines in the state&#x27;s far north. It is also intended to supply water for a prospective hydrogen export industry. An environmental impact statement for the project is anticipated mid-2024. 

, one reverse osmosis and one thermal seawater desalination plant draw water from Spencer Gulf. Several others are planned. All currently or will produce water primarily or exclusively for industrial use. They are:

== Spencer Gulf in film &amp; video ==
The Spencer Gulf region, its wildlife and its development are the subjects of a documentary film in production (as of 2020) entitled &quot;Cuttlefish Country&quot;.

==Protected areas==

===Reserves declared by the South Australian government===

====Aquatic Reserves====
Spencer Gulf contains four aquatic reserves.

Blanche Harbour-Douglas Bank Aquatic Reserve which is located in west side of Spencer
Gulf, north of Whyalla, was declared in 1980 &#x27;for fisheries management, protection of its mangrove-seagrass communities and associated fish nursery areas.&#x27; 

Goose Island Aquatic Reserve which is located at Goose Island on the east side of Spencer Gulf near Port Victoria was d eclared in 1971 to provide &#x27;a conservation area where teaching institutions may conduct classes and scientific research on marine biology and ecology and to protect the habitat of the seal colony situated on White Rocks.&#x27;

Whyalla - Cowleds Landing Aquatic Reserve which is located on the west side of Spencer Gulf, just south of Whyalla, was declared in 1980 to &#x27;protect the mangrove-seagrass communities and associated fish nursery areas.&#x27;

Yatala Harbour Upper Spencer Gulf Aquatic Reserve which is located in Yatala Harbour on the east side of Spencer Gulf, north of Port Pirie, was declared in 1980 for &#x27;the protection of its mangrove-seagrass communities and associated fish nursery areas.&#x27;

==== Marine Parks ====
Spencer Gulf contains five marine parks, each with its own outer boundary and internal zoning. Fishing is prohibited with Sanctuary Zones, and detailed maps and GPS coordinates for the parks are available from the Government of South Australia&#x27;s Department of Environment, Water &amp; Natural Resources.

The marine parks within Spencer Gulf are (from north to south):
* Upper Spencer Gulf Marine Park
* Franklin Harbor Marine Park
* Eastern Spencer Gulf Marine Park 
* Sir Joseph Banks Group Marine Park
* Southern Spencer Gulf Marine Park

====Terrestrial reserves====
A number of terrestrial reserves either adjoin Spencer Gulf at low water or are located on islands within the gulf. On the west coast of the gulf, from north to south, they are Munyaroo Conservation Park, Franklin Harbor Conservation Park, Lipson Island Conservation Park, Tumby Island Conservation Park, Sir Joseph Banks Group Conservation Park, Lincoln National Park and Memory Cove Wilderness Protection Area. On the east coast of the gulf, from north to south, they are Winninowie Conservation Park, Bird Islands Conservation Park, Goose Island Conservation Park, Leven Beach Conservation Park and Innes National Park. At the mouth of the gulf, the Gambier Islands Conservation Park is located within the Gambier Islands group.

===Non-statutory arrangements===

====Important Bird Areas====
Three Important Bird Areas (IBAs) have been nominated by BirdLife International at locations in Spencer Gulf. The Spencer Gulf Important Bird Area lies along the north-eastern coast of the Gulf; it comprises a strip of coastal land consisting mainly of intertidal mudflats, mangroves and salt marshes. It was identified as an IBA by BirdLife International because of its importance for the conservation of waders, or shorebirds. The other two IBAs within Spencer Gulf are located in the Sir Joseph Banks Group and at Goose Island. Both sites contain breeding colonies of various island seabird species.

<doc id="321453" wikidata="Q14875286" url="?curid=321453" title="Malton, Mississauga">
<text>Malton is a neighbourhood in the northeastern part of the city of Mississauga, Ontario, Canada, located to the northwest of Toronto.

Malton is bounded by Highway 427 to the east, the Brampton city limits (a Canadian National Railway (CN) rail line) to the north, Airport Road to the west, and a second CN line and Toronto Pearson International Airport to the south. Malton is unique in that it does not adjoin any other Mississauga neighbourhood, being separated by the airport and extensive industrial areas. All of the roads in this area are named after cities in the United Kingdom. Mimico Creek flows through Malton. The oldest portion of Malton is located on the northwest corner of Airport and Derry Roads.

Together, the Malton and Britannia Woods areas compose Ward 5.

==History==
===1820–1936===
The Second Purchase from the Mississauga Indians on Wednesday, October 28, 1818, was for 648,000 acres. Toronto Township received 34,556 acres, increasing its total acreage to 64,125. The Toronto Township expansion included Malton Village.

The village of Malton took up the east half of Lot 11, Concession 6, East of Hurontario Street (EHS). This was the 100-acre land grant of Joseph Price that was designated in 1821. Most sources say Malton was first settled in 1819 or 1820.

The northeast corner of Toronto Township was first settled in 1820 by Richard Halliday. There is no Halliday listed in the Land Registry papers, so he probably was a squatter and then rented, or his purchase was not registered. Halliday was the local blacksmith and innkeeper, and he named the settlement Malton, after his home in England, Malton, North Yorkshire.

Another early settler was Joseph Tomlinson. His land petition was dated August 25, 1819. He and his wife Mary came to Malton in August 1820 to claim his 100-acre land grant; the east half of Lot 10, Conc. 7. Joseph built a cabin 16x20, cleared and fenced 5 acres, cleared the roadway in front of the property within 18 months to comply with the conditions of his land grant.

Other early settlers included:

*Samuel and Margaret Shaw 1821 200 acres S half Lot 10, W half of Lot 11 Con. 8 
*Henry and Elizabeth Brocklebank 1821 
*Samuel Moore 1822. Samuel Moore was the son of John Moore who on April 3, 1822 purchased Robert Chamber&#x27;s 100-acre grant; the West half of Lot 11, Con. 6 

In the 1840s, the Blanchard family cleared land northwest of the Four Corners and the area became the Village of Malton.

In 1850, when Toronto Township was incorporated, Malton had a population of 350. The introduction of the Grand Trunk Railway in 1854, allowed better access to Toronto markets for local farmers and Malton thrived as a result. The village of Malton was subdivided in 1855. The population was 600 in 1864. Malton was chosen as the county seat in 1867, but Brampton contested the decision and was awarded the county seat a year later. Its economic prosperity declined, as did the population, to 200. The opportunity for advancement was dealt another blow when the Credit Valley Railway came to Dixie, Streetsville, Meadowvale and Churchville in 1879. Malton suffered with the drop in shipping business.

Malton was organized as a police village in 1914.

===1937–1945===
In 1937, Malton experienced a major shift from agricultural to an industrial economy when 13 farms were selected to become the location of a &#x27;million dollar, world class airport&#x27; (now Toronto Pearson International Airport) and location for a new Aircraft manufacturing Industry.

In April 1937, Land agents representing the Toronto Harbour Commission approached the farmers of Malton who owned Lots 6-10 on Concession 5 and 6 to acquire land for Malton Airport. The farmers were: 
*Mrs. Thomas Osborne - 100 acres (Conc. 6, Lot 10) - This farm was on the SW corner of Malton &quot;Four Corners&quot; - Airport (6th line) and Derry Roads
*Robert H. Peacock - 100 acres (Conc. 6, Lot 9),
*Frank Chapman - 100 acres (Conc. 6, Lot 8)
*Rowland Estate - 100 acres (Conc. 6, Lot 7)
*Frank Chapman - 50 acres (Conc. 6, Lot 6)
*A. Schrieber - 100 acres (Conc. 5E, Lot 10)
*W.A. Cripps - 200 acres (Conc. 5W, Lot 10)
*Wilbur Martin - 100 acres (Conc. 5E, Lot 9)
*David J. Lammy - 150 acres (Conc. 5W, Lot 9)
*Mack Brett - 150 acres (Conc.5W, Lot 8,9)
*John H. Perry - 100 acres (Conc. 5E, Lot 8)
*Lydia Garbutt - 100 acres (Conc. 5W, Lot 8)
*John Dempster - 100 acres (Conc. 5E, Lot 7)
*Horace C. Death - 99 acres (Conc. 5E, Lot 6) - This farm was on the NE corner of Elmbank (Britannia) Road and 5th Line (Torbram Road), closest to the Village of Elmbank.

In 1937 the agreements were drawn up for a total purchase of 1410.8 acres (including 108 acres for National Steel Car and 243.73 for Department of National Defence).

====Airport====

The Chapman Farm house was the first airport terminal (1937). In 1939, a wooden terminal that was identical to the one built at Toronto City Centre Airport, replaced the Chapman Farm House as the airport terminal.

Malton Airport was also the site of the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan facilities during the war-time years.

====Aircraft industry====

National Steel Car built a manufacturing plant in 1938. It produced Westland Lysanders and was subcontractor for production of other aircraft. On November 4, 1942, the Federal government expropriated National Steel Car and set up the crown corporation called Victory Aircraft. Victory Aircraft produced Avro Lancaster bombers from 1942 to 1945.

====Victory Village====
In 1942, the Canadian Government expropriated the north part of the former Fred Codlin farm and built 200 military-style houses for war-time workers. &quot;Victory Village&quot; streets had war-time references; Victory, McNaughton (Andrew McNaughton, commander of the Canadian Forces in the UK), Churchill and Lancaster (Avro Lancasters were built at Victory Aircraft from 1943 to 1945).
Victory Community Hall was built shortly after (at Victory Park) and was renovated in 2010.

There were two other streets in the Village, Anson Ave. &amp; Merrit Ave. Anson ran horizontally at the top of Lancaster. Merrit ran behind Churchill Ave.

===1945–1969===
Originally on the border (Airport Road) between Toronto Gore and Toronto Townships, Malton became part of Toronto Township in 1952, following the annexation of that part of Toronto Gore south of Steeles Avenue. When Toronto Township was erected into the Town of Mississauga in 1967, the Police Village of Malton was dissolved. Mississauga became a city in 1974.

====Airport====

The Trans-Canada Airport terminal replaced the wooden terminal in 1949. The Trans-Canada Terminal was replaced by the Aeroquay Terminal in 1964.

====Aircraft industry====

A.V. Roe Canada Limited was established on December 1, 1945 and assumed control of Victory Aircraft. In 1946, A.V. Roe acquired Turbo Research Limited, which was later renamed Orenda Engines. On August 10, 1949, the Avro Jetliner made its first flight. On January 19, 1950 the CF-100 Jet Interceptor/Fighter made its maiden flight.

By 1958, Malton acquired an international reputation as a leader in aeronautical design and manufacturing. Malton was the home of the famous Avro Arrow, Canada&#x27;s first supersonic aircraft, still believed to have been years ahead of its time. On February 20, 1959, Prime Minister John Diefenbaker terminated the project and the five completed Arrows were dismantled.
After the cancellation of the Avro Arrow program in 1959, the plant was operated by de Havilland Canada (1962), Douglas Aircraft (1965) McDonnell Douglas Canada (1981), and Boeing Canada (1997) before being demolished in 2005.

====Housing====

<doc id="321459" wikidata="Q7311376" url="?curid=321459" title="Religion and circumcision">
<text>Religious circumcision is generally performed shortly after birth, during childhood, or around puberty as part of a rite of passage. Circumcision for religious reasons is most frequently practiced in Judaism and Islam. 

==Abrahamic religions==
===Judaism===
===Christianity===
==== Ancient church ====
==== Modern Christianity ====
Circumcision is considered a customary practice among Oriental Christian denominations such as the Coptic, Ethiopian, and Eritrean Orthodox churches. The practice is near-universal in the Ethiopian Orthodox Church. Some Christian churches in South Africa oppose circumcision, viewing it as a pagan ritual, while others, including the Nomiya church in Kenya, require circumcision. It is common in Cameroon, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ghana, Liberia, and Nigeria. Circumcision is widely practiced among Christian communities in the Anglosphere, Oceania, South Korea, the Philippines, and the Middle East. Circumcision is rare in Europe, East Asia, as well as in India. Christians in the East and West Indies (excluding the Philippines) do not practice it. Circumcision is also widely practiced among Christian communities in Philippines, South Korea, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Palestine, Israel, and North Africa.

The Lutheran Church and the Greek Orthodox Church celebrate the Circumcision of Christ on 1 January, while Orthodox churches following the Julian calendar celebrate it on 14 January. All Orthodox churches consider it a &quot;Great Feast&quot;. In much of Western Christianity, the Feast of the Circumcision of Christ has been replaced by other commemorations, such as the Solemnity of Mary in the Roman Catholic Church or the Feast of the Holy Name of Jesus in the Lutheran Churches. Exceptions, such as among most Traditionalist Catholics, who reject Novus Ordo and other changes following Vatican II to varying degrees, maintained the feast as a Holy day of obligation.

According to Scholar Heather L. Armstrong of University of Southampton, about half of Christian males worldwide are circumcised, with most of them being located in Africa, Anglosphere countries (with notable prevalence in the United States) and the Philippines. Many Christians have been circumcised for reasons such as family preferences, medical or cultural reasons. Circumcision is also part of a traditional practice among the adherents of certain Oriental Christian denominations, including those of Coptic Christianity, the Ethiopian Orthodox Church and Eritrean Orthodox Church.

==== Roman Catholic Church ====
The Roman Catholic Church denounced religious circumcision for its members in the &quot;Cantate Domino&quot;, written during the 11th Council of Florence in 1442, warning of loss of salvation for converts who observe it. This decision was based on the belief that baptism had superseded circumcision (), and may also have been a response to Coptic Christians, who continued to practice circumcision.

Origen stated in his work &quot;Contra Celsum&quot; that circumcision &quot;was discontinued by Jesus, who desired that His disciples should not practise it.&quot;

Pope Pius XII taught that circumcision is only §&quot;[morally] permissible if, in accordance with therapeutic principles, it prevents a disease that cannot be countered in any other way.&quot;

On another occasion, he stated:
The Church has been viewed as maintaining a neutral position on the practice of cultural circumcision, due to its policy of inculturation, although some Catholic scholars argue that the church condemns it as &quot;elective male infant circumcision not only violates the proper application of the time-honored principle of totality, but even fits the ethical definition of mutilation, which is gravely sinful.&quot;

Fr. John J. Dietzen, a priest and columnist, argued that paragraph number 2297 from the Catholic Catechism (Respect for bodily integrity) makes the practice of elective and neonatal circumcision immoral. John Paul Slosar and Daniel O&#x27;Brien, counter that the therapeutic benefits of neonatal circumcision are inconclusive, but that recent findings that circumcision may prevent disease puts the practice outside the realm of paragraph 2297. They claim that the &quot;Respect for bodily integrity&quot; paragraph apply in the context of kidnapping, hostage-taking or torture, and that if circumcision is included, any removal of tissue or follicle could be considered a violation of moral law. The proportionality of harm versus benefit of medical procedures, as defined by Directives 29 and 33 of the Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic Health Care Services (National Conference of Catholic Bishops), have been interpreted to support and reject circumcision. These arguments represent the conscience of the individual writers, and not official doctrine. The most recent statement from the Church was that of Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI:

The Church of Antioch sent Barnabas on a mission with Paul, which became known as the Apostle&#x27;s first missionary journey . . . Together with Paul, he then went to the so-called Council of Jerusalem where after a profound examination of the question, the Apostles with the Elders decided to discontinue the practice of circumcision so that it was no longer a feature of the Christian identity (cf. Acts 15: 1-35). It was only in this way that, in the end, they officially made possible the Church of the Gentiles, a Church without circumcision; we are children of Abraham simply through faith in Christ.
====Latter Day Saints====
Passages from scriptures connected with the Latter Day Saint movement (Mormons) explain that the &quot;law of circumcision is done away&quot; by Christ and thus unnecessary.

===Druze ===
Circumcision is widely practiced by the Druze: practiced as a cultural tradition, and has no religious significance. No special interval is specified: Druze infants are usually circumcised shortly after birth, however some remain uncircumcised until age ten or older. Some Druses do not circumcise their male children, and refuse to observe this &quot;common Muslim practice&quot;.

===Islam===

The origin of circumcision in Islam is a matter of religious and scholarly debate. It is mentioned in some &quot;hadith&quot; and the &quot;sunnah&quot;, but not in the Quran, though perhaps it is implied by the command to &quot;follow the way of Ibrahim, the true in Faith&quot;. In the time of Muhammad, circumcision was carried out by Pagan Arabian tribes, and by the Jewish tribes of Arabia for religious reasons. This was attested by al-Jahiz and by Jewish historian Flavius Josephus.

The four schools of Islamic jurisprudence have different views towards circumcision.Some state that it is recommendable, others that it is permissible but not binding, while others regard it as a legal obligation. According to Shafi‘i and Hanbali jurists male circumcision is obligatory for Muslims, while Hanafi jurists consider circumcision to be recommendable. Some Salafis have argued that circumcision is required in Islam to provide ritual cleanliness based on the covenant with Abraham. 

Whereas Jewish circumcision is closely bound by ritual timing and tradition, Islam states no fixed age for circumcision. In Muslim communities, children are often circumcised in late childhood or early adolescence. It varies by family, region, and country. The age when boys get circumcised, and the procedures used, tend to change across cultures, families, and time. In some Muslim-majority countries, circumcision is performed after boys have learned to recite the Quran from start to finish. In Malaysia and other regions, the boy usually undergoes the operation between the ages of ten and twelve, and is thus a puberty rite, serving to introduce him in the adult world. The procedure is sometimes semi-public, accompanied with music, special foods, and much festivity.

Islam has no equivalent of a Jewish mohel. Circumcisions are usually carried out in health facilities or hospitals, and performed by trained medical practitioners. The circumciser can be either male or female, and is not required to be a Muslim, and circumcision is not required of converts to Islam.

==Indian religions==

Hindu canons make no reference to circumcision. Both Hinduism and Buddhism appear to have a neutral view on circumcision. However, Hinduism discourages non-medical circumcision, as according to them, the body is made by almighty God, and nobody has right to alter it without the concern of the person who is going for it. Certain Hindu gurus consider it to be directly against nature and God&#x27;s Design.
Sikh infants are not circumcised. Sikhism criticizes the practice. For example, Bhagat Kabir criticizes the practise of circumcision in the following hymn of Guru Granth Sahib.

==Africa==

In West Africa, infant circumcision had religious significance as a rite of passage or otherwise in the past; today in some non-Muslim Nigerian societies it is medicalised and is simply a cultural norm. In many West African traditional societies circumcision has become medicalised and is simply performed in infancy without ado or any particular conscious cultural significance. Among the Urhobo of southern Nigeria it is symbolic of a boy entering into manhood. The ritual expression, &quot;Omo te Oshare&quot; (&quot;the boy is now man&quot;), constitutes a rite of passage from one age set to another.

In East Africa, specifically in Kenya among various so-classified Bantu and Nilotic peoples, such as the Maragoli and Idakho of the Luhya super-ethnic group, the Kikuyu, Kalenjin and Maasai, circumcision is a rite of passage observed collectively by a number of boys every few years, and boys circumcised at the same time are taken to be members of a single age set.

Authority derives from the age-group and the age-set. Prior to circumcision a natural leader or Olaiguenani is selected; he leads his age-group through a series of rituals until old age, sharing responsibility with a select few, of whom the ritual expert (Oloiboni) is the ultimate authority. Masai youths are not circumcised until they are mature, and a new age-set is initiated together at regular intervals of twelve to fifteen years. The young warriors (Il-Murran) remain initiates for some time, using blunt arrows to hunt small birds which are stuffed and tied to a frame to form a head-dress. Traditionally, among the Luhya, boys of certain age-sets, typically between 8 and 18 years of age would, under the leadership of specific men engage in various rites leading up to the day of circumcision. After circumcision, they would live apart from the rest of society for a certain number of days. Not even their mothers nor sisters would be allowed to see them.

The Xhosa Tribe from the Eastern Cape in South Africa has a circumcision ritual. The ceremony is part of a transition to manhood. It is called the Abakwetha - &quot;A Group Learning&quot;. A group of normally five aged between 16 and 20 go off for three months and live in a special hut (sutu). The circumcision is the climax of the ritual. Nelson Mandela describes his experiences undergoing this ritual in his biography, &quot;Long Walk to Freedom&quot;. Traditional circumcisions are often performed in unsterile conditions where no anesthetic is administered; improper treatment of the wound can lead to sepsis and dehydration, which has in the past lead to initiate deaths.

Among some West African animist groups, such as the Dogon and Dowayo, circumcision represents a removal of &quot;feminine&quot; aspects of the male, turning boys into fully masculine males.

==Ancient Egypt==
Sixth Dynasty (2345–2181 ) tomb artwork in Egypt is thought to be the oldest documentary evidence of circumcision. The most ancient depiction is a bas-relief from the necropolis at Saqqara ( 2400 ) with the inscription &quot;Hold him and do not allow him to faint&quot;. The oldest written account, by an Egyptian named Uha, in the 23rd century , describes a mass circumcision and boasts of his ability to stoically endure the pain: &quot;When I was circumcised, together with one hundred and twenty men ... there was none thereof who hit out, there was none thereof who was hit, and there was none thereof who scratched and there was none thereof who was scratched.&quot;

Circumcision in ancient Egypt was thought to be a rite of passage from childhood to adulthood. The alteration of the body and ritual of circumcision was supposed to give access to ancient mysteries reserved for the initiated. The content of those mysteries are unclear but are likely to be myths, prayers, and incantations central to Egyptian religion. The Egyptian Book of the Dead, for example, tells of the sun god Ra performing a self-circumcision, whose blood created two minor guardian deities. Circumcisions were performed by priests in a public ceremony, using a stone blade. It is thought to have been more popular among society&#x27;s upper echelons, although it was not universal and those lower down the social order also had the procedure.

==Asia==
In early 2007 it was announced that rural aidpost orderlies in the East Sepik Province of Papua New Guinea were to undergo training in circumcision with a view to introducing the procedure as a means of prophylaxis against HIV/AIDS, which was becoming a significant problem in the country.

Neither the Avesta nor the Zoroastrian Pahlavi texts mention circumcision. Traditionally, Zoroastrians do not practice circumcision. Circumcision is not required in Yazidism, but is practised by some Yazidis due to regional customs. 

Circumcision is forbidden in Mandaeism, and the sign of the Jews given to Abraham by God, circumcision, is considered abhorrent. According to the Mandaean doctrine a circumcised man cannot serve as a priest.

Circumcision in South Korea is largely the result of American cultural and military influence following the Korean War.

The origin of circumcision (&quot;tuli&quot;) in the Philippines is uncertain. One newspaper article speculates that it is due to the influence of Western colonisation. However, Antonio de Morga&#x27;s 17th-century &quot;History of the Philippine Islands&quot; documents its existence in pre-Colonial Philippines, owing it to Islamic influence.

Circumcision is not a religious practice of the Bahá&#x27;í Faith, and leaves that decision to the parents.

Like Judaism, the religion of Samaritanism requires ritual circumcision on the eighth day of life.

==Oceania==
Circumcision is part of initiation rites in some Pacific Island, and Australian aboriginal traditions in areas such as Arnhem Land, where the practice was introduced by Makassan traders from Sulawesi. Circumcision ceremonies among certain Australian aboriginal societies are noted for their painful nature, including subincision for some aboriginal peoples in the Western Desert.

In the Pacific, ritual circumcision is nearly universal in the Melanesian islands of Fiji and Vanuatu; participation in the traditional land diving on Pentecost Island is reserved for those who have been circumcised. Circumcision is also commonly practised in the Polynesian islands of Samoa, Tonga, Niue, and Tikopia. In Samoa, it is accompanied by a celebration.

<text>The Murrumbidgee River () is a major tributary of the Murray River within the Murray–Darling basin and the second longest river in Australia. It flows through the Australian state of New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory, descending over , generally in a west-northwesterly direction from the foot of Peppercorn Hill in the Fiery Range of the Snowy Mountains towards its confluence with the Murray River near Boundary Bend.

The word &quot;Murrumbidgee&quot; or &quot;Marrambidya&quot; means &quot;big water&quot; in the Wiradjuri language, one of the local Australian Aboriginal languages. The river itself flows through several traditional Aboriginal Australian lands, home to various Aboriginal peoples. In the Australian Capital Territory, the river is bordered by a narrow strip of land on each side; these are managed as the Murrumbidgee River Corridor (MRC). This land includes many nature reserves, eight recreation reserves, a European heritage conservation zone and rural leases.

== Flow ==
The mainstream of the river system flows for . The river&#x27;s headwaters arise from the wet heath and bog at the foot of Peppercorn Hill situated along Long Plain which is within the Fiery Range of the Snowy Mountains; and about north of Kiandra. From its headwaters it flows to its confluence with the Murray River. The river flows for through the Australian Capital Territory near Canberra, picking up the important tributaries of the Gudgenby, Queanbeyan, Molonglo and Cotter Rivers. The Murrumbidgee drains much of southern New South Wales and all of the Australian Capital Territory, and is an important source of irrigation water for the Riverina farming area.

The reaches of the Murrumbidgee in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) are affected by the complete elimination of large spring snowmelt flows and a reduction of average annual flows of almost 50%, due to Tantangara Dam. Tantangara Dam was completed in 1960 on the headwaters of Murrumbidgee River and diverted approximately 99% of the river&#x27;s flow at that point into Lake Eucumbene. This has extremely serious effects on native fish populations and other native aquatic life and has led to serious siltation, stream contraction, fish habitat loss, and other problems. The Murrumbidgee where it enters the ACT is effectively half the river it used to be. The reduced and significantly modified flow of the river is further exacerbated by dams on its tributaries, such as Scrivener Dam, Cotter Dam, and Googong Dam.

A study suggests a section of the upper river&#x27;s channels are relatively new in geological terms, dating from the early Miocene (the Miocene era being from 23 to 5 million years ago). It is suggested that the Upper Murrumbidgee is an anabranch of the Tumut River (that once continued north along Mutta Mutta Creek) when geological uplift near Adaminaby diverted its flow. From Gundagai onwards the rivers flow within its ancestral channel.

In June 2008 the Murray-Darling Basin Commission released a report on the condition of the Murray–Darling basin, with the Goulburn and Murrumbidgee Rivers rated in a very poor condition in the Murray-Darling basin with fish stocks in both rivers were also rated as extremely poor, with only 13 of the original 22 native fish species still found in the Murrumbidgee River.

== History ==
The Murrumbidgee River runs through the traditional lands of the Ngarigo, Ngunnawal, Wiradjuri, Nari Nari and Muthi Muthi Aboriginal peoples.

== Exploration ==

The Murrumbidgee River was known to Europeans before they first recorded it.  In 1820 the explorer Charles Throsby informed the Governor of New South Wales that he anticipated finding &quot;a considerable river of salt water (except at very wet seasons), called by the natives Mur-rum-big-gee&quot;. In the expedition journal, Throsby wrote as a marginal note: &quot;This river or stream is called by the natives Yeal-am-bid-gie ...&quot;. The river he had stumbled upon was in fact the Molonglo River, Throsby reached the actual river in April 1821.

In 1823, Brigade-Major John Ovens and Captain Mark Currie reached the upper Murrumbidgee when exploring south of Lake George. In 1829, Charles Sturt and his party rowed down the lower half of the Murrumbidgee River in a stoutly built, large row-boat, from Narrandera to the Murray River, and then down the Murray River to the sea. They rowed back upstream, against the current to their starting point. Sturt&#x27;s description of their passage through the junction of the Murrumbidgee and Murray Rivers is dramatic. His description of wild strong currents in the Murrumbidgee—&quot;in the middle of summer&quot; (14 January 1830), when flows are declining and close to the seasonal summer/autumn minimum, is in contrast to the reduced flow seen at the junction today in mid-summer:

The men looked anxiously out ahead; for the singular change in the river had impressed on them an idea, that we were approaching its termination ... We were carried at a fearful rate down its gloomy and contracted banks ... At 3 p.m., Hopkinson called out that we were approaching a junction, and in less than a minute afterwards, we were hurried into a broad and noble river ... such was the force with which we had been shot out of the Morumbidgee, that we were carried nearly to the bank opposite its embouchure, whilst we continued to gaze in silent astonishment on the capacious channel [of the Murray River] we had entered ...

The Murrumbidgee basin was opened to settlement in the 1830s and soon became an important farming area.

Ernest Favenc, when writing on Australian exploration, commented on the relatively tardy European discovery of the river and that the river retained a name used by Indigenous Australians:

Here we may remark on the tenacity with which the Murrumbidgee River long eluded the eye of the white man. It is scarcely probable that Meehan and Hume, who on this occasion were within comparatively easy reach of the head waters, could have seen a new inland river at that time without mentioning the fact, but there is no record traceable anywhere as to the date of its discovery, or the name of its finder. When in 1823 Captain Currie and Major Ovens were led along its bank on to the beautiful Maneroo country by Joseph Wild, the stream was then familiar to the early settlers and called the Morumbidgee. Even in 1821, when Hume found the Yass Plains, almost on its bank, he makes no special mention of the river. From all this we may deduce the extremely probable fact that the position of the river was shown to some stockrider by a native, who also confided the aboriginal name, and so it gradually worked the knowledge of its identity into general belief. This theory is the more feasible as the river has retained its native name. If a white man of any known position had made the discovery, it would at once have received the name of some person holding official sway.

== Navigation ==
The river was once used as a transport route, with paddle steamers navigating the river as far as Gundagai. The river trade declined with the coming of the railways. Paddle steamers last used the Murrumbidgee in the 1930s. To allow the steamers and towed barges to pass, there were opening bridges at Hay, Balranald, and Carathool

== Floods ==
The river has risen above at Gundagai nine times between 1852 and 2010, an average of just under once every eleven years. Since 1925, flooding has been minor with the exception of floods in 1974 and in December 2010, when the river rose to at Gundagai. In the 1852 disaster, the river rose to just over . The following year the river again rose to just over . The construction of Burrinjuck Dam from 1907 has significantly reduced flooding but, despite the dam, there were major floods in 1925, 1950, 1974 and 2012.

The most notable flood was in 1852 when the town of Gundagai was swept away and 89 people, a third of the town&#x27;s population, were killed. The town was rebuilt on higher ground.

In 1925, four people died and the flooding lasted for eight days.

The reduction in floods has consequences for wildlife, particularly birds and trees. There has been a decline in bird populations and black box flood plain eucalypt forest trees are starting to lose their crowns.

Major flooding occurred during March 2012 along the Murrumbidgee River including Wagga Wagga, where the river peaked at on 6 March 2012. This peak was below the 1974 flood level of .

<text>In Norse mythology, Surtr (Old Norse &quot;black&quot; or more narrowly &quot;swart&quot;, Surtur in modern Icelandic), also sometimes written Surt in English, is a jötunn; he is the greatest of the fire giants and further serves as the guardian of Muspelheim, which is one of the only two realms to exist before the beginning of time, alongside Niflheim. Surtr is attested in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. In both sources, Surtr is foretold as being a major figure during the events of Ragnarök; carrying his bright sword, he will go to battle against the Æsir, he will battle the major god Freyr, and afterward the flames that he brings forth will engulf the Earth.

In a book from the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; additional information is given about Surtr, including that he is stationed guarding the frontier of the fiery realm Múspell, that he will lead &quot;Múspell&#x27;s sons&quot; to Ragnarök, and that he will defeat Freyr. Surtr has been the subject of place names and artistic depictions, and scholars have proposed theories regarding elements of Surtr&#x27;s descriptions and his potential origins.

==Attestations==
===&quot;Poetic Edda&quot;===

Surtr is mentioned twice in the poem &quot;Völuspá&quot;, where a völva divulges information to the god Odin. The völva says that, during Ragnarök, Surtr will come from the south with flames, carrying a very bright sword:

Following this, the völva says that &quot;stone peaks clash&quot;, &quot;troll wives take to the road&quot;, &quot;warriors tread the path from Hel&quot;, and the heavens &quot;break apart&quot;. The next stanza relates that Odin is to be killed by the wolf Fenrir, and that Surtr will go to battle against &quot;Beli&#x27;s bane&quot;, a kenning for the god Freyr, who slew the Beli. No further detail is given about the fight between Surtr and Freyr in the poem. In the stanzas that follow, a number of gods and their opponents are described as doing battle at Ragnarök, and that the world will be consumed in flames, yet afterward a new world rises from the sea, fertile and teeming with life, and the surviving gods will meet again.

In the poem &quot;Vafþrúðnismál&quot;, the wise jötunn Vafþrúðnir poses the question to Odin (disguised as &quot;Gagnráðr&quot;) &quot;what the plain is called where in battle Surt and the sweet gods will meet&quot;. Odin responds that the &quot;ordained field&quot; is Vígríðr, and that it stretches &quot;a hundred leagues&quot; in every direction. Later in the poem, Odin, still disguised and now questioning Vafþrúðnir, asks which of the Æsir will &quot;rule over the possessions of the gods when Surt&#x27;s fire is slaked&quot;. Vafþrúðnir responds that, &quot;when Surt&#x27;s fire is slaked&quot; the god Thor&#x27;s sons Móði and Magni shall possess Thor&#x27;s hammer Mjöllnir.

In the poem &quot;Fáfnismál&quot;, the hero Sigurd asks the mortally wounded dragon Fáfnir the name of the island where Surtr and the Æsir &quot;will mingle sword-liquid together&quot;. Fáfnir says that the island is called Óskópnir, that all of the gods shall go there bearing spears, and that on their way there the bridge Bifröst will break beneath them, causing their horses to &quot;flounder in the great river&quot;. The late Eddic poem &quot;Fjölsvinnsmál&quot;, stanza 24, contains the line &quot;Surtur sinn mautu&quot; or &quot;surtur sinn mantu&quot; according to the best manuscripts. The last two words, which are otherwise without meaning, are sometimes emended to &quot;Sinmöru&quot; and the entire phrase is taken to mean that Surtr has a female companion named Sinmara. Based on the same passage, Lee Hollander tentatively identifies Sinmara as Surt&#x27;s wife, stating that she is &quot;unknown elsewhere.&quot;

===&quot;Prose Edda&quot;===

In chapter 4 of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; book &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, the enthroned figure of Third tells Gangleri (described as King Gylfi in disguise) about the location of Múspell. Third says that the bright and flaming region of Múspell existed prior to Niflheim, and it is impassable to those not native to the region. To defend Múspell, Surtr is stationed at its frontier. Third adds that Surtr has a flaming sword, and that &quot;at the end of the world he will go and wage war and defeat all the gods and burn the whole world with fire&quot;. The stanza from &quot;Völuspá&quot; that foretells Surtr moving from the south is then quoted. In chapter 18, Gangleri asks what will protect the fair hall Gimlé &quot;when Surtr&#x27;s fire burns heaven and earth&quot;.

In chapter 51 of &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, High describes the events of Ragnarök. High says that &quot;amid this turmoil the sky will open and from it will ride the sons of Muspell. Surtr will ride in front, and both before and behind him there will be burning fire. His sword will be very fine. Light will shine from it more brightly than from the sun.&quot; High continues that when the sons of Múspell ride over the bridge Bifröst it will break, and that they will continue to the field of Vígríðr. The wolf Fenrir and the Midgard Serpent will also arrive there. By then, Loki will have arrived with &quot;all of Hel&#x27;s people&quot;, Hrym, and all of the frost jötnar; &quot;but Muspell&#x27;s sons will have their own battle array; it will be very bright&quot;. Further into the chapter, High describes that a fierce battle will erupt between these forces and the Æsir, and that during this, Surtr and Freyr will engage in battle &quot;and there will be a harsh conflict before Freyr falls&quot;. High adds that the cause of Freyr&#x27;s death will be that Freyr is lacking &quot;the good sword&quot; that he once gave his servant Skírnir.

As foretold by High further into chapter 51 &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, once Heimdallr and Loki fight (and mutually kill one another), Surtr &quot;will fling fire over the earth and burn the whole world&quot;. High quotes ten stanzas from &quot;Völuspá&quot; in support, and then proceeds to describe the rebirth and new fertility of the reborn world, and the survivors of Ragnarök, including various gods and the two humans named Líf and Lífthrasir that will have hid from &quot;Surtr&#x27;s fire&quot; in the wood Hoddmímis holt.

In the Epilogue section of the book &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;, a euhemerized monologue states that &quot;what they called Surt&#x27;s fire was when Troy burned&quot;. In chapter 2, a work by the skald Eyvindr skáldaspillir is quoted that mentions &quot;Surt&#x27;s deep vales&quot;, using the name &quot;Surtr&quot; as a common noun for a jötunn, with &quot;deep vales&quot; referring to the depths of the mountains (specifically Hnitbjorg).

==Theories==
Scholar Rudolf Simek theorizes that &quot;the concept of Surtr is undoubtedly old&quot;, citing examples of Surtr being mentioned in works by the 10th century skalds Eyvindr skáldaspillir and Hallfreðr vandræðaskáld, in poems collected in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, and that the name of the volcanic caves Surtshellir in western Iceland was already recorded in the manuscript. Simek notes that jötnar are usually described as living to the east in Old Norse sources, yet Surtr is described as being from the south, and that this &quot;surely has to do with his association with fire and heat&quot;. Simek says that &quot;in Iceland Surtr was obviously thought of as being a mighty giant who ruled the powers of (volcanic) fire of the Underworld&quot;, and Simek theorizes that the notion of Surtr as an enemy of the gods likely did not originate in Iceland. Simek compares Surtr to the jötnar Eldr, Eimnir, Logi, and Brandingi, noting that they all appear to be personifications of fire.
A link has been proposed with Śuri, the Etruscan god of Sun, volcanic fire and underworld, noting that they also share the same etymology. 

The scholar Bertha Phillpotts theorizes that the figure of Surtr was inspired by Icelandic eruptions, and that he was a volcano demon.&lt;ref name=&quot;PHILLPOTTS/DAVIDSON&quot;&gt;Phillpotts (1905:14 ff.) in Davidson (1990:208).&lt;/ref&gt; Scholar Andy Orchard theorizes that the description of Surtr found in &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; &quot;appears to owe something to biblical and patristic notions of the angel with a flaming sword who expelled Adam and Eve from paradise and who stands guard over the Garden of Eden.&quot; Scholar John Lindow states that the name &quot;Surtr&quot; may imply Surtr&#x27;s charred appearance.

Richard Cole draws a comparison between Snorri&#x27;s depiction of the sons of Muspell and the Red Jews motif. Cole writes that &quot;Snorra Edda is closer to the Red Jews motif than it is to Vǫluspá&quot;, pointing out many similarities between Snorri&#x27;s narrative in his Edda and the Red Jews motif in which the Prose Edda differs from Völuspá.

==Worship== 

The 12th-13th century Icelandic &quot;Book of Settlements&quot; (Landnámabók) describes the 150 km journey of a chieftain&#x27;s son, Þorvaldur holbarki (&quot;hollow throat&quot;) Þorðarson, through Iceland&#x27;s interior to sing a poem of praise (a &quot;drápa&quot;) – a ritual act – to the giant that lived inside &quot;hellisins Surts&quot;, Surt&#x27;s cave, which is called Surtshellir in modern Icelandic. Archaeological research inside the cave in 2001, 2012, and 2013 has shown that what was once theorized to be evidence of outlaws&#x27; activity in the cave – bones of sheep and oxen – instead documents evidence of Viking Age ritual activities undertaken inside the cave for 65–100 years prior to Iceland&#x27;s conversion to Christianity around 1000 AD. This suggests a possible cult to appease the fire giant, perhaps the first concrete evidence of worship of the jötnar, or of efforts to strengthen the gods in order to restrain Surtr or other jötnar under his control.

==Place names and modern influence==

In modern Iceland, the notion of Surtr as a giant of fire lives on; Surtsey (&quot;Surtr&#x27;s island&quot;), a volcanic island that appeared in 1963 in Vestmannaeyjar, Iceland, is named after Surtr much like Surtshellir.

The description found in &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; of Surtr guarding the frontier of Múspell is depicted in John Charles Dollman&#x27;s painting &quot;The Giant with the Flaming Sword&quot;.

Surtur, a natural satellite of the planet Saturn, and Surt, a volcano on the planet Jupiter&#x27;s moon Io, are both named after him. In 2019 the IAU named the star HAT-P-29 and its Jupiter-sized planet HAT-P-29b, respectively, Muspelheim and Surt, as a result of the NameExoWorlds 2019 campaign.

Surtr was adapted as a character by Marvel Comics, first appearing in &quot;Journey into Mystery&quot; #97 (October 1963). Surtur was important to the backstory in the animated film &quot;,&quot; before making a full appearance in the 2017 MCU film &quot;&quot;.

<doc id="321478" wikidata="Q461980" url="?curid=321478" title="Madalyn Murray O'Hair">
<text>Madalyn Murray O&#x27;Hair ( Mays; April 13, 1919 – September 29, 1995) was an American activist supporting atheism and separation of church and state. In 1963, she founded American Atheists and served as its president until 1986, after which her son Jon Garth Murray succeeded her. She created the first issues of &quot;American Atheist Magazine&quot; and identified as a militant feminist.

O&#x27;Hair is best known for the &quot;Murray v. Curlett&quot; lawsuit, which challenged the policy of mandatory prayers and Bible reading in Baltimore public schools, in which she named her first son William J. Murray as plaintiff. Consolidated with &quot;Abington School District v. Schempp&quot; (1963), it was heard by the United States Supreme Court, which ruled that officially sanctioned mandatory Bible-reading in American public schools was unconstitutional. The Supreme Court had prohibited officially sponsored prayer in schools in &quot; Engel v. Vitale&quot; (1962) on similar grounds. After she founded the American Atheists and won &quot;Murray v. Curlett&quot;, she achieved attention to the extent that in 1964, &quot;Life&quot; magazine referred to her as &quot;the most hated woman in America&quot;. Through American Atheists, O&#x27;Hair filed numerous other suits on issues of separation of church and state.

In 1995, O&#x27;Hair, her son Garth, and her granddaughter Robin disappeared from Austin, Texas. Initial speculation suggested the trio had absconded with hundreds of thousands of dollars from American Atheists coffers; in fact, the trio had been murdered by their former associates, and the bodies were not found until 2001.

==Early and personal life==
Madalyn Mays was born in the Beechview neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on April 13, 1919, the daughter of Lena Christina (née Scholle) and John Irwin Mays. She had an older brother, John Irwin Jr. (known as &quot;Irv&quot;). Their father was of Scots-Irish ethnicity and their mother was of German ancestry. At the age of four, Madalyn was baptized into her father&#x27;s Presbyterian church; her mother was a Lutheran. The family moved to Ohio, and in 1936, Mays graduated from Rossford High School in Rossford.

In 1941, Mays married John Henry Roths, a steelworker. They separated when they both enlisted for World War II service, he in the United States Marine Corps, and she in the Women&#x27;s Army Corps. In April 1945, while posted to a cryptography position in Italy, she began a relationship with officer William J. Murray Jr., a married Roman Catholic. He refused to divorce his wife. Mays divorced Roths and adopted the name Madalyn Murray. She gave birth to her son with officer Murray after returning to Ohio, and named the boy William J. Murray III (nicknamed &quot;Bill&quot;).

In 1949, Murray completed a bachelor&#x27;s degree from Ashland University. She earned a law degree from the South Texas College of Law, but did not pass the bar exam.

She moved with her son William to Baltimore, Maryland. On November 16, 1954, she gave birth to her second son, Jon Garth Murray, fathered by her boyfriend Michael Fiorillo.

According to her son William, a Baptist minister, Madalyn was a communist who unabashedly supported the Soviet Union. William claimed that when he was still a child, Madalyn began hosting Socialist Labor Party meetings and asked him to attend so he could, as quoted from Madalyn, &quot;learn the &#x27;truth&#x27; about capitalism.&quot; William also claimed that Madalyn, who denied being a communist, actually held secret meetings in their basement with her Communist Party comrades. She twice sought to defect to the Soviet Union, applying first in 1959 through the Soviet Embassy in Washington, D.C., and again at the Soviet Embassy in Paris, travelling there for the express purpose in 1960; on both occasions, the Soviets denied her entry. On their return from Paris, Murray and sons went to live with her mother, father, and brother, Irv, at their house in the Loch Raven, Baltimore neighborhood. Soon after, Madalyn accompanied William to their neighbourhood school, Woodbourne Junior High School, to re-enroll William for freshman classes. Madalyn was unhappy to see students, after the recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance, engaging in prayer. She instructed William to keep a log of all religious exercises and references to religion for the next two weeks, saying, &quot;Well, if they&#x27;ll keep us from going to Russia where there is some freedom, we&#x27;ll just have to change America.&quot; After the two weeks, and after her request that William be allowed to leave class during prayer times was denied by school authorities, she pulled him out of school and proceeded to file a lawsuit against the Baltimore Public School System, naming William as plaintiff. She said that its practices of mandatory prayer and required reading of the Bible were unconstitutional. The US Supreme Court upheld her position by a ruling in 1963.

Because of hostility in Baltimore against her family related to this case, Murray left Maryland with her sons in 1963 and moved to Honolulu, Hawaii. She had allegedly assaulted five Baltimore City Police Department officers who tried to retrieve her son William&#x27;s girlfriend Susan from her house; she was a minor and had run away from home. Susan gave birth to William&#x27;s daughter, whom she named Robin. Murray later adopted Robin.

In 1965, Murray married U.S. Marine Richard O&#x27;Hair, and changed her surname. He had belonged to a Communist group in Detroit during the 1940s. During investigations of the 1950s, he gave more than 100 names of other members to the FBI. Later, he was investigated for falsely claiming to be an FBI agent. Their relationship has been described as &quot;textbook codependents&quot;. Although the couple separated, they were legally married until his death in 1978.

In 1980, she publicly rejected her estranged son William when he announced that he had converted to Christianity. He later became a Baptist minister.

==Activism and politics==

In 1960, Murray filed a lawsuit against the Baltimore City Public School System (&quot;Murray v. Curlett&quot;), naming her son William as plaintiff. She challenged the city school system&#x27;s practice of requiring students to participate in Bible readings at the city&#x27;s public schools. She said her son&#x27;s refusal to participate had resulted in bullying by classmates and that administrators condoned this behavior. After consolidation with &quot;Abington School District v. Schempp,&quot; the lawsuit was heard by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1963. The Court voted 8–1 in Schempp&#x27;s favor, saying that mandatory public Bible readings by students were unconstitutional. Prayer in schools other than Bible-readings had been ruled as unconstitutional the year before by the Court in &quot;Engel v. Vitale&quot; (1962).

O&#x27;Hair filed a number of other lawsuits: one was against the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) because of the Apollo 8 Genesis reading. The case was rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court for lack of jurisdiction. The challenge had limited effect.

O&#x27;Hair endorsed Jimmy Carter in the 1976 presidential election because of Carter&#x27;s opposition to mandatory school prayer, his support for sex education in public schools, and his stance on ecological matters.

In a 1989 interview, O&#x27;Hair said &quot;I told my kids I just want three words on my tombstone, if I have one. I&#x27;ll probably be cremated. One is &quot;woman.&quot; I&#x27;m very comfortable in that role. I&#x27;ve loved being a woman, I&#x27;ve loved being a mother, I&#x27;ve loved being a grandmother. I want three words: Woman, Atheist, Anarchist. That&#x27;s me.&quot;

=== Feminism ===
During an interview with &quot;Playboy&quot; in 1965, O&#x27;Hair described herself as a &quot;militant feminist&quot; and expressed her dissatisfaction with women&#x27;s inequality in America, stating during the interview:

She also expressed her discontent with the women&#x27;s liberation movement.

=== Holocaust denial ===
In the article &quot;The Shoah: hope springs eternal&quot; in the August 1989 issue of the &quot;American Atheist&quot; magazine, O&#x27;Hair downplayed the Holocaust:

In the same article, she claimed that &quot;investigative and scholarly studies undertaken during the last fifty years&quot;, such as a book by Paul Rassinier established that the total number of Jewish victims was between 1 and 1.5 million, adding, &quot;[t]his is a far cry from an alleged 6,000,000&quot;, then elaborating on this point:

She concluded:

==American Atheists==

After settling in Austin, Texas, O&#x27;Hair founded American Atheists in 1963. It identifies as &quot;a nationwide movement which defends the civil rights of non-believers, works for the separation of church and state and addresses issues of First Amendment public policy&quot;. She served as the group&#x27;s first chief executive officer and president until 1986. She was the public voice and face of atheism in the United States during the 1960s and 1970s. Although her son Garth Murray succeeded her officially as president, she retained most of the power and decision making.

In a 1965 interview with &quot;Playboy&quot;, she described religion as &quot;a crutch&quot; and an &quot;irrational reliance on superstitions and supernatural nonsense&quot;. In the same &quot;Playboy&quot; interview, O&#x27;Hair described numerous alleged incidents of harassment, intimidation, and death threats against her and her family. She read several letters she claimed to have received, including one that read (referring to the conversion of Paul the Apostle on the road to Damascus), &quot;May Jesus, who you so vigorously deny, change you into a Paul.&quot; O&#x27;Hair told the interviewer, &quot;Isn&#x27;t that lovely? Christine Jorgensen had to go to Sweden for an operation, but &quot;me&quot; they&#x27;ll fix with faith — painlessly and for nothing.&quot; She said that she left Baltimore because of persecution from residents. She had received mail containing photos smeared with feces, her son Garth&#x27;s pet kitten was killed, and her home was stoned. She said she thought such events were a catalyst for her father&#x27;s fatal heart attack.

She filed several lawsuits challenging governmental practices, based on upholding and defining the constitutional separation of church and state. Among these was one against the city of Baltimore&#x27;s policy of classifying the Catholic Church as a tax-exempt organization in terms of property.

O&#x27;Hair founded an atheist radio program, in which she criticized religion and theism. She hosted a television show, &quot;American Atheist Forum&quot;, which was carried on more than 140 cable television systems.

Arrested for disorderly conduct in Austin in 1977, O&#x27;Hair continued to be a polarizing figure into the 1980s. She served as &quot;chief speechwriter&quot; for Larry Flynt&#x27;s 1984 presidential campaign. She was regularly invited to appear on TV talk shows as a guest. Her second son Garth Murray officially succeeded her as president of the American Atheists, but she was said to retain most of the power. Some chapters seceded from the main group at the time. But , American Atheists continued as an active organization with a growing membership.

Her son William J. Murray became a Christian in 1980 and later a Baptist minister, publishing a memoir of his spiritual journey in 1982. Murray O&#x27;Hair commented, &quot;One could call this a postnatal abortion on the part of a mother, I guess; I repudiate him entirely and completely for now and all times ... he is beyond human forgiveness.&quot;

In 1988, O&#x27;Hair produced several issues of &quot;Truth Seeker&quot; under her masthead as part of an attempt to take over the publication, but the courts ruled against her ownership.

In the 1990s, American Atheists staff consisted of O&#x27;Hair, her son Jon Garth Murray, Robin Murray O&#x27;Hair, and a handful of support personnel. William J. Murray was estranged from his mother, brother, and daughter. They had not met nor spoken for many years. The trio lived in O&#x27;Hair&#x27;s large home, worked in the same office, and took shared vacations.

==Court cases==
O&#x27;Hair filed numerous lawsuits in which she argued the separation of church and state had been breached.
*&quot;Murray v. Curlett&quot; (1963) Challenged Bible reading and prayer recitation in Maryland public schools.
*&quot;Murray v. United States&quot; (1964) To force the Federal Communications Commission to extend the Fairness Doctrine so that atheists could have equal time with religion on radio and television.

==Kidnapping and murder==
On August 27, 1995, O&#x27;Hair, her son Jon Garth Murray, and her granddaughter Robin Murray O&#x27;Hair disappeared from their home and office. A typewritten note was attached to the locked office door, saying &quot;The Murray O&#x27;Hair family has been called out of town on an emergency basis. We do not know how long we will be gone at the time of the writing of this memo.&quot; When police entered O&#x27;Hair&#x27;s home, it looked as if they had left suddenly. The trio said in phone calls that they were on &quot;business&quot; in San Antonio, Texas. Garth Murray ordered US$600,000 worth of gold coins from a San Antonio jeweler, but took delivery of only $500,000 worth of coins.

Until September 27, American Atheists employees received several mobile calls from Robin and Jon, but neither explained why they had left or when they would return; employees reported that their voices sounded strained and disturbed. After September 28, no further communication came from any of the three. American Atheists was facing serious financial problems because of the withdrawal of funds, and membership dwindled in the face of an apparent scandal. There was speculation that the trio had disappeared in order to conceal its assets or avoid being contacted by creditors.

===Investigation and arrests===
During the case, &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; reporter Robert Bryce criticized the relative lack of action by the Austin Police Department, even when they were contacted by O&#x27;Hair&#x27;s estranged son William J. Murray. He noted that the investigation was being led by agents of the Internal Revenue Service (with whom American Atheists had a long-running dispute over taxes owed), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (due to the possibility of the O&#x27;Hairs having absconded with organizational funds), and the Dallas County Sheriff&#x27;s Office (where Danny Fry&#x27;s headless, limbless corpse was found in October 1995, but had been unidentifiable until February 1999). Bryce, William Murray, &quot;ABC Nightline&quot; reporter Valeri Williams and &quot;San Antonio Express-News&quot; reporter John MacCormack, amongst others, felt that little official effort went into the investigation because the authorities preferred to believe that the theft and disappearance was simply an internal American Atheists matter.

In 1999, nearly four years after the August 1995 disappearances, continued prodding and investigative leads from the various reporters finally led the official investigation to focus on David Roland Waters, a felon with a violent history who had started working for American Atheists in 1993. In May 1995, Waters had pleaded guilty to stealing $54,000 from the organization in 1994. When Waters received a lenient sentence, O&#x27;Hair published an article in the American Atheists newsletter in which she exposed the theft of the moneyalong with his previous crimes. O&#x27;Hair claimed that, at the age of 17, Waters had killed another teenager and had been sentenced to eight years in prison. When the authorities finally pursued the Waters connection in 1999, Waters&#x27; former girlfriend, Patty Steffens, confirmed that Waters had vowed violent revenge after reading O&#x27;Hair&#x27;s article.

Federal agents for the FBI and the IRS, along with the police, concluded that Waters and his accomplices (Gary Paul Karr and Danny Fry)) had kidnapped all three Murray/O&#x27;Hair family members, forced them to withdraw the missing funds, gone on several shopping sprees with their money and credit cards, and killed and dismembered all three. A few days after O&#x27;Hair and her son and granddaughter were killed, Waters and Karr killed Fry. His body was found on a riverbed in rural Dallas County in October 1995, but his head and hands were missing; as a result, his remains were not identified for three and a half years, when reporter MacCormack&#x27;s own investigation led him to suggest that the body might be Fry&#x27;s.

A search warrant was executed on the apartment of Waters and his girlfriend. The search revealed ammunition of various calibers; Waters, a convicted felon, was not allowed this material and he was arrested, while the contents of his apartment were seized. At the same time, Gary Karr was contacted in Walled Lake, Michigan, and interviewed. Having served the last 30 years in prison for kidnapping a judge&#x27;s daughter, Karr would not talk. He had his rights read to him and he asked for permission to listen to the information which was being discussed. Karr then decided to talk and implicated Waters in the deaths of Murray and the other two O&#x27;Hairs. Karr signed an affidavit and drew a map so that the police could find the bodies. Karr was arrested and taken to jail for possession of two firearms. He was held in Detroit, awaiting trial. The weapon charge was dismissed, and Karr was transferred to the custody of the United States Marshals in Austin because he needed to be tried for the deaths of the O&#x27;Hairs.

In June 2000, nearly a full five years after the murders, a three-week trial found Karr guilty of conspiracy to commit extortion, traveling interstate in order to commit violent acts, money laundering, and interstate transportation of stolen property: all charges related to the O&#x27;Hair case. He was acquitted of conspiring to kidnap the O&#x27;Hairs, because the authorities had failed to locate any bodies. In August 2000, Karr was sentenced to two life terms in prison by U.S. District Judge Sam Sparks.

Waters was arrested and prosecuted; in a January 2001 plea agreement solely on the charge of conspiracy, he agreed to lead authorities to the site where the dismembered bodies of the O&#x27;Hairs had been burned and buried. He was sentenced to serve 20 years in federal prison, which he had requested, because he did not want to serve time for his earlier theft conviction in Texas state prison. He did not go on trial for the kidnapping and murder of the three members of the O&#x27;Hair family. He was also ordered to pay back a total of $543,665 to American Atheists and the estates of Madalyn Murray O&#x27;Hair, Jon Garth Murray, and Robin Murray O&#x27;Hair. It is unlikely that any part of these debts were ever paid, because Waters was not able to earn any money while he was in prison. Waters died of lung cancer on January 27, 2003, at the Federal Medical Center in Butner, North Carolina.

When Waters, under the plea agreement, led federal agents to the O&#x27;Hair&#x27;s burial site on a Texas ranch, they discovered that the legs of all three of the victims had been cut off with a saw. The remains had suffered such extensive mutilation and decomposition that officials had to identify them through dental records, DNA testing and, in Madalyn O&#x27;Hair&#x27;s case, by matching the serial number on a prosthetic hip to records from Brackenridge Hospital in Austin. The head and hands of Danny Fry were also found at the site. Eventually, Bill Murray (as the closest surviving relative) was granted custody of the remains and buried them at an undisclosed location and (in accordance with his Baptist beliefs) did not pray for the dead; however, some of those who were with him did pray for remaining family members and law enforcement officials who had worked on the case.

In 1995, Waters and his girlfriend had put the gold coins, which he and his accomplices had extorted from the O&#x27;Hairs, in an unsecured storage locker which had been rented by the girlfriend. It only had a cheap padlock. Waters had taken some of the coins and for a few days, he partied with Gary Karr and his former wife. When he returned to the locker, he discovered that the remaining gold coins (American Gold Eagles, Maple Leaf coins, and Krugerrands) had all been stolen. A group of thieves from San Antonio who were operating in that area had gained keys to the type of lock which had been used by Waters&#x27; girlfriend. In the course of their activities, the thieves had come across the locker, used a key to open it, and found the suitcase full of gold coins. They returned to San Antonio, and with the help of friends, they exchanged the gold coins for cash. The thieves and friends went to Las Vegas for a weekend. All but one coin, which had been given as a pendant gift to an aunt, were spent by these thieves. That last coin was recovered by the FBI after a Memorial Day 1999 public appeal.

== Legacy ==
Murray&#x27;s 1960 lawsuit against the Baltimore City School System was later consolidated with a similar one from Pennsylvania, when these reached the US Supreme Court on appeal. The Court ruled in 1963 (in &quot;Abington School District v. Schempp)&quot; that school-sponsored Bible reading in public schools in the United States was unconstitutional. This decision gradually resulted in the end of religious activities sponsored by public schools. Non-religious students had been expected to participate in such activities, and state-level policies varied.

O&#x27;Hair&#x27;s antisemitism and embrace of conspiracy theories led later atheists to distance themselves from her. Prominent atheist author Christopher Hitchens called O&#x27;Hair a &quot;madwoman&quot;.

In 2012, a memorial brick for Murray, her son Jon, and her granddaughter Robin was placed at Lou Neff Point in Zilker Park in Austin, Texas.
In 2013, the first atheist monument to be erected on American government property was unveiled at the Bradford County Courthouse in Florida, where other residents had installed a monument to religious ideals (in this case, a replica of the Ten Commandments). It is a 1,500-pound granite bench and plinth inscribed with quotes by O&#x27;Hair, Thomas Jefferson, and Benjamin Franklin. The American Atheists said at the time that they planned to build 50 more monuments.

O&#x27;Hair was incorporated into a popular urban legend stemming from an erroneous characterization of RM-2493, a proposal made to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in 1974. The purpose of the proposal was to prevent organizations from making religious broadcasts on stations licensed for educational use. False rumors spread that O&#x27;Hair was a proponent of RM-2493, and that its intent was to ban the broadcast of religious services, and the reading of the Bible over the airwaves. The FCC&#x27;s denial of RM-2493 in 1975, and O&#x27;Hair&#x27;s later disappearance and murder, did little to stem the spread of the legend, which still claimed years later that O&#x27;Hair was pushing an active FCC proposal. Subsequent iterations of the rumor included allegations that O&#x27;Hair was campaigning to remove Christmas programs and songs from public schools and &quot;office buildings&quot;. Other variations mentioned specific religious leaders who were supposedly being targeted for removal from the airwaves, or stated that the television series &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot; was threatened with cancellation because of the proposal. Evangelical Christian leader James Dobson became falsely associated with the legend as well, purportedly leading opposition to the FCC petition. As of 2015, the FCC was still receiving dozens of correspondences relating to O&#x27;Hair every month.

==Popular culture==
The December 2002 episode &quot;Without a Prayer&quot;, of the series &quot;Forensic Files&quot;, deals with the disappearance and deaths of O&#x27;Hair, her son and her granddaughter.

The October 2004 episode &quot;Eosphoros&quot;, of the series &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot;, is loosely based on O&#x27;Hair&#x27;s murder.

A 2017 Netflix movie, &quot;The Most Hated Woman in America&quot;, is a loose dramatization of O&#x27;Hair&#x27;s life. It focuses on the abductions and killings of O&#x27;Hair and two family members in 1995.

<text>In logic, temporal logic is any system of rules and symbolism for representing, and reasoning about, propositions qualified in terms of time (for example, &quot;I am &quot;always&quot; hungry&quot;, &quot;I will &quot;eventually&quot; be hungry&quot;, or &quot;I will be hungry &quot;until&quot; I eat something&quot;). It is sometimes also used to refer to tense logic, a modal logic-based system of temporal logic introduced by Arthur Prior in the late 1950s, with important contributions by Hans Kamp. It has been further developed by computer scientists, notably Amir Pnueli, and logicians.

Temporal logic has found an important application in formal verification, where it is used to state requirements of hardware or software systems. For instance, one may wish to say that &quot;whenever&quot; a request is made, access to a resource is &quot;eventually&quot; granted, but it is &quot;never&quot; granted to two requestors simultaneously. Such a statement can conveniently be expressed in a temporal logic.

==Motivation==
Consider the statement &quot;I am hungry&quot;. Though its meaning is constant in time, the statement&#x27;s truth value can vary in time. Sometimes it is true, and sometimes false, but never simultaneously true &quot;and&quot; false. In a temporal logic, a statement can have a truth value that varies in time—in contrast with an atemporal logic, which applies only to statements whose truth values are constant in time. This treatment of truth-value over time differentiates temporal logic from computational verb logic.

Temporal logic always has the ability to reason about a timeline. So-called &quot;linear-time&quot; logics are restricted to this type of reasoning. Branching-time logics, however, can reason about multiple timelines. This permits in particular treatment of environments that may act unpredictably.
To continue the example, in a branching-time logic we may state that &quot;there is a possibility that I will stay hungry forever&quot;, and that &quot;there is a possibility that eventually I am no longer hungry&quot;. If we do not know whether or not I will ever be fed, these statements can both be true.

==History==
Although Aristotle&#x27;s logic is almost entirely concerned with the theory of the categorical syllogism, there are passages in his work that are now seen as anticipations of temporal logic, and may imply an early, partially developed form of first-order temporal modal bivalent logic. Aristotle was particularly concerned with the problem of future contingents, where he could not accept that the principle of bivalence applies to statements about future events, i.e. that we can presently decide if a statement about a future event is true or false, such as &quot;there will be a sea battle tomorrow&quot;.

There was little development for millennia, Charles Sanders Peirce noted in the 19th century:
Surprisingly for Peirce, the first system of temporal logic was constructed, as far as we know, in the first half of 20th century. Although Arthur Prior is widely known as a founder of temporal logic, the first formalization of such logic was provided in 1947 by Polish logician, Jerzy Łoś. In his work &quot;Podstawy Analizy Metodologicznej Kanonów Milla&quot; (&quot;The Foundations of a Methodological Analysis of Mill’s Methods&quot;) he presented a formalization of Mill&#x27;s canons. In Łoś&#x27; approach, emphasis was placed on the time factor. Thus, to reach his goal, he had to create a logic that could provide means for formalization of temporal functions. The logic could be seen as a byproduct of Łoś&#x27; main aim, albeit it was the first positional logic that, as a framework, was used later for Łoś&#x27; inventions in epistemic logic. The logic itself has syntax very different than Prior&#x27;s tense logic, which uses modal operators. The language of Łoś&#x27; logic rather uses a realization operator, specific to positional logic, which binds the expression with the specific context in which its truth-value is considered. In Łoś&#x27; work this considered context was only temporal, thus expressions were bound with specific moments or intervals of time.

In the following years, research of temporal logic by Arthur Prior began. He was concerned with the philosophical implications of free will and predestination. According to his wife, he first considered formalizing temporal logic in 1953. Results of his research were first presented at the conference in Wellington in 1954. The system Prior presented, was similar syntactically to Łoś&#x27; logic, although not until 1955 did he explicitly refer to Łoś&#x27; work, in the last section of Appendix 1 in Prior’s &quot;Formal Logic&quot;.

Prior gave lectures on the topic at the University of Oxford in 1955–6, and in 1957 published a book, &quot;Time and Modality&quot;, in which he introduced a propositional modal logic with two temporal connectives (modal operators), F and P, corresponding to &quot;sometime in the future&quot; and &quot;sometime in the past&quot;. In this early work, Prior considered time to be linear. In 1958 however, he received a letter from Saul Kripke, who pointed out that this assumption is perhaps unwarranted. In a development that foreshadowed a similar one in computer science, Prior took this under advisement, and developed two theories of branching time, which he called &quot;Ockhamist&quot; and &quot;Peircean&quot;. Between 1958 and 1965 Prior also corresponded with Charles Leonard Hamblin, and a number of early developments in the field can be traced to this correspondence, for example Hamblin implications. Prior published his most mature work on the topic, the book &quot;Past, Present, and Future&quot; in 1967. He died two years later.

Along with tense logic, Prior constructed a few systems of positional logic, which inherited their main ideas from Łoś. Work in positional temporal logics was continued by Nicholas Rescher in the 60s and 70s. In such works as &quot;Note on Chronological Logic&quot; (1966), &quot;On the Logic of Chronological Propositions&quot; (1968)&quot;, Topological Logic&quot; (1968), and &quot;Temporal Logic&quot; (1971) he researched connections between Łoś&#x27; and Prior&#x27;s systems. Moreover, he proved that Prior&#x27;s tense operators could be defined using a realization operator in specific positional logics. Rescher, in his work, also created more general systems of positional logics. Although the first ones were constructed for purely temporal uses, he proposed the term topological logics for logics that were meant to contain a realization operator but had no specific temporal axioms—like the clock axiom.

The binary temporal operators &quot;Since&quot; and &quot;Until&quot; were introduced by Hans Kamp in his 1968 Ph.D. thesis, which also contains an important result relating temporal logic to first-order logic—a result now known as Kamp&#x27;s theorem.

Two early contenders in formal verifications were linear temporal logic, a linear-time logic by Amir Pnueli, and computation tree logic (CTL), a branching-time logic by Mordechai Ben-Ari, Zohar Manna and Amir Pnueli. An almost equivalent formalism to CTL was suggested around the same time by E. M. Clarke and E. A. Emerson. The fact that the second logic can be decided more efficiently than the first does not reflect on branching- and linear-time logics in general, as has sometimes been argued. Rather, Emerson and Lei show that any linear-time logic can be extended to a branching-time logic that can be decided with the same complexity.

== Łoś&#x27;s positional logic ==
Łoś’s logic was published as his 1947 master’s thesis &quot;Podstawy Analizy Metodologicznej Kanonów Milla&quot; (&quot;The Foundations of a Methodological Analysis of Mill’s Methods&quot;). His philosophical and formal concepts could be seen as continuations of those of the Lviv–Warsaw School of Logic, as his supervisor was Jerzy Słupecki, disciple of Jan Łukasiewicz. The paper was not translated into English until 1977, although Henryk Hiż presented in 1951 a brief, but informative, review in the &quot;Journal of Symbolic Logic&quot;. This review contained core concepts of Łoś’s work and was enough to popularize his results among the logical community. The main aim of this work was to present Mill&#x27;s canons in the framework of formal logic. To achieve this goal the author researched the importance of temporal functions in the structure of Mill&#x27;s concept. Having that, he provided his axiomatic system of logic that would fit as a framework for Mill&#x27;s canons along with their temporal aspects.

=== Syntax ===
The language of the logic first published in &quot;Podstawy Analizy Metodologicznej Kanonów Milla&quot; (&quot;The Foundations of a Methodological Analysis of Mill’s Methods&quot;) consisted of:

* first-order logic operators ‘¬’, ‘∧’, ‘∨’, ‘→’, ‘≡’, ‘∀’ and ‘∃’
* realization operator U
* functional symbol δ
* propositional variables p1,p2,p3...
* variables denoting time moments t1,t2,t3...
* variables denoting time intervals n1,n2,n3...

The set of terms (denoted by S) is constructed as follows:

* variables denoting time moments or intervals are terms
* if formula_1 and formula_2 is a time interval variable, then formula_3

The set of formulas (denoted by For) is constructed as follows:

* all first-order logic formulas are valid
* if formula_1 and formula_5 is a propositional variable, then formula_6
* if formula_7, then formula_8
* if formula_9 and formula_10, then formula_11
* if formula_7 and formula_13 and υ is a propositional, moment or interval variable, then formula_14

=== Original Axiomatic System ===

# formula_15
# formula_16
# formula_17
# formula_18
# formula_19
# formula_20
# formula_21
# formula_22
# formula_23

== Prior&#x27;s tense logic (TL) ==
The sentential tense logic introduced in &quot;Time and Modality&quot; has four (non-truth-functional) modal operators (in addition to all usual truth-functional operators in first-order propositional logic).
* &quot;P&quot;: &quot;It was the case that...&quot; (P stands for &quot;past&quot;)
* &quot;F&quot;: &quot;It will be the case that...&quot; (F stands for &quot;future&quot;)
* &quot;G&quot;: &quot;It always will be the case that...&quot;
* &quot;H&quot;: &quot;It always was the case that...&quot;

These can be combined if we let &quot;π&quot; be an infinite path:

* formula_24: &quot;At a certain point, formula_5 is true at all future states of the path&quot;
* formula_26: &quot;formula_5 is true at infinitely many states on the path&quot;

From &quot;P&quot; and &quot;F&quot; one can define &quot;G&quot; and &quot;H&quot;, and vice versa:

:formula_28

=== Syntax and semantics ===

A minimal syntax for TL is specified with the following BNF grammar:

:formula_29

where &quot;a&quot; is some atomic formula.

Kripke models are used to evaluate the truth of sentences in TL. A pair (, &lt;) of a set and a binary relation &lt; on (called &quot;precedence&quot;) is called a frame. A model is given by triple (, &lt;, ) of a frame and a function called a valuation that assigns to each pair (, ) of an atomic formula and a time value some truth value. The notion &quot; is true in a model =(, &lt;, ) at time &quot; is abbreviated ⊨[]. With this notation,

Given a class of frames, a sentence of TL is
* valid with respect to if for every model =(,&lt;,) with (,&lt;) in and for every in , ⊨[]
* satisfiable with respect to if there is a model =(,&lt;,) with (,&lt;) in such that for some in , ⊨[]
* a consequence of a sentence with respect to if for every model =(,&lt;,) with (,&lt;) in and for every in , if ⊨[], then ⊨[]

Many sentences are only valid for a limited class of frames. It is common to restrict the class of frames to those with a relation &lt; that is transitive, antisymmetric, reflexive, trichotomic, irreflexive, total, dense, or some combination of these.

=== A minimal axiomatic logic ===

Burgess outlines a logic that makes no assumptions on the relation &lt;, but allows for meaningful deductions, based on the following axiom schema:
# where is a tautology of first-order logic
# G(→)→(G→G)
# H(→)→(H→H)
# →GP
# →HF
with the following rules of deduction:
# given → and , deduce (modus ponens)
# given &quot;a tautology&quot; , infer G
# given &quot;a tautology&quot; , infer H

One can derive the following rules:
# Becker&#x27;s rule: given →, deduce T→T where T is a tense, any sequence made of G, H, F, and P.
# Mirroring: given a theorem , deduce its mirror statement §, which is obtained by replacing G by H (and so F by P) and vice versa.
# Duality: given a theorem , deduce its dual statement *, which is obtained by interchanging ∧ with ∨, G with F, and H with P.

=== Translation to predicate logic ===
Burgess gives a &quot;Meredith translation&quot; from statements in TL into statements in first-order logic with one free variable 0 (representing the present moment). This translation is defined recursively as follows:

:formula_30

where formula_31 is the sentence with all variable indices incremented by 1 and formula_32 is a one-place predicate defined by formula_33.

==Temporal operators==
Temporal logic has two kinds of operators: logical operators and modal operators. Logical operators are usual truth-functional operators (formula_34). The modal operators used in linear temporal logic and computation tree logic are defined as follows.

Alternate symbols:

* operator R is sometimes denoted by V
* The operator W is the &quot;weak until&quot; operator: formula_35 is equivalent to formula_36

Unary operators are well-formed formulas whenever is well-formed. Binary operators are well-formed formulas whenever and are well-formed.

In some logics, some operators cannot be expressed. For example, N operator cannot be expressed in temporal logic of actions.

==Temporal logics==
Temporal logics include:

* Some systems of positional logic
* Linear temporal logic (LTL) temporal logic without branching timelines
* Computation tree logic (CTL) temporal logic with branching timelines
* Interval temporal logic (ITL)
* Temporal logic of actions (TLA)
* Signal temporal logic (STL)
* Timestamp temporal logic (TTL)
* Property specification language (PSL)
* CTL*, which generalizes LTL and CTL
* Hennessy–Milner logic (HML)
* Modal μ-calculus, which includes as a subset HML and CTL*
* Metric temporal logic (MTL)
* Metric interval temporal logic (MITL)
* Timed propositional temporal logic (TPTL)
* Truncated Linear Temporal Logic (TLTL)
* Hyper temporal logic (HyperLTL) 
A variation, closely related to temporal or chronological or tense logics, are modal logics based upon &quot;topology&quot;, &quot;place&quot;, or &quot;spatial position&quot;.

<text>A call girl or female escort is a prostitute who (unlike a street walker) does not display her profession to the general public, nor does she usually work in an institution like a brothel, although she may be employed by an escort agency. The client must make an appointment, usually by calling a telephone number.
Call girls often advertise their services in small ads in magazines and via the Internet, although an intermediary advertiser, such as an escort agency, may be involved in promoting escorts, while, less often, some may be handled by a pimp.
Call girls may work either incall, where the client comes to them, or outcall, where they go to the client. Some porn stars are known to escort as well.

==Internet==
Many call girl agencies and independent call girls have their own websites. The internet has become the main medium through which customers find their desired escort. Generally, a picture of the woman is provided, and sometimes, the type of sexual services she offers.

==Notable call girls==
* Ashley Alexandra Dupré, American call girl and entertainer involved in the Eliot Spitzer prostitution scandal
* Brooke Magnanti, British writer and call girl whose blogs and books were adapted into the television programme &quot;Secret Diary of a Call Girl&quot;
* Jillian Lauren, American writer and former call girl for Jefri Bolkiah, Prince of Brunei about whom she wrote the memoir &quot;Some Girls: My Life in a Harem&quot;
* Suzy Favor Hamilton, former Olympic athlete who was revealed in 2012 to have been moonlighting as a high-end call girl
* Xaviera Hollander, Dutch former call girl, madam and author

<text>Charles Napier Sturt (28 April 1795 – 16 June 1869) was a British officer and explorer of Australia, and part of the European exploration of Australia. He led several expeditions into the interior of the continent, starting from Sydney and later from Adelaide. His expeditions traced several of the westward-flowing rivers, establishing that they all merged into the Murray River, which flows into the Southern Ocean. He was searching to prove his own passionately held belief that an &quot;inland sea&quot; was located at the centre of the continent. He reached the rank of Captain, served in several appointed posts, and on the Legislative Council.

Born to British parents in the Bengal Presidency, Sturt was educated in England for a time as a child and youth. He was placed in the British Army because his father was not wealthy enough to pay for Cambridge. After assignments in North America, Sturt was assigned to accompany a ship of convicts to Australia in 1827. Finding the place to his liking, he made his life there.

==Early life==
Charles Sturt was born in the Bengal Presidency, the eldest son (of thirteen children) of Thomas Lenox Napier Sturt, a judge under the British East India Company, and his wife. At the age of five, Charles was sent to live with relatives in England to be educated, as was customary for the children of the colonial upper class. After attending a preparatory school, he was sent to Harrow in 1810.

In 1812, Charles went to read with a Mr. Preston near Cambridge, but his father was not wealthy, and had difficulty finding the money to send him to Cambridge University, or to establish him in a profession. An aunt appealed to the Prince Regent and, on 9 September 1813, Sturt was gazetted as an ensign with the 39th (Dorsetshire) Regiment of Foot in the British Army.

Sturt saw action with the Duke of Wellington in the Peninsular War and against the Americans in Canada during the War of 1812. He returned to Europe a few days after the Battle of Waterloo. Sturt was gazetted lieutenant on 7 April 1823 and promoted captain on 15 December 1825. With a detachment from his regiment, Sturt escorted convicts aboard the &quot;Mariner&quot; to New South Wales, arriving in Sydney on 23 May 1827.

Sturt was a cousin of the wife of Henry Dumaresq, brother-in-law of Governor Ralph Darling, which was later to complicate his relationship with Sir Thomas Mitchell, who resented those whom he judged were treated favourably by Darling.

==Australia and Sturt&#x27;s first two expeditions==

Sturt found the conditions and climate in New South Wales much better than he expected, and he developed a great interest in the country. The Governor of New South Wales, Sir Ralph Darling, formed a high opinion of Sturt and appointed him major of brigade and military secretary. Sturt became friendly with John Oxley, Allan Cunningham, Hamilton Hume, and other explorers. Sturt was keen to explore the Australian interior, especially its rivers.

Sturt received approval from Governor Darling on 4 November 1828 to explore the area of the Macquarie River in western New South Wales. It was not, however, until 10 November that the party started out. It consisted of Sturt, his servant Joseph Harris, three soldiers and eight convicts; on 27 November Sturt was joined by Hamilton Hume as his first assistant. Hume&#x27;s experience proved to be very useful. A week was spent at Wellington Valley breaking in oxen and horses, and on 7 December the real start into comparatively little known country was made. 1828–29 was a period of drought and the party had difficulty in finding sufficient water. They had followed the courses of the Macquarie, Bogan and Castlereagh rivers and, though its importance was scarcely sufficiently realised, had visited the Darling River. The party returned to Wellington Valley on 21 April 1829. The expedition proved that northern New South Wales was not an inland sea, but deepened the mystery of where the western-flowing rivers of New South Wales went.
In 1829 Governor Darling approved an expedition to solve this mystery. Sturt proposed to travel down the Murrumbidgee River, whose upper reaches had been seen by the Hume and Hovell expedition. In place of Hume, who was unable to join the party, George Macleay went &quot;as a companion rather than as an assistant&quot;. A whaleboat built in sections was carried with them; it was assembled, and on 7 January 1830 they began their eventful voyage down the Murrumbidgee. In January 1830 Sturt&#x27;s party reached the confluence of the Murrumbidgee and a much larger river, which Sturt named the Murray River. It was in fact the same river which Hume and Hovell had crossed further upstream and named the Hume. Several times the party was in danger from Aborigines but Sturt always succeeded in propitiating them.

Sturt proceeded down the Murray, until he reached the river&#x27;s confluence with the Darling. Sturt had now proved that all the western-flowing rivers eventually flow into the Murray. In February 1830, the party reached a large lake, which Sturt called Lake Alexandrina. A few days later, they reached the sea, later named as the Southern Ocean. There they made the disappointing discovery that the mouth of the Murray was a maze of lagoons and sandbars, impassable to shipping.

The party faced the ordeal of rowing back upriver on the Murray and Murrumbidgee, against the current, in the heat of an Australian summer. Their supplies ran out and, when they reached the site of Narrandera in April, they were unable to go any further. Sturt sent two men overland in search of supplies and they returned in time to save the party from starvation. But Sturt went blind for some months and never fully recovered his health. By the time they reached Sydney again, they had rowed and sailed nearly 2,900 kilometres of the river system.

==A break from exploring==

Sturt briefly served as Commander on Norfolk Island, where mutiny was brewing among the convicts. Because of his ill health, he went to England in 1832 on sick leave, arriving there almost completely blind. In 1833 he published his &quot;Two Expeditions into the Interior of Southern Australia during the years 1828, 1829, 1830 and 1831&quot;, of which a second edition appeared in 1834. For the first time the public in England realised the importance of Sturt&#x27;s work. Governor Darling&#x27;s somewhat tardy but appreciative dispatch of 14 April 1831, and his request for Sturt&#x27;s promotion, had had no result. Sir Richard Bourke, who had succeeded Darling, was also unsuccessful in persuading Viscount Goderich to give &quot;this deserving officer your Lordship&#x27;s protection and support&quot;. Though the colonial office did not seem to recognise the value of Sturt&#x27;s work, publication of his book was important because it captured the attention of Edward Gibbon Wakefield, who read it. He chose South Australia for a new settlement then being contemplated by the government. In May 1834, based on his services, Sturt applied for a grant of land in Australia, intending to settle on it.

In July instructions were given that he was to receive a grant of ; in exchange, Sturt agreed to give up his pension rights. On 20 September 1834, Sturt married Charlotte Christiana Greene, daughter of a longtime family friend. Soon afterward, the couple sailed for Australia.

==Return to Australia and disappearance and likely death of Henry Bryan==
Sturt returned to Australia in mid-1835 to begin farming on his own of land, granted to him by the New South Wales government on the lower reaches of Ginninderra Creek, near present-day Canberra. (Sturt named the property &#x27;Belconnen&#x27;, a name now applied to the nearby population centre.) In 1838 he, with Giles Strangways, a Mr McLeod, and Captain John Finnis, herded cattle overland from Sydney to Adelaide, on the way proving that the Hume and the Murray were the same river.

In September 1838, Sturt led an expedition to the mouth of the Murray, which settled all dispute as to the suitability of Adelaide for the colony&#x27;s capital. After returning to NSW to settle his affairs, Sturt settled at what is now Grange, South Australia in early 1839; he was appointed Surveyor General of South Australia and a member of the South Australian Legislative Council. When the London-appointed Surveyor-General Edward Frome unexpectedly arrived, Sturt had to step down.

In the meantime, in December 1839, Sturt and his wife accompanied George Gawler, Julia Gawler, Henry Bryan and Henry Inman on a Murray River expedition, visiting Mount Bryan. Julia Gawler, Charlotte Sturt and Charlotte&#x27;s maidservant became the first white women to travel the Murray.

Sturt served briefly as the Registrar-General, but he soon proposed a major expedition with Henry Bryan into the interior of Australia as a way of restoring his reputation in the colony and London. Two days late while riding in very hot weather, with their water supply dwindling, both the men and horses were suffering. During the return journey to the river, Bryan&#x27;s horse was slow, and was lagging behind the main group. When a dust storm occurred, Bryan got lost, was separated from his horse, and most likely died. His body was never recovered, although a massive search was conducted over eight days to find him. Days later both the Governor and his remainder of the party reached Adelaide on 28 December. Though Bryan was never found, his horse returned to Adelaide after several months.

In September 1841, Sturt chaired a Bench of Magistrates that conducted an official inquiry into the circumstances of the Rufus River massacre. The inquiry concluded &quot;that the conduct of Mr Moorhouse and his party was justifiable, and indeed unavoidable in their circumstances&quot;.

==Exploring from Adelaide, Sturt&#x27;s third and final expedition==

Sturt believed that it was his destiny to discover a great saltwater lake, known as &#x27;the inland sea&#x27;, in the middle of Australia. At very least, he wanted to be the first explorer to plant his foot in &#x27;the centre&#x27; of Australia. In August 1844, he set out with a party of 15 men, 200 sheep, six drays, and a boat to explore north-western New South Wales and to advance into central Australia. They travelled along the Murray and Darling rivers before being guided past the future site of Broken Hill by a local Indigenous teenager named Topar. They were stranded for months by the extreme summer conditions near the present site of Milparinka.

When the rains eventually came, Sturt moved north and established a depot at Fort Grey (today this site is within Sturt National Park). With a small group of men, including explorer John McDouall Stuart as his draughtsman, Sturt pressed on across what is now known as Sturt&#x27;s Stony Desert and into the Simpson Desert. Unable to go further, he turned back to the depot. Sturt made a second attempt to reach the centre of Australia, but he developed scurvy in the extreme conditions. His health broke down and he was forced to abandon the attempt. John Harris Browne, surgeon on the expedition, assisted Sturt, took over leadership of the party and, after travelling a total of , brought it back to safety.

==Later life==

Early in 1847 Sturt went to England on leave. He arrived in October and was presented with the Royal Geographical Society&#x27;s Founder&#x27;s Medal. He prepared his &quot;Narrative of an Expedition into Central Australia&quot; for publication; however, it was not published until early in 1849. Throughout this time he was suffering again with poor eyesight.

Sturt returned to Adelaide with his family, arriving in August 1849. He was immediately appointed Colonial Secretary with a seat in the legislative council. There was no lack of work in the ensuing years. Roads were constructed, and navigation on the Murray was encouraged. However Sturt had renewed trouble with his eyes, which limited his ability to perform these duties. On 30 December 1851, he resigned from both positions and was given a pension of £600 a year. He settled on of land close to Adelaide and the sea. But the gold discoveries had increased the cost of living there. On 19 March 1853 Sturt and his family sailed for England. Sturt lived at Cheltenham and devoted himself to the education of his children.

In 1855 Sturt applied unsuccessfully for the positions of Governor of Victoria and in 1858 for Governor of Queensland. Sturt&#x27;s age, uncertain health, and comparatively small income were against him. By 1860 Sturt&#x27;s three sons were all serving in the army. The remainder of his family went to live at Dinan to economise after the expenses of education and fitting out. But they found the town to be unhealthy and in 1863 returned to Cheltenham. In 1864 Sturt suffered great grief in the death of one of his sons in India.

In March 1869 Sturt attended the inaugural dinner of the Colonial Society, at which Lord Granville mentioned that it was the intention of the government to extend the Order of St Michael and St George to the colonies. Sturt allowed himself to be persuaded by his friends to apply for a knighthood (KCMG), but afterwards regretted he had done so, when he heard there were innumerable applications.

Sturt&#x27;s health had been very variable and on 16 June 1869, he died suddenly. He was survived by his widow, two sons, Colonel Napier George Sturt, R.E. and Major-General Charles Sheppey Sturt, and daughter Charlotte. Mrs Sturt was granted a civil list pension of £80 a year, and the queen granted her the title of Lady Sturt, as if her husband&#x27;s nomination to a knighthood of the order of St Michael and St George had been gazetted. Reproductions of portraits of Sturt by Crossland and Koberwein were published in his biography, called &quot;Life,&quot; written by his daughter-in-law, Mrs N. G. Sturt. These suggest the charm and refinement of Sturt&#x27;s character.

Sturt&#x27;s life is summarised in the &quot;Australian Dictionary of Biography&quot; as follows:
Sturt is buried in Cheltenham Cemetery, Gloucestershire.

<doc id="321494" wikidata="Q156033" url="?curid=321494" title="Johann Stamitz">
<text>Johann Wenzel Anton Stamitz (Czech: Jan Václav Antonín Stamic; 18 June 1717 – 27 March 1757) was a Bohemian composer and violinist. His two surviving sons, Carl and Anton Stamitz, were composers of the Mannheim school, of which Johann is considered the founding father. His music is stylistically transitional between the Baroque and Classical periods.

==Life==
Stamitz was born in Deutschbrod, Bohemia, into a family that came from Marburg (today Maribor, Slovenia).

Stamitz spent the academic year 1734–1735 at the University of Prague. After only one year, he left the university to pursue a career as a violin virtuoso. His activities during the six-year period between his departure from the university in 1735 and his appointment in Mannheim around 1741 are not precisely known.

He was appointed by the Mannheim court in 1741 or 1742. Most likely, his engagement there resulted from contacts made during the Bohemian campaign and coronation of Carl Albert (Karl VII) of Bavaria, a close ally of the Elector Palatine. In January 1742, Stamitz performed before the Mannheim court as part of the festivities surrounding the marriage of Karl Theodor, who succeeded his uncle Karl Philipp as Elector Palatine less than a year later; Carl Albert was among the wedding guests.

Stamitz married Maria Antonia Luneborn on 1 July 1744. They had five children together, Carl Philipp, Maria Franziska, Anton Thadäus Nepomuk, and two children who died in infancy.

Probably around the late summer of 1754, Stamitz paid a yearlong visit to Paris, perhaps at the invitation of music patron Alexandre Le Riche de La Poupelinière with whom he stayed, appearing in public there for the first time at a Concert Spirituel on 8 September 1754. His Parisian success induced him to publish his Orchestral Trios, Op. 1 (actually symphonies for string orchestra), and possibly other works of his by various publishers there.

He probably returned to Mannheim around the autumn of 1755, dying there in spring 1757, less than two years later, at the age of 39. The entry of his death reads: &quot;30 March 1757. Buried, Jo&#x27;es Stainmiz, director of court music, so expert in his art that his equal will hardly be found. Rite provided&quot;.

== Compositions ==

Stamitz&#x27;s most important compositions are his 58 symphonies and his 10 orchestral trios. The orchestral trios are actually symphonies for strings, but may be played one player to a part as chamber music. His concertos include numerous ones for violin, two for viola, two for harpsichord, 12 for flute, one for oboe, one for trumpet, and one for clarinet, among the earliest concertos for the instrument (Johann Melchior Molter&#x27;s six from the 1740s seem to have been the first). He also composed a large amount of chamber music for various instrumental combinations, as well as eight vocal works including his widely circulated concert Mass in D.

Because at least five other 18th-century musicians bore the surname Stamitz, including four from Johann&#x27;s immediate family, any attempt to catalog his (or any of the others&#x27;) works is risky at best, principally in view of the many variations in spelling. Actually, few difficulties arise in distinguishing between works by Johann Stamitz and those of his sons Carl and Anton. By contrast, the relationship of the names &#x27;Steinmetz&#x27; and &#x27;Stamitz&#x27; has caused substantial confusion, given at least two other 18th-century musicians with the surname Steinmetz.

==Innovations in the Classical symphony==

Johann Stamitz&#x27;s expanded orchestration included important wind parts. His symphonies of the 1750s are scored in eight parts: four strings, two horns and two oboes, although flutes or clarinets may substitute for the oboes. Horns provided not only a harmonic backdrop for strings but solo lines as well, and he was also one of the first composers to write independent lines for oboes.

The chief innovation in Stamitz&#x27;s symphonic works is their four-movement structure: fast – slow – minuet and trio – dashing presto or prestissimo finale. While prior isolated four-movement symphonies exist, Stamitz was the first composer to use it consistently: well over half his symphonies and nine of his ten orchestral trios are in four movements. He also contributed to the development of sonata form, most often used in symphonic first movements but occasionally in finales (when not in rondo form) and even slow movements (when not in ABA ternary form) as well.

Stamitz also adapted and extended traits originally developed in Italian opera in his instrumental works. He added innovative dynamic devices such as extended crescendos, simple &quot;tutti&quot; chordal textures and slow harmonic rhythm. Like Italian operas, Stamitz&#x27;s compositions have a strong sense of rhythmic drive and distinctive thematic material.

<doc id="321495" wikidata="Q2738964" url="?curid=321495" title="Bill O'Reilly (cricketer)">
<text>William Joseph O&#x27;Reilly (20 December 19056 October 1992) was an Australian cricketer, rated as one of the greatest bowlers in the history of the game. Following his retirement from playing, he became a well-respected cricket writer and broadcaster.

O&#x27;Reilly was one of the best spin bowlers ever to play cricket. He delivered the ball from a two-fingered grip at close to medium pace with great accuracy, and could produce leg breaks, googlies, and top spinners, with no discernible change in his action. A tall man for a spinner (around 188 cm, 6 ft 2 in), he whirled his arms to an unusual extent and had a low point of delivery that meant it was very difficult for the batsman to read the flight of the ball out of his hand. When O&#x27;Reilly died, Sir Donald Bradman said that he was the greatest bowler he had ever faced or watched. In 1935, &quot;Wisden&quot; wrote of him: &quot;O&#x27;Reilly was one of the best examples in modern cricket of what could be described as a &#x27;hostile&#x27; bowler.&quot; In 1939, &quot;Wisden&quot; reflected on Bill O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s successful 1938 Ashes tour of England: &quot;He is emphatically one of the greatest bowlers of all time.&quot;

As a batsman, O&#x27;Reilly was a competent right-hander, usually batting well down the order. O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s citation as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1935 said: &quot;He had no pretensions to grace of style or any particular merit, but he could hit tremendously hard and was always a menace to tired bowlers.&quot;

As well as his skill, O&#x27;Reilly was also known for his competitiveness, and he bowled with the aggression of a paceman. In a short biographical essay on O&#x27;Reilly for the &quot;Barclays World of Cricket&quot; book, contemporary England cricketer Ian Peebles wrote that &quot;any scoring-stroke was greeted by a testy demand for the immediate return of the ball rather than a congratulatory word. Full well did he deserve his sobriquet of &#x27;Tiger&#x27;.&quot;

==Youth and early career==
Of Irish descent, O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s paternal grandfather Peter emigrated from County Cavan, Ulster in 1865. Arriving in Sydney, he had been a policeman for four years in Ireland and continued in this line of work in New South Wales. He was sent to Deniliquin in the Riverina, where he settled and married another Irish immigrant, Bridget O&#x27;Donoghue from Ballinasloe, County Galway. O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s father, Ernest, was a school teacher and moved around the areas surrounding the Murray River to study and teach. O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s mother Mina (née Welsh) was of mixed Irish and English descent, of a third generation family from Adelaide. O&#x27;Reilly was born in the opal mining town of White Cliffs, New South Wales. Ernest had been appointed to open the first school in the town, and had helped to build the school and its furniture himself. Bill was the fourth child in the family, with two elder brothers and a sister.

O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s cricket skills were largely self-taught; his family moved from town to town whenever his father was posted to a different school, he had little opportunity to attend coaching. He learned to play with his brothers, playing with a &quot;gum-wood bat and a piece of banksia root chiselled down to make a ball.&quot; He learned to bowl because his older brothers dominated the batting rights. His bowling action was far from the classic leg spin bowler&#x27;s run-up and delivery, indeed, according to &quot;Wisden&quot;, &quot;he was asked to make up the numbers in a Sydney junior match and, with a method that at first made everyone giggle, whipped out the opposition&quot;. From a young age, O&#x27;Reilly was a tall and gangly player.

In January 1908, shortly after Bill had turned two, the family moved to Murringo, after Ernest was appointed the headmaster. O&#x27;Reilly said in his autobiography &quot;Tiger&quot; that the move played no vital part in his cricket education. The area had much more vegetation than the desolate White Cliffs, and an Irish Australian majority. O&#x27;Reilly later described the period as the happiest of his life. There the children played tennis on a court on their property and took up cricket. During this time, O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s mother gave birth to another son and two more daughters. In 1917, at the age of 12, the family moved to the town of Wingello. Ernest made the decision because there were no high schools near Murringo and his older children were about to finish primary school. Nevertheless, there was no high school in Wingello where Ernest had been appointed headmaster, so O&#x27;Reilly had to catch a train to Goulburn—50 km away—to study at the local public secondary school, where his elder brother Tom had been awarded a scholarship. Wingello was a cricket town and &quot;everyone was a cricket crank&quot; according to O&#x27;Reilly. It was here that he developed a passion for the game. O&#x27;Reilly played in the town&#x27;s team and also won the regional tennis championships. O&#x27;Reilly bowled with an action reminiscent of the windmill that his family erected in the town. However, school life was difficult, especially in the winter, as the Southern Tablelands were harsh and cold. The O&#x27;Reilly children had to leave Wingello at 7.45 am by rail and caught a slow goods train that delivered them home at 7 pm; these vehicles did not provide protection against the weather, and the boys did not participate in any school sport as the only train home left after the end of classes.

In the early 1920s, O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s eldest brother Jack moved to Sydney. One afternoon, Jack watched spin bowler Arthur Mailey in the North Sydney practice nets and managed to describe the famous bowler&#x27;s &#x27;Bosie&#x27; action in a letter to Bill. O&#x27;Reilly claims to have perfected the action of changing the spin from anticlockwise to clockwise without any discernible hand movement within a couple of days. O&#x27;Reilly said that &quot;The bosie became my most prized possession. I practised day in, day out&quot;. 
Ernest decided that the train journeys and frozen limbs were too much for his son, so he sent Bill to St Patrick&#x27;s College, Goulburn as a boarder in 1921, where he quickly showed his athletic flair by becoming a member of the school&#x27;s rugby league, tennis, athletics and cricket teams. He held a state record for the triple jump. At the same time, he also represented the town team. During his time at St Patrick&#x27;s, O&#x27;Reilly developed his ruthless and parsimonious attitude towards bowling. After three years at the Irish Catholic school, funded by a scholarship, O&#x27;Reilly completed his Leaving Certificate.

== Sydney Teachers College ==
O&#x27;Reilly won a scholarship to the Sydney Teachers College at Sydney University, to train as a schoolmaster. However, the financial assistance was only for two years and merely sufficient for O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s rent at Glebe Point. When he was in Sydney, O&#x27;Reilly received an invitation to join an athletics club based on his performances in Goulburn, but was only able to join after the secretary Dick Corish waived his membership fee. Jumping 47 feet, he came second in a triple jump competition behind Nick Winter, who went on to win gold in the event at the 1924 Summer Olympics with a world record of 50 ft. O&#x27;Reilly also placed second in a high jumping competition, clearing six feet. Corish was also a cricket administrator and invited O&#x27;Reilly to play in a David Jones Second XI. Not knowing anything of his new recruit&#x27;s abilities, Corish did not allow O&#x27;Reilly to bowl until he explicitly complained of only being allowed to field. O&#x27;Reilly promptly finished off the opposition&#x27;s innings by removing the middle and lower order. After an encounter with journalist Johnny Moyes, who wrote glowingly about O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s skills.

While training as a teacher, O&#x27;Reilly joined the Sydney University Regiment, a unit of the Militia Forces (Army Reserve). He did not enjoy his time in the military, and along with most of his peers, regarded the commanding officer as inept. O&#x27;Reilly was a non-conformist who did not enjoy taking orders, and was unimpressed with the firearm drills, because the recruits were armed only with wooden sticks. However, he signed up for a second year to raise money for his education. Fed up with military routines he considered to be pointless, O&#x27;Reilly volunteered to be a kitchen hand.

During a vacation, O&#x27;Reilly caught the train from Sydney back to Wingello, which stopped at Bowral mid-journey. There, Wingello were playing the host town in a cricket match, and O&#x27;Reilly was persuaded to interrupt his journey to help his teammates. This match marked his first meeting with Bowral&#x27;s 17-year-old Don Bradman, later to become his Test captain. O&#x27;Reilly himself later described thus:
The wicket ended a period of suffering for O&#x27;Reilly at the hands of Bradman, who had hit many fours and sixes from him. Bradman&#x27;s counter-attack came after he had been dropped twice from O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s bowling before reaching 30 by Wingello&#x27;s captain Selby Jeffery. On the first occasion, the ball hit Jeffery in the chest while he was lighting his pipe; soon after the skipper failed to see the ball &quot;in a dense cloud of bluish smoke&quot; as he puffed on his tobacco. The match was the start of a long on-field relationship between the pair, who were to regard one another as the best in the world in their fields. O&#x27;Reilly recalled that Bradman &quot;knew what the game was all about&quot;.

O&#x27;Reilly did not enjoy his time at the overcrowded Sydney Teachers College (STC), decrying the lack of practical training and the predominance of pedagogical theory. Regarding it as a waste of time, he happily accepted an offer of work experience from Major Cook-Russell, the head of physical education at STC, to help at Naremburn College instead of attending lectures. This angered Professor Alexander Mackie, the head of STC, whom both Cook-Russell and O&#x27;Reilly regarded as incompetent.

O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s initial posting after abandoning his training was to a government school in Erskineville, an inner-city suburb in Sydney. At the time, the suburb was slum-like and impoverished, with many unruly students. Many of the pupils were barely clothed and tested O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s ability to discipline. He said that he learned more in three months there under Principal Jeremiah Walsh than he would have in ten years at STC. Major Cook-Russell then started a military cadet program in New South Wales schools; O&#x27;Reilly started such a program at Erskineville and his students won the statewide competition &quot;in a canter&quot;. O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s time at Erskineville also marked the start of work-sport conflicts that hampered his cricket career. He joined North Sydney Cricket Club in 1926–27 and was selected at short notice to play in an invitational match under retired Australian captain Monty Noble at the Sydney Cricket Ground. As the education department required a week&#x27;s notice for leave requests, O&#x27;Reilly declined, but was then ordered by the Chief Inspector of Schools to play after turning up at school on the morning of the match. Having taken six wickets, the match was then washed out, and O&#x27;Reilly then had his pay deducted, much to his chagrin.

== First-class career ==

=== Debut ===
O&#x27;Reilly was selected for the New South Wales practice squad based on his performance in a single match for North Sydney against Gordon in 1927–28. In this game, he bowled Moyes—a state selector—with a medium paced leg break. At state training, O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s new teammate and Test leg spinner Arthur Mailey advised him to adopt a more conventional grip, but the 19th century Test bowler Charles Turner, known as &quot;Terror Turner&quot; and famous for his unorthodox ways, told O&#x27;Reilly to back his self-styled technique. O&#x27;Reilly decided to listen to Turner.

After taking a total of 3/88 in a Second XI match against Victoria, O&#x27;Reilly made his first-class debut in the 1927–28 season, playing in three matches and taking seven wickets. In his first match, against New Zealand, O&#x27;Reilly took 2/37 and 1/53. He then played in what would be his only Sheffield Shield match for several years, going wicketless against Queensland, before returning figures of 4/35 against Tasmania.

===Rural teaching post and absence from cricket===
In 1928, O&#x27;Reilly was transferred by the New South Wales Education Department to Griffith, New South Wales, an outback town in the south-west of the state, and he was unable to play first-class cricket. Over the next three years he moved around the country, including postings to Rylstone and Kandos.
Teaching duties may have cost O&#x27;Reilly an early entry into Test cricket, as many young players were introduced in the 1928–29 home series against England following a large number of retirements of older players.
In the meantime, O&#x27;Reilly taught English to primary school children in Griffith, as well as singing—most of the pieces were Irish. At Rylstone he taught book-keeping and business, and he was promoted to the high school at Kandos. During this time he supplemented his income by travelling from town to town, playing in one-off cricket matches at the expense of the host&#x27;s club. He worked on his bosie during the period and regularly dismissed outclassed opposition batsmen. O&#x27;Reilly regarded his cricketing isolation as highly beneficial as he regarded coaches to be ill-advised and detrimental to development.

=== Return to Sydney ===
In late 1930, O&#x27;Reilly was posted to Kogarah Intermediate High School in the southern Sydney suburb of Kogarah, where he taught English, history, geography and business. O&#x27;Reilly resumed playing for North Sydney, confident that with an improved bosie, he was much more potent than before his rural teaching stint. As he only arrived back in Sydney in the second half of the 1930–31 season, O&#x27;Reilly was not considered for first-class selection, but he took 29 wickets at 14.72 for North Sydney. 

In the 1931–32 season he emerged as the successor to Mailey in the New South Wales side. Within half a dozen games, he was one of several young players introduced to the Australian cricket team for the Fourth Test in a badly one-sided series against South Africa. However, matters could have been rather different. O&#x27;Reilly had broken into the team for New South Wales&#x27; away matches against South Australia and Victoria while the Test players were on international duty. He totaled only 2/81 in the first match and was then informed that he would be dropped after the second fixture. O&#x27;Reilly responded by bowling with a more attacking strategy, taking 5/22 and 2/112. At the end of the match, New South Wales&#x27; stand-in captain, the leg spinning all rounder Reginald Bettington, declared O&#x27;Reilly &quot;the greatest bowler in the world&quot;, and although few agreed with this claim, Bettington made himself unavailable for selection so that O&#x27;Reilly would not be dropped. The reprieved leg spinner took a total of 8/204 in his next two matches, and while the figures were not overwhelming, they were enough to ensure a Test berth; with an unassailable 3–0 lead, the selectors wanted to blood new players.

O&#x27;Reilly took four wickets on his debut at the Adelaide Oval, two in each innings, supporting the senior leg-spinner, Clarrie Grimmett, who took 14 wickets in the match and with Bradman scoring 299 not out, Australia won the match. O&#x27;Reilly retained his place when the selectors kept the winning side for the final match of the Test series at the MCG. On a pitch made treacherous by rain, he did not bowl at all when South Africa were bowled out for just 36 in the first innings, and came on only towards the end of the second innings, when he took three wickets as the touring side subsided to 45 all out. He ended his first Test series with seven wickets at 24.85. In Sheffield Shield cricket in the 1931–32 season, O&#x27;Reilly took 25 wickets at an average of 21 runs per wicket, highlighted by his maiden ten-wicket haul, 5/68 and 5/59 in a home match against South Australia after the Tests were over as New South Wales took out the title.
The following year he was more successful, taking 31 wickets at just 14 runs each. New South Wales won the competition in both seasons.

===Test regular===

O&#x27;Reilly became a regular member of the Australian Test side in the 1932–33 season and he played in all five Tests against England in the infamous Bodyline series. The Australian selectors perceived that O&#x27;Reilly would be their key bowler, and as he had never played against the English, omitted him from the early tour matches so that the tourists would not be able to decode his variations. As a result, he missed the Australian XI match against the Englishmen in Melbourne. In two Shield matches ahead of the Tests, he took 14 wickets, including a total of 9/66 in an innings win over Queensland. Although the national selectors had hidden him from the Englishmen, New South Wales declined to do so, and he played for his state a week ahead of the Tests. The hosts were bombarded with short-pitched bowling and heavily beaten by an innings; O&#x27;Reilly took 4/86 as the visitors amassed 530, dismissing leading English batsman Wally Hammond in the first of many battles between the pair.

The Tests started at the SCG and O&#x27;Reilly was the team&#x27;s leading wicket-taker for the series with 27 wickets. O&#x27;Reilly not only took most wickets but he also bowled by some distance the most overs on either side, and he achieved a bowling economy of less than two runs from each of his 383 eight-ball overs. In the first match, he took 3/117 from 67 overs as England amassed 530 and took a ten-wicket victory. While his figures suggested that he bowled poorly—none of his wickets were those of batsmen—he beat the batsmen repeatedly. Between Tests, O&#x27;Reilly took 11 wickets in two Shield matches.

In the Second Test in Melbourne, O&#x27;Reilly opened the bowling as Australia opted to use only one pace bowler on a turning pitch. After Australia had made only 228, O&#x27;Reilly trapped Bob Wyatt leg before wicket (lbw) before bowling both the Nawab of Pataudi and Maurice Leyland to leave England at 4/98. He later took two tail-end wickets to end with 5/63 and secure Australia a first innings lead. Defending a target of 251, O&#x27;Reilly bowled the leading English opener Herbert Sutcliffe for 33 with a textbook perfect leg break that pitched on leg stump and clipped the top of the off stump. According to English team manager Plum Warner, Sutcliffe had never been defeated so comprehensively. O&#x27;Reilly also removed Hammond on the way to ending with 5/66 and securing a 111-run win. The ten-wicket haul was O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s first at Test level and the start of his strong career record over the English. However, Australia were not to taste further success. The controversial &quot;fast leg theory&quot; bowling used by England under newly appointed captain Douglas Jardine brought the touring team victories in the last three matches: Australia were handicapped not only by the tactics, but also by a lack of quality fast bowlers; O&#x27;Reilly also opened the bowling in both the Third and Fourth Tests in Adelaide and Brisbane respectively due to the selection of only one paceman. He was hindered by a decline in the form of Grimmett, who was dropped after the Third Test. O&#x27;Reilly took 2/83 and 4/79 in Adelaide, collecting the wicket of Sutcliffe for single figures in the first innings of a match overshadowed by near-riots after captain Bill Woodfull was struck in the heart. Australia were crushed by 338 runs, and lost the series in Brisbane. After O&#x27;Reilly had taken 4/101—including Sutcliffe and Jardine—in the first innings to keep Australia&#x27;s first innings deficit to 16, the hosts collapsed to be 175 all out. O&#x27;Reilly took one wicket in the second innings of a six-wicket loss. The final Test in Sydney took a similar course; O&#x27;Reilly took 4/111 in the first innings including Sutcliffe and Jardine again, as the tourists took a 14-run lead before completing an eight-wicket win after another Australian collapse. O&#x27;Reilly was wicketless in the second innings and bowled 72 overs in total in the match. Reflecting on the performance of O&#x27;Reilly in the series, R Mason said &quot;here we saw the first flexing of that most menacing genius&quot;.

In the 1933–34 season, with no Test series in Australia, O&#x27;Reilly finished top of the Sheffield Shield bowling averages, taking 33 wickets at an average of 18.30, but he had an inconsistent run. He started the season with 6/58 and 7/53 in an innings win over Queensland. After managing only three wickets across two consecutive testimonial matches, O&#x27;Reilly went wicketless against South Australia. He was angered by the subsequent comments in newspapers that he had already passed his zenith, and returned to form against Victoria at the MCG. After claiming 3/92 in the first innings, he took 9/50 in the second innings. The nine wickets included six Test players, including leading batsmen Woodfull and Bill Ponsford. Given his heavy workload in the previous season, it was decided to keep O&#x27;Reilly fresh for the subsequent tour of England, so he played in only two of the last three matches, with a reduced bowling load, taking eight wickets. During the season, Bradman moved to North Sydney from St George Cricket Club to captain the team, and it was the only summer in which O&#x27;Reilly played alongside Bradman at grade level. The following year, O&#x27;Reilly moved to St George, which was near Kogarah, as they were obliged to play for a team in their area of residence.

O&#x27;Reilly was selected for the tour of England in 1934, where he and Grimmett were the bowling stars as Australia regained the Ashes. They began by taking 19 of the 20 England wickets to fall in a comfortable victory in the First Test at Trent Bridge. O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s match figures were 11 wickets for 129 runs, and taking seven for 54 in his second innings was to produce his best Test figures.

England then won the Second Test at Lord&#x27;s, aided by the weather and Australia&#x27;s inability to force the issue by avoiding the follow on. The hosts batted first and made 440, O&#x27;Reilly removing Walters. In reply, Australia were 2/192 when rain struck on the second evening and the sun turned the pitch into a sticky wicket the next day. When O&#x27;Reilly came in at 8/273, only 17 runs were needed to avoid the follow on, but he misjudged the flight of a Hedley Verity delivery and was bowled, thinking the ball to be fuller than it was and missing a lofted drive. Australia fell six runs short and were forced to bat again when the pitch was at its worst. They were bowled out again on the same afternoon as Verity took 14 wickets in a day. O&#x27;Reilly always regretted his dismissal, as he believed that if he had helped to avoid the follow on, he would have taken &quot;six wickets without removing his waistcoat&quot; and that Australia could have then chased the target in better conditions on the fourth day.
O&#x27;Reilly shook English confidence in the Third Test, played on a placid surface at Old Trafford, by taking three wickets in four balls. Cyril Walters, who up to that point had been untroubled, failed to pick the bosie and thus inside edged the ball to short leg. Bob Wyatt came in and was clean bowled for a golden duck, bringing Hammond in to face the hat-trick ball. The new batsman inside edged the ball past the stumps and through the legs of wicket-keeper Bert Oldfield, but the next delivery clean bowled him. This left England at 3/72, and O&#x27;Reilly removed Sutcliffe soon after, but the batsmen settled down and the next wicket did not come until Hendren fell just before the end of the first day&#x27;s play. England were 5/355 and O&#x27;Reilly had taken each wicket. The next day, the hosts ended on 9/627, despite a relentless 59 overs from O&#x27;Reilly, who ended with 7/189 and was the only bowler to challenge the batsmen. The high-scoring match never looked likely to produce a result, except when Australia were in danger of being forced to follow on. They were 55 runs away from the follow on mark of 478 at the end of the third day with two wickets in hand, and O&#x27;Reilly was on one. The next day Arthur Chipperfield fell with 24 runs still needed and O&#x27;Reilly and Wall saw them to 491 before the latter fell. O&#x27;Reilly ended with 30 not out after an innings in which he was lucky not to be caught off an edge multiple times.

A further draw at Headingley, with England saved by rain after a Bradman triple century, set up a match to decide the series at The Oval. As the series was still alive, the match was timeless, rather than the customary five-day contest. After Australia made 701, O&#x27;Reilly took 2/93 to help dismiss the hosts for 321. The visitors then made 327 to set a target of 708 for victory. O&#x27;Reilly claimed 2/58, including Hammond, while Grimmett, with a total of eight wickets, proved the decisive bowler as Australia regained The Ashes with victory by 562 runs, which, more than 70 years on, is still the second largest margin of victory in terms of runs in any Test match.

O&#x27;Reilly was the leading Australian bowler of the tour, taking 28 Test wickets at an average of less than 25, while Grimmett took 25 wickets at just under 27 runs apiece. Australia&#x27;s other Test bowlers took only 18 wickets between them. On the tour as a whole, O&#x27;Reilly headed the tourists&#x27; averages, with 109 wickets at 17.04, which meant that he also topped the averages for the whole English cricket season. In the matches against the English counties, he took 11 wickets in each of the games against Leicestershire and Glamorgan, and in the match against Somerset, after Hans Ebeling took the first wicket, he took the remaining nine for 38 runs, and that proved to be the best innings figures of his career. He was named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1935 for his deeds on tour.

The tour ended with two non-first-class matches in Scotland against the hosts, and O&#x27;Reilly top-scored in a match for Australia for the only time, in the first of the two games. Having been allowed to open the innings after complaining about his lack of opportunities, he top-scored with 47 ahead of McCabe&#x27;s 16. He found the tour to be a happy and healing experience after the acrimony of the Bodyline series.
O&#x27;Reilly played little state cricket for New South Wales in 1934–35; at the time, his first child was born and he took time off to ponder his future employment. He played in only one Shield match, against arch-rivals Victoria, and in the testimonial match for the retiring Woodfull and Ponsford. He took a total of eight wickets at 31.37 in these matches.

O&#x27;Reilly played no Shield cricket the following season, when he was selected for the Australian tour to South Africa. Although Bradman had been vice-captain under Woodfull in 1934, he did not travel to South Africa on grounds of ill health, but played a full domestic season despite this. The team was captained by Victor Richardson, and O&#x27;Reilly publicly described it as the happiest tour he had been on—he was one of several players who did not get along with Bradman.

The tour was another triumph for the leg-spin attack of O&#x27;Reilly and Grimmett, but O&#x27;Reilly was slightly overshadowed by his teammate in the Tests. With 44 wickets, Grimmett set a new record for the number of wickets by an Australian in a Test series, and he raised his Test career total to 216 wickets, beating the then world record of 189 by Englishman Sydney Barnes. O&#x27;Reilly took 27 Test wickets at an average of just over 17 runs each: the other bowlers in the Australian team took 27 wickets between them. On the tour as a whole, O&#x27;Reilly came out ahead of Grimmett, with 95 wickets against Grimmett&#x27;s 92, and an average of 13.56 against 14.80. O&#x27;Reilly also revealed hitherto undiscovered batting talents, making an undefeated 56 in the Fourth Test in Johannesburg, and putting on 69 for the last wicket with Ernie McCormick. It was the only time in his first-class cricket career that he passed 50. During the tour, O&#x27;Reilly developed his leg trap; the opening batsmen Jack Fingleton and Bill Brown were used in these positions.

===Senior bowler===

With Bradman&#x27;s appointment as captain of the Australian team after the South African tour, Clarrie Grimmett was dropped, leaving O&#x27;Reilly as the hub of the Australian bowling attack for the MCC Ashes tour in 1936–37.

O&#x27;Reilly was strongly aggrieved by the removal of his long-time bowling partner, and maintained that it was an &quot;unpardonable&quot; error that heavily weakened Australia&#x27;s bowling attack. However, he remained vague about why he thought Grimmett had been removed, even though suspicion dogged Bradman. Grimmett continued to dominate the wicket-taking on domestic cricket, while his replacements struggled in the international arena.

O&#x27;Reilly responded by becoming the leading Australian wicket-taker in the series taking 25, with Bill Voce taking 26 for England. However, he almost failed to take to the field; O&#x27;Reilly and several players had threatened to withdraw after vice-captain Stan McCabe&#x27;s wife was forbidden from sitting in the Members&#x27; Stand in the First Test. The Australian Board of Control backed down, but it was the start of a tumultuous season.

O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s wickets were at increased cost—his average increased to 22 runs per wicket—and he took five wickets in an innings only once, in the First Test at the &#x27;Gabba in Brisbane, which England won convincingly. The circumstances of the series determined O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s role: after England won the first two Tests, O&#x27;Reilly appeared to have been given the job not just of bowling the opposition out, but also of containing them, and he was criticised in &quot;Wisden&quot; for defensive bowling. &quot;Wisden&quot; even went as far as to describe it as &quot;leg theory&quot;. If the intention was to stifle England batsman Wally Hammond in particular, then it appears to have worked, but O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s figures for the series suggest he was consistent but not always penetrative. Morris Sievers, from fewer matches, outperformed his average; Leslie Fleetwood-Smith, a slow left-arm spinner, got more eye-catching individual figures, including 10 wickets in the victory at Adelaide. Whatever the methods, they were successful: having lost the first two Tests, Australia proceeded to win the final three to retain The Ashes they had regained in England in 1934, and O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s five for 51 and three for 58 were the best figures in the decisive Fifth Test in Melbourne.

In the 1937–38 season, O&#x27;Reilly returned to more regular state cricket, and New South Wales duly won the Sheffield Shield for the first time in five seasons. He took 33 wickets at an average of just over 14 runs each, and against South Australia at Adelaide he repeated his feat against Somerset in 1934, taking the last nine wickets of the first innings at a cost of 41 runs. This time, he followed up with five for 57 in the second innings.

=== 1938: Final tour of England ===

O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s second and final Ashes tour to England as a player in 1938 again saw him as the most effective bowler in the team. His final record of 22 wickets at an average of 27.72 in the four Tests—the Third Test was rained off without a ball being bowled—was marginally less than 1934, and in all matches he took 104 wickets at 16.59. In its report of the tour, however, &quot;Wisden&quot;&#x27;s 1939 edition noted that &quot;it was nothing short of remarkable that despite the moderate support accorded to him he bowled so consistently well and so effectively.&quot; Again, O&#x27;Reilly was often used defensively where there was no help from the wicket, but, &quot;Wisden&quot; added, &quot;when... the wicket gave him the least encouragement he robbed the greatest batsmen of initiative, and was most destructive&quot;.

O&#x27;Reilly took 3/164 on a batting paradise in the First Test at Trent Bridge as England scored 8/658 and forced Australia to follow on and hold on for a draw. In the Second Test at Lord&#x27;s O&#x27;Reilly took 4/93 in the first innings and trapped Eddie Paynter for 99 to end a 222-run partnership with Hammond. In reply to England&#x27;s 494, Australia were in danger of being forced to follow on; O&#x27;Reilly came in and made 42, featuring in a partnership of 85 in only 46 minutes with Bill Brown that enabled Australia to save the match: having been dropped by Paynter, he hit Hedley Verity for consecutive sixes to take Australia past the follow-on mark. Brown recalled &quot;It was a nice day, and a nice wicket. O&#x27;Reilly came in, and I told him I&#x27;d take the quicks—Wellard and Farnes—and Tiger [O&#x27;Reilly] took Verity.&quot; Australia reached 422 and O&#x27;Reilly took 2/53 in the second innings as the match petered into a draw.

In an otherwise high-scoring series, O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s greatest triumph was in the low-scoring Fourth Test at Headingley, where he exploited a difficult pitch to take five wickets in each innings as Australia secured the victory that enabled them to retain the Ashes. With the series level at 0–0, England captain Hammond elected to bat first; O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s 5/66 was largely responsible for ending England&#x27;s innings at 223. He removed Hammond, who had top-scored with 76, Bill Edrich and Denis Compton, all bowled in quick succession. England were 1/73 on the third day, an overall lead of 54, when O&#x27;Reilly began a new spell after Bradman had switched his ends. Joe Hardstaff junior hooked him for four and the next ball was no-balled by the umpire. O&#x27;Reilly was reported to have become visibly enraged; he bowled Hardstaff next ball and then removed Hammond for a golden duck. This precipitated an English collapse to 123 all out, and O&#x27;Reilly ended with 5/56 and a total of 10/122. O&#x27;Reilly effort proved to be crucial as Australia scraped home by five wickets just 30 minutes before black clouds brought heavy rain, which would have made batting treacherous. The victory ensured the retention of the Ashes, and O&#x27;Reilly ranked it as his finest performance, alongside his ten wickets in the Second Bodyline Test of 1932–33.

Australia had retained the Ashes, but England struck back at The Oval, where they posted the then-record Test score of 7/903. Early on, O&#x27;Reilly trapped Edrich lbw for 12, to secure his 100th Test wicket against England. In a timeless match, Len Hutton made a world record Test score of 364 in a fastidious and watchful innings of 13 hours, surpassing Bradman&#x27;s 334. When he was on 333, O&#x27;Reilly deliberately bowled two no-balls in an attempt to break Hutton&#x27;s concentration by tempting him to hit out, but the Englishman blocked them with a straight bat.

O&#x27;Reilly eventually removed Hutton and ended with 3/178 off 85 overs. Nevertheless, these compared favourably with Fleetwood-Smith&#x27;s 1/298 off 87 overs. O&#x27;Reilly was the only Australian to take more than a solitary wicket, and rated Hutton&#x27;s knock as the finest innings played against him. Australia collapsed to lose by an innings and 579 runs, the heaviest defeat in Test history. O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s lack of success went with The Oval Test in 1934, when he took a total of 4/151.

O&#x27;Reilly scaled back his participation in Sheffield Shield cricket in the 1938–39 season, making himself unavailable for most of the campaign to spend time with his newborn son after half a year in England; he played in only two matches, against South Australia and arch-rivals Victoria. He took a ten-wicket haul in the latter match, but his figures of 6/152 and 4/60 were not enough to prevent defeat. Both teams were at full strength and eight of O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s victims were Test players, including batsman Lindsay Hassett twice. O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s only other match was for Bradman&#x27;s XI against Rigg&#x27;s XI in a match to commemorate the centenary of the Melbourne Cricket Club, in which he took a total of 7/129, to end the season with 19 wickets at 23.16.

He resumed regular service for New South Wales in the next season, taking 55 wickets at 15.12 in seven matches. He took 8/23 and 6/22 to set up an innings win over Queensland and 6/77 and 4/62 in another victory over South Australia. The two matches against Victoria were shared as O&#x27;Reilly took 17 wickets. In the second of the matches, in Sydney, Hassett became the only person to score centuries in both innings of match involving O&#x27;Reilly. Despite Hassett&#x27;s feat, New South Wales won the match; O&#x27;Reilly took a total of 8/157. 

O&#x27;Reilly continued his strong run in 1940–41, taking 55 wickets at 12.43 in eight matches. He took nine wickets in three consecutive matches, once for McCabe&#x27;s XI in a match against Bradman&#x27;s XI, which his team won by an innings, and in both matches against Victoria, which were split between the two states. First-class cricket was ended after one match in 1941–42; O&#x27;Reilly took a total of 9/124 in a loss to Queensland before the attack on Pearl Harbor signaled the start of World War II in the Pacific. In the meantime, O&#x27;Reilly continued to play for St George and topped the grade competition&#x27;s bowling averages for years from 1941 to 1942 onwards. He averaged between 8 and 9 in all these seasons, and took more than 100 wickets in three consecutive summers, peaking with 147 in 1943–44. O&#x27;Reilly had tried to enlist in the military in 1941, but after presenting himself for the medical, was informed that his employer was deemed a &quot;protected undertaking&quot;, so their workers were not allowed to enlist.

First-class cricket resumed in Australia in 1945–46 after the end of the war, although the Shield competition was not held that season. O&#x27;Reilly captained New South Wales at the age of 40, and although the emergence of Ray Lindwall and Ernie Toshack in the state side indicated a shift in emphasis away from spin and towards faster bowling, O&#x27;Reilly maintained his pre-war standards. He took 33 wickets at 14.36 in six matches and New South Wales were undefeated; they won four matches and drew both fixtures against Victoria. He took at least two wickets in every innings and claimed his innings best of 6/43 against Queensland. O&#x27;Reilly also took a match total of 7/94 in an innings win over the Australian Services team, which had drawn a series against a full-strength England team.

O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s final first-class cricket came on a four-match tour by an Australian team to New Zealand in early 1946. O&#x27;Reilly was the vice-captain of the team, which was led by Bill Brown. The main fixture during the tour was a four-day match against a representative New Zealand side in Wellington, retrospectively designated as the first Test between the two countries in 1948. The uncertain nature of the tour saw the Australians wear blazers labelled ABC for Australian Board of Control, rather than the usual coat of arms. New Zealand were outclassed; after winning the toss and electing to bat on a rain-affected pitch, they made 42 in their first innings and 54 in their second to lose by an innings and 103 runs. O&#x27;Reilly took 5/14 in the first innings, and 3/19 in the second, dominating with Toshack. It was his last Test and his last first-class game. O&#x27;Reilly dominated in the other tour games as well; he took match totals of 9/103 and 8/128 against Auckland and Otago respectively, and ended with 28 wickets at 10.60 for the tour. Having only decided to tour New Zealand after much consideration, O&#x27;Reilly retired at the end of the Test, throwing his boots out of the dressing room window.

== Conflict with Bradman ==

Despite the mutual admiration between Bradman and O&#x27;Reilly for their cricket skills, personal relations between the pair were strained. In Australian society at the time, sectarian tension existed between Catholics, mostly of Irish descent, of whom O&#x27;Reilly was one, and Protestants, like Bradman. Bradman was a non-drinker and a reserved character, often preferring to read quietly, rather than socialize or drink with his teammates. Coupled with his on-field dominance, this led to perceptions that Bradman was cocky and distant from his teammates. In the late 1930s, the Australian Board of Control summoned O&#x27;Reilly, Stan McCabe, Leo O&#x27;Brien and Chuck Fleetwood-Smith, all Catholics of Irish descent to a meeting to discuss the apparent schism in the team. Jack Fingleton, a trained journalist, was not invited to the meeting, but after the deaths of both Fingleton and O&#x27;Reilly, Bradman penned a letter in which he accused the former of being the ringleader. O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s eventual departure also raised speculation that a purge had occurred. In 1995, after both Fingleton and O&#x27;Reilly had died, Bradman wrote: &quot;With these fellows out of the way, the loyalty of my 1948 side was a big joy and made a big contribution to the outstanding success of that tour&quot;; the Australians went through the 1948 English summer undefeated.

O&#x27;Reilly became a journalist, and together with Fingleton, he often criticised Bradman. They were in the press box when Bradman was bowled for a duck in his final Test innings, when they were reported to have become hysterical with laughter. Nevertheless, O&#x27;Reilly kept most of his strongest feelings about Bradman to himself and suppressed them from his autobiography; he would say of Bradman that &quot;You don&#x27;t piss on statues&quot;. Before his death, O&#x27;Reilly gave a series of interviews to the National Library of Australia, in which he accused Bradman of purging Grimmett from the team because Grimmett had joked that Bradman had ensured his own dismissal in a match against Victoria, to avoid facing the express pace of Ernie McCormick.

According to cricket historian Gideon Haigh, &quot;O&#x27;Reilly was a man of embedded prejudices&quot;. In retirement, O&#x27;Reilly complained to a board member that &quot;You have to play under a Protestant to know what it&#x27;s like&quot;. The Test umpire Col Egar recalled that O&#x27;Reilly never talked to him in their decades in cricket until a third party informed the bowler that Egar was a Catholic.

Despite their conflicts, a few years before his death O&#x27;Reilly wrote that, compared with Bradman, batsmen like Greg Chappell and Allan Border were mere &quot;child&#x27;s play&quot;.

==Off-field life, mentoring and legacy==
In 1933, O&#x27;Reilly married Mary Agnes &quot;Molly&quot; Herbert, after less than six months of courtship. Of Irish stock, Molly had been introduced to O&#x27;Reilly through one of his teaching colleagues at Kogarah, who married Molly&#x27;s elder sister the following year. The couple then moved to the southern Sydney suburb of Hurstville. The couple had two children, a girl followed by a boy.

O&#x27;Reilly continued to work as a school teacher after he broke into international cricket, but at the end of 1934, after missing more than six months of the year in England, he resigned from his government post, reasoning that his career could not progress if he was going to be overseas so often. However, he had not made any plans for his future employment. Soon after, O&#x27;Reilly received an offer to work as a sportsgoods salesman for the department store David Jones with sporting leave entitlements. The Premier of New South Wales, Bertram Stevens, tried to coax O&#x27;Reilly into staying in the government education system, offering him a post at Sydney Boys High School if he returned to STC to complete the Bachelor of Arts that he had abandoned a decade before.

In 1935, O&#x27;Reilly took up an appointment at Sydney Grammar School, one of the leading private schools in the state, having been offered 50% paid leave for his cricket commitments. There he taught English, history and business. In 1939 he took a job in the sports store of close friend, teammate and fellow Irish Catholic Stan McCabe, which was located on George Street, the city centre&#x27;s main thoroughfare. O&#x27;Reilly was a financial partner in the business, but following the outbreak of World War II, the sales revenue began to suffer and O&#x27;Reilly left as the store would not be able to support two stakeholders.

O&#x27;Reilly then accepted a position as a manager of the Lion Tile Company at Auburn, in Sydney&#x27;s western suburbs. He remained in the position until 1976. O&#x27;Reilly was responsible for the financial and accounting affairs of the firm, which expanded to employ more than 200 workers. He was held in high regard and granted full paid leave when he thrice went overseas for six months to cover tours of England as a journalist. Doc Evatt, a leading Australian Labor Party politician attempted to recruit O&#x27;Reilly into politics, but was unsuccessful.

During the late-1930s, O&#x27;Reilly mentored the then-teenaged Arthur Morris and Ray Lindwall at St. George. He converted Morris from a left arm unorthodox spinner into an opening batsman, and exhorted Lindwall to become a specialist express paceman. Both had long Test careers and captained their country and are regarded as all-time Australian greats in the fields that O&#x27;Reilly chose for them—both were chosen with O&#x27;Reilly in the ACB Team of the Century. The pair credited O&#x27;Reilly as being the main influence in their careers, and Lindwall made his Test debut in O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s last Test in 1946.

In 1956–57, McCabe and O&#x27;Reilly were given a testimonial match by the New South Wales Cricket Association. The match was between Harvey&#x27;s XI and Lindwall&#x27;s XI and acted as a trial for the non-Test tour of New Zealand. It raised 7,500 pounds, which was split between McCabe and O&#x27;Reilly and would have bought two average-sized homes in Sydney at the time.

On retirement as a player, O&#x27;Reilly became a cricket columnist for &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, remaining in that position until his health declined in 1988. His first engagement was England&#x27;s tour of Australia in 1946–47, and during this season he began a partnership with the &quot;Daily Express&quot; of London, going on to cover several Ashes series for them. O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s articles for &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; were reproduced in its sister publication, &quot;The Age&quot; of Melbourne. Later, his writing was syndicated to newspapers in India, South Africa and New Zealand. His style was described by &quot;Wisden&quot; as &quot;muscular, very Australian... flavoured with wit and imagery (&#x27;You can smell the gum-leaves off him&#x27;, he wrote of one country boy just starting with Queensland).&quot; Jack McHarg said that &quot;The clarity, wit and pungency of his writing, together with almost infallible judgment, never deserted him&quot;, even as his health began to restrict him. He was a highly respected and forthright pundit, who hated one-day cricket, describing it as &quot;hit and giggle&quot;. He condemned the omission of Keith Miller in 1949–50 and said that to call it &quot;a complete surprise would be a cowardly way of describing a botch&quot;. Reacting to the selection of the dour batting all rounder Ken Mackay, he wrote &quot;words fail...to express adequately my contempt for this howler&quot;. In 1952 he had a falling-out with Lindwall after condemning his protégé for bowling five consecutive bouncers at Everton Weekes in a Test. In comparison with his illustrious contemporary on-field and on paper, &quot;while Sir Donald walked the corridors of cricketing power O&#x27;Reilly was the rumbustious backbencher.&quot; In 1956, O&#x27;Reilly strongly criticised Australian captain Ian Johnson, a Melburnian, for his leadership during the 1956 Ashes tour. &quot;The Age&quot; took exception to this and asked their sister publication to rein in their pundit. O&#x27;Reilly refused to shy away from his opinions and was dropped by the Melbourne publication. In the 1980s, when Bob Simpson became the first coach of Australia, O&#x27;Reilly, himself self-taught, spoke out against the creation of such posts. He was a strong critic of the breakaway World Series Cricket, the commercialization of the sport and the erosion of the social norms that were followed during his playing career.

Aside from his autobiography, O&#x27;Reilly wrote two books; &quot;Cricket Conquest: The Story of the 1948 Test Tour&quot;, published in 1949, and &quot;Cricket Task Force&quot;, published in 1951. They were accounts of the &quot;Invincibles&quot; tour of England in 1948 and England&#x27;s Ashes tour to Australia in 1950–51.

Upon retiring from &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, O&#x27;Reilly wrote in a column

O&#x27;Reilly was honored with several accolades late in his life. In 1980, he was awarded an Order of the British Empire for his services to cricket as a player and writer. In 1985, the oval in Wingello was renamed in his honor, and in 1988, a grandstand at the SCG was named the Bill O&#x27;Reilly Stand. In the same year, the oval in White Cliffs was renamed, and &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; renamed the medal they awarded to the best player in grade cricket in O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s honour. During the celebrations for the Australian Bicentenary, O&#x27;Reilly was named among the 200 people, and only 21 living, who had contributed the most to the country since European settlement.

O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s later years were troubled with poor health, including the loss of a leg. In late 1988, he suffered a major heart attack and was hospitalized for two months. He died in hospital in Sutherland in 1992, 75 days short of his 87th birthday. O&#x27;Reilly lamented the decline of spin during his twilight years, and in the 1980s he was often derided by younger people who felt that his advocacy of spin bowling—which they deemed to be obsolete—was misplaced. He died just months before Shane Warne revived the art of leg spin on the international stage.

In 1996, O&#x27;Reilly was posthumously inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame as one of the ten inaugural members. In 2000, O&#x27;Reilly was named in the Australian Cricket Board Team of the Century, and in 2009 he was named among the 55 inaugural inductees of the International Cricket Council&#x27;s Hall of Fame, being formally inducted in January 2010.

==Statistical summary==
In his 18-season first-class career, O&#x27;Reilly took 774 wickets at an average of 16.60. In his 27 Test matches, O&#x27;Reilly took 144 wickets at 22.59, 102 of them in his 19 Ashes Tests against England.

=== Test match performance ===
=== Career rankings and ratings ===
It has been retrospectively calculated by the International Cricket Council&#x27;s LG Ratings that he was the best bowler in the world for much of his career.
== Song tribute ==
Folk musician Ted Egan released the song &quot;The Tiger and the Don&quot; about O&#x27;Reilly and Don Bradman; it was a track from the 2003 album &quot;The Land Downunder&quot;.

<text>RKO Records and Unique Jazz are two record labels which began in 1955 as Unique Records, a New York City pop music record label. After several small pop hits, such as &quot;Man in the Raincoat&quot; by fourteen-year-old Priscilla Wright, the label was acquired by General Tire subsidiary RKO Teleradio (initially General Teleradio; acquired a majority stake in the Mutual Broadcasting System in 1952, then merged with the RKO Pictures film studio in 1955, resulting in a name change to RKO Teleradio Pictures) in 1957 and placed its owner, Stanley Borden, in charge of its music entertainment division. From 1957 on, the label was billed as RKO/Unique.

In an effort to create entertainment synergy, General Tire initially acquired majority control of Mutual in 1952 through its acquisition of the Yankee Network &amp; the stations that carried it from Shepard Stores, Inc. in 1943 &amp; the Don Lee Broadcasting Network in 1950. Then, in 1952, it added WOR (AM, FM &amp; TV), then consolidated its broadcasting interests into General Teleradio (purchased from R. H. Macy &amp; Company alongside WOR &amp; Bamberger Broadcasting; named as a result of The General Tire &amp; Rubber Company&#x27;s increased investment in WOR). 
Then, it acquired the RKO film studio from Howard Hughes in 1955. After selling the studio&#x27;s backlot to Desilu Productions in 1956, RKO&#x27;s remaining assets were merged with General Teleradio, forming RKO Teleradio Pictures.

After General Tire&#x27;s acquisition of Unique Records in 1957, the record label was re-branded as RKO/Unique. Then, General Tire used Mutual in an attempt to enhance RKO/Unique by creating a national audience for the product. Unfortunately, the concept behind the arrangement was that rock and roll music was a passing fad, and that the pop music of the 1920s through the early 1950s would endure. With that in mind, RKO/Unique signed former recording acts like Rudy Vallee, the Harmonicats and Ted Lewis in hopes of recapturing their glorious pasts. To this mix, they added popular movie stars like Herb Jeffries, Edie Adams and Frances Langford, former vaudeville stars (and RKO movie regulars) like the Vagabonds, plus current popular TV stars such as George DeWitt, then the host of the top rated &quot;Name That Tune&quot;. RKO-Unique also issued the album &quot;Music To Suffer By&quot; by Leona Anderson.

To cement this relationship, General Tire, through RKO Teleradio Pictures, created the radio program &quot;Studio X&quot; to carry the RKO/Unique product on Mutual. The result was a disaster. Within a few years (by 1957), both the radio network and the record company were suffering huge financial losses and General Tire divested both of them: Mutual was sold to 3M, while RKO/Unique was sold to an unknown buyer, in 1960.

Years later, in 1965, RKO/Unique was acquired by Reach Entertainment, who revived the label, splitting RKO Records &amp; Unique Jazz into two distinct labels.

However, eventually, Reach Entertainment ceased operations, with RKO Records &amp; Unique Jazz shutting down.

<text>Vernice &quot;Bunky&quot; Green Jr (born April 23, 1935) is an American jazz alto saxophonist and educator.

==Biography==
Green was raised in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where he played the alto saxophone, mainly at a local club called &quot;The Brass Rail&quot;.

Green&#x27;s first break came when he was hired in New York City by Charles Mingus as a replacement for Jackie McLean in the 1950s. His brief stint with the bass player and composer made a deep impression. Mingus&#x27; sparing use of notation and his belief that there was no such thing as a wrong note had a lasting influence on Green&#x27;s own style.

Green moved to Chicago, Illinois, where he performed with players such as Sonny Stitt, Louie Bellson, Andrew Hill, Yusef Lateef, and Ira Sullivan. Originally strongly influenced by Charlie Parker, Green spent a period reassessing his style and studying, emerging with a highly distinctive sound that has deeply influenced a number of younger saxophonists, including Steve Coleman and Greg Osby.

Green gradually withdrew from the public eye to develop a career as a jazz educator. He taught at Chicago State University from 1972–1989, and in the 1990s took up the directorship of the jazz studies program at the University of North Florida in Jacksonville, where he taught and acted as chair of Jazz Studies until his retirement in 2011. He has also served a term as the president of the International Association for Jazz Education and been elected to the Jazz Education Hall of Fame.

Green recorded several albums during the 1960s, including &quot;Step High&quot; (featuring Wynton Kelly and Jimmy Cobb), &quot;Playing for Keeps&quot;, and &quot;Soul in the Night&quot; (which paired Green with Sonny Stitt). In addition to a handful of records as a leader on the Vanguard label during the 1970s, he also recorded several albums with Elvin Jones, including &quot;Summit Meeting&quot; and &quot;Time Capsule&quot;. His 1989 session on the Delos label, &quot;Healing the Pain&quot;, commemorates the death of his parents and was awarded the coveted 5-star rating from &quot;DownBeat&quot; magazine. Green&#x27;s studio album, &quot;Another Place&quot; (which features the rhythm section of Jason Moran, Lonnie Plaxico, and Nasheet Waits), also received a 5-star review from &quot;Down Beat&quot;. In July 2008, his recording &quot;The Salzau Quartet Live at Jazz Baltica&quot; was released.

<doc id="321509" wikidata="Q7305772" url="?curid=321509" title="Redemptioner">
<text>Redemptioners were European immigrants, generally in the 18th or early 19th century, who gained passage to the American Colonies (most often Pennsylvania) by selling themselves into indentured servitude, to pay back the shipping company which had advanced the cost of their transatlantic voyage. British indentured servants generally did not arrive as redemptioners, after the early colonial period, due to certain protections afforded them by law. Redemptioners were at a disadvantage because they negotiated their indentures upon their arrival in America, after a long and difficult voyage, with no prospect to return to their homelands.

==History==
Up until the American Revolutionary War, some convicts from the United Kingdom were transported to the American Colonies and served out their time as indentured servants before receiving an official pardon. Labor was in demand in Colonial America, and so free persons were also recruited. Those who could not afford to pay their own way came under indentures which obligated them to work for no wages, until their land and sea transportation and other expenses had been covered. Because of abuse of the system, which included lying to recruits and even shanghaiing them, the British Parliament enacted laws protecting British subjects from the worst abuses. The law required that the specific terms and conditions of servitude be approved by a magistrate in Great Britain, and that any indentures not bearing a magistrate&#x27;s seal were unenforceable in the colonies. This resulted in British indentured servants becoming less attractive to potential colonial masters. A similar law was passed in Ireland, in an act of Parliament, whereby, in return for passage to America, the servant gave the purchaser of his indenture all rights to his labour for an agreed period of time, usually four years. Once a candidate for indentured servitude was identified, the emigration agent or visiting ship captain negotiated a binding contract detailing the terms and benefits, and the contract was presented before a local magistrate.

Non-British immigrants had no such protections. If they used the redemptioner system, they were forced to negotiate their indentures with their future master at the worst possible time, before they were allowed to leave a stinking, vermin-infested ship, at the end of a long voyage.

A few early 18th-century German-speaking colonists later sent for family members, back in the old world, by agreeing with the shipping companies to &quot;&quot; their loved ones off the arriving vessel by paying the passage —more or less a form of COD for human cargo. Ships&#x27; owners soon saw this as a lucrative opportunity. They recruited Europeans to emigrate without payment up front, and allowed anyone in the American Colonies to redeem the travelers. The fare was set by the shipping company and the prospective master bargained directly with the immigrant to determine how many years he or she would work to pay off the &quot;loan&quot; of the fare.

To fill empty holds, poor Europeans were recruited onto ships in Rotterdam by “Neulaenders” (aka Neulander), or “newlanders,” who were already living in America, but had returned to Europe to pick up some possessions, or family members, to take back to America. Neulaenders received a commission for each person they brought to the ships at the harbor, including the ship that they were going to return to America on. Therefore, they were not always a trustworthy source of information about how the program would work for the emigrant. The Neulaenders were dressed in fancy clothes, in order to impress the peasants, as they wandered about Germanic countries doing their recruiting.

The vast majority of these poor, go-now-pay-later travelers were not redeemed by family members, in America, and so the term is misleading in that most of them paid for their emigration with their own toil, tears, and sometimes their life, as a redemptioner. In America, their labour was considered a good to be lawfully bought and sold until their indentures matured. The main differences between redemptioners and African slaves, were that redemptioners came of their own accord (even if misinformed) and that they had some legal rights and an “out-of-indenture” date to look forward to. An example of how the indentured servant was viewed is the 1662 Virginia law that forced both slave and indentured servant females, who bore children by their masters, to serve even more time, after their indentures had ended, for an additional two years, for the local churchwardens. No penalty was specified for their masters for what they had done to them. On the other hand, a Virginia law of the same year stipulated that &quot;any servant giving notice to their masters (having just cause of complaint against them) for harsh and bad usage, or else for want of diet or convenient necessaries... [shall] have remedy for his grievances.&quot;

Abuse of redemptioners on board the ships is well documented. If a person died, after half-way across the Atlantic, the surviving family members had to pay for the deceased&#x27;s fare. The redemptioner&#x27;s baggage was often pilfered by the crew as well. Furthermore, many travelers started their journey with sufficient funds to pay their way, but were overcharged, so that they arrived with a debt to settle, and therefore, they had to be redeemed. If the ship needed to sail back to Europe, before all of the passengers’ indentures had been sold, an agent in the American port kept them confined, until a buyer presented himself.

The redemptioners who became indentured servants ended up working as farm laborers, household help, in workshops, and even as store clerks. They were typically prevented from marrying until after their term of service ended. Often, the terms of separation stipulated that the servant receive a suit of clothing and sometimes, a shovel or an axe. Also, some contracts required the master to teach the servant to read and write from the Bible. Conditions were sometimes harsh, as evidenced by the lists and paid announcements for the return of escaped servants in the newspapers.

The Rotterdam ships always stopped first in the U.K. (often at Cowes) to clear British customs, before proceeding to the Colonies. A list of indenture registrations in Philadelphia from 1772 to 1773 survives, and it reveals that most redemptioners worked for five to seven years, to pay their masters off. (The Bible allowed no more than seven years term of any contract, and this influenced both the law and public opinion.)

==Accounts==
The only two surviving first-person accounts by redemptioners were published in September 2006 in the book &quot;Souls for Sale: Two German Redemptioners Come to Revolutionary America&quot;. By coincidence, they both arrived in Philadelphia on the ship &quot;Sally&quot;, in the fall of 1772. John Frederick Whitehead and Johann Carl Buettner were recruited in Baltic cities, and shipped as virtual prisoners to Rotterdam, originally to be delivered to ships of the Dutch East India Company that were departing for Indonesia. Their handlers missed that opportunity, so they settled for handing them over to a ship bound for Pennsylvania.

Over time, Germans, who had finished their indentures, formed German-American societies, and one important activity for them was to lobby for humane regulations and policing of the shipping companies.

The German immigrant to Missouri, Gottfried Duden, whose published letters (1829) did much to encourage German-speaking emigration to the U.S. in the 1800s, wrote about the redemptioners. “The poor Europeans who think they have purchased the land of their desires by the hardships endured during the journey across the sea are enslaved for five, seven, or more years for a sum that any vigorous day laborer earns within six months. The wife is separated from the husband, the children from their parents, perhaps never to see each other again.” But by the time that Duden published his letters, the redemptioner system was all but dead.

<doc id="321513" wikidata="Q7672242" url="?curid=321513" title="TVS Television Network">
<text>The Television Sports Television Network, or TVS Television Network for short (commonly referred to as just TVS), was a syndicator of American sports programming. It was one of several &quot;occasional&quot; national television networks that sprang up in the 1960s to take advantage of the establishment of independent (mostly UHF) television stations and relaxation of the AT&amp;T Long Lines usage rates.

==History==
Eddie Einhorn had begun broadcasting radio coverage of college basketball and built a network of radio stations that covered the NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament games. He later moved into television coverage of college basketball games.

===College basketball===
Founded by Einhorn on December 27, 1968, and operated through TVS, Inc., the network originally telecast college basketball games to regional networks at a time when the sport was of no interest to the national networks. Taking advantage of intense regional collegiate rivalries, the network blossomed in the 1960s and developed into a full service sports network. Einhorn proceeded to put together a Saturday afternoon TVS &quot;game of the week&quot; concept that often featured some of the major midwestern independent teams such as Marquette, DePaul, and Notre Dame. These games were widely syndicated at least in the east and midwest. 
On January 20, 1968, TVS put together the &quot;Game of the Century&quot; (see below) between the UCLA Bruins and Houston Cougars basketball teams at the Houston Astrodome. This was the game that made college basketball a television broadcast commodity. Six years later (January 19, 1974), TVS televised another historic basketball game as the Bruins fell to Notre Dame, 71-70, breaking the Bruins&#x27; 88-game winning streak. TVS proceeded to syndicate a few games nationally each year, often involving UCLA in the middle of their run of 10 national championships in a 12-year span. TVS often used late night time slots for its nationally syndicated games which were played on the west coast.

In addition to these individual games, TVS was a pioneer in bringing college basketball to a national scope-first by their own efforts in the early 1970s, primarily with Dick Enberg and Rod Hundley (sometimes Enberg and Hundley would call a Pac-8 game on a Friday night, fly to the midwest for the TVS game of the week on Saturday afternoon, and then head back to the west coast to call a Pac-8 game on Saturday night), then in 1975, teaming with NBC Sports in a cooperative effort to regionalize NBC&#x27;s coverage on Saturday afternoons (NBC/local talent, TVS production crews). This partnership lasted through 1983, though it was hampered in later years by NBC losing the rights to the NCAA Division I Men&#x27;s College Basketball Tournament to CBS Sports in 1982. After the NBC partnership ended and college sports telecasts underwent a court-ordered decentralization in 1984, TVS went back to regionalizing games on their own—a forerunner to the regionalization often seen today.

Besides Dick Enberg and Rod Hundley (who worked with Merle Harmon on the January 7, 1973, contest between Kansas and Notre Dame), other broadcast teams for TVS&#x27; college basketball coverage included John Ferguson and Joe Dean (who called the February 21, 1970 contest between Kentucky and LSU), Monte Moore and Ed Macauley (who called the January 2, 1971 contest between Dayton and UCLA), Charlie Jones and Elgin Baylor (who called the January 26, 1972 contest between Providence and USC), Ray Scott and Bill O&#x27;Donnell (who called the January 14, 1973 contest between SW Louisiana and Oral Roberts), Al Michaels and Tom Hawkins (who called the January 26, 1974, contest between Notre Dame and UCLA), Max Falkenstein and Paul Deweese (Big Eight Conference) and Jay Randolph and Billy Packer (who called the November 17, 1979 contest between Duke and Kentucky, November 22, 1980 contest between DePaul and Louisville) and November 21, 1981 contest between BYU and Virginia). 

====&quot;Game of the Century&quot;====

The game that really popularized televised college basketball was a prime time Saturday night broadcast on January 20, 1968 between two powerhouse teams that had met in the 1967 NCAA Men&#x27;s Division I Basketball Tournament. The undefeated, second-ranked Houston Cougars hosted the equally unbeaten, top-ranked UCLA Bruins at the Houston Astrodome. The Bruins were the defending national champions and riding a 47-game winning streak. Eddie Einhorn paid $27,000 for the broadcast rights on TVS. Altogether, Einhorn signed up 120 stations, many of whom were network affiliates that dropped or time-shifted their regular programming to show the game. Houston won, 71–69, in front of a then-record crowd of 52,693, and the contest was soon dubbed &quot;The Game of the Century&quot;.

The &quot;Game of the Century&quot; showed that regular-season college basketball action was a viable nationwide product; previously, only NCAA post-season games were broadcast on national TV, but only on evidence that broadcasters were going to make a profit from the broadcasts.

===Other sports on TVS===
While college basketball remained the TVS Television Network&#x27;s signature series, they also expanded into tennis, college football bowl games, NASL pro soccer, tennis, and golf. They also televised the NBA–ABA All-Star Game between the rival professional basketball leagues.

In 1974, the network became the official telecaster of the World Football League. (TVS dropped its coverage of the WFL prior to 1975, contributing to the league&#x27;s already imminent demise; the league had no national television contract for their shortened second season.) TVS also aired World Championship Tennis.

===Entertainment programming===
In the 1970s, TVS began producing entertainment programming, including &quot;Sinatra: The Main Event&quot; for ABC in 1974. For many years, TVS produced sports and entertainment programming from Las Vegas including the &quot;Alan King Tennis Classic at Caesars Palace&quot;; &quot;Arm Wrestling at the Imperial Palace&quot;, &quot;Fun Moments in Sports at Bally&#x27;s&quot;; &quot;Bowling from Sam&#x27;s Town and the Showboat&quot;; The Ladies Pro Bowlers Tour (LPBT), and &quot;One Club Golf from the Desert Inn&quot;.

===Transition===
By 1973, Einhorn sold his interest in the network to the Corinthian Broadcasting Corporation for $5 million and later on became the head of CBS Sports, and later became an owner of the Chicago White Sox with Jerry Reinsdorf; he would also spend time as owner of the USFL&#x27;s Chicago Blitz. The network stalled in the 1990s, with the trademark status for the network&#x27;s branding expiring on August 29, 1993. It is presumed that the network itself would cease operations soon after.

According to a search on the website for the New York State Department of State Division of Corporations, TVS, Inc. itself would eventually ceased operations in 1995.

<doc id="321515" wikidata="Q1573151" url="?curid=321515" title="Harvard Crimson">
<text>The Harvard Crimson is the nickname of the intercollegiate athletic teams of Harvard College. The school&#x27;s teams compete in NCAA Division I. As of 2013, there were 42 Division I intercollegiate varsity sports teams for women and men at Harvard, more than at any other NCAA Division I college in the country. Like the other Ivy League colleges, Harvard does not offer athletic scholarships. 

Athletics at Harvard began in 1780 when the sophomores challenged the freshmen to a wrestling tournament with the losers buying dinner. Since its historic boat race against archrival Yale in 1852, Harvard has been in the forefront of American intercollegiate sports. Its football team conceived the modern version of the game and devised essentials ranging from the first concrete stadium to a scoreboard to uniform numbers to signals.

== Sports sponsored ==
===Baseball===

Harvard&#x27;s baseball program began competing in the 1865 season. It has appeared in four College World Series. It plays at Joseph J. O&#x27;Donnell Field and is currently coached by Bill Decker.

===Basketball===

====Men&#x27;s basketball====

Harvard has an intercollegiate men&#x27;s basketball program. The team currently competes in the Ivy League in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and play home games at the Lavietes Pavilion in Boston. The team&#x27;s last appearance in the NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament was in 2014, where they beat Cincinnati in the Round of 64 in a 12 vs. 5 seed upset. The Crimson are currently coached by Tommy Amaker.

====Women&#x27;s basketball====

Harvard has an intercollegiate women&#x27;s basketball program. The team currently competes in the Ivy League in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and play home games at the Lavietes Pavilion in Boston. The team&#x27;s last appearance in the NCAA Division I women&#x27;s basketball tournament was in 2007.

===Fencing===

The fencing team won the 2006 NCAA team championship in men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s combined fencing. Representing Harvard Crimson, Benjamin (Benji) Ungar won Gold in the 2006 Individual Men&#x27;s Épée event at the NCAA Fencing Championship, and was named Harvard Athlete of The Year. In 2020, the fencing program received more attention following a student admission scandal which involved former fencing coach Peter Brand accepting bribes to admit at least two sons of Maryland businessman Jie “Jack” Zhao into Harvard as members of the fencing team.

===Football===

The football team has competed since 1873, initially using rugby union rules through 1882. They have won ten national championships when the school competed in what is now known as the FBS. They are perhaps best known for their rivalry with Yale, known as &quot;The Game&quot;. Sixteen former players have been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame.

Harvard&#x27;s athletic rivalry with Yale is intense in every sport in which they meet, coming to a climax each fall in their annual football meeting, which dates back to 1875. While Harvard&#x27;s football team is no longer one of the country&#x27;s best as it often was a century ago during football&#x27;s early days (it won the Rose Bowl in 1920), both it and Yale have influenced the way the game is played. In 1903, Harvard Stadium introduced a new era into football with the first-ever permanent reinforced concrete stadium of its kind in the country. The stadium&#x27;s structure actually played a role in the evolution of the college game. Seeking to reduce the alarming number of deaths and serious injuries in the sport, the &quot;Father of Football&quot;, Walter Camp (former captain of the Yale football team), suggested widening the field to open up the game. But the state-of-the-art Harvard Stadium was too narrow to accommodate a wider playing surface. So, other steps had to be taken. Camp would instead support revolutionary new rules for the 1906 season. These included legalizing the forward pass, perhaps the most significant rule change in the sport&#x27;s history.

In both 1919 and 1920, headed by All-American brothers Arnold Horween and Ralph Horween, Harvard was undefeated (9–0–1, as they outscored their competition 229–19, and 8–0–1, respectively). The team won the 1920 Rose Bowl 7–6 over the University of Oregon. It was the only bowl appearance in Harvard history.

=== Golf ===
Harvard has won six national collegiate team championships: 1898 (fall), 1899, 1901, 1902 (fall), 1903, and 1904. They have crowned eight individual national champions: James Curtis (1898, fall), Halstead Lindsley (1901), Chandler Egan (1902, fall), A. L. White (1904), H. H. Wilder (1908), F. C. Davison (1912), Edward Allis (1914), J. W. Hubbell (1916). They won the inaugural Ivy League championship in 1975, their only league championship.

===Ice hockey===

====Men&#x27;s ice hockey====

The men&#x27;s ice hockey team is one of the oldest intercollegiate ice hockey teams in the United States, having played their first game on January 19, 1898 in a 0–6 loss to Brown. Former head coach William H. Claflin and former captain George Owen are credited with the first use of line change in a game against Yale on March 3, 1923 when the Crimson substituted entire forward lines instead of individuals. The men&#x27;s ice hockey team won the NCAA Division I Championship on April 1, 1989, defeating the Minnesota Golden Gophers 4–3 in overtime. The Cleary Cup, awarded to the ECAC regular-season champion, is named for former Harvard All-American hockey player, coach, and athletic director Bill Cleary, a member of the U.S. hockey team that won the 1960 Winter Olympics gold medal. The team competes in ECAC Hockey along with five other Ivy League schools and is coached by Harvard alumnus, Olympian, and former NHL forward, Ted Donato. Harvard competes in one of the most heated rivalries of college hockey at least twice each season against Harvard&#x27;s archrival, the Cornell Big Red, in installments of the Cornell–Harvard hockey rivalry. Cornell and Harvard are the most storied programs currently in the ECAC.

*1-time NCAA men&#x27;s champions: 1989
*10-time ECAC men&#x27;s champions: 1963, 1971, 1983, 1987, 1994, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2015, 2017

===Rowing===

:&quot;See footnote&quot;.
* ECAC Rowing Trophy: 2002, 2004
Older than &quot;The Game&quot; by 23 years, the Harvard–Yale Regatta was the original source of the athletic rivalry between the two schools. It is held annually in June on the Thames river in eastern Connecticut. Both the Harvard heavyweight and lightweight teams are typically considered to be among the top teams in the country in rowing, having won numerous national championships in recent years.

For a time the Harvard lightweight men&#x27;s team had one of the &quot;oddest&quot; streaks in collegiate sports, having won the national championships in every odd year from 1989 to 2003 (and in no corresponding even years). The streak was broken when Harvard lost to Yale by almost 4 seconds in 2005.

The women&#x27;s heavyweight rowing team were NCAA Champions in 2003.

The Malkin Athletic Center, known as the &quot;MAC,&quot; serves both as the university&#x27;s primary recreation facility and as home to the varsity men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s volleyball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s fencing, and wrestling teams. The five-story building includes two cardio rooms, a deep 25-yard swimming pool, a smaller pool for aquaerobics and other activities, a mezzanine, where all types of classes are held at all hours of the day, and an indoor cycling studio, three weight rooms, and a three-court gym floor to play basketball. The MAC also offers personal trainers and specialty classes. The MAC is also home to volleyball, fencing, and wrestling. The offices of several of the school&#x27;s varsity coaches are also in the MAC.

Weld Boathouse and Newell Boathouse house the women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s rowing teams, respectively. The men&#x27;s heavyweight team also uses the Red Top complex in Ledyard, CT, as their training camp for the annual Harvard–Yale Regatta. The Bright Hockey Center hosts the ice hockey teams, and the Murr Center serves both as a home for the squash and tennis teams as well as a strength and conditioning center for all athletic sports.

Other facilities include: Joseph J. O&#x27;Donnell Field (baseball), Harvard Stadium (football), Cumnock Turf and Harvard Stadium (lacrosse), Jordan Field and Ohiri Field (soccer), Blodgett Pool, Olympic-size (swimming and diving, water polo), and Roberto A. Mignone Field (rugby).

<text>The American Baptist Association (ABA) is a Landmark Baptist Christian association in the United States, with offices, book store and publishing house in Texarkana, Texas. One of the principal founders was Ben M. Bogard, a pastor of Antioch Missionary Baptist Church in Little Rock, Arkansas.
==History==
In the 1850s, conservative Baptist preachers spoke out against the tide of progressive, liberal theology and the practice of some Baptist churches in accepting pedobaptism and pulpit affiliation with other denominations. Missionary T.P. Crawford wrote the booklet &quot;Churches to the Front&quot;, a call for Baptists to return to scriptural church practices of mission work. J.R. Graves, a prominent Southern Baptist theologian, began writing articles on &quot;returning to the ancient landmarks&quot; in his Tennessee newspaper. It was a call for Southern Baptists to return to Biblical ecclesiology. Graves preached that the ancient view of Baptists was that there was not an invisible, universal church of all the saved. Only local churches had authority to baptize, to administer communion, to send missionaries, and to ordain ministers. The Landmark Baptists called for the Convention to give back the authority to local churches in mission work by rejecting the board system and adopting local church sponsored mission work.

At the beginning of the twentieth century, a large portion of Southern Baptists still held to Landmark doctrine such as local church autonomy, rejection of alien baptism, and the practice of restricting the ordinance of communion to the members of the local church. These doctrines were debated and argued between fundamental and progressive Baptists. However, one main point of contention was that of what was termed &quot;Gospel Missions.&quot; Gospel Missions referred to the practice of mission work being done directly through the authority of a local church rather than through the authority of a mission board system. In 1859, there was a push in the Southern Baptist Convention to do away with the Foreign Mission Board. Then, in 1892, T.P. Crawford, a Baptist missionary to China penned the book, Churches to the Front, in which he criticized the board system as an encroachment upon the authority of the local church&#x27;s commission to carry out mission work. The Gospel Mission movement, which held the board system accountable to Biblical principles, was a significant catalyst in the split between Landmark churches and Convention churches.

The term Landmarkism has its roots in Proverbs 22:28, &quot;Remove not the ancient landmark, which thy fathers have set.&quot; Many Baptist churches of that day were succumbing to the ecumenical movement of Protestant denominations. During the period of the Second Great Awakening, a revival of unprecedented proportions swept through America, and many unchurched people were saved. This revival swelled the ranks of all denominations, and Baptist preachers saw that the gospel of salvation by grace was being preached in churches who had previously taught that works and sacraments were required to enter heaven. Some Baptist pastors opened their doors to these people, accepting baptism from Protestant churches. Some even accepted those who had been baptized as infants. This open-door policy of ecumenicity continued to permeate the Baptist ranks. Methodists, Church of Christ, and preachers from many other denominations were preaching in Baptist pulpits. Landmark Baptist preachers began earnestly speaking out against the practices of ecumenism and the board system of missionary work, stating that these practices violated the sovereignty of church authority and Biblical doctrine. Three &quot;Landmarks&quot; were emphasized:

1. Church succession of an unbroken lineage of authority and doctrine from the time of the founding of the first church by Jesus Christ when He called the disciples in Galilee to the present age.

2. The local, visible assembly of saved, baptized believer, covenanted together to carry out the work of the Lord is the only type of church. There is no universal body of believers, and scriptural authority is only given to local bodies, each congregation being recognized as the body of Christ.

3. Baptism, administered by scriptural authority (a local church) to a scriptural candidate (a person professing faith in Christ) by a scriptural mode (immersion in water). This ruled out pedobaptism, sprinkling, and any baptism administered by a denomination or congregation that is not of like faith and practice.

These Baptist distinctives became a test of fellowship not only between Baptists and other denominations, but also among the Baptist ranks. Landmark Missionary Baptists began to see that the ever growing bureaucracy of the mission board system was extra-biblical in its practice and, like the ancient Roman hierarchy of centuries past, began to exert authority over local churches. At the end of the nineteenth century, many of these churches left the convention Baptists and continued to do mission work on a local level, through individual churches and local associations of churches.

Pioneers in the Landmark Baptists included the preachers Ben M. Bogard (March 9, 1868 – May 29, 1951) and Doss Nathan Jackson (July 14, 1895 – November 29, 1968). These two men were instrumental in their state associations of Arkansas and Texas, respectively. The Baptist Missionary Association of Texas was begun in 1900 as a way for sound, Landmark Baptist churches to conduct mission work on a state level away from what was seen as the corruption of the convention board system. This was followed by a departure of the Baptist churches in Arkansas from the convention and founding of the Arkansas Baptist State Association in 1902. In the year 1905, a nationwide association of Landmark Missionary Baptists was formed. It was called the General Association of Baptist Churches. In 1924, the Baptist Missionary Association of Texas joined this association, and the named was changed to the American Baptist Association.

The first interstate missionaries of the General Association (later the ABA) were sent out in 1905. They were J.A. Scarboro, ministering in Summit, GA, and C.R. Powell who was a missionary in Jacksonville, TX. The first foreign missionaries were I.N. Yohannon, a Jewish missionary to the Jews in Urmia, Persia (present-day Iran); S.M. Jureidini serving in Beirut, Syria; Jennie Edwards serving in Cuba; M.M. Munger, missionary to Mexico, and the following missionaries to the country of China: M.F. Crawford, W.D. King, T.J. League, Charles Tedder, Blanch Rose Walker, D.W. Herring, Alice Herring, L.M. Dawes, J.V. Dawes, G.P. Bostick, T.L. Blalock and Wade Bostick. Po-Chow, An Hwei, Taian Fu and Chining Chow were also supported as national missionaries in China.

According to reported statistics, the American Baptist Association of landmark missionary Baptist churches grew substantially, despite a split with the Baptist Missionary Association of Texas in 1950. In 1935 there were a reported 1,734 preachers, 2,662 churches with a total of 263,484 members. Thirty years later, in 1965 these numbers had grown to 3,150 preachers, 3,227 churches and 726,112 members. The American Baptist Association reached its height of growth in 1980, when they reported an estimated total of 5,700 preachers, 5,000 churches and 1,500,000 total church members. In the 1980s and 1990s these numbers began to drop dramatically, with many churches leaving the association to fellowship with convention churches or independent Baptists. Many other rural churches closed their doors as both population and interest in church declined in the scattered areas where these rural churches existed. By 2009, the American Baptist Association reported that there were 1,700 preachers among 1,600 churches with a total attendance of 100,000 members (Melton). The current numbers represent a remnant of only seven percent of the peak of the association. In 2017, the ABA had 44 interstate missionaries, 36 foreign missionaries, 71 national missionaries, and 10 missionary helpers. In addition, there are many other missionaries sent out by local ABA churches who do not report statistics through the associational mission office.

In 1950, The American Baptist Association annual meeting convened in Lakeland, FL. That year, a growing rift among the churches concerning church representation by proxy messenger, among other issues, resulted in hundreds of messengers walking out. Those messengers met together in Little Rock, Arkansas and formed the North American Baptist Association, now known as the Baptist Missionary Association of America. By 1968, The BMAA reported 3,000 preachers, 1,550 churches with a combined membership of approximately 200,000. According to their website, the association now has 1,300 churches with a membership of 230,000. They support 36 American international missionaries, 29 North American church planters, 680 national missionaries, and 200 support workers. Their main offices are in Conway, Arkansas. Several of the churches that split from the American Baptist Association in 1950 joined to create the Interstate &amp; Foreign Landmark Missionary Baptists Association – commonly referred to as &quot;Faithway Baptists&quot;, after the name of their Sunday school literature ministry.
==Geographical distribution==
In 2009, the American Baptist Association reported 1,600 congregations and 100,000 members. The largest number of associated churches are in Arkansas, Florida, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Texas and on the west coast, with churches also in most of the United States. The association also has a presence in several countries outside the United States, most notably Mexico and the Philippine Islands. In 2019, churches from 45 states and 25 countries around the world associated with the American Baptist Association.

==Racial segregation &amp; integration==
In the 1960s, the American Baptist Association strongly opposed integration of the races. Described as a hard-core segregationist group, in 1965 church leader James Berry stated &quot;Christian civilization for 1900 years prior to this century held that segregation of the races in social, religious, and marital life is a divine command.&quot; Dr. Albert Garner, former president of the association and president of the Florida Baptist Institute and Seminary told president John F. Kennedy that &quot;we have deep moral and religious convictions that integration of the races is morally wrong and should be resisted.

However there continued to be disagreement between churches associating within the ABA over racial integration throughout the years to come. Doctor Joe M. Morell served as the President of the 91st Annual Session of the American Baptist Association. During this session on June 21, 2016, Dr. Morell presented the President&#x27;s Address titled &quot;Reconcile.&quot; Following this address, Dr. Morell offered a hand of reconciliation to the McClung Family and Clark family for historic prejudices in acknowledgement as well as remorse for past convictions. The Messenger Body of the 91st Annual Session of the American Baptist Association stood in agreement of this action.
This action intended to acknowledge former hurt while indicating that those in attendance did not hold the same convictions or beliefs as earlier segregationists, welcoming the integration of all ethnicities.
Dr. Morell stated &quot;Someone has said, perhaps the most striking insight from Scripture that hits home is this: When Jesus refers to the &#x27;nations&#x27; (ethnos), He is not speaking of countries whose borders change with the fickleness of the next war, but rather he is referring to groupings of people which the nation is not determined by political boundaries, but by the language and culture. Jesus says, &#x27;GO to all of them...barring none!&#x27;&quot; 

== Doctrine ==
The American Baptist Association hold no official authority over any associating churches. According to their website, &quot;The American Baptist Association is a worldwide group of independent Baptist churches voluntarily associating in their efforts to fulfill the Great Commission. Its organization is designed to be minimal to ensure the complete independence and equal representation of every church in the association.&quot; Churches of the American Baptist Association practice a congregational form of church government, with each local church body autonomous and independent of any other ecclesiastical authority.

A key doctrinal position of the churches of the American Baptist Association that sets them apart from many other Baptist groups is the practice of closed communion, also known as &quot;Restricted Lord&#x27;s Supper,&quot; in which the ordinance of communion is restricted to members of the local church body observing the ordinance. This practice precludes both non-believers and non-members from partaking in the ordinance. Closed communion is closely linked with church discipline as found in 1 Corinthians 5:11. The American Baptist Association does not ordain women.

== Schools ==
There are several seminaries, Bible institutes and colleges associated with the American Baptist Association. Many of these schools are recognized by the American Baptist Association&#x27;s accrediting body, the American Baptist Association of Theological Schools, (ABATS).

<text>Anita Mui Yim-fong (; 10 October 1963 – 30 December 2003) was a Hong Kong singer and actress who made major contributions to the Cantopop music scene and received numerous awards and honours. She remained an idol throughout her career, and is regarded as a Cantopop diva. She was dubbed as the &quot;daughter of Hong Kong&quot; and is considered one of the most iconic Cantopop singers.

Mui once held a sold-out concert in Hammersmith, London, England, where she was dubbed the &quot;Madonna of the East&quot; (), which brought her to further international fame. That title stayed with her throughout her career, in both Eastern and Western media.

In the 1980s, the gangtai style of music was revolutionised by Mui&#x27;s wild dancing and on-stage femininity. She was famed for her outrageous costumes and high-powered performances in tandem with contralto vocals, which are rare in female artists. Her 1985 album, &quot;Bad Girl&quot;, sold over 400,000 copies in Hong Kong and remains the highest-selling album of all time in the territory.

Her fan base reached far beyond Hong Kong into many parts of Asia, including Taiwan, mainland China, Singapore, Korea, Japan and Malaysia. In the Hong Kong entertainment industry, where stars often rise and fall quickly, Mui consistently remained in the spotlight for 21 years (1982–2003). Her career came to an abrupt end in 2003 when she announced she had cervical cancer. She died later that year at the age of 40; her sister, Ann Mui, died three years earlier, at the same age from the same disease.

==Life and career==

===1963–1978: Childhood and adolescence===
Mui was born at Fa Yuen Street in Mong Kok, Kowloon, in October 1963. She is the youngest daughter in a family of four children, and the only one of the four born in Hong Kong, as her siblings were born in China. Her mother Mui Tam Mei-kam was born at Xiguan in Guangzhou. She was a Chinese medicine practitioner, who opened Yuet Wah Chinese Medical Clinic, Wah Geong Chinese and Western Music College, and a music brand in Hong Kong. Her siblings are Mui Kai-Ming, Mui Tak-Ming and singer Ann Mui, The children were raised in a single parent family. Mui&#x27;s father died when she was very young. In some of her interviews, Mui mentioned that she had little memory of her father and that her family was impoverished. This meant that she had to help provide for her siblings at an early age, dropping out of school at the age of 13 or 14. More hardship followed the family when the bar that her mother ran was destroyed by a fire. To earn a living, Mui entered the show business around the age of four with her sister Ann. She performed Chinese operas and pop songs in theatres, amusement parks and on the streets. Both Mui and her elder sister Ann performed in practically any nightclub that offered them a chance to make a living.

At the age of 15, due to the frequency of performances at different venues (up to six venues per day) that she had, her voice was affected due to the development of nodules on her vocal cords. Following the advice of the doctor, she took a year off and to keep herself occupied, she attended art lessons with her cousin. After a year, she started performing again despite the change in her vocal range, which lowered her voice by an octave.

===1982–1989; 1994–2003: Singing and acting===
In 1982, as encouraged by her sister, Mui competed in the first New Talent Singing Awards. There, Mui got a big break by emerging champion with the song &quot;The Windy Season&quot; (風的季節), originally sung by Paula Tsui, beating over 3,000 contestants. Despite her title as &quot;new talent&quot; at that time, she had already been a singer for more than 10 years from street and club performances during her childhood.

As a reward for winning the New Talent contest at the time, Mui&#x27;s first album was released with the local record company Capital Artists.

Her debut album, &quot;Debt Heart&quot; (), drew a lukewarm response from the audience. However, her subsequent albums, &quot;Red&quot; () (1983) and &quot;Leaping in the Spotlight&quot; () (1984) fared much better, as she developed her personal style and image, with guidance and support from fashion designer Eddie Lau. In 1983 and 1984, she won the RTHK Top 10 Gold Songs awards back to back.

Her winning streak continued as she won another major award in 1985, her first top 10 Jade Solid Gold Best Female Singer award. Thereafter, she won the award every year until 1989. She was awarded the Gold Songs Gold Awards () in 1989 for the ballad &quot;Song of the Sunset&quot; (), which became one of her signature songs throughout her career.
Mui released 50 albums in total. Her best-selling album was the 1985 &quot;Bad Girl&quot; (), which sold over 400,000 copies in a week (platinum 8x by Hong Kong&#x27;s standards) and broke the selling record in Hong Kong. In 1994, she sold over 10 million albums. She was the first female singer in Hong Kong to achieve such sales result. 

In terms of live performances, in 1985, at the age of 21, her first concert was held lasting 15 nights (thus being one of the youngest singers to hold a concert at the Hong Kong Coliseum). Beginning in late 1987, a series of 28 consecutive concerts at the Coliseum was held through early 1988. This established a record at the time and dubbed Mui the title of &quot;Ever Changing Anita Mui&quot; (), which had become her trademark. Her popularity was also gaining prominence outside of Hong Kong, as she was invited to sing at the 1988 Summer Olympics opening ceremony in Seoul together with Janet Jackson as well as also performing her own solo with one of her hit songs of that year, &quot;Blazing Red Lips (烈燄紅唇)&quot;. She performed in 300 concerts in her career. In 16 April 1992, CNN compared her singing career with stars like Diana Ross and Madonna.

On February 12, 1994, Mui was invited to hold a concert at the MGM Grand Garden Arena which is located on the Las Vegas Strip in Paradise, Nevada. The venue opened on December 31, 1993, with a concert by Barbra Streisand, and subsequent concerts by Luther Vandross, Anita Mui and Janet Jackson. In 1995, Mui performed the song &quot;Bad Girl&quot; (a Cantonese cover of Sheena Easton&#x27;s &quot;Strut&quot;) in Guangzhou, China, where it was banned, as it was considered pornographic in nature. The government authorities in Guangzhou were infuriated when she chose to sing the song on the last day of her concert.

In 1990, during her birthday celebration with her fan club, Mui announced that she would put an end to receiving music awards to give a chance to newcomers. She held farewell concerts for 33 consecutive nights before retiring from the stage. At the age of 28, she stepped down from the industry, only to return from retirement in 1994. Mui mentored several Hong Kong newcomer singers who have since become successful, most notably Andy Hui, Denise Ho, Edmond Leung, the band Grasshopper, and Patrick Tam.

In 1998, aged 35, she was awarded the RTHK Golden Needle Award, being one of the youngest recipients to receive the award as a lifetime achievement.
===1983–2002: Acting===
Mui was also well known as an actress across Asia, as she starred in more than 40 films over a 20-year period. Her films were mainly of the action-thriller and martial arts variety, but she had also taken comedic and dramatic roles.

Her first acting award as a supporting actress was won at the Hong Kong Film Awards for her performance in &quot;Behind the Yellow Line&quot; (1984) alongside fellow Cantopop icon Leslie Cheung. Three years later in 1987, her performance in Stanley Kwan&#x27;s &quot;Rouge&quot;, which also starred Cheung, won her the Best Actress Award at the Golden Horse Awards, as well as at the Hong Kong Film Awards in 1989. In the same year, she starred alongside Chow Yun-fat in Tsui Hark&#x27;s &quot;A Better Tomorrow III: Love &amp; Death in Saigon&quot;, which features her iconic ballad &quot;Song of the Sunset&quot;. She also co-starred with Chow Yun-fat in the 1988 romantic comedy &quot;The Greatest Lover&quot;.

In 1990, she was cast in the titular role for &quot;Kawashima Yoshiko&quot;, a biopic of the flamboyant cross-dressing spy Yoshiko Kawashima based on the novel by Lilian Lee, who also authored the original novel and screenplay for &quot;Rouge&quot;. In 1992, she starred alongside comedy icon Stephen Chow in &quot;Justice, My Foot!&quot;, proving her calibre in the comedy genre. She also paired up with Stephen Chow in 1993 in &quot;Fight Back to School III&quot;. In the same year, she starred in &quot;The Heroic Trio&quot; with Michelle Yeoh and Maggie Cheung, and it proved to be one of her most popular action films. In 1994 and 1995, she found some international recognition by starring opposite Jackie Chan in &quot;The Legend of Drunken Master&quot; and &quot;Rumble in the Bronx&quot;. In 1996, she starred in &quot;Who&#x27;s the Woman, Who&#x27;s the Man&quot; with Leslie Cheung and Anita Yuen in a gender-bending love triangle story.

Later, in 1997, she also won another best supporting actress award at the Hong Kong Film Awards for her role in &quot;Eighteen Springs&quot;. In 2001, she starred in yet another Johnnie To comedy &quot;Wu Yen&quot; alongside Sammi Cheng and Cecilia Cheung as the lewd yet charming Emperor Qi. In 2002, she won Best Actress at the Changchun Film Festival Golden Deer Awards for Best Actress with her performance in &quot;July Rhapsody&quot;, which she starred alongside Jackie Cheung.

Mui was originally cast in Zhang Yimou&#x27;s &quot;House of Flying Daggers&quot; (2004), but she stepped away only two weeks before her death. Zhang had reserved her scenes to be shot last due to her poor health. Out of respect for Mui, Zhang did not cast another actress in the role and the character was removed from the screenplay. She received a dedication titled &quot;In Memory of Anita Mui&quot; () during the closing credits.

Throughout her career, the tabloid magazines were unforgiving. Rumours relentlessly plagued Mui, who was accused of having tattoos on her arms and plastic surgery, being addicted to drugs, suicidal behavior and being linked to the death of a triad leader in the 1980s and 1990s. Rumours of affairs with leading actors also circulated.

===1989–2003: Politics, activism, and philanthropy===

Mui attended a local Hong Kong rally publicly calling for democracy during the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests that reportedly drew in 1 million people, which led to the founding of Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China. She also performed at the 1989 Hong Kong concert for Chinese Democracy and vowed never to perform again in mainland China. Her rendition of Bloodstained Glory (血染的風采) has been praised as best among many. According to the posthumous memoirs of democracy activist Szeto Wah, Mui lent significant financial and material support to Operation Yellowbird, to help activists flee from China after the Tiananmen protests.

Mui was also actively involved in charitable projects throughout her career to give back to the community. After the Eastern China flood of 1991, she changed her mind about her boycott of mainland China and took part with other Hong Kong stars in a Beijing concert to raise funds for victims of the catastrophe.The Tibetan red-crown Shamarpa (of Kagyudpa lineage) once said &quot;She had a true heart. She was an unconventional woman and brought happiness to lots of people during her life.&quot; Her establishment of a nursing home in San Francisco, prompted the mayor of the city in 1992 to name 18 April as &quot;Anita Mui Day&quot;. In 1993, she established the &quot;Anita Mui True Heart Charity Foundation&quot; (). That same year, she was also one of the founders of the Hong Kong Performing Artistes Guild. The Canadian city of Toronto declared 23 October 1993 to be &quot;Anita Mui Day&quot;.
During the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak, she initiated a fundraising concert titled the 1:99 Concert to raise money for SARS-affected families, which attracted famous fellow celebrities such as Andy Lau and Jacky Cheung. She was also awarded the &quot;Fighting Against SARS Award&quot; from RTHK and the newspaper &quot;Ming Pao&quot;. In 2003, she wrote and published the book &quot;The Heart of the Modern Woman&quot; (). Profits from the book went to the Children&#x27;s Cancer Foundation.

== Personal life ==
In 1990, Mui began dating Benjamin Lam Kwok-bun, who was a member of the Jackie Chan Stunt Team. The relationship ended three years later. Despite rumours of her dating several men, Mui remained single for the rest of her life.

==Death and legacy==
On 5 September 2003, Mui publicly announced that she had cervical cancer, from which her sister had also died. She held a series of eight shows at the Hong Kong Coliseum from 6–11 November and 14–15 November 2003, which were to be her last concerts before her death.

Her symbolic act was to &quot;marry the stage&quot;, which was accompanied by her hit song &quot;Sunset Melody&quot; () as she exited the stage. The last song she performed on stage was &quot;Cherish When We Meet Again&quot; (), a rendition of The Manhattans&#x27; &quot;Kiss and Say Goodbye,&quot; on 15 November 2003, where she was accompanied by her friends on stage. She eventually succumbed to cervical cancer and died of respiratory complications leading to lung failure at Hong Kong Sanatorium and Hospital on 30 December 2003 at 2:50 am Hong Kong Time. She was 40 years old. Thousands of fans turned out for her funeral at North Point in January 2004. Mui was cremated and her ashes are interred at the Po Lin Monastery&#x27;s mausoleum on Lantau Island.

In 1998, an ATV-produced television series &quot;Forever Love Song&quot; told a story of a character which was loosely based on that of Mui, but the character names were purposely changed. In 2007, a television series was produced in China titled &quot;Anita Mui Fei&quot; () to tell the story of her life. The 42-episode series was broadcast by China Education Television. Some subjects, such as her suffering from cancer, Leslie Cheung&#x27;s suicide and her mother&#x27;s real estate dilemma, were avoided. Alice Chan portrayed Mui in the series.

On 23 September 2004, the Anita Mui True Heart Digital Multimedia Studio was opened at the University of Hong Kong. It included state-of-the-art equipment for digital audio and video editing. In Causeway Bay, an Anita Mui-themed cafe called Happiness Moon () is also dedicated to her legacy.

On 11 October 2008, a show on TVB, titled &quot;Our Anita Mui&quot; (), was dedicated to Mui. Many fans and off-stage personnel who worked with her had a chance to talk about their personal experiences with Mui. Singers who participated in the show included Andy Hui, Edmond Leung, and Stephanie Cheng. On 18 July 2014, a statue of Anita Mui was unveiled on Hong Kong&#x27;s Avenue of Stars.

In 2019, she was the subject of the film &quot;Dearest Anita&quot;. The film centered around individuals whose lives had been shaped by her work, including her fans and beneficiaries of her philanthropic work.

In 2021, she was portrayed in the biopic &quot;Anita&quot; (), directed by Longman Leung. She was played by the Hong Kong model Louise Wong.

Her work and stage costumes were displayed in an exhibition titled &quot;Timeless Diva: Anita Mui&quot; in the Hong Kong Heritage Museum lasting around eight months from 24th December 2023 to 2nd September 2024, commemorating the 20th anniversary of her passing. The exhibit included items from her private collection, including her TBS Award from the 1983 12th Tokyo Music Festival which was since housed in the museum, with courtesy of her former fashion designer and close friend Eddie Lau. 

=== Will ===
In her will, Mui bequeathed two properties to her fashion designer, Eddie Lau, and the remainder to the Karen Trust – a trust she had set up and looked after by HSBC International Trustees. Its beneficiaries included her mother, , and four nieces and nephews. The Karen Trust provided Tam with a life tenancy of HK$70,000 per month; upon Tam&#x27;s death, the estate would go to the New Horizon Buddhist Association ().

In 2005, Tam received a HK$705,000 lump-sum payment from the trust in May. She applied for and obtained a hardship grant to pay for medical expenditure of $50,000 in December; her application for funds from the estate to challenge the will was denied. In 2008, Mui&#x27;s estate was estimated to be worth HK$100 million. Tam Mei-kam contested the will, arguing that Mui was mentally unfit when she executed her will in 2003, weeks before her death. The High Court ruled that Mui was of sound mind when she signed the will, and that she simply did not trust her mother with money.

Over the years, Tam mounted several legal challenges to the will, and succeeded in having the life tenancy varied to HK$120,000. Tam was reportedly owing $2 million in legal costs in 2011. A fresh appeal by Tam and Mui&#x27;s elder brother Peter Mui Kai-ming failed at the Court of Final Appeal in May 2011.

After that challenge, the Court of First Instance of Hong Kong declared Tam bankrupt on 25 April 2012 for failing to pay legal fees, whilst allowing her to continue receiving her monthly allowance. In January 2013, the court ruled that the monthly tenancy of HK$120,000 to Tam, suspended since the previous July, would continue to be frozen due to mounting debts of the estate. Her brother was declared bankrupt on 17 January 2013 for failing to pay legal fees relating to the appeals. In May 2013, the court ordered the estate to pay Tam HK$20,000 a month for her living costs, as well as $240,000 to settle her overdue rent.

<doc id="321524" wikidata="Q806345" url="?curid=321524" title="Twin-lead">
<text>Twin lead cable is a two-conductor flat cable used as a balanced transmission line to carry radio frequency (RF) signals. It is constructed of two, stranded copper wires, or solid copper-clad steel wires. The wires are held a fixed distance apart by a plastic ribbon that is a good insulator at radio frequencies (usually polyethylene). It is also called (two wire) [[ribbon cable]]. The uniform spacing of the wires is the key to the cable&#x27;s function as a transmission line: Any abrupt change in spacing would cause some of the signal to reflect back toward the source, rather than passing through. The plastic also covers and insulates the wires.

The name twin lead is most often used to refer specifically to 300 Ω (Ohm) ribbon cable, the most common type, but on occasion, &quot;twin lead&quot; is used to refer to any type of parallel wire line. Parallel wire line is available with several different values of characteristic impedance such as &quot;twin lead ribbon cable&quot; (300 Ω), &quot;window line&quot; (300 Ω, 350 Ω, or 450 Ω), and &quot;open wire line&quot; or &quot;ladder line&quot; (500~650 Ω).

Twin lead is mainly used as an antenna feedline at shortwave and VHF frequencies, to connect radio receivers and transmitters to their antennas. It can have significantly lower signal loss than miniature flexible coaxial cable, the main alternative type of feedline at these frequencies; for example, type RG-58 coaxial cable loses 6.6 dB per at 30 MHz, while 300 Ω twin-lead loses only 0.55 dB.
300 Ω twin lead is widely used to connect FM radios to their antennas, and was previously used to connect television antennas to televisions until it was replaced by coaxial cable. However, it is more vulnerable to interference; proximity to metal objects will inject signals into any type of parallel wire line that would be blocked out by more convenient / more popular coaxial cable. It therefore requires spacing around rain gutters, spaced away from metal fences, exterior wall siding, and metal roofs, and mounted on standoff insulators when run up metal antenna masts.

==Characteristics and uses==

Twin lead and other types of parallel-conductor transmission line are mainly used to connect radio transmitters and receivers to their antennas. Parallel transmission line has the advantage that its losses per unit length are an order of magnitude smaller than that of coaxial cable, the main alternative form of transmission line. Its disadvantages are that it is more vulnerable to interference, and must be kept away from metal objects which can cause power losses and impedance distortion (hence back-reflected waves). For this reason, when installed along the outside of buildings and on antenna masts, standoff insulators must be used. It is also common practice to twist the twin lead on long free standing lengths to further average out any imbalance induced on the line.

Parallel-wire line (the generic sense of &quot;twin lead&quot;) is supplied in several different sizes, with values of 600 Ω, 500 Ω (ladder line), 450 Ω, 350 Ω (window line), 300 Ω (window line, ribbon cable), and 75 Ω (ribbon cable) characteristic impedance. The most common, 300 Ω twin-lead ribbon cable, was once widely used to connect television sets and FM radios to their receiving antennas. 300 Ω twin lead ribbon cable for television installations has been largely replaced with 75 Ω coaxial cable. Multiple forms of parallel wire line are used in amateur radio stations as feedline for balanced transmission of radio frequency signals, most often as 450 Ω window line, instead of twin lead ribbon cable.

The characteristic impedance of twin lead is a function of the insulating material and its thickness, and the wire diameter and its spacing; in the most common type, 300 Ω twin-lead ribbon cable, the wire is usually AWG 20 or 22 (0.52 or 0.33 mm²), about apart.
This is well matched with the natural impedance of a folded dipole antenna, which is normally around 275 Ω. Twin lead generally has higher impedance than the other common transmission wiring, coaxial cable (coax). The widely used RG-6 coax has a characteristic impedance of 75 Ω, which requires the use of a balun to match impedance when used with common antenna types.

==How it works==
Twin lead (in the specific sense of ribbon cable) is a form of parallel wire balanced transmission line. The separation between the two wires in twin-lead is small compared to the wavelength of the radio frequency (RF) signal carried on the wire. The RF current in one wire is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the RF current in the other wire. Therefore, in the far field region far from the transmission line, the radio waves radiated by one wire are equal in magnitude but opposite in phase (180° out of phase) to the waves radiated by the other wire, so the overlapping opposite waves cancel each other out. The result is that almost no net radio energy is radiated by the line.

Similarly, any interfering external radio waves will induce equal, in phase RF currents, traveling in the same direction, in the two wires, as long as they each maintain the same impedance. Since the load at the destination end is connected &quot;across&quot; the wires, nominally, only &quot;differential&quot;, oppositely-directed currents in the wires create a current in the load. Thus the interfering currents are canceled out, so twin lead does not tend to pick up radio noise.

However, if a piece of metal is located sufficiently close to a twin-lead line, within a distance comparable to the wire spacing, it will be significantly closer to one wire than the other. As a result, the RF current induced in the metal object by one wire will be greater than the opposing current induced by the other wire, so the currents will no longer cancel. Thus nearby metal objects can cause power losses in twin lead lines, through energy dissipated as heat by induced currents. Similarly, radio noise originating in cables or metal objects located near the twin-lead line can induce unbalanced currents in the wires, coupling noise into the line. Therefore, the line must be kept at a distance from metal objects such as gutters and masts.

In order to prevent power from being reflected from the load end of the line, causing high SWR and inefficiency, the load must have an impedance which matches the characteristic impedance of the line. This causes the load to appear electrically identical to a continuation of the line, preventing reflections. Similarly, to transfer power efficiently into the line, the source must also match the characteristic impedance. To connect a balanced transmission line to an unbalanced line like coaxial cable, a device called a balun must be used.

==Window line and ladder line ==
In addition to twin lead ribbon cable, two-conductor parallel wire line comes in two additional forms: window line and ladder line (a.k.a. &quot;open wire line&quot;).

=== Window line ===

Window line is a bulkier variety of parallel wire line than twin lead ribbon cable; it is similarly built to a wider size, except that the polyethylene ribbon between them holding the wires apart has regularly spaced rectangular openings (&quot;windows&quot;) cut in it.

Among the advantages to cutting &quot;windows&quot; in the ribbon is that the manufacturer can adjust the size of the cuts to make fine adjustments to the feedline&#x27;s electrical properties. The windows lighten the line, and reduce the amount of surface on which dirt and moisture can accumulate, making window line somewhat less vulnerable to weather-induced changes in its characteristic impedance. The most common type is nominal 450 Ω window line, which has a conductor spacing of about an inch (); its actual impedance may be closer to 400 Ω. It is also made in nominal 350 Ω impedance (which may actually be closer to 300 Ω).
=== Ladder line ===

Ladder line is an older, simpler form of parallel-wire line, often called open wire line. The configuration looks like a rope ladder, hence the name. It can either be purchased already made by a cable company, or home-made; the construction is easy, though tedious, and originally all radio amateurs made their own open wire line. It consists of two wires, usually either clad in a DC insulator or coated with a durable lacquer, held a constant distance apart by insulated spacers.
The &quot;ladder rung&quot; spacers can be made out of any convenient insulating material – at present, usually short pieces cut from plastic plumbing pipe – formerly either long, thin ceramic insulators or dowel stubs of water-proofed wood were used. The &quot;rungs&quot; hold the wires at constant spacing, somewhere between a constant two to apart, depending on the wire and the desired impedance. The rungs are spaced about every . Although it is important to ensure the wire separation is uniform, it doesn&#x27;t matter if distances between the rungs is erratic, as long as the separation remains nearly constant in gusts of wind. 

The ratio of chosen wire spacing to wire diameter determines the line&#x27;s characteristic impedance – usually 500~600 Ω, but also depends on the wire insulation&#x27;s relative permittivity and conductive loss in the rung insulators, if significant.
For example, for a 500 Ω line, two bare or lacquered wires should be spaced 32× the wires&#x27; individual diameters apart – about in the case of common ″ diameter wire (). If the wires are insulated, the separation may need to be a little wider, depending on the insulating plastic. To get 600 Ω parallel line, the same wires would be spaced ; 600 Ω is roughly the practical limit for transmission lines made with wire rather than thicker copper-clad steel cable, or with rigid aluminum or copper pipe.

==Impedance matching==

As a transmission line, transmission efficiency will be maximum when the impedance of the antenna, the characteristic impedance of the twin-lead line and the impedance of the equipment are the same. For this reason, when attaching a twin-lead line to a coaxial cable connection, such as the 300 Ω twin-lead from a domestic television antenna to the television&#x27;s 75 ohm coax antenna input, a balun with a 4:1 ratio is commonly used. Its purpose is double: First, it transforms twin-lead&#x27;s 300 Ω impedance to match the 75 Ω coaxial cable impedance; and second, it transforms the balanced, symmetric transmission line to the nominally unbalanced coax input. In general, when used as a feedline, twin-lead (especially ladder line versions) has a higher efficiency than coaxial cable when there is an impedance mismatch between the feedline and the source (or sink). For receive-only use this merely implies that the system can communicate under slightly less optimal conditions; for transmit use, this can often result in significantly less energy lost as heat in the transmission line.

Twin-lead also can serve as a convenient material with which to build a simple folded dipole antenna. Such antennas may be fed either by using a 300 Ω twin-lead feeder or by using a 300-to-75 Ω balun and using coaxial feedline and will usually handle moderate power loads without overheating.

==Characteristic impedance==
The characteristic impedance of a parallel-wire transmission line like twin lead or ladder line depends on its dimensions; the diameter of the wires formula_1 and their separation formula_2 This is derived below.

The characteristic impedance formula_3 of any transmission line operating at frequency formula_4 or radian frequency formula_5 is given by

formula_6

where for twin-lead line the primary line constants are

formula_7

formula_8

formula_9

formula_10

where formula_1 is the wire diameter and formula_12 is the separation of the wires measured between their centre-lines; formula_13 is the absolute permittivity between the wires; formula_14 is the absolute permeability; formula_15 is the surface conductivity between the wires; and where the surface resistance of the wires is given by

formula_16

Neglecting the wire resistance formula_17 and the leakage conductance formula_18 this gives

 \left\{\left( \tfrac{d}{\ 2\ D\ } \right)^4 \right\}\ \right] &lt;/math&gt;

formula_19}}

where formula_20 is the impedance of free space (approximately 376.74 Ω), and formula_21 is the relative permittivity (which for air is ).

When the separation formula_12 is many times greater than the wire diameter formula_1 then the function can be approximately replaced by a natural logarithm (with its argument doubled):

The exact and approximate formulas for the separation needed to achieve some given characteristic impedance formula_3 through a pair of wires are therefore

formula_25

The dielectric material between the two conductors with either twin-lead or ladder line is not &quot;all&quot; air: The effect of a &quot;mixed&quot; dielectric, part air and part polyethylene or other plastic, is that the actual impedance will fall somewhere between the value calculated assuming all air or all polyethylene. Carefully measured or published values for formula_3 will typically be more accurate than estimates from formulas.

==Antennas==
Twin-lead can be connected directly to a suitably designed antenna:

; Windom antenna: A multiply-resonant antenna whose resonant impedances cluster around .
; Folded dipole: Double-wire dipole whose characteristic impedance in free space is around .
; Dipole: Although the center impedance at resonance is approximately in free space, in actual use it varies between , depending on height above ground, so with high-impedance feedline a T-match or Y-match feed will probably be necessary.
; Yagi–Uda antenna: Yagi and the simpler Moxon antenna, and other directional antennas; some special impedance matching arrangement at the feedpoint is necessary for any cabling, since interference between the typically close-spacing of the parallel near-resonant antenna segments causes low feedpoint resistance as well as making the antenna more directional.

<text>Alcina (HWV 34) is a 1735 opera seria by George Frideric Handel. Handel used the libretto of &quot;L&#x27;isola di Alcina&quot;, an opera that was set in 1728 in Rome by Riccardo Broschi, which he acquired the year after during his travels in Italy. Partly altered for better conformity, the story was originally taken from Ludovico Ariosto&#x27;s &quot;Orlando furioso&quot; (like those of the Handel operas &quot;Orlando&quot; and &quot;Ariodante&quot;), an epic poem. The opera contains several musical sequences with opportunity for dance: these were composed for dancer Marie Sallé.

==Performance history==
&quot;Alcina&quot; was composed for Handel&#x27;s first season at the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden in London. It premiered on 16 April 1735. Like the composer&#x27;s other works in the opera seria genre, &quot;Alcina&quot; fell into obscurity; after a revival in Brunswick in 1738 it was not performed again until a production in Leipzig in 1928.

The Australian soprano Joan Sutherland sang the role in a production by Franco Zeffirelli in which she made her debut at La Fenice in February 1960 and at the Dallas Opera in November of that year. She performed in the same production at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, in 1962. Since then &quot;Alcina&quot; has been performed on many of the world&#x27;s stages. A major production was the one directed by Robert Carsen and originally staged for the Opéra de Paris in 1999 and repeated at the Lyric Opera of Chicago. Both stagings featured Renée Fleming in the title role.

The opera was given a concert performance on 10 October 2014 at the Barbican Centre in London. Joyce DiDonato sang the title role under Harry Bicket with The English Concert. Alice Coote, Christine Rice and Anna Christy sang other significant roles. The group toured to the European continent with performances in Pamplona, Madrid, Vienna, and Paris and then to Carnegie Hall in New York on 26 October. &quot;Alcina&quot; received a fully staged production during the 2017 Santa Fe Opera season with Elza van den Heever in the title role. Among many other performances worldwide, the opera was staged by the Salzburg Festival in 2019, with Cecilia Bartoli in the title role.
==Roles==
==Synopsis==

===Prologue===
The background of the opera comes from the poem &quot;Orlando Furioso.&quot; The heroic knight Ruggiero is destined to a short but glorious life, and a benevolent magician is always whisking him away from the arms of his fiancée, Bradamante. Bradamante is not the type to put up with the constant disappearance of her lover, and she spends vast portions of the poem in full armor chasing after him. Just before the opera begins she has rescued him from an enchanted castle, only to have her flying horse (a hippogriff) take a fancy to Ruggiero and fly off with him. Ruggiero and the hippogriff land on an island in the middle of the ocean. As the hippogriff begins to eat the leaves of a myrtle bush, Ruggiero is startled to hear the bush begin to speak. The bush reveals that it was once a living soul named Sir Astolfo, and the island belongs to the sister sorceresses Alcina and Morgana. The beautiful Alcina seduces every knight that lands on her isle, but soon tires of her lovers and changes them into stones, animals, plants, or anything that strikes her fancy. Despite Astolfo&#x27;s warning, Ruggiero strides off to meet this sorceress – and falls under her spell.

===Act 1===
Bradamante, again searching for her lover, arrives on Alcina&#x27;s island with Ruggiero&#x27;s former tutor, Melisso. Dressed in armor, Bradamante looks like a young man and goes by the name of her own brother, Ricciardo. She and Melisso possess a magic ring which enables the wearer to see through illusion, which they plan to use to break Alcina&#x27;s spells and release her captives.

The first person they meet is the sorceress Morgana. Barely human and with no understanding of true love, she immediately abandons her own lover Oronte for the handsome &#x27;Ricciardo.&#x27; Morgana conveys the visitors to Alcina&#x27;s court, where Bradamante is dismayed to discover that Ruggiero is besotted with Alcina and in a state of complete amnesia about his previous life. Also at Alcina&#x27;s court is a boy, Oberto, who is looking for his father, Astolfo, who was last seen heading toward this island. Bradamante guesses that Astolfo is now transformed into something, but she holds her peace and concerns herself with Ruggiero. Bradamante and Melisso rebuke Ruggiero for his desertion, but he can&#x27;t think of anything except Alcina.

Meanwhile, Oronte discovers that Morgana has fallen in love with &#x27;Ricciardo,&#x27; and challenges &#x27;him&#x27; to a duel. Morgana stops the fight, but Oronte is in a foul mood and takes it out on Ruggiero. He tells the young man exactly how Alcina treats her former lovers and adds that, as far as he can tell, Alcina has fallen in love with the newcomer, Ricciardo (&quot;Semplicetto! A donna credi?&quot; Nr. 12). Ruggiero is horrified and overwhelms Alcina with his jealous fury. Things get even worse when &#x27;Ricciardo&#x27; enters and pretends to admire Alcina. Alcina calms Ruggiero (&quot;Sì, son quella&quot; Nr. 13), but Bradamante is so upset at seeing her fiancé wooed before her very eyes that she reveals her true identity to Ruggiero (&quot;La bocca vaga, quell&#x27;occhio nero&quot; Nr. 14). Melisso hastily contradicts her and Ruggiero becomes very confused.
Alcina tells Morgana that she plans to turn Ricciardo into an animal, just to show Ruggiero how much she really loves him. Morgana begs Ricciardo to escape the island and Alcina&#x27;s clutches, but &#x27;he&#x27; says he&#x27;d rather stay, as he loves another. Morgana believes that this other person is herself, and the act ends with Morgana&#x27;s aria &quot;&quot;. (In some productions, this aria is sung by Alcina.)

===Act 2===
Melisso recalls Ruggiero to reason and duty by letting him wear the magic ring: under its influence, Ruggiero sees the island as it really is—a desert, peopled with monsters. Appalled, he realizes he must leave, and sings the famous aria &quot;Verdi prati&quot; (&quot;Green meadows&quot;) where he admits that even though he knows the island and Alcina are mere illusion, their beauty will haunt him for the rest of his life.

Melisso warns Ruggiero that he cannot just leave; Alcina still wields immense power, and he should cover his escape by telling her that he wishes to go hunting. Ruggiero agrees, but, thoroughly bewildered by the magic and illusion surrounding him, he refuses to believe his eyes when he at last sees Bradamante as herself, believing that she may be another of Alcina&#x27;s illusions. Bradamante is in despair, as is Alcina. Convinced of Ruggiero&#x27;s indifference, she enters to turn Ricciardo into an animal, and Ruggiero has to pull himself together quickly and convince the sorceress that he does not need any proof of her love. It is at this point that the audience realises that Alcina genuinely loves Ruggiero; from now until the end of the opera, she is depicted sympathetically.
Oronte realizes that Ricciardo, Melisso and Ruggiero are in some sort of alliance, and Morgana and Alcina realise they are being deceived. But it is too late: Alcina&#x27;s powers depend on illusion and, as true love enters her life, her magic powers slip away. As the act ends, Alcina tries to call up evil spirits to stop Ruggiero from leaving her, but her magic fails her.

===Act 3===
After this the opera finishes swiftly. Morgana and Oronte try to rebuild their relationship; she returns to him and he rebuffs her but (once she is offstage) admits he loves her
still. Ruggiero returns to his proper heroic status and sings an aria accompanied by high horns; Oberto is introduced to a lion, to whom he feels strangely attached, and Alcina sings a desolate aria in which she longs for oblivion.

Bradamante and Ruggiero decide that they need to destroy the source of Alcina&#x27;s magic, usually represented as an urn. Alcina pleads with them, but Ruggiero is deaf to her appeals and smashes the urn. As he does so, everything is both ruined and restored. Alcina&#x27;s magic palace crumbles to dust and she and Morgana sink into the ground, but Alcina&#x27;s lovers are returned to their proper selves. The lion turns into Oberto&#x27;s father, Astolfo, and other people stumble on, &quot;I was a rock,&quot; says one, &quot;I a tree&quot; says another, and &quot;I a wave in the ocean...&quot; All the humans sing of their relief and joy, and Alcina is forgotten.

<doc id="321527" wikidata="Q1241055" url="?curid=321527" title="Market impact">
<text>In financial markets, market impact is the effect that a market participant has when it buys or sells an asset. It is the extent to which the buying or selling moves the price against the buyer or seller, i.e., upward when buying and downward when selling. It is closely related to market liquidity; in many cases &quot;liquidity&quot; and &quot;market impact&quot; are synonymous.

Especially for large investors, e.g., financial institutions, market impact is a key consideration before any decision to move money within or between financial markets. If the amount of money being moved is large (relative to the turnover of the asset(s) in question), then the market impact can be several percentage points and needs to be assessed alongside other transaction costs (costs of buying and selling).

Market impact can arise because the price needs to move to tempt other investors to buy or sell assets (as counterparties), but also because professional investors may position themselves to profit from knowledge that a large investor (or group of investors) is active one way or the other. Some financial intermediaries have such low transaction costs that they can profit from price movements that are too small to be of relevance to the majority of investors.

The financial institution that is seeking to manage its market impact needs to limit the pace of its activity (e.g., keeping its activity below one-third of daily turnover) so as to avoid disrupting the price.

==Market impact cost==
Market impact cost is a measure of market liquidity that reflects the cost faced by a trader of an index or security. The market impact cost is measured in the chosen numeraire of the market, and is how much additionally a trader must pay over the initial price due to market slippage, i.e. the cost incurred because the transaction itself changed the price of the asset. Market impact costs are a type of transaction costs.

== Measuring market impact ==
Several statistical measures exist. One of the most common is Kyle&#x27;s Lambda, estimated as the coefficient formula_1 from regressing price changes formula_2 on trade size formula_3 over some time window.

: formula_4

For very short periods, this reduces to simply

: formula_5

Volume is typically measured as turnover or the volume of shares traded. Under this measure, a highly liquid stock is one that experiences a small price change for a given level of trading volume.

Kyle&#x27;s lambda is named from Pete Kyle&#x27;s famous paper on market microstructure.

== Unique challenges for microcap traders ==

Microcap (and nanocap) stocks are characterized by a market cap under $300mn ($50mn) relatively limited public float and small daily volume. As a result, these stocks are extremely volatile and susceptible to large price swings. 

Microcap and nanocap traders often trade in and out of positions with huge blocks of shares to make quick money on speculative events. And therein lies a problem that many microcap and nanocap traders face—with so little float available, thin volume and large block orders, there is a shortage of shares. In many instances orders only get partially filled.

== Example ==

Suppose an institutional investor places a limit order to sell 1 million shares of stock XYZ at $10.00 per share. A professional investor may see this limit order being placed, and place an order of their own to short sell 1 million shares of XYZ at $9.99 per share.

* Stock XYZ rises in price to $9.99 and keeps going up past $10.00. The professional investor sells at $9.99 and covers his short position by buying from the institutional investor. His loss is limited to $0.01 per share.
* Stock XYZ rises in price to $9.99 and then comes back down. The professional investor sells at $9.99 and covers his short position when the stock declines. The professional investor can gain $.10 or more per share with very little risk. The institutional investor is unhappy, because he saw the market price rise to $9.99 and come back down, without his order getting filled.

Effectively, the institutional investor&#x27;s large order has given an option to the professional investor. Institutional investors don&#x27;t like this, because either the stock price rises to $9.99 and comes back down, without them having the opportunity to sell, or the stock price rises to $10.00 and keeps going up, meaning the institutional investor could have sold at a higher price.

<doc id="321528" wikidata="Q33262" url="?curid=321528" title="Chamorro language">
<text>Chamorro (, ; [Northern Mariana Islands] or [Guam] ) is an Austronesian language spoken by about 58,000 people, numbering about 25,800 on Guam and about 32,200 in the Northern Mariana Islands and elsewhere. 

It is the historic native language of the Chamorro people, who are indigenous to the Mariana Islands, although it is less commonly spoken today than in the past. Chamorro has three distinct dialects: Guamanian, Rotanese, and that in the other Northern Mariana Islands (NMI).

==Classification==
Unlike most of its neighbors, Chamorro is not classified as a Micronesian or Polynesian language. Rather, like Palauan, it possibly constitutes an independent branch of the Malayo-Polynesian language family.

At the time the Spanish rule over Guam ended, it was thought that Chamorro was a semi-creole language, with a substantial amount of the vocabulary of Spanish origin and beginning to have a high level of mutual intelligibility with Spanish. It is reported that even in the early 1920s, Spanish was reported to be a living language in Guam for commercial transactions, but the use of Spanish and Chamorro was rapidly declining as a result of English pressure.

Spanish influences in Chamorro exist due to three centuries of Spanish colonial rule. Many words in the Chamorro lexicon are of Latin etymological origin via Spanish, but the pronunciation of these loanwords has been nativized to the phonology of Chamorro, and their use conforms to indigenous grammatical structures. Some authors consider Chamorro a mixed language under a historical point of view, even though it remains independent and unique. In his &quot;Chamorro Reference Grammar&quot;, Donald M. Topping states:

&quot;The most notable influence on Chamorro language and culture came from the Spanish... There was wholesale borrowing of Spanish words and phrases into Chamorro, and there was even some borrowing from the Spanish sound system. But this borrowing was linguistically superficial. The bones of the Chamorro language remained intact... In virtually all cases of borrowing, Spanish words were forced to conform to the Chamorro sound system... While Spanish may have left a lasting mark on Chamorro vocabulary, as it did on many Philippine and South American languages, it had virtually no effect on Chamorro grammar... The Japanese influence on Chamorro was much greater than that of German but much less than Spanish. Once again, the linguistic influence was restricted exclusively to vocabulary items, many of which refer to manufactured objects...&quot;

In contrast, in the essays found in (2009), Rafael Rodríguez-Ponga refers to modern Chamorro as a &quot;mixed language&quot; of &quot;Hispanic-Austronesian&quot; origins and estimates that approximately 50% of the Chamorro lexicon comes from Spanish, whose contribution goes far beyond loanwords.

Rodríguez-Ponga (1995) considers Chamorro to be either Spanish-Austronesian or a Spanish-Austronesian mixed language, or at least a language that has emerged from a process of contact and &quot;creolization&quot; on the island of Guam since modern Chamorro is influenced in vocabulary and has in its grammar many elements of Spanish origin: verbs, articles, prepositions, numerals, conjunctions, etc.

The process, which began in the 17th century and ended in the early 20th century, meant a profound change from the old Chamorro (paleo-Chamorro) to modern Chamorro (neo-Chamorro) in its grammar, phonology, and vocabulary.

==Speakers==

The Chamorro language is threatened, with a precipitous drop in language fluency over the past century. It is estimated that 75% of the population of Guam was literate in the Chamorro language around the time the United States captured the island during the Spanish–American War (there are no similar language fluency estimates for other areas of the Mariana Islands during this time). A century later, the 2000 U.S. Census showed that fewer than 20% of Chamorros living in Guam speak their heritage language fluently, and the vast majority of those were over the age of 55.

A number of forces have contributed to the steep, post-World War II decline of Chamorro language fluency. There is a long history of colonization of the Marianas, beginning with the Spanish colonization in 1668 and, eventually, the American acquisition of Guam in 1898 (whose hegemony continues to this day). This imposed power structures privileging the language of the region&#x27;s colonizers. According to estimates, a large majority, as stated above (75%), maintained active knowledge of the Chamorro language even during the Spanish colonial era, but this was all to change with the advent of American imperialism and enforcement of the English language.

In Guam, the language suffered additional suppression when the U.S. government banned the Chamorro language in schools and workplaces in 1922, destroying all Chamorro dictionaries. Similar policies were undertaken by the Japanese government when they controlled the region during World War II. After the war, when Guam was recaptured by the United States, American administrators of the island continued to impose &quot;no Chamorro&quot; restrictions in local schools, teaching only English and disciplining students for speaking their indigenous tongue.

While these oppressive language policies were progressively lifted, Chamorro usage had substantially decreased. Subsequent generations were often raised in households where only the oldest family members were fluent. Lack of exposure made it increasingly difficult to pick up Chamorro as a second language. Within a few generations, English replaced Chamorro as the language of daily life.

There is a difference in the rate of Chamorro language fluency between Guam and the rest of the Marianas. On Guam the number of native Chamorro speakers has dwindled since the mid-1990s. In the Northern Mariana Islands (NMI), younger Chamorros speak the language fluently but prefer English when speaking to their children. Chamorro is common in Chamorro households in the Northern Marianas, but fluency has greatly decreased among Guamanian Chamorros during the years of American rule in favor of the American English commonplace throughout the Marianas.

Today, NMI Chamorros and Guamanian Chamorros disagree strongly on each other&#x27;s linguistic fluency. An NMI Chamorro would say Guamanian Chamorros speak &quot;broken&quot; Chamorro (i.e., incorrect), whereas a Guamanian Chamorro might consider the form used by NMI Chamorros to be archaic.

== Revitalization efforts ==
Representatives from Guam have unsuccessfully lobbied the United States to take action to promote and protect the language.

In 2013, &quot;Guam will be instituting Public Law 31–45, which increases the teaching of the Chamorro language and culture in Guam schools&quot;, extending instruction to include grades 7–10.

Other efforts have been made in recent times, most notably Chamorro immersion schools. One example is Huråo Guåhan Academy at Chamorro Village in downtown Hagåtña. This program is led by Ann Marie Arceo and her husband, Ray. According to the academy&#x27;s official YouTube page, &quot;Huråo Academy is one if not the first Chamoru Immersion Schools that focus on the teaching of Chamoru language and Self-identity on Guam. Huråo was founded as a non-profit in June 2005.&quot; The academy has been praised by many for the continuity of the Chamoru language.

Other creative ways to incorporate and promote the Chamorro language have been found in the use of applications for smartphones, internet videos and television. From Chamorro dictionaries, to the most recent &quot;Speak Chamorro&quot; app, efforts are growing and expanding in ways to preserve and protect the Chamorro language and identity.

On YouTube, a popular Chamorro soap opera &quot;Siha&quot; has received mostly positive feedback from native Chamorro speakers on its ability to weave dramatics, the Chamorro language, and island culture into an entertaining program. On TV, &quot;Nihi! Kids&quot; is a first-of-its-kind show, because it is targeted &quot;for Guam&#x27;s nenis that aims to perpetuate Chamoru language and culture while encouraging environmental stewardship, healthy choices and character development.&quot;

In 2019, local news station KUAM News began a series of videos on their YouTube channel, featuring University of Guam&#x27;s Dr. Michael Bevacqua.

==Phonology==
Chamorro has 24 phonemes: 18 are consonants and six are vowels.

===Vowels===
Chamorro has at least 6 vowels, which include: 
* , open back unrounded vowel equivalent to the &quot;a&quot; in &quot;father&quot;. 
* , near-open front unrounded vowel equivalent to the &quot;a&quot; in &quot;cat&quot;. 
* , close-mid front unrounded vowel equivalent to the &quot;e&quot; in the Received Pronunciation of &quot;met&quot;. 
* , close front unrounded vowel equivalent to the &quot;ee&quot; in &quot;sleep&quot;. 
* , close-mid back unrounded vowel equivalent to the &quot;o&quot; in &quot;corn&quot;.
* , close back rounded vowel equivalent to the &quot;u&quot; in &quot;flu&quot;.
===Consonants===
Below is a chart of Chamorro consonants; all are unaspirated.

* does not occur initially.
* Affricates can be realized as palatal before non-low front vowels.

=== Historical phonology ===
Words containing &quot;*-VC_CV-&quot; in Proto-Malayo-Polynesian were often syncopated to &quot;*-VCCV-&quot;. This is most regular for words containing middle &quot;*ə&quot; (schwa), e.g. &quot;*qaləjaw&quot; → &quot;atdaw&quot; &quot;sun&quot;, but sometimes also with other vowels, e.g. &quot;*qanitu&quot; → &quot;anti&quot; &quot;soul, spirit, ghost&quot;. Then after this syncope, older &quot;*ə&quot; merged with &quot;u&quot;. Later, &quot;*i&quot; and &quot;*u&quot; were lowered to &quot;e&quot; and &quot;o&quot; in closed syllables (&quot;*demdem&quot; → &quot;homhom&quot; &quot;dark&quot;), or finally but preceded by a closed syllable (&quot;*peResi&quot; → &quot;fokse&quot; &quot;squeeze out&quot;, but &quot;afok&quot; &quot;lime&quot; → &quot;afuki&quot; &quot;put lime on&quot;). The phonemic split between and is still unexplained. Diphthongs &quot;*ay&quot; and &quot;*aw&quot; are still retained in Chamorro, while &quot;*uy&quot; has become &quot;i&quot;.

If a word started with a vowel or &quot;*h&quot; (but not &quot;*q&quot;), then prothesis with &quot;gw&quot; or &quot;g&quot; (before &quot;o&quot; or &quot;u&quot;) occurred: &quot;*aku&quot; → &quot;gwahu&quot; &quot;I (emphatic)&quot;, &quot;*enem&quot; → &quot;gunum&quot; &quot;six&quot;. Additionally, &quot;*-iaC&quot;, &quot;*-ua(C)&quot;, and &quot;*-auC&quot; have become &quot;-iyaC&quot;, &quot;-ugwa(C)&quot;, and &quot;-agoC&quot; respectively.

==Grammar ==
Chamorro is a VSO or verb–subject–object language. However, the word order can be very flexible and change to SVO (subject-verb-object), like English, if necessary to convey different types of relative clauses depending on context and to stress parts of what someone is trying to say or convey. Again, that is subject to debate as those on Guam believe the Chamorro word order is flexible, but those in the NMI do not.

Chamorro is also an agglutinative language, whose grammar allows root words to be modified by a number of affixes. For example, &#x27;talked a while (with/to)&#x27;, passive marking prefix , root verb , referential suffix &#x27;to&#x27; (forced morphophonemically to change to &quot;e&quot;) with excrescent consonant &quot;n&quot;, and suffix &#x27;a short amount of time&#x27;. Thus &#x27;He/she was told (something) for a while&#x27;.

Chamorro has many Spanish loanwords and other words have Spanish etymological roots (such as &#x27;shop/store&#x27; from Spanish ), which may lead some to mistakenly conclude that the language is a Spanish creole, but Chamorro very much uses its loanwords in an Austronesian way ( &#x27;playing ball&#x27; from &#x27;ball, play ball&#x27; with verbalizing infix and reduplication of the first syllable of root).

Chamorro is a predicate-initial head-marking language. It has a rich agreement system in the nominal and in the verbal domains.

Chamorro is also known for its wh-agreement in the verb. The agreement morphemes agree with features (roughly the grammatical case feature) of the question phrase and replace the regular subject–verb agreement in transitive realis clauses:

=== Pronouns ===
The following set of pronouns is found in Chamorro:

==Orthography==


The letters , , , , , , , , and are only used in proper names.

In loanwords, some letter combinations in Chamorro sometimes represent single phonemes. For instance, &quot;ci+[vowel]&quot; and &quot;ti+[vowel]&quot; are both pronounced , as in (&#x27;justice&#x27;) and the surname (Spanish influence).

The letter is usually (though not always) pronounced more like (cf. &quot;zheísmo&quot; in Rioplatense Spanish); it is also sometimes used to represent the same sound as the letter by Guamanian speakers. The phonemes represented by and as well as and are not always distinguished in print. Thus the Guamanian place name spelled is pronounced , not as might be expected. is usually pronounced like rather than like English &quot;ch&quot;. Chamorro is usually a tap , but is rolled between vowels, and it is a retroflex approximant , like English &quot;r,&quot; at the beginning of words. Words that begin with &quot;r&quot; in the Chamorro lexicon are exclusively loanwords.

Chamorro has geminate consonants which are written double , , , , , , , and . Its native diphthongs are and , and , , , , and occur in loanwords. When and another vowel are in hiatus, (i.e., , , , and ), they are spelled , , , and .

The default stress in Chamorro penultimate stress, except where marked otherwise. If marked at all in writing, it is usually with an acute accent, as in &#x27;blue&#x27; or &#x27;big&#x27;. Unstressed vowels are limited to , though they are often spelled . Syllables may end in at most one consonant, as in &#x27;sibling&#x27;, &#x27;unload&#x27;, &#x27;shy&#x27;, &#x27;lie face down&#x27;, (Old Chamorro word for 100), or (capital of Guam).

Chamorro language orthography differs between NMI Chamorros and Guamanian Chamorros (example: NMI vs. Guamanian ). In 2021, Guam&#x27;s (CHamoru Language Commission) released the as the latest spelling standard for the local dialect and place names. The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands revised their official Chamorro orthography in 2010, which included a version translated into English.

==Vocabulary==
=== Numbers ===
Current common Chamorro uses only the number words of Spanish origin: , , , etc. Old Chamorro used different number words based on categories: basic numbers (for date, time, etc.), living things, inanimate things, and long objects.
* The number 10 and its multiples up to 90 are (10), (20), (30), (40), (50), (60), (70), (80), (90). These are similar to the corresponding Spanish terms (10), (20), (30), (40), (50), (60), (70), (80), (90).

===Days of the week===
Current common Chamorro uses only the days of the week which are Spanish in origin but are spelled and pronounced differently. There is currently an effort by Chamorro language advocates to introduce or re-introduce native terms for the Chamorro days of the week.
However, both major dialects differ in the terminology used. Guamanian advocates support a number-based system derived from Old Chamorro numerals, whereas the NMI advocates support a more unique system.
===Months===
Before the Spanish-based 12-month calendar became predominant, the Chamoru 13-month lunar calendar was commonly used. The first month in the left column below corresponds with January.

=== Basic phrases ===



==Studies==
Chamorro is studied at the University of Guam, the University of Hawai&#x27;i at Mānoa and in several academic institutions of Guam and the Northern Marianas.

Researchers in several countries are studying aspects of Chamorro. In 2009, the Chamorro Linguistics International Network (CHIN) was established in Bremen, Germany. CHiN was founded on the occasion of the Chamorro Day (27 September 2009) which was part of the programme of the Festival of Languages. The foundation ceremony was attended by people from Germany, Guam, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain, Switzerland, and the United States of America.

<text>Umma () in modern Dhi Qar Province in Iraq, was an ancient city in Sumer. There is some scholarly debate about the Sumerian and Akkadian names for this site. Traditionally, Umma was identified with Tell Jokha. More recently it has been suggested that it was located at Umm al-Aqarib, less than to its northwest or was even the name of both cities. One or both were the leading city of the Early Dynastic kingdom of Gišša, with the most recent excavators putting forth that Umm al-Aqarib was prominent in EDIII but Jokha rose to preeminence later. The town of KI.AN was also nearby. KI.AN, which was destroyed by Rimush, a ruler of the Akkadian Empire. There are known to have been six gods of KI.AN including Gula KI.AN and Sara KI.AN.

The tutelary gods of Umma were Sara and Ninura.It is known that the ED ruler Ur-Lumma built, a temple to the god Enki-gal and one to the god Nagar-pa&#x27;e at Umma.

In the early Sumerian literary composition &quot;Inanna&#x27;s descent to the netherworld&quot;, Inanna dissuades demons from the netherworld from taking Shara, patron of Umma, who was living in squalor.

==History==
The site was occupied at least as far back as the Uruk period. A number of proto-cuneiform came from there. While most early textual sources are from Early Dynastic III, a few tablets and a plaque from ED I/II came from there.

===Early Dynastic period===

Because the two sites were not excavated until modern times, based on the many looted texts available to them, earlier archaeologists grouped together the ancient cities during the Early Dynastic period of Gišša and Umma into the single geographic name of Umma. Modern excavation at these sites has clarified that. Gišša ceased occupation after the ED and only one ruler is known, based on a lapis lazuli bead reading &quot;To the goddess Inanna, Aka, king of Gišša (dedicated this bead)&quot;.

Best known for its long frontier conflict with Lagash, as reported by Entemena, the city reached its zenith , under the rule of Lugal-Zage-Si who also controlled Ur and Uruk.

===Sargonic period===

Under the Akkadian Empire Umma was a major power and economic center rivaled only by Adab and Uruk. Eleven governors under Akkad are known as well as two who may have been under Gutium. One, Lu-Utu, reports building a temple for Ninhursag and another for Ereshkigal. Namahni, a governor from the time of Iarlagan of Gutium, records building the E-ula temple of Ninura. The Sargonic period ruler of Umma Lugalanatum built the temple E-gidru there.
===Ur III period===

Under the Ur III dynasty, Umma became an important provincial center. Several governors of Umma under Ur are known, Aa-kala, Dadaga, and Ur-Lisi, all sons of one Ur-Nigar, and Ninbilia, wife of Aa-kala. Most of the over 30,000 tablets recovered from the site are administrative and economic texts from that time. They permit an excellent insight into affairs in Umma. A year name of Ur III ruler Shu-Sin was &quot;Year Shu-Sin the king of Ur built the temple of Shara in Umma&quot;. The next ruler Ibbi-Sin also had a year name of &quot;Year Ibbi-Sin the king of Ur built the temple of Shara in Umma&quot;. The Umma calendar of Shulgi () is the immediate predecessor of the later Babylonian calendar, and indirectly of the post-exilic Hebrew calendar.

In the following Isin-Larsa period, a ruler of Larsa, Sumuel (c. 1894-1866 BC), lists as one of his later year names &quot;Year Umma was destroyed&quot;.

==Archaeology==
===Tell Jokha===

The site of Tell Jokha was visited by William Loftus in 1854 and John Punnett Peters of the University of Pennsylvania in 1885. Peters found it to be half covered with sand dunes and found fragments of worked stone and copper fragments. In the early 1900s, many illegally excavated Umma tablets from the Third Dynasty of Ur began to appear on the antiquities market. From 1999 to 2002 Jokha was worked by an Iraqi team led by Nawala Ahmed Al-Mutawalli, recovering a number of tablets and bullae from the Early Dynastic, Sargonic, Ur III, and Old Babylonian periods as well as an Ur III period temple and Old Babylonian residences. The cuneiform tablets are in the process of being published. In 2016, a team from the Slovak Archaeological and Historical Institute led by Drahoslav Hulínek began excavations at Tell Jokha focusing on the Temple of Shara. A trench (Trench 1) excavated in 2016 showed the temple had two construction phases (Level 3 and 4). Level 4 is thought to date from the Old Akkadian period. In 2017 a square at the top (Trench 2) of the tell was opened, amidst numerous looter holes, and at Level 5 found Early Dynastic construction. In 2019 and 2020 eighteen cuneiform tablets from the Old Babylonian, Ur III, Old Akkadian and Early Dynastic periods were found in Trench 2, three in situ. A topographic survey showed that in the Early Dynastic period Umma reached an area of 400 hectares, with a 40 hectare city center.

===Umm al-Aqarib (Gišša)===

The site of Umm al-Aqarib (located at 45.80°E longitude and 31.60°N latitude) lies about 6 kilometers southeast of Tell Jokha, covers about 5 square kilometers and is made up of 21 mounds the largest of which is 20 meters above the level of the plain. It is thought to be the ancient city of Gišša and was abandoned after the Early Dynastic period. The location was first visited by John Punnett Peters in the late 1800s, finding it relatively free from sand and featuring two prominent elevations of baked bricks set with bitumen. It was excavated for a total of 7 seasons in 1999–2002 (led by Donny George Youkhanna and Haider A. Urebi) and 2008–2010 (led by Taha Kerim Abod) under difficult conditions. At Umm al-Aqarib, archaeologists uncovered levels from the Early Dynastic Period (c. 2900–2300 BC), including residences, palaces, and several monumental buildings, including two Early Dynastic temples (the White Temple and Temple H). About 70 &quot;cuneiform sources&quot; were also excavated. The tutelary god is thought to be Ama-usum-ga/Usumgal-ana.

===Tell Shmet===

The site of Tell Shmet (also Tell Schmidt and Tell Shmid) also lies nearby, around 10 kilometers to the northwest of Umma and within visual distance of Zabala. It is on the banks of the eastern branch of the Euphrates river just above the canal leading to Zabala. It was part of the Umma province in the Ur III period. The site measures 990 by 720 meters (712,800 square meters). The main Sargonic and Ur III remains of the site were destroyed by a Ministry of Agriculture program to plant trees so as to prevent sand dunes. In response to looting which began in 1994 the Iraqi State Board of Antiquities and Heritage conducted salvage excavations in 2001 and 2002 under Mohammad Sabri Abdulraheem. All of the paper records of the excavation were lost in looting of residential areas after the 2003 war. Plano-convex bricks and a residential area of the Early Dynastic III and Akkadian periods were uncovered. Finds included 67 clay cuneiform tablets, dozens of cylinder seals, and a number of stone and metal objects. The tablets mostly date ED III with the latest being Ur III. The tablets support the proposal that the ancient name of the site was Ki.anki. They mention the names of the gods Ninazu and Dumuzi-Maru. Only six of the tablets have been published.

Previous textual analysis had indicated that KI.AN was very near to Zabala. During the reign of Rimush, second ruler of the Akkadian Empire, KI.AN, under its governor Lugal-KA, joined a regional revolt and was defeated. In the Ur III period KI.AN had an ensi (governor). In that period it is known to have had a temple to the deified ruler Shulgi (called &quot;e-dSulgi-ra&quot;) as well as temples to the gods Šara, Ninurra, Amarsuena, Geštinanna, Dumuzi, Gula, Ninlagaša, and Nine&#x27;e.

===Looting===
During the 2003 invasion of Iraq, after Coalition bombing began, looters descended upon the site which is now pockmarked with hundreds of ditches and pits. The prospects for future official excavation and research were seriously compromised in the process. In 2011, Global Heritage Network, which monitors threats to cultural heritage sites in developing nations, released aerial images comparing Umma in 2003 and 2010, showing a landscape devastated by looters&#x27; trenches during that time—approximately 1.12 square km in total. Confiscated Umma area cuneiform tablets continue to make their way to the Museum of Iraq, including a group of 1500 in 2009.

==List of rulers==
Although the first dynasty of Umma has become well-known based on mentions in inscriptions contemporaneous with other dynasties from the Early Dynastic (ED) III period; it was not inscribed onto the &quot;Sumerian King List (SKL)&quot;. The first dynasty of Umma preceded the dynasty of Akkad in a time in which Umma exercised considerable influence in the region. Only a single ruler (Lugal-zage-si) from Umma was named on the &quot;SKL&quot;; however, his name appears as the sole ruler for the third dynasty of Uruk. The following list should not be considered complete:

<doc id="321537" wikidata="Q242791" url="?curid=321537" title="Kyokushin">
<text>is a style of karate originating in Japan. It is a full-contact style of stand-up fighting and is rooted in a philosophy of self-improvement, discipline, and hard training.

Kyokushin Kaikan is the martial arts organization founded in 1964 by Korean-Japanese , officially the International Karate Organization. Previously, this institution was known as the Oyama Dojo. Since 1964, the style has continued to spread to more than 120 countries, becoming one of the largest martial arts organizations in the world, and in Japan itself.

== History ==
=== Founding ===

Initially, Masutatsu Oyama opened his first official dōjō - the Oyama Dojo - in 1953, in a small building behind Rikkyo University to teach Goju-ryu style of traditional Karate. Subsequently, Oyama&#x27;s Karate theory would deviate from Goju-ryu and would form his own style. His instruction was distinguished by goals improving the strength in the actual battle by performing a kumite that directly hits the opponent&#x27;s body with a thrust or kick. This was unlike the other schools of Karate at the time. Over the next ten years, Oyama built his organization and demonstrated his karate around the world to spread it.

Around 1956, Oyama would rename his school the &quot;Oyama Dojo&quot;. In early days of the dojo, Oyama would not take the duty of teaching newer students. Instead, (a Shotokan teacher from Gakushuin University Karatedo Club), Masashi Ishibashi, Ichiro Minamimoto (both Goju-ryu practitioners from Karatedo Club of Nihon University) and others would teach the newcomers to Oyama&#x27;s dojo. Later, Kenji Kurosaki also became a teacher in the school.

On December 6, 1959, was the first person to practice at the Oyama Dojo that was granted a black belt (first dan), and was listed as the first in the official yearly promotion register of the Kyokushin Kaikan.

In April 1964, Mas Oyama established the &#x27;International Karate Organization Kyokushin kaikan&#x27; (commonly abbreviated to IKO or IKOK) under the umbrella of the Kyokushin Scholarship Foundation. Upon formation, Eisaku Sato acted as chairman and Matsuhei Mori as the vice chairman, with Oyama as the director (later president). Oyama directed the organization through a period of expansion. In June of the same year, the headquarters dojo (later the general headquarters) was completed in Ikebukuro, Toshima, Tokyo.

Oyama hand-picked instructors who displayed ability in marketing the style and gaining new members. Oyama would choose an instructor to open a new dojo. The instructor would move to that town and demonstrate his karate skills in public places. After that, word of mouth would spread through the local area until the dojo had a dedicated core of students. Kyokushin sought to expand its presence with contact with other martial arts disciples, interaction with other groups, matches, assimilation of martial arts technique.

Oyama also sent instructors to other countries such as the Netherlands (Kenji Kurosaki), Australia (Mamoru Kaneko and Shigeo Kato), the United States (Miyuki Miura, Tadashi Nakamura, Shigeru Oyama and Yasuhiko Oyama), Great Britain (Bob Boulton, later joined by Steve Arneil), Canada (Tatsuji Nakamura) and Brazil (Seiji Isobe) to spread Kyokushin in the same way. Many students, including Steve Arneil, Jon Bluming, and Howard Collins, traveled to Japan to train with Oyama directly. Kyokushin also sought to develop a close connection with VIPs and celebrities, focusing on a mass media strategy to increase fans and gain students.

In 1969, Oyama staged &quot;The First All-Japan Full Contact Karate Open Championships&quot; and Terutomo Yamazaki became the first champion. All-Japan Championships have been held at every year. In 1975, &quot;The First World Full Contact Karate Open Championships&quot; were held in Tokyo.

Kyokushin Karate would develop notoriety as &quot;Kenka Karate&quot; or &quot;Brawling Karate&quot;, a moniker Oyama disliked.

At its peak, Oyama was alive in the 1990s, with branches set up in each prefecture, with more than 1,000 official branch dojos in 123 countries around the world, and a scale of 12 million members.

Even before Mas Oyama&#x27;s death in 1994, there have been several organizations that broke off from Oyama&#x27;s IKO. In 1980, the Dutch Kyokushin instructor Jon Bluming would exit the IKO organization to establish the BKK (Budo Kai Kan) in 1980. In 1991, Steve Arneil lead exodus of British Karate Kyokushinkai from IKO, to establish IFK - the International Federation of Karate.

=== The IKO crisis ===

In April 1994, Oyama died of lung cancer at the age of 70 without naming a successor, leaving Akiyoshi Matsui in charge of the IKO. This has brought much political and economic turmoil to the Kyokushin worldwide, leading to fragmentation of the organization at the national and international level.

After Mas Oyama&#x27;s death, the International Karate Organization (IKO) split into two groups, primarily due to personal conflicts over who should succeed Oyama as chairman. One group led by Shokei Matsui became known as IKO-1, and a second group led by Yukio Nishida and Sanpei became was known as IKO-2. The will was proven to be invalid in the family Court of Tokyo in 1995.

There were claims that near the end of his life, Oyama named Matsui (then ranked 5th &quot;dan&quot;, and clearly junior in rank to several senior instructors) to succeed him in leading the IKO. However this claim has been disputed with Oyama&#x27;s family and Matsui himself.

At present there are now several IKO organizations, such as IKO (Shokei Matsui), IKO2 Shinkyokushinkai (Kenji Midori), IKO3 (Y. Matsushima), IKO4 (T. Tezuka).

== Techniques and training ==
Kyokushin Karate training consists of three main elements: technique, forms, and sparring. These are sometimes referred to as the three &quot;K&#x27;s&quot; after the Japanese words for them: kihon (basics), kata (formalized sequences of combat techniques), and kumite (sparring).

=== Kata ===

Kata is a form of ritualized self-training in which patterned or memorized movements are done in order to practice a form of combat maneuverings. According to a highly regarded Kyokushin text, &quot;The Budo Karate of Mas Oyama&quot; by Cameron Quinn, long time interpreter to Oyama, the kata of Kyokushin are classified into Northern and Southern Kata.

The northern kata stems from the Shuri-te tradition of karate, and are drawn from Shotokan karate which Oyama learned while training under Gichin Funakoshi. The southern kata stems from the Naha-te tradition of karate, and are mostly drawn from Goju-ryu karate, which Oyama learned while training under So Nei Chu and Gogen Yamaguchi. One exception may be the kata &quot;Yantsu&quot; which possibly originates with Motobu-ha Shito-ryu. There is also Ura Kata - Several kata are also done in &quot;ura&quot;, which essentially means all moves are done in mirrored form. The &quot;ura&quot;, or &#x27;reverse&#x27; kata, were developed by Oyama as an aid to developing balance and skill in circular techniques against multiple opponents.


=== Sparring (kumite) ===
Sparring, also called kumite, is used to train the application of the various techniques within a fighting situation. Sparring is usually an important part of training in most Kyokushin organizations, especially at the upper levels with experienced students.

In most Kyokushin organizations, hand and elbow strikes to the head or neck are prohibited. However, kicks to the head, knee strikes, punches to the upper body, and kicks to the inner and outer leg are permitted. In some Kyokushin organizations, especially outside of a tournament environment, gloves and shin protectors are worn. Children often wear headgear to lessen the impact of any kicks to the head. Speed and control are instrumental in sparring and in a training environment it is not the intention of either practitioner to injure his opponent as much as it is to successfully execute the proper strike. Tournament fighting under knockdown karate rules is significantly different as the objective is to down an opponent. Full-contact sparring in Kyokushin is considered the ultimate test of strength, endurance, techniques and spirit.

=== Self-defense ===
Also known as Goshin Jitsu, the specific self-defense techniques of the style draw much of their techniques and tactics from Mas Oyama&#x27;s study of Daitō-ryū Aiki-jūjutsu under Yoshida Kotaro. These techniques were never built into the formal grading system, and as karate itself grew increasingly sport-oriented, the self-defense training started to fall into obscurity. Today it is only practiced in a limited number of dojos. However, the proper Kyokushin Karate techniques are extremely effective when it comes to self-defense in any type of fight due to its full body contact fighting style.

=== Grading ===
Colored belts have their origin in Judo, as does the training &quot;gi&quot;, or more correctly in Japanese, &quot;dōgi&quot; or &quot;keikogi&quot;. The example below uses the rank structure used by Kyokushin Karate&#x27;s West Los Angeles Branch although the order of belt colors does vary between Kyokushin groups. For example, 10th &amp; 9th kyus in most groups wear orange belts, while in other groups in rare cases they wear red belts instead.

===United States===
Bobby Lowe opened the first Kyokushin dojo outside of Japan in Hawaii in 1957. After Lowe, Oyama ordered Miyuki Miura, Tadashi Nakamura, Shigeru Oyama and Yasuhiko Oyama to establish Kyokushin Dojos in mainland United States.

===United Kingdom===
Kyokushin Karate was introduced to United Kingdom by Steve Arneil. Originally from Republic of South Africa, Arneil initially intended to establish his Kyokushin Dojo there, but was requested by Mas Oyama to go to the United Kingdom to help establish Kyokushin karate there. Subsequently, he and his wife traveled to London in 1965.

British Kyokushinkai Karate was founded in 1965 after the return of Steve Arneil and Bob Boulton from Japan, where they studied Kyokushinkai in the Tokyo Hombu. Thanks to the deep knowledge and efforts of Shihan Steve Arneil (now 10th dan), the British organization has achieved great success.

===Canada===
Kyokushin was introduced to Canada by Tats Nakamura in 1992 at Vancouver, British Columbia. There have been practitioners in Vancouver, BC, Canada since the late 70s/early 80s where it was referred to as Kyokushinkai and operated independently. Some known black belts are Tom Blaney, Andy Puuseppä, Shawn Ho, and Georges Saint-Pierre.

Shihan Stuart Corrigal (7th degree black belt) is the current representative in Canada for Kyokushin Karate.

=== Australia ===
Kyokushin was introduced by Mamoru Kaneko and Shigeo Kato.

===Netherlands===
Kyokushin was introduced to Netherlands by Jon Bluming and Kenji Kurosaki. On January 2, 1962, Jon Bluming, on behalf of Masutatsu Oyama, creates the first European karate association, called the NKA (Netherlands Karate Association). Under his leadership, the new school quickly gained strength and popularity. In the late 1970s, Jon Bluming leaves the leadership of the organization to his students, and he himself creates a new organization, &quot;Kyokushin Budokai&quot; Karate.

Kyokushin is integral part of Dutch martial arts scene, as it laid foundation for &quot;Dutch-style Kickboxing&quot;, advocated by entities like Mejiro Gym and Chakuriki Gym.

===Germany===
There are various associations at national level in Germany today, including the KKD (Kyokushinkai Karate Germany) and the DKO (German Kyokushin Organization) and the IKOK-D (International Karate Organization Kyokushinkaikan Germany). These are not automatically in the IKO1 on an international level, so the IKOK-D is in the IKO1 (Kyokushinkaikan Honbu) and the DKO in the WKO/IKO2 (Midori).

===Brazil===
Kyokushin was introduced to Brazil by Seiji Isobe. Isobe had been operating a Kyokushin Dojo in Fukui, established on September 20, 1972 - when Mas Oyama offered Isobe the mission of promoting and setting up a dojo network in South America. That same year, Seiji Isobe permanently moved to Brazil and became the head of Kyokushin in South America.

IKO1 (headed by Shokei Matsui, in which Isobe represents Brazil at international level) and Seiwakai Karate (headed by Ademir da Costa) are the most prominent styles of Knockdown Karate in Brazil.

===Poland===
Andrzej Drewniak is credited for bringing Kyokushin to Poland. Fascinated by karate, he founded the first Polish Karate Kyokushin section at AZS in Krakow in 1972. In 1974 he became the Polish middleweight champion in kyokushin karate. In the same year he went to a training camp in the Netherlands, where he passed the 1st dan exam, becoming the first Polish holder of a black belt and the title of Kyokushin karate sensei. In 1979, he became a co-founder of the Polish Karate Association, of which he has been a long-term vice-president.
Thanks to the support of Loek Hollander, the president of the European Karate Kyokushinkai Organization, he received an annual scholarship and an invitation to Japan, but only after six years, secretly from the political and sports authorities, he managed to go to Tokyo. At the end of his stay in Japan, he obtained the 4th dan, after 15 months of training under Sosai Masutatsu Ōyama, where he was the only Polish uchideshi.

Most Kyokushin karate clubs, regardless of their affiliation to world organizations, are also concentrated in the Kyokushin Commission of the Polish Karate Association (KK PZK / Komisji Kyokushin Polskiego Związku Karate) under which inter-organizational competitions of the rank of the Polish Championships and the Macro-region Championships are held.

The &quot;World Oyama Karate&quot;-style, founded by Shigeru Ōyama (10th dan) - has its largest concentration of practitioners in Poland, with largest number of clubs in the world. After Shigeru Ōyama retired from the leadership of the organization, hanshi Jan Dyduch (8th dan) from Krakow became the director of the organization (OYAMA International Karate Federation), who is also the leader of the Polish organization.

===Hungary===
In Hungary, István Adámy and Kálmán Furkó are credited for establishing Kyokushin in the country. In 1977, István Adámy received the 1st Dan Black in Kyokushin and was appointed branch leader of Hungary by IKO. Kálmán Furkó obtained his first dan degree in 1978 and became a shihan in Szolnok in 1984.

The development of domestic Kyokushin started in 1976. By the mid-1980s, there were nearly ten thousand practitioners of Kyokushin Karate in Hungary.
Since then, Kyokushin has been one of the most popular karate styles in Hungary. István Adámy and Kálmán Furkó worked together until the political problems in IKO, following death of Mas Oyama. Since then, they have been on separate paths, but working towards the same goal.

Hungary is particular for hosting the Ibutz Oyama Cup, which was held three times between 1983 and 1986 at the National Sports Arena in Budapest. The tournament was held in three different weight classes. Kyokushin founder Masutatsu Ōyama first visited Hungary in 1983 and was also involved in overseeing the next two tournaments.

===Romania===
===Russia===
The founder of Kyokushinkai karate in the USSR is . While in Poland on a business trip, Tanyushkin met Andrzej Drewniak in Krakow and began to practice karate with him. After some time, having learned about the existence of Kyokushinkai style karate, Tanyushkin and Drewnyak wrote a letter to Masutatsu Oyama and, on his instructions, began to cooperate with the President of the European Kyokushinkai Organization, Loek Hollander. Tanyushkin opened the first section of Kyokushinkai in the USSR in Moscow in 1973. By the end of the 1970s, a school had formed in the country with representatives in all major regions.

After the almost 10-year ban on karate was lifted in 1989, Tanyushkin established the Kyokushinkai Federation of the USSR. The creation of such a federation was a huge step forward for the development of martial arts in the USSR.

During the period of work of the national organization, Kyokushinkai karate entered the country&#x27;s sports classification system as an official sport (1990), and development reached the international level. In 1993, the Kyokushinkai Federation of Russia was one of the first to join the new International Karate Federation (IFK), headed by Hansi Steve Arneil (now 10th dan). On behalf of IFK, on the basis of the Russian national organization, the Eurasian Committee (EAC) was created, representing IFK in the territory of the former USSR. It was headed by S. Stepanov (now 5 dan Kyokushin-kan). The Committee existed until 1998, having held 6 international class &quot;A&quot; tournaments during this time.

After the death of Masutatsu Oyama in 1994 and the split of the Kyokushinkai, from the late 90s, other Kyokushin Federations began to develop in Russia, representing various international organizations. Now in Russia they are working:
* Federation of Kyokushin Karate of Russia (FKKR), representing the World Shinkyokushinkai Organization, WKO, led by Kenji Midori
* Russian National Federation of Kyokushinkai Karate (RNFKK), representing the International Kyokushinkai Organization, IKO, led Shokei Matsui
* Federation of Kyokushinkaikan of Russia (FKR), representing the International Kyokushinkai Organization, IKO, led by Shokei Matsui (until 2013 - Federation of Kyokushinkai Karate of Russia)
* Russian Kyokushinkai Federation (FKR), representing the International Kyokushinkai Federation, IFK, led by Steve Arneil л
* Federation of Kyokushinkan Karate of Russia (FKKR), representing the International Organization of Kyokushinkau, KI, led by Hatsuo Royama

These five Federations are united in the Kyokushin Association of Russia, accredited by the Ministry of Sports and headed by Yu. P. Trutnev (currently Vice Prime Minister of the Government of Russia, Plenipotentiary Representative of the President of the Russian Federation in the Far East).

Some of these organizations (in particular, the Kyokushin Federation of Russia, the Russian Kyokushinkaikan Karate Union, etc.) are members of the All-Style Karate Federation of Russia. In addition, some of these organizations (in particular, the Russian Kyokushin Association, the Russian Kyokushin Karate Federation, the Russian Kyokushin Karate-do Federation, the Russian Kyokushin Federation, the Russian Kyokushin Federation, etc.) are members of the Russian Union of Martial Arts.

===Lithuania===
Large majority of Kyokushin Clubs in Lithuania belong to Kenji Midori&#x27;s WKO Shin-Kyokushin (formerly IKO-2) organization. Currently, there are two IKO-1 clubs Samurajus in Marijampolė and IchiGeki Sports Club in Vilnius.

===Bulgaria===
Bulgaria is well known in the KYOKUSHIN KARATE world since two Bulgarian karatekas had proven their quality in a numerous international, European and world championships. 

Zahari Damyanov: 4 times European and absolute world champion. 
Ivanka Popova: Absolute European champion.

===Spain===
There are a large number of Kyokushin practitioners in Spain, especially on the Mediterranean coast. The main organisations operating in this country are the IKO1 of Matsui, the Shinkyokushinkai, and the WKB. Of these, the WKB is the one with the greatest presence and expansion in the Spanish territory. The most outstanding fighter in Spain is Alejandro Navarro.

===Singapore and SEA===
Kyokushin was introduced to Singapore and of most of South East Asia by Shihan Peter Chong. Chong had established the first Kyokushin Dojo in Singapore in 1968, which was not registered with the Singapore Karate Association at the time.

===Iran===
Iranian Kyokushin fighters have been successful in top-level competition. In particular, Iran is highly successful in Kyokushin World Tournament Open hosted by IKO3 / Matsushima Group.

India

Kyokushin Karate was introduced by Sensei Abhijit Seal, Indian fighters have not been quite successful in international tournaments. It probably holds a good future. Kyokushin Union India is the official organization.

=== Slovakia ===

To Slovakia, Kyokushin was introduced by Norbert Rácz (now 5. dan) in 1994. Norbert Rácz is the Chairman of the Slovak Kyokushin Karate Association from 1998. 

== Kyokushin organizations and derivative styles ==
===Kyokushin organizations===
After Oyama&#x27;s death, several different Kyokushin organizations began to emerge in Japan and beyond.

====International Karate Organization====
Internationally, the name of the original organization is/has been carried by multiple organizations:

* IKO Sosai Kyokushinkaikan was renamed KWO (Kyokushin World Organization) Mas Oyama in 2020 - This organization is run by the Oyama family who inherited it from the late Mas Oyama, the founder of Kyokushin Kaikan. , the third daughter of Mas. Oyama is the current Custodian of his estate. Hanshi Flemming Jinzen Schrøter (8th dan), from Denmark is the Kaicho (President) of the organization and Shihan Aleksandr Anferov (6th dan) of Russia is the Fuko Kaicho (Vice-President).
* IKO Kyokushinkaikan / Kyokushin Matsui Group (IKO) – Following Mas Oyama&#x27;s passing, Shokei Matsui (then 5th dan) was named by Sosai as his successor in his will, just days before his passing. Many questioned why someone who was junior to many other more senior members, and young (he was only 39 at the time) would be put in charge. These questions among others led to the will being challenged and later found invalid by the Japanese courts. In the years since, many high-level disciples of Oyama left to form their own organization. Because of that IKO lost much of the influence they once wielded, but has gained some of it back recently. One need only look at Kyokushin World Tournaments from other organizations to recognize this. At the 5th World Tournament competitors from 105 countries competed. During the 2019 World Tournaments, IKO had competitors from just 38 countries, due to invitation standard. The Shinkyokushin organization by comparison had competitors from 71 countries the same year. IKO is known in Kyokushin circles for their refusal to cooperate with or recognize other Kyokushin organizations, treating them as illegitimate. The founder and current CEO is the successor of Mas Oyama as the head of the organization, Kancho Shokei Matsui (8th dan). The chairman of the international committee is Shihan (9th dan), members of the committee are also Seiji Isobe (8th dan) from Brazil, Kenny Uytenbogaardt (8th dan) from South Africa, and Katsuhito Gorai (7th dan) from USA.
* IKO Matsushima (IKO-3) – established in 1998, it is led by . 
* Kyokushin Karate Tezuka Group (IKO-4) - founded by Toru Tezuka, led by Yoshimichi Mori.
* All Japan Kyokushin Union / Kyokushin Rengōkai (IKO-5 Kyokushinkaikan) – a union of independent organizations, dojos, schools of individual shihan and sensei. Currently, the chairman of the organization is (8th Dan) from Japan, with Shigeru Tabata (8th Dan) as his deputy.
* IKO Kyokushinkaikan Sakamoto Group – established by . Currently, it does not belong to any organization, and is conducting its own activities in Tokyo, Kanagawa, Tochigi, Gunma, Fukui in Japan, and overseas in Iran, Pakistan, India, Chile, etc.
* IKO Kyokushinkaikan World So-Kyokushin (shortened to &quot;So-Kyokushin&quot;) – led by 
* IKO World Kyokushin Kaikan - is a general incorporated association established in 2018 by the Kyokushin Kaikan in the Kyushu area. Led by 
* IKO World Zen-Kyokushin – led by 
* IKO Nakamura - Founded by Makoto Nakamura and led by his son Masanaga Nakamura

====Other major Japanese organizations====
Other Japanese Kyokushin organizations that do not use the official name &quot;IKO&quot; and &quot;Kyokushinkaikan&quot;.
* NPO World Karate Organization Shinkyokushinkai (aka &quot;WKO&quot;, also formerly IKO2) – led by Kenji Midori is likely the largest Kyokushin organization today. It can be difficult to gauge the actual size of various organizations, but based on the number of countries participating in the various Kyokushin organizations world tournaments, Shinkyokushinkai is likely the largest. They fielded competitors from 71 countries during their World Tournament in 2019, while IKO-1, who claims to be the largest had only had 38 countries competing.
* Kyokushin-Kan International (KI) – Founded by Kaicho Hatsuo Royama &amp; headed by Kancho Hiroto Okazaki
* IBMA (International Budo-Man Association) Kyokushin Karate Masuda Dojo – headed by Akira Masuda.
* KWU (Kyokushin World Union) – an organization founded on October 12, 2011. It was established to replace the Kyokushin-Kan Alliance founded by Hatsuo Royama. The original Kyokushin-kan was established by Hatsuo Royama following his displeasure with Shokei Matsui&#x27;s leadership of IKO1. With the help of Hiroto Okazaki and others, Royama established the Kyokushin-kan International Honbu in December 2002. The goal of the organization is to follow &quot;Kyokushin&#x27;s original spirit which Oyama envisioned.&quot;
* Kyokushin Budo Karate Organization Kyokushin Kenbukai – led by Masahiro Kaneko.

====Major organizations outside Japan====
* IFK (International Federation of Karate) – Established by Steve Arneil and British Karate Kyokushinkai (BKK) in 1991, following an exodus from Oyama&#x27;s IKO.
* KWF (Kyokushin World Federation) – founded by Shihan Loek Hollander (10th dan) from the Netherlands, serving as the honorary president of KWF for years, who died on February 16, 2020. The current president of the organization is shihan Antonio Pinero (9th dan) from Spain, and the vice president is Hristo Traikov (7th dan) from Bulgaria. 
* IBK (International Budokai Kan) – founded by former IKO member Jon Bluming. Originally BKK (Budo Kai Kan) from 1980, the name was changed to IBK in 1996. Advocates &quot;Kyokushin Budokai&quot;, which focuses on self-defense, with emphasis on judo-like throws.

* WAKKU (World All Kyokushin Karate Union), an organization founded in 2014, by Seiji Kanamura and Hanshi Hussein Suleiman.

===Derivative styles===
Kyokushin has had an influence on many other styles:
* Ashihara Karate – founded by Hideyuki Ashihara. Places emphasis on self-defense and Tai Sabaki.
* Enshin Karate – competitive variant of Ashihara Karate, founded by Jōkō Ninomiya.
* Seidokaikan - traditional full contact karate derived from Kyokushin by Kazuyoshi Ishii. Seidokaikan organized the first professional full contact karate tournament named the Karate World Cup. The Karate World Cup had special extension rounds; if the judge&#x27;s decision was deadlocked after an extension round, the rules then allowed face strikes with fighters donning boxing gloves (kickboxing). The founder would later establish the Professional Kickboxing promotion K-1.
* Seidō juku – founded by Tadashi Nakamura, the main dojo is located in New York, USA.
* Satojuku – established by Katsuaki Sato in 1977. It is a similar style to Kyokushin, but emphasizes precise knockdown techniques over techniques designed to injure or &quot;knock-out&quot; one&#x27;s opponent. Describing his art in 1987, Satō wrote, &quot;Odo means the way champions must behave. It is based on humane feelings and courtesy, on being honorable, on being devoid of selfishness or bias. It is the antithesis of any martial art that relies only on force to conquer an opponent.&quot;
* Shidōkan – founded by Yoshiji Soeno.
* Seiwakai – founded by Ademir da Costa, this style is mainly based in Brazil. Seiwakai is characterized as an aggressive style, with a fighting strategy aimed at achieving victory by knockout. 
* World Oyama – established by Shigeru Oyama in the United States. The entity is currently headed by his younger brother, Yasuhiko Oyama, who operates out of Birmingham, Alabama. Has a significant presence in Poland, where the organization is headed by Hanshi Jan Dyduch (8th Dan).
* Sei Budokai – headed by Hanshi Leonardo Voinescu (8th dan Sei Budokai, 4th dan Judo) from Romania. The honorary president is hanshi Dave Jonkers (9th dan Sei Budokai, 9th dan Ashihara Karate, 5th dan judo) from the Netherlands, and the honorary technical director is shihan Semmy Schilt (6th dan Ashihara Karate, 6th dan Sei Budokai) from Netherlands, and still growing in America, Europe and Asia.

Kokondo is derived from Kyokushin, albeit without a strong focus on competition with the emphasis rather on realistic goshin-jutsu (self-defense). Some styles originating in Kyokushin (Jushindo, Kūdō, Zendokai) have changed to mixed martial arts rules.

== Influence ==

Kyokushin has influenced other styles, especially the knockdown karate competition format. Karate styles that originated in Kyokushin, such as Ashihara Karate, Budokaido, Godokai, Enshin Karate, Seidō juku, Musokai, Shidōkan, World Oyama and Seidokaikan, are also knockdown styles and use slight variations of the competition rules.

Many top kickboxers such as Andy Hug, Francisco Filho and Masahiro Yamamoto- have started in knockdown karate. The influence of Kyokushin can be seen in the K-1 kickboxing tournament that originated out of the Seidokaikan karate organization, which is an offshoot from Kyokushin.

Kyokushin is the basis of glove karate, a knockdown karate format wearing boxing gloves and allowing punches to the head. Glove karate rules are used in Kyokushin Karate Iran.

== In popular culture ==

Kyokushin Karate has featured in following videogames:
* The move sets of Ryu and Ken from Capcom&#x27;s &quot;Street Fighter&quot; franchise are based on Kyokushin. Both characters are based on notable Kyokushin practitioners from late 60s/early 70s, with Ryu based on Yoshiji Soeno and Ken on Terutomo Yamazaki. The characters are influenced by the real-life counterparts&#x27; depictions in manga Karate Baka Ichidai.
* In Namco&#x27;s &quot;Tekken&quot; series, Jin Kazama uses Kyokushin Karate as his fighting style, starting from Tekken 4 and subsequent titles.
* Kyokushin Karate has served as the basis for the Kyokugenryu Karate, a fictional martial art from SNK Playmore&#x27;s &quot;Art of Fighting&quot;, &quot;Fatal Fury&quot;, and &quot;King of Fighters&quot; series. Kyokugenryu (lit. &quot;the extreme style&quot;) and Kyokushin are similar sounding names, and the family patriarch Takuma Sakazaki is modelled after Kyokusin founder Mas Oyama. Besides Takuma, characters Ryo Sakazaki, Robert Garcia, Yuri Sakazaki and Marco Rodrigues use this style. 
* Torao Onigawara in the arcade game &quot;The Fallen Angels&quot; is a master of Kyokushin Karate.

A trilogy of films starring Sonny Chiba and directed by Kazuhiko Yamaguchi were produced in Japan between 1975 and 1977: &quot;Champion of Death&quot;, &quot;Karate Bearfighter&quot; and &quot;Karate for Life&quot;. Chiba plays Master Oyama, who also appears in two of the films.

The James Bond movie &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot;, starring Sean Connery, was filmed largely in Japan and featured a karate demonstration by a number of well-known Kyokushin students, including Shigeo Kato (who introduced Kyokushin to Australia and was the original teacher of Shokei Matsui) and Akio Fujihira.

<doc id="321538" wikidata="Q1073914" url="?curid=321538" title="Chinese grammar">
<text>The grammar of Standard Chinese shares many features with other varieties of Chinese. The language almost entirely lacks inflection; words typically have only one grammatical form. Categories such as number (singular or plural) and verb tense are often not expressed by grammatical means, but there are several particles that serve to express verbal aspect and, to some extent, mood.

The basic word order is subject–verb–object (SVO), as in English. Otherwise, Chinese is chiefly a head-final language, meaning that modifiers precede the words that they modify. In a noun phrase, for example, the head noun comes last, and all modifiers, including relative clauses, come in front of it. This phenomenon, however, is more typically found in subject–object–verb languages, such as Turkish and Japanese.

Chinese frequently uses serial verb constructions, which involve two or more verbs or verb phrases in sequence. Chinese prepositions behave similarly to serialized verbs in some respects, and they are often referred to as coverbs. There are also location markers, which are placed after nouns and are thus often called postpositions; they are often used in combination with coverbs. Predicate adjectives are normally used without a copular verb (&quot;to be&quot;) and so can be regarded as a type of verb.

As in many other East Asian languages, classifiers (or measure words) are required when numerals (and sometimes other words, such as demonstratives) are used with nouns. There are many different classifiers in the language, and each countable noun generally has a particular classifier associated with it. Informally, however, it is often acceptable to use the general classifier in place of other specific classifiers.

==Word formation==
In Chinese, the difference between words and Chinese characters is often not clear, this is one of the reasons the Chinese script does not use spaces to separate words. A string of characters can be translated as a single English word, but these characters have some kind of independence. For example, , meaning &#x27;to dance&#x27;, can be used as a single intransitive verb, or may be regarded as comprising two single lexical words. However, it does in fact function as a compound of the verb and the object . Additionally, the present progressive aspect marker can be inserted between these two parts to form .

Chinese morphemes (the smallest units of meaning) are mostly monosyllabic. In most cases, morphemes are represented by single characters. However, two or more monosyllabic morphemes can be translated as a single English word. These monosyllabic morphemes can be either free or bound – that is, in particular usage, they may or may not be able to stand independently. Most two-syllable compound nouns often have the head on the right (e.g. means &quot;cake&quot;), while compound verbs often have the head on the left (e.g. means &quot;debate&quot;).

Some Chinese morphemes are polysyllabic; for example, the loanwords is the compound of and , but this compound is actually simply a transliteration of &quot;sofa&quot;. Many native disyllabic morphemes, such as , have consonant alliteration.

Many monosyllabic words have alternative disyllabic forms with virtually the same meaning, such as for . Many disyllabic nouns are produced by adding the suffix to a monosyllabic word or morpheme. There is a strong tendency for monosyllables to be avoided in certain positions; for example, a disyllabic verb will not normally be followed by a monosyllabic object. This may be connected with the preferred metrical structure of the language.

===Reduplication===
Reduplication (the repetition of a syllable or word) is a common feature in Chinese:
*Family members: (, &quot;mother&quot;); &quot;&quot; (, &quot;younger brother&quot;)
*Adjectives or adverb: to emphasize the state described by the adjective/adverb, or as a childish expression.
:&#x27; ( &quot;red&quot;), from &#x27; (, &quot;red&quot;);
::ex. (&#x27;, &quot;palm looks red&quot;)
:&#x27; ( &quot;very happily&quot;), from &#x27; (, &quot;happy, happiness&quot;);
::ex. (&#x27;, &quot;eat happily&quot;)
:&#x27; (, &quot;ice-cool&quot; ), from &#x27; (, &quot;ice-cool&quot;);
::ex. (&#x27;, &quot;ice-cold drink&quot;)
*Other adjectives have ABB reduplication structure:
:&#x27; (, literally&quot; good smell spray out&quot;, means &quot;smell very good&quot;), from &#x27; (, &quot;to smell good, smell&quot;) and &quot;&quot; (, &quot;spray&quot;);
:&#x27; (, &quot;shining, bright and clear&quot;), from &#x27; (, &quot;bright&quot;) and &quot;&quot; (, &quot;shiny like a star&quot;);
*Verbs: to mark the delimitative aspect (&quot;to do something for a little bit&quot;) or for general emphasis – see the section:
: ( &quot;write homework / write homework for a while&quot;), from the verb ( &quot;write&quot;) and the noun ( &quot;homework&quot;)
*Single morphemes:
:&#x27; (, &quot;star&quot;), from &#x27; (, &quot;star&quot;);
:&#x27; (, &quot;often&quot;), from &#x27; (, &quot;constant&quot;);
:&#x27; (, &quot;puppy/doggy&quot;), from &#x27; (, &quot;dog&quot;)
*Chinese classifiers, to produce a phrase meaning &quot;every&quot; or &quot;many&quot;:
:&#x27; (, &quot;You all look smart&quot;, from Crystal Boys), where ordinarily &#x27; () is the general classifier. Literally, the phrase &#x27; means &quot;every&quot;, and the character &#x27; means &quot;all&quot;.
:&#x27; (, &quot;many green hills&quot;), where ordinarily &#x27; () is a proper classifier for &quot;&quot; (, &quot;hill&quot;).

==Sentence structure==
Chinese, like Spanish or English, is classified as an SVO (subject–verb–object) language. Transitive verbs precede their objects in typical simple clauses, while the subject precedes the verb. For example:

Chinese can also be considered a topic-prominent language: there is a strong preference for sentences that begin with the topic, usually &quot;given&quot; or &quot;old&quot; information; and end with the comment, or &quot;new&quot; information. Certain modifications of the basic subject–verb–object order are permissible and may serve to achieve topic-prominence. In particular, a direct or indirect object may be moved to the start of the clause to create topicalization. It is also possible for an object to be moved to a position in front of the verb for emphasis.

Another type of sentence is what has been called an ergative structure, where the apparent subject of the verb can move to object position; the empty subject position is then often occupied by an expression of location. Compare locative inversion in English. This structure is typical of the verb (, &quot;there is/are&quot;; in other contexts the same verb means &quot;have&quot;), but it can also be used with many other verbs, generally denoting position, appearance or disappearance. An example:

Chinese is also to some degree a pro-drop or null-subject language, meaning that the subject can be omitted from a clause if it can be inferred from the context. In the following example, the subject of the verbs for &quot;hike&quot; and &quot;camp&quot; is left to be inferred—it may be &quot;we&quot;, &quot;I&quot;, &quot;you&quot;, &quot;she&quot;, etc.

In the next example the subject is omitted and the object is topicalized by being moved into subject position, to form a passive-type sentence. For passive sentences with a marker such as , see the passive section.

Adverbs and adverbial phrases that modify the verb typically come after the subject but before the verb, although other positions are sometimes possible; see Adverbs and adverbials. For constructions that involve more than one verb or verb phrase in sequence, see Serial verb constructions. For sentences consisting of more than one clause, see Conjunctions.

===Objects===
Some verbs can take both an indirect object and a direct object. Indirect normally precedes direct, as in English:

With many verbs, however, the indirect object may alternatively be preceded by prepositional &quot;gěi&quot; (); in that case it may either precede or follow the direct object. (Compare the similar use of &quot;to&quot; or &quot;for&quot; in English.)

To emphasize the direct object, it can be combined with the accusative marker &quot;bǎ&quot; (, literally &quot;hold&quot;) to form a &quot;&quot;bǎ&quot; + direct object&quot; phrase. This phrase is placed before the verb. For example:

Other markers can be used in a similar way as &quot;bǎ&quot;, such as the formal &quot;jiāng&quot; (, literally &quot;lead&quot;) :

and colloquial &quot;ná&quot; (, literally &quot;get&quot;)

To explain this kind of usage, some linguists assume that some verbs can take two direct objects, called the called &quot;inner&quot; and &quot;outer&quot; object. Typically, the outer object will be placed at the start of the sentence (which is the topic) or introduced via the &quot;bǎ&quot; phrase. For example:

==Noun phrases==
The head noun of a noun phrase comes at the end of the phrase; this means that everything that modifies the noun comes before it. This includes attributive adjectives, determiners, quantifiers, possessives, and relative clauses.

Chinese does not have articles as such; a noun may stand alone to represent what in English would be expressed as &quot;the ...&quot; or &quot;a[n] ...&quot;. However the word &quot;yī&quot; (, &quot;one&quot;), followed by the appropriate classifier, may be used in some cases where English would have &quot;a&quot; or &quot;an&quot;. It is also possible, with many classifiers, to omit the &quot;yī&quot; and leave the classifier on its own at the start of the noun phrase.

The demonstratives are &quot;zhè&quot; (, &quot;this&quot;), and &quot;nà&quot; (, &quot;that&quot;). When used before a noun, these are often followed by an appropriate classifier (for discussion of classifiers, see Classifiers below and the article Chinese classifiers). However this use of classifiers is optional. When a noun is preceded by a numeral (or a demonstrative followed by a numeral), the use of a classifier or measure word is in most cases considered mandatory. (This does not apply to nouns that function as measure words themselves; this includes many units of measurement and currency.)

The plural marker &quot;xiē&quot; (, &quot;some, several&quot;; also used to pluralize demonstratives) is used without a classifier. However &quot;jǐ&quot; (, &quot;some, several, how many&quot;) takes a classifier.

For adjectives in noun phrases, see the Adjectives section. For noun phrases with pronouns rather than nouns as the head, see the Pronouns section.

Possessives are formed by adding &quot;de&quot; ()—the same particle that is used after relative clauses and sometimes after adjectives—after the noun, noun phrase or pronoun that denotes the possessor.

==Relative clauses==
Chinese relative clauses, like other noun modifiers, precede the noun they modify. Like possessives and some adjectives, they are marked with the final particle &quot;de&quot; (). A free relative clause is produced if the modified noun following the &quot;de&quot; is omitted. A relative clause usually comes after any determiner phrase, such as a numeral and classifier. For emphasis, it may come before the determiner phrase.

There is usually no relative pronoun in the relative clause. Instead, a gap is left in subject or object position as appropriate. If there are two gaps—the additional gap being created by pro-dropping—ambiguity may arise. For example, &quot;chī de&quot; () may mean &quot;[those] who eat&quot; or &quot;[that] which is eaten&quot;. When used alone, it usually means &quot;things to eat&quot;.

If the relative item is governed by a preposition in the relative clause, then it is denoted by a pronoun, e.g. &quot;tì tā&quot; (, &quot;for him&quot;), to explain &quot;for whom&quot;. Otherwise the whole prepositional phrase is omitted, the preposition then being implicitly understood.

For example sentences, see Relative clause → Mandarin.

== Classifiers ==

Some English words are paired with specific nouns to indicate their counting units. For example, &quot;Bottle&quot; in &quot;two bottles of wine&quot; and &quot;sheet&quot; in &quot;three sheets of paper&quot;. However, most English nouns can be counted directly without specifying units, while counting of most Chinese nouns must be associated with a specific &quot;classifier&quot;, namely &#x27; (, &quot;measure words&quot;), to represent their counting units. Every Chinese noun can only be associated with a limited number of classifiers. For example

 (, &quot;bottle&quot;) and (, &quot;cup&quot;) are both proper classifiers of the countable noun (), while () and () are unacceptable.

While there are dozens of classifiers, the general classifier &quot;gè&quot; () is colloquially (i.e. in informal conversations) acceptable for most nouns. However, there are still some exceptions. For example, () is weird and unacceptable.

Most classifiers originated as independent words in Classical Chinese, so they are generally associated with certain groups of nouns with common properties related to their own classical meaning, for example:

Therefore, collocation of classifiers and noun sometimes depends on how native speakers realize them. For example, the noun &quot;zhuōzi&quot; (, &quot;table&quot;) is associated with the classifier &quot;zhāng&quot; (), due to the sheet-like table-top. Additionally, &quot;yǐ-zi&quot; (, &quot;chair&quot;) is associated with &quot;bǎ&quot; (, &quot;hold&quot;), because a chair can be moved by holding its top like a handle. Furthermore, due to the invention of the folding chair, &quot;yǐ-zi&quot; (, &quot;chair&quot;) is also associated with the classifier &quot;zhāng&quot; () to express a folding chair can be &quot;extended&quot; (unfolded).

Classifiers are also used optionally after demonstratives, and in certain other situations. See the Noun phrases section, and the article Chinese classifier.

==Numerals==
==Pronouns==

The Chinese personal pronouns are &quot;wǒ&quot; (, &quot;I, me&quot;), &quot;nǐ&quot; (, &quot;you&quot;), and &quot;tā&quot; (, &quot;he, him / she, her / it (animals) / it (inanimate objects)&quot;. Plurals are formed by adding &quot;men&quot; (): &quot;wǒmen&quot; (, &quot;we, us&quot;), &quot;nǐmen&quot; (, &quot;you&quot;), &quot;tāmen&quot; (, &quot;they/them&quot;). There is also &quot;nín&quot; (), a formal, polite word for singular &quot;you&quot;, as well as a less common plural form, &quot;nínmen&quot; (). Some northern dialects have a third-person formal, polite word (+, he/him + heart) similar to (+, you + heart). The alternative &quot;inclusive&quot; word for &quot;we/us&quot;—&quot;zán&quot; () or &quot;zá[n]men&quot; (), specifically including the listener (like the difference between English &quot;let us&quot; and &quot;let&#x27;s&quot;)—is used colloquially. The third-person pronouns are not often used for inanimates, with demonstratives used instead.

Possessives are formed with &quot;de&quot; (), such as &quot;wǒde&quot; (, &quot;my, mine&quot;), &quot;wǒmende&quot; (, &quot;our[s]&quot;), etc. The &quot;de&quot; may be omitted in phrases denoting inalienable possession, such as &quot;wǒ māma&quot; (, &quot;my mom&quot;).

The demonstrative pronouns are &quot;zhè&quot; (, &quot;this&quot;, colloquially pronounced &quot;zhèi&quot; as a shorthand for ) and &quot;nà&quot; (, &quot;that&quot;, colloquially pronounced &quot;nèi&quot; as a shorthand for ). They are optionally pluralized by the addition of plural quantifiers &quot;xiē&quot; () or &quot;qún&quot; (). There is a reflexive pronoun &quot;zìjǐ&quot; () meaning &quot;oneself, myself, etc.&quot;, which can stand alone as an object or a possessive, or may follow a personal pronoun for emphasis. The reciprocal pronoun &quot;each other&quot; can be translated from &quot;bǐcǐ&quot; (), usually in adverb position. An alternative is &quot;hùxiāng&quot; (, &quot;mutually&quot;).

==Adjectives==

Adjectives can be used attributively, before a noun. The relative marker &quot;de&quot; () may be added after the adjective, but this is not always required; &quot;black horse&quot; may be either &quot;hēi mǎ&quot; () or &quot;hēi de mǎ&quot; (). When multiple adjectives are used, the order &quot;quality/size – shape – color&quot; is followed, although this is not necessary when each adjective is made into a separate phrase with the addition of &quot;de&quot;.

Gradable adjectives can be modified by words meaning &quot;very&quot;, etc.; such modifying adverbs normally precede the adjective, although some, such as &quot;jíle&quot; (, &quot;extremely&quot;), come after it.

When adjectives co-occur with classifiers, they normally follow the classifier. However, with most common classifiers, when the number is &quot;one&quot;, it is also possible to place adjectives like &quot;big&quot; and &quot;small&quot; before the classifier for emphasis.

Adjectives can also be used predicatively. In this case they behave more like verbs; there is no need for a copular verb in sentences like &quot;he is happy&quot; in Chinese; one may say simply &quot;tā gāoxìng&quot; (, &quot;he happy&quot;), where the adjective may be interpreted as a verb meaning &quot;is happy&quot;. In such sentences it is common for the adjective to be modified by a word meaning &quot;very&quot; or the like; in fact the word &quot;hěn&quot; (, &quot;very&quot;) is often used in such cases with gradable adjectives, even without carrying the meaning of &quot;very&quot;.

It is nonetheless possible for a copula to be used in such sentences, to emphasize the adjective. In the phrase &quot;tā shì gāoxìng le&quot;, (, &quot;he is now truly happy&quot;), &quot;shì&quot; is the copula meaning &quot;is&quot;, and &quot;le&quot; is the inceptive marker discussed later. This is similar to the cleft sentence construction. Sentences can also be formed in which an adjective followed by &quot;de&quot; () stands as the complement of the copula.

==Adverbs and adverbials==
Adverbs and adverbial phrases normally come in a position before the verb, but after the subject of the verb. In sentences with auxiliary verbs, the adverb usually precedes the auxiliary verb as well as the main verb. Some adverbs of time and attitude (&quot;every day&quot;, &quot;perhaps&quot;, etc.) may be moved to the start of the clause, to modify the clause as a whole. However, some adverbs cannot be moved in this way. These include three words for &quot;often&quot;, &quot;cháng&quot; (), &quot;chángcháng&quot; () and &quot;jīngcháng&quot; (); &quot;dōu&quot; (, &quot;all&quot;); &quot;jiù&quot; (, &quot;then&quot;); and &quot;yòu&quot; (, &quot;again&quot;).

Adverbs of manner can be formed from adjectives using the clitic &quot;de&quot; (). It is generally possible to move these adverbs to the start of the clause, although in some cases this may sound awkward, unless there is a qualifier such as &quot;hěn&quot; (, &quot;very&quot;) and a pause after the adverb.

Some verbs take a prepositional phrase following the verb and its direct object. These are generally obligatory constituents, such that the sentence would not make sense if they were omitted. For example:

There are also certain adverbial &quot;stative complements&quot; which follow the verb. The character &quot;de&quot; () followed by an adjective functions the same as the phrase &quot;-ly&quot; in English, turning the adjective into an adverb. The second is &quot;hǎo le&quot; (, &quot;complete&quot;). It is not generally possible for a single verb to be followed by both an object and an adverbial complement of this type, although there are exceptions in cases where the complement expresses duration, frequency or goal. To express both, the verb may be repeated in a special kind of serial verb construction; the first instance taking an object, the second taking the complement. Aspect markers can then appear only on the second instance of the verb.

The typical Chinese word order &quot;XVO&quot;, where an oblique complement such as a locative prepositional phrase precedes the verb, while a direct object comes after the verb, is very rare cross-linguistically; in fact, it is only in varieties of Chinese that this is attested as the typical ordering.

===Locative phrases===

Expressions of location in Chinese may include a preposition, placed before the noun; a postposition, placed after the noun; both preposition and postposition; or neither. Chinese prepositions are commonly known as coverbs – see the Coverbs section. The postpositions—which include &quot;shàng&quot; (, &quot;up, on&quot;), &quot;xià&quot; (, &quot;down, under&quot;), &quot;lǐ&quot; (, &quot;in, within&quot;), &quot;nèi&quot; (, &quot;inside&quot;) and &quot;wài&quot; (, &quot;outside&quot;)—may also be called &quot;locative particles&quot;.

In the following examples locative phrases are formed from a noun plus a locative particle:

The most common preposition of location is &quot;zài&quot; (, &quot;at, on, in&quot;). With certain nouns that inherently denote a specific location, including nearly all place names, a locative phrase can be formed with &quot;zài&quot; together with the noun:

However other types of nouns still require a locative particle as a postposition in addition to &quot;zài&quot;:

If a noun is modified so as to denote a &quot;specific&quot; location, as in &quot;this [object]...&quot;, then it may form locative phrases without any locative particle. Some nouns which can be understood to refer to a specific place, like &quot;jiā&quot; (, home) and &quot;xuéxiào&quot; (, &quot;school&quot;), may optionally omit the locative particle. Words like &quot;shàngmiàn&quot; (, &quot;top&quot;) can function as specific-location nouns, like in &quot;zài shàngmiàn&quot; (, &quot;on top&quot;), but can also take the role of locative particle, not necessarily with analogous meaning. The phrase &quot;zài bàozhǐ shàngmiàn&quot; (), can mean either &quot;in the newspaper&quot; or &quot;on the newspaper&quot;.

In certain circumstances &quot;zài&quot; can be omitted from the locative expression. Grammatically, a noun or noun phrase followed by a locative particle is still a noun phrase. For instance, &quot;zhuōzi shàng&quot; can be regarded as short for &quot;zhuōzi shàngmiàn&quot;, meaning something like &quot;the table&#x27;s top&quot;. Consequently, the locative expression without &quot;zài&quot; can be used in places where a noun phrase would be expected – for instance, as a modifier of another noun using &quot;de&quot; (), or as the object of a different preposition, such as &quot;cóng&quot; (, &quot;from&quot;). The version with &quot;zài&quot;, on the other hand, plays an adverbial role. However, &quot;zài&quot; is usually omitted when the locative expression begins a sentence with the ergative structure, where the expression, though having an adverbial function, can be seen as filling the subject or noun role in the sentence. For examples, see sentence structure section.

The word &quot;zài&quot; (), like certain other prepositions or coverbs, can also be used as a verb. A locative expression can therefore appear as a predicate without the need for any additional copula. For example, &quot;he is at school&quot; (, literally &quot;he at school&quot;).

==Comparatives and superlatives==
Comparative sentences are commonly expressed simply by inserting the standard of comparison, preceded by &quot;bǐ&quot; (, &quot;than&quot;). The adjective itself is not modified. The &quot;bǐ&quot; (, &quot;than&quot;) phrase is an adverbial, and has a fixed position before the verb. See also the section on negation.

If there is no standard of comparison—i.e., a &quot;than&quot; phrase—then the adjective can be marked as comparative by a preceding adverb &quot;bǐjiào&quot; (), &quot;jiào&quot; () or &quot;gèng&quot; (), all meaning &quot;more&quot;. Similarly, superlatives can be expressed using the adverb &quot;zuì&quot; (, &quot;most&quot;), which precedes a predicate verb or adjective.

Adverbial phrases meaning &quot;like [someone/something]&quot; or &quot;as [someone/something]&quot; can be formed using &quot;gēn&quot; (), &quot;tóng&quot; () or &quot;xiàng&quot; () before the noun phrase, and &quot;yīyàng&quot; () or &quot;nàyàng&quot; () after it.

The construction &quot;yuè ... yuè ...&quot; can be translated into statements of the type &quot;the more ..., the more ...&quot;.

==Copula==

The Chinese copular verb is &quot;shì&quot; (). This is the equivalent of English &quot;to be&quot; and all its forms—&quot;am&quot;, &quot;is&quot;, &quot;are&quot;, &quot;was&quot;, &quot;were&quot;, etc. However, &quot;shì&quot; is normally only used when its complement is a noun or noun phrase. As noted above, predicate adjectives function as verbs themselves, as does the locative preposition &quot;zài&quot; (), so in sentences where the predicate is an adjectival or locative phrase, &quot;shì&quot; is not required.

For another use of &quot;shì&quot;, see &quot;shì ... [de]&quot; construction in the section on cleft sentences. The English existential phrase &quot;there is&quot; [&quot;there are&quot;, etc.] is translated using the verb &quot;yǒu&quot; (), which is otherwise used to denote possession.

== Aspects ==
Chinese does not have grammatical markers of tense. The time at which action is conceived as taking place—past, present, future—can be indicated by expressions of time—&quot;yesterday&quot;, &quot;now&quot;, etc.—or may simply be inferred from the context. However, Chinese does have markers of aspect, which is a feature of grammar that gives information about the temporal flow of events. There are two aspect markers that are especially commonly used with past events: the perfective-aspect &quot;le&quot; () and the experiential &quot;guo&quot; (). Some authors, however, do not regard &quot;guo&quot; (or &quot;zhe&quot;; see below) as markers of aspect. Both &quot;le&quot; and &quot;guo&quot; immediately follow the verb. 

There is also a sentence-final inchoative &quot;le&quot; (), which is an aspect-marking particle that indicates a change in state. Following a convention used by some textbooks, it is listed with the modal particles below, even though it does not indicate a grammatical mood.

The perfective &quot;le&quot; presents the viewpoint of &quot;an event in its entirety&quot;. It is sometimes considered to be a past tense marker, although it can also be used with future events, given appropriate context. Some examples of its use:

Using &quot;le&quot; () shows this event that has taken place or took place at a particular time.

This format of &quot;le&quot; () is usually used in a time-delimited context such as &quot;today&quot; or &quot;last week&quot;.

The above may be compared with the following examples with &quot;guo&quot;, and with the examples with sentence-final &quot;le&quot; given under Particles.

The experiential &quot;guo&quot; &quot;ascribes to a subject the property of having experienced the event&quot;.

This also implies that the speaker no longer is a soldier.

There are also two imperfective aspect markers: &quot;zhèngzài&quot; () or &quot;zài&quot; (), and &quot;zhe&quot; (), which denote ongoing actions or states. &quot;Zhèngzài&quot; and &quot;zài&quot; precede the verb, and are usually used for ongoing actions or dynamic events – they may be translated as &quot;[be] in the process of [-ing]&quot; or &quot;[be] in the middle of [-ing]&quot;. &quot;Zhe&quot; follows the verb, and is used mostly for static situations.

Both markers may occur in the same clause, however. For example, &quot;tā zhèngzai dǎ [zhe] diànhuà&quot;, &quot;he is in the middle of telephoning someone&quot; ().

The delimitative aspect denotes an action that goes on only for some time, &quot;doing something &#x27;a little bit&#x27;&quot;. This can be expressed by reduplication of a monosyllabic verb, like the verb &quot;zǒu&quot; ( &quot;walk&quot;) in the following sentence:

An alternative construction is reduplication with insertion of &quot;one&quot; ( &quot;yī&quot;). For example, &quot;zǒu yi zǒu&quot; (), which might be translated as &quot;walk a little walk&quot;. A further possibility is reduplication followed by &quot;kàn&quot; ( &quot;to see&quot;); this emphasizes the &quot;testing&quot; nature of the action. If the verb has an object, &quot;kàn&quot; follows the object.

Some compound verbs, such as restrictive-resultative and coordinate compounds, can also be reduplicated on the pattern &quot;tǎolùn-tǎolùn&quot; (), from the verb &quot;tǎolùn&quot; (), meaning &quot;discuss&quot;. Other compounds may be reduplicated, but for general emphasis rather than delimitative aspect. In compounds that are verb–object combinations, like &quot;tiào wǔ&quot; (, &quot;dance&quot;), a delimitative aspect can be marked by reduplicating the first syllable, creating &quot;tiào-tiào wǔ&quot; (), which may be followed with &quot;kàn&quot; ().

==Passive==
As mentioned above, the fact that a verb is intended to be understood in the passive voice is not always marked in Chinese. However, it may be marked using the passive marker 被 &quot;bèi&quot;, followed by the agent, though &quot;bèi&quot; may appear alone, if the agent is not to be specified. Certain causative markers can replace &quot;bèi&quot;, such as those mentioned in the Other cases section, &quot;gěi&quot;, &quot;jiào&quot; and &quot;ràng&quot;. Of these causative markers, only &quot;gěi&quot; can appear alone without a specified agent. The construction with a passive marker is normally used only when there is a sense of misfortune or adversity. The passive marker and agent occupy the typical adverbial position before the verb. See the Negation section for more. Some examples:

==Negation==
The most commonly used negating element is &quot;bù&quot; (), pronounced with second tone when followed by a fourth tone. This can be placed before a verb, preposition or adverb to negate it. For example: &quot;I don&#x27;t eat chicken&quot; (). For the double-verb negative construction with &quot;bù&quot;, see Complement of result, below. However, the verb &quot;yǒu&quot; ()—which can mean either possession, or &quot;there is/are&quot; in existential clauses—is negated using &quot;méi&quot; () to produce &quot;méiyǒu&quot; ().

For negation of a verb intended to denote a completed event, &quot;méi&quot; or &quot;méiyǒu&quot; is used instead of &quot;bù&quot; (), and the aspect marker &quot;le&quot; () is then omitted. Also, &quot;méi[yǒu]&quot; is used to negate verbs that take the aspect marker &quot;guo&quot; (); in this case the aspect marker is not omitted.

In coverb constructions, the negator may come before the coverb (preposition) or before the full verb, the latter being more emphatic. In constructions with a passive marker, the negator precedes that marker; similarly, in comparative constructions, &quot;the negator precedes the &quot;bǐ&quot; phrase&quot;Not clear (unless the verb is further qualified by &quot;gèng&quot; (, &quot;even more&quot;), in which case the negator may follow the &quot;gèng&quot; to produce the meaning &quot;even less&quot;).

The negator &quot;bié&quot; () precedes the verb in negative commands and negative requests, such as in phrases meaning &quot;don&#x27;t ...&quot;, &quot;please don&#x27;t ...&quot;.

The negator &quot;wèi&quot; () means &quot;not yet&quot;. Other items used as negating elements in certain compound words include &quot;wú&quot; (),&quot;wù&quot; (), &quot;miǎn&quot; () and &quot;fēi&quot; ().

A double negative makes a positive, as in sentences like &quot;wǒ bú shì bù xǐhuān tā&quot; (, &quot;It&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t like her&quot; ). For this use of &quot;shì&quot; (), see the Cleft sentences section.

==Questions==
In &quot;wh&quot;-questions in Chinese, the question word is not fronted. Instead, it stays in the position in the sentence that would be occupied by the item being asked about. For example, &quot;What did you say?&quot; is phrased as &quot;nǐ shuō shé[n]me&quot; (, literally &quot;you say what&quot;). The word &quot;shénme&quot; (, &quot;what&quot; or &quot;which&quot;), remains in the object position after the verb.

Other interrogative words include:
*&quot;Who&quot;: &quot;shuí/shéi&quot; ()
*&quot;What&quot;: &quot;shénme&quot; (); &quot;shá&quot; (, used informally)
*&quot;Where&quot;: &quot;nǎr&quot; (); &quot;nǎlǐ&quot; (); &quot;héchù&quot; ()
*&quot;When&quot;: &quot;shénme shíhòu&quot; (); &quot;héshí&quot; ()
*&quot;Which&quot;: &quot;nǎ&quot; ()
**When used to mean &quot;which ones&quot;, &quot;nǎ&quot; is used with a classifier and noun, or with &quot;xiē&quot; () and noun. The noun may be omitted if understood through context.
*&quot;Why&quot;: &quot;wèishé[n]me&quot; (); &quot;gànmá&quot; ()
*&quot;How many&quot;: &quot;duōshǎo&quot; ()
**When the number is quite small, &quot;jǐ&quot; () is used, followed by a classifier.
*&quot;How&quot;: &quot;zěnme[yang]&quot; (); &quot;rúhé&quot; ().

Disjunctive questions can be made using the word &quot;háishì&quot; () between the options, like English &quot;or&quot;. This differs from the word for &quot;or&quot; in statements, which is &quot;huòzhě&quot; ().

Yes–no questions can be formed using the sentence-final particle &quot;ma&quot; (), with word order otherwise the same as in a statement. For example, &quot;nǐ chī jī ma?&quot; (, &quot;Do you eat chicken?&quot;).

An alternative is the A-not-A construction, using phrases like &quot;chī bu chī&quot; (, &quot;eat or not eat&quot;). With two-syllable verbs, sometimes only the first syllable is repeated: &quot;xǐ-bu-xǐhuān&quot; ( , &quot;like or not like&quot;), from &quot;xǐhuān&quot; (, &quot;like&quot;). It is also possible to use the A-not-A construction with prepositions (coverbs) and phrases headed by them, as with full verbs.

The negator &quot;méi&quot; () can be used rather than &quot;bù&quot; in the A-not-A construction when referring to a completed event, but if it occurs at the end of the sentence—i.e. the repetition is omitted—the full form &quot;méiyǒu&quot; () must appear.

For answering yes–no questions, Chinese has words that may be used like the English &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot; – &quot;duì&quot; () or &quot;shì de&quot; () for &quot;yes&quot;; &quot;bù&quot; () for &quot;no&quot; – but these are not often used for this purpose; it is more common to repeat the verb or verb phrase (or entire sentence), negating it if applicable.

==Imperatives==
Second-person imperative sentences are formed in the same way as statements, and like in English, the subject &quot;you&quot; is often omitted.

Orders may be softened by preceding them with an element such as &quot;qǐng&quot; (, &quot;to ask&quot;), in this use equivalent to English &quot;please&quot;. See Particles for more. The sentence-final particle &quot;ba&quot; () can be used to form first-person imperatives, equivalent to &quot;let&#x27;s...&quot;.

== Serial verb constructions ==
Chinese makes frequent use of serial verb constructions, or verb stacking, where two or more verbs or verb phrases are concatenated together. This frequently involves either verbal complements appearing after the main verb, or coverb phrases appearing before the main verb, but other variations of the construction occur as well.

=== Auxiliaries ===
A main verb may be preceded by an auxiliary verb, as in English. Chinese auxiliaries include &quot;néng&quot; and &quot;nénggòu&quot; ( and , &quot;can&quot;); &quot;huì&quot; (, &quot;know how to&quot;); &quot;kéyǐ&quot; (, &quot;may&quot;); &quot;gǎn&quot; (, &quot;dare&quot;); &quot;kěn&quot; (, &quot;be willing to&quot;); &quot;yīnggāi&quot; (, &quot;should&quot;); &quot;bìxū&quot; (, &quot;must&quot;); etc. The auxiliary normally follows an adverb, if present. In shortened sentences an auxiliary may be used without a main verb, analogously to English sentences such as &quot;I can.&quot;

=== Verbal complements ===
The active verb of a sentence may be suffixed with a second verb, which usually indicates either the result of the first action, or the direction in which it took the subject. When such information is applicable, it is generally considered mandatory. The phenomenon is sometimes called &quot;double verbs&quot;.

==== Complement of result ====
A complement of result, or resultative complement () is a verbal suffix which indicates the outcome, or possible outcome, of the action indicated by the main verb. In the following examples, the main verb is &quot;tīng&quot; ( &quot;to listen&quot;), and the complement of result is &quot;dǒng&quot; (, &quot;to understand/to know&quot;).

Since they indicate an absolute result, such double verbs necessarily represent a completed action, and are thus negated using &quot;méi&quot; ():

The morpheme &quot;de&quot; () is placed between the double verbs to indicate possibility or ability. This is not possible with &quot;restrictive&quot; resultative compounds such as &quot;jiéshěng&quot; (, literally &quot;reduce-save&quot;, meaning &quot;to save, economize&quot;).

This is equivalent in meaning to &quot;néng tīng dǒng&quot; (), using the auxiliary &quot;néng&quot; (), equivalent to &quot;may&quot; or &quot;can&quot;.

To negate the above construction, &quot;de&quot; () is replaced by &quot;bù&quot; ():

With some verbs, the addition of &quot;bù&quot; and a particular complement of result is the standard method of negation. In many cases the complement is &quot;liǎo&quot;, represented by the same character as the perfective or modal particle &quot;le&quot; (). This verb means &quot;to finish&quot;, but when used as a complement for negation purposes it may merely indicate inability. For example: &quot;shòu bù liǎo&quot; (, &quot;to be unable to tolerate&quot;).

The complement of result is a highly productive and frequently used construction. Sometimes it develops into idiomatic phrases, as in &quot;è sǐ le&quot; (, literally &quot;hungry-until-die already&quot;, meaning &quot;to be starving&quot;) and &quot;qì sǐ le&quot; (, literally &quot;mad-until-die already&quot;, meaning &quot;to be extremely angry&quot;). The phrases for &quot;hatred&quot; (), &quot;excuse me&quot; (), and &quot;too expensive to buy&quot; () all use the character &quot;qǐ&quot; (, &quot;to rise up&quot;) as a complement of result, but their meanings are not obviously related to that meaning. This is partially the result of metaphorical construction, where &quot;kànbùqǐ&quot; () literally means &quot;to be unable to look up to&quot;; and &quot;duìbùqǐ&quot; () means &quot;to be unable to face someone&quot;.

Some more examples of resultative complements, used in complete sentences:

Double-verb construction where the second verb, &quot;break&quot;, is a suffix to the first, and indicates what happens to the object as a result of the action.

Another double-verb where the second verb, &quot;understand&quot;, suffixes the first and clarifies the possibility and success of the relevant action.

==== Complement of direction ====
A complement of direction, or directional complement () indicates the direction of an action involving movement. The simplest directional complements are &quot;qù&quot; (, &quot;to go&quot;) and &quot;lái&quot; (, &quot;to come&quot;), which may be added after a verb to indicate movement away from or towards the speaker, respectively. These may form compounds with other verbs that further specify the direction, such as &quot;shàng qù&quot; (, &quot;to go up&quot;), &quot;gùo lái&quot; (, &quot;to come over&quot;), which may then be added to another verb, such as &quot;zǒu&quot; (, &quot;to walk&quot;), as in &quot;zǒu gùo qù&quot; (, &quot;to walk over&quot;). Another example, in a whole sentence:
: The directional suffixes indicate &quot;up&quot; and &quot;towards&quot;.

If the preceding verb has an object, the object may be placed either before or after the directional complement(s), or even between two directional complements, provided the second of these is not &quot;qù&quot; ().

The structure with inserted &quot;de&quot; or &quot;bù&quot; is not normally used with this type of double verb. There are exceptions, such as &quot;to be unable to get out of bed&quot; ( or ).

=== Coverbs ===
Chinese has a class of words, called coverbs, which in some respects resemble both verbs and prepositions. They appear with a following object (or complement), and generally denote relationships that would be expressed by prepositions (or postpositions) in other languages. However, they are often considered to be lexically verbs, and some of them can also function as full verbs. When a coverb phrase appears in a sentence together with a main verb phrase, the result is essentially a type of serial verb construction. The coverb phrase, being an adverbial, precedes the main verb in most cases. For instance:

Here the main verb is &quot;zhǎo&quot; (, &quot;find&quot;), and &quot;bāng&quot; () is a coverb. Here &quot;bāng&quot; corresponds to the English preposition &quot;for&quot;, even though in other contexts it might be used as a full verb meaning &quot;help&quot;.

Here there are three coverbs: &quot;zuò&quot; ( &quot;by&quot;), &quot;cóng&quot; (, &quot;from&quot;), and &quot;dào&quot; (, &quot;to&quot;). The words &quot;zuò&quot; and &quot;dào&quot; can also be verbs, meaning &quot;sit&quot; and &quot;arrive [at]&quot; respectively. However, &quot;cóng&quot; is not normally used as a full verb.

A very common coverb that can also be used as a main verb is &quot;zài&quot; (), as described in the Locative phrases section. Another example is &quot;gěi&quot; (), which as a verb means &quot;give&quot;. As a preposition, &quot;gěi&quot; may mean &quot;for&quot;, or &quot;to&quot; when marking an indirect object or in certain other expressions.

Because coverbs essentially function as prepositions, they can also be referred to simply as prepositions. In Chinese they are called &quot;jiè cí&quot; (), a term which generally corresponds to &quot;preposition&quot;, or more generally, &quot;adposition&quot;. The situation is complicated somewhat by the fact that location markers—which also have meanings similar to those of certain English prepositions—are often called &quot;postpositions&quot;.

Coverbs normally cannot take aspect markers, although some of them form fixed compounds together with such markers, such as &quot;gēnzhe&quot; (), &quot;ànzhe&quot; (, &quot;according to&quot;), &quot;yánzhe&quot; (, &quot;along&quot;), and &quot;wèile&quot; ( &quot;for&quot;).

===Other cases===
Serial verb constructions can also consist of two consecutive verb phrases with parallel meaning, such as &quot;hē kāfēi kàn bào&quot;, &quot;drink coffee and read the paper&quot; (). Each verb may independently be negated or given the &quot;le&quot; aspect marker. If both verbs would have the same object, it is omitted the second time.

Consecutive verb phrases may also be used to indicate consecutive events. Use of the &quot;le&quot; aspect marker with the first verb may imply that this is the main verb of the sentence, the second verb phrase merely indicating the purpose. Use of this &quot;le&quot; with the second verb changes this emphasis, and may require a sentence-final &quot;le&quot; particle in addition. On the other hand, the progressive aspect marker &quot;zài&quot; () may be applied to the first verb, but not normally the second alone. The word &quot;qù&quot; (, &quot;go&quot;) or &quot;lái&quot; (, &quot;come&quot;) may be inserted between the two verb phrases, meaning &quot;in order to&quot;.

For constructions with consecutive verb phrases containing the same verb, see under Adverbs. For immediate repetition of a verb, see Reduplication and Aspects.

Another case is the causative or pivotal construction. Here the object of one verb also serves as the subject of the following verb. The first verb may be something like &quot;gěi&quot; (, &quot;allow&quot;, or &quot;give&quot; in other contexts), &quot;ràng&quot; (, &quot;let&quot;), &quot;jiào&quot; (, &quot;order&quot; or &quot;call&quot;) or &quot;shǐ&quot; (, &quot;make, compel&quot;), &quot;qǐng&quot; (, &quot;invite&quot;), or &quot;lìng&quot; (, &quot;command&quot;). Some of these cannot take an aspect marker such as &quot;le&quot; when used in this construction, like &quot;lìng&quot;, &quot;ràng&quot;, &quot;shǐ&quot;. Sentences of this type often parallel the equivalent English pattern, except that English may insert the infinitive marker &quot;to&quot;. In the following example the construction is used twice:

== Particles ==
Chinese has a number of sentence-final particles – these are weak syllables, spoken with neutral tone, and placed at the end of the sentence to which they refer. They are often called modal particles or &quot;yǔqì zhùcí&quot; (), as they serve chiefly to express grammatical mood, or how the sentence relates to reality and/or intent. They include:

* &quot;ma&quot; (), which changes a statement into a yes–no question
* &quot;ne&quot; (), which expresses surprise, produces a question &quot;with expectation&quot;, or expresses a currently ongoing event when answering a question
* &quot;ba&quot; (), which serves as a tag question, e.g. &quot;don&#x27;t you think so?&quot;; produces a suggestion e.g. &quot;let&#x27;s...&quot;; or lessens certainty of a decision.
* &quot;a&quot; (), which reduces forcefulness, particularly of an order or question. It can also be used to add positive connotation to certain phrases or inject uncertainty when responding to a question.
* &quot;ou&quot; (), which signals a friendly warning
* &quot;zhe&quot; (), which marks the inchoative aspect, or need for change of state, in imperative sentences. Compare the imperfective aspect marker &quot;zhe&quot; in the section above) 
* &quot;le&quot; (), which marks a &quot;currently relevant state&quot;. This precedes any other sentence-final particles, and can combine with &quot;a&quot; () to produce &quot;la&quot; (); and with &quot;ou&quot; () to produce &quot;lou&quot; ().

This sentence-final &quot;le&quot; () should be distinguished from the verb suffix &quot;le&quot; () discussed in the Aspects section. Whereas the sentence-final particle is sometimes described as an inceptive or as a marker of perfect aspect, the verb suffix is described as a marker of perfective aspect. Some examples of its use:

The position of &quot;le&quot; in this example emphasizes his present status as a soldier, rather than the event of becoming. Compare with the post-verbal &quot;le&quot; example given in the Aspects section, &quot;wǒ dāng le bīng&quot;. However, when answering a question, the ending should be 呢 instead of 了. For example, to answer a question like &quot;你现在做什么工作？&quot; (What&#x27;s your job now?), instead of using &quot;le&quot;, a more appropriate answer should be 

Compared with the post-verbal &quot;le&quot; and &quot;guo&quot; examples, this places the focus on the number three, and does not specify whether he is going to continue watching more games.

The two uses of &quot;le&quot; may in fact be traced back to two entirely different words. The fact that they are now written the same way in Mandarin can cause ambiguity, particularly when the verb is not followed by an object. Consider the following sentence:

This &quot;le&quot; might be interpreted as either the suffixal perfective marker or the sentence-final perfect marker. In the former case it might mean &quot;mother has come&quot;, as in she has just arrived at the door, while in the latter it might mean &quot;mother is coming!&quot;, and the speaker wants to inform others of this fact. It is even possible for the two kinds of &quot;le&quot; to co-occur:

Without the first &quot;le&quot;, the sentence could again mean &quot;he has eaten&quot;, or it could mean &quot;he wants to eat now&quot;. Without the final &quot;le&quot; the sentence would be ungrammatical without appropriate context, as perfective &quot;le&quot; cannot appear in a semantically unbounded sentence.

===Plural===
Chinese nouns and other parts of speech are not generally marked for number, meaning that plural forms are mostly the same as the singular. However, there is a plural marker &quot;men&quot; (), which has limited usage. It is used with personal pronouns, as in &quot;wǒmen&quot; (, &quot;we&quot; or &quot;us&quot;), derived from &quot;wǒ&quot; (, &quot;I, me&quot;). It can be used with nouns representing humans, most commonly those with two syllables, like in &quot;péngyoumen&quot; (, &quot;friends&quot;), from &quot;péngyou&quot; (, &quot;friend&quot;). Its use in such cases is optional. It is never used when the noun has indefinite reference, or when it is qualified by a numeral.

The demonstrative pronouns &quot;zhè&quot; (, &quot;this&quot;), and &quot;nà&quot; (, &quot;that&quot;) may be optionally pluralized by the addition of &quot;xiē&quot; (，&quot;few&quot;), making &quot;zhèxiē&quot; (, &quot;these&quot;) and &quot;nàxiē&quot; (, &quot;those&quot;).

==Cleft sentences==
There is a construction in Chinese known as the &quot;shì ... [de]&quot; construction, which produces what may be called cleft sentences. The copula &quot;shì&quot; () is placed before the element of the sentence which is to be emphasized, and the optional possessive particle &quot;de&quot; () is placed at the end of the sentence if the sentence ends in a verb, or after the last verb of the sentence if the sentence ends with a complement of the verb. For example:

Example with a sentence that ends with a complement:

If an object following the verb is to be emphasized in this construction, the &quot;shì&quot; precedes the object, and the &quot;de&quot; comes after the verb and before the &quot;shì&quot;.

Sentences with similar meaning can be produced using relative clauses. These may be called pseudo-cleft sentences.

==Conjunctions==
Chinese has various conjunctions () such as &quot;hé&quot; (, &quot;and&quot;), &quot;dànshì&quot; (, &quot;but&quot;), &quot;huòzhě&quot; (, &quot;or&quot;), etc. However Chinese quite often uses no conjunction where English would have &quot;and&quot;.

Two or more nouns may be joined by the conjunctions &quot;hé&quot; (, &quot;and&quot;) or &quot;huò&quot; ( &quot;or&quot;); for example &quot;dāo hé chā&quot; (, &quot;knife and fork&quot;), &quot;gǒu huò māo&quot; (, &quot;dog or cat&quot;).

Certain adverbs are often used as correlative conjunctions, where correlating words appear in each of the linked clauses, such as &quot;búdàn ... érqiě&quot; (), &quot;suīrán ... háishì&quot; (), &quot;yīnwèi ... suǒyǐ&quot; (). Such connectors may appear at the start of a clause or before the verb phrase.

Similarly, words like &quot;jìrán&quot; (, &quot;since/in response to&quot;), &quot;rúguǒ&quot; () or &quot;jiǎrú&quot; () &quot;if&quot;, &quot;zhǐyào&quot; ( &quot;provided that&quot;) correlate with an adverb &quot;jiù&quot; (, &quot;then&quot;) or &quot;yě&quot; (, &quot;also&quot;) in the main clause, to form conditional sentences.

In some cases, the same word may be repeated when connecting items; these include &quot;yòu ... yòu ...&quot; (, &quot;both ... and ...&quot;), &quot;yībiān ... yībiān ...&quot; (, &quot;... while ...&quot;), and &quot;yuè ... yuè ...&quot; (, &quot;the more ..., the more ...&quot;).

Conjunctions of time such as &quot;when&quot; may be translated with a construction that corresponds to something like &quot;at the time (+relative clause)&quot;, where as usual, the Chinese relative clause comes before the noun (&quot;time&quot; in this case). For example:

Variants include &quot;dāng ... yǐqián&quot; ( &quot;before ...&quot;) and &quot;dāng ... yǐhòu&quot; (, &quot;after ...&quot;), which do not use the relative marker &quot;de&quot;. In all of these cases, the initial &quot;dāng&quot; may be replaced by &quot;zài&quot; (), or may be omitted. There are also similar constructions for conditionals: &quot;rúguǒ /jiǎrú/zhǐyào ... dehuà&quot; (, &quot;if ... then&quot;), where &quot;huà&quot; () literally means &quot;narrative, story&quot;.

<text>Michael Donald Kirby (born 18 March 1939) is an Australian jurist and academic who is a former Justice of the High Court of Australia, serving from 1996 to 2009. He has remained active in retirement; in May 2013 he was appointed by the United Nations Human Rights Council to lead an inquiry into human rights abuses in North Korea, which reported in February 2014.

==Early life and education==
Michael Donald Kirby was born on 18 March 1939 at Crown Street Women&#x27;s Hospital to Donald and Jean Langmore (née Knowles) Kirby. He was the eldest of five siblings, followed by twins Donald William and David Charles (the latter died at 18 months from pneumonia), David, and Diana Margaret. In 1943 his grandmother, Norma Gray, remarried and her second husband was Jack Simpson, National Treasurer of the Australian Communist Party. Although Kirby came to admire Simpson, neither he nor his immediate family embraced the ideology. His father supported the Australian Labor Party but never became a member. His mother, it is believed, voted for Robert Menzies (Liberal Party).

Kirby attended state schools, commencing at North Strathfield Public School, followed by Summer Hill Public School for Opportunity Classes, and then Fort Street High School (then Fort Street Boys High School) in Sydney.

After graduating from high school, Kirby later attended the University of Sydney, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts (1959), Bachelor of Laws (1962), Bachelor of Economics (1965), and Master of Laws (First-Class Honours) (1967). At university, Kirby was elected President of the University of Sydney Students&#x27; Representative Council (1962–1963) and President of the University of Sydney Union (1965).

==Career==
Kirby commenced his legal career as an articled clerk for Ramon Burke at the small Sydney firm M. A. Simon and Co., assisting with Compensation Commission cases for plaintiffs. The firm had two principals, Maurice Arthur Simon and Ramon Burke, later a judge of the Compensation Court of New South Wales. After graduation, he moved to Hickson, Lakeman and Holcombe (now Hicksons Lawyers) as a solicitor, practising in insurance litigation and property disputes. He was a partner of the firm from 1963 to 1967.

Kirby was admitted to the New South Wales Bar in 1967.

==Judicial appointment==
Kirby became the youngest man appointed to federal judicial office in 1975, when he was appointed Deputy President of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, a tribunal which adjudicated labour disputes. Later in 1984, the Hon Peter Gray took Kirby&#x27;s mantle as the youngest man appointed to federal judicial office at 38 years old.

In 1983, Kirby was appointed a judge in the Federal Court of Australia, before an appointment as President of the New South Wales Court of Appeal, a superior court in that state&#x27;s legal system, in 1984. During that period, he was also the President of the Court of Appeal of Solomon Islands from 1995 to 1996.

From 1984 until 1993, Kirby held the position of Chancellor at Macquarie University.

In February 1996, Kirby was appointed to the High Court of Australia. He has served on many other boards and committees, notably the Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) and the CSIRO. He is Patron of the Friends of Libraries Australia (FOLA) and many other bodies.

===Dissent rate===
Kirby was often at odds with his colleagues in the Gleeson High Court, and sometimes as the sole dissenter. In 2004, he delivered a dissenting opinion on nearly 40% of the matters in which he participated, almost twice as many as any of his High Court colleagues; in constitutional cases, his rate of dissent was more than 50%. His notable dissent rate has earned him the nickname the &quot;Great Dissenter&quot;. Future High Court Justices who have been considered in contention for the title include Dyson Heydon and Patrick Keane, though neither have dissent rates as high as Kirby&#x27;s.

Legal researchers Andrew Lynch and George Williams observed that &quot;even allowing for 2004 as a year in which Kirby had a particularly high level of explicit disagreement with a majority of his colleagues, it is neither premature nor unfair to say that in the frequency of his dissent, his Honour has long since eclipsed any other Justice in the history of the Court... [Kirby] has broken away to claim a position of outsider on the Court which seems unlikely to pass with future years&quot;.

Kirby has responded, stating that &quot;on their own, statistics tell little&quot;; to understand Kirby&#x27;s rate of dissent, it is necessary to examine what his disagreements have been &quot;about&quot; and consider whom he has dissented &quot;from&quot;. Kirby explains &quot;there have always been divisions, reflecting the different philosophies and perspectives of the office-holders&quot;, and that throughout the High Court&#x27;s history, many dissenting opinions have ultimately been adopted as good law. Further, Kirby argues that the rate of dissent, if seen within its context, is relatively small. Cases heard before the full bench of the High Court have proceeded through a series of lower courts and special leave hearings. They are thus likely to test the boundaries of the existing law, and raise opposing, though no less valid, views of the law.

===Retirement and post-retirement life===
Kirby retired from the High Court on 2 February 2009, shortly before reaching the constitutionally mandatory retirement age of 70, and was succeeded by Virginia Bell.

After his retirement, Kirby was appointed to several honorary academic roles at Australian universities. These included appointments to: the Australian National University (ANU) in Canberra, as distinguished visiting fellow in February 2009; the University of New South Wales Faculty of Law as visiting professorial fellow in March 2009; the University of Tasmania Faculty of Law as adjunct professor in July 2009; and Victoria University as an adjunct professor. He has been appointed honorary visiting professor by 12 universities.

==Jurisprudence==
In November 2003, at the University of Exeter, Kirby delivered the Hamlyn Lectures on the subject of judicial activism. Rejecting the doctrine of strict constructionism, Kirby declared that:Clearly it would be wrong for a judge to set out in pursuit of a personal policy agenda and hang the law. Yet it would also be wrong, and futile, for a judge to pretend that the solutions to all of the complex problems of the law today, unresolved by incontestably clear and applicable texts, can be answered by the application of nothing more than purely verbal reasoning and strict logic to words written by judges in earlier times about the problems they then faced... contrary to myth, judges do more than simply apply law. They have a role in making it and always have.These lectures sparked a debate in the Australian media, echoing an ongoing debate in the United States, as to whether judges have the right to interpret the law in the light of its intent and considerations of natural law or whether judges should (or can) simply follow the letter of the law, leaving questions of its intent and underlying principles to elected representatives.

Following increasing public scrutiny into, and characterisations of, High Court judgments as &#x27;activist&#x27; in the late 1990s, a number of members of the Court agreed to give interviews in the 1998 documentary &quot;The Highest Court&quot;. Kirby was one of the few members of the Court who did not take part. An insight into Kirby&#x27;s jurisprudence and judicial style can be found in his engagement with Gavin Griffith QC in &quot;Kruger v Commonwealth,&quot; which is featured in the documentary.

He had also addressed this topic in a 1997 speech to the Bar Association of India, in which he spoke approvingly of &quot;a kind of &#x27;judicial activism&#x27; that is often in tune with the deeply felt emotions of ordinary citizens&quot;. Nonetheless, Kirby is critical of the term &quot;judicial activism&quot; when it is used as &quot;code language&quot;, applied chiefly by conservative commentators to views and to people with which they disagree.

==UN Report into North Korean Human Rights Abuses==

In May 2013, the United Nations Human Rights Council appointed Kirby to lead a commission of inquiry into human rights abuses in North Korea, with Sonja Biserko and Marzuki Darusman. The report is dated 7 February 2014. It identifies &quot;[s]ystematic, widespread and gross human rights violations&quot; by a &quot;totalitarian state&quot;, including &quot;unspeakable atrocities&quot; in the political prison camps. It makes many recommendations for internal reform and international action, including prosecution of the North Korean leadership in the International Criminal Court or before an ad hoc international tribunal. North Korea refused all co-operation with the inquiry and, just before the report was launched, issued a statement claiming that it was based upon &quot;faked&quot; material.

As the report was being finalised, on 20 January 2014 Kirby wrote to North Korea&#x27;s Supreme Leader, Kim Jong-un, informing him that he would be advising the United Nations to formally refer the situation in North Korea to the International Criminal Court, where Kim could be tried for his personal culpability as head of state and leader of the military, but proposing that the commission come to Pyongyang to discuss the issues with the North Korean government.
At a press conference to launch the report, on 17 February 2014, Kirby said that there were &quot;many parallels&quot; between the evidence he had heard and crimes committed by the Nazis and their allies in the Second World War. On 22 April 2014 the official news agency of North Korea, KCNA, claimed that the &quot;fabrications&quot; are meant to &quot;undermine the ideology and social system of the DPRK&quot;. The KCNA also criticised Kirby for being gay: &quot;it is ridiculous for such gay to sponsor dealing with others&#x27; human rights issue&quot;.

Kirby remained involved in advocacy on issues of human rights in North Korea and the abduction of Japanese citizens, participating in symposia organised by the Japanese government in Geneva (September 2014) with a UN Human Rights Council Panel and in Tokyo (December 2015). In May 2017, he was awarded the Order of the Rising Sun, Gold and Silver Star, &quot;in recognition of his contribution to promoting understanding of the situation of Human Rights in North Korea in the international society including the issue of the abductions of Japanese nationals&quot;. The honour was presented by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe and Kirby received the additional honour of an audience with Akihito, the Emperor of Japan, at the Imperial Palace in Tokyo. Kirby described the awarding of the honour to himself and former United Nations special rapporteur Marzuki Darusman as &quot;a clear signal that the Japanese Government has not abandoned its determination to pursue the crime against humanity involved in the abductions in the international community and other crimes revealed in our report.&quot;

In January 2015, one of the key witnesses to Kirby&#x27;s inquiry, Shin Dong Hyuk, admitted that he had given false testimony. Having sworn that he had spent his childhood entirely in the notorious Camp 14, he changed his story to say that he had been transferred at the age of six to the nearby Camp 18. He said that he had changed his story after seeing his father (whom he had thought to be dead) on television. Shin apologised but gave few details.

==Public life==
Michael Kirby was among the founders of Australians for Constitutional Monarchy, an organisation which played a prominent part in the 1999 republic referendum.

Kirby has a reputation as an eloquent and powerful orator, having given a vast number of speeches over his career on a diverse range of topics.

The annual Michael Kirby Lecture and Dinner has been conducted by the Faculty of Law and Justice, Southern Cross University, since 2007.

Kirby is a fellow of the Hastings Center, an independent bioethics research institution in the United States. In 2006, he was elected an Honorary Bencher of the Inner Temple in London. In the same year, the Australian Academy of the Humanities elected him an Honorary Fellow.

In July 2009, Kirby accepted a position as adjunct professor in law at the University of Tasmania Faculty of Law. He is also the (founding) Chairman of the Editorial Board of the &quot;Journal of Law, Information &amp; Science&quot;, which is published by that faculty; a position he has held since 1981.

Since 2010, Kirby has been one of the 11 members of the Eminent Persons Group set up to advise on reform of the Commonwealth of Nations.

In 2011, Kirby, suggested that &quot;There is nothing so powerful in the world as an idea whose time has come, and animal protection is just such an idea&quot;, becoming a patron of Voiceless, an animal protection institute.

Kirby is an avid supporter of the arts. He has appeared in the &quot;University of Queensland Law Revue&quot; twice since 2004. In May 2007, he appeared in Melbourne alongside hip-hop impresario Elf Tranzporter at the launch of Victorian Arts Law Week, performing a rap of W. B. Yeats&#x27;s poetry. 

==Personal life==
Kirby has been openly gay since around 1984. He has lived since 1969 with Johan van Vloten, who migrated to Australia from the Netherlands in 1963, and in 1999 Kirby listed him as his long-term partner in &quot;Who&#x27;s Who in Australia&quot;. Van Vloten helped people living with HIV and Kirby became involved in the issue both within Australia and internationally. Kirby has often spoken publicly in support of gay rights. While President of the International Commission of Jurists he encouraged that organisation to give more consideration to human sexuality as an aspect of human rights, and as an Anglican he has expressed disappointment at his church&#x27;s stance on gay rights. In 2002, at the Sydney Gay Games VI, Kirby was the keynote speaker at the opening ceremony. &quot;The movement for equality is unstoppable. Its message will eventually reach the four corners of the world,&quot; he told a crowd of 35,000. In 2006, he attended the International Conference on LGBT Human Rights in Montreal, presiding over the Asia-Pacific Plenary.

Kirby is religious, describing himself as a &quot;Protestant Anglican Christian&quot; and criticising clerical opposition to homosexuality: &quot;I don&#x27;t want any old gent in frocks to take my religion from me and to me it is still an important aspect of my life&quot;. In November 2007, he accused the Anglican and Catholic archbishops of Sydney, Peter Jensen and George Pell respectively, of hindering the acceptance of gay people in Australian society, stating that homophobia was &quot;reinforced even to this day by religious instruction, and it has to be said, religious instruction from the two archbishops of Sydney&quot;. Kirby also expressed disappointment in his &quot;minority of one&quot; status among his High Court of Australia colleagues, and conceded that &quot;some of the justices perhaps have less liberal views than I have&quot;.

Kirby was selected by readers of samesame.com.au as one of the 25 most influential gay or lesbian Australians in every year that this list was published, from 2007 to 2010.

Kirby and van Vloten married on 11 February 2019, the 50th anniversary of their first meeting.

===Family===
Kirby&#x27;s father, Donald, was the only child of Alma Caroline (Norma) Grey, a single working mother of English—Irish descent. Norma became pregnant at 15 with Donald Kirby while in a relationship with a then-17-year-old Victor Kirby, a Catholic who had arrived after the Great Famine. Norma&#x27;s parents were John Emmanuel Gray, an English brick- and boiler- maker and Annie Lyons. Annie&#x27;s father, Harry Lyons, had emigrated from Dublin to Sydney in the 1850s, following the Great Famine and her mother&#x27;s name was Mary.

His mother, Jean Langmore Knowles, was born in Berwick, Victoria to William Knowles, an Ulster Scot from Ballymena, and Margaret, as one of four daughters. Jean was a graduate of Sydney Girls High School, obtaining a Leaving Certificate, a rarity for a woman at that time, and worked in numerous paid jobs by virtue of her own successes and ability. Donald Kirby, aged 16, and Jean Knowles first met at Saint Martin&#x27;s Anglican Church, Kensington. Donald attended Sydney Technical School in Ultimo, and afterwards worked as a general assistant, then tool and machinery salesman, at a hardware firm. The two became engaged on Jean&#x27;s 21st birthday and were married in March 1937, a month after Donald turned 21; their first home was in Bloomfield Street, South Coogee.

Michael Kirby&#x27;s brothers have also been lawyers: David was a judge of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, retiring in 2011; Donald was a solicitor until retiring in 2006. Sister Diana was a nurse in the Colorectal Unit of the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in Sydney, retiring in 2011.

<text>The interrobang (), also known as the interabang (often represented by any of the following: ?!, !?, ?!?, ?!!, !?? or !?!), is an unconventional punctuation mark intended to combine the functions of the question mark (also known as the interrogative point) and the exclamation mark (also known in the jargon of printers and programmers as a &quot;bang&quot;). The glyph is a ligature of these two marks and was first proposed in 1962 by Martin K. Speckter.

==Application==
A sentence ending with an interrobang states a question in an excited manner, expresses excitement, disbelief or confusion in the form of a question, or asks a rhetorical question.

For example: 
* You call that a hat‽
* Are you &quot;out of your mind&quot;‽
* The dingo ate your baby‽

Writers using informal language may use several alternating question marks and exclamation marks for even more emphasis. However, this is regarded as poor style in formal writing.
==History==

Historically, writers have used multiple consecutive punctuation marks to end a sentence expressing both surprise and question.
===Invention===
American Martin K. Speckter (June 14, 1915 – February 14, 1988) conceptualized the interrobang in 1962. As the head of an advertising agency, Speckter believed that advertisements would look better if copywriters conveyed surprised rhetorical questions using a single mark. He proposed the concept of a single punctuation mark in an article in the magazine &quot;TYPEtalks&quot;. Speckter solicited possible names for the new character from readers. Contenders included &quot;exclamaquest&quot;, and &quot;exclarotive&quot;, but he settled on &quot;interrobang&quot;. He chose the name to reference the punctuation marks that inspired it: &quot;interrogatio&quot; is Latin for &quot;rhetorical question&quot; or &quot;cross-examination&quot;; &quot;bang&quot; is printers&#x27; slang for the exclamation mark. Graphic treatments for the new mark were also submitted in response to the article.

===Early interest===
In 1965, Richard Isbell created the Americana typeface for American Type Founders and included the interrobang as one of the characters. In 1968, an interrobang key was available on some Remington typewriters. In the 1970s, replacement interrobang keycaps and typefaces were available for some Smith-Corona typewriters.
The interrobang was in vogue for much of the 1960s; the word &quot;interrobang&quot; appeared in some dictionaries, and the mark was used in magazine and newspaper articles.

===Continued support===
Most fonts do not include the interrobang, but it has not disappeared. Lucida Grande, the default font for many UI elements of legacy versions of Apple&#x27;s OS X operating system, includes the interrobang, and Microsoft provides several versions of the interrobang in the Wingdings 2 character set (on the right bracket and tilde keys on US keyboard layouts), included with Microsoft Office. It was accepted into Unicode and is included in several fonts, including Lucida Sans Unicode, Arial Unicode MS, and Calibri, the default font in the Office 2007, 2010, and 2013 suites.

==Upside-down interrobang ==
An upside-down interrobang (combining ¿ and ¡, Unicode character: ⸘), suitable for starting phrases in Spanish, Galician and Asturian—which use inverted question and exclamation marks—is called an &quot;inverted interrobang&quot; or a &quot;gnaborretni&quot; (&quot;interrobang&quot; spelled backwards), but the latter is rarely used. In current practice, interrobang-like emphatic ambiguity in Hispanic languages is usually achieved by including both sets of punctuation marks one inside the other (&quot;¿¡De verdad!?&quot; or &quot;¡¿De verdad?!&quot; [&quot;Really!?&quot;]). Older usage, still official but not widespread, recommended mixing the punctuation marks: &quot;¡Verdad?&quot; or &quot;¿Verdad!&quot;
==Codepoint==
The symbol is encoded in Unicode at codepoint . The inverted interrobang is at codepoint . Single-character versions of the double-glyph versions are also available at codepoints and .

==Examples of use==
The State Library of New South Wales, in Australia, uses an interrobang as its logo, as does the educational publishing company Pearson, which thus intends to convey &quot;the excitement and fun of learning&quot;.

Chief Judge Frank H. Easterbrook used an interrobang in the 2012 United States Seventh Circuit opinion &quot;Robert F. Booth Trust v. Crowley&quot;.

Australian Federal Court Justice Michael Wigney used an interrobang in the first paragraph of his 2018 judgment in &quot;Faruqi v Latham [2018] FCA 1328&quot; (defamation proceedings between former Federal Opposition Leader Mark Latham and political campaigner and writer Osman Faruqi).

In chess, an interrobang is used to represent a dubious move, one that is questionable but possibly has merits. (See also the evaluation symbols ?! (dubious move) and !? (interesting move).)

<text>An espresso machine brews coffee by forcing pressurized water near boiling point through a &quot;puck&quot; of ground coffee and a filter in order to produce a thick, concentrated coffee called espresso. Multiple machine designs have been created to produce espresso. Several machines share some common elements, such as a grouphead and a portafilter. An espresso machine may also have a steam wand which is used to steam and froth liquids (such as milk) for coffee drinks such as cappuccino and caffè latte.

Espresso machines may be steam-driven, piston-driven, pump-driven or air-pump-driven. Machines may also be manual or automatic.

==History==

===Precursors===
Angelo Moriondo, from Turin, patented a steam-driven &quot;instantaneous&quot; coffee beverage making device in 1884 (No. 33/256). The device is &quot;almost certainly the first Italian bar machine that controlled the supply of steam and water separately through the coffee&quot; and Moriondo is &quot;certainly one of the earliest discoverers of the expresso machine, if not the earliest&quot;. He was granted patent no. 33/256 dated 16 May 1884 (according to the &quot;Bollettino delle privative industriali del Regno d&#x27;Italia&quot;, 2nd Series, Volume 15, Year 1884, pp. 635 – 655). Unlike true espresso machines, it brewed in bulk, not as individual servings.

Seventeen years later, in 1901, Luigi Bezzera, from Milan, devised and patented several improvements to the espresso machine, the first of which was applied for on 19 December 1901. Titled &quot;Innovations in the machinery to prepare and immediately serve coffee beverage&quot;; Patent No. 153/94, 61707, was granted on 5 June 1902. In 1903, the patent was bought by Desiderio Pavoni, who founded the La Pavoni company and began to produce the machine industrially, manufacturing one machine daily in a small workshop in Via Parini, Milan.

==Drive mechanism==

Numerous machine designs have been created to produce espresso. Several machines share some common elements.

Varying the fineness of the grind, the amount of pressure used to tamp the grinds, or the pressure itself can be used to vary the taste of the espresso. Some baristas pull espresso shots directly into a pre-heated demitasse cup or shot glass, to maintain a higher temperature of the espresso.

===Piston-driven===

The piston-driven, or lever-driven, machine was developed in Italy in 1945 by Achille Gaggia, founder of espresso machine manufacturer Gaggia. The design generically uses a lever, pumped by the operator, to pressurize hot water and send it through the coffee grounds. The act of producing a shot of espresso is colloquially termed &quot;pulling&quot; a shot, because these lever-driven espresso machines required pulling a long handle to produce a shot. Lever-driven espresso machines are sometimes called manual espresso machines because of this.

There are two types of lever machines; manual piston and spring piston design. With the manual piston, the operator directly pushes the water through the grounds. In the spring piston design, the operator works to tension a spring, which then delivers the pressure for the espresso (usually 8 to 10 bar; 116 to 145 psi).

===Steam-driven===

A steam-driven unit operates by forcing water through the coffee by using steam or steam pressure. The first espresso machines were steam types, produced when a common boiler was piped to four group heads so that multiple types of coffee could be made at the same time. This design is still used today in lower-cost consumer machines, as it does not need to contain moving parts. Also, steam-driven machines do not produce as high a pressure for extraction compared with pump-driven. This results in the crema, a hallmark of an espresso, being of lower quality.

===Pump-driven===

A refinement of the piston machine is the pump-driven machine, which was introduced in the Faema E61 in 1961, and has become the most popular design in commercial espresso bars. Instead of using manual force, a motor-driven pump provides the force necessary for espresso brewing. Espresso machines are made to accept water directly from a cold water line supply, common in commercial installations, or from a separate tank that must be filled with water by hand. The latter is more common with lower-volume commercial installations and domestic espresso machines. Due to the required high pumping pressure and precision flow control needed, the particular type of electric pumps typically used are known as &quot;solenoid-piston&quot; pumps. These pumps are classified as a positive displacement type (general category) of pump.

Four variants exist in home machines, depending on how brew water and steam are boiled; in discussion these are generally known by acronyms.
;Single boiler (SB): These machines can brew only, and not steam, requiring only a single boiler. They are relatively uncommon, with steam wands being a simple and valued addition.
;Single boiler, dual use (SB/DU): Some home pump espresso machines use a single chamber both to heat water to brewing temperature and to boil water for steaming milk. However, they can perform only one operation at a time, requiring a warm up period between the execution of espresso pull and the milk frothing process. Since the temperature for brewing is less than the temperature for creating steam the machine requires time to make the transition from one mode to the other. Moreover, after the brewing process, a single boiler will expel (usually minor) quantities of water through the steam wand that were left over from brewing, which can cause the steam heated milk to then have a slightly watered down taste. To avoid this, the leftover water needs to be collected from the steam wand before steaming of the milk should begin. SB/DUs are generally found within the lower tiers of enthusiast home models, with steam wands being a simple and valued addition.
;Heat exchanger (HX): Some machines use a single boiler kept at steaming temperature, but water for brewing is passed through a heat exchanger, taking some heat from the steam without rising to the same temperature. Although the water for brewing remains at a lower range than that required for steaming milk, it is still too hot for proper coffee extraction without first cooling; thus this type of machine requires a cooling flush of 4–6 seconds prior to the first espresso pull. Once the machine is dialed into the proper temperature, as many shots can be pulled as required without refreshing. However, if the user leaves the machine idle again for some period, the flushing process will need to be repeated. The HX variety is found in many mid-range machines and many users install thermometers to assist them in dialing in correct temperatures. There is some controversy as to the temperature stability of the brewing water, since it is indirectly converted from steaming temperature to brewing temperature, rather than kept at a brewing temperature. One big advantage of heat exchanger over the other system is the water used for extraction is always fresh from the water source, which can be from the water tank or water network. The stale water gets flushed during the routine flushing. Instead of using stale stagnant water retained within the boiler. The first HX was the Faema E61 of 1961, a design nearly ubiquitous across the semi-automatic market segment of espresso machines.
;Dual boiler (DB): Finally, in some espresso machines for commercial or home use, water for brewing is heated in a separate chamber, which requires two separate boilers. It is primarily found in higher-end machines, but also in some mid-range machines, overlapping with HX. The term &quot;dual boiler&quot; is used narrowly for machines with two separate boilers, and more broadly for what are more properly called &quot;dual heater&quot; (DH) machines, featuring a boiler for brewing and a separate thermoblock (TB) for heating brew water to steaming temperature—opposite to HX machines, where the boiler is at steaming temperature and is &quot;cooled&quot; to brewing temperature. In principle, TB machines yield a more stable brew temperature at the expense of steaming performance and speed, while HX machines yield better steaming at the expense of stable brew temperature. True DB machines provide stable brew temperatures and fast steaming, but are larger and more expensive. The downside is the boiler specifically for brewing espresso consist of mainly stagnant water with little turnover, which repeatedly gets boiled again with little introduction of fresh water. The first DB was the La Marzocco GS of 1970.

==Machine parts==

A grouphead (or group head) is the receiver for the removable portafilter (or group handle). A typical consumer espresso machine normally has only one grouphead, while popular professional machines, such as those used at commercial coffee shops, can contain anywhere from one to seven. During the process of extracting a shot of espresso, hot water is forced through the grouphead under pressure. The grouphead contains many holes (the shower) that attempt to distribute the pressurised water evenly over the surface of the grinds in the portafilter basket and thereby achieve an even cross sectional flow.
A portafilter (or group handle) attaches to the grouphead of semi-automatic and piston-driven espresso machines, and carries a tamped puck of coffee grounds within its basket. It is usually made of brass for better heat retention, and is attached by a plastic or wooden handle. The portafilter forms a seal with the espresso machine&#x27;s gasket, and directs high-pressure hot water through the coffee puck. After-market retailers also sell bottomless portafilters that minimize the espresso&#x27;s contact with any metal. A bottomless portafilter is one tool baristas use to analyze the quality of the coffee grind and the evenness of the extraction and allows for a visual check of &quot;channeling&quot; or the condition in which water is able to pierce a hole in the espresso puck during the brew process leading to poor extraction. Often, baristas use knockboxes to store their spent espresso grounds after they have pulled a shot.

<text>is a form of karate that was founded in 1934 by . Shitō-ryū is synthesis of the Okinawan Shuri-te and Naha-te schools of karate and today is considered one of the four main styles of the art.

== History ==
Kenwa Mabuni (Mabuni Kenwa 摩文仁 賢和) was born in Shuri, Okinawa in 1889. Mabuni was a 17th generation descendant of the warrior Uni Ufugusuku Kenyu. He began his instruction in his home town in the art of at the age of 13, under the tutelage of (1831–1915). He trained diligently for several years, learning many &quot;kata&quot;. It was Itosu who first developed the Pinan kata, which were possibly derived from the &quot;Kusanku&quot; form.

One of his close friends, (founder of Gojū-ryū Karate) introduced Mabuni to another great of that period, . Mabuni began to learn under him. While both Itosu and Higaonna taught a &quot;hard-soft&quot; style of Okinawan &quot;Te&quot;, their methods and emphases were quite distinct: the Itosu syllabus included straight and powerful techniques as exemplified in the Naihanchi and Bassai kata; the Higaonna syllabus stressed circular motion and shorter fighting methods as seen in the kata Seipai and Kururunfa. Shitō-ryū focuses on both hard and soft techniques to this day.

Although he remained true to the teachings of these two masters, Mabuni sought instruction from a number of other teachers, including Seishō Arakaki, Tawada Shimboku, Sueyoshi Jino and Wu Xiangui (a Chinese white crane kung fu master known as Go-Kenki in Japanese). In fact, Mabuni was legendary for his encyclopaedic knowledge of &quot;kata&quot; and their &quot;bunkai&quot; applications. By the 1920s, he was regarded as the foremost authority on Okinawan &quot;kata&quot; and their history and was much sought after as a teacher by his contemporaries. There is even some evidence that his expertise was sought out in China, as well as in Okinawa and mainland Japan. As a police officer, he taught local law enforcement officers and at the behest of his teacher Itosu, began instruction in the various grammar schools in Shuri and Naha.

In an effort to popularize karate in mainland Japan, Mabuni made several trips to Tokyo in 1917 and 1928. Although much that was known as &quot;Te&quot; (lit. &quot;hand&quot;) or karate had been passed down through many generations with jealous secrecy, it was his view that it should be taught to anyone who sought knowledge with honesty and integrity. In fact, many masters of his generation held similar views on the future of Karate: Gichin Funakoshi (founder of Shotokan), another contemporary, had moved to Tokyo in the 1920s to promote his art on the mainland as well.

By 1929, Mabuni had moved to Osaka on the mainland, to become a full-time karate instructor of a style he originally called Hanko-ryū, or &quot;half-hard style&quot;. The name of the style changed to &quot;Shitō-ryū&quot;, in honor of its main influences. Mabuni derived the name for his new style from the first kanji character from the names of his two primary teachers, Itosu and Higaonna (also called Higashionna). With the support of Ryusho Sakagami (1915–1993), he opened a number of Shitō-ryū dojo in the Osaka area, including one at Kansai University and the Japan Karatedō-kai dojo. To this day, the largest contingent of Shitō-ryū practitioners in Japan is centered in the Osaka area.

Mabuni published a number of books on the subject and continued to systematize his instruction method. In his latter years, he developed a number of formal &quot;kata&quot;, such as Aoyagi, for example, which was designed specifically for women&#x27;s self-defense. To this day, Shitō-ryū recognizes the influences of Itosu and Higaonna: the &quot;kata&quot; syllabus of Shitō-ryū is still often listed in such a way as to show the two lineages.

==Succession==
Kenwa Mabuni died on May 23, 1952, and the lineage of the style was disputed between his two sons, Kenzo (1927-2005) and Kenei (1918–2015). Currently, the &quot;Shitō-ryū International Karate-dō Kai&quot; (also known as &quot;Seito Shitō-ryū&quot;) lists Kenzō Mabuni as the second &quot;Sōke&quot; of Shitō-ryū, while the &quot;World Shitō-ryū Karate-dō Federation&quot; (also known as &quot;Shitō-kai Shitō-ryū&quot;) lists Kenei Mabuni. According to Japanese tradition, the eldest son is deemed the successor and inheritor of everything his father owned, including the title of Soke. Kenei Mabuni was succeeded by his son, Kenyu Mabuni, as the third Soke of Shito-Ryu. Kenyu was anointed the next Soke (successor) of the system in an inauguration ceremony held on February 28, 2016, in Osaka, continuing his father&#x27;s and his grandfather&#x27;s work which is the spread of the original Shito ryu Karate do worldwide. Additionally, Tsukasa Mabuni, daughter of Kenzo Mabuni, is the 3rd Soke of Seito Shito Ryu, inheriting the title from her father. Her organization is Shito Ryu International Karate Do Kai.

== Characteristics ==
Shitō-ryū is a combination style, which attempts to unite the diverse roots of karate. On one hand, Shitō-ryū has the physical strength and long powerful stances of Shuri-te derived styles, such as Shorin-ryū and Shotokan (松涛館); on the other hand, Shitō-ryū also
has the circular and eight-directional movements, breathing power, and hard and soft characteristics of Naha-te styles such as Uechi-ryū and Gōjū-ryū (剛柔流). Shitō-ryū is extremely fast, but still can be artistic and powerful. In addition, Shitō-ryū formalizes and emphasizes the five rules of defense, developed by Kenwa Mabuni, and known as &quot;Uke no go gensoku&quot; (受けの五原則), &quot;Uke no go genri&quot; (受けの五原理), or &quot;Uke no go ho&quot; (受けの五法):
* 落花 (&quot;rakka&quot;, &quot;falling petals&quot;). The art of blocking with such force and precision as to completely destroy the opponent&#x27;s attacking motion. Examples of rakka are the most well-known blocks, such as &quot;gedan-barai&quot; (下段払い) or &quot;soto-uke&quot; (外受け).
* 流水 (&quot;ryūsui&quot;, &quot;running water&quot;). The art of flowing around the attacker&#x27;s motion, and through it, soft blocking. Examples are &quot;nagashi-uke&quot; (流し受け) and &quot;osae-uke&quot; (押さえ受け).
* 屈伸 (&quot;kusshin&quot;, &quot;elasticity&quot;). This is the art of bouncing back, storing energy while recoiling from the opponent&#x27;s attack, changing or lowering stance only to immediately unwind and counterattack. Classic examples are stance transitions &quot;zenkutsu&quot; (前屈立ち) to &quot;kōkutsu&quot; (後屈立ち) and &quot;moto-dachi&quot; (基立ち) to &quot;nekoashi-dachi&quot; (猫足立ち).
* 転位 (&quot;ten&#x27;i&quot;, &quot;transposition&quot;). &quot;Ten&#x27;i&quot; is the utilization of all eight directions of movement, most importantly stepping away from the line of attack.
* 反撃 (&quot;hangeki&quot;, &quot;counterattack&quot;). A &quot;hangeki&quot; defense is an attack which at the same time deflects the opponent&#x27;s attack before it can reach the defender. Examples of this are various kinds of &quot;tsuki-uke&quot; (突き受け), including &quot;yama-tsuki&quot; (山突き).

Modern Shitō-ryū styles also place a strong emphasis on sparring. Shitō-ryū stresses speed and economy of movement, and fighting is generally initiated from a higher, more upright stance than Shotokan employs. On the other hand, because the style has a relatively high number of kata, a significant of time is spent perfecting forms.

Additional motor symptoms include chorea or athetosis. In about 20% of people with TD, the disorder interferes with daily functioning. If TD is present in the setting of a long-term drug therapy, reversibility can be determined primarily by severity of symptoms and how long symptoms have been present before the long-term drug has been stopped.
Tardive dyskinesia occurs as a result of long-term use of dopamine-receptor-blocking medications such as antipsychotics and metoclopramide. These medications are usually used for mental illness but may also be given for gastrointestinal or neurological problems. The condition typically develops only after months to years of use. The diagnosis is based on the symptoms after ruling out other potential causes.
Efforts to prevent the condition include either using the lowest possible dose or discontinuing use of neuroleptics. Treatment includes stopping the neuroleptic medication if possible (although this may temporarily worsen symptoms) or switching to clozapine. Other medications such as valbenazine, tetrabenazine, or botulinum toxin may be used to lessen the symptoms. With treatment, some see a resolution of symptoms, while others do not.
Rates in those on atypical antipsychotics are about 20%, while those on typical antipsychotics have rates of about 30%. The risk of acquiring the condition is greater in older people, for women, as well as patients with mood disorders and/or medical diagnoses receiving antipsychotic medications. The term &quot;tardive dyskinesia&quot; first came into use in 1964.

==Signs and symptoms==
Tardive dyskinesia is characterized by repetitive, involuntary movements, which occurs following treatment with medication (hence the term &quot;tardive&quot;). Some examples of these types of involuntary movements include:
* Grimacing
* Tongue movements
* Lip smacking
* Lip puckering
* Pursing of the lips
* Excessive eye blinking
* Rapid, involuntary movements of the limbs, torso, and fingers may also occur.

In some cases, an individual&#x27;s legs can be so affected that walking becomes difficult or impossible. These symptoms are the opposite of people who are diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease. People with Parkinson&#x27;s have difficulty moving, whereas people with tardive dyskinesia have difficulty not moving.

Respiratory irregularity, such as grunting and difficulty breathing, is another symptom associated with tardive dyskinesia, although studies have shown that the rate of people affected is relatively low.

Tardive dyskinesia is often misdiagnosed as a mental illness rather than a neurological disorder, and as a result, people are prescribed neuroleptic drugs, which increase the probability that the person will develop a severe and disabling case, and shortening the typical survival period.

Other closely related neurological disorders have been recognized as variants of tardive dyskinesia. Tardive dystonia is similar to standard dystonia but permanent. Tardive akathisia involves painful feelings of inner tension and anxiety and a compulsive drive to move the body. In some extreme cases, afflicted individuals experience so much internal tension that they lose their ability to sit still. Tardive tourettism is a tic disorder featuring the same symptoms as Tourette syndrome. The two disorders are extremely close in nature and often can only be differentiated by the details of their respective onsets. Tardive myoclonus, a rare disorder, presents as brief jerks of muscles in the face, neck, trunk, and extremities.

&quot;AIMS Examination&quot;: This test is used when psychotropic medications have been prescribed because people sometimes develop tardive dyskinesia due to prolonged use of antipsychotic medications. The Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) examination is a test used to identify the symptoms of tardive dyskinesia (TD). The test is not meant to tell whether there is an absence or presence of tardive dyskinesia. It just scales to the level of symptoms indicated by the actions observed. The levels range from none to severe. The AIMS examination was constructed in the 1970s to measure involuntary facial, trunk, and limb movements. It is best to do this test before and after the administration of the psychotropic drugs. Taking the AIMS consistently can help to track severity of TD over time.

==Causes==
Tardive dyskinesia was first described in the 1950s shortly after the introduction of chlorpromazine and other antipsychotic drugs. However, the exact mechanism of the disorder remains uncertain. One line of evidence suggests that tardive dyskinesia may result primarily from neuroleptic-induced dopamine supersensitivity in the nigrostriatal pathway, with the D2 dopamine receptor being most affected. Neuroleptics act primarily on this dopamine system, and older neuroleptics, which have greater affinity for the D2 binding site, are associated with high risk for tardive dyskinesia. The D2 hypersensitivity hypothesis is also supported by evidence of a dose–response relationship, withdrawal effects, studies on D2 agonists and antagonists, animal studies, and genetic polymorphism research. However, the time-course of tardive dyskinesia and its increased prevalence in older populations and drug and alcohol users suggest that dopamine supersensitivity is not a complete explanation. Oxidative stress is another causal explanation that accounts for the deficits in the dopamine supersensitivity hypothesis.

Given similar doses of the same neuroleptic, differences among individuals still exist in the likelihood of developing tardive dyskinesia. Such individual differences may be due to genetic polymorphisms, which code for D2 receptor binding site affinity, or prior exposure to environmental toxins. Decreased functional reserve or cognitive dysfunction, associated with aging, intellectual disability, alcohol and drug use, or traumatic head injuries, has also been shown to increase risk of developing the disorder among those treated with neuroleptics. Antipsychotic drugs can sometimes camouflage the signs of tardive dyskinesia from occurring in the early stages; this can happen from the individual having an increased dose of an antipsychotic drug. Often the symptoms of tardive dyskinesia are not apparent until the individual comes off of the antipsychotic drugs; however, when tardive dyskinesia worsens, the signs become visible.

Other dopamine antagonists and antiemetics can cause tardive dyskinesia, such as metoclopramide and promethazine, used to treat gastrointestinal disorders. Atypical antipsychotics are considered lower-risk for causing TD than their typical counterparts, with incidence rates of 13.1% and 32.4% respectively in short-term trials primarily utilising Haloperidol as the typical antipsychotic. Quetiapine and clozapine are considered the lowest risk agents for precipitating TD. From 2008, there have been reported cases of the anti-psychotic medication aripiprazole, a partial agonist at D2 receptors, leading to tardive dyskinesia.
As of 2013, reports of tardive dyskinesia in aripiprazole have grown in number.
The available research seems to suggest that the concurrent prophylactic use of a neuroleptic and an antiparkinsonian drug is useless to avoid early extrapyramidal side-effects and may render the person more sensitive to tardive dyskinesia. Since 1973 the use of these drugs has been found to be associated with the development of tardive dyskinesia.

==Risk factors==
An increased risk of tardive dyskinesia has been associated with smoking in some studies, although a negative study does exist. There seems to be a cigarette smoke-exposure-dependent risk for TD in people who are antipsychotic-treated. Elderly people are also at a heightened risk for developing TD, as are females and those with organic brain injuries or diabetes mellitus and those with the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. TD is also more common in those that experience acute neurological side effects from antipsychotic drug treatment. Racial discrepancies in TD rate also exist, with Africans and African Americans having higher rates of TD after exposure to antipsychotics. Certain genetic risk factors for TD have been identified including polymorphisms in the genes encoding the D3, 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors.

==Diagnosis==

Diagnosis is most commonly done by observing the patient&#x27;s face. The criteria in which a diagnosis is made is usually followed in a step by step process.

==Prevention==
Prevention of tardive dyskinesia is achieved by using the lowest effective dose of a neuroleptic for the shortest time. However, with diseases of chronic psychosis such as schizophrenia, this strategy must be balanced with the fact that increased dosages of neuroleptics are more beneficial in preventing recurrence of psychosis. If tardive dyskinesia is diagnosed, the causative drug should be discontinued. Tardive dyskinesia may persist after withdrawal of the drug for months, years or even permanently. Some studies suggest that practitioners should consider using atypical antipsychotics as a substitute to typical antipsychotics for people requiring medication. These agents are associated with fewer neuromotor side effects and a lower risk of developing tardive dyskinesia.

Studies have tested the use of melatonin, high dosage vitamins, and different antioxidants in concurrence with antipsychotic drugs (often used to treat schizophrenia) as a way of preventing and treating tardive dyskinesia. Although further research is needed, studies reported a much lower percentage of individuals developing tardive dyskinesia than the current rate of people for those taking antipsychotic drugs. Tentative evidence supports the use of vitamin E for prevention.

==Treatment==

Valbenazine was approved by the FDA for tardive dyskinesia in April 2017. Tetrabenazine, which is a dopamine depleting drug, is sometimes used to treat tardive dyskinesia and other movement disorders (e.g. Huntington&#x27;s chorea). Deutetrabenazine, an isotopic isomer of tetrabenazine, was approved by the FDA for tardive dyskinesia in August 2017. Vitamin B6 has been reported to be an effective treatment for TD in two randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trials, but the overall evidence for its effectiveness is considered &quot;weak.&quot; Clonidine may also be useful in the treatment of TD, although dose-limiting hypotension and sedation may hinder its usage. Botox injections are used for minor focal dystonia, but not in more advanced tardive dyskinesia. As of 2018, evidence is insufficient to support the use of benzodiazepines, baclofen, progabide, sodium valproate, gaboxadol, or calcium channel blockers (e.g. diltiazem).

==Epidemiology==
Tardive dyskinesia most commonly occurs in people with psychiatric conditions who are treated with antipsychotic medications for many years. The average rate of people affected has been estimated to be around 30% for individuals taking antipsychotic medication, such as that used to treat schizophrenia. A study being conducted at the Yale University School of Medicine has estimated that &quot;32% of people develop persistent tics after 5 years on major tranquilizers, 57% by 15 years, and 68% by 25 years.&quot; More drastic data was found during a longitudinal study conducted on individuals 45 years of age and older who were taking antipsychotic drugs. According to this research study, 26% of people developed tardive dyskinesia after just one year on the medication. Another 60% of this at-risk group developed the disorder after 3 years, and 23% developed &quot;severe&quot; cases of tardive dyskinesia within 3 years. According to these estimates, the majority of people will eventually develop the disorder if they remain on the drugs long enough.

Elderly people are more prone to develop tardive dyskinesia, and elderly women are more at-risk than elderly men. The risk is much lower for younger men and women, and also more equal across the sexes.
Several studies have recently been conducted comparing the number of people affected of tardive dyskinesia with second generation, or more modern, antipsychotic drugs to that of first generation drugs. The newer antipsychotics appear to have a substantially reduced potential for causing tardive dyskinesia. However, some studies express concern that the number of people affected has decreased far less than expected, cautioning against the overestimation of the safety of modern antipsychotics.

A practitioner can evaluate and diagnose a person with tardive dyskinesia by conducting a systematic examination. The practitioner should ask the person to relax, and look for symptoms like facial grimacing, eye or lip movements, tics, respiratory irregularities, and tongue movements. In some cases, people experience nutritional problems, so a practitioner can also look for a gain or loss in weight.

Apart from the underlying psychiatric disorder, tardive dyskinesia may lead to the social isolation of people with the condition. It also increases the risk of body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) and can even lead to suicide. Emotional or physical stress can increase the severity of dyskinetic movements, whereas relaxation and sedation have the opposite effect.

== In popular culture ==
In the TV series &quot;The Good Wife&quot; and &quot;The Good Fight&quot;, Michael J. Fox, who suffers from Parkinson&#x27;s disease, plays the lawyer &quot;Louis Canning&quot;, who has tardive dyskinesia.

==Formations==

=== Current operations ===

==== N700 series / N700S series ====
As of November 2024, trains are formed as shown below, with car 1 at the Hakata end, and car 16 at the Tokyo end. All seats are non-smoking.

Electric power outlets are located at the ends and at window seats of standard cars, and at each seat in Green cars.

In 2021, payphones were removed from cars 4, 9, 15 (previously present on N700 trains only) and car 12 (previously present on all trains). In March 2024, smoking rooms were removed from all Tokaido, San&#x27;yo, and Kyushu Shinkansen trains and station platforms.
=== Former operations ===

==== 700 series ====
Services formerly operated with 700 series sets at the time of their removal in March 2020 were as follows:
==History==

===Wartime steam services===
The &quot;Nozomi&quot; name was first used for long-distance express services operated between Busan in Japanese-occupied Korea and Mukden (now Shenyang) in the former Manchukuo (now China) from 1934. From 1938, the services were extended to run between Busan and Xinjing (now Changchun) in Manchukuo. The journey from Busan to Xinjing took over 29 hours, with an average speed of . The services were run down between 1943 and 1944.

===Shinkansen services===
&quot;Nozomi&quot; shinkansen services commenced on March 14, 1992, using new 300 series trainsets with a top speed of . From March 1997, 500 series trainsets were introduced on Tokyo - Hakata &quot;Nozomi&quot; services, running at a maximum speed of and covering the section between Shin-Osaka and Hakata in 2 hours 17 minutes.

700 series trains were introduced on &quot;Nozomi&quot; services in 1999, and N700 series trains were introduced from July 1, 2007, initially with four daily round-trip runs. All regularly scheduled through &quot;Nozomi&quot; services to the San&#x27;yō Shinkansen (Tokyo–Hakata) were operated by N700 series sets from 13 March 2010. From the start of the revised timetable on 17 March 2012, all regularly scheduled &quot;Nozomi&quot; services, including runs limited to the Tokaido Shinkansen, were operated by N700 series sets.

Effective December 2023, JR Central and JR West adjusted all &quot;Nozomi&quot; services to operate completely with reservations during three seasons that experience the highest ridership: New Years and Christmas (late December through the first week of January), Golden Week (29 April to 5 May), and the Obon festival (mid to late August). These adjustments were made in a bid to increase seat patronage and reduce the amount of standing passengers. Starting in March 2025, &quot;Nozomi&quot; services will begin operating with only two unreserved cars instead of three outside of peak periods, with officials citing an increase in the popularity of online train reservations.

<text>Osamu Tezuka (, born , &quot;Tezuka Osamu&quot;, – 9 February 1989) was a Japanese manga artist, cartoonist and animator. Born in Osaka Prefecture, his prolific output, pioneering techniques and innovative redefinitions of genres earned him such titles as , and . Additionally, he is often considered the Japanese equivalent to Walt Disney, who served as a major inspiration during Tezuka&#x27;s formative years. Though this phrase praises the quality of his early manga works for children and animations, it also blurs the significant influence of his later, more literary, gekiga works.

Tezuka began what was known as the manga revolution in Japan with his &quot;New Treasure Island&quot; published in 1947. His output would spawn some of the most influential, successful and well-received manga series including the children&#x27;s manga &quot;Astro Boy&quot;, &quot;Princess Knight&quot; and &quot;Kimba the White Lion&quot;, and the adult-oriented series &quot;Black Jack&quot;, &quot;Phoenix&quot; and &quot;Buddha&quot;, all of which won several awards.

Tezuka died of stomach cancer in 1989. His death had an immediate impact on the Japanese public and other cartoonists. A museum was constructed in Takarazuka dedicated to his memory and life works, and Tezuka received many posthumous awards. Several animations were in production at the time of his death along with the final chapters of &quot;Phoenix&quot;, which were never released.

==Biography==
===Early life (1928–1945)===
Tezuka was born in Toyonaka, Osaka. He was the eldest of three children. The Tezuka family were prosperous and well-educated; his father Yutaka worked in management at Sumitomo Metals, his grandfather Taro was a lawyer and his great-grandfather Ryoan and great-great-grandfather Ryosen were doctors. His mother&#x27;s family had a long military history.

Later in life, he gave his mother credit for inspiring confidence and creativity through her stories. She frequently took him to the Takarazuka Grand Theater, which often headlined the Takarazuka Revue, an all-female musical theater troupe. Their romantic musicals aimed at a female audience, had a large influence of Tezuka&#x27;s later works, including his costume designs. Not only that, but the performers&#x27; large, sparkling eyes also had an influence on Tezuka&#x27;s art style. He said that he had a profound &quot;spirit of nostalgia&quot; for Takarazuka.

When Tezuka was young, his father showed him Walt Disney films and he became a Disney movie buff, seeing the films multiple times in a row, most famously seeing &quot;Bambi&quot; more than 80 times. Tezuka started to draw comics around his second year of elementary school, in large part inspired by Disney animation; he drew so much that his mother would have to erase pages in his notebook in order to keep up with his output. Tezuka was also inspired by the works by Suihō Tagawa and Unno Juza. Later in life, he would state that the most important influence on his desire to be an animator was not Disney but the experience of watching the Chinese animation &quot;Princess Iron Fan&quot; as a child.

Around his fifth school year, he found a description of a ground beetle, known as &quot;Osamushi&quot; in Japanese, in a book on insects. Its name so resembled his own name that he adopted &quot;Osamushi&quot; as his pen name. Tezuka continued to develop his manga skills throughout his school career. During this period he created his first adept amateur works.

During high school in 1944, Tezuka was drafted to work for a factory, supporting the Japanese war effort during World War II; he simultaneously continued writing manga. In 1945, Tezuka was accepted into Osaka University and began studying medicine. During this time, he also began publishing his first professional works.

===Early success (1946–1951)===

Tezuka came to the realization that he could use manga as a means of helping to convince people to care for the world. After World War II, at age 17, he published his first professional work, &quot;Diary of Ma-chan&quot;, which was serialized in the elementary school children&#x27;s newspaper &quot;Shokokumin Shinbun&quot; in early 1946.

Tezuka began talks with fellow manga creator , who pitched Tezuka a story based on Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s classic adventure novel, &quot;Treasure Island&quot;. Sakai promised Tezuka a publishing spot from Ikuei Shuppan if he would work on the manga. Tezuka finished the manga, only loosely basing it on the original work. &quot;Shin Takarajima&quot; (&quot;New Treasure Island&quot;) was published and became an overnight success, which began the golden age of manga, a craze comparable to American comic book Golden Age at the same time.

With the success of &quot;New Treasure Island,&quot; Tezuka traveled to Tokyo in search of a publisher for more of his work. Kobunsha turned Tezuka down, but Shinseikaku agreed to publish &quot;The Strange Voyage of Dr. Tiger&quot; and Domei Shuppansha agreed to publish &quot;The Mysterious Dr. Koronko&quot;.

While still in medical school Tezuka published his first masterpieces: a trilogy of science fiction epics called &quot;Lost World&quot; (1948), &quot;Metropolis&quot; (1949), and &quot;Nextworld&quot; (1951).

Soon afterward, Tezuka published his first major success, &quot;Kimba the White Lion&quot;, which was serialized in &quot;Manga Shonen&quot; from 1950 to 1954.

In 1951, Tezuka graduated from the Osaka School of Medicine and published &quot;Ambassador Atom&quot;, the first appearance of the Astro Boy character. That same year Tezuka joined a group known as the Tokyo Children Manga Association, consisting of other manga artists such as Baba Noboru, Ota Jiro, Furusawa Hideo, Eiichi Fukui, Irie Shigeru and Negishi Komichi.

===&quot;Astro Boy&quot;, national fame and early animation (1952–1960)===
By 1952, &quot;Ambassador Atom&quot; had proven to be an only mild success in Japan; however, one particular character became extremely popular with young boys: a humanoid robot named Atom. Tezuka received several letters from many young boys. Expecting success with a series based around Atom, Tezuka&#x27;s producer suggested that he be given human emotions. One day, while working at a hospital, Tezuka was punched in the face by a frustrated American G.I. This encounter gave Tezuka the idea to include the theme of Atom&#x27;s interaction with aliens. On 4 February 1952, &quot;Tetsuwan Atom&quot; began serialization in &quot;Weekly Shonen Magazine&quot;. The character Atom and his adventures became an instant phenomenon in Japan.

Due to the success of &quot;Tetsuwan Atom&quot;, in 1953, Tezuka published the shōjo manga &quot;Ribon no Kishi&quot; (&quot;Princess Knight&quot;), serialized in &quot;Shojo Club&quot; from 1953 to 1956.

In 1954, Tezuka first published what he would consider his life&#x27;s work, &quot;Phoenix&quot;, which originally appeared in &quot;Mushi Production Commercial Firm&quot;.

===Production career (1959–1989)===
Tezuka&#x27;s first work to be adapted for animation was &quot;Saiyuki&quot;, a retelling of the Chinese story of &quot;Journey to the West&quot;. Produced by Toei Animation, Tezuka was officially credited as the director of the film. However, later crew accounts would prove that the manga artist was difficult to motivate to do work. Most of the direction was done by Yabushita Taiji instead. Tezuka was eventually given the task of storyboarding the film, so that he didn&#x27;t actually have to animate anything and something in the production could get done. He did not follow Toei&#x27;s deadlines, and after a year of working on the project and several weeks of threats from Toei&#x27;s producers, he finally delivered his 500-page storyboard so the animators could do their job in the autumn of 1959. That said, the crew found the storyboard to be entirely unpractical, lacking pacing and a clear plot for a 90-minute film, instead something that would be better told through an open-ended weekly comic like what Tezuka had been producing. This ran counter to Toei&#x27;s &quot;climax method&quot; that had the goal of a big finish at the end for audiences to leave the cinema remembering. The script for the film was credited to Uekusa Keinosuke. The film was released as &quot;Alakazam the Great&quot; in 1960.

That said, many of the animators were initially shocked at the amount they had to produce in such a short amount of time—amounting to a frame a day, thinking it undoable. However, Tezuka&#x27;s simplified art style made the entire animation process much more efficient.

Tezuka did not enjoy his time at Toei, and he especially did not like that he felt he had no control over &quot;his&quot; story or the ending. This film is recognized as a massive turning point in animation history. It introduced the use of simplified art style and limited animation as labor and cost savers. It introduced Tsukioka Sadao, one of Tezuka&#x27;s assistants, to Toei where he would later become the director of the studio&#x27;s first TV series, and it introduced Tezuka to the animators he would later poach for his own studio.

In 1961, Tezuka entered the animation industry in Japan by founding the production company Mushi Productions as a rival of Toei Animation. His initial staff was composed of animators he had met while working on Saiyuki that he convinced to join by paying the animators more than double what Toei was paying them as well as paying for food. Their first film was &quot;Tales from a Certain Street Corner&quot; (&quot;Aru Machikado no Monogatari&quot;), an &#x27;anti-Disney&#x27;, experimental film. Just like on &quot;Saiyuki&quot;, Tezuka would often fall behind his own deadlines and the staff would have to pick up the slack only for Tezuka to take credit for it later. &quot;Tales from a Certain Street Corner&quot; was shown at a single special screening and featured many &quot;tricks&quot; that would be later standardized as labor-saving measures in the anime industry such as repeated and reversed animation cycles of characters dancing, frames being held for a long period of time. This same screening also featured the first screening of Tezuka&#x27;s &quot;Astro Boy&quot; initial two episodes eight weeks before its original broadcast on the 5 or 6 November 1962 at the Yamaha Hall.

&quot;Astro Boy&quot; was first broadcast on New Year&#x27;s Day 1963; this series would create the first successful model for animation production in Japan and would also be the first Japanese animation dubbed into English for an American audience and also created the market for children&#x27;s merchandise. This is in large part because Tezuka was able to undercut his competitors, cutting costs to 2.5 million yen per episode by using techniques that would later be adopted by the television anime industry at large such as shooting on threes, stop images, repetition, sectioning, combined use, and short shots. None of these methods were invented by Tezuka or Mushi Pro, but were instead refined there. During production, the staff also found that while the short cuts were initially obvious, the use of soundscaping helped to mitigate it.

The only reason &quot;Astro Boy&quot; was able to survive its inception is because Tezuka was able to sell the foreign rights to NBC Enterprises (an important distinction from NBC itself which was the entity Tezuka believed he was selling to). The American company ordered 52 episodes, a crucial investment because Mushi Pro only had four episodes in the can and only enough resources for one episode more. In the American localization, even more over the top sound effects were used to mitigate the obviously cheap animation. The use of sound would be further utilized and exemplified in other anime to follow, leading to many of the &quot;stock&quot; anime sound effects modern audiences are now used to.

Selling to an American market was very restrictive, though. They were not to include any indication that the show was made in Japan, they were not to have any arc that lasted more than an episode, all street signs had to be in English, there could be no religious references, &quot;adult&quot; themes, or nudity. Tezuka agreed to this, claiming that it would fit better with the sci-fi setting by giving the sense of a &quot;placelessness&quot;. However, he would soon be disappointed by the American market when a Mushi Pro representative went to discuss the next year&#x27;s episode order only to find out that the Americans didn&#x27;t need anymore, believing that 52 episodes were more than enough to cycle through indefinitely.

Other series were subsequently adapted to animation, including &quot;Jungle Emperor&quot; (1965), the first Japanese animated series produced in full color. &quot;Jungle Emperor&quot; was also successfully sold to NBC Enterprises who almost made Mushi Pro clothe the wild animals featured. They were finally able to negotiate &quot;than animals were permitted to be &#x27;naked&#x27; in natural settings, and that the depiction of black characters was permissible, as long as they were presented as &#x27;civilized&#x27;; evil characters could still only be white.&quot;

In the late 60s and 70s, it was clear that the rise of Mushi Pro was a short one and it was sliding into bankruptcy. Tezuka&#x27;s financial model was unsustainable and the company was deeply in debt. In two desperate attempts to earn enough money to pay investors, Tezuka turned to the adult film market and produced &quot;A Thousand and One Nights&quot; (1969) and &quot;Cleopatra&quot; (1970). Both attempts failed.

Tezuka stepped down as acting director in 1968 to found a new animation studio, Tezuka Productions, and continued experimenting with animation late into his life. In 1973, Mushi Productions collapsed financially; the fallout would produce several influential animation production studios, including Sunrise.

===&quot;Gekiga&quot; graphic novels (1967–1989)===

In 1967, in response to the magazine &quot;Garo&quot; and the &quot;gekiga&quot; movement, Tezuka created the magazine &quot;COM&quot;. By doing so, he radically changed his art from a cartoony, Disney-esque slapstick style towards a more realistic drawing style; at the time the themes of his books became focused on an adult audience. A common element in all these books and short stories is the very dark and immoral nature of the main characters. The stories are also filled with explicit violence, erotic scenes, and crime.

The change of his manga from aimed at children to more &#x27;literary&#x27; &quot;gekiga&quot; manga started with the &quot;yōkai&quot; manga &quot;Dororo&quot; in 1967. This &quot;yōkai&quot; manga was influenced by the success of and a response to Shigeru Mizuki&#x27;s &quot;GeGeGe no Kitarō&quot;. Simultaneously, he also produced &quot;Vampires&quot; that, like &quot;Dororo&quot;, also introduced a stronger, more coherent storyline and a shift in the drawing style. After these two he began his true first &quot;gekiga&quot; attempt with &quot;Swallowing the Earth&quot;. Dissatisfied with the result, he soon after produced &quot;I.L.&quot;. His work &quot;Phoenix&quot; began in 1967.

Besides the well-known series &quot;Phoenix&quot;, &quot;Black Jack&quot; and &quot;Buddha&quot;, which are drawn in this style, he also produced a vast amount of one-shots or shorter series, such as &quot;Ayako&quot;, &quot;Ode to Kirihito&quot;, &quot;Alabaster&quot;, &quot;Apollo&#x27;s Song&quot;, &quot;Barbara&quot;, &quot;MW&quot;, &quot;The Book of Human Insects&quot;, and a large number of short stories that were later collectively published in books such as &quot;Under the Air&quot;, &quot;Clockwork Apple&quot;, &quot;The Crater&quot;, &quot;Melody of Iron and Other Short Stories&quot;, and &quot;Record of the Glass Castle&quot;.

Tezuka would become a bit milder in narrative tone in the 1980s with his follow-up works such as &quot;Message to Adolf&quot;, &quot;Midnight&quot;, &quot;Ludwig B&quot; (unfinished), and &quot;Neo Faust&quot;.

=== Death ===
Tezuka died of stomach cancer on 9 February 1989 after he was rushed into the hospital in Tokyo. His last words were: &quot;I&#x27;m begging you, let me work!&quot;, spoken to a nurse who had tried to take away his drawing equipment.

Although Tezuka was agnostic, he was buried in a Buddhist cemetery in Tokyo.

In 2014, it was reported that Tezuka&#x27;s daughter, , opened a drawer to her father&#x27;s desk which had been locked since his death. In it she found a half-eaten piece of chocolate, a handwritten essay about Katsuhiro Otomo in regard to his good work on &quot;Akira&quot;, sketches from his various projects, and a large number of erotic sketches of anthropomorphic animals.

==Style==
Tezuka is known for his imaginative stories and stylized Japanese adaptations of Western literature. Tezuka&#x27;s &quot;cinematic&quot; page layouts were influenced by Milt Gross&#x27; early graphic novel &quot;He Done Her Wrong&quot;. He read this book as a child, and its style characterized many manga artists who followed in Tezuka&#x27;s footsteps.

A key component of Tezuka&#x27;s style is his extensive use of quotations, which include his allusions to popular works and adoptions of trends. For instance, he incorporated multiple varieties of depth into one frame—mirroring a breakthrough technique in the realm of Hollywood film: deep-focus cinematography. Tezuka&#x27;s &quot;Metropolis&quot; is an exemplar for his use of this technique, as well as for the cinematic &quot;pans and close-ups and zooms&quot; that created the illusion of motion in his scenes. Nonetheless: Tezuka&#x27;s dyadic visual jokes—which involve the arrival of creatures at emotionally-charged scenes—disrupt the tension, reminding the reader of &quot;the framework of fiction&quot; and promoting a safe &quot;mode of identification&quot; with the narrative.

Tezuka&#x27;s quotations of real trends mark a key aspect of his style: adaptation in response to the socio-cultural situation and interests of his audience. He involved the &quot;kiss-scene&quot; motif due to its rising popularity in Japanese film. Tezuka juxtaposed this with elements more customary to Japan, such as the &quot;glorification of self-sacrifice&quot;: instead of the usual happy ending, one or more of his characters would meet their demise but specifically for the sake of others. Aside from these borrowed motifs, a signature characteristic of Tezuka&#x27;s style is the Star System, which refers to his casting of characters into different roles across a body of comics. His characters were modified to appear in different works, similar to how actors modify their personality and appearance to suit different performances. Influenced by film, he created bipartite characters that were constituted by the performer (or the stock character) and the performance (or the role played by the stock character). In doing so, Tezuka created space for intertextual history, references and commentary. The Star System utilized &quot;the crossover between celebrity, actor and character&quot; and also enabled Tezuka to involve intertextuality.

Tezuka invented the distinctive &quot;large eyes&quot; style of Japanese animation, drawing inspiration from the eyes of the characters of the Takarazuka Revue, as well as from Western cartoon characters such as Betty Boop, Mickey Mouse, and Bambi, and from Disney movies.

=== Evolution ===
While the start of Tezuka&#x27;s professional career involved four-panel comics like &quot;The Diary of Mā-chan&quot; and &quot;A Man from Mars&quot;, it was the &quot;akahon&quot; format of &quot;New Treasure Island&quot;, a comic book numbering 200 pages, that attached him to fame. The &quot;akahon&quot; is characterized by the use of &quot;senkashi&quot; paper and &quot;bright red covers&quot;, both of which enabled easy circulation. Tezuka departed from the typical expectations of &quot;akahon&quot; by introducing complexity in &quot;The Mysterious Underground Man&quot; and morality in &quot;Magic House&quot; and &quot;Vampire Devils&quot;. Moreover, he used &quot;romaji&quot; (English) titles alongside the Japanese equivalents, as well as a subtle color palette and intricate composition—all of which were unlike other &quot;akahon&quot;. Later, Tezuka&#x27;s style—which favoured &quot;akahon&quot;—had to be reinvented to serve the demands of serialized magazines. He created the &quot;single charismatic hero&quot;, an example of which is Atom, to capture and keep the readership&#x27;s attention through the episodic narratives.

== Works ==
Tezuka&#x27;s complete oeuvre includes over 700 volumes, with more than 150,000 pages. Tezuka&#x27;s creations include &quot;Astro Boy&quot; (&quot;Mighty Atom&quot; in Japan), &quot;Black Jack&quot;, &quot;Princess Knight&quot;, &quot;Phoenix&quot; (&quot;Hi no Tori&quot; in Japan), &quot;Kimba the White Lion&quot; (&quot;Jungle Emperor&quot; in Japan), &quot;Unico&quot;, &quot;Message to Adolf&quot;, &quot;The Amazing 3,&quot; &quot;Buddha, and Dororo&quot;. His &quot;life&#x27;s work&quot; was &quot;Phoenix&quot;—a story of life and death that he began in the 1950s and continued until his death.

In addition, Tezuka headed the animation production studio Mushi Production (&quot;Bug Production&quot;), which pioneered TV animation in Japan.

=== Bibliography (manga) ===

A complete list of his works can be found on the Tezuka Osamu Manga Museum website.
* Astro Boy, 1952–68. A sequel to &quot;Captain ATOM&quot; (1951), with Atom renamed Astro Boy in the US. Eventually, Astro Boy would become Tezuka&#x27;s most famous creation. He created the nuclear-powered, yet peace-loving, boy robot first after being punched in the face by a drunken GI. In 1963, &quot;Astro Boy&quot; made its debut as the first domestically produced animated program on Japanese television. The 30-minute weekly program (of which 193 episodes were produced) led to the first craze for anime in Japan. In America, the TV series (which consisted of 104 episodes licensed from the Japanese run) was also a hit, becoming the first Japanese animation to be shown on US television, although the U.S. producers downplayed and disguised the show&#x27;s Japanese origins. Several other &quot;Astro Boy&quot; series have been made since, as well as a 2009 animated feature film &quot;Astro Boy&quot;.
* Kimba the White Lion, 1950–54. A shōnen manga series created by Tezuka which was serialized in the &quot;Manga Shōnen&quot; magazine. An anime based on the manga was created, broadcast in Japan from 1965 and in North America from 1966. It was the first color animated television series created in Japan. 
* Princess Knight, 1953–68. One of Tezuka&#x27;s most famous works and widely regarded as a classic, &quot;Princess Knight&quot; has been very influential in the manga and anime industry. Its portrayal of gender roles is ambiguously interpreted by critics; some claim it has pro-feminist ideals and others think it expresses misogynist ideals of the 1950s–60s Japanese society. Nonetheless, it would start a tradition of androgynous heroines and establish several trends in the &quot;shōjo&quot; genre. In fact, it is considered to be one of the first works in this genre that was narrative-focused and that portrays a female superhero.
* Phoenix, 1954–88. Tezuka&#x27;s most profound and ambitious work, dealing with man&#x27;s quest for immortality, ranging from the distant past to the far future. The central character is the Phoenix, the physical manifestation of the cosmos, who carries within itself the power of immortality; either granted by the Phoenix or taken from the Phoenix by drinking a small amount of its blood. Other characters appear and reappear throughout the series; usually due to their reincarnation. The work remained unfinished at the time of Tezuka&#x27;s death in 1989. &quot;Phoenix&quot; has been filmed several times, most notably as &quot;Phoenix 2772&quot; (1980). Baku Yumemakura was influenced by &quot;Phoenix&quot;; Yumemakura would go on to write the script for &quot;Boku no Son Goku&quot;.
*Dororo, 1967–68, is a manga series about a boy called Hyakkimaru who has been robbed of 48 of his body parts by 48 different devils. In order for him to retrieve a stolen part, he must eliminate the devil that stole it. Hyakkimaru meets a boy thief, Dororo, and together they travel while being constantly attacked by ghosts and monsters. In 1969, the manga series was adapted into an anime that consisted of 26 episodes. In 2019, nearly 50 years later, the manga series was re-adapted into another anime series with 24 episodes.
* Buddha, 1972–83, is Tezuka&#x27;s unique interpretation of the life of Gautama Buddha, the founder of Buddhism. The critically acclaimed series is often referred to as a gritty portrayal of the Buddha&#x27;s life. The series began in September 1972 and ended in December 1983, as one of Tezuka&#x27;s last epic manga works. Nearly three decades after the manga was completed, two anime film adaptations were released in 2011 and 2014.
* Black Jack, 1973–83. The story of Black Jack, a talented surgeon who operates illegally, using radical and supernatural techniques to combat rare afflictions. &quot;Black Jack&quot; received the Japan Cartoonists&#x27; Association Special Award in 1975 and the Koudansha Manga Award in 1977. Three &quot;Black Jack&quot; TV movies were released between 2000 and 2001. In fall 2004, an anime television series was aired in Japan with 61 episodes, releasing another movie afterward. A new series, titled &quot;Black Jack 21&quot;, started broadcasting on 10 April 2006. In September 2008, the first volume of the manga had been published in English by Vertical Publishing and more volumes are being published to this day.

== Personal life ==
Tezuka was a descendant of Hattori Hanzō, a famous ninja and samurai who faithfully served Tokugawa Ieyasu during the Sengoku period in Japan.

Tezuka&#x27;s childhood nickname was &quot;gashagasha-atama&quot;: &quot;messy head&quot; (&quot;gashagasha&quot; is slang for messy, &quot;atama&quot; means head). As a child, Tezuka&#x27;s arms swelled up and he became ill. He was treated and cured by a doctor, which made him also want to be a doctor. At a crossing point, he asked his mother whether he should look into doing manga full-time or whether he should become a doctor. At the time, being a manga author was not a particularly rewarding job. The answer his mother gave was: &quot;You should work doing the thing you like most of all.&quot; Tezuka decided to devote himself to manga creation on a full-time basis. He graduated from Osaka University and obtained his medical degree, but he would later use his medical and scientific knowledge to enrich his sci-fi manga, such as &quot;Black Jack&quot;.

Tezuka enjoyed insect collecting and entomology (even adding the character &#x27;bug&#x27; to his pen name), Disney, and baseball—in fact, he licensed the &quot;grown up&quot; version of his character Kimba the White Lion as the logo for the Seibu Lions of the Nippon Professional Baseball League. A fan of Superman, Tezuka was honorary chairman of Japan&#x27;s Superman Fan Club.

In 1959 Osamu Tezuka married Etsuko Okada at a Takarazuka hotel.

Tezuka met Walt Disney in person at the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair. In a 1986 entry in his personal diary, Tezuka stated that Disney wanted to hire him for a potential science fiction project.

In January 1965, Tezuka received a letter from American film director Stanley Kubrick, who had watched &quot;Astro Boy&quot; and wanted to invite Tezuka to be the art director of his next movie, &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; (which was eventually released in 1968). Although flattered by Kubrick&#x27;s invitation, Tezuka&#x27;s schedule did not allow him to leave his studio for a year to live in England, so he had to turn down the offer. Although he was not able to work on &quot;2001&quot;, he loved the film, and would play its soundtrack at maximum volume in his studio to keep him awake during long nights of work.

Tezuka&#x27;s son Makoto Tezuka became a film and anime director.

== Legacy and influence on manga industry ==
Stamps were issued in Tezuka&#x27;s honor in 1997. Also, beginning in 2003, the Japanese toy company Kaiyodo began manufacturing a series of figurines of Tezuka&#x27;s creations, including Princess Knight, Unico, the Phoenix, Dororo, Marvelous Melmo, Ambassador Magma, and many others. To date, three series of the figurines have been released.

Tezuka&#x27;s legacy has continued to be honored among manga artists and animators and companies. He guided many well-known manga artists, such as Shotaro Ishinomori and Go Nagai. Artists and companies that have cited Tezuka as an influence include Monkey Punch (&quot;Lupin III&quot;), Katsuhiro Otomo (&quot;Akira&quot;), Go Nagai (&quot;Devilman&quot;, &quot;Mazinger Z&quot;, &quot;Cutie Honey&quot;), Hayao Miyazaki (&quot;Spirited Away&quot;, &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot;, &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot;), Akira Toriyama (&quot;Dragon Ball&quot;), Naoko Takeuchi (&quot;Sailor Moon&quot;), Naoko&#x27;s husband Yoshihiro Togashi (&quot;YuYu Hakusho&quot;, &quot;Hunter × Hunter&quot;), Clamp (&quot;Magic Knight Rayearth&quot;, &quot;Cardcaptor Sakura&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;xxxHolic&quot;), Katsu Aki (&quot;Futari Ecchi&quot;), Tetsuo Hara (&quot;Fist Of The North Star&quot;), Keisuke Itagaki (&quot;Baki the Grappler&quot;), Masamune Shirow (&quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot;), Kazuhiro Fujita (&quot;Ushio &amp; Tora&quot;), Nobuhiro Watsuki (&quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot;), Rumiko Takahashi (&quot;Urusei Yatsura&quot;, &quot;Ranma ½&quot;, &quot;Inuyasha&quot;, &quot;Maison Ikkoku&quot;), Hiroyuki Takei (&quot;Shaman King&quot;), Masami Kurumada (&quot;Saint Seiya&quot;), Kentaro Miura (&quot;Berserk&quot;), Hitoshi Iwaaki (&quot;Parasyte, Historie&quot;), Mia Ikumi (&quot;Tokyo Mew Mew&quot;), Kenichi Sonoda (&quot;Gunsmith Cats&quot;), Moto Hagio (&quot;The Poe Clan&quot;), Makoto Yukimura (&quot;Vinland Saga&quot;), Yoshihiro Tatsumi (&quot;A Drifting Life&quot;), Osamu Akimoto (&quot;&quot;), Yudetamago (&quot;Kinnikuman&quot;), Keiko Takemiya (&quot;Toward the Terra&quot;), Kosuke Fujishima (&quot;Oh My Goddess&quot;), Yuu Watase (&quot;Fushigi Yugi&quot;), Leiji Matsumoto (&quot;Space Battleship Yamato&quot;, &quot;Galaxy Express 999&quot;, &quot;Space Pirate Captain Harlock&quot;), Takehiko Ito (&quot;Outlaw Star&quot;), Yoshiharu Tsuge (&quot;The Man Without Talent&quot;), Hirohiko Araki (&quot;JoJo&#x27;s Bizzare Adventure&quot;), Tetsuya Chiba (&quot;Ashita no Joe&quot;), George Morikawa (&quot;Hajime no Ippo&quot;), Koshi Rikudo (&quot;Excel Saga&quot;), Hideo Azuma (&quot;Nanako SOS&quot;), Satoru Noda (&quot;Golden Kamuy&quot;), Keiji Nakazawa (&quot;Barefoot Gen&quot;), Hitoshi Okuda (&quot;Tenchi Muyo!&quot;), Fujiko Fujio (&quot;Doraemon&quot;), Naoki Urasawa (&quot;20th Century Boys&quot;), Kyoko Okazaki (&quot;Pink&quot;), Tatsunoko (&quot;Yatterman&quot;), Gainax (&quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;) and Capcom (&quot;Street Fighter&quot;, &quot;Megaman&quot;). From 2003 to 2009, Urasawa and Takashi Nagasaki adapted an arc of &quot;Astro Boy&quot; into the murder mystery series &quot;Pluto&quot;. 

His legacy also extends to cartoonists outside of Japan. Will Eisner called himself an &#x27;ardent admirer&#x27; of Tezuka&#x27;s work. Jean Giraud (Mœbius) called him &#x27;a great artist, and a fascinating personality&#x27;. Craig Thompson called him &#x27;Japan&#x27;s greatest cartoonist&#x27;. Art Spiegelman compared his place in the history of manga to that of Siddhartha&#x27;s in Buddhism. Chester Brown has praised his dramatic skills, stating that they &#x27;make the pages fly by.&#x27; Scott McCloud has stated that he had a bookshelf of untranslated Tezuka which he &#x27;studied like the Torah for hours on end&#x27;. Dash Shaw called him &#x27;the absolute greatest&#x27;.

Film director Akira Kurosawa was a fan of Tezuka&#x27;s comics. He owned his collected works, and sought for him to be artistic director on an Edgar Allan Poe adaptation which never got off the ground. Stanley Kubrick was a fan of Tezuka&#x27;s 1963 &quot;Astro Boy&quot; anime. Film director Guillermo del Toro has cited Tezuka as an influence. Video game designers such as Shigeru Miyamoto and Yuji Horii have stated that they were influenced by Tezuka&#x27;s works and video games such as Mega Man, Jumping Flash! and Chaos Seed have cited Tezuka&#x27;s work as a source of influence. Hideo Kojima mentions Tezuka&#x27;s work as being one of the most impressionable parts of the Expo &#x27;70, which he considers to be a formative experience on himself as an adolescent youth. Fumito Ueda mentions Tezuka&#x27;s &#x27;One Million Year Trip: Bandar Book&#x27; as an anime which left a strong impression on him growing up.

Tezuka was a personal friend (and apparent artistic influence) of Brazilian comic book artist Mauricio de Sousa. In 2012, Maurício published a two-issue story arc in the &quot;Monica Teen&quot; comic book featuring some of Tezuka&#x27;s main characters, including Astro Boy, Black Jack, Sapphire, and Kimba, joining Monica and her friends in an adventure in the Amazon rainforest against a smuggling organization chopping down hundreds of trees. This was the first time that Tezuka Productions allowed overseas artists to use Tezuka&#x27;s characters.

In October 2019, a project was announced called Tezuka 2020, which is AI-illustrated manga in his style. At first, the illustrations were distorted and horrifying, but after studying actual human faces, the illustrations looked more like his. After looking through thousands of AI-generated pictures, one stood out, and the illustrator Urumu Tsunogai created the new protagonist. In 2020, an AI writer-artist made by Kioxia was tasked to make a new &quot;Tezuka&quot; manga called &quot;&quot;, which takes place in a futuristic apocalyptic society, which was released in the magazine &quot;&quot;Morning&quot;&quot; on 27 February 2020. It is part of the project, which will also be drawn by physical human beings such as Shigeto Ikehara, Kenichi Kiriki, and Urumu Tsunogai. Tezuka&#x27;s son held a ceremony on 26 February 2020, to introduce people to the manga. The publisher of the magazine already confirmed that a sequel is in production. The manga was published in English on June 4, 2020 under the name &quot;Phaedo&quot;.

The city of Takarazuka, Hyōgo, where Tezuka grew up, opened a museum in his memory. was inaugurated on 25 April 1994, and has three floors (15069.47 ft2). In the basement there is an &quot;Animation Workshop&quot; in which visitors can make their own animation, and a mockup of the city of Takarazuka and a replica of the table where Osamu Tezuka worked.

Outside of the building&#x27;s entrance, there are imitations of the hands and feet of several characters from Tezuka (as in a true walk of fame) and on the inside, the entry hall, a replica of Princess Knight&#x27;s furniture. On the same floor is a permanent exhibition of manga and a room for the display of anime. The exhibition is divided into two parts: Osamu Tezuka and the city of Takarazuka and Osamu Tezuka, the author.

The second floor contains, along with several exhibitions, a manga library with five hundred works of Tezuka (some foreign editions are also present), a video library, and a lounge with decor inspired by &quot;Kimba the White Lion&quot;.

There is also a glass sculpture that represents the planet Earth and is based on a book written by Tezuka in his childhood called &quot;Our Earth of Glass&quot;.

<text>CoDominium is a series of future history novels written by American writer Jerry Pournelle, along with several co-authors, primarily Larry Niven.

The CoDominium (CD) is a political alliance and union between the United States and the Soviet Union in Pournelle&#x27;s fictional history. Formed to maintain planetary stability, the CD becomes a de facto planetary government and later an interstellar empire, though it halts scientific and political evolution. The U.S. during the CD era is a welfare state with distinct social classes: Citizens and Taxpayers. The empire is organized by sectors, ruled by a Viceroy, and governed by various ministries.

Colonies in the CoDominium are established on habitable planets, founded by various groups such as ethnic minorities, religious groups, and businesses. Elite colonies have advanced technology and fleets, allowing them some independence from the CD. The Outies, systems that retained enough technology to pose a threat, serve as a constant challenge for the Imperial Navy. Jennifer R. Pournelle&#x27;s novel &quot;Outies&quot; is a sequel that explores themes of alienation and the impact of biology on destiny.

==Series==
==Setting==

===Formation of the CoDominium===
The point of departure of Pournelle&#x27;s history is the establishment of the &quot;CoDominium&quot; (CD), a political alliance and later union between the United States of America and a revitalized Soviet Union. This union, achieved in the name of planetary stability, reigns over the Earth for over a hundred years. In that time, it achieves peace of a sort, as well as interstellar colonization, but at the price of a complete halt in both scientific and political evolution.

The CoDominium (CD) is a supranational alliance of the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. This alliance eventually becomes a &quot;de facto&quot; planetary government, and later, an interstellar empire. Despite this, no other nations on Earth are given representation or membership. Other major powers become mere client states. It is governed by a &quot;Grand Senate&quot;, which is composed of Senators chosen from the two superpowers. A CoDominium Council exists and appears to function as a judicial branch. The CD did not unify the United States and the USSR, who appear to retain their separate identities and mutual distrust. The CD was only created for the shared benefit of the two member states. It does not govern either nation, and each state has been allowed to retain their government structures, nationalities, military forces, and to run their own internal affairs.

The United States of the CoDominium Era is a welfare state divided into two social classes: Citizens and Taxpayers. &quot;Citizens&quot; are welfare dependents who are required to live in walled sections of cities called &quot;Welfare Islands.&quot; People are given whatever they need, including the drugs like Borloi to keep them pacified. There are no limits to welfare if they want it, except that they must live on a Welfare Island. Although people are free to gain an education and work or become a colonist, many citizens did not, preferring to live their whole lives supported by the government. Generally, citizens are uneducated and illiterate. Some BuReLoc involuntary colonists are Citizens. By the late CD era, the Welfare Islands were three generations old. &quot;Taxpayers&quot; are the working, educated, and privileged middle to the upper class. They carry identification cards to separate them from Citizens.

The Empire is organized by sectors, ruled by a Viceroy who serves as a representative of the Crown. Each sector has its own Council, headed by a Lord President, and its own Parliament. The Imperial government is divided into several ministries, including External Affairs, War, and Science. Some planets are governed by an aristocracy, although at least one member world is a republic.

For the most part, the stars with inhabitable planets in the CoDominium are obscure and unnamed on current star charts. For instance, the world of New Washington and its sister planet Franklin orbit a red dwarf at some distance from the Solar System. Such stars are very common in the galaxy but even the closest ones are too dim to observe without equipment, Proxima Centauri being the obvious example. Other habitable systems in the CoDominium have stars in the stellar classes F, G and K, which are common but dim compared to the named stars in the night sky. One of the few stars explicitly named in the CoDominium stories is 82 Eridani, containing the Meiji colony. Viewed from Earth, 82 Eridani is a star of the fourth magnitude at 20 light-years distance. Beyond 50 light-years such stars are below sixth magnitude and therefore invisible to the naked eye, so they are unnamed and largely unrecorded, except in astronomical sky surveys. These are the stars likely to host colonies of the CoDominium. There is no mention in the canon of closer candidate systems such as Tau Ceti and Epsilon Indi.

During the CoDominium era, instantaneous interstellar travel as a result of the Alderson Drive gave humanity the ability to explore, colonize, and exploit various star systems. As a result, many of the space settlements are on planets that are similar to Earth. At the very least, a colony world was barely inhabitable for human life without technological support. Many colonies were founded by ethnic minorities, religious groups, or political groups. Some are started by businesses, for commercial reasons. Most lack an industrial base and have little advanced technology as a result. The elite, more technologically advanced colonies are ones settled and supported by the Earth countries. These elite worlds have their own fleets and enjoy some independence from the CD.

These are apparently systems that retained enough technology after the Secession Wars to present a threat to the Second Empire, by resisting takeover and mounting raids against Empire systems. The presence or threat of Outies is mentioned in all the Second Empire stories as a reason for the Imperial Navy having to deal with events in the most expeditious way possible, rather than allowing time to achieve ideal solutions.

Pournelle&#x27;s daughter, Jennifer R. Pournelle, has drawn on these themes, writing &quot;Outies&quot;, an authorized sequel to &quot;King David&#x27;s Spaceship&quot;, &quot;The Mote in God&#x27;s Eye&quot;, and &quot;The Gripping Hand&quot;, that attempts to marry hard science fiction with social science fiction as it explores what it means to be an &quot;alien&quot; in this Empire, and to what degree biology is destiny. &quot;Outies&quot; was first published as an e-book in 2010, and was then released in trade paperback in Q1, 2011.

<text>The thoracic diaphragm, or simply the diaphragm (; ), is a sheet of internal skeletal muscle in humans and other mammals that extends across the bottom of the thoracic cavity. The diaphragm is the most important muscle of respiration, and separates the thoracic cavity, containing the heart and lungs, from the abdominal cavity: as the diaphragm contracts, the volume of the thoracic cavity increases, creating a negative pressure there, which draws air into the lungs. Its high oxygen consumption is noted by the many mitochondria and capillaries present; more than in any other skeletal muscle.

The term &quot;diaphragm&quot; in anatomy, created by Gerard of Cremona, can refer to other flat structures such as the urogenital diaphragm or pelvic diaphragm, but &quot;the diaphragm&quot; generally refers to the thoracic diaphragm. In humans, the diaphragm is slightly asymmetric—its right half is higher up (superior) to the left half, since the large liver rests beneath the right half of the diaphragm. There is also speculation that the diaphragm is lower on the other side due to heart&#x27;s presence.

Other mammals have diaphragms, and other vertebrates such as amphibians and reptiles have diaphragm-like structures, but important details of the anatomy may vary, such as the position of the lungs in the thoracic cavity.

== Structure ==

The diaphragm is an upward curved, c-shaped structure of muscle and fibrous tissue that separates the thoracic cavity from the abdomen. The superior surface of the dome forms the floor of the thoracic cavity, and the inferior surface the roof of the abdominal cavity.

As a dome, the diaphragm has peripheral attachments to structures that make up the abdominal and chest walls. The muscle fibres from these attachments converge in a central tendon, which forms the crest of the dome. Its peripheral part consists of muscular fibers that take origin from the circumference of the inferior thoracic aperture and converge to be inserted into a central tendon.

The muscle fibres of the diaphragm radiate outward from the central tendon. While the diaphragm is one muscle, it is composed of two distinct muscle regions: the costal, which serves as the driver in the work of breathing, and crural diaphragm, which serves as an &quot;anchor;&quot; attaching the muscle to the lower ribs and lumbar vertebrae. The costal diaphragm is further divided into ventral, medial, and dorsal costal portions. 

The vertebral part of the diaphragm arises from the crura and arcuate ligaments. Right crus arises from L1-L3 vertebral bodies and their intervertebral discs. Smaller left crus arises from L1, L2 vertebral bodies and their intervertebral discs. Medial arcuate ligament arises from the fascia thickening from body of L2 vertebrae to transverse process of L1 vertebrae, crossing over the body of the psoas major muscle. The lateral arcuate ligament arises from the transverse process of L1 vertebrae and is attached laterally to the 12th rib. The lateral arcuate ligament also arises from fascia thickening that covers the quadratus lumborum muscle. The median arcuate ligament arises from the fibrous parts of right and left crura where descending thoracic aorta passes behind it. No diaphragmatic muscle arises from the median arcuate ligament. Both adrenal glands lie near the diaphragmatic crus and arcuate ligament.

The costal part of diaphragm arises from the lower four ribs (7 to 10) costal cartilages.

The central tendon of the diaphragm is a thin but strong aponeurosis near the center of the vault formed by the muscle, closer to the front than to the back of the thorax. The central part of the tendon is attached above to pericardium. The both sides of the posterior fibres are attached to paracolic gutters (the curving of ribs before attaching to both sides of the vertebral bodies).

===Openings===

There are a number of openings in the diaphragm through which structures pass between the thorax and abdomen. There are three large openings — one for the aorta (aortic hiatus), one for the esophagus (esophageal hiatus), and one for the inferior vena cava (the caval opening), as well as a series of smaller openings.

The inferior vena cava passes through the caval opening, a quadrilateral opening at the junction of the right and middle leaflets of the central tendon, so that its margins are tendinous. Surrounded by tendons, the opening is stretched open every time inspiration occurs. However, there has been argument that the caval opening actually constricts during inspiration. Since thoracic pressure decreases upon inspiration and draws the caval blood upwards toward the right atrium, increasing the size of the opening allows more blood to return to the heart, maximizing the efficacy of lowered thoracic pressure returning blood to the heart. The aorta does not pierce the diaphragm but rather passes behind it in between the left and right crus.

There are several structures that pierce through the diaphragm, including: left phrenic nerve pierces through the central tendon, greater, lesser, and least thoracic splanchnic nerves pierces through bilateral crura, and lymphatic vessels that pierce throughout the diaphragm, especially behind the diaphragm.


===Nerve supply===
The diaphragm is primarily innervated by the phrenic nerve which is formed from the cervical nerves C3, C4 and C5. While the central portion of the diaphragm sends sensory afferents via the phrenic nerve, the peripheral portions of the diaphragm send sensory afferents via the intercostal (T5–T11) and subcostal nerves (T12).

===Blood supply===

Arteries and veins above and below the diaphragm supply and drain blood.

From above, the diaphragm receives blood from branches of the internal thoracic arteries, namely the pericardiacophrenic artery and musculophrenic artery; from the superior phrenic arteries, which arise directly from the thoracic aorta; and from the lower internal intercostal arteries. From below, the inferior phrenic arteries supply the diaphragm.

The diaphragm drains blood into the brachiocephalic veins, azygos veins, and veins that drain into the inferior vena cava and left suprarenal vein.

===Variation===
The sternal portion of the muscle is sometimes wanting and more rarely defects occur in the lateral part of the central tendon or adjoining muscle fibers.

===Development===
The thoracic diaphragm develops during embryogenesis, beginning in the third week after fertilization with two processes known as transverse folding and longitudinal folding. The septum transversum, the primitive central tendon of the diaphragm, originates at the rostral pole of the embryo and is relocated during longitudinal folding to the ventral thoracic region. Transverse folding brings the body wall anteriorly to enclose the gut and body cavities. The pleuroperitoneal membrane and body wall myoblasts, from somatic lateral plate mesoderm, meet the septum transversum to close off the pericardio-peritoneal canals on either side of the presumptive esophagus, forming a barrier that separates the peritoneal and pleuropericardial cavities. Furthermore, dorsal mesenchyme surrounding the presumptive esophagus form the muscular crura of the diaphragm.

Because the earliest element of the embryological diaphragm, the septum transversum, forms in the cervical region, the phrenic nerve that innervates the diaphragm originates from the cervical spinal cord (C3,4, and 5). As the septum transversum descends inferiorly, the phrenic nerve follows, accounting for its circuitous route from the upper cervical vertebrae, around the pericardium, finally to innervate the diaphragm.

== Function ==

The diaphragm is the main muscle of respiration and functions in breathing. During inhalation, the diaphragm contracts and moves in the inferior direction, enlarging the volume of the thoracic cavity and reducing intra-thoracic pressure (the external intercostal muscles also participate in this enlargement), forcing the lungs to expand. In other words, the diaphragm&#x27;s movement downwards creates a partial vacuum in the thoracic cavity, which forces the lungs to expand to fill the void, drawing air in the process.

Cavity expansion happens in two extremes, along with intermediary forms. When the lower ribs are stabilized and the central tendon of the diaphragm is mobile, a contraction brings the insertion (central tendon) towards the origins and pushes the lower cavity towards the pelvis, allowing the thoracic cavity to expand downward. This is often called belly breathing. When the central tendon is stabilized and the lower ribs are mobile, a contraction lifts the origins (ribs) up towards the insertion (central tendon) which works in conjunction with other muscles to allow the ribs to slide and the thoracic cavity to expand laterally and upwards.

When the diaphragm relaxes (moves in the superior direction), air is exhaled by elastic recoil process of the lung and the tissues lining the thoracic cavity. Assisting this function with muscular effort (called forced exhalation) involves the internal intercostal muscles used in conjunction with the abdominal muscles, which act as an antagonist paired with the diaphragm&#x27;s contraction. Diaphragm dysfunction is a well-known factor associated with various complications in patients, such as prolonged respiratory failure, difficulties in weaning from mechanical ventilation, extended hospitalization, increased morbidity, and mortality. Studies have reported that a thin diaphragm leads to greater lung compliance, which can contribute to respiratory failure. Furthermore, reduction in diaphragm thickness during the early stages of disease can serve as a prognostic marker in sepsis patients, and COVID-19 patients.

The diaphragm is also involved in non-respiratory functions. It helps to expel vomit, feces, and urine from the body by increasing intra-abdominal pressure, aids in childbirth, and prevents acid reflux by exerting pressure on the esophagus as it passes through the esophageal hiatus.

In some non-human animals, the diaphragm is not crucial for breathing; a cow, for instance, can survive fairly asymptomatically with diaphragmatic paralysis as long as no massive aerobic metabolic demands are made of it. 

==Clinical significance==

===Paralysis===
If either the phrenic nerve, cervical spine or brainstem is damaged, this will sever the nervous supply to the diaphragm. The most common damage to the phrenic nerve is by bronchial cancer, which usually only affects one side of the diaphragm. Other causes include Guillain–Barré syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus.

===Herniation===

A hiatus hernia is a hernia in which parts of the lower esophagus or stomach that are normally in the abdomen pass abnormally through the diaphragm and are present in the thorax. Hernias are described as &quot;rolling&quot;, in which the hernia is beside the oesophagus, or &quot;sliding&quot;, in which the hernia directly involves the esophagus. These hernias are implicated in the development of reflux, as the different pressures between the thorax and abdomen normally act to keep pressure on the esophageal hiatus. With herniation, this pressure is no longer present, and the angle between the cardia of the stomach and the oesophagus disappears. Not all hiatus hernias cause symptoms, although almost all people with Barrett&#x27;s oesophagus or oesophagitis have a hiatus hernia.

Hernias may also occur as a result of congenital malformation, a congenital diaphragmatic hernia. When the pleuroperitoneal membranes fail to fuse, the diaphragm does not act as an effective barrier between the abdomen and thorax. Herniation is usually of the left, and commonly through the posterior lumbocostal triangle, although rarely through the anterior foramen of Morgagni. The contents of the abdomen, including the intestines, may be present in the thorax, which may impact development of the growing lungs and lead to hypoplasia. This condition is present in 0.8 - 5/10,000 births. A large herniation has high mortality rate, and requires immediate surgical repair.

===Imaging===
Due to its position separating the thorax and abdomen, fluid abnormally present in the thorax, or air abnormally present in the abdomen, may collect on one side of the diaphragm. An X-ray may reveal this. Pleural effusion, in which there is fluid abnormally present between the two pleurae of the lungs, is detected by an X-ray of the chest, showing fluid collecting in the angle between the ribs and diaphragm. An X-ray may also be used to reveal a pneumoperitoneum, in which there is gas in the abdomen.

An X-ray may also be used to check for herniation.

==Significance in strength training==
The adoption of a deeper breathing pattern typically occurs during physical exercise in order to facilitate greater oxygen absorption. During this process the diaphragm more consistently adopts a lower position within the body&#x27;s core. In addition to its primary role in breathing, the diaphragm also plays a secondary role in strengthening the posture of the core. This is especially evident during deep breathing where its generally lower position increases intra-abdominal pressure, which serves to strengthen the lumbar spine.

The key to real core stabilization is to maintain the increased IAP while going through normal breathing cycles. [...] The diaphragm then performs its breathing function at a lower position to facilitate a higher IAP.

Therefore, if a person&#x27;s diaphragm position is lower in general, through deep breathing, then this assists the strengthening of their core during that period. This can be an aid in strength training and other forms of athletic endeavour. For this reason, taking a deep breath or adopting a deeper breathing pattern is typically recommended when lifting heavy weights.

==Other animals==
The existence of a membrane separating the pharynx from the stomach can be traced widely among the chordates. Thus the model organism, the marine chordate lancelet, possesses an atriopore by which water exits the pharynx, which has been claimed (and disputed) to be homologous to structures in ascidians and hagfishes. The tunicate epicardium separates digestive organs from the pharynx and heart, but the anus returns to the upper compartment to discharge wastes through an outgoing siphon.

Thus the diaphragm emerges in the context of a body plan that separated an upper feeding compartment from a lower digestive tract, but the point at which it originates is a matter of definition. Structures in fish, amphibians, reptiles, and birds have been called diaphragms, but it has been argued that these structures are not homologous. For instance, the alligator diaphragmaticus muscle does not insert on the esophagus and does not affect pressure of the lower esophageal sphincter. The lungs are located in the abdominal compartment of amphibians and reptiles, so that contraction of the diaphragm expels air from the lungs rather than drawing it into them. In birds and mammals, lungs are located above the diaphragm. The presence of an exceptionally well-preserved fossil of &quot;Sinosauropteryx&quot;, with lungs located beneath the diaphragm as in crocodiles, has been used to argue that dinosaurs could not have sustained an active warm-blooded physiology, or that birds could not have evolved from dinosaurs. An explanation for this (put forward in 1905), is that lungs originated beneath the diaphragm, but as the demands for respiration increased in warm-blooded birds and mammals, natural selection came to favor the parallel evolution of the herniation of the lungs from the abdominal cavity in both lineages.

However, birds lack diaphragms. They do not breathe in the same way as mammals and do not rely on creating a negative pressure in the thoracic cavity, at least not to the same extent. They rely on a rocking motion of the keel of the sternum to create local areas of reduced pressure to supply thin, membranous airsacs cranially and caudally to the fixed-volume, non-expansive lungs. A complicated system of valves and air sacs cycles air constantly over the absorption surfaces of the lungs so allowing maximal efficiency of gaseous exchange. Thus, birds do not have the reciprocal tidal breathing flow of mammals. On careful dissection, around eight air sacs can be clearly seen. They extend quite far caudally into the abdomen.

<text>Hildburghausen is a district in Thuringia, Germany. It is bounded by (from the west and clockwise) the district of Schmalkalden-Meiningen, the city of Suhl, the districts of Ilm-Kreis, Saalfeld-Rudolstadt and Sonneberg, and the state of Bavaria (districts of Coburg, Haßberge and Rhön-Grabfeld). Located roughly halfway between the mountain chains of the Rhön and the Thuringian Forest, the district is densely forested and covered by hilly countryside. Its territory is similar to that of the former Ernestine duchy, Saxe-Hildburghausen.

<text>The Darling River (Paakantyi: &quot;Baaka&quot; or &quot;Barka&quot;) is the third-longest river in Australia, measuring from its source in northern New South Wales to its confluence with the Murray River at Wentworth. Including its longest contiguous tributaries, it is long, making it the longest river system in Australia. The Darling River is the outback&#x27;s most famous waterway.

As of the early 2020s, the Darling is in poor health, suffering from over-allocation of its waters to irrigation, pollution from pesticide runoff, and prolonged drought. During drought periods in 2019 it barely flowed at all. The river has a high salt content and declining water quality. Increased rainfall in its catchment in 2010 improved its flow, but the health of the river will depend on long-term management.

The Division of Darling, Division of Riverina-Darling, Electoral district of Darling and Electoral district of Lachlan and Lower Darling were named after the river.

==History==

Aboriginal peoples have lived along the Darling River for tens of thousands of years. The Barkindji people called it &quot;Baaka&quot; or &quot;Barka&quot;, &quot;Barkindji&quot; meaning &quot;people of the Barka&quot;.

The Queensland headwaters of the Darling (the area now known as the Darling Downs) were gradually colonized from 1815 onward. In 1828 the explorers Charles Sturt and Hamilton Hume were sent by the Governor of New South Wales, Sir Ralph Darling, to investigate the course of the Macquarie River. He visited the Bogan River and then, early in 1829, the upper Darling, which he named after the Governor. In 1835, Major Thomas Mitchell travelled a portion of the Darling River. Although his party never reached the junction with the Murray River he correctly assumed the rivers joined.

In 1856, the Blandowski Expedition set off for the junction of the Darling and Murray Rivers to discover and collect fish species for the National Museum. The expedition was a success with 17,400 specimens arriving in Adelaide the next year.

Although its flow is extraordinarily irregular (the river dried up forty-five times between 1885 and 1960), in the later 19th century the Darling became a major transportation route, the pastoralists of western New South Wales using it to send their wool by shallow-draft paddle steamer from busy river ports such as Bourke and Wilcannia to the South Australian railheads at Morgan and Murray Bridge. But over the past century the river&#x27;s importance as a transportation route has declined.

In 1992, the Darling River suffered from a severe cyanobacterial bloom that stretched the length of the river. The presence of phosphorus was essential for the toxic algae to flourish. Flow rates, turbulence, turbidity and temperature were other contributing factors.

In 2008, the Federal government purchased Toorale Station in northern New South Wales for $23 million. The purchase allowed the government to return of environmental flows back into the Darling.

In 2019, a crisis on the Lower Darling saw up to 1 million fish die. A report by the Australia Institute said this was largely due to the decisions by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority on instructions from the New South Wales government. It said the reasons for those decisions appeared to be about building the case for the new Broken Hill pipeline and the Menindee Lakes project. Maryanne Slattery, senior water researcher with the Australia Institute; &quot;To blame the fish kill on the drought is a cop-out, it is because water releases were made from the lakes when this simply shouldn&#x27;t have happened.

A worse fish kill occurred in 2023. Millions of dead bony bream, golden perch and silver perch, and Murray cod flowed down the river at Menindee. The cause was low oxygen levels and high temperatures.

==Course==
The whole Murray–Darling river system, one of the largest in the world, drains all of New South Wales west of the Great Dividing Range, much of northern Victoria and southern Queensland and parts of South Australia. Its meandering course is three times longer than the direct distance it traverses.

Much of the land that the Darling flows through are plains and is therefore relatively flat, having an average gradient of just 16 mm per kilometre. Officially the Darling begins between Brewarrina and Bourke at the confluence of the Culgoa and Barwon rivers; streams whose tributaries rise in the ranges of southern Queensland and northern New South Wales west of the Great Dividing Range. These tributaries include the Balonne River (of which the Culgoa is one of three main branches) and its tributaries; the Condamine [which rises in the Main Range about 100 km inland from Pt. Danger, on the Queensland/New South Wales border], the Macintyre River and its tributaries such as the Dumaresq River and the Severn Rivers (there are two – one on either side of the state border); the Gwydir River; the Namoi River; the Castlereagh River; and the Macquarie River. Other rivers join the Darling near Bourke or below – the Bogan River, the Warrego River and Paroo River.

South east of Broken Hill, the Menindee Lakes are a series of lakes that were once connected to the Darling River by short creeks. The Menindee Lake Scheme has reduced the frequency of flooding in the Menindee Lakes. As a result, about 13,800 hectares of lignum and 8,700 hectares of Black box have been destroyed. Weirs and constant low flows have fragmented the river system and blocked fish passage.

The Darling River runs south-south-west, leaving the Far West region of New South Wales, to join the Murray River on the New South Wales – Victoria border at Wentworth, New South Wales.

The Barrier Highway at Wilcannia, the Silver City Highway at Wentworth and the Broken Hill railway line at Menindee, all cross the Darling River. Part of the river north of Menindee marks the border of Kinchega National Park. In response to the 1956 Murray River flood, a weir was constructed at Menindee to mitigate flows from the Darling River.

The north of the Darling River is in the Southeast Australia temperate savanna ecoregion and the southwest of the Darling is part of the Murray Darling Depression ecoregion.

===Population centres===

Major settlements along the river include Brewarrina, Bourke, Louth, Tilpa, Wilcannia, Menindee, Pooncarie and Wentworth. Wentworth was Australia&#x27;s busiest inland port in the late 1880s.

Navigation by steamboat to Brewarrina was first achieved in 1859. Brewarrina was also the location of intertribal meetings for Indigenous Australians who speak Darling and live in the river basin. Ancient fish traps in the river provided food for feasts. These heritage listed rock formations have been estimated at more than 40,000 years old making them the oldest man-made structure on the planet.

==In popular culture==
Australian poet Henry Lawson wrote a well-known ironic tribute to the Darling River. To quote another Henry Lawson poem:

He also wrote about the river in &quot;The Union Buries Its Dead&quot; and &quot;Andy&#x27;s Gone With Cattle&quot;. Other bush poets who have written about the river include Scots-Australian Will H. Ogilvie (1869–1963) and Breaker Morant (1864–1902).

The Australian band Midnight Oil wrote a song called &quot;The Barka-Darling River&quot; for their album &quot;Resist&quot;, drawing attention to the negative effects of cotton farming on the environment and people connected to the river.

<text>The Qiang people (Qiangic: &quot;Rrmea&quot;; ) are an ethnic group in China. They form one of the 56 ethnic groups officially recognised by the People&#x27;s Republic of China, with a population of approximately 310,000 in 2000. They live mainly in a mountainous region in the northwestern part of Sichuan (Szechwan) on the eastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau.

==Names==
The modern Qiang refer to themselves as Rma ( or , , &quot;erma&quot; in Chinese or &quot;RRmea&quot; in Qiang orthography) or a dialect variant of this word. However, they did not define themselves with the Chinese term &quot;Qiang ethnicity&quot; () until 1950, when they were officially designated &quot;Qiāngzú&quot;.

&quot;Qiang&quot; has been a term that has historically referred less to a specific community, but more to the fluid western boundary of Han Chinese settlers. Chinese philosophers of the Warring States period also mentioned a &quot;&#x27;Di-Qiang&quot;&#x27; peoples living on the western edge of Han territory. They were known for their customs of cremation.

==History==

People called &quot;Qiang&quot; have been mentioned in ancient Chinese texts since they first appeared in oracle bone inscriptions 3,000 years ago. Recognized as a &#x27;first ancestor culture&#x27;, there is evidence of the Qiang in northwestern China dating back to the 16th-11th centuries B.C., when they were recorded bringing tribute to the Shang Dynasty. They were primarily known to practice pastoral nomadism, and resisted westward expansion of the Han Empire, gradually shifting to the south-west of their ancestral lands.

However, the name &quot;Qiang&quot; has been applied to a variety of groups that might not be the same as the modern Qiang. Many of the people formerly designated as &quot;Qiang&quot; were gradually removed from this category in Chinese texts as they become sinicised or reclassified. By the Ming and Qing dynasties, the term &quot;Qiang&quot; denoted only non-Han people living in the upper Min River Valley and Beichuan area, the area now occupied by the modern Qiang. Nonetheless, most modern scholarship assumes that modern Qiang are descended from the historical Qiang people.

Analysis of Han and Western (European) scholarly sources reveals that in the first half of the twentieth century, there was no coherent &#x27;Qiang&#x27; culture in the Upper Min Valley of northwestern Sichuan. Rather, there existed a plethora of inhabited regions with settlers of individual communities identifying themselves as &quot;rma&quot;. A significant cultural variation was observed even among neighboring communities. In particular, Han and Tibetan influences were prevalent in those rural communities.

When Qiang was officially designated an ethnic group in 1950, they numbered only 35,600. Many sought to gain Qiang status due to government policy of prohibition of discrimination as well as economic subsidies for minority nationalities. As a result, the Qiang population has increased due to the reclassification of people. From 1982 to 1990, 75,600 Han people changed their ethnicity to Qiang, and from 1990 to 2000, 96,500 Han people became Qiang. Another 49,200 people reclaimed their Qiang ethnicity from 1982 to 1989. In total, some 200,000 Han people became Qiang. As a result, there were 300,000 Qiang people in 2010, 200,000 of which lived in Sichuan, predominantly in the Ngawa Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture, Beichuan Qiang Autonomous County and in the counties of Mao, Wenchuan, Li, Heishui, and Songpan.

===2008 Sichuan earthquake===
On 12 May 2008, the Qiang people were heavily affected by the 8.0 magnitude 2008 Sichuan earthquake. With 69,142 total deaths, and 17,551 missing, over 30,000 of the people killed were ethnic &quot;Qiang&quot; (10 percent of the total Qiang population). Major restoration efforts were made in the A&#x27;er village, one of the few remaining centers of Qiang culture, by the Beijing Cultural Heritage Protection Center (CHP). Specifically, preservation of the Qiang languages (which have no written form) was of concern, and several recording repositories were made to preserve the tales remembered only by the &quot;shibi&quot; or &quot;duangongs&quot; restoration attempts were made in consideration of the 1989 UNESCO Recommendation on the Safeguarding of Traditional Culture and Folklore, and ensured maximum participation of the local inhabitants, the custodians of the culture that was being preserved. The A&#x27;er stone tower, of particular significance, was carefully restored in 2012 by the A&#x27;er villagers themselves using authentic materials and techniques.

==Languages==
The Qiang speak the agglutinative Qiangic languages, a subfamily of the Tibeto-Burman languages. However, Qiang dialects are so different that communication between different Qiang groups is often in Mandarin. There are numerous Qiang dialects; traditionally they are split into two groups, Northern Qiang and Southern Qiang, although in fact the Qiang language complex is made up of a large number of dialectal continua which cannot be easily grouped into Northern or Southern. The education system largely uses Standard Chinese as a medium of instruction for the Qiang people, and as a result of the universal access to schooling and TV, very few Qiang cannot speak Chinese but many Qiang cannot speak Qiangic languages.

Until recently, there was no script for the Qiang language, and the Qiang used a system of carving marks on wood to represent events or communicate. In the late 1980s a writing system was developed for the Qiang language based on the Qugu (曲谷) variety of a Northern dialect using the Latin alphabet. The introduction has not been successful due to the complexities of the Qiang sound system and the concomitant difficulty of its writing system, as well as the diversity of the Qiang dialects and the lack of reading material. The Qiang also use Chinese characters. More recently, a unique script has been developed specifically for Qiang, known as the Qiang or Rma script.

==Culture and religion==
As a result of their geographic location on the periphery of Tibetan and Han majorities Qiang culture is a unique amalgamation of their own religions and Han, Tibetan, Muslim, and Christian influences. This attests to the significant intra-diversity of the Qiang people, a phenomenon caused almost exclusively by the linguistic barriers and topographical difficulty of the regions they inhabit.

The majority of the Qiang adhere to a pantheistic religion involving guardian mountain deities. Several nearby villages may share a higher-level mountain deity out of proximity. These deities served not just as religious idols, but practical protections of resource rights and territorial boundaries in a region of severe resource competition.

Generally, there is a spectrum spanning from the Eastern edge of the historical Tibetan Kingdoms to the Han Empire – those who live nearer to the Tibetans (northwest) exhibit more elements of Tibetan Buddhism, while Han Chinese culture prevails among those living in the south and east. Due to this, the mountain deities worshiped as village guardians became part of the lowest level of the western Tibetan Buddhist pantheon, while Taoism and Chinese Buddhism temples encroached upon the culture to the east. In eastern temples, mountain deities have disappeared entirely, with religious practice practically indistinguishable from the Han Chinese.

In regards to their local religions, the Qiang practice a form of animism, worshiping nature gods and ancestral spirits, and specific white stones (often placed atop watchtowers) are worshiped as representatives of gods. Villages worship five great deities and twelve lesser ones, though the pantheon consists of gods of equal importance dedicated to almost every social function. However, there is considered to be one supreme &quot;Abamubita&quot; (God of Heaven).

In Qiang villages, the culture is remembered and practice primarily by the &quot;duangong&quot;, known as &quot;bi&quot; in the Qiang language. As keepers of the culture, these village shamans hold great importance in the preservation of Qiang heritage. Though there is no gender limitation, no female &quot;duangongs&quot; exist currently. They are also keepers of the two most important symbols of Qiang religion, known as the &quot;duangong&#x27;s&quot; tools: the sheepskin drum and a preserved a monkey skull, known as the &quot;AbaMullah&quot;.

&quot;Duangongs&quot; function as priests, scholars, medicine men and village elders all rolled into one. Though they live ordinary everyday lives, serving regular social functions as part of the village community, their possession of the &quot;duangong&quot; tools demarcates their explicit importance to the village&#x27;s spiritual culture. Almost all ceremonies, ranging from funerals to healing rituals are performed by the &quot;duangong&quot;. They are believed to have mysterious powers which allow them to be in constant communication with the world of spirits and ghosts, and thus straddle the line between healer and wizard. Important to note, however, is that the &quot;duangong&quot; does not earn his living from his status, but as a worker of whatever trade he chooses. Another key difference between &quot;duangongs&quot; in Qiang culture and the idea of the &#x27;shaman&#x27; is that while shamans are &#x27;chosen by the gods&#x27;, anyone can become a &quot;duangong&quot; given the appropriate training.

To become a &quot;duangong&quot;, one must pass the &quot;gaigua&quot;, an initiation/graduation ceremony where the individual is confirmed in their position by the village and receives their own set of &quot;duangong&quot; tools; the monkey skin hat, sheepskin drum, holy stick, and &quot;AbaMullah&quot;, often handed down over fifteen generations. However, the turbulences of China&#x27;s Cultural Revolution led to the disappearance of many tools, with no shaman currently in possession of a full set. These disappearances are primarily attributed to confiscation by Chinese government search teams in pursuit of Chinese national modernization. However, several tools are postulated to have been hidden away by villagers in an attempt to preserve Qiang possession of their historical artifacts.

For most Qiang villages, consecrated white stones, believed to be imbued with powers of the gods through certain rituals, are placed on the top of towers as a good luck symbols. These squared stone towers are traditionally located on the edge of Qiang villages and on the top of nearby hills as well.

==Lifestyle==
The Qiang today are mountain dwellers. A fortress village, &quot;zhai&quot; , composed of 30 to 100 households, in general, is the basic social unit beyond the household. An average of two to five fortress villages in a small valley along a mountain stream, known in local Chinese as &quot;gou&quot; , make up a village cluster (&quot;cun&quot; ). The inhabitants of fortress village or village cluster have close contact in social life. In these small valleys, people cultivate narrow fluvial plains along creeks or mountain terraces, hunt animals or collect mushrooms and herbs (for food or medicine) in the neighboring woods, and herd yaks and horses on the mountain-top pastures.

In terms of subsistence and diet, northwestern displayed greater reliance on animal husbandry than agriculture, thus consuming more dairy and meat products. Meanwhile, southeastern settlers favor agricultural practices, resulting in greater consumption of grains and wheat. This northwest to southwest gradient is observable in many aspects of Qiang culture due to their geographic location between two distinct (relative) majority cultures.

The Qiang constructed watchtowers and houses with thick stone walls and small windows and doors. Each village may have had one or more stone towers in the past, and these Himalayan Towers still survive in some Qiang villages and remain a distinctive feature in these villages. Though Qiang villages historically served as fortified settlements with several defense mechanisms, these functions were lost over time. The Communist government&#x27;s 1949 establishment saw the removal of defense installations as part of a national unity policy. Villagers live in granite stone houses generally consisting of two to three stories. The first floor is meant for keeping livestock and poultry, while the second floor is meant for the living quarters, and the third floor for grain storage. If the third floor does not exist, the grains will be kept on the first or second floor instead.

Sheep are considered particularly sacred in Qiang culture, as they are the source of much of a village&#x27;s livelihood. As such, wool is the primary material of which clothing is made. Both the menfolk and womenfolk wear gowns made of gunny cloth, cotton, and silk with sleeveless wool jackets. White is particularly sacred as a color among the Qiang. Due to the harsh climate of their lands, the Qiang have developed clothing to adapt to it. A common dress is the &quot;Yangpi Gua&quot; (a kind of sleeveless jacket made of sheepskin or goatskin), and bind puttees to protect against the cold weather. Additionally, they are known to wear the &quot;Tou Pa&quot; (cloth head coverings) around head, waistband, tie an apron around one&#x27;s waist, and wear &quot;Yunyun Shoe&quot; (a sharp-pointed and embroidered shoes with typical Qiang characteristics). The dress, especially, women&#x27;s dress, is trimmed with lace and their collars are decorated with silver ornaments.

Millet, highland barley, potatoes, winter wheat, and buckwheat serve as the staple food of the Qiang. Consumption of wine and smoking of orchid leaves are also popular among the Qiang.

Skilled in construction of roads and bamboo bridges, the Qiang can build them on the rockiest cliffs and swiftest rivers. Using only wooden boards and piers, these bridges can stretch up to 100 meters. Others who are excellent masons are good at digging wells. Especially during poor farming seasons, they will visit neighboring places to do chiseling and digging.

Embroidery and drawn work are done extemporaneously without any designs. Traditional songs related to topics such as wine and the mountains are accompanied by dances and the music of traditional instruments such as leather drums.

==Genetic origin==
Genetic evidence reveals a predominantly Northern Asian-specific component in Qiangic populations, especially in maternal lineages. The Qiangic populations are an admixture of the northward migrations of East Asian initial settlers with Y chromosome haplogroup D (D1-M15 and the later originated D3a-P47) in the late Paleolithic age, and the southward Di-Qiang people with dominant haplogroup O3a2c1*-M134 and O3a2c1a-M117 in the Neolithic Age.
