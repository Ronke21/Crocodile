<text>The Spanish dollar, also known as the piece of eight (, , , or ), is a silver coin of approximately diameter worth eight Spanish reales. It was minted in the Spanish Empire following a monetary reform in 1497 with content fine silver. It was widely used as the first international currency because of its uniformity in standard and milling characteristics. Some countries countermarked the Spanish dollar so it could be used as their local currency.

Because the Spanish dollar was widely used in Europe, the Americas, and the Far East, it became the first world currency by the 16th century.

The Spanish dollar was the coin upon which the original United States dollar was based (at ), and it remained legal tender in the United States until the Coinage Act of 1857. Many other currencies around the world, such as the Japanese yen and the Chinese yuan, were initially based on the Spanish dollar and other 8-real coins. Most theories trace the origin of the &quot;$&quot; symbol, which originally had two vertical bars, to the pillars of Hercules wrapped in ribbons that appear on the reverse side of the Spanish dollar.

The term peso was used in Spanish to refer to this denomination, and it became the basis for many of the currencies in the former Spanish viceroyalties, including the Argentine, Bolivian, Chilean, Colombian, Costa Rican, Cuban, Dominican, Ecuadorian, Guatemalan, Honduran, Mexican, Nicaraguan, Paraguayan, Philippine, Puerto Rican, Peruvian, Salvadoran, Uruguayan, and Venezuelan pesos. Of these, &quot;peso&quot; remains the name of the official currency in the Philippines, Mexico, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Colombia, Chile, Argentina, and Uruguay.

==History==
===Etymology===
In the 16th century, Count Hieronymus Schlick of Bohemia began minting a silver coin known as a , named after &quot;,&quot; the valley in the Ore Mountains where the silver was mined. was later shortened to &quot;thaler&quot; or , a word that eventually found its way into many European languages including the Spanish and English as &quot;dollar&quot;.

===Europe and colonial North America===
The weighed of silver. These coins&#x27; success led to similar s being minted in Burgundy and France and their ultimate succession by the long-lived Reichsthaler of the Holy Roman Empire, used from the 16th to 19th centuries, of pure silver.

The Netherlands also introduced its own dollars in the 16th century: the Burgundian Cross Thaler (&quot;Bourgondrische Kruisdaalder&quot;), the German-inspired &quot;Rijksdaalder&quot;, and the Dutch lion dollar (&quot;leeuwendaalder&quot;). The latter coin was used for Dutch trade in the Middle East, in the Dutch East Indies and West Indies, and in the Thirteen Colonies of North America.

For the English North American colonists, however, the Spanish peso or &quot;piece of eight&quot; has always held first place, and this coin was also called the &quot;dollar&quot; as early as 1581. After the Declaration of American Independence, the United States dollar was introduced in 1792 at par with this coin at 371.25 grains = 0.7735 troy ounces = 24.0566 g. Alexander Hamilton arrived at these numbers based on a treasury assay of the average fine silver content of a selection of worn Spanish dollars.

The term &quot;cob&quot; was used in Ireland and the British colonies to mean a piece of eight or a Spanish-American dollar, because Spanish gold and silver coins were irregularly shaped and crudely struck before the machine-milled dollar was introduced in 1732.

===Spain===

After the introduction of the Guldengroschen in Austria in 1486, the concept of a large silver coin with high purity (sometimes known as &quot;specie&quot; coinage) eventually spread throughout the rest of Europe. Monetary reform in Spain brought about the introduction of an 8-real (or 1-peso) coin in 1497, minted to the following standards-
* In 1497: dollars to a Castilian mark of silver (230.0465 grams), or 0.9306 fine (25.561 g fine silver = 0.8218 oz t)
* In 1728: $8.50 to a mark, or 0.9167 fine (24.809 g fine silver = 0.7976 oz t)
* In 1772: $8.50 to a mark, or 0.9028 fine (24.443 g fine silver = 0,78554 oz t); but true fineness 1772–1821 believed to be only 0.89.

This was supplemented in 1537 by the gold &quot;escudo&quot;, minted at 68 to a mark of gold 0.917 fine (fineness reduced to 0.906 in 1742 and 0.875 in 1786). It was valued at 15–16 reales or approximately 2 dollars. The famed &quot;Gold Doubloon&quot; was worth 2 escudos or approximately 4 dollars.

From the 15th to the 19th centuries the coin was minted with several different designs at various mints in Spain and the New World, having gained wide acceptance beyond Spain&#x27;s borders. Thanks to the vast silver deposits that were found mainly in Potosí in modern-day Bolivia and to a lesser extent in Mexico (for example, at Taxco and Zacatecas), and to silver from Spain&#x27;s possessions throughout the Americas, mints in Mexico and Peru also began to strike the coin. The main New World mints for Spanish dollars were at Potosí, Lima, and Mexico City (with minor mints at Bogotá, Popayán, Guatemala City, and Santiago), and silver dollars from these mints could be distinguished from those minted in Spain by the Pillars of Hercules design on the reverse.

The dollar or peso was divided into 8 reales in Spanish Latin America until the 19th century when the peso was divided into 100 centavos. However, monetary turbulence in Spain beginning under the reign of King Philip II resulted in the dollar being subdivided as follows in Spain only:
* Until 1642: $1 = 8 reales, subsequently called &quot;reales nacionales&quot;
* From 1642: $1 = 10 &quot;reales provinciales&quot;
* From 1687: $1 = &quot;reales de vellón&quot; (made of billon alloy; edict not effective)
* From 1737: $1 = 20 &quot;reales de vellón&quot; 
* In 1864: $1 = 2 silver escudos (different from the gold escudo)
* And finally, in 1869: $1 = 5 Spanish pesetas, the latter at par with the French franc in the Latin Monetary Union.

Spain&#x27;s adoption of the peseta in 1869 and its joining the Latin Monetary Union meant the effective end of the last vestiges of the Spanish dollar in Spain itself. However, the 5-peseta coin (or &quot;duro&quot;) was slightly smaller and lighter but was also of high purity (90%) silver.

In the 1990s, commemorative 2,000-peseta coins were minted, similar in size and weight to the dollar.

===Mexico===

Following independence in 1821, Mexican coinage of silver reales and gold escudos followed that of Spanish lines until decimalization and the introduction of the peso, worth 8 reales or 100 centavos. It continued to be minted to Spanish standards throughout the 19th century, with the peso at of 0.9028 fine silver, and the escudo at of 0.875 fine gold. The Mexican peso or 8-real coin continued to be a popular international trading coin throughout the 19th century.

After 1918, the peso was reduced in size and fineness, with further reductions in the 1940s and 1950s. Coins of 2- (1921), 5- (1947), and 10-peso (1955) denominations were also minted during the same period, with sizes and fineness similar to the old peso.

===Australia===
After the colony of New South Wales was founded in Australia in 1788, it ran into the problem of a lack of coinage, particularly since trading vessels took coins out of the colony in exchange for their cargo. In 1813, Governor Lachlan Macquarie made creative use of £10,000 in Spanish dollars sent by the British government. To make it difficult to take the coins out of the colony, and to double their number, the centres of the coins were punched out. The punched centre, known as the &quot;dump&quot;, was valued at 15 pence, and the outer rim, known as the &quot;holey dollar&quot;, was worth five shillings. This was indicated by overstamping the two new coins. The obverse of the holey dollar was stamped the words &quot;New South Wales&quot; and the date, 1813, and the reverse with the words &quot;five shillings&quot;. The obverse of the dump was stamped with a crown, the words &quot;New South Wales&quot; and the date, 1813, and the reverse with the words &quot;fifteen pence&quot;. The mutilated coins became the first official currency produced specifically for circulation in Australia. The expedient was relatively short lived. The British Parliament passed the Sterling Silver Money Act in 1825, which made British coins the only recognised form of currency and ended any legitimate use of the holey dollar and dump in the Australian colonies.

===United States===
The Coinage Act of 1792 created the United States Mint and initially defined the United States dollar at par with the Spanish dollar due to its international reputation:
By far the leading specie coin circulating in America was the Spanish silver dollar, defined as consisting of 387 grains of pure silver. The dollar was divided into &quot;pieces of eight,&quot; or &quot;bits,&quot; each consisting of one-eighth of a dollar. Spanish dollars came into the North American colonies through lucrative trade with the West Indies. The Spanish silver dollar had been the world&#x27;s outstanding coin since the early 16th century, and was spread partially by dint of the vast silver output of the Spanish colonies in Latin America. More important, however, was that the Spanish dollar, from the 16th to the 19th century, was relatively the most stable and least debased coin in the Western world.

The Coinage Act of 1792 specified that the U.S. dollar would contain 371.25 grains (24.057 g) pure or 416 grains (26.96 g) standard silver. This specification was based on the average weight of a random selection of worn Spanish dollars which Alexander Hamilton ordered to be weighed at the Treasury. Initially this dollar was comparable to the 371–373 grains found in circulating Spanish dollars and aided in its exportation overseas. The restoration of the old 0.9028 fineness in the Mexican peso after 1821, however, increased the latter&#x27;s silver content to 24.44 g and reduced the export demand for U.S. dollars.

Before the American Revolution, owing to British mercantilist policies, there was a chronic shortage of British currency in Britain&#x27;s colonies. Trade was often conducted with Spanish dollars that had been obtained through illicit trade with the West Indies. Spanish coinage was legal tender in the United States until the Coinage Act of 1857 discontinued the practice. The pricing of equities on U.S. stock exchanges in -dollar denominations persisted until the New York Stock Exchange converted first to pricing in sixteenths of a dollar on 24 June 1997, and then in 2001 to decimal pricing.

===Africa===
In Egypt, Spanish dollars with the pillars of Hercules on the back had amuletic and magical significance. These pillars were interpreted as cannons by Egyptians, which are made of iron. Iron is useful in defending against jinn, leading to the magical association.

===Asia===
Long tied to the lore of piracy, &quot;pieces of eight&quot; were manufactured in the Spanish Americas and transported in bulk back to Spain, making them a very tempting target for seagoing pirates. In the Far East, it also arrived in the form of the Philippine peso in the Philippines as part of the Spanish East Indies of the Spanish colonial empire through the Manila galleons that transported Mexican silver peso to Manila in the Manila-Acapulco Galleon Trade, where it would be exchanged for Philippine and Chinese goods, since silver was the only foreign commodity China would accept. In Oriental trade, Spanish dollars were often stamped with Chinese characters known as &quot;chop marks&quot; which indicated that particular coin had been assayed by a well-known merchant and determined to be genuine. The specifications of the Spanish dollar became a standard for trade in the Far East, with later Western powers issuing trade dollars, and colonial currencies such as the Hong Kong dollar, to the same specifications.

The first Chinese yuan coins had the same specification as a Spanish dollar, leading to a continuing equivalence in some respects between the names &quot;yuan&quot; and &quot;dollar&quot; in the Chinese language. Other currencies also derived from the dollar include the Japanese yen, Korean won, Philippine peso, Malaysian ringgit, French Indochinese piastre, etc. since it was widely traded across the Far East in the East Indies and the East Asia.

Contemporary names used for Spanish dollars in Qing dynasty China include běnyáng (本洋), shuāngzhù (双柱), zhùyáng (柱洋), fóyáng (佛洋), fótóu (佛頭), fóyín (佛銀), and fótóuyín (佛頭銀). The &quot;fó&quot; element in those Chinese names referred to the King of Spain in those coins, as his face resembled that of images of the Buddha (佛 in Chinese); and the &quot;zhù&quot; part of those names referred to the two pillars in the Spanish coat of arms.

==Fiction==

In modern pop culture and fiction, pieces of eight are most often associated with the popular notion of pirates.

* In Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s &quot;Treasure Island&quot;, Long John Silver&#x27;s parrot has learned to cry out &quot;Pieces of eight!&quot; This use tied the coin (and parrots) to fictional depictions of pirates. Deriving from the wide popularity of this book, &quot;pieces of eight&quot; is sometimes used to mean &quot;money&quot; or &quot;a lot of money&quot;, regardless of specific denomination, and also as a synonym for treasure in general.
* In the film &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: At World&#x27;s End&quot; the Pirate Lords must meet together by presenting the &quot;Nine Pieces of Eight&quot;, since these Pieces were used to seal the goddess Calypso in her human form by the first Brethren Court. The ninth &quot;piece of eight&quot; hangs off Jack Sparrow&#x27;s bandana in the early films, up to its destruction in this film.
* In Terry Pratchett&#x27;s &quot;Going Postal&quot;, the antagonist Reacher Gilt (who physically resembles a stereotypical pirate) has a cockatoo named Alphonse which has been trained to say &quot;Twelve and half percent!&quot;, that is to say a single piece of eight.

<text>The music of contemporary nomadic and rural [[Turkmen people]] is closely related other Central Asian folk forms and is descended from Arab and Persian forms of the Middle Ages. Important musical traditions in Turkmen music include traveling singers and shamans called &quot;bagshy&quot;, who act as healers and magicians and sing either a cappella or accompanied by the dutar, a two-stringed lute. The Central Asian classical music tradition, mugam, is also present in Turkmenistan under the name mukamlar.

==Classical Turkmen folk music==

According to Soviet musicologist Viktor Belyayev, Turkmen classical folk music is directly descended from Arabic music as taught and performed in Khorezm, particularly in Bukhara, which was the musical center of the Islamic world in the 13th century. The Turkic tribes of Central Asia, including the predecessors of today&#x27;s Turkmen, abandoned their own culture in the 9th century and shifted to Arab culture, including music, with their adoption of Islam.The Arabic musical tradition at that time bore Greek influences on local music dating to the 4th-century conquest by Alexander the Great as well as some Christian influence from the pre-Islamic period. Belyayev notes later influences of Azerbaijani and Afghan music as well. A terracotta figurine from ancient Merv dating to the 2nd through 4th centuries CE portrays a wandering minstrel bearing an instrument resembling the dutar.

Belyayev also remarked that it is difficult to separate Arab from Persian influence, noting that kidnapped Persian brides were doubtless a source of Persian influence on Turkmen folk music, given the prevalence of certain Persian melodic influences, including the existence of the augmented second in Turkmen music and use of three Persian musical modes.

Gullyyev and Rejepova assert that the epic poem Gorkut Ata reveals the names of early medieval instruments, the &quot;gopuz&quot;, &quot;surnaý&quot;, &quot;bory&quot;, and &quot;nagara&quot;, but concede that information on Turkmen musical culture of the 9th through 15th centuries is virtually nonexistent. Musician and musicologist Mamed Guseynov, however, notes...information on musical instruments contained in the works of al-Farabi, al-Kindi, Ibn Sina, Safi al-Din and al-Urmavi (IX-XIII centuries) [allows reconstruction of] the appearance of more than seventy musical instruments that were widely popular among Turkmens at different times. By the beginning of the XX century, only a few instruments, the most compact and convenient for transportation during migrations, were in demand. These are dutar, gyjak, varieties of tuiduk and gopuz.

Belyayev asserted that Turkmen love of music is rooted in the lack of other entertainment options while pursuing a nomadic lifestyle in the broad steppes.

===Style===

Turkmen classical folk music is vocal, the chanting of poems while the singer () accompanies himself on a dutar. Poetry is not simply read; it is sung or chanted to music. Belyayev described it as &quot;halfway between declamation and singing.&quot; All traditional music thus features lyrics, which in reality are highly structured poems. Belyayev and Uspenskiy identified six major themes of Turkmen folk songs:
* religion,
* disillusionment with life (the dominant theme),
* military, criminal, or hunting subjects,
* love,
* curative (not lacking in shamanist undertones),
* history. 

They noted that humorous songs also exist but that &quot;&quot;bagşy&quot; generally do not sing them.&quot;&lt;br&gt;

The Soviet Turkmen Academy of Sciences classified folk music as follows:
* &quot;halk aýdymlary&quot; (folk songs),
* &quot;läle&quot; (maidens&#x27; songs),
* &quot;monjugatdy&quot; (fortune-telling songs),
* &quot;hüwe&quot; (lullabies),
* &quot;ýaremazan&quot; (caroling),
* &quot;oleň&quot; (wedding songs),
* &quot;agy&quot; (mourning songs).

More recently, Turkmen composer and musicologist Suhan Tuýlyýew has reclassified folk music somewhat differently, in two broad categories:&lt;br&gt;
 folklore, which includes
* &quot;hüwdi&quot; (lullabies),
* work songs sung by women while milking livestock (&quot;höwlüm&quot;) or milling grain (&quot;höküdük&quot;),
* ritual songs, including &quot;monjugatdy&quot;, religious songs, wedding songs, laments, plus &quot;süýtgazan&quot;, sung to bring rain,
* lyrical songs, divided into &quot;läle&quot; and &quot;hymmyl&quot; sung by women and love songs sung by men,
* children&#x27;s songs,
* legends, and
 professional music, sung by &quot;bagşy&quot; and consisting of recitation of &quot;dessan&quot;, the traditional epic poetry. Turkmen musicologist Şahym Gullyýew generally shares these categories, though he includes lullabies among children&#x27;s songs (though they are not sung by children), and includes all songs involving legends in professional songs.

Turkmen folk musical tradition generally lacks choral music, dancing, and percussion instruments. The main instrument is the dutar, a strummed, two-string member of the lute family. The primary wind instrument is the tuiduk (), a type of flute. The dutar is traditionally played solo; if in a duet, the musicians () take turns, and normally play in competition to determine which is the better. The appearance of dutars playing in ensemble, or performing purely instrumental music, is a relatively recent phenomenon not in keeping with tradition. Percussion instruments (the tambourine, mainly) are encountered rarely and then primarily in areas heavily influenced by Uzbek musical culture.

Other instruments include the gyjak, a bowed string instrument, and the dilli tuiduk, a reed woodwind.

===Musical form===

The principal form follows this structure:
# &quot;başlamak&quot; (beginning or introduction)
# &quot;ýappyldak&quot; (first movement, slower and usually in a lower register)
# &quot;şirwan&quot; (climax or culmination, the middle movement)
# &quot;çykmak&quot; (a calming close, the last movement)

Improvisation does not exist in music performed by professional &quot;bagshy&quot;; these musicians adhere strictly to traditional forms that have been preserved for centuries. The Smithsonian Institution describes performance as &quot;highly structured and harmonically organized&quot;, with the pitch of the dutar being raised &quot;as many as seven times&quot; during a performance and the &quot;bagshy&quot; saving the &quot;most emotionally charged poetry&quot; for the highest pitch.

Turkmen poems consist of separate stanzas, &quot;each itself consisting of four or five lines.&quot; The last line of each successive stanza repeats the rhythm of the last line of the first stanza; other lines follow the poem&#x27;s general rhythm. The fourth stanza contains a radif (), a feature of Arabic and Persian poetry.

Gullyyew and Rejepowa note the influence of Turkmen poet laureate Magtymguly Pyragy on musical form beginning in the 18th century, when, they postulate, &quot;bagşy&quot; split into two groups, the &quot;dessançy&quot; (reciters of poetry) and &quot;tirmeçi&quot; (singers). In the 19th century &quot;bagşy&quot; began favoring performance of poetry by Mämmetweli Kemine, Seyitnazar Seydi, Zelili, and Mollanepes.

===Scales and modes===

Uspenskiy and Belyayev identified seven basic scales, five of them analogous to Greek scales:
# Phrygian scale
# Aeolian scale
# Dorian scale
# Mixolydian scale
# Hypophrygian scale

Scales 6 and 7 have no analogues:
6. A, B flat, C, D, E, F sharp, G, A, B
7. augmented second, A, B flat, C sharp, D, E, mordent

They note that scales 1, 2, 4, 5, and 7 have alternate forms. The origin of these scales is uncertain, but most probably from the ancient Greeks and Arabs with some influence of the Persians, as noted above. Tuýlyýew further described two types of scales, &quot;natural&quot; and &quot;ancient national Turkmen modes&quot;.

Many songs use only 5 or 6 notes, and some are limited to 3 or 4 notes. Belyayev concedes that &quot;to the inexperienced ear [Turkmen music] can seem monotonous and uniform&quot; due to the &quot;figurative severity of the coloration and the absence of any calculation of the external effect.&quot;

===Dynamics===

The &quot;bagşy&quot; chants loudly, a legacy of performance in the open air of the steppes, and &quot;is devoid of any bravura&quot;. Turkologist Ármin Vámbéry described a &quot;bagşy&quot; producing &quot;gutteral sounds resembling more the trilling of larks than a human singing.&quot; Chanting of poetry involves significant tension of the vocal cords and use mainly of the upper register.

==Women&#x27;s songs==
British sociologist Carole Blackwell points out the difference between folk songs sung by male &quot;bagşy&quot; and Turkmen women, each of which fulfills &quot;important but quite different functions.&quot; Folk poems chanted by men, mainly &quot;dessan&quot; poems, in her words depict &quot;epic, historical and mythical events.&quot; Women, on the other hand, sing to express their feelings. The folks songs of Turkmen women...were created in a society that denied women the right to speak freely and valued their subservience and acquiescence...the women expressed feelings of sadness, anger, passon, and hope and found comfort in the realisation that they were not alone. 

Types of women&#x27;s songs include &quot;läleler&quot; (literally wild flowers), the songs of unmarried girls, which tend toward sadness and tales of woe; &quot;toý aýdymlary&quot; (literally celebration songs), which are wedding songs; &quot;hüwdüler&quot;, lullabies; &quot;agylar&quot;, lamentations sung at funerals; and &quot;monjukatdylar&quot;, fortune-telling songs, sung during the Novruz holiday. The last category of songs is sung privately, away from men, for many of them &quot;express emotions...that Turkmen women were not supposed to have, or admit to.&quot; Although suppressed by Soviet authorities, since Turkmenistan became independent promotion of Turkmen culture has led to some preservation of these folk songs.

== Modern Turkmen classical music ==
Until 1919, music schools did not exist in Turkmenistan. In that year the Proletarian Conservatory of Transcaspian Oblast was founded in Ashgabat, with a branch in Mary starting in 1920. The Turkmen Artistic Technicum, with a music department, opened in 1929 in Ashgabat, and children&#x27;s music schools opened in several cities in 1935. An opera and ballet studio opened in Ashgabat in 1937. Further, in 1935 a Turkmen department was founded in the Moscow Conservatory, to which gifted children were sent. As Victoria Clement has pointed out, the Soviets sought to control all symbols of power, including music. 

By the end of the 1930s graduates of these institutions began composing European-style music, based on European scales and modes but incorporating Turkmen motifs, among them Weli Muhadow, Daňatar Öwezow, and Aman Gulyýew. Following the outbreak of World War II, many Russian and Ukrainian composers and musicians were transferred from cities near the front lines to Central Asia, including Turkmenistan, which exerted a strong European classical influence on Turkmen compositions. European-style operas based on Central Asian themes, such as &quot;Shasenem and Garyp&quot;, &quot;Leyli and Mejnun&quot;, and &quot;Zohre and Tahir&quot;, resulted from these collaborations.

In 1941 the Turkmen State Orchestra of Folk Instruments was founded, which developed modern orchestral arrangements of folk tunes. By the 1950s Soviet Turkmen composers had shifted from producing modern orchestral arrangements of traditional epics to paeans to Soviet power, including &quot;Bagt kantatasy&quot; (Joy Cantata), &quot;Kommunistik partiýa hakynda kantata&quot; (Cantata about the Communist Party), &quot;Lenin barada oýlanma&quot; (Thought of Lenin), and &quot;Salam Moskva&quot; (Hello, Moscow).

In the 1970s Turkmen composer Nury Halmammedov began to emerge as Turkmenistan&#x27;s most prominent European-style classical music composer, offering compositions arranged for Western orchestration but, as Turkmen singer Medeniyet Shahberdiyeva, who performed many of his works, remarked, &quot;The rhythms of Nury&#x27;s works are Turkmen, but the harmony belongs to world musical culture.&quot; Halmammedov was not recognized widely, however, until after his death in 1983.

In 2001 then-President Saparmurat Niyazov banned opera as well as ballet in order to &quot;protect Turkmen culture&quot;. Opera remained prohibited until 2019.

===National anthem===
As a Soviet republic, Turkmenistan&#x27;s national anthem was &quot;Turkmenistan&quot;, composed by Weli Muhadow with words by Aman Kekilow. In 1997, well after independence, the anthem was changed to the &quot;National anthem of Independent, Neutral, Turkmenistan&quot;, the music and lyrics of which were allegedly written by President-for-Life Saparmurat Niyazov, but which in reality were written by a composers collective headed by Rejep Allaýarow.

===Mugam===

Mugam is a more contemporary, less traditional pan-Central Asian style of classical music, performed in Turkmenistan by a dutarist () and gyjakist (), or by an ensemble of just dutarists ().

==Contemporary popular music==
During the Soviet period the Güneş Ensemble, a &quot;one-of-a-kind band that blended together progressive rock, jazz, funk, and Turkmen vocals,&quot; was the lone popular music group incorporating elements of Turkmen folk music traditions. The group produced about 20 long-play record albums between 1970 and 1986 under the Soviet Union&#x27;s Melodiya label. Over roughly a decade and a half, Güneş transitioned from a typical group performing Turkmen folk songs and Soviet compositions to a jazz fusion, ethno jazz, and progressive rock set of genres. The ensemble broke up in 1986, after which some of its former members developed a &quot;synth-heavy Turkmen folk music that combined modulated traditional male vocals with incredibly fast-paced arrangements on drum machines and synthesizers.&quot;

These genres were banned following independence in 1991, when then-President Saparmurat Niyazov prohibited several art forms, including lip-synching, karaoke, ballet, and opera. Following Niyazov&#x27;s death in 2006, pop tunes with Turkmen lyrics began circulating Turkmenistan on cassette tapes and CDs, most of them merely covers of foreign hits translated into Turkmen. Today Turkmen pop music consists almost wholly of covers of foreign pop tunes from across the globe, but especially from countries with weak enforcement of intellectual property rights.

==Folk instruments==
===Dutar===

The dutar is the most representative instrument of Turkmen folk music. It is used in many styles, ranging from the mukamlar and saltıklar to the kirklar and navoi. These are performed by professional musicians called &quot;sazanda&quot;. Dutar means &quot;two strings&quot; in Persian. The word “dutar” itself is first found in the work “Scientific and Practical Canons of Music”, authored by Zainulabiddin al-Husayni, a Central Asian scholar and musician who lived in the 15th century.

===Gyjak===

The gyjak is a bowed stringed instrument adopted by Turkmen folk musicians only in the 19th century, first by the Khiva Turkmen, later in what is today western Turkmenistan, and only toward the end of the century in the Ahal tribal area. The gyjak was traditionally made out of a pumpkin shell or imported coconut hull, and was strung with three silk strings. In the 20th century mulberry wood replaced the pumpkin shell and silk string gave way to metal. The gyjak is tuned in fourths and is played as part of an ensemble with one or more dutars, or as a solo instrument, typically performing songs written for the dutar. Guseynov describes it as possessing a rich timbre and being loud.

===Tuiduk===
Tuiduk () is a type of flute. In Turkmen folklore, an ancestral belief posits that Adam, crafted from clay, lacked a soul until the harmonious tunes of the tuiduk, played by Archangel Gabriel, breathed life into him. A Turkmen legend attributes the invention of the tuiduk to the devil. Preserving ancient traditions, a ceremonial ritual invites guests to celebrations, where two tuiduk players face each other, elevating their instruments and harmoniously playing in unison. While doing this they perform magic circular movements which remind that this ritual used to be linked to shamanism. Guyseynov describes the tuiduk as &quot;made of a hollow stem of an umbrella plant called &quot;gargygamyş&quot; and has six playing holes: five on the front side and one on the back side.&quot;

===Dilli tuiduk===

The Dilli tuiduk () is a Turkmen woodwind instrument. It is a clarinet-like, single-reed instrument used mainly in Turkmen folk music. The instrument&#x27;s range is greater than its finger holes would suggest, the upper registers being attained by breath control. Dilli tuiduk of the Turkmen can be carved in a couple of minutes by a shepherd in the springtime, when reeds grow tall. Dilli means &quot;with tongue&quot; in Turkmen and refers to the reed. Guseynov notes, &quot;The dilli tuiduk (tuiduk with a tongue), one of the oldest musical instruments in the history of mankind, is even simpler. Its length does not exceed the size of a pencil. [The] muzzle is made of thin dry reed with a hollow stem, with a notched single reed and three holes. 

===Gargy tuiduk===

Gargy tuiduk () is a long reed flute whose origin, according to legend, is connected with Alexander the Great. A similar instrument existed in ancient Egypt. Gargy means &quot;reed&quot; in the Turkmen language.

===Shamanic and folk instruments===
Shaman &quot;bagşy&quot; exorcised evil spirits through use of specific instruments, including the &quot;dep&quot; or &quot;deprek&quot;, the Central Asian tambourine which descended directly from the Parthian tambourine depicted on rhytons found in ancient Nisa; the &quot;jaň&quot;, a small bell hung around the neck of the lead sheep in a flock or the lead camel in a caravan; the &quot;düwme&quot;, miniature tambourines hung on an infant&#x27;s cradle or stitched to children&#x27;s and women&#x27;s clothing to protect them from evil; the &quot;üsgülewük&quot;, a children&#x27;s whistle molded from clay in the form of a mountain goat or bird; the &quot;gopuz&quot;, or Jew&#x27;s harp, and the &quot;şaldyrak&quot;, a stick with jingling noisemakers. Guseynov describes the &quot;şaldyrak&quot; as a rattle consisting of a heavy stone staff topped by a copper ball containing small stones and featuring small bells and jingling metal pendants. Tuýlyýew includes &quot;çemçeler&quot; or spoons as a folk percussion instrument.

<text>Kyrgyz music is nomadic and rural, and is closely related to Turkmen and Kazakh folk forms. Kyrgyz folk music is characterized by the use of long, sustained pitches, with Russian elements also prominent.

==Traditional music==
Travelling musicians and shamans called manaschi are popular for their singing and komuz-playing. Their music is typically heroic epics, such as the most famous story, the &quot;Manas epic&quot; (20 times longer than Homer&#x27;s Odyssey), which is the patriotic tale of a warrior named Manas, and his descendants, who fight with the Chinese. There are modern reciters of the &quot;Manas&quot; who are very popular, such as Rysbek Jumabaev and Sayaqbay Karalaev.

Aside from the komuz, Kyrgyz folk instruments include the kyl kiak (qyl-qyiyak), a two-stringed upright bow instrument (cf. fiddle), sybyzgy, a side-blown flute, &quot;chopo-choor&quot; and the &quot;temir ooz komuz&quot; (mouth komuz), also known as jaw harp in some countries. The komuz is the national instrument of Kyrgyzstan. It is a plucked string instrument. The kyl kiak, however, is also an important symbol of Kyrgyz identity. It is a string instrument, related to the Mongolian morin khuur, and is associated with horses and the vital role they play in Kyrgyz culture. Shamanistic elements of Kyrgyz folk culture remain, including the &quot;dobulba&quot; (a frame drum), the &quot;asa-tayak&quot; (a wooden device decorated with bells and other objects) and the earlier mentioned kyl kiak.

A widespread variety of instrumental music called &quot;kui&quot; (or &quot;küü&quot;) tells narratives that revolve around a musical journey. The narrative, which is entirely expressed without words, is sometimes punctuated with exaggerated gestures to mark important parts of the story.

===Performers===

Modern interpreters of Kyrgyz traditional music include the &quot;Kambarkan&quot; national folk ensemble.

Salamat Sadikova is a popular traditional Kyrgyz singer with a strong voice, who is capable of holding notes for a remarkably long duration. Her repertoire includes contemporary folk-style compositions as well as folk songs.

Other notable acts include Tengir-Too, the Djunushov Brothers, Jusup Aisaev, Gulnur Satylganova, and Zere Asylbek. Kyrgyz writer and musician Elmirbek Imanaliyev died in April 2020.

==Western classical music==

During the Soviet rule, Kyrgyz music and performance arts has incorporated many Western genres and influences. The was established in 1926. Kyrgyz composers created numerous operas and music for ballet performances.

==Pop music==
Rock and metal music is popular in Kyrgyzstan. Darkestrah is a well-known metal band from Bishkek, now based in Germany. Their music combines traditional Kyrgyz folk music with black metal. Since the 2010s rap music by local artists in both Kyrgyz and Russian has significantly gained popularity. In the 2020s the capital of Kyrgyzstan witnessed a wave of protest rap songs, most famously the song &quot;Sayasat&quot; (&quot;Politics&quot;), in which the rapper Begish unleashed a scathing critique against corruption in Kyrgyz politics. Other politically-motivated rap songs deal with environmental issues such as the extreme air pollution in Bishkek. There is also a new pop genre called Z-Pop which influenced mainly by K-Pop and western pop music.

<text>Music of Kazakhstan refers to a wide range of musical styles and genres deriving from Kazakhstan. Kazakhstan is home to the Kazakh State Kurmangazy Orchestra of Folk Instruments, the Kazakh State Philharmonic Orchestra, the Kazakh National Opera and the Kazakh State Chamber Orchestra. The folk instrument orchestra was named after Kurmangazy Sagyrbayuly, a well-known composer and dombra player from the 19th century.

==Traditional music==
Traditional music in Kazakhstan often refers to music of the following genres:

* Instrumental music, with the pieces (&quot;Küy&quot;) being performed by soloists. Text is often seen in the background (or &quot;program&quot;) for the music, as a lot of Küy titles refer to stories.
* Vocal music, either as part of a ceremony such as a wedding (mainly performed by women), or as part of a feast. Here we might divide into subgenres: epic singing, containing not only historical facts, but as well the tribe&#x27;s genealogy, love songs, didactic verses; and as a special form the composition of two or more singers in public (Aitys), of dialogue character and usually unexpectedly frankly in content.

=== Traditional musical instruments===

The most popular traditional instruments are string instruments. First of them is the dombra (), the most popular and the oldest Kazakh music instrument. Some argue that nomads have used similar two-string instruments more than two thousand years ago. The dombra is a long-necked lute with two strings tuned in the interval of a fourth or sometimes a fifth. The strings are plucked or strummed by the right hand without a plectrum.

The other instrument playing an important role is the Qobyz, which is a bowed instrument held between the legs. It is made of carved wood for the body, animal skin for the resonator, and horse hair for the strings, and the bow. The Qobyz is said to have been invented by the legendary shaman Qorqyt, long before the medieval ages.
The &quot;Zhetigen&quot; (&quot;Seven strings&quot;) could be seen as a member of the cither family, finding equivalents in China, with the strings being divided each in two parts of different lengths, the bridge being movable and consisting of small bone. There is also a plucked lute called sherter ().

* Dombra (Kazakh: ) is a stringed instrument of the Turkic, which is widely spread among the Turks. Dombra is made of hollow wood, wooden parts and two strings. 19 (sometimes 22) keys are attached to the neck. Has variation as three-stringed dombra, double-sided, wide-body, hollow-necked, etc. 
* Kobyz (khylkobyz (Kazkah: )) is a stringed-bowed instrument. Kobyz has a bucket-shaped body, an arcuate curved neck and a large flat head. The half of surface is covered with skin. Strings and bow are made of horse hair. It is made of solid wooden block. Often done with two strings, but also there are three-stringed, four-stringed kobyz and has variations like &quot;nar kobyz&quot;, &quot;jez kobyz&quot;.
* Jew&#x27;s harp (shankobyz (Kazakh: шаңқобыз)) is an ancient musical instrument of the Kazakh people that is made of silver or iron. It is not so big, with a body and arcuate tongue. The way you play on this instrument is directly related to the interaction with the oral cavity. When playing the instrument, use the right hand to pull the instrument by the tongue. In ancient times, the shankobyz was a child&#x27;s and a woman&#x27;s instrument. Shankobyz has many names in different nations: vargan, temir komuz, komys, aure, komus, vaniar, tumra, kousian, etc.
* Sherter (Kazakh: шертер) is a stringed instrument. It is played like dombyra, but the bone is less than dombyra and it looks like a kobyz. It is made of wood, but the exterior is covered with skin. It is mostly played by shepherds, and often used for accompaniment of fables.
* Jetigen (Kazakh: жетіген) is a polychord instrument. The form of instrument is oblong, with the shape of a box. 13 (or it can be 7) strings are attached to both ends of the box and there are special wooden parts on each string. All of the Turkic cultures have jetigen, but have different names of it: Tatars &quot;etigan&quot;, Tyvalks &quot;shatkan&quot;, etc.
*Dauylpaz (Kazakh: дауылпаз) is a percussion instrument which was a military instrument. In ancient times, it lifted the spirit of warriors and hunters. In structure it resembles an ordinary drum. The manufacturing process is very complicated: you need to make groove in wood, cover the top with skin, make a belt to carry it everywhere and a stick to beat it.
* Kongyrau (Kazakh: қоңырау) is a musical instrument that is made of gold or silver. The structure is close to the bell. Bells of different sizes are distributed on a wooden base and, when stressed, produces an enjoyable ringing. Some artists attach the to the top of their instrument while playing.
* Zhelbuaz (Kazakh: желбуаз)
* Asatayak (Kazakh: асатаяқ)

Traditional Kazakh instruments are often used in contemporary music and play a big role in Kazakh music. Traditional orchestras include &quot;&quot;Otryrar Sazy&quot;, &quot;Kurmangazy Orchestra&quot;, &quot;Al-Faraby sazy&quot;&quot;, and a number of others. Kazakh instruments are used not only by artists but also are an integral part of the life of almost every Kazakh.

==Russian and Soviet-era music==

The Russian influence on the music life in Kazakhstan can be seen in two spheres:
* First, the introduction of musical academic institutions such as concert houses with opera stages, conservatories (where European music was performed and taught).
* Second, by trying to incorporate Kazakh traditional music into these academic structures.

Controlled by the Russian Empire and then the Soviet Union, Kazakhstan&#x27;s folk and classical traditions became connected with ethnic Russian music and Western European music. Prior to the 20th century, Kazakh folk music was collected and studied by ethnographic research teams including composers, music critics and musicologists. In the first part of the 19th century, Kazakh music was transcribed in linear notation. Some composers of this era set Kazakh folk songs to Russian-style European classical music.

Kazakh musicians themselves, however, did not write their own music with notation until 1931. Later, as part of the Soviet Union, certain Kazakh folk culture was encouraged to avoid political and social unrest. The result was a derivative of Kazakh folk music. In 1920, Aleksandr Zatayevich, a Russian official, created major works of art music with melodies and other elements from Kazakh folk music. Beginning in 1928 and accelerating in the 1930s, he also adapted traditional Kazakh instruments for use in Russian-style ensembles (such as increasing the number of frets and strings). Soon, these styles of modern orchestral playing became the only way for musicians to officially play; Kazakh folk was turned into patriotic, professional and socialist endeavors. In their work, many artists of the early 90&#x27;s turn to folk music, processing of folk works and songs in the Kazakh language. Thus, the group URKER, appearing on the music scene in 1994, was one of the first to raise the topic of patriotism and the revival of cultural values in their work.

One of the breakthrough musical projects of the 90s was the first international music festival &quot;Asia Dauysy&quot;. Having appeared in 1990, the festival was held annually at the Medeo venue, bringing together artists from around the world on its stage. The festival became the starting point in the musical career for many Kazakhstani musicians, such as Nurlan Abdullin and Bauyrzhan Isayev.

In the modern world, the baton of &quot;Asia Dauysy&quot; was picked up by the music festival &quot;A Star of Asia&quot;, which is traditionally held at the Medeo venue since 2017.

An equally popular musical project that appeared in the 90s is the annual competition of young performers &quot;Zhas Kanat&quot;. Both solo performers and ensembles took part in the competition, and the project itself opened a new generation of singers for the Kazakh stage, such as Zhanna Sattarova, the group &quot;Ayan&quot; and Madina Sadvakasova.

== Musical institutions ==
The Musical-Dramatic Training College, founded in 1931, was the first institute of higher education for music in Kazakhstan. Two years later, the Orchestra of Kazakh Folk Musical Instruments was formed The Foundation Asyl Mura is archives and publishes historical recordings of Kazakh music both traditional and classical. The Qurmanghazy Conservatoire is considered one of the leading conservatoires in Almaty.

== Contemporary genres ==

=== Kazakh hip hop ===
The Kazakh hip hop and rap scene started to emerge in the country after the Dissolution of the Soviet Union. Hip-hop easily flourished in Kazakhstan due to the use of Russian in its songs, which makes it easier for Kazakh rappers to achieve popularity in other Russian-speaking countries. Kazakh groups such as Tristar began to be featured on MTV Russia. Hip-hop is arguably the most popular contemporary music genre in Kazakhstan, especially among the youth. In 2013, American rapper Kanye West was privately invited by President Nursultan Nazarbayev to perform at his grandson&#x27;s wedding. 

==== Rap culture ====
In 1995-1999, the Rap Zone group appeared on the music scene, which was the first among many to instill the love of young people for domestic rap music. The band members recorded their albums on cassettes.

Especially breakthrough was their track &quot;Noise-boom-boom-Coup&quot;, which became the anthem of young people, and RAP ZONE inscriptions were emblazoned on yard fences, houses and in school diaries.

The popularization of rap in Kazakhstan reached its peak in the 2010s and 2020s. For the most part, current rappers are inspired by Western artists, looking for references in world and national culture, thanks to which rap in Kazakhstan is now quite distinctive and unique. Most often, this genre is in the greatest demand among young people, which from now on is not just played in the background, but consciously and with interest listened to. The most popular artists at the moment are Scriptonite, Hiro, V$XV Prince, De Lacure, etc. 

==== R&#x27;n&#x27;b ====
In addition to traditional pop music, hip-hop and r&#x27;n&#x27;b developed rapidly in Kazakhstan, which found a response in the work of such groups as Ghetto Dogs, Metis&#x27;s, Not Everything Is Said and the group 101 led by Ivan Breusov.

Later on in the 2010s, Kazakh hip-hop would influence the development of the Q-pop music genre. Well-known Kazakh rappers are Jah Khalib, Natan, and Scriptonite.

=== Kazakh rock ===
Kazakh rock is a form of rock music in Kazakhstan, with lyrics written and performed both in Kazakh and Russian. Rock music has been popular in Kazakhstan, especially in Karaganda Region, since the 1960s, when it was popularized by The Beatles. During the Soviet era, Kazakhstan was exposed to both American and Russian rock. Local punk rock was started in Almaty in the late eighties by such bands as The Moloty, Subway and Po-1. Well-known Kazakh rock bands are Adaptatsiya, Ulytau, and Urker.

=== Q-pop ===
Q-pop or Qazaq pop is a comparatively new musical genre of Kazakhstan. The term was first coined in 2015. Q-pop originates from K-Pop, hip-hop, Western pop and J-Pop respectively. Kazakhstani entertainment company Juz Entertainment has been credited as the pioneer of the genre, with its boy group Ninety One debuting in 2015. Artists like Ziruza, Mad Men, DNA, Alba and CrystalZ also contribute to the genre.

The prize-winning Kazakh singer Dimash Kudaibergen mixes pop with elements of classical music and traditional Kazakh folk music. In September 2022, Dimash caused a furor on Twitter after singing the Kazakh anthem before Gennady Golovkin&#x27;s boxing bout against Canelo Alvarez.

Kazakh singer Rukhiya Baydukenova specializes in pop vocals. She was the Grand Prix winner of the 2021 Slavianski Bazaar in Vitebsk International Festival of Arts, also known as the Slavic Bazaar. 

=== Toi ===
Toi (Той; literally means public gathering) refers to easy-listening folk music with catchy rhythm, usually performed in weddings and festives. This genre is also popular in Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Kyrgyzstan. Well-known Kazakh toi singers are Qairat Nurtas, Abdijappar Alqoja, Madina Saduakasova and Jazira Baiyrbekova.

<doc id="309777" wikidata="Q3328772" url="?curid=309777" title="Music of Tajikistan">
<text>[[Tajikistan|Tajik]] [[music]] is closely related to other Central Asian forms of music. The classical music is shashmaqam, which is also distinctive in Uzbekistan. Southern Tajikistan has a distinctive form of folk music called falak, which is played at celebrations for weddings, circumcisions and other occasions.

==Tajik folk music==
Tajik folk music is traditionally divided into three styles, Pamir (Mountain-Badakhshan province), Central Kuhistoni (Hisor, Kulob, Gharm provinces) and Sogdiana&#x27;s northern style; the latter is part of the same musical culture as the adjacent regions of Uzbekistan (Kashkadarya Province and Surkhandarya Province). There are many kinds of songs, both lyrical and instrument, including work songs, ceremonial, funeral, wedding and musical epics, especially the central Tajik heroic legend &quot;Gurugli&quot; also known as &quot;Omar Sham Sham&quot;.

===Gharibi===

&quot;Gharibi&quot; is &quot;the song of a stranger&quot;, an early 20th-century innovation of poor farm laborers and other workers who had to leave their land.

===Holiday music===
Gulgardoni is a springtime holiday (also called &quot;Boychechak&quot;) which includes carolling celebratory songs accompanied by the dutar and doira.

Sayri Guli Lola is the &quot;holiday of tulips&quot;, which includes accompanied choral and dance music. The most important song of this holiday is called &quot;Naqshi Kalon&quot;.

The birth of a child is cause for special musical celebration. Traditional puppeteers play on the doira, qayroq, surnay and nag&#x27;ora. There are other variations, and folk songs like &quot;Na`at&quot; and &quot;Munojot&quot;, performed at the circumcision ceremony of a male child.

Traditional Tajik wedding music is played by &quot;sozanda&quot;, professional musicians, mostly female, who are part of ensembles called the dasta.

===Badakhshan===

Badakhshan is a region inhabited by Tajik Ismailis, known for their sung spiritual poetry called &quot;madah&quot;. Lutes are a major part of Ismaili folk music.

<text>Azerbaijani music (Azerbaijani: Azərbaycan musiqisi) is the musical tradition of the Azerbaijani people from Azerbaijan Republic. Azerbaijani music has evolved under the badge of monody, producing rhythmically diverse melodies. Music from Azerbaijan has a branch mode system, where chromatisation of major and minor scales is of great importance. 
== Classical music ==

In 1920, Azerbaijani classical music had undergone a renaissance and Baku Academy of Music was founded to give classical musicians the same support as folk musicians. Modern-day advocates of Western classical music in Azerbaijani include Farhad Badalbeyli, Fidan Gasimova and Franghiz Alizadeh.

===Opera and Ballet===


The emergence of opera and ballet in Azerbaijan is associated with the Imperial Russian and Soviet era of Azerbaijani history, when Azerbaijani musicians became exposed to European music traditions first-hand. The very first documented performance of an opera in Baku took place in May 1889 when Alexey Verstovsky&#x27;s opera &quot;Askold&#x27;s grave&quot; was staged at a circus arena in Baku (on the site of the current Azerbaijan Carpet Museum building), accompanied by the folk choir of Dmitry Agrenev-Slavyanski. Beginning in 1900, opera troupes toured Baku on a yearly basis (except 1901 and 1913), featuring prominent singers of the time such as Natalia Ermolenko-Yuzhina and Antonina Nezhdanova.

Prominent Azerbaijani opera singers such as Bulbul, Shovkat Mammadova, Fatma Mukhtarova, Huseyngulu Sarabski, Hagigat Rzayeva, Rashid Behbudov, Rauf Atakishiyev, Muslim Magomayev, Lutfiyar Imanov, Fidan and Khuraman Gasimovas, Rubaba Muradova, Zeynab Khanlarova and many other singers gained world fame.

== Folk music ==
Most songs recount stories of real-life events and Azerbaijani folklore, or have developed through song contests between troubadour poets. Corresponding to their origins, folk songs are usually played at weddings, funerals, and special festivals.

=== Folk instruments ===
Instruments used in Azerbaijani music include the stringed instruments &quot;tar&quot; (skin faced lute), the &quot;kamancha&quot; (skin faced spike fiddle), the &quot;oud&quot;, originally &quot;barbat&quot;, and the &quot;saz&quot; (long-necked lute); the double-reed wind instrument &quot;balaban&quot;, the frame drum &quot;ghaval&quot;, the cylindrical double faced drum &quot;nagara&quot; (&quot;davul&quot;), and the &quot;gosha nagara&quot; (pair of small kettle drums). Other instruments include the &quot;garmon&quot; (small accordion), &quot;tutek&quot; (whistle flute), and &quot;daf&quot; (frame drum).

Due to the cultural crossbreeding prevalent during the Ottoman Empire, the tutek has influenced various cultures in the Caucasus region, e.g. the duduks. The zurna and naghara duo is also popular in rural areas, and played at weddings and other local celebrations.

===Ashiqs===
Ashiqs are traveling bards who sing and play the saz, a form of lute. Their songs are semi-improvised around a common base. This art is one of the symbols of Azerbaijani culture and considered an emblem of national identity and the guardian of Azerbaijani language, literature and music.

Since 2009 the art of Azerbaijani Ashiqs has been inscribed on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.

===Meykhana===
Meykhana is a distinctive Azerbaijani literary and folk rap tradition, consisting of an unaccompanied song performed by one or more people improvising on a particular subject. Meykhana is distinct from spoken word poetry in that it is performed in time to a beat.

Meykhana is often compared to hip hop music, also known as &quot;national rap&quot; among Azerbaijani residents, as it also includes performers that is spoken lyrically, in rhyme and verse, generally to an instrumental or synthesized beat. Performers also incorporate synthesizers, drum machines, and live bands. Meykhana masters may write, memorize, or improvise their lyrics and perform their works a cappella or to a beat.

===Mugham===
Mugham is one of the many folk musical compositions from Azerbaijan, in contrast with &quot;Tasnif&quot;, &quot;Ashugs&quot;. Mugam draws on Arabic maqam.

It is an art form that weds classical poetry and musical improvisation in specific local modes. Mugham is a modal system. Unlike Western modes, &quot;mugham&quot; modes are associated not only with scales but with an orally transmitted collection of melodies and melodic fragments that performers use in the course of improvisation. Mugham is a compound composition of many parts. The choice of a particular mugham and a style of performance fits a specific event. The dramatic unfolding in performance is typically associated with increasing intensity and rising pitches, and a form of poetic-musical communication between performers and initiated listeners.

Three major schools of mugham performance existed from the late 19th and early 20th centuries - the region of Garabagh, Shirvan, and Baku. The town of Shusha of Karabakh was particularly renowned for this art.

The short selection of Azerbaijani mugham played in balaban, national wind instrument was included on the Voyager Golden Record, attached to the Voyager spacecraft as representing world music, included among many cultural achievements of humanity.

In 2003, UNESCO proclaimed mugham as a Masterpiece of Oral and Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.

== Popular music ==
Popular music is distinguished from the traditional genres as those styles that entered the Azerbaijani musicality after the fall of the Soviet Union, either due to attempts of national modernization from 1918 onwards, the opening of the republic to Western musical influences or modern fusions and innovations from artists themselves.

=== Mainstream pop ===

Azerbaijani pop music had its humble beginnings in the late 1950s with Azerbaijani cover versions of a wide range of imported popular styles, including rock and roll, tango, and jazz. As more styles emerged, they were also adopted, such as hip hop, heavy metal, and reggae.

Azerbaijani pop music reached a new level after the country made its debut appearance at the 2008 Eurovision Song Contest. The country&#x27;s entry gained the third place in 2009 and fifth the following year. Ell and Nikki won the first place at the Eurovision Song Contest 2011 with the song &quot;Running Scared&quot;, entitling Azerbaijan to host the contest in 2012, in Baku.

The biggest pop stars in Azerbaijan are arguably Roya, Aygun Kazimova and Brilliant Dadashova.

=== Azerbaijani jazz ===
The Azerbaijani jazz is a popular variety of jazz, widespread in Azerbaijan. It covers a broad range of styles (traditional, post-bop, fusion, free flexion) and often features a blend with traditional Azerbaijani music. Among modern famed Azeri jazz musicians are Aziza Mustafazadeh, who was influenced by Bill Evans and Keith Jarrett, Isfar Sarabski, Salman Gambarov and Rain Sultanov.

=== Azerbaijani hip hop ===
The first Azerbaijani hip-hop song &quot;Yesterday is Past&quot;, created in 1983 by Chingiz Mustafayev, who would later become Azerbaijan&#x27;s national hero for unrelated reasons.
The pioneer of Azerbaijani rap often associated with name of Anar Nagilbaz in 1992, which also included elements of disco but the popularity of the rap genre came with the rise of Dayirman, which included primarily patriotic elements.

=== Azerbaijani rock ===
The Azerbaijani rock scene began in the mid-to-late 1960s, when popular United States and United Kingdom bands became well-known. Soon, a distinctively Azerbaijani fusion of rock and folk emerged; this was called Azerbaijani rock, a term which nowadays may be generically ascribed to most of the Azerbaijani rock. Coldünya and Yuxu are the best known group of older classical Azerbaijani rock music.

=== Electronic dance music ===
There are many clubs across Azerbaijan, especially across its Baku region. The alternative music scene, however, is derived mostly from Baku&#x27;s club scene that sees DJs merging the past with the present, utilising traditional motifs with new age sounds and electronic music.

<doc id="309779" wikidata="Q3328738" url="?curid=309779" title="Music of Uzbekistan">
<text>The music of [[Uzbekistan]] has reflected the diverse influences that have shaped the country. It is very similar to the music of the Middle East and is characterized by complicated rhythms and meters. Because of the long history of music in the country and the large variety of music styles and musical instruments, Uzbekistan is often regarded as one of the most musically diverse countries in Central Asia.

== Classical music of Uzbekistan ==
The music of what is now Uzbekistan has a very long and rich history. Shashmaqam, a Central Asian classical music style, is believed to have arisen in the cities of Bukhara and Samarqand in the late 16th century. The term &quot;shashmaqam&quot; translates as &quot;six maqams&quot; and refers to the structure of music with six sections in different musical modes, similar to classical Persian traditional music. Interludes of spoken Sufi poetry interrupt the music, typically beginning at a low register and gradually ascending to a climax before calming back down to the beginning tone.

After Turkestan became part of the Russian Empire in the 19th century, first attempts were taken to record national melodies of Turkestan. Russian musicians helped preserve these melodies by introducing musical notation in the region.

In the 1950s, Uzbek folk music became less popular, and the genre was barred from radio stations by the Soviets. They did not completely dispel the music. Although banned, folk musical groups continued to play their music in their own ways and spread it individually. After Uzbekistan gained independence from the USSR in the early 1990s, public interest revived in traditional Uzbek music. Nowadays Uzbek television and radio stations regularly play traditional music.

The people&#x27;s Artist of Uzbekistan Turgun Alimatov is an Uzbek classical and folklore composer, and tanbur, dutar, and sato player. His compositions include &quot;Segah&quot;, &quot;Chorgoh&quot;, &quot;Buzruk&quot;, &quot;Navo&quot;, and &quot;Tanovar&quot;. His image is associated with national pride and has been presented as the symbol of Uzbek classical music to the world.

Another well-known Uzbek composer is Muhammadjon Mirzayev. His most famous compositions include &quot;Bahor valsi&quot; (&quot;The Spring Waltz&quot;) and &quot;Sarvinoz&quot;. &quot;Bahor valsi&quot; is played on Uzbek television and radio channels every spring.

Sherali Joʻrayev was a singer of traditional Uzbek music. However, he fell out of favour with the Uzbek government, who banned his performances on Uzbek TV as well as his public performances beginning in 2002. He still performed at Uzbek wedding parties and in other countries to popular acclaim.

In recent years, singers such as Yulduz Usmonova and Sevara Nazarkhan have brought Uzbek music to global audiences by mixing traditional melodies with modern rhythms and instrumentation. In the late 2000s, Ozodbek Nazarbekov mixed contemporary music with elements of traditional Uzbek music.

== Western Classical music in Uzbekistan ==
Uzbekistan has also produced many notable composers and performers in the European classical art music idiom, and is home to notable symphony orchestras, festivals, and contemporary music ensembles. The State Conservatory of Uzbekistan, based in Tashkent and founded in 1936, is the nation&#x27;s leading higher education institution for the professional training of musicians.

== Contemporary music of Uzbekistan ==
Many forms of popular music, including folk music, pop, and rock music, have particularly flourished in Uzbekistan since the early 1990s. Uzbek pop music is well developed, and enjoys mainstream success via pop music media and various radio stations.

Many Uzbek singers such as Sevara Nazarkhan, Sogdiana Fedorinskaya, and Rayhon Ganieva have achieved commercial success not only in Uzbekistan but also in other CIS countries such as Kazakhstan, Russia, and Tajikistan.

===Rock===

Currently rock music enjoys less popularity than pop music in Uzbekistan.

An Uzbekistani metal band who has some degree of recognition is Night Wind, a folk metal group. Other Uzbekistani metal groups include Iced Warm, Salupa, Zindan, and Agoniya ().

===Rap===
Rap music has become popular among Uzbek youth. Rappers such as Shoxrux became very popular among young people in the 2000s. However, the Uzbek government censors rap music. It has set up a special body to censor rap music because it believes this type of music does not fit the Uzbek musical culture.

<text>New Jersey Transit Corporation, branded as NJ Transit or NJTransit and often shortened to NJT, is a state-owned public transportation system that serves the U.S. state of New Jersey and portions of the states of New York and Pennsylvania. It operates buses, light rail, and commuter rail services throughout the state, connecting to major commercial and employment centers both within the state and in its two adjacent major cities, New York City and Philadelphia. In , the system had a ridership of .

Covering a service area of , NJT is the largest statewide public transit system and the third-largest provider of bus, rail, and light rail transit by ridership in the United States.

NJT also acts as a purchasing agency for many private operators in the state; in particular, buses to serve routes not served by the transit agency.

== History ==

NJT was founded on July 17, 1979, an offspring of the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT), mandated by the state government to address many then-pressing transportation problems. It came into being with the passage of the Public Transportation Act of 1979 to &quot;acquire, operate, and contract for transportation service in the public interest.&quot; NJT originally acquired and managed a number of private bus services, one of the largest being those operated by the state&#x27;s largest electric company, Public Service Electric and Gas Company. It gradually acquired most of the state&#x27;s bus services. In northern New Jersey, many of the bus routes are arranged in a web. In southern New Jersey, most routes are arranged in a &quot;spoke-and-hub&quot; fashion, with routes emanating from Trenton, Camden, and Atlantic City.

In 1983, NJT assumed operation of all commuter rail service in New Jersey from Conrail, which had been formed in 1976 through the merging of a number of financially troubled railroads. Conrail had operated two extensive commuter railroad networks in northern New Jersey under contract to NJDOT; in turn, these lines were the successors of numerous commuter routes dating from the mid-19th century. NJT now operates every passenger and commuter rail line in the state except for Amtrak; the Port Authority Trans-Hudson (PATH), which is owned by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey; the PATCO Speedline, which is owned by the Delaware River Port Authority; two SEPTA Regional Rail lines, the West Trenton Line and the Trenton Line; and a handful of tourist trains in the southern and northwestern parts of New Jersey. Since inception, rail ridership has quadrupled.

In the 1990s, the rail system expanded, with new Midtown Direct service to New York City and new equipment. On October 21, 2001, it opened a new station at Newark Liberty International Airport. On December 15, 2003, it opened the Secaucus Junction transfer station, connecting its two commuter networks in northern New Jersey for the first time. The new station allowed passengers on trains to Hoboken Terminal to transfer to trains to New York Penn Station in Midtown Manhattan, saving an estimated 15 minutes over connecting with PATH trains at Hoboken. On October 31, 2005, NJT took over Clocker (NY–Philadelphia) service from Amtrak. Four new trains were added to the schedule, but cut back to Trenton.

During Hurricane Sandy in October 2012, the rail operations center of NJ Transit was flooded by of water and an emergency generator submerged. Floodwater damaged at least 65 locomotive engines and 257 rail cars.

== Governance ==
The Governor of New Jersey appoints a thirteen-member Board of Directors, consisting of eleven voting and two non-voting members. The voting members consist of eight from the general public and three State officials. The two non-voting members are &quot;recommended by labor organizations representing the plurality of employees&quot;. The Governor has veto power on decisions made by the board.

== Current operations ==

NJT splits its operations into three classes: bus, light rail, and commuter rail, operated by four legal businesses: NJ Transit Bus Operations, Inc., subsidiaries NJ Transit Mercer, Inc. and NJ Transit Morris, Inc., and NJ Transit Rail Operations, Inc..

=== Bus ===

NJT Bus Operations operates 253 bus routes using 2,221 buses. Its subsidiaries NJ Transit Mercer and NJ Transit Morris operate those routes concentrated in Trenton and Monmouth and Morris counties. Additional buses are also leased out to several private New Jersey operators, including Coach USA, Lakeland, Transbridge Lines, and Academy.

=== Light rail ===

NJT operates three light rail systems:

*Hudson–Bergen Light Rail – Three lines comprising a total of 24 stations and in length, running along the Hudson Waterfront from Bayonne to North Bergen in Hudson County. 
*Newark Light Rail – Two lines comprising a total of 12 stations and in length, running to and from major transportation hubs in Newark and the surrounding area. 
*River Line – A single line comprising a total of 21 stations and in length, running along the Delaware River from Trenton to Camden. The line runs diesel multiple unit trains.

=== Commuter rail ===
NJT operates thirteen commuter rail lines, two of which are operated under a contract with Metro-North Railroad.
*Atlantic City Line
*Bergen County Line
*Main Line
*Meadowlands Rail Line (for special events at the Meadowlands Sports Complex only)
*Montclair-Boonton Line
*Morris &amp; Essex Lines, consisting of:
**Morristown Line
**Gladstone Branch
*North Jersey Coast Line
*Northeast Corridor Line (includes the Princeton Branch)
*Pascack Valley Line (Stations in New York operated under a contract with Metro-North Railroad)
*Port Jervis Line (under a contract with Metro-North Railroad)
*Raritan Valley Line

== Police ==
The New Jersey Transit Police Department (NJTPD) is the transit police agency of NJ Transit. New Jersey Transit Police operates under the authority of Chapter 27 of the NJ Revised Statutes. Title 27:25-15.1 states in part &quot;The Transit Police Officers so appointed shall have general authority, without limitation, to exercise police powers and duties, as provided by law for police officers and law enforcement officers, in all criminal and traffic matters at all times throughout the State and, in addition, to enforce such rules and regulations as the corporation shall adopt and deem appropriate.&quot;

One of the primary responsibilities of NJ Transit Police is to provide police services and security to the hundreds of bus terminals, rail stations, light-rail stations and all other property owned, operated and leased by NJ Transit throughout the state. The Department employs approximately 250 sworn police officers.

== Projects ==
=== Ongoing projects ===
==== Gateway Program ====

This project will expand and restore the Northeast Corridor through a series of phases. It will create new capacity that will allow the doubling of passenger trains running under the Hudson River. The program will increase track, tunnel, bridge, and station capacity, eventually creating four mainline tracks between Newark, NJ, and Penn Station, New York, including a new, two-track Hudson River tunnel. It is being undertaken in partnership with Amtrak, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the State of New Jersey, and the State of New York.

===== Portal Bridge Replacement Project =====
This project will replace the existing century-old swing-span bridge with a new, fixed-span bridge over the Hackensack River. The current bridge causes train traffic and delays due to maritime traffic, as well as malfunctions occurring from opening and closing; the new bridge will eliminate the movable span, thus improving reliability and increasing train speeds. The project is partnered with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, NJ Transit, Amtrak, and United States Department of Transportation, with funding provided by NJ Transit, Amtrak, and the Federal Railroad Administration.

=====Hudson Tunnel Project=====
This project will entail the design and construction of a new Hudson River rail tunnel serving Penn Station, New York, and the rehabilitation and modernization of the existing North River Tunnels, which incurred serious and ongoing damage during Hurricane Sandy. The tunnel was flooded with millions of gallons of saltwater during Hurricane Sandy, causing corrosion that continues to damage the century-old tunnel. It plans to build a new tunnel, rather than close and renovate the existing tunnel, as doing so would leave only one of the North River Tunnels in service, which would cause a massive reduction in rail service. As of 2018, the final design was completed and it is being advanced through the U.S. Department of Transportation TIGER grant. The project is partnered with the FRA, PANYNJ, NJ Transit and Amtrak, all of which have provided a total funding of $86.5 million.

==== Hudson–Bergen Light Rail (HBLR) Northern Branch Extension ====

This project will extend the Hudson–Bergen Light Rail from North Bergen in Hudson County to Englewood in Bergen County. The extension will better meet the needs of travelers in the area, advance cost-effective transit solutions, improve regional mobility and access, reduce roadway congestion, and attract growth and development. There have been several public hearings so far, and the project has received the Supplemental Draft Environmental Impact Statement from the Environmental Protection Agency. The final EIS was expected to be completed by the end of 2019. As of December 2022, the project is still in its design phase, and NJT was given a $600K federal grant to study transit-oriented development along the proposed extension.

==== Hudson-Bergen Light Rail (HBLR) Route 440 Extension ====
This project will extend Hudson-Bergen Light Rail access in Jersey City. It will extend service from West Side Avenue Station by of new rail to a new terminus on the west side of Route 440. An environmental assessment has been prepared by NJ Transit, and the Federal Transit Administration has issued a Finding of No Significance Impact (FONSI). Preliminary engineering began in 2018. The new station will be a contributing factor to the $180 million urban renewal project of Bayfront. There is also a project to improve Route 440 itself near the rail extension. As of 2020, the project is still ongoing after upgrades were made to West Side Avenue Station

====Lackawanna Cut-Off Restoration Project====

In May 2001, New Jersey acquired the right-of-way of the Lackawanna Cut-Off. Constructed by the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad between 1908 and 1911, this provided a direct route with minimal curves and grades between Slateford Junction, two miles (3.25 km) below the Delaware Water Gap, and the crest of the watershed at Lake Hopatcong (Port Morris Junction), the connection with NJT&#x27;s Montclair-Boonton Line. This would restore long-distance service that the Erie Lackawanna last provided with the &quot;Lake Cities&quot; in 1970.

At the time of the Cut-Off&#x27;s construction, the DL&amp;W had extensive experience with concrete construction, but not on the scale that would be employed on the Cut-Off. All structures, including stations, bridges, interlocking towers and two large viaducts and thousands of fence posts, were made of concrete. Despite the lack of maintenance on these structures over the past four decades (and in some cases much longer), most are still in operational or near-operational condition. A 2009 study by NJT estimated that bringing the line back into operation to Scranton, Pennsylvania, would cost approximately $551 million, although service may be extended in several interim phases before reaching Scranton.

In 2011, the Lackawanna Cut-Off Restoration Project from Port Morris to Andover, a distance of , began. The project was delayed by a lack of environmental permits to clear the roadbed between Lake Lackawanna and Andover. Based on projections from NJ Transit, the restart of construction, including extensive work on Roseville Tunnel, was to occur in mid- to late-2016, with the re-opening of service to Andover projected to occur in 2020. The proposed rehabilitation west of Andover, which has not yet been funded, would provide commuter rail service between Hoboken Terminal and New York&#x27;s Penn Station, and would serve the growing exurban communities in Monroe County, Pennsylvania, the Pocono Mountains, northern Warren County, and southern Sussex County in New Jersey. In October 2015, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) requested that a preliminary engineering study be performed in order to update the cost figures on the previous study. Funding for this study is currently being sought.

As of 2023, the projected completion date for Andover service is 2027, with work at Roseville Tunnel and Andover, NJ ongoing. There is a possibility of Amtrak extending service from New York City to Scranton, PA via the Cut-Off, but no official commitment for that service has been made to date.

==== Glassboro–Camden Line ====

The Glassboro–Camden Line is an diesel multiple unit (DMU) light rail system planned for southwestern part of New Jersey in the United States. At its northern end in Camden, it will connect with the River Line, with which its infrastructure and vehicles will be compatible. At the northern terminus, the Walter Rand Transportation Center, paid transfers will be possible to the PATCO Speedline. The project&#x27;s goal is to improve mobility and connect towns in Gloucester and Camden counties. The project was originally expected to be completed by 2019, but faced construction delays due to local pushback, lack of funding, and later the COVID-19 pandemic. An environmental assessment was published in February 2021, and it is now in the design and engineering phase. The project is projected to be operational by 2028.

==== Bus rapid transit ====

Bus rapid transit in New Jersey includes limited stop bus lines, exclusive bus lanes (XBL) and bus bypass shoulders (BBS). &quot;Next Generation Bus&quot; is the term used by NJT to refer to the development of numerous bus rapid transit (BRT) systems across the state which are being studied by the agency, NJDOT, the metropolitan planning organizations of New Jersey (MPO), and contract bus carriers. In 2011, NJT announced that it would equip its entire bus fleet with real-time location, creating the basis for &quot;next bus&quot; scheduling information at bus shelters and web-enabled devices and considered an important feature of BRT.

==== Recovery and Resilience Projects ====
As of 2018, there are several projects in progress. A project to replace the auxiliary power cables, traction power, and signal and communication devices along the HBLR that were affected by Hurricane Sandy was in the works. Repairs to Hoboken Terminal are said to be complete by 2020. Numerous power line, power system, and flood protection systems were in progress or completed at numerous terminals and stations. The 110-year old Raritan Bay Drawbridge is said to be replaced by a new, higher lift bridge.

=== Proposed projects ===
==== West Trenton ====

The West Trenton Line is a proposed service connecting West Trenton Station with Newark Penn Station, connecting with the Raritan Valley Line at Bridgewater. As of 2004, NJT&#x27;s estimate of the cost was $197 million. To date, no funding has been secured. Service ran on the line prior to 1983.

==== West Shore Commuter Rail Line ====
The West Shore Route is a proposal to reactivate passenger service on the New Jersey-New York section of the West Shore Railroad from Hoboken, NJ to West Nyack, NY. The project has been included in the NJ Transit&#x27;s portion of the federally-designated Metropolitan Planning Organization, the North Jersey Transportation Planning Authority&#x27;s Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) for the fiscal years of 2016–2019. The route holds perhaps the greatest promise in all of New Jersey since it travels through the heart of NJ Transit Bus Operations&#x27; Midtown &quot;commuter shed&quot;, with four bus routes (165, 167, 168 &amp; 177) running well beyond capacity. Issues regarding the restart of commuter rail service include:
* CSX owns the trackage and uses them heavily to link the NYC area to their national network at Selkirk Yard in upstate New York.
* CSX offers to allow NJ Transit use of the ROW if the agency constructed sound barriers along the entire length of track for commuter operations out of its own pocket.
* A city terminal is not connected to this line, since the Weehawken &amp; Pavonia Terminals were demolished decades ago. A loop connecting this line with the North River Tunnels into New York Penn Station where the West Shore Tracks pass under the Northeast Corridor just south of NJ Route 3 and Tonnelle Ave would directly connect this line into New York Penn Station. This configuration would provide a 25-minute travel time to New York Penn Station, but would bypass Secaucus Junction, leaving the West Shore with no transfer connection to the rest of New Jersey other than a possible transfer station on Tonnelle Ave with the Hudson Bergen Light Rail.

With these considerable technical issues, as well as no available space in New York Penn Station for West Shore Line trains, this proposal was put on hold until capacity into New York Penn Station will increase in the future.

The leadership of the municipalities along the route have been organizing for decades to get service running again and have been rezoning the areas around the former train stations ever since being told by NJ Transit that the number of projected riders is too low to justify investment.

==== Passaic–Bergen–Hudson Transit Project ====

The Passaic–Bergen–Hudson Transit Project would reintroduce passenger service on the New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway right-of-way in Passaic, Bergen and Hudson counties between Hawthorne and Hackensack, as well as extending service to connect to the Hudson–Bergen Light Rail in North Bergen. The project is currently in its initial study phase.

==== Monmouth-Ocean-Middlesex (MOM) ====

The Monmouth-Ocean-Middlesex (MOM) line is a proposed south and central New Jersey commuter rail route to New Brunswick, Newark and New York&#x27;s Penn Station. This would restore service previously provided by the Central Railroad of New Jersey with similar station sequences. Prior to the 1941 cancellation, the CNJ operated &quot;Blue Comet&quot; trains (Jersey City-Atlantic City) and some local trains on this route.

The line was originally proposed by the Ocean County Board of Chosen Freeholders in March 1980. It would run on a 40.1-mile rail corridor and would provide diesel commuter rail service from Monmouth Junction (South Brunswick), where the Jamesburg Branch partially joins the Northeast Corridor (NEC), south to Lakehurst in the interior of northern Ocean County. As of 2006, the line was opposed by Jamesburg and Monroe Township.

From Monmouth Junction the line would continue southeast to Jamesburg, Monroe, Englishtown, Manalapan, Freehold Borough, Freehold Township, Howell and Farmingdale. A new rail connection would be required in Farmingdale. It would proceed southward from Farmingdale to Lakehurst, passing through Howell, Lakewood, Jackson, Toms River, Townships, and Lakehurst/Manchester. Trains would also operate on the NEC between Monmouth Junction and Newark. Passengers for New York would transfer at Newark. Eight new stations and a train storage yard would be constructed.

In mid-February 2008, New Jersey Governor Jon Corzine withdrew the Monmouth Junction alignment from the MOM Plan. Corzine opted to endorse the two remaining alternate alignments (via Red Bank or Matawan-Freehold, the latter which is currently part of the Henry Hudson Rail Trail). NJT is still planning to study all the routes as to not delay action further on the EIS, and says all three routes are still up for evaluation, although it will take the Governor&#x27;s comments into consideration.

In late May 2009, representatives of the three counties agreed to back one potential route from Ocean County to Red Bank, instead of to Monmouth Junction, ending years of stalemate. Under that compromise, the line&#x27;s southern terminus would be in Lakehurst, and it would run through Lakewood along existing freight tracks to join the North Jersey Coast Line in Red Bank. It also includes the possibility of a spur between Freehold and Farmingdale.

In August 2010, NJT received $534,375 in Federal Funds to investigate the possibilities of a MOM line. Since that time there has been no further advancement of the project. The inertia is partially attributed to the cancellation of the Access to the Region&#x27;s Core project.

==== Lehigh Valley ====
In November 2008, the Lehigh Valley Economic Development Corporation (LVEDC), along with both Lehigh and Northampton counties, commissioned a study to explore extending the Raritan Valley Line to the Lehigh Valley region of eastern Pennsylvania, which would potentially include stops in Allentown, Bethlehem and Easton. This would resume passenger service previously provided jointly by the Lehigh Valley Railroad and the Central Railroad of New Jersey. These cities were last served in 1967.

=== Canceled projects ===
==== Access to the Region&#x27;s Core ====

NJT intended to construct a new two-track Hudson River tunnel adjacent to the two single-track Northeast Corridor tunnels built in the early 20th century by the Pennsylvania Railroad. NJT referred to the project as Access to the Region&#x27;s Core, which would have used dual-power locomotives and a new rail junction at Secaucus, allowing for a one-train ride between the Port Jervis, Main, Bergen County, Pascack Valley, and Raritan Valley lines and New York Penn Station. The Lehigh and the West Trenton extension plans would require added capacity and the ARC project would provide that capacity.

The project broke ground in June 2009. Both the Federal Transit Administration and the Port Authority made public commitments of $3 billion to the project. However, the project was suspended on October 7, 2010, due to concerns that the State of New Jersey would be solely responsible for projected $5 billion in overruns. On October 27, 2010, Governor Chris Christie made a final decision to cancel the project. Amtrak later unveiled the Gateway Project, which addresses some of the issues ARC was meant to resolve.

==== Newark–Elizabeth Rail Link ====

Planned to connect Downtown Newark and Elizabeth via Newark Liberty International Airport, NJT is no longer pursuing the Newark–Elizabeth Rail Link. The airport has a monorail link to NJT&#x27;s Northeast Corridor Line and Amtrak&#x27;s Northeast Corridor, both of which run to both Newark and Elizabeth.

== Incidents ==
* In December 1985, a train crashed into a concrete bumper in Hoboken Terminal, injuring 54 people. The cause was a lubricant that was applied into the tracks to test the train wheels.
* At around 8:40 a.m. on February 9, 1996, two trains collided nearly head-on near Secaucus. Both trains&#x27; engineers and a passenger were killed. The collision was caused when the eastbound train ran a red signal.
* On July 14, 2003, a Northeast Corridor train derailed just east of the Portal Bridge in Secaucus during the morning rush hour disrupting service on the Northeast Corridor for nearly 12 hours. Amtrak service was terminated at Newark during this time. All of NJ Transit&#x27;s Northeast Corridor, North Jersey Coast and Morris and Essex trains were diverted to Hoboken Terminal. The cause of the derailment was a lost wheel on one of the Arrow III cars causing NJ Transit to temporarily take all 230 Arrow III cars out of service for inspection. They were all deemed safe and returned to service days later.
*On February 21, 2007, a Bergen County Line train suffered a minor derailment after passing over an improperly repaired switch at Ridgewood Junction.
* On the morning of September 29, 2016, a Pascack Valley Line train failed to slow down as it approached Hoboken Terminal and crashed into the passenger concourse. One person died, with around 100 people being injured.
* On August 19, 2016, two New Jersey Transit buses collided in Newark on Broad St &amp; Raymond Blvd during the morning commute. Bus 5612, operating on route no. 59 with no passengers, ran a red light, colliding with bus 5784, running was on route 13, which was crossing the road safely. Two people died and 18 were injured in the crash. The driver of 5612 died at the scene. A passenger onboard bus 5784 was also pronounced dead at the scene.
* On the morning of December 14, 2023, a Texas Longhorn bull wandered onto the train tracks at Newark Penn Station. Onlookers notified officials, leading to paused service and train delays of up to 45 minutes. Newark Police Emergency Services and the Port Authority Police Department contained the animal, later named Ricardo after one of the police officers who helped corral him to safety. On December 19, 2023, NJ Transit released an official Ricardo the Bull 6-inch plushie to commemorate the incident. The plushie was available for pre-order on the NJ Transit Shoppe for $20 and sold out shortly after release. A portion of the proceeds for the plushie would go Skylands Animal Sanctuary &amp; Rescue in [[Sussex County, New Jersey|Sussex County], where Ricardo was transported after the incident.
* On October 14, 2024, a light rail train collided with a tree on the River Line. One person was killed and 23 people were injured.

<text>The Constitution of the German Reich (), usually known as the Weimar Constitution (), was the constitution that governed Germany during the Weimar Republic era. The constitution created a federal semi-presidential republic with a parliament whose lower house, the Reichstag, was elected by universal suffrage using proportional representation. The appointed upper house, the Reichsrat, represented the interests of the federal states. The president of Germany had supreme command over the military, extensive emergency powers, and appointed and removed the chancellor, who was responsible to the Reichstag. The constitution included a significant number of civic rights such as freedom of speech and &quot;habeas corpus&quot;. It guaranteed freedom of religion and did not permit the establishment of a state church.

The constitution contained a number of weaknesses which, under the difficult conditions of the interwar period, failed to prevent Adolf Hitler from setting up a Nazi dictatorship using the constitution as a cover of legitimacy. Although it was &quot;de facto&quot; set aside by the Enabling Act of 1933, the constitution remained legal-technically in effect throughout the Nazi era from 1933 to 1945 and also during the Allied occupation of Germany from 1945 to 1949. It was then replaced by the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany until 1990, then reunited Germany) and the Constitution of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany).

The constitution&#x27;s title was the same as the Constitution of the German Empire that preceded it. The German state&#x27;s official name was German Reich () until 1949.

== Origin ==

After the end of World War I, the government of Imperial Germany collapsed during the early days of the German revolution of 1918–1919. In the following months, the far left parties that fought to establish a soviet republic were defeated by those of the moderate left that wanted a parliamentary republic. The victorious parties, led by Friedrich Ebert of the Social Democrats (SPD), scheduled an election on 19 January 1919 – in which women for the first time had equal voting rights with men – for a national assembly that was to act as Germany&#x27;s interim parliament and draft a new constitution. Because conditions in Berlin were still unsettled, the delegates met at Weimar. Ebert wanted the victorious Allies to be reminded of Weimar Classicism, which included the writers Goethe and Schiller, while they were deliberating the terms of the Versailles Treaty.

The initial draft of the constitution was written by the lawyer and liberal politician Hugo Preuss, who headed the Ministry of the Interior. He based his draft in large part on the Frankfurt Constitution of 1849 which was written after the German revolutions of 1848–1849 and intended for a unified Germany that did not come to pass at the time. He was influenced as well by Robert Redslob&#x27;s theory of parliamentarianism, which called for a balance between the executive and legislative branches under either a monarch or the people as sovereign.

During July 1919, the National Assembly moved quickly through the draft constitution with most debates concluded within a single session and without public discussion of the issues. On 31 July the assembly adopted the new constitution by a vote of 262 to 75 with 1 abstention. Friedrich Ebert, the first president of Germany, signed the Weimar Constitution on 11 August 1919, and it became effective on the 14th. A federal election was held on 6 June 1920 for the new Reichstag.

== Provisions and organization ==

The was divided into two main parts or chapters. They in turn were divided into seven and five sections respectively. In all, there were 181 articles in the constitution.

Some of the more noteworthy provisions are described below, including those provisions which proved significant in the demise of the Weimar Republic and the rise of Nazi Germany.

The preamble to the Constitution reads:

The German people united in every respect and inspired by the determination to restore and confirm the Reich in liberty and justice, to serve peace at home and peace abroad, and to further social progress, has given itself this constitution.

=== Chapter I: Organization and functions of the Reich ===
The first part of the constitution specified the organization of the various parts of the federal government.

==== Section 1: The Reich and the states ====
Section 1 consisted of Articles 1 to 19 and established the German Reich as a republic whose power derived from the people. The Reich was defined as the region encompassed by the German states; other regions could be incorporated into the Reich based on popular self-determination and corresponding Reich legislation. (Germany received the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, which reduced its land area and population by 13% and 12% respectively, on 7 May 1919, while the constitution was being debated in the National Assembly.)

Section 1 also established that generally recognized principles of international law were binding on Germany and gave the Reich government exclusive jurisdiction of:
* foreign relations
* colonies
* citizenship, freedom of movement, immigration, emigration and extradition
* national defence
* currency
* customs
* mail, telegraph and telephone services

Articles 7 through 11 listed many more areas in which the Reich was allowed to either legislate or prescribe fundamental principles, notably &quot;taxation and other revenues in so far as they are claimed in whole or in part for its purposes&quot;.

With the exceptions of the subjects for which the Reich government had exclusive jurisdiction, the states could pass legislation for their respective territories as they saw fit. Reich law superseded or nullified state law in the event of a conflict. Adjudication of conflicts between a state and the Reich government fell under the jurisdiction of the Supreme Judicial Court.

States were required to have a republican constitution and its authorities to enforce Reich law. Each state parliament (&quot;Landtag&quot;) was to be elected by equal, secret, direct and universal (both men and women) ballot according to the principles of proportional representation. Each state government (the &quot;state ministry&quot;) could serve only so long as it had the confidence of the respective state parliament.

==== Section 2: The Reichstag and the Reich government ====
Articles 20 to 40 described the national parliament, the Reichstag, which was seated in the capital, Berlin. The Reichstag was composed of representatives elected by the German people by an equal and secret ballot open to all Germans over 20 years of age. Proportional representation principles governed Reichstag elections.

Members of the Reichstag represented the entire nation and were bound only to their own conscience. Members served for four years. The Reichstag could be dissolved by the Reich president, and new elections had to be held not more than 60 days after the date of dissolution.

Members of the Reichstag and of the state parliaments were immune from arrest or investigation of a criminal offense except with the approval of the legislative body to which the person belonged. The same approval was required for any other restriction on personal freedom which might harm the member&#x27;s ability to fulfil his duties.

==== Section 3: The president of the Reich and the national ministry ====

Articles 41 to 59 describe the duties of the president, including the qualifications for the office. They also explain his relationship to the national ministry (cabinet) and the chancellor.

The president served a term of seven years and could be re-elected once. He could be removed from office by referendum following a vote of two-thirds of the Reichstag. Rejection of the measure by the voters would act as a re-election of the president and cause the Reichstag to be dissolved. If a state failed to fulfil its obligations under the constitution or Reich law, the president could use armed force to compel the state to do so under a &quot;Reichsexekution&quot;. Article 48 gave the president the power to take measures – including the use of armed force and/or the suspension of civil rights – to restore law and order in the event of a serious threat to public safety or security. Since Article 50 required all of the president&#x27;s decrees to be counter-signed by the chancellor or &quot;competent national minister&quot;, use of Article 48 required agreement between president and chancellor. The president was also required to inform the Reichstag of the use of such measures, and the Reichstag could nullify the decree. In 1933 President Paul von Hindenburg and Chancellor Adolf Hitler, using Article 48 as the basis for the Reichstag Fire Decree, legally swept away most of the key the civil liberties granted in the Weimar Constitution and thereby facilitated the establishment of a dictatorship.

The president had supreme command over the military and appointed and removed the chancellor and, on the chancellor&#x27;s recommendation, the members of the cabinet. The chancellor determined the political guidelines of his government and was responsible to the Reichstag. The chancellor and ministers were compelled to resign in the event the Reichstag passed a vote of no confidence. It was not, however, a constructive vote of no confidence, which requires that there be a positive majority for a prospective successor before confidence can be withdrawn. Under the Weimar Constitution, the vote of no confidence often resulted in difficulty forming new coalitions and a degree of parliamentary instability that in the end was fatal to the Republic.

The government (cabinet) formulated decisions by majority vote; in the case of a tie, the president&#x27;s vote was decisive. The Reichstag could accuse the president, chancellor, or any minister of willful violation of the constitution or Reich law, with the case to be tried in the Supreme Judicial Court.

==== Section 4: The Reichsrat ====

Section 4 consisted of Articles 60 to 67 and established the Reichsrat (State Council). The Reichsrat was the means by which the states participated in legislation at the national level. The number of members was based on the states&#x27; populations, with the restriction that no state could have more than two-fifths of the total – a provision that limited only Prussia&#x27;s influence since it had three-fifths of Germany&#x27;s population. Members of the Reichsrat were required to be members the state ministries, with the exception again of Prussia, half of whose members had to be appointed from among the Prussian provincial administrative authorities. Although not specified in the constitution, members – except for the Prussians who were provincial representatives – were considered to be bound by the instructions of their respective state governments. Government ministers were required to inform the Reichsrat of proposed legislation or administrative regulations to permit the Reichsrat to voice objections.

Article 61 stated that &quot;German Austria, after union with the German Reich, shall be represented in the Reichsrat by votes corresponding in number to its population&quot;. The Republic of German-Austria had been established after the dissolution of Austria-Hungary from the predominantly German-speaking regions of the former empire. Hugo Preuss publicly criticised the Triple Entente&#x27;s decision in the Treaty of Versailles to prohibit the unification of &quot;Greater Germany&quot;, saying that it was a contradiction of the Wilsonian principle of the self-determination of peoples.

==== Section 5: National legislation ====
Articles 68 to 77 specified how legislation was to be passed into law. Laws could be proposed by a member of the Reichstag or by the Reich government and were passed on the majority vote of the Reichstag. Proposed legislation had to be presented to the Reichsrat, and the latter body&#x27;s objections were required to be presented to the Reichstag.

The Reich president had the power to decree that a proposed law be presented to the voters as a referendum before taking effect.

The Reichsrat was entitled to object to laws passed by the Reichstag. If the objection could not be resolved, the Reich president at his discretion could call for a referendum or let the proposed law die. If the Reichstag voted to overrule the Reichsrat&#x27;s objection by a two-thirds majority, the Reich president was obligated to either proclaim the law into force or to call for a referendum.

Constitutional amendments were proposed as ordinary legislation, but for such an amendment to take effect, it was required that two-thirds or more of the Reichstag members be present and that at least two-thirds of the members present vote in favor of the legislation.

The Reich government had the authority to establish administrative regulations unless Reich law specified otherwise.

==== Section 6: National administration ====

Articles 78 to 101 described the methods by which the Reich government administered the constitution and laws, particularly in the areas where the Reich government had exclusive jurisdiction – foreign relations, colonial affairs, defence, taxation and customs, merchant shipping and waterways, railroads and so forth.

==== Section 7: Administration of justice ====
Articles 102 to 108 established the justice system of the Weimar Republic. The principal provision mandated judicial independence – judges were responsible only to the law. Extraordinary courts were prohibited and military courts allowed only during wartime and aboard warships.

The section required that laws be promulgated to establish a Supreme Judicial Court and administrative courts to adjudicate disputes between citizens and administrative offices of the state. The law to set up the Supreme Judicial Court () was passed in July 1921. 

=== Chapter II: Fundamental rights and duties of Germans ===
The second part of the Weimar Constitution laid out the basic rights and obligations of Germans. The German Civil Code of 1900, which included sections on personal rights and domestic relations, remained in effect.

The constitution guaranteed individual rights such as freedom of speech and assembly to each citizen. They were based on the provisions of the earlier constitution of 1848.

==== Section 1: The individual ====
Articles 109 to 118 set forth the individual rights of Germans, the principal tenet being that every German was equal before the law. Men and women had &quot;in principle&quot; the same civil rights and duties. Privileges based on birth or rank – that is, the German nobility – were abolished. Official recognition of the titles of nobility ceased, except as a part of a person&#x27;s name, and creation of noble titles was discontinued.

A citizen of any of the German states was likewise a citizen of Germany. Germans had the right of mobility and residence, and the right to acquire property and pursue a trade. They had the right to emigrate and to government protection against foreign authorities.

The &quot;traditional development&quot; () of foreign language communities in Germany was protected, including the right to use their native language in education, administration, and the judicial system.

Other specific articles stated that:
* The rights of the individual are inviolable. Individual liberties may be limited or deprived only on the basis of law. Persons have the right to be notified within a day of their arrest or detention as to the authority and reasons for their detention and be given the opportunity to object (Article 114). This is equivalent to the principle of &quot;habeas corpus&quot; in the common law of England and elsewhere.
* A German&#x27;s home is a sanctuary and is inviolable (Article 115).
* Privacy of mail, telegraph and telephone are inviolable (Article 117).
* Germans are entitled to free expression of opinion in word, writing, print, image, etc. This right cannot be obstructed due to employment, nor can exercise of the right create a disadvantage. Censorship is prohibited, except by law in the case of cinematography and obscene literature (Article 118).

==== Section 2: Community life ====

Articles 119 to 134 guided Germans&#x27; interaction with the community and established, among other provisions, that:
* Marriage, based on the equality of the sexes, was put under the special protection of the state. Illegitimate children were granted equal rights.
* Germans had the right to assemble peacefully and unarmed without prior permission (Article 123).
* Germans were entitled to form clubs or societies, which were permitted to acquire legal status. The status could not be denied because of the organization&#x27;s political, socio-political or religious goals (Article 124).
* Free and secret elections were guaranteed (Article 125).
* All citizens were eligible for public office, without discrimination, based on their abilities. Gender discrimination toward female civil servants was abolished (Article 128).
* Civil servants served the whole nation, not a specific party. They enjoyed freedom of political opinion (Article 130).
* Citizens could be required to provide services to the state and community, including compulsory military service under regulations set by law.

==== Section 3: Religion and religious communities ====
The religious rights of Germans were enumerated in Articles 135 to 141. Residents of Germany were granted freedom of belief and conscience. Free practice of religion was guaranteed and protected by the state. No state church was established.

The exercise of civil and civic rights and admission to state office were independent of one&#x27;s religious beliefs. Public declaration of religious beliefs was not required, and no one was forced to join in a religious act or swear a religious oath.

Five articles from this section of the Constitution (Nos. 136–139 and 141) were incorporated into the Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany (passed in 1949) and remain constitutional law in Germany today.

==== Section 4: Education and schools ====
Articles 142 to 150 guided the operation of educational institutions within the Reich. Public education was provided by state institutions and regulated by the government, with cooperation between federal, state and local authorities. Primary school was compulsory (eight years), with advanced schooling available to age 18 free of charge.

The constitution also provided for private schooling, which was likewise regulated by the government. In private schools operated by religious communities, religious instruction could take place in accordance with the religious community&#x27;s principles.

==== Section 5: The economy ====
Constitutional provisions about economic affairs were given in Articles 151 to 165. One of the fundamental principles was that economic life should conform to the principles of justice, with the goal of achieving a dignified life for all and securing the economic freedom of the individual.

The right to property was guaranteed by Article 153. Expropriation of property could be made only on the basis of law and for the public welfare, with appropriate compensation.

The Reich protected labor, intellectual creation, and the rights of authors, inventors, and artists. The right to form unions and to improve working conditions was guaranteed to every individual and to all occupations, and protection of the self-employed was established. Workers and employees were given the right to participate, on an equal footing with employers, in the regulation of wages and working conditions as well as in economic development.

The Reich reserved the right to &quot;transfer to public ownership private economic enterprises suitable for socialization&quot;. It undertook to provide comprehensive insurance for health, maternity and old age. Workers were to be given legal representation on factory workers&#x27; councils.

=== Transition and final clauses ===
The final 16 articles (Articles 166 to 181) of the Weimar Constitution provided for the orderly transition to the new constitution and stipulated in some cases when the various provisions of the new constitution were to take effect. In cases where legislation had yet to be passed (such as the laws governing the new Supreme Judicial Court), the articles stipulated how the constitutional authority would be exercised in the interim by existing institutions. The section also stipulated that new bodies established by the constitution take the place of obsolete bodies (such as the National Assembly) where those bodies were referred to by name in old laws or decrees.

It was mandated that public servants and members of the armed forces take an oath on the constitution.

The Constitution of the German Empire dated 15 April 1871 was suspended, but other Reich laws and decrees that did not contradict the new constitution remained in force. Other official decrees based on previously valid law remained valid until superseded by law or decree.

The National Assembly was regarded as the Reichstag until the first Reichstag was elected and convened, and the Reich president elected by the National Assembly (Friedrich Ebert) was to serve until 30 June 1925.

== Weaknesses ==
In his book &quot;The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich&quot;, historian William L. Shirer described the Weimar Constitution as &quot;on paper, the most liberal and democratic document of its kind the twentieth century had ever seen ... full of ingenious and admirable devices which seemed to guarantee the working of an almost flawless democracy.&quot; Yet the Weimar Constitution had serious problems, one of the most serious of which was its legitimacy in the eyes of the German people. Historian Hans-Ulrich Wehler argued that the manner in which Ebert received the &quot;mantle of legitimacy&quot; (the chancellorship) from Prince Max of Baden, the last chancellor of the Empire, resembled a coup and that the Council of the People&#x27;s Deputies which Ebert led until the convening of the National Assembly functioned &quot;by virtue of revolutionary law&quot;. In addition, there was no public debate on the decisions the National Assembly took on issues with serious long-term consequences, with the result that &quot;the sovereign people once again proved to be a useful fiction for legitimacy&quot;.
In the text itself, the extent of presidential powers proved to be deeply problematic. The governmental structure was a mix of presidential and parliamentary systems, with a strong president as a &quot;replacement monarch&quot; who was intended to be above political parties and a counterweight to the Reichstag and the potential for the &quot;parliamentary absolutism&quot; that Preuss feared. The constitution allowed the president to dismiss the chancellor even if he retained the confidence of the Reichstag. Similarly, the president could appoint a chancellor who did not have the Reichstag&#x27;s support. Article 48, the so-called emergency decree provision, gave the president broad powers to suspend civil liberties, with the checks and balances in it proving in practice to be insufficient. Article 48 also allowed the president to depose local governments, a power which was used four times and targeted only left-wing ministers (see &quot;Reichsexekution&quot;). Although the original intent was that Article 48 would be used sparingly to restore constitutional order in the event of a national emergency, it was invoked 205 times before Adolf Hitler became chancellor. It was thus no anomaly that he seized the opportunity to use its powers to begin solidifying his dictatorship just a month after his appointment (see following section).

The use of a proportional electoral system without thresholds to win representation has also been argued to be a weakness. The system, intended to avoid the wasting of votes, allowed the rise of a multitude of parties which made it difficult for any of them to establish and maintain a workable parliamentary majority. This factionalism was one contributing factor in the frequent changes in government. In the July 1932 Reichstag election, for example, there were 14 parties that gained enough votes to win at least one seat (out of a total of 62 parties that received votes). It was possible to win a seat in the chamber with as little as 0.1 percent of the vote. In the July 1932 election, for instance, the People&#x27;s Justice Party, with just 40,800 votes out of over 37 million cast, picked up a seat. The rise of the Nazis (NSDAP) to form the largest party in the 1932 election, however, can be attributed only to the sentiment of voters. Critics of electoral thresholds dispute the argument that the Nazis&#x27; token presence in the Reichstags of the 1920s significantly aided their rise to power and that the existence of thresholds in the Weimar Constitution would not in fact have hindered Hitler&#x27;s ambitions – indeed, once the Nazis had passed the thresholds, their existence would have aided the Nazis by allowing them to marginalize smaller parties even more quickly. 

In presidential elections, the Weimar Constitution stated only that the president would be &quot;elected by the entire German people&quot;, with detailed specifications to come from a national law. The &quot;Law on the Election of the Reich President of 4 May 1920&quot; set up a two-round system in which the second round, if needed because no candidate won a majority of votes in the first, was not limited to the top two vote-getters but was won by whoever had the most votes out of all candidates choosing to run. The second round of the 1925 German presidential election was thus not a contest between the DVP&#x27;s Karl Jarres (1st place) and the SPD&#x27;s Otto Braun (2nd place), who both belonged to parties which accepted the political system of the Weimar Republic, but was a three-person race between the Centre Party&#x27;s Wilhelm Marx (3rd place in the first round; candidate of the Weimar Coalition), the Communist leader Ernst Thälmann (4th place in the first round), and Paul von Hindenburg, the commander of the Imperial German Army during World War I and candidate of the monarchist far-right, who won the election with 48% of the vote despite not having stood in the first round.

In the early days of the German revolution, the moderate leadership of the Council of the People&#x27;s Deputies decided that for the sake of stability it was better to keep the large bureaucratic machinery of the Empire than to attempt to replace thousands of experienced officials, the majority of whom remained loyal to the monarchy. When the Weimar Constitution was being written, the powerful German Civil Service Federation () was able to exert pressure to add special protections for government officials in Articles 128 to 131, even though Preuss had had no intention of including such language. In addition to liberal provisions that granted freedom of political opinion, the articles guaranteed professional government officials life appointments and old age and survivors&#x27; benefits. This special inclusion in the constitution proved to be a considerable problem for the Republic in that it made it difficult for bureaucratic reforms to remove the many opponents of democracy in high-ranking positions, especially the judiciary.

Even without these problems, the Weimar Constitution was established and in effect under very difficult social, political, and economic conditions. In his book &quot;The Coming of the Third Reich&quot;, historian Richard J. Evans argues thatall in all, Weimar&#x27;s constitution was no worse than the constitutions of most other countries in the 1920s, and a good deal more democratic than many. Its more problematical provisions might not have mattered so much had the circumstances been different. But the fatal lack of legitimacy from which the Republic suffered magnified the constitution&#x27;s faults many times over.

== Hitler&#x27;s subversion of the Weimar Constitution ==
Less than a month after Adolf Hitler&#x27;s appointment as chancellor in 1933, the Reichstag Fire Decree invoked Article 48 of the Weimar Constitution, suspending several constitutional protections on civil rights. The articles affected were 114 (habeas corpus), 115 (inviolability of residence), 117 (correspondence privacy), 118 (freedom of expression/censorship), 123 (assembly), 124 (associations) and 153 (expropriation).

The subsequent Enabling Act, passed by the Reichstag on 23 March 1933, stated that, in addition to the traditional method of the Reichstag passing legislation, the Reich government (the chancellor and cabinet) could also pass legislation. It further stated that the powers of the Reichstag, Reichsrat and Reich president were not affected. The normal legislative procedures outlined in Articles 68 to 77 of the constitution did not apply to legislation promulgated by the Reich government.

The Enabling Act, which passed by a vote of 441 to 94, formally met the requirements for a constitutional amendment (two-thirds of the Reichstag&#x27;s members were present, and two-thirds of the members present voted in favor of the measure) – but that was only after the 81 members of the Communist Party had been forcibly excluded. The Act did not explicitly amend the Weimar Constitution, but it did state that the procedure required for constitutional reform had been met. The constitution of 1919 was never formally repealed, but the Enabling Act meant that all its other provisions were a dead letter.

Two of the penultimate acts Hitler took to consolidate his power in 1934 violated the Enabling Act. Article 2 of the Act stated that &quot;laws enacted by the government of the Reich may deviate from the constitution as long as they do not affect the institutions of the Reichstag and the Reichsrat. The rights of the President remain unaffected&quot;. On 14 February 1934, the &quot;Law on the Abolition of the Reichsrat&quot; eliminated the Reichsrat completely, despite the explicit protection of its existence. When Hindenburg died on 2 August, Hitler appropriated presidential powers for himself in accordance with a law passed the previous day.

== Aftermath and legacy ==
After the passage of the Enabling Act, the Weimar Constitution was largely forgotten. Hitler nonetheless used it to give his dictatorship the appearance of legality. In the final three Reichstag elections held during his rule (November 1933, March 1936 and April 1938), voters were presented with a single list of Nazis and &quot;guest candidates&quot;. Secret voting technically remained possible, but the Nazis made use of aggressive extra-legal measures at the polling stations to intimidate the electors from attempting to vote in secret. Thousands of Hitler&#x27;s decrees were based explicitly on the Reichstag Fire Decree, and hence on Article 48.

In Hitler&#x27;s 1945 political testament (written shortly before his suicide), he appointed Admiral Karl Dönitz to succeed him. He named Dönitz president, not &quot;Führer&quot;, thereby re-establishing a constitutional office which had lain dormant since Hindenburg&#x27;s death ten years earlier. Despite the appearance of legality, Hitler failed to transfer power to Dönitz in a fully legal manner, since under the Weimar Constitution, the office of President of the Reich required confirmation of such a nomination in a general election. On 30 April 1945, Dönitz formed what became known as the Flensburg government, which controlled only a tiny area of Germany near the Danish border, including the town of Flensburg. It was dissolved by the Allies on 23 May. On 5 June, the Allied Berlin Declaration proclaimed the assumption of supreme authority by the four victorious powers acting as occupying forces in their respective zones and jointly in the Allied Control Council for Germany as a whole.

The Enabling Act was formally repealed by Article 1a of the Allied Control Council in Control Council Law No. 1 on 20 September 1945, which at least theoretically reestablished the Weimar Constitution. Its legal validity during the Allied occupation of Germany from 1945 to 1949 was, however, overridden by the Allies&#x27; power over Germany.

The 1949 Constitution of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) contained many passages that were directly copied from the 1919 constitution. It was intended to be the constitution of a united Germany and was therefore a compromise between liberal-democratic and Marxist–Leninist ideologies. It was replaced by a new, explicitly Communist constitution in 1968, which remained in force until the reunification of Germany in 1990.

The Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany, enacted in 1949, said &quot;provisions of Articles 136, 137, 138, 139 and 141 of the German Constitution of 11 August 1919 shall be an integral part of this Basic Law&quot;. These articles of the Weimar Constitution (which dealt with the state&#x27;s relationship to the different Christian denominations) remain part of the German Basic Law.

Under the judicial system based on the Basic Law, the Weimar Constitution initially retained the force of law (with the exception of the church articles on a non-constitutional level) where the Basic Law contained nothing to the contrary. The norms were, however, largely redundant or dealing with matters reserved to the states and as such officially set out of force within two decades. Aside from the church articles, the rule that titles of nobility were to be considered part of the name and must no longer be bestowed (Art. 109 III) is the only one left in force.

The first official constitution of the Republic of Korea (commonly referred to as South Korea) was based on the Weimar Constitution. It also provided much of the wording for the Constitution of Latvia, which is seen as a synthesis between the Weimar Constitution and Westminster system used in the United Kingdom. The Constitution of India drew its language on the suspension of fundamental rights during an emergency from the Weimar Constitution.

== Notes ==
† Protections provided by Articles 114, 115, 117, 118, 123, 124, and 153 could be suspended or restricted by the president, with the concurrence of the chancellor, through invocation of the authority granted under Article 48 of the Weimar Constitution.

<text>Puddle Lane (or Tales from Puddle Lane) is a 1980s English pre-school children&#x27;s television programme written by Rick Vanes with animated stories written by Sheila K. McCullagh, author of &quot;Tim and the Hidden People&quot;. A long series of early readers based on the stories was produced by Ladybird Books, also under the title Puddle Lane.

==TV programme==
The programme was made by Yorkshire Television in Leeds for ITV and ran on from 1985 (as a replacement for the then-recently discontinued series &quot;Mooncat &amp; Co.&quot;) until 1989. The main characters were the Magician (played by Neil Innes, who also composed music for the programme), and a Spell Dragon named Toby (voiced by Richard Robinson); the Magician told Toby stories by moving his finger around in a puddle (when using the interior set) and a bird bath (when using the exterior set) and producing images. He also had a cauldron inside and water barrel outside, both of which could talk. The stories he told were presented as animations, narrated by Kate Lee (who also played a minor character, Aunt Flo). The Magician lived in a large house at the end of Puddle Lane, hence the name of the programme.

In an interview in 2014, Neil Innes recalled his involvement with &quot;Puddle Lane&quot;:

==Transmission guide==

*Series 1: 26 editions from 3 October 1985 – 1 May 1986
*Series 2: 26 editions from 16 October 1986 – 23 April 1987
*Series 3: 24 editions from 29 October 1987 – 21 April 1988
*Series 4: 26 editions from 6 October 1988 – 13 April 1989

==Books==

A series of 54 books (plus two standalone volumes) was produced for Puddle Lane, published by Ladybird Books. The texts, based on the animated stories, were written by Sheila McCullagh. Illustrations for the books were provided by several different artists (Tony Morris, Gavin Rowe and others). There were five sets of books (with a different cover colour for each set), the first set (Stage 1) being the easiest to read and the last set (Stage 5) being the hardest. Since they were intended for children who are learning to read, the books with lower reading stages would present the text in two versions: the left page contained the full version, to be read aloud by the parent, while the right page contained a simplified version for the child. The books are currently out of print.

==Miscellany==
Other Puddle Lane merchandise included audio tapes supplied for the books, jigsaw puzzles, dominoes, picture word cards, and several educational products: &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Activity Book&quot;, &quot;The Griffle&#x27;s Activity Book&quot; and &quot;Puddle Lane Fun Frieze&quot;.

<doc id="309794" wikidata="Q1095015" url="?curid=309794" title="Clan of Xymox">
<text>Clan of Xymox, also known as simply Xymox, are a Dutch rock band formed in 1981 best known as pioneers of dark wave music. Clan of Xymox featured a trio of singer-songwriters – Ronny Moorings, Anka Wolbert, and Pieter Nooten – and gained success in the 1980s, releasing their first two albums on 4AD, before releasing their third and fourth albums on Wing Records and scoring a hit single in the United States. The band is still active, continuing to tour and release records with Moorings as the sole remaining original member.

==History==
===4AD and the Peel Sessions (1983–1988)===

Clan of Xymox were formed in Nijmegen, Netherlands, in 1983 by Ronny Moorings (guitars, vocals) and Anka Wolbert (bass, vocals). Wolbert stated of the band&#x27;s formation:

Ronny and I met as students in Nijmegen and we connected over our taste in music. We started making music together and picked up some equipment to experiment with, like the Korg MS-10 and a rhythm machine...We started to perform live, just the two of us, changing instruments in between songs. While I had a bass guitar strapped around my neck and simultaneously hit the monophonic keyboard, Ronny played guitar and sang. We combined our sound with tape loops, a Casio, plus a few weird instruments.

About a year later, Moorings and Wolbert moved to Amsterdam, where they joined Pieter Nooten (Moorings&#x27; Nijmegen flat-mate)&lt;ref name=&quot;unruhr-1/5-xymox&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and Frank Weyzig, who added their own contributions. Assuming the name &quot;Xymox&quot; after the word &quot;zymotic&quot; (of or causing fermentation), in 1983 the group released a five-track EP titled &quot;Subsequent Pleasures&quot;, limited to 500 copies. 

The band was invited by Brendan Perry to support Dead Can Dance on a UK tour and were signed to the indie label 4AD, which released their eponymous debut album in 1985. The track &quot;7th Time&quot;, with Anka Wolbert on lead vocals, was picked up by John Peel, leading to the band recording two of the Peel Sessions at the BBC, in June and November 1985.

In 1986, they released their second and last album on 4AD, &quot;Medusa&quot;, before signing with PolyGram. Simultaneously, Pieter Nooten recorded and released his album &quot;Sleeps with the Fishes&quot; (4AD, 1987), in collaboration with Canadian session musician Michael Brook. In a 2010 interview with AlterNation Magazine, Moorings expressed disappointment at the divided interests of the band members at this stage, exclaiming Medusa&#x27;s follow-up album was &quot;made entirely independently, without the rest of the musicians, who were then on vacation.&quot;

===PolyGram and international success (1988–1991)===

Now abbreviated as Xymox, the band&#x27;s third album, &quot;Twist of Shadows&quot;, was released in 1989. This album, and its successor &quot;Phoenix&quot;, were released by Wing Records, a subsidiary of Polydor Records/PolyGram. In the United States, these two albums created a cult following for the band. The first two singles taken from the &quot;Twist of Shadows&quot; album, &quot;Blind Hearts&quot; and &quot;Obsession&quot;, proved college and club hits in the United States, with &quot;Obsession&quot; charting on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Alternative Songs chart and both tracks hitting the Billboard Club Play Chart.

It was the album&#x27;s third single, &quot;Imagination&quot; (with Anka Wolbert on lead vocals), that brought the band the most mainstream attention, charting at No. 85 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, generating Top 40 radio airplay and MTV rotation of the &quot;Imagination (Edit)&quot; single video. &quot;Twist of Shadows&quot; proved their most commercially successful album, selling more than 300,000 copies worldwide.

By this time the band had moved to England and released their fourth album, &quot;Phoenix&quot;, on PolyGram in 1991; after this album, Anka Wolbert and Pieter Nooten left the band due to disagreements about the band&#x27;s musical direction.

===Independent labels and move to Germany (1991–Present)===

Xymox worked with Japanese singer Atsushi Sakurai to create the song for the March 1992 compilation album &quot;Dance 2 Noise 002&quot;. Without Nooten and Wolbert, the group left PolyGram to release the UK acid house inspired LPs &quot;Metamorphosis&quot; (1992) and &quot;Headclouds&quot; (1993) independently. These albums marked a break from the dark wave sound of the 1980s and met with poor record sales in the United States, which had moved towards a markedly different grunge sound at the time. Ronny Moorings toured under the banner of Xymox until 1994 with an evolving cast of live musicians, including girlfriend and future band member Mojca Zugna. Frank Weyzig (the last of the original line-up) parted ways with Moorings after the 1994 tour, after which Moorings moved back to the Netherlands and took a three-year hiatus from music-writing.

Capitalizing on a resurgence in the popularity of gothic rock and the success of bands such as Nine Inch Nails and Rammstein, 1997 saw Moorings reverting the name to Clan of Xymox and moving to Germany – then the center of the burgeoning industrial music scene – to resume songwriting. Moorings recruited new live members and signed with the independent US label Tess Records in 1997 then with Metropolis in 1998. The LPs &quot;Hidden Faces&quot; (1997), &quot;Creatures&quot; (1999) and &quot;Notes from the Underground&quot; (2001) reflect an increasingly electro sound while maintaining the distinctive dance rhythms associated with the Clan of Xymox catalog. In 1998, 4AD re-released &quot;Clan of Xymox&quot; and &quot;Medusa&quot; in the US, and Xymox toured the United States the following year. 2003&#x27;s &quot;FareWell&quot; featured several charting tracks internationally. Most recently, the LP &quot;Matters of Mind, Body and Soul&quot; was released on Trisol, Metropolis and Gravitator record labels for European, American and Russian distribution, respectively, in February 2014.

In addition to intermittent original releases, Clan of Xymox has contributed to a number of compilations and side projects since conception. In 1987, the track &quot;Moscoviet Mosquito&quot; was re-recorded and released on the 4AD compilation album &quot;Lonely Is an Eyesore&quot;. In October 2000 the band released &quot;Live&quot;, a double CD with nineteen tracks and two videos featuring live performances of Xymox songs from the 4AD, Polygram, and independent eras. In September 2004, a &quot;Best of Clan of Xymox&quot; album was released with re-recorded versions of early hits as well as later offerings. In 2011, the track &quot;In Your Arms Again&quot; from the LP &quot;Darkest Hour&quot; was included on the soundtrack to David Fincher&#x27;s &quot;The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&quot;. In 2012 the band released a cover album, &quot;Kindred Spirits&quot;, featuring covers of several influential post-punk and new wave groups in Mooring&#x27;s own musical styling. The songs &quot;A Day&quot;, &quot;Masquerade&quot;, and &quot;Cry in the Wind&quot; were featured on the official soundtrack to the 2014 film &quot;The Guest&quot;.
== In popular culture ==
The band is referenced in the lyrics of the Half Man Half Biscuit song &quot;Faithlift&quot; from their 1995 album &quot;Some Call It Godcore&quot;.

<doc id="309801" wikidata="Q431965" url="?curid=309801" title="Information asymmetry">
<text>In contract theory, mechanism design, and economics, an information asymmetry is a situation where one party has more or better information than the other.

Information asymmetry creates an imbalance of power in transactions, which can sometimes cause the transactions to be inefficient, causing market failure in the worst case. Examples of this problem are adverse selection, moral hazard, and monopolies of knowledge.

A common way to visualise information asymmetry is with a scale, with one side being the seller and the other the buyer. When the seller has more or better information, the transaction will more likely occur in the seller&#x27;s favour (&quot;the balance of power has shifted to the seller&quot;). An example of this could be when a used car is sold, the seller is likely to have a much better understanding of the car&#x27;s condition and hence its market value than the buyer, who can only estimate the market value based on the information provided by the seller and their own assessment of the vehicle. The balance of power can, however, also be in the hands of the buyer. When buying health insurance, the buyer is not always required to provide full details of future health risks. By not providing this information to the insurance company, the buyer will pay the same premium as someone much less likely to require a payout in the future. The adjacent image illustrates the balance of power between two agents when there is perfect information. Perfect information means that all parties have complete knowledge. If the buyer has more information, the power to manipulate the transaction will be represented by the scale leaning towards the buyer&#x27;s side.

Information asymmetry extends to non-economic behaviour. Private firms have better information than regulators about the actions that they would take in the absence of regulation, and the effectiveness of a regulation may be undermined. International relations theory has recognized that wars may be caused by asymmetric information and that &quot;Most of the great wars of the modern era resulted from leaders miscalculating their prospects for victory&quot;. Jackson and Morelli wrote that there is asymmetric information between national leaders, when there are differences &quot;in what they know [i.e. believe] about each other&#x27;s armaments, quality of military personnel and tactics, determination, geography, political climate, or even just about the relative probability of different outcomes&quot; or where they have &quot;incomplete information about the motivations of other agents&quot;.

Information asymmetries are studied in the context of principal–agent problems where they are a major cause of misinforming and is essential in every communication process. Information asymmetry is in contrast to perfect information, which is a key assumption in neo-classical economics.

In 1996, a Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics was awarded to James A. Mirrlees and William Vickrey for their &quot;fundamental contributions to the economic theory of incentives under asymmetric information&quot;. This led the Nobel Committee to acknowledge the importance of information problems in economics. They later awarded another Nobel Prize in 2001 to George Akerlof, Michael Spence, and Joseph E. Stiglitz for their &quot;analyses of markets with asymmetric information&quot;. The 2007 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences was awarded to Leonid Hurwicz, Eric Maskin, and Roger Myerson &quot;for having laid the foundations of mechanism design theory&quot;, a field dealing with designing markets that encourage participants to honestly reveal their information.

== History ==
The puzzle of information asymmetry has existed for as long as the market itself but remained largely unstudied until the post-WWII period. It is an umbrella term that can contain a vast diversity of topics.

Greek Stoics (2nd century BCE) treated the advantage that sellers derive from privileged information in the story of the Merchant of Rhodes. Accordingly, a famine had broken out on the island of Rhodes and several grain merchants in Alexandria set sail to deliver supplies. One of these merchants who arrives ahead of his competitors faces a choice: should he let Rhodians know that grain supplies are on the way or keep this knowledge to himself? Either decision will determine his profit margin. Cicero related this dilemma in &quot;De Officiis&quot; and agreed with Greek Stoics that the merchant had a duty to disclose. Thomas Aquinas overturned this consensus and considered price disclosure was not obligatory.

The three topics mentioned above drew on some important predecessors. Joseph Stiglitz considered the work of earlier economists, including Adam Smith, John Stuart Mill, and Max Weber. He ultimately concludes that though these economists seemed to have an understanding of the problems of information, they largely did not consider the implications of them, and tended to minimize the impact they could have or consider them merely secondary issues.

One exception to this is the work of economist Friedrich Hayek. His work with prices as information conveying relative scarcity of goods can be noted as an early form of acknowledging information asymmetry, but with a different name.

=== 2001 Nobel Prize Inspirations ===
Information problems have always affected the lives of humans, yet it was not studied with any seriousness until near the 1970s when three economists fleshed out models which revolutionized the way we think about information and its interaction with the market. George Akerlof&#x27;s paper &quot;The Market for Lemons&quot; introduced a model to help explain a variety of market outcomes when quality is uncertain. Akerlof&#x27;s primary model considers the automobile market where the seller knows the exact quality of a car. In contrast, the buyer only knows the probability of whether a vehicle is good or bad (a lemon). Since the buyer pays the same price (based on their expected quality) for good cars and bad cars, sellers with high-quality cars may find the transaction unprofitable and leave, resulting in a market with a higher proportion of bad cars. The pathological path can continue as the buyer adjusts the expected quality and offers even lower prices, further driving out cars with not-so-bad quality. This results in a market failure purely driven by information asymmetry, as under perfect information, all cars can be sold according to their quality. Akerlof extends the model to explain other phenomena: Why raising the insurance price cannot facilitate seniors getting medical insurance? Why may employers rationally refuse to hire minorities? Through various applications, Akerlof developed the importance of trust in markets and highlighted the &quot;cost of dishonesty&quot; in insurance markets, credit markets, and developing areas. Around the same time, an economist by the name of Michael Spence wrote on the topic of job market signaling, and was introduced a work of the same name. The final topic is Stiglitz&#x27;s work on the mechanism of screening. These three economists helped to further clarify a variety of economic puzzles at the time and would go on to win a Nobel Prize in 2001 for their contributions to the field. Since then, several economists have followed in their footsteps to solve more pieces of the puzzle.

==== Akerlof ====

Akerlof drew heavily from the work of economist Kenneth Arrow. Arrow, who was awarded a Nobel Prize in Economics in 1972, studied uncertainty in the field of medical care, among other things (Arrow 1963). His work highlighted several factors which became important to Akerlof&#x27;s studies. First, is the idea of moral hazard. By being insured, customers may be inclined to be less careful than they otherwise would without insurance because they know the costs will be covered. Thus, an incentive to be less careful and increase risk exists. Second, Arrow studied the business models of insurance companies and noted that higher-risk individuals are pooled with lower-risk individuals, but both are covered at the same cost. Third, Arrow noted the role of trust in the relationship between doctor and patient. Medical providers only get paid when a patient is sick, and not when a person is healthy. Because of this, there is a great incentive for doctors to not provide the quality of care they could. A patient must defer to the doctor and trust that the doctor is using their knowledge to their best advantage to provide the patient with the best care. Thus, a relationship of trust is established. According to Arrow, the doctor relies on the social obligation of trust to sell their services to the public, even though the patients do not or cannot inspect the quality of a doctor&#x27;s work. Last, he notes how this unique relationship demands that high levels of education and certification be attained by doctors in order to maintain the quality of medical service provided by doctors. These four ideas from Arrow contributed largely to Akerlof&#x27;s work.

==== Spence ====
Spence cited no sources for his inspiration. However, he did acknowledge Kenneth Arrow and Thomas Schelling as helpful in discussing ideas during his pursuit of knowledge. He was the first to coin the term &quot;signaling&quot;, and encouraged other economists to follow in his footsteps because he believed he had introduced an important concept in economics.

==== Stiglitz ====
Most of Stiglitz&#x27;s academic inspirations were from his contemporaries. Stiglitz primarily attributes his thinking to articles by Spence, Akerlof, and a few earlier works by him and his co-author Michael Rothschild (Rothschild and Stiglitz 1976), each discussing various aspects of screening and the role of education. Stiglitz&#x27;s work was a complement to the works of Spence and Akerlof and thus drew from some of the same inspirations from Arrow as Akerlof had.

The discussion of information asymmetry came to the forefront of economics in the 1970s when Akerlof introduced the idea of a &quot;market for lemons&quot; in a paper by the same name (Akerlof 1970). In this paper, Akerlof introduced a fundamental concept that certain sellers of used cars have more knowledge than the buyers, and this can lead to what is known as &quot;adverse selection&quot;. This idea may be one of the most important in the history and understanding of asymmetric information in economics.

Spence introduced the idea of &quot;signaling&quot; shortly after the publication of Akerlof&#x27;s work.

Stiglitz expanded upon the ideas of Spence and Akerlof by introducing an economic function of information asymmetry called &quot;screening&quot;. Stiglitz&#x27;s work in this area referred to the market for insurance, which is rife with information asymmetry problems to be studied.

=== Impact of 2001 Nobel Work ===
These three economists&#x27; simple yet revolutionary work birthed a movement in economics that changed how the field viewed the market forever. No longer can perfect information be assumed in some problems, as in most neoclassical models. Information asymmetry began to grow in prevalence in academic literature. In 1996, a Nobel Prize was given to James Mirrlees and William Vickrey for their research back in the 1970s and 1970s on incentive problems when facing uncertainty under asymmetric information. The impact of such academic work can go unrecognized for decades. Differing from the topics presented by Akerlof, Spence and Stiglitz, Mirrlees and Vickrey focused on how income taxation and auctions can be used as a mechanism to draw out information from market participants efficiently. This award marked the importance of information asymmetry in economics. It began a greater discussion on the topic that later led the Nobel committee to award three economists again in 2001 for significant contributions to the aforementioned topics.

These economists continued after the 1970s to contribute to the field of economics and develop their theories, and they have all had significant impacts. Akerlof&#x27;s work had more impact than just the market for used cars. The pooling effect in the used car market also happens in the employment market for minorities.

One of the most notable impacts of Akerlof&#x27;s work is its impact on Keynesian theory. Akerlof argues that the Keynesian theory of unemployment being voluntary implies that quits would rise with unemployment. He argues against his critics by drawing upon reasoning based on psychology and sociology rather than pure economics. He supplemented this with an argument that people do not always behave rationally, but rather information asymmetry leads to only &quot;near rationality&quot;, which causes people to deviate from optimal behavior regarding employment practices.

Akerlof continues to champion behavioral economics, that these breaches into the fields of psychology and sociology are profound extensions of information asymmetry.

Stiglitz wrote that the trio&#x27;s work has created a substantial wave in the field of economics. He notes how he explored the economies of third-world countries, and they seemed to exhibit behavior consistent with their theories. He noted how other economists have referred to gaining information as a transaction cost. Stiglitz also attempts to narrow down the sources of information asymmetries. He ties it back to the nature of each individual having information that others do not. Stiglitz also mentions how information asymmetry can be overcome. He believes there are two crucial things to consider: first, the incentives, and second, the mechanisms for overcoming information asymmetry. He argues that the incentives will always be there because markets are inherently informationally inefficient. If there is an opportunity to profit from gaining knowledge, people will do so. If there is no profit to be had, then people will not do so.

Spence&#x27;s work on signaling moved on in the 1980s to spawn the field of study known as game theory.

The idea of information asymmetry has also had a significant effect on management research. It continues to offer additional improvements and opportunities as scholars continue their work.

==Models==
Information asymmetry models assume one party possesses some information that other parties have no access to. Some asymmetric information models can also be used in situations where at least one party can enforce, or effectively retaliate for breaches of, certain parts of an agreement, whereas the other(s) cannot.

=== Adverse selection ===

Akerlof suggested that information asymmetry leads to adverse selections. In adverse selection models, the ignorant party lacks or has differing information while negotiating an agreed understanding of or contract to the transaction. An example of adverse selection is when people who are high-risk are more likely to buy insurance because the insurance company cannot effectively discriminate against them, usually due to lack of information about the particular individual&#x27;s risk but also sometimes by force of law or other constraints.

Credence Goods fits in the adverse selection model of information asymmetry. These are goods where the buyer lacks the knowledge even after a product is consumed to disguise the product&#x27;s quality or where the buyer is unaware of the quality needed. An example of this are complex medical treatments such as heart surgery.

=== Moral hazard ===
Moral hazard occurs when the ignorant party lacks information about the performance of the agreed-upon transaction or lacks the ability to retaliate for a breach of the agreement. This can result in a situation where a party is more likely to take risks because they are not fully responsible for the consequences of their actions. An example of moral hazard is when people are more likely to behave recklessly after becoming insured, either because the insurer cannot observe this behaviour or cannot effectively retaliate against it, for example, by failing to renew the insurance.

Moral Hazard is not limited to individuals: firms can act more recklessly if they know they will be bailed out. For example, banks will allow parties to take out risky loans if they know that the government will bail them out.

=== Monopolies of knowledge ===
In the model of monopolies of knowledge, the ignorant party has no right to access all the critical information about a situation for decision-making. Meaning one party has exclusive control over information. This type of information asymmetry can be seen in government. An example of monopolies of knowledge is that in some enterprises, only high-level management can fully access the corporate information provided by a third party. At the same time, lower-level employees are required to make important decisions with only limited information provided to them.

== Solutions ==
Countermeasures have widely been discussed to reduce information asymmetry. The classic paper on adverse selection is George Akerlof&#x27;s &quot;The Market for Lemons&quot; from 1970, which brought informational issues to the forefront of economic theory. Exploring signaling and screening, the paper discusses two primary solutions to this problem. A similar concept is moral hazard, which differs from adverse selection at the timing level. While adverse selection affects parties &quot;before&quot; the interaction, moral hazard affects parties &quot;after&quot; the interaction. Regulatory instruments such as mandatory information disclosure can also reduce information asymmetry. Warranties can further help mitigate the effect of asymmetric information.

=== Signalling ===

Michael Spence originally proposed the idea of signalling. He suggested that in a situation with information asymmetry, it is possible for people to signal their type, thus believably transferring information to the other party and resolving the asymmetry.

This idea was initially studied in the context of matching in the job market. An employer is interested in hiring a new employee who is &quot;skilled in learning&quot;. Of course, all prospective employees will claim to be &quot;skilled in learning&quot;, but only they know if they really are. This is an information asymmetry.

Spence proposes, for example, that going to college can function as a credible signal of an ability to learn. Assuming that people who are skilled in learning can finish college more easily than people who are unskilled, then by finishing college, the skilled people signal their skills to prospective employers. No matter how much or how little they may have learned in college or what they studied, finishing functions as a signal of their capacity for learning. However, finishing college may merely function as a signal of their ability to pay for college; it may signal the willingness of individuals to adhere to orthodox views, or it may signal a willingness to comply with authority.

Signalling theory can be used in e-commerce research. Information asymmetry in e-commerce comes from information distortion that leads to the buyer&#x27;s misunderstanding of the seller&#x27;s true characteristics before the contract. Mavlanova, Benbunan-Fich and Koufaris (2012) noticed that signalling theory explains the relation between signals and qualities, illustrating why some signals are trustworthy and others are not. In e-commerce, signals deliver information about the characteristics of the seller. For instance, high-quality sellers are able to show their identity to buyers by using signs and logos, and then buyers check these signals to evaluate the credibility and validity of a seller&#x27;s qualities. The study of Mavlanova, Benbunan-Fich and Koufaris (2012) also confirmed that signal usage is different between low-quality and high-quality online sellers. Low-quality sellers are more likely to avoid using expensive, easy-to-verify signals and tend to use fewer signals than high-quality sellers. Thus, signals help reduce information asymmetry.

===Screening===

Joseph E. Stiglitz pioneered the theory of screening. In this way, the under informed party can induce the other party to reveal their information. They can provide a menu of choices in such a way that the choice depends on the private information of the other party.

The side of asymmetry can occur on either buyer or seller. For example, sellers with better information than buyers include used-car salespeople, mortgage brokers and loan originators, financial institutions and real estate agents. Alternatively, situations where the buyer usually has better information than the seller include estate sales as specified in a last will and testament, life insurance, or sales of old art pieces without a prior professional assessment of their value. This situation was first described by Kenneth J. Arrow in an article on health care in 1963.

George Akerlof, in &quot;The Market for Lemons&quot; notices that, in such a market, the average value of the commodity tends to go down, even for those of perfectly good quality. Because of information asymmetry, unscrupulous sellers can sell &quot;forgeries&quot; (like replica goods such as watches) and defraud the buyer. Meanwhile, buyers usually do not have enough information to distinguish lemons from quality goods. As a result, many people not willing to risk getting ripped off will avoid certain types of purchases or will not spend as much for a given item. Akerlof demonstrates that it is even possible for the market to decay to the point of nonexistence.
An example of adverse selection and information asymmetry causing market failure is the market for health insurance. Policies usually group subscribers together, where people can leave, but no one can join after it is set. As health conditions are realized over time, information involving health costs will arise, and low-risk policyholders will realize the mismatch in the premiums and health conditions. Due to this, healthy policyholders are incentivized to leave and reapply to get a cheaper policy that matches their expected health costs, which causes the premiums to increase. As high-risk policyholders are more dependent on insurance, they are stuck with higher premium costs as the group size reduces, which causes premiums to increase even further. This cycle repeats until the high-risk policy holders also find similar health policies with cheaper premiums, in which the initial group disappears. This concept is known as the death spiral and has been researched as early as 1988.

Akerlof also suggests different methods with which information asymmetry can be reduced. One of those instruments that can be used to reduce the information asymmetry between market participants is intermediary market institutions called counteracting institutions, for instance, guarantees for goods. By providing a guarantee, the buyer in the transaction can use extra time to obtain the same amount of information about the good as the seller before the buyer takes on the complete risk of the good being a &quot;lemon&quot;. Other market mechanisms that help reduce the imbalance in information include brand names, chains and franchising that guarantee the buyer a threshold quality level. These mechanisms also let owners of high-quality products get the full value of the goods. These counteracting institutions then keep the market size from reducing to zero.

=== Warranty ===
Warranties are utilised as a method of verifying the credibility of a product and are a guarantee issued by the seller promising to replace or repair the good should the quality not be sufficient. Product warranties are often requested from buying parties or financial lenders and have been used as a form of mediation dating back to the Babylonian era. Warranties can come in the form of insurance and can also come at the expense of the buyer. The implementation of &quot;lemon laws&quot; has eradicated the effect of information asymmetry upon customers who have received a faulty item. Essentially, this involves the customers returning a defective product regardless of circumstances within a certain time period.

===Mandatory information disclosure===
Both signaling and screening resemble voluntary information disclosure, where the party having more information, for their own best interest, use various measures to inform the other party. However, voluntary information disclosure is not always feasible. Regulators can thus take active measures to facilitate the spread of information. For example, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) initiated Regulation Fair Disclosure (RFD) so that companies must faithfully disclose material information to investors. The policy has reduced information asymmetry, reflected in the lower trading costs.

===Incentives and penalties===
For firms to reduce moral hazard, they can implement penalties for bad behaviour and incentives to align objectives. An example of building in an incentive is insurance companies not insuring customers for the total value; this provides an incentive to be less reckless as the customer will suffer financial liability as well.

==Information gathering==
Most models in traditional contract theory assume that asymmetric information is exogenously given. Yet, some authors have also studied contract-theoretic models in which asymmetric information arises endogenously because agents decide whether or not to gather information. Specifically, Crémer and Khalil (1992) and Crémer, Khalil, and Rochet (1998a) study an agent&#x27;s incentives to acquire private information after a principal has offered a contract. In a laboratory experiment, Hoppe and Schmitz (2013) have provided empirical support for the theory. Several further models have been developed which study variants of this setup. For instance, when the agent has not gathered information at the outset, does it make a difference whether or not he learns the information later on, before production starts? What happens if the information can be gathered already before a contract is offered? What happens if the principal observes the agent&#x27;s decision to acquire information? Finally, the theory has been applied in several contexts, such as public-private partnerships and vertical integration.

==Sources==
Information asymmetry within societies can be created and maintained in several ways. Firstly, media outlets, due to their ownership structure or political influences, may fail to disseminate certain viewpoints or choose to engage in propaganda campaigns. Furthermore, an educational system relying on substantial tuition fees can generate information imbalances between the poor and the affluent. Imbalances can also be fortified by specific organizational and legal measures, such as document classification procedures or non-disclosure clauses. Exclusive information networks that are operational around the world further contribute to the asymmetry. Copyright laws increase information imbalances between the poor and the affluent. Lastly, mass surveillance helps the political and industrial leaders to amass large volumes of information, which is typically not shared with the rest of society.

== Market impact ==
Zavolokina, Schlegel, and Schwabe (2020) state that Information asymmetry makes buyers and sellers distrust each other, which leads to opportunistic behaviour and may even lead to complete break down of the market. At the same time, lower quality provision in markets is also one of the consequences, as sellers do not get benefits enough to cover their production costs of providing higher quality products.

Countermeasures

* Establish a real-time information announce platform, according to the collect information to achieve market transparency，eliminate trading concerns thereby.
* Enhance customer experience by third-party quality checks like providing expert reviews.
* Consumer protection law ensure that product quality meets expectations and that contract terms are fair.
* Ensure quality in the form of standards and certificates and prove that all technical parameters have been tested.

==Application in research==

=== Accounting and finance ===
A substantial portion of research in the field of accounting can be framed in terms of information asymmetry, since accounting involves the transmission of an enterprise&#x27;s information from those who have it to those who need it for decision-making. Bartov and Bodnar (1996) mentioned that the different accounting methods used by enterprises can lead to information asymmetry. For instance aggressively recognising revenue can result in preparers of financial statements having a much better understanding of the levels of future revenue then those reading the statements. Likewise, in finance literature, the acknowledgment of information asymmetry between organizations challenged the Modigliani–Miller theorem, which states that the valuation of a firm is unaffected by its financial structure. It challenges the theorem as one of the key assumptions is that investors would have the same information as a corporation. If there is not symmetry in information corporations can leverage their capital structure to get the most out of their valuation. Information asymmetry shed light on the importance of aligning interests of managers with those of stakeholders. As managers with significant power from information may make decisions based on their own interest as opposed to the companies. When the level of information asymmetry and associated monitoring cost is high, firms tend to rely less on board monitoring and more on incentive alignment. Various measures are used to align interest of managers to stop them from abusing their power from information asymmetry such as compensating based on performance using a bonus structure. This field of study is referred to as agency theory. Furthermore, financial economists apply information asymmetry in studies of differentially informed financial market participants (insiders, stock analysts, investors, etc.) or in the cost of finance for MFIs.

=== Effect of blogging ===
The effect of blogging as a source of information asymmetry as well as a tool reduce asymmetric information has also been well studied. Blogging on financial websites provides bottom-up communication among investors, analysts, journalists, and academics, as financial blogs help prevent people in charge from withholding financial information from their company and the general public. Compared to traditional forms of media such as newspapers and magazines, blogging provides an easy-to-access venue for information. A 2013 study by Gregory Saxton and Ashley Anker concluded that more participation on blogging sites from credible individuals reduces information asymmetry between corporate insiders, additionally reducing the risk of insider trading.

=== Game theory ===
Game theory can be used to analyse asymmetric information. A large amount of the foundational ideas in game theory builds on the framework of information asymmetry.

In simultaneous games, each player has no prior knowledge of an opponent&#x27;s move. In sequential games, players may observe all or part of the opponent&#x27;s moves. One example of information asymmetry is one player can observe the opponent&#x27;s past activities while the other player cannot. Therefore, the existence and level of information asymmetry in a game determines the dynamics of the game.

James Fearon in his study of the explanations for war in a game theoretic context notices that war could be a consequence of information asymmetry – two countries will not reach a non-violent settlement because they have incentives to distort the amount of military resources they possess.

=== Contract theory ===
Contract theory provides insights into how various economic agents can enter contractual arrangements in situation of unequal levels of information. The development of contract theory is based on assuming its parties possess different levels of information on the contract&#x27;s subject. For instance, in a road construction contract, a civil engineer may have more information on the various inputs required to undertake the project, than the other parties. Through contract theory, economic agents gain insights on how they can exploit information available to them, to enter beneficial contractual arrangements. The impact information asymmetry causes among parties with competing interests, such as games, has contributed to game theory. In no game do its players have complete information about each other; most importantly, no player knows the strategy the others intends to use to realize a win. This information asymmetry, together with the competing interests have resulted in the development of game theory (which seeks to provides insights as to how parties caught up in a situation where they are required to compete under a set of rules, can maximize their expected outcomes).

Information asymmetry occurs in situations where some parties have more information regarding an issue than others. It is considered a major cause of market failure. The contribution of information asymmetry to market failure arises from the fact that it impairs with the free hand which is expected to guide how modern markets work. For example, the stock market forms a major avenue through which publicly traded entities can raise their capital. The operation of stock markets across the world, is carried in a way that ensures current and potential investors have the same level of information about the stocks or any other securities that may be listed in that market. That level of information symmetry helps to ensure similar conditions to all parties in the market, which in turn helps to ensure the securities listed in those markets trade at fair value. However, cases of information sometimes arise, when certain parties obtain information that is not in the public domain. This can create market return abnormalities, such as an abrupt surge or decline in a security.

=== Artificial intelligence ===
Tshilidzi Marwala and Evan Hurwitz in their study of the relationship between information asymmetry and artificial intelligence observed that there is a reduced level of information asymmetry between two artificial intelligent agents than between two human agents. As a consequence, when these artificial intelligent agents engage in financial markets it reduces arbitrage opportunities making markets more efficient. The study also revealed that as the number of artificial intelligent agents in the market increase, the volume of trades in the market will decrease. This is primarily because information asymmetry of the perceptions of value of goods and services is the basis of trade.

=== Management ===
Information asymmetry has been applied in a variety of ways in management research ranging from conceptualizations of information asymmetry to building resolutions to reduce it. Studies have shown that information asymmetry can be a source of competitive advantage for the firms. A 2013 study by Schmidt and Keil has revealed that the presence of private information asymmetry within firms influences normal business activities. Firms that have a more concrete understanding of their resources can use this information to gauge their advantage over competitors. In Ozeml, Reuer and Gulati&#x27;s 2013 study, they found that &#x27;different information&#x27; was an additional source of information asymmetry in venture capitalist and alliance networks; when different team members bring diverse, specialized knowledge, values and outlooks towards a common strategic decision, the lack of homogeneous information distribution among the members leads to inefficient decision making.

Firms have the ability to apply strategies that exploit their informational gap. One way they can do this is through impression management, which involves undertaking actions and releasing information to influence stakeholders&#x27; and analysts&#x27; opinions positively, exploiting information asymmetry as external parties heavily rely on the information released by firms. A second way that firms exploit information asymmetry is through decoupling. This describes the discrepancy between formal procedures and failure to implement them. An example of this is executives announcing a stock repurchase plan without any intention of carrying it out, allowing them to raise new cash flow for their own benefit at the expense of shareholders. Management research goes on to explain that agents can perpetuate information asymmetry through information concealment. This involves firms not sharing information to exploit the informational advantage over rivals. In resource-based theory, it shows firms concealing information about their competitive advantage in order to build causal ambiguity to protect their firm from imitation.

Information asymmetry problems can be addressed by management through several approaches. First is the usage of incentives to encourage the disclosure and sharing information. An example of this is partnering specifically with companies that disclose relatively more information. Second, is through precommitment, where actions are undertaken at present to ensure future commitments. Third, is the usage of an information intermediary in which an intermediary is used to gather and relay information between two parties. A common example of this are financial analysts that gather information from the financial statements of a company, and uses it to create reports and advice for potential investors and clients. Fourth, is the usage of monitoring and reward. Monitoring allows management to confirm information that was previously uncertain, such as performance and behaviour. Monitoring can also be used alongside other incentives such as rewarding for performance.

=== Online advertising ===
Online advertising is a dominant form of advertising, and a potential source of information asymmetry. Online advertising consists of utilities(a good) being encoded into a message received by a customer who decodes the message, making a purchasing decision. Firms&#x27; messages are tailored to specific goals and intentions, and can be a source of information asymmetry due to interpretation, or intent. The nature of the internet and prevalence of social media in society has given firms opportunities to create promotional content in a less passive way than other forms of advertising. &#x27;Noise&#x27; represents any techniques that are used with the intent of obstructing, altering, or blocking the interpretation of the message by the receiver. This can increase the amount of information asymmetry in a transaction, as the buyer may not understand the product to its fullest extent, even if they believe to fully understand the message being sent to them.

Firms communicate to the virtual marketplace through online advertising, and as such the feedback of consumers feeling manipulated or feeling the presence of information asymmetry may be indicative of the lack of transparency by a firm. Highly advertised and strongly promoted items are generally more likely to be bought by customers, even if the product is inferior to less advertised competition, introducing adverse selection. The power of the internet also changes how consumers deal with information asymmetry, as they have the means to find vast amounts of information about products with relatively little effort. While a consumer can use this power to assist their research to find a product that is not being marketed maliciously, this decision is made due to information asymmetry, not due to the customer being perfectly rational.

Some consumers are aware of the usage of strategies and techniques by firms to advertise and influence their media consumption, however do not necessarily alter their trust in the source of the information accordingly. Online advertising that appears trustworthy but can be malicious in intent can still be trusted by consumers, despite the information asymmetry, even if consumers themselves identify as critical of the medium. Social media personalities, much like other celebrities, also have influence over consumers who would otherwise consider themselves dissuaded by the advertising, providing firms another method of aggressive advertising with potential information asymmetry.

<text>Remain in Light is the fourth studio album by the American rock band Talking Heads, released on October 8, 1980, by Sire Records. The band&#x27;s third and final album to be produced by Brian Eno, &quot;Remain in Light&quot; was recorded at Compass Point Studios in the Bahamas and Sigma Sound Studios in New York in July and August 1980.

After the release of &quot;Fear of Music&quot; in 1979, Talking Heads and Eno sought to dispel notions of the band as a mere vehicle for frontman and songwriter David Byrne. Drawing influence from Nigerian Afrobeat musician Fela Kuti, they blended African polyrhythms and funk with electronics, recording instrumental tracks as a series of looping grooves. Session musicians included the guitarist Adrian Belew, the singer Nona Hendryx, and the trumpeter Jon Hassell.

Byrne struggled with writer&#x27;s block, but adopted a scattered, stream-of-consciousness lyrical style inspired by early rap and academic literature on Africa. The album artwork was conceived by the bassist, Tina Weymouth, and the drummer, Chris Frantz, with the help of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology&#x27;s computers and design company, M&amp;Co. The band hired additional members for a promotional tour, after which they went on a year-long hiatus to pursue side projects.

&quot;Remain in Light&quot; attained widespread acclaim from critics for its sonic experimentation, rhythmic innovations, and merging of disparate genres into a cohesive whole. The album reached number 19 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart and number 21 on the UK Albums Chart, and produced the singles &quot;Once in a Lifetime&quot; and &quot;Houses in Motion&quot;. It has been featured in several publications&#x27; lists of the best albums of the 1980s and of all time, and is often considered Talking Heads&#x27; magnum opus. In 2017, the Library of Congress deemed the album &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; and selected it for preservation in the National Recording Registry.

==Background==
In January 1980, the members of Talking Heads returned to New York City after touring in support of their 1979 album &quot;Fear of Music&quot;, and took time off to pursue personal interests. Singer David Byrne worked with Brian Eno, the record&#x27;s producer, on the album &quot;My Life in the Bush of Ghosts&quot;. Keyboardist Jerry Harrison produced an album for soul singer Nona Hendryx at Sigma Sound Studios&#x27; secondary facility in New York City; Talking Heads would later record at Sigma and employ Hendryx as a backing vocalist on Harrison&#x27;s advice.

Drummer Chris Frantz and bassist Tina Weymouth, a married couple, discussed leaving Talking Heads after Weymouth suggested that Byrne was too controlling. Frantz did not want to leave, and the two took a long vacation in the Caribbean to ponder the state of the band and their marriage. They became involved in Haitian Vodou religious ceremonies, practiced native percussion instruments, and socialised with the reggae rhythm section of Sly and Robbie.

Frantz and Weymouth ended their holiday by purchasing an apartment above Compass Point Studios in Nassau, Bahamas, where Talking Heads and Eno had recorded &quot;More Songs About Buildings and Food&quot; in 1978. Byrne joined the duo and Harrison there in early 1980. The band members realized that songwriting had thus far been largely Byrne&#x27;s responsibility, and that they had become tired of the notion of being a singer and a backing band; the ideal they aimed for, according to Byrne, was &quot;sacrificing our egos for mutual cooperation&quot;. Byrne also wanted to escape &quot;the psychological paranoia and personal torment&quot; that he had been feeling and writing about in New York. Instead of writing music to Byrne&#x27;s lyrics, the group performed extended instrumental jams, using the &quot;Fear of Music&quot; track &quot;I Zimbra&quot; as a foundation.

Eno arrived in the Bahamas three weeks after Byrne. While reluctant to work with the band again after collaborating on their previous two albums, he changed his mind after hearing the instrumental demo tapes. The band and Eno experimented with the communal African way of making music, in which individual parts mesh as polyrhythms. Nigerian musician Fela Kuti&#x27;s 1973 album &quot;Afrodisiac&quot; became the band and Eno&#x27;s template for the album. According to Weymouth, the emergence of hip-hop made the band realize that the musical landscape was changing. Before the studio sessions began, the band&#x27;s friend David Gans told them that &quot;the things one doesn&#x27;t intend are the seeds for a more interesting future&quot;, encouraging them to experiment, improvise and make use of &quot;mistakes&quot;.

==Recording and production==

Recording sessions started at Compass Point Studios in July 1980. The album&#x27;s creation required additional musicians, particularly percussionists. Talking Heads used the working title &quot;Melody Attack&quot; throughout the studio process after watching a Japanese game show of the same name. According to Harrison, the band&#x27;s ambition was to blend rock and African genres rather than simply imitate African music. Eno&#x27;s production techniques and personal approach were key to the record&#x27;s conception. The process was geared to promote the expression of instinct and spontaneity without overtly focusing on the sound of the final product. Eno compared the creative process to &quot;looking out to the world and saying, &#x27;What a fantastic place we live in. Let&#x27;s celebrate it.&#x27;&quot;

Sections and instrumentals were recorded one at a time in a discontinuous process. Loops played a key part at a time when computers could not yet adequately perform such functions. Talking Heads developed &quot;Remain in Light&quot; by recording jams, isolating the best parts, and learning to play them repetitively. The basic tracks focused wholly on rhythms and were all performed in a minimalist method using only one chord. Each section was recorded as a long loop to enable the creation of compositions through the positioning or merging of loops in different ways. Byrne likened the process to modern sampling: &quot;We were human samplers.&quot;

According to Frantz, the band had met with Jamaican reggae producer Lee &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry in New York and arranged to record with him at Compass Point, but he did not show up to the sessions. After a few sessions at Compass Point, engineer Rhett Davies left following an argument with Eno over the fast pace of recording, and Steven Stanley stepped in to replace him. Frantz credited Stanley with helping to create &quot;Once in a Lifetime&quot;. A Lexicon 224 digital reverberation unit, one of the first of its kind, was obtained by engineer Dave Jerden and used on the album. Like Davies, Jerden was unhappy with the fast pace at which Eno wanted to record, but he did not complain.

The tracks made Byrne rethink his vocal style and he tried singing to the instrumental songs, but sounded &quot;stilted&quot;. Few vocal sections were recorded in the Bahamas. The lyrics were written when the band returned to the U.S., in New York City and California. Harrison booked Talking Heads into Sigma Sound, which focused primarily on R&amp;B, after convincing the owners that the band&#x27;s work could bring them a new clientele. In New York City, Byrne struggled with writer&#x27;s block, Harrison and Eno spent their time tweaking the compositions recorded in the Bahamas, and Frantz and Weymouth often did not show up at the studio. Doubts began to surface about whether the album would be completed, which were assuaged only after the recruitment of guitarist Adrian Belew at the request of Byrne, Harrison, and Eno. Belew was advised to add guitar solos to the Compass Point tracks, making use of numerous effects units and a Roland guitar synthesizer. Belew performed on the tracks that would become &quot;Crosseyed and Painless&quot;, &quot;The Great Curve&quot;, &quot;Listening Wind&quot; and &quot;The Overload&quot;; in 2022, he recalled that &quot;all of [his] parts were done in one day&quot;. Singer Robert Palmer, who had recorded his album Clues at the same studio shortly before Talking Heads used the facility, contributed additional percussion to &quot;Remain in Light&quot;.

Byrne recorded the rough mixes to a cassette tape and improvised over them on a portable tape recorder. He tried to create onomatopoeic rhymes in the style of Eno, who believed that lyrics were never the center of a song&#x27;s meaning. Byrne continuously listened to his recorded scatting until convinced that he was no longer &quot;hearing nonsense&quot;. After he was satisfied, Harrison invited Nona Hendryx to Sigma Sound to record backing vocals for the album. She was advised extensively on her vocal delivery by Byrne, Frantz, and Weymouth, and often sang in a trio with Byrne and Eno. Brass player Jon Hassell, who had worked with Byrne and Eno on &quot;My Life in the Bush of Ghosts&quot;, was hired to perform trumpet and horn overdubs. In August 1980, half of the album was mixed by Eno, engineer John Potoker, and Harrison in New York City, while the other half was mixed by Byrne and Jerden at Eldorado Studios in Los Angeles.

==Music and lyrics==

&quot;Remain in Light&quot; has been variously described as new wave, post-punk, worldbeat, dance-rock, art pop, art rock, avant-pop, Afrobeat, and psychedelic funk. Critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine called the album a &quot;dense amalgam of African percussion, funk bass and keyboards, pop songs, and electronics.&quot; The album contains eight songs with a &quot;striking free-associative feel&quot;, according to psychoanalyst Michael A. Brog, in that there is no extended thought process that can be followed in its stream-of-consciousness lyrics. Gans instructed Byrne to be freer with his lyrical content, advising him that &quot;rational thinking has its limits&quot;.

Byrne included a bibliography with the album press kit along with a statement that explained how the album was inspired by African mythologies and rhythms. The release stressed that the major inspiration for the lyrics was John Miller Chernoff&#x27;s &quot;African Rhythm and African Sensibility&quot;, which examined the musical enhancement of life in rural African communities. Chernoff travelled to Ghana in 1970 to study native percussion and wrote about how Africans have complicated conversations through drum patterns. One song, &quot;The Great Curve&quot;, exemplifies the African theme with the line &quot;The world moves on a woman&#x27;s hips&quot;, which Byrne used after reading Robert Farris Thompson&#x27;s book &quot;African Art in Motion&quot;. He also studied straight speech, from Watergate scandal co-conspirator John Dean&#x27;s testimony to the stories of African American former slaves.

Like the other tracks, album opener &quot;Born Under Punches (The Heat Goes On)&quot; borrows from &quot;preaching, shouting and ranting&quot;. The expression &quot;And the Heat Goes On&quot;, used in the title and repeated in the chorus, is based on a &quot;New York Post&quot; headline Eno read in the summer of 1980, while Byrne rewrote the song title &quot;Don&#x27;t Worry About the Government&quot; from Talking Heads&#x27; debut album, &quot;Talking Heads: 77&quot;, into the lyric &quot;Look at the hands of a government man&quot;. Although the unorthodox guitar solo has often been credited to Adrian Belew, it was in fact performed by Byrne (manipulating a Lexicon Prime Time digital delay unit).

The &quot;rhythmical rant&quot; in &quot;Crosseyed and Painless&quot;—&quot;Facts are simple and facts are straight. Facts are lazy and facts are late&quot;—was influenced by early hip-hop, specifically Kurtis Blow&#x27;s &quot;The Breaks&quot;, which was given to Byrne by Frantz. &quot;Once in a Lifetime&quot; borrows heavily from preachers&#x27; diatribes. While some critics deemed the song &quot;a kind of prescient jab at the excesses of the 1980s&quot;, Byrne disagreed with this categorization and commented that its lyrics were meant to be taken literally: &quot;We&#x27;re largely unconscious. You know, we operate half awake or on autopilot and end up, whatever, with a house and family and job and everything else, and we haven&#x27;t really stopped to ask ourselves, &#x27;How did I get here?&#x27;.&quot;

Byrne has described the album&#x27;s final mix as a &quot;spiritual&quot; piece of work, &quot;joyous and ecstatic and yet it&#x27;s serious&quot;; he has pointed out that, in the end, there was &quot;less Africanism in &quot;Remain in Light&quot; than we implied ... but the African ideas were far more important to get across than specific rhythms&quot;. According to Eno, the record uniquely blends funk with punk rock and new wave. None of the compositions include chord changes, relying instead on the use of different harmonies and counter-melodies over pedal points. &quot;Spidery riffs&quot; and layered tracks of bass guitar and percussion are used extensively.

The first side contains the more rhythmic songs, &quot;Born Under Punches (The Heat Goes On)&quot;, &quot;Crosseyed and Painless&quot;, and &quot;The Great Curve&quot;, which include long instrumental interludes. &quot;The Great Curve&quot; contains extended guitar solos by Belew, the first contributions that he made during his day in the studio. Belew performed the solo with the aid of four effects: an Electro-Harmonix Big Muff distortion unit, an Alembic Strat-o-Blaster preamp circuit, an equalizer, and an Electro-Harmonix Electric Mistress flanger.

The second side features more introspective songs. &quot;Once in a Lifetime&quot; pays homage to early rap techniques and the music of the Velvet Underground. The track was originally called &quot;Weird Guitar Riff Song&quot; because of its composition. It was conceived as a single riff before the band added a second; Eno alternated eight bars of each riff with corresponding bars of its counterpart. &quot;Houses in Motion&quot; incorporates long brass performances by Hassell, while &quot;Listening Wind&quot; features Arabic music influences, with Belew adding textural content via the Electric Mistress and &quot;bending] the sound up and down while working a delay and the volume control on my guitar&quot;. Closing track &quot;The Overload&quot; features &quot;tribal-cum-industrial&quot; beats created primarily by Harrison and Byrne alongside Belew&#x27;s &quot;growling guitar atmospherics&quot;.

==Packaging and title==

Weymouth and Frantz conceived the cover art with the help of Massachusetts Institute of Technology researcher Walter Bender and his ArcMac team (the precursor to the MIT Media Lab). Using &quot;Melody Attack&quot; as inspiration, the couple created a collage of red warplanes flying in formation over the Himalayas. The planes are an artistic depiction of Grumman Avenger planes in honor of Weymouth&#x27;s father, Ralph Weymouth, who was a US Navy Admiral. The idea for the back cover included simple portraits of the band members. Weymouth attended MIT regularly during the summer of 1980 and worked with Bender&#x27;s colleague, Scott Fisher, on the computer renditions of the ideas. The process was tortuous because computer power was limited in the early 1980s and the mainframe alone took up several rooms. Weymouth and Fisher shared a passion for masks and used the concept to experiment with the portraits. The faces were blotted out with blocks of red. As Eno wanted to be featured on the cover art as well, Weymouth considered superimposing Eno&#x27;s face on top of all four portraits to insinuate his egotism, but decided against it.

The rest of the artwork and the liner notes were crafted by graphic designer Tibor Kalman and his company M&amp;Co. Kalman was a fervent critic of formalism and professional design in art and advertisements. He offered his services for free to create publicity, and discussed using unconventional materials such as sandpaper and velour for the LP sleeve. Weymouth, who was skeptical of hiring a designing firm, vetoed Kalman&#x27;s ideas and held firm on the MIT images. The designing process made the band members realize that the title &quot;Melody Attack&quot; was &quot;too flippant&quot; for the music, and they adopted &quot;Remain in Light&quot; instead. Byrne has said, &quot;Besides not being all that melodic, the music had something to say that at the time seemed new, transcendent, and maybe even revolutionary, at least for funk rock songs.&quot; The image of the warplanes was relegated to the back of the sleeve and the doctored portraits became the front cover. Kalman later suggested that the planes were not removed altogether because they seemed appropriate during the then-ongoing Iran hostage crisis.
Weymouth advised Kalman that she wanted simple typography in a bold sans-serif font. M&amp;Co. complied, with Kalman coming up with the idea of inverting the &quot;A&quot;s in &quot;TALKING HEADS&quot;. Weymouth and Frantz decided to use the joint credit acronym C/T for the artwork, while Bender and Fisher used initials and code names because the project was not an official MIT venture. The design credits read &quot;HCL, JPT, DDD, WALTER GP, PAUL, C/T&quot;. The final mass-produced version of &quot;Remain in Light&quot; had one of the first computer-designed record jackets. Psychoanalyst Michael A. Brog has called its front cover a &quot;disarming image, which suggests both splitting and obliteration of identity&quot;, and which introduces the listener to the album&#x27;s recurring theme of &quot;identity disturbance&quot;; he has said, &quot;The image is in bleak contrast to the title with the obscured images of the band members unable to &#x27;remain in light&#x27;.&quot;

Talking Heads and Eno originally agreed to credit all songs in alphabetical order to &quot;David Byrne, Brian Eno, Chris Frantz, Jerry Harrison and Tina Weymouth&quot; after failing to devise an accurate formula for the split, but the album was released with the label credit: &quot;all songs written by David Byrne &amp; Brian Eno (except &quot;Houses In Motion&quot; and &#x27;The Overload&quot;, written by David Byrne, Brian Eno &amp; Jerry Harrison)&quot;. Frantz, Harrison, and Weymouth disputed the credits, especially for a process they had partly funded. According to Weymouth, Byrne told Kalman to doctor the credits on Eno&#x27;s advice. Later editions credit all band members. Frantz recalled in 2009 that he and Weymouth &quot;felt very burned by the credits dispute&quot;.

==Promotion and release==
Brian Eno advised Talking Heads that the music on &quot;Remain in Light&quot; was too dense for a quartet to perform live. The band expanded to nine musicians for the tours in support of the album, with Harrison recruiting Belew, Parliament-Funkadelic keyboardist Bernie Worrell, bassist Busta &quot;Cherry&quot; Jones, Ashford &amp; Simpson percussionist Steven Scales, and backing vocalist Dolette MacDonald. The larger group performed soundchecks in Frantz&#x27;s and Weymouth&#x27;s loft by following the rhythms established by Worrell, who had studied at the New England Conservatory and Juilliard School.

The expanded band&#x27;s first appearance was on August 23, 1980, at the Heatwave festival in Ontario, for an audience of 70,000; Robert Hilburn of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called the band&#x27;s new music a &quot;rock-funk sound with dramatic, near show-stopping force&quot;. On August 27, the expanded Talking Heads performed a showcase of tracks to an 8,000-person full house at the Wollman Rink, as well as approximately another 10,000 seated on the grass outside the walls, in Central Park. Only these two performances were initially planned, but Sire Records decided to support the nine-member band on an extended tour. After the promotional tour, the band went on hiatus for several years, leaving the individual members to pursue a variety of side projects.

&quot;Remain in Light&quot; was released worldwide on October 8, 1980, and received its world premiere, airing in its entirety, on October 10 on WDFM. According to writer David Sheppard, &quot;it was received as a great cultural event as much as a vivid art-pop record.&quot; Unusually, the album&#x27;s press release included a bibliography submitted by Byrne and Eno citing books by Chernoff and others to provide context for how the songs were conceived. “I didn&#x27;t read those books,” said an incensed Weymouth.

&quot;Remain in Light&quot; was certified Gold by the Canadian Recording Industry Association in February 1981 after shipping 50,000 copies, and by Recording Industry Association of America in September 1985 after shipping 500,000. Over one million copies of the album have been sold worldwide.

==Critical reception==
The album attained widespread critical acclaim on release. Ken Tucker of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; felt it was a brave and absorbing attempt to locate a common ground in the era&#x27;s divergent and often hostile musical genres; he concluded, &quot;&quot;Remain in Light&quot; yields scary, funny music to which you can dance and think, think and dance, dance and think, &quot;ad infinitum&quot;.&quot; Robert Christgau, in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, called the record one &quot;in which David Byrne conquers his fear of music in a visionary Afrofunk synthesis—clear-eyed, detached, almost mystically optimistic&quot;. Michael Kulp of the &quot;Daily Collegian&quot; wrote that the album deserved the tag &quot;classic&quot; like each of the band&#x27;s three previous full-length releases, while John Rockwell, writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, suggested that it confirmed Talking Heads&#x27; position as &quot;America&#x27;s most venturesome rock band&quot;. Sandy Robertson of &quot;Sounds&quot; praised the record&#x27;s innovation, while &quot;Billboard&quot; wrote, &quot;Just about every LP Talking Heads has released in the last four years has wound up on virtually every critics&#x27; best of list. &quot;Remain in Light&quot; should be no exception.&quot;

AllMusic&#x27;s William Ruhlmann wrote that Talking Heads&#x27; musical transition, first witnessed in &quot;Fear of Music&quot;, came to full fruition in &quot;Remain in Light&quot;: &quot;Talking Heads were connecting with an audience ready to follow their musical evolution, and the album was so inventive and influential.&quot; In the 1995 &quot;Spin Alternative Record Guide&quot;, Jeff Salamon praised Eno for reining in any excessive appropriations of African music. In 2004, &quot;Slant Magazine&quot;″s Barry Walsh labeled its results &quot;simply magical&quot; after the band turned rock music into a more global entity in terms of its musical and lyrical scope. In a 2008 review, Sean Fennessey of &quot;Vibe&quot; concluded, &quot;Talking Heads took African polyrhythms to NYC and made a return trip with elegant, alien post-punk in tow.&quot;

===Accolades and legacy===
&quot;Remain in Light&quot; was named the best album of 1980 by &quot;Sounds&quot;, ahead of the Skids&#x27; &quot;The Absolute Game&quot;, and by &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, while &quot;The New York Times&quot; included it in its unnumbered shortlist of the 10 best records issued that year. It figured highly in other end-of-year best album lists, notably at number two, behind The Clash&#x27;s &quot;London Calling&quot;, by Christgau, and at number six by &quot;NME&quot;. It featured at number three—behind &quot;London Calling&quot; and Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;The River&quot;—in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s 1980 Pazz &amp; Jop critics&#x27; poll, which aggregates the votes of hundreds of prominent reviewers.
In 1989, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named &quot;Remain in Light&quot; the fourth-best album of the 1980s. In 1993, it was included at number 11 in &quot;NME&quot;″s list of The 50 Greatest Albums Of The &#x27;80s, and at number 68 in the publication&#x27;s Greatest Albums Of All Time list. In 1997, &quot;The Guardian&quot; collated worldwide data from renowned critics, artists, and radio DJs, which placed the record at number 43 in the list of the 100 Best Albums Ever. In 1999, it was included by &quot;Vibe&quot; as one of its &quot;100 Essential Albums Of The 20th Century&quot;. In 2000 it was voted number 227 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;. In 2002, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; featured &quot;Remain in Light&quot; at number two, behind only Sonic Youth&#x27;s &quot;Daydream Nation,&quot; in its Top 100 Albums Of The 1980s list. In 2003, VH1 named the record at number 88 during its &quot;100 Greatest Albums&quot; countdown, while &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; included it in its unnumbered shortlist of &quot;50 Essential Pop Albums&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; placed it at number 129 in its December 2015 issue of &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;, as the highest of four Talking Heads releases on the list. In 2006, &quot;Q&quot; magazine placed &quot;Remain in Light&quot; at number 27 in its list of the &quot;40 Best Albums of the 80s&quot;. In 2012, &quot;Slant&quot; listed the album sixth on its list of the &quot;Best Albums of the 1980s&quot;. In 2020, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; included &quot;Remain in Light&quot; in its &quot;80 Greatest Albums of 1980&quot; list; the publication also ranked it number 39 on its updated list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; that year.

Radiohead credited &quot;Remain in Light&quot; as a major influence on their 2000 album &quot;Kid A&quot;. The Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood had assumed it was composed of loops, but learnt from Harrison that Talking Heads had instead recorded themselves playing the parts repetitively. Greenwood said: &quot;And that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s not exhausting to listen to because you&#x27;re not hearing the same piece of music over and over again. You&#x27;re hearing it slightly different every time. There&#x27;s a lesson there.&quot;

In 2018, the Beninese singer Angélique Kidjo released a song-for-song cover of &quot;Remain in Light&quot;, produced by Jeff Bhasker and released on his Kravenworks label. She described herself as a longtime fan of the song &quot;Once in a Lifetime&quot;, and wanted to pay tribute to the album by emphasizing its inspiration from African music.

In 2022, Harrison and Belew united for three concert dates for the album&#x27;s 40th anniversary, in which they played all of the album and several more Talking Heads songs. In 2023, they expanded the project to a full North American tour, and included material from Belew&#x27;s period in the Talking Heads-influenced 1980s incarnation of King Crimson.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harrison/Belew&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

<text>Public Radio International (PRI) was an American public radio organization. Headquartered in Minneapolis, Minnesota, PRI provided programming to over 850 public radio stations in the United States.

PRI was one of the main providers of programming for public radio stations in the U.S., alongside National Public Radio, American Public Media, and the Public Radio Exchange. PRI merged with the Public Radio Exchange in 2018.

==Background==
In the United States, PRI distributed well-known programming to public radio stations. Among its programs were the global news program &quot;The World&quot;, which PRI co-produced with WGBH Boston. Programs on PRI—sometimes mis-attributed to National Public Radio—were produced by a variety of organizations, including PRI in the United States and other countries. PRI, along with NPR and American Public Media, was one of the largest program producers and distributors of public radio programming in the United States. PRI offered over 280 hours of programming each week to stations and listeners. Public Radio International said its mission was to &quot;serve audiences as a distinctive content source for information, insights and cultural experiences essential to living in our diverse, interconnected world.&quot;

Approximately 850 radio station affiliates and other audio venues broadcast, streamed and downloaded PRI programs. According to the 2017 Nielsen Audio ratings, 8.1 million people listened to PRI programming each week.

PRI&#x27;s programs won awards for quality and innovation, including the DuPont-Columbia Award, Scripps Howard Award for Excellence in Electronic Media/Radio, George M. Foster Peabody Award, Golden Reel Award and Gabriel Award.

PRI programming received funding from station fees, corporate underwriting, and individual and corporate grants. Less than 2% of the overall operating budget came from United States government agencies.

==History==
PRI was founded in 1983 as American Public Radio as an alternative to NPR for public radio program distribution. Five stations established American Public Radio as a syndicate: the Minnesota Public Radio network, KQED in San Francisco, WNYC in New York City, WGUC in Cincinnati, and KUSC in Los Angeles. The corporation changed its name to Public Radio International in 1994 to reflect its growing interest and involvement in international audio publishing, as typified by its many collaborations with the BBC.

In the mid-1990s, PRI began to expand its reach by producing programming in addition to distributing programming. This evolution in the company began with PRI&#x27;s &quot;The World&quot;, originally a co-production among PRI, the BBC World Service, and WGBH.

In 2004, Minnesota Public Radio left PRI and began distributing its own shows (including &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot; and &quot;Marketplace&quot; and excluding &quot;Classical 24&quot;) through its newly created arm, American Public Media. In 2012, PRI was acquired by the WGBH Educational Foundation.

Public Radio International and Public Radio Exchange merged in 2018. Both networks maintained separate identities and programming until 2019, when the Public Radio International branding was retired. In 2020, the last remaining PRI program other than &quot;The World,&quot; &quot;Studio 360,&quot; aired its last episode, concluding with the PRI station identification.

==Recent program launches and firsts==
In 1995: PRI launches &quot;Classical 24&quot;, public radio&#x27;s first 24-hour classical music service, as a co-production with Minnesota Public Radio.

In 1996: PRI&#x27;s &quot;The World&quot; premieres&quot;,&quot; presenting issues and events &quot;through a global lens&quot; to American audiences. Co-produced by PRI with BBC World Service and WGBH Radio Boston, it was the first daily news co-production ever undertaken by the BBC.

In 2001: &quot;PRI’s Studio 360&quot; launches.

In September, PRI and &quot;Symphony Space&quot; of New York City announced that PRI would become the national distribution partner of &quot;Selected Shorts&quot;, which had previously been distributed by National Public Radio.

In January 2008, PRI and WNYC announced that the name of their new morning drive news program is &quot;The Takeaway&quot; with John Hockenberry and Adaora Udoji. This program&#x27;s editorial partners include The BBC World Service, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and WGBH Radio Boston. The program successfully launched April 28, and full national launch was expected June/July 2008.

On May 1, 2008, PRI was the first major public media outlet to use digital cinema; and one of the first mass media companies overall. PRI conceived and spearheaded &quot;This American Life Live!&quot; in partnership with Ira Glass and WBEZ Chicago. &quot;This American Life Live!&quot; was presented exclusively in select theatres by National CineMedia&#x27;s (NCM) Fathom, in partnership with BY Experience and Chicago Public Radio, and in association with Public Radio International.

In 2012: PRI is acquired by WGBH.

On March 21, 2014, the company announced the agreement to distribute &quot;This American Life&quot; would end July 1, 2014.

In 2017: PRI launches its Engagement Lab.

== Relationship with NPR ==
Public radio is a generic term for non-commercial radio stations or programming that are covered under the Public Broadcasting Act. Public radio organizations receive funding from corporate sponsors, public (e.g., Corporation for Public Broadcasting) and private foundation grants as well as donations and gifts from individuals. The mix of revenue differs by station, network and/or producer. PRI, NPR and American Public Media are the largest providers of public radio programming in the United States. They compete with each other for slots on public radio stations and the attention of listeners. Each has distinct missions and emphases in programming—PRI is focused on global journalism, providing diverse voices, and arts and cultural perspectives. Any given public radio station may be simultaneously both an NPR member and an affiliate of PRI and APM. PRI is a not-for-profit organization that has an independent governing board with an independent board of directors. NPR is a membership organization; its board is composed of public radio stations which run for seats on the board.

PRI was a younger organization than NPR, and focused on pushing the sound of public radio forward through innovative programming strategies and leading media in its areas of focus—global news and cultural perspectives. (NPR was founded in 1970 and PRI in 1983.) Many PRI shows drew a younger overall audience than shows produced by NPR. PRI&#x27;s stated purpose was to offer a wider range of voices than NPR programs.

In recent years, numerous programs have changed distributors. Some programs that were formerly distributed by PRI, such as &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot;, &quot;Marketplace&quot;, and &quot;American Routes&quot;, along with the BBC World Service, are now distributed by American Public Media. APM was formed by Minnesota Public Radio to distribute programs it owned and produced, thereby moving distribution from PRI to APM.

In addition, PRI distributed &quot;World Cafe&quot; for many years. However, in 2005, the show&#x27;s distribution was switched to NPR. At the same time, PRI has also picked up the distribution of programs originally distributed by NPR, including &quot;Michael Feldman&#x27;s Whad&#x27;Ya Know?&quot;, and, in 2006, &quot;Living on Earth&quot;—public radio&#x27;s leading news and information program focused on the environment. In September 2007, PRI became the national distributor of &quot;Selected Shorts&quot;, which was previously distributed by NPR.

In January 2014, PRI became the national distributor of &quot;Science Friday&quot;, also previously distributed by NPR. On April 11, 2018, distribution of the show changed hands once more when it went from PRI to WNYC Studios.

<text>The Kingdom of Thessalonica () was a short-lived Crusader State founded after the Fourth Crusade over conquered Byzantine lands in today&#x27;s territory of Northern Greece and Thessaly.

==History==

=== Background ===

After the fall of Constantinople to the crusaders in 1204, Boniface of Montferrat, the leader of the crusade, was expected by both the Crusaders and the defeated Byzantines to become the new emperor. However, the Venetians felt that Boniface was too closely tied to the Byzantine Empire, as his brother Conrad had married into the Byzantine imperial family. The Venetians wanted an emperor whom they could control more easily, and with their influence, Baldwin of Flanders was elected as emperor of the new Latin Empire.

=== Establishment ===

Boniface reluctantly accepted this, and set out to conquer Thessalonica, the second-largest Byzantine city after Constantinople. At first he had to compete with Emperor Baldwin, who also wanted the city. He then went on to capture the city later in 1204 and set up a kingdom there, subordinate to Baldwin, although the title of &quot;king&quot; was never officially used. Late 13th and 14th century sources suggest that Boniface based his claim to Thessalonica on the statement that his younger brother Renier had been granted Thessalonica on his marriage to Maria Komnene in 1180.

In 1204–05, Boniface was able to extend his rule south into Greece, advancing through Thessaly, Boeotia, Euboea, and Attica. The boundaries of the actual Kingdom of Thessalonica seem to have extended only up to Domokos, Pharsalus, and Velestino: southern Thessaly, with the towns of Zetounion and Ravennika, was under governors appointed by the Latin Emperor, and the principalities of southern Greece were only Boniface&#x27;s feudal vassals. Emperor Henry of Flanders&#x27; expedition against the rebellious Lombard barons of Thessalonica in 1208–09, however, ended the feudal dependency of the southern principalities—the Duchy of Athens, the Marquisate of Bodonitsa, the Lordship of Salona, and the Triarchy of Negroponte—on Thessalonica, replacing it with direct imperial suzerainty.

=== The Lombard Rebellion ===

Boniface&#x27;s rule lasted less than two years before he was ambushed by Tsar Kaloyan of Bulgaria and killed on September 4, 1207. The kingdom passed to Boniface&#x27;s son Demetrius, who was still a baby, so actual power was held by various minor nobles of Lombard origin. These nobles, under the regent Oberto, began plotting to place William VI of Montferrat, Boniface&#x27;s elder son, on the throne, and openly defied the Latin Emperor Henry of Flanders. Henry marched against them in 1209 and forced their submission. As a result, Henry&#x27;s brother Eustace then became regent for Demetrius.

=== War with Epirus and fall ===

Taking advantage of this situation, Michael I of Epirus, a former ally of Boniface, attacked the kingdom in 1210, as did the Bulgarians. Henry of Flanders eventually defeated both, but after Michael&#x27;s death in 1214, his brother and successor Theodore began anew the assault on the kingdom. Over the next nine years Theodore gradually conquered all of Thessalonica except the city itself, as the Latin Empire could spare no army to defend it while they were busy fighting the Byzantine Empire of Nicaea in Asia. In 1224, just as Demetrius had become old enough to take power for himself, Theodore finally captured Thessalonica and the kingdom became part of the Despotate of Epirus.

=== Titular claimants ===

The kingdom was claimed by titular kings of the house of Montferrat until 1284 and also by the dukes of Burgundy; Baldwin II of Constantinople had promised the title to Hugh IV should he regain the Latin Empire.

<text>Captain Donald MacDonald (c. 1724–1760) was a military officer who fought for France, for Charles Edward Stuart in Scotland, and later for Great Britain in Quebec.

==Life==
MacDonald (sometimes spelt MacDonell) was the second son of Ranald MacDonald, 18th Chief of Clanranald. When still young he was sent to France where he received a commission in the Royal-Ecossais Regiment of the French army. In 1745 he was sent by King Louis XV to assist Charles Edward Stuart in the Jacobite rising. MacDonald was wounded at the siege of Stirling Castle and imprisoned after the surrender of the Jacobite forces. As a French officer he was released from imprisonment and returned to France.

MacDonald took advantage of the amnesty which was granted by Britain to Jacobite officers, and on 12 January 1757 was gazetted a captain in the regiment raised by Simon Fraser, the 78th Fraser Highlanders. In 1758 MacDonald sailed to Louisbourg which was then under siege as part of the Seven Years&#x27; War. He was wounded there on the night of 21 July.

MacDonald participated in the subsequent siege of Quebec. On the night of 13 September 1759 he was part of the forlorn hope, the twenty-four volunteers leading the British attempt to climb the cliffs rising above the St. Lawrence River. It was MacDonald who responded in French to the challenge of the French guards, buying time for enough men to gather and overpower the post. This in turn allowed almost 5,000 British troops to climb the cliffs and mass on the Plains of Abraham. During the subsequent winter, MacDonald was given several independent commands, constantly harassing the French outposts surrounding Quebec.

At the Battle of Sainte-Foy, 28 April 1760, MacDonald commanded a company of volunteers on the left flank of the British army and was killed in the action.

There is significant evidence that MacDonald was a harsh officer disliked by his own men as well as by his opponents. He received the nickname &quot;Dòmhnaill Goran&quot; (Donald the Sinister). There is some indication that his wounding at Louisbourg may have been an attempted &quot;fragging&quot; by his own men. When he was killed at Sillery, his body was hacked to pieces.

<doc id="309812" wikidata="Q235089" url="?curid=309812" title="Stanford prison experiment">
<text>The Stanford prison experiment (SPE) was a controversial psychological experiment performed during August 1971. It was designed to be a two-week simulation of a prison environment that examined the effects of situational variables on participants&#x27; reactions and behaviors. Stanford University psychology professor Philip Zimbardo managed the research team who administered the study. Zimbardo ended the experiment early after realizing the guards&#x27; abuse of the prisoners had gone too far. 

Participants were recruited from the local community through an advertisement in the newspapers offering $15 per day ($116.18 in 2025) to male students who wanted to participate with a &quot;psychological study of prison life&quot;. Participants were chosen after assessments of psychological stability and then assigned randomly to being prisoners or prison guards. Critics have questioned the validity of these methods.

Those volunteers selected to be &quot;guards&quot; were given uniforms designed specifically to de-individuate them, and they were instructed to prevent prisoners from escaping. The experiment started officially when &quot;prisoners&quot; were arrested by real police of Palo Alto. During the next five days, psychological abuse of the prisoners by the &quot;guards&quot; became increasingly brutal. After psychologist Christina Maslach visited to evaluate the conditions, she was troubled to see how study participants were behaving and she confronted Zimbardo. He ended the experiment on the sixth day.

The experiment has been referenced and critiqued as an example of an unethical psychology experiment, and the harm inflicted on the participants in this and other experiments during the post-World War II era prompted American universities to improve their ethical requirements and institutional review for human experiment subjects in order to prevent them from being similarly harmed. Other researchers have found it difficult to reproduce the study, especially given those constraints.

Certain critics have described the study as unscientific and fraudulent. In particular, Thibault Le Texier has established that the guards were asked directly to behave in certain ways in order to confirm Zimbardo&#x27;s conclusions, which were largely written in advance of the experiment. Zimbardo claimed that Le Texier&#x27;s article was mostly &quot;ad hominem&quot; and ignored available data that contradicts his counterarguments, but the original participants interviewed for the National Geographic documentary &quot;The Stanford Prison Experiment: Unlocking the Truth&quot; have largely confirmed many of Le Texier&#x27;s claims.

== Funding and methodology==
The official website of the SPE describes the experiment goal as follows:

A 1996 article from the Stanford News Service described the experiment goal in a more detailed way:

The study was funded by the US Office of Naval Research to understand antisocial behavior. The United States Navy and the United States Marine Corps wanted to investigate conflict between military guards and prisoners.

Criticism of the SPE still continues today. Many researchers have critiqued Zimbardo&#x27;s Stanford Prison Experiment for its method, whether it meets the criteria to be a scientific experiment, and whether the guard orientation created a demand bias.

== Publishing ==
Before publishing in American Psychologist and other peer-reviewed journals, the researchers reported the findings in &quot;Naval Research Reviews&quot;, &quot;International Journal of Criminology and Penology&quot; (IJCP), and the &quot;New York Times Magazine&quot;. David Amodio, psychology instructor at both New York University and the University of Amsterdam, dismissed Zimbardo&#x27;s study, stating that releasing the article to an &quot;obscure journal&quot; demonstrated that Zimbardo was unable to convince fellow psychologists of the validity and reliability of his study. This action by Zimbardo violated the tradition of scientific dissemination by publishing in other journals before publishing in a scientific peer-reviewed journal.

Zimbardo has stated that the grant agreement with the Office of Naval Research included a requirement to publish data in their journal, &quot;Naval Research Reviews&quot;. He states that the &quot;International Journal of Criminology and Penology&quot; invited Zimbardo to write about his study in their journal, and he then wrote an article with the &quot;New York Times Magazine&quot; to share the findings with a broad audience. He states that the article still needed to pass through the very strict requirements of the American Psychologist, the official journal of the American Psychological Association, in order to be published. After publishing the article in the American Psychologist, the findings were also reported in other peer-reviewed journals and books.

==Preparation==
===Recruitment and selection===
After Zimbardo received approval from the university to perform the experiment, study participants were recruited using an advertisement in the &quot;help wanted&quot; section of the &quot;Palo Alto Times&quot; and &quot;The Stanford Daily&quot; newspapers in August 1971:

75 men applied, and, after screening assessments and interviews, 24 were selected to participate in a two-week prison simulation. The applicants were predominantly white, middle-class, and appeared to be stable psychologically and healthy. The group of subjects was selected intentionally to exclude those with criminal backgrounds, psychological impairments, or medical problems.

On a random basis, half of the subjects were assigned the role of guard (nine plus three potential substitutes), and half were assigned to the role of prisoner (also nine plus three potential substitutes). They agreed to participate for a 7- to 14-day period for $15 per day (roughly equivalent to $116.18 ).

=== Prison environment ===
The day before the experiment began, small mock prison cells were arranged to hold three prisoners each. There was a small corridor for the prison yard, a closet for solitary confinement, and a bigger room across from the prisoners for the guards and warden.

The experiment was performed in a section of the basement of Jordan Hall, Stanford&#x27;s psychology building. The prison had two fabricated walls: one at the entrance and one at the cell wall to block observation. Each cell () was unlit, was intended to house 3 prisoners and had a cot (with mattress, sheet, and pillow) for each prisoner. Prisoners were confined and were to stay in their cells and the yard all day and night until the study was finished. In contrast, the guards were to stay in a different environment, separate from the prisoners. The guards were given access to special areas for rest and relaxation, were told to work in teams of three for eight-hour shifts, and were not required to stay on-site after their shift.

=== Roles ===
Zimbardo assumed the role of Superintendent, and an undergraduate research assistant, David Jaffe, assumed the role of Warden.

Digitized recordings available on the official SPE website were widely discussed in 2017, particularly one where warden David Jaffe tried to influence the behavior of one of the guards by encouraging him to participate more and be more &quot;tough&quot; for the benefit of the experiment.

==== Orientation ====
The researchers had an orientation session for the guards the day before the experiment began, during which the guards were instructed not to harm the prisoners physically or withhold food or drink, but to maintain law and order. The researchers provided the guards with wooden batons to establish their status, deindividuating clothing similar to that of an actual prison guard (khaki shirt and pants from a local military surplus store), and mirrored sunglasses to prevent eye contact and create anonymity.

Based on recordings from the experiment, guards were instructed by the researchers to refer to prisoners by number rather than by name. This, according to Zimbardo, was intended to diminish the prisoners&#x27; individuality. With no control, prisoners learned they had little effect on what happened to them, ultimately causing them to stop responding and give up.

Zimbardo has explained that guard orientations in the prison system instructed the guards to exert power over the prisoners. Further, Zimbardo asserts that his fellow researcher explicitly instructed the guards not to inflict physical harm on the prisoners, but at the same time make the prisoners feel that they were in an actual prison.

== Critiques of scientific validity ==
In 1975, Ali Banuazizi and Siamak Movahedi argued that the behavior of the participants in the SPE was a result of demand characteristics and not the prison environment, that there is no single definition of prisoner behavior, and that participants were simply acting in the role in which they had been cast. Participants&#x27; behavior may have also been influenced by knowing that they were watched (Hawthorne effect). Instead of being restrained by fear of an observer, guards may have behaved more aggressively when supervisors observing them did not restrain them. The study was also criticized for demand characteristics in 2012 by psychologist Peter Gray, who argued that participants in psychological experiments are more likely to do what they believe the researchers want them to do, and specifically in the case of the SPE, &quot;to act out their stereotyped views of what prisoners and guards do.&quot;

In 2008, Thomas Carnahan and Sam McFarland argued that the experiment suffers from selection bias, as the recruiting posters for SPE specifically advertised participation in a study about prison life. Carnahan and McFarland argued that those who applied to participate with the SPE thus likely already had traits associated with abusiveness. Aggression, authoritarianism, Machiavellianism, social dominance orientation, and narcissism would be high in those who volunteered for a prison experiment. Further, low dispositional empathy and altruism would also be indicators of someone who would volunteer.

In 2018 Thibault Le Texier, a French researcher, in his book, (&quot;The History of a Lie&quot;), questions the scientific validity and merit of the SPE. He further discussed his critiques in an article published by the APA in 2019. Le Texier asserts his arguments using testimonies of those participants who were assigned as guards. In his opinion, the sadism and submission displayed in the SPE was directly caused by Zimbardo&#x27;s instructions to the guards and the guards&#x27; desire to please the researchers. In particular, he has established that the guards were asked directly to behave in certain ways in order to confirm Zimbardo&#x27;s conclusions, which were largely written in advance of the experiment. Zimbardo and colleagues contend that Le Texier&#x27;s critiques were mostly ad hominem and ignored available data that contradicts his counterarguments.

In 2020, Dutch historian Rutger Bregman claimed the experiment to be dubious. He states that the guards were urged to act aggressively towards the prisoners. In his book &quot;&quot;, he is of the opinion that in similar experiments researchers set up the experiments to create hostility between groups and then interpret the finding to suit their needs.

Participant guard David Eshelman acknowledged that his theater background lent itself well to his role as guard, that he purposely thought of new ways to demean the prisoners – on one shift, Eshelman instructed the prisoners to simulate sodomy. Zimbardo has responded to this argument by stating that other guards acted similarly or engaged with Eshelman in the treatment of prisoners. While it is possible that one guard adopted his behavior from a movie (Eshelman identified with the warden in &quot;Cool Hand Luke&quot;), others did not. Also, guards on a different shift than Eshelman, exacted similar acts of emotional and mental brutality. Zimbardo further argues that the behaviors of the participant guards were not unlike those of real-world prison atrocities or the actions taken by American soldiers in the Abu Ghraib prison. Most of the guards have stated since the SPE that they were intentionally acting.

The BBC prison study has indicated the importance of direction, of the form displayed by Zimbardo when briefing guards in the Stanford experiment, in the emergence of tyranny.

=== Carlo Prescott as a prison consultant ===

In 2005, an article was published by Carlo Prescott in &quot;The Stanford Daily&quot;, explaining that the antagonistic tactics used by the guards were ones that he experienced during his time spent in San Quentin. He shared each one in detail with the researchers prior to the experiment. In Prescott&#x27;s opinion, the participants with the experiment, having no experience as a prison guard, could not have acted in the ways they did unless they had been told of the explicit details of the actions they took.

Zimbardo has stated that he believed that the article was not written by Prescott, but rather by the screenwriter and producer, Michael Lazarou, who had attempted unsuccessfully to get the movie rights to the story of the SPE. In Zimbardo&#x27;s opinion, Prescott would not have written in such a legalistic way, and Zimbardo claims that, in telephone records and emails obtained by Brett Emory, the SPE movie&#x27;s producer asserted Prescott was not the author.

== Events ==

=== Saturday, August 14: Set up ===
The small mock prison cells were set up, and the participants who had been assigned a guard role attended an orientation where they were briefed and given uniforms.

===Sunday, August 15: Day 1===
The participants who had been assigned a prisoner role were mock-arrested by the local Palo Alto police at their homes or assigned sites. The participants were intentionally not informed that they would be arrested, as the researchers wanted it to come as a surprise. This was a breach of the ethics of Zimbardo&#x27;s own contract that all of the participants had signed. The arrest involved charging them with armed robbery and burglary, Penal Codes 211 and 459 respectively. The Palo Alto police department assisted Zimbardo&#x27;s team with the simulated arrests and performed full booking procedures on the prisoners at the Palo Alto City police headquarters, which included warning of Miranda rights, fingerprinting and taking mug shots. All of these actions were video-documented by a local San Francisco television station reporter using Zimbardo&#x27;s car. Meanwhile, three guards prepared for the arrival of the inmates. The prisoners were then transported to the mock prison from the police station, sirens wailing. In the &quot;Stanford County Jail&quot; they were systematically strip searched and given their new identities (Inmate identification number) and uniform.

Prisoners wore uncomfortable, ill-fitting smocks without any underwear and stocking caps, as well as a chain around one ankle. Guards were instructed to call prisoners by their assigned numbers, sewn on their uniforms, instead of by name, thereby dehumanizing prisoners. The prisoners were then greeted by the warden, who conveyed the seriousness of their offence and their new status as prisoners. With the rules of the prison presented to them, the inmates retired to their cells for the rest of the first day of the experiment.

===Monday, August 16: Day 2===
Guards referred to prisoners by their identification numbers and confined them to their small cells. At 2:30 am the prisoners rebelled against guards&#x27; wake up calls of whistles and clanging of batons. Prisoners refused to leave their cells to eat in the yard, ripped off their inmate number tags, took off their stocking caps and insulted the guards.
In response, guards sprayed fire extinguishers at the prisoners to reassert control. The three back-up guards were called in to help regain control of the prison. Guards removed all of the prisoners&#x27; clothes, removed mattresses and sentenced the main instigators to time in the special detention unit. They attempted to dissuade any further rebellion using psychological warfare. One of the guards said to the other that, &quot;these are dangerous prisoners&quot;.

=== Tuesday, August 17: Day 3 ===
In order to restrict further acts of disobedience, the guards separated and rewarded prisoners who had minor roles in the rebellion. The three spent time in the &quot;good&quot; cell where they received clothing, beds, and food denied to the rest of the jail population. After an estimated 12 hours, the three returned to their old cells that lacked beds.

Guards were allowed to abuse their power to humiliate the inmates. They had the prisoners count off and do pushups arbitrarily, restricted access to the bathrooms, and forced them to relieve themselves in a bucket in their cells.

==== Prisoner 8612 ====
The first prisoner to leave the experiment was Douglas Korpi, prisoner 8612. After 36 hours, he had an apparent mental breakdown in which he yelled, &quot;Jesus Christ, I&#x27;m burning up inside&quot; and &quot;I can&#x27;t stand another night! I just can&#x27;t take it anymore!&quot; Upon seeing his suffering, research assistant Craig Haney released Korpi.

In 1992, in a documentary movie about the study, &quot;Quiet Rage&quot;, Korpi asserted that the prison experiment had deeply affected him, and that experience caused him to later become a prison psychologist. However, in a 2017 interview, Korpi stated that his breakdown had been fake, and that he did it only so that he could leave and return to studying for his Graduate Record Exam; he had originally thought that he could study while &quot;imprisoned&quot;, but the &quot;prison staff&quot; would not allow him. Korpi expressed regret that he had not filed a false imprisonment charge at the time.

Zimbardo responded to this criticism in 2018. First, while this experiment has been criticized overall for its ethics, Zimbardo stated that he needed to treat the breakdown as real and release the prisoner. Further, Zimbardo believes Korpi&#x27;s 2017 interview was a lie.

===Wednesday, August 18: Day 4===
Witnessing that guards divide prisoners based on their good or rebellious behavior, the inmates started to distance themselves from one another. Rioters believed that other prisoners were snitches and vice versa. Other prisoners considered the rebels as a threat to the status quo since they wanted to have their sleeping cots and clothes again.

&quot;Prisoner 819&quot; began showing symptoms of distress: he began crying in his cell. A priest was brought in to speak with him, but the young man refused to talk with him and instead asked for a medical doctor. After hearing him cry, Zimbardo reassured him of his actual identity and removed the prisoner. When &quot;Prisoner 819&quot; was leaving, the guards cajoled the remaining inmates to loudly and repeatedly decry that &quot;819 did a bad thing&quot;.

===Thursday, August 19: Day 5===
The day was scheduled for visitations by friends and family of the inmates in order to simulate the prison experience.

Zimbardo and the guards made visitors wait for long periods of time to see their loved ones. Only two visitors could see any one prisoner and only for just ten minutes while a guard watched. Parents grew concerned about their sons&#x27; well-being and whether they had enough to eat. Some parents left with plans to contact lawyers to gain early release of their children.

On the same day, Zimbardo&#x27;s colleague Gordon H. Bower arrived to check on the experiment and questioned Zimbardo about what the independent variable of the research was. Christina Maslach also visited the prison that night and was distressed after observing the guards abusing the prisoners, forcing them to wear bags over their heads. She challenged Zimbardo about his lack of caring oversight and the immorality of the study. Finally, she made evident that Zimbardo had been changed by his role as Superintendent into someone she did not recognize and did not like. Her direct challenge, as well as the shared opinion from others, such as Curtis Banks (researcher), prompted Zimbardo to end the SPE the next day.

=== Friday, August 20: Day 6 ===
Due to Maslach&#x27;s objections, the parents&#x27; concerns, and the increasing brutality exhibited by guards in the experiment, Zimbardo ended the study on day 6. Zimbardo gathered the participants (guards, prisoners, and researchers) to let them know that the experiment was over, and he arranged to pay them for the six days the experiment lasted. Zimbardo then met for several hours of informed debriefing first with all of the prisoners, then the guards, and finally everyone came together to share their experiences. Next, all participants were asked to complete a personal retrospective to be mailed to him subsequently. Finally, all participants were invited to return a week later to share their opinions and emotions.

Later, the physical components of the Stanford County Jail were taken down and out of the basement of Jordan Hall as the cells returned to their usual function as graduate student offices. Zimbardo and his graduate student research team, Craig Haney and Curtis Banks, began compiling the multiple sources of data that would be the basis for several articles they soon wrote, both about their experiment and for Zimbardo&#x27;s later expanded and detailed review of the SPE in &quot;The Lucifer Effect&quot; (2007).

== Interpretation and reproducibility of results ==

According to Zimbardo&#x27;s interpretation of the SPE, it demonstrated that the simulated-prison situation, rather than individual personality traits, caused the participants&#x27; behavior. Using this situational attribution, the results are compatible with those of the Milgram experiment, where participants complied with orders to administer seemingly dangerous and potentially lethal electric shocks to a shill. Others have posited that the guards assumed aggressive roles due to encouragement from researchers rather than conforming to the situation.

Conclusions and observations drawn by the experimenters were largely subjective and anecdotal, and the experiment is practically impossible for other researchers to reproduce accurately. In 1973, Erich Fromm argued, as only a third of the guards displayed sadistic behaviors, SPE is more accurately an example of how a situation cannot influence a person&#x27;s behavior. He states that there were generalizations in the experiment&#x27;s results and argued that the personality of an individual does affect behavior when imprisoned. This ran counter to the study&#x27;s conclusion that the prison situation itself controls the individual&#x27;s behavior. Fromm also argued that the methods employed to screen participants could not determine the amount of sadism in the subjects.

The experiment has also been used to illustrate cognitive dissonance theory and the power of authority.

=== BBC prison study ===
Psychologists Alex Haslam and Steve Reicher conducted the BBC Prison Study in 2002 to examine Zimbardo&#x27;s themes of tyranny and resistance, and they published the results in 2006. It was a partial replication of the SPE performed with the assistance of the BBC, which broadcast a documentary series about the SPE called &quot;The Experiment&quot;.

As in the SPE, there was a makeshift prison, and all participants were male. Unlike the SPE&#x27;s invitation to participate, Haslam and Reicher advertised their study as a university-backed social science experiment to be shown by television. Guards were not instructed on how to behave, only to figure out how to manage a prison. Those selected as prisoners were instructed to daily complete a questionnaire. Both prisoners and guards in this study wore microphones on their shirts, and cameras followed all participants&#x27; actions.

Their results and conclusions differed from Zimbardo&#x27;s and resulted in a number of publications concerning tyranny, stress, and leadership. The results were published in major academic journals such as &quot;British Journal of Social Psychology&quot;, &quot;Journal of Applied Psychology&quot;, &quot;Social Psychology Quarterly&quot;, and &quot;Personality and Social Psychology Review&quot;. The BBC Prison Study has now been taught as a core study on the UK A-level Psychology OCR syllabus.

While Haslam and Reicher&#x27;s procedure was not a direct replication of Zimbardo&#x27;s, their study casts further doubt on the generality of his conclusions. Specifically, it questions the notion that people slip mindlessly into roles. Their research also indicates to the importance of leadership in the emergence of tyranny of the type displayed by Zimbardo when briefing guards in the Stanford experiment.

Zimbardo initially regarded Haslam and Reicher&#x27;s study as a reality show as both prisoner and guard knew they were being televised and probably over-acted in their role for the purpose of entertaining watchers of the documentary. He felt that there were definite similarities to reality shows: prisoners had a confessional to describe their feelings, and there were contests for the prisoners. Despite its dissimilarities, Zimbardo believes the results of the BBC study replicated his own in that the participants were affected by the situation. In 2018, Zimbardo, Reicher, and Haslam issued a joint statement asserting that both experiments were valid. They also agreed that behaviors observed in all participants could have been caused by more than the situation. They urged people to continue research into toxic behaviors, arguing that their studies were unique and need replications to demonstrate reliability and significance.

== Legacy ==
One positive result of the study is that it has altered the way US prisons are managed. For example, juveniles accused of federal crimes are no longer housed before trial with adult prisoners, due to the risk of violence against them.

Zimbardo submitted a statement to the 1971 US House Committee on the Judiciary about the experiment&#x27;s findings.

=== Comparisons to Abu Ghraib ===
When acts of prisoner torture and abuse at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq were publicized in March 2004, Zimbardo was struck by the similarity with his own experiment. He was dismayed by official military and government representatives shifting the blame for the torture and abuses in the Abu Ghraib American military prison onto &quot;a few bad apples&quot;, rather than acknowledging the possibly systemic problems of a formally established military incarceration system. Zimbardo was then quoted saying &quot;I argue that we all have the capacity for love and evil—to be Mother Theresa, to be Hitler or Saddam Hussein. It&#x27;s the situation that brings that out&quot;.

Eventually, Zimbardo became involved with the defense team of lawyers representing one of the Abu Ghraib prison guards, Staff Sergeant Ivan &quot;Chip&quot; Frederick. Zimbardo was granted full access to all investigation and background reports, and he testified as an expert witness in Frederick&#x27;s court martial. The trial resulted in an eight-year prison sentence for Frederick in 2004.

Zimbardo drew from his participation in the Frederick case to write the book &quot;The Lucifer Effect: Understanding How Good People Turn Evil&quot;, which deals with the similarities between his own Stanford prison experiment and the Abu Ghraib abuses.

=== In popular culture ===
Italian moviemaker Carlo Tuzii was the first director to film a story based on the experiment when, in 1977, he directed the television movie (&#x27;The cage&#x27;), for Rai 1. Tuzii&#x27;s original story called for a group of twenty young people from various social backgrounds, who were divided randomly into &quot;guards&quot; and &quot;prisoners&quot; and instructed to spend one month on opposite sides of an enormously high gate, with barbed wire on top, built in the middle of a large park. Before principal photography started, however, some concerns from RAI executives forced Tuzii and the screenwriters to alter the script into a very similar story to the actual Stanford experiment, including the outcome. Miguel Bosé featured as prisoner Carlo; progressive pop music band Pooh scored the movie and had a hit in Italy with a 7-inch edit of the theme tune.

The 2001 German-language movie &quot;Das Experiment&quot; featuring Moritz Bleibtreu is based on the experiment. It was remade in 2010 in English as &quot;The Experiment&quot; and was directed by Paul T. Scheuring and starred Adrien Brody, Forest Whitaker, Cam Gigandet, Clifton Collins, Jr., and Maggie Grace.

The 2015 movie &quot;The Stanford Prison Experiment&quot; is based on the experiment.

The YouTube series &quot;Mind Field&quot;, hosted by Michael Stevens, features an episode discussing the experiment.

In Season 3, Episode 2 of the television series &quot;Veronica Mars&quot;, entitled &quot;My Big Fat Greek Rush Week&quot;, a similar experiment is featured.

In &quot;The Overstory&quot; by Richard Powers, the fictional character Douglas Pavlicek is a prisoner in the experiment, an experience which influences later decisions.

In Season 15, Episode 10 of television show &quot;American Dad&quot;, &quot;American Data&quot;, Roger recruits Steve, Toshi, Snot and Barry into a similar experiment.

In Volume 10, Chapter 92 of Prison School, Kate Takenomiya makes reference to and implements a similar scheme to the school&#x27;s prison

In 2024, Disney released a National Geographic three episode documentary series &quot;The Stanford Prison Experiment: Unlocking the Truth&quot; with first hand accounts of the original participants in the study.

== Ethical concerns ==
Some of the guards&#x27; behavior allegedly resulted in dangerous and psychologically damaging situations. Ethical concerns about the experiment often draw comparisons to the Milgram experiment, performed ten years earlier in 1961 at Yale University, where Stanley Milgram studied obedience to authority. With the treatment that the guards were giving to the prisoners, the guards would become so absorbed into their role as a guard that they would emotionally, physically and mentally humiliate the prisoners:

The experiment was perceived by many to involve questionable ethics, the most serious concern being that it was continued even after participants expressed their desire to withdraw. Despite the fact that participants were told they had the right to leave at any time, the researchers did not allow this. Although there was only limited ethical oversight at the time, some aspects of the study were in contradiction of the contract that was signed with participants.

Since the time of the SPE, ethical guidelines for experiments involving human subjects have become more strict. The Stanford prison experiment resulted in the implementation of rules to preclude any harmful treatment of participants. Before they are implemented, human studies must now be reviewed by an institutional review board (US) or ethics committee (UK) and found to be in accordance with ethical guidelines set by the American Psychological Association or British Psychological Society. These guidelines involve the consideration of whether the potential benefit to science outweighs the possible risk for physical and psychological harm.

A post-experimental debriefing is now considered an important ethical consideration to ensure that participants are not harmed in any way by their experience in an experiment. Though the researchers did perform debriefing sessions, they were several years after the SPE. By that time, numerous details were forgotten; nonetheless, Zimbardo has concluded from his follow-up research that participants experienced no lasting negative effects. The American Psychological Association specifies that the debriefing process should occur as soon as possible to assess any psychological harm that may have been done and to rehabilitate participants if necessary. If there is an unavoidable delay in debriefing, the researcher is obligated to take measures to minimize harm.

== Similar studies ==
In 1967, The Third Wave experiment involved the use of authoritarian dynamics similar to Nazi Party methods of mass control in a classroom setting by high school teacher Ron Jones in Palo Alto, California with the goal of demonstrating vividly to the class how the German public in World War II could have acted in the way it did. Although the veracity of Jones&#x27; accounts has been questioned, several participants with the study have gone on record to confirm the events.

In both experiments, participants found it difficult to leave the study due to the roles they were assigned. Both studies examine human nature and the effects of authority. Personalities of the subjects were thought to have little influence on both experiments despite the test before the prison experiment.

Both the Milgram and Zimbardo studies concluded that participants conform to social pressures. Conformity is strengthened by allowing some participants to feel more or less powerful than others. In both experiments, the people&#x27;s behaviors altered to match the group stereotypes, demonstrating a tendency to conform to others passively, even if a particular subject is malevolent.

A 2007 study on prison-life examined the potential relationship between participant self-selection and the disposition toward aggressive behaviors. They found that when responding to an advertisement, participants &quot;were significantly higher on measures of aggressiveness, authoritarianism, Machiavellianism, narcissism, and social dominance than those who responded to a parallel ad that omitted the words &#x27;of prison life,&#x27; and they were significantly lower in dispositional empathy and altruism&quot;.

<doc id="309817" wikidata="Q755468" url="?curid=309817" title="Pretenders (album)">
<text>Pretenders is the debut studio album by British-American band The Pretenders, released in January 1980. A combination of rock and roll, punk and new wave music, this album made the band famous. The album features the singles &quot;Stop Your Sobbing&quot;, &quot;Kid&quot; and &quot;Brass in Pocket&quot;.

Nick Lowe produced the Pretenders&#x27; first single, &quot;Stop Your Sobbing&quot;, but decided not to work with them again as he thought the band was &quot;not going anywhere&quot;. Chris Thomas took over on the subsequent recording sessions.

==Release==
&quot;Pretenders&quot; debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart in the week of its release and stayed there for four consecutive weeks. It also made the top 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and was certified platinum during 1982 by the RIAA.

&quot;Pretenders&quot; was remastered and re-released in 2006 and included a bonus disc of demos, B-sides and live cuts, many previously unreleased. &quot;Cuban Slide&quot; and &quot;Porcelain&quot; originally appeared as B-sides to &quot;Talk of the Town&quot; and &quot;Message of Love&quot;, while &quot;Swinging London&quot; and &quot;Nervous But Shy&quot; both appeared on the flip side of &quot;Brass in Pocket&quot;. The Regents Park demo of &quot;Stop Your Sobbing&quot; was included initially as a flexi-single in the May 1981 edition of &quot;Flexipop&quot; magazine. The tracks &quot;Message of Love&quot;, &quot;Talk of the Town&quot;, &quot;Porcelain&quot; and &quot;Cuban Slide&quot; alongside a live version of the album&#x27;s opening track, &quot;Precious&quot;, were released on a follow-up EP entitled &quot;Extended Play&quot; soon after.

&quot;Pretenders&quot; was also reissued in 2009 by Audio Fidelity as a limited-edition audiophile gold CD, using the original master tapes. However, this remaster suffered from unauthorized, heavy limiting supposedly applied &quot;after&quot; engineer Steve Hoffman&#x27;s digital master was created and approved for CD manufacturing. The song &quot;The Phone Call&quot; is missing some of the telephone effects on this release because the effects were &quot;flown in&quot; after the master was completed for the song and, as a result, were not on the original master tape. There were no bonus tracks included.

A shortened version of &quot;Tequila&quot; would be performed nearly 15 years later on the &quot;Last of the Independents&quot;. &quot;Sabre Dance&quot; features Chrissie Hynde singing portions of &quot;Stop Your Sobbing&quot; over solos by James Honeyman-Scott.

A cover version of &quot;Brass in Pocket&quot; and the master version of &quot;Precious&quot; were released as downloadable content for &quot;Rock Band&quot;.

Another deluxe edition of the album, curated by Hynde, was released on 5 November 2021 and features the original album remastered by Chris Thomas, alongside demos, rarities, and many live performances. These include BBC sessions on &quot;The Kid Jensen Show&quot;, and performances at The Paris Theatre in London and Paradise Theater in Boston.

==Critical reception==
Contemporary reviews for the album were mixed. In &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, Chris Brazier called the record &quot;the first important album&quot; of the 1980s, and while the second side of the album was better than the first side, overall &quot;the album is irresistible&quot;. However, Tony Stewart of &quot;NME&quot; criticised &quot;Melody Maker&quot; for hyping the band, and said that &quot;so much about the Pretenders is reminiscent of &#x27;60s pop games that any claim they are innovative is completely invalid&quot;. Stewart noted influences from the Velvet Underground, the Beatles, the 1960s beat boom, Blondie and the Police, and while he acknowledged Hynde&#x27;s talents as a frontwoman, he dismissed the band&#x27;s playing and inability to lift the music to the level of the lyrics, stating that &quot;they seem unable to give it an edge&quot;. 

&quot;Sounds&quot;″s Robbi Millar said of the album, &quot;Its success, which should be fairly apparent through the next few months, will be valued not through hype and wildly enthusiastic pen-happy journalists but through a number of strong album tracks.&quot; Millar also noted several influences, including Sting and Public Image Ltd, and that the album included three singles and two B-sides that had already been released, but that it also included &quot;seven other worthy tracks&quot; which resulted in &quot;one fine first album&quot;.

In 1989, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;Pretenders&quot; the 20th best album of the 1980s. In 2012, &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; listed &quot;Pretenders&quot; at number 64 on its list of the best albums of the 1980s.

&quot;Pretenders&quot; has been named one of the best albums of all time by VH1 (#52). In 2003, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the album at number 155 on its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, with &quot;Pretenders&quot; maintaining the rating in the 2012 revised list, and moving up to number 152 on the 2020 revision. In 2020, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; included the band&#x27;s debut album in their &quot;80 Greatest albums of 1980&quot; list.

&quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; critic Bryan Wawzenek rated &quot;Precious&quot;, &quot;Kid&quot;, &quot;Tattooed Love Boys&quot; and &quot;Brass in Pocket&quot; as being among drummer Martin Chambers&#x27; top 10 Pretenders songs.

&quot;This is one of the most astonishing debut albums in the history of music,&quot; enthused author Michael Chabon. &quot;On songs like &#x27;Tattooed Love Boys&#x27;, you&#x27;re wondering, Who is Chrissie singing about when she says, &#x27;I shot my mouth off and you showed me what that hole was for?&#x27; That was just one of those obsessive-listening records for me.&quot; In her autobiography, Hynde confirms she is singing about herself and her own personal experience.

In 2016, the album was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

<doc id="309819" wikidata="Q1404741" url="?curid=309819" title="Feni District">
<text>Feni District () is a coastal district situated in the south-east of Bangladesh, within the Chittagong Division. One of Bangladesh&#x27;s smallest districts, it is strategically located along the Dhaka–Chittagong transportation corridor. Bordered by India to the north and the Bay of Bengal to the south, it serves as the sole entry point linking Chittagong, the country&#x27;s primary port city, to the northern districts.

The district&#x27;s population stood at 1.6 million in 2022, ranking 42nd among 64 districts and 4th least populous in Chittagong Division. Established as Bangladesh&#x27;s 61st district in 1984 with its administrative hub in Feni city, it was previously a sub-division under Noakhali District. The district comprises six upazilas (sub-districts): Sonagazi, Fulgazi, Parshuram, Daganbhuiyan, Chhagalnaiya and Feni Sadar.

Deriving its name from the Feni River, the district has a rich history spanning five millennia, having been historically part of the greater regions of Noakhali, Comilla, and Tripura. It was ruled by ancient kingdoms before coming under the Muslim rule of the Delhi Sultanate in the 14th century, and later the Mughals from the 17th century, when it briefly served as a frontier settlement with thriving cities. The British gained control in the late 18th century, formally establishing Feni as a sub-division in 1876. Significant infrastructure development, including schools, colleges, roads and railways, occurred in the early 20th century. Feni&#x27;s students played a vital role during Bangladesh&#x27;s language movement in the mid-20th century and subsequent liberation war, ultimately gaining independence from Pakistan on 6 December 1971.

== Etymology ==
While there are disagreements surrounding the matter, it is generally believed that the settlement of Feni derived its name from the river of the same name, rather than the other way around. The origin of the name &quot;Feni&quot; itself is surrounded by various local legends, complicating efforts to determine its true source. However, most legends commonly suggest that the name is connected to the word (, meaning &quot;snake&quot;).

The evolution of the word &quot;Feni&quot; or is evident in historical texts spanning several centuries. Writers and poets in the 15th and 16th centuries wrote about the area, referring to the word as both a river stream and a ghat for ferry crossing. The emergence of the word appears to be evident in the language of Muslim poets and writers, such as the 17th-century Persian book Baharistan-i-Ghaibi, where the reference to the two rivers indicates the transformation of the word into or Feni.

== History ==
=== Early history ===
The Feni region, situated in eastern Greater Noakhali (historically known as Bhulua), is believed by scholars to have an ancient history, despite its relatively recent addition to the country&#x27;s administrative landscape. Historical records indicate the presence of human settlements dating back five thousand years ago within this region.

According to folklore, this area was once home to a flourishing society that settled near the legendary seas of or , showcasing the region&#x27;s deep-rooted past. Scholars trace the arrival of Aryans to the Ganges Delta near Feni, marking a significant epoch in its history. Prehistorical discoveries in Feni dating back to the kingdom of Gangaridai further underscore Feni&#x27;s importance, suggesting it may have served as a vital frontier settlement during ancient times. Historical records point to the governance of a 7th-century dynasty as part of the Samatata region. Archaeological findings suggest the presence of the Chandra dynasty, which ruled over Samatata. Additionally, evidence indicates the possible rule of the Pala Empire in Feni, notably under King Mahipala II, after whom modern Mahipal is named. The Feni-Noakhali region was part of the ancient Pattikera Kingdom, possibly serving as a trade route connecting the kingdom with Burma (present-day Myanmar). The artificial lake called in Mahipal reflects the era of Vijaya Sena&#x27;s rule, belonging to the Sena dynasty. During the 13th century, the kingdom of Bhulua emerged, encompassing the area that comprises the present-day Noakhali region.

=== Arrival of Islam and Muslim rule ===
During the medieval era, the arrival of Sufis from Arabia and Central Asia profoundly influenced Bengal&#x27;s coastal regions. Promoting values of tolerance and love, they amalgamated Islamic teachings with local customs, shaping a distinctive cultural identity. By the onset of the Middle Ages, Muslims formed the majority in the Noakhali region, despite the absence of Muslim rule.

During the rule of Muhammad bin Tughluq, eastern Bengal came under the Delhi Sultanate&#x27;s jurisdiction. Under the governance of Bahram Khan, who ruled over eastern Bengal during the Tughlaq dynasty, the Bhulua or Greater Noakhali region was administratively linked to Sonargaon, one of the three administrative divisions of Bengal within the Delhi Sultanate. Ships laden with salt would depart from the ports of Bhulua and Jugidiya for overseas destinations.

Following Bahram&#x27;s demise in 1338, Fakhruddin Mubarak Shah proclaimed the independence of eastern Bengal at Sonargaon. After the establishment of the independent Sultanate of Sonargaon, Fakhruddin set up a military camp in Feni while aiming to conquer Chittagong, overseeing the construction of a mosque and excavation of a reservoir in the region. In an effort to enhance connectivity within his realm, he contributed to the construction of a lengthy highway from Chandpur to Chittagong, passing through Comilla and Feni. In later times, a significant portion of this old highway in the Feni region was incorporated into the DhakaChittagong Trunk Road.

During a period of instability in Bengal, the rise of Tripura as a regional power saw its king extending control over parts of Feni, Comilla, and Sylhet, capitalising on the opportunity presented by Raja Ganesha&#x27;s seizure of power in Bengal.

In historical accounts, it is suggested that Rasti Khan, who served under Ruknuddin Barbak Shah, governed areas extending from Feni to the northern regions of Chittagong. Additionally, during the medieval period, the Kingdom of Tripura exerted significant influence over the Feni and Comilla regions, with the eastern part of Feni being part of the district of Tripura during the British colonial period, which also encompassed the modern district of Comilla.

During the medieval era, a nobleman belonging to the Sur Dynasty named Nizam Shah established a kingdom called Jafarabad along the banks of the Feni River. During the reign of Mughal Emperor Akbar, territorial disputes arose between the Kingdoms of Tripura and Arakan, with Arakan initially seizing control of Chittagong and extending influence up to the Feni River. Following conflicts, Mogh settlements were established in southern Feni-Noakhali, but they fled when the Mughals conquered Chittagong in 1666, who also drove out Portuguese settlers in the region who arrived in late 16th century.

=== Mughal era and rule of the Nawabs ===
Greater Noakhali fell under Mughal rule after they invaded the Bhulua Kingdom—which stretched as far as a portion of Comilla—and ousted its king Ananta Manikya in 1611, led by Subahdar Islam Khan. To ensure control over the newly acquired territories, the Mughals set up a police station (thana), serving as the administrative hub of the area, at the mouth of the Feni River in Jugidiya. Its jurisdiction extended over significant portions of present-day Sonagazi and Companiganj. This station served as the frontier outpost of the Mughal province of Bengal in the far southeast during that period, facing repeated attacks from the Arakan Kingdom.

The Feni region was pivotal during the Mughal conquest of Chittagong, acting as the border with Arakan-held territory. Having been under Mughal control for fifty years, Feni was strategically fortified along the riverside to repel potential Arakanese attacks. After the Mughal conquest of Chittagong, they established a thriving city called Amirgaon in southern Feni, but it was eventually swallowed by the Feni River.

After the death of Aurangzeb&#x27;s, the Mughal Empire began to fragment, leading to the rise of Nawabs in Bengal in the early 18th century. Nawab Murshid Quli Khan, seeking to boost tax revenue, divided Feni&#x27;s largest pargana (administrative unit). Under his rule, the East India Company established a textile mill in southern Feni&#x27;s Jugidiya area. Toward the Nawab era&#x27;s end, a new administrative unit, Chakla Roshnabad, was formed, spanning parts of Sylhet and Comilla, extending to the Feni River&#x27;s southern bank. Shamsher Gazi, who ruled Chakla Roshnabad, emerged as a notable figure, significantly influencing Feni&#x27;s history.

=== Influence of the East India Company ===
Long before the Battle of Plassey, which handed control of Bengal to the East India Company, a French company established a significant textile mill in Jugidiya, a hub for various industries, near the mouth of the Feni River. In 1765, the East India Company gained the authority to collect taxes in Jugidiya and other areas by becoming the official tax collector (diwan) for the Mughal emperor, thereby legitimizing its control over the region.

In 1770, the East India Company&#x27;s ineptitude and exploitative tax policies precipitated a severe famine. Concurrently, the coastal Feni-Noakhali region was devastated by a catastrophic cyclone and tidal surge, resulting in widespread displacement and destruction. The important settlement of Jugidiya was all but submerged. Despite the implementation of the Permanent Settlement system in 1793, much of Feni-Noakhali remained under direct East India Company control, with armed enforcement of high land revenue collection. In the same year, the Manikya king of Tripura acquired land rights in the Roshnabad estate under the new system, including parts of Feni, compelling anti-English landowners to cede their land.

=== Establishment of mahakuma ===
During the British colonial period, administrative units known as thanas were established under district collectorates, forming administrative unions within the district. In a subsequent phase of administrative decentralization, the British authorities divided each district into subdivisions called mahakumas. Before the establishment of Feni mahakuma the Chhagalnaiya and Parshuram thanas (currently upazilas), and Amirgaon thana were part of the Comilla and Noakhali districts respectively. In 1876, the Feni mahakuma (sub-division) was established under the jurisdiction of Noakhali District. The sub-divisional headquarters were originally located in Amirgaon, but were moved to Feni town in 1881. Notably, in 1883, Nabinchandra Sen assumed the role of governor of the mahakuma, overseeing significant developments that earned him the moniker of the true architect of Feni. Furthermore, in 1895 and 1920, two pivotal railway lines, namely the Assam Bengal railway and the FeniBelonia branch line, were constructed, vastly improving Feni&#x27;s connectivity and contributing to its development. Syed Amir Uddin, also known as Pagla Miah, was a Sufi saint who exerted significant influence in the Feni region during this period, earning recognition as its spiritual architect.

=== History leading up to the partition ===
The districts of Feni and Noakhali played a pioneering role in the Swadeshi (self-reliance) movement, particularly in the boycott of foreign goods during the 1930s. Khadi cloth, produced by local weavers, gained immense popularity in these regions. The demand for a separate homeland for Muslims of the subcontinent, presented at the All-India Muslim League Conference held in Lahore in March 1940, resonated strongly in the Feni-Noakhali region, just as it did in other parts of Bengal. Habibullah Bahar Chowdhury of Feni emerged as a leading figure during this time.

Amidst the escalating tensions of the Pakistan Movement and the Indian independence struggle, Feni gained prominence as a significant military hub in South Asia throughout World War II. Its strategic position led to the creation of an Allied forward base and the construction of a large airstrip, which now forms part of the premises of Feni Girls&#x27; Cadet College. Local residents became increasingly agitated as Allied soldiers engaged in acts of violence against women, sparking protests that were met with lethal gunfire. In 1943, Feni endured a Japanese bombing raid during World War II, causing plane crashes and pilot casualties.

As the war concluded and India&#x27;s independence approached in 1946, communal tensions heightened in nearby regions. Feni&#x27;s Hindu-majority areas saw limited violence thanks to local intervention. Ultimately, in 1947, the Indian subcontinent gained independence, leading to the partition into Pakistan and India.

=== Post-partition of Bengal ===
Following partition in 1947, Feni, bordered by the Indian state of Tripura, experienced demographic shifts and social hurdles. The king of Tripura&#x27;s significant land holdings in Feni shaped its socio-economic dynamics. Many Hindu families migrated to Tripura and West Bengal, including professionals, leading to a social void. With Hindu educators departing, the education sector faced crisis, while returning Muslims from India added to unemployment. Post-World War II, Bengali workers returning from Burma worsened economic challenges in Feni.

After partition, Tripura&#x27;s population grew, prompting new settlements by flattening hills and clearing forests. This led to changes in river courses, causing floods in Feni, endangering agriculture and causing annual crop and resource losses worth crores.

The hastily demarcated Feni-Tripura border by the Radcliffe Boundary Commission led to challenges for local residents. Many farmers found their houses in East Pakistani Feni while their cultivated land remained in Indian Tripura, causing households to straddle two countries. This created the issue of , where individuals became citizens of both nations due to the border cutting through their homes.

=== Pakistani rule and the language movement ===
The Muslim League partythe dominant political party of the regionexhibited limited internal democracy and suppressed dissent in Feni, resulting in political, social, and cultural stagnation. However, Feni College emerged as a significant institution during this period. In 1948, it established a student council with a unique democratic structure, featuring direct student elections, unlike the prevalent indirect election systems (through elected representatives) or faculty-appointed bodies elsewhere. These elections sparked discussions among local intellectuals and politicians, encouraging broader public engagement. The elected student council leader became a prominent figure, representing students in social and cultural spheres. Over time, Feni College, through its student council, wielded growing influence on the region&#x27;s social and political landscape, particularly the language movement of Bangladesh. Following Muhammad Ali Jinnah&#x27;s declaration of Urdu as the sole national language in 1948, Feni witnessed numerous anti-government movements, notably during the language movement peak in 1952. Despite orders, students organized public rallies and political movements, continuing well into Ayub Khan&#x27;s military rule. Abdus Salam, a journalist, played a significant role in the language movement of Dhaka and ultimately sacrificed his life for the cause.

After the 1954 legislative elections, Feni underwent a flurry of socio-economic advancements, including the straightening of Silonia and Muhuri rivers (which also saw construction of a dam), digging of Kalidas-Pahalia canal, and development of key infrastructure like bridges and roads. Efforts were made to establish industries such as textile mills, and the town of Feni was incorporated, with initiatives to provide supply of electricity.

Following his release from imprisonment on sedition charges, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the founding father of Bangladesh, was permitted to host a rally in Feni during Yahya Khan&#x27;s rule, marking it as the first area he visited after Dhaka. After his influential speech on 7 March 1971, urging people to take up arms for independence, the people of Feni displayed great enthusiasm by forming a Rastrabhasha Sangram Parishad resistance committee (), contributing to the preparation for the impending conflict.

=== Bangladesh Liberation War ===
During the liberation war, Feni was a main supply route for the Pakistani occupation forces, serving as a vital line of communication for transporting troops, arms, and ammunition from the port city of Chittagong to the capital city Dhaka and other parts of the country. In the early stages, Khwaja Ahmed, head of the resistance committee, organised a diverse force of Mukti Bahini () comprising local police, East Pakistan Rifles (now Border Guard Bangladesh) and Ansar members, ex-military personnel, students, and local youth. Notable individuals such as Joynal Hazari, Noor Ahmed Hazari, Joynal Abedin, Jafar Ullah Khan, Mostafa Hossain, and Flight Lt. Abdur Rouf were instrumental in this effort. They established control of Feni town and fortified Shuvapur Bridge to defend against approaching forces from the south. Subsequently, additional support arrived from Chittagong, reinforcing their defensive positions. Intense confrontations ensued around Shuvapur and Gopal Union as Pakistani forces attempted to cross the Feni River, resulting in significant casualties on their side. The control of the Feni River was crucial due to the strategic importance of Shuvapur road bridge and Dhumghat rail bridge as vital transportation links for the district.

Throughout the first phase of the war, Feni remained unoccupied by enemy forces until 22 April. However, desperate to establish communication between Dhaka and Chittagong, the invading forces launched a land attack from the north in Cumilla, eventually gaining control over Feni. After the fall of Feni town, freedom fighters retreated eastward to Chhagalnaiya, where they inflicted significant casualties on the invaders and seized arms, despite later facing air attacks. With enemy forces concentrated in Feni town, other parts of Feni, including Sonagazi, were relatively free from occupation, allowing freedom fighters to regain control of strategic routes and achieve victories.

In July and August, local collaborators known as razakars emerged, committing atrocities such as killings and arson. Feni&#x27;s proximity to Tripura in India enabled freedom fighters to receive military training and employ guerrilla tactics against the invading forces and their collaborators in the second phase of the war. During the war, notable figures such as Sultan Mahmud, a former officer of the Pakistan Air Force, Salahuddin Mumtaz, Amin Ahmed Chowdhury, and Jafar Imam emerged, contributing significantly to various aspects of the war and Feni&#x27;s development.

Following Pakistan&#x27;s invasion of western India on 3 December, India officially recognised Bangladesh, energising the Mukti Bahini, which launched extensive attacks by land, air, and sea on Pakistani positions. Overwhelmed by these assaults, the invading forces retreated towards Cumilla during the night of 6 December, taking with them the non-Bengali governor of the Feni mahakuma. At dawn the next day, the flag of an independent Bangladesh was raised, eliciting cheers from thousands of people across the Feni region. Eventually, on 16 December, the Pakistani forces formally surrendered in Dhaka, marking Bangladesh&#x27;s attainment of sovereignty and independence.

=== Establishment of the district and post-independence ===
In the late 1950s, discussions began about making Feni mahakuma a separate district. Despite various attempts over the years, including proposals during Sheikh Mujib&#x27;s tenure and administrative reforms under Ershad&#x27;s government, no progress was made. However, after persistent local protests, Feni was finally established as the 61st district of Bangladesh on 1 March 1984, encompassing of land.

== Geography ==
Feni is one of the smallest districts of Bangladesh, covering a total area of . Situated along the strategic DhakaChittagong transportation corridor at Bangladesh&#x27;s south-eastern border, it serves as the sole entry point linking the country&#x27;s primary port city of Chittagong to the northern districts, making it a crucial transit point for goods and people moving between the major economic hubs. The district is surrounded by Nangalkot and Chauddagram upazilas of Comilla District, as well as Tripura state of India to the north. To the west and south-west lie Senbagh and Companiganj upazilas of Noakhali District, while Tripura borders it to the east and north-east. Mirsharai Upazila of Chittagong District lies to the south-east, and the estuary of the Feni River at the Bay of Bengal marks the southern border.

<text>Visual IRC (ViRC) is an open-source Internet Relay Chat client for the Windows operating system. Unlike many other IRC clients, nearly all of the functionality in ViRC is driven by the included IRC script, with the result that the program&#x27;s behavior can be extended or changed without altering the source code.

==History==
*Visual IRC (16-bit) – Released in 1995 for Windows 3.x, written by MeGALiTH. This program had many built-in features, but it was also scriptable with VPL (ViRC Programming Language), the predecessor to ViRCScript and Versus.
*Visual IRC &#x27;96 (and later Visual IRC &#x27;97, Visual IRC &#x27;98) – Released in 1996, written by MeGALiTH. This was the first 32-bit version of ViRC, written for Windows 9x/NT. Many of the features that were built into 16-bit ViRC were handled by the default script in ViRC &#x27;96. ViRC &#x27;98 contained some code contributed by Tara McGrew AKA &quot;Mr2001&quot;, particularly enhancements to the ViRCScript engine. The scripting language was incompatible with the earlier version. In later versions, voice chat and video conferencing features were added.

:Development of the second incarnation slowed and by 2000 Visual IRC appeared to be dead. The original author MeGALiTH (Adrian Cable) passed the source code to a user, Mr2001 (Tara McGrew), who had previously contributed some code, and who had secretly been developing a clone called Bisual IRC (BIRC). Rather than restarting development of the ViRC &#x27;98 code base, he merged some of ViRC &#x27;98&#x27;s features into BIRC and released it as Visual IRC 2.

*Visual IRC 2 – First released by Mr2001, coincidentally in 2001, this version&#x27;s Versus scripting language is based on ViRCScript, but internally it has been almost totally rewritten. In fact, ViRC 2 only shares a few hundred lines of code with ViRC &#x27;98. The voice and video conferencing features were removed in this version because the libraries used to implement them were no longer supported.

Much of the source code to BIRC, ViRC 2, and the related utilities has been released under the GPL through the project&#x27;s web site and SourceForge.

==Versus==
Versus is a scripting language originally developed for the IRC client Bisual IRC, and currently used with Visual IRC. It is similar in many ways to the scripting languages used by ircII and mIRC, as well as Tcl and C.

The name &quot;Versus&quot; was chosen because it could be shortened to &quot;VS&quot;, which was a common abbreviation for ViRCScript, the language used by Visual IRC &#x27;96 through &#x27;98. Versus remained mostly backward compatible with ViRCScript, so existing documentation and commentary that mentioned &quot;VS&quot; remained mostly accurate when applied to Versus. The name also alluded to BIRC&#x27;s origins as a replacement for ViRC.

Object Versus, or OVS, refers to the object-oriented features of Versus. Scripts can define classes and work with objects and methods instead of textual data and aliases; however, in practice, OVS is mostly used to manipulate the VCL objects that make up ViRC&#x27;s interface.

===Script storage===

Scripts are stored in files, usually with a file extension, though the .lib extension is sometimes used. A Versus script file simply contains statements to be interpreted when the script is loaded; any blocks defined in a script (see below) will replace blocks defined with the same name by previous scripts.

===Blocks that can be defined in a script===

*Aliases are subroutines. They can be called from the command entry line of any window, or from other parts of the script. Aliases that return a value are called functions; an alias can determine whether it&#x27;s expected to return a value, and then act as a function or a command appropriately.
*Classes are used in object-oriented scripting (OVS). Each class may contain properties, methods, a constructor, and a destructor.
*Events are used to handle messages from the IRC server, as well as certain system- or client-level occurrences, such as completing a file transfer or opening a new window.
**Server events use regular expressions or Versus&#x27;s own wildcard characters to match messages from the server. If multiple server events match a particular message, only the one with the highest priority (calculated from the length of the pattern and the relative &quot;value&quot; of the wildcards therein) will be executed.
**Client events are identified by name: for example, &lt;OnCreateWindow_foo&gt; and &lt;OnCreateWindow_bar&gt; will both run when a new window is opened. They can also include patterns, which limit the particular occurrences that can trigger that event (for example, to only run when a new &quot;channel&quot; window is created).
*Menu trees and menu items define the context menus that can appear for various elements of the client&#x27;s interface, as well as the main menu which is always visible. Menu tree blocks define the menu&#x27;s layout and set captions for each item; menu item blocks define the script code to be executed when an item is clicked.
*Toolbars and toolbar items are similar to menu tree and menu item blocks, but they define the toolbars associated with each window. New toolbars can be added to the interface simply by choosing a unique name.

Aliases, methods (including constructors and destructors), events, menu items, and toolbar items are referred to as routines or code blocks.

=== Data storage ===

====Files====
*Scripts can access files with the functions $RandomRead() and $ReadLine(), and the commands CreateFile and AppendText.
*Scripts can also use the TStringList VCL class to read an entire text file into memory, manipulate it, and save it.

====Variables====
*All variables may contain up to 4 GiB of data.
*Variable names begin with a dollar sign ($) and an uppercase letter, lowercase letter, or underscore.
*Variables may contain any characters, although they are usually used for printable text.
*Local variables are set with the codice_1 command and only exist in the context of the routine that created them. They are deleted when the routine ends. Some local variables are predefined, such as $C for the current channel&#x27;s name.
*Global variables are set with the codice_2 command and can be accessed from any routine. They are deleted when the client exits. Aliases may return a value by setting the global variable $fresult.
*Stored variables are set with the codice_3 command and, like global variables, can be accessed anywhere. Their values are saved to persistent storage immediately, and restored the next time the client starts.

====Associative arrays====
*Associative arrays map keys to values.
*Keys and values can contain up to 4 GiB of data with no limits on the allowed characters.
*Local, global, and stored array values can be set using the codice_1, codice_2, and codice_3 commands, and they behave just like the corresponding variables. When a stored array value is set, the entire array is saved.
*The syntax codice_7 is used to set or retrieve the value for a particular key.
*The syntax codice_8 alone treats an array as a list of key-value pairs, allowing a script to set the entire contents of an array at once, or iterate through the keys that are already present.

====Pseudovariables====
*Pseudovariables (or pvars) are similar in syntax to variables, but their values cannot be changed.
*The pvars $0 through $9 contain the parameters that were passed to the current routine, in order. $0 contains the routine&#x27;s name, $1 contains the first word of the parameter string, and so on.
*The pvars $0- through $9- contain the parameters that were passed to the current routine, plus all following parameters. $0- contains the routine&#x27;s name and the entire parameter string, $1- contains all parameters, $2- contains all parameters after the first, and so on.
*The special sequence codice_9 causes a dialog box to appear, prompting the user to enter a value.

=== Code examples ===

Here is an example to count to ten:

<text>Li Zicheng (22 September 1606 – 1645), born Li Hongji, also known by his nickname, the Dashing King, was a Chinese peasant rebel leader who helped overthrow the Ming dynasty in April 1644 and ruled over northern China briefly as the Yongchang Emperor () of the short-lived Shun dynasty before his death a year later.

==Biography==
Li Zicheng was born in 1606 as Li Hongji to an impoverished family of farmers in Li Jiqian village, Yan&#x27;an prefecture, northeast Shaanxi province. Li Zicheng had a brother who was 20 years his senior and raised Li Zicheng alongside his son and Zicheng&#x27;s nephew, Li Guo. While Li Zicheng was literate, the source of his education is disputed. Over the course of his late adolescence and early adulthood, Li worked on a farm, in a wine shop, in a blacksmith&#x27;s shop, and as a mailman for the state courier system.

According to folklore, in 1630, Li was put on public display in an iron collar and shackles for failing to repay loans to a usurious magistrate. The magistrate, a man by the name of Ai, struck a guard who tried to give Li shade and water. A group of sympathetic peasants freed Li from his shackles, spirited him to a nearby hill, and proclaimed him their leader. Although they were only armed with wooden sticks, Li and his band managed to ambush a group of government soldiers sent to arrest them, and obtained their first real weapons.

By the late Ming dynasty era, the government had been weakened financially, and struggled to deal with the economic issues, environmental problems, and widespread disease (smallpox and possibly the plague) that afflicted peasant populations. In 1639, an epidemic that would later become known as the Chongzhen Great Plague hit the Yangzi region and spread across the north. Famine and drought compounded the social discontent caused by the epidemic. Environmental disaster, disease, and the failure of the Chongzhen government to protect its people led to major peasant uprisings across Northern China beginning in 1628, with the Shaanxi province as an epicenter of rebellion. Li Zicheng and Zhang Xianzhong, also from Shaanxi province, were two of the major leaders in the peasant rebellions during the late Ming dynasty.

In 1633, Li joined a rebel army led by Gao Yingxiang (高迎祥), nicknamed &quot;the Dashing King.” He inherited Gao&#x27;s nickname and command of the rebel army after Gao&#x27;s death.

Within three years, Li succeeded in rallying more than 30,000 men to his cause. They attacked and killed prominent government officials such as Sun Chuanting in Henan, Shanxi, and Shaanxi. As Li won more battles and gained more support, his army grew larger. Historians attribute this growth in numbers to Li&#x27;s reputation as a Robin Hood-style figure who showed compassion to the poor and only attacked Ming officials.

Li advocated the slogans of &quot;dividing land equally&quot; and &quot;abolishing the grain taxes payment system&quot; which won great support from the peasants. The song, &quot;Killing cattle and sheep, preparing tasty wine and opening the city gate to welcome the Dashing King&quot; was widely spread at the time.

The 1642 Kaifeng flood, caused by breaches of the Yellow River dikes by both sides, ended the siege of Kaifeng and killed over 300,000 of its 378,000 residents. After the battles of Luoyang and Kaifeng, the Ming government was unable to stop Li&#x27;s rebellion, as most of its military force was involved in the battle against the Manchus in the north.

In 1643, Li captured Xiangyang and proclaimed himself &quot;King of Xinshun&quot; (新順王).

Titling himself &quot;Prince of the New Discipline&quot;, he established a capital at Xi&#x27;an.
In April 1644, Li and 300,000 troops marched on the Ming capital of Beijing. They captured Beijing (the gates of which were opened from inside) and the Chongzhen Emperor hanged himself. Li proclaimed himself the emperor of the Shun dynasty. Li, as all contenders for the throne were required, claimed to have the Mandate of Heaven bestowed upon him. Firstly, Li was Han Chinese and hailed from the Shaanxi province of China, which strengthened his legitimacy to the throne versus the foreign Manchus. Li also gained the support of scholar officials which was important in ruling over the people of China as a Confucian state. The name of the dynasty is translated to mean &quot;Obedient to Heaven&quot;.

Li&#x27;s army was eventually defeated on 27 May 1644 at the Battle of Shanhai Pass by the combined forces of the Manchurian Prince Dorgon and the Ming general Wu Sangui who had defected to his side. The Ming and Manchu forces captured Beijing on 6 June and Fulin ascended to the throne to establish the Shunzhi reign with Dorgon as his regent.

When Wu Sangui and Prince Dorgon took control of Beijing, Li fled to Xi&#x27;an in Shaanxi. It is not known how or if Li died during his flight, and there are multiple accounts of his death which vary and some of them have been exaggerated. However, across multiple sources, the year of his death is said to have been 1645. One account states that in the summer of 1645 Li went to raid a village in search of provisions with his remaining followers and was killed by soldiers guarding the village. Another theory is that Li Zicheng became a monk and died in 1674.

Lin Qing, the leader of the Eight Trigrams uprising of 1813 by the Tianli sect (天理教) of the White Lotus, proclaimed that he was the reincarnation of Li Zicheng.

== Historiography ==
Although the success of the Ming-Qing transition was attributed to the weakening of the Ming dynasty (exacerbated by Li Zicheng&#x27;s rebellion), official historiography during the Qing dynasty regarded Li as an illegitimate usurper and outlaw. This view sought to discourage and demonize notions of rebellion against the Qing government, by propagating that the Manchus put an end to Li&#x27;s illegitimate rule and restore peace to the empire, thus receiving the Mandate of Heaven to rule China.

In the &quot;History of Ming&quot;, Li Zicheng was described as having high cheekbones, deep-set eyes and a jackal-like voice.

Li Yan, a semi-mythical advisor of Li Zicheng who was thought to have died in 1644, has been suspected to be a metaphor for the rise and fall of Li Zicheng’s rebellion, as historians doubt his existence in real life.

==In popular culture==

Li appears as a bandit in Baifa Monü Zhuan, a wuxia novel by Liang Yusheng, where the heroine comments he is worthy of being a king.
Li is featured as a character in some of the works of Hong Kong &quot;wuxia&quot; writer Jin Yong (Louis Cha). Li&#x27;s rebellion against the Ming dynasty is featured in &quot;Sword Stained with Royal Blood&quot; and his personality is analysed from the point of view of Yuan Chengzhi, the protagonist. In &quot;The Deer and the Cauldron&quot;, set in the Qing dynasty during the early reign of the Kangxi Emperor, Li is revealed to have survived and fathered a daughter, A&#x27;ke, with Chen Yuanyuan. Li is also briefly mentioned by name in &quot;Fox Volant of the Snowy Mountain&quot; and &quot;The Young Flying Fox&quot;.

Li is the main character of the historical epic novel &quot;Li Zicheng&quot; by Yao Xueyin.

Li also makes an appearance in the visual novel . 

== In folklore ==
There are many stories and folklore attributed to Li Zicheng. One such story claims that when Li Zicheng was young he killed one of his classmates and was promptly disowned by his family and shunned by his community.

<text>Judy Chicago (born Judith Sylvia Cohen; July 20, 1939) is an American feminist artist, art educator, and writer known for her large collaborative art installation pieces about birth and creation images, which examine the role of women in history and culture. During the 1970s, Chicago founded the first feminist art program in the United States at California State University, Fresno (formerly Fresno State College), which acted as a catalyst for feminist art and art education during the 1970s. Her inclusion in hundreds of publications in various areas of the world showcases her influence in the worldwide art community. Many of her books have also been published in other countries, making her work more accessible to international readers. Chicago&#x27;s work incorporates a variety of artistic skills, such as needlework, counterbalanced with skills such as welding and pyrotechnics. Her most well-known work is &quot;The Dinner Party&quot;, which is permanently installed in the Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art at the Brooklyn Museum. &quot;The Dinner Party&quot; celebrates the accomplishments of women throughout history and is widely regarded as the first epic feminist artwork. Other notable art projects by Chicago include &quot;International Honor Quilt&quot;, &quot;Birth Project&quot;, &quot;Powerplay&quot;, and &quot;The Holocaust Project&quot;. She is represented by Jessica Silverman gallery.

Chicago was included in &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;100 Most Influential People of 2018&quot;.

==Early life and family==
Judy Chicago was born Judith Sylvia Cohen to Arthur and May Cohen in Chicago, Illinois, in 1939. Her father came from a 23-generation-long lineage of rabbis, including the Lithuanian Jewish Vilna Gaon. Breaking family tradition, Arthur became a labor organizer and Marxist. He worked nights at a post office and took care of Chicago during the day, while May, a former dancer, worked as a medical secretary. Arthur&#x27;s active participation in the American Communist Party, liberal views of women, and support of workers&#x27; rights strongly influenced Chicago&#x27;s own values and thought. During the American McCarthy era, Arthur was investigated, which made it difficult for him to find work and caused the family much turmoil. In 1945, while Chicago was alone at home with her infant brother Ben, an FBI agent visited their house. The agent began to ask the six-year-old Chicago questions about her father and his friends, but the agent was interrupted by May&#x27;s return to the house. Arthur&#x27;s health declined, and he died in 1953 from peritonitis. May would not discuss his death with her children and did not allow them to attend the funeral. Chicago did not come to terms with his death until she was an adult; in the early 1960s, she was hospitalized for almost a month with a bleeding ulcer.

May loved the arts and instilled her passion for them in her children. Aged three, Chicago began to draw and was sent to the Art Institute of Chicago to attend classes. By the age of five, Chicago knew that she &quot;never wanted to do anything but make art&quot; and continued attending extension classes at the Art Institute throughout her childhood and teens. After high school, she applied to an academic degree program at the School of the Art Institute but was denied admission, and instead attended UCLA on a scholarship.

==Education and early career==
While at UCLA, she became politically active, designing posters for the UCLA NAACP chapter and eventually became its corresponding secretary. In June 1959, she met and dated Jerry Gerowitz. She left school and moved in with him, for the first time having her own studio space. The couple hitchhiked to New York in 1959, just as Chicago&#x27;s mother and brother moved to Los Angeles to be closer to her. The couple lived in Greenwich Village for a time before returning in 1960 from Los Angeles to Chicago so she could finish her degree. Chicago married Gerowitz in 1961. She graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in 1962 and was a member of Phi Beta Kappa society. Gerowitz died in a car crash in 1963, devastating Chicago and causing her to suffer an identity crisis for several years. She received her Master of Fine Arts from UCLA in 1964.

In graduate school, Chicago created a series that was abstract, yet easily recognized as male and female sexual organs. These early works were called &quot;Bigamy&quot;, and represented the death of her husband. One depicted an abstract penis, which was &quot;stopped in flight&quot; before it could unite with a vaginal form. Her professors, who were mainly men, were dismayed over these works. Despite the use of sexual organs in her work, Chicago refrained from using gender politics or identity as themes.

In 1965, Chicago displayed artwork at her first solo show, at the Rolf Nelson Gallery in Los Angeles. Chicago was one of only four female artists to take part in the show.

In 1968, Chicago was asked why she did not participate in the &quot;California Women in the Arts&quot; exhibition at the Lytton Center, to which she answered: &quot;I won&#x27;t show in any group defined as Woman, Jewish, or California. Someday, when we all grow up, there will be no labels.&quot; Chicago began working in ice sculpture, which represented &quot;a metaphor for the preciousness of life,&quot; another reference towards her husband&#x27;s death.

In 1969, the Pasadena Art Museum exhibited a series of Chicago&#x27;s spherical acrylic plastic dome sculptures and drawings in an &quot;experimental&quot; gallery. &quot;Art in America&quot; declared that Chicago&#x27;s work was at the forefront of the conceptual art movement, and the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; described the work as showing no signs of &quot;theoretical New York type art.&quot; Chicago would describe her early artwork as minimalist and as her trying to be &quot;one of the boys.&quot; Chicago would also experiment with performance art, using fireworks and pyrotechnics to create &quot;atmospheres,&quot; which involved flashes of colored smoke being manipulated outdoors.

During this time, Chicago also began exploring her own sexuality in her work. She created the &quot;Pasadena Lifesavers&quot;, which was a series of abstract paintings that placed acrylic paint on Plexiglas. The works blended colors to create an illusion that the shapes &quot;turn, dissolve, open, close, vibrate, gesture, wiggle,&quot; representing her own discovery that &quot;I was multi-orgasmic.&quot; Chicago credited &quot;Pasadena Lifesavers&quot;, as being the major turning point in her work in relation to women&#x27;s sexuality and representation.

===Name change===
As Chicago made her name as an artist and came to know herself as a woman, she no longer felt connected to the surname &quot;Cohen&quot;. This was due to her grief from the death of her father and the lost connection to her married name Gerowitz, after her husband&#x27;s death. She decided to change her last name to something independent of being connected to a man by marriage or heritage.

In 1965, she married sculptor Lloyd Hamrol. They divorced in 1979.

Gallery owner Rolf Nelson nicknamed her &quot;Judy Chicago&quot; because of her strong personality and strong Chicago accent. She decided this would be her new name. By legally changing her surname from the ethnically charged &quot;Gerowitz&quot; to the more neutral &quot;Chicago&quot;, she freed herself from a certain social identity. Chicago was appalled that her new husband&#x27;s signature approval was required to change her name legally. To celebrate the name change, she posed for the exhibition invitation dressed as a boxer, wearing a sweatshirt with her new last name on it. She also posted a banner across the gallery at her 1970 solo show at California State University at Fullerton, that read: &quot;Judy Gerowitz hereby divests herself of all names imposed upon her through male social dominance and chooses her own name, Judy Chicago.&quot; An advertisement with the same statement was placed in &quot;Artforum&#x27;s&quot; October 1970 issue.

==Career==
===1970s===
Chicago is considered one of the &quot;first-generation feminist artists,&quot; a group that also includes Mary Beth Edelson, Carolee Schneeman, and Rachel Rosenthal. They were part of the feminist art movement in Europe and the United States in the early 1970s to develop feminist writing and art.

In 1970, Chicago began teaching full-time at Fresno State College, hoping to teach women the skills needed to express the female perspective in their work. At Fresno, she planned a class that would consist only of women and decided to teach off campus to escape &quot;the presence and hence, the expectations of men.&quot; She taught the first women&#x27;s art class in the fall of 1970 at Fresno State College. It became the Feminist Art Program, a full 15-unit program, in the spring of 1971. This was the first feminist art program in the United States. Fifteen students studied under Chicago at Fresno State College: Dori Atlantis, Susan Boud, Gail Escola, Vanalyne Green, Suzanne Lacy, Cay Lang, Karen LeCocq, Jan Lester, Chris Rush, Judy Schaefer, Henrietta Sparkman, Faith Wilding, Shawnee Wollenman, Nancy Youdelman, and Cheryl Zurilgen. Together, as the Feminist Art Program, these women rented and refurbished an off-campus studio at 1275 Maple Avenue in downtown Fresno. Here they collaborated on art, held reading groups, and discussion groups about their life experiences which then influenced their art. All of the students and Chicago contributed $25 per month to rent the space and to pay for materials.

Later, Judy Chicago and Miriam Schapiro reestablished the Feminist Art Program at California Institute of the Arts. After Chicago left for Cal Arts, the class at Fresno State College was continued by Rita Yokoi from 1971 to 1973, and then by Joyce Aiken in 1973, until her retirement in 1992.

Chicago&#x27;s image is included in the iconic 1972 poster Some Living American Women Artists by Mary Beth Edelson.

With Arlene Raven and Sheila Levrant de Bretteville, Chicago co-founded the Los Angeles Woman&#x27;s Building in 1973. This art school and exhibition space was in a structure named after a pavilion at the 1893 World&#x27;s Colombian Exhibition that featured art made by women from around the world. This housed the Feminist Studio Workshop, described by the founders as &quot;an experimental program in female education in the arts&quot;. They wrote: &quot;our purpose is to develop a new concept of art, a new kind of artist and a new art community built from the lives, feelings, and needs of women.&quot; During this period Chicago began creating spray-painted canvases, primarily abstract, with geometric forms on them. These works evolved, using the same medium, to become more centered around the meaning of the &quot;feminine&quot;. Chicago was strongly influenced by Gerda Lerner.

Chicago&#x27;s first book, &quot;Through the Flower&quot; (1975), &quot;chronicled her struggles to find her own identity as a woman artist&quot;.

====&quot;Womanhouse&quot;====

&quot;Womanhouse&quot; was a project by Chicago and Miriam Schapiro, beginning in fall 1971 once Chicago became a teacher at the California Institute for the Arts. In 1972, Chicago and Schapiro founded the Feminist Art Program at the California Institute of the Arts, which was the first art exhibition space to display a female point of view in art, and chose 21 female students for the course. They wanted to start the year with a large scale collaborative project that involved female artists who spent much of their time talking about their experiences as women. They used these ideas as fuel and dealt with them while working on the project.

The idea for &quot;Womanhouse&quot; was sparked during a discussion they had early in the course about the home as a place with which women were traditionally associated, and they wanted to highlight the realities of womanhood, wifehood, and motherhood within the home. Chicago thought that female students often approach art-making with an unwillingness to push their limits due to their lack of familiarity with tools and processes, and an inability to see themselves as working people. &quot;The aim of the Feminist Art Program is to help women restructure their personalities to be more consistent with their desires to be artists and to help them build their art-making out of their experiences as women.&quot;

===&quot;The Dinner Party&quot;===
Inspired by Lerner, Chicago developed &quot;The Dinner Party&quot;, now in the collection of the Brooklyn Museum. It took her five years to create and cost about $250,000 to complete. First, Chicago conceived the project in her Santa Monica studio: a large triangle, which measures 48 feet by 43 feet by 36 feet, consisting of 39 place settings. Each place commemorates a historical or mythical female figure, such as artists, goddesses, activists, and martyrs. Thirteen women are represented on each side. The embroidered table runners are stitched in the style and technique of the featured woman&#x27;s time. Numerous other names of women are engraved in the &quot;Heritage Floor&quot; upon which the piece sits. The project came into fruition with the assistance of over 400 people, mainly women, who volunteered to assist in needlework, creating sculptures and other aspects of the process. When &quot;The Dinner Party&quot; was first constructed, it was a traveling exhibition. Through the Flower, her non-profit organization, was originally created to cover the expense of the creation and travel of the artwork. Jane Gerhard dedicated a book to Judy Chicago and &quot;The Dinner Party&quot;, entitled &quot;The Dinner Party: Judy Chicago and The Power of Popular Feminism, 1970–2007.&quot;

Many art critics, including Hilton Kramer from &quot;The New York Times&quot;, were unimpressed by her work. Mr. Kramer felt Chicago&#x27;s intended vision was not conveyed through this piece and &quot;it looked like an outrageous libel on the female imagination.&quot; Although art critics felt her work lacked depth and the dinner party was just &quot;vaginas on plates,&quot; it was popular and captivated the general public. Chicago debuted her work in six countries on three continents. She reached over a million people through her artwork. 

In a 1981 interview, Chicago said that the backlash of threats and hateful castigation in reaction to the work brought on the only period of suicide risk she&#x27;d ever experienced in her life, characterizing herself as &quot;like a wounded animal&quot;. She stated that she sought refuge from public attention by moving to a small rural community and that friends and acquaintances took on administrative support roles for her, such as opening her mail, while she threw herself into working on &quot;Embroidering Our Heritage&quot;, the book documenting the project. She further said,

===&quot;Birth Project&quot; and &quot;PowerPlay&quot;===
From 1980 to 1985 Chicago created &quot;Birth Project&quot;. The piece used images of childbirth to celebrate woman&#x27;s role as mother. Chicago was inspired to create this collective work because of the lack of imagery and representation of birth in the art world. Judy Chicago famously said &quot;If men could give birth, there would be millions of representations of the crowning.&quot; The installation reinterpreted the Genesis creation narrative, which focused on the idea that a male god created a male human, Adam, without the involvement of a woman. Chicago described the piece as revealing a &quot;primordial female self hidden among the recesses of my soul...the birthing woman is part of the dawn of creation.&quot; 150 needleworkers from the United States, Canada and New Zealand assisted in the project, working on 100 panels, by quilting, macrame, embroidery and other techniques. The size of the piece means it is rarely displayed in its entirety. The majority of the pieces from &quot;Birth Project&quot; are held in the collection of the Albuquerque Museum.

Chicago was not personally interested in motherhood. While she admired the women who chose this path she did not find it right for herself. In 2012, she said, &quot;There was no way on this earth I could have had children and the career I&#x27;ve had.&quot;

Overlapping with &quot;Birth Project&quot;, Chicago started working independently on &quot;PowerPlay&quot; in 1982: a series of large-scale paintings, drawings, cast paper reliefs and bronze reliefs. What both the series, however, have in common is that their subject matters deal with issues rarely depicted in Western art. The &quot;PowerPlay&quot; series was inspired by Chicago&#x27;s trip to Italy, where she saw the masterpieces of Renaissance artists representing the Western artistic tradition. As Judy Chicago wrote in her autobiographical book: “I was to be greatly influenced by actually seeing the major Renaissance paintings. Looking at their monumental scale and clarity led me to decide to cast my examination of masculinity in the classical tradition of the heroic nude and to do so in a series of large-scale oil paintings.”

The titles of the works such as &quot;Crippled by the Need to Control/Blind Individuality, Pissing on Nature, Driving the World to Destruction, In the Shadow of the Handgun, Disfigured by Power&quot;, etc., indicate Chicago&#x27;s focus on male violent behaviour. However, the brightly coloured images of facial expressions and parts of male bodies express not only aggression and power but also vulnerability. Chicago&#x27;s husband Donald Woodman posed for the piece &quot;Woe/Man&quot;. She depended “upon [her] own sense of truth, working from observation, experience, and, of course, [her] rage at how destructively so many men seem to act toward women and the world at large.”

By depicting male bodies Chicago replaced the traditional male gaze with a female one. As she said: “I knew that I didn’t want to keep perpetuating the use of the female body as the repository of so many emotions; it seemed as if everything – love, dread, longing, loathing, desire, and terror – was projected onto the female by both male and female artists, albeit with often differing perspectives. I wondered what feelings the male body might be made to express.”

===&quot;The Holocaust Project&quot;===
In the mid-1980s Chicago&#x27;s interests &quot;shifted beyond &#x27;issues of female identity&#x27; to an exploration of masculine power and powerlessness in the context of the Holocaust.&quot; Chicago&#x27;s &quot;The Holocaust Project: From Darkness into Light&quot; (1985–93) is a collaboration with her husband, photographer Donald Woodman, whom she married on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1985. Although Chicago&#x27;s previous husbands were both Jewish, it was not until she met Woodman that she began to explore her own Jewish heritage. Chicago met poet Harvey Mudd, who had written an epic poem about the Holocaust. Chicago was interested in illustrating the poem, but decided to create her own work instead, using her own art, visual and written. Chicago worked alongside her husband to complete the piece, which took eight years to finish. The piece, which documents victims of the Holocaust, was created during a time of personal loss in Chicago&#x27;s life: the death of her brother Ben from Lou Gehrig&#x27;s disease, and the death of her mother from cancer.

Chicago used the Holocaust as a prism through which to explore victimization, oppression, injustice, and human cruelty. To seek inspiration for the project, Chicago and Woodman watched the documentary &quot;Shoah&quot;, which comprises interviews with Holocaust survivors at Nazi concentration camps and other Holocaust sites. They also explored photo archives and written pieces about the Holocaust. They spent several months touring concentration camps and visited Israel. Chicago brought other issues into the work, such as environmentalism, Native American genocide, and the Vietnam War. With these subjects Chicago sought to relate contemporary issues to the moral dilemma behind the Holocaust. This aspect of the work caused controversy within the Jewish community, due to the comparison of the Holocaust to these other historical and contemporary concerns. &quot;The Holocaust Project: From Darkness into Light&quot; consists of sixteen large-scale works made of a variety of mediums including: tapestry, stained glass, metal work, wood work, photography, painting, and the sewing of Audrey Cowan. The exhibit ends with a piece that displays a Jewish couple at Sabbath. The piece comprises 3000 square feet, providing a full exhibition experience for the viewer. &quot;The Holocaust Project: From Darkness into Light&quot; was exhibited for the first time in October 1993 at the Spertus Museum in Chicago. Most of the work from the piece is held at the Holocaust Center in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

Over the next six years Chicago created works that explored the experiences of concentration camp victims. Galit Mana of &quot;Jewish Renaissance&quot; magazine notes, &quot;This shift in focus led Chicago to work on other projects with an emphasis on Jewish tradition&quot;, including &quot;Voices from the Song of Songs&quot; (1997), where Chicago &quot;introduces feminism and female sexuality into her representation of strong biblical female characters.&quot;

===1980s and 1990s===
In 1985, Chicago married photographer Donald Woodman.

In 1994, Chicago started the series &quot;Resolutions: A Stitch in Time&quot;, completed over a six-year period. Six years later, &quot;Resolutions: A Stitch in Time&quot; was exhibited to the public at the Museum of Art and Design in New York.

In 1996, Chicago and Woodman moved into the Belen Hotel, an historic railroad hotel in Belen, New Mexico which Woodman had spent three years converting into a home.

In 1999, Chicago received the UCLA Alumni Professional Achievement Award, and was awarded honorary degrees from Lehigh University, Smith College, Duke University and Russell Sage College.

===21st century===
In 2004, Chicago received a Visionary Woman Award from Moore College of Art &amp; Design. She was named a National Women&#x27;s History Project honoree for Women&#x27;s History Month in 2008.

To celebrate her 25th wedding anniversary with Woodman, she created a &quot;Renewal Ketubah&quot; in 2010.

In 2011, Chicago returned to Los Angeles for the opening of the &quot;Concurrents&quot; exhibition at the Getty Museum and performed a firework-based installation piece in the Pomona College football field, a site where she had previously performed in the 1960s. Chicago also donated her collection of feminist art educational materials to Penn State University.

Chicago had two solo exhibitions in the United Kingdom in 2012, one in London and another in Liverpool. The Liverpool exhibition included the launch of Chicago&#x27;s book about Virginia Woolf. Once a peripheral part of her artistic expression, Chicago now considers writing to be well integrated into her career. That year, she was also awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award at the Palm Springs Art Fair.

She was interviewed for the 2018 film &quot;!Women Art Revolution&quot;. In an interview with Gloria Steinem in 2018, Chicago described her &quot;goal as an artist&quot; has been “to create images in which the female experience is the path to the universal, as opposed to learning everything through the male gaze.&quot;

In 2021, she was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame. A major retrospective exhibition, titled &quot;Judy Chicago: A Retrospective,&quot; was displayed at the De Young Museum in San Francisco in 2021; it was Judy Chicago&#x27;s first retrospective.

Chicago&#x27;s work was included in the 2021 exhibition &quot;Women in Abstraction&quot; at the Centre Pompidou.

In 2022, Chicago collaborated with Nadya Tolokonnikova to transform her &quot;What if Women Ruled the World?&quot; series into a participatory art project, enabled by blockchain with the hopes of spawning a Web3 community dedicated to gender rights.

Chicago strives to push herself, exploring new directions for her art; early in her career, she attended car-body school to learn to air-brush and has expanded her practice to include a variety of media including glass. Taking such risks is easier to do when one lives by Chicago&#x27;s philosophy: &quot;I&#x27;m not career driven. Damien Hirst&#x27;s dots sold, so he made thousands of dots. I would, like, never do that! It wouldn&#x27;t even occur to me.&quot;

From October 2023 to early March 2024, Chicago&#x27;s work is featured across four floors of the New Museum in New York City in a comprehensive museum survey of her work titled &quot;Judy Chicago: Herstory&quot;.

Chicago&#x27;s artwork is held in the permanent collections of several museums including The British Museum, The Brooklyn Museum, The Getty Trust, The Los Angeles County Museum of Art, New Mexico Museum of Art, The National Gallery of Art, The National Museum of Women in the Arts, The Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, and The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. Her archives are held at the Schlesinger Library at Radcliffe College, and her collection of women&#x27;s history and culture books are held in the collection of the University of New Mexico.

==Style and work==
Chicago was inspired by the &quot;ordinary&quot; woman, which was a focus of the early 1970s feminist movement. This inspiration bled into her work, particularly in &quot;The Dinner Party&quot;, as a fascination with textile work and craft, types of art often culturally associated with women. Chicago trained herself in &quot;macho arts&quot;, taking classes in auto body work, boat-building and pyrotechnics. Through auto body work she learned spray painting techniques and the skill to fuse color and surface to any type of media, which would become a signature of her later work. The skills learned through boat building would be used in her sculpture work, and pyrotechnics would be used to create fireworks for performance pieces. These skills allowed Chicago to bring fiberglass and metal into her sculpture, and eventually she would become an apprentice under Mim Silinsky to learn the art of porcelain painting, which would be used to create works in &quot;The Dinner Party&quot;. Chicago also added the skill of stained glass to her artistic tool belt, which she used for &quot;The Holocaust Project&quot;. Photography became more present in Chicago&#x27;s work as her relationship with photographer Donald Woodman developed. Since 2003, Chicago has been working with glass.

Collaboration is a major aspect of Chicago&#x27;s installation works. &quot;The Dinner Party&quot;, &quot;Birth Project&quot;, and &quot;Resolutions&quot; were all completed as a collaborative process with Chicago and hundreds of volunteer participants. Volunteer artisans skills vary, often connected to &quot;stereotypical&quot; women&#x27;s arts such as textile arts. Chicago makes a point to acknowledge her assistants as collaborators, a task at which other artists have notably failed.

==Through the Flower==
In 1978 Chicago founded Through the Flower, a non-profit feminist art organization. The organization seeks to educate the public about the importance of art and how it can be used as a tool to emphasize women&#x27;s achievements. Through the Flower also serves as the maintainer of Chicago&#x27;s works, having handled the storage of &quot;The Dinner Party&quot;, before it found a permanent home at the Brooklyn Museum. The organization also maintained The Dinner Party Curriculum, which serves as a &quot;living curriculum&quot; for education about feminist art ideas and pedagogy. The online aspect of the curriculum was donated to Penn State University in 2011.

==Teaching career==
Judy Chicago became aware of the sexism that was rampant in modern art institutions, museums, and schools while getting her undergraduate and graduate degree at UCLA in the 1960s. She did not challenge this sexism as an undergrad. In fact, she did quite the opposite by trying to match — both in her artwork and in her personal style — what she thought of as masculinity in the artistic styles and habits of her male counterparts. Not only did she begin to work with heavy industrial materials, but she also smoked cigars, dressed &quot;masculine&quot;, and attended motorcycle shows. This awareness continued to grow as she recognized how society did not see women as professional artists in the same way they recognized men. Angered by this, Chicago channeled this energy and used it to strengthen her feminist values as a person and teacher. While most teachers based their lessons on technique, visual forms, and color, the foundation for Chicago&#x27;s teachings were on the content and social significance of the art, especially in feminism. Stemming from the male-dominated art community Chicago studied with for so many years, she valued art based on research, social or political views, and/or experience. She wanted her students to grow into their art professions without having to sacrifice what womanhood meant to them. Chicago developed an art education methodology in which &quot;female-centered content&quot;, such as menstruation and giving birth, is encouraged by the teacher as &quot;personal is political&quot; content for art. Chicago advocates the teacher as facilitator by actively listening to students in order to guide content searches and the translation of content into art. She refers to her teaching methodology as &quot;participatory art pedagogy.&quot;

The art created in the Feminist Art Program and &quot;Womanhouse&quot; introduced perspectives and content about women&#x27;s lives that had been taboo topics in society, including the art world. In 1970 Chicago developed the Feminist Art Program at California State University, Fresno, and has implemented other teaching projects that conclude with an art exhibition by students such as &quot;Womanhouse&quot; with Miriam Schapiro at CalArts, and &quot;SINsation&quot; in 1999 at Indiana University, &quot;From Theory to Practice: A Journey of Discovery&quot; at Duke University in 2000, &quot;At Home: A Kentucky Project with Judy Chicago and Donald Woodman&quot; at Western Kentucky University in 2002, &quot;Envisioning the Future&quot; at California Polytechnic State University and Pomona Arts Colony in 2004, and &quot;Evoke/Invoke/Provoke&quot; at Vanderbilt University in 2005. Several students involved in Judy Chicago&#x27;s teaching projects established successful careers as artists, including Suzanne Lacy, Faith Wilding, and Nancy Youdelman.

In the early 2000s Chicago organized her teaching style into three parts: preparation, process, and art-making. Each has a specific purpose and is crucial. During the preparation phase, students identify a deep personal concern and then research that issue. In the process phase, students gather together in a group to discuss the materials they plan on using and the content of their work. Finally, in the art-making phase, students find materials, sketch, critique, and produce art.

In 2022, Judy Chicago and Donald Woodman returned to education after 50 years since &quot;Womanhouse&quot;″s debut. &quot;Wo/Manhouse 2022&quot;, located in Belen, New Mexico, featured 19 New Mexico-based artists exploring gender roles, identity, family, labor, and more through site-specific artworks in a 1950s-style house. The project was facilitated by original &quot;Womanhouse&quot; participant Nancy Youdelman.

<doc id="309849" wikidata="Q1747559" url="?curid=309849" title="Phenelzine">
<text>Phenelzine, sold under the brand name Nardil among others, is a non-selective and irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) of the hydrazine family which is primarily used as an antidepressant and anxiolytic to treat depression and anxiety. Along with tranylcypromine and isocarboxazid, phenelzine is one of the few non-selective and irreversible MAOIs still in widespread clinical use.

Synthesis of phenelzine was first described by Emil Votoček and Otakar Leminger in 1932.

==Medical uses==
Phenelzine is primarily used in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Patients with depressive symptomology characterized as &quot;atypical,&quot; &quot;nonendogenous,&quot; and/or &quot;neurotic&quot; respond particularly well to phenelzine. The medication is also useful in patients who do not respond favorably to first and second-line treatments for depression, or are &quot;treatment-resistant.&quot; In addition to being a recognized treatment for major depressive disorder, phenelzine is effective in treating dysthymia, bipolar depression (BD), panic disorder (PD), social anxiety disorder, bulimia nervosa, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD).

==Side effects==
Common side effects of phenelzine may include dizziness, blurry vision, dry mouth, headache, lethargy, sedation, somnolence, insomnia, anorexia, weight gain or loss, small fiber peripheral neuropathy, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, urinary retention, mydriasis, muscle tremors, hyperthermia, sweating, hypertension or hypotension, orthostatic hypotension, paresthesia, hepatitis, and sexual dysfunction (consisting of loss of libido and anorgasmia). Rare side effects usually only seen in susceptible individuals may include hypomania or mania, psychosis and acute liver failure, the last of which is usually only seen in people with pre-existing liver damage, old age, long-term effects of alcohol consumption, or viral infection.

==Interactions==

The MAOIs have certain dietary restrictions and drug interactions. A hypertensive crisis may result from the overconsumption of tyramine-containing foods, although it is a rare occurrence. Serotonin syndrome may result from an interaction with certain drugs which increase serotonin activity such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin releasing agents, and serotonin agonists.

Phenelzine has also been linked to vitamin B6 deficiency. Transaminases such as GABA-transaminase have been shown to be dependent upon vitamin B6 and may be involved in a potentially related process, since the phenelzine metabolite phenylethylidenehydrazine (PEH) is a GABA-transaminase inhibitor. Both phenelzine and vitamin B6 are rendered inactive upon these reactions occurring. The pyridoxine form of B6 is recommended for supplementation, since this form has been shown to reduce hydrazine toxicity from phenelzine and, in contrast, the pyridoxal form has been shown to increase the toxicity of hydrazines.

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
Phenelzine is a non-selective and irreversible inhibitor of the enzyme monoamine oxidase (MAO). It inhibits both of the respective isoforms of MAO, MAO-A and MAO-B, and does so almost equally, with a slight preference for the former. By inhibiting MAO, phenelzine prevents the breakdown of the monoamine neurotransmitters serotonin, melatonin, norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine, as well as the trace amine neuromodulators such as phenethylamine, tyramine, octopamine, and tryptamine. This leads to an increase in the extracellular concentrations of these neurochemicals and, therefore, an alteration in neurochemistry and neurotransmission. This action is thought to be the primary mediator in phenelzine&#x27;s therapeutic benefits.

Phenelzine and its metabolites also inhibit at least two other enzymes to a lesser extent, of which are alanine transaminase (ALA-T), and γ-aminobutyric acid transaminase (GABA-T), the latter of which is not caused by phenelzine itself, but by a phenelzine metabolite phenylethylidenehydrazine (PEH). By inhibiting ALA-T and GABA-T, phenelzine causes an increase in the alanine and GABA levels in the brain and body. GABA is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system, and is very important for the normal suppression of anxiety, stress, and depression. Phenelzine&#x27;s action in increasing GABA concentrations may significantly contribute to its antidepressant, and especially, anxiolytic/antipanic properties, the latter of which have been considered superior to those of other antidepressants. As for ALA-T inhibition, though the consequences of disabling this enzyme are currently not well understood, there is some evidence to suggest that it is this action of the hydrazines (including phenelzine) which may be responsible for the occasional incidence of hepatitis and liver failure.

Phenelzine has also been shown to metabolize to phenethylamine (PEA). PEA acts as a releasing agent of norepinephrine and dopamine, which occurs in a similar manner to amphetamine by being taken up into vesicles, displacing and causing the release of those monoamines, and reversing monoamine flux through their respective transporters (though with markedly shorter pharmacokinetics).

Like many other antidepressants, phenelzine usually requires several weeks of treatment to achieve full therapeutic effects. The reason for this delay is not fully understood. Still, it is believed to be due to many factors, including achieving steady-state levels of MAO inhibition and the resulting adaptations in mean neurotransmitter levels, the possibility of necessary desensitization of autoreceptors which generally inhibit the release of neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine, and also the upregulation of enzymes such as serotonin N-acetyltransferase. Typically, a therapeutic response to MAOIs is associated with an inhibition of at least 80-85% of monoamine oxidase activity.

===Pharmacokinetics===
Phenelzine is administered orally in the form of phenelzine sulfate and is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The time to peak plasma concentration is 43 minutes, and the half-life is 11.6 hours. Unlike most other drugs, phenelzine irreversibly disables MAO. As a result, it does not necessarily need to be present in the blood at all times for its effects to be sustained. Because of this, upon phenelzine treatment being ceased, its effects typically do not wear off until the body replenishes its enzyme stores, a process which can take as long as 2–3 weeks.

Phenelzine is metabolized primarily in the liver, and its metabolites are excreted in the urine. Oxidation is the primary routine of metabolism, and the major metabolites are phenylacetic acid and parahydroxyphenylacetic acid, recovered as about 73% of the excreted dose of phenelzine in the urine over 96 hours after single doses. Acetylation to N2-acetylphenelzine is a minor pathway. Phenelzine may also interact with cytochrome P450 enzymes, inactivating these enzymes through the formation of a heme adduct. Two other minor metabolites of phenelzine, as mentioned above, include phenylethylidenehydrazine and phenethylamine.

==Chemistry==
Phenelzine, also known as 2-phenylethylhydrazine or phenylethylamine hydrazide, is a phenethylamine and hydrazine derivative. It is the hydrazide of β-phenethylamine and can also be referred to as &quot;N&quot;-aminophenethylamine.

Close analogues of phenelzine include the amphetamine and hydrazine derivatives pheniprazine (α-methylphenelzine; the corresponding amphetamine analogue) and metfendrazine (α,&quot;N&quot;-dimethylphenelzine; the corresponding methamphetamine analogue), among others.

==Research==
Phenelzine showed promise in a phase II clinical trial from March 2020 in treating prostate cancer. Phenelzine has also been shown to have neuroprotective effects in animal models.

<text>The Yuezhi were an ancient people first described in Chinese histories as nomadic pastoralists living in an arid grassland area in the western part of the modern Chinese province of Gansu, during the 1st millennium BC. After a major defeat at the hands of the Xiongnu in 176 BC, the Yuezhi split into two groups migrating in different directions: the Greater Yuezhi and Lesser Yuezhi. This started a complex domino effect that radiated in all directions and, in the process, set the course of history for much of Asia for centuries to come.

The Greater Yuezhi initially migrated northwest into the Ili Valley (on the modern borders of China and Kazakhstan), where they reportedly displaced elements of the Sakas. They were driven from the Ili Valley by the Wusun and migrated southward to Sogdia and later settled in Bactria. The Greater Yuezhi have consequently often been identified with peoples mentioned in classical European sources as having overrun the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom, like the &quot;Tókharoi&quot; and &quot;Asii&quot;. During the 1st century BC, one of the five major Greater Yuezhi tribes in Bactria, the &quot;Kushanas&quot;, began to subsume the other tribes and neighbouring peoples. The subsequent Kushan Empire, at its peak in the 3rd century AD, stretched from Turfan in the Tarim Basin in the north to Pataliputra on the Gangetic plain of India in the south. The Kushanas played an important role in the development of trade on the Silk Road and the introduction of Buddhism to China.

The Lesser Yuezhi migrated southward to the edge of the Tibetan Plateau. Some are reported to have settled among the Qiang people in Qinghai, and to have been involved in the Liang Province Rebellion (184–221 AD) against the Eastern Han dynasty. Another group of Yuezhi is said to have founded the city state of Cumuḍa (now known as &quot;Kumul&quot; and Hami) in the eastern Tarim. A fourth group of Lesser Yuezhi may have become part of the Jie people of Shanxi, who established the Later Zhao state of the 4th century AD (although this remains controversial).

Many scholars believe that the Yuezhi were an Indo-European people.
Although some scholars have associated them with artifacts of extinct cultures in the Tarim Basin, such as the Tarim mummies and texts recording the Tocharian languages, there is no evidence for any such link.

== Earliest references in Chinese texts ==

Three pre-Han texts mention peoples who appear to be the Yuezhi, albeit under slightly different names.
* The philosophical tract &quot;Guanzi&quot; (73, 78, 80 and 81) mentions nomadic pastoralists known as the &quot;Yúzhī&quot; or &quot;Niúzhī&quot;, who supplied jade to the Chinese. (The &quot;Guanzi&quot; is now generally believed to have been compiled around 26 BC, based on older texts, including some from the Qi state era of the 11th to 3rd centuries BC. Most scholars no longer attribute its primary authorship to Guan Zhong, a Qi official in the 7th century BC.) The export of jade from the Tarim Basin, since at least the late 2nd millennium BC, is well-documented archaeologically. For example, hundreds of jade pieces found in the Tomb of Fu Hao () originated from the Khotan area, on the southern rim of the Tarim Basin. According to the &quot;Guanzi&quot;, the Yúzhī/Niúzhī, unlike the neighbouring Xiongnu, did not engage in conflict with nearby Chinese states.
* The epic novel &quot;Tale of King Mu, Son of Heaven&quot; (early 4th century BC) also mentions a plain of &quot;Yúzhī&quot; to the northwest of the Zhou lands.
* Chapter 59 of the &quot;Yi Zhou Shu&quot; (probably dating from the 4th to 1st century BC) refers to a &quot;Yúzhī&quot; people living to the northwest of the Zhou domain and offering horses as tribute. A late supplement contains the name &quot;Yuèdī&quot;, which may be a misspelling of the name &quot;Yuèzhī&quot; found in later texts.

In the 1st century BC, Sima Qian – widely regarded as the founder of Chinese historiography – describes how the Qin dynasty (221–206 BC) bought jade and highly valued military horses from a people that Sima Qian called the &quot;Wūzhī&quot;, led by a man named Luo. The &quot;Wūzhī&quot; traded these goods for Chinese silk, which they then sold on to other neighbours. This is probably the first reference to the Yuezhi as a lynchpin in trade on the Silk Road, which in the 3rd century BC began to link Chinese states to Central Asia and, eventually, the Middle East, the Mediterranean and Europe.

== Account of Zhang Qian ==
The earliest detailed account of the Yuezhi is found in chapter 123 of the &quot;Records of the Great Historian&quot; by Sima Qian, describing a mission of Zhang Qian in the late 2nd century BC. Essentially the same text appears in chapter 61 of the &quot;Book of Han&quot;, though Sima Qian has added occasional words and phrases to clarify the meaning.

Both texts use the name &quot;Yuèzhī&quot;, composed of characters meaning &quot;moon&quot; and &quot;clan&quot; respectively. Several different romanizations of this Chinese-language name have appeared in print. The Iranologist H. W. Bailey preferred &quot;Üe-ṭşi&quot;. Another modern Chinese pronunciation of the name is &quot;Ròuzhī&quot;, based on the thesis that the character in the name is a scribal error for ; however Thierry considers this thesis &quot;thoroughly wrong&quot;.

=== Yuezhi and Xiongnu ===
The account begins with the Yuezhi occupying the grasslands to the northwest of China at the beginning of the 2nd century BC:

The area between the Qilian Mountains and Dunhuang lies in the western part of the modern Chinese province of Gansu, but no archaeological remains of the Yuezhi have yet been found in this area. Some scholars have argued that &quot;Dunhuang&quot; should be Dunhong, a mountain in the Tian Shan, and that Qilian should be interpreted as a name for the Tian Shan. They have thus placed the original homeland of the Yuezhi 1,000 km further northwest in the grasslands to the north of the Tian Shan (in the northern part of modern Xinjiang). Other authors suggest that the area identified by Sima Qian was merely the core area of an empire encompassing the western part of the Mongolian plain, the upper reaches of the Yellow River, the Tarim Basin and possibly much of central Asia, including the Altai Mountains, the site of the Pazyryk burials of the Ukok Plateau.

By the late 3rd century the Xiongnu monarch Touman even sent his eldest son Modu as a hostage to the Yuezhi. The Yuezhi often attacked their neighbour the Wusun to acquire slaves and pasture lands. Wusun originally lived together with the Yuezhi in the region between Dunhuang and Qilian Mountain. The Yuezhi attacked the Wusuns, killed their monarch Nandoumi and took his territory. The son of Nandoumi, Kunmo fled to the Xiongnu and was brought up by the Xiongnu monarch.
Gradually the Xiongnu grew stronger, and war broke out with the Yuezhi. There were at least four wars according to the Chinese accounts. The first war broke out during the reign of the Xiongnu monarch Touman (who died in 209 BC) who suddenly attacked the Yuezhi. The Yuezhi wanted to kill Modu, the son of the Xiongnu king Touman kept as a hostage to them, but Modu stole a good horse from them and managed to escape to his country. He subsequently killed his father and became ruler of the Xiongnu. It appears that the Xiongnu did not defeat the Yuezhi in this first war. The second war took place in the 7th year of the Modu era (203 BC). In this war, a large area of the territory originally belonging to the Yuezhi was seized by the Xiongnu and the hegemony of the Yuezhi started to shake. The third war probably was in 176 BC (or shortly before), and the Yuezhi were badly defeated.

Shortly before 176 BC, led by one of Modu&#x27;s tribal chiefs, the Xiongnu invaded Yuezhi territory in the Gansu region and achieved a crushing victory. Modu boasted in a letter (174 BC) to the Han emperor that due to &quot;the excellence of his fighting men, and the strength of his horses, he has succeeded in wiping out the Yuezhi, slaughtering or forcing to submission every number of the tribe.&quot; The son of Modu, Laoshang Chanyu (ruled 174–166 BC), subsequently killed the king of the Yuezhi and, in accordance with nomadic traditions, &quot;made a drinking cup out of his skull.&quot; (&quot;Shiji&quot; 123.)
The wife of the murdered king became the new monarch of Greater Yuezhi.

Nevertheless, in about 173 BC, the Wusun were apparently defeated by the Yuezhi, who killed a Wusun king known as Nandoumi.

=== Exodus of the Great Yuezhi ===

After their defeat by the Xiongnu, the Yuezhi split into two groups. The Lesser or Little Yuezhi moved to the &quot;southern mountains&quot;, believed to be the Qilian Mountains on the edge of the Tibetan Plateau, to live with the Qiang.

The so-called Greater or Great Yuezhi began migrating north-west in about 165 BC, first settling in the Ili valley, immediately north of the Tian Shan mountains, where they defeated the Sai (Sakas): &quot;The Yuezhi attacked the king of the Sai who moved a considerable distance to the south and the Yuezhi then occupied his lands&quot; (&quot;Book of Han&quot; 61 4B). This was &quot;the first historically recorded movement of peoples originating in the high plateaus of Asia.&quot;

In 132 BC the Wusun, in alliance with the Xiongnu and out of revenge from an earlier conflict, again managed to dislodge the Yuezhi from the Ili Valley, forcing them to move south-west. The Yuezhi passed through the neighbouring urban civilization of Dayuan (in Ferghana) and settled on the northern bank of the Oxus, in the region of northern Bactria, or Transoxiana (modern Tajikistan and Uzbekistan).

=== Visit of Zhang Qian ===
The Yuezhi were visited in Transoxiana by a Chinese mission, led by Zhang Qian in 126 BC, which sought an offensive alliance with the Yuezhi against the Xiongnu. His request for an alliance was denied by the Yuezhi, who now had a peaceful life in Transoxiana and had no interest in revenge. Zhang Qian, who spent a year in Transoxiana and Bactria, wrote a detailed account in the &quot;Shiji&quot;, which gives considerable insight into the situation in Central Asia at the time.

Zhang Qian also reported:

In a sweeping analysis of the physical types and cultures of Central Asia, Zhang Qian reports:


Zhang Qian also described the remnants of the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom on the other side of the Oxus River (Chinese &quot;Gui&quot;) as a number of autonomous city-states under Yuezhi suzerainty:

== Later Chinese accounts ==
The next mention of the Yuezhi in Chinese sources is found in chapter 96A of the &quot;Book of Han&quot; (completed in AD 111), relating to the early 1st century BC. At this time, the Yuezhi are described as occupying the whole of Bactria, organized into five major tribes or &quot;xīhóu&quot;. These tribes were known to the Chinese as:

* &quot;Xiūmì&quot; (休密) in Western Wakhān and Zibak;
* &quot;Guìshuāng&quot; (貴霜) in Badakhshan and adjoining territories north of the Oxus;
* &quot;Shuāngmí&quot; (雙靡) in the region of Shughnan or Chitral.
* &quot;Xīdùn&quot; (肸頓) in the region of Balkh, and;
* &quot;Dūmì&quot; (都密) in the region of Termez.
The &quot;Book of the Later Han&quot; (5th century CE) also records the visit of Yuezhi envoys to the Chinese capital in 2 BC, who gave oral teachings on Buddhist sutras to a student, suggesting that some Yuezhi already followed the Buddhist faith during the 1st century BC (Baldev Kumar 1973).

Chapter 88 of the &quot;Book of the Later Han&quot; relies on a report of Ban Yong, based on the campaigns of his father Ban Chao in the late 1st century AD. It reports that one of the five tribes of the Yuezhi, the &quot;Guishuang&quot;, had managed to take control of the tribal confederation:

A later Chinese annotation in Zhang Shoujie&#x27;s &quot;Shiji&quot; (quoting Wan Zhen 萬震 in &quot;Nánzhōuzhì&quot; 南州志 [&quot;Strange Things from the Southern Region&quot;], a now-lost 3rd-century text from the Wu kingdom), describes the Kushans as living in the same general area north of India, in cities of Greco-Roman style, and with sophisticated handicraft. The quotes are dubious, as Wan Zhen probably never visited the Yuezhi kingdom through the Silk Road, though he might have gathered his information from the trading ports in the coastal south. Chinese sources continued to use the name Yuezhi and seldom used the Kushan (or &quot;Guishuang&quot;) as a generic term:

== Kushana ==

The Central Asian people who called themselves &quot;Kushana&quot;, were among the conquerors of the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom during the 2nd century BC, and are widely believed to have originated as a dynastic clan or tribe of the Yuezhi. The area of Bactria they settled came to be known as Tokharistan. Because some inhabitants of Bactria became known as &quot;Tukhāra&quot; (Sanskrit) or &quot;Tókharoi&quot; (Τοχάριοι; Greek), these names later became associated with the Yuezhi.

The Kushana spoke Bactrian, an Eastern Iranian language.

===Bactria===
In the 3rd century BC, Bactria had been conquered by the Greeks under Alexander the Great and since settled by the Hellenistic civilization of the Seleucids.
The resulting Greco-Bactrian Kingdom lasted until the 2nd century BC. The area came under pressure from various nomadic peoples and the Greek city of Alexandria on the Oxus was apparently burnt to the ground in about 145 BC. The last Greco-Bactrian king, Heliocles I, retreated and moved his capital to the Kabul Valley. In about 140–130 BC, the Greco-Bactrian state was conquered by the nomads and dissolved. The Greek geographer Strabo mentions this event in his account of the central Asian tribes he called &quot;Scythians&quot;: 
Writing in the 1st century BC, the Roman historian Pompeius Trogus attributed the destruction of the Greco-Bactrian state to the Sacaraucae and the Asiani &quot;kings of the Tochari&quot;. Both Pompeius and the Roman historian Justin (2nd century AD) record that the Parthian king Artabanus II was mortally wounded in a war against the Tochari in 124 BC. Several relationships between these tribes and those named in Chinese sources have been proposed, but remain contentious.

After they settled in Bactria, the Yuezhi became Hellenized to some degree – as shown by their adoption of the Greek alphabet and by some remaining coins, minted in the style of the Greco-Bactrian kings, with the text in Greek.

====Noin-Ula carpets====
According to Sergey Yatsenko, the carpets with vivid embroidered scenes discovered in Noin-Ula were made by the Yuezhi in Bactria, and were obtained by the Xiongnu through commercial exchange or tributary payment, as the Yuezhi may have remained tributaries of the Xiongnu for a long time following their defeat. Embroidered carpets were among the highest-prized luxury items for the Xiongnu. The figures depicted in the carpets are believed to reflect the clothing and customs of the Yuezhi while they were in Bactria in the 1st century BCE-1st century CE.

====Tillya Tepe====

The graves of Tillya Tepe, complete with numerous artifacts, dated to the period between the 1st century BCE and the 1st century CE, probably belonged to the Yuezhis/early Kushans after the fall of the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom and before the rise of the Kushan Empire. They correspond to a time when the Yuezhis had not yet encountered Buddhism.

===In the Hindu Kush===
The area of the Hindu Kush (Paropamisadae) was ruled by the western Indo-Greek king until the reign of Hermaeus (reigned –70 BC). After that date, no Indo-Greek kings are known in the area. According to Bopearachchi, no trace of Indo-Scythian occupation (nor coins of major Indo-Scythian rulers such as Maues or Azes I) have been found in the Paropamisade and western Gandhara. The Hindu Kush may have been subsumed by the Yuezhi, who by then had been dominated by Greco-Bactria for almost two centuries.

As they had done in Bactria with their copying of Greco-Bactrian coinage, the Yuezhi copied the coinage of Hermeaus on a vast scale, up to around 40 AD, when the design blends into the coinage of the Kushan king Kujula Kadphises. Such coins may provide the earliest known names of Yuezhi &quot;yabgu&quot; (a minor royal title, similar to prince), namely Sapadbizes and/or Agesiles, who both lived in or about 20 BC.

===Kushan Empire===

After that point, they extended their control over the northwestern area of the Indian subcontinent, founding the Kushan Empire, which was to rule the region for several centuries. Despite their change of name, most Chinese authors continued to refer to the Kushanas as the Yuezhi.

The Kushanas expanded to the east during the 1st century AD. The first Kushan emperor, Kujula Kadphises, ostensibly associated himself with King Hermaeus on his coins.

The Kushanas integrated Buddhism into a pantheon of many deities and became great promoters of Mahayana Buddhism, and their interactions with Greek civilization helped the Gandharan culture and Greco-Buddhism flourish.

During the 1st and 2nd centuries, the Kushan Empire expanded militarily to the north and occupied parts of the Tarim Basin, putting them at the center of the lucrative Central Asian commerce with the Roman Empire. The Kushanas collaborated militarily with the Chinese against their mutual enemies. This included a campaign with the Chinese general Ban Chao against the Sogdians in 84 CE, when the latter were trying to support a revolt by the king of Kashgar. In around AD 85, the Kushanas also assisted the Chinese in an attack on Turpan, east of the Tarim Basin.

Following the military support provided to the Han, the Kushan emperor requested a marriage alliance with a Han princess and sent gifts to the Chinese court in expectation that this would occur. After the Han court refused, a Kushan army 70,000 strong marched on Ban Chao in 86 AD. The army was apparently exhausted by the time it reached its objective and was defeated by the Chinese force. The Kushanas retreated and later paid tribute to the Chinese emperor Han He (89–106).

In about 120 AD, Kushan troops installed Chenpan—a prince who had been sent as a hostage to them and had become a favorite of the Kushan Emperor—on the throne of Kashgar, thus expanding their power and influence in the Tarim Basin. There they introduced the Brahmi script, the Indian Prakrit language for administration, and Greco-Buddhist art, which developed into Serindian art.
Following this territorial expansion, the Kushanas introduced Buddhism to northern and northeastern Asia, by both direct missionary efforts and the translation of Buddhist scriptures into Chinese. Major Kushan missionaries and translators included Lokaksema (born ) and Dharmaraksa (), both of whom were influential translators of the Mahayana sutras into Chinese. They went to China and established translation bureaus, thereby being at the center of the Silk Road transmission of Buddhism.

In the &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot; (chap. 3), it was recorded that in 229 AD, &quot;The king of the Da Yuezhi [Kushanas], Bodiao 波調 (Vasudeva I), sent his envoy to present tribute, and His Majesty (Emperor Cao Rui) granted him the title of King of the Da Yuezhi Intimate with the Wei (Ch: 親魏大月氏王, &quot;Qīn Wèi Dà Yuèzhī Wáng&quot;).&quot;

Soon afterwards, the military power of the Kushanas began to decline. The rival Sasanian Empire of Persia extended its dominion into Bactria during the reign of Ardashir I around 230 CE. The Sasanians also occupied neighboring Sogdia by 260 AD and made it into a satrapy.

During the course of the 3rd and 4th centuries, the Kushan Empire was divided and conquered by the Sasanians, the Hephthalite tribes from the north, and the Gupta and Yaudheya empires from India.

==Later references to the Lesser Yuezhi==

&quot;Xiao Yuezhi&quot; refers to the less militarized Yuezhi who settled in northern China (following the migration of the Greater Yuezhi). The term is used of peoples in locations as diverse as Tibet, Qinghai, Shanxi and the Tarim Basin.

Some of the Lesser Yuezhi settled among the Qiang people of Huangzhong, Qinghai, according to archaeologist Sophia-Katrin Psarras. Yuezhi and Qiang were said to be among members of the Auxiliary of Loyal Barbarians From Huangzhong that mutinied against the Han dynasty, in the Liangzhou Rebellion (184–221 CE). The Lushuihu people, who founded the Northern Liang dynasty (397–439), have been theorized by modern researchers to be descendants of the Lesser Yuezhi that intermingled with the Qiang.

Elements of the Lesser Yuezhi are said to have been part of the Jie people, who originated from Yushe County in Shanxi. Other theories link the Jie more strongly to the Xiongnu, Kangju, or the Tocharian-speaking peoples of the Tarim. Led by Shi Le (Emperor Ming of Later Zhao), the Jie people established the Later Zhao dynasty (319–351). The Jie populations were later massacred by Ran Min of the short-lived Ran Wei dynasty during the Ran Wei–Later Zhao war.

In Tibet, the &quot;Gar&quot; or &quot;mGar&quot; – a clan name associated with blacksmiths - may have been descended from the Lesser Yuezhi who resettled in Qiang in 162 BC.

A Chinese monk named Gao Juhui, who traveled from Kaifeng to Khotan in or about 938 CE, mentioned a people known in Chinese as &quot;Zhongyun&quot; (仲雲; Wade–Giles &quot;Tchong-yun&quot;), describing them as descendants of the Lesser Yuezhi. The Zhongyun were the founders of the city state of Cumuḍa (also &quot;Cimuda&quot; or &quot;Cunuda&quot;), south of Lop Nur in the eastern Tarim. (Following the subsequent settlement of Uyghur-speaking people in the area, Cumuḍa became known as &quot;Čungul&quot;, &quot;Xungul&quot; and &quot;Kumul&quot;. Under subsequent Han Chinese influence, it became known as Hami.)

Before the middle of the 1st millennium, the &quot;Xiao Yuezhi&quot; had ceased to be identifiable by that name and appear to have been subsumed by other ethnicities, including Tibetans, Uyghurs and Han.

== Proposed links to other groups ==
The relationship between the Yuezhi and other Central Asian peoples is unclear. Based on claimed similarities of names, different scholars have linked them to several groups, but none of these identifications is widely accepted.

Mallory and Mair suggest that the Yuezhi and Wusun were among the nomadic peoples, at least some of whom spoke Iranian languages, who moved into northern Xinjiang from the Central Asian steppe in the 2nd millennium BC.

Scholars such as Edwin Pulleyblank, Josef Markwart, and László Torday, suggest that the name &quot;Iatioi&quot;—a Central Asian people mentioned by Ptolemy in &quot;Geography&quot; (AD 150)—may also be an attempt to render Yuezhi.

There has been only limited scholarly support for a theory developed by W. B. Henning, who proposed that the Yuezhi were descended from the Guti (or Gutians) and an associated, but little known tribe known as the Tukri, who were native to the Zagros Mountains (modern Iran and Iraq), during the mid-3rd millennium BC. In addition to phonological similarities between these names and &quot;*ŋʷjat-kje&quot; and Tukhāra, Henning pointed out that the Guti could have migrated from the Zagros to Gansu, by the time that the Yuezhi entered the historical record in China, during the 1st millennium BC. However, the only material evidence presented by Henning, namely similar ceramic ware, is generally considered to be far from conclusive.

Proposed links with the Aorsi, Asii, Getae, Goths, Gushi, Massagetae, and other groups have also gathered little support.

===Yuezhi-Tocharian hypothesis===
When manuscripts dating from the 6th to 8th centuries AD written in two hitherto unknown Indo-European languages were discovered in the northern Tarim Basin, the early 20th-century linguist Friedrich W. K. Müller identified them with the enigmatic &quot;&quot;twγry&quot; (&quot;Toγari&quot;) language&quot; used to translate Indian Buddhist Sanskrit texts and mentioned as the source of an Old Turkic (Uyghur) manuscript. 

Müller then proposed to connect the name &quot;Toγari&quot; (Togar/Tokar) to the &quot;Tókharoi&quot; people of Tokharistan (themselves associated with the Yuezhi) described in early Greek histories. He thus referred to the newly discovered languages as &quot;Tocharian&quot;, which became the common name for both the languages of the Tarim manuscripts and the people who produced them. Most historians have been rejecting the identification of the Tocharians of the Tarim with the &quot;Tókharoi&quot; of Bactria, mainly because they are not known to have spoken any languages other than Bactrian, a quite dissimilar Eastern Iranian language. Other scholars suggest that the Yuezhi/Kushanas may previously have spoken Tocharian before shifting to Bactrian on their arrival in Bactria, an example of an invading or colonising elite adopting a local language (as also seen for the Greeks, the Turks or the Arabs upon their successive settlements in Bactria). However, while Tocharian contains some loanwords from Bactrian, there are no traces of Tocharian in Bactrian.

Another possible endonym of the Yuezhi was put forward by H. W. Bailey, who claimed that they were referred to, in 9th and 10th century Khotan Saka Iranian texts, as the &quot;Gara&quot;. According to Bailey, the &quot;Tu Gara&quot; (&quot;Great Gara&quot;) were the Great Yuezhi. This is consistent with the Ancient Greek Τόχαροι &quot;Tokharoi&quot; (Latinised &quot;Tochari&quot;) in reference to the faction of the Kushans that conquered Bactria, as well as the Tibetan language name &quot;Gar&quot; (or &quot;mGar&quot;), for the members of the Lesser Yuezhi who settled in the Tibetan Empire.

Hakan Aydemir, assistant professor at Istanbul Medeniyet University, reconstructs the ethnonym *&quot;Arki&quot; ~ *&quot;Yarki&quot; which underlay Chinese transcriptions 月氏 and 月支 as well as various other foreign transcriptions and Tocharian A ethnonym &quot;Ārśi&quot;. Aydemir suggests that *&quot;Arki&quot; ~ *&quot;Yarki&quot; is etymologically Indo-European.

===Nomadic artifacts in Gansu and Ningxia (5th-4th century BC)===

Numerous nomadic artifacts are attributed to the areas of southern Ningxia and southeastern Gansu during the period of the 5th-4th century BC. They are quite similar to the works of the nomadic Ordos culture further east, and reflect strong Scythian influences. Some of these artifacts were sinicized by the neighbouring Qin state in China, probably also for nomadic consumption. Nomadic figures with long noses riding on a camel also appear regularly in southern Ningxia from the 4th century BC. Particularly, the Shajing culture (700–100 BCE) of Gansu has been proposed as a candidate for the origin of the Yuezhi.

===Shirenzigou culture===
Looking at the archaeological and genetic evidence, another area of origin on the northeastern border of the Tarim Basin has also been proposed: the Yuegongtai-Xiheigou (岳公台-西黑沟) archaeological sites, corresponding to the Shirenzigou culture and Barkol culture in the Barkol County of Xinjiang. This would have positionned the Yuezhi between the Subeshi culture to their west, the Yanbulaq culture to their east, the aftermaths of the Chemurchek culture to the north, and a wide desertical area to south about a thousand kilometers away from the Central Plains of China.

<text>The Morris Marina is a front-engined, rear-wheel-drive small family car that was manufactured by the Austin-Morris division of British Leyland from 1971 until 1980. It served to replace the Morris Minor in the Morris product line, which had first been built in 1948. The Marina was also sold in some markets as the Austin Marina, the Leyland Marina and the Morris 1700.

It was a popular car in Britain throughout its production life, beating its main rival, the Ford Escort, to second place in UK car sales in 1973 and taking third or fourth place (behind the Escort) in other years. The car was exported throughout the world, including North America, and assembled in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Malaysia. A total of 1.2 million were built.

According to various sources, the Marina ranks among the worst cars ever built.

The 1980 replacement for the Marina, the Ital, was the same car with only mild styling changes. It was only fully replaced by the Austin Montego in 1984.

British Leyland sold the Marina alongside the 1969 Austin Maxi, which shared the same market segment but used front-wheel-drive and had a hatchback body, and the 1973 Austin Allegro, which used front-wheel-drive and more adventurous styling.

==Development==

The Marina was developed under the ADO28 codename. The impetus for its development came when Leyland Motors merged with British Motor Holdings (BMH) in 1968, thus forming British Leyland (BL). BMH was the corporate parent of the two biggest car manufacturers in the UK, Austin and Morris. The new BL management, made largely from ex-Leyland Motors staff, were shocked to learn that apart from the Austin Maxi (then entering the final stages of development) and a tentative design for a replacement for the Mini (the 9X) BMH had no new cars under development. The company&#x27;s products aimed at the mass-market consisted of the Morris Minor, dating from 1948, and the 1100/1300 range of mid-sized Austin and Morris saloons that were a decade old. BL rapidly implemented a plan to develop a replacement for both the Minor and the smaller Farina models that could be produced as quickly as possible and would be on sale for no more than five years until a genuinely &quot;all new&quot; product could be launched in its place.

To try to introduce some clear distinctions between its multiple brands BL decided to release conservative, traditionally engineered cars under the Morris name, and sell more adventurous cars as Austins, or even as new marques – such as the Austin Allegro and Princess, the former of which occupied the same small family car segment as the Marina would. Specifically this meant that Austins use the groundbreaking transverse-engine front-wheel-drive layout developed by Alec Issigonis. It was thus decided that the ADO28 would be badged as a Morris.

The Marina would use a conventional rear-wheel drive, live rear axle drive-train as found on other popular mass-market cars such as the Ford Escort and Vauxhall Viva. This strategy was also intended to improve sales in BL&#x27;s export markets. Commonwealth markets such as South Africa, Australia and New Zealand were large buyers of BL products, but the innovative BMC cars were considered too fragile and complex for use in such countries, as well as being fitted exclusively with small, low-powered engines. As a result, the Marina was unadventurous but simple, making use of existing BMC components derived from the Morris Minor and MGB, as well as using mainly Triumph Dolomite transmission and running gear from the former Leyland side of the organisation.

The car was designed by Roy Haynes, the same man who designed the Ford Cortina Mark II (launched in 1966), with which it shares some stylistic similarities. Lacking the budget to develop two cars to compete directly with the Escort and the Cortina, the makers sized the ADO28 between the two benchmark Ford models. Haynes&#x27; original idea was to produce the car in coupé and saloon versions with the coupé pitched as a premium, sporting version, in a similar mould to the Ford Capri – a popular coupé based on Cortina running gear – to appeal to younger buyers, while the saloon was for the crucial company car market and families. Harris Mann, Haynes&#x27; assistant, designed the door handles, which he would later copy for the Austin Allegro and Triumph TR7.

Haynes also attempted to put forward a system that many manufacturers now use: a common floor pan shared between models. The Marina was the first car design that used this idea. Although this idea carried great potential benefits for a company selling cars under numerous different brands across multiple market sectors it was looked on as too radical by the management of British Leyland and Triumph designer Harry Webster was drafted in to push the project forward. Roy Haynes soon left the company, and Harris Mann replaced him as chief designer.

The British Leyland Board decided to build the Marina at the ex-Morris Motors plant at Cowley in Oxford, which was largely still as it was in the 1920s. The plant had insufficient capacity – British manufacturers had difficulties in meeting demand in the post-war years – which increased design and production costs significantly, since Leyland had to rebuild the plant.

The Marina was originally designed to use the E-series overhead cam BMC engines. These engines had a number of design problems. A modular engine design, the E series had standard bores, with capacity increased by using either more cylinders or larger strokes. However, small-capacity sixes fell out of favour as post-war Britain became increasingly affluent.

To increase capacity, BL preferred increasing stroke, which added little to the cost of production. This resulted in a tall engine. It was not possible to slant the engine, because of the location of the fuel pump. Furthermore, the engine had to be &quot;siamesed&quot;, that is, the water jacket was shared between pairs of cylinders. These factors contributed to overheating and oil burning in the Austin Maxi, and so the board decided to adopt the more reliable A and B- series engines for indigenous production. (Australia and South Africa continued with the E series.) However, the body had already been designed, so the Marina was forever cursed with a &quot;full nappy&quot; rear-end styling, needed to even the lines between the necessarily bloated front and the rear.

The engine assembly line was bifurcated by a municipal road; Leyland had to build an overpass, further increasing cost. The Birmingham local authority then agreed to sell the road to Leyland &quot;after&quot; the overpass had been completed. This increased the cost even further.

Numerous redesigns also meant that the final design of the Marina was rushed, as the project&#x27;s final deadline grew near. The car went from design stage to production in just 18 months. Consequently, the board decided to cut costs and abandon Macpherson struts in favour of an old design from the Morris Minor. They also abandoned a project to design a new 4-speed BMC gearbox. As a further cost-cutting measure the coupé version of the Marina would now use the same front doors as the saloon version. This produced significant cost savings in tooling and assembly, but left the coupé as obvious styling derivative of the saloon rather than having a different, more sporting image as Roy Haynes had originally proposed. This made it impossible to pitch the coupé as a superior product, and so it was decided that the 2-door coupé version of the Marina would be the cheaper of the two body styles, with the 1.3-litre model directly replacing the entry-level 2-door version of the Morris Minor and competing with the 2-door saloon versions of the Ford Escort and the Hillman Avenger.

Meanwhile, the 1.8-litre coupé models had no direct predecessor in the BL range and the closest equivalents were the sporting Ford Capri and the new Vauxhall Firenza. This gave the coupé a rather conflicted image – the sporty bodystyle led many buyers and testers to have expectations of the Marina coupé that the final product was never intended to meet, being mechanically identical to the standard saloon version. The Marina saloons more obvious market placements; the 1.3-litre saloon replaced the 4-door Minor while the 1.8-litre version superseded the Austin and Morris Farina saloons and the 1.8-litre Marina estate did the same for the outgoing estate versions of the Farina. The dashboard also suffered from being ergonomically illogical, with the radio and warning light controls facing away from the driver towards the passenger seat.

The indigenous engines were the venerable A-Series and B-Series units in 1.3- and 1.8-litre capacities, respectively, which drove rear wheels through a live axle. It featured torsion bar suspension at the front, leaf-spring suspension at the rear. An estate (station wagon) came in 1972, 18 months after the saloon and coupé, giving British Leyland a full-circle competitor for the Cortina and Capri. Five body styles were available all in all: saloon, estate, coupé, pickup, and van. For extra performance, TC versions were equipped with a twin carburettor engine similar to that in the MG MGB for extra performance. These could be fitted with a body kit from BL Special Tuning that added front and rear spoilers, alloy wheels, extra lighting and other details. A 1.5-litre diesel version, using an engine developed from the B-Series, was offered in a few European countries where the tax rates favoured diesels. With no more than 37 or 40 hp on offer depending on the source, performance was often lethargic; 3,870 diesels were built between 1977 and 1980. They were never sold in Britain, where diesel engines were almost unheard of in passenger cars.

==Launch and subsequent updates==

The new car was launched on the domestic market on 27 April 1971, with a night shift added at the Cowley plant in May 1971. At that time the manufacturers reported they were producing 2,000 cars per week, projecting over-optimistically to increase this to 5,000 cars per week by the end of 1971. Nevertheless, eleven months after launch, on 29 March 1972, the 100,000th Marina, a 1.8TC version, emerged from the Cowley plant and by February 1973 the company was able to announce that 250,000 Marinas had already been built in less than two years. The Marina continued in production from 1971 to 1980, when it was replaced by the Morris Ital (an updated version of the Marina) which continued in production until 1984, when the Morris marque was axed and the Austin badge featured on the Montego that replaced it, signalling the end of the Morris brand after more than 70 years. (With the discontinuation of the Morris 18-22 – also sold as an Austin and Wolseley – the Marina car and the Ital were the only non-commercial vehicles sold with the Morris badge after 1975).

In Australia and South Africa it was known as the Leyland Marina, in New Zealand as the Morris 1.7 (for 1979–81, in facelifted O-Series form) and in North America as the Austin Marina.

The car was popular with families and undemanding car buyers and was available in the typical BL colours of the dayRusset Brown, Harvest Gold, Limeflower Green, Midnight Blue, Teal Blue, Blaze Orange, Damask Red and a characteristically 1970s purple called Black Tulip. It was intended to compete with the generally similar Ford Cortina (and to some extent the smaller Escort); the Vauxhall Viva and later the larger Cavalier; as well as the Hillman Avenger and Hunter from Chrysler UK. It shared its basic styling with all these cars, adopting a supposedly transatlantic look that took elements of car styling from contemporary American cars (especially the front-end treatment in the Marina&#x27;s case) and offered them at a scale acceptable to the European market. As with its mechanics, the Marina was not intended to be visually innovative or particularly interestingits Austin Allegro stablemate was the entry in that area of the market. A point of criticism with the Marina was that the windscreen-wiper set-up was &quot;opposite&quot; the driver. This was decided pre-production after drivers of the prototypes reported that airflow at certain speeds made the wiper closest to the A-post lift off the windscreen, potentially disrupting the driver&#x27;s line of sight. The problem was judged sufficiently serious that the car went on sale with a wiper position as if for driving on the other side of the road, though subsequent road testers questioned the effectiveness of this decision and the basis for it.

BL was beset with problems including industrial action throughout the period, and the Marina was one of a number of models that suffered. While the labour disputes at BL eroded employment, manufacturers in Europe and Japan introduced innovative designs (such as the VW Golf) with which the Marina and its like were never likely to compete. Problems were compounded as the cars to replace the Marina and BL&#x27;s other mid-size offerings were repeatedly delayed (eventually appearing as the Austin Maestro and Austin Montego in 1983 and 1984 respectively). By this time Leyland had abandoned the idea of separate Austin and Morris ranges. There was not enough money to develop a full range of rear-wheel-drive Morris cars and an equivalent front-wheel-drive (FWD) Austin range, and FWD was increasingly accepted across the market.

There were changes, however, albeit small ones. A facelift in 1975 gave the Marina new radiator grilles, dashboard, seats, suspension modifications and increased soundproofing. In May 1977, Marinas started to appear at dealers equipped with Allegro style seats: apart from rationalising the procuring and production processes, this was said to make the Marina seating more comfortable and supportive. The overhead camshaft O-Series engine (also used for Leyland Princess) appeared in 1.7-litre form in 1978 to replace the larger B-Series 1.8-litre models. A changed grille, including driving lights, a front spoiler and redesigned bumpers and rear lights, were added to all models.

Under severe financial strain, BL was bailed out by the government under the Ryder Report of 1975, and Sir Michael Edwardes was brought in to oversee the company. Under his leadership, BL made an attempt to update the Marina, by enlisting the help of Giorgetto Giugiaro&#x27;s Italdesign. ItalDesign, however, did not design the car, which was an in-house product — it merely made changes to its appearance. The result of this exercise, the 1980 Morris Ital features large rear-lamp clusters and a new front end, but the 1971 vintage of the design was obvious. The Ital lasted four years and was replaced by the Austin Montego in early 1984.

==Popularity==

The Marina&#x27;s public life did not get off to a good start. The rushed final stages of design and production, especially in regard to the suspension, meant that many of the press fleet cars had an incorrect front-suspension set-up, whereby there was no camber change when the car rolled, which in turn produced &quot;almost heroic&quot; levels of understeer: &quot;Autocar&quot; reported that the car they were driving ended up on the wrong side of the road when taking a sharp corner. This was a particular problem with the more powerful 1.8 and 1.8 TC cars, which were unfortunately the models the press were most likely to test, though the 1.3-litre models, having a lighter engine, did not suffer from the problem to the same extent. Early production Marinas were fitted with the original front suspension, although a different lower link-arm (trunnion) was fitted quite quickly. The best estimate is that about 30,000 cars with the original suspension were sold to the public: many, though not all, had their front suspension set-up retrospectively corrected by dealers and before September 1971, less than six months after launch, front-suspension &quot;uprights&quot; were being modified on the production line. The Marina was never intended, or designed, to have particularly exciting or sharp handling, but the early problems led to less-than-flattering road-test reports and it was undeniable that the Marina&#x27;s handling always tended towards understeer, which for a rear-wheel-drive car was unusual, and towards body-roll. &quot;What Car?&quot; magazine, in a typical review, described the understeer as &quot;noticeable&quot;, but called the car as a whole &quot;unobtrusively well designed&quot;.
More comprehensive suspension changes were made with the Mark 2&#x27;s introduction in 1975, which added anti-roll bars that calmed the earlier car&#x27;s wayward tendencies. In 1982 the Ital changed its Marina-derived front lever-arm shock absorbers for telescopic ones.

Despite heavy criticism from the media and motoring press, the car&#x27;s lack of technical sophistication let it be keenly priced. The Morris Marina was a very popular car in Britain, and was among the country&#x27;s best sellers throughout its production life, peaking at second place in 1973 — only surpassed by the Ford Cortina. In many ways, the car fulfilled its design goal of being an unpretentious, high volume, mass-market car for average-income families and business people.

The deliberately simple and apparently old-fashioned design of the Marina was intended mainly to appeal to company-car and corporate-fleet buyers. This market was dominated by Ford with the Escort and Cortina. BL&#x27;s Austin products, with their advanced front-wheel drive and suspension systems were more expensive to buy and more costly to maintain, and so suffered poorer sales in these crucial markets. The Marina&#x27;s front-engined, rear-wheel-drive, live-rear-axle layout was identical to the Ford products and most other mass-production saloons of the day. Although Ford remained dominant by a large margin, the Marina did succeed in capturing a larger share of the fleet/hire market and this contributed to its high sales. However, its image remained as a rather dull, workaday vehicle.

Marina production lasted almost ten years and in that time no fewer than 807,000 were sold across Britain, though it was less popular on export markets. By the time production of the facelifted Ital version ceased production in 1984, total Marina/Ital production had topped 1.2 million, making it BL&#x27;s second biggest seller after the Mini. In fact, of all the post Ryder Report models that BL and its successors produced, only the Austin Metro would surpass the Marina&#x27;s sales. Whilst intended as a stop-gap design until a more up-to-date replacement could be developed, the problems faced by British Leyland in the mid-to-late 1970s meant that the Marina remained in production essentially unchanged, other than some light facelifts and interior changes. Coupled with the continuing quality problems suffered by the car and the increasingly poor perception of BL cars as a whole, this sealed the Marina&#x27;s reputation, despite its high sales. Even when Marina production ended in 1980, a modified version of it survived until 1984 as the Ital. British Leyland had been working on an all-new replacement for the Marina by 1980, but it was too early in the development stages to enter production, with production not beginning until early 1984, when the new car, called the Austin Montego, was launched.

Over the years, it has frequently been described by journalists, authors and motoring critics as one of the worst cars of all time. The relaunching of the then decade-old design as the Morris Ital only added to the image of an outdated, outclassed, and poor-performing vehicle.

===Legacy===
A survey conducted by &quot;Auto Express&quot; magazine in August 2006 reported that 745 of the 807,000 Marinas sold in Britain were still on the road, fewer than one of every thousand sold, making it the most-scrapped car sold in Britain over the previous 30 years. The low survival rate is due to a combination of factors, chief amongst which is the Marina&#x27;s poor rust-proofing. Like other family saloon cars of the period, the Marina did not gain the status of a classic car, whilst large numbers were still in good enough condition to encourage preservation. The Marina also made a good donor car for several other British Leyland models. The brakes and suspension from a Marina were/are often used to upgrade the Morris Minor, whilst the A and B-Series engines were used in a wide variety of other cars. The 1275 cc A Series, for example, made an easy performance improvement for a Midget or Sprite, whilst the twin-carb B-Series engine used in the TC versions of the Marina fitted the MGB without any modifications needed, and the TC engine carried a slightly higher power output. Factors such as these meant that elderly Marinas were more likely to be stripped for parts to upgrade more popular models than to be repaired or restored.

Ironically, the greatest contribution the Marina made to the automotive world was in South Korea. When George Turnbull was hired by the Hyundai conglomerate in 1974 to head up their effort to create an indigenous Korean automobile, he brought with him from the UK two Morris Marinas, a coupe and a saloon and hired a number of British engineers who had worked on the Marina project or for British Leyland. Their first product, a reworked Marina equipped with Mitsubishi engines and transmissions, and a four door hatch back body restyled from the two door coupe by Italdesign Giugiaro, was the Hyundai Pony, whose global success turned Hyundai into a major automotive manufacturer.

In February 2016, it was reported that the number of Marinas still in use on UK roads was 295, although this figure does not count examples which are SORN.

As of December 2019, there are currently 374 Marinas on the road in the UK, with a further 498 currently SORN.

==Running gear==

The Marina was a conventional design, a fully unitary spot-welded body (no sub-frames were used except on the six-cylinder) with a longitudinally mounted engine driving through the transmission and naked propeller shaft to a solid live rear axle suspended on semi-elliptic leaf springs with telescopic dampers. To ease production and reduce costs, the body featured a strong central spine around the transmission tunnel, where most of the unit&#x27;s strength was. The rear dampers were inclined inboard from the axle to their top mounts on this spine, rather than being mounted vertically on dedicated top mounts built into the body at the rear-wheel arches. This limited the effectiveness of the dampers somewhat (they were dissipating vertical motion when mounted at an angle), and when combined with the live rear axle, made the rear end prone to &quot;bump steer&quot; on rough roads. A similar setup was used on the early Ford Escort for the same reasons of cost-effective construction, but Ford revised the arrangement on later models. BL lacked the funds to retool the Marina&#x27;s design significantly, and so all models were fitted in this less-than-ideal way.

The front suspension was closely derived from that on the Morris Minor, using longitudinal torsion bars for springing. The rest of the front suspension consisted of lower arms pivoting on trunnions with upper ball joints supporting the wheel and acting on hydraulic lever arm dampers. These provided superior ride comfort over rough roads when compared to early telescopic dampers, but at the expense of sloppy handling and body control at high speeds. Improvements in road surfaces, the development of the motorway network, the huge increase in the performance of even standard family cars and advances in the design of telescopic dampers since the Minor was launched in 1948 made this type of damper obsolete by 1971. Nonetheless it was adopted to keep development and tooling costs to a minimum.

British Leyland&#x27;s Special Tuning department (which primarily handled development of BL&#x27;s works&#x27; motor-sport cars and technical support to private entries using BL products) produced a variety of upgrades for the Marina, which were (technically) available on road cars through special order. Amongst the S/T products were a kit to adapt the front suspension to use telescopic dampers (eventually fitted to the Ital), and adaptor kits to convert the rear dampers to a more effective vertical orientation using separate turrets. The S/T suspension upgrades produced significant improvements in handling and ride over the standard Marina, but were not widely publicised on the general market.

The troublesome manual gearbox was a four-speed unit with synchromesh on all gears except reverse, and was derived from the Triumph Toledo unit, controlled by a floor-mounted lever. Automatic transmission was a conventional Borg Warner Type 35 three-speed transmission and was offered at extra cost.

==North America==
The Marina was available in the United States as the Austin Marina from 1973 to 1975 in two and four-door forms. It was marketed as an Austin, because Morris was a virtually unknown brand in the US, and to capitalise on the success of the Austin-Healey marque. The 1973 model still had the normal small bumpers, but the 1974/5 models had large bumpers to comply with new US regulations. It was only produced with the 1.8-litre engine, and was soon strangled by the emissions equipment that U.S. law required — an air pump and exhaust air injection. The US government soon accused BL of dumping cars in the US, which, combined with tales of poor quality, made it a poor seller, and they were not exported to the US after 1975.

The Marina was also marketed in Canada as the Austin Marina, in two-door coupé (coupe) and four-door saloon (sedan) forms, from 1972 to 1978, using only the 1.8-litre engine, fitted with US-style heavier bumpers and emissions equipment. Sales ceased when the 1.8 was replaced by a 1.7-litre engine, which was not emissions-certified in Canada. While its simple rear-wheel-drive layout and mechanicals appealed to many Canadian drivers, the Marina&#x27;s body was prone to extremely fast rust-out on the salted winter roads of eastern Canada, which limited sales in later years.

==Denmark==
In Denmark, the Morris 1100 &amp; Morris 1300 models were marketed under the Morris Marina name from 1962 to 1972.

==Australia==
The Marina was introduced to the Australian market in April 1972 as the Morris Marina and then, following a change in marketing policy, sold there from 1973 under the Leyland Marina name. From that time a restyled grille was used on all models. The Australian Marina, which was sold in sedan and coupé forms only, used the OHC E-Series four-cylinder motor in 1500 cc, 1750 cc and 1750 cc twin carburettor form. Additionally, in an attempt to compete with the Holden Torana and Ford Cortina 6-cylinder models, the Marina was also offered from November 1973 with a 121 hp (90 kW) 2600 cc E-series six-cylinder engine. This indigenous Marina variant was capable of 0–60 mph in under nine seconds.

The Australian Marinas were built from CKD kits sent from Cowley in England, but used high levels of local content, including different running gear, axle, interiors, seals, seats, uprated dampers and mounts, uprated wheels and a higher grade of fit and finish. The Marina Six used a separate front sub-frame to support the weight of the Big Red engine and different front torsion bars as well as a pair of rear radius arms in an attempt to improve handling. Base model featured a 3-speed manual gearbox – sourced locally from Borg-Warner – to meet local content requirements. The Borg-Warner automatic was, however, the variation most popular in the local market.

Surprisingly, the three-speed manual gearbox, was mechanically a four-speed box with first gear blanked off. This was done due to the perceived high torque of the engine, so that first gear was deemed unnecessary.

Leyland Australia were known for their own development and a version of the Rover V8 was converted into a V6 and test fitted to a Marina saloon. Production of the Marina in Australia ended in 1975, when Leyland Australia&#x27;s Victoria Park, Zetland factory (home of the Leyland P76) closed. A replacement model, the P82, was under development in 1974, but did not reach production. Over 30,000 Marinas were produced in Australia.
==New Zealand==

The Morris Marina was a popular car on the New Zealand market, imported by the New Zealand Motor Corporation. Imports began with built-up British-sourced saloons and coupes (in 1.3- and 1.8-litre forms) in 1971. Local assembly of Australian-sourced (E-Series engines) models began in 1972 after the release of the Marinas there. Six-cylinder models were added in 1973. In 1974, before the termination of Leyland Australia&#x27;s manufacturing operations, local assembly switched to British-sourced models again in saloon, estate, van and pick-up forms. Batches of fully built UK-sourced cars also came in 1973 and 1974 when the government allowed additional import licences due to the inability of local assembly plants to keep pace with demand for new cars.

In 1979 the Marina received a face lift and the BL O-Series OHC 1.7-litre engine. However, at the time the Marina name was held in low regard by the New Zealand public, and was dropped, the car being renamed Morris 1700. The Morris 1700 had high equipment levels and included front spoilers and driving lights on all models. The related van and pick-up models were renamed Morris 575.

Production of the car ceased in 1981. It was replaced locally by an expanded range of NZMC Honda products.

==South Africa==
As in Australia, the car received the E-series engine, but was marketed as the Austin Marina. The 1.75-litre four and the 2.6-litre six were offered. Power outputs are . The 2600 was also available with a three-speed Borg Warner Type 35 automatic gearbox. After a June 1976 face lift, including a new grille with integrated spotlights and a redone interior, the 1750 became available with the automatic while the manual 2600 was dropped. This face-lift version was called the Marina Series III. The new padded dashboard was of a unified swept design with an integrated binnacle for the instruments, and had been used in British Marinas since the 1975 face lift.

The 1.3 motor was offered from 1976 until 1978, but the build quality combined with the grossly underpowered 1.3 version (particularly for the South African Highveld where heat and altitude cut engine performance by up to 20%) made it an absolute failure. The remnants of the production run were sold off at up to 50% discount on their list price.

==Rallying==
In 1970 Donald Stokes ordered the BMC Competitions Department closed and disbanded. By the time the Marina appeared, it was becoming obvious that Stage Rallying was gaining popularity, and in early 1971 it was decided to use the new model in the November 1971 RAC rally. Luckily for BL, Special Tuning had a rally driver on its books by the name of Brian Culcheth and so with no team, no mechanics, no funding and initially no sponsorship a team of talented engineers developed a 1.3 coupé into a rally car, funded purely by sales of performance parts from Special Tuning.

Knowing that the 1.8-litre engine was too heavy for decent handling, they concentrated on the 1.3-litre engine and using Mini components got good horsepower figures from it; then they played a flanker to pen the field in the 1.3 classes. All rally teams used one particular course to test, so the car was fitted with a full-race 1.8 and blasted around the track in front of the Ford rally team – consequently they withdrew from the 1.3 class allowing the car to claim 1st in Class for the 1971 Rally.

Subsequently, the car was entered in 17 more national and international rallies up to 1975, either being placed or winning class honours in twelve of them, the others being crashes/failures. In South Africa, the local Leyland subsidiary also rallied the Marina for several years. These were serious machines, fitted originally with the Rover V8 and later with a 200-horsepower Triumph Dolomite Sprint engine. Leykor chose the heavier and less powerful Dolomite engine since more performance parts, including a close-ratio five-speed transmission, were available. With the appearance of the SD1 this situation changed again, but the Dolomite engine was used into 1977 at least.

For 1976 BL management decided to move to the Triumph Dolomite Sprint for its main rallying vehicle.

In 1974 Foden commissioned a Rover V8-engined Marina to compete in the UDT London–Sahara–Sydney Marathon rally. Driven by Major John Hemsley and Major John Skinner, the car stormed through several stages before suffering rear-axle failure in the desert. John Hemsley started the rally with his left arm in a cast having broken his wrist, leaving John Skinner to change gear for him during the special stages. The rear axle had been the only part obtained from a non-BL source.

==Post-demise==
In 1974, George Turnbull retired from BL and took two Marinas, one saloon and one coupé, to the automotive division of the Hyundai conglomerate Korea, which was interested in developing its own car, instead of assembling Ford and Mitsubishi automobiles under licence. Hyundai took the Marinas and developed the Hyundai Pony from them, in three, four and five-door variants, a station wagon, and a pick-up, kick-starting the company&#x27;s ascendancy in car manufacturing.

The Marina lived on in many smaller ways: many parts from the Marina were used in other British Leyland vehicles. The door handles from the Marina were utilized in the Austin Allegro, Range Rover, Triumph TR7, and the first series of Land Rover Discovery, until 1998. They were also used by some models of the Reliant Scimitar, and by various Lotus cars, including some versions of the Lotus Esprit. The indicator switchgear, also used on the Triumph Stag, eventually became part of the Lamborghini Diablo. Marina-sourced gearboxes were used in the MG Midget 1500 version.

==&quot;Top Gear&quot;==
British television show &quot;Top Gear&quot; often displayed a running gag of destroying a Marina through various episodes. Notably, destruction of a Marina frequently involved the show&#x27;s hosts (Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond, and James May) dropping a piano onto the roof; Hammond once tried to avoid that by driving a Marina with a piano already on top of it, only for a second one to land on it as he was away from the car running to get a tool kit for a mechanical issue. The show received threats on the forum for the Morris Marina Owners&#x27; Club, whose members took issue with the destruction of the Marinas; the presenters responded by reading and mocking the forum posts in news segments. During a 2009 episode in which the hosts were tasked with entering an ice race in France, Clarkson claimed the Marina featured as the trio&#x27;s backup car was previously owned by the wife of the president - presumably of the Marina Owners&#x27; Club, but facetiously understood by the trio as Carla Bruni, wife of then-president Nicolas Sarkozy. Clarkson was adamant through the episode to preserve the Marina due to its high profile ownership, though the car was later destroyed in similar fashion with a piano being dropped on its roof following the race. In the &quot;Top Gear&quot; book &quot;Crap Cars&quot; by Richard Porter, the Marina was named fourth worst car of all time. However, presenter James May stated that at least one Marina should be preserved, as a warning to future generations.

<text>Michelle Jacquet Branch (born July 2, 1983) is an American singer, songwriter and guitarist. During the early 2000s, she won a Grammy Award for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals with Santana for their 2002 single, &quot;The Game of Love&quot;.

As a solo recording artist, Branch&#x27;s first album &quot;Broken Bracelet&quot; came out in 2000. After signing to Madonna&#x27;s Maverick record label the next year, her second album &quot;The Spirit Room&quot; followed and contained the singles &quot;Everywhere&quot; and &quot;All You Wanted&quot;. Her third album &quot;Hotel Paper&quot; was released in 2003. Two years later, she formed the country music duo the Wreckers with Jessica Harp, and produced the Grammy-nominated single &quot;Leave the Pieces&quot;. The Wreckers disbanded in 2007 to pursue their respective solo careers. Since then, she has released extended plays in 2010 and 2011, and a fourth solo album, &quot;Hopeless Romantic&quot; in 2017. Her fifth studio album, &quot;The Trouble with Fever&quot;, was released in 2022.

==Early life and education==

Branch was born on July 2, 1983, in Sedona, Arizona, to David and Peggy Branch. Her father is of partial Irish ancestry, and her mother is of Dutch-Indonesian (&quot;Indo&quot;) and French descent. Her maternal grandmother was held in a Japanese internment camp during World War II. After the war she moved to Holland, where Branch&#x27;s mother was born. Her mother was five years old when the family moved from the Netherlands to Arizona.

Beginning to sing at the age of three, Branch enrolled in voice lessons at Northern Arizona University when she was eight, and received her first guitar for her 14th birthday. After teaching herself chords, she composed her first song &quot;Fallen&quot; within a week of receiving her guitar. She initially attended Sedona Red Rock High School, but finished the last two years of her high school education through home schooling so that she could focus on her music career.

==Career==
===1983–2000: &quot;Broken Bracelet&quot;===
To support Branch&#x27;s interests, her parents helped her book local gigs in Sedona, and later financed her independent album &quot;Broken Bracelet&quot;. Her set list at these gigs included covers of songs by Sheryl Crow, Lisa Loeb, Jewel, and Fleetwood Mac.

In December 1999, she posted two of her songs on the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; website, which caught the attention of both pop rock band Hanson and former &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; writer and Los Angeles record producer Jeff Rabhan, eventually leading to two gigs opening for Hanson in 2000.

In June 2000, Branch self-produced &quot;Broken Bracelet&quot;, a compilation of songs she wrote starting from when she was 14; the album was released on the independent record label Twin Dragon Records. Its title was inspired from a bracelet made by pop singer Jewel, given to Branch by musician Steve Poltz at a Lisa Loeb concert she attended. Poltz told Branch that &quot;when it breaks, you&#x27;ll be famous.&quot; The &quot;Broken Bracelet&quot; recordings were destroyed in the Nashville floods in May 2010.

===2001–2005: &quot;The Spirit Room&quot; and &quot;Hotel Paper&quot;===
In 2001, Branch signed a recording deal with Maverick Records, where she began working with John Shanks to produce her second album. The album, &quot;The Spirit Room&quot;, was released in August 2001, producing the hit single &quot;Everywhere&quot;. The single was a commercial success, winning the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards Viewer&#x27;s Choice Award. &quot;Everywhere&quot; was later followed by singles &quot;All You Wanted&quot; and &quot;Goodbye to You&quot;. In August 2001, she appeared on &quot;Total Request Live&quot; after &quot;Everywhere&quot; reached No. 4 on the show&#x27;s chart. Due to the mainstream success of those released singles, &quot;The Spirit Room&quot; was certified Double Platinum by the RIAA for selling over two million copies in the United States. Branch also sang on the song &quot;Deeper&quot; from Hanson&#x27;s 2004 album &quot;Underneath&quot;. VH1 also released a Pop-Up Video for her song &quot;All You Wanted&quot;. &quot;The Spirit Room&quot; has sold 3 million copies worldwide to date.

Branch met Justincase before her debut on Maverick Records, becoming friends over the Internet before meeting in Las Vegas for a music convention in 2000. Justincase was signed to Maverick Records in late 2001 with the help of Branch. A self-titled album was released on October 29, 2002, and included several collaborations with Branch, including the lead single, &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry for Us&quot;.

In 2002, Branch teamed up with Santana, alongside songwriters Gregg Alexander and Rick Nowels, to produce the song &quot;The Game of Love&quot;, which went on to win a Grammy Award for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals. She also earned a Grammy nomination in 2003 for Best New Artist, which was won by Norah Jones.

Branch&#x27;s third overall album, &quot;Hotel Paper&quot;, was released in 2003 and debuted at No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and has been certified Platinum by the RIAA for selling over one million copies. The album was met with mixed reviews. Its lead single, &quot;Are You Happy Now?&quot;, was a chart success, earning Branch a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance, though the song lost to Pink&#x27;s &quot;Trouble&quot;. The following singles, &quot;Breathe&quot; and &quot;&#x27;Til I Get over You&quot;, did not match the first single&#x27;s success. Branching out into television, she appeared in several shows, including &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; (in an uncredited appearance), &quot;American Dreams&quot;, and &quot;Charmed&quot; (as herself). In June 2004, she appeared on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Faking the Video&quot; alongside Nick Lachey and JC Chasez. She also appeared in the 2002 Rob Schneider film &quot;The Hot Chick&quot; as a club DJ.

===2005–2007: The Wreckers===

In July 2005, Branch began collaborating with her backup singer and longtime friend Jessica Harp. They were initially known as the Cass County Homewreckers as a joke by Branch&#x27;s husband, but they trimmed it down to the Wreckers. Their album attempted to combine their respective genres—pop rock and country. It was originally slated for release in June 2005 but was delayed because of reasons surrounding Branch&#x27;s pregnancy. The duo&#x27;s first single &quot;Leave the Pieces&quot; was released in February 2006, while their album &quot;Stand Still, Look Pretty&quot; was released in May.

During this period, they contributed to Santana&#x27;s album &quot;All That I Am&quot;, with the song &quot;I&#x27;m Feeling You&quot;, appearing on the American teen television drama &quot;One Tree Hill&quot;, and joined country music stars Rascal Flatts on a U.S. tour. They initially toured with Gavin DeGraw, Tyler Hilton and Bethany Joy Galeotti, which was also written into the show during the second season. The group was nominated for Vocal Duo of the Year at the 2006 Country Music Association Awards and for a Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal for the song &quot;Leave the Pieces&quot; in December 2006. &quot;Stand Still, Look Pretty&quot; was certified Gold by the RIAA with sales of 851,000 copies as of March 2009. The Wreckers split in 2007.

Later that same year, Branch sold her Calabasas, California home and moved to Nashville, Tennessee.

===2008–2012: Unreleased albums===

Immediately thereafter, Branch wrote an unreleased song for Mandy Moore&#x27;s 2007 album &quot;Wild Hope&quot;, and also wrote &quot;Together&quot; for the soundtrack of &quot;The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2&quot;; it was also featured as the final song ever played on the CBS TV soap opera, &quot;Guiding Light&quot;. In October 2007, she announced that she was working on a new solo album and later reported the title would be &quot;Everything Comes and Goes&quot;. In June 2008, she played several live shows in preparation for the album&#x27;s release with her sister Nicole singing backing vocals.

In early 2009, she sang the song &quot;I Lose My Heart&quot; in a duet with Chris Isaak on his new album &quot;Mr. Lucky&quot;. A video for the first single from the album &quot;Sooner Or Later&quot; was released on July 28, 2009. Also in 2009, she recorded &quot;A Case of You&quot; (originally by Joni Mitchell) for the compilation &quot;Covered, A Revolution in Sound&quot; which commemorated Warner Bros. Records 50th anniversary. A video was made for the song &quot;This Way&quot; and uploaded to Branch&#x27;s official YouTube account in October 2009, but it was not released as a single and did not chart. (The video was included on a limited edition DVD entitled &quot;The Video Anthology&quot; available on michellebranch.com.) &quot;Everything Comes and Goes&quot; was finally released as a six-track extended play on July 16, 2010, via Branch&#x27;s website and would be available at all retailers one month later. In 2010, Branch and R&amp;B/hip-hop producer Timbaland collaborated on a pop/R&amp;B song entitled &quot;Getaway&quot; and released a video.

In December 2010, Branch announced her return to her pop/rock roots for her album, &quot;West Coast Time&quot;. In early 2011, Branch released three previously unreleased songs from &quot;Everything Comes and Goes&quot; including, &quot;Texas In the Mirror&quot;, &quot;Take a Chance on Me&quot;, and &quot;Long Goodbye&quot;, the latter a duet with Dwight Yoakam. On March 22, 2011, in a video regarding updates on the third studio album uploaded via Branch&#x27;s YouTube account, Branch confirmed that half the album is finished and added that &quot;it&#x27;s sounding really really good...it&#x27;s all going well and it&#x27;s all on time.&quot; On April 14, 2011, it was announced that Branch had finished recording the album, she also added that &quot;only mixing/mastering left. Michelle practiced and recorded a few tracks with Tilted Head and FIVE lead singer Joshua Barton, however it is still a work in progress.&quot; On May 26, 2011, Branch hosted a live webchat with fans in which she previewed her new single &quot;Loud Music&quot;, which was released to the iTunes Store on June 14, 2011. The song was co-written and produced by British writers Jim Irvin and Julian Emery who collaborated with Branch on several songs on the album. In the webcast, Branch also mentioned songs on the album called &quot;Mastermind&quot; and &quot;The Story Of Us&quot; and also added that &quot;Through The Radio&quot; would be a hidden track on the CD. In a previous webcast, she premiered a song from the album called &quot;Spark&quot;. During a live outdoor performance at the Warner Brothers building she performed another new song, dedicated to her then-husband Teddy Landau, &quot;For Dear Life&quot;. In June 2011, she released the album&#x27;s first single titled &quot;Loud Music&quot;. It has charted on the Adult Pop Songs chart. On July 12, 2011, Branch performed &quot;God Bless America&quot; at the MLB All-Star Game, in Phoenix, Arizona. In September, a new song &quot;Another Sun&quot; was featured on Fox&#x27;s TV series &quot;Terra Nova&quot;. On October 29, 2011, she gave a small concert to approximately 200 fans at the Egyptian Room in downtown Indianapolis, as part of the Gravedigger&#x27;s Ball. On December 12, 2011, Branch released a song titled &quot;If You Happen to Call&quot; for free download on the official website.

In February 2012, VH1 hosted the &quot;100 Greatest Women In Music&quot; special and she was nominated in both the &quot;Pop&quot; category and the &quot;Greatest Female Artist of All Time&quot;. On April 3, 2012, Branch performed &quot;Leave the Pieces&quot; with Kelly Clarkson in Los Angeles as part of Clarkson&#x27;s Stronger Tour. On September 5, the singer premiered a new pop-rock track &quot;Mastermind&quot;. In September 2012, Branch joined chef Michael Mina as a co-host of &quot;Cook Taste Eat&quot;, an online cooking show that aims to teach viewers how to cook quality food at home.

As with her release, &quot;Everything Comes and Goes&quot;, &quot;West Coast Time&quot; has seen numerous delays for, as yet, unknown reasons. Branch has confirmed on her Twitter account that she knew as much as the fans did about the delay. In January 2011, Branch confirmed in an interview with Katie Krause from Hollywire.com that the album would be released later that year. On June 1, 2011, Branch announced that the album was called &quot;West Coast Time&quot; and slated for a September 2011 release date. On December 25, 2012, Branch confirmed that &quot;West Coast Time&quot; was scheduled for release in Spring 2013, but the album has not yet been released.

===2013–2017: New record deal and &quot;Hopeless Romantic&quot;===

For much of 2013, Branch wrote songs and moved on from the unreleased &quot;West Coast Time&quot;. On November 5, 2013, Branch announced that she had started recording a new album in London with Martin Terefe. On February 2, 2014, she confirmed on Twitter that the rest of the album would be recorded in Nashville for a pop-rock sound. In October 2014, she recorded a cover of Radiohead&#x27;s &quot;Creep&quot; which was subsequently used in an episode of &quot;Stalker&quot;.

On July 17, 2015, Branch announced that she had signed with Verve Records. In May 2016, she appeared on &quot;Full Frontal with Samantha Bee&quot; to sing &quot;Goodbye Ted Cruz&quot;, a reworking of her song &quot;Goodbye to You&quot;, as a tongue-in-cheek lament to the suspension of Ted Cruz&#x27;s US presidential campaign.

In December 2016, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; announced Branch&#x27;s new album, &quot;Hopeless Romantic&quot;, which was released on April 7, 2017. Branch announced in September 2017, that she had parted ways with Verve Records.

Branch and Patrick Carney performed a cover of the song &quot;A Horse with No Name&quot; for a season 4 episode of &quot;BoJack Horseman&quot; titled &quot;The Old Sugarman Place&quot;, where the title character drives through the desert. This version also appears on the soundtrack album of the series.

===2021–present: &quot;The Spirit Room&quot; 20th anniversary album and &quot;The Trouble with Fever&quot;===
During a January 5, 2021, Livestream performance for Snapple, Branch confirmed that she would be re-recording her album &quot;The Spirit Room&quot; in March 2021 to celebrate its anniversary. On September 10, 2021, Branch performed the album in its entirety during a special virtual concert. An afterparty and Q&amp;A session followed. It was released on October 15, 2021.

On July 12, 2022, Branch announced on social media that her new single titled &quot;I&#x27;m a Man&quot; would be released July 15, 2022. The single was included in her fifth studio album, &quot;The Trouble with Fever&quot;, which was released on September 16, 2022. The album art for &quot;The Trouble with Fever&quot; is a photograph taken by Branch&#x27;s father-in-law, James Carney.

<text>A bone tumor is an abnormal growth of tissue in bone, traditionally classified as noncancerous (benign) or cancerous (malignant). Cancerous bone tumors usually originate from a cancer in another part of the body such as from lung, breast, thyroid, kidney and prostate. There may be a lump, pain, or neurological signs from pressure. A bone tumor might present with a pathologic fracture. Other symptoms may include fatigue, fever, weight loss, anemia and nausea. Sometimes there are no symptoms and the tumour is found when investigating another problem.
Diagnosis is generally by X-ray and other radiological tests such as CT scan, MRI, PET scan and bone scintigraphy. Blood tests might include a complete blood count, inflammatory markers, serum electrophoresis, PSA, kidney function and liver function. Urine may be tested for Bence Jones protein. For confirmation of diagnosis, a biopsy for histological evaluation might be required.

The most common bone tumor is a non-ossifying fibroma. Average five-year survival in the United States after being diagnosed with bone and joint cancer is 67%. The earliest known bone tumor was an osteosarcoma in a foot bone discovered in South Africa, between 1.6 and 1.8 million years ago.

==Classification==
Bone tumors are traditionally classified as noncancerous (benign) or cancerous (malignant). Several features of bone tumors and soft tissue tumors overlap. Their classification was revised by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2020. This newer classification categorises bone tumors into cartilage tumors, osteogenic tumors, fibrogenic tumors, vascular tumors of bone, osteoclastic giant cell-rich tumors, notochordal tumors, other mesenchymal tumors of bone, and hematopoietic neoplasms of bone.

Bone tumors may be classified as &quot;primary tumors&quot;, which originate in bone or from bone-derived cells and tissues, and &quot;secondary tumors&quot; which originate in other sites and spread (metastasize) to the skeleton. Carcinomas of the prostate, breasts, lungs, thyroid, and kidneys are the carcinomas that most commonly metastasize to bone. Secondary malignant bone tumors are estimated to be 50 to 100 times as common as primary bone cancers.

===Primary bone tumors===
Primary tumors of bone can be divided into benign tumors and cancers. Common benign bone tumors may be neoplastic, developmental, traumatic, infectious, or inflammatory in etiology. Some benign tumors are not true neoplasms, but rather, represent hamartomas, namely the osteochondroma. The most common locations for many primary tumors, both benign and malignant include the distal femur and proximal tibia (around the knee joint). Examples of benign bone tumors include osteoma, osteoid osteoma, osteochondroma, osteoblastoma, enchondroma, giant cell tumor of bone and aneurysmal bone cyst.

Malignant primary bone tumors, known as bone sarcomas, include osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, fibrosarcoma, and other types. While malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) - now generally called &quot;pleomorphic undifferentiated sarcoma&quot; - primary in bone is known to occur occasionally, current paradigms tend to consider MFH a wastebasket diagnosis, and the current trend is toward using specialized studies (i.e. genetic and immunohistochemical tests) to classify these undifferentiated tumors into other tumor classes. Multiple myeloma is a hematologic cancer, originating in the bone marrow, which also frequently presents as one or more bone lesions.

Germ cell tumors, including teratoma, often present and originate in the midline of the sacrum, coccyx, or both. These sacrococcygeal teratomas are often relatively amenable to treatment.

===Secondary bone tumors===
Secondary bone tumors are metastatic lesions which have spread from other organs, most commonly carcinomas of the breast, lung, and prostate. Rarely, primary bone malignancies such as osteosarcoma may also spread to other bones.
Reliable and valid statistics on the incidence, prevalence, and mortality of malignant bone tumours are difficult to come by, particularly in older adults (those over 75 years of age) - because carcinomas that are widely metastatic to bone are rarely ever curable. Biopsies to determine the origin of the tumour in cases like this are rarely done.

==Signs and symptoms==

Clinical features of a bone tumor depend on the type of tumor and which part of which bone is affected. Symptoms and signs usually result from the pressure effect of the tumor.

There may be a lump, with or without pain. Pain may increase with the growth of the tumor and may be worse at night and at rest. A bone tumor might present with an unexplained broken bone; with little or no trauma. Additional symptoms may include fatigue, fever, weight loss, anemia and nausea. If the tumor presses a nerve, neurological signs may be present. Sometimes there are no symptoms and the tumour is found when investigating another problem.

==Diagnosis==
A bone tumour may be felt on examination, following which a plain X-ray is usually carried out. Blood tests might include a complete blood count, inflammatory markers, serum electrophoresis, PSA, kidney function and liver function. Urine may be sent for Bence Jones protein. Other tests that might be requested include a CT scan, MRI, PET scan and bone scintigraphy. For confirmation of diagnosis, a biopsy for histological evaluation might be required, using either a needle or by incision (open biopsy).

===Staging===
==Treatment==
Treatment of bone tumors is dependent on the type of tumor. Where available, people with bone tumors are treated at a specialist centre which have surgeons, radiologists, pathologists, oncologists and other support staff. Generally, noncancerous bone tumors may be observed for changes and surgery offered if there is pain or pressure effects on neighbouring body parts. Surgical resection with or without cytotoxic drugs may be considered.

===Chemotherapy and radiotherapy===
Chemotherapy and radiotherapy are effective in some tumors (such as Ewing&#x27;s sarcoma) but less so in others (such as chondrosarcoma).
There is a variety of chemotherapy treatment protocols for bone tumors. The protocol with the best-reported survival in children and adults is an intra-arterial protocol where tumor response is tracked by serial arteriogram. When tumor response has reached &gt;90% necrosis surgical intervention is planned.

===Medication===
One of the major concerns is bone density and bone loss. Non-hormonal bisphosphonates increase bone strength and are available as once-a-week prescription pills. Strontium-89 chloride is an intravenous medication given to help with the pain and can be given in three-month intervals.

===Surgical treatment===
Treatment for some bone cancers may involve surgery, such as limb amputation, or limb sparing surgery (often in combination with chemotherapy and radiation therapy). Limb sparing surgery, or limb salvage surgery, means the limb is spared from amputation. Instead of amputation, the affected bone is removed and replaced in one of two ways: (a) bone graft, in which bone is taken from elsewhere on the body or (b) artificial bone is put in. In upper leg surgeries, limb salvage prostheses are available.

There are other joint preservation surgical reconstruction options, including allograft, tumor-devitalized autograft, vascularized fibula graft, distraction osteogenesis, and custom-made implants. An analysis of massive knee replacements after resection of primary bone tumours showed patients did not score as highly on the Musculoskeletal Tumour Society Score and Knee Society Score as patients who had undergone intra-articular resection.

=== Thermal ablation techniques ===
Over the past two decades, CT guided radiofrequency ablation has emerged as a less invasive alternative to surgical resection in the care of benign bone tumors, most notably osteoid osteomas. In this technique, which can be performed under conscious sedation, a RF probe is introduced into the tumor nidus through a cannulated needle under CT guidance and heat is applied locally to destroy tumor cells. Since the procedure was first introduced for the treatment of osteoid osteomas in the early 1990s, it has been shown in numerous studies to be less invasive and expensive, to result in less bone destruction and to have equivalent safety and efficacy to surgical techniques, with 66 to 96% of patients reporting freedom from symptoms. While initial success rates with RFA are high, symptom recurrence after RFA treatment has been reported, with some studies demonstrating a recurrence rate similar to that of surgical treatment.

Thermal ablation techniques are also increasingly being used in the palliative treatment of painful metastatic bone disease. Currently, external beam radiation therapy is the standard of care for patients with localized bone pain due to metastatic disease. Although the majority of patients experience complete or partial relief of pain following radiation therapy, the effect is not immediate and has been shown in some studies to be transient in more than half of patients. For patients who are not eligible or do not respond to traditional therapies ( i.e. radiation therapy, chemotherapy, palliative surgery, bisphosphonates or analgesic medications), thermal ablation techniques have been explored as alternatives for pain reduction. Several multi-center clinical trials studying the efficacy of RFA in the treatment of moderate to severe pain in patients with metastatic bone disease have shown significant decreases in patient reported pain after treatment. These studies are limited however to patients with one or two metastatic sites; pain from multiple tumors can be difficult to localize for directed therapy. More recently, cryoablation has also been explored as a potentially effective alternative as the area of destruction created by this technique can be monitored more effectively by CT than RFA, a potential advantage when treating tumors adjacent to critical structures.

==Prognosis==
The outlook depends on the type of tumor. The outcome is expected to be good for people with noncancerous (benign) tumors, although some types of benign tumors may eventually become cancerous (malignant). With malignant bone tumors that have not spread, most patients achieve a cure, but the cure rate depends on the type of cancer, location, size, and other factors.

==Epidemiology==
Bone tumors that originate from bone are very rare and account for around 0.2% of all tumors. Average five-year survival in the United States after being diagnosed with bone and joint cancer is 67%.

==History==
The earliest known bone tumor was an osteosarcoma in a foot bone belonging to a person who died in Swartkrans Cave, South Africa, between 1.6 and 1.8 million years ago.

==Other animals==
Bones are a common site for tumors in cats and dogs.

<text>An osteosarcoma (OS) or osteogenic sarcoma (OGS) is a cancerous tumor in a bone. Specifically, it is an aggressive malignant neoplasm that arises from primitive transformed cells of mesenchymal origin (and thus a sarcoma) and that exhibits osteoblastic differentiation and produces malignant osteoid.

Osteosarcoma is the most common histological form of primary bone sarcoma. It is most prevalent in teenagers and young adults.

==Signs and symptoms==
Many patients first complain of pain that may be worse at night, may be intermittent and of varying intensity and may have been occurring for a long time. Teenagers who are active in sports often complain of pain in the lower femur, or immediately below the knee. If the tumor is large, it can present as overt localised swelling. Sometimes a sudden fracture is the first symptom because the affected bone is not as strong as normal bone and may fracture abnormally with minor trauma. In cases of more deep-seated tumors that are not as close to the skin, such as those originating in the pelvis, localised swelling may not be apparent.

==Causes==

Several research groups are investigating cancer stem cells and their potential to cause tumors along with genes and proteins causative in different phenotypes. Radiotherapy for unrelated conditions may be a rare cause.
* A small supernumerary marker chromosome or a giant rod chromosome is present in the tumor cells of low grade OS including low grade central OS and paraosteal OS (see below Variants section), carry various potentially pro-cancerous genes, and are thought to contribute to the development of these OS. (See Small supernumerary marker chromosomes and giant rod chromosomes in osteosarcomas)
* Familial cases where the deletion of chromosome 13q14 inactivates the retinoblastoma gene is associated with a high risk of osteosarcoma development.
* Bone dysplasias, including Paget&#x27;s disease of bone, fibrous dysplasia, enchondromatosis, and hereditary multiple exostoses, increase the risk of osteosarcoma.
* Li–Fraumeni syndrome (germline TP53 mutation) is a predisposing factor for osteosarcoma development.
* Rothmund–Thomson syndrome (i.e. autosomal recessive association of congenital bone defects, hair and skin dysplasias, hypogonadism, and cataracts) is associated with increased risk of this disease.
* Large doses of Sr-90, nicknamed bone seeker, increases the risk of bone cancer and leukemia in animals and is presumed to do so in people.

There is no clear association between water fluoridation and cancer or deaths due to cancer, both for cancer in general and also specifically for bone cancer and osteosarcoma. Series of research concluded that concentration of fluoride in water does not associate with osteosarcoma. The beliefs regarding association of fluoride exposure and osteosarcoma stem from a study of US National Toxicology program in 1990, which showed uncertain evidence of association of fluoride and osteosarcoma in male rats. But there is still no solid evidence of cancer-causing tendency of fluoride in mice. Fluoridation of water has been practiced around the world to improve citizens&#x27; dental health. It is also deemed as major health success. Fluoride concentration levels in water supplies are regulated, such as United States Environmental Protection Agency regulates fluoride levels to not be greater than 4 milligrams per liter. Actually, water supplies already have natural occurring fluoride, but many communities chose to add more fluoride to the point that it can reduce tooth decay. Fluoride is also known for its ability to cause new bone formation. Yet, further research shows no osteosarcoma risks from fluoridated water in humans. Most of the research involved counting number of osteosarcoma patients cases in particular areas which has difference concentrations of fluoride in drinking water. The statistic analysis of the data shows no significant difference in occurrences of osteosarcoma cases in different fluoridated regions. Another important research involved collecting bone samples from osteosarcoma patients to measure fluoride concentration and compare them to bone samples of newly diagnosed malignant bone tumors. The result is that the median fluoride concentrations in bone samples of osteosarcoma patients and tumor controls are not significantly different. Not only fluoride concentration in bones, Fluoride exposures of osteosarcoma patients are also proven to be not significantly different from healthy people.

== Mechanism ==

Osteosarcomas tend to occur at the sites of bone growth, presumably because proliferation makes osteoblastic cells in this region prone to acquire mutations that could lead to transformation of cells (the RB gene and p53 gene are commonly involved). The tumor may be localized at the end of the long bone (commonly in the metaphysis). Most often it affects the proximal end of tibia or humerus, or distal end of femur. Osteosarcoma tends to affect regions around the knee in 60% of cases, 15% around the hip, 10% at the shoulder, and 8% in the jaw. The tumor is solid, hard, irregular (&quot;fir-tree,&quot; &quot;moth-eaten&quot;, or &quot;sun-burst&quot; appearance on X-ray examination) due to the tumor spicules of calcified bone radiating at right angles. These right angles form what is known as a Codman triangle, which is characteristic but not diagnostic of osteosarcoma. Surrounding tissues are infiltrated.
Microscopically: The characteristic feature of osteosarcoma is presence of osteoid (bone formation) within the tumor. Tumor cells are very pleomorphic (anaplastic), some are giant, numerous atypical mitoses. These cells produce osteoid describing irregular trabeculae (amorphous, eosinophilic/pink) with or without central calcification (hematoxylinophilic/blue, granular)—tumor bone. Tumor cells are included in the osteoid matrix. Depending on the features of the tumor cells present (whether they resemble bone cells, cartilage cells, or fibroblast cells), the tumor can be subclassified. Osteosarcomas may exhibit multinucleated osteoclast-like giant cells.

==Diagnosis==
X-rays is the initial imaging of choice to diagnose osteosarcoma. Some characteristics of osteosarcoma on X-rays are sunburst appearance and Codman triangle (elevation of bony cortex by the tumour that caused new bone formation). CT scan is helpful in defining the bony anatomy, the integrity of the bony cortex, detecting pathologic fracture, and assessing ossification (laying of new bone materials) and calcification of the cartilage. On the other hand, soft tissue and medullary cavity is better imaged by MRI scan.

Most times, the early signs of osteosarcoma are caught on X-rays taken during routine dental check-ups. Osteosarcoma frequently develops in the mandible (lower jaw); accordingly, dentists are trained to look for signs that may suggest osteosarcoma. Even though radiographic findings for this cancer vary greatly, one usually sees a symmetrical widening of the periodontal ligament space. A dentist who has reason to suspect osteosarcoma or another underlying disorder would then refer the patient to an Oral &amp; Maxillofacial surgeon for biopsy. A biopsy of suspected osteosarcoma outside of the facial region should be performed by a qualified orthopedic oncologist. The American Cancer Society states: &quot;Probably in no other cancer is it as important to perform this procedure properly. An improperly performed biopsy may make it difficult to save the affected limb from amputation.&quot; It may also metastasise to the lungs, mainly appearing on the chest X-ray as solitary or multiple round nodules most common at the lower regions.

===Variants===
* Conventional: osteoblastic, chondroblastic, fibroblastic OS
* Telangiectatic OS
* Small cell OS
* Low-grade central OS
* Periosteal OS
* Paraosteal OS
* Secondary OS
* High-grade surface OS
* Extraskeletal OS
==Treatment==
A complete radical, surgical, &quot;en bloc&quot; resection of the cancer, is the treatment of choice in osteosarcoma. Although most patients are able to have limb-salvage surgery, complications—particularly infection, prosthetic loosening and non-union, or local tumor recurrence—may cause the need for further surgery or amputation.

Mifamurtide is used after a patient has had surgery to remove the tumor and together with chemotherapy to kill remaining cancer cells to reduce the risk of cancer recurrence. Also, the option to have rotationplasty after the tumor is taken out exists.

Patients with osteosarcoma are best managed by a medical oncologist and an orthopedic oncologist experienced in managing sarcomas. Current standard treatment is to use neoadjuvant chemotherapy (chemotherapy given before surgery) followed by surgical resection. The percentage of tumor cell necrosis (cell death) seen in the tumor after surgery gives an idea of the prognosis and also lets the oncologist know if the chemotherapy regimen should be altered after surgery.

Standard therapy is a combination of limb-salvage orthopedic surgery when possible (or amputation in some cases) and a combination of high-dose methotrexate with leucovorin rescue, intra-arterial cisplatin, adriamycin, ifosfamide with mesna, BCD (bleomycin, cyclophosphamide, dactinomycin), etoposide, and muramyl tripeptide. Rotationplasty may be used. Ifosfamide can be used as an adjuvant treatment if the necrosis rate is low.

Despite the success of chemotherapy for osteosarcoma, it has one of the lowest survival rates for pediatric cancer. The best reported 10-year survival rate is 92%; the protocol used is an aggressive intra-arterial regimen that individualizes therapy based on arteriographic response. Three-year event-free survival ranges from 50% to 75%, and five-year survival ranges from 60% to 85+% in some studies. Overall, 65–70% patients treated five years ago will be alive today. These survival rates are overall averages and vary greatly depending on the individual necrosis rate.

Filgrastim or pegfilgrastim help with white blood cell counts and neutrophil counts. Blood transfusions and epoetin alfa help with anemia. Computational analysis on a panel of osteosarcoma cell lines identified new shared and specific therapeutic targets (proteomic and genetic) in osteosarcoma, while phenotypes showed an increased role of tumor microenvironments.

==Prognosis==
Prognosis is separated into three groups.
* Stage I osteosarcoma is rare and includes parosteal osteosarcoma or low-grade central osteosarcoma. It has an excellent prognosis (&gt;90%) with wide resection.
* Stage II prognosis depends on the site of the tumor (proximal tibia, femur, pelvis, etc.), size of the tumor mass, and the degree of necrosis from neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Other pathological factors such as the degree of p-glycoprotein, whether the tumor is cxcr4-positive, or Her2-positive are also important, as these are associated with distant metastases to the lung. The prognosis for patients with metastatic osteosarcoma improves with longer times to metastases (more than 12 months to 4 months), a smaller number of metastases, and their resectability. It is better to have fewer metastases than longer time to metastases. Those with a longer length of time (more than 24 months) and few nodules (two or fewer) have the best prognosis, with a two-year survival after the metastases of 50%, five-year of 40%, and 10-year of 20%. If metastases are both local and regional, the prognosis is worse.
* Initial presentation of stage III osteosarcoma with lung metastases depends on the resectability of the primary tumor and lung nodules, degree of necrosis of the primary tumor, and maybe the number of metastases. Overall survival prognosis is about 30%.

Deaths due to malignant neoplasms of the bones and joints account for an unknown number of childhood cancer deaths. Mortality rates due to osteosarcoma have been declining at about 1.3% per year. Long-term survival probabilities for osteosarcoma have improved dramatically during the late 20th century and approximated 68% in 2009.

==Epidemiology==
Osteosarcoma is the eighth-most common form of childhood cancer, comprising 2.4% of all malignancies in pediatric patients, and about 20% of all primary bone cancers.

Incidence rates for osteosarcoma in U.S. patients under 20 years of age are estimated at 5.0 per million per year in the general population, with a slight variation between individuals of black, Hispanic, and white ethnicities (6.8, 6.5, and 4.6 per million per year, respectively). It is slightly more common in males (5.4 per million per year) than in females (4.0 per million per year).

It originates more frequently in the metaphyseal region of tubular long bones, with 42% occurring in the femur, 19% in the tibia, and 10% in the humerus. About 8% of all cases occur in the skull and jaw, and another 8% in the pelvis.

Around 300 of the 900 people diagnosed in the United States will die each year. A second peak in incidence occurs in the elderly, usually associated with an underlying bone pathology such as Paget&#x27;s disease of bone.

==Other animals==
===Risk factors===
Osteosarcoma is the most common bone tumor in dogs and typically affects middle-aged large and giant breed dogs such as Irish Wolfhounds, Greyhounds, German Shepherds, Rottweilers, mountain breeds (Great Pyrenees, St. Bernard, Leonberger, Newfoundland), Doberman Pinschers and Great Danes. It has a 10-fold greater incidence in dogs than humans. A hereditary base has been shown in St. Bernard dogs. Spayed/neutered dogs have twice the risk of intact ones to develop osteosarcoma. Infestation with the parasite Spirocerca lupi can cause osteosarcoma of the esophagus.

===Clinical presentation===
The most commonly affected bones are the proximal humerus, the distal radius, the distal femur, and the tibia, following the basic premise &quot;far from the elbow, close to the knee&quot;. Other sites include the ribs, the mandible, the spine, and the pelvis. Rarely, osteosarcoma may arise from soft tissues (extraskeletal osteosarcoma). Metastasis of tumors involving the limb bones is very common, usually to the lungs. The tumor causes a great deal of pain, and can even lead to fracture of the affected bone. As with human osteosarcoma, bone biopsy is the definitive method to reach a final diagnosis. Osteosarcoma should be differentiated from other bone tumours and a range of other lesions, such as osteomyelitis. Differential diagnosis of the osteosarcoma of the skull in particular includes, among others, chondrosarcoma and the multilobular tumour of bone.

===Treatment and prognosis===
Amputation is the initial treatment, although this alone will not prevent metastasis. Chemotherapy combined with amputation improves the survival time, but most dogs still die within a year. Surgical techniques designed to save the leg (limb-sparing procedures) do not improve the prognosis.

Some current studies indicate osteoclast inhibitors such as alendronate and pamidronate may have beneficial effects on the quality of life by reducing osteolysis, thus reducing the degree of pain, as well as the risk of pathological fractures.

=== Molecular alterations ===
Canine osteosarcoma shows similar patterns of molecular somatic alterations to the human disease. Both are characterized by genetic instability and karyotypic complexity and genes that are recurrently altered include &quot;TP53, RB1, PTEN, MYC, PIK3CA&quot;&quot;.&quot; In contrast, mutations in the histone methyltransferase gene &quot;SETD2&quot; are rare in human osteosarcoma, but have been identified in 21% of canine tumors.

===Cats===
Osteosarcoma is also the most common bone tumor in cats, although not as frequently encountered, and most typically affect the rear legs. The cancer is generally less aggressive in cats than in dogs, so amputation alone can lead to a significant survival time in many affected cats, though post-amputation chemotherapy is recommended when a high grade is confirmed on histopathology.

===Dinosaurs===
An 2020 study, published in &quot;The Lancet Oncology&quot;, reports the first confirmed case of osteosarcoma in a dinosaur, a &quot;Centrosaurus apertus&quot; from the Late Cretaceous, about 77 to 75.5 million years ago. The bone showed typical characteristics of cancer, including areas of cortical destruction, neoplastic bone formations, and disordered organization inconsistent with a simple fracture or infection. The structural and histological similarities with a high-grade human osteosarcoma case strengthened the diagnosis. This study establishes that bone cancers, such as osteosarcoma, have deep roots in the evolutionary history of vertebrates.
