<text>John Wodehouse, 1st Earl of Kimberley (7 January 18268 April 1902), known as the Lord Wodehouse from 1846 to 1866, was a British Liberal politician. He held office in every Liberal administration from 1852 to 1895, notably as Secretary of State for the Colonies and as Foreign Secretary.

==Early life and education==
Kimberley was born in 1826 in Wymondham, Norfolk, the eldest son of the Hon. Henry Wodehouse (1799–1834) and grandson of John Wodehouse, 2nd Baron Wodehouse. His mother was Anne Gurdon (d. 1880), daughter of Theophilus Thornhagh Gurdon. In 1846 he succeeded his grandfather as third Baron Wodehouse. He was educated at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford, where he took a first-class degree in classics in 1847.

==Early career (1852–1874)==
He was by inheritance a Liberal in politics, and in 1852–1856 and 1859–1861 he was Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in Lord Aberdeen&#x27;s and Lord Palmerston&#x27;s ministries. In the interval (1856–1858) he had been envoy-extraordinary to Russia; and in 1863 he was sent on a special mission to Copenhagen in the hope of finding a solution to the Schleswig-Holstein question. However, the mission was a failure.

In 1864 Kimberley became Under-Secretary of State for India, but towards the end of the year was made Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. In that capacity, he had to grapple with the first manifestations of Fenianism, and in recognition of his services, he was created Earl of Kimberley in 1866. In July 1866 he vacated his office with the fall of Lord Russell&#x27;s ministry, but in 1868 he became Lord Privy Seal in Gladstone&#x27;s cabinet, and in July 1870 was transferred from that post to be Secretary of State for the Colonies. It was the moment of the great diamond discoveries in southern Africa, and the town of Kimberley in the Cape Colony was named after him. Lord Kimberley was credited with the change in British policy towards the independent Malay states that led to the signing of the Pangkor Treaty of 1874, after which British political agents known as Residents were placed in the Malay states as advisors to the rulers.

==Later career (1875–1902)==
After an interval in opposition from 1874 to 1880, Lord Kimberley returned to the Colonial Office in Gladstone&#x27;s next ministry. He was in that office when responsible government was granted to Cape Colony, British Columbia was added to the Dominion of Canada and during the First Boer War. At the end of 1882 he exchanged this office first for that of Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and then for the secretaryship of state for India, a post he retained during the remainder of Gladstone&#x27;s tenure of power (1882–1885, 1886, 1892–1894), though in 1892–1894 he combined with it that of the lord presidency of the council.

In Lord Rosebery&#x27;s cabinet (1894–1895) he was Foreign Secretary. During this time he signed the landmark Anglo-Japanese Treaty of Commerce and Navigation. Sir Edward Grey who served as Parliamentary Under-Secretary under Kimberley at the Foreign Office portrays him unfavourably as prolix and prone to irrelevant digressions in conversation although &quot;concise, definite and clear&quot; on paper. However, according to the Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition, &quot;As leader of the Liberal party in the House of Lords he acted with undeviating dignity, and in opposition, he was a courteous antagonist and a critic of weight and experience&quot;.

==Other public positions==
On 5 April 1850, he joined the Canterbury Association, formed to establish a colony (in the later Canterbury Region) on the South Island of New Zealand.

Lord Kimberley took interest in education, and after being for many years a member of the senate of the University of London, he became its chancellor in 1899.

==Family==
Lord Kimberley married Lady Florence FitzGibbon (d. 1895), daughter of Richard FitzGibbon, 3rd Earl of Clare, on 16 August 1847. They had three children:

*John Wodehouse, 2nd Earl of Kimberley (10 Dec 1848 – 7 Jan 1932)
*Lady Alice Wodehouse (17 Dec 1850 – 8 Jan 1937) married Hussey Packe, son of George Hussey Packe, on 14 August 1872. They had two children, Sir Edward, and Florence, the wife of Lt.-Col. Cuthbert James.
*Hon. Armine Wodehouse (24 Sep 1860 – 1 May 1901)

He died at 35 Lowndes Square in London (now the High Commission of Pakistan) on 8 April 1902, aged 76, and was succeeded in his titles by his eldest son, John. His more distant relatives include the writer P. G. Wodehouse.

<doc id="309105" wikidata="Q7641172" url="?curid=309105" title="Cham Albanians">
<text>Cham Albanians or Chams (; , ), are a sub-group of Albanians who originally resided in the western part of the region of Epirus in southwestern Albania and northwestern Greece, an area known among Albanians as Chameria. The Chams have their own particular cultural identity within Albanian sub-groups. A number of Chams contributed to the Albanian national identity and played an important role in starting the renaissance of the Albanian culture in the 19th century. The Chams speak their own dialect of the Albanian language, the Cham Albanian dialect, which is a Southern Tosk Albanian dialect and one of the two most conservative ones; the other being Arvanitika.

During the late 1930s Chams suffered from intimidation and persecution under the dictatorship of General Metaxas. Following the Italian occupation of Albania in 1939, the Chams became a prominent propaganda tool for the Italians and irredentist elements among them became more vocal. As a result, on the eve of the Greco-Italian War, Greek authorities deported the adult male Cham population to internment camps. After the occupation of Greece, large parts of the Muslim Cham population collaborated with Italian and German forces. This fueled resentment among the local Greek population and in the aftermath of World War II the entire Muslim Cham population had to flee to Albania. Most Chams settled in Albania, while others formed émigré communities in Turkey and the United States, and today their descendants continue to live in these countries. Since the fall of Communism in Albania, Chams in Albania have campaigned for right of return to Greece and restoration of confiscated properties. According to Laurie Hart, the remaining Orthodox Cham communities in Epirus are nowadays assimilated and entirely identify with the Greek nation. On the other hand, Bugajski includes the Orthodox among Cham Albanians. In Albania, the Cham dialect and other traditions have been preserved, while in Greece linguistic rights and Orthodox Cham heritage have been suppressed in public space and been subject to assimilation policies. As such, the use of Albanian has been relegated to private space within the household.

== Name ==
=== Etymology and definition ===
The name &quot;Cham&quot;, together with that of the region, &quot;Chameria&quot;, is from an extinct local Slavic *&quot;čamŭ&quot;, itself from the local Greek hydronym &quot;Thyamis&quot; (Θύαμις in Greek, &quot;Kalamas&quot; in Albanian). Çabej treats &quot;Cham&quot; as a direct continuation of &quot;Thyamis.&quot; A folk etymology attributes the name to Turkish &quot;cami&quot; (Greek &quot;tzami&quot;), literally, &#x27;mosque-goer, mosque attendee&#x27; which presumably was used by Orthodox Christians for the descendants of Muslim converts. However, this is unlikely since the word&#x27;s broader ethnographic and dialectal sense encompasses the entire Albanian-speaking population of the Thesprotia and Preveza regional units of Greek Epirus, both the Muslim and Christian populations.

Chams account for the greatest part of the erstwhile substantial Albanian minority in the wider area of the Epirus region; outside Chameria proper, there are only two Albanian-speaking villages further northeast (near Konitsa in Ioannina regional unit), whose inhabitants belong to a different Albanian sub-group, that of the Labs. Today, in the Greek context the use of the term has become largely associated with the former Muslim minority.

=== Ethnic appellations ===
Cham Albanians are known primarily by the Albanian form of the name &quot;Chams&quot; (Çam or Çamë) and the Greek name &quot;Tsamides&quot; (Τσάμηδες). It can be found in English sources also as a hybrid form of both names, &quot;Tsams&quot;. Prior to 1944, Greek sources often referred to Chams as &quot;Albanophones&quot; (Greek: Αλβανόφωνοι) or simply &quot;Albanians of Epirus&quot;.

In Greece, Muslim Chams were referred to by a number of names by different authors. They were called &quot;Albanochams&quot; (Αλβανοτσάμηδες, &quot;Alvanotsamides&quot;), and &quot;Turkalbanians&quot; (Τουρκαλβανοί, &quot;Tourkalvanoi&quot;) or &quot;Turkochams&quot; (Τουρκοτσάμηδες, &quot;Tourkotsamides&quot;).
From the middle of the nineteenth century however, the term &quot;Turk&quot; and from the late nineteenth century onwards, derivative terms such as &quot;Turkalvanoi&quot; have been used as a pejorative term, phrase and or expression for Muslim Albanian populations by non-Muslim Balkan Peoples. Amongst the wider Greek-speaking population until the interwar period, the term &quot;Arvanitis&quot; (plural: Arvanites) was used to describe an Albanian speaker regardless of their religious affiliations. In Epirus today, the term &quot;Arvanitis&quot; is still used for an Albanian speaker regardless of their citizenship and religion.

At the same time, the Albanian speaking population in Thesprotia, who is very rarely characterized as &quot;Christian Chams&quot;, is often referred by Greeks as &quot;Arvanites&quot; (Αρβανίτες), which primarily refers to the Albanophone Greeks of southern Greece but is commonly used as for all Albanian-speaking Greek citizens. The local Greek population also calls them &quot;Graeco-Chams&quot; (Ελληνοτσάμηδες, &quot;Elinotsamides&quot;), while Muslim Albanians sometimes designate them as &quot;Kaur&quot;, which means &quot;infidel&quot; and refers to their religion. This term was used by Muslim Albanians for the non-Muslims during the Ottoman Empire. The term shqiptar (&quot;he/she who speaks clearly&quot;), the Albanian ethnic endonym which came to prevail after the 18th century, was being used by Christian Albanian-speakers in the region as well, but today is used mostly as a means to differentiate themselves from other groups in the region (Greeks, Vlachs). Greek-speakers use the term &quot;skipetaros&quot; (shqiptar) to refer pejoratively to Orthodox Albanian-speakers in Thesprotia.

Some Aromanians living the region also use a regional self appellation &quot;Tsamuréńi&quot; for themselves derived from the words Chameria and Cham.

Chams in Turkey are known by the name &quot;Arnauts&quot; (Arnavutlar), which applies to all ethnic Albanians in Turkey.

== Distribution ==
Cham communities now mostly exist in Albania, the United States and Turkey, as a result of their expulsion from their homeland, Chameria in Greece after World War II. A minority still lives in this region.

=== Chameria ===

Chameria is the name applied by the Albanians to the region formerly inhabited by the Chams, along the Ionian coast from Konispol to the north to the Acheron valley south. This area corresponds to a few villages in the southern part of the Saranda district in Albania (the municipalities of Konispol, Xarrë and Markat) and to the regional units of Thesprotia and Preveza in Greece. This area is part of the larger region of Epirus.

Much of the region is mountainous. Valley farmlands are located the central, southern and the western part of Thesprotia, while the terrain of the Preveza regional unit is mostly hilly. There are two rivers in the region: the Thyamis and Acheron.

The main settlements in which Chams originally resided were: Paramythia, Filiates, Igoumenitsa, Parapotamos, Syvota, Sagiada, Perdika, and Margariti. Preveza and Ioannina also had significant Cham Albanian communities. The Orthodox Chams originally resided in Fanari, Louros and Thesprotiko.

The Albanian speaking exclave of Chameria, in the beginning of the 20th century, was located along the Ionian coast, and apart from Konispol, its northernmost part, it included the western part of Thesprotia prefecture and the northern part of Preveza. In terms of modern Greek administration, the Albanian exclave included the provinces of Thyamis and Margariti and the westernmost villages of the provinces of Paramythia and Filiates. In Preveza prefecture, it included the northern regions such as the Fanari plain, the surroundings of Parga and villages of the upper Acheron valley, with two settlements of the latter region located in Ioannina prefecture.

=== Albania ===

After the expulsion of the Muslim Chams from Greece, they were spread throughout Albania. The majority of Muslim Chams settled in the outskirts of Vlorë, Durrës and Tirana. Several hundred Chams moved into properties along the Himara coast and to existing villages along the coast such as Borshi, or established entirely new villages, such as Vrina, near the Greek border.

=== Diaspora ===
Some Chams live in Turkey and the United States. The number of Chams in diaspora was estimated by Miranda Vickers in 2007 at 400,000. The first wave of this diaspora left for Turkey during the Greco-Turkish population exchange of 1923. They have populated the areas of Erenköy and Kartal in Istanbul, as well as a number of towns in the area of Bursa, especially Mudanya. After the Second World War, others settled in İzmir, Gemlik and Aydın. After 1944, another part migrated to the United States of America, where they were mainly concentrated in Chicago, as well as Boston and New York City.

== History ==

=== Medieval era (up to 1434) ===

The first undisputed mention of Albanians as an ethnic group in historical records dates from the second half of the 11th century, where they are named as the inhabitants of Arbanon in central Albania. During this time, the earliest mention of Albanians within the region of Epirus is recorded in a Venetian document of 1210 as inhabiting the area opposite the island of Corfu. Nevertheless, significant movements of Albanian populations in the region are not mentioned prior to 1337. Groups of Albanians moved into Thessaly and the Peloponnese as early as 1268 as mercenaries of Michael Doukas.

Elements of the Albanian population began, in the late 13th and early 14th centuries, for various reasons, to emigrate to Epirus. In the first decade of the 14th century, some Albanian clans were reported in Epirus and Thessaly, mainly hired as mercenaries from the Byzantines. A major migration occurred in the 1340s and 1350s when Albanian tribesmen supported the successful Serbian campaign against Byzantine possessions the region. During this migration period, two short-lived Albanian entities were formed in Epirus: the Despotate of Arta (1358–1416) and the Principality of Gjirokastër (1386–1411). While the area of Vagenetia (medieval name of Chameria/Thesprotia) was mainly under the control of Italian rulers: either Venetians or the Despotes of Epirus based in Ioannina. That time, representatives of Vagenetia, together with a delegation from Ioannina, asked the Serb ruler Simeon to protect them from the Albanian threat. Both Albanian entities were annexed and in 1419, many Albanians fled from Epirus and moved to Morea. Those tribes that settled in southern Greece would become the ancestors of the Arvanites.

=== Ottoman rule (1434–1913) ===
The region of Epirus was conquered by the Ottoman Empire in the early 15th century. Cham Albanians weren&#x27;t the only Albanian-speaking population in the region even though they constituted a significant component of the Albanian-speaking population in the part of Epirus, which was incorporated in Greece after 1912. Besides Cham Albanians which lived in Thesprotia, Albanian-speaking communities lived in the northern part of Prefeza prefecture (the Fanari plan ( and the hinterland of Parga) and the Parasouliotic villages Zermi, Krania, Papadates, Rousatsa as well as Derviziana and Mousiotitsa, which are part of Ioannina prefecture. There were also other Albanian groups which in the 19th century had become Greek-speaking as attested by primary accounts about them older than the 19th century and toponyms of Albanian origin in specific regions. These areas included the settlements along the Tyria river valley, the region to the northeast of Ioannina Lake, the region south of the Fanari plain in Preveza and partly the area extending to the south Tzoumerka mountain range.

From the establishment of Ottoman rule until 1864, the region of Chameria was included in the Eyalet of Rumelia. It was divided between the sanjaks of Delvina and Ioannina, which were second order administrative divisions. After 1864, this territory was organized under the Vilayet of Yanya (Ioannina), which was further divided into the sanjaks of Ioannina, Preveza and Gjirokastra. Between 1787 and 1822, Ali Pasha controlled the region, which was incorporated into his Pashalik of Yanina, a &quot;de facto&quot; independent state under only nominal Ottoman authority.

Under Ottoman rule, Islamization was widespread amongst Albanians. Until the end of the 16th century, Chams were still predominantly Christian, but by the end of the 17th century the urban centers had largely adopted Islam. The growth of an Albanian Muslim elite of Ottoman officials, like pashas and beys, such as the Köprülü family, who played an increasingly important role in Ottoman political and economic life, further strengthened this trend. In northern Chameria the vast majority became Muslims, while south of Acheron and down to Preveza, Albanians remained Orthodox. Muslim Chams were mostly followers of the Bektashi order, especially after the 18th century, when the Bektashis made considerable gains in influence in the rugged areas of southern Albania and neighbouring Greek Macedonia in northern Greece. The Chams have their own peculiar cultural identity, which is a mixture of Albanian and Greek influences as well as many specifically Cham elements. Although the Chams were primarily of Albanian origin, the Greek-speaking Muslims of Epirus also shared the same route of identity construction. Albanian Chams did not face any dilemma over their ethnic identity or relations with other Albanian socio-cultural and dialectal subdivisions. In general religion, and not ethnicity, defined each community in Ottoman society. Under this context the Muslim communities in Ottoman Epirus were classified as &quot;Turks&quot;, while the Orthodox as &quot;Greeks&quot; regardless of their ethnic origin, though some exceptions existed.

The process of Islamization of the Chams started in the 16th century, but it reached major proportions only in the 18th and 19th centuries. According to the population census (&quot;defter&quot;) of 1538, the population of the region was almost entirely Orthodox, with only a minority, estimated less than five per cent, having converted to Islam. The main instigator for the beginning of mass conversions in the region were the draconian measures adopted by the Ottomans after the two failed revolts of the Greek monk Dionysius the Philosopher as well as a number of Muslim local farmers, against the Ottomans. In their wake, the Ottoman pashas tripled the taxes owed by the non-Muslim population, as they regarded the Orthodox element a continuous threat of future revolts. Another reason for conversion was the absence of liturgical ceremonies in Chameria, especially in the northern part of the region. According to the French historian Fernand Braudel, in the wider region of which today is Southern Albania and Northwestern Greece, &quot;it lacked the church discipline; in the churches was not performed any religious ceremony, which meant that Christianity did not have deep roots there&quot;. This combination resulted in the first wave of conversions in the beginning of the 18th century, by a number of poor farmers. At this time Muslims became the majority in a few villages like Kotsika, near Sagiada. The wars of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries between Russia and the Ottoman Empire negatively impacted upon the region. Increased conversions followed, often forced, such as those of 25 villages in 1739 which are located in current day Thesprotia prefecture. During the entire 18th century, Muslims were still a minority among the Albanian population of the region, and became the majority only in the second half of the 19th century. Estimates based on the &quot;defter&quot; of 1875 show that Muslim Chams had surpassed Orthodox Chams in numbers.

In a number of cases however, only one person, usually the oldest male member of the family, converted into Islam, in order not to pay taxes, while all other members remained Christians. As a result, historians argue that the Cham Albanians were either Christian or Crypto-Christian as late as the first half of the 19th century. During the second half though the majority of Chams became fully islamized and Crypto-Christianity ceased to exist. As a result of the social structure of the Ottoman Empire, the Muslims of the region, the vast majority of whom were Albanians, being favored by the Ottoman authorities, were feuding with their Orthodox neighbors.

==== Albanian National Awakening (1870s–1912) ====

As Ottoman society was founded on the religion-based millet system and not on ethnic groups, schools in Chameria, as elsewhere where Albanians lived, were conducted only in Turkish and Greek. Christian Albanians could attend Greek schools, and Muslim Albanians Turkish schools, but Albanian language schools were highly discouraged. Nationalist sentiments during the late Ottoman era was weak in the region with Muslim Albanian Chams referring to themselves as &quot;Myslyman&quot;(Muslims) or &quot;Turks&quot; while local Orthodox Albanian speaking Christians referred to themselves as &quot;Kaur&quot; (i.e &quot;infidels&quot;) and did not find the term offensive. During the Albanian National Awakening a number of local Albanians would establish private, unrecognized Albanian-language schools. In 1870, the despot of Paramythia, Grygorios, translated the New Testament into Albanian, as his followers could not understand well the Greek language. While, in 1879, the first Albanian school of the region was created in Sagiada by father Stathi Melani. At that time, the region was under the short-lived rule of the League of Prizren. 
Some Chams also played an important role in the National Renaissance of Albania (&quot;Rilindja Kombëtare&quot;). Several Chams were heads of cultural clubs and patriotic organizations, which aimed at the establishment of an independent Albanian state. Amongst them, the most distinguished personalities during the last years before independence were Abedin Dino, Osman Taka and Thoma Çami.

Abedin Dino was one of the founders of the League of Prizren (1878) and one of the main contributors in the Albanian independence. He was appointed as the chief representative of the League of Prizren for Chameria, and established a local League branch in Ioannina. When the League was disbanded in 1881, he continued fighting against Ottoman forces in Albania. He was killed by the Ottoman army while on his way to participate in the formation of the League of Peja.

Another leader of the Prizren League active at the same time was Osman Taka. When the League of Prizren was formed he was named as the head of the local branch in Preveza. When the Ottoman forces managed to seize the Preveza League in 1886, Osman Taka too was arrested, accused of treason, and sentenced to death. He was executed in Konispol in 1897.

Thoma Çami was one of the main contributors to the revival of Albanian culture during this period. He was a founder and the first chairman of the organization &quot;Bashkimi&quot;, the best-known cultural club of the National Renaissance. He also wrote the first scholarly history book for Albanian schools, but died before the declaration of independence.

Albanian intervention occurred when after the Congress of Berlin in 1878, parts of Chameria, were to be ceded by the Ottoman Empire to the Kingdom of Greece. Even before negotiations started, the Ottoman side used a number of Albanian national figures for delaying purposes and appointed Abedin bey Dino, as Ottoman foreign minister. Moreover, Abedin Dino managed to gather various Albanian personalities in Preveza, from all over Albania and Epirus, who believed that the Ottomans will provide full support to the Albanian movement and were against annexation of Epirus to Greece. They also organized a meeting there in January 1879 and on 28 February 1879, signed a petition with a threat to take arms to prevent an annexation of Preveza to Greece. As a result of the unrest created, led by Abdyl Frashëri, another Albanian national figure, the local Ottoman governor was recalled. Abedin Dino was also recalled from Preveza, while the recently arrived Albanians left the city and returned to their homelands.

In January 1907 a secret agreement was signed between Ismail Kemal, a prominent leader of the then Albanian national movement, and the Greek government which concerned the possibility of an alliance against the Ottoman Empire. According to this, the two sides agreed that the future Greek-Albanian boundary should be located on the Acroceraunian mountains, thus leaving Chameria to Greece. As part of the agreement, Kemal in exchange asked the Greek authorities to support the Albanian movement and the Greek side agreed, provided that no armed Albanian activity will emerge south of the Acroceraunians. Kemal&#x27;s reasons for closer ties with Greece during this time was to thwart Bulgarian ambitions in the wider Balkans region and gain support for Albanian independence.

When the Ottoman defeat was imminent and before the arrival of the Greek army in the region, Muslim Cham and Lab armed units burned a number of Greek villages: 3 in the vicinity of Preveza (Tsouka, Glyky, Potamia), 4 in Thesprotia (Alpohori, Manoliasa, Keramitsa, Fortopia) as well as a number of villages in the regions of Ioannina, Sarande and Delvina. From these actions, many villagers managed to escape to the nearby island of Corfu. The local Orthodox Albanian speaking population did not share the national ideas of their Muslim Albanian speaking neighbours, whereas instead they remained Greek-oriented and identified themselves as Greeks.

Throughout this period the Albanian speaking zones in Thesprotia and adjacent areas that later became part of Albania was considered a nuisance for both the Greek state and Christians of Epirus who self identified as Greeks. The non-Greek linguistic factor posed a hindrance to Greek territorial ambitions. Tackling this issue was undertaken through two policies. The first was that Greek historians and politicians attempted through concerted efforts to conceal the existence of the Albanian language within the region. The second was to present the argument that the language spoken by the local population had no relation upon their national affiliations. According to the prevalent ideology in Greece at the time, every Orthodox Christian was considered Greek, whereas after 1913, especially the area of Southern Albania deemed &quot;Northern Epirus&quot; by Greece, Muslims were considered Albanians. With the incorporation of the area within Greece, these discursive policies alongside the practical were continued. This was due to the sizable Albanian Muslim population being considered a real problem for the Greek state and hence any pro-Albanian movement eventuating had to be eliminated by all means.

Chams had their own delegates in the Vlora Congress of 1912, when Albanian Independence was proclaimed. Four representatives from Chameria and two representatives of Ioannina took part in the congress, and the six of them were in favor of Independence. They were Jakup Veseli from Margariti, Kristo Meksi and Aristidh Ruci from Ioannina, Rexhep Demi from Filiates, Veli Gërra from Igoumenitsa, and Azis Tahir Ajdonati from Paramythia. The Muslim Cham communities in the regions of Paramythia, Margariti and Preveza, according to information gathered by the Greek foreign ministry during 1908 to 1911, were supporters of the Ottoman administration and shared an Ottoman national identity, while still being sympathizers of the Albanian national movement to a certain degree. Especially in the Sanjak of Preveza, Muslim Albanians embraced ideas regarding the Albanian national movement of the time. Amongst them large landowners and state employees who came from other places were hostile to the local Greek population and persecuted them. Also though unknown in numbers, the proportion of Muslim Albanians over a prolonged period increased within this area, due to official Ottoman resettlement policy regarding geo-strategic interests and concerns.

=== Modern history ===

==== Balkan Wars, World War I and first years of Greek rule (1913–1923) ====

With the onset of the Balkan Wars (1912–1913), Muslim Chams were uneager to fight as part of the Ottoman army. Nonetheless, most of the Lab and Cham beys formed irregular armed groups that fought against the Greek units, burning a number of villages in the regions of Paramythia, Fanari and Filiates. On the other hand some beys in Margariti were not willing to fight and were ready to accept Greek rule due to the general anarchy in the Ottoman Empire. Local Christians were enlisted as part of the Greek forces. Within a few days after the Greek army secured control of the region, a Greek Cretan paramilitary under commanders Deligiannakis and Spiros Fotis, killed 75 Cham notables of Paramythia who were gathered to pledge allegiance to the Greek state. Occurrences of atrocities perpetrated by Greek forces within the region were recorded mainly by the Albanian side, whereas those events were noted only indirectly, though clearly by Greek government officials. A few months later, more Cham notables were murdered by Greek authorities. In their internal correspondence, Italian diplomats in the region noted that this was a tactic employed to end Cham Albanian influence in the region by eliminating the elite class which had the role of dissemination of Albanian national ideology in the broader population.

Following the defeat of Ottoman forces in the Balkan Wars of 1912–1913, an international boundary commission awarded the northern part of the region of Epirus to the Principality of Albania, and the southern part to the Kingdom of Greece, leaving Greek and Albanian minority areas on both sides of the border. Most of the areas inhabited by Chams, except for a few villages, were assigned to Greece. After the end of the Balkan Wars, Greek authorities suspected that a local anti-Greek movement was possible, supported by the Provisional Government of Albania and Italy, and decided to disarm the population. Moreover, Albanian representatives accused Greece of assassinations and persecution of Cham representatives. These accusations were rejected by the Greek government. In the December 1915 legislative elections, due to the general boycott declared by the party of Eleftherios Venizelos, two of the three deputies of Preveza electoral periphery were Muslim Chams: Ali Dino and Musli Emin Ramiz. Persecution of Chams continued during World War I at a smaller scale than in the Balkan Wars. Many villages mainly in the former kazas of Filiates and Paramythia were burnt down.

After the final incorporation of southern Epirus into Greece, Chams had the right to choose between Greek and Turkish nationality, under the 4th provision of the Athens peace treaty. It can be inferred that during the Interwar period the Muslim Cham community did not appear to have a clear-cut understanding of their national affiliation beyond their local religious affiliations. Chams were in fact divided amongst themselves as to where their loyalties lay. In the event, the Chams chose the Greek nationality instead of the Turkish. This convention gave special rights to religious minorities, but not to ethnic minorities, under the third provision. In accordance with the Greek policy on minorities at the time, Orthodox Cham Albanians were counted together with Greeks, while the Muslim Chams were counted in the census as a religious minority. Although the Albanian government complained that Chams were discriminated against by the Greek authorities, there is little evidence of direct state persecution at this time.

During this period, the Muslim Cham beys lost the political power they enjoyed during Ottoman rule, but manage to briefly retain their economic influence. The Muslim portion of the population was under a &quot;sui generis&quot; rule of the Greek authorities and the local muftis, who were recognized in these areas. In the region of Epirus there were the muftis of Ioannina, Paramythia, Filiates, Margariti, Igoumenitsa, Parga, Preveza, Sagiada and Thesprotiko. Soon with the outbreak of WWI, Greek authorities imposed significant restrictions on land rights of Cham Albanian property owners. Additionally, a new tax system which targeted large estates of Muslim landowners was employed and massive grain expropriation was used again Cham properties to support Greek war effort. This led to starvation and dozen of deaths in the region. A military report of the Italian general commissioner to the Italian Ministry of Defence notes that from July 1917 onward the rule of the Greek authorities in Epirus had forced more than 3,000 Chams to seek refuge towards Istanbul and Anatolia.

==== Population exchange and appropriation of property (1923–1926) ====

At the conclusion of the Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922), Greece and Turkey signed the Treaty of Lausanne, according to which the Muslims of Greece would be exchanged with the Orthodox Christians of Turkey, making a unique exception for the Muslims of western Thrace and the Orthodox Christian population of Istanbul. The treaty used religion as the indicator of national affiliation, thus including Muslim Cham Albanians in the population exchange.

Greek officials had two options. The first was to exchange Muslim Chams with Greeks from Turkey, under the population exchange. The second option was to exchange them with a community of the Greek minority in Albania. They approached the Albanian government in 1923, but Albanian officials refused to consider the second scheme. In January 1923, the Greek representative of the population exchange committee regarding the Muslim Chams declared officially that Greece &quot;has no intention to proceed to an exchange of Muslims of Albanian origin&quot;.

Muslim Chams nevertheless were to become part of the Greek-Turkish population exchange, yet the Albanian state asked for an exemption. The majority of the Muslim Cham community had no idea of their ethnic origin or preferences beyond that of their local religious affiliations and considered themselves simply Muslims. Though by the time of the population exchange, the Muslim Cham population had been nationalized and constituted a &quot;de facto Albanian national minority&quot;. As such, Greek officials viewed the Muslim Chams as a population that were hostile to Greece’s national interest of security and territory. In doing so, the Greek state insisted on the Muslim Chams migration to Turkey by both handing down ultimatums and utilizing harassment tactics that were undertaken by local paramilitary groups to pursue that aim.

In May 1924 however, a delegation of the League of Nations visited the area to investigate the issue of exchangeability. The delegation met groups of Albanian Cham Muslims from various villages in the area that had been chosen by Greek authorities and local muftis. The local muftis were supportive of the Greek administration. Later, the delegation concluded that the vast majority of the Cham community declared that they were of Turkish origin and wished to be included in the exchange. One year later, a second commission in general confirmed the conclusions of the first one.

After pressure by Italian and Albanian delegates which made a case that the Chams primarily self-identified as Albanian nationals, Greece accepted in 1925, two years after the exchange had officially begun, that Muslim Chams were not subject to the exchange. The Greek minister in London, Kaklamanos, promised that &quot;the compulsory exchange shall not be applicable to the Moslem subjects of Albanian origin&quot;. But Muslim Chams had to prove their ethnic origin in order to remain in Greece. According to the Greek decision, which was presented by Eleftherios Venizelos to the local administration in Epirus, only those who were born in Albania or whose fathers were born in Albania could stay in Greece, thus excluding the genuine Chams of the Chameria region. On the other hand the Albanian state insisted that the Chams were forced to leave Greece because the Greek authorities were making life &quot;unbearable&quot; for them.

In the meantime, the Greek authorities did send a number of Cham Albanians to Turkey. According to the contemporary Greek political historian Athanasios Pallis, only 1,700 were exempted and the League of Nations estimated that 2,993 Muslim Chams were forced to leave for Turkey, even after their compulsory exchange was prohibited, by declaring themselves as Turks rather than Albanians. In Turkey, Cham Albanians were accommodated in Istanbul and Bursa. The majority of them were from Ioannina and outlying areas and Preveza. About 16,000 Greek refugees from Asia Minor were settled in Epirus, mainly in the same areas.

The members of the Muslim Cham community owned vast tracts of land without the accompanying title-deeds. Under the Treaty of Lausanne some of this land was appropriated, on financial terms agreed to with the owners, to meet the needs of the landless refugees from Anatolia and Thrace who were settled in Epirus. This measure was applied across the board and there were no exceptions: as well as the Chams, Greek landowners and monasteries were also required to give up some of their property. The Chams, however, sought compensation not as Greek citizens, but under the terms providing compensation for certain West European nationals whose property had been appropriated. Both Greece and the League of Nations rejected the demand.

Four different laws were passed between 1923 and 1937 that expropriated the properties of Muslim Chams, while leaving those of local Orthodox Albanian speakers and Greeks intact. Official Greek policy was that properties belonging to either Muslim citizens in Greece, who were exempt from the exchange of populations, or to foreign citizens, be preferentially expropriated. Albanian reports to the League of Nations and the reply by the Greek government reveal that part of the dispute concerned changes to the status of local Albanian landlords. During the Ottoman era, revenues were received by Albanian landlords from nearby villages. After these lands became part of the Greek state, local peasants expropriated from Albanian landlords what they considered was their property and refused to pay such taxes. While the majority of the Muslim Cham population consisted of middle sized land owners with land that varied in fertility, production and size. There were other Muslim Chams though who were more limited financially and in land.

The first law was passed on 15 February 1923, expropriating the lands and second homes of Muslim Chams, in order to give it to Greek refugees and to landless Greek farmers. Compensation was set at below 1914 market price, and not 1923 values. On the other hand, the compensation for the homes would be given by 1923 value. Nevertheless, some Chams were never compensated. As a result of this policy, a number of petitions were addressed to the Ministry of Agriculture or to the officials of the Refugee Settlement Commission from Muslims of Albanian origin in Paramythia, Dragoumi, Filiates, and other parts of the region, but no answer was given. This law was reported even to the League of Nations, but in June 1928 the Albanian petition against Greece was turned down. The Albanian government responded to these events with accusations of discrimination during 1925–1928. While the Greek side stated that the same expropriation policy was implemented nationwide for all Greek citizens.

However, during the period of 1922–1926, the Greek government used the settling of Greek refugees as a tool for applying pressure on Muslim Chams to leave Greece. These refugees in accordance with Greek law of the time took advantage of land expropriations and settled in the houses of Cham Muslims, which made some sell their land and become landless. There were also government restrictions on the right to lease, sell or cultivate land due to Muslim Chams being classified as &quot;exchangeable&quot; which led to the gradual financial devastation of the Muslim Cham population. Due to the fluidity of the situation, there were some Muslim Chams who sold their properties to the incoming refugees with a view of proceeding with a migration to Turkey, due to the exchange, while the League of Nations sought to be informed of those developments. As such, in 1925 the Greek government by means of a special operation was still trying to persuade Muslim Chams to leave the country. It was only by 1926, when the Muslim Chams were decided by the Greek government not to be exchanged that most of these refugees were resettled to other parts of Greece. Thereafter, only a limited number of Asia Minor Greek refugees remained in the region and were resettled throughout settlements within the provinces of Filiates, Margariti and Paramythia. After 1926, with the relocation of the refugees to other parts of Greece, the Greek government took careful discretion in Greek Epirus to implement its land reform and expropriations toward the Muslim Cham population so as to prevent discrimination occurring against them regarding the matter. In 1928, the Albanians took their concerns regarding property ownership, expropriations and restitution, issues over minimal socio-political representation and military recruitment. The League of Nations in its findings relegated the matter of property restitution or (re)-compensation of expropriated lands to bilateral negotiations. The League of Nations also stipulated that it would not deal with other raised Albanian concerns, as they had been subject to past reports and discussions. In sum, the League of Nations decision regarding the Greek position relating to the Muslim Chams was considered a clear vindication.

Reginald Leeper, the British ambassador at Athens in 1945, in a letter to the British Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden in April 1945 mention that the Greeks can blame Cham Albanians for the murder of the Italian General Enrico Tellini which was the pretext for the Italian bombardment and occupation of Corfu at 1923.

==== Pangalos regime (1926) ====

An unexpected turn in Chams&#x27; fate occurred when an Arvanite general, known for his pro-Albanian feelings, became prime minister of Greece. On 24 June 1925, a group of officers, fearing that the political instability was putting the country at risk, overthrew the government in a coup and their leader, Theodoros Pangalos became the head of the dictatorial government. His main priorities in foreign relations were to establish good relations with Albania and to protect the rights of both minorities, Chams in Greece, and Greeks in Albania. For this reason he officially decided that the Albanians of Chameria would not be sent to Turkey after 1926, putting an end to the population exchange. He also decided that refugees from Asia Minor would not settle in Chameria, but rather in Western Thrace, as was originally decided.

Pangalos was an Albanian-speaker, and declared himself proud of his half-Albanian identity. His priority in establishing good relations with Albania was soon materialized by four agreements between the two governments, among others addressing the confiscation of Cham properties before 1926, when Greek refugees from Asia Minor were settled in the region. This agreement stated that Chams would be compensated &quot;at least&quot; as much as foreign citizens or ethnic Greeks. In a public statement he also recognized that Chams were an ethnic minority and promised that Albanian schools would be opened in the region. But after a few months he was overthrown, and his pro-Cham policies were immediately abolished.

==== Discrimination and normalization (1927–1936) ====
In August 1926, Theodoros Pangalos was deposed by a counter-coup, and Pavlos Kountouriotis was restored as President of Greece. Pangalos&#x27; actions had encouraged Albania to be more persistent in pursuing Cham claims. Pangalos&#x27; overthrow also meant a backtracking of Greece&#x27;s official stance on the issue: discrimination against the Chams continued,

On the first elections in 1926, Cham Albanians created their own political party, called the Party of the Chameria founded by an eminent figure of that time, the famous Prevezan cartoonist Ali Dino. It managed to gain 1,539 votes from the Preveza and Ioannina prefectures. In the subsequent elections, the party did not gain the support of the local Albanian population and Ali Dino ran under Farmer-Labor ticket, gaining only 67 votes in 1932.

In 1927, the Greek government abolished four of the nine Vakoufs, the muftis of Parga, Preveza, Sagiada and Thesprotiko. Furthermore, beginning in 1927 with the publication of the relevant Presidential Decree, the Greek government implemented a policy depriving Muslim Chams and other minorities of their Greek citizenship if they would leave Greece. According to the 1927 decree, Greek citizens of non-ethnic Greek origin (&quot;allogeneis&quot;) could lose their citizenship if they left the country. Such a practice is seen by scholars as a legal exclusion of Chams and other minorities from Greek society, since it made a distinction based on national affiliation, which was effectively set as a criterion above citizenship in Greek legal order.

In 1929, the League of Nations asked Greece to open Albanian-language schools, since they had been officially recognized as an Albanian minority. The official position however of the then Greek prime minister, Eleftherios Venizelos, was that since the region had never had Albanian schools, even under the Ottoman Empire, this issue could not be compared with the rights demanded by the Greek minority in Albania.

Nevertheless, following pressure from the League of Nations and as a result of the agreements signed during Pangalos&#x27; regime, Greece officially announced the establishment of four bilingual primary schools in Filiates, Igoumenitsa, Paramythia and Sagiada. All these schools would be Greek, but Albanian would also be taught in the three first classes. An Albanian delegation led by the Albanian ambassador, Mid&#x27;hat Bey Frashëri, asked the Greek government for 15 schools, with full teaching in Albanian, in the main towns and villages of Chameria, a request that was immediately rejected by Greek officials. After negotiations, the Albanian government accepted the Greek proposal and an agreement was signed in 1935 that would allow the Greeks of Albania to open new private schools in Himara and Korca, in exchange for the four bilingual schools in Chameria. But once again, the change of the Greek government with the coup d&#x27;état of Ioannis Metaxas made this agreement void.

At this time, the Greek government tried to resolve another core issue pertaining to the Cham Albanians, the property dispute. In 1928, the Venizelos government had withdrawn from the Greco-Albanian agreement, signed by Pangalos that would compensate Chams equally with other Greek citizens. Muslim Chams tried to regain their properties under the Law of 1926, which gave them the opportunity to dispute the confiscation of their properties before the courts. Following these actions, Greece passed two laws, in 1930 and 1931, which gave bigger compensations to the Muslim community, but not as much as to other Greek citizens. The first law doubled the promised compensation, and forced the state authorities to give 3/4 of the promised compensation, even if they appealed the decisions in the courts. The second law returned some of the lands that were not settled by Greeks to Cham Albanians. Both laws were implemented on a limited scale, because of the change of the Greek government and the establishment of the dictatorial Metaxas Regime. At that time, members of the Cham community suffered from discrimination due to severe expropriations of their lands.

During this period, a number of villages were renamed in the region. More than 100 village names were changed in Thesprotia, Preveza and Ioannina. Many other names had already been changed in 1913 when the region came under Greek sovereignty. Villages like &quot;Shëndiela&quot; in Preveza were translated into Greek &quot;Agia Kyriaki&quot; (Saint Kyriake), while other toponyms such as &quot;Ajdonati&quot; or &quot;Margëlliç&quot; had been immediately renamed with new Greek names (&quot;Paramythia&quot; and &quot;Margariti&quot;). The majority of villages and towns of the region got new names, mainly Greek ones, in 1928 and 1929. Another period of &quot;Hellenization&quot; of toponyms occurred in the 1950s, when the remaining Albanian or Turkish names were finally renamed into Greek, with very few exceptions. Today, only a small number of Albanian toponyms, like &quot;Semeriza&quot; (from Albanian &quot;Shemërizë&quot;, meaning Saint Mary), survive from Ottoman times.

In September 1930, the proposal for exchange of the Cham minority with the Greek minority of Albania was renewed, this time by the Albanian government. King Zog of Albania attempted to reach an agreement with the Greek government on the resolution of all differences between the two countries. The Albanian government believed that a voluntary population exchange of the two minorities would resolve a number of internal problems for both sides and improve Greek-Albanian relations. However, this proposal was rejected by the Greek side, who feared that Albania would forcibly evict its Greek minority from the country, making the exchange involuntary.

The Venizelos government (1928–1932), despite the former Greek-Albanian crisis, took measures to intensify the improvement of the Cham communities both on economic and social basis. In 1931 a law was passed that allowed direct payment of reimbursement through the granting of analogous bonds and the direct return of improperly expropriated urban properties. A number of Cham families responded to these favorable regulations. Moreover, the Albanian government accepted the Greek proposal for the payment of indemnifications in bonds, allowing that way the promulgation of the relevant legislation and thus enabling the process of paying indemnification to the Albanian citizens. Thus, in 1935, according to Greek diplomatic reports, most of the Albanian demands that concerned the Cham communities appeared to be settled. In April 1930, the League of Nations heard claims by small property Muslim Cham landowners that illegal expropriations occurred within the region, while Greek authorities stated that the region had been exempted from those land reform laws. In June 1930, the Greek government passed a special law that properties within Thesprotia were exempt from the Agrarian land laws which satisfied the League of Nations regarding the matter. During this time though, there were ongoing efforts by Greek authorities to prompt the dislocation of the Muslim Cham population by means of hard-line policies and migration to Turkey, while discouraging or even forbidding it to Albania. The Muslim Chams by the 1930s were viewed in Greece as a hostile population and unable to be integrated within the socio-political structures of the state.

==== Repression under the Metaxas regime (1936–1940) ====
The harshest period of discrimination against Cham Albanians occurred during the dictatorial regime of Ioannis Metaxas, Prime Minister of Greece from 1936 to 1941. The nationalistic character of his regime was imposed on all minorities in Greece. As with Slavic-speakers, Aromanians and Roma, Albanian-speaking minorities were prohibited from using their own language outside home. Those who used Albanian words in school or in the army, were punished physically or humiliated. The Greek language was imposed in the schools and elders who had no knowledge of the language were forced to attend night-schools, in order to learn to read, write and even speak the Greek language. Meanwhile, either due to the absence of Greek or for reasons of demographic importance, Greek education was expanded with the establishment of kindergartens in some Orthodox Albanian speaking villages.

In 1936, the Greek state created a new prefecture called Thesprotia, from parts of Ioannina and Preveza prefectures, as to exercise better control over the Cham Muslim minority. The colonization of the area with Greeks and the confiscation of Cham property increased and Albanian place names were replaced with Greek ones. In villages where both Muslim Chams and Christians lived, Muslim heads of the local administration were replaced with Christian ones. During the same period harassment by the local police towards Chams became more and more frequent.

=== Second World War and expulsion ===
==== Greek-Italian War (1940–1941) ====
At the same time, a negative influence about the position of Cham Albanians came from Albania. Following the Italian invasion of Albania, the Albanian Kingdom had become a protectorate of the Kingdom of Italy. The Italians, especially governor Francesco Jacomoni, used the Cham issue as a means to rally Albanian support. Although in the event, Albanian enthusiasm for the &quot;liberation of Chameria&quot; was muted, Jacomoni sent repeated over-optimistic reports to Rome on Albanian support.

In June 1940 a Muslim Cham by the name of Daut Hoxha was found headless in the village of Vrina in Southern Albania. Daut Hoxha was a notorious bandit killed in a fight over some sheep with two sheperds. Hoxha&#x27;s death was used as the final excuse from fascist Italy in order to attack Greece. Italian propaganda officially described him as &quot;an Albanian from Chameria animated by great patriotic spirit&quot; murdered by Greek spies inside Albania, declaring the imminent liberation of Chameria. As the possibility of an Italian attack on Greece drew nearer, Jacomoni began arming Albanian irregular bands to use against Greece.

At the beginning of World War II, when Greece announced its full mobilisation prior to the Italian invasion, Cham Albanians requested to be included in said mobilisation; in response, Greece included them in the mobilisation but had them work in construction rather than give them arms, which alienated the Albanians. Cham Albanian community leaders were arrested and forced into exile by Greek authorities on the same day that Italy invaded Greece, giving the community indubitable proof that the Greek state held a negative perception towards the Chams and leaving their community without leadership, which probably influenced their behaviour towards the Greeks in the following months. When the Greek army reoccupied the area during the early stages of the Italian invasion, they exiled nearly the entire male population - specifically all males older than 14 - to camps on the islands of Lesbos, Chios and Corinth, which left the Cham Albanian women, children and elderly defenseless and unguarded, resulting in murders, rapes and robberies. The Greek forces turned a blind eye to the atrocities committed by local Greeks against Chams.

On the eve of the Greco-Italian War, Greek authorities disarmed 1800 Cham conscripts and put them to work on local roads. The Greco-Italian War started with the Italian military forces launching an invasion of Greece from Albanian territory. As Chams were used as a propaganda theme by Italians, the invasion force of Italy in Epirus was called &quot;Ciamuria Army Corps&quot;. Part of the Chams supported the Italy&#x27;s attack on Greece. The invasion force included native Albanians, estimated at 2,000–3,500 strong, (among them Chams and Kosovars), in three volunteer battalions attached to the Italian army. Their performance however was distinctly lackluster, as most Albanians, poorly motivated, either deserted or defected. Indeed, the Italian commanders, including Mussolini, would later use the Albanians as scapegoats for the Italian failure. During 28 October – 14 November while the Italian army made a short advance and briefly took brief control of part of Thesprotia, bands of Cham Albanians raided several villages and burned a number of towns, including Paramythia and Filiates.

In November, as the Greek counter-offensive managed to regain Thesprotia, the Greek authorities seized all Muslim Cham males not called up or with the Italians, and deported them to island exile for security reasons.
Until the invasion of Greece by the German army, the Muslim Cham population of the region of Chameria was composed of women, children and the elderly. The adult male Muslim Chams would be restored to their land only after fascist Italy gained control of the region. In 1941, Greece was occupied by German, Italian and Bulgarian armies, who divided the country in three distinct occupation zones.

==== Occupied Greece and collaboration with the Axis (1941–1944) ====
=====Italian occupation=====
Prior to the outbreak of World War II, 28 villages in the region were inhabited exclusively by Muslim Chams, and an additional 20 villages had mixed Greek-Cham populations. Germany was against the annexation of the region to Albania that time. Nevertheless, Fascist Italian as well as Nazi German propaganda promised that the region would be part of Great Albania after the end of the war. After the defeat of Greece, the establishment of the Italian occupation authorities in Epirus was completed up until middle May 1941 and the following month the first armed units consisting of Cham Albanians were active in the region. As a result of this pro-Albanian approach, large parts of the Muslim Cham population actively supported the Axis operations and committed a number of atrocities against the local population in Greece and Albania. Apart from the formation of an Axis collaborationist local administration and armed battalions, a paramilitary organization named &quot;Këshilla&quot; and a paramilitary group called &quot;Balli Kombëtar Çam&quot; were operating in the region, manned by local Muslim Chams. The results were devastating: many Greek, but even some Muslim Albanian and Orthodox Albanian speakers (Arvanites) lost their lives and a great number of villages were burned and destroyed. Assassinations of Greek officials, Albanian community leaders and other notables from both communities followed that perpetuated a cycle of revenge and retribution that worsened communal relations.

====German occupation====
From 29 July-31 August 1943, a combined German and Cham force launched an anti-partisan sweep operation codenamed &quot;Augustus&quot;. During the subsequent operations, 600 Greek and 50 Albanian citizens were killed and 70 villages were destroyed. On 27 September, combined Nazi-Cham forces launched large scale operation in burning and destroying villages north of Paramythia: Eleftherochori, Seliani, Semelika, Aghios Nikolaos, killing 50 Greek villagers in the process. In this operation the Cham contingent numbered 150 men, and, according to German Major Stöckert, &quot;performed very well&quot;. In another incident, on 27 September, Cham militias arrested 53 Greek citizens in Paramythia and executed 49 of them two days later. This action was orchestrated by the brothers Nuri and Mazar Dino (an officer of the Cham militia) in order to get rid of the town&#x27;s Greek representatives and intellectuals. According to German reports, Cham militias were also part of the firing squad. On 30 September, the Swiss representative of the International Red Cross, Hans-Jakob Bickel, while visiting the area, concluded that Cham bands are completely out of control, terryfing and committing atrocities against the unarmed Greek population.

After the capitulation of Fascist Italy, in September 1943, the local British mission proposed an alliance to the Chams and to fight together the Germans, but this proposal was rejected. Collaborationist Cham bands were also active in southern Albania. German General and local commander Hubert Lanz decided to initiate armed operations with the code name &quot;Horridoh&quot; in the region of Konispol, in Albania. Albanian nationalist groups participated in these operations, among them a Cham battalion of c. 1,000 men under the leadership of Nuri Dino. The death toll from these operations, which began on 1 January 1944 in the region of Konispol, was 500 people within Albania. Whereas, it appears that, most of the local beys, the majority of whom were part of the nationalist resistance group Balli Kombëtar (not to be confused with the collaborationist Balli Kombëtar Çam) and the mufti did not support such actions.

==== First expulsion ====

During the summer of 1944, the head of the local resistance organization, Napoleon Zervas, asked the Cham Albanians to join EDES in its fight against the left-wing ELAS, but their response was negative. After that and in accordance to orders given specifically to EDES by the Allied forces to push them out of the area, fierce fighting occurred between the two sides. According to British reports, the Cham collaborationist bands managed to flee to Albania with all of their equipment, together with half million stolen cattle as well as 3,000 horses, leaving only the elderly members of the community behind. On 18 June 1944, EDES forces with Allied support launched an attack on Paramythia. After short-term conflict against a combined Cham-German garrison, the town was finally under Allied command. Soon after, violent reprisals were carried out against the town&#x27;s Muslim community, which was considered responsible for the massacre of September 1943.

Moreover, two attacks took place in July and August with the participation of EDES Tenth Division and the local Greek peasants, eager to gain revenge for the burning of their own homes. According to Cham claims, which are not confirmed by British reports, the most infamous massacre of Albanian Muslims by Greek irregulars occurred on 27 June 1944 in the district of Paramithia, when this forces captured the town, killing approximately 600 Muslim Chams, men women and children, many having been raped and tortured before death. British officers described it as &quot;&quot;a most disgraceful affair&quot; involving &quot;an orgy of revenge&quot; with the local guerrillas &quot;looting and wantonly destroying everything&quot;. British Foreign Office reported that &quot;The bishop of Paramythia joined in the searching of houses for booty and came out of one house to find his already heavily laden mule had been meanwhile stripped by some andartes&quot;&quot;.

On the other hand Chris Woodhouse, the head of the Allied Military Mission in Greece during the Axis occupation, who was present in the area at the time, officially accepted the full responsibility of the decision for the expulsion of the Chams although he criticized the vendetta way in which this was carried out; including in his &quot;Note on the Chams&quot; military report of 16 October 1945 a brief description of the situation that led to the Paramythia events: &quot;Chams are racially part Turk, part Albanian, part Greek. In 1941-3 they collaborated with Italians, making the organization of guerilla resistance in that area difficult. I never heard of any of them taking part in any resistance against enemy. Zervas encouraged by the Allied Mission under myself, chased them out of their homes in 1944 in order to facilitate operations against the enemy. They mostly took refuge in Albania, where they were not popular either. Their eviction from Greece was bloodily carried out, owing to the usual vendetta spirit, which was fed by many brutalities committed by the Chams in league with the Italians. Zervas&#x27; work was completed by an inexcusable massacre of Chams in Philliates in March 1945, carried out by remnants of Zervas&#x27; dissolved forces under Zotos. The Chams deserved what they got, but Zervas&#x27; methods were pretty bad – or rather, his subordinate officers got out of hand. The result has been in effect a shift of populations, removing an unwanted minority from Greek soil. Perhaps it would be best to leave things at that.&quot;(PRO/FO,371/48094). During this time, small numbers of Muslim Roma from Filiates also fled to Albania alongside the Muslim Chams. They settled in village of Shkallë, near Sarandë, where due to immigration in recent years, some have resettled in Greece.

==== Resistance, Greek Civil War, repatriation by ELAS and final expulsion ====
As the end of World War II drew near, a small number of Muslim Chams became part of the Greek People&#x27;s Liberation Army (ELAS), as well as the anti-fascist National Liberation Army of Albania. In the ELAS, a mixed Cham Albanian-Greek battalion named IV &quot;Ali Demi&quot; battalion was formed, named after a Cham Albanian who was killed in Vlora fighting against the Germans. At the time of its creation in 1944, it consisted of 460 men, some of whom were Chams. However, the majority of the elites of the Cham community had become corrupted by the occupying forces and the atmosphere against the local Greeks who had suffered under Germans, Italians and Chams, led to an explosive polarization which would have constrained any motivation for joint Greek-Cham resistance.

Although there is no evidence of contribution against the Axis, Cham units in the ELAS participated in the first phase of the Greek Civil War fighting against the EDES. Having limited support in Epirus due to the right-wing EDES dominance in the area and in preparation of taking up the country&#x27;s control after the German withdrawal from Greece, turned to the Chams for conscription. Seeing the omens several hundred Muslim Chams enlisted in its ranks. Local ELAS forces with the participation of those Chams volunteers, aided with ELAS forces from the central Greece, attacked EDES in Epirus and succeeded to take the control in the Thesprotia region in late 1944. As a result of this short-term ELAS victory, in January–February 1945, about four to five thousand Chams returned to their homes from Albania, mainly in the border areas of Filiates and Sagiada. But after the final defeat of ELAS during the battle of Athens and its capitulation (see Varkiza Agreement), EDES veterans and local communities were eager to take revenge for the Cham&#x27;s participation. Led by an EDES veteran, Col. Zotos, a loose paramilitary grouping of former EDES guerrillas and local men went on a rampage. In this second massacre, committed at the town of Filiates, on 13 March, some sixty to seventy Chams were killed. Many of the Cham villages were burned and the remaining inhabitants fled across the border into Albania.

The exact number of Cham Albanians that were expelled in Albania and Turkey, is unknown. Mark Mazower and Victor Roudometof, state that they were about 18,000. while Miranda Vickers says that they were 25,000 that fled into Albania. Chameria Association claims that Cham Albanians that left were 35,000, from whom, 28,000 left to Albania and the rest to Turkey. After the war, only 117 Muslim Cham Albanians were left in Greece. Violence by the EDES groups was much more limited compared to incidents perpetrated against German populations that time throughout Europe, in particular by the advancing Soviet Army. EDES managed to secure control of the region after the initial conflicts.

=== Postwar situation (1945–1990) ===

Muslim Chams who fled to Albania were given refugee status by the communist-led Albanian government and were organized under the aegis of the Anti-Fascist Committee of Cham Immigrants (CAFC). The Albanian state gave them homes in specific areas in the south of the country, so as to dilute the local Greek element in the region (known as Northern Epirus to Greeks).

In 1946, they formed a congress, where they adopted a memorandum accusing Greece for their persecution, and asked the international community to react in order to return to their homeland and to receive reparations. The CAFC claimed that 28,000 Chams were evicted, 2,771 killed and 5,800 houses were looted and burned.

The new post-war Communist government of Albania took the Cham issue to the Paris Peace Conference, demanding the repatriation of the Chams and the return of their property. The following month a delegation of the CAFC was sent to Athens to lodge a protest with the government of George Papandreou. These demands were never answered. The United Nations Assembly in New York did however acknowledge the humanitarian crisis facing the refugees, and gave US$ 1.2 million via the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), specifically for refugees from northern Greece. Meanwhile, in 1945–1946, a Greek Special Court on Collaborators found 2,109 Chams guilty of treason &quot;in absentia&quot; and sentenced them to death, while their immovable property was confiscated by the Greek state. No war criminal of Cham origin has ever been brought to trial, however, as these had all managed to flee Greece in the aftermath World War II.

For those Albanian speaking communities in Thepsrotia who remained in Greece after 1945, their Albanian identity was discouraged as part of a policy of assimilation. The abandoned Cham villages were repopulated by adjacent Greek and Aromanian-speaking communities.

In 1953, the Albanian government gave all Chams the Albanian citizenship and forced them to integrate into Albanian society. Despite this, many older Chams still regard themselves as refugees deprived of their Greek citizenship and claim the right to return to their property in Greece.

==== Under the People&#x27;s Republic of Albania ====

During the People&#x27;s Republic of Albania (1944–1985) the country was governed by Enver Halil Hoxha. The 40-year period of Hoxha&#x27;s regime was characterized by the use of Stalinist methods to destroy associates who threatened his power. The regime was increasingly conspicuous towards the Cham community. It believed that they were of questionable loyalty and could easily become agents of a foreign power. This view was probably based because they were Greek citizens and their elites were traditionally rich landlords, while collaboration with the Axis and anti-communism were also significant factors that contributed to this. At the end of 1945, numerous Cham Albanians were imprisoned by the authorities of the People&#x27;s Republic of Albania, while they were branded as &quot;&quot;war criminals&quot;, &quot;collaborators of the occupation forces&quot; and &quot;murderers of the Greeks&quot;&quot;. Although the representatives of the community protested against these developments, this resulted in further arrests and exiles of Cham Albanians. Thus, the communist regime in Albania took a very distrustful view of the Cham community. Many of them were transferred further north, away from the southern border region.

In 1949, during the Greek Civil War (1946–1949), the leadership of the People&#x27;s Republic of Albania tried to mobilize the Cham community in order to fight with the communists. After their negative response they were labelled &quot;reactionaries&quot; and suffered a certain degree of persecution within Albania. Moreover, the Cham issue was neglected by the local regime. In 1947 the regime revealed a conspiracy in which 85 Chams were allegedly part in the creation of an armed nationalist group named &quot;Balli Kombëtar&quot;. In 1960 another anti-communist conspiracy was uncovered under Teme Sejko, a Cham admiral of the Albanian navy from Konispol. The alleged perpetrators, among them also 29 Chams, were accused as agents of &quot;American, Yugoslav and Greek separatists&quot;. As a result, Sejko was executed and several of his relatives persecuted, while other members of the Cham community were imprisoned.

== Current situation ==

=== Politics in post-communist Albania ===
Following the fall of the Communist regime, the Chameria Political Association was formed in Tirana in 1991. Since its creation, its goal is the collection and recording of personal testimonies and accounts from Chams who left Greece in 1944–45 and are now living in Albania – personal archives, documents and other data – in a bid to preserve the historical memories that the older generation carry with them.
In 1994, Albania passed a law that declared 27 June, the anniversary of the Paramythia massacre of 1944, as the &quot;Day of Greek Chauvinist Genocide Against the Albanians of Chameria&quot; and built a memorial at the town of Konispol. This decision has not received any international recognition. A number of Cham Albanian supporters pay tribute to the victims every 27 June in Saranda and Konispol. This event is called the &quot;Cham march&quot; (&quot;Marshimi çam&quot;). In 2006, the biggest Cham March, with around 10,000 people participating, occurred at the Albanian-Greek border. The participants designated themselves as Greek citizens of Albanian ethnicity and expressed the desire for &quot;a peaceful return to their homeland and to the graves of their forefathers&quot;

In March 2004, the Institute of Cham Studies (ICS) was established with a board of 7 members. According to Miranda Vickers, the Institute’s primary aim is to attempt to &quot;fill the huge gap in knowledge about the entire Cham issue&quot;. In the same year, the Chams also created their own political party, the Party for Justice and Integration (PJI), in order to campaign in the forthcoming parliamentary elections.

In 2005, a diplomatic incident occurred when the President of Greece, Karolos Papoulias canceled his planned meeting with Albanian counterpart, Alfred Moisiu, in Saranda, because 200 Chams were demonstrating about the Cham issue. The Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the Albanian authorities did not take adequate measures in order to protect the Greek President &quot;by deterring known extremist elements, who are trying to hinder the smooth development of Greek-Albanian relations&quot;. The Albanian president&#x27;s office stated that President Moisiu expressed &quot;deep sorrow at this unexplainable decision, which was based upon misinformation, of the small, peaceful and well monitored demonstration&quot;.

Recently, a few Chams have managed to find their way back to their families&#x27; old homes, and have tried to rebuild them. At the same time, several hundred ethnic Greek minority families from Albania have settled in towns such as Filiates.

=== In Greece ===

==== Muslims ====
The Greek census of 1951 counted a total of 127 Muslim Albanian Chams in Epirus. In more recent years (1986) 44 members of this community are found in Thesprotia, located in the settlements of Sybota, Kodra and Polyneri (previously Koutsi). Moreover, until recently the Muslim community in Polyneri was the only one in Epirus to have an imam. The village mosque was the last within the area before being blown up by a local Christian in 1972. The number of Muslim Chams remaining in the area after World War II included also people who converted to Orthodoxy and were assimilated into the local population in order to preserve their properties and themselves.

==== Christian Orthodox ====
According to a study by the Euromosaic project of the European Union, Albanian speaking communities live along the border with Albania in Thesprotia prefecture, the northern part of the Preveza prefecture in the region called Thesprotiko, and a few villages in Ioannina regional unit. In northern Preveza prefecture, those communities also include the region of Fanari, in villages such as Ammoudia and Agia. In 1978, some of the older inhabitants in these communities were Albanian monolinguals.

According to Hart, today these Orthodox Albanian speaking communities refer to themselves as Arvanites in the Greek language and self-identify as Greeks, like the Arvanite communities in southern Greece. On the other hand, Bugajski includes the Orthodox among Cham Albanians. They refer to their language in Greek as &quot;Arvanitika&quot; and when conversing in Albanian as &quot;Shqip&quot;. In contrast with the Arvanites, some have retained a distinct linguistic and ethnic identity, but also an Albanian national identity. In the presence of foreigners there is a stronger reluctance amongst Orthodox Albanian speakers to speak Albanian, compared to the Arvanites in other parts of Greece. A reluctance has been also noticed for those who still see themselves as &quot;Chams&quot; to declare themselves as such. Tom Winnifrith on short stays in the area (early 1990s) found it difficult to find Albanian speakers in urban areas and concluded in later years that Albanian is not longer spoken at all in the region. Amongst some Orthodox Albanian-speakers of the area, like the residents of Kastri village near Igoumentisa, there has been a revival in folklore, in particular in the performance of &quot;Arvanitic wedding&quot;.

=== In Turkey ===
Muslim Chams in Turkey form the second largest community of Chams, after Albania. This community was established after the two World Wars. After the First World War, Chams were forced to leave for Turkey during the population exchange, and another migration wave followed after the Second World War, when a minority of the Chams expelled from Greece chose Turkey over Albania because of their anti-communist sentiments. From 1913 to 1944, about 85,000 Albanians, most of whom were Chams, emigrated to Turkey.

The exact number of Muslim Chams in Turkey is unknown, but various estimates conclude that they number between 80,000 and 100,000, from a total population of 500,000 to 6 million of full or partial Albanian descent that live in Turkey. The Chameria Human Rights Association declares that most of them have been linguistically assimilated, although they maintain Albanian consciousness and regional Cham traditions. A considerable number of Chams in Turkey have changed their surnames to &quot;Cam&quot; or &quot;Cami&quot;, which in Turkish means pine, in order to preserve their origin. They are organized within the &quot;Albanian-Turkish Brotherhood Association&quot; (, ), which fights for the rights of Albanians.

=== In the United States ===

Chams in the United States are the fourth most numerous population of Chams, after Albania, Turkey and Greece. The majority of this community migrated to the United States shortly after their expulsion from Greece, because the Communist government in Albania discriminated and persecuted them. They managed to retain their traditions and language, and created the Cham League in 1973, Chameria Human Rights Association (see below), which later merged and became Albanian American Organization Chameria which aimed to protect their rights.

== Cham issue ==
=== Political positions ===
Albania demands the repatriation of the Muslim Chams who were expelled at the end of World War II, and the granting of minority rights. The Chams also demand the restoration of their properties, and reject a financial compensation. Greece on the other hand states that the expulsion of the Chams is a closed chapter in the relations between the two countries. However, Greece agreed to the creation of a bilateral commission, focused solely on the property issue as a technical problem. The commission was formally set up in 1999, but has not yet functioned.

During the 1990s, Albanian diplomacy used the Cham issue as counter-issue against the one related with the Greek minority in Albania. Chams complain that Albania has not raised the Cham issue as much as it should. It was raised officially only during a visit to Athens of former Albanian Prime Minister Ilir Meta at the end of 1999, during his meeting with his Greek counterpart, Kostas Simitis, but it received a negative response. After 2000, there was a growing feeling in Albania, since the Kosovo problem has been to an extent addressed, that the Albanian government should turn its attention to the Cham issue. On the other hand, that Greece is a member of the European Union and NATO, which Albania wishes to join, is one of the main factors why the Albanian government is reticent about the issue.

The Greek government on the other hand considers the Cham issue as a closed chapter. According to the Greek official position, the Chams would not be allowed to return to Greece because they have collaborated with the Italian-German invaders during the Second World War, and as such they are war criminals and are punished according to Greek laws. In an attempt to give a solution, in 1992 Prime Minister Konstantinos Mitsotakis proposed a trade-off in relation to their properties, only for the cases where their owners had certifiably not been convicted or participated in crimes against their fellow Greek citizens. Mitsotakis also proposed that the Albanian government likewise compensate ethnic Greeks who had lost properties due to alleged persecution during the communist regime in Albania. This proposal however was rejected by the Albanian side.

The Cham issue has been linked with the issue of the War Law, in the context of World War II and especially the war between Greece and Albania. Their exodus is connected with similar World War II events following the defeat of the Axis: such as the exodus of the German populations of Gdańsk, Pomerania, Silesia East Prussia and Sudetenland.
The case of the properties who are under sequestration, taking into account that the stance of war against Albania was revoked by the Greek government in 1987, is seen by some Greek law experts and the Albanian government as in force and thus preventing restitution or expropriation as they are interpreted as &quot;enemy property&quot;. Under the Greek law it is not certain if the case of the Cham properties can be classified as such. Nevertheless the restitution of these properties can be legally blocked due to &quot;activity against the state&quot;, which appears to be according to Greek law experts a significant factor in this case. The confiscated properties of those who collaborated with the Axis cannot raise any legal issue. The same appears to be the case of the abandoned properties which were expropriated in the 1950s.

The &quot;Cham Issue&quot; has not been a part of the agenda for international organizations. Since 1991, delegates of the Cham community have begun an attempt to internationalize the &quot;Cham Issue&quot;, but the only official support for this issue has come from Turkey. Meanwhile, in 2006, Members of the Party of Justice and Integration met European MEPs, including the chairwoman of Southwest Europe Committee on the European Parliament, Doris Pack and introduced their concerns about the Cham Issue. Although this group of MEPs drafted a resolution about this issue, it was never put to a vote.

In September 2016 the Enlargement Commissioner of the European Union Johannes Hahn mentioned the Cham issue as an &quot;existing one&quot; between Albania and Greece, alongside other matters that the two countries needed to resolve.

=== Citizenship issue ===
Following their expulsion in 1944, initially only the 2,000 or so Chams who were sentenced to death as collaborators were deprived of their Greek citizenship. The remainder, who represented the vast majority, lost theirs under a special law of 1947. Orthodox Albanian speakers within the region remained in Greece and retained the Greek citizenship, but without any minority rights. In 1953 the Albanian government forcefully granted the Albanian citizenship to the Chams, while in Turkey and the United States, the Chams have acquired the respective citizenships.

The Chams demand the restoration of the Greek citizenship as a first step towards solving the Cham issue. The restoration of the citizenship, rather that the regaining of the confiscated properties, is reported to be considered as the primary issue. They argue that the removal of their citizenship was a collective punishment, when even the Greek courts have charged a minority of Chams for alleged crimes. They have demanded dual citizenship, a policy followed by Greece in the case of the Greek minority in Albania.

=== Property issue ===

After World War II, the properties of Cham Albanians were put under escrow by the Greek state. In 1953, the Greek parliament passed a law, that considered as &quot;abandoned&quot; the rural immovable properties, whose owner had left Greece without permission or passport. After three years the properties were nationalized. Homes were nationalized in 1959, when a law passed by the Greek parliament considered them abandoned and allowed their conquest by other inhabitants of the region. These two laws nationalized Chams properties, and allowed others to settle in their homes, but the owner was the Greek state.
In the 1960s and 1970s an ad hoc commission for the property alienation in Thesprotia gave by draw the rural properties to farmers with and without land, while homes and urban properties in Igoumenitsa, Paramithia, Margariti, Filiates, Perdika and Sybota were given to homeless people.

=== Minority issue ===
The Chams are not a recognized minority by both global and peripheral international organizations, such as the United Nations and the OSCE. The decisions of the Cham representatives in general do not have any legal dimension or commitment in international politics.

Cham organizations ask for their repatriation and minority rights. They have also asked for minority rights for the Orthodox Albanian speakers residing in Greece. This position is supported even by politicians in Albania. In January 2000, the current Prime Minister of Albania, Sali Berisha, then head of the opposition demanded more rights for the Cham minority in Greece, which includes cultural rights for Albanians living in Greece, such as the opening of an Albanian-language school in the town of Filiates.

=== Incidents ===

The Cham issue has become a dispute in both countries, and several diplomatic incidents have occurred. It had been also used by the Albanian organizations of liberation armies (Kosovo and National Liberation Army), in order to fuel the irredentist dreams of the descendants of the Chams. Moreover, there is a reported paramilitary formation in the northern Greek region of Epirus, called the Liberation Army of Chameria As of 2001, the Greek police reported that the group consisted of approximately 30–40 Albanians. It does not have the official support of the Albanian government.

== Organizations ==
Chams have created a number of organizations, such as political parties, non-governmental associations and the Chameria Institute.

=== Chameria Association in Albania ===

The &quot;National Political Association &quot;Çamëria&quot;&quot; (in Albanian: &quot;Shoqëria Politike Atdhetare &quot;Çamëria&quot;&quot;), a pressure group advocating the return of the Chams to Greece, receipt of compensation and greater freedom for the Orthodox Albanian speakers in Greece, was founded on 10 January 1991. This associations holds a number of activities every year, with the help of the Party for Justice and Integration, as well as other organizations. Annually on 27 June, the Cham March is organized in Konispol. This march is held to remember the expulsion of the Chams. One particularly disingenuous endeavor by the organization leaders has been to create unhistorical links in the public mind by presenting the ancient Greek King Pyrrhus of Epirus (4th–3rd century BC) as an Albanian hero, thus revealing the extreme and irredentist aims of the association.

=== Chameria Association in the US ===

Chameria Human Rights Association (&quot;Shoqëria për të drejtat e Njeriut, Çamëria&quot;) is a non-governmental organization, based in Washington, DC, United States, which protects and lobbies for the rights of Chams.

It describes as its mission: the Right of Return of Chams &quot;to their homes in Greece and live there in peace and prosperity with their Greek brothers&quot;; the Property Rights; Other Legal Rights &quot;ensuring to the Cham people all other legal and minority rights deriving from the Greek Constitution and Laws, the Treaties and laws of the European Union, and other rights originating from international treaties and conventions to which Greece is a party&quot;; and the conservation and propagation of the rich history, culture, language, and other cultural aspects of the Cham people.

=== Democratic Foundation of Chameria ===

Another organization of Cham Albanians is based in The Hague, Netherlands. The Democratic Foundation of Chameria (&quot;Fondacioni Demokratik Çamëria&quot;) was founded in 2006 and aims to resolve the Cham issue, internationalizing the question in peaceful ways. Every year it organizes protests outside the International Court of Justice, where it intends to bring the Cham issue, if the governments of both countries will not find a solution.

The organization aims to resolve the Cham issue in three directions: &quot;lawfully and peacefully drawing attention to the legal position, the living and working conditions of the inhabitants and former inhabitants of Chameria; entering into negotiations with all types of organisations, both governmental and non-governmental; safeguarding the legal interest of inhabitants and former inhabitants of Chameria by means of legal proceedings, when necessary.&quot;

=== Party for Justice and Unity ===
The Party for Justice and Unity is a parliamentary party in Albania which aims to protect and uphold the rights of ethnic minorities inside and outside Albania, especially concerning with the Cham issue. The party was created after the 2009 parliamentary elections, in September from two deputies of the new Albanian parliament: the sole representative of Party for Justice and Integration, Dashamir Tahiri and Shpëtim Idrizi, a Cham MP of the Socialist Party. Currently it has 2 MPs in the Albanian parliament, which makes it the fourth biggest party in Albania.

=== Party for Justice and Integration ===

The Party for Justice and Integration (&quot;Partia për Drejtësi dhe Integrim&quot;), which represents the Chams in politics was formed in Albania in 2004. The party declares in its statute that it belongs to the center right, which is the political homeland for the vast majority of Chams marginalized by the Communist regime. Since the demise of the one-party state, the Chams have consistently put their faith in the center right parties to pursue their rights with Greece. However, the Chams are fully aware that Tirana’s politicians, whether Democrats or Socialists, only really focus on the Cham question during election time.

The party won the plurality of seats in the municipality of Saranda, Delvina, Konispol, Markat, Xarrë and was one of the main parties in big municipalities like Vlora, Fier, etc, on the last municipal elections in 2007.

=== Chameria Institute ===
In March 2004, the Institute of Cham Studies (&quot;Instituti i Studimeve Çame&quot;), also known as Chameria Institute or &quot;Institute of Studies on the Cham issue&quot; was established with a board of 7 members. The Institute’s primary aim is to attempt to &quot;fill the huge gap in knowledge about the entire Cham issue&quot;. One of the first actions taken by the board of the ICS was to hold the first ever Cham Conference in Tirana in May 2004.

Its declares as its mission, &quot;to make researches in the history and culture fields of the cham community as an inherent and important part of the Albanian nation.&quot; Also it seeks &quot;to evolve and stimulate public scientific debate and to accomplish studies&quot;, &quot;to organize scientific activities and publishes their outputs.&quot; Institute of Cham Studies seeks &quot;to create a wide contacts network with analog research centers in Albania and abroad (Balkan, Europe and Northern America) and participating in mutual activities.&quot;

=== Cultural Association &quot;Bilal Xhaferri&quot; ===

In 1993, a group of journalists and writers of Cham origin, founded in Tirana the Cultural Association &quot;Bilal Xhaferri&quot; (&quot;Shoqata Kulturore &quot;Bilal Xhaferri&quot;&quot;), nicknamed also as &quot;the Cultural Community of Chameria&quot; (&quot;Komuniteti Kulturor i Çamërisë&quot;). The association is a non-profit organization which aims to keep and promote the values of Cham Albanian culture and tradition. The association has established a publishing house, which publishes books especially about Chams and Chameria. It is named after the well-known dissident writer, Bilal Xhaferri and since its creation has published in Albania, Kosovo and the Republic of Macedonia, his hand-written memoirs and stories which were incomplete due to Xhaferri&#x27;s premature death.

== Demographics ==
According to Miranda Vickers, the Chams number approximately 690,000. According to Cham organizations, the descendants of the &quot;original Chams&quot; number 170,000. Many of them live in Albania, while other communities live in Greece, Turkey and the USA. Their religions are Islam and Orthodox Christianity.

=== Historical demographics ===
The population of the region of Chameria was mainly Albanian and Greek, with smaller minorities. In the early 19th century, Greek scholar and secretary of the local Ottoman Albanian ruler Ali Pasha, Athanasios Psalidas, stated that Chameria was inhabited by both Greeks and Albanians. The later were divided between Christians and Muslims, while Greeks were the dominant element of Chameria. There was a dispute regarding the size of the Albanian population of the region, while in the 20th century some believe the term &quot;Cham&quot; applies only to Muslims. According to a contemporary Armenian American estimate from &quot;The New Armenia&quot; in 1912, there was a global total of 1,500,000 Tosk Albanians, of which 200,000 were Chams. According to 1913 Greek census, in Chameria region were living 25,000 Muslims whose mother tongue was Albanian, in a total population of about 60,000, while in 1923 there were 20,319 Muslim Chams. In Greek census of 1928, there were 17,008 Muslims who had as mother tongue the Albanian language. During the interwar period, the numbers of Albanian speakers in official Greek censuses varied and fluctuated, due to political motives and manipulation.

An estimation by Italian occupational forces during World War II (1941) included also Orthodox communities of Albanian ethnicity. According to this in the region lived 54,000 Albanians, of whom were 26,000 Orthodox and 28,000 Muslim and 20,000 Greeks. After the war, according to Greek censuses where ethno-linguistic groups were counted, Muslim Chams were 113 in 1947 and 127 in 1951. In the same Greek census of 1951, 7,357 Orthodox Albanian-speakers were counted within the whole of Epirus.

=== Current demographics ===
In 1985, the Albanian population of Epirus, including Chameria and two villages in Konitsa was estimated 30,000. In 2002, according to author Miranda Vickers, in Chameria, the Orthodox Albanian population was estimated at 40,000. However, some scholars claim the term &quot;Cham&quot; in the 20th century applied only to Muslims, while both the Orthodox Albanian (Arvanitika) speaking and bilingual (Greek-Albanian) communities of the region identify with the Greek state and are part of the Greek nation. In the region today resides a small number post-1991 Albanian immigrants.

Albanian is still spoken by a minority of inhabitants in Igoumenitsa. According to Ethnologue, Albanian language is spoken by about 10,000 Albanians in Epirus and the village of Lechovo, in Florina.

The only exact number of Chams in Albania comes from 1991, when Chameria Association held a census, in which were registered about 205,000 Chams.

=== Religion ===

Chams living today in Albania are overwhelmingly Muslim, but it is difficult to estimate their current religious affiliation: the former Communist regime had proclaimed the country &quot;the only atheistic state in the world&quot;, and even after its fall, the majority of the population self-declared agnostic, or irreligious. Current estimates conclude that this applies to a majority of Albanians, with 65–70 per cent of the population not adhering to any religion. Conversely, in Greece and Turkey almost all of Chams adhere to their country&#x27;s respective prevailing religion.

== Language ==
Cham Albanians speak the Cham dialect (&quot;Çamërisht&quot;), which is a sub-branch of the Tosk Albanian dialect. The Cham dialect is one of the southernmost dialects of the Albanian language, the other one in Greece being the Arvanitic dialect of southern Greece, which is also a form of Tosk Albanian. As such, &quot;Arvanitika&quot; and Cham dialect retain a number of common features.

Albanian linguists say that this dialect is of great interest for the dialectological study and the ethno-linguistic analysis of the Albanian language. Like &quot;Arvanitika&quot; and the Arbëresh varieties of Italy, the dialect retains some old features of the Albanian, such as the old consonant clusters , , which in standard Albanian are &quot;q&quot; and &quot;gj&quot;, and instead of .

Linguists say that these features give the Cham dialect a conservative character, which is due to the close proximity and its continuous contacts with the Greek language. They argue that this conservative character, which is reflected in a number of peculiar features of the dialect, is endangered, as are the Albanian toponyms of the region, which are no longer in use, and which have provided valuable material for research into the historical evolution of Albanian.

== Literature and media ==
=== Literature ===
The first Albanian-language book written in the region of Chameria was the Greek-Albanian dictionary by Markos Botsaris, a Souliote captain and prominent figure of the Greek War of Independence. This dictionary was the biggest Cham Albanian dictionary of its time, with 1,484 lexemes. According to albanologist Robert Elsie, it is not of any particular literary significance, but is important for our knowledge of the now extinct Suliot-Albanian dialect, a sub-branch of the Cham dialect. The dictionary is preserved at the &quot;Bibliothèque Nationale&quot; in Paris.

During the 19th century, Chams started creating bejtes, which were a new kind of poems, mainly in Southern Albania. The most well-known &quot;bejtexhi&quot; was Muhamet Kyçyku (Çami), born in Konispol. He is the only poet in Albania that has written in the Cham dialect and was apparently also the first Albanian author to have written longer poetry. The work for which he is best remembered is a romantic tale in verse form known as &quot;Erveheja&quot; (&quot;Ervehe&quot;), originally entitled &quot;Ravda&quot; (&quot;Garden&quot;), written about 1820. Kyçyku is the first poet of the Albanian National Renaissance.

In the modern period, the best-known Albanian writer is Bilal Xhaferri, who is considered as the most influential dissident under the Communist regime. He was born in Ninat, but was forced to migrate in the United States at an early age because of his anticommunism. He lived and died in Chicago, at 51 years of age, but he contributed to Albanian literature with more than 12 books of novels and poems. Canadian albanologist Robert Elsie considers him &quot;the best Cham Albanian writer and poet.&quot;

=== Media ===
The Chams&#x27; culture and politics are represented by three local media in Albania and the United States. Due to the harsh Communist regime in Albania, Chams did not manage to publish any media in the 1945–1990 period. On the other hand, Cham emigrants in the United States established a newspaper and a magazine, both edited by Bilal Xhaferri, and headquartered in Chicago. The first Cham Albanian newspaper was published in 1966, named &quot;Chameria – motherland&quot;. (&quot;Çamëria – Vatra amtare&quot;), and is still being published in Chicago, while the magazine &quot;Eagle&#x27;s wing&quot; (&quot;Krahu i shqiponjës&quot;) started publishing in 1974.

The newspaper &quot;Chameria - motherland&quot; is mainly political, and tries to internationalize the Cham issue. In 1991 it became the official newspaper of the National Political Association &quot;Çamëria&quot;, and since 2004 it is also the official newspaper of Party for Justice and Integration. The newspaper is published in Albania by a joint editorial board of the organization and the party, while in the United States it is published by Chameria Human Rights Association.

On the other hand, the magazine &quot;Eagle&#x27;s wind&quot; is primarily a cultural magazine and is no longer published in the US since 1982. The Cultural Organization &quot;Bilal Xhaferri&quot; republished the magazine in Tirana, and since 1994 it is self-described as a monthly &quot;cultural Cham magazine&quot;.

== Traditions ==
=== Music ===
Cham Albanians&#x27; music has its own features, which makes it differ from that of other Albanian music. Cham Albanian folk music can be divided into three main categories: the iso-polyphonic, the polyphonic and the folk ballads.

According to German scholar Doris Stockman, Cham music &quot;may give an impact to further explain the inner Albanian relationships, among the vocal practices of the various folk groups in South Balkan, more than it had been done that far, as well as to offer new material to comparative studies concerning the complex of problems of the folk polyphony in Europe&quot;.

Iso-polyphony is a form of traditional Albanian polyphonic music. This specific type of Albanian folk music is proclaimed by UNESCO as a &quot;Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity&quot;. Chams sing a different type, called the cham iso-polyphony. Although they border with Lab Albanians, their iso-polyphony is influenced more by the Tosk type. The song of Çelo Mezani, a polyphonic folk song narrating and lamenting the death of Cham Albanian revolutionary Çelo Mezani is considered to be the best-known Cham Albanian song.

=== Dances ===

Cham Albanian dances are well-known in Albania. The best-known is the Dance of Osman Taka.
This Dance is linked with Osman Taka, a Cham Albanian leader who fought against Ottoman forces, and who managed to escape from death by amazing Ottoman forces with this dance. It is an old Cham dance, but under this name its known only since the 19th century.
The Dance of Zalongo (Albanian: &quot;Vallja e Zallongut&quot;) refers to an event in history involving a mass suicide of women from Souli and their children. The name also refers to a popular dance song commemorating the event. It is inspired by an historical event of December 1803, when a small group of Souliot women and their children were trapped by Ottoman troops in the mountains of Zalongo in Epirus. In order to avoid capture and enslavement, the women threw first their children and then themselves off a steep cliff, committing suicide. The song of the dance goes as follows in Albanian:

=== Folklore ===
In 1889, the Danish ethnographer Holgert Pedersen collected Cham folk tales and published them in Copenhagen nine years later, in the book &quot;On Albanian folklore&quot; (&quot;Zur albanesischen Volkskunde&quot;). More than 30 Cham folk tales were collected, the majority of which about bravery and honor. The Chams of the southern Chameria region believe that they are descended from the legendary &quot;jelims&quot;, giants from southern Albanian mythology, whose name derives from the Slavic transmission of the Greek word Έλλην (&quot;ellin&quot;) which means &quot;Greek&quot;.

== Lifestyle ==
=== Dress ===
The folk outfits of the region are colorful. The most common men&#x27;s outfit for Muslims and orthodox was the kilt known as fustanella, embroidered with silver thread, the doublet, short shirt with wide sleeves, the fez, the leather clogs with red topknots and white knee socks. Other parts of the outfit were the silver chest ornamental and the holster embroidered with silver thread used to carry a gun or a pistol.

This kind of dress was common for all Albanians, but there was difference in the length in the south where men, including the Chams, wore shorter ones, up to the knee. The kilt of high society men was made of many folds (about 250 – 300) and later was substituted by slacks and the former one was only used on special occasions.

The common outfit for the women became a kind of oriental silk or cotton baggy pants. They wear the cotton pants daily, whereas the silk ones only on special occasions. Other parts of this outfit were: the silk shirt weaved in their home looms and the vest embroidered with gold or silver thread, which sometimes was completed with a velvet waistcoat on it.

During 1880–1890 the town women mostly wore long skirts or dresses. They were dark red or violet and embroidered with gold thread. Other parts of this outfit were the sleeveless waistcoats, silk shirts with wide sleeves embroidered with such a rare finesse. On special occasions they also put on a half-length coat matching the color of the dress. It was embroidered with various flowery motives. Another beautiful part of the outfit is the silver belt, the silk head kerchief and a great number of jewelry such as earrings, rings, bracelets, necklaces etc.

=== Architecture ===

The main architectural monuments in the region of Chameria that belonged to Chams were mosques, homes and Muslim cemeteries, as well as old Albanian towers, known in Albanian as &quot;Kullas&quot;, which have survived, only because they are in the middle of forests scrub land, in old military zones near the Albanian border. The majority of them have been disappeared.

But, there are very few surviving mosques, which were transformed into museums, following the model of the Yugoslav communists, despite the existence of some Muslims in many localities. Muslim cemeteries are frequently desecrated by modern building works, particularly road building.

At the same time, Cham domestic and administrative buildings, mosques and cultural monuments are slowly covered by vegetation. Pasture lands once used by Chams for their cattle is now converged into forests, because of the depopulation of the region. Thus the geographical and architectural legacy of Cham presence in north western Greece is gradually vanishing.

=== Cuisine ===

Cham Albanians cuisine is seen as a mixture of Albanian and Greek cuisine, and maintains the main characteristics of the Mediterranean and the Ottoman cuisine. Their cuisine includes many kinds of cheese. Lamb is mostly baked with yogurt, differently from other cuisines. This dish has become one of the most popular in Albania.

As with the majority of Mediterranean cuisines, Chams use a lot of vegetables and olive oil. The most common appetizers are trahana and tarator, while seafood soups are part of their cuisine. Chams are well-known in Albania for the different ways of making bread and traditional Turkish pies, the börek (called byrek in Albanian).

<text>Disco Demolition Night was a Major League Baseball (MLB) promotion on Thursday, July 12, 1979, at Comiskey Park in Chicago, Illinois, that ended in a riot. At the climax of the event, a crate filled with disco records was blown up on the field between games of the twi-night doubleheader between the Chicago White Sox and the Detroit Tigers. Many had come to see the explosion rather than the games and rushed onto the field after the detonation. The playing field was so damaged by the explosion and by the rioters that the White Sox were required to forfeit the second game to the Tigers.

In the late 1970s, dance-oriented disco was the most popular music genre in the United States, particularly after being featured in hit films such as &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; (1977). However, disco sparked a major backlash from rock music fans—an opposition prominent enough that the White Sox, seeking to fill seats at Comiskey Park during a lackluster season, engaged Chicago shock jock and anti-disco campaigner Steve Dahl for the promotion at the July 12 doubleheader. Dahl&#x27;s sponsoring radio station was WLUP (97.9 FM, now WCKL), so admission was discounted to 98 cents for attendees who turned in a disco record; between games, Dahl was to destroy the collected vinyl in an explosion.

White Sox officials had hoped for a crowd of 20,000, about 5,000 more than usual. Instead, at least 50,000—including tens of thousands of Dahl&#x27;s listeners—packed the stadium, and thousands more continued to sneak in after capacity was reached and gates were closed. Many of the records were not collected by staff and were thrown like flying discs from the stands. After Dahl blew up the collected records, thousands of fans stormed the field and remained there until dispersed by riot police.

The second game was initially postponed, but was forfeited to the Tigers the next day by order of American League president Lee MacPhail. Disco Demolition Night preceded, and may have helped precipitate, the decline of disco in late 1979; some scholars and disco artists have debated whether the event was expressive of racism and homophobia. Disco Demolition Night remains well known as one of the most extreme promotions in MLB history.

== Background ==

Disco evolved in the late 1960s in inner-city New York City nightclubs, where disc jockeys played imported dance music. Although its roots were in African-American and Latin American music, and in gay culture, it eventually became mainstream; even white artists better known for more sedate music had disco-influenced hits, such as Barry Manilow&#x27;s &quot;Copacabana&quot;. The release of the hit movie &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; in 1977, whose star (John Travolta) and musical performers (the Bee Gees) presented a heterosexual image, helped popularize disco in the United States. As Al Coury, president of RSO Records (which had released the bestselling soundtrack album for the film) put it, &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; &quot;took disco out of the closet&quot;.
Some felt disco was too mechanical; &quot;Time&quot; magazine deemed it a &quot;diabolical thump-and-shriek&quot;. Others hated it for the associated scene, with its emphasis on personal appearance and style of dress. The media emphasized its roots in gay culture. According to historian Gillian Frank, &quot;by the time of the Disco Demolition in Comiskey Park, the media ... cultivated a widespread perception that disco was taking over&quot;. Performers who cultivated a gay image, such as the Village People (described by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; as &quot;the face of disco&quot;), did nothing to efface these perceptions, and fears that rock music would die out increased after disco albums dominated the 21st Grammy Awards in February 1979.

In 1978, WKTU (now WINS-FM) in New York, a low-rated rock station, switched to disco and became the most popular station in the country; this led other stations to try to emulate its success. In Chicago, 24-year-old Steve Dahl was working as a disc jockey for ABC-owned radio station WDAI (now WLS-FM) when he was fired on Christmas Eve 1978 as part of the station&#x27;s switch from rock to disco. He was hired by rival album-rock station WLUP. Sensing an incipient anti-disco backlash and playing off the publicity surrounding his firing (he frequently mocked WDAI&#x27;s &quot;Disco DAI&quot; slogan on the air as &quot;Disco DIE&quot;), Dahl created a mock organization, the &quot;Insane Coho Lips&quot;, an anti-disco army consisting of his listeners. According to Andy Behrens of ESPN, Dahl and his broadcast partner Garry Meier &quot;organized the Cohos around a simple and surprisingly powerful idea: Disco Sucks&quot;.

According to Dahl, in 1979, the Cohos were locked in a war &quot;dedicated to the eradication of the dreaded musical disease known as DISCO&quot;. In the weeks leading up to Disco Demolition Night, Dahl promoted a number of anti-disco public events, several of which became unruly. When a  in Lynwood, Illinois, switched from disco to rock in June, Dahl arrived, as did several thousand Cohos, and the police were called. Later that month, Dahl and several thousand Cohos occupied a teen disco in the Chicago suburbs. At the end of June, Dahl urged his listeners to throw marshmallows at a WDAI promotional van at a shopping mall where a teen disco had been built. The Cohos chased the van and driver and cornered them in a park, though the situation ended without violence. On July 1, a near-riot occurred in Hanover Park, Illinois, when hundreds of Cohos could not enter a sold-out promotional event, and fights broke out. Some 50 police officers were needed to control the situation. When disco star Van McCoy died suddenly on July 6, Dahl marked the occasion by destroying one of his records, &quot;The Hustle&quot;, on the air.
Dahl and Meier regularly mocked disco records on the radio. Dahl also recorded his own song, &quot;Do Ya Think I&#x27;m Disco?&quot;, a parody of Rod Stewart&#x27;s disco-oriented hit &quot;Da Ya Think I&#x27;m Sexy?&quot;. The song characterized as populated by effeminate men and frigid women. The protagonist, named Tony after Travolta&#x27;s character in &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot;, is unable to attract a woman until he abandons the disco scene, selling his white three-piece suit at a garage sale and melting down his gold chains for a Led Zeppelin belt buckle.

A number of anti-disco incidents took place elsewhere in the first half of 1979, showing that &quot;the Disco Demolition was not an isolated incident or an aberration.&quot; In Seattle, hundreds of rock fans attacked a mobile dance floor, while in Portland, Oregon, a disc jockey destroyed a stack of disco records with a chainsaw as thousands cheered. In New York, a rock DJ played Donna Summer&#x27;s disco hit &quot;Hot Stuff&quot; and received protests from listeners.

=== Baseball ===
Since the 1940s, Chicago White Sox owner Bill Veeck had been noted for using promotions to increase fan interest; he stated &quot;you can draw more people with a losing team plus bread and circuses than with a losing team and a long, still silence&quot;. His son, Mike Veeck, was the promotions director for the White Sox in 1979. Mike wrote in a letter to a fan before the season that team management intended to make sure that whether the White Sox won or lost, the fans would have fun.

Early in the 1979 season, a game between the White Sox and the visiting Tigers scheduled for Wednesday, May 2, was rained out. Officials rescheduled it as part of a twi-night doubleheader on Thursday, July 12. Already scheduled for the evening of July 12 was a promotion aimed at teenagers, who could purchase tickets at half the regular price.

The White Sox had a &quot;Disco Night&quot; at Comiskey Park in 1977; At a WLUP Promotion Meeting, Schwartz mentioned that the White Sox were looking to do a promotion with the station. The station had already done two successful events at local Chicago-area nightclubs with overflow crowds. When Schwartz mentioned the White Sox were looking for a promotion, Promotion Director Dave Logan suggested it might be time to take Steve Dahl&#x27;s event to a larger venue. The matter had also been brought up early in the 1979 season when Schwartz told Mike Veeck of Dahl and his plans to blow up a crate of disco records while live on the air from a shopping mall. Dahl was asked if he would be interested in blowing up records at Comiskey Park on July 12. Since the radio frequency of WLUP was 97.9, the promotion for July 12, &quot;Disco Demolition Night&quot; (in addition to the offer for teenagers) was that anyone who brought a disco record to the ballpark would be admitted for 98 cents. Dahl was to blow up the collected records between games of the doubleheader.

== Event ==
 In the weeks before the event, Dahl invited his listeners to bring records they wanted to see destroyed to Comiskey Park. He feared that the promotion would fail to draw people to the ballpark and that he would be humiliated. The previous night&#x27;s attendance had been 15,520, and Comiskey Park had a capacity of 44,492. The White Sox were not having a good year, and were  going into the July 12 doubleheader. The White Sox and WLUP hoped for a crowd of 20,000, and Mike Veeck hired enough security for 35,000.

Owner Bill Veeck was concerned the promotion might become a disaster and checked himself out of the hospital, where he had been undergoing tests. His fears were substantiated when he saw the people walking towards the ballpark that afternoon; many carried signs that described disco in profane terms.

The doubleheader sold out, leaving at least 20,000 people outside the ballpark. Some leapt turnstiles, climbed fences, and entered through open windows. The attendance was officially reported as 47,795, though Bill Veeck estimated that there were anywhere from 50,000 to 55,000 in the park—easily the largest crowd of his second stint as White Sox owner. The Chicago Police Department closed off-ramps from the Dan Ryan Expressway near the stadium. Attendees were supposed to deposit their records into a large box, some tall; once the box was overflowing, many people brought their discs to their seats.

The first game was to begin at 6:00 pm CDT, with the second game to follow. Lorelei, a model who did public appearances for WLUP and who was popular in Chicago that summer for her sexually provocative poses in the station&#x27;s advertisements, threw out the first pitch. As the first game began, Mike Veeck received word that thousands of people were trying to get into the park without tickets and sent his security personnel to the stadium gates to stop them. This left the field unattended, and fans began throwing the uncollected disco LPs and singles from the stands. Tigers designated hitter Rusty Staub remembered that the records would slice through the air, and land sticking out of the ground. He urged teammates to wear batting helmets when playing their positions, &quot;It wasn&#x27;t just one, it was many. Oh, God almighty, I&#x27;ve never seen anything so dangerous in my life.&quot; Attendees also threw firecrackers, empty liquor bottles, and lighters onto the field. The game was stopped several times because of the rain of foreign objects.

Dozens of hand-painted banners with such slogans as &quot;Disco sucks&quot; were hung from the ballpark&#x27;s seating decks. White Sox broadcaster Harry Caray saw groups of music fans wandering the stands. Others sat intently in their seats, awaiting the explosion. Mike Veeck recalled an odor of marijuana in the grandstand and said of the attendees, &quot;This is the Woodstock they never had.&quot; The odor permeated the press box, which Caray and his broadcast partner, Jimmy Piersall, commented on over the air. The crowds outside the stadium also threw records, or gathered them and burned them in bonfires. 

Detroit won the first game, 4–1.

== Explosion ==
 At 8:40, Dahl, dressed in army fatigues and a helmet, emerged onto the playing surface together with Meier and Lorelei. They circled the field in a Jeep, showered (according to Dahl, lovingly) by his troops with firecrackers and beer, then proceeded to center field where the box containing the records awaited, rigged with explosives. Dahl and Meier warmed up the crowd, leading attendees in a chant of &quot;disco sucks.&quot; Lorelei recalled that the view from center field was surreal. On the mound, White Sox pitcher Ken Kravec, scheduled to start the second game, began to warm up. Other White Sox, in the dugout and wearing batting helmets, looked out upon the scene. Fans who felt events were getting out of control and who wished to leave the ballpark had difficulty doing so; in an effort to deny the intruders entry, security had padlocked all but one gate.

Dahl told the crowd:

Dahl set off the explosives, destroying the records and tearing a large hole in the outfield grass. With most of the security personnel still watching the gates per Mike Veeck&#x27;s orders, there was almost no one guarding the playing surface. Soon, the first of 5,000 to 7,000 attendees rushed onto the field, causing Kravec to flee the mound and join his teammates in a barricaded clubhouse. Some climbed the foul poles, while others set records on fire or ripped up the grass. The batting cage was destroyed, and the bases were pulled up and stolen. Among those taking to the field was 21-year-old aspiring actor Michael Clarke Duncan; during the melee, Duncan slid into third base, had a silver belt buckle stolen, and went home with a bat from the dugout. As Bill Veeck stood with a microphone near where home plate had been, begging people to return to the stands, a bonfire raged in center field.

Years later, Lorelei remembered that she had been waving to the crowd when she was grabbed by two of the bodyguards who had accompanied the Jeep, who placed her back in the vehicle. The party was unable to return to home plate because of the rowdy fans, so the Jeep was driven out of the stadium and through the surrounding streets, to the delight of the many Cohos outside the stadium, who recognized the occupants. They were driven to the front of the stadium, ushered back inside, and taken up to the press room where they had spent most of the first game.

Caray unsuccessfully attempted to restore order via the public address system. The scoreboard, flashing &quot;PLEASE RETURN TO YOUR SEATS&quot;, was ignored, as was the playing of &quot;Take Me Out to the Ball Game&quot;. Some attendees danced in circles around the burning vinyl shards. Dahl offered his help to get the rowdy fans to leave, but it was declined.

At 9:08 pm, Chicago police in riot gear arrived, to the applause of the baseball fans remaining in the stands. Those on the field hastily dispersed upon seeing the police. Thirty-nine people were arrested for disorderly conduct; estimates of injuries to those at the event range from none to over thirty.

Veeck wanted the teams to play the second game once order was restored. However, the field was so badly torn up that umpiring crew chief Dave Phillips felt that it was still not playable, even after White Sox groundskeepers spent an hour clearing away debris. Tigers manager Sparky Anderson refused to allow his players to take the field in any event due to safety concerns. Phillips called American League president Lee MacPhail, who postponed the second game to Sunday after hearing a report on conditions. Anderson, however, demanded that the game be forfeited to the Tigers. He argued that under baseball&#x27;s rules, a game can only be postponed due to an act of God, and that, as the home team, the White Sox were responsible for field conditions. The next day, MacPhail forfeited the second game to the Tigers 9–0. In a ruling that largely upheld Anderson&#x27;s arguments, MacPhail stated that the White Sox had failed to provide acceptable playing conditions.

==Aftermath==

The day after the event, Dahl began his regular morning broadcast by reading the indignant headlines in the local papers. He mocked the coverage, saying: &quot;I think for the most part everything was wonderful. Some maniac Cohos got wild, went down on the field. Which you shouldn&#x27;t have done. Bad little Cohos.&quot; Tigers manager Anderson said of the events: &quot;Beer and baseball go together, they have for years. But I think those kids were doing things other than beer.&quot; Columnist David Israel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; said on July 12 that he was not surprised by the events, writing: &quot;It would have happened any place 50,000 teenagers got together on a sultry summer night with beer and reefer.&quot; White Sox pitcher Rich Wortham, a Texan, said: &quot;This wouldn&#x27;t have happened if they had country and western night.&quot;

Although Bill Veeck took much of the public criticism for the fiasco, his son Mike Veeck suffered repercussions as the front-office promoter. Mike remained with the White Sox until late 1980 when he resigned; his father sold the team to Jerry Reinsdorf soon afterward. He was unable to find another job in baseball for some time and claimed that he had been blackballed. For several years, he worked for a jai-alai fronton in Florida, battling alcoholism. As Mike said: &quot;The second that first guy shimmied down the outfield wall, I knew my life was over!&quot; Mike Veeck has since become the owner of minor league baseball teams. In July 2014, the Charleston RiverDogs, of whom Veeck is president, held a promotion involving the destruction of Justin Bieber and Miley Cyrus merchandise. Dahl is still a radio personality in Chicago and also releases podcasts.

=== Cultural significance ===
The popularity of disco declined significantly in late 1979 and 1980. Many disco artists carried on, but record companies began labeling their recordings as dance music. Dahl stated in a 2004 interview that by 1979 disco was &quot;probably on its way out. But I think Disco Demolition Night hastened its demise.&quot; According to Frank, &quot;the Disco Demolition triggered a nationwide expression of anger against disco that caused disco to recede quickly from the American cultural landscape&quot;. Episode 3 of the 2024 PBS series &quot;Disco: Soundtrack of a Revolution&quot; notes that disco&#x27;s popularity had already entered a general decline due in part to the public&#x27;s negative perception of the scene&#x27;s elitism and excesses, with many radio stations in the process of changing back from a Disco to a Rock format.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; critic Dave Marsh described Disco Demolition Night as &quot;your most paranoid fantasy about where the ethnic cleansing of the rock radio could ultimately lead&quot;. Marsh was one who, at the time, deemed the event an expression of bigotry, writing in a year-end 1979 feature that &quot;white males, eighteen to thirty-four are the most likely to see disco as the product of homosexuals, blacks, and Latins, and therefore they&#x27;re the most likely to respond to appeals to wipe out such threats to their security. It goes almost without saying that such appeals are racist and sexist, but broadcasting has never been an especially civil-libertarian medium.&quot;

Nile Rodgers, producer and guitarist for the disco-era band Chic, likened the event to Nazi book burning. Gloria Gaynor, who had a huge disco hit with &quot;I Will Survive&quot;, stated, &quot;I&#x27;ve always believed it was an economic decision—an idea created by someone whose economic bottom line was being adversely affected by the popularity of disco music. So they got a mob mentality going.&quot; Harry Wayne Casey, singer for the disco act KC and the Sunshine Band, did not believe Disco Demolition Night was discriminatory and felt that Dahl was simply an &quot;idiot&quot;.

University of East London professor Tim Lawrence wrote that the event was the culmination of the overproduction of disco, the investment by major record companies in music their heterosexual white executives did not like, and the &quot;disco sucks&quot; campaign, which he argued was homophobic, sexist and racist. Dahl denies that prejudice was his motivation for the event: &quot;The worst thing is people calling Disco Demolition homophobic or racist. It just wasn&#x27;t ... We weren&#x27;t thinking like that.&quot; In a 2014 op-ed for &quot;Crain&#x27;s Chicago Business&quot;, Dahl defended the event as &quot;a romp, not of major cultural significance&quot;. He wrote that it had been &quot;reframed&quot; as prejudiced by a 1996 VH1 documentary about the 1970s, in a move he described as &quot;a cheap shot made without exploration&quot;.

In response to Dahl&#x27;s op-ed, WMAQ-TV political journalist Mark W. Anderson, who attended Disco Demolition at the age of 15, described the fear that white neighborhoods would be taken over by blacks and the anxiety around shifting pop culture trends. He wrote: 

Historian Joshua M. Zeitz noted that the demographic group attending the riots swung wildly in the 1980 presidential primaries and election, first supporting liberal Ted Kennedy in the Democratic primary, then the conservative Republican nominee Ronald Reagan in the general election, both times opposing President Jimmy Carter. Zeitz argued: &quot;Viewed in this light, Disco Demolition Night supports an altogether different interpretation of the 1970s as a decade that saw ordinary Americans gravitate to radical grassroots alternatives, both left and right, out of frustration with the political center.&quot;

The unplayed second game remains the last American League game to be forfeited. The last National League game to be forfeited was on August 10, 1995, when a baseball giveaway promotion at Dodger Stadium went awry, forcing the Los Angeles Dodgers to concede the game to the St. Louis Cardinals. According to baseball analyst Jeremiah Graves, &quot;To this day Disco Demolition Night stands in infamy as one of the most ill-advised promotions of all time, but arguably one of the most successful as 30 years later we&#x27;re all still talking about it.&quot;

<text>Meera, better known as Mirabai, and venerated as [[Sant (religion)|Sant]] Meerabai, was a 16th-century Hindu mystic poet and devotee of Krishna. She is a celebrated Bhakti saint, particularly in the North Indian Hindu tradition. She is mentioned in &quot;Bhaktamal&quot;, confirming that she was widely known and a cherished figure in the Bhakti movement by about 1600. In her poems, she had &quot;madhurya bhava&quot; towards Krishna.

Most legends about Mirabai mention her fearless disregard for social and family conventions, her devotion to Krishna, and her persecution by her in-laws for her religious devotion. Her in-laws never liked her passion for music, through which she expressed her devotion, and they considered it an insult of the upper caste people. It is said that amongst her in-laws, her husband was the only one to love and support her in her &quot;Bhakti&quot;, while some believed him to have opposed it. She has been the subject of numerous folk tales and hagiographic legends, which are inconsistent or widely different in details. According to a legend, when her in-laws attempted to murder her with poison, Mirabai tied a thread on Krishna&#x27;s idol, trusting in his divine protection, through which she was saved by Krishna through divine intervention. This legend is sometimes cited as the origin of the ritual of tying &quot;rakhi&quot; to God&#x27;s idol.

Millions of devotional hymns in passionate praise of Krishna are attributed to Mirabai in the Indian tradition, but just a few hundred are believed to be authentic by scholars, and the earliest written records suggest that except for two hymns, most were first written down in the 18th century. Many poems attributed to Meera were likely composed later by others who admired Meera. These hymns are a type of Bhajan, and are very famous across India.

Some Hindu temples, such as Chittor Fort, are dedicated to Mirabai&#x27;s memory. Legends about Mirabai&#x27;s life, of contested authenticity, have been the subject of movies, films, comic strips and other popular literature in modern times.

==Biography==

Primary records about Meera are not available, and scholars have attempted to establish Meera&#x27;s biography from secondary literature that mentions her.

Mirabai was born into a Rathore Rajput royal family in Kudki (modern-day Beawar district of Rajasthan), and spent her childhood in Merta. She was the daughter of Ratan Singh Rathore and grand daughter of Rao Dudaji of Merta.

Meera unwillingly married Bhoj Raj, the crown prince of Mewar, in 1516. Her husband was wounded in one of the ongoing wars with the Delhi Sultanate in 1518, and he died from battle wounds in 1521. Both her father and father-in-law (Rana Sanga) died a few days after their defeat in the Battle of Khanwa against Babur, the first Mughal Emperor.

After the death of Rana Sanga, Vikram Singh became the ruler of Mewar. According to a popular legend, her in-laws tried to assassinate her multiple times. These attempts included sending Meera a glass of poison and telling her it was nectar, and sending her a basket with a snake instead of flowers. According to hagiographic legends, she was not harmed in either case, with the snake miraculously becoming, depending on the version, a Krishna idol or a garland of flowers. In another version of these legends, she is asked by Vikram Singh to drown herself. When she attempts to do so, she merely floats on the water. Yet another legend states that the third Mughal emperor, Akbar, came with Tansen to visit Meera and presented her with a pearl necklace. Scholars doubt this happened, as Tansen joined Akbar&#x27;s court in 1562, 15 years after Meera&#x27;s death. Similarly, some stories state that Ravidas was her guru (teacher), but there is no corroborating historical evidence for this.

As of 2014, the three oldest records that mention Meera are all from the 17th century and written within 150 years of Meera&#x27;s death. Neither mentions anything about her childhood, the circumstances of her marriage to Bhojraj or that the people who persecuted her were her in-laws or from some Rajput royal family. Nancy Martin-Kershaw states that to the extent that Meera was challenged and persecuted, religious or social conventions were unlikely to have been the cause, rather the likely cause was political chaos and military conflicts between the Rajput kingdom and the Mughal Empire.

Other stories state that Mira Bai left the kingdom of Mewar and went on pilgrimages. In her last years, Meera lived in Dwarka or Vrindavan, where legends state she miraculously disappeared by merging into an idol of Krishna after being poisoned by her brother-in-law in 1547. While miracles are contested by scholars for the lack of historical evidence, it is widely acknowledged that Meera dedicated her life to Krishna, composing songs of devotion, and was one of the most important poet-saints of the Bhakti movement period.

==Poetry==
A number of compositions by Meera Bai continue to be sung today in India, mostly as devotional songs (&quot;bhajans&quot;) towards Krishna, though nearly all of them have a philosophical connotation. Her poems describe her love, salutation, and separation from Krishna, and her dissatisfaction with the world. One of her most popular compositions remains &quot;Payoji maine Ram Ratan dhan payo&quot; (पायो जी मैंने राम रतन धन पायो।, &quot;I have been given the richness of God&#x27;s name blessing&quot;). Meera&#x27;s poems are lyrical &quot;padas&quot; (metric verses) in the Rajasthani language. Several meters are used within her &quot;padas&quot;, but the most common meter found is &quot;mātric&quot; (syllabic) poetic line. &quot;Rāgas&quot; or melodies are attributed to these &quot;padas&quot;, allowing them to be sung. While thousands of verses are attributed to her, scholars are divided as to how many of them were actually penned by Meera herself. There are no surviving manuscripts of her poetry from her time, and the earliest records with two poems credited to her are from the early 18th century, more than 150 years after her legendary disappearance in 1547.

===Hindi and Rajasthani===

The most extensive collection of Meera&#x27;s poems exists in manuscripts from the 19th century. To establish the authenticity of the poems, scholars have looked at various factors such as the mention of Meera in other manuscripts, as well as the style, language, and form of the poems. John Stratton Hawley cautions, &quot;When one speaks of the poetry of Mirabai, then, there is always an element of enigma. [...] There must always remain a question about whether there is any real relation between the poems we cite and a historical Mira.&quot;

In her poems, Krishna is a yogi and lover, and she herself is a yogini ready to take her place by his side in a spiritual marital bliss. Meera&#x27;s style combines impassioned mood, defiance, longing, anticipation, joy and ecstasy of union, always centred on Krishna.

Meera speaks of a personal relationship with Krishna as her lover, God and mountain lifter. The characteristic of her poetry is complete surrender.

Meera is often classed with the northern Sant bhaktis, who spoke of Krishna.

===Ravidas as Mira&#x27;s Guru===
There is a small &quot;chhatri&quot; (pavilion) in front of Meera&#x27;s temple in Chittorgarh district of Rajasthan which bears Ravidas&#x27; engraved foot print. Legends link him as the &quot;guru&quot; of Mirabai, another major Bhakti movement poet.

Queen Mira Bai composed a song dedicated to Guru Ravidas where she mentioned him as her Guru. 
&lt;poem&gt;
Sadguru sant mile Ravidas
Mira devaki kare vandana aas
Jin chetan kahya dhann Bhagavan Ravidas
&lt;/poem&gt;
-- &quot;I got a guru in the form of Sant Ravidas, there by obtaining life&#x27;s fulfillment.&quot;

===Sikh literature===

When the Adi Granth was compiled in 1604, a copy of the text was given to a Sikh named Bhai Banno who was instructed by Guru Arjan to travel to Lahore to get it bound. While doing so, he made a copy of the codex, which included compositions of Mirabai. These unauthorized additions were not included in the standardized edition of the scripture by the Sikh gurus, who rejected their inclusion.

&quot;Prem Ambodh Pothi&quot;, a text attributed to Guru Gobind Singh and completed in 1693 CE, includes poetry of Mira Bai as one of sixteen historic &quot;bhakti saints&quot; important to Sikhism.

* Mira Padavali
* Narsi ji Ka Mayara

==Influence==

Scholars acknowledge that Meera was one of the central poet-saints of the Bhakti movement, a period in Indian history rife with religious conflicts. Yet, they simultaneously question the extent to which Meera was a canonical projection of social imagination that followed, where she became a symbol of people&#x27;s suffering and a desire for an alternative. Dirk Wiemann, quoting Parita Mukta, states,


The continued influence of Meera, in part, has been her message of freedom, her resolve and right to pursue her devotion to Krishna and her spiritual beliefs as she felt drawn to despite her persecution. Her appeal and influence in Indian culture, writes Edwin Bryant, is from her emerging, through her legends and poems, as a person &quot;who stands up for what is right and suffers bitterly for holding fast to her convictions, as other men and women have&quot;, yet she does so with a language of love, with words painting the &quot;full range of emotions that mark love, whether between human beings or between human and divine&quot;.

==English translations==
English translations of Meera&#x27;s poems titled &quot;Mystic Songs of Meera&quot; and &quot;The Devotional Poems of Mirabai&quot; have been written by A.J. Alston and V.K. Subramanian respectively. Some bhajans of Meera have been rendered into English by Robert Bly and Jane Hirshfield as &quot;Mirabai: Ecstatic Poems&quot;. Schelling and Landes-Levi have offered anthologies in the USA. Snell has presented parallel translations in his collection &quot;The Hindi Classical Tradition&quot;. Sethi has selected poems which Meera composed presumably after she came in contact with Ravidas.

==Popular culture==

Composer John Harbison adapted Bly&#x27;s translations for his &quot;Mirabai Songs.&quot;

The 1997 novel &quot;Cuckold&quot;, by Kiran Nagarkar, features her as one of the central characters.

In 2002, Indian film director Anjali Panjabi released a documentary film about Meera, titled &quot;A Few Things I Know About Her&quot;.

In 2009, Meera Bai&#x27;s life was interpreted as a musical story in &quot;Meera—The Lover…&quot;, a music album based on original compositions for some well known bhajans attributed to her. James, a Bangladeshi musician, dedicated his song &quot;Mirabai&quot; to her.

The Meera Mahal in Merta is a museum dedicated to telling the story of Mirabai through sculptures, paintings, displays, and a shaded garden.

=== Film and TV adaptations ===
Two well-known films of her life have been made in India: &quot;Meera&quot; (1945), a Tamil language film starring M. S. Subbulakshmi, and &quot;Meera&quot; (1979), a Hindi film by Gulzar, in which she is portrayed by actress Hema Malini. Other Indian films about her include: &quot;Meerabai&quot; (1921) by Kanjibhai Rathod, &quot;Sant Mirabai&quot; (1929) by Dhundiraj Govind Phalke, &quot;Rajrani Meera&quot;/&quot;Meerabai&quot; (1933) by Debaki Bose, &quot;Meerabai&quot; (1936) by T.

Pawar, &quot;Meera Shyam&quot; (1976), &quot;Meera Ke Girdhar&quot; (1992) by Vijay Deep.

&quot;Mirabai,&quot; a 26-episode series based on her life, starring Mrinal Kulkarni, was produced by UTV in 1997. &quot;Meera&quot;, a 2009 Indian television series based on her life, aired on NDTV Imagine. &quot;Shree Krishna Bhakto Meera&quot;, a 2021 Indian Bengali mythological television series based on her life, aired on Star Jalsha. Her life was also chronicled in the longest running mythological show, Vighnaharta Ganesh, where Lord Ganesh narrates her story to one of Lord Shiva&#x27;s gana, Pushpadanta. Mira was portrayed by Lavina Tandon, while Krishna&#x27;s role was essayed by Hitanshu Jinsi.

<text>The Marais (Le Marais ; &quot;the marsh&quot;) is a historic district in Paris, France. It spreads across parts of the 3rd and 4th arrondissements on the Rive Droite, or Right Bank, of the Seine. Having once been an aristocratic district, it is home to many buildings of historic and architectural importance. It lost its status as a fashionable district in the late 18th century, with only minor nobles calling the area home. After the French Revolution, the district fell into disrepair and was abandoned by nobility. After a long period of decay, the district has undergone transformation in recent years and is now once again amongst the more fashionable areas of Paris, known for its art galleries, upscale restaurants and museums.

==History==
===Paris aristocratic district===
In 1240, the Knights Templar built a fortified church just outside the walls of Paris, in the northern part of the Marais. Later on, The Temple (also known as the Temple Quarter) had many religious institutions built nearby. These include: the convents des Blancs-Manteaux, de Sainte-Croix-de-la-Bretonnerie and des Carmes-Billettes, as well as the church of .

During the mid-13th century, Charles I of Anjou, King of Naples and Sicily, and brother of King Louis IX of France built his residence near the current n°7 rue de Sévigné. In 1361, King Charles V built a mansion known as the Hôtel Saint-Pol, in which the Royal Court settled during his reign (as well as his son&#x27;s).

From that time to the 17th century and especially after the Royal Square (&quot;Place Royale&quot;, current &quot;place des Vosges&quot;) was designed under King Henri IV of France in 1605, the Marais was the favoured place of residence of the French nobility. Among the many urban mansions—hôtels particuliers, in French—they built there were the Hôtel de Sens, the Hôtel de Sully, the Hôtel de Beauvais, the Hôtel Carnavalet, the Hôtel de Guénégaud and the Hôtel de Soubise.

During the late 18th century, the district was no longer considered the most fashionable district by the nobility, yet it still kept its reputation of being an aristocratic area. By that time, only minor nobles and a few higher ranking nobles, such as the Prince de Soubise, lived there. The Place des Vosges remained a place for nobles to meet. The district fell into disrepair after the French Revolution and was then abandoned by the nobility completely. It was to remain unfashionable until the late 20th century.

===Jewish community===
After the French Revolution, the district was no longer the aristocratic district it had been during the 17th and 18th centuries. Because of this, the district became a popular and active commercial area, hosting one of Paris&#x27; main Jewish communities. At the end of the 19th century and during the first half of the 20th, the district around the rue des Rosiers, referred to as the &quot;Pletzl&quot;, welcomed many Eastern European Jews (Ashkenazi) who reinforced the district&#x27;s clothing specialization. During World War II the Jewish community was targeted by the Nazis who were occupying France. As of today, the rue des Rosiers remains a major center of the Paris Jewish community, which has made a comeback since the 1990s. Public notices announce Jewish events, bookshops specialize in Jewish books, and numerous restaurants and other outlets sell kosher food.

The synagogue on 10 rue Pavée is adjacent to the rue des Rosiers. It was designed in 1913 by Art Nouveau architect Hector Guimard, who designed many Paris Metro stations. The Marais houses the Museum of Jewish Art and History, the largest French museum of Jewish art and history. The museum conveys the extensive history and culture of Jews in Europe and North Africa from the Middle Ages to the 20th century.

Cnaan Lipshiz of &quot;Times of Israel&quot; wrote that in previous eras the district was &quot;the beating heart of French Jewry&quot;.

In 1982, Palestinian extremists murdered six people and injured 22 at a Jewish restaurant in the Marais, Chez Jo Goldenberg, an attack which evidenced ties to the Abu Nidal Organization.

By 2019 much Jewish business activity left The Marais, and it had fewer Jewish residents.

===Post-war rehabilitation===
By the 1950s, the district had become a working-class area and most of its architectural masterpieces were in a state of neglect. In 1964, General de Gaulle&#x27;s Culture Minister, Andre Malraux, made the Marais the first &quot;secteur sauvegardé&quot; (literally translated as &quot;safeguarded sector&quot;). That was meant to protect and conserve places deemed to be of special cultural significance. In the following decades, the government and the city led an active restoration and Rehabilitation Policy.

The main hôtels particuliers have since been restored and turned into museums: the Hôtel Salé hosts the Picasso Museum, the Hôtel Carnavalet the Paris Historical Museum, the Hôtel Donon the Cognacq-Jay Museum, and the Hôtel de Saint-Aignan hosts the Musée d&#x27;Art et d&#x27;Histoire du Judaïsme. The site of Beaubourg, the western part of Marais, was chosen for the Centre Georges Pompidou, France&#x27;s national Museum of Modern Art, which is widely considered one of the world&#x27;s most important cultural institutions. The building was completed in 1977 with advanced modern architectural features by Renzo Piano and Richard Rogers.

===Present day===
The Marais is now one of Paris&#x27; most frequented localities for art galleries. Following its restoration, the Marais has now become a popular and culture-defining district, home to many upscale restaurants, museums, fashion houses, and galleries.

The Marais is also known for its Chinese community, which first formed during World War I. At that time, France needed workers on the home front to perform the duties previously filled by men who were now soldiers on the front lines. China sent a few thousand of its citizens, on the condition that they would not actually take part in the war. Following the 1918 Allied victory, some of them stayed in Paris, living around the current rue au Maire. Today, most work in jewellery and leather-related products. The Marais&#x27; Chinese community has mainly settled in the north of the district, particularly in the vicinity of Place de la République. Next to it, on the Rue du Temple, is the Chinese Church of Paris.

Other features of the neighborhood include the Musée Picasso, the house of Nicolas Flamel, the Musée Cognacq-Jay, and the Musée Carnavalet.

==LGBT culture==
The Marais became a center of LGBT culture, beginning in the 1980s. Florence Tamagne, author of &quot;Paris: &#x27;Resting on its Laurels&#x27;?&quot;, wrote that the Marais &quot;is less a &#x27;village&#x27; where one lives and works than an entrance to a pleasure area&quot; and that this differentiates it from Anglo-American gay villages. Tamagne added that like US gay villages, the Marais has &quot;an emphasis on &#x27;commercialism, gay pride and coming-out of the closet. &quot;Le Dépôt&quot;, one of the largest cruising bars in Europe as of 2014 (per Tamagne), is in the Marais area.

<doc id="309119" wikidata="Q27074609" url="?curid=309119" title="Great shearwater">
<text>The great shearwater (Ardenna gravis) is a large shearwater in the seabird family Procellariidae. It breeds colonially on rocky islands in the south Atlantic. Outside the breeding season it ranges widely in the Atlantic.

==Taxonomy==
The great shearwater was formally described in 1818 by the Irish naturalist Bernard O&#x27;Reilly and given the binomial name &quot;Procellaria gravis&quot;. The great shearwater is now placed in the genus &quot;Ardenna&quot; that was introduced in 1853 by Ludwig Reichenbach. The genus name &quot;Ardenna&quot; was used to refer to a seabird by Italian naturalist Ulisse Aldrovandi in 1603. The specific epithet &quot;gravis&quot; is Latin meaning &quot;heavy&quot; or &quot;weighty&quot;. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

==Description==
This shearwater is 43–51 cm (16.9–20.1 in) in length with a 105–122 cm (3.5–4.0 ft) wingspan. It is identifiable by its size, dark upper parts, and white under parts, with the exception of a brown belly patch and dark shoulder markings. It has a black cap, black bill, and a white &quot;horseshoe&quot; on the base of the tail. The stiff flight, like a large Manx shearwater, is also distinctive. The only other large shearwaters in its range are the Cory&#x27;s Shearwater and the all-dark Sooty Shearwater.

==Distribution and habitat==
The great shearwater, like the sooty shearwater, follows a circular migration route, moving north up the eastern seaboard of first South and then North America, before crossing the Atlantic in August. It can be quite common off the southwestern coasts of Great Britain and Ireland before heading back south again, this time down the eastern littoral of the Atlantic.

==Behaviour and ecology==
This bird has the typically &quot;shearing&quot; flight of the genus, dipping from side to side on stiff wings with few wingbeats, the wingtips almost touching the water. Its flight is powerful and direct, with wings held stiff and straight.

===Breeding===
This species breeds on Nightingale Island, Inaccessible Island, Tristan da Cunha, and Gough Island. It is one of only a few bird species to migrate from breeding grounds in the Southern Hemisphere to the Northern Hemisphere, the normal pattern being the other way around. This shearwater nests in large colonies, laying one white egg in a small burrow or in the open grass. These nests are visited only at night to avoid predation by large gulls.
===Food and feeding===
The great shearwater feeds on fish and squid, which it catches from the surface or by plunge-diving. It occasionally feeds on crustaceans, fish entrails and other refuse discarded by fishing vessels. It readily follows fishing boats, where it indulges in noisy squabbles. This is a gregarious species, which can be seen in large numbers from ships or appropriate headlands. They have a piercing &quot;eeyah&quot; cry usually given when resting in groups on the water.

Great shearwaters are among the seabird species with the highest incidence of plastic ingestion.

<text>Fred Thomas Saberhagen (May 18, 1930 – June 29, 2007) was an American science fiction and fantasy author most famous for his &quot;Berserker&quot; series of science fiction short stories and novels.

Saberhagen also wrote a series of vampire novels in which the famous Dracula is the main protagonist, and a series of post-apocalyptic mytho-magical novels beginning with his popular Empire of the East series and continuing through a long series of &quot;Swords&quot; and &quot;Lost Swords&quot; novels. Saberhagen died of cancer, in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

==Biography==
Saberhagen was born and raised in Chicago, Illinois. Saberhagen served as an enlisted man in the U.S. Air Force during the Korean War while he was in his early twenties. Back in civilian life, Saberhagen worked as an electronics technician for the Motorola Corporation from 1958 to 1962, when he was around 30 years old.

It was while he was working for Motorola that Saberhagen started writing fiction seriously at the age of about 30. His first sale was to &quot;Galaxy Magazine&quot;, which published his short story &quot;Volume PAA–PYX&quot; in 1961. &quot;Fortress Ship&quot;, his first &quot;Berserker&quot; short shory, was published in 1963. Then, in 1964, Saberhagen saw the publication of his first novel, &quot;The Golden People&quot;.

From 1967 to 1973, he worked as an editor for the Chemistry articles in the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; as well as writing its article on science fiction. He then quit and took up writing full-time. In 1975, he moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico.

He married fellow writer Joan Spicci in 1968. They had two sons and a daughter. On June 29, 2007, Saberhagen died of prostate cancer in Albuquerque.

In his adult years, Fred Saberhagen was a practicing Catholic; indications of his faith appear from time to time in his writing.

<doc id="309124" wikidata="Q365417" url="?curid=309124" title="Ibrahim Baré Maïnassara">
<text>General Ibrahim Baré Maïnassara (9 May 1949 – 9 April 1999) was a Nigerien military officer and diplomat who ruled Niger from 1996 until his assassination. He seized and lost power in military coups.

Baré Maïnassara, a Maouri, a subgroup of Niger&#x27;s Hausa ethnic majority, was born in Dogondoutchi in 1949 and pursued a military career. Maïnassara was named Army Chief of Staff in March 1995, under a constitution that had moved Niger from prolonged military rule in 1991. On April 9, 1999, he was assassinated in Niamey during Nigerien coup d&#x27;état.

==Seizure of power==

Parliamentary elections in January 1995 resulted in cohabitation between President Mahamane Ousmane and a parliament controlled by his opponents, led by Prime Minister Hama Amadou.

Rivalry between Ousmane and Amadou effectively paralyzed the government, and Maïnassara seized power on 27 January 1996, pointing to the difficult political situation as justification.

==Rule==
Under Maïnassara&#x27;s rule, a new constitution was approved by referendum in May 1996, and a presidential election was held on 7–8 July 1996. Maïnassara took about 52% of the vote, in an election widely viewed as fraudulent. On the second day of polling, he had the electoral commission dissolved and replaced it with another electoral commission; on the same day, he also had the four opposition candidates placed under house arrest, which lasted for two weeks. Maïnassara was sworn in on 7 August.

He imposed conservative Islamist laws that included the banning of short skirts and a crackdown on the sale of contraceptives, while also introducing economic reforms and signing an agreement with the International Monetary Fund. However, the country&#x27;s economic problems continued and its external debt rose to $1.4 billion. This led to strikes by teachers and civil servants over pay arrears and job losses and a near-mutiny by the army in February 1998 over unpaid salaries.

The National Union of Independents for Democratic Renewal (UNIRD) was established in 1996 to support Maïnassara in that year&#x27;s elections, but subsequently, the Rally for Democracy and Progress-Jama&#x27;a was established as the ruling party. With the constitution barring presidents from leading parties, Hamid Algabid became the leader of the RDP-Jama&#x27;a in August 1997.

Local elections were held in February 1999, and in early April the Supreme Court released results which showed the opposition winning more seats than Maïnassara&#x27;s supporters; the Court also canceled the results in many areas and ordered elections there to be held again. The opposition called for protests against the cancellation of results on 8 April.

==Death==

On 9 April 1999, Maïnassara was ambushed and shot to death by soldiers, reportedly members of the Presidential Guard, at the airport in the capital city of Niamey as he was going to board a helicopter. The circumstances of the killing were not clear; rumors suggested that Maïnassara was attempting to flee the country. Initially his death was officially described as an &quot;unfortunate accident&quot;, but this claim was widely considered implausible. Coup leader Daouda Malam Wanké succeeded him as head of state and initiated a political transition that ended with elections late in the year.

The constitution adopted in a July 1999 referendum provides for an amnesty for participants in both the 1996 and 1999 coups. An investigation into Maïnassara&#x27;s death had begun in June 1999, but following the amnesty, it ended in September. The RDP-Jama&#x27;a has demanded an international inquiry into his death in the years since. His widow, former first lady Clémence Aïssa Baré, and their children have campaigned for the prosecution of his killers in Niger and before the ECOWAS Court of Justice for more than 20 years.

<doc id="309134" wikidata="Q735643" url="?curid=309134" title="Aspects of Love">
<text>Aspects of Love is a musical with music and book by Andrew Lloyd Webber, and lyrics by Don Black and Charles Hart. It is based on the 1955 novel by David Garnett.

The piece focuses on the romantic entanglements of actress Rose Vibert, her admiring fan Alex Dillingham, his underage cousin Jenny, his uncle George, and George&#x27;s mistress, sculptor Giulietta Trapani, over a period of 17 years. The &quot;aspects&quot; of the title refers to the many forms that love takes in the show: love between couples, both as romantic infatuation and as married people; children and their parents; and hints of same-sex attraction (Giulietta and Rose).

Most of the musical is sung, making the show sung-through with only minor amounts of dialogue.

Lloyd Webber was introduced to &quot;Aspects of Love&quot; in 1979, when he and Tim Rice were approached to write a few songs for a proposed film version. When nothing came of it, he suggested to Trevor Nunn that they collaborate on a stage adaptation. In 1983, they presented a cabaret of numbers they had written, but it was not until five years later that they tackled the project in earnest. The musical features the song &quot;Love Changes Everything&quot;.

As with many of his shows, Lloyd Webber first presented &quot;Aspects of Love&quot; in a workshop presentation as part of his Sydmonton Festival (July 1988). The cast was led by Michael Ball as Alex, Susannah Fellows as Rose, Dinsdale Landen as George, Grania Renihan as Giulietta and Diana Morrison as Jenny.

==Productions==

=== West End (1989-1992) ===
The West End production, directed by Trevor Nunn and choreographed by Gillian Lynne, musical direction by Michael Reed, opened on April 17, 1989, at the Prince of Wales Theatre, where it ran for 1,325 performances. The original cast included Ann Crumb as Rose Vibert, Michael Ball as Alex Dillingham, Kevin Colson as George Dillingham, Kathleen Rowe McAllen as Giulietta Trapani, Diana Morrison as Jenny Dillingham and Sally Smith as The Chanteuse. Roger Moore was due to star as George in the production but left two weeks before opening night. He later stated in an interview he was unable to cope with the technical side of singing in &quot;Aspects of Love&quot;, and the production required someone with experience of singing with orchestras. Following his departure, his understudy Kevin Colson took over the role. During the run, the role of Rose Vibert was also played by Susannah Fellows, Carol Duffy, Helen Hobson, Clare Burt, and Sarah Brightman; Alex Dillingham by David Greer, David Malek and Michael Praed; Giulietta Trapani by Becky Norman and Grania Renihan.

=== Broadway (1990-1991) ===
The Broadway production, with the same creative team and the four leading members of the London cast, opened on April 8, 1990, at the Broadhurst Theatre and closed on March 2, 1991, after 377 performances and 22 previews. John Cullum joined the cast later in the run, and the closing cast starred Sarah Brightman and Barrie Ingham. The reviews were lacklustre and &quot;New York Times&quot; critic Frank Rich wrote in a negative review &quot;Whether &quot;Aspects of Love&quot; is a musical for people is another matter.&quot; When the musical closed, the entire $8 million investment was lost, which, according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, made it &quot;perhaps the greatest flop in Broadway history&quot;.

=== UK Tour and West End Revival (1993) ===
In 1993, Really Useful Group and Apollo Leisure breathed life into the show with a new production directed by Gale Edwards, with designs by Roger Kirk, and choreography by Jo Anne Robinson. The show opened at the Alexandra Theatre, Birmingham, toured the UK and then headed into the West End and re-opened at the shows original venue, the Prince of Wales Theatre, London. There were many differences from the original, especially in the stage design, which used a revolve and beautiful butterfly gauzes to help the flow from scene to scene. Kathryn Evans played Rose, with Alexander Hanson as Alex, Gary Bond as George, Lottie Mayor as Jenny and Karen Skinns as Giulietta. The cast also included Paul Bentley, Benjamin Lush, Helen Viner-Slater, Alisdair Harvey, Nicola Dawn, Martin Callaghan, Russell Wilcox, Heather Davies, Nathan Harmer, Leslie Meadows, Gail-Marie Shapter, Myles Faraday, Kate Marsden, Natalie Holton, Angela Lloyd and Peter King. A further tour of the production in 1994 was led by Kevin Colson as George, Anne Wood as Rose, Jay Marcus as Alex, Jacinta Whyte as Giulietta and Elizabeth Price as Jenny.

=== Subsequent Productions ===
In 1991, a &#x27;chamber&#x27; version of the show with Keith Michell as George was mounted in Canada. It subsequently toured in America and a similar production was staged in Australia. &quot;Aspects of Love&quot; was also produced in Japan, the Philippines, Hungary, Finland, and Denmark.

A production directed by Gale Edwards toured Australia in the early 1990s. It starred Peter Cousens as Alex, Delia Hannah as Rose, and Martin Crewes as Hugo. It also featured Kevin Colson reprising his role of George.

The musical toured the United States from 1992 to 1993. The cast starred Ron Bohmer as Alex, Linda Balgord as Rose, Keith Michell as George, and Kelli James Chase as Giulietta. Sarah Brightman reprised her performance as Rose at the Los Angeles stop at the Wilshire Theatre. 

A new UK tour – the first production in 15 years – began on 31 August 2007. It starred David Essex as George Dillingham, with Matt Rawle as Alex, Shona Lindsay as Rose, and Poppy Tierney as Giulietta. The production was directed by Nikolai Foster, with musical direction by Andrew J. Smith. It opened at the Theatre Royal, Newcastle upon Tyne, and toured for 36 weeks through 8 December 2007. Rawle was replaced by Tim Rogers.

The show played a limited engagement at The Joburg Theatre in Johannesburg, South Africa from May 22 to June 28, 2009. The touring production was re-directed by Nikolai Foster and starred Samantha Peo, Robert Finlayson, Angela Kilian and Keith Smith.

A London revival ran at the Menier Chocolate Factory from July 15 to September 11, 2010, with new direction by Trevor Nunn. The cast featured Dave Willetts as George, Rosalie Craig as Giulietta, Katherine Kingsley as Rose, and Michael Arden as Alex.

In 2012, a Dutch production toured the Netherlands, produced by Stage Entertainment.

The new &#x27;definitive&#x27; script was staged at The Playhouse, Whitley Bay from February to March 2014. Produced by Tynemouth Operatic Society, it was the first non-professional staging in the UK to use the new script and full orchestra. It was the first staging in the world of the new &#x27;definitive&#x27; version by Lord Lloyd Webber, bringing together elements of several productions to present the show as he wishes to see it staged.

In July 2018, a new revival opened at the Hope Mill Theatre, Manchester before transferring to the Southwark Playhouse London in January 2019. It featured Kelly Price as Rose, Felix Mosse as Alex, Jérôme Pradon as George, Madalena Alberto as Giulietta and Eleanor Walsh as Jenny.

=== Second West End Revival (2023) ===
A West End revival, directed by Jonathan Kent and produced by Nica Burns, opened at the Lyric Theatre, London, on May 12, 2023, for a limited run until November 11. On June 30, 2023 it was announced the production would close nearly three months earlier than originally planned, on August 19. Michael Ball, who played Alex in the original 1989 London production, starred as George, Danielle de Niese as Giulietta. Jamie Bogyo played the role of Alex. Dave Willetts was Ball’s alternate playing the role on Mondays. In this production Alex&#x27;s song &#x27;Love Changes Everything&#x27; was also sung by George, allowing Michael Ball to reprise his signature song from the original production.

==Plot==

===Act One===

At a train station in Pau, France in 1964, 34-year-old Alex Dillingham reflects on his love life over the past 17 years (&quot;Love Changes Everything&quot;). A woman (Giulietta Trapani) replies to him that &quot;it&#x27;s all in the past.&quot;

Flashing to 1947, Rose Vibert, a 25-year-old actress, complains that their production of &quot;The Master Builder&quot; is a flop. The producer, Marcel, tries to placate Rose by introducing her to a fan, 17-year-old Alex (&quot;A Small Theatre in Montpellier&quot;). Alex and Rose have a brief tryst at his uncle George&#x27;s villa in Pau (&quot;Seeing is Believing&quot;, &quot;The House in Pau&quot;). George Dillingham, in Paris with his mistress, Giulietta Trapani, an Italian sculptor, returns to his villa to see for himself what Alex and Rose are doing (&quot;An Art Exhibition in Paris&quot;, &quot;A Memory of a Happy Moment&quot;). Rose is attracted to George, who is overcome when he sees Rose dressed in a gown belonging to his beloved late wife, Delia, also an actress, and remarks how much Rose resembles Delia (&quot;In Many Rooms in the House at Pau&quot;).

He advises Alex that all good things have to end, and that his interlude with Rose will be a memory. Alex insists that his relationship with Rose is real love (&quot;On the Terrace&quot;). George leaves, and Rose leaves to rejoin Marcel. Alex realizes that Rose had never taken him seriously (&quot;At the House at Pau&quot;).

Two years later, Alex, now a soldier, visits his uncle in Paris, and is shocked to find that Rose is now George&#x27;s mistress. He accuses her of chasing his uncle&#x27;s money, but Rose protests that she really loves George. She admits that she did love Alex once, and the two, drawn to each other again, fall into bed (&quot;George&#x27;s Flat in Paris&quot;).

The next morning, an agitated Rose tells Alex to leave before George returns. Alex, enraged, pulls out his gun. Rose throws a candlestick at Alex, and the gun goes off, shooting Rose in the arm, and she faints (&quot;First Orchestral Interlude&quot;). After George arrives, he and Alex each try to convince the other that the other is the right man for Rose. George wins the debate, insisting that Alex should begin a new life with Rose, and Alex finally agrees (&quot;She&#x27;d Be Far Better Off With You&quot;). George then heads to Venice to see his former mistress, Giulietta. However, Rose orders Alex to leave, having chosen to stay with George. Alex leaves, and Rose and Marcel follow George to Venice. Rose intends to confront Giulietta and reclaim George. In Venice, Giulietta and Rose bond while discussing George&#x27;s foibles. They both express surprise that the other woman is not at all what they&#x27;d imagined. George returns and says that he has lost most of his money (&quot;Stop. Wait. Please&quot;).

Rose then asks George to marry her and he agrees. At the wedding, Giulietta shocks everyone by claiming her best man&#x27;s rights and kissing Rose on the mouth. George, however, is delighted (&quot;A Registry Office&quot;).

At &quot;A Military Camp in Malaya&quot;, Alex receives a letter from Rose telling him that she married George, and they are expecting a child.

===Act Two===

Twelve years later at a theatre in Paris, Rose has risen to stardom and has a young lover, Hugo. Marcel and the rest of the cast celebrate the latest hit (&quot;A Month in the Country&quot;) (&quot;Leading Lady&quot;), but Rose insists that she must return to the villa at Pau and to her husband George and their 12-year-old daughter, Jenny. Marcel reintroduces her to the 32-year-old Alex (&quot;At the Stage Door&quot;). Rose is delighted and insists that he come with her to Pau. At the villa, Jenny is excited by the prospect of her mother&#x27;s return. George is happy to see Alex, returning with Rose, and Jenny, who has heard much about him, meets him for the first time. Rose and George insist that Alex should stay with them (&quot;Other Pleasures&quot;). Meanwhile, in Venice, George&#x27;s former mistress, Giulietta, ponders the meaning of stable, long-lasting love versus romantic infatuation (&quot;There Is More to Love&quot;).

Two years later, Alex suggests that Jenny needs a Paris education, which upsets Rose, who suspects that her daughter has developed an unhealthy crush on Alex (&quot;The Garden at Pau (Version 2)&quot;). That evening Jenny appears wearing Delia&#x27;s gown, much as Rose did (&quot;On the Terrace (Version 2)&quot;); George happily dances with his daughter. Jenny tries to draw Alex into the dance, but Alex politely refuses (&quot;The First Man You Remember&quot;). Later, Jenny and Alex are left alone, and Jenny finally convinces Alex to give her the last dance. Rose catches Jenny clasping Alex in a very adult fashion, and Alex leaves. Jenny tells her mother that Alex is the first to make her feel like a woman. Rose confronts Alex, who admits to having feelings for Jenny, but insists that he would never harm her (&quot;The Vineyard at Pau&quot;). Later, Jenny tells Alex that she loves him. She begs him to be honest, then kisses him (&quot;Up in the Pyrenees&quot;).

George plans his wake, insisting that there should be dancing and fun. Rose tells him that he&#x27;s bound to outlive them all (&quot;George&#x27;s Study at Pau&quot;). At a circus in Paris, George, Rose, Alex, and Jenny are celebrating Jenny&#x27;s fifteenth birthday (&quot;Journey of a Lifetime&quot;). George becomes agitated as he watches Jenny talking with Alex (&quot;Falling&quot;). Later, Alex puts Jenny to bed. Jenny tries to convince him that she&#x27;s really in love with him, but Alex insists that they&#x27;re just cousins. Jenny falls asleep, and Alex reflects that he knows he must not love her, but cannot help loving her. George overhears Alex and is enraged, suspecting the worst. He collapses, and Alex comes out of Jenny&#x27;s room to find him dead (&quot;Jenny&#x27;s Bedroom&quot;).

At George&#x27;s wake, Giulietta gives a eulogy celebrating George&#x27;s unconventionality and his belief in living life to the fullest (&quot;Hand Me the Wine and Dice&quot;). Giulietta and Alex join in the dancing and are attracted to each other, eventually trysting in a hayloft. Jenny spies on them, while Marcel tries to comfort the grieving Rose. Alex, alone with Giulietta, wonders how to end his relationship kindly with Jenny. He returns to the villa for one last confrontation. Alex tries to explain to Jenny that their relationship was unnatural. She reminds him that he was only seventeen when he met Rose, and that she is no younger than Shakespeare&#x27;s Juliet (&quot;On the Terrace (Version 3)&quot;).

Rose bids Alex farewell, but then breaks down and begs Alex not to leave her. Alex, unsure of how to reply, leaves (&quot;Anything But Lonely&quot;). At the train station at Pau, as Alex and Giulietta wait for the train, Giulietta wonders what will happen when Jenny reaches legal majority in three years. Alex, unable to reply, reflects once more on how love changes everything (&quot;It Won&#x27;t be Long till Jenny&#x27;s a Woman&quot;).

Note: Although most of the musical is sung, not all the parts that are sung are titled songs; some are simply sung-through scenes with minor amounts of dialogue.

==Recording==
The two-disc original cast recording of the London production preserved the bulk of the score with some edits made for reasons of length. A 2005 remastered edition restored all the material cut from the original release.

When the musical opened, the song &quot;The First Man You Remember&quot; was often performed on TV, the impression being that it was between a couple of romantic lovers. However, in the show itself it is actually a father and daughter duet between George and Jenny. It was sung by Michael Ball and Diana Morrison in the CD single version.

The first single released from the musical was &quot;Love Changes Everything&quot;, also sung by Ball. It was a success, peaking at #2 and staying in the UK singles chart for 15 weeks, and has since become his signature song.

<text>Aspects of Love is a novel by author David Garnett centering on the loves of a young soldier named Alexis Golightly, his uncle George Dillingham, and the beautiful actress Rose Vibert from whom neither man could escape. It was originally published in 1955.

In 1989, this book served as the basis for Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s musical of the same name.

==Synopsis==
Alexis, a young Englishman recently expelled from school, enlists in the army. He falls in love with a beautiful French actress named Rose Vibert, who later abandons him to marry his uncle, an older, more learned man named Sir George Dillingham. Years later, Alexis returns to George and Rose&#x27;s lives and meets their 13-year-old daughter, Jenny. As Jenny spends more time with Alexis, she falls madly in love with him. After George dies from a heart attack, Alexis meets and falls in love with Giulietta, who was George&#x27;s lover before Rose.

<doc id="309137" wikidata="Q950119" url="?curid=309137" title="Whistle Down the Wind (1996 musical)">
<text>Whistle Down the Wind is a musical with music composed by Andrew Lloyd Webber, who also co-wrote its book with Patricia Knop and Gale Edwards, and its lyrics were written by Jim Steinman. It is based on the 1961 film &quot;Whistle Down the Wind&quot;, whose source novel was written by Mary Hayley Bell in 1958.

The musical premiered in 1996 at the National Theatre in Washington, D.C., and a concept album was released in 1998. It was produced in the West End in 1998 and has been revived several times since then and toured extensively.

==History==

===US premiere===
The show premiered at the National Theatre in Washington, D.C., on 12 December 1996, starring Davis Gaines as the Man and Irene Molloy as Swallow. It drew mostly negative reviews, and the Broadway opening that had been scheduled for 17 April 1997, was subsequently cancelled.

Lloyd Rose, the &quot;Washington Post&quot; reviewer wrote that the musical &quot;...is just dull...Steinman and Lloyd Webber&#x27;s differing styles of gothic intensity might have been expected to be mutually enhancing, but in fact they cancel each other out... Harold Prince brings all his brilliant directing skills to bear on the material, and with Binkley and set designer Andrew Jackness he produces some inventive, often startling staging.&quot; The &quot;Variety&quot; critic praised the Lloyd Webber score, writing it is &quot;a pleasing collection of numbers that range from his trademark melodies to boisterous country barn dances and rocking hymns. ...he has produced some excellent work.&quot; He further wrote that &quot;Jim Steinman’s lyrics are consistently on the money.&quot; and &quot;Director Prince keeps proceedings moving briskly and excels at easing characters into their numerous numbers.&quot;

&quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; critic wrote that the musical has ...&quot;lovely Lloyd Webber melodies and a more traditional book-musical structure than the composer&#x27;s usual sung-through fare... One change from the source material that appears to reflect director Prince&#x27;s sensibility is the aura of danger and darkness that suffuses the piece. It&#x27;s a tonal choice that not only makes the story more credible, but -- without giving away the true identity of Gaines&#x27; character -- it also suits the harsh reality that underlies the children&#x27;s leap of faith.&quot;

It got a huge amount of advance publicity, due to Steinman&#x27;s popularity as a songwriter and the unusual pairing of Steinman and Lloyd Webber.

===West End premiere===
A reworked, and more successful, production opened in the West End at the Aldwych Theatre on 1 July 1998, starring Marcus Lovett as The Man and Lottie Mayor as Swallow. It ran for 1,044 performances and closed in January 2001. This production was darker than the Washington, D.C., production and was revised and directed by Gale Edwards, who had previously collaborated with Lloyd Webber on an updated production of &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar.&quot;

The original West End cast included:
The role of The Man was later played by Jérôme Pradon and Glenn Carter, and Swallow was played by Laura Michelle Kelly. The children&#x27;s cast included Jessica Cornish (now known as Jessie J), Anne-Marie, Hannah Tointon, James Buckley, Hannah Cooper, Matthew Thomas, Jade Ewen, Jay Asforis, Sam Gillam and Cassie Compton.

===Subsequent productions===
In 2001, Bill Kenwright produced and directed his own production of &quot;Whistle Down the Wind&quot; for a UK tour, starring Tim Rogers as The Man and Katie Rowley Jones as Swallow. He was granted a considerable amount of creative freedom as director, authorised by Andrew Lloyd Webber to make significant changes to the dramatic structure of the musical, including replacing the running parable of Annie and Charlie Christmas told to the children by The Man with a lighter-toned number called &quot;The Gang&quot; (lyrics by Don Black). This version was simpler in design and more focused on the human story than the spectacular visuals of the Aldwych production. The show toured the UK a number of times between 2001 and 2004.

At the request of Lloyd Webber, Kenwright brought this production to the Palace Theatre, London in March 2006, where it played a limited run until August, filling the gap between the closure of another Lloyd Webber musical, &quot;The Woman in White&quot; and the opening of the Monty Python musical &quot;Spamalot.&quot; Tim Rogers reprised his acclaimed performance of The Man, and Claire Marlowe, another veteran of the UK tour, reprised the role of Swallow. The critical opinion was mixed, ranging from Michael Billington&#x27;s 2 star review in &quot;The Guardian&quot; to Benedict Nightingale&#x27;s 4 star review in &quot;The Times&quot;, but virtually all of the national papers agreed that this version was an improvement on Gale Edwards&#x27;s Aldwych production.

A US tour began in Houston in September 2007, and ended in February 2008 in Norfolk, Virginia. The production was again directed and produced by Bill Kenwright, who had expressed his intention to take the show to Broadway. It starred Eric Kunze as The Man and Andrea Ross as Swallow. In each city, local children were added to the cast. Planned Los Angeles and San Francisco dates were cancelled.

Kenwright presented a second UK tour in 2010, opening at the Liverpool Empire on 20 January and moving onto venues including Bristol and Edinburgh. Jonathan Ansell played The Man, and Carly Bawden was Swallow.

2022 saw a small revival of the show, at the Watermill Theatre in Newbury, England. It was directed by Tom Jackson Greaves, and featured a cast of 12 actor-musicians, starring Lydia White as Swallow, and Robert Tripolino as The Man. The show had a strictly limited run, from July 2022 through to Sept 2022. It was reviewed favourably by &quot;The Guardian&quot;, receiving 5 stars out of 5. It was also nominated for &quot;Best Musical Production&quot; in the 2022 UK Theatre Awards.

==Synopsis==

Act 1

In a small church in Louisiana the congregation is about to sing a song, &quot;Vaults of Heaven&quot;. After the song, the preacher concludes his sermon, and the congregation go their separate ways (Overture). Poor Baby complains that &quot;I Never Get What I Pray For&quot;, before Poor Baby, Swallow and Brat meet Ed, who is about to drown some kittens. Swallow manages to save them and the kids realise that they should have been &quot;Home By Now.&quot; Earl is looking for a place to put up a tent for a revival meeting, where &quot;folks go to dance with snakes&quot; in order to test their faith in Jesus. Back at their home, their father Boone tries to convince them that &quot;It Just Doesn&#x27;t Get Any Better Than This,&quot; before recalling what his wife used to say: &quot;Whistle Down The Wind.&quot; As Poor Baby puts it, &#x27;Ma sang it better,&#x27; and Swallow leaves to go feed the kittens, while singing &quot;Whistle Down The Wind&quot; to herself. In the barn, she prays that God will look after the kittens, but is startled by a loud cry, and a man jumps out at her. When she asks who he is, he only manages to moan &quot;Jesus Christ..&quot; before he collapses. She, Brat and Poor Baby promise they won&#x27;t tell anyone that he is there: &quot;The Vow.&quot;

In a bar where Ed is singing &quot;Cold&quot; to entertain the townspeople. The Sheriff arrives at the bar to warn the town that there is an escaped killer on the loose, and that he could be hiding out nearby. In the barn, The Man (Arthur Blakey in the source novel, unnamed in the play) wakes to find himself surrounded by children, who all promise to take care of him and to keep his existence a secret. Left alone, he sings of &quot;Unsettled Scores.&quot; Later that night, Swallow brings him some food, and asks him if he will bring her mother back: &quot;Being the Son of God, it can&#x27;t be that difficult for you!&quot; She sings &quot;If Only,&quot; thinking of the way she wishes things could be.

Candy, a young black girl, and Amos, a white boy, sing of longing to get away from the town they live in, to a place they can be free: &quot;Tire Tracks and Broken Hearts.&quot; The townspeople sing of how the town used to be, and what it must be again: &quot;Safe Haven.&quot;

The children are discussing what it would mean if the mysterious man really was Jesus Christ, and what a difference it would make to their lives: &quot;Long Overdue for a Miracle.&quot; They realise that if they do everything right, they could save him, and that this could be the night &quot;When Children Rule The World.&quot; In the barn, they beg The Man to tell them a story, and he complies, telling them a story which he says will be in the next Testament, &quot;Annie Christmas&quot;. When he finishes, they ask repeatedly what the moral is, and when he admits that he doesn&#x27;t know, they offer him gifts and promise that &quot;No Matter What,&quot; they&#x27;ll always love him. The adults prepare to hunt down the escaped killer, their anger in complete contrast to the children&#x27;s innocence and happiness.

Act 2

The townspeople are again preparing to hunt down the killer (Safe Haven Reprise). The Man asks Swallow to retrieve a package for him, 4 miles away at the train tunnel, and on noticing that she is shaking, tells her to &quot;Try Not To Be Afraid.&quot; Amos arrives at the barn to visit Swallow before he leaves town with Candy, and asks if she will tell him her big secret before he goes. He says if they share secrets, they&#x27;ll have to seal them with a kiss, and that &quot;A Kiss Is A Terrible Thing To Waste.&quot; The Man, hiding in the barn, overhears their conversations and joins in as Amos sings the song, realising that they seem to correspond to his life- &quot;The emptiest words that there&#x27;ll ever be, it could have been me- it could have been me.&quot; Swallow asks Amos to take her to the train tunnel before he can kiss her. There, she retrieves the package, but is almost killed by a train, though Amos manages to push her out of the way in time. &quot;You saved my life, Amos! That means I owe you one now!&quot; she says, then she tells him her secret: &quot;What would you say if I told you Jesus had come back? He&#x27;s back, Amos! Jesus is in my barn!&quot; They are interrupted by the Sheriff, who thinks he has discovered the killer, and is rather disappointed to find it is only Swallow and Amos. Earl has been hiding in the train tunnel the whole time and has overheard Swallow&#x27;s secret. At home, Swallow finds Poor Baby, who is upset because his kitten, which he asked &quot;Jesus&quot; to look after, has died; Swallow suggests they ask &quot;Jesus&quot; why he allowed the kitten to die: &quot;If Only (Reprise).&quot; In the barn, The Man tells them another story to explain why the kitten died: &quot;Charlie Christmas,&quot; saying that everyone dies in the end, &quot;even the cat, even old Charlie...even your mother.&quot;

On the highway, Candy waits for Amos: &quot;Off Ramp Exit To Paradise,&quot; but when he eventually turns up, its only to ask her where Swallow is, as he says she&#x27;s in trouble. When he runs off, Candy meets Earl, who says he knows Swallow&#x27;s big secret, and knows why Amos is rushing off in such a hurry. When he tells Candy, she decides to get back at Amos and Swallow by telling the whole town Swallow&#x27;s secret, interrupting the revival meeting: &quot;Wrestle with the Devil.&quot; The townspeople decide that the killer has to be found once and for all, in order to save the children: &quot;The Hunt.&quot;

Swallow runs back to the barn to warn The Man that the whole town is heading for the barn to catch him- when he says he will have to try and run for it, she begs him to stay, promising that she will protect him. He tries to make her realize that he is not the person she thinks he is: &quot;Nature of the Beast.&quot; But she says that she realizes that now, and simply needs him to be whoever he is. When the townspeople get to the barn, they find it surrounded by the kids who are determined not to let them hurt The Man. Swallow is trapped in the barn with him, and he says he will take her hostage, but quickly changes his mind and instead pushes her out of the barn to safety. Left alone, he sets fire to the barn, so that when Swallow manages to get back in, there&#x27;s no trace of him left. Swallow is convinced he hasn&#x27;t left for good, saying, &quot;He&#x27;ll be back...I just know he will.&quot; Her father tries to make her see that he wasn&#x27;t Jesus. She still isn&#x27;t completely convinced, asking, &quot;But how do you know?&quot; The family, together again, sing &quot;Whistle Down The Wind.&quot;

===Concept album===

A concept album, Songs from Whistle Down the Wind, was released in 1998 in advance of the show&#x27;s West End premiere. It features 12 of the songs from the show performed by various popular recording artists and West End theatre stars who have collaborated with Lloyd Webber and Steinman over the years. Lottie Mayor, who had been cast as Swallow in the West End production, appears on the album accompanied by Lloyd Webber. Steinman and Lloyd Webber were executive producers.

====Track listing====
&quot;No Matter What&quot; was released as a single and had unprecedented success: it went platinum, was voted the UK&#x27;s Record of the Year for 1998, and hit No. 1 in the United Kingdom. It was included in the film &quot;Notting Hill&quot; and would later be covered by Meat Loaf as a medley with another piece from the musical, &quot;Home by Now&quot; in his compilation album &quot;The Very Best of Meat Loaf&quot;.

Tina Arena&#x27;s recording of the title song peaked at #24 on the UK Singles Chart on 27 June.

&quot;When Children Rule the World&quot; was previously recorded in 1996 by the Red Hill Children for &quot;Children in Need&quot;. It was released as a single in the United Kingdom, peaking at number 40. A medley of &quot;Whistle Down the Wind&quot; and &quot;When Children Rule the World&quot; was performed by Ryoko Moriyama during the opening ceremony of the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan, with new Japanese lyrics by Keita Asari.

<doc id="309138" wikidata="Q2123438" url="?curid=309138" title="Sans Pareil">
<text>Sans Pareil is a steam locomotive built by Timothy Hackworth which took part in the 1829 Rainhill Trials on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, held to select a builder of locomotives. The name is French and means &#x27;peerless&#x27; or &#x27;without equal&#x27;.

==Design==
While a capable locomotive for the day, its technology was somewhat antiquated compared to George and Robert Stephenson&#x27;s &quot;Rocket&quot;, the winner of the Rainhill Trials and the £500 prize money. Instead of the fire tube boiler of &quot;Rocket&quot;, &quot;Sans Pareil&quot; had a double return flue. To increase the heating surface area, the two flues were joined by a U-shaped tube at the forward end of the boiler; the firebox and chimney were both positioned at the same end, one on either side.

&quot;Sans Pareil&quot; had two cylinders, mounted vertically at the opposite end to the chimney, and driving one pair of driving wheels directly - the other pair were driven via connecting rods, in the typical steam locomotive fashion.

==Railhill Trials==
At the Rainhill Trials, &quot;Sans Pareil&quot; was excluded from the prize because it was slightly over the maximum permitted weight. Nevertheless it performed very well, but had a strange rolling gait due to its vertical cylinders and the draft from the blastpipe was, in Hackworth&#x27;s trademark style, very strong, so most of the coke was expelled out of the chimney unburnt. It was this more than its antiquated design that caused its poor fuel economy. It was pulled out of the competition because of a cracked cylinder: the design thickness for the cylinder walls was some , but at the point of failure, it was found to be a mere . 

The manufacture of the cylinders had been contracted out to Robert Stephenson &amp; Co., who were accused by Hackworth&#x27;s supporters of sabotage, but as he had had over twenty cylinders cast and chose the best two for the locomotive, foul play on the part of the Stephensons was unlikely. After the trials, the Liverpool and Manchester Railway bought &quot;Sans Pareil&quot; as well as &quot;Rocket&quot;. It was subsequently leased to the Bolton and Leigh Railway where it ran until 1844. It was then used by John Hargreaves as a stationary boiler at the Coppull Colliery, Chorley until 1863. Thereafter, &quot;Sans Pareil&quot; was restored and presented to the Patent Office Museum (which later became the Science Museum) in 1864 by John Hick. The engine now resides at the Shildon Locomotion Museum on static display.

==Replica==
A replica locomotive, built in 1980, is now preserved by the National Railway Museum at its new Shildon Locomotion Museum annex, which is also home to what remains of the original locomotive.

==Models==
In the late 1970’s, the company L-S LOC AG in Basel (Switzerland) built several live steam models, also the &quot;Sans Pareil&quot; in several batches of 500 pieces. The &quot;Stephenson’s Rocket&quot; followed, the &quot;Crampton locomotive&quot; was the last model produced in the early 1980’s. In order to have a consistent appearance, all visible surfaces of all models were gold plated.

==Other locomotives==
LMS Royal Scot Class 4-6-0 locomotive 6126 was originally named &quot;Sans Pareil&quot;. This loco was built by the North British Locomotive Company at Glasgow in September 1927 and withdrawn in October 1963 as 46126 &quot;Royal Army Service Corps&quot;. An AL6 electric locomotive built at Doncaster Works in 1965, number E3106 (later numbered 86214) carried the name &#x27;Sans Pareil&#x27; between 1981 and 2005. 86214 was scrapped in 2006.

<text>Irakli Tsereteli ( – 20 May 1959) was a Georgian politician and a leading spokesman of the Social Democratic Party of Georgia and later Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP) during the era of the Russian Revolutions.

Tsereteli was born and raised in Georgia when it was part of the Russian Empire. A member of the Menshevik faction of the RSDLP, Tsereteli was elected to the Duma in 1907, where he gained fame for his oratorical skill. Shortly after entering the Duma, Tsereteli was arrested and charged with conspiracy to overthrow the Tsarist government, and exiled to Siberia. A dedicated Social Democrat who believed in the Menshevik ideology, Tsereteli was one of the leading figures of the movement in Russia. In 1915, during his Siberian exile, Tsereteli formed what would become known as Siberian Zimmerwaldism, which advocated for the role of the Second International in ending the war. He also developed the idea of &quot;Revolutionary Defensism&quot;, the concept of a defensive war which only allowed for the defence of territory, and argued it was not being utilized.

Returning to the government in the aftermath of the 1917 February Revolution, he took up a leading position in the Petrograd Soviet and accepted a position in the Russian Provisional Government as Minister of Post and Telegraph, and briefly as Minister of the Interior. Concerned that political fragmentation would lead to a civil war in Russia, Tsereteli strived to broker compromises between the various leftist factions in the Russian Revolution and was the force behind efforts to work together with the middle classes, to no avail. Renowned for his speaking ability, Tsereteli gained appreciation for his ability in this regard, giving impassioned speeches in the Duma and in the Petrograd Soviet.

After the Bolsheviks seized power of the Russian government during the October Revolution, Tsereteli returned to Georgia. He worked as a diplomat at the Paris Peace Conference, where he lobbied for international recognition and assistance for the newly independent Democratic Republic of Georgia; meaningful assistance largely failed to materialize before the Bolshevik-led Red Army invaded in 1921. An avowed internationalist, Tsereteli grew increasingly distant from the Georgian Mensheviks who gradually adopted more nationalist tendencies. He spent the rest of his life in exile, mainly in France, working with socialist organisations and writing on socialism, and died in New York City in 1959.

==Early life==
===Early years and education===
Tsereteli was born on in Gorisa, Kutais Governorate, in the Russian Empire (now in Imereti, Georgia), to a Georgian Orthodox Christian family, the third child of Giorgi Tsereteli, a radical writer from the noble Tsereteli family, and Olympiada Nikoladze, the sister of the journalist Niko Nikoladze. Tsereteli had one sister, Eliko (1877–1950) and brother, Levan (1879–1918). Both Giorgi and Niko were members of the &quot;meore dasi&quot; (&quot;მეორე დასი&quot;; Georgian for &quot;second group&quot;), a group of Georgian populists and socialists, and they greatly influenced Irakli&#x27;s outlook. Tsereteli grew up in nearby Kutaisi and spent the summers at his family&#x27;s estate in Gorisa; from a young age he noticed the inequality between his family and their servants and the local peasants, and desired to fix the imbalance.

When he was three, Tsereteli&#x27;s mother died, so he and his siblings were sent to live with two aunts in Kutaisi, while Giorgi moved to Tiflis (now Tbilisi), the administrative centre of the Caucasus, occasionally visiting the children. Tsereteli would later move to Tiflis and attend a gymnasium. While there, he lived with his father who had since married Anastasia Tumanova, an ethnic Armenian. Tsereteli&#x27;s biographer W.H. Roobol suggests that due to Tsereteli&#x27;s reserve towards Tumanova, Giorgi&#x27;s influence over his son declined: &quot;In any event, Giorgi Tsereteli was unable to imbue his son Irakli with his patriotic ideals.&quot; Nikoladze&#x27;s views, which were more cautious against Georgian nationalism, also likely played a part in Tsereteli&#x27;s shifting ideals. At the gymnasium Tsereteli distanced himself from Christianity, questioning death and its meaning, and was introduced to the writings of the British naturalist and biologist Charles Darwin, which also factored into his move away from religion. He completed his schooling in 1900, the same year as his father&#x27;s death, and moved to Moscow to study law.

===Entry into politics and arrests===
Soon after arriving in Moscow, Tsereteli became embroiled in the student protests that broke out that year; how involved he initially was is unclear, with the only certainty being he was not yet a Marxist. It was during these protests that Tsereteli first gained fame as a speaker, and he eventually became a leading figure in the student movement. He was arrested in the spring of 1901 and after a brief detention was allowed to return to Georgia. Though he had been arrested, he was allowed to return to Moscow in the autumn of 1901 to write his exams. There had been relative quiet in the universities until that point, but it again erupted into protests; this time Tsereteli took a leading role, and was regarded as one of the most important figures of the Moscow student movement.

At a meeting of student protesters on 9 February 1902 Tsereteli was arrested; considered one of the most radical leaders, he was one of two students given a sentence of five years&#x27; exile in Siberia, the longest sentence given to the protesting students. Though the government quickly backtracked and offered him the chance to serve it in Georgia, Tsereteli refused, seeing it as a pardon and considering &quot;its acceptance as being in conflict with [his] views&quot;, as he explained in a letter. This refusal, which was publicised with other exiles, cited social democracy as advocated by the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP), and effectively confirmed Tsereteli&#x27;s support for the ideology by this point. After declining the offer to return to Georgia, Tsereteli arrived in the village of Tulun in early 1902, located about from Irkutsk, Siberia&#x27;s administrative centre. However, by late summer he was permitted to move to Irkutsk. It was during this exile that Tsereteli became familiar with the Russian Social Democrats, particularly Marxism; Tsereteli read Vladimir Lenin&#x27;s &quot;What Is To Be Done?&quot;, though he disliked the view Lenin espoused. Indeed, the RSDLP would split into two main factions in 1903 over factional differences.

On his release from exile Tsereteli returned to Georgia and aligned himself with the RSDLP&#x27;s Georgian branch, later known as the Georgian Mensheviks, the minority faction within the party. He also began working as an editor for his father&#x27;s former publication, &quot;Kvali&quot; (&quot;კვალი&quot;; &quot;Trace&quot;), writing most of their leading articles. However, in January 1904 he was again arrested, and spent two months in the Metekhi prison in Tiflis. Two months later &quot;Kvali&quot; was banned. Tsereteli was allowed to leave Georgia, likely due to the influence of his uncle, and he moved to Berlin to resume his law studies, spending 18 months in Europe. Suffering from a form of haemophilia, Tsereteli became seriously ill in the autumn of 1905, but was unable to quickly return home for rest as the 1905 Revolution broke out in the Russian Empire. It was only in May 1906 that he returned to Georgia.

===Second Duma===

Tsereteli remained in Georgia throughout the summer of 1906 recovering from his illness, and was not politically active. Even so, he was invited to stand as the Social Democratic candidate for the Russian legislative elections in January 1907, representing the Kutais Governorate, his home region. He was encouraged to do so by a fellow Georgian Menshevik, Noe Zhordania, with whom Tsereteli later became a political opponent, disagreeing on nearly every topic. Zhordania would later recall in his memoirs &quot;that this was the only time that Irakli ever listened to me.&quot; All seven seats in Georgia were won by the Social Democrats.

Despite being the youngest member of the Imperial Duma—at 25, the minimum age required for membership—Tsereteli took a leading role. He immediately gained recognition as a great orator. In particular he was noted for three speeches in which he outlined the Social Democrats&#x27; views and heavily criticised the government. The first speech, which opened with him stating that the &quot;government has fettered the nation in the chains of a state emergency, which imprisons its best sons, reduces the people to beggary and fritters away the pennies collected for the hungry and destitute. Today, there spoke to us the old feudal Russia, personified by the government.&quot; It went on to call for the opposition not to work with the government regarding the agrarian reforms of Prime Minister Pyotr Stolypin, stopping just short of calling for an armed insurrection.

The speech gained Tsereteli immediate respect among his peers. He strived to unite the opposition parties, though he faced considerable opposition both from the Kadets, a liberal group who had previously opposed the government but were now more amicable to them, and the Bolsheviks, the larger faction within the RSDLP, who worked to discredit the Mensheviks in the Duma. He sought out an alliance with the other leftist factions, namely the Socialist Revolutionary Party and the Trudoviks, a splinter group from the Socialist Revolutionaries. Stolypin grew increasingly tired of the opposition from the Social Democrats, and feared that his reforms would not be passed.

==Arrest and Siberian exile==
===Arrest===

The Duma was dissolved on 2 June 1907 and shortly after midnight on 3 June the government arrested several of the Social Democrats, including Tsereteli. They were charged with trying to overthrow the government; this was a fabrication of the government that allowed Stolypin to have them expelled from the Duma, leaving it free to implement his policies. Tsereteli was convicted in November, and sentenced to five years&#x27; hard labour, though on account of his poor health it was commuted to time in prison. The first year of his prison term was spent in St. Petersburg, and in the winter of 1908–1909 Tsereteli was moved to Nikolayev in southern Ukraine; after four years in Nikolayev he was again moved, sent to the Alexandrovsky Central Prison in Irkutsk. In the autumn of 1913 Tsereteli was permitted to move to Usolye, a village about from Irkutsk and easily accessible owing to its location on a branch line of the Trans-Siberian Railway.

Tsereteli would later reflect fondly on this period of exile: there were several other exiles in the region, and in the summers they would meet in Usolye, which had a favourable climate. On occasion Tsereteli was also able to visit Irkutsk, engaging in political talks. Both Bolsheviks and Mensheviks were involved in these discussions, and engaged with each other cordially, leading Tsereteli to believe the two factions could eventually reunite. This was in stark contrast to the situation outside Siberia, where the two factions had been increasingly distancing themselves.

===Siberian Zimmerwaldism===

The outbreak of the First World War in August 1914 was not of much interest to Tsereteli initially. However, much like the rest of the population in the region he regularly read updates in the newspapers, and tried to ascertain what type of opposition to the war was occurring internationally; though most mentions of opposition movements was censored, Tsereteli concluded that something had to exist, and felt that the Second International, a Paris-based organization of socialist and labour parties, could play some role in ending the war. Tsereteli also engaged in discussion with other Social Democrats in the Irkutsk region on his views towards the war; they would all publish their thoughts in journals, Tsereteli including his ideas in a journal that he edited, &quot;Siberian Journal&quot; (&quot;Сибирский Журнал&quot;, in Russian), later replaced by the &quot;Siberian Review&quot; (&quot;Сибирское Обозрение&quot;). This group would later be referred to as the Siberian Zimmerwaldists, a reference to the 1915 Zimmerwald Conference of international socialist groups.

At its root, Siberian Zimmerwaldism was based on the ideals of a branch of socialists who were opposed to the war and wanted to restore the Second International. The Second International had fractured upon the outbreak of the war as the various socialist groups differed on policy towards the war: many had abandoned the International in favour of defence of their countries (the so-called &quot;Defensists&quot;), while the &quot;Minority&quot; was split between the extreme left (led by Lenin), which advocated for class warfare, and the more mainstream view that sought to use the International; as such they were known as the &quot;Internationalists&quot;. It was this latter group that the Siberian Zimmerwaldists were related to. Through his editorship of the journals, Tsereteli both became a mentor to other Siberian Zimmerwaldists and influenced the group&#x27;s stance on the war despite writing just three articles, making it difficult to fully understand his position.

The first of Tsereteli&#x27;s wartime articles, titled &quot;The International and the War&quot; (&quot;Интернационал и Война&quot;) looked at how the differing socialist groups reacted to the war. He agreed with the majority Internationalist view, which had stated that the war was not totally inevitable, and that the International had thus been trying to limit the threat of war. He further argued that the International was not strong enough to call a general strike, as the proletariat was too weak to overthrow capitalism, and it would only hurt the movement. Tsereteli also criticised the Defensists, stating that while there could be such a thing as a just defence, &quot;not one of the warring powers except Belgium [was] conducting a defensive war.&quot; That socialist leaders in Germany, France, and the United Kingdom had supported their respective governments in the war effort was also unacceptable to Tsereteli, though he explained that it &quot;could not distort the historical path of the proletariat&quot;.

The second article Tsereteli wrote, &quot;Democracy in Russia at War&quot; (&quot;Демократия среди воюющей России&quot;) was largely a response to the leading Russian &quot;Defensists&quot;, namely Georgi Plekhanov and Alexander Potresov, and refuted their argument. He stated that all of the warring states were guilty and none could be victorious. His third article, &quot;For Two Years&quot; (&quot;За два года&quot;), looked at how the war had evolved, and how bourgeois nationalism had encompassed the conflict. He called the conflict an &quot;imperialist struggle over spheres of influence&quot;, largely conforming to the view of the International, though also stating his support for the idea of self-defence. Publication of more articles was halted by the authorities, but the articles Tsereteli did write had a considerable impact, and helped keep him relevant even while in exile.

==February Revolution and aftermath==
===Petrograd Soviet===

News of the February Revolution, the mass protests that led to the overthrow of the Tsar and ended the Russian Empire, began on 23 February 1917; news of it first arrived in Irkutsk on 2 March and reached Usolye that evening; Tsereteli left for Irkutsk the following morning. Several people, including Tsereteli, arrested the regional governor and declared Irkutsk a free city. A committee consisting of important social groups was formed to run the city, while a soviet (council) of soldiers was simultaneously created. Tsereteli took a leading role in this committee, though the work took a considerable toll on his health and after ten days he stepped down as he began to vomit blood. His family and friends suggested he return to Georgia, though Tsereteli instead decided to travel to Petrograd (the name St. Petersburg had adopted at the start of the war), arriving there on 19 or 20 March.

Tsereteli was the first of the major exiled politicians to arrive in Petrograd after the revolution, and thus was welcomed by a large crowd at the train station. Immediately, Tsereteli went to the Petrograd Soviet and gave a speech in support of the revolution, but warned members that it was too early to implement socialist policies. At the time of his arrival, there was no clear leadership of the country, with both the Petrograd Soviet and the Provisional Government claiming authority. The Soviet, composed of representatives of workers and soldiers, enjoyed popular support, though it was not regarded as a government. In contrast, the Provisional Government claimed it was the legitimate governmental successor to the Russian Empire, but did not have the support of the people. Each thus needed the other to legitimize their claim. This system, later dubbed &quot;dual power&quot;, was highly inefficient, though neither side wanted to upset the balance lest they lose their power.

Due to his former membership in the Duma, Tsereteli was appointed to the Soviet on 21 March in an advisory role. At his first meeting he argued that Russia should strive to defend itself, calling defence &quot;one of the fundamentals of the revolution&quot;. He stated that both the country and the revolution had to be defended from the German Empire, but also that the Soviet should pressure the Provisional Government to negotiate a peace, one that recognized self-determination and did not include annexation. This policy would soon be given the name &quot;Revolutionary Defensism&quot;. Tsereteli led the Soviet side in negotiations with the Provisional Government to have the no-annexation policy adopted, in the process showing that he had effectively become a leader within the Soviet. Tsereteli was not seeking an increased role for himself, nor did he want the Soviet to become a power-base, but simply a representative body of the workers and soldiers.

===Minister in the Provisional Government===
The April Crisis – a series of demonstrations against Russia&#x27;s continued participation in the war and a note to the Allied powers affirming that Russia was still interested in annexing Constantinople – nearly led to the downfall of the Provisional Government, and it survived mainly due to negotiations with the Soviet to form a coalition. The coalition was unpopular among many of the Mensheviks, Tsereteli included, but they realized that without the support of the Soviet the Provisional Government was unlikely to survive another threat like the April Crisis, thereby ending the Revolution, so they supported it. Though the socialists could have dominated the newly formed cabinet, Tsereteli cautioned that this would only hurt their cause, so they only took six of the fifteen cabinet posts.

Tsereteli was given the position of Minister of Post and Telegraph, an office created just so he could be in the cabinet. Reluctant to join the government, Tsereteli only did so in hopes of avoiding the dissolution of the Provisional Government and the outbreak of civil war. He did little in his role as minister, which he held until August 1917, and kept his focus on the Soviet, leaving the actual administration to others. In his memoirs, Tsereteli never mentioned his time as minister, and the only notable action he took in the position was an attempt to increase the pay of post office employees. Even so, Tsereteli&#x27;s position in the cabinet was aimed at allowing him to serve as a liaison between the Provisional Government and Soviet. He also realized that, as a member of the cabinet, he could &quot;exercise real influence upon the government, since the government and the middle classes which back it are greatly impressed by the power of the Soviet&quot;. Despite his relatively unimportant ministerial post, Tsereteli was regarded as a major figure by his peers: Viktor Chernov called him the &quot;Minister of General Affairs&quot;, while Nikolai Sukhanov referred to him as the &quot;Commissar of the Government in the Soviet&quot;. Highly valued by the Prime Minister, Georgy Lvov, Tsereteli was part of the &quot;inner cabinet&quot; that held the real power in the Provisional Government. He would later express support for the cabinet, as long as it benefited the Revolution.
Lvov resigned as prime minister on 2 July 1917, after disagreements within the cabinet regarding the status of the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic, which was in control of Ukraine. Tsereteli had travelled to Kiev with a party representing the Provisional Government to negotiate a means to ensure defence of Russia while respecting Ukrainian self-determination. The outcome saw the Ukrainians allow the Russians to continue to defend their territory, while granting increased autonomy, a move opposed by many in the cabinet. This came at the same time as the July Days, a major demonstration that broke out in Petrograd, and threatened the Provisional Government. The Provisional Government was able to withstand the threat, and Alexander Kerensky took over as prime minister. Though Tsereteli opposed Kerensky, seeing him as the force behind Lvov&#x27;s resignation, he had little option but to consent to the move.

Tsereteli was appointed Minister of the Interior, serving for two weeks until a new cabinet could be formed. Despite his senior ranking in the Soviet, Tsereteli was passed over for the post of prime minister, ostensibly because of his position; the coalition wanted reform and felt that influence from the Soviet would prevent that. However, with Kerensky frequently absent, Tsereteli served as the &quot;de facto&quot; Prime Minister, and tried to implement some domestic reforms and restore order throughout the country. Upon his return, Kerenskey was given a mandate to form a new cabinet, though Tsereteli declined a position in it, wanting instead to focus his efforts in the Soviet. He used his influence to force Kerensky to release Leon Trotsky, imprisoned in the aftermath of the July Days; Tsereteli needed Trotsky and the Bolsheviks to support the socialist movement in the Soviet against the Kadets. This had the opposite effect, as Trotsky quickly proceeded to orchestrate a Bolshevik takeover of the Soviet, expelling Tsereteli.

===October Revolution===
Removed from his post in the Soviet and suffering from tuberculosis, Tsereteli decided to move into semi-retirement. At the end of September 1917, he returned to Georgia, his first visit there in ten years. Roobol believed that Tsereteli only left because he was confident that the new Kerensky government was secure enough to last until the Constituent Assembly could meet. Though the Bolsheviks now had control of the Soviet, Tseretli was dismissive of them as a threat to the Provisional Government; while he expected them to try and seize power, he expected them to only last &quot;two or three weeks&quot;.

Tsereteli stayed in Georgia for about a month, returning to Petrograd after the Bolsheviks seized control in the October Revolution. Seen as a threat due to his position as a leading Menshevik and a delegate for the upcoming Constituent Assembly, Tsereteli had a warrant for his arrest issued on 17 December. He defied the authorities and stayed in Petrograd for the only meeting of the Constituent Assembly, which took place on 5 January 1918. Speaking to the body, he attacked the Bolsheviks, accusing them of failing to do anything constructive, and stifling any criticism against their policies. The assembly was dissolved by the Bolshevik regime after its lone meeting. Now fearing arrest, Tserteli returned to Georgia, which had broken away from Russian control during the Revolutions.

==Return to Georgia==
===Georgian independence===

Back in Georgia, Tsereteli delivered a speech on 23 February 1918 at the Transcaucasian Centre of Soviets, reporting on the events in Russia. He warned the delegates of the problems dual power had caused, and that the soviet would have to surrender its power to a legislative body. This was established as the &quot;Seim&quot;, a &quot;de facto&quot; parliament created the same day. A member of this new body, Tsereteli took up a leading role in helping defend the Transcaucasus, which included Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia, from the approaching forces of the Ottoman Empire. He strongly denounced the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, which was signed between the Bolshevik government and the Central Powers to end Russia&#x27;s involvement in the war, as it would have meant ceding important Transcaucasian territories to the Ottoman, such as the Black Sea port city of Batumi. In response to this the Transcaucasus declared war against the Ottoman Empire on 14 April.

The tripartite Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic was formed on 22 April, though due to the ongoing invasion by the Ottoman Empire and the lack of unity among the three groups, it was immediately in a precarious position. The Georgians, afraid for their own country and future, began negotiating with Germany for protection against the Ottomans, which would come in the form of an independent state. On 26 May Tsereteli gave a speech to the Seim stating that from the start the Transcaucasian Republic had been unable to operate due to its people not being unified. On the same day, the Georgian leadership declared an independent state, the Democratic Republic of Georgia. This was followed two days later by Azerbaijan and, finally, Armenia, dissolving the Transcaucasian Republic.

Within the new Georgian state Tsereteli took up a seat in the Constituent Assembly, which was elected in February 1919. However, he did not play a major role in the Georgian government, instead helping out more in an advisory role. That he supported what was essentially a nationalist state contradicted his earlier internationalist stance, though Roobol suggested that Tsereteli &quot;wanted a state which would be more than a Georgian national state&quot;, and championed the causes of the ethnic minorities within Georgia. Even so, he was no longer able to exercise much political influence, and faded into the background.

===Paris Peace Conference and Europe===
In 1919, Tsereteli and Nikolay Chkheidze were asked to lead a Georgian delegation to the Paris Peace Conference; the two were asked to attend on account of their contacts in Europe, and as neither had a major role in the Georgian government they could leave Georgia for an extended period. They faced considerable difficulties there, as many of the delegates were unfamiliar with the situation in Georgia, so both Tsereteli and Chkheidze gave several newspaper interviews expressing that Georgia was only interested in gaining &quot;de jure&quot; recognition of its independence. Tsereteli subsequently visited London to help their cause. While he did not make much of an impact with the British government, the Georgian government was &quot;de facto&quot; recognized on 10 January 1920, mainly because the British wanted allies in the region in case the Bolsheviks allied with the Turks and took over the region.

His diplomatic efforts a success, Tsereteli returned to advocating socialism. In the summer of 1920 he represented the Georgian Social Democratic Party at a Labour and Socialist International conference in Switzerland and promoted the success of Georgia as a socialist state. He also proved instrumental in helping Karl Kautsky, a leading Marxist theoretician, arrive in Georgia in August 1920 to research a book on the country. However, his health problems returned, and Tsereteli was ordered by a doctor to rest in December of that year.

==Exile and later life==

Tsereteli was recovering in France when he heard about the Red Army invasion of Georgia and subsequent Bolshevik takeover in February 1921. The news had a detrimental impact on his health, and he retired to a French village for the summer. He also worried about his Nikoladze aunts, as they had lost considerable amounts of money with the Bolshevik occupation. When his health improved in October, Tsereteli moved to Paris, joining the Georgian government-in-exile. In exile he lived frugally, and quickly grew tired of residing in France, enjoying any opportunity to travel. The suicide of Chkheidze in 1926 had a profound impact on Tsereteli, and it exacerbated his distaste for exile.

After retiring from émigré political life in 1930, Tsereteli resumed his law studies, which he had never completed in his youth, finishing in 1932, and worked in Paris as a lawyer. He also helped edit fellow Menshevik Pavel Axelrod&#x27;s works after the latter&#x27;s death in 1928. Initially working with Fedor Dan, whom he had met during his Siberian exile, Tsereteli and Dan clashed as the latter had become more pro-Bolshevik, and Dan ultimately left the project over their dispute. Tsereteli would later be aided in this work by his friend and fellow socialist Vladimir Voitinsky, and the project was published in Germany in 1932.

Highly indignant about what he called the &quot;platonic attitute&quot; of the Western socialist parties towards Georgia and their inadequate support to the beleaguered country, Tsereteli continued to regard Bolshevism as the cause of the troubles, but believed that the Bolshevik regime would not survive long. He continued to attend International&#x27;s conferences in Europe, trying to get the organization to adopt a stronger anti-Bolshevik stance, though with limited success. He attended the Conference of the Three Internationals in Berlin, at which the issue of Georgia was a major topic. By 1928, as the inner conflicts of the Bolsheviks ended, it became apparent to Tsereteli that they would not so easily be removed from power, and his hopes of returning to Georgia faded.

Tsereteli gradually distanced himself from his fellow Georgian exiles, and opposed both the liberal nationalist Zurab Avalishvili and the social democrat Noe Zhordania; all three wrote extensively abroad on Georgian politics. Tsereteli accepted the principle of the fight for Georgia&#x27;s independence, but rejected the view of Zhordania and other Georgian émigrés that the Bolshevik domination was effectively identical to Russian domination. Furthermore, he insisted on close cooperation between the Russian and Georgian anti-Bolshevik socialists, but did not agree with any cooperation with Georgian nationalists. This led to Tsereteli&#x27;s isolation among fellow émigrés and he largely withdrew from political activity. Invited to join Voitinsky in the United States, Tsereteli waited until after the Second World War ended to do so, finally moving in 1948. Columbia University asked him to finish writing his memoirs, which he continued to work on until his death in 1959. In 1973, he was reburied at the Leuville Cemetery near Paris.

==Political views==
Throughout his life Tsereteli remained a committed internationalist, adopting this view during his first exile in Siberia. He felt that if the population of the Russian Empire were united, and not divided along ethnic or national lines, socialist policies could be implemented. His views were heavily influenced by the writings of Pavel Axelrod, whom Tsereteli considered his most important teacher. After reading Lenin&#x27;s &quot;What Is To Be Done?&quot; in 1902, he came to oppose Lenin&#x27;s Marxist views. Tsereteli never deviated from his internationalist stance, which eventually led to conflict with other Georgian Mensheviks, who became far more nationalist throughout the 1920s.

Upon the outbreak of the First World War, Tsereteli, still exiled in Siberia, formulated a policy that allowed for the continuation of the war, in contrast to the more mainstream socialist goals of pressuring governments to end the conflict. This policy, expressed in three articles written by Tsereteli, would become known as &quot;Siberian Zimmerwaldism&quot;, in reference to the Zimmerwald Conference of 1915 that first saw the socialist views of the war put forth. Siberian Zimmerwaldism allowed for, under certain circumstances, a defensive war, though Tsereteli argued that only Belgium fitted these criteria, as the other warring states were fighting offensively. Though he edited the journal that published the Siberian Zimmerwaldist views, Tsereteli only wrote three articles during the war, making it difficult to fully comprehend his views at the time.

==Legacy==
During his political career, Tsereteli was highly regarded by his peers, though he has since faded into relative obscurity. His leading role in the Petrograd Soviet led Lenin to refer to Tsereteli as &quot;the conscience of the Revolution&quot;. Trotsky also paid tribute to him as &quot;a splendid speaker whose moral authority had a strong appeal&quot; adding: &quot;He was the only one of my opponents to be take seriously, but, as is often the case in history, it took a revolution to prove that Tsereteli was not a revolutionary.&quot; Lvov would later call him &quot;the only true statesman in the Soviet&quot;. However, his refusal to perceive the Bolsheviks as a serious threat, even as late as October 1917, ultimately helped them lead the October Revolution. As Georgi Plekhanov, a contemporary Marxist and revolutionary, stated: &quot;Tsereteli and his friends without themselves knowing or desiring it, have been preparing the road for Lenin.&quot;

Tsereteli quickly faded from prominence in histories of the era. Rex A. Wade, one of the preeminent historians of the Russian Revolution, noted that Tsereteli &quot;was not as flamboyant as Kerensky or as well known to foreigners as Miliukov, and therefore has not attracted as much attention as either in Western writings&quot;. Roobol concluded that &quot;it was [his] prestige rather than the force of his arguments which won over the doubters&quot;. Roobol also described Tsereteli&#x27;s career as &quot;a rapid rise, a short period of generally recognized leadership and a rather more gradual slide into political isolation&quot;.

<text>Hryhorii Skovoroda, also Gregory Skovoroda or Grigory Skovoroda (; , ; , ; 3 December 1722 – 9 November 1794) was a philosopher of Ukrainian Cossack origin who lived and worked in the Russian Empire. He was a poet, a teacher and a composer of liturgical music. His significant influence on his contemporaries and succeeding generations and his way of life were universally regarded as Socratic, and he was often called a &quot;Socrates&quot;.

Skovoroda, whose native tongue was vernacular Ukrainian, wrote his texts in a mixture of three languages: Church Slavic, Ukrainian, and Russian, with some elements from Latin and Greek and a large number of Western-Europeanisms. Different views exist about how to characterize the base language upon which he developed his highly individual idiom. One scholar has identified this base language as the variety of Russian spoken by the upper classes in Kharkiv and the surrounding Sloboda Ukraine region; this version of Russian contained many Ukrainianisms. According to another view, he wrote some of his works in the Ukrainian variety of Church Slavonic and others in the old Ukrainian literary language. The majority of his surviving letters are written in Latin and Greek.

He received his education at the Academia Mohileana in Kiev (now Kyiv, Ukraine). He led the life of an itinerant thinker-beggar. In his tracts and dialogs, biblical problems overlap with those examined earlier by Plato and the Stoics. Skovoroda&#x27;s first book was issued after his death in 1798 in Saint Petersburg. Skovoroda&#x27;s complete works were published for the first time in Saint Petersburg in 1861. Many of his works existed only in manuscript form before this edition.

== Life ==

Skovoroda was born into a small-holder Ukrainian Registered Cossack family in the village of Chornukhy in Lubny Regiment, Cossack Hetmante (In 1708 the territory of Cossack Hetmanate was incorporated into the Kiev Governorate, though the Cossack Hetmanate was not liquidated), Russian Empire (modern-day Poltava Oblast, Ukraine), in 1722. His mother, Pelageya Stepanovna Shang-Giray, was directly related to Şahin Giray and was of partial Crimean Tatar ancestry. He was a student at the Kyiv-Mohyla Academy (1734–1741, 1744–1745, 1751–1753) but did not graduate. In 1741, at the age of 19, due to his uncle Ignatiy Poltavtsev he was taken from Kiev to sing in the imperial choir in Moscow and St. Petersburg, returning to Kiev in 1744. He spent the period from 1745 to 1750 in the kingdom of Hungary and is thought to have traveled elsewhere in Europe during this period as well. In 1750 he returned to Kiev. From 1750 to 1751, he taught poetics in Pereiaslav. For most of the period from 1753 to 1759, Skovoroda was a tutor in the family of a landowner in Kovrai. From 1759 to 1769, with interruptions, he taught such subjects as poetry, syntax, Greek, and ethics at the Kharkоv Collegium (also called Kharkiv Collegium). After an attack on his course on ethics in 1769 he decided to abandon teaching.

Skovoroda is known as a composer of liturgical music, as well as a number of songs to his own texts. Of the latter, several have passed into the realm of Ukrainian folk music. Many of his philosophical songs known as &quot;Skovorodskie psalmy&quot; (Skovorodian psalms) were often encountered in the repertoire of blind traveling folk musicians known as kobzars. He was described as a proficient player on the flute, torban and kobza.

In the final quarter of his life he traveled by foot through Sloboda Ukraine staying with various friends, both rich and poor, preferring not to remain in one place for too long. During this time, he dedicated himself to individual hermit-like monastic life and study.

This last period was the time of his great philosophical works. In this period as well, he continued to write in the area of his greatest earlier achievement: poetry and letters in Church Slavonic language, Greek and Latin. He also translated a number of works from Latin into Russian.

Three days before he died, he went to the house of one of his closest friends and told him he had come to stay permanently. Every day he left the house with a shovel, and it turned out that he spent three days digging his own grave. On the third day, he ate dinner, stood up and said, &quot;my time has come.&quot; He went into the next room, lay down, and died. He requested the following epitaph to be placed on his tombstone:

He died on 9 November 1794 in the village called Pan-Ivanovka (today is known as Skovorodinovka, Bohodukhiv Raion, Kharkiv Oblast).

== Language ==
Different views exist about the nature of the language in which Skovoroda wrote his works. He spoke his native vernacular Ukrainian in his everyday life; his student and biographer Mikhail Kovalensky writes that Skovoroda &quot;loved his native language and rarely compelled himself to speak in a foreign one.&quot; However, except for his works in Latin and Greek, Skovoroda wrote in a mixture of Church Slavonic, Russian, and Ukrainian. He also integrated some elements from Latin, Greek, and other languages, including a significant amount of Western-Europeanisms. Slavic linguist George Shevelov characterizes his language (not counting quotations from the Bible and numerous poetic experimentations) as &quot;R[ussian] as it was then used in Xarkiv and &quot;Slobožаnščyna&quot; [Sloboda Ukraine] by educated landowners and the upper class in general,&quot; a form of Russian which &quot;grew up on the Ukrainian substratum,&quot; contained many Ukrainianisms, and differed from the Russian of Moscow and Saint Petersburg. Upon this linguistic core, writes Shevelov, Skovoroda developed a very individual idiom not equivalent to its base colloquial language. In his study of Skovoroda&#x27;s language published in 1923, linguist Petro Buzuk describes the philosopher&#x27;s idiom as mainly based on the written Russian of the 18th century, albeit with forms from Ukrainian, Polish and Old Church Slavonic. 

Literary scholar Leonid Ushkalov states that Skovoroda&#x27;s language is a &quot;&quot;lingua mixta&quot; [mixed language]&quot; which differs greatly from the Russian of 18th-century Ukrainian authors from Kharkiv. He writes that Skovoroda &quot;had reasons to consider his &#x27;language of writing&#x27; to be Ukrainian.&quot; (On a few occasions, Skovoroda referred to the language of his works as the &quot;common [dialect],&quot; the &quot;local dialect [&quot;zdeshneie narechiie&quot;],&quot; or &quot;Little Russian [&quot;malorossiiskii&quot;]&quot;; the term &quot;Little Russia&quot; then referred to most of the territory of Ukraine.) It contains parallel Ukrainian and Russian words and mixed Russian-Ukrainian word forms. According to Vitaly Peredriyenko, 84% of the word forms in Skovoroda&#x27;s poetry collection &quot;Sad bozhestvennykh pesnei&quot; (&quot;The Garden of Divine Songs&quot;) corresponds to the new Ukrainian literary language in terms of vocabulary and word formation; his philosophical dialogues were found to contain a somewhat lower percentage (for example, 73.6% in his &quot;Narkiss&quot;). According to philologist Lidiia Hnatiuk, while some modern Ukrainian readers perceive Skovoroda&#x27;s language as Russian, the overwhelming majority of Skovoroda&#x27;s philosophical works are written in the Ukrainian variety of Church Slavonic, whereas his poems and fables are in the old Ukrainian literary language; she states, however, that the boundary between these two varieties is &quot;very conditional.&quot;

Skovoroda appears to have been aware of the uniqueness of his language and defended it from criticisms. A number of later authors criticized Skovoroda&#x27;s language. His unusual language was attributed to the influence of his education or the conditions of the time; alternatively, he was accused of &quot;backwardness&quot; and failing to grasp contemporary problems. The Ukrainian writer Ivan Nechuy-Levytsky called Skovoroda&#x27;s mixed language &quot;strange, variegated, [and] generally dark.&quot; Ukrainian poet Taras Shevchenko wrote that Skovoroda &quot;would also have been [a poet for the people] were it not that Latin and later the Russian language diverted him.&quot; In 1901, the Russian novelist Grigory Danilevsky wrote that Skovoroda wrote in &quot;a heavy, obscure and strange language... worthy of a seminarian, clumsy and often unclear.&quot; In the 1830s, when a group of Romantic authors in Kharkiv was preparing the publication of Skovoroda&#x27;s works, they considered &quot;translating&quot; his writings into Russian so as not to &quot;frighten away&quot; readers. According to Shevelov, Skovoroda&#x27;s stylistic choices were deliberate and not the result of a poor education; the &quot;High Baroque&quot; style that he represented did not attempt to replicate the spoken language in literature. His language seemed &quot;dead&quot; to later readers, writes Shevelov, since the Russian of the upper classes in the Sloboda Ukraine region had by then become almost identical to standard Russian and had become more secular.

Skovoroda was fluent in Latin, which was the language of instruction at the Kyiv-Mohyla Academy during his matriculation there. He wrote a number of short poems in Latin, including fables. Per Shevelov, these Latin poems were mainly written &quot;as experiments and/or with a pedagogical purpose.&quot; The majority of his surviving letters are written in Latin and Greek. Individual words, phrases, and quotations in Latin, Greek, and sometimes Hebrew or other languages also appear in his Slavic writings. He had a very good knowledge of German and apparently also knew some French.

== Works ==

Skovoroda&#x27;s works were not printed during his life, due to censorship by church officials. Hryhorii Skovoroda was highly educated in different languages, in particular, Latin, Greek, German. He could read religious literature in German and was influenced by German pietism. Brought up in a spirit of philosophical and religious studies, he became an opponent of church scholasticism and the spiritual dominance of the Orthodox Church. &quot;Our kingdom is within us&quot; he wrote &quot;and to know God, you must know yourself...People should know God, like themselves, enough to see him in the world...Belief in God does not mean belief in his existence and therefore to give in to him and live according to His law... Sanctity of life lies in doing good to people.&quot;

Skovoroda taught that &quot;all work is blessed by God&quot;, but distribution of wealth outside the circle of God called unforgivable sin. Skovoroda taught that the only task of philosophy was to seek the truth and to pursue it. But in terms of human life, this goal is unattainable, and human happiness lies in the fact that everything has to find the truth. This goal can go in different directions, and intolerance of those who think differently, has no justification. Similarly, religious intolerance does not find justification for eternal truth revealed to the world in different forms. In relation to himself he was entirely uncompromising and as a result he achieved complete harmony between his teaching and his life. He was very gentle and observant in relation to others.
It was only in 1798 that his &quot;Narsisis or Know thyself&quot; was published in the Russian Empire, but without the inclusion of his name. In 1806 the magazine &quot;Zion Vyestnyk&quot; under the editorship of Alexander Labzin printed some more of his works. Then in Moscow in 1837–1839 a few of his works were published under his name, and only in 1861 the first almost complete collection of his works was published. On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the philosopher&#x27;s death, in Kharkiv (Kharkov), the publication of the famous seventh volume of the &quot;Transactions of the Kharkov Historico-Philological Society&quot; (1894), edited by Dmitriy Bagaley (after 1918 also known as Dmytro Bahalii), contained the bulk of Skovoroda&#x27;s oeuvre.
Here 16 of his works were published, 9 of which appeared for the first time. Also published here was his biography and some of his poems. A full academic collection of all known works by Skovoroda was published in 2011 by Leonid Ushkalov.

== Teaching ==
One of Skovoroda&#x27;s missions was teaching. Formally he taught poetics in the Pereyaslav Collegium (during 1750–1751) and poetics, syntax, Greek and catechism at Kharkov Collegium (also called Kharkiv Collegium and in Latin: &quot;Collegium Charkoviensis&quot; or &quot;Zacharpolis Collegium&quot;) (during 1759–1760, 1761–1764, 1768–1769).

In 1751 he had a dispute with the presiding bishop of the Pereyaslav Collegium, who considered Skovoroda&#x27;s new ways of teaching as strange and incompatible with the former traditional course of poetics. Young Skovoroda, confident in his mastery of the subject matter and in the precision, clarity and comprehensiveness of his rules of prosody, refused to comply with the bishop&#x27;s order, asking for arbitration and pointing out to him that &quot;alia res sceptrum, alia plectrum&quot; [the pastor&#x27;s scepter is one thing, but the flute is another]. The bishop considered Skovoroda&#x27;s stance as arrogant and consequently he was dismissed.

The first year of teaching at the Kharkov Collegium passed brilliantly for Skovoroda. He not only excited his students with his lectures but his creative pedagogical approach also attracted the attention of his colleagues and even his superiors.

Skovoroda was also a private tutor for Vasily Tomara (1740—1813) (during 1753–1754, 1755–1758) and a mentor as well as a lifelong friend of Michael Kovalinsky (or Kovalensky, 1745–1807) (during 1761–1769), his biographer. Probably he was also a private tutor for Gabriel Vishnevsky (1716—1752) (during 1745–1749), son of Fyodor Vishnevsky (1682—1749). Due to Fyodor Vishnevsky, Skovoroda has visited Central Europe, especially Hungary and Austria.

In his teaching Skovoroda aimed at discovering the student&#x27;s inclinations and abilities and devised talks and readings which would develop them to the fullest. This approach has been described by Skovoroda&#x27;s biographer Kovalinsky:
&quot;Skovoroda began [teaching young] Vasily Tomara by working more on the heart of his young disciple and, watching for his natural inclinations, he tried to help only the nature itself in developing him by engaging, light, and tender direction which the boy could not even notice, for Skovoroda paid particular attention not to overtax the young mind with [heavy] learning. In this way the boy became attached to Skovoroda with love [and trust for] him.&quot;

His teaching was not limited to academia nor to private friends and during his later years as a &quot;wanderer&quot; he taught publicly the many who were drawn to him. Archimandrite Gavriil (Vasily Voskresensky, 1795–1868), the first known historian of Russian philosophy, brilliantly described Skovoroda&#x27;s Socratic qualities in teaching:
&quot;Both Socrates and Skovoroda felt from above the calling to be tutors of the people, and, accepting the calling, they became public teachers in the personal and elevated meaning of that word. … Skovoroda, also like Socrates, not being limited by time or place, taught on the crossroads, at markets, by a cemetery, under church porticoes, during holidays, when his sharp word would articulate an intoxicated will - and in the hard days of the harvest, when a rainless sweat poured upon the earth.&quot;

Skovoroda taught that one finds his true calling by self-examination. &quot;Know yourself,&quot; advises Skovoroda using the well known maxim of the Greek philosopher Socrates. He introduced a well founded idea that a person engaged in an in-born, natural work is provided with a truly satisfying and happy life.

The education of young people occupied the attention of Skovoroda until his old age. In 1787, seven years before his death, Skovoroda wrote two essays, &quot;The Noble Stork&quot; (in Original: &quot;Благодарный Еродій&quot;, &quot;Blagorodnyj Erodiy&quot;) and &quot;The Poor Lark&quot; (in Original: &quot;Убогій Жаворонокъ&quot;, &quot;Ubogiy Zhavoronok&quot;), devoted to the theme of education where he expounded his ideas.

Skovoroda&#x27;s broad influence is reflected by the famous writers that appreciated his teachings: Vladimir Solovyov, Leo Tolstoy, Maxim Gorky, Andrei Bely, Taras Shevchenko and Ivan Franko.

== Tributes ==


On 15 September 2006, Skovoroda&#x27;s portrait was placed on the second largest banknote in circulation in Ukraine, the ₴500 note.

The Hryhoriy Skovoroda Institute of Philosophy, founded in 1946, operates under the auspicies of the National Academy of Science of Ukraine (until 1991 Academy of Sciences of the UkrSSR).

In the village of Skovorodynivka in Kharkiv oblast, Ukraine, a museum of Skovoroda was located. The museum was operating in a building dated back to the 18th century, on an estate where Skovoroda was buried. On the night of 6–7 May 2022 the building was destroyed with a direct Russian missile strike due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The shell flew under the roof of the building, and a fire broke out. The fire engulfed the entire museum premises. As a result Skovoroda National Museum was destroyed together with the historical building. The museum collection was not damaged since it was moved as a precaution in case of a Russian attack. Interestingly the statue of Skovoroda in the building remained standing surrounded by debris of the destroyed building.

On 2 December 2022, on the 300th anniversary of Skovoroda&#x27;s birth, a monument to him was installed in Washington, D.C., near the Ukraine House. It was created in 1992 by American sculptor Mark Rhodes who was inspired by Skovoroda&#x27;s ideas.
== In popular culture ==
The following pop songs were written on Skovoroda&#x27;s poems:
* &quot;Ptashko&quot; by Sonyachna Mashyna (2019)
* &quot;Kurs Valüt&quot; by Kurs Valüt (2020)

On 26 January 2024 the Kharkiv City Council renamed Khrakiv&#x27;s Pushkinska street to Hryhorii Skovoroda street. This was done in response to a 23 January 2024 Russian bombing of Kharkiv that cased 9 victims, including a 4-year-old child. In the evening in particular, the central Pushkinska Street had been hit.

==Syndication==
In 1995, &quot;The Hitchhiker&quot; entered syndication. To make the HBO episodes suitable for US broadcast television, edits were made, both for content (to remove nudity/gore/adult language) and for running time, to get them down to the standard 22-minute length needed to insert commercials. Reruns in foreign markets, such as Canada and Europe, often still contained the nudity/language/gore.

After 1983, (but prior to the 1995 syndication), the first three episodes had footage edited and/or re-shot to replace Nicholas Campbell with Page Fletcher, in order to preserve continuity during reruns. &quot;The Hitchhiker&quot; was syndicated by Rysher Entertainment (since absorbed by CBS Television Distribution) up until 2000.

==Home media==
Lorimar Home Video released four VHS volumes of HBO episodes to the rental market in 1987 (a trade ad for the first two volumes confirms those were also released on Beta format). Volume 1 contained &quot;W.G.O.D&quot;, &quot;The Curse&quot; and &quot;Hired Help&quot;. Volume 2 consisted of &quot;Nightshift&quot;, &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Curve&quot; and &quot;Perfect Order&quot;. The third volume had &quot;Ghostwriter&quot;, &quot;And If We Dream&quot; and &quot;True Believer&quot;. The final Lorimar tape had &quot;Videodate&quot;, &quot;Man&#x27;s Best Friend&quot; and &quot;Face to Face&quot;. These four volumes were also issued on laserdisc the following year.

Budget label Goodtimes Home Video also released a single VHS volume containing three of the USA Network episodes in 1989. That tape contained &quot;Her Finest Hour&quot;, &quot;In Living Color&quot; and &quot;My Enemy&quot;.

HBO Home Video released a three-volume set on DVD between 2004–2006, featuring various episodes from the series. The two-disc, three-volume sets contain a selection of 30 episodes, most from the HBO-produced episodes but also including some that were made for the USA Network. 

In Australia, Volumes 1 and 2 were issued together in a single set, but instead of 20 episodes, the Australian set consists of only 17, leaving out &quot;The Legendary Billy B.&quot;, &quot;A Whole New You&quot; and &quot;Dead Heat&quot;. 

In the United Kingdom, only the first HBO volume was released. This particular release contained nine episodes instead of 10. As with the Australian set, &quot;The Legendary Billy B.&quot; is omitted from this release.

In Canada, Koch Entertainment (now known as Entertainment One) released Canadian seasons 1 and 3 (which correspond to US Seasons 1-3 and 5, respectively) on DVD in 2004. On October 18, 2005, Koch released The Complete Fourth Season (which corresponds to US Season 6). According to Koch, the reason Canadian Season 2 (US Season 4) was not released was due to them not being able to find out who owned the Canadian distribution rights to those particular episodes.

Alliance Home Entertainment released &quot;The Hitchhiker: The Complete Collection&quot; on DVD in Canada for the very first time on October 11, 2011. &quot;The Complete Collection&quot; is a bit misleading in that this does not contain all episodes (or even all of the HBO episodes). What is &quot;complete&quot; is that this release combines the three previously-released HBO Home Video volumes into one set.

Between the three HBO volumes and the Canadian season sets, all episodes of the show were released on home video except for &quot;Minuteman&quot; and &quot;Doctor&#x27;s Orders&quot; (both of which came from US Season 4).

As of 2024, &quot;The Hitchhiker&quot; is not available on HBO&#x27;s streaming service, Max.

<doc id="309148" wikidata="Q156522" url="?curid=309148" title="Piperaceae">
<text>The Piperaceae (), also known as the pepper family, are a large family of flowering plants. The group contains roughly 3,600 currently accepted species in five genera. The vast majority of species can be found within the two main genera: &quot;Piper&quot; (2,171 species) and &quot;Peperomia&quot; (over 1,000 species).

Members of the Piperaceae may be small trees, shrubs, or herbs. The distribution of this group is best described as pantropical.

The best-known species, &quot;Piper nigrum&quot;, yields most peppercorns that are used as spices, including black pepper, although its relatives in the family include many other spices. The family Piperaceae is unrelated to the family Solanaceae, which includes bell peppers and chili peppers, which are so named due to Europeans taking part in the Columbian exchange mistakenly believing the spicy fruits were a variety of the black pepper plant.

==Etymology==
The name Piperaceae is derived from the Sanskrit term &quot;pippali&quot;, .

==Taxonomy==
The APG III system of 2009 recognizes this family, and assigns it to the order Piperales in the unranked clade magnoliids. The family consists of five genera: &quot;Piper&quot;, &quot;Peperomia&quot;, &quot;Zippelia&quot;, &quot;Manekia&quot;, and &quot;Verhuellia&quot;. The previously recognised Pacific genus &quot;Macropiper&quot;, was recently merged into &quot;Piper&quot;. A tentative cladogram showing relationships based on Wanke et al. (2007) is shown below. This phylogeny was based on 6,000 base pairs of chloroplast DNA. Only recently has it become clear that &quot;Verhuellia&quot; is sister to the other four genera in the family.

==Characteristics==
Members of pepper family are small trees, shrubs, or perennial or annual herbs.

===Roots and stems===
Plants are often rhizomatous, and can be terrestrial or epiphytic. The stems can be either simple or branched.

===Leaves===
Leaves are simple with entire margins, and are positioned at the base of the plant or along the stem, and can be alternate, opposite, or whorled in arrangement. Stipules are usually present, as are petioles. The leaves are often noticeably aromatic when crushed.

===Flowers===
Inflorescences (in the form of spikes) are terminal, opposite the leaves, or located in the axils. Flowers are bisexual, with no perianth, each flower is subtended by a peltate bract. Stamens are 2–6, and hypogynous, with 2-locular anthers. There are usually 3-4 stigmas attached to a single pistil per flower, which is 1 or 3-4 carpellate. The ovary is 1 locular, and superior.

===Fruits and seeds===
Fruits are drupelike, with a single seed per fruit. The seeds have a minute embryo, and mealy perisperm.

== Traditional medicinal uses ==
Numerous members of the &quot;Piperaceae&quot; family are used in the traditional medicinal systems of indigenous population for a wide variety of illnesses. Many studies have been undertaken to investigate these uses, with a large number of them focusing especially on the active ingredient Piperine and related compounds found in many members of this family, especially Black pepper, Long pepper and Betel, as well as kavalactones found in Kava.

<text>Francesca Romana Rivelli (born 9 March 1955), professionally known as Ornella Muti, is an Italian actress.

Among the best-known Italian actresses, in her career, she has worked across various genres, working alongside Italian directors such as Damiano Damiani, Mario Monicelli, Dino Risi, Marco Ferreri, Carlo Verdone, Ettore Scola, Francesca Archibugi, Paolo Virzì, Umberto Lenzi, Francesco Nuti and many others. Outside of Italy, she is best known for her role as Princess Aura in the science fiction cult film &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; (1980).

== Career ==
Muti was born in Rome to a Neapolitan journalist father and Ilse Renate Krause, a Russian Baltic German sculptor from Estonia. Her maternal grandparents emigrated from Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg, Russia) to Estonia.

Muti modeled as a teenager and made her film debut in the 1970 film &quot;La moglie più bella&quot; (&quot;The Most Beautiful Wife&quot;) at the age of fourteen. In the early seventies, thanks to the great success of the film, she starred in numerous comedies, mainly ascribed to the erotic genre. In 1974, she played in the Mario Monicelli &quot;Come Home and Meet My Wife&quot;, which became a huge success and brought her wide popularity.
During the 1970s and 1980s she worked with the most popular Italian actors as Ugo Tognazzi, Vittorio Gassman, Marcello Mastroianni, Carlo Verdone, Renato Pozzetto, Paolo Villaggio, Francesco Nuti, Giancarlo Giannini in successful comedies as &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Perfect&quot;, &quot;Bonnie and Clyde Italian Style&quot;, &quot;Rich and Poor&quot;, &quot;All the Fault of Paradise&quot;, &quot;Me and My Sister&quot;, &quot;Tonight at Alice&#x27;s&quot;, and also dramatic movies as &quot;The Last Woman&quot;, &quot;The Bishop&#x27;s Bedroom&quot;, &quot;Nest of Vipers&quot;, &quot;Break Up&quot;, &quot;Tales of Ordinary Madness&quot; and &quot;The Future Is Woman&quot;.

With Adriano Celentano she made two of the most successful comedies in the history of Italian cinema: &quot;The Taming of the Scoundrel&quot; and &quot;Madly in Love&quot;.

In recent years she has alternated between working in independent and mainstream films, TV drama and TV hosting as at the Sanremo Music Festival in 2022.

She is one of the few Italian actresses to achieve an international career across Europe where she has worked with Pedro Masó, Francisco Lara Polop, Mario Camus, Vicente Aranda, Lucas Belvaux, Georges Lautner, Volker Schlöndorff, Mike Hodges, Anthony Hickox, Mike Figgis, Peter Greenaway, and Grigory Chukhray. Her best known movies in Europe are &quot;Swann in Love&quot; in which she acted with Jeremy Irons and Alain Delon, &quot;The Bilingual Lover&quot; where she starred with Javier Bardem, &quot;Hotel&quot;, with Salma Hayek, David Schwimmer, Lucy Liu, Burt Reynolds, and John Malkovich, and &quot;The Tulse Luper Suitcases, Part 1: The Moab Story&quot;, a multimedia project by Peter Greenaway.

In the United States she has worked with directors such as Woody Allen, John Landis, Eugene Levy, Buddy Giovinazzo and James Toback. She appeared also in &quot;Love and Money&quot;, &quot;Oscar&quot;, &quot;Once upon a Crime&quot;, &quot;Somewhere in the City&quot; and &quot;To Rome with Love&quot; and in the American TV movies &quot;Casanova&quot;, &quot;Wait Until Spring, Bandini&quot;, &quot;A Season of Giants&quot; and one episode of &quot;The Hitchhiker&quot; TV series.

In 1981, she turned down the lead role (later given to Carole Bouquet) in &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot; because her costume designer, Wayne Finkelman, was not hired by the production.

== Personal life ==

In 1999, she insured her breasts for $350,000.

In 2008, Muti introduced her own line of jewellery and subsequently opened several shops around the world.

In 2015, the Italian court of Pordenone sentenced her to eight months in prison for having cancelled a theatrical performance following a health problem, which did not prevent her from participating in a social dinner with Vladimir Putin in Saint Petersburg in December 2010. She avoided prison by paying 30,000 euros to the Verdi theatre as compensation.

Muti has been married twice, first to Alessio Orano (a fellow actor in &quot;The Most Beautiful Wife&quot;), from 1975 to 1981. She was married, secondly, to Federico Fachinetti, from 1988 to 1996. Muti has three children, including Naike Rivelli.

In 1994, she became a resident of Monaco.

On 1 February 2022, she announced that she would like to obtain Russian citizenship. She told TASS: &quot;It would be nice for me to get citizenship, because it is part of my culture associated with my mother. She died this year, and it would be a gift for her.&quot;

In July 2022, Muti was criticised by right-wing and conservative politicians for supporting the legalisation of cannabis in Italy.

<text>Carl Ivar Hagen (born 6 May 1944) is a Norwegian politician and former Vice President of the Storting, the Norwegian parliament. He was the leader of the Progress Party from 1978 to 2006, when he stepped down in favour of Siv Jensen. Under his leadership, he was the undisputed leader and, in many ways, personally controlled its ideology and policies.

Hagen has since been regarded by both political scientists, and political colleagues and rivals alike as one of the greatest politicians in Norwegian history for his ability to build a hugely successful party up from scratch and his significant impact on Norwegian politics. He has been described as the first postmodern politician in Norway. While his ideology is classical liberalism with some conservatism, his political style has been described as right-wing populist.

== Early life ==
Hagen was born to CEO Ragnar Hagen (1908–1969) and accountant Gerd Gamborg (1914–2008). He was named after his paternal grandfather, Carl, and his maternal grandfather, Ivar. He has two siblings, one younger, and one older sister. Hagen was before joining the Progress Party a passive member of the Young Conservatives, and according to him, both his parents voted for the Labour Party. According to Hagen himself and his secondary school classmates, he was relatively shy in his younger years. When he was seventeen years old, in 1961, he took work as an apprentice on the Norwegian America Line ship &quot;MS Foldenfjord&quot;. He achieved Examen artium in 1963. In 1964, he was conscripted in the Norwegian Army, and served as an engineer soldier at Eggemoen near Hønefoss, and Maukstadmoen in Troms.

After this, he left Norway for England. Originally wanting to become an engineer, he flunked mathematics in Sunderland and chose to study marketing and business studies in Newcastle instead, earning a Higher National Diploma in Business Studies in 1968. From being more reserved in his youngest days, he soon became a player in Northern English student politics. In 1967 he fought over the office of vice president of the National Union of Students against Jack Straw (later Labour Party MP and Secretary of State for Justice of the UK).

Prior to dedicating his professional life to politics, Hagen was CEO at Tate &amp; Lyle Norway from 1970 to 1974, and after falling out of parliament between 1977 and 1981, consultant of Finansanalyse from 1977 to 1979, and economic policy consultant in the oil industry from 1979 to 1981.

==Political career ==
Hagen has explained that he lost faith in the Conservative Party as an alternative to social democracy during the Per Borten cabinet (1965–1971), when taxes and the power of the state increased more than under Labour. Hagen, in contrast, wanted to reduce the power of the state over individuals, and the political views of Anders Lange were because of this appealing to him.

Hagen began his political career when, in 1973, he became a deputy representative in the Storting for the newly formed Anders Lange&#x27;s Party. He had attended the founding meeting of the party at &quot;Saga kino&quot; in April 1973 and had been asked by deputy leader Erik Gjems-Onstad if he wanted to stand for election for the party. Hagen, however, soon also lost faith in Anders Lange, albeit for other reasons, and along with some other party &quot;moderates&quot; in 1974, he broke away and formed the short-lived Reform Party. Later that year, after a year in parliament, Anders Lange died of a heart attack, resulting in Hagen becoming an MP, as he had been elected as Lange&#x27;s deputy to parliament. The Reform Party returned to and merged with Anders Lange&#x27;s Party the next year. In 1977, the party changed its name to the Progress Party, and Hagen was elected leader of the party in the 1978 national convention. As the party failed to get any representatives elected in 1977, Hagen was away from parliament for four years but he was elected in 1981.
Hagen has been regarded as the first postmodern politician in Norway by Gudleiv Forr, writing for the &quot;Norsk biografisk leksikon&quot;. His early success has been attributed to his ability to use the media in his favour by populist speeches. He also somewhat managed to moderate the profile of the party from the more vulgar tone of Anders Lange. Though he identifies himself as a classical liberal, his political practice has been described by political commentators as being populist. His ability to balance different political directions was seen by Forr as displaying &quot;his mastering of the role of being party leader.&quot; Forr also claimed that Hagen has a talent of double communication, which has left the diverse voter group of the party with different impressions of the policies of the party, which sometimes led to internal schisms. His success has also been attributed to his leadership tactics, which included suspending and removing members of the party who deviated too much from his views.

Hagen was elected into parliament for seven consecutive four-year periods from 1981 until he stepped down and decided not to run for the 2009 election. In 1979 to 1982, 1987 to 1991 and 1995 to 1999, he was also a member of Oslo&#x27;s city council. In 2005, Hagen was chosen as Vice President of the Storting, and held the position until he left Storting, in 2009. In 2006, he stepped down as party leader in favour of Siv Jensen. Part of the decision not to run for re-election, which he had made in 2007, apart from reaching the age of pension, was because Hagen had felt that he had been put on the sideline after retiring as party leader. He also said that he wanted more time to relax and to work as a consultant. After ending his high-profile political career, he started working for the public relations agency Burson-Marsteller in 2009, where he became among the company&#x27;s highest-paid lecturers.
In March 2010 it was however speculated about his comeback into Norwegian politics, as &quot;central Progress Party politicians&quot; wanted him to run for mayor of Oslo. Hagen himself did not entirely repudiate that thought and stated that he missed politics, as well as himself sunce he thought that politics had become boring without him. In September 2010, Hagen announced his candidacy for the office of mayor of Oslo for the 2011 local elections, and he quit his engagement with Burson-Marsteller. After receiving bleak polling figures, Hagen effectively dropped out of the race three days before the election.

In an internal party meeting on 9 November 2011, Hagen attempted to be chosen as the Progress Party&#x27;s representative in the Norwegian Nobel Committee, and in response, he withdrew from the party&#x27;s central board as well as from his position as &quot;senior general.&quot; After the meeting, he published a five-page note, criticising Siv Jensen and citing his resignation to be because of the &quot;treatment and humilitation&quot; that he received from the &quot;party leadership.&quot;

In April 2013, Hagen and Jensen declared that the conflict between them had been resolved. Hagen remains active in the public political debate, often criticising his own party, especially after it joined the Erna Solberg cabinet in 2013, the party&#x27;s first-ever participation in government.

Hagen was re-elected to the Storting at the 2021 parliamentary election for Oppland. At the time of his election, he became the oldest elected Storting representative since 1927. On his 80th birthday in 2024, he announced that he would not seek re-election at the 2025 election.

==Populist views==

The claim that the Progress Party is populist dates back to a motion of no confidence in 1986 for the Conservative Party prime minister, Kåre Willoch. During the parliamentary election campaign in 1985, the Progress Party had promised not to contribute to a socialist government. After the Conservative-led government proposed to increase petrol taxes, however, Hagen pulled his support for the government, which led to the formation of a Labour Party government.

In July 2016, Hagen endorsed Donald Trump for President of the United States, calling him &quot;a man of the people&quot; and comparing him to Ronald Reagan.

During an interview with the conservative document.no, Hagen stated that he identifies as economically liberal and nationally conservative. However, he clarified that he would not describe himself as a national conservative but rather as a (&quot;nasjonalliberalistisk&quot;; &quot;national liberal&quot;, &quot;nationallibertarian&quot;).

===Immigration and Islam===
Hagen has been accused of playing on domestic fears of foreigners and immigrants. Largely because of those populist views on immigration, political opponents of the Progress Party have repeatedly resorted to physical assaults on Hagen.

He is especially known for having presented several accusations against Muslims as well as Islam as a religion. In the 1987 election campaign, during a party convention, Hagen read aloud the &quot;Mustafa Letter&quot; (it was later revealed to be a forgery that, according to staff, Hagen was completely aware of), which portrayed the future Islamisation of Norway. The election in turn became a major electoral breakthrough for the party.

In 2004, Hagen delivered a speech at a convention of the independent Christian organisation Levende Ord in which he stated that &quot;we Christians are very much concerned with children. Jesus said, let the small children come to me. I can&#x27;t understand that Muhammad could have said the same. In the case that he could have said the same, it would have been: Let the small children come to me, so that I can exploit them in my struggle to Islamify the world.&quot; He also said that if Israel lost the fight in the Middle East, Europe would &quot;bow under to Islam&quot; if Muslim fundamentalists get it as they want: &quot;They have, in the same manner as Hitler, long ago made it clear that the long-term plan is to Islamify the world. They have come a long way, they have pierced deep into Africa, and have come a long way into Europe – and then we have to fight back.&quot; He was because of the speech criticised by politicians and religious leaders in Norway. Some days later, the ambassadors of Pakistan, Indonesia, Egypt and Morocco and the chargé d&#x27;affaires of Tunisia made an unusually-strong attack on Hagen in a letter in the newspaper &quot;Aftenposten&quot;.

Hagen has also been praised for pointing to problematic aspects of immigration. In 2009, he received a &quot;bridge builder award&quot; from the Norwegian-Pakistani committee for the celebration of the Pakistani Independence Day in Norway, for his &quot;strong engagement in integration politics.&quot;

===Media===
Hagen has been critical of the media. He gave the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation, whose abbreviation is NRK, the nickname &quot;ARK&quot; (&quot;Arbeiderpartiets Rikskringkasting&quot;), a pun that is meant to be understood as the &quot;Labour Party Broadcasting Corporation&quot;. He considers it and other media to be biased against the Progress Party. In the 2009 parliamentary election, he stated that the election had seen the worst case of media bias against the Progress Party and that the Norwegian media had been able to control the election campaign more than before against those they interrupt during debates, the issues that they choose to ask the different parties and whom they invite to join the debates.

==Books==

===&quot;Ærlig talt: Memoarer 1944–2007&quot; (2007)===
&quot;Ærlig talt&quot; was mainly written as Hagen&#x27;s personal memoirs, and particularly described his political career. According to &quot;Cappelen Damm&quot;, Hagen writes &quot;openly about his strategic choices, about central political processes, conflicts and victories – and about how they formed him and the party.&quot; He was also described as an &quot;experienced and outspoken politician&quot; who in his book was &quot;hard-hitting, straight to the chase – and with continued willingness and ability to provoke.&quot; The book also contains, among other things, Hagen&#x27;s personal characterisations of several political opponents.

Hagen started the presentation of his book by talking about circumstances in the 2001 Terje Søviknes sex-scandal. In the book, he also compared what he saw as a similar naïvety in the modern Norwegian immigration policy, and Neville Chamberlain&#x27;s failed negotiations with Adolf Hitler in the prelude to the Second World War. When discussing the aftermath of the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy, he wrote that the management by the Norwegian government led freedom of speech to be &quot;subordinated to the respect for the warlord, man of violence and female abuser Muhammad, who murdered and accepted rape as a conquest technique.&quot; This was criticized by the Islamic Council Norway for &quot;insulting Muslims,&quot; a reaction Hagen considered to be &quot;as expected.&quot;

===&quot;Klar tale&quot; (2010)===
&quot;Klar tale&quot; is a debate book, where Hagen wrote his personal opinions. In the book, Hagen claimed that the policies used by the socialist parties were destroying the welfare state, by using poor solutions. He devoted much space to criticize The budgetary rule (&quot;handlingsregelen&quot;), which he claimed was preventing the development in Norway. He also criticized Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg&#x27;s &quot;bragging&quot; of Norway having the lowest unemployment figures in Europe after the financial crisis, which Hagen saw as obvious, given Norway&#x27;s oil wealth.

Hagen also discussed possible difficulties in potential government cooperation between the Progress and Conservative Party. He cited conflicts among &quot;strong individuals&quot; in both parties. Politically, he warned the Progress Party particularly against &quot;giving in&quot; regarding the immigration policy, which he said was one of the most important issues for the party, and that the party in such a scenario would fall rapidly in polls, and lose credibility. He also believed that &quot;if nothing is done,&quot; Norway risk the emergence of &quot;a Rosengård,&quot; and proposed for volunteers to take care of asylum seekers instead of the state, which he in turn believed would &quot;likely rapidly stop the flow of asylum seekers to Norway.&quot;

He also rejected the notion of man-made climate change, which he called the &quot;climate hoax,&quot; citing the 3–4 percentage of human produced CO2 to hardly be significant to general climate changes. He also proposed for the Progress, Labour and Conservative Party to agree on increasing the electoral threshold to five percent, so that several of the smaller parties would fall out of parliament.

== Personal life ==
Hagen married Nina Aamodt (born 17 January 1945) in 1970. They had two children and were divorced in 1975, according to Hagen as a consequence of his political work. After some years of cohabitation, in 1983 he was married again, to Eli Aas, herself also a divorcee and mother of two. She became Hagen&#x27;s closest political co-worker and advisor through his political career. As of August 2009, Hagen has seven grandchildren.

Major Carl-Axel Hagen (instructor at the War College in Oslo) is a son of his.

After living in Nøtterøy for years, Hagen and his wife moved back to Oslo in 2006. They also own a cabin in Sande, Vestfold.

His favorite musician is Elvis Presley, and he enjoys playing tennis.

<text>Teheran 43 (Russian: &quot;Тегеран-43&quot;; French: &quot;Téhéran 43, Nid d&#x27;espions&quot;) is a 1981 Soviet-French-Swiss political thriller film made by Mosfilm, &quot;Mediterraneo Cine&quot; and &quot;Pro Dis Film&quot;, directed by Aleksandr Alov and Vladimir Naumov. It is based on events around Operation Long Jump, the 1943 attempt by Nazi Germany to assassinate Winston Churchill, Joseph Stalin and Franklin Delano Roosevelt during the Tehran Conference.

The film was the leader of Soviet distribution in 1981 and had 47.5 million viewers. It won the Golden Prize at the 12th Moscow International Film Festival in 1981.

==Plot==
&quot;Teheran 43&quot; starts in 1980 in Paris. The memories of hero Andrei take the story back to 1943. The Germans planned to assassinate the three men 37 years later, and the German agent Max lives with Françoise, a young Parisian woman, who hides him. But another Nazi, Scherner, is hunting down Max who failed to carry out the planned assassinations. Max trusts Françoise but he does not know that she works for Scherner. Another plot in the movie is the romance between Andrei and the French woman Marie in 1943, followed in 1980.

Max Richard, an assassin of the Nazis, who was 37 years ago hired to assassinate Joseph Stalin, Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt during the Tehran Conference, is holed up in today&#x27;s Paris at the young French woman Françoise. In flashbacks, he describes Françoise who claims to be a neighbor in his apartment because she mistook the door, the assassination attempts. Max was brought in 1943 to Tehran as a funeral director of a previously murdered Persian. Max also kills the lawyer of the dead, Gérard Simon. But Simon&#x27;s interpreter Marie and the young Russian Secret agent Andrei get him on the loose. The two have no time for romance but thwart the assassination. They can arrest a fake photographer. The man who posed as a photographer and cinematographer &quot;Dennis Pew&quot; had a gun in his movie camera. Andrei, who cares for the safety of the young woman, sends Marie, who is in love with him, to France. They do not see each other again.

When Max wants to publish his memoirs and documents in Paris today with the help of the lawyer Legraine, Andrei travels to Paris. At an auction of Max&#x27;s documents in London, Andrej sees a young woman who is very similar to Marie. She is Marie&#x27;s daughter Nathalie. Françoise, meanwhile Max&#x27;s mistress, also pursues her own goals. She claims to work for his former client Scherner and to have spared Max only out of pity.

In Paris, the paths of Marie and Andreiand of Marie&#x27;s daughter Nathalie and police inspector Foche, who chases the former masterminds around Scherner, intersect. During a plane hijacking initiated by Scherner, Andrei meets Nathalie again. Foche, who wants to protect Nathalie&#x27;s mother, is assassinated in the back. Max gets scared when Marie is killed as a former witness after a short reunion with Andrei. Then, Françoise takes him to a new hiding place.

Andrei visits Nathalie and learns from her that Marie loved him all those years. She told her daughter about swimming together and told her about the dolphins, but those were just her dreams. In his new hideout, Max is shot by Scherner&#x27;s men. Legraine interrogates Scherner and Françoise; possibly, he will negotiate with them about the manuscript. Andrei travels back to Moscow.

<text>Alain Fabien Maurice Marcel Delon (; 8 November 1935 – 18 August 2024) was a French actor, film producer, screenwriter, singer, and businessman. Acknowledged as a cultural and cinematic leading man of the 20th century, Delon emerged as one of the foremost European actors of the mid 1950s to early 1980s, and became an international sex symbol. He is regarded as one of the most well-known figures of the French cultural landscape. His style, looks, and roles, which made him an international icon, earned him enduring popularity.

Delon achieved critical acclaim for his roles in films such as &quot;Women Are Weak&quot; (1959), &quot;Purple Noon&quot; (1960), &quot;Rocco and His Brothers&quot; (1960), &quot;L&#x27;Eclisse&quot; (1962), &quot;The Leopard&quot; (1963), &quot;Any Number Can Win&quot; (1963), &quot;The Black Tulip&quot; (1964), &quot;The Last Adventure&quot; (1967), &quot;Le Samouraï&quot; (1967), &quot;The Girl on a Motorcycle&quot; (1968), &quot;La Piscine&quot; (1969), &quot;Le Cercle Rouge&quot; (1970), &quot;Un flic&quot; (1972), and &quot;Monsieur Klein&quot; (1976). Over the course of his career, Delon worked with many directors, including Luchino Visconti, Jean-Luc Godard, Jean-Pierre Melville, Michelangelo Antonioni, and Louis Malle.

Delon received many film and entertainment awards throughout his career. In 1985, he won the César Award for Best Actor for his performance in &quot;Notre histoire&quot; (1984). In 1991, he became a member of France&#x27;s Legion of Honour. At the 45th Berlin International Film Festival, he won the Honorary Golden Bear. At the 2019 Cannes Film Festival, he received the Honorary Palme d&#x27;Or.

In addition to his acting career, Delon also recorded the spoken part in the popular 1973 song &quot;Paroles, paroles&quot;, a duet with Dalida as the main singing voice. He acquired Swiss citizenship in 1999.
== Family ==
The Delons are originally from Saint-Vincent-Lespinasse, in Tarn-et-Garonne. Their known genealogy goes back to Jean Delon, born in the fifteenth century. Delon&#x27;s paternal great-grandfather, Fabien Delon (Saint-Vincent-Lespinasse, 28 December 1829 - Figeac (Lot), 12 December 1909), a civil engineer, was decorated with the Legion of Honour in 1892. His paternal grandmother, Marie-Antoinette Evangelista (born in 1867 in Prunelli-di-Fiumorbo), was Corsican. On 3 December 1888 she married Delon&#x27;s paternal grandfather, Jean-Marcel Delon (Figeac, 4 November 1856 – L&#x27;Haÿ-les-Roses 1926), then a tax collector in Gap, who was appointed in Corsica in 1886. The couple had two children together, a son François Fabien Delon and a daughter Jeanne Lucidora Adele Delon.

Delon&#x27;s maternal grandfather, Alfred Louis Arnold (1876–1959), was born in Paris and was a rider of the French army, gendarme. His parents were Just Arnold, born in 1847 in Bürglen, Uri, a shoemaker by trade, and Marie-Adéle Lienemann, born in 1849, a cook. He married Maria Minard (1881–1913), a model for Jeanne Lanvin. The couple had two children: a daughter, Édith Marie Suzanne Arnold, and a son, Henri Arnold.

== Early life ==

===Childhood and education: 1935–1952===
Alain Fabien Maurice Marcel Delon was born in a house located at 99 Houdan Street on 8 November 1935 in Sceaux, a wealthy suburb of Paris in the department of Seine (now Hauts-de-Seine). Son of François Fabien Delon (Craponne-sur-Arzon, 12 March 1904 – Le Kremlin-Bicêtre, 17 September 1977), a projectionist and later the director of the cinema &quot;Le Régina&quot; in Bourg-la-Reine, and Édith Marie Suzanne Arnold (19 April 1911 – Jouy-en-Josas, 20 June 1995), an assistant employed in a pharmacy and a theater usher at the cinema, he was born into a petit-bourgeois family.

When Delon was four years old his parents divorced in 1939. Both of his parents remarried, as a result he had two half brothers and an adopted sister on his father&#x27;s side, and two half siblings on his mother&#x27;s side. He was then entrusted to a foster family, called Nero, who lived &quot;Rue de la Terasse&quot; which would remain for him a childhood wound that never healed. The father of this family was a prison guard in Fresnes Prison, Val-de-Marne. Delon, who lived next door, heard the salvo that executed the wartime collaborator Pierre Laval in the prison courtyard in 1945, the details of which he was told. While living with the foster family, Delon became passionate about bicycle racing and hoped to become a bicycle racer like Fausto Coppi.

When his foster parents died, Delon was sent back to his birth parents, who took shared custody of him. Growing up, he spent time living with his father and his second family in L&#x27;Haÿ-les-Roses and with his mother and her second family in Bourg-la-Reine. His parents then placed him in the Catholic boarding school of Saint-Nicolas d&#x27;Igny (Essonne), where he spent his entire youth with one of his best friends, Gérard Salomé. He developed his passion for music there. He joined the school choir and was also chosen to sing as a soloist. He was also congratulated on a performance by the Apostolic Nuncio to France Cardinal Angelo Roncalli, the later Pope John XXIII.

Due to the lack of attention from his parents, Delon became unruly, constantly misbehaving in the classroom and getting into fights with other children. He was expelled from the school after he beat up one of his classmates. The priests recommended he be sent to Saint Gabriel de Bagneaux. During his four years there, Delon constantly misbehaved and was disrespectful to his teachers. He then stole the director&#x27;s motorcycle which resulted in him being expelled again. Delon was expelled from a few more schools until the age of 13, when he entered Saint Nicolas d&#x27;Igny Institute. There he had the opportunity to perform the role of a thug in &quot;Le Rapt&quot;, a 22-second silent short film directed by Olivier Bourguignon, a friend of his father. At age 14, Delon decided he did not want to stay in the school and wished to leave France. He decided to run away to Chicago with his friend Daniel Salwadet who had an uncle living there. They left the school, determined to hitchhike to Bordeaux. When they arrived in Châtellerault, a passerby took them to the local police station. Due to Delon&#x27;s temper, he and his friend were put in jail and were sent back to their families. Because of his actions, Delon was expelled from the school. His parents then decided that studies were not for him and made Delon abandon them.

His mother, who had married Paul Boulogne, a butcher and delicatessen owner from Bourg-la-Reine, took him into the family home. He later said he never really found a place in that family and never felt safe there. Delon obtained a Certificate of Professional Aptitude (&quot;Certificat d&#x27;Aptitude Professionnelle&quot; or CAP) in charcuterie at the Au Jambon de Paris. For three years he worked at his stepfather&#x27;s delicatessen, which had sixteen employees and developed a very bad reputation in the community. He partied constantly and got into bar fights, and was also a member of a gang at one point.

===Military service and Indochina War: 1952–1956===
Anticipating the call up for military service, he joined the French Navy at age 17. After a stint at the Pont-Réan Maritime Training Centre, he continued his service in 1953 at the Bormette Signals School. After he was caught stealing equipment, the Navy gave him a choice of leaving it or extending his commitment from three to five years.

As a first-class seaman, he was then assigned to the protection company of the Saigon arsenal, in what was still French Indochina. Towards the end of the war, he was arrested for stealing a jeep and going on a trip during which the vehicle fell into a stream. His radio licence was revoked and he was expelled from the Navy. He celebrated his 20th birthday in a prison cell. This period made a deep impression on him: he discovered military discipline, a sense of honour and respect for the values represented by the flag of France. He developed a passion for weapons and was captivated by the performance of French actor Jean Gabin in &quot;Touchez pas au grisbi&quot;, a film he saw in the Indochinese capital.

After his Naval service, Delon returned to France in 1956. He resented his parents for letting him go to Indochina (he was a volunteer but their permission was necessary) and did not get back in touch with them, deciding to fend for himself and having no idea what he would do for a living. His younger brother Jean-François Delon would later be the first in his family to reconnect with him in 1961 after he and his father saw Alain&#x27;s name on a &quot;Rocco and His Brothers&quot; poster. Delon settled in at the Regina Hotel and did a few odd jobs, notably as a produce handler at the Paris market Les Halles and as a waiter in a café near the Champs-Élysées. He met the future singer Dalida, with whom he would have an affair later in life. In Pigalle and Montmartre, he met members of the French underworld, thugs and gigolos, one of whom, a &quot;homosexual named Carlos&quot;, ensured his protection. Delon was fascinated by the values of this environment, in particular the sense of honour, friendship, respect and the law of silence. His slim physique and his pleasant &quot;angelic face&quot; attracted women and allowed him to be housed and fed by several prostitutes, which was not to his displeasure. His future then seemed to be heading towards a career as a pimp.

== Acting career ==
===Early career: 1957–1958===
Delon discovered the bustling Saint-Germain-des-Prés district and at the &quot;Club Saint-Germain&quot; met the actress Brigitte Auber, who had recently acted for the director Alfred Hitchcock in &quot;To Catch a Thief&quot;. They lived together on rue du Pré-aux-Clercs, in the 7th arrondissement of Paris, which distanced Alain Delon from the underworld and changed his career path. On the occasion of the 1957 Cannes Film Festival, he went down with her to the Côte d&#x27;Azur and moved into the house she owned in Saint-Paul-de-Vence. It was during this festival that he became friends with Jean-Claude Brialy and came into contact with the film industry, where he met his future agent George Beaume. He was &quot;spotted&quot; by Henry Willson, who was in charge of recruiting new talent on behalf of the American film producer David O. Selznick, who offered him a trial run in Rome. He thus entered the world of cinema without any particular training as an actor.

In Rome, he lived with Gian Paolo Barbieri, who would become a famous photographer. In the Cinecittà studios, on the sidelines of the filming of Charles Vidor&#x27;s &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot;, he underwent conclusive auditions and Selznick offered him a seven-year contract in the United States on the condition that he learn English. Delon returned to Paris and began to study English, but the actress Michèle Cordoue, whose lover he had become, convinced her husband, the director Yves Allégret, to hire him to shoot his first film&quot;, Quand la femme s&#x27;en mêle&quot;. He played a small role alongside the star Edwige Feuillère. Alain Delon recounted: &quot;I didn&#x27;t know how to do anything. Allégret looked at me like that and he said: &#x27;Listen to me, Alain. Speak as you speak to me. Look at how you look at me. Listen as you listen to me. Don&#x27;t play, live.&#x27; It changed everything. If Yves Allégret hadn&#x27;t told me that, I wouldn&#x27;t have had this career.&quot;

He then appeared in the comedy &quot;Sois belle et tais-toi&quot; by Marc Allégret (Yves&#x27; brother), where he associated with Mylène Demongeot and Henri Vidal, as well as another young actor, a beginning actor like himself, Jean-Paul Belmondo. During the shooting, he borrowed the Renault 4CV belonging to Pascal Jardin, the director&#x27;s second assistant, against Jardin&#x27;s advice. In the Saint-Cloud tunnel, the borrowed car rolled over five times. The vehicle was destroyed and Delon escaped, suffering only a minor injury that left a scar under his chin which became characteristic of his image.

In 1958, he became a young leading man, he was chosen by the actress Romy Schneider, who had become a world celebrity following the success of the &quot;Sissi&quot; film trilogy, to play her male partner in &quot;Christine&quot; by Pierre Gaspard-Huit. The producers arranged an interview with the press at Orly airport in Paris: the two young actors met for the first time when Romy got off the plane on 10 April 1958. Their first relationship was stormy : Romy didn&#x27;t speak French, Alain Delon didn&#x27;t speak German, and while she found him uninteresting and in bad taste, he found her unattractive. Filming began two months later and the two actors did not get along at all. However, they ended up falling in love and the &quot;fiancés of Europe&quot; celebrated their official engagement, organized by Romy&#x27;s mother and stepfather in Morcote, Switzerland, on the shores of Lake Lugano, in front of the international press, without planning a date for a possible wedding. They embodied beauty, youth, success and became a couple celebrated by showbusiness and the public.

After &quot;Christine&quot;, where he played his first important role, Delon had his first success in Michel Boisrond&#x27;s &quot;Weak Women&quot;, where he reunited with Mylène Demongeot and also shared the bill with other young leads, Pascale Petit and Jacqueline Sassard. In &quot;Le Chemin des écoliers&quot;, based on Marcel Aymé, he played the son of the character played by Bourvil. His model was Jean Gabin.

===French stardom and international fame: 1959–1964===

Delon was given the lead in the comedy &quot;Women Are Weak&quot; (1959). This was a big hit in France and was the first of Delon&#x27;s films to be seen in America. Delon made some personal appearances in New York to promote the movie.

In a 1959 interview first aired on the French television program &quot;Cinépanorama&quot;, conducted during the filming of &quot;Rocco and His Brothers&quot;, Alain Delon expressed his admiration for Jean Marais, stating that he idolized the actor. &quot;Everything is happening very quickly for you, you must be caught in a whirlwind, do you manage to find yourself?&quot; He answered: &quot;I try to not let myself be overwhelmed. To remain what I was before, to remain as simple. I took as a model an actor that I love and that is Jean Marais, who always remained the same.&quot;
Delon next made two films that ensured his international reputation. In 1960, he appeared in René Clément&#x27;s &quot;Plein Soleil&quot;, released in the US as &quot;Purple Noon&quot;, which was based on the Patricia Highsmith novel &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot;. Delon played protagonist Tom Ripley to critical acclaim; Highsmith was a fan of his portrayal. The movie was a hit in France and on the art house circuit in English-speaking countries. He then played the title role in Luchino Visconti&#x27;s &quot;Rocco and His Brothers&quot; (1960). Critic Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that Delon&#x27;s work was &quot;touchingly pliant and expressive&quot;.

Delon made his stage debut in 1961 in the John Ford play &quot;&#x27;Tis Pity She&#x27;s a Whore&quot; alongside Romy Schneider in Paris. Visconti directed the production which broke box office records. He was reunited with René Clément in the Italian comedy film about fascism, &quot;The Joy of Living&quot; (1961). It was a minor success. More popular was an all-star anthology film &quot;Famous Love Affairs&quot; (1961); Delon&#x27;s segment cast him as Albert III, Duke of Bavaria, opposite Brigitte Bardot. Around this time Delon was mentioned as a possibility for the lead in &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;.

Peter O&#x27;Toole was cast instead, but then Delon was signed by Seven Arts to a four-picture deal, including a big budget international movie of the Marco Polo story and &quot;The King of Paris&quot;, about Alexandre Dumas. Neither project came to fruition. Instead he was cast by Michelangelo Antonioni opposite Monica Vitti in &quot;L&#x27;Eclisse&quot; (1962), a major critical success, although audiences were small. More popular was another all-star anthology film, &quot;The Devil and the Ten Commandments&quot; (1963); Delon&#x27;s segment cast him with Danielle Darrieux.

Producer Jacques Bar was making a heist film starring Jean Gabin with backing from MGM, titled &quot;Any Number Can Win&quot; (1963). Gabin&#x27;s co-star was going to be Jean-Louis Trintignant until Delon lobbied Bar for the role. He took the film&#x27;s distribution rights in certain countries instead of a straight salary. Because such an arrangement had never previously been made in France, it became known as &quot;Delon&#x27;s method&quot;. Delon&#x27;s gamble paid off handsomely, with Jean Gabin later claiming that Delon earned 10 times more money than he did as a result. However, in 1965, Delon claimed &quot;no one else has tried it since and made money&quot;.

The experience gave Delon a taste for producing. He signed a five-picture deal with MGM, of which &quot;Any Number Can Win&quot; was the first. His reputation was further enhanced when he worked with Visconti again in &quot;Il Gattopardo&quot; (&quot;The Leopard&quot;) with Burt Lancaster and Claudia Cardinale. It was the seventh biggest hit of the year in France. &quot;Any Number Can Win&quot; was the sixth. &quot;The Leopard&quot; was widely screened in the U.S. through 20th Century Fox. Delon was now one of the most popular stars in France. He starred in a swashbuckler, &quot;The Black Tulip&quot; (1964), another hit.

&quot;Les Félins&quot; (1964), which reunited him with Clement and co-starred Jane Fonda, was filmed in French and English versions. The latter was distributed by MGM, but it was not a success. In 1964, the Cinémathèque Française held a showcase of Delon&#x27;s films and Delon started a production company, Delbeau Production, with Georges Beaume. They produced a film called &quot;The Unvanquished&quot; (&quot;L&#x27;insoumis&quot;) in 1964, in which Delon played a terrorist OAS assassin. It had to be re-edited because of legal issues. Despite being distributed by MGM, audiences were small. After finishing the film, Delon left the French cinema to pursue a career in Hollywood.

=== Hollywood star: 1964–1966 ===

Typecast as a &quot;Latin lover&quot;, Delon spent the next few years focused on Hollywood. In 1965 he said that he wanted to make a picture in America and one in Europe each year. He also said that his accent prevented him from playing certain roles: &quot;Because of my accent, I would not attempt to play Americans. I am working on removing the distinctly French inflections from my speech so that I can play all continental nationalities.&quot;

He made his debut in the British film industry starring in an all-star anthology for MGM titled &quot;The Yellow Rolls-Royce&quot; (1965), opposite Shirley MacLaine. It was popular although Delon had little to do. He made his Hollywood debut as the lead role in the film &quot;Once a Thief&quot;, where he co-starred with Ann-Margret. It was based on a novel by Zekial Marko who had written &quot;Any Number Can Win&quot;, but it was not as successful. It was financed by MGM, which announced Delon would appear in a Western to be titled &quot;Ready for the Tiger&quot; and directed by Sam Peckinpah, but the film was never made.

Instead, Delon signed a three-picture deal with Columbia, for whom he appeared in the big budget action film &quot;Lost Command&quot; (1966), playing a member of the French Foreign Legion, alongside Anthony Quinn and Claudia Cardinale. The studio announced that he would appear in the biopic &quot;Cervantes&quot;, but this was never made. Universal Studios used Delon in a Western, &quot;Texas Across the River&quot;, opposite Dean Martin. Ray Stark wanted to use him in &quot;The Night of the Iguana&quot; and &quot;This Property Is Condemned&quot;. He did not appear in either film but acted in that producer&#x27;s &quot;Is Paris Burning?&quot;, directed by René Clément, playing Jacques Chaban-Delmas. This was a massive hit in France but performed disappointingly at the US box office – as did all of Delon&#x27;s Hollywood-financed films. Delon remained a massive star in France, along with Steve McQueen and Sean Connery, and was one of the biggest foreign stars in Japan. However, he could not make headway in the US market.
=== Return to France: 1967–1971 ===
After one British movie and four Hollywood movies Delon returned to France to rejoin the French cinema. He starred in the film &quot;The Last Adventure&quot; opposite Lino Ventura. It was one of Delon&#x27;s most popular films of the 1960s but was not popular in North America. He was meant to work again with Visconti in &quot;The Stranger&quot; but this did not happen. Instead, he appeared on the Paris stage in &quot;Les Yeux Crevés&quot; and starred in the neo-noir crime thriller &quot;Le Samouraï&quot; (&#x27;The Samurai&#x27;) with Jean-Pierre Melville, which became another film classic. He played an amnesiac in &quot;Diabolically Yours&quot; (1968) for Julien Duvivier.

He had a role in another all-star anthology, &quot;Spirits of the Dead&quot; (1968). His segment was directed by Louis Malle, and co-starred Brigitte Bardot. Delon had another attempt at English-language cinema with &quot;The Girl on a Motorcycle&quot; (1968) with Marianne Faithfull, for director Jack Cardiff. It was a surprise hit in Britain and was the sixth most popular movie in the box office, however it did not do well in France. &quot;The Girl on a Motorcycle&quot;, which was released in United States as &quot;Naked Under Leather&quot;, would be the first film to receive an X rating in the United States. Far more popular at the French box office was &quot;Farewell Friend&quot; (&quot;Adieu l&#x27;ami&quot;), in which Delon and Charles Bronson played former foreign legionnaires who get involved in a heist. The film helped turn Charles Bronson into a genuine star in Europe.

The film &quot;La Piscine&quot; reunited the 1960s &quot;couple mythique&quot; (&#x27;mythical couple&#x27;) Alain Delon and Romy Schneider. This was thought to be one of the reasons for its success. Schneider had dramatically broken up with Delon a couple years earlier and married German director and actor Harry Meyen in Berlin. She had a child. Delon asked the filmmaker to book her for this role. He continuously pursued her, both before and after filming &quot;La Piscine&quot;, with persistent attempts to reconcile. Despite Romy Schneider&#x27;s refusals, their shared history and emotional connection spilled onto the screen, infusing the film with raw authenticity.
While making the 1969 thriller &quot;La Piscine&quot; (&quot;The Swimming Pool&quot;) with Romy Schneider, the body of Delon&#x27;s Yugoslav secretary and bodyguard Stefan Marković, apparently murdered, was found in a rubbish dump near Paris. The police investigation revealed claims of sex parties involving celebrities such as Delon and members of the French government, including future president Georges Pompidou, whose wife Claude was allegedly the subject of a series of compromising photos at one such party. Corsican crime boss François Marcantoni, a friend of Delon, was suspected of involvement in the murder. The affair gained notoriety throughout France and in the French press as the &quot;Marković affair&quot;. In a 1969 BBC interview, Delon was questioned about his alleged involvement in the death of Marković, rumors of his involvement in the sex parties, and Delon&#x27;s own sexual preferences.

Delon then starred in a series of gangster films. The first was &quot;Jeff&quot; (1969), made by his own production company, Adel. In &quot;The Sicilian Clan&quot; (1969) Delon collaborated with Lino Ventura and Jean Gabin, and the film was a blockbuster. Even more popular in Europe was &quot;Borsalino&quot; (1970), which Delon produced and in which he co-starred opposite Jean-Paul Belmondo. Neither of these films was successful in the US, as Delon had hoped. Neither was &quot;The Red Circle&quot;, despite Delon co-starring in it with Yves Montand. For a change of pace, he produced a romantic drama, &quot;The Love Mates&quot; (1971), which was not successful. Neither was the 1971 comedy &quot;Easy, Down There!&quot;.

=== Established actor and more international films ===
==== 1970s ====

In the early 1970s, Delon made another attempt at the English-speaking market. &quot;The Assassination of Trotsky&quot; (1972) for Joseph Losey was poorly received, but &quot;Red Sun&quot; (1972), with Charles Bronson and Toshiro Mifune, did well. In France he appeared opposite Simone Signoret in &quot;The Widow Couderc&quot; (1971). He starred in his third film with Melville, &quot;Un flic&quot; in 1972 as well. He then produced and starred in a romantic drama, &quot;Indian Summer&quot; (1972), and subsequently appeared in the thrillers, &quot;Traitement de choc&quot; (1973), and &quot;Tony Arzenta&quot; (1973).

In 1973, he recorded a duet with Dalida, &quot;Paroles, paroles&quot;, that went on to become one of the most recognizable French songs. He tried again for Hollywood stardom with &quot;Scorpio&quot; (1973), with Burt Lancaster for director Michael Winner. It was only a minor hit. In France, he made &quot;The Burned Barns&quot; (1973) and &quot;Creezy&quot; (1974). He produced &quot;Two Men in Town&quot; (1974) which re-teamed him with Jean Gabin, and &quot;Borsalino &amp; Co.&quot; (1974), a sequel to his earlier hit.

After another gangster thriller, &quot;Icy Breasts&quot; (1974), Delon returned to his first swashbuckler since &quot;The Black Tulip&quot;, playing the title character in the 1975 Italian-French film &quot;Zorro&quot;. He made some more crime filmes: &quot;The Gypsy&quot; (1975), &quot;Flic Story&quot; (1975) (with Jean Louis Triginant), &quot;Boomerang&quot; (1976) and &quot;Armaguedon&quot; (1976). In 1976, Delon starred in &quot;Monsieur Klein&quot;, for which he was nominated for the César Award.

It was back to crime for another series of thrillers in which he starred as well as produced: &quot;Man in a Hurry&quot; (1977), &quot;Death of a Corrupt Man&quot; (1977), &quot;Le Gang&quot; (1977), and &quot;Attention, The Kids Are Watching&quot; (1978). In 1979, Delon stated that only a quarter of his business activities involved films, that he also had &quot;a helicopter business, built furniture, promoted prize fights, and raced horses&quot;, and that he was still interested in becoming a star in America.

In 1979 he made a final attempt at Hollywood stardom, signing with agent Sue Mengers and starring in &quot;The Concorde ... Airport &#x27;79&quot; (1979). The film was not a big success. Delon returned to acting in French films, playing in and producing &quot;The Medic&quot; (1979) and &quot;Three Men to Kill&quot; (1980).

=== Later career ===
==== 1980s and 1990s ====
&quot;Teheran 43&quot; (1981) was a change of pace. In this big Soviet production he co-starred with Claude Jade and Curd Jürgens (Curt Jurgens) in a co-starring role beside Russian actors. Then it was back to crime: &quot;For a Cop&#x27;s Hide&quot; (1981), &quot;Le Choc&quot; (1982, opposite Catherine Deneuve), &quot;Le Battant&quot; (1983). He was awarded the Best Actor César Award for his role in Bertrand Blier&#x27;s &quot;Notre histoire&quot; (1984), and portrayed the aristocratic dandy Baron de Charlus in a film adaptation of Marcel Proust&#x27;s novel &quot;Swann in Love&quot; in the same year.

His thrillers resumed with &quot;Parole de flic&quot; (1986), &quot;The Passage&quot;, &quot;Let Sleeping Cops Lie&quot; (1988), and &quot;Dancing Machine&quot; (1990). One notable film during this period was Jean-Luc Godard&#x27;s &quot;Nouvelle Vague&quot; in 1990, in which Delon played twins. Delon&#x27;s last major role was in Patrice Leconte&#x27;s &quot;Une chance sur deux&quot; in 1998, alongside Jean-Paul Belmondo, another box office disappointment. Delon announced his decision to give up acting in 1997, although he still occasionally accepted roles.

Delon acquired Swiss citizenship in 1999, and the company managing products sold under his name is based in Geneva. He resided in Chêne-Bougeries in the canton of Geneva.

=== Mature years and retirement ===
==== 2000s and 2010s ====
In 2001, Delon starred in the French television drama &quot;Fabio Montale&quot;. He played an ageing policeman dressed in stylish clothes, a &quot;signature Delon&quot; role for audiences. The show was a big hit. In 2003, Delon tried to recreate the success of &quot;Fabio Montale&quot; and produced and starred in another French television police drama, &quot;Frank Riva&quot;. It did well but less so than &quot;Fabio Montale&quot;.
He starred in 2008 as Julius Caesar in the box-office hit &quot;Asterix aux jeux Olympiques&quot;, which co-starred Gérard Depardieu. Around this time he mostly took roles in TV movies and also played some roles on the French stage.

He directed a TV movie in 2008, co-starring Anouk Aimée, titled &quot;Love Letters&quot; based on a play by A.R. Gurney. In 2018, after a seven-year hiatus from cinema, Delon had planned to star in a new movie, titled &quot;La Maison Vide&quot;, co-starring Juliette Binoche and directed by Patrice Leconte. However, in November 2018 the French media announced that the project had been canceled. No specific reason was given for the cancellation. Among his last roles were in the 2011 television movie &quot;Une journée ordinaire&quot;, and in the 2012 Russian production &quot;S Novym godom, Mamy!&quot; in which he starred as himself. He again appeared as himself in the 2019 movie &quot;Toute Resemblance&quot; as a guest on a talkshow.

In April 2019, at 83, Delon released a new single, &quot;Je n&#x27;aime que toi&quot;, composed by Rick Allison and Julia Paris. In 1973, Delon had scored a huge international hit duetting with Egyptian-French singer Dalida on the song &quot;Paroles, paroles&quot;. He also collaborated with Shirley Bassey in 1983 on the international hit song &quot;Thought I&#x27;d Ring You&quot;.
At the 2019 Cannes Film Festival, Delon received an honorary Palme d&#x27;Or for his long-standing career in movies. A retrospective of some of his films was shown at the festival. However, there was much controversy surrounding Delon receiving this award due to remarks he had allegedly made about the treatment of women during his career and in his private life. Thierry Frémaux, the artistic director of the festival, addressed the controversy during a homage at the ceremony, stating, &quot;We know that intolerance is back. We&#x27;re being asked to believe that if we all think the same, it will protect us from the risk of being disliked or being wrong. But Alain Delon is not afraid of being wrong, being disliked, and he doesn&#x27;t think like others, and he&#x27;s not afraid of being alone.&quot; Delon responded emotionally, saying, &quot;For me, it&#x27;s more than the end of a career. It&#x27;s the end of a life. It feels as though I&#x27;m receiving a posthumous tribute while being alive.&quot; He received the award from his daughter, Anouchka Delon.

==== 2020s ====
In a July 2021 interview on TV5Monde, his first since having two strokes, Delon said that he planned to act in one more film. Also on TV5Monde, Delon interviewed Ukrainian President Zelensky in September 2022 as part of a special programme on the war in Ukraine, &quot;Face à Zelensky&quot;. Delon expressed his support for the Ukrainian people during the interview.

== Business career ==
In the 1970s, Delon expanded his commercial interests, buying harness racing trotters and promoting boxing matches. He has also helped develop and promote a variety of products sold under his name including wristwatches, clothing, eyewear, perfume, stationery, and cigarettes. Delon&#x27;s brand of sunglasses became particularly popular in Hong Kong after actor Chow Yun-fat wore them in the 1986 crime film &quot;A Better Tomorrow&quot;, as well as two sequels. Delon reportedly wrote a letter thanking Chow for helping to promote and sell the sunglasses in Hong Kong and China.

The film&#x27;s director John Woo has acknowledged Delon as one of his idols and wrote a short essay on &quot;Le Samourai&quot; as well as &quot;Le Cercle Rouge&quot; for the Criterion Collection DVD releases. In 2009 and 2015, Christian Dior used images of the young Alain Delon and excerpts of his 1960s films &quot;The Swimming Pool&quot; and &quot;The Last Adventure&quot; respectively in the Eau Sauvage cologne advertising campaigns.

=== Boxing promoter ===
Delon was also a professional boxing promoter, Nino Cerruti introduced him to world middleweight champion Carlos Monzón. The largest fight he promoted was Monzón&#x27;s defense against José Napoles.

==Legal troubles==
=== Marković affair ===

On 1 October 1968, the body of Stefan Marković, Delon&#x27;s bodyguard, was found in a public dump in Élancourt, Yvelines, a village on the western outskirts of Paris. Delon and François Marcantoni, a Corsican gangster, came under investigation, partly because of a letter from Marković to his brother Aleksandar, in which he had written: &quot;If I get killed, it&#x27;s 100% the fault of Alain Delon and his godfather Francois Marcantoni.&quot; Following some articles in the press and testimony by Boriboj Akov, the investigation involved the former prime minister (and future president) of France, Georges Pompidou, who testified that he and his wife had been present at certain parties with Marković and Delon.

Marković&#x27;s death sparked rumours that there were photos of group sex that included Pompidou&#x27;s wife. Pompidou accused Louis Vallon and Henri Capitant of using the French espionage service SDECE to try to frame him. After he became president of France, he named Alexandre de Marenches as the head of the SDECE in order to reform it. De Marenches fired René Bertrand, alias Colonel Beaumont, Director of Research at the S.D.E.C.E, who had been involved in the investigation of Jean-Charles Marchiani and was the subject of rumors in the D.S.T., the French counter-espionage service, that he might be a Soviet agent.

=== Hiromi Rollin case ===
On 5 July 2023, Delon&#x27;s three children filed a complaint against his companion Hiromi Rollin, alleging psychological harassment, interception of correspondence, animal cruelty, intentional violence, unlawful confinement, and abuse of weakness. According to Anthony Delon, his father requested in writing that Mrs. Rollin leave the residence in Douchy-Montcorbon. A preliminary investigation was opened on 6 July. On 7 July, Yassine Bouzrou, lawyer for Hiromi Rollin, stated that she disputed &quot;the entirety of the facts&quot;. Bouzrou added that she would file a complaint against members of the Delon family and their bodyguards for aggravated voluntary violence suffered by Rollin on 5 July 2023. Meanwhile, Rollin wrote a letter to the prosecutor of Montargis in which she denied being Alain Delon&#x27;s companion, claiming to have had an intimate relationship with him for over twenty years (she stated in another interview that it was &quot;a love relationship of 33 years&quot;). The prosecutor of Montargis dismissed the two complaints filed by the three Delon children against Rollin due to insufficiently characterized offenses. Rollin&#x27;s complaint, filed in response against the Delon children, was dismissed for the same reasons. However, Rollin&#x27;s lawyer announced that his client planned to file a complaint with a civil party in order to restart the investigations. Anthony Delon, on his part, intended to become a civil party against Rollin so that &quot;the truth is revealed&quot;.

=== Family civil dispute ===
On 4 January 2024, Alain Delon filed a complaint against his son Anthony following an interview granted by the latter to &quot;Paris Match&quot; magazine. Anthony Delon discussed his father&#x27;s fragile health and accused his half-sister Anouchka of manipulating their father regarding the inheritance. In this interview, the eldest revealed that his father was &quot;weakened&quot; and that he &quot;can&#x27;t bear to see himself like this, diminished&quot;. Subsequently, Anthony Delon filed a police report against Anouchka, accusing her of not informing the family about the negative results of five cognitive tests conducted by their father between 2019 and 2022, after he suffered a severe stroke in 2019. Anouchka Delon, on the other hand, accused her brothers of endangering their father&#x27;s life and claimed to have wanted to take their father to Switzerland so he could continue to be treated there. She then announced plans to sue for defamation, false accusations, threats, and harassment against Anthony Delon. Furthermore, Alain Delon&#x27;s lawyer asserted that his client &quot;cannot bear the aggressiveness of his son Anthony, who keeps telling him that he is senile&quot;. On 29 March 2024, Anouchka Delon sued her brothers for invasion of privacy after the broadcast of a recording in January 2024 on Instagram of a conversation between her and her father. Anthony and Alain-Fabien will thus be judged for &quot;use, retention, or disclosure of a document or recording obtained by an invasion of another&#x27;s privacy&quot;. The trial date is set for April 2025. Physically weakened by cancer, Delon was placed under reinforced guardianship by judicial decision in April 2024, following a hearing at the Montargis court, in the presence of the actor&#x27;s three children. This measure follows a period during which Delon had already been placed under guardianship since 25 January, and notably granted the curator appointed by the judge the power to manage his expenses.

=== Other legal troubles ===
In 1969, Delon was convicted in absentia and sentenced to four months in jail by an Italian court for assaulting an Italian photographer.

On 26 February 2024, police raided Delon&#x27;s home where they seized 72 firearms and 3,000 rounds of ammunition. A court-appointed official had been sent to the home of Delon, who was not authorised to own a firearm, and alerted a judge after noticing a weapon in the residence.

== Personal life ==
===Relationships and family===

On 20 March 1959, Delon became engaged to actress Romy Schneider, whom he met when they co-starred in the film &quot;Christine&quot; (1958). After their first film together, the couple became iconic. Schneider, already a highly acclaimed star, and Delon, a rising talent, were affectionately nicknamed &quot;les amants magnifiques&quot; (the magnificent lovers), &quot;les fiancés éternels&quot; (eternal fiancés), and &quot;les amants terribles&quot; (the terrible lovers) due to their passionate and tumultuous relationship, which was the subject of intense media scrutiny, with paparazzi relentlessly pursuing them. Schneider&#x27;s family remained opposed to their union, adding further complexities to their romance. In 1964, Delon and Schneider ended their relationship. Their love story continued to captivate audiences and cemented their status as one of the most beautiful couples in cinema history. In 2009, Delon admitted his regret at not marrying Schneider, and In 2018 he referred to her as the love of his life.

In 1963, Delon met the young divorcée Francine Canovas (birth name), a model known professionally as Nathalie Barthélémy. He was also involved in an affair with Marisa Mell both before and after publicly announcing his engagement to Barthélemy during a press conference. This liaison continued even after his marriage in 1964 and persisted into 1965. On 13 August 1964, he married Barthélemy due to her pregnancy, and thereafter she took the name Nathalie Delon. Their son, Anthony Delon, her second child, was born on 30 September 1964. Nathalie later revealed that Delon&#x27;s love for Romy Schneider remained a constant presence in their relationship, with Delon often displaying a deep sadness indicative that his heart still belonged to Schneider. In 1964-1965, Delon&#x27;s relationships also included affairs with Ann-Margret and Lana Wood. In 1967, Delon filed for divorce. The couple divorced on 14 February 1969.

In August 1968, during the shooting of the film &quot;Jeff&quot; (1969), Delon met the French actress Mireille Darc and asked her to appear with him in a movie. They started a relationship that lasted until 1982. He later had short relationships with the actresses Anne Parillaud, as well as Catherine Bleynie, the ex-wife of Didier Pironi.

In 1987, Delon met the Dutch model on the set of the music video for his song &quot;Comme au cinéma&quot; and started a relationship. They had two children: Anouchka Delon (25 November 1990) and Alain-Fabien Delon (18 March 1994). The relationship ended in 2001.

=== Political opinions ===
Delon described himself as a Gaullist, explaining that he was raised &quot;in the spirit of General de Gaulle&quot;. When de Gaulle resigned from the French presidency after losing a nationwide referendum in 1969, Delon told him in a letter: &quot;Always, and even more in these years thanks to you, I was proud to be French,&quot; then writing about the result: &quot;I feel with fright a sense of shame that breaks my heart.&quot; Delon later supported the center-right candidate Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing in his successful 1974 presidential campaign, and again in his failed attempt to be reelected in 1981. He gave his support to Raymond Barre in 1988 and to Nicolas Sarkozy in 2007. In 2017, he endorsed the Gaullist candidate François Fillon, who came third in the presidential election of that year, but said he did not vote in the second run-off between Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen. He later endorsed Valérie Pécresse in 2022, calling her &quot;the only woman he wants to be president&quot;.

During an interview in 2013, Delon expressed sympathy for the French far-right National Front&#x27;s electoral successes, saying: &quot;The National Front, like the MCG [Geneva Citizens&#x27; Movement] in Geneva, is very important... I encourage it and I perfectly understand it.&quot; However, in another interview in 2018, he denied having ever voted for Marine Le Pen.

Delon was good friends with the Argentine world champion boxer Carlos Monzón, even visiting Monzon during his stint in prison.

In 2022, the 86-year-old Delon was invited by Volodymyr Zelenskyy to travel to Ukraine.

=== Health ===
Delon suffered a stroke in June 2019. He was admitted to hospital after experiencing dizziness and headaches. In August 2019, he was recovering in a Swiss hospital. In September 2022, he began experimental treatment for a slow-progressing lymphoma. In the summer of 2023, Delon&#x27;s three children made the decision to stop this treatment because it was weakening him.

In a 2021 interview with &quot;Paris Match&quot;, Delon expressed support for euthanasia, calling it &quot;the most logical and natural thing&quot;. In 2022, Delon&#x27;s son Anthony revealed in his autobiography &quot;Entre chien et loup&quot; that, following the death of his (Anthony&#x27;s) mother Nathalie, Alain said he wanted to be removed from life support if he were to succumb to a coma, and had asked Anthony to fulfill his request if such a circumstance arose. Shortly thereafter, some news organizations reported that Delon was planning to imminently end his life through euthanasia, but the reports were adamantly denied by his son, Alain-Fabien, who said that quotes from Anthony Delon&#x27;s book had been taken out of context.

In January 2024, Delon was reported to be in poor health and living a reclusive lifestyle at his La Brûlerie estate in Douchy. At the same time, a public feud concerning Delon&#x27;s health arose between three of his children – Anthony, Anouchka and Alain-Fabien – all of whom acknowledge Delon was &quot;ailing but lucid and aware of the feud&quot;. The rift began when Anthony publicly accused Anouchka, his half-sister, of &quot;lying&quot; and &quot;manipulation&quot; for concealing the results of cognitive tests Swiss doctors had performed on their father. The children, however, united in mid-2023 to successfully evict Delon&#x27;s former companion Hiromi Rollin, whom they accused of abusing their father.

=== Death ===
Delon died peacefully on 18 August 2024 at his home in Douchy, surrounded by family members, at the age of 88. He had been diagnosed with B-cell lymphoma earlier in the year. Before his death, Delon requested that his Belgian Shepherd named Loubo be euthanized and buried alongside him, although Delon&#x27;s family elected to not euthanize the dog.

==== Tributes ====
A number of personalities paid tribute to him, including Brigitte Bardot, Claudia Cardinale, Céline Dion, Costa-Gavras, Patricia Kaas (president of the Cinémathèque française), Gilles Jacob, Jean-Michel Jarre, actors Dany Boon, Arielle Dombasle, Pierre Arditi, Jean Dujardin, Richard Berry, and Patrick Chesnais, writer Éric-Emmanuel Schmitt, Mireille Mathieu, and Carla Bruni.

Numerous political figures also honored the actor&#x27;s memory, including Emmanuel Macron, Nicolas Sarkozy, Gabriel Attal, Marine Le Pen, François Fillon, Culture Minister Rachida Dati and Matteo Salvini in Italy. French President Emmanuel Macron described him as &quot;melancholic, popular, secretive&quot; while being &quot;more than a star : a French monument.&quot;

On the evening of his death, several French television channels altered their programming to broadcast films featuring Alain Delon throughout his career. The same occurred in Switzerland, China, Italy, and Iran.

The next day, Alain Delon&#x27;s death made headlines worldwide and garnered significant media attention. Foreign press referred to him as &quot;the last great myth of French cinema.&quot; The New York Times stated, &quot;the intense and intensely beautiful French actor played cold Corsican gangsters as convincingly as passionate Italian lovers.&quot; The Guardian praised Alain Delon, calling him &quot;a symbol of the lost beauty of the 1960s.&quot; According to the Japan Times, &quot;his idol image and James Dean-like persona made him one of the most acclaimed actors in his country.&quot; The series &quot;Plus belle la vie&quot; paid tribute to him in episode 153 on 22 August 2024, referencing the police series &quot;Fabio Montale&quot;, filmed in Marseille.

Having declined any national tribute and ceremony, Alain Delon was buried on 24 August 2024, in a private chapel on the Brûlerie estate in Douchy, as he wished, near his thirty-five dogs. About fifty guests attended the funeral, including the actor&#x27;s three children. The ceremony was officiated by Catholic bishop Jean-Michel Di Falco.

Box office (50 films recorded) detailed for Delon in Spain, where he totals 38 million admissions (760 000 per movies).
== Influences ==
Delon&#x27;s favourite actor was John Garfield. He also admired Jean Marais, Montgomery Clift, Marlon Brando and Robert Walker.

== Influence and legacy ==
=== Reception ===
Alain Delon is one of the best-known French actors abroad, alongside Gérard Depardieu, Jean Reno, Catherine Deneuve, and Audrey Tautou. Jean-Michel Frodon, a film critic and historian, points out that in post-war French cinema, Delon is a unique figure, whose energy and intelligence on screen were superbly exploited by filmmakers such as Jean-Pierre Melville. According to Nick Rees-Roberts and Darren Waldron, &quot;Few male European actors have been as iconic and influential for generations of filmgoers as Alain Delon.&quot; They consider his status as a cinema icon and the longevity of his career as making a scholarly inquiry into his image and persona necessary. LaCinetek and The Criterion Collection have unveiled several lists wherein various professionals in the field recommend and/or specify their favorite films. Several of the productions in which Delon plays the leading role are cited.

Leonardo DiCaprio regards Alain Delon as one of the &quot;coolest actors in the history of cinema&quot;. The Canadian actor Keanu Reeves asserts that Delon is his role model as an actor: &quot;He&#x27;s such a charismatic actor. I think he has something in him between tension and melancholy.&quot; British director Matthew Vaughn compares actor Michael Caine to Alain Delon, suggesting the unique cinematic influence of these two actors in their respective countries. British actor Clive Owen says he is fascinated by Alain Delon&#x27;s &quot;natural grace&quot;, considering &quot;Le Samouraï&quot; and &quot;La Piscine&quot; among his favorite films. Joseph Losey, an American director, expressed his admiration for Alain Delon, saying, &quot;Alain is one of those rare talents who can be honored as being difficult. To me, this word means professionalism, demand, dedication to work, warmth, and love. He&#x27;s not a man to play with, but a man you can rely on.&quot; American producer Robert Evans paid tribute to Delon in his memoirs &quot;The Kid Stays in the Picture – Hyperion Books&quot;, 1994, considering him as his &quot;brother in life as in cinema&quot; and &quot;the most beautiful actor in Europe&quot;.

=== Cinematic influence ===
Alain Delon&#x27;s interpretations have influenced many colleagues, both in France and internationally, especially thanks to his role in &quot;Le Samouraï&quot; (&quot;The Samurai&quot;), often cited as one of the most influential films in history. Director Jean-Pierre Melville wrote the film for Alain Delon and describes the genesis of this film:

Director Bertrand Blier speculates that the meeting between Alain Delon and the filmmaker Jean-Pierre Melville, &quot;historic, charged with a mutual fascination&quot;, was at the origin of the success of this classic: &quot;&quot;The Samurai&quot; was a completely bizarre film. There has only been one film made like this in France. And it&#x27;s so much like Delon, this film: a mute, completely narcissistic role, where practically nothing happens. Delon sits in front of a mirror for an hour correcting the position of his hat! It had a lot of charm, it was a fascinating film. It was an extraordinary analysis of these two men, a formidable joint portrait of Melville / Delon&quot;.

Stephen Teo calls &quot;Le Samouraï&quot; &quot;possibly the most influential French crime thriller ever made, a mixture of a police procedural (&quot;le film policier&quot;) and a suspenseful action thriller concentrated on a professional hit man, Jef (spelled with one &quot;f&quot;) Costello, played by Alain Delon, giving the definitive performance of his career&quot;.

Delon and Melville crystallize a film cited as one of the most influential in history, which will become an essential reference for many filmmakers. Martin Scorsese (&quot;Taxi Driver&quot; and &quot;Raging Bull&quot;), Quentin Tarantino (&quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; and &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;), Jim Jarmusch, Michael Mann (&quot;Collateral, Heat&quot; and &quot;The Limits of Control&quot;), John Woo, Johnnie To (&quot;Fulltime Killer&quot;), David Fincher (&quot;The Killer&quot;), Takeshi Kitano, Nicolas Winding Refn, Luc Besson (&quot;Léon: The Professional&quot;), Joel Coen and Ethan Coen, Anton Corbijn (&quot;The American&quot;), Antoine Fuqua (&quot;The Equalizer&quot;), Chad Stahelski (&quot;John Wick&quot; franchise) have all taken the motifs from this feature film, while adapting it to their respective directing styles.

Many New Hollywood films and critical successes such as William Friedkin&#x27;s &quot;The French Connection&quot; (1971) and Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s &quot;The Conversation&quot; (1974) contain explicit references to &quot;Le Samouraï&quot; and the character of Jef Costello played by Delon.

At the same time, many actors were inspired by Alain Delon&#x27;s performances. Antonio Banderas (&quot;The Skin I Live In&quot;) by Pedro Almodóvar), Gael García Bernal (&quot;Bad Education&quot; by Pedro Almodóvar&quot;)&quot;, Tom Cruise (&quot;Collateral&quot; by Michael Mann&quot;),&quot; Michael Fassbender (&quot;The Killer&quot; by David Fincher&quot;)&quot;, Tony Leung (&quot;Hard Boiled&quot; by John Woo), Richard Gere (&quot;American Gigolo&quot; by Paul Schrader), Ryan Gosling (&quot;Drive&quot; by Nicolas Winding Refn), Keanu Reeves (&quot;John Wick&quot; by Chad Stahelski), Forest Whitaker (Jim Jarmusch&#x27;s &quot;Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai&quot; and &quot;Two Men in Town&quot;), and Chow Yun-Fat &quot;(The Killer&quot; by John Woo) have all been inspired by Alain Delon and his performances to create and refine interpretations that are often reminiscent of those of the French actor.

==== Others ====
In &quot;Rocco and His Brothers&quot;, Delon plays the character of Rocco Parondi, a tormented young man, a street wrestler who has become famous and has a tumultuous career in an Italian family in the 1940s. The film influenced a number of filmmakers, including Martin Scorsese, who closely studied Visconti&#x27;s directing, especially the way the fight scenes are filmed, a technique he later integrated into his &quot;Raging Bull&quot;. In addition, Scorsese was inspired for this same film by the character of Rocco (Delon) to help shape Robert De Niro&#x27;s interpretation of Jake LaMotta.

Rocco Siffredi chose his stage name in reference to the characters Roch Siffredi (&quot;Borsalino&quot; and &quot;Borsalino &amp; Co&quot;) and Rocco Parondi (&quot;Rocco and his brothers&quot;), both played by Alain Delon. Hong Kong actor Ti Lung chose his stage name from a verbal derivation close to the name of his favorite actor Alain Delon.

&quot;Borsalino,&quot; a film released in 1969, tells the adventures of Roch Siffredi and François Cappella, two gangsters in Marseille in the 1930s. Played by Alain Delon and Jean-Paul Belmondo, &quot;Borsalino&quot; marks their only collaboration. This tandem, made up of two of the most popular French actors, inspired Robert Redford and Paul Newman to stage &quot;The Sting&quot; in 1973.

Ilaria Urbinati, stylist for Ryan Reynolds, Bradley Cooper, and Donald Glover among others, counts Alain Delon as one of the style icons who inspire her: &quot;Alain Delon, a young Pacino and a young DeNiro are my all-time style icons. And probably Paul Newman at all ages. They&#x27;ll keep you right.&quot;

Playwright Adrienne Kennedy was an admirer of Delon. A mystery novella by Kennedy, &quot;Deadly Triplets&quot; featured a fictional version of Kennedy who has written a play titled, &quot;The Heart Of Alain Delon&quot;.

=== International recognition ===

During the four years Delon lived with Romy Schneider, he became a leading man in movie roles, and an international sex symbol. According to media commentator Mark Gallagher, Delon&#x27;s reputation ultimately may be as a worldwide style icon, rather than as an actor. He writes that Delon&#x27;s on-screen sex appeal is well received in many cultural contexts, that it allowed him to transcend strictly French film and culture, and connected him to &quot;international film culture and popular culture&quot;.

Delon was offered roles in several iconic productions, thus illustrating the international recognition bestowed upon him. For instance, he was invited by Sam Spiegel (the film&#x27;s producer) to portray Sherif Ali in &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;. Despite a successful audition, difficulties related to wearing brown contact lenses for the role led the French actor to decline the offer. Robert Evans also considered Alain Delon for the role of Michael Corleone in &quot;The Godfather&quot;, stating, &quot;That&#x27;s how he was described in the book.&quot; Delon, however, refused the proposal. In 1973, director and screenwriter Alejandro Jodorowsky embarked on the cinematic adaptation of &quot;Dune&quot;. Jodorowsky assembled a prestigious artistic team, including rock bands Pink Floyd and Magma for the music. Jodorowsky also envisioned an ambitious cast: Salvador Dalí, Orson Welles, and Mick Jagger among others. Alain Delon was slated to portray the character of Duncan Idaho. However, anticipating a 14-hour film, the project was abandoned due to significant financial constraints (Dalí notably demanding $100,000 per hour). Alain Delon was among Anne Rice&#x27;s top choices for the role of Louis, as depicted in her book &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot;, which was under discussion for a film adaptation. However, the project didn&#x27;t come to fruition until 1994, with Brad Pitt ultimately taking on the role.

According to the American Film Institute, Delon was considered for roles in Joshua Logan&#x27;s &quot;Fanny&quot; (1961), Tony Richardson&#x27;s &quot;The Loved One&quot; (1965), Sydney Pollack&#x27;s &quot;This Property Is Condemned&quot; (1966), Henri Verneuil&#x27;s &quot;The Scavengers&quot; (1968), &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; (1976) by Martin Scorsese, and John Huston&#x27;s &quot;Escape to Victory&quot; (1981).

Among the projects turned down by Alain Delon are Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot; and Bernardo Bertolucci&#x27;s &quot;Last Tango in Paris&quot;. Additionally, in 1979, Albert Broccoli, in charge of the James Bond franchise, offered Delon the role of James Bond. Delon refused to succeed Sean Connery and thus declined the offer. Initially considered for the role of Louis XV in the American film &quot;Marie-Antoinette&quot;, Alain Delon declined Sofia Coppola&#x27;s offer, arguing his refusal to wear a wig to play the role.

=== Musical influence ===
A still shot of Delon in &quot;The Unvanquished&quot; appears on the cover of the 1986 album &quot;The Queen Is Dead&quot; by The Smiths, which was used with his written approval. The song &quot;Beautiful Killer&quot; on Madonna&#x27;s twelfth studio album &quot;MDNA&quot; is a tribute to Delon. An early EP by the music group White Town was the &quot;Alain Delon EP&quot;. The song &quot;A Look From The Screen&quot; by Russian band Nautilus Pompilius is a tribute to Delon. In 2010, Emma Daumas paid tribute to Alain Delon in the song &quot;Dans les yeux d&#x27;Alain Delon&quot;, on her E.P. &quot;Acoustic&quot;. Far from this chorus of praise, Marianne Faithfull, a friend of Nico&#x27;s and who was Delon&#x27;s partner in the cinema in the 1960s, mentions the actor on her album &quot;Kissin&#x27; Time&quot;. The Italian music group Baustelle (&quot;La canzione di Alain Delon&quot;), the Bulgarian music group Shturtzite (&quot;Alen Delon)&quot;, Christoff de Bolle (&quot;Ich hab Alain Delon gesehn)&quot;, Erlend Krauser &quot;(Deneuve Meets Alain Delon in The Train&quot;), Davide Van De Sfroos (&quot;L&#x27;Alain Delon de Lenn&quot;), Dann Stuyven (&quot;Dîner Delon&quot;), Sıla Gençoğlu and Ozan Doğulu (&quot;Alain Delon&quot;) and Femme Schmidt (&quot;Alain Delon&quot;) have all quoted and/or paid tribute to Alain Delon in their musical productions.

=== Cultural and popular representations ===

==== In visual art ====
The manga and anime series &quot;Beelzebub&quot; feature an extensive cast of fictional characters created by Ryūhei Tamura. One of the key characters is &quot;Batim do Emuna Alaindelon&quot;, a demon. The character mentioned is directly inspired by Freddie Mercury and is named after Alain Delon.

The Italian comic strip &quot;Playcolt&quot; (128 issues divided into four series from 1972 to 1979) features Alain Velon (Paronomase of the actor Alain Delon), a billionaire playboy with a Delonian physique who later transforms into &quot;Playcolt&quot;, a kind of superhero.

Monkey Punch is inspired by several French films and actors to create the relationships between his characters in his manga &quot;Lupin III&quot;. The Alain Delon-Charles Bronson duo in &quot;Adieu l&#x27;ami&quot; influences the interactions between Lupin and his accomplice Daisuke Jigen.

Alain Delon&#x27;s influence in &quot;Le Samouraï&quot; can also be felt in the comic strip &quot;Corps et Âme&quot; by Jef and Matz. In &quot;Body and Soul&quot;, the main character is Frank Kitchen, a fearsome and methodical hitman. The resemblance to Costello (played by Delon in &quot;Le Samuraï&quot;) is reflected not only in the character&#x27;s physical appearance, but also in his behavior and stoic attitude in the face of adversity. As in &quot;The Samurai&quot;, where Delon&#x27;s character is betrayed and must navigate a series of unforeseen challenges, Frank Kitchen finds himself in a new situation after an extreme revenge that transforms him physically.

&quot;Lost Bullets&quot;, a comic book written by Walter Hill, features protagonist Roy Nash about a professional killer who has received a life sentence in the Joliet prison in Illinois. Jef, the cartoonist, says that he chose to be inspired by the French actor to create Roy Nash&#x27;s appearance because he appreciates Delon and his films.

Michaël Sanlaville, an award-winning cartoonist in Angoulême in 2015 for &quot;Lastman&quot;, found his inspiration in the works of Frédéric Dard from a very young age. Having discovered the novels of &quot;San Antonio&quot; in his parents&#x27; attic, he decided to adapt these works into comic books. To embody San-Antonio, Sanlaville chose to base himself on the image of Alain Delon. His sculptural face and piercing gaze perfectly embody the handsome, irreproachable and hieratic hero described by Dard.

A significant part of the work of Russian artist and academician Nikas Stepanovich Safronov focuses on his series titled &quot;River of Time&quot;, where he portrays various modern personalities, whether famous politicians, actors, or pop music stars. Among those depicted are Alla Pugacheva, Sophia Loren, Pierre Cardin, Elton John, and Alain Delon. These paintings have been acquired by collectors at major national and international exhibitions, and most of them are now displayed in private collections and renowned museums in Russia and Europe.

==== Others ====
Guillaume Delorme played Alain Delon in 2009 in a German TV movie, &quot;Romy&quot;, directed by Torsten C. Fisher and retracing his love story with Romy Schneider. Alain Delon is the main subject of a play inspired by his career and the world of Jean-Pierre Melville, &quot;Alain Delon or almost&quot;, of Stéphane Dolivet. The play was premiered in July 2007 at the Avignon Festival. It was revived in a new version in 2010, &quot;Alain Delon... and me&quot;.

Alain Delon&#x27;s puppet in Les Guignols de l&#x27;info expresses himself in a grandiloquent way, speaking of himself in the third person.

Bulgarian poet Georgi Konstantinov wrote a humorous poem called Момичето със син балон (The Girl with the Blue Balloon) which was adapted by the popular Bulgarian rock band Shturtsite as lyrics for their 1982 hit called Ален Делон (Alain Delon). In it the actor was compared to a balloon which will burst in the end.

<text>Servilia ( 100 BC – after 42 BC) was a Roman matron from a distinguished family, the Servilii Caepiones. She was the daughter of Quintus Servilius Caepio and Livia, thus the maternal half-sister of Cato the Younger. She married Marcus Junius Brutus, with whom she had a son, the Brutus who, along with others in the Senate, assassinated Julius Caesar. After her first husband&#x27;s death in 77 BC, she married Decimus Junius Silanus, and with him had a son and three daughters.

She gained fame as the mistress of Julius Caesar, whom her son Brutus and son-in-law Gaius Cassius Longinus would assassinate in 44 BC. Her affair with Caesar seems to have been publicly known in Rome at the time. Plutarch stated that she in turn was madly in love with Caesar. The relationship between the two probably started in 59 BC, after the death of Servilia&#x27;s second husband although Plutarch implied it began when they were teenagers.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Servilia was a patrician who could trace her line back to Gaius Servilius Ahala, and was the of Livia and Quintus Servilius Caepio. Her parents had two other children, a younger Servilia and a Gnaeus Servilius Caepio; her father also likely had another son named Quintus Servilius Caepio from an earlier marriage. They divorced when she was three or four, and her mother then married Marcus Porcius Cato. From this union, Servilia&#x27;s half-brother, Cato the Younger, and half-sister, Porcia, were born.

However, her mother and stepfather both died before 91 BC. As a result, Servilia, her younger siblings, and her half-siblings were all brought up in the house of their maternal uncle, Marcus Livius Drusus. He was assassinated during his tribunate in 91 BC, in his own atrium, when Servilia was nine. Her father was ambushed and killed in the immediately ensuing Social War, a war triggered by Drusus&#x27; assassination, mere months after her uncle&#x27;s murder. After this she was probably brought up either by her other maternal uncle Mamercus Aemilius Lepidus Livianus, her maternal grandmother Cornelia or her paternal aunt Servilia. At adulthood, Servilia became legally independent and gained a considerable estate.

Servilia truly had great influence on her half-brother Cato the Younger. He was considered to be tough and wild as a child, which frames Servilia as his equal in those respects.

As a young girl belonging to Roman ruling class, Servilia would have been well educated. She likely would have been taught to read, write, sing, dance, and play an instrument. She would have read poetry, epics, and histories.

===Marriages and children===

At the age of 13 or 14, she married Marcus Junius Brutus in the early 80s, who later was tribune of the plebs (83 BC) and founder of a colony at Capua. They had one child, the future tyrannicide Marcus Junius Brutus, born around 85 BC. This was a profitable marriage for Brutus, who would gain fortune, stability, and political traction through Servilia. Although the elder Brutus survived Sulla&#x27;s proscriptions, he was treacherously killed by Pompey after surrendering at Mutina in 77 BC. After the death of the elder Brutus, Servilia&#x27;s bond with her son grew. She also arranged for her son to be adopted into her family, allowing for the name of the Servilii Caepiones to be preserved.

Servilia subsequently married Decimus Junius Silanus, by whom she had three daughters. Her daughters were all married into prominent and politically active families, Her first daughter married Publius Servilius Vatia Isauricus; her second married Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (later triumvir); and her third daughter married Gaius Cassius Longinus. Servilia was well connected and facilitated these advantageous marriages herself.

It is speculated that either soon after she married Silanus, or after the births of her daughters, Servilia&#x27;s notorious affair with Caesar began. Silanus is not depicted to have been against the affair. Servilia did not remarry after the death of Silanus around 59 BC, and remained unmarried for the rest of her life. She was able to live independently as a widow, owning various estates due to inheritances from various wealthy relatives.

===Relationship with Caesar===

Caesar had numerous affairs with women married and unmarried, but none lasted as long, nor were they as passionate as his affair with Servilia. An intimate relationship between the two probably started in 59, after the death of Servilia&#x27;s second husband. The affair was well known and Servilia suffered no damage to her reputation because of this relationship. Unlike most other aristocratic affairs, this one seemed also to have lasted over many years.

The relationship broadly is first recorded in extant sources in 63, when Servilia apparently was caught sneaking a love note to Caesar in the senate by her brother Cato. Cato was greatly displeased to find out about Caesar&#x27;s correspondence with his half-sister. Modern scholars have made use of this incident to indicate the passion between Servilia and Caesar, noting that Servilia maintained long-distance contact while Caesar was away. as both Cato and Brutus espoused the side of Pompey, despite the latter&#x27;s role in the death of her former husband.

Plutarch only emphasized Servilia&#x27;s devotion for Caesar, claiming that she was madly in love with him, but it is widely accepted that Caesar held a deep affection for Servilia. Scholars speculate that it was Caesar&#x27;s affections which allowed the affair to continue for as long as it did. During his consulship in 59, Caesar supposedly presented Servilia with an outrageously expensive pearl worth some six million sesterces.

Another popular rumor was that Servilia was prostituting her daughter Tertia to Caesar in 47 BC. At an estate auction where Caesar received several properties at a low rate to give to Servilia, Cicero remarked, &quot;It&#x27;s a better bargain than you think, for there is a third (&quot;tertia&quot;) off.&quot; Some ancient sources refer to the possibility of Caesar being Brutus&#x27; real father, despite Caesar being only fifteen years old when Brutus was born. Ancient historians were sceptical of this possibility and &quot;on the whole, scholars have rejected the possibility that Brutus was the love-child of Servilia and Caesar on the grounds of chronology&quot;. Perhaps out of a desire to avoid offending Servilia, Caesar gave orders that Brutus should not be harmed if encountered after the Pompeian defeat at Pharsalus.

When her son – Marcus Junius Brutus – divorced his wife Claudia to marry Cato&#x27;s daughter Porcia in 45, she disapproved, having been instrumental in arranging the match and also disagreeing with the anti-Caesarian stance taken by her half-brother Cato. Servilia may also have been jealous of the affection that Brutus showed his new bride. Later that year, Caesar appointed her son urban praetor for 44.

=== After Caesar&#x27;s death ===
After Caesar&#x27;s assassination by a conspiracy which included Servilia&#x27;s son – Brutus – and son-in-law – Gaius Cassius Longinus – on the Ides of March of 44 BC, . It is unlikely she knew anything of the conspiracy, having been on good terms with Caesar until his death; regardless, she worked to protect her relatives from the ensuing political storm. Apart from Servilia, the only women in attendance were Porcia and Junia Tertia.

Servilia worked extensively in 44 BC to ensure the safety of her family both by , and by contributing greatly to the discourses during their meetings. Cicero&#x27;s letters detail other meetings of the senate that Servilia had called to discuss what actions should be taken which would protect her son and sons-in-law. Cicero described her as a &#x27;nervous lady&#x27;, which could be understood as politically cautious.

Servilia&#x27;s opinions were often held in higher esteem than those of Cicero during meetings of the &quot;liberatores&quot;. Due to women being unable to hold office or vote, Servilia focused her political efforts on strategic marriages for her daughters and helping create her political career for her son Brutus.

Due to life-threatening unrest in the city, her son Brutus was able to get a special dispensation to leave the capital for more than 10 days, and he withdrew to one of his estates in Lanuvium, 20 miles south-east of Rome. By mid-May, Antony proposed reassigning Brutus and Cassius from their provinces to instead purchase grain in Asia and Sicily. There was a meeting at Brutus&#x27; house attended by Cicero, Brutus and Cassius (and wives), and Brutus&#x27; mother, in which Cassius announced his intention to go to Syria while Brutus wanted to return to Rome, but ended up going to Greece. His initial plan to go to Rome, however, was to put on games in early July commemorating his ancestor Lucius Junius Brutus and promoting his cause; he instead delegated the games to a friend. Servilia assisted in organising Brutus&#x27; games, in charge of decisions concerning the ceremony, finances, and senatorial contacts. Antony&#x27;s proposed reassignment also was dropped by the senate; Cicero claims that it was because of some action by Servilia.

Servilia led a council meeting in July 43 to discuss the possible return of Brutus and Cassius from exile, which serves as the most explicit depiction of a woman overseeing a meeting in this period.

=== Later life ===
Despite her connections with the conspirators, Servilia escaped the purges of the second triumvirate unscathed due to the protection of her long-time friend Titus Pomponius Atticus. After Brutus&#x27; death, her son&#x27;s ashes were sent to her by Antony from Philippi.

Very little is known about Servilia&#x27;s life after the death of Brutus. She is suspected to have died a natural death between 27 and 23 BC. Her youngest daughter, Junia Tertia, out-lived Augustus and was noticed by Tacitus to have had a splendid funeral which kept the memory of Brutus and Cassius alive.

==Cultural depictions==
===Literature===
Servilia is the subject of a poem by John Dryden. A fictionalized Servilia appears in the &quot;Emperor&quot; series of novels by Conn Iggulden, who has portrayed her as a courtesan. Servilia is a character in Colleen McCullough&#x27;s &quot;Masters of Rome&quot; series.

===Television and film===
A fictionalised version of Servilia was among the principal characters in the 2005 HBO television series &quot;Rome&quot;, played by Lindsay Duncan. The Servilia of HBO&#x27;s Rome was depicted as instigating actor in the plot against Caesar&#x27;s life; there is no historical evidence thereof. A similarly fictionalised Servilia makes an appearance in the 2005 six-part mini series &quot;Empire&quot;, played by Trudie Styler. Natalie Medlock portrays Servilia in the 2018 Netflix television docudrama series &quot;Roman Empire&quot;.

<text>Cornelia Metella ( 73 BC – after 48 BC) was the daughter of Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius Scipio Nasica (who was consul in 52 BC and originally from the gens Cornelia) and his wife Aemilia. She appears in numerous literary sources, including an official dedicatory inscription at Pergamon.

==Biography==

Cornelia was first married to Publius Licinius Crassus, son of Marcus Licinius Crassus, in 55 BC, when he was in Rome between service with Julius Caesar in Gaul and his father in Syria. After the younger Crassus&#x27; death at the Battle of Carrhae, Cornelia became the fifth wife of the significantly older Pompey in 52 BC. 

At the start of the civil war between Pompey and Caesar, Cornelia and Pompey&#x27;s son Sextus Pompey were sent to the Aegean Lesbos. During her stay there, a statue was erected in Pergamum in her honour for services to that city. After Pompey&#x27;s defeat at Pharsalus in 48 BC, she rejoined Pompey in August at Mytilene and went with him on his ill-fated flight to Ptolemaic Egypt. Landing on the shore, Pompey was murdered with Cornelia watching from the ship. After Pompey&#x27;s death, she fled to Cyprus with Sextus and afterwards returned to Italy with Caesar&#x27;s permission to bury Pompey&#x27;s ashes on his Alban estate. 

Plutarch described her as a beautiful woman of good character, well read, and a skilled player of the lyre. She was also very well educated in geometry and philosophy.

==Cultural references==

Cornelia Metella is a focus of Lucan&#x27;s &quot;Civil War&quot;, which treats her as Pompey&#x27;s partner in war and travel.

Cornelia appears in George Frideric Handel&#x27;s 1724 opera &quot;Giulio Cesare in Egitto&quot; (&quot;Julius Caesar in Egypt&quot;), where she pleads with Caesar to spare her husband; he is about to grant her plea, but Pompey was already killed by the Egyptians. She is the title and main character in Robert Garnier&#x27;s play &quot;Cornélie&quot; and its English language adaptation &quot;Cornelia&quot; by Thomas Kyd.

In the first season of the TV series &quot;Rome&quot;, broadcast in 2005, Cornelia is portrayed by actress Anna Patrick. Unlike the historic Cornelia, this portrayal sees her as middle aged, and as having two children probably from her first marriage, not with Pompey.

<text>Curd Gustav Andreas Gottlieb Franz Jürgens (13 December 191518 June 1982) was a German-Austrian stage and film actor. He was usually billed in English-speaking films as Curt Jurgens. He was well known for playing Ernst Udet in &quot;Des Teufels General&quot;. His English-language roles include &quot;James Bond&quot; villain Karl Stromberg in &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot; (1977), Éric Carradine in &quot;And God Created Woman&quot; (1956), and Professor Immanuel Rath in &quot;The Blue Angel&quot; (1959).

==Early life==
Jürgens was born on 13 December 1915 in the Munich borough of Solln, Kingdom of Bavaria, German Empire. His father, Kurt, was a trader from Hamburg, and his mother, Marie-Albertine, was a French teacher. He had two elder twin sisters, Jeanette and Marguerite. He began his working career as a journalist before becoming an actor at the urging of his actress wife, Louise Basler. He spent much of his early acting career on the stage in Vienna. Due to serious injuries that he sustained in a car accident in the summer of 1933, he was unable to have children.

==Early films==
Jurgens made his film debut in &quot;The Royal Waltz&quot; (1935) playing Franz Joseph I of Austria. He was in the comedy &quot;Family Parade&quot; (1935) and had a small part in &quot;The Unknown&quot; (1936), &quot;Love Can Lie&quot; (1937) and &quot;Tango Notturno&quot; (1937).

===World War Two===
During the war, Jurgens appeared in &quot;Operetta&quot; (1940) (playing Carl Millöcker), &quot;Whom the Gods Love&quot; (1942) (as Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor), and &quot;Women Are No Angels&quot; (1943).

Jürgens was critical of Nazism in his native Germany. In 1944, after filming &quot;Wiener Mädeln&quot;, he got into an argument with Robert Kaltenbrunner (brother of high-ranking Austrian SS official Ernst Kaltenbrunner), SS-Obersturmbannführer Otto Skorzeny and a member of Baldur von Schirach&#x27;s staff in a Viennese bar without knowing who they were. After this event, Jürgens was sent to a labor camp for the &quot;politically unreliable&quot; in Hungary. After a few weeks he managed to escape and went into hiding. Jürgens became an Austrian citizen after the war.

==Post-war career==
After the war Jurgens appeared in &quot;The Singing House&quot; (1948) and &quot;The Angel with the Trumpet&quot; (1948). He had a romantic lead in &quot;On Resonant Shores&quot; (1948) and was in &quot;The Heavenly Waltz&quot; (1948), &quot;Lambert Feels Threatened&quot; (1949), and &quot;Bonus on Death&quot; (1950).

Jurgens was now regularly in starring roles: &quot;Der Schuß durchs Fenster&quot; (1950), &quot;Kissing Is No Sin&quot; (1950), &quot;The Disturbed Wedding Night&quot; (1950), and &quot;A Rare Lover&quot; (1950). He had a support role in &quot;House of Life&quot; (1952), &quot;1. April 2000&quot; (1952), &quot;Rose of the Mountain&quot; (1952), &quot;They Call It Love&quot; (1953), and &quot;Music by Night&quot; (1953). Jurgens was in an operetta, &quot;The Last Waltz&quot; (1953) with Eva Bartok, whom he married. He starred in &quot;Everything for Father&quot; (1954), and &quot;A Woman of Today&quot; (1954). Another movie with Bartok, &quot;Circus of Love&quot; (1954) was a co production with a US company. After &quot;Prisoners of Love&quot; (1954) he did another co production, &quot;Orient Express&quot; (1954) and then was in &quot;The Confession of Ina Kahr&quot; (1955).

===International star===
Jurgens&#x27; breakthrough screen role was in &quot;Des Teufels General&quot; (1955, &quot;The Devil&#x27;s General&quot;) a fictional portrayal of World War I flying ace and World War II Luftwaffe general Ernst Udet. He was then in &quot;Love Without Illusions&quot; (1955) and &quot;Die Ratten&quot; (1955), directed by Robert Siodmak and starring Maria Schell. &quot;The Heroes Are Tired&quot; (1955) was a co production with France co starring Yves Montand. &quot;Devil in Silk&quot; (1956) co starred Lili Palmer.

Jurgens made &quot;The Golden Bridge&quot; (1956) then &quot;Without You All Is Darkness&quot; (1956) with Bartok. He had a lead part Roger Vadim&#x27;s film &quot;Et Dieu... créa la femme&quot; (&quot;And God Created Woman&quot;) starring Brigitte Bardot, which was a huge box office success internationally. After an Italian movie &quot;The House of Intrigue&quot; (1956) Jurgens played the title role in &quot;Michel Strogoff&quot; (1956) which was another big hit, the most popular film of the year in France.

Jurgens was now an international film star. He did &quot;Bitter Victory&quot; (1957) with Richard Burton and director Nicholas Ray, &quot;Les Espions&quot; (1957) for Henri-Georges Clouzot then appeared in his first Hollywood film, &quot;The Enemy Below&quot; (1957), in which he portrayed a German U-boat commander. Michael Powell wanted Jurgens to play Heinrich Kreipe in &quot;Ill Met By Moonlight&quot; (1957) but the Rank Organisation would not pay his fee.

Jurgens starred in a French film, &quot;Tamango&quot; (1958), opposite Dorothy Dandridge with whom he had an affair. Jurgens went to Hollywood to appear in &quot;This Happy Feeling&quot; (1958) for Blake Edwards, &quot;Me and the Colonel&quot; (1958) with Danny Kaye and &quot;The Inn of the Sixth Happiness&quot; (1958) with Ingrid Bergman, which was very popular. An item in &quot;Variety&quot; in April 1958 said he was &quot;well on the way to becoming another middleaged matinee idol in the Ezio Pinza tradition saying he&#x27;d &quot;appeared in 89 pictures and an equal number of plays. In 1957 he starred in seven films, four made in France in English, French and German versions and three produced on the coast.&quot;

In Germany Jurgens was in &quot;Der Schinderhannes&quot; (1958) then for Rank, and he co-starred opposite Orson Welles in &quot;Ferry to Hong Kong&quot; (1959), which was a huge box office flop in England and America. In Hollywood he starred in the remake of &quot;The Blue Angel&quot; (1959) opposite May Britt. He made &quot;Magnificent Sinner&quot; (1959) with Romy Schneider. In June 1959 Jurgens said he wanted to mix Hollywood films with non-Hollywood films so world producers did not forget him. &quot;Variety&quot; called him &quot;the most active international star in the world today&quot;.

Jurgens starred in &quot;I Aim at the Stars&quot; (1960). While promoting the latter he announced he had formed his own company Cinestar and would no longer make German films now that producers had set a maximum fee of $25,000.

He did &quot;Brainwashed&quot; (1960), a Rank film shot in Germany, then &quot;Gustav Adolf&#x27;s Page&quot; (1960) and &quot;Bankraub in der Rue Latour&quot; (1961), which he also directed.

Jurgens appeared in a sequel to his earlier hit, &quot;The Triumph of Michael Strogoff&quot; (1962) and was in &quot;Disorder&quot; (1962) with Louis Jourdan. He played the German general Günther Blumentritt in &quot;The Longest Day&quot; (1962).

Jurgens starred in &quot;Don Giovanni della Costa Azzurra&quot; (1962) and made &quot;Miracle of the White Stallions&quot; (1962) for Disney, &quot;Of Love and Desire&quot; (1963) for Fox, and &quot;Nutty, Naughty Chateau&quot; (1963) for Vadim. In England Jurgens appeared in &quot;Hide and Seek&quot; (1964) then made &quot;Encounter in Salzburg&quot; (1964), &quot;Les Parias de la gloire&quot; (1964), the British &quot;Psyche 59&quot; (1964) and &quot;Lord Jim&quot; (1965).

==Later career==
Jurgens began to move down the cast list in &quot;Who Wants to Sleep?&quot; (1966), &quot;Target for Killing&quot; (1966), &quot;The Gardener of Argenteuil&quot; (1966), &quot;Dirty Heroes&quot; (1967), &quot;The Karate Killers&quot; (1967), and &quot;OSS 117 – Double Agent&quot; (1968). He had a lead in &quot;The Doctor of St. Pauli&quot; (1968) and supported in &quot;The Assassination Bureau&quot; (1969), &quot;Battle of the Commandos&quot; (1969), &quot;On the Reeperbahn at Half Past Midnight&quot; (1969), &quot;Battle of Britain&quot; (1969), &quot;Battle of Neretva&quot; (1970).

Later, in the James Bond film &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot; (1977), he played the villain Karl Stromberg, a sociopathic industrialist seeking to transform the world into an ocean paradise. His last film appearance was as Maître Legraine, beside Alain Delon and Claude Jade in the spy-thriller &quot;Teheran 43&quot; (1981). In English-language television, he played Chancellor Otto von Bismarck in several episodes of the BBC series &quot;Fall of Eagles&quot; (1974) and appeared as General Vladimir in the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Smiley&#x27;s People&quot; (1982).

==Theatre==
Although he appeared in over 100 films, Jürgens was also a notable stage actor. He was member of several theatres in Vienna (Volkstheater 1938–1941, Burgtheater 1940–1953 and 1965–1968, and others). He played the title role of Hugo von Hofmannsthal&#x27;s play &quot;Jedermann&quot; at the Salzburg Festival from 1973 until 1977 – arguably the most high-profile role for a German-speaking male actor. In 1966 he appeared in a short run on Broadway at the Eugene O&#x27;Neill Theatre opposite Geraldine Page, directed by George Schaefer.

His last stage appearance was with the Vienna State Opera on 9 March 1981 as Bassa Selim in Mozart&#x27;s opera &quot;Die Entführung aus dem Serail&quot;. He also directed a few films with limited success, e.g. &quot;Bankraub in der Rue Latour&quot;, and wrote screenplays, e.g. &quot;Bonus on Death&quot;.

He titled his 1976 memoir &quot;... und kein bißchen weise&quot; (&quot;And Not At All Wise&quot;).

Jürgens provided the German voice of the journalist in the 1980 German dub of Jeff Wayne&#x27;s &quot;Musical Version of the War of the Worlds&quot;.

==Personal life==
Jürgens maintained a home in France, but he frequently returned to Vienna to perform on stage. He had suffered a heart attack several years before. During this heart attack he had a near-death experience where he claimed he died and went to hell. 

He was tall. Brigitte Bardot nicknamed him &quot;the Norman Wardrobe&quot; during their work for &quot;Et Dieu... créa la femme&quot;.

At some point Jürgens had affairs with actresses Romy Schneider (in 1957) and Dorothy Dandridge. After a two-year affair, his relationship with his young lover Mathilda Mizart ended in 1974 when she died in an accident. Marlene Knaus married F1-Champion Niki Lauda in 1976.

Jürgens was married to:
# Lulu Basler, actress (15 June 1937 – 8 October 1947) (divorced)
# Judith Holzmeister (16 October 1947 – 1955) (divorced)
# Eva Bartok (13 August 1955 – 1956) (divorced)
# Simone Bicheron (14 September 1958 – 1977) (divorced)
# Margie Schmitz (21 March 1978 – 18 June 1982) (his death)

=== Death ===

Jürgens died on 18 June 1982 of multiple organ failure at the Rudolfstiftung hospital in Vienna at the age of 66, before the German version of the thriller film &quot;Teheran 43&quot; was completed. His role as dubbing voice had to be replaced by Wilhelm Borchert.

His burial was in the Vienna Central Cemetery in a grave of honor (Group 32C No. 54). It took place on 22 June 1982, in the first and only night ceremony from 9 p.m. to 21 hours. His widow and one of his older sisters with his children and some 3,000 fans gathered at the graveside. A formation of the Austrian Air Force flew over the cemetery in his honor.

<doc id="309187" wikidata="Q1438918" url="?curid=309187" title="Women in ancient Rome">
<text>Freeborn women in ancient Rome were citizens (&quot;cives&quot;), but could not vote or hold political office. Because of their limited public role, women are named less frequently than men by Roman historians. But while Roman women held no direct political power, those from wealthy or powerful families could and did exert influence through private negotiations. Exceptional women who left an undeniable mark on history include Lucretia and Claudia Quinta, whose stories took on mythic significance; fierce Republican-era women such as Cornelia, mother of the Gracchi, and Fulvia, who commanded an army and issued coins bearing her image; women of the Julio-Claudian dynasty, most prominently Livia (58 BC – AD 29) and Agrippina the Younger (15–59 AD), who contributed to the formation of Imperial &quot;mores&quot;; and the empress Helena (250–330 AD), a driving force in promoting Christianity.

As is the case with male members of society, elite women and their politically significant deeds eclipse those of lower status in the historical record. Inscriptions and especially epitaphs document the names of a wide range of women throughout the Roman Empire, but often tell little else about them. Some vivid snapshots of daily life are preserved in Latin literary genres such as comedy, satire, and poetry, particularly the poems of Catullus and Ovid, which offer glimpses of women in Roman dining rooms and boudoirs, at sporting and theatrical events, shopping, putting on makeup, practicing magic, worrying about pregnancy—all, however, through male eyes. The published letters of Cicero, for instance, reveal informally how the self-proclaimed great man interacted on the domestic front with his wife Terentia and daughter Tullia, as his speeches demonstrate through disparagement the various ways Roman women could enjoy a free-spirited sexual and social life.

The one major public role reserved solely for women was in the sphere of religion: the priestly office of the Vestals. Forbidden from marriage or sex for a period of thirty years, the Vestals devoted themselves to the study and correct observance of rituals which were deemed necessary for the security and survival of Rome but which could not be performed by the male colleges of priests.

==Childhood and education==
Childhood and upbringing in ancient Rome were determined by social status. Roman children played a number of games, and their toys are known from archaeology and literary sources. Animal figures were popular, and some children kept live animals and birds as pets. In Roman art girls are shown playing many of the same games as boys, such as ball, hoop-rolling, and knucklebones. Dolls are sometimes found in the tombs of those who died before adulthood. The figures are typically tall, with jointed limbs, and made of materials such as wood, terracotta, and especially bone and ivory. Girls coming of age dedicated their dolls to Diana, the goddess most concerned with girlhood, or to Venus when they were preparing for marriage. Noble girls were known to marry as young as 12 years of age, whereas females in the lower classes were more likely to marry slightly further into their teenage years. (Boys, however, had to be at least 14.) An example of the marriage age of noble females can be seen with Cicero&#x27;s lifelong friend Atticus, who married his daughter Caecilia Attica to Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa when she was 14.
Girls were expected to safeguard their chastity, modesty, and reputation, in preparation for eventual marriage. The light regulation of marriage by the law with regards to minimum age (12) and consent to marriage was designed to leave families, primarily fathers, with much freedom to propel girls into marriage whenever and with whomever they saw fit. Marriage facilitated a partnership between the father and prospective husbands, and enabled the formation of a mutually beneficial alliance with both political and economic incentives at heart. The girls would leave their own families and join their husbands. The social regime, geared towards early marriage and implemented through children&#x27;s education and upbringing, was particularly restrictive for girls. Some, perhaps many, girls went to a public primary school; however, there is some evidence to suggest that girls’ education was limited to this elementary school level. It has been inferred that individual school tutoring of girls at home was led by concerns about threats to girls’ modesty in coeducational classrooms. Ovid and Martial imply that boys and girls were educated either together or similarly, and Livy takes it for granted that the daughter of a centurion would be in school. Alternatively, Epictetus and other historians and philosophers suggest that the educational system was preoccupied with the development of masculine virtue, with male teenagers performing school exercises in public speaking about Roman values.

Children of both sexes learned to behave socially by attending dinner parties or other, less elitist events. Both genders participated in religious festivals; for example, at the Secular Games of 17 BC, the &quot;Carmen Saeculare&quot; was sung by a choir of girls and boys. Children were made into virtuous adults through scholastic means, with curriculum, language, literature, and philosophy teaching moral precepts. Children of the elite were taught Greek as well as Latin from an early age. Among the upper classes, women seem to have been well-educated, some highly so, and were sometimes praised by the male historians for their learning and cultivation. Some women became socially prominent, and even relatively independent. Cornelia Metella, the young wife of Pompey the Great at the time of his death, was distinguished for her musicianship and her knowledge of geometry, literature, and philosophy. This degree of learning indicates formal preparation; however, among the lower classes education was limited and strongly geared towards the course of marriage, and performing the tasks of the female within the household. Elite families poured money into their daughters&#x27; literary and virtue training to equip them with skills that would appeal to prospective husbands. Epictetus suggests that at the age of 14 girls were considered to be on the brink of womanhood and beginning to understand the inevitability of their future role as wives. They learned modesty through explicit instruction and upbringing.

The lives of boys and girls began to diverge dramatically after they formally came of age, and memorials to women recognize their domestic qualities far more often than intellectual achievements. The skills a Roman matron needed to run a household required training, and mothers probably passed on their knowledge to their daughters in a manner appropriate to their station in life, given the emphasis in Roman society on traditionalism. Virginity and sexual purity were culturally valued qualities considered vital for the stability of both family and state. The rape of an unmarried girl posed a threat to her reputation and marriageability, and the penalty of death was sometimes imposed on the unchaste daughter. The Emperor Augustus introduced marriage legislation, the Lex Papia Poppaea, which rewarded marriage and childbearing. The legislation also imposed penalties on young persons who failed to marry and on those who committed adultery. Therefore, marriage and childbearing was made law between the ages of twenty-five and sixty for men, and twenty and fifty for women.

==Women in the family and law==

===Always a daughter===

Both daughters and sons were subject to &quot;patria potestas&quot;, the power wielded by their father as head of household (&quot;familia&quot;). A Roman household was considered a collective (&quot;corpus&quot;, a &quot;body&quot;) over which the &quot;pater familias&quot; had mastery (&quot;dominium&quot;). Slaves, who had no legal standing, were part of the household as property. In the early Empire, the legal standing of daughters differed little if at all from that of sons. If the father died without a will, the right of a daughter to share in the family property was equal to that of a son, though legislation in the 2nd century BCE had attempted to limit this right. Even apart from legal status, daughters seem no less esteemed within the Roman family than sons, though sons were expected to ensure family standing by following their fathers into public life.
The &quot;pater familias&quot; had the right and duty to find a husband for his daughter, and first marriages were normally arranged. Technically, the couple had to be old enough to consent, but the age of consent was 12 for girls and 14 for boys. However, in practice boys seem to have been on average five years older. Among the elite, 14 was the age of transition from childhood to adolescence, but a betrothal might be arranged for political reasons when the couple were too young to marry. In general, noble women married younger than women of the lower classes. Most Roman women would have married in their late teens to early twenties. An aristocratic girl was expected to be a virgin when she married, as her young age might indicate. A daughter could legitimately refuse a match made by her parents only by showing that the proposed husband was of bad character.

In the early Republic, the bride became subject to her husband&#x27;s &quot;potestas&quot;, but to a lesser degree than their children. By the early Empire, however, a daughter&#x27;s legal relationship to her father remained unchanged when she married, even though she moved into her husband&#x27;s home. This arrangement was one of the factors in the degree of independence Roman women enjoyed relative to those of many other ancient cultures and up to the early modern period. Although a Roman woman had to answer to her father legally, she did not conduct her daily life under his direct scrutiny, and her husband had no legal power over her.
A daughter was expected to be deferential toward her father and to remain loyal to him, even if it meant having to disagree with her husband&#x27;s actions. For some, &quot;deference&quot; was not always absolute. After arranging his daughter&#x27;s first two marriages, Cicero disapproved—rightly, as it turned out—of her choice to marry the unreliable Dolabella, but found himself unable to prevent it.

A daughter kept her own family name (&quot;nomen&quot;) for life, not assuming that of her husband. Children usually took the father&#x27;s name. In the Imperial period, however, children might sometimes make their mother&#x27;s family name part of theirs, or even adopt it instead.

== Women and sexuality ==
From the start of the Roman Republic, there was a high emphasis placed on a woman&#x27;s virginity. Pudicitia (chastity) was a goddess of feminine purity, and was worshipped by Roman women. Only those who were virgins were allowed to enter the temple. A woman&#x27;s sexual life began with the consummation of her marriage in her husband&#x27;s cubiculum (private room), where slaves did not enter. In Roman houses, it was common for men and women to each have their own cubicula, allowing the potential for them to carry on separate sex lives. While it was expected that women should only have sexual relations with their husbands, it was common for a man to have many sexual partners throughout his life. After marriage, women were scrutinized in the household to prevent any adulterous behavior. For example, Julius Caesar&#x27;s second wife, Pompeia, attempted to have private relations with Publius Clodius. Julius Caesar&#x27;s mother, Aurelia, who monitored Pompeia&#x27;s actions, prevented their private meetings. The mere possibility of Pompeia committing adultery caused Caesar to divorce her.

=== Augustus&#x27;s campaign on women and the family ===
The focus on a woman&#x27;s purity and on her role as a faithful wife and dutiful mother in the family increased during the reign of Augustus. This general campaign to improve family dynamics began in 18–17 BC. Augustus&#x27; new laws targeted both men and women between the ages of 20 and 55, who were rewarded for being in what were considered healthy relationships, and punished if unmarried or childless. Additionally, Augustus enforced the divorce and punishment of adulterous wives. Women under his rule could be punished in the courts for adultery and banished. A woman&#x27;s private relationships now became a publicly regulated matter. The palace was secured and driven by the idea that women would be returned to their proper places as chaste wives and mothers, and thus household order would be restored. Augustus went so far as to punish and exile his own daughter, Julia, for engaging in extramarital affairs.

===Women and the law===
Although the rights and status of women in the earliest period of Roman history were more restricted than in the late Republic and Empire, as early as the 5th century BC, Roman women could own land, write their own wills, and appear in court. The historian Valerius Maximus devotes a section of his work &quot;On Memorable Deeds and Speeches&quot; to women who conducted cases on their own behalf, or on behalf of others. These women got to show their ability as orators in the courtroom at a time when oratory was considered a defining pursuit of the most ambitious Roman men. One of these, Maesia Sentinas, is identified by her origin in the town of Sentinum, and not, as was customary, by her relation to a man. The independent Maesia spoke in her own defense, and was acquitted almost unanimously after only a short trial because she spoke with such strength and effectiveness. Since these characteristics were considered masculine, however, the historian opined that under her feminine appearance, she had a &quot;virile spirit&quot;, and thereafter she was called &quot;the Androgyne&quot;.
Maesia&#x27;s ability to present a case &quot;methodically and vigorously&quot; suggests that while women did not plead regularly in open court, they had experience in private declamation and family court. Afrania, the wife of a senator during the time of Sulla, appeared so frequently before the praetor who presided over the court, even though she had male advocates who could have spoken for her, that she was accused of &quot;calumnia&quot;, malicious prosecution. An edict was consequently enacted that prohibited women from bringing claims on behalf of others, on the grounds that it jeopardized their &quot;pudicitia&quot;, the modesty appropriate to one&#x27;s station. It has been noted that while women were often impugned for their feeblemindedness and ignorance of the law, and thus in need of protection by male advocates, in reality actions were taken to restrict their influence and effectiveness. Despite this specific restriction, there are numerous examples of women taking informed actions in legal matters in the Late Republic and Principate, including dictating legal strategy to their advocate behind the scenes.

An emancipated woman legally became &quot;sui iuris&quot;, or her own person, and could own property and dispose of it as she saw fit. If a &quot;pater familias&quot; died intestate, the law required the equal division of his estate amongst his children, regardless of their age and sex. A will that did otherwise, or emancipated any family member without due process of law, could be challenged. From the late Republic onward, a woman who inherited a share equal with her brothers would have been independent of control.

As in the case of minors, an emancipated woman had a legal guardian (&quot;tutor&quot;) appointed to her. She retained her powers of administration, however, and the guardian&#x27;s main if not sole purpose was to give formal consent to actions. The guardian had no say in her private life, and a woman &quot;sui iuris&quot; could marry as she pleased. A woman also had certain avenues of recourse if she wished to replace an obstructive tutor. Under Augustus, a woman who had gained the &quot;ius liberorum&quot;, the legal right to certain privileges after bearing three children, was also released from guardianship, and the emperor Claudius banned agnatic guardianship. The role of guardianship as a legal institution gradually diminished, and by the 2nd century CE the jurist Gaius said he saw no reason for it. The Christianization of the Empire, beginning with the conversion of the Emperor Constantine in the early 4th century, eventually had consequences for the legal status of women.

===Marriage===
Family tomb inscriptions of respectable Romans suggest that the ideal Roman marriage was one of mutual loyalty, in which husband and wife shared interests, activities, and property.

In the earliest period of the Roman Republic, a bride passed from her father&#x27;s control into the &quot;hand&quot; &quot;(manus)&quot; of her husband. She then became subject to her husband&#x27;s &quot;potestas&quot;, though to a lesser degree than their children. In the earliest periods of Roman history, &quot;Manus&quot; marriage meant that a married woman would be subjugated by her husband. That custom had died out by the 1st century BCE in favor of free marriage, which did not grant a husband any rights over his wife or cause any significant change to a newly-married woman&#x27;s status. During the classical era of Roman law, marriage required no ceremony, but only a mutual will and agreement to live together in harmony. Marriage ceremonies, contracts, and other formalities were meant only to prove that a couple had, in fact, married. Under early or archaic Roman law, marriages were of three kinds: &quot;confarreatio&quot;, symbolized by the sharing of bread (&quot;panis farreus&quot;); &quot;coemptio&quot;, &quot;by purchase&quot;; and &quot;usus&quot;, &quot;by mutual cohabitation&quot;. Patricians always married by &quot;confarreatio&quot;, while plebeians married by the latter two types. In marriage by &quot;usus&quot;, if a woman was absent for three consecutive nights at least once a year, she would avoid her husband establishing legal control over her. This differed from the Athenian custom of arranged marriage and sequestration, which did not allow wives to walk the streets unescorted.

The form of marriage known as &quot;manus&quot; was the norm in the early Republic, but became less frequent thereafter. The bride&#x27;s dowry, any inheritance rights transferred through her marriage, and any subsequently-acquired property belonged to her husband. Husbands could divorce their wives on grounds of adultery, and a few cases of divorce on the grounds of a wife&#x27;s infertility are recorded. &quot;Manus&quot; marriage was an unequal relationship; it changed a woman’s intestate heirs from her siblings to her children, not because she was their mother but because her legal status was the same as that of a daughter to her husband. Under &quot;manus&quot;, women were expected to obey their husbands in almost all aspects of their lives.

This archaic form of &quot;manus&quot; marriage was largely abandoned by the time of Julius Caesar, when a woman remained under her father&#x27;s authority by law even when she moved into her husband&#x27;s home. This arrangement was one of the factors in the independence Roman women enjoyed relative to those of many other ancient cultures and up to the modern period: So-called &quot;free&quot; marriage caused no change in personal status for either the wife or the husband. Free marriage usually involved two citizens, or a citizen and a person who held Latin rights, and in the later Imperial period and with official permission, soldier-citizens and non-citizens. In a free marriage a bride brought a dowry to the husband: if the marriage ended with no cause of adultery he returned most of it. The law&#x27;s separation of property was so total that gifts between spouses were not recognized as such. If a couple divorced or even separated, the giver could reclaim the gift.

====Divorce====

Divorce was a legal but relatively informal affair which mainly involved a wife leaving her husband’s house and taking back her dowry. According to the historian Valerius Maximus, divorces were taking place by 604 BCE or earlier, and the law code as embodied in the mid-5th century BCE by the Twelve Tables provides for divorce. Divorce was socially acceptable if carried out within social norms (&quot;mos maiorum&quot;). By the time of Cicero and Julius Caesar, divorce was relatively common and &quot;shame-free&quot;, the subject of gossip rather than a social disgrace. Valerius says that Lucius Annius was disapproved of because he divorced his wife without consulting his friends; that is, he undertook the action for his own purposes and without considering its effects on his social network (&quot;amicitia&quot; and &quot;clientela&quot;). The censors of 307 BCE thus expelled him from the Senate for moral turpitude.

Elsewhere, however, it is claimed that the first divorce took place only in 230 BCE, at which time Dionysius of Halicarnassus notes that &quot;Spurius Carvilius, a man of distinction, was the first to divorce his wife&quot; on grounds of infertility. This was most likely the Spurius Carvilius Maximus Ruga who was consul in 234 and 228 BCE. The evidence is confused.

During the classical period of Roman law (late Republic and Principate), a man or woman could end a marriage simply because he or she wanted to, and for no other reason. Unless the wife could prove the spouse was worthless, he kept the children. Because property had been kept separate during the marriage, divorce from a &quot;free&quot; marriage was a very easy procedure.

====Remarriage====

The frequency of remarriage among the elite was high. Speedy remarriage was not unusual, and perhaps even customary, for aristocratic Romans after the death of a spouse. While no formal waiting period was dictated for a widower, it was customary for a woman to remain in mourning for ten months before remarrying. The duration may have allowed for pregnancy: if a woman had become pregnant just before her husband&#x27;s death, the period of ten months ensured that no question of paternity -- which might affect the child&#x27;s social status and inheritance -- arose. No law prohibited pregnant women from marrying, and there are well-known instances: Augustus married Livia when she was carrying her former husband&#x27;s child, and the College of Pontiffs ruled that it was permissible as long as the child&#x27;s father was determined first. Livia&#x27;s previous husband even attended the wedding.

Because elite marriages often occurred for reasons of politics or property, a widow or divorcée with assets in these areas faced few obstacles to remarrying. She was far more likely to be legally emancipated than a first-time bride, and to have a say in the choice of husband. The marriages of Fulvia, who commanded troops during the last civil war of the Republic and who was the first Roman woman to have her face on a coin, are thought to indicate her own political sympathies and ambitions. Fulvia was married first to the popularist champion Clodius Pulcher, who was murdered after a long feud with Cicero; then to Scribonius Curio; and finally to Mark Antony, the last opponent to the republican oligarchs and to Rome&#x27;s future first emperor.

The Greek observer Plutarch indicates that a second wedding among Romans was likely to be a quieter affair, as a widow would still feel the absence of her dead husband, and a divorcée ought to feel shame. But while the circumstances of divorce might be shameful or embarrassing, and remaining married to the same person for life was ideal, there was no general disapproval of remarriage; on the contrary, marriage was considered the right and desirable condition of adult life for both men and women. Cato the Younger, who presented himself as a paragon modeled after his moral namesake, allowed his pregnant wife Marcia to divorce him and marry Hortensius, declining to offer his young daughter to the 60-year-old orator instead. After the widowed Marcia inherited considerable wealth, Cato married her again, in a ceremony lacking many of the formalities. Women might be mocked, however, for marrying too often or capriciously, particularly if it could be implied that sexual appetites or vanity were motives.

==== Concubinage ====
A concubine was defined by Roman law as a woman living in a permanent monogamous relationship with a man not her husband. There was no dishonor in being a concubine or living with a concubine, and a concubine could become a wife. Gifts could be exchanged between the partners in concubinage, in contrast to marriage, which maintained a more defined separation of property.

Couples usually resorted to concubinage when inequality of social rank was an obstacle to marriage. For instance, a man of senatorial rank and a woman who was a social inferior, such as a freedwoman or one who had a questionable background of poverty or prostitution, might enter into concubinage. Two partners who lacked the right to legal marriage, or &quot;conubium&quot;, might also do so. Concubinage differed from marriage chiefly in the status of children born from the relationship. Children had their mother&#x27;s social rank, and not, as was customary, their father&#x27;s.

====Domestic abuse====

Classical Roman law did not allow domestic abuse by a husband to his wife, However, as with any other crime, laws against domestic abuse do not necessarily prevent it. Cato the Elder said, according to his biographer Plutarch, &quot;that the man who struck his wife or child laid violent hands on the holiest of holy things.&quot; A man of status during the Roman Republic was expected to behave moderately toward his wife and to define himself as a good husband. Wife beating was sufficient grounds for divorce or other legal action against the husband.

Domestic abuse enters the historical record mainly when it involves the egregious excesses of the elite. The Emperor Nero was alleged to have had his first wife (and stepsister) Claudia Octavia murdered after subjecting her to torture and imprisonment. Nero then married his pregnant mistress Poppaea Sabina, whom he kicked to death for criticizing him. Some modern historians believe that Poppaea died from a miscarriage or childbirth, and that the story was exaggerated to vilify Nero. The despised Commodus may have killed his wife and his sister.

===Motherhood===

Roman wives were expected to bear children, but the women of the aristocracy, accustomed to a degree of independence, showed a growing disinclination to devote themselves to traditional motherhood. By the 1st century CE, most elite women avoided breast-feeding their infants themselves and thus hired wet-nurses. This practice was not uncommon as early as the 2nd century BCE, when the comic playwright Plautus mentions wet-nurses. Since a mother&#x27;s milk was considered best for the baby, aristocratic women might still choose to breast-feed unless physical reasons prevented it. If a woman did choose not to nurse her own child, she could visit the Columna Lactaria (&quot;Milk Column&quot;), where poor parents could obtain milk for their infants as charity from wet nurses and more affluent parents could hire a wet nurse. Licinia, the wife of Cato the Elder (d. 149 BCE), is reported to have nursed not only her son, but sometimes the infants of her slaves, to encourage &quot;brotherly affection&quot; among them. By the time of Tacitus (d. 117 CE), breastfeeding by elite matrons was idealized as a practice of the virtuous old days. 

Large families were not the norm among the elite even by the Late Republic; the family of Clodius Pulcher, who had at least three sisters and two brothers, was considered unusual. The birth rate among the aristocracy declined to such an extent that the first Roman emperor Augustus (reigned 27 BCE–14 CE) passed a series of laws intended to increase it. These laws provided special honors for women who bore at least three children (the &quot;ius trium liberorum)&quot;. Women who were unmarried, divorced, widowed, or barren were prohibited from inheriting property unless named in a will.

The extent to which Roman women might expect their husbands to participate in the rearing of very young children seems to vary and is hard to determine. Traditionalists such as Cato appear to have taken an interest, as Cato liked to be present when his wife bathed and swaddled their child. Roman women were not only valued for the number of children that they produced, but also for their part in raising and educating children to become good citizens. To rear children for successful lives, an exemplary Roman mother needed to be well-educated herself. One of the Roman women most famous for their strength and influence as a mother was Cornelia, the mother of the Gracchi. Julius Caesar, whose father died when he was only a young teen, had a close relationship with his mother, Aurelia. Aurelia&#x27;s political clout was essential in preventing the execution of her 18-year-old son during the proscriptions of Sulla.
==Daily life==

Aristocratic women managed a large and complex household. Since wealthy couples often owned multiple homes and country estates with dozens or even hundreds of slaves -- some of whom were educated and highly skilled -- this could be the equivalent of running a small corporation. In addition to the sociopolitically important responsibilities of entertaining guests, clients, and visiting dignitaries from abroad, the husband held his morning business meetings (&quot;salutatio&quot;) at home. The home (&quot;domus&quot;) was also the center of the family&#x27;s social identity, with ancestral portraits displayed in the entrance hall (&quot;atrium&quot;). Since the most ambitious aristocratic men were frequently away from home on military campaign or administrative duty in the provinces, sometimes for years at a time, the maintenance of the family&#x27;s property and business decisions were often left to the wives. For instance, while Julius Caesar was away from Rome throughout the 50s BCE, his wife Calpurnia was responsible for taking care of his assets. When Ovid, regarded as Rome&#x27;s greatest living poet, was exiled by Augustus in 8 CE, his wife exploited social connections and legal maneuvers to hold on to the family&#x27;s property, on which their livelihood depended. Ovid expresses his love and admiration for her lavishly in the poetry he wrote during his exile. Frugality, parsimony, and austerity were characteristics of the virtuous matron.

One of the most important tasks for women was to oversee clothing production. In the early Roman period, the spinning of wool was a central domestic occupation and indicated a family&#x27;s self-sufficiency, since the wool would be produced on their estates. Even in an urban setting, wool was often a symbol of a wife&#x27;s duties, and equipment for spinning might appear on the funeral monument of a woman to show that she was a good and honorable matron. Even women of the upper classes were expected to be able to spin and weave in virtuous emulation of their rustic ancestors—a practice ostentatiously observed by Livia.

===In business===
&quot;One of the most curious characteristics of that age,&quot; observed French classical scholar Gaston Boissier, &quot;was that the women appear as much engaged in business and as interested in speculations as the men. Money is their first care. They work their estates, invest their funds, lend and borrow. We find one among Cicero&#x27;s creditors, and two among his debtors.&quot; Although Roman society did not allow women to gain official political power, it did allow them to enter business.

Even women of wealth were not supposed to be idle ladies of leisure. Among the aristocracy, women as well as men lent money to their peers to avoid resorting to a moneylender. When Pliny was considering buying an estate, he factored in a loan from his mother-in-law as a guarantee rather than an option. Women also joined in funding public works, as is frequently documented by inscriptions during the Imperial period. The &quot;lawless&quot; Politta, who appears in the &quot;Martyrdom of Pionius&quot;, owned estates in the province of Asia. Inscriptions record her generosity in funding the renovation of the Sardis gymnasium.

Because women had the right to own property, they might engage in the same business transactions and management practices as any landowner. As with their male counterparts, their management of slaves appears to have varied from relative care to negligence and outright abuse. During the First Servile War, Megallis and her husband Damophilus were both killed by their slaves on account of their brutality, but their daughter was spared because of her kindness and granted safe passage out of Sicily, along with an armed escort.
Unlike landholding, industry was not considered an honorable profession for those of senatorial rank. Cicero suggested that in order to gain respectability a merchant should buy land. Attitudes changed during the Empire, however, and Claudius created legislation to encourage the upper classes to engage in shipping. Women of the upper classes are documented as owning and running shipping corporations.

Trade and manufacturing are not well represented in Roman literature, which was produced for and largely by the elite, but funerary inscriptions sometimes record the profession of the deceased, including women. Women are known to have owned and operated brick factories. A woman might develop skills to complement her husband&#x27;s trade, or manage aspects of his business. Artemis the gilder was married to Dionysius the helmet maker, as indicated by a curse tablet asking for the destruction of their household, workshop, work, and livelihood. The status of ordinary women who owned a business seems to have been regarded as exceptional. Laws during the Imperial period aimed at punishing women for adultery exempted those &quot;who have charge of any business or shop&quot; from prosecution.

Some typical occupations for a woman would be wet nurse, actress, dancer or acrobat, prostitute, and midwife—not all of equal respectability. Prostitutes and performers such as actresses were stigmatized as &quot;infames&quot;, people who had recourse to few legal protections even if they were free. Inscriptions indicate that a woman who was a wet nurse (&quot;nutrix&quot;) would be quite proud of her occupation. Women could be scribes and secretaries, including &quot;girls trained for beautiful writing&quot;, that is, calligraphers. Pliny gives a list of female artists and their paintings.

Most Romans lived in &quot;insulae&quot; (apartment buildings), and those housing the poorer plebeian and non-citizen families usually lacked kitchens. The need to buy prepared food meant that takeaway food was a thriving business. Most of the Roman poor, whether male or female, young or old, earned a living through their own labour.

===In politics===

Women had limited engagement with politics in the public sphere; among the elite, moralists extolled female domesticity. Rome&#x27;s political system involved citizen men exclusively—as politicians, representatives, magistrates, executives or voters. Many women had citizen rights but none had the vote, regardless of their wealth or their position in Roman society. though some elite women could manipulate or persuade their husbands and through them exercise political influence and in some cases, control. Ronald Syme notes, with reference to politics in the Late Republic, that &quot;the daughters of the &quot;nobilitas&quot; could not be cheated of the real and secret power that comes from influence. They count for more than does the average senator...&quot; Livy&#x27;s account of the framing and repeal of the sumptuary Lex Oppia, passed during the crisis of the Punic Wars, has the arch-traditionalist Cato the Censor (234–149) describe Rome&#x27;s matrons, who collectively protested against the law on the streets of Rome, as an &quot;army of women&quot; seeking to undermine the authority of his own gender and class, even the very existence of Rome, in their pursuit of unrestrained licence to spend money—which he describes as a particularly female disease that could never be cured, only suppressed.

During the civil wars that ended the Republic, Appian reports the heroism of wives who saved their husbands. An epitaph known as the &quot;Laudatio Turiae&quot; preserves a husband&#x27;s eulogy for his wife, who during the civil war following the death of Julius Caesar endangered her own life and relinquished her jewelry to send support to her husband in exile. Both survived the turbulence of the time to enjoy a long marriage. Porcia, the daughter of Cato the Younger and wife of Brutus the assassin, came to a less fortunate but (in the eyes of her time) heroic end: she killed herself as the Republic collapsed, just as her father did.

The rise of Augustus to sole power in the last decades of the 1st century BCE diminished the power of political officeholders and the traditional oligarchy, but did nothing to diminish and arguably increased the opportunities for women, as well as slaves and freedmen, to exercise influence behind the scenes. Augustus&#x27; wife, Livia Drusilla Augusta (58 BCE – CE 29), was the most powerful woman in the early Roman Empire, acting several times as regent and consistently as a faithful advisor. Several women of the Imperial family, such as Livia&#x27;s great-granddaughter and Caligula&#x27;s sister Agrippina the Younger, gained political influence as well as public prominence.

Women also participated in efforts to overthrow emperors, predominantly for personal gain. Shortly after Caligula&#x27;s sister Drusilla died, her widower Marcus Aemilius Lepidus and her sisters Agrippina the Younger and Livilla conspired to overthrow Caligula. The plot was discovered, and Lepidus was executed. Agrippina and Livilla were exiled, and returned from exile only when their paternal uncle Claudius came to power after Caligula&#x27;s assassination in 41 CE. In turn, Claudius&#x27;s third wife Valeria Messalina conspired with Gaius Silius to overthrow her husband in the hope of installing herself and her lover in power.

Tacitus immortalized the woman Epicharis for her part in the Pisonian conspiracy, where she attempted to gain the support of the Roman fleet and was instead arrested. Once the conspiracy was uncovered, she would reveal nothing even under torture, in contrast to the senators, who were not subjected to torture and yet raced to spill the details. Tacitus also praises Egnatia Maximilla for sacrificing her fortune in order to stand by her innocent husband against Nero.

According to the &quot;Historia Augusta&quot; the emperor Elagabalus had his mother or grandmother take part in Senate proceedings. The author regarded this as one of Elagabalus&#x27;s many scandals, and reported that the Senate&#x27;s first act upon his death was to restore the ban on attendance by women. According to the same work, Elagabalus also established a women&#x27;s senate called the &quot;senaculum&quot;, which enacted very detailed rules prescribing the correct public behaviour, jewelry, clothing, chariots and sundry personal items for matrons. This apparently built upon previous, less formal but exclusive meetings of elite wives; and before that, Agrippina the Younger, mother of Nero, had listened to Senate proceedings, while concealed behind a curtain, according to Tacitus (&quot;Annales&quot;, 13.5).

===Women and the military===
Classical texts have little to say about women and the Roman army. Although the Emperor Augustus (reigned 27 BC–AD 14) made marriage by ordinary soldiers unlawful, this probably meant that while soldiers and women in distant provinces and settlements formed relationships and had children, their relationships were not recognised in Roman law. Two centuries or so later, the ban was lifted. It has been suggested that wives and children of centurions lived with them at border and provincial forts. Shoes in women&#x27;s and children&#x27;s sizes were found very near Hadrian&#x27;s wall, at the frontier fort of Vindolanda at the same site, bronze military discharge certificates were found, granting citizenship after 25 years of service and mentioning wives and children. In Germany, women&#x27;s brooches and shoes were excavated at a military site. Trajan&#x27;s Column depicts six women amongst the soldiers at a military religious sacrifice.

===Religious life===

Women were present at most Roman festivals and cult observances. Some rituals specifically required the presence of women, but their participation might be limited. As a rule women did not perform animal sacrifice, the central rite of most major public ceremonies, though this was less a matter of prohibition than the fact that most priests presiding over state religion were men. Some cult practices were reserved for women only, for example, the rites of the Good Goddess (Bona Dea).

Women priests played a prominent and crucial role in the official religion of Rome. Although the state colleges of male priests were far more numerous, the six women of the college of Vestals were Rome&#x27;s only &quot;full-time professional clergy&quot;. &quot;Sacerdos&quot;, plural &quot;sacerdotes&quot;, was the Latin word for a priest of either gender. Religious titles for women include &quot;sacerdos&quot;, often in relation to a deity or temple, such as a &quot;sacerdos Cereris&quot; or &quot;Cerealis&quot;, &quot;priestess of Ceres&quot;, an office never held by men; &quot;magistra&quot;, a high priestess, female expert or teacher in religious matters; and &quot;ministra&quot;, a female assistant, particularly one in service to a deity. A &quot;magistra&quot; or &quot;ministra&quot; would have been responsible for the regular maintenance of a cult. Epitaphs provide the main evidence for these priesthoods, and the woman is often not identified in terms of her marital status.

The Vestals possessed unique religious distinction, public status and privileges, and could exercise considerable political influence. It was also possible for them to amass &quot;considerable wealth&quot;. Upon entering her office, a Vestal was emancipated from her father&#x27;s authority. In archaic Roman society, these priestesses were the only women not required to be under the legal guardianship of a man, instead answering directly and only to the Pontifex Maximus. Their vow of chastity freed them of the traditional obligation to marry and rear children, but its violation carried a heavy penalty: a Vestal found to have polluted her office by breaking her vow was given food, water, and entombed alive. The independence of the Vestals thus existed in relation to the prohibitions imposed on them. In addition to conducting certain religious rites, the Vestals participated at least symbolically in every official sacrifice, as they were responsible for preparing the required ritual substance &quot;mola salsa&quot;. The Vestals seem to have retained their religious and social distinctions well into the 4th century CE, until the Christian emperors dissolved the order.

A few priesthoods were held jointly by married couples. Marriage was a requirement for the Flamen Dialis, the high priest of Jupiter; his wife, the Flaminica Dialis, had her own unique priestly attire, and like her husband was placed under obscure magico-religious prohibitions. The flaminica was a perhaps exceptional case of a woman performing animal sacrifice; she offered a ram to Jupiter on each of the &quot;nundinae&quot;, the eight-day Roman cycle comparable to a week. The couple were not permitted to divorce, and if the flaminica died the flamen had to resign his office.
Like the Flaminica Dialis, the &quot;regina sacrorum&quot;, &quot;queen of the sacred rites&quot;, wore distinctive ceremonial dress and performed animal sacrifice, offering a sow or female lamb to Juno on the first day of each month. The names of some &quot;reginae sacrorum&quot; are recorded by inscriptions. The &quot;regina&quot; was the wife of the &quot;rex sacrorum&quot;, &quot;king of the sacred rites&quot;, an archaic priesthood regarded in the earliest period as more prestigious than even the Pontifex Maximus.

These highly public official duties for women contradict the commonplace notion that women in ancient Rome took part only in private or domestic religion. The dual male-female priesthoods may reflect the Roman tendency to seek a gender complement within the religious sphere; most divine powers are represented by both a male and a female deity, as seen in divine pairs such as Liber and Libera. The twelve major gods were presented as six gender-balanced pairs, and Roman religion departed from Indo-European tradition in installing two goddesses in its supreme triad of patron deities, Juno and Minerva along with Jupiter. This triad &quot;formed the core of Roman religion.&quot;
From the Mid Republic onward, religious diversity became increasingly characteristic of the city of Rome. Many religions that were not part of Rome&#x27;s earliest state cult offered leadership roles for women, among them the cult of Isis and of the Magna Mater. An epitaph preserves the title &quot;sacerdos maxima&quot; for a woman who held the highest priesthood of the Magna Mater&#x27;s temple near the current site of St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica.

Although less documented than public religion, private religious practices addressed aspects of life that were exclusive to women. At a time when the infant mortality rate was as high as 40 percent, divine aid was solicited for the life-threatening act of giving birth and the perils of caring for a baby. Invocations were directed at the goddesses Juno, Diana, Lucina, the &quot;di nixi&quot;, and a host of divine attendants devoted to birth and childrearing. Ceres was a significant Goddess in terms of childrearing but also in raising the daughter to be a good mother and wife. Ceres relationship with her own daughter was used as an example as to how Roman mothers should go about raising their daughters.

Male writers vary in their depiction of women&#x27;s religiosity: some represent women as paragons of Roman virtue and devotion, but also inclined by temperament to excessive religious devotion, the lure of magic, or &quot;superstition&quot;. Nor was &quot;private&quot; the same as &quot;secret&quot;: Romans were suspicious of secretive religious practices, and Cicero cautioned that nocturnal sacrifices were not to be performed by women, except for those ritually prescribed &quot;pro populo&quot;, on behalf of the Roman people, that is, for the public good.
===Social activities===
Wealthy women traveled around the city in a litter carried by slaves. Women gathered on a daily basis to meet with friends, attend religious rites at temples, or to visit the baths. The wealthiest families had private baths at home, but most people went to bath houses not only to wash but to socialize, as the larger facilities offered a range of services and recreational activities, among which casual sex was not excluded. One of the most vexed questions of Roman social life is whether the sexes bathed together in public. Until the late Republic, evidence suggests that women usually bathed in a separate wing or facility, or that women and men were scheduled at different times. But there is also clear evidence of mixed bathing from the late Republic until the rise of Christian dominance in the later Empire. Some scholars have thought that only lower-class women bathed with men, or those of dubious moral standing such as entertainers or prostitutes, but Clement of Alexandria observed that women of the highest social classes could be seen naked at the baths. Hadrian prohibited mixed bathing, but the ban seems not to have endured. Most likely, customs varied not only by time and place, but by facility, so that women could choose to segregate themselves by gender or not.
For entertainment women could attend debates at the Forum, the public games (&quot;ludi&quot;), chariot races, and theatrical performances. By the late Republic, they regularly attended dinner parties, though in earlier times the women of a household dined in private together. Conservatives such as Cato the Censor (234–149 BCE) considered it improper for women to take a more active role in public life; his complaints indicated that indeed some women did voice their opinions in the public sphere.

Roman generals would sometimes take their wives with them on military campaigns, though the practice was discouraged, . Caligula&#x27;s mother Agrippina the Elder often accompanied her husband Germanicus on his campaigns in northern Germania, and the future emperor Claudius was born in Gaul for this reason. Wealthy women might tour the empire, often participating in or viewing local religious ceremonies or entertainments appropriate to their class and background at sites around the empire. Rich women traveled to the countryside during the summer when Rome became too hot.

===Attire and adornment===
Women in ancient Rome took great care in their appearance, though extravagance was frowned upon. They wore cosmetics and made different concoctions for their skin. Ovid even wrote a poem about the correct application of makeup. Women used white chalk or arsenic to whiten their faces, or rouge made of lead or carmine to add color to their cheeks as well as using lead to highlight their eyes. They spent much time arranging their hair and often dyed it black, red, or blonde. They also wore wigs regularly.

Matrons usually wore two simple tunics for undergarments covered by a &quot;stola&quot;. The &quot;stola&quot; was a long white dress that was cinched at the waist and which fell to the wearer’s feet, secured by clasps at the shoulder. Wealthier women would decorate their &quot;stola&quot; further. When going out a woman wore a &quot;palla&quot; over her &quot;stola&quot;, which was held by a clasp at the shoulder. Young women were not permitted to wear a &quot;stola&quot;, and instead wore tunics. Prostitutes and those caught committing adultery put on the male toga. Wealthy women wore jewels such as emeralds, aquamarine, opal, and pearls as earrings, necklaces, rings and sometimes sewn onto their shoes and clothing.
In the aftermath of Roman defeat at Cannae, economic crisis provoked the passing of the Lex Oppia (215 BCE) to restrict personal and public extravagance. The law limited women&#x27;s possession and display of gold and silver (as money or personal ornament), expensive clothing and their &quot;unnecessary&quot; use of chariots and litters. Victory over Carthage flooded Rome with wealth and in 195 BCE the Lex Oppia was reviewed. The ruling consul, Cato the Censor argued for its retention: personal morality and self-restraint were self-evidently inadequate controls on indulgence and luxury. Luxury provoked the envy and shame of those less well-off, and was therefore divisive. Roman women, in Cato&#x27;s view, had showed only too clearly that their appetites once corrupted knew no limits, and must be restrained. Large numbers of Roman matrons thought otherwise, and made concerted public protest. In 193 BCE the laws were abolished: Cato&#x27;s opposition did not harm his political career. Later, in 42 BCE, Roman women, led by Hortensia, successfully protested against laws designed to tax Roman women, by use of the argument of no taxation without representation. Evidence of a lessening on luxury restrictions can also be found; one of the Letters of Pliny is addressed to the woman Pompeia Celerina praising the luxuries she keeps in her villa.

====Body image====

Based on Roman art and literature, small breasts and wide hips were the ideal body type for women considered alluring by Roman men. Roman art from the Augustan period shows idealized women as substantial and fleshy, with a full abdomen and breasts that are rounded, not pendulous. Prostitutes depicted in Roman erotic art have fleshy bodies and wide hips, and often have their breasts covered by a &quot;strophium&quot; (a sort of strapless bra) even when otherwise nude and performing sex acts. Large breasts were mocked as humorous or a sign of old age. Young girls wore a &quot;strophium&quot; secured tightly in the belief that it would inhibit the growth of breasts, and a regimen of massaging the breasts with hemlock, begun while a woman was still a virgin, was thought to prevent sagging. Breasts receive relatively minimal attention in erotic art and literature as a sexual focus; the breast was associated primarily with nursing infants and a woman&#x27;s role as a mother. In times of extreme emotional duress, such as mourning or captivity in wartime, women might bare their breasts as an apotropaic gesture.

===&quot;Mos maiorum&quot; and the love poets===
During the late Republic penalties for sexuality were barely enforced if at all, and a new erotic ideal of romantic relationship emerges. Subverting the tradition of male dominance, the love poets of the late Republic and Augustan era declared their eagerness to submit to &quot;love slavery&quot; (&quot;servitium amoris&quot;). Catullus addresses a number of poems to &quot;Lesbia&quot;, a married woman with whom he has an affair, usually identified as a fictionalized Clodia, sister of the prominent popularist politician Clodius Pulcher. The affair ends badly, and Catullus&#x27;s declarations of love turn to attacks on her sexual appetites—rhetoric that accords with the other hostile source on Clodia&#x27;s behavior, Cicero&#x27;s &quot;Pro Caelio&quot;.

In &quot;The Art of Love&quot;, Ovid goes a step further, adopting the genre of didactic poetry for offering instruction in how to pursue, keep, and get over a lover. Satirists such as Juvenal complain about the dissolute behavior of women.

===Gynecology and medicine===

The practices and views in the &quot;Hippocratic Corpus&quot; regarding women&#x27;s bodies and their perceived weaknesses were inadequate for addressing the needs of women in the Hellenistic and Roman eras, when women led active lives and more often engaged in family planning. The physiology of women began to be seen as less alien to that of men. In the older tradition, intercourse, pregnancy, and childbirth were not only central to women&#x27;s health, but the &quot;&quot; for female physiology; men, by contrast, were advised to exercise moderation in their sexual behavior, since hypersexuality would cause disease and fatigue.
The Hippocratic view that amenorrhea was fatal became by Roman times a specific issue of infertility, and was recognized by most Roman medical writers as a likely result when women engage in intensive physical regimens for extended periods of time. Balancing food, exercise, and sexual activity came to be regarded as a choice that women might make. The observation that intensive training was likely to result in amenorrhea implies that there were women who engaged in such regimens.

In the Roman era, medical writers saw a place for exercise in the lives of women in sickness and health. Soranus recommends playing ball, swimming, walking, reading aloud, riding in vehicles, and travel as recreation, which would promote overall good health. In examining the causes of undesired childlessness, these later gynecological writers include information about sterility in men, rather than assuming some defect in the woman only.

Hypersexuality was to be avoided by women as well as men. An enlarged clitoris, like an oversized phallus, was considered a symptom of excessive sexuality. Although Hellenistic and Roman medical and other writers refer to clitoridectomy as primarily an &quot;Egyptian&quot; custom, gynecological manuals under the Christian Empire in late antiquity propose that hypersexuality could be treated by surgery or repeated childbirth.

==Slavery==
Freedwomen were manumitted slaves. A freed slave owed a period of service, the terms of which might be agreed upon as a precondition of freedom, to her former owner, who became her patron. The patron had obligations in return, such as paying for said services and helping in legal matters. The patron-client relationship was one of the fundamental social structures of ancient Rome, and failure to fulfill one&#x27;s obligations brought disapproval and censure.

In most ways, freedwomen had the same legal status as freeborn women. But because under Roman law a slave had no father, freed slaves had no inheritance rights unless they were named in a will.

The relationship of a former slave to her patron could be complicated. In one legal case, a woman named Petronia Iusta attempted to show—without a birth declaration to prove it—that she had been free-born. Her mother, she acknowledged, had been a slave in the household of Petronius Stephanus and Calatoria Themis, but Iusta maintained that she had been born after her mother&#x27;s manumission. Calatoria, by now a widow, in turn argued that Iusta was born before her mother was free and that she had been manumitted, therefore owing her former owner the service due a patron. Calatoria could produce no documentation of this supposed manumission, and the case came down to the testimony of witnesses.

The status of freedwomen, like freedmen, varied widely. Caenis was a freedwoman and secretary to the Emperor Vespasian; she was also his concubine. He is said to have lived with her faithfully, but she was not considered a wife.

==Prostitution==

Women could turn to prostitution to support themselves, but not all prostitutes had freedom to decide. There is some evidence that even slave prostitutes could benefit from their labor. Although rape was a crime, the law only punished the rape of a slave if it &quot;damaged the goods&quot;, because a slave had no legal standing. The penalty was aimed at providing her owner compensation for the &quot;damage&quot; of his property. Because a slave woman was considered property under Roman law, forcing her to be a prostitute was not considered a crime. Prior to Septimius Severus, women who engaged in acts that brought &quot;infamia&quot; to them as slaves also suffered &quot;infamia&quot; when freed. Sometimes sellers of female slaves attached a &quot;ne serva&quot; clause to the slave to prevent her from being prostituted. The Ne Serva clause meant that if the new owner or any owner after him or her used the slave as a prostitute she would be free. Later on the &quot;ne serva&quot; agreements became enforceable by law. Prostitution was not limited to slaves or poor citizens; according to Suetonius, Caligula when converting his palace into a brothel employed upper class &quot;matrons and youths&quot; as prostitutes. Suetonius, The Twelve Caesars, Life of Caligula, Tacitus records that during one of Nero&#x27;s feasts the prefect Tigellinus had brothels filled with upper class women. Prostitution could also be a punishment instead of an occupation; a law of Augustus allowed that women guilty of adultery could be sentenced to work in brothels as prostitutes. The law was abolished in 389.

<text>The Jankó keyboard is a musical keyboard layout for a piano designed by Paul von Jankó, a Hungarian pianist and engineer, in 1882. It was designed to overcome two limitations on the traditional piano keyboard: the large-scale geometry of the keys (stretching beyond a ninth, or even an octave, can be difficult or impossible for pianists with small hands), and the fact that each scale has to be fingered differently. Instead of a single row, the Jankó keyboard has an array of keys consisting of two interleaved manuals with three touch-points for every key lever, making six rows of keys. Each vertical column of three keys is a semitone away from the neighboring ones, which are in the alternate rows. Thus within each row the interval from one note to the next is a whole step.

This key layout results in each chord and scale having the same shape on the keyboard with the same fingerings regardless of key, so there is no change in geometry when transposing music. Furthermore, the use of multiple rows allows the pianist to more naturally follow the contour of their hand and accounts for the different lengths of the fingers. The configuration retains the colouring of traditional keyboards (white naturals, black sharps and flats) for pedagogical purposes.

For an 88-note (full size) keyboard, there would be 264 keys in total, with each note playable by three keys in vertical alignment. In the picture above, the white keys have been coloured to show how the keys are interconnected. Instead of the keyboard is only wide, and the smaller key size allows reaching wider intervals.

The Jankó Keyboard caused a stir at the time of its invention, in large part due to its unique look and the intelligent design behind the keyboard. American piano manufacturer Decker Brothers put the keyboard into production around 1891, and the Paul de Janko Conservatory of Music was established in New York around the same time. There was even a manual written by W. Bradley Keeler called &quot;How to Play the New Keyboard&quot;.

Despite all this, the Jankó keyboard never achieved wide popularity. Music educators were not convinced that the benefits of the new keyboard were enough to challenge the traditional keyboard. Few performers were prepared to relearn their repertoire on a new keyboard with entirely different fingering. Both reasons left keyboard instrument manufacturers afraid to invest in a redesigned keyboard which promised to have only marginal commercial success.

Many embodiments of this keyboard have appeared since its conception. Jankó himself (in German patent 25852, dated 14 January 1884) originally chose a key shape which resembled the slim, black keys on the familiar piano keyboard. A year later (in German patent 32138, dated 1 July 1885) the keys became wider and shorter. Other inventors have filed patents for keyboards which are substantially similar to his design, differing most often in key shape or instrument to which those keyboards are affixed, including:
* John Trotter, English Patent 3404, 4 March 1811
* William A. B. Lunn devised in 1843 under the name of Arthur Wallbridge a sequential keyboard with two parallel rows of keys, each in whole tones
* Miguel Theodore de Folly, Useful Registered Design Number 448 for a geometrical keyboard for the pianoforte, 1845

<doc id="309191" wikidata="Q1182065" url="?curid=309191" title="Declaration of the Independence of New Zealand">
<text>The Declaration of the Independence of New Zealand (), sometimes referred to as He Whakaputanga, is a document signed by a number of Māori chiefs in 1835, proclaimed the sovereign independence of New Zealand prior to the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840.

== Background ==
On 28 October 1835, with James Busby, the British Resident in New Zealand, the declaration was signed by 34 northern Māori chiefs, including Tāmati Wāka Nene, Tītore, Te Wharerahi and Moka Te Kainga-mataa. Further signatures followed and by 1839, a total of 52 chiefs had signed.

In the process of signing, the chiefs established themselves as representing a confederation under the title of the &quot;United Tribes of New Zealand&quot;. Missionaries Henry Williams and George Clarke translated the declaration and signed as witnesses. Merchants James Clendon and Gilbert Mair also signed as witnesses.

The declaration arose in response to concerns over the lawlessness of British subjects in New Zealand and in response to a fear that France would declare sovereignty over the islands. A Frenchman, Charles de Thierry, who titled himself &#x27;Charles, Baron de Tierry, Sovereign Chief of New Zealand and King of Nuku Hiva&#x27; (in the Marquesas Islands), sought to establish a colony on a plot of land that he claimed to have purchased in the Hokianga.

In 1834, some chiefs selected a flag now known as the flag of the United Tribes of New Zealand for use on ships originating from New Zealand.

The need for a flag of New Zealand first became clear when the merchant ship &quot;Sir George Murray&quot;, built in the Hokianga, was seized by customs officials in the port of Sydney. The ship had sailed without a flag, a violation of British navigation laws. New Zealand was then not a colony and had no flag. The ship&#x27;s detention reportedly aroused indignation among the Māori population. Unless a flag were selected, ships would continue to be seized.

The flag, amended slightly when officially gazetted, became the first distinctive flag of New Zealand. As late as 1900, it was still being used to depict New Zealand, and it appeared on the South African War Medal that was issued to New Zealand soldiers of the Second Boer War. The original version of the flag, with eight-pointed stars and black fimbriation, is still used by some Māori groups.

The declaration is displayed at the National Library of New Zealand, as part of the &quot;He Tohu&quot; exhibition, along with the Treaty of Waitangi and the 1893 Women&#x27;s Suffrage Petition.

== Text ==
The hereditary chiefs and heads of the tribes of the northern parts of New Zealand declared the constitution of an independent state. They agreed to meet in Waitangi each year to frame laws and invited the southern tribes of New Zealand to &quot;lay aside their private animosities&quot; and join them.
The original English text, as was drafted by James Busby and sent to the New South Wales government and the Colonial Office in Britain is as follows:


=== Explanation of Māori text===
The Māori text of the declaration was made by the &quot;tino rangatira&quot; (hereditary chiefs) of the northern part of New Zealand. It uses the term &quot;Rangatiratanga&quot; to mean &quot;independence&quot; and declares the country a &quot;whenua Rangatira&quot; (independent state) that is to be known as the United Tribes of New Zealand ().

The translation of the second paragraph is &quot;that all sovereign power and authority in the land&quot; (&quot;Ko te Kingitanga ko te mana i te wenua&quot;) should &quot;reside entirely and exclusively in the hereditary chiefs and heads of tribes in their collective capacity&quot;, expressed as the United Tribes of New Zealand.

The terms and are used in claiming sovereignty of the state to the assembly of the hereditary chiefs, and it is declared that no government (&quot;kawanatanga&quot;) would exist except by persons appointed by the assembly of hereditary chiefs.

==Impact==
The signatories sent a copy of the document to King William IV (who reigned from 1830 to 1837), asking him to act as the protector of the new state. The King had acknowledged the flag of the United Tribes of New Zealand and now recognised the declaration in a letter from Lord Glenelg (British Secretary of State for War and the Colonies), following consideration of the declaration by the House of Lords, dated 25 May 1836.

It read, in part:

The declaration was not well received by the Colonial Office, and it was decided that a new policy for New Zealand was needed as a corrective.

It is notable that the Treaty of Waitangi was made between the British Crown and &quot;the chiefs of the United Tribes of New Zealand&quot; in recognition of their independent sovereignty.

== Legal effects ==
Historians agree the declaration had limited significance and was primarily an attempt by James Busby to portray a settled form of government, one that did not then exist. Micheal King said the declaration &quot;had no reality, since there was...no national indigenous power structure&quot;, and Claudia Orange noted that &quot;there was no indigenous power structure...upon which to base a national congress&quot;. Matthew Wright argues that the declaration and the 1840 Treaty of Waitangi &quot;were expedients cooked up by local officials - particularly signatories James Busby and William Hobson - to meet immediate British imperial needs.&quot; 

Māori unity movements have looked to the document as the basis for Māori claims to self-determination that reaffirmed tikanga Māori and Māori concepts of power and decision-making.

=== Ngāpuhi Waitangi Tribunal claim (Te Paparahi o te Raki inquiry) ===
In 2010, the Waitangi Tribunal began hearing Ngāpuhi&#x27;s claim that sovereignty was not ceded in their signing of the Treaty of Waitangi. The Tribunal, in their &quot;Te Paparahi o Te Raki&quot; inquiry (Wai 1040), is in the process of considering the Māori and Crown understandings of the declaration and the treaty. That aspect of the inquiry raises issues as to the nature of sovereignty and whether the Māori signatories to the Treaty of Waitangi intended to transfer sovereignty.

The first stage of the report was released in November 2014, and found that Māori chiefs never agreed to give up their sovereignty when they signed the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840. Tribunal manager Julie Tangaere said at the report&#x27;s release to the Ngapuhi claimants:

Final submissions were received in May 2018, but the second stage of the report was still in the process of being written up .

==Memory of the World==

The physical sheets of the 1835 handwritten declaration and 1837 print copy are held by Archives New Zealand. In 2015, the documents were added to the UNESCO Memory of the World Aotearoa New Zealand Ngā Mahara o te Ao register.

<doc id="309205" wikidata="Q7176634" url="?curid=309205" title="Peter Robinson (speechwriter)">
<text>Peter Mark Robinson (born April 18, 1957) is an American author, research fellow, television host and former speechwriter for then-Vice President George H. W. Bush and President Ronald Reagan. He is currently the host of &quot;Uncommon Knowledge&quot;, an interview show by Stanford&#x27;s Hoover Institution. He is also a research fellow at the Hoover Institution, and a co-founder of the Ricochet website.

==Early life and education==
Robinson grew up in Vestal, New York. He attended Dartmouth College from 1975 to 1979, where he was a member of Tri-Kap, and wrote for &quot;The Dartmouth&quot;. He majored in English and graduated &quot;summa cum laude&quot;, then continued his studies at Christ Church, Oxford, pursuing a second bachelor&#x27;s degree in Philosophy, Politics and Economics and graduating in 1982. Robinson also attended the Stanford Graduate School of Business. He graduated with an MBA in 1990.

==Uncommon Knowledge==
Robinson is the host of &quot;Uncommon Knowledge&quot;, a political podcast at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. The show has featured guests like Thomas Sowell, Benjamin Netanyahu, and Henry Kissinger, and it delves into topics such as public policy, history, geopolitics, and economics.

==Speechwriter==

After Oxford, Robinson applied for a position at the White House. In an event he describes as a &quot;fluke&quot;, he was given a job as the chief speechwriter for Vice President Bush. In what he calls a &quot;second fluke&quot;, he was then transferred to President Reagan&#x27;s staff as a special assistant and speechwriter, where he wrote the famed 1987 &quot;Tear down this wall&quot; address. Referencing Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s refusal to remove the Berlin Wall, the speech, delivered by Reagan at the Brandenburg Gate in West Berlin on 12 June 1987, contained the sentence: &quot;Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!&quot;

On arrival in the city before writing the speech, Robinson was warned by US diplomats to avoid Cold War rhetoric and that Berliners had adjusted to the presence of the Berlin Wall. However, after consultation with local Berliners, he found them deeply wounded and concerned about the wall; in many instances it had separated families and represented an intrusion of a police state into daily life. Returning to Washington D.C., Robinson&#x27;s phrase became controversial with the State Department and other staff members, including Chief of Staff Howard Baker and National Security Advisor Colin Powell. Repeated attempts were made to remove it from the speech, but Reagan overruled them, wishing to communicate not only with West Berliners but with East Germans on the other side of the wall. Reagan went so far as to say &quot;yes, this wall will fall&quot;, and that &quot;As long as this gate is closed, as long as this scar of a wall is permitted to stand, it is not the German question alone that remains open, but the question of freedom for all mankind.&quot;

Robinson wrote more than 300 speeches during his White House tenure. After serving for six years, Robinson attended business school at Stanford University where he earned a Master of Business Administration in 1990. The journal he kept of his two-year experience there was the basis for his book &quot;Snapshots from Hell: The Making of an MBA&quot;, published in 1994, which details the considerable difficulty he encountered during the first year of business school due to his lack of a &quot;quantitative background&quot;.

==Research fellow==
In the early 1990s, Robinson joined the News Corporation run by Rupert Murdoch, and then served as press secretary to the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. In 1993, Robinson became a research fellow at the Hoover Institution, Stanford&#x27;s conservative research center. In addition to writing about business and politics, he also edits the &quot;Hoover Digest&quot; and hosted a PBS public affairs television program &quot;Uncommon Knowledge&quot;, later re-branded as a Web cast at hoover.org, and then arranged to be released semiweekly on National Review Online. He has written &quot;How Ronald Reagan Changed My Life&quot; and &quot;It’s My Party: A Republican&#x27;s Messy Love Affair with the GOP&quot;, a study of the Republican Party.

He served on the Board of Trustees of Dartmouth College from 2005 to 2013.

==Personal life and writings==

Robinson lives in northern California with his wife, Edita, and their five children. Edita&#x27;s parents left Cuba in 1959 and she was born about 18 months later.

In 2003, he published his third book, &quot;How Ronald Reagan Changed My Life&quot;. He has stated that it is &quot;nothing less than a love story – an account of the profound respect and affection that one young man came to feel for the President who changed his life forever.&quot; The book received a favorable review from Margaret Thatcher, and she remarked that it features a &quot;wealth of insights&quot;.

<text>AiRail Service is offered by Deutsche Bahn AG in cooperation with Lufthansa, American Airlines and Emirates. It is one example of several a dedicated air-rail alliances currently operating worldwide.

AiRail Service is currently offered between Frankfurt (Main) Flughafen Fernbahnhof (the long-distance railway station of Frankfurt International Airport) and 26 cities in Germany which include the central railway stations of Cologne, Dusseldorf and Stuttgart.

Right after arriving at the long-distance train station at Frankfurt Airport, Lufthansa Express Rail customers can quickly and conveniently drop off their baggage and also check in for their flight in the nearby AiRail Terminal.

AiRail Service uses the Cologne-Frankfurt high-speed rail line (maximum speed of 300 km/h) and between Stuttgart and Mannheim (maximum speed of 250 km/h), rendering the train service faster and more reliable than air transport on the same route.

AiRail Service was established 1982, when Deutsche Bundesbahn (now Deutsche Bahn AG) established a direct connection between Düsseldorf and Frankfurt Airport using the DB 403 &quot;Donald Duck&quot; EMU with tilting technology in Lufthansa livery. In 1990 they established the Stuttgart-Frankfurt connection after the high-speed train line between Stuttgart and Mannheim was opened. Both services were closed due to high cost in 1993. In 2000 they re-established the service between Stuttgart and Frankfurt, now using only some seats in regular cars in standard ICE service.

<doc id="309208" wikidata="Q1152037" url="?curid=309208" title="Aerobic exercise">
<text>Aerobic exercise, also known as cardio, is physical exercise of low to high intensity that depends primarily on the aerobic energy-generating process. &quot;Aerobic&quot; is defined as &quot;relating to, involving, or requiring oxygen&quot;, and refers to the use of oxygen to meet energy demands during exercise via aerobic metabolism adequately. Aerobic exercise is performed by repeating sequences of light-to-moderate intensity activities for extended periods of time. According to the World Health Organization, over 31% of adults and 80% of adolescents fail to maintain the recommended levels of physical activity. Examples of cardiovascular or aerobic exercise are medium- to long-distance running or jogging, swimming, cycling, stair climbing and walking.

For reducing the risk of health issues, 2.5 hours of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise per week is recommended. At the same time, even doing an hour and a quarter (11 minutes/day) of exercise can reduce the risk of early death, cardiovascular disease, stroke, and cancer.

Aerobic exercise may be better referred to as &quot;solely aerobic&quot;, as it is designed to be low-intensity enough that all carbohydrates are aerobically turned into energy via mitochondrial ATP production. Mitochondria are organelles that rely on oxygen for the metabolism of carbs, proteins, and fats. Aerobic exercise causes a remodeling of mitochondrial cells within the tissues of the liver and heart.

== History ==
Archibald Hill, a British physiologist, introduced the concepts of maximal oxygen uptake and oxygen debt in 1922. German physician Otto Meyerhof and Hill shared the 1922 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their independent work related to muscle energy metabolism. Building on this work, scientists began measuring oxygen consumption during exercise. Henry Taylor at the University of Minnesota and Swedish scientists Per-Olof Åstrand and Bengt Saltin made notable contributions in the 1950s and 60s. Contributions were also made by the Harvard Fatigue Laboratory, Copenhagen Muscle Research Centre as well as various German universities.

After World War II, health-oriented recreational activities such as jogging became popular. The Royal Canadian Air Force Exercise Plans, developed by Dr. Bill Orban and published in 1961, helped to launch modern fitness culture.

Physical therapists Col. Pauline Potts and Dr. Kenneth H. Cooper, both of the United States Air Force, advocated the concept of aerobic exercise. In the 1960s, Cooper started research into preventive medicine. He conducted the first extensive research on aerobic exercise on over 5,000 U.S. Air Force personnel after becoming intrigued by the belief that exercise can preserve one&#x27;s health. In 1966 he coined the term &quot;aerobics&quot;. Two years later, in 1968, he published a book of the same name. In 1970, he created the Cooper Institute for non-profit research and education devoted to preventive medicine. He published a mass-market version of his book &quot;The New Aerobics&quot; in 1979. Cooper encouraged millions into becoming active and is now known as the &quot;father of aerobics&quot;. Cooper&#x27;s book inspired Jacki Sorensen to create aerobic dancing exercise routines, which grew in popularity in the 1970s in the U.S., and at the same time, Judi Missett developed and expanded Jazzercise.

In the 1970s, there was a running boom. It was inspired by the Olympics, the New-York marathon and the advent of cushioned shoes.

Aerobics at home became popular worldwide after the release of &quot;Jane Fonda&#x27;s Workout&quot; exercise video in 1982. Step aerobics was popular in the 1990s, driven by a step product and program from Reebok shoes.

Aerobic exercise comprises innumerable forms. In general, it is performed at a moderate level of intensity over a relatively long period of time. For example, running a long distance at a moderate pace is an aerobic exercise, but sprinting is not. Playing singles tennis, with near-continuous motion, is generally considered aerobic activity, while activities with brief bursts of energetic movement within longer periods of casual movement may not be aerobic. Some sports are thus inherently &quot;aerobic&quot;, while other aerobic exercises, such as fartlek training or aerobic dance classes, are designed specifically to improve aerobic capacity and fitness. It is most common for aerobic exercises to involve the leg muscles, primarily or exclusively. There are some exceptions. For example, rowing to distances of 2,000 meters or more is an aerobic sport that exercises several major muscle groups, including those of the legs, abdominals, chest, and arms.

=== Examples===

* Brisk walking (about )
* Bicycling at more than 
* Hiking uphill
* Cross-country skiing
* Stair climbing
* Soccer
* Jogging
* Jumping rope
* Tennis (singles)
* Basketball
* Heavy yard work
* Elliptical training
* Rowing

=== Versus anaerobic exercise ===
Aerobic exercise and fitness can be contrasted with anaerobic exercise, of which strength training and short-distance running are the most salient examples. The two types of exercise differ by the duration and intensity of muscular contractions involved, as well as by how energy is generated within the muscle. Common kettlebell exercises combine aerobic and anaerobic aspects. Allowing 24 hours of recovery between aerobic and strength exercise leads to greater fitness.

New research on the endocrine functions of contracting muscles has shown that both aerobic and anaerobic exercise promote the secretion of myokines, with attendant benefits including growth of new tissue, tissue repair, and various anti-inflammatory functions, which in turn reduce the risk of developing various inflammatory diseases. Myokine secretion in turn is dependent on the amount of muscle contracted, and the duration and intensity of contraction. As such, both types of exercise produce endocrine benefits.

In almost all conditions, anaerobic exercise is accompanied by aerobic (in the presence of oxygen) exercises because the less efficient anaerobic metabolism must supplement the aerobic system due to energy demands that exceed the aerobic system&#x27;s capacity. During anaerobic exercise, the body must generate energy through other processes than aerobic metabolism, including glycolysis paired with lactic acid fermentation, and the phosphocreatine system to generate energy in the form of ATP.

=== Fuel usage ===
Depending on the intensity of exercise, the body preferentially utilizes certain fuel forms to meet energy demands. The two main fuel sources for aerobic exercise in the body include fat (in the form of adipose tissue) and glycogen. At lower intensity aerobic exercise, the body preferentially uses fat as its main fuel source for cellular respiration, however as intensity increases the body preferentially uses glycogen stored in the muscles and liver or other carbohydrates, as it is a quicker source of energy. Aerobic exercise at low or moderate intensity is not a very efficient way to lose fat in comparison to high intensity aerobic exercise. Lipolysis (hydrolysis of triglyceride into fatty acids), not fat burning (conversion of fatty acid to carbon dioxide), explains the intensity-dependent fat mass reduction. It has been shown that fatty acid is consumed for wound healing, where moderate intensity exercise does not produce significant damage like high intensity exercise. The size of adipose tissue is determined by the magnitude of nutrient competition from muscle and lungs for cell regeneration and energy replenishment after exercise.

==Health effects==
Among the possible health benefits of regular aerobic exercise are:

*May improve mood
*Strengthens and enlarges the heart muscle, to improve its pumping efficiency and reduce the resting heart rate, known as aerobic conditioning
*May improve circulation efficiency and reduce blood pressure
*May help maintain independence in later life
*Increases the total number of red blood cells in the body, facilitating transport of oxygen
*Improves mental health, including reducing stress and lowering the incidence of depression, as well as increased cognitive capacity.
*Slightly reduced depression may also be observed, especially if aerobic exercises are used as additional treatment for patients with a hematological malignancy
*Reduces the risk for diabetes (One meta-analysis has shown, from multiple conducted studies, that aerobic exercise does help lower Hb A1Clevels for type 2 diabetics.)
*Moderates the risk of death due to cardiovascular problems
*Promotes weight loss
*Reduces the risk of osteoporosis
* May improve episodic memory

== Risks and disadvantages ==
Some drawbacks of aerobic exercise include:

* Overuse injuries of the musculoskeletal system because of repetitive exercise, with young athletes (under the age of 19) particularly at risk
* Overtraining syndrome may lead to persistent dysfunction of a number of body systems
* High volumes of training with insufficient calorie intake puts athletes—particularly female ones—at risk for RED-S
* Aerobic exercise may not be as efficient as other exercise methods. For example, High-intensity interval training (HIIT) has been shown to provide similar benefits in a fraction of the time spent exercising per week.

Both the health benefits and the performance benefits, or &quot;training effect&quot;, require that the duration and the frequency of exercise both exceed a certain minimum. Most authorities suggest at least twenty minutes performed at least three times per week.

==Commercialization==
Aerobic exercise has long been a popular approach to achieving weight loss and physical fitness, often taking a commercial form.

* In the 1970s, Judi Sheppard Missett helped create the market for commercial aerobics with her Jazzercise program, at the same time as Jacki Sorensen was expanding her system of aerobic dancing.
* In the 1980s, Richard Simmons hosted an aerobic exercise show on television, and followed Jane Fonda&#x27;s lead by releasing a series of exercise videos.
* In the 1990s, Billy Blanks&#x27;s Tae Bo helped popularize cardio-boxing workouts that incorporated martial arts movements. Reebok shoes popularized step aerobics with their Reebok Step device and training program.

<text>Jogging is a form of trotting or running at a slow or leisurely pace. The main intention is to increase physical fitness with less stress on the body than from faster running but more than walking, or to maintain a steady speed for longer periods of time. Performed over long distances, it is a form of aerobic endurance training.

==Definition==

Jogging is running at a gentle pace; its definition, as compared with running, is not standard. In general, jogging speed is between .

==History==

The word &quot;jog&quot; originated in England in the mid-16th century. The etymology is unknown, but it may be related to &quot;shog&quot; or have been a new invention. In 1593, William Shakespeare wrote in &quot;Taming of the Shrew&quot;, &quot;you may be jogging whiles your boots are green&quot;. At that point, it usually meant to leave.

The term &quot;jog&quot; was often used in English and North American literature to describe short quick movements, either intentional or unintentional. It is also used to describe a quick, sharp shake or jar. Richard Jefferies, an English naturalist, wrote of &quot;joggers&quot;, describing them as quickly moving people who brushed others aside as they passed. This usage became common throughout the British Empire, and in his 1884 novel &quot;My Run Home&quot;, the Australian author Rolf Boldrewood wrote, &quot;Your bedroom curtains were still drawn as I passed on my morning jog.&quot;

In the United States, jogging was called &quot;roadwork&quot; when athletes in training, such as boxers, customarily ran several miles each day as part of their conditioning. In New Zealand during the 1960s or 1970s, the word &quot;roadwork&quot; was mostly supplanted by the word &quot;jogging&quot;, promoted by coach Arthur Lydiard, who is credited with popularizing jogging. The idea of jogging as an organised activity was mooted in a sports page article in &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; in February 1962, which told of a group of former athletes and fitness enthusiasts who would meet once a week to run for &quot;fitness and sociability&quot;. Since they would be jogging, the newspaper suggested that the club &quot;may be called the Auckland Joggers&#x27; Club&quot;—which is thought to be the first use of the noun &quot;jogger&quot;. University of Oregon track coach Bill Bowerman, after jogging with Lydiard in New Zealand in 1962, started a joggers&#x27; club in Eugene in early 1963. He published the book &quot;Jogging&quot; in 1966, popularizing jogging in the United States.

==Exercise==
Jogging may also be used as a warm up or cool down for runners, preceding or following a workout or race. It is often used by serious runners as a means of active recovery during interval training. For example, a runner who completes a fast 400 meter repetition at a sub-5-minute mile pace (3 minute km) may drop to an 8-minute mile jogging pace (5 minute km) for a recovery lap.

Jogging is an effective way to boost endurance and improve cardiovascular health while placing less stress on the joints and circulatory system compared to more intense exercises.

==Benefits==
According to a study by Stanford University School of Medicine, jogging is effective in increasing human lifespan, and decreasing the effects of aging, with benefits for the cardiovascular system. Jogging is useful for fighting obesity and staying healthy. However, individuals who are obese should exercise jogging with caution, as the risk of injury increases.
The National Cancer Institute has performed studies that suggest jogging and other types of aerobic exercise can reduce the risk of lung, colon, breast and prostate cancers, among others. It is suggested by the American Cancer Society that jogging for at least 30 minutes five days a week can help in cancer prevention.
While jogging on a treadmill will provide health benefits such as cancer prevention, and aid in weight loss, a study published in &quot;BMC Public Health&quot; reports that jogging outdoors can have the additional benefits of increased energy and concentration. Jogging outdoors is a better way to improve energy levels and advance mood than using a treadmill.

Jogging also prevents muscle and bone damage that often occurs with age, improves heart performance and blood circulation and assists in preserving a balanced weight gain.

A Danish study released in 2015 reported that &quot;light&quot; and &quot;moderate&quot; jogging were associated with reduced mortality compared to both non-jogging and &quot;strenuous&quot; jogging. The optimal amount per week was 1 to 2.4 hours, the optimal frequency was less than or equal to 3 times per week and the optimal speed was &quot;slow&quot; or &quot;average&quot;. A recent meta-analysis on running/jogging and mortality, including more than 230,000 participants found that runners were at 27% lower risk of death than non-runners, during 5.5-35 year follow-ups.

<text>&quot;Jack the Giant Killer&quot; is a Cornish fairy tale and legend about a man who slays a number of bad giants during King Arthur&#x27;s reign. The tale is characterised by violence, gore and blood-letting. Giants are prominent in Cornish folklore, Breton mythology and Welsh Bardic lore. Some parallels to elements and incidents in Norse mythology have been detected in the tale, and the trappings of Jack&#x27;s last adventure with the Giant Galigantus suggest parallels with French and Breton fairy tales such as Bluebeard. Jack&#x27;s belt is similar to the belt in &quot;The Valiant Little Tailor&quot;, and his magical sword, shoes, cap, and cloak are similar to those owned by Tom Thumb or those found in Welsh and Norse mythology.

Jack and his tale are rarely referenced in English literature prior to the eighteenth century (there is an allusion to Jack the Giant Killer in William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;King Lear&quot;, where in Act 3, one character, Edgar, in his feigned madness, cries, &quot;Fie, foh, and fum,/ I smell the blood of a British man&quot;). Jack&#x27;s story did not appear in print until 1711. One scholar speculates the public had grown weary of King Arthur and Jack was created to fill the role. Henry Fielding, John Newbery, Samuel Johnson, Boswell, and William Cowper were familiar with the tale.

In 1962, a feature-length film based on the tale was released starring Kerwin Mathews. The film made extensive use of stop motion in the manner of Ray Harryhausen.

== Plot ==

This plot summary is based on a text published c. 1760 by John Cotton and Joshua Eddowes, which in its turn was based on a chapbook c. 1711, and reprinted in &quot;The Classic Fairy Tales&quot; by Iona and Peter Opie in 1974.

The tale is set during the reign of King Arthur and tells of a young Cornish farmer&#x27;s son named Jack who is not only strong but so clever he easily confounds the learned with his penetrating wit. Jack encounters a livestock-eating giant called Cormoran (Cornish: &#x27;The Giant of the Sea&#x27; SWF:&quot;Kowr-Mor-An&quot;) and lures him to his death in a pit trap. Jack is dubbed &#x27;Jack the Giant-Killer&#x27; for this feat and receives not only the giant&#x27;s wealth, but a sword and belt to commemorate the event.

A man-eating giant named Blunderbore vows vengeance for Cormoran&#x27;s death and carries Jack off to an enchanted castle. Jack manages to slay Blunderbore and his brother Rebecks by hanging and stabbing them. He frees three ladies held captive in the giant&#x27;s castle.

On a trip into Wales, Jack tricks a two-headed Welsh giant into slashing his own belly open. King Arthur&#x27;s son now enters the story and Jack becomes his servant.

They spend the night with a three-headed giant and rob him in the morning. In gratitude for having spared his castle, the three-headed giant gives Jack a magic sword, a cap of knowledge, a cloak of invisibility, and shoes of swiftness.

On the road, Jack and the Prince meet an enchanted Lady serving Lucifer. Jack breaks the spell with his magic accessories, beheads Lucifer, and the Lady marries the Prince. Jack is rewarded with membership in the Round Table.
Jack ventures forth alone with his magic shoes, sword, cloak, and cap to rid the realm of troublesome giants. He encounters a giant terrorizing a knight and his lady. He cuts off the giant&#x27;s legs, then puts him to death. He discovers the giant&#x27;s companion in a cave. Invisible in his cloak, Jack cuts off the giant&#x27;s nose then slays him by plunging his sword into the monster&#x27;s back. He frees the giant&#x27;s captives and returns to the house of the knight and lady he earlier had rescued.

A banquet is prepared, but it is interrupted by the two-headed giant Thunderdel chanting &quot;Fee, fau, fum&quot;. Jack defeats and beheads the giant with a trick involving the house&#x27;s moat and drawbridge.

Growing weary of the festivities, Jack sallies forth for more adventures and meets an elderly man who directs him to an enchanted castle belonging to the giant Galligantus (Galligantua, in the Joseph Jacobs version). The giant holds captive many knights and ladies and a Duke&#x27;s daughter who has been transformed into a white doe through the power of a sorcerer. Jack beheads the giant, the sorcerer flees, the Duke&#x27;s daughter is restored to her true shape, and the captives are freed.

At the court of King Arthur, Jack marries the Duke&#x27;s daughter and the two are given an estate where they live happily ever after.

== Background ==

Tales of monsters and heroes are abundant around the world, making the source of &quot;Jack the Giant Killer&quot; difficult to pin down. However, the ascription of Jack&#x27;s relation to Cornwall suggests a Brythonic (Celtic) origin. The early Welsh tale How Culhwch won Olwen (tentatively dated to c. 1100), set in Arthurian Britain places Arthur as chief among the kings of Britain. The young hero Culhwch ap Cilydd makes his way to his cousin Arthur&#x27;s court at Celliwig in Cornwall where he demands Olwen as his bride; the beautiful daughter of the giant &quot;Ysbaddaden Ben Cawr&quot; (&#x27;Chief of Giants&#x27;). The Giant sets a series of impossible tasks which Arthur&#x27;s champions Bedwyr and Cai are honour-bound to fulfill before Olwen is released to the lad; and the Giant King must die. Folklorists Iona and Peter Opie have observed in &quot;The Classic Fairy Tales&quot; (1974) that &quot;the tenor of Jack&#x27;s tale, and some of the details of more than one of his tricks with which he outwits the giants, have similarities with Norse mythology.&quot; An incident between Thor and the giant Skrymir in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; of c. 1220, they note, resembles the incident between Jack and the stomach-slashing Welsh giant. The Opies further note that the Swedish tale of &quot;The Herd-boy and the Giant&quot; shows similarities to the same incident, and &quot;shares an ancestor&quot; with the Grimms&#x27;s &quot;The Valiant Little Tailor&quot;, a tale with wide distribution. According to the Opies, Jack&#x27;s magical accessories – the cap of knowledge, the cloak of invisibility, the magic sword, and the shoes of swiftness – could have been borrowed from the tale of Tom Thumb or from Norse mythology, however older analogues in British Celtic lore such as &quot;Y Mabinogi&quot; and the tales of Gwyn ap Nudd, cognate with the Irish Fionn mac Cumhaill, suggest that these represent attributes of the earlier Celtic gods such as the shoes associated with Welsh Lleu Llaw Gyffes of the Fourth Branch, Arthur&#x27;s invincible sword Caledfwlch and his Mantle of Invisibility &quot;Gwenn&quot; one of the Thirteen Treasures of the Island of Britain mentioned in two of the branches; or the similar cloak of Caswallawn in the Second Branch. Another parallel is the Greek demigod Perseus, who was given a magic sword, the winged sandals of Hermes and the &#x27;cap of darkness&#x27; (borrowed from Hades) to slay the gorgon Medusa. Ruth B. Bottigheimer observes in &quot;The Oxford Companion to Fairy Tales&quot; that Jack&#x27;s final adventure with Galigantus was influenced by the &quot;magical devices&quot; of French fairy tales. The Opies conclude that analogues from around the world &quot;offer no surety of Jack&#x27;s antiquity.&quot;

The Opies note that tales of giants were long known in Britain. King Arthur&#x27;s encounter with the giant of St Michael&#x27;s Mount – or Mont Saint-Michel in Brittany – was related by Geoffrey of Monmouth in &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot; in 1136, and published by Sir Thomas Malory in 1485 in the fifth chapter of the fifth book of &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;:Then came to [King Arthur] an husbandman ... and told him how there was ... a great giant which had slain, murdered and devoured much people of the country ... [Arthur journeyed to the Mount, discovered the giant roasting dead children,] ... and hailed him, saying ... [A]rise and dress thee, thou glutton, for this day shalt thou die of my hand. Then the glutton anon started up, and took a great club in his hand, and smote at the king that his coronal fell to the earth. And the king hit him again that he carved his belly and cut off his genitours, that his guts and his entrails fell down to the ground. Then the giant threw away his club, and caught the king in his arms that he crushed his ribs ... And then Arthur weltered and wrung, that he was other while under and another time above. And so weltering and wallowing they rolled down the hill till they came to the sea mark, and ever as they so weltered Arthur smote him with his dagger.

Anthropophagic giants are mentioned in &quot;The Complaynt of Scotland&quot; in 1549, the Opies note, and, in &quot;King Lear&quot; of 1605, they indicate, Shakespeare alludes to the Fee-fi-fo-fum chant (&quot; ... fie, foh, and fumme, / I smell the blood of a British man&quot;), making it certain he knew a tale of &quot;blood-sniffing giants&quot;. Thomas Nashe also alluded to the chant in &quot;Have with You to Saffron-Walden&quot;, written nine years before &quot;King Lear&quot;; the earliest version can be found in &quot;The Red Ettin&quot; of 1528.

===Bluebeard===
The Opies observe that &quot;no telling of the tale has been recorded in English oral tradition&quot;, and that no mention of the tale is made in sixteenth or seventeenth century literature, lending weight to the probability of the tale originating from the oral traditions of the Cornish (and/or Breton) &#x27;droll teller&#x27;. The 17th century Franco-Breton tale of &quot;Bluebeard&quot;, however, contains parallels and cognates with the contemporary insular British tale of &quot;Jack the Giant Killer&quot;, in particular the violently misogynistic character of Bluebeard (&quot;La Barbe bleue&quot;, published 1697) is now believed to ultimately derive in part from King Mark Conomor, the 6th century continental (and probable insular) British King of Domnonée / Dumnonia, associated in later folklore with both Cormoran of St Michael&#x27;s Mount and Mont Saint Michel – the blue beard (a &#x27;Celtic&#x27; marker of masculinity) is indicative of his otherworldly nature.

===&quot;The History of Jack and the Giants&quot;===
&quot;The History of Jack and the Giants&quot; (the earliest known edition) was published in two parts by J. White of Newcastle in 1711, the Opies indicate, but was not listed in catalogues or inventories of the period nor was Jack one of the folk heroes in the repertoire of Robert Powel (i.e., Martin Powell), a puppeteer established in Covent Garden. &quot;Jack and the Giants&quot; however is referenced in &quot;The Weekly Comedy&quot; of 22 January 1708, according to the Opies, and in the tenth number &quot;Terra-Filius&quot; in 1721.

As the eighteenth century wore on, Jack became a familiar figure. Research by the Opies indicate that the farce &quot;Jack the Giant-Killer&quot; was performed at the Haymarket in 1730; that John Newbery printed fictional letters about Jack in &quot;A Little Pretty Pocket-Book&quot; in 1744; and that a political satire, &quot;The last Speech of John Good, vulgarly called Jack the Giant-Queller&quot;, was printed c. 1745. The Opies and Bottigheimer both note that Henry Fielding alluded to Jack in &quot;Joseph Andrews&quot; (1742); Dr. Johnson admitted to reading the tale; Boswell read the tale in his boyhood; and William Cowper was another who mentioned the tale.

In &quot;Jack and Arthur: An Introduction to Jack the Giant Killer&quot;, Thomas Green writes that Jack has no place in Cornish folklore, but was created at the beginning of the eighteenth century simply as a framing device for a series of gory, giant-killing adventures. The tales of Arthur precede and inform &quot;Jack the Giant Killer&quot;, he notes, but points out that &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot; had been out of print since 1634 and concludes from this fact that the public had grown weary of Arthur. Jack, he posits, was created to fill Arthur&#x27;s shoes.

Bottigheimer notes that in the southern Appalachians of the United States, Jack became a generic hero of tales usually adapted from the Brothers Grimm. She points out however that &quot;Jack the Giant Killer&quot; is rendered directly from the chapbooks except the English hasty pudding in the incident of the belly-slashing Welsh giant becomes mush.

Child psychologist Bruno Bettelheim observes in &quot;The Uses of Enchantment: The Meaning and Importance of Fairy Tales&quot; (1976) that children may experience &quot;grown-ups&quot; as frightening giants, but stories such as &quot;Jack&quot; teach them that they can outsmart the giants and can &quot;get the better of them&quot;. Bettelheim observes that a parent may be reluctant to read a story to a child about adults being outsmarted by children, but notes that the child understands intuitively that, in reading him the tale, the parent has given his approval for &quot;playing with the idea of getting the better of giants&quot;, and of retaliating &quot;in fantasy for the threat which adult dominance entails&quot;.

== British giants ==

John Matthews writes in &quot;Taliesin: Shamanism and the Bardic Mysteries in Britain and Ireland&quot; (1992) that giants are very common throughout British folklore, and often represent the &quot;original&quot; inhabitants, ancestors, or gods of the island before the coming of &quot;civilised man&quot;, their gigantic stature reflecting their &quot;otherworldly&quot; nature. Giants figure prominently in Cornish, Breton and Welsh folklore, and in common with many animist belief systems, they represent the force of nature. The modern Standard Written Form in Cornish is &quot;Kowr&quot; singular (mutating to &quot;Gowr&quot;), &quot;Kewri&quot; plural, transcribed into Late Cornish as &quot;Gour&quot;, &quot;Goë&quot;, &quot;Cor&quot; or similar. They are often responsible for the creation of the natural landscape, and are often petrified in death, a particularly recurrent theme in Celtic myth and folklore. An obscure Count of Brittany was named Gourmaëlon ruling from 908 to 913 and may be an alternative source of the Giant&#x27;s name Cormoran, or &quot;Gourmaillon&quot;, translated by Joseph Loth as &quot;he of the brown eyebrows&quot;.

The foundation myth of Cornwall originates with the early Brythonic chronicler Nennius in the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; and made its way, via Geoffrey of Monmouth into Early Modern English canon where it was absorbed by the Elizabethans as the tale of King Leir alongside that of Cymbeline and King Arthur, other mythical British kings. Carol Rose reports in &quot;Giants, Monsters, and Dragons&quot; that the tale of &quot;Jack the Giant Killer&quot; may be a development of the Corineus and Gogmagog legend. The motifs are echoed in the Hunting of Twrch Trwyth.

In 1136, Geoffrey of Monmouth reported in the first book of his imaginative &quot;The History of the Kings of Britain&quot; that the indigenous giants of Cornwall were slaughtered by Brutus, the (eponymous founder of Great Britain), Corineus (eponymous founder of Cornwall) and his brothers who had settled in Britain after the Trojan War. Following the defeat of the giants, their leader Gogmagog wrestled with the warrior Corineus, and was killed when Corineus threw him from a cliff into the sea:

The match is traditionally presumed to have occurred at Plymouth Hoe on the Cornish-Devon border, although Rame Head is a nearby alternative location. In the early seventeenth century, Richard Carew reported a carved chalk figure of a giant at the site in the first book of &quot;The Survey of Cornwall&quot;:

Cormoran (sometimes Cormilan, Cormelian, Gormillan, or Gourmaillon) is the first giant slain by Jack. Cormoran and his wife, the giantess Cormelian, are particularly associated with St Michael&#x27;s Mount, apparently an ancient pre-Christian site of worship. According to Cornish legend, the couple were responsible for its construction by carrying granite from the West Penwith Moors to the current location of the Mount. When Cormoran fell asleep from exhaustion, his wife tried to sneak a greenschist slab from a shorter distance away. Cormoran awoke and kicked the stone out of her apron, where it fell to form the island of Chapel Rock. Trecobben, the giant of Trencrom Hill (near St Ives), accidentally killed Cormelian when he threw a hammer over to the Mount for Cormoran&#x27;s use. The giantess was buried beneath Chapel Rock.

Blunderbore (sometimes Blunderboar, Thunderbore, Blunderbus, or Blunderbuss) is usually associated with the area of Penwith, and was living in Ludgvan Lese (a manor in Ludgvan), where he terrorised travellers heading north to St Ives. The Anglo-Germanic name &#x27;Blunderbore&#x27; is sometimes appropriated by other giants, as in &quot;Tom the Tinkeard&quot; and in some versions of &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk&quot; and &quot;Molly Whuppie&quot;. In the version of &quot;Jack the Giant Killer&quot; recorded by Joseph Jacobs, Blunderbore lives in Penwith, where he kidnaps three lords and ladies, planning to eat the men and make the women his wives. When the women refuse to consume their husbands in company with the giant, he hangs them by their hair in his dungeon and leaves them to starve. Shortly, Jack stops along the highway from Penwith to Wales. He drinks from a fountain and takes a nap (a device common in Brythonic Celtic stories, such as the Mabinogion). Blunderbore discovers the sleeping Jack, and recognising him by his labelled belt, carries him to his castle and locks him in a cell. While Blunderbore is off inviting a fellow giant to come help him eat Jack, Jack creates nooses from some rope. When the giants arrive, he drops the nooses around their necks, ties the rope to a beam, slides down the rope, and slits their throats. A giant named Blunderbore appears in the similar Cornish fairy tale &quot;Tom the Tinkeard&quot; (or &quot;Tom the Tinkard&quot;), a local variant of &quot;Tom Hickathrift&quot;. Here, Blunderbore has built a hedge over the King&#x27;s Highway between St Ives and Marazion, claiming the land as his own. The motif of the abduction of women appears in this version, as Blunderbore has kidnapped at least twenty women to be his wives. The hero Tom rouses the giant from a nap while taking a wagon and oxen back from St Ives to Marazion. Blunderbore tears up an elm to swat Tom off his property, but Tom slides one of the axles from the wagon and uses it to fight and eventually fatally wound the giant. The dying giant confers all his wealth to Tom and requests a proper burial.

Thunderdell is a two-headed giant that crashes a banquet that is prepared for Jack.

Galligantus is a giant who holds captive many knights and ladies and a Duke&#x27;s daughter who has been transformed into a white doe through the power of a sorcerer. Jack beheads the giant, the sorcerer flees, the Duke&#x27;s daughter is restored to her true shape, and the captives are freed.
== H. G. Wells ==
in the 1904 novel &quot;The Food of the Gods and How It Came to Earth&quot;, H. G. Wells depicted the appearance of giants in the concrete reality of early 20th Century Britain. The giants arouse increasing hostility and prejudice, eventually leading to a rabble-rousing politician named Caterham forming an &quot;Anti-Giant Party&quot; and sweeping to power; the ambitious Caterham takes the nickname &quot;Jack the Giant Killer&quot;, derived from the above tale. Unlike that tale, however, in Wells&#x27; depiction the giants are depicted sympathetically, as well-meaning innocents unjustly persecuted while the &quot;Giant Killer&quot; is the book&#x27;s villain.

<text>A petitioner is a person who pleads with governmental institution for a legal remedy or a redress of grievances, through use of a petition.

==In the courts==
The petitioner may seek a legal remedy if the state or another private person has acted unlawfully. In this case, the petitioner, often called a plaintiff, will submit a plea to a court to resolve the dispute. The person against whom the action is taken is known as a respondent.

==To the government==
On the other hand, the petitioner may be complaining against the law it to &quot;... make no law... abridging... the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for redress of grievances&quot;.

A petitioner need not seek a change to an existing law. Often, petitioners speak against (or in support of) legislative proposals as these progress.

==The Whig party==
A group of 17th century English politicians became known as Petitioners, due to their support of the Exclusion Bill, a bill which would prevent the succession to the throne of the Catholic James, Duke of York, the heir apparent of King Charles II. After the House of Commons passed the Bill, Charles dissolved Parliament; when a new Parliament was elected shortly afterwards, Charles simply refused to summon it to meet. The Petitioners got their name from the many petitions they sent to Charles urging him to summon Parliament; they were opposed by the Abhorrers, who resisted the Exclusion Bill and were in no hurry to see a pro-Exclusion Bill Parliament meet. In the heat of the dispute, the two factions traded insulting epithets; with the result that the Petitioners became known as the Whigs and their opponents as Tories.

 &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Pulau Tekong&quot;
&lt;/mapframe&gt;

Pulau Tekong, also known colloquially as Tekong or Tekong Island, is the second-largest of Singapore&#x27;s outlying islands after Jurong Island. Tekong is located off Singapore&#x27;s northeastern coast, east of Pulau Ubin. Since the 1990s, the island has been used by the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) and is generally restricted from public access. Transport to the island for permitted persons is via the SAF Changi Ferry Terminal at Changi Beach.

Various pre-colonial maps listed the island with different names and the origins of &quot;Tekong&quot; are linked to several theories. Pulau Tekong was once home to a diverse community of migrants, including, Malays, Chinese and Indians who settled to form agricultural and fishing villages. During the colonial era, Pulau Tekong became a key trading hub and rubber and vegetable farming, was central to the economy. The island also played a vital role during the Japanese Occupation, with residents being forced into labour and serving under Japanese authority.

By the 1980s, the original island has undergone extensive land reclamation works for military use on its southern and northwestern coasts subsuming many of its surrounding small islets, including the former Pulau Tekong Kechil (Small Tekong Island). When fully completed, the island is estimated to reach an area of about .

==Early Maps and Etymology==
In 1604, Malay-Portuguese cartographer Manuel Godinho De Erédia created one of the earliest maps, &quot;JOR: Regno&quot;, featuring pre-colonial Singapore in his manuscript, &quot;Declaracam de Malaca e da India Meridional com Cathay&quot;. It presents a south-north orientation of the Straits of Malacca and depicts Singapore as an island with Pulo Chagni thought to correspond to modern Pulau Tekong Besar (Big Tekong Island). 

The toponym &quot;Pulau Tekong&quot; appears in the Franklin and Jackson&#x27;s 1828 map as Po. Tukang (Pulo Tukang). The early name could have arisen because the island served as a trading station for both residents of Pulau Ubin and the state of Johor. &quot;Tukang&quot; means merchants in this case. Additionally, between 1822 and 1852, British maps referred to the island by various names, including Great Tookong, Little Tookong, Pulo Takung, Tikong Besar, and Tikong Kechi.

The origins of the name &quot;tekong&quot; are steeped in various legends and linguistic interpretations. One story suggests that seafarers navigating by the stars followed a particular celestial body known as the &quot;tekong&quot;, which guided them to the island.  Another tale recounts the capture of a pirate by a Chinese trading ship in Singapore’s waters, where he was brought ashore and had his hair cropped, an act referred to in Malay as &quot;ditokong,&quot; and in celebration of this event, islanders named the land Pulau Tokong or Pulau Tekong. A third theory links the name to early settlers from Pahang, Malaysia, who fled the 1857 civil war and found refuge on the island, naming it Pulau Tekong in memory of their homeland’s district, Teluk Tekong.

Linguistically, &quot;Tekong&quot; has multiple meanings across different languages. &quot;Tekong&quot; means &quot;an obstacle&quot;, so-called because the island blocks the mouth of the Sungai Johor. Additionally, in the Kamus Dewan dictionary, &quot;tekong&quot; is linked to bamboo or sugarcane segments or a rock cleft that collects rainwater.  In Indonesian, &quot;tekong&quot; can mean &quot;something wavy or not straight,&quot; while in the Minangkabau dialect, it denotes heaviness.  Some scholars also believe that &quot;Tekong&quot; originates from the Chinese dialect word &quot;taikong,&quot; meaning &quot;ship’s captain.&quot;  These diverse etymologies reflect Pulau Tekong’s rich history, shaped by maritime traditions, migration, and cultural influences.

==History==

=== 1850s-1960s: Development of Pulau Tekong ===

==== Early Settlement ====
Pulau Tekong was home to a diverse population of migrants from China and the Malay Peninsula, forming a society of immigrants who had made the island their home for more than a century. The Malays were among the first inhabitants, primarily arriving from Pahang and Terengganu.  A major wave of migration occurred between 1857 and 1863, when a civil war in Pahang devastated the region, forcing many residents to flee by boat and establish their families along the southwestern coast of Pulau Tekong.  Another influx took place between 1891 and 1895, during renewed conflicts between the British ambassador and Pahang chiefs, and some of these migrants formed Kampong Pahang, while others spread across the island, founding settlements such as Kampong Pasir and Kampong Batu Koyok.

Over time, Pulau Tekong became home to numerous villages, including Kampong Selabin, Kampong Permatang, Kampong Pasir Merah, Kampong Unum, Kampong Sungei Belang, Kampong Ayer Samak, Kampong Pasir, Kampong Pengkalan Pakau, Kampong San Yong Kong Parit, Kampong San Yong Kong, Kampong Batu Koyok, Kampong Ladang, Kampong Seminei, Kampong Pahang, and the Chia Tong Quah Estate.  

Kampong Pahang served as the island&#x27;s administrative hub, with its &quot;Penghulu&quot; (village head) coming from the village itself. The first &quot;Penghulu&quot;, Ishak, was followed by Tengku Ahmad bin Tengku Sulong as the second, and Jemaat bin Awang as the third. Unlike other villages which focused on fishing or farming, the residents of Kampong Pahang primarily worked in administrative roles or in Changi. Pulau Tekong had a very small Indian community, with fewer than 20 Indians recorded on the island between 1957 and 1969, while the Chinese population, on the other hand, grew significantly in the early 20th century.  

==== Rise of Businesses ====
During the colonial era, the British actively developed Malaya by bringing in Chinese and Indian labourers. The advances of businesses were closely tied to the colonial government&#x27;s policies in British Malaya, which actively fostered commercial growth and created numerous opportunities for business expansion. To promote development on Pulau Tekong, the colonial government introduced a policy stating that anyone interested to farm the land could claim ownership. This incentive attracted many Chinese settlers, who began planting gambier and pepper. As rubber plantations on the island expanded quickly, the demand for labour increased, prompting even more Chinese migrants to settle, in which they established villages such as Kampong Sanyongkong Parit, Kampong Sanyongkong, and Chia Tong Quah Estate.

The reason for Hakka being the majority of the Chinese population is that most of the Hokkien and Teochew businessmen already had flourishing businesses on the mainland. When the Hakkas arrived, they decided to make a living on an island less inhabited. Most were inland farmers, (cultivating rubber, vegetables, and raising poultry) with a few shop owners selling sundry goods.

In contrast, the Teochew community settled along the coast, earning their livelihood through fishing, or running grocery stores that sold local goods. Generally, the island’s agriculture included crops such as rubber, vegetables, tobacco, and coconuts which were processed, dried, and exported to Singapore. Overall, agriculture and fishing were the main occupations on Pulau Tekong, supplemented by employment in industry, commerce, and public institutions.

During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Tekong Island played a vital role as a port. With sailboats being the primary mode of transport at the time, vessels traveling between Tanjong Sulat, Kota Tinggi, and Singapore would dock at Tekong Island when faced with rough seas. Sailors took the opportunity to trade local goods with merchants on the island while also purchasing daily necessities. Traders from Changi and Pulau Ubin were actively involved in commerce on Tekong Island, and its advantageous location spurred economic development, transforming Kampong Selabin into a thriving commercial district.  

==== Japanese Occupation ====
On 31 January 1942, the Johore Causeway was destroyed, cutting off access to the mainland and leaving Pengerang, Tekong Island, and Singapore as the last British-held territories. To adapt to the situation, the British forces reorganised their defense strategy by positioning the 1st Malaya Infantry Brigade on the right flank, while the Straits Settlements Volunteer Force held the central position in Singapore, and the 2nd Malaya Infantry Brigade on the left flank, covering the Pengerang area and Tekong Island. Furthermore, as Pulau Tekong Besar was considered a more secure location, requiring fewer troops on the mainland, the British relocated heavy artillery, (two 9.2-inch guns) originally intended for Pengerang to Pulau Tekong Besar.  

However, on 15 February 1942, Singapore was formally surrendered to the Japanese. Before the Japanese army took control of Singapore, the British had destroyed military equipment (batteries, generators, and vehicles) and left behind sugar, rice, cookies, and cloth canopies on Tekong Island. Prior to the Japanese arrival on Tekong Island, women and children sought refuge in the forest, while the men stayed at road intersections to guard against any Japanese intrusion. Meanwhile, members of a local fundraising group burned all relevant documents to avoid persecution by the Japanese.  

A week after the Japanese forces took control of Singapore, they occupied Tekong Island and the Japanese army appointed &quot;Penghulu&quot; Tengku Ahmad as the village leader and awarded a three-flower medal of honor. Shen Mu Cun received a two-flower medal and was appointed as the leader of the Chinese community. Among the Malay residents, dozens were selected, given a one-flower medal and were tasked with conveying Japanese orders and organising the residents.  During the Japanese occupation, men were forced to remove railway tracks, collect metal, cutting trees in rubber plantations, while the Malays were instructed to harvest coconuts, produce coconut oil, and craft attap leaves.  

Then, on 2 September 1945, Japan signed the surrender documents, marking the end of World War II. Following their defeat, Japan withdrew from Tekong and Singapore, and the British resumed control of the island.

==== Post-World War II ====
By the late 1950s, Pulau Tekong, the largest of Singapore&#x27;s outlying islands, had a population of around 4,000 people and was covered with vast forests, swamplands, and diverse flora and fauna. This population remained consistent in 1965 when Singapore became a fully independent republic. 60 percent of the inhabitants were Chinese, out of which 70 percent were Hakkas and 30 percent were Teochews, and 40 percent were Malays. In 1958, it was noted that Pulau Tekong was home to seven Taoist temples, two mosques, two Chinese cemeteries, and eight Muslim cemeteries. By 1966, the island still had three primary schools, all serving Malay students.

After 1965, Singapore experienced rapid development, leading to a gradual decline of Tekong Island, much like other villages in highly developed nations. The island&#x27;s youth were drawn to Singapore&#x27;s growth, leaving only the elderly and children behind. Mr. Chen Bo Sheng, 69, a former resident of Tekong, explained that there were essentially two groups: the older generation, who were accustomed to life on Tekong, and the younger generation, eager to explore the world and improve their standard of living. He noted that while many older residents weren’t initially keen on moving, they recognised that relocating to the mainland would provide better career opportunities for their children.   

Additionally, the island’s purpose began to shift considerably as it came under the focus of several land development bodies, such as the Housing and Development Board, the Ministry of National Development, the Urban Redevelopment Authority, and the Ministry of Defence.

=== 1970s to present day: Singapore Government Takes Over Pulau Tekong ===

==== Relocation of Tekong Residents ====
Population growth in Tekong increased, with reports indicating nearly 5,000 residents by the late 1970s, and it was during this period that residents of Pulau Tekong started migrating in groups to Singapore under a government program in which the last group of residents left in 1987. In 1986, the Singapore Ministry of Defence obtained Pulau Tekong for military use. With this transition, the island’s temples were required to form a consortium, register with the Registrar of Societies, and relocate to a united temple in one of Singapore’s industrial zones, now known as the Pulau Tekong United Temple (天降佛堂). 

The government’s relocation project as a lengthy and complex process that lasted about eight months. Initially, residents were informed by the authorities that they would need to relocate to the mainland under the new policies and following this, land surveyors measured their properties and assessed the number of crops and livestock they owned. Although the authorities provided financial compensation, many residents felt the amounts offered were inadequate. Former resident, Mr. Lee shared his dissatisfaction: We were given just $150 for a large durian tree that bore fruit annually. But during the durian season, that tree alone could have earned us $300. 

==== Land Reclamation ====
Pulau Tekong, as it is known today, initially consisted of two separate islands: Pulau Tekong Besar, the largest natural offshore island in Singapore, commonly referred to simply as Pulau Tekong, and the smaller Pulau Tekong Kecil. Between 1981 and 1985, the Port of Singapore Authority conducted extensive land reclamation along the southern shoreline of the island, expanding its area by approximately 540 hectares.

The initial reclamation took place between 1981 and 1985 on the southern side of Pulau Tekong Besar, where 540 hectares of shallow foreshore and seabed were reclaimed. The project, costing approximately S$620 million, involved the use of 33 million cubic meters of dredged material sourced from offshore areas near Changi and imported from Indonesia. The Urban Redevelopment Authority&#x27;s (URA) 1991 Concept Plan designated portions of Pulau Ubin and Pulau Tekong for high-density housing to support a growing population in the future. The URA also envisioned that the islands would be connected to the mainland by the Mass Rapid Transit system (MRT).  

Starting in February 2002, Malaysian media began reporting claims from local politicians about the potential negative impact of the Pulau Tekong reclamation work on Johor. Malaysia expressed concerns that the reclamation could encroach on its territory or alter the boundary between Singapore and Malaysia. Furthermore, Malaysia expressed concerns that the reclamation could impact the shipping route to Pasir Gudang Port, as the channel had become both narrower and shallower and also lead to alterations to the current flow in the Johor Straits, potentially causing flooding and harming the local fishing industry.  

At the time, Minister for National Development Mah Bow Tan dismissed Malaysia&#x27;s accusations, asserting that the Pulau Tekong reclamation was carried out within Singapore&#x27;s borders. He also emphasized that the Singapore Maritime Port Authority (MPA) routinely monitored silt levels in the shipping lane to ensure it remained navigable. Furthermore, hydraulic modeling studies were conducted to evaluate the impact of the reclamation on currents, tides, and water quality, which concluded that the project would not have any harmful effects on the surrounding waters.  

The issue was ultimately presented to the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) and Malaysia was unsuccessful in convincing ITLOS to halt Singapore&#x27;s reclamation work. Nonetheless, by the end of 2003, ITLOS recommended that both countries collaborate and consult on various measures, including the formation of an independent group of experts to study the effects of Singapore&#x27;s reclamation and suggest solutions to address any potential negative impacts. Singapore responded by stating that these assurances had already been provided to Malaysia prior to the case being brought before ITLOS. On April 26, 2005, after negotiations, both nations signed a comprehensive and final settlement.  

Land reclamation work is currently undergoing off the southern part of the island, with works on the northwestern coasts having been largely completed as of 2022. In contrast to other land reclamation works at other parts of the country, Singapore has been using the polder method to create new land for Pulau Tekong.

==== Military Training Base ====
The reclaimed area in Pulau Tekong is used exclusively as a training base for the Singapore Army. Pulau Tekong Besar is one of the islands that is a training base for the various Singapore Army with other islands, including Pulau Sudong, Pulau Pawai and Pulau Senang.

The Basic Military Training Centre is based here, where recruits to the Singapore Army are trained in basic military operations. The School of Infantry Specialists (SISPEC) was formerly situated at Rocky Hill Camp. A new training area, called Sanyongkong Field Camp, has been completed on the reclaimed land south of Dogra Bridge. Built by the Combat Engineers, this field camp will be used to train Infantry and Guards battalions.

In March 2004, Pulau Tekong was the hiding place for a group of armed robbers comprising two Indonesians and a Malaysian. The robbers had fled from Malaysia, sparking off a massive coordinated manhunt involving Air Force helicopters, commandos, ground surveillance radar, troops from the 2nd Singapore Infantry Regiment, troops from the 40th Singapore Armoured Regiment and the Singapore Police Force. All three were caught by police officers; two by members of the Gurkha Contingent and one by the Police Coast Guard&#x27;s Special Task Squadron. They were later charged with illegal entry and possession of firearms.

On 25 September 2006, the Combat Engineers of Singapore Armed Forces handed over a new field camp, Sanyongkong Field Camp, named after a depopulated village Kampong Sanyongkong, after a year of construction. The field camp would allow for longer training periods without returning to mainland Singapore.

=== Geography ===
Wild boars, tigers, dudong, and deer were once plentiful on Pulau Tekong, and this attracted hunters from Singapore. However, Pulo Tekong Besar had undergone so much development after World War II, that the wildlife has mostly disappeared. Among the larger wild mammals, only the wild boar and the dugong are present within Singapore&#x27;s national borders; the dugong can be found in the coastal waters around Pulau Ubin and Tekong, while the wild boar is located on Tekong.

On 29 May 1990, national servicemen spotted a family of three Indian elephants which had swum 1.5 km (0.9 mi) across the Straits of Johor. The Singapore Zoo worked with the Malaysian Wildlife Department&#x27;s Elephant Capture and Translocation Unit to help in its plan to recapture the runaway elephants. On 10 June, all three elephants were captured and relocated back to the jungles of Johor.

Currently, it also provides habitat to some wild animals that are rarely seen in the main island of Singapore, such as the leopard cat, Sunda slow loris and Sunda pangolin. The extended Pulau Tekong will massively replace all training grounds, like Mandai, Marsiling, Seletar, Nee Soon, Lower Seletar, Upper Thomson and Simpang. The island also houses Singapore&#x27;s second hot spring, Pulau Tekong Hot Spring in the former grounds of Kampung Unum.

The National Biodiversity Centre (NBC) and National Parks Board (NParks) has conducted coastal protection and restoration works at the north-eastern coastline of Pulau Tekong to prevent further coastal erosion. The NBC stated that the erosion had resulted from extensive movements of ships and strong waves in the area. A study NParks commissioned in 2006 found that of the north-eastern shore is most severely affected.

The coastal erosion poses a threat to the of mangroves in Pulau Tekong which is one of the largest mangrove areas in Singapore with a mature and undisturbed habitat. Local ecologists point out that the island is extremely rich in biodiversity and resident to some rare or endangered species, including the Fern &quot;Dipteris conjugata&quot;.

==In popular culture==
* In Singaporean folklore, the island is deemed to be extremely haunted. It is unclear whether the folklore actually dates back to the days when Tekong was inhabited by civilians, or the beliefs sprang up after the island was taken over as military territory.
* The Singapore Broadcasting Corporation (now Mediacorp) Channel 8 drama &quot;Son of Pulau Tekong (亚答籽)&quot; portrayed the lives of the inhabitants of Pulau Tekong before it was turned into a training area for the Singapore Armed Forces. 
*The documentary &quot;Every Singaporean Son&quot;, consisting of 18 episodes, is also based in this area where majority of the scenes are filmed here, and tells the stories about real life recruits serving their Basic Military Training.
*The popular and successful military movies &quot;Ah Boys to Men&quot; and &quot;Ah Boys to Men 2&quot;, both directed by local celebrity film director Jack Neo, are also filmed here and tells the stories about fellow recruits serving their Basic Military Training as well.
*The Mediacorp Channel 8 drama known as &quot;The Recruit Diaries&quot;, which was released back in 2013, consisting of 13 episodes, was also filmed here and also tells the stories about the fellow recruits serving their Basic Military Training, where the storyline was also pretty similar to Jack Neo&#x27;s &quot;Ah Boys to Men&quot; and &quot;Ah Boys to Men 2&quot;, where one of the cast members named Aizuddiin Nasser, portrays Recruit Deva in the drama, and he was also featured in &quot;Ah Boys to Men&quot; and &quot;Ah Boys to Men 2&quot; 1 year earlier in 2012 where he portrayed Recruit Muthu Shanmugaratnam.

<doc id="309221" wikidata="Q1455803" url="?curid=309221" title="Lubrication">
<text>Lubrication is the process or technique of using a lubricant to reduce friction and wear and tear in a contact between two surfaces. The study of lubrication is a discipline in the field of tribology.

Lubrication mechanisms such as fluid-lubricated systems are designed so that the applied load is partially or completely carried by hydrodynamic or hydrostatic pressure, which reduces solid body interactions (and consequently friction and wear). Depending on the degree of surface separation, different lubrication regimes can be distinguished.

Adequate lubrication allows smooth, continuous operation of machine elements, reduces the rate of wear, and prevents excessive stresses or seizures at bearings. By repelling water and other substances, it as well reduces corrosion. When lubrication breaks down, components can rub destructively against each other, causing heat, local welding, destructive damage and failure.

== Lubrication mechanisms ==

===Fluid-lubricated systems===
As the load increases on the contacting surfaces, distinct situations can be observed with respect to the mode of lubrication, which are called lubrication regimes:

*Fluid film lubrication is the lubrication regime in which, through viscous forces, the load is fully supported by the lubricant within the space or gap between the parts in motion, relative to one another, is avoided.
**In hydrostatic lubrication, external pressure is applied to the lubricant in the bearing to maintain the fluid lubricant film where it would otherwise be squeezed out.
**In hydrodynamic lubrication, the motion of the contacting surfaces, as well as the design of the bearing, pump lubricant around the bearing to maintain the lubricating film. This design of bearing may wear when started, stopped or reversed, as the lubricant film breaks down. The basis of the hydrodynamic theory of lubrication is the Reynolds equation. The governing equations of the hydrodynamic theory of lubrication and some analytical solutions can be found in the reference.
*Elastohydrodynamic lubrication: Mostly for nonconforming surfaces or higher load conditions, the bodies suffer elastic strains at the contact. Such strain creates a load-bearing area, which provides an almost parallel gap for the fluid to flow through. Much as in hydrodynamic lubrication, the motion of the contacting bodies generates a flow induced pressure, which acts as the bearing force over the contact area. In such high pressure regimes, the viscosity of the fluid may rise considerably. At full film elastohydrodynamic lubrication, the generated lubricant film completely separates the surfaces. Due to the strong coupling between lubricant hydrodynamic action and the elastic deformation in contacting solids, this regime of lubrication is an example of Fluid-structure interaction. The classical elastohydrodynamic theory considers Reynolds equation and the elastic deflection equation to solve for the pressure and deformation in this lubrication regime. Contact between raised solid features, or &quot;asperities&quot;, can also occur, leading to a mixed-lubrication or boundary lubrication regime.
* Boundary lubrication is defined as the regime in which the load is carried by the surface asperities (high points) rather than by the lubricant. This is the effect that makes Ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene &quot;self-lubricating&quot;.
*Boundary film lubrication: The hydrodynamic effects are negligible. The bodies come into closer contact at their asperities (high points); the heat developed by the local pressures causes a condition which is called stick-slip, and some asperities break off. At the elevated temperature and pressure conditions, chemically reactive constituents of the lubricant react with the contact surface, forming a highly resistant tenacious layer or film on the moving solid surfaces (boundary film) which is capable of supporting the load and major wear or breakdown is avoided. 
*Mixed lubrication: This regime is in between the full film elastohydrodynamic and boundary lubrication regimes. The generated lubricant film is not enough to separate the bodies completely, but hydrodynamic effects are considerable.

Besides supporting the load the lubricant may have to perform other functions as well, for instance it may cool the contact areas and remove wear products. While carrying out these functions the lubricant is constantly replaced from the contact areas either by the relative movement (hydrodynamics) or by externally induced forces.

Lubrication is required for correct operation of mechanical systems such as pistons, pumps, cams, bearings, turbines, gears, roller chains, cutting tools etc. where without lubrication the pressure between the surfaces in proximity would generate enough heat for rapid surface damage which in a coarsened condition may literally weld the surfaces together, causing seizure.

In some applications, such as piston engines, the film between the piston and the cylinder wall also seals the combustion chamber, preventing combustion gases from escaping into the crankcase.

If an engine required pressurised lubrication to, say, plain bearings, there would be an oil pump and an oil filter. On early engines (such as a Sabb marine diesel), where pressurised feed was not required splash lubrication would suffice.

<text>Rainer Rupp (born September 21, 1945 in Saarlouis, Germany) is a former top spy who worked under the codenames Mosel and later Topaz for the East German intelligence service HVA (General Reconnaissance Administration) in the NATO headquarters in Brussels from 1977 until 1989, releasing documents of the highest importance (&quot;Cosmic Top Secret&quot;) to the Eastern Bloc.

==Biography==
Rupp grew up in West Germany with strong leftist political leanings. In 1968, as a student in Mainz, employment as a spy for the GDR was suggested to him, and he agreed out of conviction. He continued his studies in Brussels, was trained as a spy in East Berlin and was hired by NATO in 1977. He rose quickly in the ranks and provided photographs of some 10,000 pages to his controllers, including the precise location plans for the deployment of cruise missiles and Pershing II missiles in Western Europe, as well as the central MC 161 document which summarized the NATO strategy as well as NATO&#x27;s analysis of the Warsaw Pact and its intentions. These documents were promptly transferred to the KGB.

He would photograph documents in his office, or take them home and photograph them in his wine cellar. He met contact persons all over Europe and received instructions via number stations, radio programs broadcasting messages encrypted as number sequences. His British wife knew about his activities and tried to persuade him to stop. He later said &quot;At the time I did it, I believed it to be my moral duty.&quot;

NATO did not have any knowledge of the existence of Topaz until GDR officer Heinz Busch defected in 1990. Busch however did not know the identity of Topaz. Several meetings of the secret services of a number of countries ensued with the aim of identifying Topaz, who took part in some of those meetings. With the help of the Rosenholz files that had fallen into the hands of the CIA after the dissolution of the GDR, Rupp was caught in 1993, while on holiday in Germany. He confessed and received a prison sentence of 12 years in 1994. He was released early in July 2000. Rupp became a member of the PDS and served temporarily as an advisor in regard to issues of security and foreign policy; he quit the party, however, in 2003.

==Averted atomic war claim==
Rupp claims that his activities may have averted a nuclear war in the fall of 1983, a claim that is not entirely unfounded according to American experts. In an interview for the Channel 4 programme &quot;1983: The Brink of Apocalypse&quot;, about exercise Able Archer 83, broadcast in the UK on 5 January 2008, he said that he had transmitted the message that NATO was &quot;not&quot; preparing to launch a surprise nuclear attack against the USSR during the exercise to his HVA controllers. He did this by way of encoding the message on a device disguised as a calculator which then turned the message into a short electronic burst which could be transmitted to a set telephone number. He viewed this as vital to preventing a Soviet pre-emptive strike against NATO forces. In the same program, Rupp said he was proud of the damage he did to NATO over the years of his intelligence activities.

<text>Arthurlie Football Club is a Scottish football club from Barrhead, East Renfrewshire. Based at Dunterlie Park, they play in the . The club played in the Scottish Football League in two spells, 1901 to 1915 and 1923 to 1929. They have won the Scottish Junior Cup twice, in 1937 and 1998.

==History==
Arthurlie was founded in 1874 and played as a senior side until 1929. The club reached the quarter-finals of the Scottish Cup in three consecutive seasons from 1880–81, with their 1883 tie with Kilmarnock Athletic taking four games to settle. A notable early result was a 4–2 defeat of Celtic in the first round of the 1896–97 Scottish Cup. Celtic avenged this defeat with a 7–0 victory in Barrhead at the same stage the following season and the two clubs met again in Arthurlie&#x27;s last Scottish Cup tie to date in 1929, with the Glasgow side winning 5–1 at Celtic Park.

With regard to league football, the club became a founder member of the Scottish Football Federation in 1891, winning that competition in its first year before joining the Scottish Football Alliance in 1893. Arthurlie obtained membership of the Scottish Football League in 1901 and achieved modest results in the Second Division, with a highest finish of joint second in 1906–07. That division ceased operations in 1915, during the First World War, but Arthurlie did not immediately rejoin the league after the war ended. They instead waited until 1923 to apply for membership of the newly created Third Division. Arthurlie immediately won the Third Division championship, and four reasonably successful seasons in the Second Division followed. Financial problems forced the club to resign its membership of the league with six games of the 1928–29 season to play. As the club had played all the promotion-chasing clubs, their results were allowed to stand.

A club of the same name joined the Junior grade during the early 1930s. They found success quickly with a Scottish Junior Cup win in 1937 – defeating Kirkintilloch Rob Roy 5–1 in the final in front of a crowd of 23,000 at Celtic Park. Two unsuccessful final appearances followed, against Fauldhouse United in 1946, then derby rivals Pollok in 1981, before they lifted the trophy again in 1998, taking revenge on Pollok with a 4–0 victory in the final at Fir Park with strikes from Mark McLaughlin, Johnny Millar, Steven Convery and Steven Nugent.

In the Junior Super League era, the club were the first ever winners of the second tier West of Scotland Super League First Division in 2003 and enjoyed an unbroken 15 seasons in the West of Scotland Super League Premier Division until relegation to the newly configured SJFA West Region Championship in 2018.

The club&#x27;s most recent trophy success was in the 2015 West of Scotland Cup final, defeating Kilwinning Rangers 4–2 at Newlandsfield Park, with goals from Gary Smith (3), and Ryan McGregor. It was Arthurlie&#x27;s sixth victory in the West of Scotland Cup, a feat equalled by Pollok in 2017 and only Auchinleck Talbot (12) and Irvine Meadow (9), have won the tournament more often.

The team are managed by former Scotland Junior international defender, Duncan Sinclair, who joined the club from Larkhall Thistle in June 2018. Sinclair has also previously managed Shotts Bon Accord, Kilsyth Rangers and Lanark United. He is Arthurlie&#x27;s ninth manager since 2010.

On 15 April 2020, Andy McFadyen become the club&#x27;s new manager. On 18 July 2022, Craig Palmer was appointed as new manager.

==Ground==
In 1882 Arthurlie moved to the first Dunterlie Park from their Arthurlie Cross ground. They moved to the second Dunterlie Park in 1906, and the current Dunterlie Park in 1919.

<doc id="309227" wikidata="Q1003234" url="?curid=309227" title="The Goal (novel)">
<text>The Goal is a management-oriented novel by Eliyahu M. Goldratt, a business consultant known for his theory of constraints, and Jeff Cox, the author of several management-oriented novels. &quot;The Goal&quot; was originally published in 1984 and has since been revised and republished. This describes a case study in operations management, focusing on the theory of constraints, and bottlenecks and how to alleviate them. In 2011, &quot;Time Magazine&quot; listed the book as one of &quot;the 25 most influential business management books&quot;.

==Setting==
Like other books by Goldratt and by Cox, &quot;The Goal&quot; is written as a piece of fiction. The main character is Alex Rogo, who manages a production plant with an uncertain future. Bill Peach, a company executive, tells Alex that he has three months to turn operations at his plant around from being unprofitable and unreliable to being successful. Jonah (a physicist), whom many believe represents Goldratt himself, helps him solve the company&#x27;s problems through a series of telephone calls and short meetings wherein he explains many fundamental business concepts. A second story line is introduced involving Alex&#x27;s marital life.

==Bottlenecks==
The book goes on to point out the role of s (constraints) in a manufacturing process, and how identifying them not only makes it possible to reduce their impact, but also yields a useful tool for measuring and controlling the flow of materials. Alex and his team identify the bottlenecks in their process and immediately begin to implement changes to help increase capacity and speed up production. In response to questions about the logic of using outdated technology in modern manufacturing, Alex&#x27;s team brought in an old machine they received for free (which had previously been used at their plant in conjunction with two other machines) in order to increase the capacity of the NCX-10 machine, which had been identified as one of the two bottlenecks. Further more, they identified processes at the heat treat, identified as their second bottleneck, that caused massive delays in their getting product through the heat-treat and which had also caused some products to be heat-treated multiple times (to make softer and then harder again) instead of just once or not at all.

==Socratic method==
In the book, Jonah teaches Alex Rogo by using the Socratic method. Throughout the book, whenever a meeting or telephone call dialogue happens with Jonah, he poses a question to Alex Rogo or a member of his crew, which in turn causes them to talk amongst themselves to come up with a solution to their problem. When Alex Rogo is with his wife, he finds the Socratic method to be a way to fix his marriage, which he then uses, with his crew, to come up with the five steps they should use to fix problems in the plant, which ultimately leads him and Lou to think up the three things every division manager, the position Rogo is promoted to, should be able to do.

<text>Neilston Football Club are a Scottish football club based in Neilston, East Renfrewshire who currently play in the .

==History==
The club was formed on Monday 4 June 1945 when a public meeting was held in the old wooden clubhouse at Brig O’Lea. Their first league game took place on Saturday 11 August 1945. It was an away match against Riccarton Bluebell and resulted in a 4–4 draw.

Just two years after their formation, the club finished the 1946–47 season as the Western League North champions and also won the Western League Cup and the Renfrewshire Cup.

Renfrew District Council took over Brig O’Lea Stadium in the early 1960s and built a new clubhouse and installed floodlights for season 1964–65. The new look stadium was opened on Monday 21 December 1964 when Neilston played Greenock Morton under the new floodlights.

In 1967 they left the Western League to join the Central League and in their first season they finished runners-up to Petershill in the &quot;B&quot; Division. In season 1970–71 they were &quot;C&quot; Division Champions.

1995 was their 50th Anniversary year, and in all honesty the club could have folded, but due to the hard work and determined efforts of everyone at the club they came through.

On 6 October 1998 Neilston won their first major trophy in 51 years by defeating Ballieston 5–0 at Fir Park, Motherwell in the Beatons Sectional League Cup Final.

Season 2002–03 saw Neilston come close to being crowned the first ever champions of the newly created West Super League Premier Division but they missed out on goal difference to Pollok.

Season 2005–06 was their most successful for 50 years as they finished champions of the Stagecoach Super League First Division and won the Carlsberg Sectional League Cup against East Kilbride Thistle 4–3 on penalties after a 0–0 draw at Firhill Stadium to give the club a well deserved double.

2006–07 saw the club get to the quarter finals of the Scottish Junior Cup for only the fourth time in their history and finish in fourth place in the Stagecoach Super League Premier Division.

Relegated at the end of 2008–09 from the Stagecoach Super League Premier, The Farmer&#x27;s Boys then suffered back to back relegations from the Stagecoach Super First Division to the Central District First Division.

The team are managed since June 2016 by Martin Campbell and John Paul Dow.

On 19 November 2018 Derek Carson and Chris Cameron become the new co-manager of the club.

Neilston moved to the newly formed West of Scotland League in 2020 with members voting to drop the &quot;Juniors&quot; part of the club&#x27;s name.
