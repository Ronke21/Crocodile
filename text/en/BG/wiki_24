<text>The culture of Brazil has been shaped by the amalgamation of diverse indigenous cultures, and the cultural fusion that took place among Indigenous communities, Portuguese colonists, and Africans, primarily during the Brazilian colonial period. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Brazil received a significant number of immigrants, primarily of Portuguese, Italian, Spanish, and German origin, which along with smaller numbers of Japanese, Austrians, Dutch, Armenians, Arabs, Jews, Poles, Ukrainians, French, Russians, Swiss, Hungarians, Greeks, Chinese, and Koreans gave a relevant contribution to the formation of regional cultures in Brazil, and thus contributed to its current existence as a plural and racially diverse society.

As consequence of three centuries of colonization by the Portuguese empire, many aspects of Brazilian culture are derived from the culture of Portugal. The numerous Portuguese inheritances include the language, cuisine items such as rice and beans and &quot;feijoada&quot;, the predominant religion and the colonial architectural styles. These aspects, however, were influenced by African and Indigenous traditions, as well as those from other Western European countries. Some aspects of Brazilian culture are contributions of Italian, Spaniard, German, Japanese and other European immigrants. Amerindian people and Africans also played an important role in the formation of Brazilian language, cuisine, music, dance and religion.

This diverse cultural background has helped show off many celebrations and festivals that have become known around the world, such as the Brazilian Carnival and the Bumba Meu Boi. The colourful culture creates an environment that makes Brazil a popular destination for tourists, who visit over 1 million annually.

==History==

Brazil was a colony of Portugal for over three centuries. About a million Portuguese settlers arrived during this period and brought their culture to the colony. The Indigenous inhabitants of Brazil had much contact with the colonists. Many became extinct, and others mixed with the Portuguese. For that reason, Brazil also holds Amerindian influences in its culture, mainly in its food and language. Brazilian Portuguese has hundreds of words of Indigenous American origin, mainly from the Old Tupi language.

Black Africans, who were brought as slaves to Brazil, also participated actively in the formation of Brazilian culture. Although the Portuguese colonists forced their slaves to convert to Catholicism and speak Portuguese, their cultural influences were absorbed by the inhabitants of Brazil of all races and origins. Some regions of Brazil, especially Bahia, have particularly notable African inheritances in music, cuisine, dance and language.

Immigrants from Italy, Germany, Spain, Japan, Ukraine, Russia, Poland, Austria-Hungary and the Middle East played an important role in the areas they settled (mostly Southern and Southeastern Brazil). They organized communities that became important cities such as Joinville, Caxias do Sul, Blumenau, Curitiba and brought important contributions to the culture of Brazil.

Modernism in Brazil started with the Modern Art Week held in São Paulo in 1922 and was characterized by experimentation and interest in Brazilian society and culture, as well as rebellion against influence from Europe and the United States and the orthodoxy of the Brazilian Academy of Letters. Tarsila do Amaral and Oswald de Andrade were among the catalysts of the movement in Brazil, with works such as &quot;Manifesto Pau-Brasil&quot;, &quot;Abaporu&quot;, and &quot;Manifesto Antropófago&quot;. In the 1930s, sociologists such as Gilberto Freyre and Sérgio Buarque de Holanda published ideas about Brazilian culture, society, and identity, presenting concepts such as &quot;racial democracy&quot; and the &quot;cordial man&quot;.

During the military dictatorship (1964–1985) and especially following the Institutional Act Number Five in 1968, the government censored material—including art, literature, music, theatre, film, etc.—that it deemed subversive or against &quot;morality and good manners.&quot; Tropicália or Tropicalismo was a movement against this repression and authoritarianism, from both the government and the Catholic Church. Part of the counterculture of the 1960s, Tropicalismo was led by figures such as Gilberto Gil and Caetano Veloso and manifested itself primarily in music.

==Language==


The official language of Brazil is Portuguese. It is spoken by about 99% of the population, making it one of the strongest elements of national identity. There are only some Amerindian groups and small pockets of immigrants who do not speak Portuguese.

Similarly to American English and Canadian French, Brazilian Portuguese is more phonetically conservative or archaic than the language of the colonizing metropolis, maintaining several features that European Portuguese had before the 19th century.

Also similarly to American English, the Brazilian regional variation, as well as the European one, include a small number of words of Indigenous American and African origin, mainly restricted to place names and fauna and flora.

Minority languages are spoken throughout the nation. One hundred and eighty Amerindian languages are spoken in remote areas and several other languages are spoken by immigrants and their descendants. There are significant communities of German (mostly the Hunsrückisch, a High German language dialect) and Italian (mostly the Talian dialect, of Venetian origin) speakers in the south of the country, both of which are influenced by the Portuguese language. Not to mention the Slavic communities, Ukrainians and Poles which are also part of these minority languages.

The Brazilian Sign Language (not signed Portuguese – it likely is descended from the French Sign Language), known by the acronym , is officially recognized by law, albeit using it alone would convey a very limited degree of accessibility, throughout the country.

==Religion==
About 2/3 of the population are Roman Catholics. Catholicism was introduced and spread largely by the Portuguese Jesuits, who arrived in 1549 during the colonization with the mission of converting the Indigenous people. The Society of Jesus played a large role in the formation of Brazilian religious identity until their expulsion from the country by the Marquis of Pombal in the 18th century.

In recent decades Brazilian society has witnessed a rise in Protestantism. Between 1940 and 2010, the percentage of Roman Catholics fell from 95% to 64.6%, while the various Protestant denominations rose from 2.6% to 22.2%.

The African-Brazilian religion of Candomblé, with its orixá deities derived from Yoruba traditions, is particularly important in Salvador and Bahia in general.

==Carnival==
The Brazilian Carnaval is an annual festival held forty-six days before Easter. Carnival celebrations are believed to have roots in the pagan festival of Saturnalia, which, adapted to Christianity, became a farewell to bad things in a season of religious discipline to practice repentance and prepare for Christ&#x27;s death and resurrection.

Carnival is the most famous holiday in Brazil and has become an event of huge proportions. For almost a week festivities are intense, day and night, mainly in coastal cities.

The typical genres of music of Brazilian carnival are: samba-enredo and marchinha (in Rio de Janeiro and Southeast Region), frevo, maracatu and Axé music (in Pernambuco, Bahia and Northeast Region)

==Cuisine (gastronomy)==
Brazilian cuisine varies greatly by region. This diversity reflects the country&#x27;s history and mix of indigenous and immigrant cultures. This has created a national cooking style, marked by the preservation of regional differences. Since the imperial period, the feijoada, a Portuguese stew with origins in Ancient Rome, has been the country&#x27;s national dish. Luís da Câmara Cascudo wrote that, having been revised and adapted in each region of the country, it is no longer just a dish, but has become a complete food.
Brazil has a variety of candies including brigadeiros, made with condensed milk, butter, and cocoa powder, and it can have sprinkles of chocolate around, and beijinhos. Other snack foods include coxinhas, churrasco, sfiha, empanadas, and araucaria nuts (in Festa Junina). Pão de queijo are typical in the state of Minas Gerais. Typical northern foods include pato no tucupi, tacacá, caruru, vatapá, and maniçoba. The Northeast is known for moqueca (a stew of seafood and palm oil), acarajé (a fritter made with white beans, onion and fried in palm oil (&quot;dendê&quot;), which is filled with dried shrimp and red pepper), caruru, and Quibebe. In the Southeast, it is common to eat Bife a cavalo, Bife à parmegiana, Virado, Minas cheese, pizza, tutu, macaroni, lasagna, and codfish pastries. Churrasco is the typical meal of Rio Grande do Sul, and in the South region, it is common to eat polenta, carreteiro rice, chimarrão, cuca, salami, sagu, wine and grape juice. Cachaça is Brazil&#x27;s native liquor, distilled from sugar cane, and it is the main ingredient in the national drink, the caipirinha. Brazil is the world leader in production of green coffee (&quot;café&quot;). In 2018, 28% of the coffee consumed globally came from Brazil. Because of Brazil&#x27;s fertile soil, the country has been a major producer of coffee since the times of Brazilian slavery, which created a strong national coffee culture. This was satirized in the novelty song &quot;The Coffee Song&quot;, sung by Frank Sinatra and with lyrics by Bob Hilliard, interpreted as an analysis of the coffee industry, and of the Brazilian economy and culture.

== Literature ==
Literature in Brazil dates back to the 16th century, to the writings of the first Portuguese explorers in Brazil, such as Pero Vaz de Caminha, filled with descriptions of fauna, flora and Indigenous peoples that amazed Europeans that arrived in Brazil. When Brazil became a colony of Portugal, there was the &quot;Jesuit Literature&quot;, whose main name was the father António Vieira, a Portuguese Jesuit who became one of the most celebrated Baroque writers of the Portuguese language. A few more explicitly literary examples survive from this period: José Basílio da Gama&#x27;s epic poem celebrating the conquest of the Missions by the Portuguese, and the work of Gregório de Matos Guerra, who produced a sizable amount of satirical, religious, and secular poetry. Neoclassicism was widespread in Brazil during the mid-18th century, following the Italian style.Brazil produced significant works in Romanticism – novelists like Joaquim Manuel de Macedo and José de Alencar wrote novels about love and pain. Alencar, in his long career, also treated Indigenous people as heroes in the Indigenist novels &quot;O Guarany&quot;, &quot;Iracema&quot;, &quot;Ubirajara&quot;. The French &quot;Mal du siècle&quot; was also introduced in Brazil by the likes of Alvares de Azevedo, whose &quot;Lira dos Vinte Anos&quot; and &quot;Noite na Taverna&quot; are national symbols of the Ultra-romanticism. Gonçalves Dias, considered one of the national poets, sang the Brazilian people and the Brazilian land on the famous &quot;Song of the Exile&quot; (1843), known to every Brazilian schoolchild. Also dates from this period, although his work has hatched in Realism, Machado de Assis, whose works include &quot;Helena&quot;, &quot;Memórias Póstumas de Brás Cubas&quot;, &quot;O alienista&quot;, &quot;Dom Casmurro&quot;, and who is widely regarded as the most important writer of Brazilian literature. Assis is also highly respected around the world.

Monteiro Lobato, of the Pré-Modernism (an essentially Brazilian literary movement), wrote mainly for children, often bringing Greek mythology and didacticism with Brazilian folklore, as we see in his short stories about Saci Pererê. Some authors of this time, like Lima Barreto and Simões Lopes Neto and Olavo Bilac, already show a distinctly modern character; Augusto dos Anjos, whose works combine Symbolistic, Parnasian and even pre-modernist elements has a &quot;paralytic language&quot;. Mário de Andrade and Oswald de Andrade, from Modernism, combined nationalist tendencies with an interest in European modernism and created the Modern Art Week of 1922. João Cabral de Melo Neto and Carlos Drummond de Andrade are placed among the greatest Brazilian poets; the first, post-modernist, concerned with the aesthetics and created a concise and elliptical and lean poetic, against sentimentality; Drummond, in turn, was a supporter of &quot;anti-poetic&quot; where the language was born with the poem.

In Post-Modernism, João Guimarães Rosa wrote the novel &quot;Grande Sertão: Veredas&quot;, about the Brazilian outback, with a highly original style and almost a grammar of his own, while Clarice Lispector wrote with an introspective and psychological probing of her characters. Vinicius de Moraes, nicknamed &quot;O Poetinha&quot;, was notable as a poet, essayist, and lyricist often collaborating with Tom Jobim. Nowadays, Nelson Rodrigues, Rubem Fonseca and Sérgio Sant&#x27;Anna, next to Nélida Piñon and Lygia Fagundes Telles, both members of Academia Brasileira de Letras, are important authors who write about contemporary issues sometimes with erotic or political tones. Ferreira Gullar and Manoel de Barros are two highly admired poets and the former has also been nominated for the Nobel Prize, while Fagundes Telles is the first Brazilian woman to be nominated for the Nobel.

== Visual arts ==
===Painting and sculpture===
The oldest known examples of Brazilian art are cave paintings in Serra da Capivara National Park in the state of Piauí, dating back to c. 13,000 BC. In Minas Gerais and Goiás have been found more recent examples showing geometric patterns and animal forms. One of the most sophisticated kinds of Pre-Columbian artefact found in Brazil is the sophisticated Marajoara pottery (c. 800–1400 AD), from cultures flourishing on Marajó Island and around the region of Santarém, and statuettes and cult objects, such as the small carved-stone amulets called muiraquitãs, also belong to these cultures. Many of the Jesuits worked in Brazil under the influence of the Baroque, the dominant style in Brazil until the early 19th century. The Baroque in Brazil flourished in Bahia and Pernambuco and Minas Gerais, generating valuable artists like Manuel da Costa Ataíde and especially the sculptor-architect Aleijadinho.In 1816, the French Artistic Mission in Brazil created the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts and imposed a new concept of artistic education and was the basis for a revolution in Brazilian painting, sculpture, architecture, graphic arts, and crafts. A few decades later, under the personal patronage of Emperor Dom Pedro II, who was engaged in an ambitious national project of modernization, the Academy reached its &quot;golden age&quot;, fostering the emergence of the first generation of Romantic painters, whence Victor Meirelles and Pedro Américo, that, among others, produced lasting visual symbols of national identity. It must be said that in Brazil Romanticism painting took a peculiar shape, not showing the overwhelming dramaticism, fantasy, violence, or interest in death and the bizarre commonly seen in the European version, and because of its academic and palatial nature all excesses were eschewed.
The beginning of the 20th century saw a struggle between old schools and modernist trends. Important modern artists Anita Malfatti and Tarsila do Amaral were both early pioneers in modern art in the country, and are amongst the better-known figures of the &quot;Anthropophagic Movement&quot;, whose goal was to &quot;swallow&quot; modernity from Europe and the US and &quot;digest&quot; it into a genuinely Brazilian modernity. Both participated in The Week of Modern Art festival, held in São Paulo in 1922, that renewed the artistic and cultural environment of the city and also presented artists such as Emiliano Di Cavalcanti, Vicente do Rego Monteiro, and Victor Brecheret. Based on Brazilian folklore, many artists have committed themselves to mixing it with the proposals of the European Expressionism, Cubism, and Surrealism. From Surrealism, arises Ismael Nery, concerned with metaphysical subjects where their pictures appear on imaginary scenarios and averse to any recognizable reference. In the next generation, the modernist ideas of the Week of Modern Art have affected a moderate modernism that could enjoy the freedom of the strict academic agenda, with more features of conventional method, best exemplified by the artist Candido Portinari, which was the official artist of the government in mid-century.

In recent years, names such as Oscar Araripe, Beatriz Milhazes and Romero Britto have been well acclaimed.

===Architecture===
Brazilian architecture in the colonial period was heavily influenced by the Portuguese Manueline style, albeit adapted for the tropical climate. A UNESCO World Heritage Site, the city of Ouro Preto in the state of Minas Gerais contains numerous well-preserved examples of this style by artists such as Aleijadinho.

In later centuries, Brazilian architects were increasingly influenced by schools from other countries such as France and the United States, eventually developing a style of their own that has become known around the world. Architects such as Oscar Niemeyer have received much acclaim, with the Brazilian capital Brasília being the most notable example of modern Brazilian architecture. Niemeyer received the Pritzker Architecture Prize in 1988, and in 2006 the prize was awarded to Brazilian architect Paulo Mendes da Rocha.

In recent decades, Brazilian landscape architecture has also attracted some attention, particularly in the person of Roberto Burle Marx. Some of this notable works are the Copacabana promenade in Rio de Janeiro and the Ibirapuera Park in São Paulo.

=== Photography ===
Chichico Alkmim was a pioneer of photography in rural Minas Gerais in the early 20th century. Hildegard Rosenthal was a pioneering photojournalist in São Paulo whose photographs from the 1940s have been widely exhibited and published. Sebastião Salgado is a black and white photographer, known for &quot;Genesis&quot; and the documentary about his life, &quot; The Salt of the Earth&quot;. Vik Muniz photographs his art made of unconventional materials, such as peanut butter and jelly. Cássio Vasconcellos, Miguel Rio Branco, and Claudia Andujar are associated photojournalism, associated with aerial photography, social criticism, and anthropology, respectively.

==Cinema and theater==

=== Cinema ===

Cinema has a long tradition in Brazil, reaching back to the birth of the medium in the late 19th century, and gaining a new level of international acclaim in recent years. &quot;Limite&quot;, written and directed by Mário Peixoto, was an avant-garde silent film first screened in 1931. , embodied by films such as and (&quot;Black God, White Devil&quot;), was a film genre and movement in the 1960s and 1970s that emphasized social equality and intellectualism.

The documentary film &quot;Bus 174&quot; (2002), by José Padilha, about a bus hijacking, is the highest-rated foreign film at Rotten Tomatoes. &quot;O Pagador de Promessas&quot; (1962), directed by Anselmo Duarte, won the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 1962 Cannes Film Festival, the only Brazilian film to date to win the award.

Fernando Meirelles&#x27; &quot;City of God&quot; (2002), is the highest rated Brazilian film on the IMDb Top 250 list and was selected by &quot;Time&quot; magazine as one of the 100 best films of all-time in 2005. The highest-grossing film in Brazilian cinema, taking 12 million viewers to cinemas, is &quot;Dona Flor and Her Two Husbands&quot; (1976), directed by Bruno Barreto and based on the novel of the same name by Jorge Amado. Acclaimed Brazilian filmmakers include Glauber Rocha, Fernando Meirelles, José Padilha, Anselmo Duarte, Eduardo Coutinho, Alberto Cavalcanti, and Walter Salles; the latest directed &quot;Central Station&quot; (1998), starring Fernanda Montenegro, whose performance earned her international critical acclaim and a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress (becoming the first and to date only Brazilian actress to ever be nominated in the lead actress category).

=== Theater ===
Theater was introduced by the Jesuits during the colonization, particularly by Father Joseph of Anchieta, but did not attract much interest until the transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil in 1808. Over the 18th century, theatre evolved alongside the blossoming literature traditions with names such as Martins Pena and Gonçalves Dias. Pena introduced the comedy of manners, which would become a distinct mark of Brazilian theatre over the next decades.

The theatre was not included in the 1922 Modern Art Week of São Paulo, which marked the beginning of Brazilian Modernism, but Oswald de Andrade&#x27;s O Rei da Vela written in the 1930s would become the manifesto of the Tropicalismo movement in the 1960s.

The 1956 premier of &quot;Orfeu da Conceição&quot; by Vinicius de Moraes, with compositions from Antônio Carlos Jobim and a cast drawn from Abdias do Nascimento&#x27;s Teatro Experimental do Negro, was a landmark event in Brazilian culture. In the 1960s, many playwrights, such as Gianfrancesco Guarnieri, Augusto Boal, Dias Gomes, Oduvaldo Vianna Filho and Plínio Marcos, used theatre as a means of opposing the military regime. With the end of the military regime and the end of censorship in the 1980s, theatre would again grow in themes and styles.

Contemporary names include Gerald Thomas, Ulysses Cruz, Aderbal Freire-Filho, Eduardo Tolentino de Araújo, Cacá Rosset, Gabriel Villela, Márcio Vianna, Moacyr Góes and Antônio Araújo.

==Music==
Music is one of the most instantly recognizable elements of Brazilian culture. Many different genres and styles have emerged in Brazil, such as samba, pagode, sertanejo, brega, bossa nova, MPB, frevo, forró, maracatu and axé.

===Samba===
Samba is among the most popular music genres in Brazil and is widely regarded as the country&#x27;s national musical style. It developed from the mixture of European and African music, brought by slaves in the colonial period and originated in the state of Bahia. In the early 20th century, modern samba emerged and was popularized in Rio de Janeiro behind composers such as Noel Rosa, Cartola and Nelson Cavaquinho among others. The movement later spread and gained notoriety in other regions, particularly in Bahia and São Paulo. Contemporary artists include Martinho da Vila, Zeca Pagodinho and Paulinho da Viola.

Samba makes use of a distinct set of instruments, among the most notable are the cuíca, a friction drum that creates a high-pitched squeaky sound, the cavaquinho, a small instrument of the guitar family, and the pandeiro, a hand frame drum. Other instruments are the surdos, agogôs, chocalhos and tamborins.

===Choro===
Choro originated in the 19th century through interpretations of European genres such as polka and schottische by Brazilian artists who had already been influenced by African rhythms such as the batuque. It is a largely instrumental genre that shares several characteristics with samba. Choro gained popularity around the start of the 20th century (1880-1920) and was the genre of many of the first Brazilian records in the first decades of the 20th century. Notable Choro musicians of that era include Chiquinha Gonzaga, Pixinguinha and Joaquim Callado. The popularity of choro steadily waned after the popularization of samba but saw a revival in recent decades and remains appreciated by a large number of Brazilians. There are several acclaimed Choro artists nowadays such as Altamiro Carrilho, Yamandu Costa and Paulo Bellinati.

===Bossa nova and MPB===

Bossa nova is a style of Brazilian music that originated in the late 1950s. It has its roots on samba but features less percussion, employing instead a distinctive and percussive guitar pattern. Bossa nova gained mainstream popularity in Brazil in 1958 with the song Chega de Saudade, written by Antônio Carlos Jobim and Vinícius de Moraes. Together with João Gilberto, Jobim and Moraes would become the driving force of the genre, which gained worldwide popularity with the song &quot;Garota de Ipanema&quot; as interpreted by Gilberto, his wife Astrud and Stan Getz on the album Getz/Gilberto. The bossa nova genre remains popular in Brazil, particularly among the upper classes and in the Southeast.

MPB (an acronym for &quot;Música popular brasileira&quot;, or Brazilian Popular Music) was a trend in Brazilian music that emerged after the bossa nova boom. It presents many variations and includes elements of styles that range from Samba to Rock music.

=== Tropicalismo ===
In the 1960s some MPB artists founded the short-lived but highly influential Tropicália or Tropicalismo movement, which attracted international attention. Among those were Caetano Veloso, Gilberto Gil, Gal Costa, Jorge Mautner, Tom Zé, Nara Leão, Ney Matogrosso, Rita Lee, and Os Mutantes. Although the movement was rooted in music, it also found expression in film, theater, poetry, and politics.

===Sertanejo===

Sertanejo is the most popular genre in Brazilian mainstream media since the 1990s. It evolved from música caipira over the 20th century, a style of music that originated in Brazilian countryside and that made use of the viola caipira, although it presents nowadays a heavy influence from American country music but resembles in many ways including writing style with Pimba Music of Portugal. Beginning in the 1980s, Brazil saw an intense massification of the sertanejo genre in mainstream media and an increased interest in the phonographic industry. As a result, sertanejo is today the most popular music genre in Brazil in terms of radio play. Common instruments in contemporary sertanejo are the acoustic guitar, which often replaces the viola, the accordion and the harmonica, as well as electric guitar, bass and drums. Traditional acts include Chitãozinho &amp; Xororó, Zezé Di Camargo &amp; Luciano, Leonardo and Daniel. Newer artists such as Michel Teló, Luan Santana, Gusttavo Lima have also become very popular recently among younger audiences.

===Forró and frevo===

Forró and Frevo are two music and dance forms originated in the Brazilian Northeast. Forró, like Choro, originated from European folk genres such as the schottische between the 19th and early 20th centuries. It remains a very popular music style, particularly in the Northeast region, and is danced in &quot;forrobodós&quot; (parties and balls) throughout the country.

Frevo originated in Recife, Pernambuco during the Carnival, the period it is most often associated with. While the music presents elements of procession and martial marches, the frevo dance (known as &quot;passo&quot;) has been notably influenced by capoeira. Frevo parades are a key tradition of the Pernambuco Carnival.

===Classical music===

Brazil has also a tradition of the classical music, since the 18th Century. The oldest composer with a fully documented work is José Maurício Nunes Garcia, a Catholic priest who wrote numerous pieces, both sacred and secular, with a style resembling the classical Viennese style from Mozart and Haydn. In the 19th century, the composer Antonio Carlos Gomes wrote several operas with Brazilian indigenous themes, with librettos in Italian, some of which premiered in Milan; two of the works are the operas Il Guarany and Lo Schiavo (The Slave).

In the 20th century, Brazil had a strong modernist and nationalist movement, with the works of internationally renowned composers like Heitor Villa-Lobos, Camargo Guarnieri, César Guerra-Peixe and Cláudio Santoro, and more recently Marlos Nobre and Osvaldo Lacerda. Many famous performers are also from Brazil, such as the opera singer Bidu Sayão, the pianist Nelson Freire and the former pianist and now conductor João Carlos Martins.

The city of São Paulo hosts the Sala São Paulo, home of the São Paulo State Symphony Orchestra (OSESP), one of the most outstanding concert halls in the world. Also the city of Campos do Jordão hosts yearly in June the Classical Winter Festival, with performances of many instrumentists and singers from all over the world.

===Other genres===
Many other genres have originated in Brazil, especially in recent years. Some of the most notable are:

*The mangue beat movement, originated in Recife and founded by the late Chico Science and Nação Zumbi. The music fuses elements of maracatu, frevo, funk rock and hip hop.
*Axé is a very popular genre, particularly in the state of Bahia. It is a fusion of Afro-Caribbean rhythms and is strongly associated with the Salvador Carnival.
*Maracatu is another genre that originated in the state of Pernambuco. It evolved from traditions passed by generations of African slaves and features large percussive groups and choirs.
*Brega which means &#x27;Tacky&#x27; is a hard-to-define music style from the state of Pará, usually characterized as influenced by Caribbean rhythms and containing simple rhymes, arrangements and a strong sentimental appeal. It has spawned subgenres such as tecno brega, which has attracted worldwide interest for achieving high popularity without significant support from the phonographic industry.
*Brazilian rock
*Brazilian gaucho music
*Brazilian thrash metal
*Punk in Brazil
*Funk

==Dances==

* Chula
* Vanerão
* Brazilian Zouk
* Carimbó
* Frevo
* Lambada
* Lundu
* Maculelê
* Maxixe
* Samba
** Samba de Gafieira
* Suscia
* Xaxado
* Forró
* Hip-Hop

==Popular culture==
===Television===

Television has played a large role in the formation of the contemporary Brazilian popular culture. It was introduced in 1950 by Assis Chateaubriand and remains the country&#x27;s most important element of mass media.

Telenovelas are a marking feature in Brazilian television, usually being broadcast in prime time on most major television networks. Telenovelas are similar in concept to soap operas in English-speaking countries but differ from them in duration, with telenovelas being significantly shorter (usually about 100 to 200 episodes). They are widely watched throughout the country, to the point that they have been described as a significant element in national identity and unity, and have been exported to over 120 countries.

===Folklore===

Brazilian folklore includes many stories, legends, dances, superstitions and religious rituals. Characters include the Boitatá, the Boto Cor-de-Rosa, the Saci and the Bumba Meu Boi, which has spawned the famous June festival in Northern and Northeastern Brazil. Pisadeira, Headless Mule, White Lady, among others, are popular in São Paulo and the Southeast of the country. Saci Day is also commemorated in the country, mainly in São Paulo state.

== Social media ==
Social media in Brazil is the use of social networking applications in this South American nation. This is due to economic growth and the increasing availability of computers and smartphones. Brazil is the world&#x27;s second-largest user of Twitter (at 41.2 million tweeters), and the largest market for YouTube outside the United States. In 2012, average time spent on Facebook increased 208% while global use declined by 2%. In 2013, Brazil ranked the second highest number of Facebook users globally at 65 million. During this period, social media users in Brazil spent an average 9.7 hours a month online.

==Sports==

Football is the most popular sport in Brazil. Many Brazilian players such as Pelé, Ronaldo, Kaká, Ronaldinho, and Neymar are among the most well-known players in the sport. The Brazil national football team (&quot;Seleção&quot;) is currently among the best in the world, according to the FIFA World Rankings. They have been victorious in the FIFA World Cup a record five times, in 1958, 1962, 1970, 1994, and 2002.

Basketball, volleyball, auto racing, and martial arts also attract large audiences. Tennis, surfing, skateboarding, swimming, and gymnastics have found a growing sporting number of enthusiasts over the last decades. Some sports variations have their origins in Brazil. Beach football, futsal (official version of indoor football), and footvolley emerged in the country as variations of football.

In martial arts, Brazilians have developed capoeira, vale tudo, and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. In auto racing, Brazilian drivers have won the Formula One World Championship eight times: Emerson Fittipaldi in 1972 and 1974; Nelson Piquet in 1981, 1983, and 1987; and Ayrton Senna in 1988, 1990, and 1991.

Brazil has undertaken the organization of large-scale sporting events: the country organized and hosted the 1950 FIFA World Cup, and the 2014 FIFA World Cup event. The circuit located in São Paulo, called Autódromo José Carlos Pace, hosts the annual Grand Prix of Brazil.

São Paulo organized the IV Pan American Games in 1963, and Rio de Janeiro hosted the XV Pan American Games in 2007. Brazil also tried for the fourth time to host the Summer Olympics with Rio de Janeiro candidature in 2016. On October 2, 2009, Rio de Janeiro was selected to host the 2016 Summer Olympics, which was the first held in South America.

==Family and social class==

As a society with strong traditional values, the family in Brazil is usually represented by the couple and their children. Extended family is also an important aspect with strong ties being often maintained. Accompanying a world trend, the structure of the Brazilian family has seen major changes over the past few decades with the reduction of average size and increase in single-parent, dual-worker and remarried families. The family structure has become less patriarchal and women are more independent, although gender disparity is still evident in wage difference.

Brazil inherited a highly traditional and stratified class structure from its colonial period with deep inequality. In recent decades, the emergence of a large middle class has contributed to increase social mobility and alleviating income disparity, but the situation remains grave. Brazil ranks 54th among world countries by Gini index.

According to the anthropologist Alvaro Jarrin, &quot;The body is a key aspect of sociability in Brazilian society because it communicates a person&#x27;s social standing. Those with the resources and time to become beautiful will undoubtedly do so. Members of the upper-middle class use the phrase &#x27;gente bonita&#x27; or &#x27;beautiful people&#x27; as a euphemism for the people with whom they consider it appropriate to associate oneself. An up-and-coming locale, for instance, is not valued by its price of admission or its fare, but rather by the amount of &#x27;gente bonita&#x27; who frequent it. The imbrication of race and class in Brazil produces this upper-middle class as normatively white, excluding a majority of the Brazilian population from beauty. Afro-textured hair is portrayed as &#x27;bad hair&#x27;, and a nose considered wider and non-European is also described as a &#x27;poor person&#x27;s nose&#x27;. The physical features that are aesthetically undesirable mark certain bodies as inferior in the relatively rigid Brazilian social pyramid, undeserving of social recognition and full citizenship within the nation ... Since the body is considered to be infinitely malleable, a person who climbs the social ladder is expected to transform their body to conform to upper-middle-class standards. The working class is willing to spend on beauty not as a form of conspicuous consumption, but rather because it perceives beauty as an essential requirement for social inclusion.&quot;

===Social customs===
In Brazilian culture, living in a community is vital due to the fact Brazilians are very involved with one another. &quot;Brazilians organize their lives around and about others, maintain a high level of social involvement, and consider personal relations of primary importance in all human interactions. Being with others is so important that they are rarely alone and perceive the desire to be alone as a sign of depression or unhappiness.&quot; Due to the fact Brazilians are highly involved with social life, many friends, family members, or business partners join together to associate.Although friend and family relationships have a large impact on Brazilian culture, business relationships are also crucial. &quot;As Brazilians depend heavily on relationships with others, it is essential to spend time getting to know, both personally and professionally, your Brazilian counterparts. One of the most important elements in Brazilian business culture is personal relationships.&quot; Brazilians maintain a comfortable business atmosphere by being respectful and using the correct greeting.

Upon greeting, Brazilians often express themselves physically. Women usually kiss the other individual on both cheeks and men give a pat on the back. Friendly gestures are used to greet one another. It is common for them to refer to the individual&#x27;s social standing and then their first name when engaging in conversation. When Brazilians speak with an individual older than them, they address them as &quot;senhor&quot; (Mister) or &quot;senhora&quot; (Miss), accompanied by the individual&#x27;s first name. In Brazil, the general rule is to use a formal greeting when communicating with people who are unfamiliar or older.

==Beauty==
According to the anthropologist Alvaro Jarrin, &quot;Beauty is constantly lived, breathed and incorporated as a social category in southeastern Brazil. The talk of beauty is pervasive in all kinds of media, from television to song lyrics, and it is a daily concern of people of all incomes and backgrounds. Remarking about a person&#x27;s appearance is not only socially permissible, it is equivalent to inquiring about that person&#x27;s health and showing concern for them. If a person does not look his or her best, then many Brazilians assume the person must be sick or going through emotional distress.&quot; Vanity does not carry a negative connotation, as it does in many other places. The average weight of a Brazilian woman is 62 kilos (137 lbs), as opposed to 75 kilos (166 lbs) in the United States and 68 kilos (152 lbs) in the United Kingdom.

Brazil has more plastic surgeon per capita than anywhere else in the world. In 2001, there were 350,000 cosmetic surgery operations in a population of 170 million. This is an impressive number for a nation where sixty per cent of the working population earns less than 150 U.S. dollars per month. In 2007 alone, Brazilians spent US$22 billion on hygiene and cosmetic products making the country the third largest consumer of cosmetic products in the world. 95% of Brazilian women want to change their bodies and the majority will seriously consider going under the knife. The pursuit of beauty is so high on the agenda for Brazilian women that new research shows they spend 11 times more of their annual income on beauty products (compared to UK and US women). Brazil has recently emerged as one of the leading global destinations for medical tourism. Brazilians are no strangers to cosmetic surgery, undergoing hundreds of thousands of procedures a year, by all socio-economic levels as well.The general attitude in Brazil toward cosmetic surgery borders on reverence. Expressions such as &quot;the power of the scalpels&quot;, &quot;the magic of cosmetic surgeries&quot;, and the &quot;march toward scientific progress&quot; are seen and heard everywhere. Whereas cosmetic surgery in the U.S. or Europe is still seen as a private matter, and one that is slightly embarrassing or at least socially awkward, in Brazil surgeries are very public matters. To have plastic surgery is to show that you have the money to afford it. In Brazil, modifying one&#x27;s body through surgery is about more than just becoming more beautiful and desirable. It is even about more than showing that you care about yourself, which is a phrase in the Brazilian mass media. Surgical transformations are naturalized as necessary enhancements. Instead, modifying your body in Brazil is fundamentally about displaying your wealth. But since much is associated with race, changing one&#x27;s body is also about approximating whiteness. An April 2013 article in &quot;The Economist&quot; noted that &quot;[looking white] still codes for health, wealth and status. Light-skinned women strut São Paulo&#x27;s upmarket shopping malls in designer clothes; dark-skinned maids in uniform walk behind with their bags and babies. Black and mixed-race Brazilians earn three-fifths as much as white ones. They are twice as likely to be illiterate or in prison, and less than half as likely to go to university. ... The unthinking prejudice expressed in common phrases such as &#x27;good appearance&#x27; (meaning pale-skinned) and &#x27;good hair&#x27; (not frizzy) means many light-skinned Brazilians have long preferred to think of themselves as &#x27;white&#x27;, whatever their parentage.&quot;There are marking differences between perceptions of beauty among working-class patients in public hospitals, and upper-middle class patients in private clinics. Plastic surgery is conceptualized by the upper-middle class mainly as an act of consumption that fosters distinction and reinforces the value of whiteness. In contrast, working-class patients describe plastic surgery as a basic necessity that provides the &quot;good appearance&quot; needed in the job market and &quot;repairs&quot; their bodies from the wear of their physical labour as workers and as mothers. Patients from different walks of life desire plastic surgery for different reasons.

The idea that physical appearance can denote class, with the implication that modifications in one&#x27;s physical appearance can be seen as markers of social status extends throughout Brazil. Put within a context of explicit social inequality, the link between the production of beauty and social class becomes quite evident. Brazilians place heavy importance on beauty aesthetics; a study in 2007 revealed that 87% of all Brazilians seek to look stylish at all times, as opposed to the global average of 47%. The body is understood in southeastern Brazil as having a crucial aesthetic value, a value that is never fixed but can be accrued through discipline and medical intervention. This &#x27;investment&#x27; in the body is nearly always equated with health because a person&#x27;s well-being is assumed to be visible on the surface of their body. One of the most common (and harshest) expressions about beauty in Brazil is &quot;There are really no ugly people, there are only poor people.&quot;

<text>Tevfik Esenç (; 1904 – 7 October 1992) was a Turkish citizen of Ubykh origin, known for being the last speaker of the Ubykh language. He was fluent in Ubykh, Adyghe and Turkish. After his death in 1992, the Ubykh language went extinct despite the efforts and work of numerous linguists to revive it. Nevertheless, Esenç is single-handedly responsible for the world&#x27;s current knowledge of Ubykh language and culture being as extensive and detailed as it is.

==Biography==

Esenç was raised by his Ubykh-speaking grandparents for a time in the village of Hacıosman (Ubykh: &quot;Lek&#x27;uaşüa /lɜkʷʼɐ́ɕʷɜ/&quot;; Adyghe: &quot;Hundjahabl&quot;) in Turkey, and he served a term as the &quot;muhtar&quot; (mayor) of that village, before receiving a post in the civil service of Istanbul. There, he was able to do a great deal of work with the French linguist Georges Dumézil and his associate Georges Charachidzé to help record his language, although not all the writings of Charachidzé (1930–2010) have been published. Others who met Esenç and produced work on Ubykh are: the Norwegian Hans Vogt (1911–92); the British George Hewitt, who made recordings with Esenç in Istanbul; the Abkhazian Viacheslav Chirikba, who has written on Ubykh settlements and Ubykh surnames; and the Turkish linguist A. Sumru Özsoy.

Having an excellent memory and understanding quickly the goals of Dumézil and the other linguists who came to visit him, he was a primary source of not only the Ubykh language, but also of the mythology, culture history, and customs of the Ubykh people. He spoke Turkish and Ubykh, and also a dialect of Adyghe (West Circassian), allowing some comparative work to be done between these two members of the Northwest Caucasian family. A purist, his idiolect of Ubykh was considered by Dumézil as the closest thing to a standard &quot;literary&quot; Ubykh language that existed.

He finished his work for Ubykh with the following speech to his long-time collaborator Georges Charachidzé:

Esenç died in the night of 7 October 1992, at the age of 88; he was buried in the village cemetery of Hacıosman, his birthplace, alongside his wife Emine. He was survived by three sons and two daughters.

In 1994, A. Sumru Özsoy organized an international conference, namely Conference on Northwest Caucasian Linguistics, at Boğaziçi University in memory of Dumézil and Esenç.

<doc id="311078" wikidata="Q1127337" url="?curid=311078" title="Battle of Mons Graupius">
<text>The Battle of Mons Graupius was, according to Tacitus, a Roman military victory in what is now Scotland, taking place in AD 83 or, less probably, 84. The exact location of the battle is a matter of debate. Historians have long questioned some details of Tacitus&#x27;s account of the fight, suggesting that he exaggerated Roman success.

== Background ==
Tacitus states that Gnaeus Julius Agricola, who was the Roman governor and Tacitus&#x27;s father-in-law, had sent his fleet ahead to panic the Caledonians, and, with light infantry reinforced with British auxiliaries, reached the site, which he found occupied by the enemy.

Even though the Romans were outnumbered in their campaign against the tribes of Britain, they often had difficulty getting their foes to face them in open battle. The Caledonii were the last unconquered British tribe (and were never entirely subdued). After many years of avoiding the fight, the Caledonians were forced to join battle when the Romans marched on the main granaries of the Caledonians, just as they had been filled from the harvest. The Caledonians had no choice but to fight or starve over the next winter.

==Location==
The Battle of Mons Graupius has been a constant motif in the study of Roman Scotland. In the 19th century, it was identified with almost every principal Roman site in Perth and Kinross from Dalginross to Blairgowrie. With the advent of aerial photography and the interpretation of crop markings in the 20th century, the focus has moved to the north-east and a series of marching camps en route to the Moray coast. This has given rise to the belief that the battle occurred in Aberdeenshire at the foot of Bennachie, a very distinctive hill just south of a large marching camp at Logie Durno.

Considerable debate and analysis have been conducted regarding the battle location, with the locus of most of these sites spanning Perthshire to the north of the River Dee, all in the northeast of Scotland. A number of authors have reckoned the battle to have occurred in the Grampian Mounth within sight of the North Sea. In particular, Roy, Watt, Hogan and others have advanced notions that the high ground of the battle may have been Kempstone Hill, Megray Hill or other knolls near the Raedykes Roman Camp.

Those sites in Aberdeenshire fit the historical descriptions of Tacitus and have also yielded archaeological finds related to Roman presence. In addition, these points of high ground are proximate to the Elsick Mounth, an ancient trackway used by Romans and Caledonians for military manoeuvres. Bennachie in Aberdeenshire, the Gask Ridge not far from Perth, and Sutherland have also been suggested.

Historic Environment Scotland noted the uncertainty of the location as the reason for its exclusion from the Inventory of Historic Battlefields in Scotland.

==Battle==
According to Tacitus, 8,000 allied auxiliary infantry formed the centre, while 3,000 cavalry were on the flanks, with the Roman legionaries as a reserve in front of their camp. Estimates for the size of the Roman army range from 17,000 to 30,000; although Tacitus says that 11,000 auxiliaries were engaged, along with a further four squadrons of cavalry, the number of legionaries in reserve is uncertain. The Caledonian army, which Tacitus claims was led by Calgacus (but only mentions him as giving a speech, probably fictitious), was said to be over 30,000 strong. It was stationed mostly on higher ground; its front ranks were on the level ground, but the other ranks rose in tiers, up the slope of the hill in a horseshoe formation. The Caledonian chariotry charged about on the level plain between the two armies.

After a brief exchange of missiles, Agricola ordered auxiliaries to launch a frontal attack on the enemy. These were based around four cohorts of Batavians and two cohorts of Tungri swordsmen. The Caledonians were cut down and trampled on the lower slopes of the hill. Those at the top attempted an outflanking movement but were themselves outflanked by Roman cavalry. The Caledonians were then comprehensively routed and fled for the shelter of nearby woodland, but were relentlessly pursued by well-organised Roman units.

It is said that the Roman Legions took no part in the battle, being held in reserve throughout. According to Tacitus, 10,000 Caledonian people died at a cost of only 360 auxiliary troops. 20,000 Caledonians retreated into the woods, where they fared considerably better against pursuing forces. Roman scouts were unable to locate the remaining Caledonian forces the next morning.

In the version of the battle by Hector Boece, which might be drawn from now-lost local sources, it was a hard and closely-fought battle, in which, 

==Criticisms of Tacitus&#x27;s account==
The decisive victory reported by Tacitus has been criticized by some historians, however, who believe no engagement occurred. One author has suggested that the emperor Domitian may have been informed of the fraudulence of Agricola&#x27;s claims to have won a significant victory. Despite these claims, Agricola was awarded triumphal honours and was offered another governorship in a different part of the empire, so it would seem unlikely Domitian doubted he had achieved substantial successes. Suggestions that he invented the entire episode and was thereafter shunned by the emperor do not seem likely, given that he was awarded honours on his return.

==Aftermath==
Following this final battle, it was proclaimed that Agricola had finally subdued all the tribes of Britain. Soon afterwards he was recalled to Rome, and his post passed to Sallustius Lucullus. It is likely that Rome intended to continue the conflict, but that military requirements elsewhere in the empire necessitated a troop withdrawal and the opportunity was lost.

Tacitus&#x27; statement in his account of Roman history between 68 AD and 98 AD: &quot;Perdomita Britannia et statim missa&quot; (Britain was completely conquered and immediately let go), denotes his bitter disapproval of Domitian&#x27;s failure to unify the whole island under Roman rule after Agricola&#x27;s successful campaign.

<doc id="311079" wikidata="Q262742" url="?curid=311079" title="Hilary Benn">
<text>Hilary James Wedgwood Benn (born 26 November 1953) is a British politician who has served as Secretary of State for Northern Ireland since 2024. A member of the Labour Party, he has been the Member of Parliament (MP) for Leeds South, formerly Leeds Central, since 1999. He previously served in various ministerial positions under Prime Ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown from 2001 to 2010.

Born in Hammersmith, London, he is the second son of veteran Labour MP Tony Benn and educationalist Caroline Benn. He studied Russian and Eastern European Studies at the University of Sussex and went on to work as a policy researcher for two trade unions, ASTMS and MSF. Benn was elected as a councillor on Ealing Borough Council in 1979 and was Deputy Leader of the Council from 1986 to 1990. He was also the unsuccessful Labour parliamentary candidate for the Ealing North constituency at both the 1983 and 1987 general elections. Following the 1997 general election, Benn was appointed a special adviser to Education Secretary David Blunkett before winning a by-election in Leeds Central in 1999.

Under Tony Blair, Benn served as a Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for International Development from 2001 to 2002 and for Prisons and Probation from 2002 to 2003. He returned to the Department for International Development as a Minister of State in May 2003. In October 2003, he was appointed to Blair&#x27;s Cabinet as Secretary of State for International Development. In 2007, Benn was a candidate for Deputy Leader of the Labour Party, but lost to Harriet Harman, finishing in fourth place. Benn later served under Gordon Brown as Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs from 2007 to 2010.

Benn returned to opposition following the 2010 general election and became Shadow Environment Secretary in the First Shadow Cabinet of Harriet Harman. Under Ed Miliband, Benn was the Shadow Leader of the House of Commons from 2010 to 2011, and Shadow Communities and Local Government Secretary from 2011 to 2015. After the 2015 general election, Benn became the interim Shadow Foreign Secretary under Harriet Harman before he was reappointed to the role under Jeremy Corbyn. He was dismissed from the position in 2016 after he expressed no confidence in Corbyn&#x27;s leadership. On the backbenches, he was Chair of the Committee on the Future Relationship with the European Union from 2016 to 2021. He returned to the Shadow Cabinet as Shadow Secretary of State for Northern Ireland under Keir Starmer in the 2023 British shadow cabinet reshuffle. Following Labour&#x27;s victory in the 2024 general election, Benn was appointed Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in the Starmer ministry.

==Early life and education==
Hilary Benn was born on 26 November 1953 in Hammersmith. He is the second son of former Labour Cabinet Minister Tony Benn and American-born educationalist Caroline Benn (&quot;née&quot; DeCamp). Benn is a fourth-generation MP – his father, his paternal grandfather Lord Stansgate, and his great-grandfathers Daniel Holmes and Sir John Benn were all Members of Parliament, mostly supporting the Liberal Party.

Benn was educated at Norland Place School and Westminster Under School, both prep schools in London, and then at Holland Park School, a state comprehensive secondary school. He studied Russian and Eastern European Studies at the University of Sussex, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in 1974.

Benn has an older brother, Stephen, a younger sister Melissa and younger brother, Joshua. Reflecting on his upbringing, he said: &quot;I grew up in a household where we talked about the state of the world over breakfast, when we ate at night, and all points in between&quot;.

==Early political career==
After graduation, Benn became a research officer with ASTMS. During the 1975 referendum on British membership of the European Economic Community, he served on the research team for the National Referendum Campaign, which argued for a No vote.

In 1980, he was seconded to the Labour Party to act as a joint secretary to the finance panel of the Labour Party Commission of Inquiry. In 1979, he was elected to Ealing Borough Council where he served as deputy leader from 1986 to 1990.

He was the Labour Party candidate for Ealing North at the 1983 and 1987 general elections. On both occasions he was defeated by the Conservative candidate Harry Greenway. Reflecting on the defeat at the 1983 general election, Benn said: &quot;That was a formative experience for me because we went out on the doorstep and we didn&#x27;t win the public&#x27;s confidence. It made me very uncomfortable. Personally, that left a mark on me.&quot; At the 1983 general election, Benn won 32.8% of the vote, and four years later won 27.8% of the vote.

Benn applied to become head of Labour Party research under the leadership of John Smith, but was unsuccessful. In 1993 he became Head of Policy for Manufacturing Science and Finance. At the 1997 general election, he was on the shortlist for the seat of Pontefract and Castleford, but eventually lost to Yvette Cooper. Following the 1997 general election, Benn served as a special adviser to David Blunkett, then the Secretary of State for Education and Employment.

==Parliamentary career==
In 1999, Benn was selected as the Labour candidate for a by-election in Leeds Central following the untimely death of Foreign Office Minister Derek Fatchett at the age of 53 years old. During the by-election campaign, he described himself as &quot;a Benn, but not a Bennite&quot;.

Benn won the Leeds Central by-election on 10 June 1999 following a turnout of 19.6%, the second-smallest turnout at a by-election since the Second World War; this was beaten in the 2012 Manchester Central by-election which had a mere 18.2% turnout. In response to the poor turnout, he said: &quot;The turnout is very disappointing and in a democracy this is a concern for all of us.&quot; Benn was elected with 48.2% of the vote and a majority of 2,293 votes.

He made his maiden speech in the House of Commons on Wednesday 23 June 1999.

===Early ministerial career (2001–2003)===
Benn was re-elected at the 2001 general election with an increased vote share of 66.9% and an increased majority of 14,381. Following the election, Benn was appointed as a Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Department for International Development. In the 2002 reshuffle, he become the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Prisons and Probation at the Home Office, serving as a deputy to Lord Falconer as Minister of State (Criminal Justice). At the Home Office, he led a task force investigating internet paedophilia, which subsequently recommended the introduction of the new offence of &#x27;grooming&#x27;.

In January 2003, he had responsibility for introducing the Sexual Offences Bill in the House of Commons.

In May 2003, he was moved from the Home Office back to the Department for International Development, where he served as Minister of State. He also acted as the Department&#x27;s Commons spokesperson, as then-Secretary of State for International Development, Baroness Amos, was a member of the House of Lords.

===Secretary of State for International Development (2003–2007)===

In 2003, Benn was promoted to the cabinet from his position as Minister of State to become Secretary of State for International Development, after Baroness Amos was appointed as Leader of the House of Lords. When he informed his family, his father Tony said that &quot;the house rocked with delight&quot;. Following his first Department for International Development (DfID) question time, Benn was criticised by Liberal Democrat international development spokesperson Tom Brake over his comments about opening Iraq up to foreign investors.

&quot;The Guardian&quot; noted that one of Benn&#x27;s main challenges as Secretary of State for International Development would be the &quot;fraught reconstruction of Iraq&quot;. In February 2004, Benn said that restoring security in Iraq would be &quot;absolutely fundamental&quot; to a reconstruction effort.

Benn oversaw the DfID response to the 2003 Bam earthquake, which included &quot;helping to coordinate efforts on the ground, liaise with other international relief organisations and work with the Iranian government to ensure that the right equipment gets to where it is needed as quickly as possible.&quot; He subsequently oversaw the UK&#x27;s response to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, the 2005 Kashmir earthquake and the 2005 Nias–Simeulue earthquake, to which he responded &quot;with skill&quot;.

In July 2004, Benn set out five stages to end the Darfur War that had begun in February 2003. The stages were: &quot;to get help to the people in the camps and elsewhere&quot;, &quot;to get more people and more capacity on the ground to deliver this aid&quot;, &quot;security – urgently&quot;, getting the &quot;government of Sudan... to disarm the militias and provide security to the people&quot; and &quot;Finally, this crisis needs a political solution&quot;.

Benn has also been a critic of the United Nations. In December 2004, he called for reform of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNHCA), and also said that the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) was &quot;supposed to coordinate but does not have the power of resources to do the job properly&quot;. Benn has been credited with helping to found the Central Emergency Response Fund.

At the 2005 general election, Benn was again re-elected, with a decreased vote share of 60% and a decreased majority of 11,866.

On 13 June 2005, he committed an additional £19 million to the African Union security mission in Darfur, bringing the total UK contribution to £32 million. Benn led the UK negotiating team at the 2006 Darfur peace negotiations.

In 2007, the &quot;New Statesman&quot; noted that &quot;Benn&#x27;s work at DfID ... has often been at odds with the Bush administration&quot;. In particular, an example was Benn&#x27;s opposition to the United States policy of increasing abstinence when it came to fighting AIDS in Africa, whereas Benn took a &quot;harm reduction&quot; approach. He was also dismissive of US policy, saying: &quot;Abstinence-only programmes are fine if you want to abstain, but not everybody does.&quot;

====Labour Party Deputy Leadership election, 2007====
In late October 2006, Benn announced that he would be standing in the 2007 Labour Party deputy leadership election. One of his earliest backers was Dennis Skinner, and it was also announced that Ian McCartney would play an important role in his campaign. On 6 December, an open letter was published in &quot;The Guardian&quot; signed by six Labour parliamentarians that said Benn&#x27;s election as Deputy Leader could rebuild a &quot;coalition of trust&quot; in the Labour Party.

In 2007, Benn was the bookmakers&#x27; favourite for the Deputy Leadership of the Labour Party. Early polls in the deputy leadership contest showed him to be the grassroots&#x27; favourite – in a YouGov poll of party members, Benn was top with 27%, followed by Education Secretary Alan Johnson with 18%, Environment Secretary David Miliband with 17%, Justice Minister Harriet Harman with 10%, and Labour Party Chair Hazel Blears with 7%. The contest was launched on 14 May 2007 after the resignation of incumbent deputy leader John Prescott, Benn had some difficulties securing the necessary 45 nominations required to get on the ballot paper but he acquired the support needed to join five other candidates—Hazel Blears, Harriet Harman, Alan Johnson, Peter Hain and backbencher Jon Cruddas. Supporting nominations from constituency Labour parties showed Hilary Benn obtaining 25%, Jon Cruddas 22%, Harriet Harman 19%, Alan Johnson 14%, Hazel Blears 12% and Peter Hain 8% of the constituency parties that voted. The contest closed on Sunday 24 June 2007, with Harriet Harman winning. Benn was eliminated in the third round of voting, having reached 22.33% of the vote. Harman was elected in the fifth round with 50.43% of the vote.

===Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (2007–2010)===
In 2007, Benn was appointed as the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, following the election of Gordon Brown as Party Leader, and the promotion of David Miliband to Foreign Secretary. As Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, he introduced and implemented the UK&#x27;s Climate Change Act 2008. It was also his responsibility as Secretary to respond to the threat to cattle from &quot;Mycobacterium bovis&quot;, colloquially referred to as bovine tuberculosis (TB). The recommended option from the Chief Scientific Advisor until 2007, Sir David King, was a badger cull. In April 2010, a badger cull was announced in Wales, after the high court in Cardiff rejected a legal challenge from The Badger Trust.

During the parliamentary expenses scandal, Benn was picked out by several national newspapers as one of only three senior members of the Labour Party to have not presented expenses beyond reproach. &quot;The Guardian&quot; stated: &quot;When all Westminster MPs&#x27; total expenditures are ranked, Benn&#x27;s bill is the fifteenth least expensive for the taxpayer&quot;.

At the 2010 general election, Benn was again re-elected with a decreased vote share of 49.3% and a decreased majority of 10,645. Following the election, he served as Shadow Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in 2010 during Harriet Harman&#x27;s interim leadership of the Labour Party. In the Shadow Cabinet of Ed Miliband, announced on 8 October 2010, he was appointed Shadow Leader of the House of Commons. When Miliband reshuffled his cabinet on 7 October 2011, he was named Shadow Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government.

===Shadow Foreign Secretary===
At the 2015 general election, Benn was again re-elected, increasing his share of the vote to 55% and increasing his majority to 16,967. Following the election, Benn was named Shadow Foreign Secretary in the Second Shadow Cabinet of Harriet Harman. On 17 June, Benn deputised for Harriet Harman at Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions, when David Cameron was overseas in Europe, and Benn was Harman&#x27;s unofficial deputy. One of the questions he asked challenged George Osborne, who was deputising for Cameron, over whether HMS &quot;Bulwark&quot; was under active review as revealed in a report by &quot;The Guardian&quot;. Writing for the &quot;New Statesman&quot;, George Eaton commended Benn&#x27;s performance, saying: &quot;Benn smartly denied the Chancellor the chance to deploy his favourite attack lines by devoting his six questions to national security and the Mediterranean refugee crisis, rather than the economy.&quot;

In September 2015, both leadership and deputy leadership elections took place in the Labour Party. Benn supported Caroline Flint in the deputy leadership election, and Andy Burnham in the leadership election. Following the election of Jeremy Corbyn as Leader of the Labour Party in September, Benn retained the role of Shadow Foreign Secretary in Corbyn&#x27;s shadow cabinet, and stressed that Labour would campaign to remain in the EU &quot;under all circumstances&quot;. This was later affirmed by a joint statement released by both Benn and Corbyn, which said that &quot;Labour will be campaigning in the referendum for the UK to stay in the European Union.&quot;

On 20 September, Benn signalled that Labour could back Prime Minister David Cameron&#x27;s plans for airstrikes against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) in Syria: &quot;What we&#x27;ve said consistently is that the government, if it has got a proposal, should bring that to the House of Commons. In relation to airstrikes, we shall look at the objectives. At the moment we don&#x27;t know what the proposal is ... We will judge that against the objective, the legal base...&quot; In November 2015, following the Paris attacks that had occurred a few days earlier, Benn initially agreed with Corbyn&#x27;s position rejecting the proposal for Britain to launch airstrikes against ISIL in Syria and any intervention. However, Benn subsequently supported plans laid out by the Prime Minister, and said he would not resign over his disagreement with Corbyn because he was &quot;doing [his] job as the Shadow Foreign Secretary&quot;. Benn had voted in favour of the Iraq War in 2003 and the 2011 military intervention in Libya, but voted against military intervention against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in 2013.
On 2 December 2015, Benn made the closing speech for the official opposition in the House of Commons debate on airstrikes against ISIL in Syria. The speech opposed the position espoused by Corbyn against the government&#x27;s motion. The speech was applauded by MPs on both sides of the house, a gesture not usually permitted in the Commons. Along with a minority of shadow cabinet colleagues, he voted for airstrikes in Syria and the motion passed by a higher-than-expected majority of 174 votes. The Conservative Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond described Benn&#x27;s oration as &quot;one of the truly great speeches in Commons history&quot;. Speaking to the BBC the following day, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell compared Benn&#x27;s speech to that given by Prime Minister Tony Blair in 2003 ahead of the Iraq War. McDonnell described it as an &quot;excellent&quot; piece of oratory, but added: &quot;The greatest oratory can lead us to the greatest mistakes.&quot; According to Labour MP Jamie Reed, following his speech, in the eyes of Corbyn, Benn became &quot;at best a rebel, at worst a traitor.&quot;

In January 2016, Benn criticised British involvement in Saudi Arabian–led intervention in Yemen after a leaked UN report concluded there had been &quot;widespread and systematic&quot; attacks on civilian targets in violation of international humanitarian law.

On 25 June 2016, &quot;The Observer&quot; revealed that Benn &quot;called fellow MPs over the weekend to suggest that he will ask Corbyn to stand down if there is significant support for a move against the leader. He has also asked shadow cabinet colleagues to join him in resigning if the Labour leader ignores that request.&quot; During a phone call in the early hours of 26 June, Benn told Corbyn that Labour MPs and shadow cabinet members had &quot;no confidence in our ability to win the election&quot; under his leadership. Corbyn then dismissed Benn from his position as Shadow Foreign Secretary. In a statement issued at 03:30, Benn said: &quot;It has now become clear that there is widespread concern among Labour MPs and in the shadow cabinet about Jeremy Corbyn&#x27;s leadership of our party. In particular, there is no confidence in our ability to win the next election, which may come much sooner than expected, if Jeremy continues as leader.&quot; Later in the morning, Heidi Alexander, the Shadow Secretary of State for Health, also resigned. Throughout the day, a further eight members of the shadow cabinet resigned.

Benn then supported Owen Smith in the failed attempt to replace Corbyn in the 2016 Labour Party leadership election.

===Select committee chairman===
In September 2016, Benn announced his intention to stand for chairman of the new Exiting the European Union Select Committee, a House of Commons select committee. He stated that his intention was to &quot;get the best deal for the British people&quot;. His bid was supported by former Labour leader Ed Miliband, as well as other senior Labour Party figures including Angela Eagle, Dan Jarvis, and Andy Burnham. His opponent in the bid was Kate Hoey, a fellow Labour MP and a Leave vote supporter. The result, announced on 19 October, was 330 votes to Benn, and 209 to Hoey, so Benn became the new chairman.

At the snap 2017 general election, Benn was again re-elected with an increased vote share of 70.2% and an increased majority of 23,698.

In this position, he supported the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2019 as proposed on a cross-party basis by Labour&#x27;s Yvette Cooper and the Conservatives&#x27; Oliver Letwin to force the Government to ask for an extension of the Article 50 process.

He sponsored the European Union (Withdrawal) (No. 2) Act 2019, consequently also known as the Benn Act, which received Royal assent on 9 September 2019, obliging the Prime Minister to seek a third extension had no agreement been reached at the subsequent European Council meeting in October 2019.

At the 2019 general election, Benn was again re-elected, with a decreased vote share of 61.7% and a decreased majority of 19,270.

===Shadow Secretary of State for Northern Ireland===
Following a reshuffle of the Shadow Cabinet on 4 September 2023, Benn rejoined the frontbench and was appointed Shadow Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.

Benn&#x27;s appointment was welcomed by Doug Beattie, leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, who remarked that &quot;the appointment of an individual with such an extensive political career is an indication of the importance the Labour Party leader places on Northern Ireland&quot;.

Due to the 2023 Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies, Benn&#x27;s constituency of Leeds Central was abolished, and replaced with Leeds South. In June 2024, Benn was selected as the Labour candidate for Leeds South at the 2024 general election.

=== Secretary of State for Northern Ireland ===
At the 2024 general election, Benn was elected to Parliament as MP for Leeds South with 54% of the vote and a majority of 11,279.

Following the Labour Party&#x27;s landslide victory in the general election, Benn was appointed Secretary of State for Northern Ireland by Prime Minister Keir Starmer in formation of the new cabinet. He is one of two cabinet ministers (the other being Douglas Alexander) to serve under three Labour premiers.

In a joint letter with Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport Lisa Nandy, Benn confirmed to Stormont&#x27;s Minister for Communities Gordon Lyons on 13 September 2024 that the government will not be providing funding for the redevelopment of Casement Park in time for the Euro 2028 football tournament. He later declined to state how much money the government might be willing to contribute towards the redevelopment.

Prior to Benn&#x27;s speech at the Labour Party Conference on 23 September 2024, he announced in an interview that the new Independent Commission for Reconciliation and Information Recovery (ICRIR) investigating Troubles killings will not be scrapped. He also defended the government&#x27;s decision to cut winter fuel payments for almost 250,000 pensioners in Northern Ireland, stating that &quot;being in government is about making difficult choices&quot; given the state of public finances.

In November 2024, Benn voted in favour of the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill, which proposes to legalise assisted suicide.

==Personal life==
In 1973, while at university, Benn married fellow student Rosalind Caroline Retey. She died of cancer, aged 26, in 1979. Benn subsequently married Sally Christina Clark in 1982, and the couple have four children.

Like his father, who died in March 2014, he is a teetotaller and vegetarian.

==Awards==
Benn was shortlisted for the Grassroot Diplomat Initiative Award in 2015 for his work on increasing aid at DfID, and remains in the directory of the &quot;Grassroot Diplomat Who&#x27;s Who&quot; publication.

Benn has won the Channel 4 Political Awards Politicians&#x27; Politician 2006, Spectator Parliamentarian of the Year 2016 and the Political Studies Association Parliamentarian of the Year 2019.

<text>Charlotte Mitchell (born Edna Winifred Mitchell; 23 July 1926 – 2 May 2012) was an English actress and poet.

==Biography==
In the 1950s she provided lyrics, sketches, and occasionally acted in revues on London&#x27;s West End. She was especially successful in her ventures providing lyrics for Madeleine Dring in &quot;Airs on a Shoestring&quot; (1953), &quot;Pay the Piper&quot; (1954), and &quot;Fresh Airs&quot; (1956), all productions of Laurier Lister.

She was once (allegedly) the girlfriend of Peter Sellers, and appeared in &quot;The Goon Show&quot; episodes &quot;Ye Bandit of Sherwood Forest&quot; (1954) as Maid Marian and &quot;Tales of Montmartre&quot; (1956) as Seagoon&#x27;s love interest, Fifi. Charlotte Mitchell was married to the actor Philip Guard, from whom she separated in 1968, and was the mother of three children: actors Christopher Guard and Dominic Guard and animator and novelist Candy Guard. Charlotte lived in West London during the later part of her life and continued to be active as a poet.

She appeared on BBC Radio with Ian Carmichael in &quot;The Small, Intricate Life of Gerald C. Potter&quot;. Carmichael played Gerald C. Potter, mystery writer, while she played Diana, his wife, who, under the pseudonym of Miss Magnolia Badminton, wrote romantic novels. She also played, on radio, the Dowager Duchess (Lord Peter Wimsey&#x27;s mother) in the radio adaption of &quot;Strong Poison&quot; that starred Ian Carmichael as Wimsey, and the character of Kath Miller in the BBC Radio 2 daily serial &quot;Waggoners&#x27; Walk&quot;. On television, she played Amy Winthrop the housekeeper in &quot;The Adventures of Black Beauty&quot; (1972–74), and Monica Spencer in &quot;And Mother Makes Five&quot;.

Her poetry was published in collections such as &quot;Twelve Burnt Saucepans&quot;, &quot;Looking Round Dangerously&quot;, &quot;I Want to Go Home&quot; and &quot;Just in Case&quot;. These provided the basis of a series of popular programmes on BBC Radio 4 in which she read her own work. Her poetry is often requested and read on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Poetry Please&quot;, and one of her poems was chosen by Judi Dench and Michael Williams in their joint BBC Radio 4 programme &quot;With Great Pleasure&quot;.

==Death==
Mitchell died in Chiswick, London, on 2 May 2012, aged 85, from pneumonia. She had previously battled breast cancer and myeloma.

<doc id="311092" wikidata="Q703303" url="?curid=311092" title="Paul Kurtz">
<text>Paul Kurtz (December 21, 1925 – October 20, 2012) was an American scientific skeptic and secular humanist. He has been called &quot;the father of secular humanism&quot;. He was Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at the State University of New York at Buffalo, having previously also taught at Vassar, Trinity, and Union colleges, and the New School for Social Research.

Kurtz founded the publishing house Prometheus Books in 1969. He was also the founder and past chairman of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI, formerly the &quot;Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal&quot;, CSICOP), the Council for Secular Humanism, and the Center for Inquiry. He was editor in chief of &quot;Free Inquiry&quot; magazine, a publication of the Council for Secular Humanism.

He was co-chair of the International Humanist and Ethical Union (IHEU) from 1986 to 1994. He was a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Humanist Laureate, president of the International Academy of Humanism and Honorary Associate of Rationalist International. As a member of the American Humanist Association, he contributed to the writing of &quot;Humanist Manifesto II&quot;. He was an editor of &quot;The Humanist&quot;, 1967–78.

Kurtz published over 800 articles or reviews and authored and edited over 50 books. Many of his books have been translated into over 60 languages.

==Early life and education==
Kurtz was born in Newark, New Jersey, into a secular Jewish family, the son of Sara Lasser and Martin Kurtz. Kurtz received his bachelor&#x27;s degree from New York University, and then a master&#x27;s degree and Doctor of Philosophy degree from Columbia University. Kurtz was left-wing in his youth, but has said that serving in the United States Army in World War II taught him the dangers of ideology. He saw the Buchenwald and Dachau concentration camps after they were liberated, and became disillusioned with Communism when he encountered Russian slave laborers who had been taken to Nazi Germany by force but refused to return to the Soviet Union at the end of the war. He was a professor at Trinity College (Connecticut) which was an Episcopal college.

==Secular humanism==
Kurtz was largely responsible for the secularization of humanism. Before Kurtz embraced the term &quot;secular humanism,&quot; which had received wide publicity through fundamentalist Christians in the 1980s, humanism was more widely perceived as a religion (or a pseudoreligion) that did not include the supernatural. This can be seen in the first article of the original &quot;Humanist Manifesto&quot; which refers to &quot;Religious Humanists&quot; and by Charles and Clara Potter&#x27;s influential 1930 book &quot;Humanism: A New Religion&quot;.

Kurtz used the publicity generated by fundamentalist preachers to grow the membership of the Council for Secular Humanism, as well as strip the religious aspects found in the earlier humanist movement. He founded the Center for Inquiry in 1991. There are now some 40 Centers and Communities worldwide, including in Los Angeles, Washington, New York City, London, Amsterdam, Warsaw, Moscow, Beijing, Hyderabad, Toronto, Dakar, Buenos Aires and Kathmandu.

In 1999, Kurtz was given the International Humanist Award by the International Humanist and Ethical Union (IHEU). He had been a board member of IHEU between 1969 and 1994, and in a tribute by former colleague at both IHEU and the Council for Secular Humanism Matt Cherry, Kurtz was described as having &quot;had a strong commitment to international humanism — a commitment to humanism beyond US borders never seen matched by another American. He did a lot to expand IHEU as a member of the IHEU Growth and Development Committee (with Levi Fragell and Rob Tielman) and then when he was co-chair, also with Rob and Levi. He always pushed IHEU to be bigger and bolder.&quot;

In 2000, he received the International Rationalist Award by Rationalist International. In 2001, he debated Christian philosopher William Lane Craig over the nature of morality.

Kurtz believed that the nonreligious members of the community should take a positive view on life. Religious skepticism, according to Paul Kurtz, is only one aspect of the secular humanistic outlook. In an interview with D.J. Grothe, he stated that a categorical imperative of secular humanism is &quot;genuine concern for the well-being of other humans.&quot;

At the Council of Secular Humanism&#x27;s Los Angeles conference (October 7–10, 2010), tension over the future of humanism was on display as Kurtz urged a more accommodationist approach to religion while his successors argued for a more adversarial approach.

On May 18, 2010, he resigned from all these positions. Moreover, the Center for Inquiry accepted his resignation as chairman emeritus, board member, and as editor in chief of &quot;Free Inquiry&quot; as being the culmination of a years-long &quot;leadership transition&quot;, thanking him &quot;for his decades of service&quot; while also alluding to &quot;concerns about Dr. Kurtz&#x27;s day-to-day management of the organization&quot;. Kurtz renewed his efforts in organized humanism by founding The Institute for Science and Human Values and its journal &quot;The Human Prospect: A NeoHumanist Perspective&quot; in June 2010.

==Critique of the paranormal==
Another aspect in Kurtz&#x27;s legacy is his critique of the paranormal. In 1976, CSICOP started &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot;, its official journal. Like Martin Gardner, Carl Sagan, Isaac Asimov, James Randi, Ray Hyman and others, Kurtz has popularized scientific skepticism and critical thinking about claims of the paranormal.

Concerning the founding of the modern skeptical movement, Ray Hyman states that in 1972, he, along with James Randi and Martin Gardner, wanted to form a skeptical group, SIR (Sanity In Research). The three of them felt they had no administration experience, saying &quot;we just had good ideas&quot;, and were soon joined by Marcello Truzzi who provided structure for the group. Truzzi involved Paul Kurtz, and they together formed CSICOP in 1976.

Kurtz wrote:
[An] explanation for the persistence of the paranormal, I submit, is due to the transcendental temptation. In my book by that name, I present the thesis that paranormal and religious phenomena have similar functions in human experience; they are expressions of a tendency to accept magical thinking. This temptation has such profound roots within human experience and culture that it constantly reasserts itself.

In &quot;The Transcendental Temptation&quot;, Kurtz analyzes how provable are the claims of Jesus, Moses, and Muhammad, as well as the founders of religions on American soil such as Joseph Smith and Ellen White. He also evaluates the activities of the most famous modern psychics and what he believes are the fruitless researches of parapsychologists. &quot;The Transcendental Temptation&quot; is considered among Kurtz&#x27;s most influential writings.

He promoted what he called &quot;Skepticism of the Third Kind,&quot; in which skeptics actively investigate claims of the paranormal, rather than just question them. He saw this type of skepticism as distinct from the &quot;first kind&quot; of extreme philosophical skepticism, which questions the possibility that anything can be known, as well as the &quot;second kind&quot; of skepticism, which accepts that knowledge of the real world is possible but is still largely a philosophical exercise.

On April 19, 2007, Kurtz appeared on Penn &amp; Teller&#x27;s television show &quot;Bullshit!&quot; arguing that exorcism and satanic cults are merely &quot;hype and paranoia&quot;.

===Eupraxsophy===
Kurtz coined the term eupraxsophy (originally &quot;eupraxophy&quot;) to refer to philosophies or life stances such as secular humanism, Confucianism and Taoism that do not rely on belief in the transcendent or supernatural. A &quot;eupraxsophy&quot; is a nonreligious life stance or worldview emphasizing the importance of living an ethical and exuberant life, and relying on rational methods such as logic, observation and science (rather than faith, mysticism or revelation) toward that end. The word is based on the Greek words for &quot;good&quot;, &quot;practice&quot;, and &quot;wisdom&quot;. Eupraxsophies, like religions, are cosmic in their outlook but eschew the supernatural component of religion, avoiding the &quot;transcendental temptation,&quot; as Kurtz puts it. Although critical of supernatural religion, he has attempted to develop affirmative ethical values of naturalistic humanism.

===The Paul Kurtz Lecture Series===
In June 2010, the State University of New York at Buffalo announced the establishment of the Paul Kurtz Lecture Series. The series will bring notable speakers to the university&#x27;s campus in Amherst, New York, to speak on topics relevant to the philosophy of humanism and philosophical naturalism. Kurtz had made the bequest and charitable gift annuity to the university, where he taught from 1965 to 1991, to help promote the development of critical intelligence in future generations of SUNY at Buffalo students. On November 5, 2010, the university announced that cognitive scientist Steven Pinker would inaugurate the new Paul Kurtz Lecture Series on December 2, 2010.

===Paul Kurtz Institute for Science and Human Values===
Paul Kurtz conceived of the &quot;Institute for Science and Human Values&quot; in 2009 as yet another branch of the umbrella group, the Center for Inquiry. Upon his resignation from the Center for Inquiry he launched the Institute for Science and Human Values as a separate entity. In ISHV&#x27;s first press release Kurtz said ISHV hoped to &quot;rehumanize secularism&quot; and &quot;find out how to better develop the common moral virtues that we share as human beings.&quot; Kurtz was editor-in-chief of ISHV&#x27;s journal, &quot;The Human Prospect: A NeoHumanist Perspective&quot;.

In 2019, the institute&#x27;s board of directors renamed the organization as the Paul Kurtz Institute for Science and Human Values.

==Honors==
The asteroid 6629 Kurtz was named in his honor.

At a meeting of the executive council of CSI in Denver, Colorado in April 2011, Kurtz was selected for inclusion in CSI&#x27;s Pantheon of Skeptics. The Pantheon of Skeptics was created by CSI to remember the legacy of deceased fellows of CSI and their contributions to the cause of scientific skepticism.

==Personal life==
Kurtz was married twice and had four children; his first marriage ended in divorce. His second wife was Claudine Vial (died 2019).

Kurtz died in Amherst, New York, on October 20, 2012, aged 86.

<text>Ex parte Garland, 71 U.S. (4 Wall.) 333 (1866), was an important United States Supreme Court case involving the disbarment of former Confederate officials.

==Background==
In January 1865, the US Congress passed a law that effectively disbarred former members of the Confederate government by requiring a loyalty oath to be recited by any federal court officer that affirmed that the officer had never served in the Confederate government.

Augustus Hill Garland, an attorney and a former Confederate Senator from Arkansas, subsequently received a pardon from US President Andrew Johnson. Garland then came before the court and pleaded that the act of Congress was a bill of attainder and an &quot;ex post facto&quot; law, which unfairly punished him for the crime for which he had been pardoned, and so was unconstitutional.

==Decision==
In a 5–4 decision, the Supreme Court held that the law was both a bill of attainder and an &quot;ex post facto&quot; law, both forbidden by Article I, Section 9 of the Constitution. The court also ruled that the president can exercise the pardon power at any time after the commission of the crime, and that Garland was beyond the reach of punishment of any kind because of his prior presidential pardon.

The court also stated that counselors are officers of the court, not officers of the United States, and that their removal was an exercise of judicial power, not legislative power. The law was struck down as unconstitutional, which opened the way for former Confederate government officials to return to positions in the federal judiciary.

<doc id="311098" wikidata="Q5338506" url="?curid=311098" title="Edith Bunker">
<text>Edith Bunker is a fictional character on the 1970s sitcom &quot;All in the Family&quot; (and occasionally &quot;Archie Bunker&#x27;s Place&quot;), played by Jean Stapleton. She is the wife of Archie Bunker, mother of Gloria Stivic, mother-in-law of Michael &quot;Meathead&quot; Stivic, and grandmother of Joey Stivic. Her cousin is Maude Findlay (Bea Arthur), one of Archie&#x27;s nemeses.

While Edith is typically a traditional and usually subservient wife, Jean Stapleton was a noted feminist.

Series creator Norman Lear said on &quot;All Things Considered&quot; that the reason why Archie would always tell Edith to stifle herself was because Lear&#x27;s father told his mother to &quot;stifle&quot;.

==Character and background==
Edith Bunker is an undereducated but kind, cheery, and loving woman. She is less politically opinionated than the rest of the family. Her main role is as the matriarch who keeps her family intact. Archie once described Edith&#x27;s father as a man &quot;with no chin and a &#x27;go funny&#x27; eye.&quot; A native of Scranton, Pennsylvania, she was born in January 1925. She later migrated to New York City, where she lived most of her life and died in her sleep of a stroke in September 1980, at age 55. She attended Millard Fillmore High School and was in the graduating class of 1943. Her high school had only one reunion (the 30th) in 1973, which she attended. At some point, she met Archie at the Puritan Maid Ice Cream Parlor. In the episode &quot;Archie Goes Too Far&quot; Edith reads her diary and reveals that she received letters in May 1943 from Archie while he was overseas serving in the Army Air Corps.

Her character and accent change somewhat between the first and second seasons. In the earliest episodes, she is the &quot;put-upon wife,&quot; often bemoaning (though softly) her husband&#x27;s behavior or comments: also during the first season, Jean Stapleton spoke more in her own range (albeit with a pronounced accent), rather than the nasal, high pitched voice for which Edith is generally remembered. By the second season, she becomes the character more familiar to viewers: kind, utterly non-judgmental, and fully dedicated to her husband.

In the second episode of the first season, &quot;Writing the President&quot;, Edith remarks how, before her marriage in 1946, she got a job and started working for the &quot;Hercules Plumbing Company&quot;. By the second season, her husband becomes &quot;Awwchie.&quot; In the third-season episode &quot;The Battle of the Month&quot; and fourth-season episode &quot;Gloria Sings the Blues,&quot; Edith reveals that her parents almost divorced after a nasty fight and that although they stayed married, things were never the same between them. This deeply affected her and her views on marriage, marital fighting, and social conduct. In the fourth-season episode &quot;Archie the Gambler,&quot; Edith reveals that her father was addicted to gambling and almost brought his family to ruin (an experience which led Edith to put her foot down twice regarding Archie&#x27;s similar gambling problem - and once slap him).

Though &quot;All In The Family&quot; drew inspiration from the British series &quot;Til Death Us Do Part&quot;, Edith, by the second season, was noticeably different than her more dysfunctional and narrow-minded British counterpart Else Garrett. Edith is the voice of reason and rock of understanding, often contributing a unique perspective to a topic. She is decidedly less bigoted than Archie (e.g., she is good friends with her Black neighbor Louise Jefferson, while Archie is always at odds with her and husband George). Though her opinions sometimes sharply differ from Archie&#x27;s, she is intensely loyal to her husband, often sticks up for him and stands by him in his times of need. She is the most naïve family member and the happiest character on the show. For example, in a conversation with Gloria, Edith stated that she favored capital punishment, &quot;as long as it ain&#x27;t too severe.&quot; In the episode &quot;Cousin Liz&quot; (in which the Bunkers learn that her recently-deceased cousin Liz was a lesbian and that her &quot;roommate&quot; Veronica had actually been Liz&#x27;s life partner), Edith is at first shocked at the revelation, but quickly throws her arms around Veronica and warmly accepts her as Liz&#x27;s &quot;&quot;true&quot; next-of-kin&quot;, giving her the tea set that Liz&#x27;s spouse would legally have inherited. Edith was popular among audiences for her sweetness, unconditionally loving everyone she knew and staying optimistic during tragedy. Despite cooperating with Archie, Edith doesn&#x27;t share much of her husband&#x27;s prejudices. Examples of this are shown through her friendships with Louise Jefferson and drag queen Beverly LaSalle, both of whom Archie is less cooperative with.

In contrast, in a memorable episode in the show&#x27;s second season, Edith uncharacteristically snaps at Archie, repeatedly telling him (as he frequently did to her) to &quot;stifle&quot;. Edith, who otherwise never cursed, also loudly instructs the family to &quot;Leave me alone, damnit!&quot; After a visit to the doctor, Gloria explains to Archie that he needs to be sensitive to the fact that Edith is going through menopause. Later on in the episode, a frustrated Archie yells at Edith &quot;When I had the hernia I didn&#x27;t make you wear the truss. Now if you&#x27;re gonna have a change of life, you gotta do it right now. I&#x27;m gonna give you 30 seconds! Now come on, change!&quot; In another episode, Edith, in a conversation with Gloria, wonders whether men go through &quot;women-pause.&quot;

When &quot;All in the Family&quot; premiered in 1971, Edith was a homemaker. In 1974 Edith got a part-time job as a caretaker at the Sunshine Home. She later was a partner in Archie&#x27;s business, Archie&#x27;s Place, the tavern he purchased in 1977. (In truth, she wasn&#x27;t a legal partner, as Archie forged her signature on the bank loan application for the purchase of the pub.) Edith loses her job at the Sunshine Home in 1979 (for violating company policy by allowing a terminally ill woman to die and failing to inform the staff), but in an early episode of &quot;Archie Bunker&#x27;s Place&quot;, she finds a similar caretaker&#x27;s job at a mental health facility.

Edith is most known for her shrill voice (her trademark &quot;Oh, Aaaaaaaaaaw-chie!&quot; became popular among viewers) and her flighty demeanor. The latter character trait causes Archie to call her &quot;dingbat&quot;. However, Archie truly loves his wife and wants what is best for both of them. Frequently, he consults with her when something bothers him (such as the episode, &quot;Archie and the KKK,&quot; where a distressed Archie asks Edith for advice on how to prevent a cross burning).

More than once, Edith sharply chastises Archie for casting judgment against other people, particularly when he mentions God. Two notable examples came in the episodes &quot;Cousin Liz&quot; (Archie went on a diatribe about how God hates gays) and &quot;California, Here We Are&quot; (where, upon learning that Gloria&#x27;s near affair had almost destroyed the Stivics&#x27; marriage, berates the &quot;Little Goil&quot; and says that the matter is &quot;God&#x27;s business&quot;). In both instances, Edith warned Archie to back off and says that God should be left to deal with those matters and the people involved. She also becomes close friends with a transvestite person/drag performer known as Beverly LaSalle (Lori Shannon) who comes into their lives when Archie saves his life with CPR, remaining friends with him, despite Archie&#x27;s discomfort. Edith later has a crisis of faith after Beverly&#x27;s death protecting Mike from muggers.

Edith also serves as the voice of reason for Mike and on several occasions corrects him when, as she says, &quot;He&#x27;s been acting all stuck up.&quot; She explains to Mike that Archie yells at him not because he hates Mike but because he is jealous of Mike&#x27;s many opportunities in life. Edith also, on many occasions, helps Gloria to understand that Gloria&#x27;s feminist views, while correct, do not mean other viewpoints are necessarily any less valid.

Edith is described by Archie&#x27;s father as being &quot;too smart&quot; for him because, while Edith appears to have less-than-average intelligence, she is very wise about life and the way the world works.

Around the house, Edith usually runs, eager to please others without them having to wait. This included answering the doorbell or phone and running to the kitchen to get Archie a beer.

In &quot;The Saga of Cousin Oscar&quot;, Edith mentions she has two sisters, Helen and Gertrude. In &quot;Lionel Steps Out,&quot; she mentions a brother, Harry.

The character suffers intermittently throughout the series. Edith goes through menopause in the second season (&quot;Edith&#x27;s Problem&quot;), discovers a lump in her breast just before Christmas in the fourth season (&quot;Edith&#x27;s Christmas Story&quot;), is nearly raped on her 50th birthday in the eighth season (&quot;Edith&#x27;s 50th Birthday&quot;) and in season nine briefly contracts laryngitis (&quot;A Night at the PTA&quot;) and develops phlebitis in the show&#x27;s final episode (&quot;Too Good Edith&quot;). The first episode of the second season of &quot;Archie Bunker&#x27;s Place&quot; (&quot;Archie Alone&quot;) reveals that Edith has died as the result of a stroke.

==Death==
Beneath his crusty, irascible exterior, Archie is intensely protective of Edith and becomes upset at the mere thought of losing her. In the episode &quot;Too Good Edith,&quot; the 209th and final episode of &quot;All in the Family&quot;, Edith becomes seriously ill while frantically helping Archie cook a large Irish dinner for a St. Patrick&#x27;s Day party at the bar. She had been suffering from phlebitis and decided not to tell Archie, but when he finds out about it he scolds her for hiding it from him.

In the sequel series &quot;Archie Bunker&#x27;s Place&quot;, Archie&#x27;s worst nightmare becomes a reality when Edith dies (off-camera) from a stroke. In the one-hour Season 2 premiere, &quot;Archie Alone&quot; (which first aired on November 2, 1980), Archie is still in denial weeks after Edith&#x27;s death and refuses to take Stephanie to visit her grave. Near the episode&#x27;s end, after neighbors and friends had removed Edith&#x27;s personal items to help him to cope, Archie, alone in the now-empty bedroom, finds one of her pink slippers left behind underneath the bed, and breaks down in tears as he recalls the morning he discovered Edith had died in her sleep during the night:

Fearing being typecast in &quot;submissive&quot; roles, Jean Stapleton had wished to leave her role as a regular character, although she was open to guest appearances (in interviews, Stapleton has stated the role of Edith had reached its potential). Her appearances in the prior season sharply declined: she appeared in only four episodes of the 1979–1980 season. It was with great reluctance that producer Norman Lear agreed to have the character killed off, despite CBS being willing to do so. When Stapleton reminded him that Edith was a fictional character, Lear took a long pause, causing Stapleton to think she had hurt him. Finally, Lear said, &quot;To me, she isn&#x27;t [fictional],&quot; but ultimately made the decision to have Edith die.

Stapleton later appeared as a presenter on the 1981 Primetime Emmy Awards telecast (after the episode &quot;Archie Alone&quot; aired) and said to the viewing audience: &quot;See! I&#x27;m still here!&quot;

== Cultural impact ==
Edith and Archie&#x27;s chairs have been noted as famous pieces of history by their inclusion in the National Museum of American History. In 1992, Edith was impersonated by Randy Davison on &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest People&quot;. In 2009, Edith Bunker was included in Yahoo!&#x27;s Top 10 TV Moms from Six Decades of Television for the decade 1971–1979.

<text>Genipa americana () is a species of trees in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to the tropical forests of North and South America, as well as the Caribbean.

==Description==
&quot;Genipa americana&quot; trees are up to 30 m tall and up to 60 cm dbh. Their bark is smooth with little fissures. The leaves are opposite, obovate, or obovate oblong, 10–35 cm long, 6–13 cm wide, and glossy dark green, with entire margin, acute or acuminate apex, and attenuated base. The inflorescences are cymes up to 10 cm long. The flowers are white to yellowish, slightly fragrant, calyx bell-shaped, corolla at 2–4.5 cm long, trumpet-shaped, and five- or six-lobed. The five short stamens are inserted on top of the corolla tube. The fruit is a thick-skinned edible greyish berry 10–12 cm long, 5–9 cm in diameter.

==Distribution and habitat==
&quot;Genipa americana&quot; is native to the tropical forests of the Americas, from the Caribbean south to Argentina. It is present from sea level up to 1200 m of elevation, although some argue the original native range as being northern South America.

==Vernacular names==
In English, the tree is known as the genip tree and the fruit as genipap .

Colombia: &quot;jagua, caruto, huito&quot;; Brazil: &quot;jenipapo&quot;, formerly &quot;genipapo&quot;; Costa Rica: &quot;guaitil, tapaculo&quot;; Nicaragua: &quot;tapaculo, yigualtí&quot;; Mexico:&quot; shagua, xagua, maluco&quot;; Perú: &quot;huito, vito, jagua&quot;; Argentina: &quot;ñandipá&quot;; Puerto Rico: &quot;jagua&quot;; Bolivia:&quot; bí&quot;

Its name has been reconstructed as &quot;we&#x27;e&quot; (*weʔe) in Proto-Tucanoan.

==Chemical compounds==
The following compounds have been isolated from &quot;G. americana&quot;: genipic acid, genipinic acid, genipin (all three from the fruit) and geniposidic acid (leaves).

==Uses==
The unripe fruit of &quot;G. americana&quot; yields a liquid used as a dye for tattoos, skin painting, insect repellent and food.

This species is also cultivated for its edible fruits, which are eaten in preserves or made into drinks, jelly, or ice cream.

The wood is reported to be resistant, strong, and easily worked; it is used in the making of utensils and in construction and carpentry.

<doc id="311102" wikidata="Q465348" url="?curid=311102" title="Jane Roberts">
<text>Dorothy Jane Roberts (May 8, 1929 – September 5, 1984) was an American author and poet, who claimed to be psychic and a spirit medium channeling a personality who called himself &quot;Seth.&quot; Her publication of the Seth texts, known as the &quot;Seth Material&quot;, established her as one of the preeminent figures in the world of paranormal phenomena.

==Early life and career==
Roberts was born in Albany, New York, and grew up in nearby Saratoga Springs, New York. Her parents, Delmer Hubbell Roberts and Marie Burdo, divorced when she was two years old. With her only child, the young Marie then returned to her own parents, and the home that the family had rented for a number of years: half of a double dwelling in a poor neighborhood. Marie had begun experiencing the early stages of rheumatoid arthritis by 1932 but worked as much as possible. Eventually, Roberts&#x27; grandfather, Joseph Burdo, with whom she shared a deep mystical identification, was unable to support two extra people, and the family had to rely upon public assistance. Roberts&#x27; grandmother was killed in an automobile accident in 1936.

The next year, her grandfather moved out of the house. By then Marie was partially incapacitated, and the Welfare Department began to furnish mother and daughter with occasional and often unreliable domestic help. When Marie became a bedridden invalid, it was Jane&#x27;s responsibility to take care of her. This included cooking, cleaning, bringing her the bedpan, and getting up in the middle of the night to refuel the stove. Her embittered mother would tell Jane she was going to turn on the gas jets in the middle of the night and kill them both. When her mother attempted suicide for about the fifth time, she took sleeping pills and was in the hospital. Jane wrote that she went to the welfare worker and said, &#x27;I can&#x27;t take it anymore. I&#x27;ve just got to leave.&#x27;&quot; Over and over Marie told Jane she was no good, that the daughter&#x27;s birth had caused the mother&#x27;s illness, and that she was disowned and considered no longer her daughter.

Well before she was 10 years old Jane had developed persistent symptoms of colitis. By her early teens, she had an overactive thyroid gland. Her vision was poor; she required very strong glasses (which she seldom wore). For most of 1940 and half of 1941, Jane was in a strictly-run Catholic orphanage in Troy, New York while her mother was hospitalized in another city for treatment of her arthritis. Priests came to the house regularly and support was offered to the fatherless family. Jane&#x27;s initial bonding to the cultural beliefs of religion was very strong to make up for the lack of a loving, nurturing family. For a time she was left between belief systems.

In the summer of 1945, when she was 16 years old, Jane began working at a variety store. It was her first job. That fall she continued on the job after school hours and on an occasional Saturday. After attending public schools she went to Skidmore College from 1947 to 1950 on a poetry scholarship. Roberts&#x27; grandfather died when she was age 19. It was a time of severe shock for her. She began to substitute scientific world view for religious belief.

At that time Jane was dating Walt Zeh, a long-time Saratoga Springs friend. Together they went to the west coast by motorcycle to see Jane&#x27;s father who had also come from a broken home. Jane then married Walt and continued to write while taking a variety of other jobs, including society editor for the Saratoga newspaper, and as a supervisor in a radio factory. Walt and Jane lived together for three years. It was then in February 1954 while &quot;cutting up, dancing, and raisin&#x27; hell at a party,&quot; that Jane first met the former commercial artist Robert Fabian Butts, Jr. The fourth time they met at another party and Jane &quot;just looked at him and said, &#x27;Look, I&#x27;m leaving Walt, and I&#x27;m going to live by myself or I&#x27;m going to live with you, so just let me know.&#x27;&quot; Eventually the two left town together and Jane filed for divorce. Jane and Rob married on December 27, 1954, at the home of his parents in Sayre, Pennsylvania.

Roberts wrote in a variety of genres: poetry, short stories, children&#x27;s literature, nonfiction, science fiction, and fantasy, and novels. She was the only woman invited to the first science-fiction writer&#x27;s conference in 1956 in Milford, Pennsylvania.

The couple moved to Elmira, New York, in 1960, to find steady part-time work – Rob in the local greeting card company, Jane in an art gallery. Now in her 30s, she and her husband began to record what she said were messages from a personality named &quot;Seth,&quot; and she wrote several books about the experience.

==&quot;Seth Material&quot;==

On a September evening in 1963, Roberts sat down at her table to work on poetry; Butts was in his back-room studio, painting. &quot;It was very domestic, very normal, very unpsychedelic,&quot; she would later remember. And then &quot;Between one normal minute and the next, a fantastic avalanche of radical, new ideas burst into my head with tremendous force ... It was as if the physical world were really tissue-paper-thin, hiding infinite dimensions of reality, and I was flung through the tissue paper with a huge ripping sound.&quot; When she &quot;came to,&quot; Roberts found herself scrawling the title of this batch of notes: &quot;The Physical Universe as Idea Construction.&quot;

Before this, though her fiction typically dealt with such themes as clairvoyance and reincarnation, intellectually neither she nor Butts believed in extrasensory abilities. Yet soon after this episode, Roberts suddenly began recalling her dreams, including two that were precognitive. Their curiosity piqued, the couple decided to investigate further, and she managed to land a contract with a New York publisher for a do-it-yourself book on extra-sensory perception.

In late 1963, Roberts and Butts started experimenting with a Ouija board as part of Roberts&#x27; research for the book. According to Roberts and Butts, on December 2, 1963, they began to receive coherent messages from a male personality who eventually identified himself as Seth. Soon after, Roberts reported that she was hearing the messages in her head. The first seven sessions were entirely with the Ouija board. The three-hour session on the evening of January 2, 1964, was the first where she began to dictate the messages instead of using the Ouija board. For a while, she still opened her sessions with the board, but finally abandoned it after the 27th session on Feb. 19, 1964.

Roberts described the process of writing the &quot;Seth&quot; books as entering a trance state. She said Seth would assume control of her body and speak through her, while her husband wrote down the words she spoke. They referred to such episodes as &quot;readings&quot; or &quot;sessions.&quot; The 26th session on Feb. 18, 1964, was the first held in the presence of another person—a friend.

On January 17, 1964, Roberts channeled an allegedly recently deceased woman who told Butts that his and his wife&#x27;s work with Seth was a life-time project, that they would publish his manuscripts, and help spread his ideas. At the 27th session Seth also told the couple how to rearrange the furniture in their apartment which would better suit their energies. Despite feelings of disbelief toward both messages, the couple somewhat reluctantly agreed. Two days afterward they heard from a psychologist interested in reincarnation to whom they had written three weeks earlier with some session copies enclosed. The psychologist told them that the very fluency of the material suggested that it might come from Roberts&#x27; subconscious, though it was impossible to tell. He also cautioned that in some circumstances, amateur mediumship could lead to mental problems.

The letter upset her but helped her deal with her doubts. She felt there were no &quot;alarming changes&quot; in her personality. &quot;I was doing twice the creative work I had done earlier. I was satisfied with the quality of the Seth Material; it was far superior to anything I could do on my own. If nothing else, I thought the sessions presented a way of making deeply unconscious knowledge available on a consistent basis.&quot;
&quot;Because we were so innocent about psychic literature, we weren&#x27;t hampered by superstitious fears about such [psychic] phenomena. I didn&#x27;t believe in gods or demons, so I didn&#x27;t fear them. I wanted to learn. Rob and I had discovered a whole new world together, and we were going to explore it.&quot;

Roberts assumed Seth was a subconscious fantasy, personified because she did not believe in &quot;spirits&quot; or life after death. She monitored her personality characteristics and went to a psychologist. But she felt that &quot;Seth seemed far more mature and well-balanced than the psychologist, so finally I stopped worrying. This is not to say the experience did not cause certain strains and stresses that could accompany any worthwhile venture in an entirely new field.&quot;

Roberts also purportedly channeled the world views of several other people, including the philosopher William James, Rembrandt, and the Impressionist painter Paul Cézanne, through a process she described as using a typewriter to write &quot;automatically.&quot;

For 21 years until Roberts&#x27; death in 1984 (with a one-year hiatus due to her final illness), Roberts held more than 1500 regular or private &quot;ESP class&quot; trance sessions in which she spoke on behalf of Seth. Butts served as the stenographer, taking the messages down in shorthand he had made up, having others on occasion make recording of some sessions. The messages from Seth channeled through Roberts consisted mostly of monologues on a wide variety of topics. They were published by Prentice-Hall under the collective title &quot;Seth Material&quot;.

Over the years, hundreds of people witnessed Roberts channeling &quot;Seth&quot;. Some went to the ESP classes Roberts held (Tuesday and some Thursday nights, Sept. 1967 – Feb. 1975) for an evening, others attended for longer periods. (By this time Jane had given up her gallery work, and was teaching nursery school during part of this time.) Outside of the ESP class structure, Roberts gave many personal Seth sessions to various individuals who had written her, asking for help. She never charged for those sessions; however, at some point, she did charge $2.50 to $3.50 per ESP class of 5 to 40 people. When the books began to sell in sufficient numbers, she dropped that fee. Book sessions were almost always private, held on Monday and Wednesday evenings without witnesses from 1967 through 1982 (except for Tues and Thurs from Aug. to Nov. 1981).

The material through 1969 was published in summary form in &quot;The Seth Material&quot;, written by Roberts from the output of the channeling sessions. Beginning in January 1970, Roberts wrote books which she described as dictated by Seth. Roberts claimed no authorship of these books beyond her role as a medium. This series of &quot;Seth books&quot; totaled ten volumes. The last two books appear to be incomplete due to Roberts&#x27; illness. Butts contributed extensive footnotes, appendices, and other comments to all the Seth books, and thus was a co-author on all of them. These additions describe what was going on in Roberts&#x27; and his life at the time of the various sessions, annotated in light of contemporary beliefs and materials he and Roberts were reading, described excerpts from some fan mail and letters from professionals commenting on Seth&#x27;s material about their fields, and, especially later, provided insight as to the many steps of production of multiple books with the publisher. By February 1982 they were still receiving &quot;from 30 to 50 letters and packages a week&quot; from readers of their various books.

Some of Roberts&#x27; earlier and later poetry was occasionally included to show how she had touched upon some of Seth&#x27;s concepts. Roberts also wrote &quot;The Oversoul Seven&quot; trilogy to explore via fiction some of Seth&#x27;s teachings on the concepts of reincarnation and oversouls.

According to Roberts, Seth described himself as an &quot;energy personality essence no longer focused in physical matter,&quot; and was independent of Roberts&#x27; subconscious. Roberts initially expressed skepticism as to Seth&#x27;s origins, wondering if he was a part of her own personality. While speaking as Seth, Roberts at times appeared stern, jovial, or professorial. &quot;His&quot; voice was deeper and more masculine sounding than Jane&#x27;s and was possessed of a distinct, although not identifiable, accent. Her housecats notice the change. Unlike the psychic Edgar Cayce, whose syntax when speaking in trance was antiquated and convoluted, Roberts&#x27; syntax and sentence structures were modern and clear when speaking as Seth. Later books continued to develop but did not contradict the material introduced in earlier works. Some &quot;Practice Elements&quot; were even included on how a few of the concepts could be practically experienced.

A few contemporary world events were commented upon, such as the Jonestown Guyana deaths and the Three Mile Island accident.

Seth also provided an alternative creation myth to that of the Big Bang or Intelligent Design.

Roberts&#x27; father died in November 1971 at the age of 68; her mother died six months later at the same age. In early 1982 Roberts spent a month in the hospital for severely underactive thyroid gland, protruding eyes and double vision, an almost total hearing loss, a slight anemia, budding bedsores, and a hospital-caused staph infection. She recovered to an extent, but died two and a half years later in 1984, having been bedridden with severe arthritis, like her mother, for the final year and a half of her life. Roberts had spent 504 consecutive days in a hospital in Elmira, N.Y. The immediate causes of her death were a combination of protein depletion, osteomyelitis, and soft-tissue infections. These conditions arose out of her longstanding rheumatoid arthritis. (Butts believed for some 15 years that in Roberts&#x27; case, at least, the young girl&#x27;s psychological conditioning was far more important—far more damaging, in those terms—than any physical tendency to inherit the disease.) Roberts was cremated the next day in a process she and Butts had agreed upon several years earlier.

After Roberts&#x27; death, recorded in &quot;The Way Toward Health&quot; (1997), Butts continued his work as a guardian of the Seth texts and continued to supervise the publication of some of the remaining material, including &quot;The Early Sessions,&quot; making sure all of the recordings, manuscripts, notes, and drawings would be given to the Yale Library. Butts remarried, and his second wife, Laurel Lee Davies, supported his work during the more than 20 years they were together and helped answer mail and proofread manuscripts. Butts died of cancer on May 26, 2008. Jane Roberts Butts and Robert F. Butts Jr., are interred together in the Wayne County, NY, Furnaceville cemetery; however, there is another gravestone with their names on it in the Sunnyside cemetery in Tunkhannock, Pennsylvania. A number of groups have compiled anthologies of quotes from Seth, summarized sections of his teachings, issued copies of Seth sessions on audio tape, and further relayed the material via classes and conventions.

===Reception and influence===
Seth&#x27;s effect upon New Age thinkers has been profound. The title jacket of &quot;The Nature of Personal Reality, A Seth Book,&quot; republished in 1994 (Amber-Allen/New World Library), contains testimonials from some of the most notable thinkers and writers within the movement. Marianne Williamson, Deepak Chopra, Shakti Gawain, Dan Millman, Louise Hay, Richard Bach, and others express the effect the Seth Material had upon their own awakening. In words similar to Williamson&#x27;s they state: &quot;Seth was one of my first metaphysical teachers. He remains a constant source of knowledge and inspiration in my life.&quot; Catherine L. Albanese, professor of religious history at the University of Chicago, stated that in the 1970s the Seth Material &quot;launched an era of nationwide awareness&quot; of the channeling trend. She believes it contributed to the &quot;self-identity of an emergent New Age movement and also augment[ed] its ranks.&quot;

John P. Newport, in his study of the impact of New Age beliefs on contemporary culture, described the central focus of the Seth material as the idea that for each individual: &quot;you create your own reality.&quot; (Briefly summarized, our beliefs generate emotions that trigger our memories and organize our associations. Eventually, those beliefs become manifested in our physical lives and health.) Newport wrote that this foundational concept of the New Age movement was first developed in the &quot;Seth Material.&quot; Historian Robert C. Fuller, a professor of religious studies at Bradley University, wrote that Seth filled the role of guide for what Fuller called &quot;unchurched American spirituality,&quot; related to concepts of reincarnation, &quot;karma&quot;, free will, ancient metaphysical wisdom, and &quot;Christ consciousness.&quot;

Some writers noted, &quot;Husband Robert Butts stated that similarities exist between Seth&#x27;s ideas and those of various religious, philosophical, and mystical doctrines from the Near, Middle, or Far East… and we&#x27;ve done a little reading on Buddhism, Hinduism, Zen, and Taoism, for example, not to mention subjects like shamanism, voodooism, and obeah.&quot;

New Age writer Michael Talbot wrote, &quot;To my great surprise—and slight annoyance—I found that Seth eloquently and lucidly articulated a view of reality that I had arrived at only after great effort and an extensive study of both paranormal phenomena and quantum physics.&quot;

The Yale University Library Manuscripts and Archives maintains a collection entitled &quot;Jane Roberts Papers (MS 1090)&quot;, which documents the career and personal life of Jane Roberts, including journals, poetry, correspondence, audio, and video recordings, and other materials donated after her death by Roberts&#x27; husband and other individuals and organizations. Yale University&#x27;s collection entitled &quot;Jane Roberts papers&quot; occupies 164.08 linear feet of shelf space and is contained in 498 boxes.

===Quotes===
Jane Roberts&#x27;s corpus advocates panpsychism and reality creation outside corporeal time. She advises scientists to look beyond evolution with the ideal &quot;the cells precognate,&quot; and she asks troubled people to cure themselves by believing that &quot;the point of power is in the present&quot; and &quot;beliefs create reality.&quot; In the late 1970s, when scientists considered viruses inert pests and un-life, Seth declared that &quot;viruses are necessary for life as we know it.&quot; Scientists have since discovered that much organic DNA has viral origins, and that healthy populations of symbiotic viruses maintain multi-cellular organisms via Endogenosymbiosis.

===Criticism===
Roberts and the &quot;Seth Material&quot; have attracted critiques from outside the paranormal community. The poet Charles Upton, in his collection of essays titled &quot;The System of Antichrist&quot;, posited that Roberts multiplied the self due to a fear of death. His opinion was that the Seth texts are based on a misunderstanding of both Christianity and of Eastern religions.

Professor of psychology and noted critic of parapsychology James E. Alcock opined, &quot;In light of all this, the Seth materials must surely be viewed as less than ordinary. There certainly was the time and talent for fraud to play a role, but we cannot discriminate between that possibility and the possibility of unconscious production—at any rate, given these circumstances, there seems little need to consider the involvement of any supernatural agency.&quot;

Some religious groups have warned their members about the dangers and deceptions of reading channeled messages from Roberts and others. John MacArthur, host of a syndicated Christian talk show, considers &quot;The Seth Material&quot; to be &quot;a book entirely written by a demon.&quot;, while the New Age Urantia Foundation considers the book evidence for &quot;Devil possession.&quot; Videos such as &quot;Jane Roberts&#x27; Seth Speaks is Anti-Catholic Hate Books – Allowed By The Media&quot; claimed that Seth was &quot;a demon from hell contacted through a ouija board.&quot;

Science writer Karen Stollznow has written that much of Roberts work was &quot;criticized for being a rip-off of Christian and
Eastern philosophy. It comes as no surprise that Seth influenced such authors as Deepak Chopra and Louise Hay.&quot;

Since Roberts&#x27; death, others have claimed to channel Seth. In the introduction to Seth&#x27;s first dictated book, &quot;Seth Speaks&quot;, &quot;he&quot; says, &quot;communications will come exclusively through Ruburt [Seth&#x27;s name for Jane] at all times, to protect the integrity of the material.&quot; In &quot;The Seth Material&quot;, Jane Roberts wrote: &quot;Several people have told me that Seth communicated with them through automatic writing, but Seth denies any such contacts.&quot; At least one person has claimed more recently to channel Roberts.

<text>The North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) is a baleen whale, one of three right whale species belonging to the genus &quot;Eubalaena&quot;, all of which were formerly classified as a single species. Because of their docile nature, their slow surface-skimming feeding behaviors, their tendencies to stay close to the coast, and their high blubber content (which makes them float when they are killed, and which produces high yields of whale oil), right whales were once a preferred target for whalers.
At present, they are among the most endangered whales in the world, and they are protected under the U.S. Endangered Species Act and Marine Mammal Protection Act and Canada&#x27;s Species at Risk Act. There are an estimated 356 individuals in existence in the western North Atlantic Ocean—they migrate between feeding grounds in the Labrador Sea and their winter calving areas off Georgia and Florida, an ocean area with heavy shipping traffic. In the eastern North Atlantic, on the other hand—with a total population reaching into the low teens at most—scientists believe that they may already be functionally extinct. Vessel strikes and entanglement in fixed fishing gear, which together account for nearly half of all North Atlantic right whale mortality since 1970, are their two greatest threats to recovery.
== Description ==
Like other right whales, the North Atlantic right whale, also known as the northern right whale or black right whale, is readily distinguished from other cetaceans by the absence of a dorsal fin on its broad back, short, paddle-like pectoral flippers and a long arching mouth that begins above the eye. Its coloration is dark grey to black, with some individuals occasionally having white patches on their stomachs or throats. Other unique features include a large head, which makes up a quarter of its total body length, narrow tail stock in comparison to its wide fluke, and v-shaped blowhole which produces a heart-shaped blow.

The most distinguishing feature for right whales is their callosities, rough, white patches of keratinized skin found on their heads. The right whale&#x27;s callosities provide habitat for large colonies of cyamids or whale lice, which feed on the right whale&#x27;s skin as these small crustaceans cannot survive in open water. The relationship between cyamids and right whales is symbiotic in nature but is poorly understood by scientists. Callosities are not caused by the external environment and are present on fetuses before birth. However, Cyamids near the blowhole have been linked to chronic entanglement and other injuries; their presence in this area has been used as measure of individual health in visual health assessments.

Adult North Atlantic right whales average in length and weigh approximately , they are slightly smaller on average than the North Pacific species. The largest measured specimens have been long and . Females are larger than males.

Up to forty-five percent of a right whale&#x27;s body weight is blubber. This high percentage causes their body to float after death due to the fact that blubber has a low density.

There is little data on their lifespan but it is believed to be at least 70 years, although individuals in species closely related to right whales have been found to live more than 100 years. Currently, female North Atlantic Right whales live on average 45 years and males 65 years. Age of right whales can be determined by examining their earwax postmortem.

== Behavior ==

=== Surface activities ===


Aside from mating activities performed by groups of single female and several males, so called SAG (Surface Active Group), North Atlantic right whales seem less active compared to subspecies in southern hemisphere. However, this could be due to intense difference in number of surviving individuals, especially calves that tend to be more curious and playful than adults, and small amount of observations. They are also known to interact with other baleen whales especially with Humpback whales or Bottlenose dolphins.

=== Vocalization ===
North Atlantic right whales recordings are available online. Many effective automated methods, such as signal processing, data mining, and machine learning techniques are used to detect and classify their calls.

=== Reproduction ===
North Atlantic right whales are promiscuous breeders. They first give birth at age nine or ten after a year-long gestation; the interval between births seems to have increased since the 1990s, and now averages three to six years. Calves are long at birth and weigh approximately .

=== Feeding ===
Right whales feed mainly on copepods and other small invertebrates such as krill, pteropods, and larval barnacles, generally by slowly skimming through patches of concentrated prey at or below the ocean surface. Sei whales and basking sharks (sometimes minke whales as well) are in positions as food competitors and are known to feed in the same areas, swimming next to each other, but there have not been any conflicts observed between these species.

== Taxonomy ==
The whale&#x27;s scientific name is &quot;Eubalaena glacialis&quot;, which means &quot;good, or true, whale of the ice&quot;.

The cladogram is a tool for visualizing and comparing the evolutionary relationships between taxa. The point where a node branches off is analogous to an evolutionary branching – the diagram can be read left-to-right, much like a timeline. The following cladogram of the family Balaenidae serves to illustrate the current scientific consensus as to the relationships between the North Atlantic right whale and the other members of its family.

Another so-called species of right whale, the &quot;Swedenborg whale&quot; as proposed by Emanuel Swedenborg in the 18th century, was by scientific consensus once thought to be the North Atlantic right whale. However, the 2013 results of DNA analysis of those fossil bones revealed that they were in fact those of the bowhead whale.

== Whaling ==

As the &quot;right&quot; whale continued to float long after being killed, it was possible to &#x27;flense&#x27; or strip the whale of blubber without having to take it on board ship. Combined with the right whale&#x27;s lack of speed through water, feeding habits, and coastal habitat, they were easy to catch, even for whalers equipped only with wooden boats and hand-held harpoons.

Basques were the first to commercially hunt this species. They began whaling in the Bay of Biscay as early as the eleventh century. The whales were hunted initially for whale oil, but, as meat preservation technology improved, their value as food increased. Basque whalers reached eastern Canada by 1530. The last Basque whaling voyages were made prior to the commencement of the Seven Years&#x27; War (1756–1763). A few attempts were made to revive the trade, but they failed. Shore whaling continued sporadically into the 19th century. It had previously been assumed that Basque whaling in eastern Canada had been the primary cause for the depletion of the sub-population in the western North Atlantic, but later genetic studies disproved this.

Setting out from Nantucket and New Bedford in Massachusetts and from Long Island, New York, Americans took up to one hundred right whales each year, with the records including one report of 29 whales killed in Cape Cod Bay in a single day during January 1700. By 1750, the North Atlantic right whale population was, for commercial purposes, depleted. Yankee whalers moved into the South Atlantic before the end of the 18th century. The population was so low by the mid-19th century that the famous Whitby whaler Rev. William Scoresby, son of the successful British whaler William Scoresby senior (1760–1829), claimed to have never seen a right whale (although he mainly hunted bowhead whales off eastern Greenland, outside the normal range of right whales).

Based on back calculations using the present population size and growth rate, the population may have numbered fewer than 100 individuals by 1935. As it became clear that hunting right whales was unsustainable, international protection for right whales came into effect, as the practice was banned globally in 1937. The ban was largely successful, although violations continued for several decades. Madeira took its last two right whales in 1967.

== Threats ==
For the period 1970 to October 2006, humans have been responsible for 48% of the 73 documented deaths of the North Atlantic right whale. A 2001 forecast showed a declining population trend in the late 1990s, and indicated a high probability that North Atlantic right whales would go extinct within 200 years if the then-existing anthropogenic mortality rate was not curtailed. The combined factors of small population size and low annual reproductive rate of right whales mean that a single death represents a significant increase in mortality rate. Conversely, significant reduction in the mortality rate can be obtained by preventing just a few deaths. It was calculated that preventing the deaths of just two females per year would enable the population to stabilize. The data suggests, therefore, that human sources of mortality may have a greater effect relative to population growth rates of North Atlantic right whales than for other whales. The principal factors known to be retarding growth and recovery of the population are ship strikes and entanglement with fishing gear.

=== Ship strikes ===
The single greatest danger to this species is injury sustained from ship strikes. Between 1970 and October 2006, 37% of all recorded North Atlantic right whale deaths were attributed to collisions. During the years 1999–2003, incidents of mortality and serious injury attributed to ship strikes averaged 1 per year. For the years 2004–2006, that number increased to 2.6. Additionally, it is possible that the official figures underestimate the actual ship-strike mortality rates, since whales struck in offshore areas may never be sighted due to low search effort.

In 2003, the International Maritime Organization shifted the location of the Traffic Separation Scheme (TSS, i.e. shipping lanes) in the Bay of Fundy (and approaches) from an area with the highest density of North Atlantic right whales to an area of lower density. This was the first time the IMO had changed a TSS to help protect marine mammals. In 2006, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) established a set of recommended vessel routes to reduce ship strikes in four important eastern-US right whale habitats. In 2007, and again on June 1, 2009, NOAA changed the TSS servicing Boston to reduce vessel collisions with right whales and other whale species. NOAA estimated that implementing an &quot;Area To Be Avoided&quot; (ATBA) and narrowing the TSS by would reduce the relative risk of right whale ship strikes by 74% during April–July (63% from the ATBA and 11% from the narrowing of the TSS). In 2008, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) and NOAA enacted a series of vessel speed restrictions to reduce ship collisions with North Atlantic right whales for ships in certain areas along the East Coast of the United States in order to reduce the probability of fatal ship strikes.

=== Fishing gear entanglement ===
The next greatest source of human-induced mortality is entanglement in fixed fishing gear such as bottom-set groundfish gillnet gear, cod traps and lobster pots. Between 1970 and October 2006, there have been 8 instances where entanglements have been the direct cause of death of North Atlantic right whales. This represents 11% of all deaths documented during that period. From 1986 to 2005, there were a total of 61 confirmed reports of entanglements, including the aforementioned mortalities. It is likely that official figures underestimate the actual impacts of entanglement. Entanglement is stressful on the animal, and repeated entanglement can lead to depleted blubber reserves. It is believed that chronically entangled animals may in fact sink upon death due to loss of buoyancy from depleted blubber reserves, and therefore escape detection.

According to a 2012 New England Aquarium report, 85 percent of the whales have had rope entanglement at least one time and it is the leading cause of death.

A whale that survives an entanglement episode may be weakened, have reduced fertility, or become vulnerable to further injury. Because whales often free themselves of gear following an entanglement event, scarring may be a better indicator of fisheries interaction than entanglement sightings. A 2012 analysis of the scarification of right whales over the years 1980 to 2009 showed that 82.9% of all North Atlantic right whales experienced at least one fishing gear entanglement, 59.0% have had more than one such experience, and an average of 15.5% of the population are entangled in fishing gear annually.

In 2007, so as to protect northern right whales from serious injury or mortality from entanglement in gillnet gear in their calving area in Atlantic Ocean waters off the southeast United States, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) revised regulations implementing the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan (ALWTRP). This plan expands the restricted area to include the waters off of South Carolina, Georgia, and Northern Florida. It also prohibits gillnet fishing or even gillnet possession in those waters for a period of five months, beginning on November 15 of each year, which coincides with the annual right whale calving season.

When entanglement prevention efforts fail, disentanglement efforts occasionally succeed, despite the fact that such efforts are more frequently impossible or unsuccessful. Nevertheless, they do in fact make a significant difference because saving a few whales in a population of only 400 has a large positive effect against mortality rates. Between 2004–2008 there were at least four documented cases of entanglements for which the intervention of disentanglement teams averted a likely death of a right whale. For the first time in 2009 and again in 2011, scientists successfully used chemical sedation of an entangled whale to reduce stress on the animal and to reduce the time spent working with it. After disentangling the whale, scientists attached a satellite tracking tag, administered a dose of antibiotics to treat entanglement wounds and then another drug to reverse the sedation. Despite concerns that the trauma might impair reproduction, researchers confirmed in January 2013 that three disentangled whales had given birth.

Due to recently increased presences of right whales in Cape Breton to St. Lawrence regions, increases in entanglements and possible ship strikes have been confirmed as well including serious fatal cases involving three whales between June 24 and July 13, 2015.

A female known as Snow Cone gained attention in September 2022 after being spotted off the coast of Massachusetts dragging fishing gear. The 17-year-old whale, who had been continuously entangled for at least 18 months, and was covered in lice and swimming slowly, was considered beyond saving by scientists.

In 2022, the Marine Stewardship Council revoked its certification for the commercial Gulf of Maine lobster fishery, citing risks of entanglement of North American right whales in lobster-fishing gear. The same year, Seafood Watch added the American and Canadian Maine lobster fisheries to its &quot;red list&quot; of seafood species to avoid, for the same reason. The MSC and Seafood Watch led some retailers to stop selling Maine lobster. The decision was welcomed by whale-conservation groups, but opposed by the Maine lobster industry and elected officials in Maine, where the fishery is economically important.

=== Noise ===

A 2011 analysis of data collected in the Bay of Fundy has shown that exposure to low-frequency ship noise may be associated with chronic physiological stress in North Atlantic right whales. Following the tragic events of September 11th, maritime activity in the Bay of Fundy, a crucial calving and nursing ground for right whales, experienced a marked reduction in both ship traffic and density. Analysis of fecal matter collections from right whales in the region unveiled a noteworthy decline in fecal glucocorticoid (fGC) stress hormones post-9/11 compared to pre-9/11. This data demonstrates a correlation between ship traffic noise and stress levels in the right whale population. 

Heightened ambient noise from increased ship activity may contribute to chronic stress in these marine mammals. Prolonged elevation of fGC stress hormones is associated with adverse effects on growth rate, reproduction, and overall immune health emphasizing the potential dangers of anthropogenic noise disturbances to the overall health of this already critically endangered species. 

==== Naval training near calving grounds ====
The US Navy proposed plans to build a new undersea naval sonar training range immediately adjacent to northern right whale calving grounds in shallow waters off the Florida/Georgia border. In September 2012, legal challenges by 12 environmental groups were denied in federal court, allowing the Navy to proceed.

=== Climate change ===

Anthropogenic climate change poses a clear and growing threat to right whales. Documented effects in the scientific literature include impacts on reproduction, range, prey access, interactions with human activities, and individual health condition. 

Climate-driven changes to ocean circulation and water temperatures have affected the species&#x27; foraging and habitat use patterns, with numerous harmful consequences. Warming waters lead to decreased abundance of an important prey species, the zooplankton &quot;Calanus finmarchicus&quot;. This reduction in prey availability affects the health of the right whale population in numerous ways. The most direct impacts are on the survival and reproductive success of individual whales, as lower &quot;C. finmarchicus&quot; densities have been associated with malnutrition-related health issues and difficulties successfully giving birth to and rearing calves.

In 1998, zooplankton populations dropped dramatically following a climate shift. Though zooplankton abundance began to rise again in 1999, right whales have such a long reproduction and migratory cycle that the population was greatly affected by the minimal food availability from the year before. In 1999, only one right whale calf was born, compared to the 21 that were born in 1996, before the climate shift. In 2001, after the zooplankton populations greatly recovered, 30 calves were born.

Zooplankton abundance has been found to be associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the most influential climate force in the Northern Hemisphere. Periodically, pressure anomalies in the system shift from positive to negative as determined by the NAO Index, affecting temperatures and wind patterns. Abundant zooplankton populations have been linked to a positive NAO Index. As global temperatures increase, the NAO is predicted to shift more often and to greater intensities (so-called marine heatwaves). These shifts will likely greatly affect the abundance of zooplankton, posing a great risk for right whale populations that cannot rapidly adapt to a new food source.

Decreased abundance of &quot;C. finmarchicus&quot; as well as shifting seasonal temperature and ocean circulation patterns have also driven right whales to feed in different places and at different time of years compared to historical data. This has meant whales are present in habitats and times of year that are not accounted for by existing regulations intended to protect them from threats such as vessel strikes and gear entanglements. This has led to an increase in whale deaths alongside the decrease in births, which together account for recent population decline. Even without accounting for deaths which are unreported and undocumented, the number of whale deaths between 2017 and 2020 exceeded the number of births, a trend that could lead to extinction if unaddressed.

=== 2017 Unusual Mortality Event ===
The Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) defines an Unusual Mortality Event (UME) as &quot;a stranding event that is unexpected, involves a significant die-off of any marine mammal population, and demands immediate response.&quot; A UME for the North Atlantic right whale population has been active since 2017, a year where the population of under 400 individuals experienced 35 mortalities and morbidities. The most common direct causes of the deaths and injuries associated with the recent UME have been the same as ever (vessel strikes and entanglements), but there is an underlying connection to climate change. The temperature, circulation, and prey abundance changes associated with climate change have driven right whales to occupy new habitats (or existing habitats at new times of year), exposing them to anthropogenic threats outside of the scope of protective regulations. In particular, Canada&#x27;s Gulf of St. Lawrence was the site of 17 right whale deaths and injuries during the summer of 2017; research has since shown that whales had recently begun using the region consistently for the first time. 

== Population and distribution ==
It is not known how many populations of North Atlantic right whales existed prior to whaling, but the majority of studies usually consider that there were historically two populations, one each in the eastern and western North Atlantic. There are however two other hypotheses which claim, respectively, one super-population among the entire North Atlantic (with mixing of eastern and western migratory routes occurring at locations in relatively high latitudes such as in the Denmark Strait), and three sub-populations of eastern, western, and central Atlantic right whales (with the central stock ranging from Greenland&#x27;s Cape Farewell in summer to the Azores, Bermuda, and Bahamas in winter, although recent study indicates that the Azores had probably been a migratory corridor rather than a wintering ground).

Recent studies revealed that modern counterparts of the eastern and western populations are genetically much closer to each other than previously thought. Right whales&#x27; habitat can be affected dramatically by climate changes along with Bowhead whales.

=== Western population ===

In spring, summer and autumn, the western North Atlantic population feeds in a range stretching from Massachusetts to Newfoundland. Particularly popular feeding areas are the Bay of Fundy, the Gulf of Maine and Cape Cod Bay. In winter, they head south towards Georgia and Florida to give birth. According to census of individual whales identified using photo-identification techniques, the latest available stock assessment data (August 2012) indicates that a minimum of 396 recognized individuals were known to be alive in the western North Atlantic in 2010, up from 361 in 2005. Distributions within other parts of Bay of Fundy is rather unknown, although whales are occasionally observed at various locations in northern parts such as in Baxters Harbour or at Campobello Island.

Though their numbers are still scarce, some right whales migrate regularly into the Gulf of St. Lawrence, notably around the Gaspé Peninsula and in the Chaleur Bay, and up to Anticosti Island, Tadoussac and in the St. Lawrence River such as at Rouge Island. Until 1994, whales were regarded as rather vagrant migrants into St. Lawrence region, however annual concentrations of whales were discovered off Percé in 1995 and sightings in entire St. Lawrence regions have been shown gradual increases since in 1998. For example, in the survey conducted by the Canadian Whale Institute in 2006, three whales were detected off the peninsula. Some whales including cow and calf pairs also appear around Cape Breton Island with notable increasing regularities in recent years, notably since in 2014, and about 35 to 40 whales were confirmed around Prince Edward Island and Gaspe Peninsula in 2015. Further, the whales&#x27; regular range is known to reach up to off Newfoundland and the Labrador Sea, and several have been found in a former whaling ground east of Greenland&#x27;s southern tip.

Parts of the western group, especially for those seen regularly in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, display different migratory or calving routines than other whales and these are so-called &quot;Offshore Whales&quot;. There could be various areas along or off the west coasts where could have been frequented by whales potentially and might be re-colonized in the future such as Quoddy, Eastport, Plymouth Harbor, Sagamore Beach, Island of Nantucket, Florida Bay, Pamlico Sound, Gulf of Mexico (as far as to Texas), Bahamas, Long Island Sound and vicinity to New York City, the mouth of Potomac River, Delaware and Chesapeake Bay, the mouth of Altamaha River, Cape Canaveral, Sebastian Inlet and around Melbourne. As the population grows, it&#x27;s also highly possible that more whales would start using rivers or river mouths, shallow estuaries, smaller inlets or bays. Whales have already seen repeatedly at various of these such as Indian River Inlet, Delaware River, Cape Cod Canal, and Jacksonville Drum.

In early 2009, scientists recorded a record number of births among the western North Atlantic population. 39 new calves were recorded, born off the Atlantic coast of Florida and Georgia:
In contrast, 2012 was the worst calving season since 2000, with only seven calves sighted – and one of those was believed to have died. This is significantly below the annual average of 20 calves per year over the last decade. As the gestation period for right whales is a year long, researchers believe that a lack of food in the whales&#x27; summer feeding grounds in the Bay of Fundy during the summer of 2010 may be linked to the poor season in 2012. The right whale was purported to have reached a population of 500 in the North Atlantic, which was assumed to have been achieved for the first time in centuries, when counted in 2013. The population of the whale has been increasing at about 2.5 percent per year, but this is below the optimal goal of 6 or 7 percent that researchers were hoping to attain.

There were 411 of these animals left in 2019, when calves were born after a barren 2018. As of 2021, the population was estimated to be down to 350 whales.

In 2023, the whale population showed a slight increase from previous years, estimated at 372.

Aerial and shipboard surveys are conducted annually to locate and record seasonal distribution of North Atlantic right whales along the northeast and southeast United States coast. Researchers identify individual right whales, document whale behavior, monitor new calves, and respond to entangled whales. The surveys have been used to produce seasonal maps showing the density of right whales (number of animals per square kilometer) throughout the U.S. east coast and Nova Scotia. NOAA Fisheries maintains an interactive map of recent right whale sightings.

=== Eastern population ===

In the eastern North Atlantic, the right whale population probably numbers in the low double digits at best, with little information known about their distribution and migration pattern. Scientists believe that this population may be functionally extinct. The last catch occurred in February 1967 from a pod of three animals including a cow-calf pair: one escaped in Madeira and one was taken in the Azores. 

Cintra Bay and &quot;Bahia Gorrei&quot;, about 150 kilometers south of Villa Cisneros in the Western Sahara, the only known historical calving ground for this group, host no animals (or if any, then likely very few) nowadays, holding a situation similar to the Bay of Biscay area where many whales once congregated throughout years. Although there were several sightings in the late 20th century (see Bay of Biscay) and catch records indicate whales historically used the bay for both feeding and wintering, it is still unclear whether or not the Biscayne coasts were ever used as calving grounds. Other parts of coastlines or oceanic islands from Iberian Peninsula and Portugal to Morocco in north to south possibly reaching even Mauritania to Senegal. Locations such as Dakhla Peninsula and Bay of Arguin had been served potentially as wintering grounds similar to the Cintra and Gorrei Bays region. Historic presence of any summering or wintering grounds within the Mediterranean Basin including Black and Azov Sea is unknown although it has been considered to be feasible.

Entire European regions including French coasts, Hebrides, North and Baltic Seas, and further north up to Swedish, and Norwegian areas were once ranged by whales. Phenology of catch records in the early twentieth century in Nordic countries shows that whale presences in northern waters was at peak in June. In Ireland, catches were concentrated in the first half of June until 1930s and preceded catch in the Scottish bases of the Hebrides which were concentrated in the second half of June and July, and this indicates that those whales were likely to migrate along Irish coasts. Of all modern whaling grounds in European waters, Hebrides and the Shetland Islands were the center of whaling in the early 20th century, and any records afterwards these catches became scarce in eastern Atlantic where only two cow-calf pairs had been documented.

Any calm waters in north such as Porth Neigwl, the Wadden Sea region, Cornwall coasts, Moray Firth and in Irish Sea could have been migratory colliders/feeding or resting grounds, or seasonal habitats to stay for less-migrating or resident (fully or partially) individuals. Some might have reached to entrance of Baltic Sea and northern Scandinavian. Based on historical records, Scandinavian waters once had been a potential feeding area, and this idea corresponds with behaviors of the below mentioned vagrant individual &quot;Porter&quot; recorded in 1999 when he stayed in the fjord for several weeks, indicating the area provided to him a feasible condition for summering. Historical records suggest that summering grounds could have reached further north to northern coasts of Scandinavian Peninsula, and some might have turned up at the mouth of Hudson Bay.

Predicted summering range models suggest that small numbers of right whales could have been present year-round in the Mediterranean Sea although it is unclear whether whales ever penetrated Turkish Straits to Marmara, Black, and Azov Seas (historical presences at northern Aegean Sea were considered in this study which didn&#x27;t include the northernmost basins in study areas).

==== Sightings and confirmations in recent years ====

There have been a few sightings further east over the past few decades, with several sightings close to Iceland in 2003. There was speculation that these could be the remains of a virtually extinct Eastern Atlantic stock, but examination of old whalers&#x27; records suggest that they are more likely to be strays from further west. A few have been sighted in waters adjacent to Norway (two documented sightings in 1926 and 1999), Ireland, shelf waters west of Scotland, Irish Sea, the Bay of Biscay in Spain, off the Iberian Peninsula, a cow-calf pair at Cape St. Vincent in Portugal, and continuous sightings of a single animal off the southwestern Tenerife in the Canary Islands in 1995. Subsequently, there have been two more sightings in Benderlau, La Gomera and some other observations were reported in Portugal and Galicia. A whale of unknown species, thought to be a right whale, was seen off Steenbanken, Schouwen-Duiveland (Netherlands) in July 2005 and was possibly the same animal previously seen off Texel in the West Frisian Islands. Another possible sighting was made along Lizard Point, Cornwall in May 2012.

In the 2000s, sightings have also been recorded from pelagic waters such as off Hebrides and on Rockall Basin. In July 2024, one was spotted off the coast of County Donegal. 

Right whales have also on rare occasion been observed in the Mediterranean Sea. Since the two records of a stranding (Italy) and a capture of one of a pair seen (Algeria) in early 20th century, one sighting recorded in Dutch sighting scheme possibly between 1954 and 1957, only one possible sighting have been confirmed. In May 1991, a petty officer of the Italian Navy happened to be in the water with his camera about off the small island of Sant&#x27; Antioco (southwestern Sardinia), when a right whale happened to swim by – his photos comprise the only confirmed sighting in the 20th century; on the other hand however, reliability of the record have been questioned due to failures to contact the photographers. Earlier known occurrences of right whales in the basin include the stranding of a juvenile near Taranto (southeastern Italy) in 1877 and the sighting of two (one of which was later captured) in the bay of Castiglione (Algiers) in 1888 and Portugal. The Norway sightings appear to be of vagrants, or strays from the western Atlantic stock.
Catch records at Cape Verde Islands in spring-summer seasons are highly doubtful.

Below is a list of some of recent records of right whales in eastern North Atlantic (not all of above-mentioned records and excluding vagrant records, according to the Spanish edition of this article). Records and confirmations close to Newfoundland, Iceland, and Cape Farewell are also excluded.

==== Vagrants from the Western Population ====

Some eastern sightings have been officially confirmed to be of vagrants from the western population. A right whale seen off Cape Cod in May 1999 was later seen in the Kvænangen fjord in Troms, Northern Norway in September 1999. This individual was later confirmed to be &quot;Porter&quot;, an adult male in the catalog (No.1133). He was seen again back in Cape Cod in winter 2000, having traveled for over , making this the longest ever traveling record of right whales. The area vicinity to Scandinavian Peninsula was once in the historical &quot;North Cape Ground&quot;, one of the major whaling grounds for this species in the 17th century.

In January 2009, one animal was sighted off Pico Island, Azores, the first confirmed appearance there since 1888. This animal was later identified as a female from the western Atlantic group, and nicknamed as &quot;Pico&quot; according to this event.

Some individuals are known to show interesting patterns of movements which may possibly help researchers to deepen understandings of future re-colonization to eastern Atlantic, if possible.

=== Possible central population ===
Several biologists have mentioned the possibility that a third population exists, which ranges from near Iceland or Greenland in the north to Bermuda or the Bahamas in the south. Some right whales are now said to live primarily in Icelandic waters, occasionally joining up with the western population. In July 2003, a research team from the New England Aquarium investigated the possibility of right whales inhabiting the Cape Farewell region. They recorded a sighting of a female right whale in the Irminger Sea, southwest of the Iceland coast. She was later named &quot;Hidalgo&quot; due to a scar mark on her head resembling a horse.

In 2009, right whales appeared in waters around Greenland although their origin was not confirmed. Prior to this, no right whales had been killed or confirmed present off the coast of Greenland for around 200 years except for the sighting of &quot;1718&quot;, a unique animal seen only twice (off Cape Farewell in July 1987 and at the Nova Scotian Shelf in June 1989). Several sightings in the area made in the 1970s may or may not be of right whales, as the critically endangered population of Bowhead whales are also present in the area.

For southward migration, the sighting of two whales displaying courtship behaviors in the Bermuda was recorded by a team of researchers including Roger Payne in April, 1970.

== Conservation status ==
In the United States, this species is listed as “endangered” by the NMFS under the Endangered Species Act. It is also listed as &quot;depleted&quot; under the Marine Mammal Protection Act.

In Canada the species is federally protected under the Species at Risk Act (SARA). Since entanglement in floating gear accounted for 82% of documented right whale deaths in 2022, the Canadian Wildlife Federation has been providing ropeless equipment to snow crab fishers in and around the Gulf of St Lawrence.

On a global level, the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS, or the &quot;Bonn Convention&quot;) is a multilateral treaty specializing in the conservation of migratory species, their habitats and migration routes. CMS has listed the North Atlantic right whale on Appendix I, which identifies it as a migratory species threatened with extinction. This obligates member nations to strive towards strict protection of these animals, habitat conservation or restoration, mitigation of obstacles to migration, and control of other factors that might endanger them. 

Additionally, CMS encourages concerted action among the range states of many Appendix I species. To that end, a small portion of the eastern Atlantic population&#x27;s range is covered by the Agreement on the Conservation of Cetaceans in the Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea and Contiguous Atlantic Area (ACCOBAMS). The Atlantic area bounded on the west by a line running from Cape St. Vincent in southwest Portugal to Casablanca, Morocco, and on the east by the Strait of Gibraltar.

Another multilateral treaty, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, (CITES, or the “Washington Convention”), also lists the North Atlantic right whale on its own Appendix I. Being so listed prohibits international trade (import or export) in specimens of this species or any derivative products (e.g. food or drug products, bones, trophies), except for scientific research and other exceptional cases with a permit specific to that specimen.
== Whale watching ==
Either land based or organized whale watching activities are available along east coasts from Canada in north to Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia, Florida to south. Stellwagen Bank Sanctuary has also been designated for watching this species. Onlookers lucky enough can spot them from shores time to time on whales&#x27; migration seasons especially for feeding (vicinity to Cape Cod such as at Race Point and Brier Island), and breeding/calving (off Georgia to Florida coasts) when whales strongly approach shores or enters rivers or estuaries such as at Outer Banks, Pamlico Sound, Indian River Inlet, Cape Lookout, Virginia Beach, Virginia, Golden Isles of Georgia, beaches on Florida (e.g. most notably at Flagler, Jacksonville, St. Augustine, Ponte Vedra, Satellite, Crescent, and Cocoa, and any others like Ormond, New Smyrna, South Melbourne, Wrightsville, Vero), Boynton, and so on. There are some piers used for lookout points such as at Jacksonville and Wrightsville.

With their low profile on the water, right whales can be difficult to spot, so all fishermen and boaters transiting through potential right whale habitat should keep a sharp lookout. Boaters should be advised that NOAA Fisheries has a &quot;500-yard rule&quot;, prohibiting anyone from approaching within of a North Atlantic right whale. The regulations include all boaters, fishing vessels (except commercial fishing vessel retrieving gear), kayakers, surfers, and paddleboarders, and agencies such as the United States Coast Guard and the Massachusetts Environmental Police have been authorized to enforce it.

Right whale sightings can be valuable to researchers, who recommend all sightings be reported. In Florida, the Marine Resources Council maintains a volunteer sighting network to receive sighting information from the public and verify sightings with trained volunteers.

Due to the species&#x27; status, as of 2014, there is no whale watching location in eastern and mid Atlantic, and oceanic islands feasible to observe right whales regularly. Among these, only off Iceland right whales have been encountered during watching tours (save for expeditions and land-based observations targeting for birds and other faunas), and several observations were made in Iceland during the 2000s.

<text>The North Pacific right whale (Eubalaena japonica) is a very large, thickset baleen whale species that is extremely rare and endangered.

The Northeast Pacific population, which summers in the southeastern Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska, may have no more than 40 animals. A western population that summers near the Commander Islands, the coast of Kamchatka, along the Kuril Islands and in the Sea of Okhotsk is thought to number in the low hundreds. Before commercial whaling in the North Pacific (i.e. pre-1835) there were probably over 20,000 right whales in the region. The taking of right whales in commercial whaling has been prohibited by one or more international treaties since 1935. Nevertheless, between 1962 and 1968, illegal Soviet whaling killed at least 529 right whales in the Bering Sea and the Gulf of Alaska as well as at least 132 right whales in the Sea of Okhotsk, plus an additional 104 North Pacific right whales from unspecified areas.

The International Union for Conservation of Nature categorizes the species as &quot;Endangered&quot;, and categorizes the Northeast Pacific population as &quot;Critically Endangered&quot;. The Center for Biological Diversity argues that the North Pacific right whale is the most endangered whale on Earth.

== Taxonomy ==

Since 2000, scientists have considered the right whales in the North Pacific and nearby seas to be a separate species, &quot;Eubalaena japonica&quot;, the North Pacific right whale. Genetic differences between &quot;E. japonica&quot; and &quot;E. australis&quot; are much smaller than other baleen whales represent among different ocean basins.

Before 2000, right whales in the North Pacific were considered conspecific with right whales in the North Atlantic and Southern Hemisphere and all described as &quot;Eubalaena glacialis&quot; in the scientific literature. All these animals resemble each other in outward appearance very closely. The differences that separate them into separate species are genetic and discussed in the article on Balaenidae. The recognition of the different populations of &quot;Eubalaena&quot; whales as distinct species is supported by the Society for Marine Mammalogy, the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service, and the International Whaling Commission.

The North Pacific, North Atlantic and Southern right whales are all members of the family Balaenidae. The bowhead whale found in the Arctic is also a balaenid whale, but sufficiently different to warrant its own genus &quot;Balaena&quot;.

The cladogram is a tool for visualizing and comparing the evolutionary relationships between taxa. The point where a node branches off is analogous to an evolutionary branching – the diagram can be read left-to-right, much like a timeline. The following cladogram of the family Balaenidae serves to illustrate the current scientific consensus as to the relationships between the North Pacific right whale and the other members of its family.


== Description ==

&quot;E. japonica&quot; is a very large, thickset baleen whale. It very closely resembles the North Atlantic right whale (&quot;E. glacialis&quot;) the southern right whale (&quot;E. australis&quot;), so much so they were long thought to be just one species. Indeed, without knowing which ocean an individual came from, the physical similarities are so extensive that individuals can only be identified to species by genetic analysis. Relative to the other right whale species, &quot;E. japonica&quot; may be slightly larger. Like other baleen whales, female North Pacific right whales are larger than males. Also, North Pacific brindle-colored individuals are less common than they are among southern right whales.

&quot;E. japonica&quot; is easily distinguished from other North Pacific whale species by several fieldmarks: lack of dorsal fin or bump, very broad, black back, cyamid-covered callosities on the head and lips, a very arched jaw line, a very narrow rostrum, and often a V-shaped spout. North Pacific right whales can reach in length as adults, larger than the North Atlantic right whale. Typical body mass is from , or to which weighs twice as of typical humpback whales. There is one record of a whale captured during illegal Soviet operations, while reliability of larger measurements of with and 2 cases of one each from eastern and western pacific sides are uncertain. They are much larger than gray or humpback whales and also being very stout, particularly when compared to the other large baleen whales such as blue and fin whales. For 10 North Pacific right whales taken in the 1960s, their girth in front of the flippers was 0.73 of the total length of the whale. There have been claims that pectoral fins of pacific right whale are larger in portion than the other right whales and more pointed, and there may exist shape differences of tail by individuals or sex. Additionally, differences of coloration and shape (minor) of baleen plates between pacific and Atlantic have been noted.

Right whales are also unique in that they all have callosities—roughened patches of epidermis covered with thousands of small light-colored cyamids. The callosities appear in patches on its head immediately behind the blowholes, along the rostrum to the tip, which often has a large callosity, referred to by whalers as the &quot;bonnet&quot;. The functional purpose of the callosities has not been determined.

The closely related bowhead whale differs from the right whale by lacking any callosities, having a more arched jaw and longer baleen. The seasonal ranges of the two species do not overlap. The bowhead whale is found at the edge of the pack ice in more Arctic waters in the Chukchi Sea and Beaufort Sea, and occurs in the Bering Sea only during winter. The bowhead whale is not found in the North Pacific.

Although more than 15,000 right whales were killed by whalers in the North Pacific, there are remarkably few detailed descriptions of these whales. Most of our information about the anatomy and morphology of &quot;E. japonica&quot; comes from 13 whales killed by Japanese whalers in the 1960s and 10 whales killed by Russian whalers in the 1950s. Basic information about right whale lengths and sex are also available from coastal whaling operations in the early part of the 20th century.

== Ecology and behavior ==

=== Feeding ===
Like right whales in other oceans, North Pacific right whales feed primarily on copepods, mainly the species &quot;Calanus marshallae&quot;. They also have been reported off Japan and in the Gulf of Alaska, feeding on copepods of the genus &quot;Neocalanus&quot; with a small quantity of euphausiid larvae, &quot;Euphausia pacifica&quot;.

Like other right whale species, the North Pacific right whale feeds by skimming water continuously while swimming; this is in contrast to balaenopterid whales, such as the blue and humpback whales, which engulf prey in rapid lunges, surging upward rapidly from the depths. Right whales do not have pleated throats. Instead, they have very large heads and mouths that allow them to swim with their mouths open (similar to the basking and whale sharks); the water with the copepods flows in, then flows sideways through the right whale&#x27;s very long, very fine baleen trapping the copepods, and then out over their large lower lips. The mouth is then closed tightly to expel the excess water, with the prey being effectively trapped in the whale&#x27;s mouth, behind the baleen.

It takes millions of the tiny copepods to provide the energy a right whale needs. Thus, right whales must find copepods at very high concentrations, greater than 3,000 per cubic meter to feed efficiently. National Marine Fisheries Service researchers mapped the southeast Bering Sea and the Gulf of Alaska for areas with sufficient productivity to support such concentrations, and analyzed the roles of bathymetry and various gyres in concentrating copepods to such densities.

=== Behavior ===

There have been very few, short visual observations of right whale behavior in the North Pacific. The mid-19th century whaling onslaught occurred before there was much scientific interest in whale behavior, and included no scientific observation. By the time scientific interest in this species developed, very few whales remained and nowhere in the eastern North Pacific or Bering Sea could observers reliably find them. Based on limited observations in the 19th century, it was noted that the more extensively whaling was conducted, the whales became aggressive and harder to approach. These traits correspond to observations made in 2014 documenting that these whales seem to be sensitive to the presence of surface vessels, swimming away or submerging for longer periods of time, enough for onlookers and observers to lose sight of them. Pre-World War I whaling logs from Japan also describe right whales as being among the most sensitive of targeted baleen or toothed species to the impacts of whaling, as they immediately fled from locations where whaling took place, possibly abandoning their habitat for good.

As of 2006, scientists had minimal success satellite tagging North Pacific right whales. Observations total probably less than 50 hours over the last 50 years. What little is known about North Pacific right whale behavior suggests that it is similar to the behavior of right whales in other oceans, except in its choice of wintering grounds. The individual which was observed during a whale-watching tour off the Kii Peninsula, Japan breached six times in a row in 2006. The same whale watching operator had two sightings in 2006 and again had a very close encounter with a right whale in 2011. This animal was very curious and active; it swam around the vessel for more than 2 hours, breaching, spyhopping, tail-slapping, and pec-slapping close to the boat. The ship had to cruise away from the whale because it kept following them. Another curious and playful individual was encountered during a whale-watching trip off Bonin Islands in March 2014.

Like the other &quot;Eubalaena&quot; species, North Pacific right whales are known to interact with other cetacean species. Several observations of North Pacific right whales interacting with groups or solitary humpback whales have been recorded in both the Eastern and Western North Pacific. In 1998 a pair of gray whales was seen showing signs of aggression towards a right whale, chasing it off the coast of California, while in 2012, in the Piltun Bay region of Sakhalin Island&#x27;s northeast coast, a young adult right whale was seen displaying typical social behavior within a group of critically endangered Western gray whales.

==== Vocalizations ====
Right whales in the Southern Hemisphere and the North Atlantic make a variety of vocalizations that have been researched extensively in the last decade. Because the numbers of right whales in the North Pacific are so small, and the whales are located in more remote areas, the study of North Pacific right whale vocalizations has had more challenges and there are fewer recordings. All of the sounds recorded for North Pacific right whales have been recorded on the northern portion of their range—in the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska. It is unknown whether they made additional or different vocalization on their wintering grounds or on the western part of their range. From these relatively few samples it appears that right whales in the North Pacific make calls similar to those of other right whale species (&quot;Eubalaena&quot; spp.), although the calls may differ in some details and in the relatively frequency of usage of different calls.

These calls are all low frequency sounds that appear to have social communication functions, but what exactly those functions are is not yet known. There is no evidence that right whales&#x27; sounds are used for echolocation as is seen in dolphins and toothed whales.

Between 2000 and 2006 NOAA researchers deployed passive acoustic listening devices in the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska and recorded at least 3,600 North Pacific right whale calls . Nearly all of these calls came from the shallow shelf waters at approximately of the southeastern Bering Sea in what is now designated Critical Habitat for this species. 80% were frequency-modulated &quot;up-calls&quot; at an average 90–150 Hz and 0.7 second duration. &quot;Down-up&quot; calls constituted about 5% of the calls, and swept down for 10–20 Hz before becoming a typical &quot;up-call&quot;. Other call types, &quot;e.g.&quot; downsweeps and constant-tonal &quot;moans&quot; constituted less than 10% of total calls. The calls were clumped temporally—apparently involving some level of social interaction, as has been found in the calls of right whales in other oceans. The calls came more at night than during the day.

The upcalls of right whales are sufficiently distinct from the calls of other whale species that they can be used to identify the presence of right whales in the area by the calls alone, if care is taken in the review of those calls. Humpback whales also occur in much of the range of the North Pacific right whale, including in the Bering Sea, and parts of the highly variable and complex humpback calls can be similar to right whale calls, similar enough that confirmation that a call is in fact from a right whale usually requires a human to review the entire context of the call rather than simply relying on an algorithm to identify the call as is possible for other species.

Right whales in other oceans have been recorded making a percussive vocalization labeled a &quot;gunshot call&quot; or gunshot. The role and purpose of this call is uncertain. However, until 2017, it had never been proven than it was right whales in the North Pacific that were the whales making this type of call, so detection of gunshots was not considered a reliable indicator of the presence of right whales.

Until recently it was thought that the most common call used by North Pacific right whales was the &quot;upcall&quot;. This call is relatively stereotypic among all right whale individuals and populations. The next most common call has been labeled the &quot;downcall&quot; and this is also fairly stereotypic. Right whales also make a variety of other frequency-variable calls of different durations. However, these are so varied, they have not been categorized by researchers.

Until recently it was not proven that North Pacific right whales made a percussive call made by right whales in other oceans called a 
&quot;gunshot&quot;—that sounds like a shotgun being fired. Gunshot calls appear to be made by males and may be associated with some aspect of mating. Here is a link to audio recordings of these types of calls from a North Atlantic right whale.

In 2017, research by NOAA scientist Jessica L. Crance and other NOAA scientists was able to definitively attribute gunshots to North Pacific right whales, and found that among the animals sampled gunshots were heard ~50 times more frequently than upcalls. Because gunshots to be used much more and are less likely to be mistaken for a humpback call, this should improve the detectability of right whales in the North Pacific using passive acoustic monitoring, and improve the ability to locate individual whales from ships as well.

=== Habitat preferences ===

Right whales&#x27; habitat preferences vary depending on the time of year. In spring, summer and fall, the right whales are seeking concentrations of food. In winter, in the North Atlantic and Southern Hemisphere, pregnant females and their calves generally seek out shallow, protected bays in which to give birth and raise their calves. In the North Pacific, the pattern of right whales seeking out areas of high food is the same, but female right whales and calves in the North Pacific do not show the clear pattern of concentrating in nearshore aggregations. The distribution of North Pacific right whales in winter remains a major mystery.

Since there are so few right whales to observe in the North Pacific, and they are generally feeding far from shore, alternative analyses of habitat preferences are required. Gregr used maps of historic whaling catches and added oceanographic data from other sources to identify preferred habitats. His analysis suggest that on the scale of ocean basins, North Pacific right whales seek out regions of cold water with low inter-annual variability and high within-season variability (i.e. areas where high frontal activity occurred predictably from year to year). However, and a more localized regional scale these correlations weakened.

In winter, North Pacific right whales can occur from the Bering Sea as far south as the Bonin Islands. It is the whales that go south that are frequently seen close to shore. Right whales have historically been found closer to shore in very shallow waters than other large baleen whales, but they are by no means limited to near-shore habitats. There is a record of a female North Atlantic right whale giving birth 63 km off the shores of Jacksonville, Florida.

Many of the very near shore sightings of North Pacific right whales have occurred in Russia, Japan, and South Korea. They have been seen to enter into ports, staying just next to piers or wharfs, and there have been regular records of whales being entangled in set nets along Japanese and South Korean coasts in recent years.

There has been a record of rather aggressive interspecies interactions between a right whale and a pod of grey whales off California, making it the only record of possible interspecies aggression among baleen whales, but there have been an observation of social behaviors between the two species on Sakhalin. Furthermore, there is no decent population of grey whales existing outside of North Pacific as of 2014, therefore extents of interspecies competitions, if they&#x27;ve ever happened, or peaceful habitat sharing between these coastal species, before whaling, are unknown. A theory of humpback whales to invade and become a dominant species over Hawaiian islands, former wintering ground for right whales, in the past few centuries, corresponding with the timing of right whale hunts across the Pacific Ocean, had been claimed as well.

Summering congregations were known to occur among various areas based on whaling records. Following locations were with larger numbers of catch records: Korf in Olyutorsky, and Kambalny Bay. Of these, at least Kambalny Bay still hosts several whales at times; 5 whales were observed from shores in December, 2012.

== Historic and current population ==
=== Historic population ===

Before the arrival of the pelagic whaling fleet after 1835 into the range of the North Pacific right whale, the whale&#x27;s population size, at least in the eastern part of its range, was probably at its original population size—in the range of 20,000–30,000 whales. The part of the whale population in the west around Japan may have been reduced from its original size as a result of the historic net whaling.

There was essentially no aboriginal hunting for right whales along the west coast of North America by Native Americans in the 19th century or before. There was a small hunt for whales in the Aleutian Island by Aleuts but this was almost certainly so small that it did not reduce the original whale population size. Accordingly, one can consider 1835 as a good year to use as a baseline for the historic population, at least in the eastern North Pacific, and the northern parts of the western North Pacific.

There were no attempts to objectively estimate the population in the 1800s, so deriving a population estimate from the number of animals caught in the whale fishery is the only way attempted to date to determine the historic population size. In the single decade of 1840–49, between 21,000 and 30,000 right whales were killed in the North Pacific, Sea of Okhotsk and Bering Sea. To support this level of take by whalers in a decade, the population of this slow reproducing species of Okhotsk and nearby waters would have had to be in the range of 20,000–30,000 animals at a minimum. For comparison, a population of 20,000 or more animals is comparable to the current and presumably early 19th century population of Gray whales in the North Pacific

On the west side of the North Pacific, the situation was different because the Japanese had a tradition of hunting right whales from shore in Japan with the use of nets which had started centuries before the arrival of American whalers. In Japanese shore-based net whaling, right whales were the prime target, and the whale fisheries were devastating to the stocks as catch quantities declined greatly in relatively short periods, and the effect of the industries were more notable on the whale populations than the later American whaling, resulting not only in financial solvencies of many whaling groups but also in disputes between feudal domains in western Japan that required the shogunate itself to settle. Among this, it has been revealed that Japanese people have been trying to shift responsibility of whale declines to the later American whalers to control public opinions since at the end of the Edo period.

=== Current population ===
The current population of North Pacific right whales is estimated at 30–35 whales in the eastern North Pacific and 300+ whales in the western portion of its range. Even if one considers the combined population size estimate of both apparent stocks of this species, this is the smallest known population of any whale species aside from the North Atlantic right whale (est. 200–250), and probably only 2 percent of its population in 1835 when pelagic whaling first reached the North Pacific. Accordingly, the species is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List and the eastern population is categorized as Extremely Endangered.

The International Whaling Commission and the United States National Marine Fisheries Service consider North Pacific right whales found in these two areas to exist as two somewhat discrete populations and manage them as separate stocks. The extent of independence of these two apparent populations of whales both geographically and genetically is very poorly understood due to lack of data, but discussing them separately is convenient for describing recent sightings and population estimates.

==== Bering Sea and North East Pacific ====
Most recent sightings and acoustic records of right whales in the eastern part of their range have come from a relatively small area in the southeastern Bering Sea. Most of these records are within, or near, the U.S. designated Critical Habitat for the North Pacific Right whale. A much smaller number of sightings has come from the Gulf of Alaska and the coasts of British Columbia and further south. The very small number of North Pacific right whale calls detected during the NMFS acoustic research—hundreds per year contrast with the vastly greater number (hundreds of thousands) of bowhead whale calls during migration in the western Arctic and blue whale calls off California—further reinforces the conclusion that the population size of North Pacific right whales in the Bering Sea is very small.

A 2015 review of the status of all the baleen whales concluded that genetic and photo-ID mark-recapture analyses each suggest there are only about 30 animals left in the eastern subpopulation, mainly observed in the southeastern Bering Sea and with a male bias to the population. The 2015 reviewers had found no new information that increased the population estimate above that made in 2010 when National Marine Fisheries Service scientists estimated that the population of North Pacific right whales that summer in the southeastern Bering Sea was about 30 animals.

Prior estimates of larger current right whale population numbers in the eastern North Pacific were highly speculative. A comprehensive review of sighting data and population estimates in 2001 concluded that &quot;none of the published estimates of abundance relating to North Pacific right whales can be regarded as reliable ... [most] estimates appear to be little more than conjecture ... [and] no quantitative data exist to confirm any of these estimates.&quot;

The 2010 article was the first to present an objective quantitative rationale for its low estimates. The scientists&#x27; mark-recapture photographic studies suggested a population of 31 whales (95% confidence level = 23–54); and their genotyping study suggested a population of 28 whales (95% confidence level = 24–42). The scientists estimated the population contains eight females (95% confidence level = 7–18) and 20 males (95% confidence level = 17–37). They concluded that &quot;Although these estimates may relate to a Bering Sea subpopulation, other data suggest that the total eastern North Pacific population is unlikely to be much larger. In 2004, at least two calves were seen.

In the Gulf of Alaska, there have been opportunistic sightings (1998, 2004) and acoustic records (2000) of individual right whales near Kodiak Island.

Additionally, there have been two sightings of individual right whales off British Columbia in 2013. A third sighting was recorded in 2018.

==== Sea of Okhotsk and Western North Pacific ====

The 2015 review of whale status concluded that there are more right whales in the western North Pacific than in the eastern region, but even estimates of that population still places it among the world&#x27;s smallest populations of marine mammal.

In the west, most recent sightings of right whales occur along the Kamchatka Peninsula, in the Kurile Islands, in the Sea of Okhotsk, and the Commander Islands, along the coasts of Japan. A map of this area includes Russian territorial waters (12 miles from shore), Russian Exclusive Economic Zone out to 200 miles from shore, Japanese territorial and EEZ waters, and some international waters, even in the center of the Sea of Okhotsk. As a result, surveys for whales and fisheries have generally not been able to comprehensively survey the region, particularly close to shore, as has been possible to do in the eastern North Pacific.

===== The Sea of Okhotsk =====

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, observers on Japanese research vessels reported 28 sightings of right whales in the Sea of Okhotsk. From this sample, the Japanese scientists estimated a population of 900 right whales in the Sea of Okhotsk, albeit with wide confidence intervals (90% CI = 400–2,100). Data obtained during Japanese sighting surveys for minke whales in 1989, 1990, and 1992 led Japanese scientists to estimate a population of 922 right whales in the Sea of Okhotsk (95% CI: 404–2,108) (Miyashita and Kato 1998, IWC 2001:26). However, the reviewers who prepared the IUCN Red List documentation concluded that given the very wide confidence intervals surrounding the Japanese estimate and the lack of clear evidence of any recent increase in numbers, the lower end of the range of that abundance estimate (i.e., about 400) should be used for assessment (Reilly et al. 2008k). Other scientists also wrote that the Japanese estimate was based on faulty methodology and the population was likely to be only half as large or smaller.

After a gap of 14 years, Japanese researchers were able to resurvey this area in 2005 and apparently saw similar numbers of right whales in the same area.

===== Kuril Islands =====
A team of &quot;National Geographic&quot; and tourism companies encountered three whales at Paramushir and Shumshu, succeeded in swimming and taken underwater images, and aerial footage using a drone in 2017.

===== Japan =====
More recently, surveys for large whales in offshore waters east of Hokkaido (Japan) and the Kuril Islands from 1994 to 2013 resulted in 55 sightings of right whales (77 individuals) including ten female/calf pairs (Matsuoka et al. 2014).

===== Kamchatka =====
There were 19 sightings of 31 whales in the Russian EEZ (mainly around the northern Kuril Islands, the southern Kamchatka Peninsula and the Commander Islands) between 2003 and 2014 A 2015 review of sightings of right whales seen in Russian waters between 2003 and 2014.

Another 10 sightings of right whales in five groups were reported in 2012 surveys southeast of the Kamchatka Peninsula and off the Kuril Islands (Sekiguchi et al. 2014) and(Ovsyanikova et al. 2015). The 2015 reviewers concluded that all data collected since 1992 in the western North Pacific, especially the Sea of Okhotsk, need to be analyzed for a new abundance estimate so that an assessment can be completed for this subpopulation.

== Historic and current distribution ==
=== Historic distribution ===
Before 1840, the range of the North Pacific right whale was extensive and had probably remained the same for at least hundreds of years. It could be found from the Sea of Okhotsk in the west to the coast of Canada.

Our knowledge of the historic distribution of this whale comes almost entirely from the logbooks of the pelagic whalers (and the records of the shore-based whaling in Japan.) The first such effort were a series of charts known subsequently as the Maury &quot;Whale Charts&quot;.

In the late 1830s, the U.S. Navy sought wind and current information for areas of the oceans outside the trade routes regularly traveled by merchant ships. The principal mariners who ventured away from the main trade routes were whalers. One of the U.S.&#x27;s first oceanographers, Naval Captain Matthew Fontaine Maury, entered into an agreement with deal with the American pelagic whalers. If they provided him with their logbooks, from which he could extract wind and current information, he would in return prepare maps for them showing where whales were most concentrated. Between 1840 and 1843, Maury and his staff processed over 2,000 whaling logbooks and produced not only the famous Wind and Current Charts used by mariners for over a century, but also a series of Whale Charts. The most detailed showed by month and 5° of latitude and longitude: (a) the number of days on which whaling ships were in that sector; (b) the number of days on which they saw right whales; and (c) the number of days on which the saw sperm whales. In the North Pacific, these charts summarize more than 8,000 days on which the whalers encountered right whales and the searching effort by month and sector. The maps thus provide a crude measure of the relative abundance of right whales by geographic sector and month, controlled for the very non-random searching effort of the whalers.

In 1935, Charles Townsend from the New York Zoological Society (now the Wildlife Conservation Society) reviewed an overlapping set 2,000 whaling logbooks and mapped the locations of whale taken by species. His Chart C shows catch locations around the world, including the location by month of most of the 2,118 right whales taken in the North Pacific between 1839 and 1909, using data copied from 249 logbooks. His charts do not adjust for the nonrandom distribution of whalers. Chart C shows three main concentrations of right whales—one in the Gulf of Alaska; one along Kamchatka and the Sea of Okhotsk; and another in the Sea of Japan.

Maury&#x27;s detailed whale charts in this series languished largely forgotten in a few libraries until the 1980s. when they began to be studied more rigorously. The Maury charts have an advantage over the Townsend chart in that the number of whales seen/killed in a given area could be adjusted for the amount of searching effort that had occurred, giving a more accurate indication of the species abundance in that area in that month. The Maury charts also quantify the searching effort by region and month, whereas in the Townsend charts searching effort is dealt with only qualitatively.

North Pacific whalers hunted mainly in the summer, and that is reflected in the Maury Whale Charts. There were almost no winter sightings and very few south of 20°N. The densest concentrations occurred along both coasts of Kamchatka and in the Gulf of Alaska.

These initial studies of the historic records were reviewed more rigorously and combined with more recent information in 2004.

The Maury charts were based on tables transcribed by two assistants. More recent examination of the logbooks directly revealed that one of the assistants made numerous errors in the transcription of the logbooks.

Recently, the data from the data sheets behind the Maury and Townsend charts and other logbook data has been combined rigorously to provide the best maps yet of distribution of North Pacific right whales in the 19th century.

Of particular interest are the questions of how many &quot;stocks&quot; of right whales exist in the North Pacific. Was there just a single population across the North Pacific? Was there an eastern population that summered in the Gulf of Alaska and a second population in the western North Pacific? Was the population in the Sea of Okhotsk a third population distinct from the whales found in the Pacific east of Kamchatka?

Recently, researchers reanalyzed this early whaling data, along with more recent, but much sparser, sighting data. They conclude that there are probably at least two stocks of right whales in the western and eastern North Pacific, but that it is still unclear whether the Okhotsk population is a separate stock.
Though the North Pacific right whale&#x27;s distribution is usually more temperate than that of the more polar Bowhead whale, there are several records of the two species inhabiting the northeastern Sea of Okhotsk at the same time. &quot;E. japonica&quot; summer distribution extends north into the southeastern part of the Bering Sea. In summer, the Bowhead migrates north through the Bering Straits and is in the Chukchi Sea and Beaufort Sea. In winter, the ice-loving Bowhead moves south into the Bering Sea, but the right whales have migrated further south of the Aleutian Islands into the North Pacific.

Catch records suggest that historical ranges were much broader than that of current status, and was strongly overlapping with ranges of bowhead whales. In Bering Sea, feeding/summering grounds could have reached further north up to the Kusilvak Census Area such as at Kokechik and Scammon Bays in east, north of St. Matthew Island and Nunivak Island to south of the St. Lawrence Island in the central, in Litke Strait and the Karaginsky Island and Karaginsky Gulf in the west.

=== Modern distribution ===

==== Summer distribution ====

===== Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska =====

Despite many aircraft and ship-based searches, as well as analysis of listening device records, only a few small areas report recent sightings in the eastern North Pacific. The southeastern Bering Sea produced the most, followed by the Gulf of Alaska, and then California. In 2000, 71 calls were recorded by a deep-water passive acoustic site at . An additional 10 were recorded near Kodiak Island in the Gulf of Alaska at , another whale which is thought to be a sub-adult animal was observed in Uganik Bay in December 2011, being the first modern record of the species on the western side of Kodiak Island. This was one of the few sightings that has occurred in inshore waters in the area. One right whale was seen resting in Pasagshak Bay in May 2010. Other records along Gulf of Alaska include off Yakutat Bay in 1979, outer bank of Fairweather Ground at 100 km southwest of Cape Fairweather, and so on.

On August 10, 2004, a group of two were seen in the Bering Sea. Another sighting of 17 including two calves was noted in September, and one in the Gulf of Alaska. In 2005, 12 right whales were seen in October just north of Unimak Pass.

In August 2015, NOAA Fisheries conducted a three-week dedicated ship survey for North Pacific right whales in the Gulf of Alaska southeast of Kodiak Island covering 2,500 nautical miles with both visual observers and acoustic detection devices (sonobuoys). On March 10 and March 16 they heard calls from a single right whale in the area of Barnabas Trough southeast of Kodiak Island in the general area of the designated Critical Habitat. Despite intensive searching, they were unable to spot the animals visually.

Review of more than 3,600 North Pacific right whale calls detected by passive listening devices between 2000 and 2006 strongly suggests that the whales migrate into the southeast Bering Sea in late spring and remain until late fall. The earliest were in late May and the latest in December. The peak calling period was July through October. Most were detected from shallow shelf sites within the designated Critical Habitat area. From October through December 2005, several calls were detected at the northwestern middle-shelf and the deeper shelf sites, suggesting that they may appear at different seasons and during migration.

A proposed oil and gas lease of North Aleutian Basin in the SE Bering Sea caused the Minerals Management Service (MMS) of the Department of the Interior to fund at an annual cost of about $1 million a cooperative series of annual surveys with the National Marine Fisheries Service and the North Pacific Research Board (NPRB), with a focus on located right whales and gathering further information about them.

An Argos PTT satellite transmitter was deployed in one and the whale was monitored for 58 days, a period in which it remained in a relatively small area within the middle shelf of the Eastern Bering Sea, just to the north of the North Aleutian Basin.

A right whale was observed between Alaska Peninsula and Kilokak Rocks in July, 2017 which makes it the first confirmation of the species in the vicinity in the past half century.

===== Northwestern Pacific =====

There are very few reports of right whales in the western North Pacific. A remnant population of right whales persists in the Sea of Okhotsk at least in the summer, along with remnant populations of the western populations of gray and bowhead whales.

The distribution of these three species is quite different. In summer bowheads inhabit the northwestern corner of the Sea of Okhotsk around Academy and Ulban Bays to the Shantar Islands, while gray whales stay close to Sakhalin Island, near massive new energy developments. In contrast, the right whales inhabit the southern Sea of Okhotsk around the Kuril Islands and east of Sakhalin Island. Some recent sighting records are available.

Recent occurrences of right whales near the Kuril islands are largely unknown due to lack of observation effort; however, recent sightings indicate that the areas adjacent to Paramushir Island and surrounding, and west of the southern tip of the Kamchatka Peninsula are seemingly one of the most populated locations for this species today.

Even though the eastern coast of the Kamchatka Peninsula is considered as a feeding ground for right whales, only a few records exist from the eastern side including sightings in 1978 and in 2009.

Right whales were historically hunted in the Commander Islands heavily where only a handful of sightings are made in recent years, however, encounters with this species around the Commander Islands and off eastern Kamchatka seems to occur on a more regular basis compared to the last several decades.

This area&#x27;s remoteness makes observation very difficult and expensive. Based on survey records from &quot;JARPN&quot; and &quot;JARPN II&quot; conducted by Institute of Cetacean Research, the 40 right whales seen were distributed mainly in offshore waters from 1994 to 2007.

Pelagic whalers in the 19th century hunted large numbers of right whales along the coasts of Kamchatka and in the Sea of Okhotsk. The latter area is a large sea, ice covered most of the year, entirely in Russian waters. Due to Russian restrictions on access, little was known about whales in this sea. Soviet scientists indicated that historically two groups of right whales existed within western North Pacific that migrate along different side of Japanese Archipelago and each group had unique characteristics in distribution patterns due to geographical factors; the Okhotsk group which was distributed in more coastal waters with higher densities of congregations, and the Pacific group which have been distributed on far broader ranges and more was more oceanic (offshore). Of these, the Okhotsk group were regarded to be wiped out much earlier than the Pacific group because of geographical and distribution characteristics that eased whalers to hunt the targets, and this indication corresponds with the extreme rarity or virtual extinction of right whales in Sea of Japan or East China and South China Sea today.

Survey records from &quot;JARPN&quot; and &quot;JARPN II&quot; conducted from 1994 to 2007 by the Institute of Cetacean Research detected 28 groups of right whales totaling 40 individuals with 6 cow-calf pairs distributed mainly in offshore waters.

In summer 2009, a co-operative cetacean sighting survey was conducted in the Sea of Okhotsk by the Japanese National Research Institute of Far Seas Fisheries and the Russian (VNIRO) institute. During this survey, 17 groups of 29 right whales were recorded and photographed. Analysis of the photographs revealed no matches among the individuals resulting in a minimum record of 29 whales encountered during the survey.

Besides offshore waters, three major hot spots for right whales where with good increases in sighting numbers have been confirmed in coastal Russian waters have been detected: the Commander Islands, the First Kurilskiy Strait (between Cape Lopatka and Paramushir Island), and the east coast of Sakhalin including Piltun Bay, the only congregating area known for endangered western gray whales.

Pelagic waters off southeastern Kamchatka Peninsula is the location possibly with the highest sighting frequency in recent years even though this area is far offshore and it is unclear where these whales migrate southward.

==== Migration ====
Past thinking about North Pacific right whale migration presumed a paradigm of migratory behavior similar to that of other baleen whales in the North Pacific. Perhaps the extreme example of North Pacific whale migration is that of Gray whale. Nearly all the Gray whales that summer in the Bering Sea migrate to wintering grounds off Baja California. In summer and winter, nearly all the gray whales are either at the northern or southern ends of their range. Initially scientists assumed that North Pacific right whales had similar migratory pattern.

Analysis of 19th century pelagic whaling suggest that North Pacific right whales do migrate south in winter, but the whaling data did not indicate any specific migratory routes as seen in gray whales. The 19th century whalers travelled north in spring and south in fall. To some extent the apparent North Pacific right whale migration shown in the whaling data is an artifact of bias in the whaling effort.

More recent studies of right whales in North Atlantic and the North Pacific suggest a migratory pattern that is quite different than the gray whale example. In the North Atlantic, many right whales remain in the northern part of their range throughout winter. It appears that while some right whales migrate far south to warmer waters, a substantial percentage of the population either does not migrate as far south or may not migrate at all.

The collection of acoustic records of North Pacific right whales has revealed that portions of the North Pacific right whale population remains in the Bering Sea at least as late as December and as early as January. The acoustic research done in the Unimak Pass has shown right whales passing through this pass.

No coastal or other wintering ground has been found for North Pacific right whales. Which factors cause right whales not to favor inshore waters is unknown. Off the west coast of the United States, Point Conception is a turning location in terms of sighting records in the 19th and 20th centuries, and this may contribute to support the once-abandoned idea; existence of historical breeding grounds in coastal waters including along North American continent. Ryukyu Islands had been suggested as a wintering ground for the western population, but little evidence supports this. According to Maury&#x27;s chart, in winter, some concentrations could be seen at several areas such as the southern Sea of Japan, around southern coasts of Korean Peninsula (such as around today&#x27;s Dadohaehaesang National Park on southwestern Korean Peninsula) and Jeju Island, areas off Shanghai and the Zhoushan archipelago, Taiwan Strait (e.g. Fujian coasts like Pingtan Island, Penghu Islands, west coast of Taiwan), the northwestern Hawaiian Islands. (with smaller areas scattered among southern Korean and Japanese waters). In Asia, southernmost of areas with higher catch densities were the pelagic waters between continental China (latitudes equal to Shanghai and Zhoushan Islands) and west of Kyushu in south to southern coasts of Korean Peninsula during the summer. Some whales were caught off Hainan Island and this area is possibly the southernmost location of known range for the western population. The whales are also known to occur around the northern Mariana Islands. A map had been academically created which forecasts potential wintering habitats for right whales in north Pacific according to environmental factors corresponding to that of north Atlantic species, including further south to Hainan, Leizhou Peninsula, and northern Gulf of Tonkin. Historical occurrences of vagrancy around Borneo have been considered as well, while possibilities of migrations to or through Philippines are unclear.

The population (s) historically migrated through the Sea of Japan to the Yellow and Bohai Seas was likely driven to functional extinction. No right whales have been recorded in China and in South Korea since the catches in October 1974 for Korea and 1977 for China, and there have been only two confirmed records of a stranded and a by-caught individuals since in 1901 in Japanese waters of the Sea of Japan.

Constant appearances in both sides of Pacific were recorded until 1998 and all the southernmost records at four locations of almost same latitude were made in both sides around 1996–97; Amami Ōshima, Bonin Islands, Hawaii, Cabo San Lucas. Last records off west coast were in 1998 off Cape San Martin and Monterey. Afterwards, any records ceased until 2014. In Bonin Islands and off Oregon and California, constant occurrences were confirmed in the 1990s. What factors caused sudden rise in sighting trends in the 2010s and disappearance in the 2000s in many of former range especially for mid-lower latitudes are unknown. The Bonin Islands are the only location where sighting interval of constance was confirmed and succeed underwater filming in modern times. Off Japan, sudden rises in number were confirmed in 2003, 2006, 2008, and in 2011 where an exceptionally large number was recorded in 2011; at least 3 or more sightings, 1 entanglement, 1 stranding of 18 m animal. Fragments of a lower jaw, measuring 4.6 m in length and likely to be artificially sliced off, was discovered on a beach in Akkeshi in June 2014.

==== Western North Pacific ====
===== Japan =====

The occurrence of North Pacific right whales in Japanese waters appears to show several patterns. Historic and modern sightings appear to occur more frequently in three areas: (1) the north, particularly north of Hokkaido, (2) along the coasts of central Japan, and (3) among Japan&#x27;s southern islands, particularly the Bonin Islands.

The waters around and north of Hokkaido historically where regions where 19th century pelagic whalers hunted for right whales during summer and fall. This region and north through the Kuril Islands, the southern Sea of Okhotsk and Kamchatka were feeding grounds for the right whales. Some of the recent sightings of right whales off Japan are consistent with this pattern.

Right whales were formerly abundant off the coast of northeastern Japan where there have been a few sightings in recent years including observations from ICR research surveys (single animals confirmed off Kushiro, Hokkaido, in September 2002 and off the Pacific coast of Honshu in April 2003). Local fishermen have regularly seen a few animals per year in the area (personal contact). There is one unconfirmed sighting off the Shiretoko Peninsula in 2008.

A breaching right whale was observed during a sightseeing cruise off the Shiretoko Peninsula in July 2013 making it the first confirmed sighting in the area for several decades and the first recorded in Hokkaido. A right whale, most likely the same individual, was seen in the area for the following two weeks until a pod of local killer whales came back to Shari coasts. The observer noted many of local tour-operating boats cruising at high speeds did not seem to detect the whale resting on water surface and forced the right whale to submerge quickly to avoid collisions. In 2018 and 2019, additional sightings have been made from the west coast of the peninsula. 2018 sighting and one of two sightings in 2019 have been made by the same tour operator, Doutou Kanko Kaihatsu (Corporation) (:jp:道東観光開発).

The occurrence of right whales along the coasts of central Japan appears to reflect the migration of right whales past these points. There are some locations along the Pacific side of Honshu where sightings are particularly more common; from south of Tokyo Bay to all around the Izu Peninsula, from the Izu Islands to the Bonin Islands, the Kii Peninsula, Cape Muroto and adjacent waters. In the first area, there was one entanglement freed alive in April 2000 off Tateyama, and two strandings at Izu Ōshima in 2002 and 2005.

Some right whales still migrate south along Japan&#x27;s coasts particularly the Pacific side of the archipelago, but what portion of the southward migration passes Japan is unknown.

The occurrence of right whales among the southern Japanese islands suggest that a wintering ground may occur around there.

An right whale was entangled off Kamogawa coast in May, but escaped while another carcass was seen floating off Cape Nozaki. A right whale of was sighted on January 28, 2014, making it the first record in the East China Sea in the 21st century. One whale about the same size entered the port of Ushibuka, Kumamoto on March 28, 2014.

In addition, possibly two different animals were seen off Bonin Islands on 12th and 25th March 2014. Later one was larger, and was curious towards whale-watching vessels. The whale was observed interacting with a Humpback whale. Izu and Bonin Islands are regions with highest confirmed sightings and strandings rates among tropical regions in the past century. In 1993, Yasuhiro Morita of Ogasawara Diving Center succeeded in encountering right whales on four occasions near the Bonin Islands.

Most of recent sightings have occurred along the Japanese coast. Historically, right whales may have wintered in the East China Sea from the Ryukyu Islands to south of China including Taiwan though there is little scientific evidence supporting this idea. Modern sightings in the East and South China Seas, or Yellow and Bohai Seas are very rare, and the number of records is small. Only a few confirmed sightings in the area have occurred, and all the 5 records in the East China Sea in the last 110 years were recorded only on Amami Ōshima island and with Sukomobanare Island. Additionally, all of the modern records of right whales on mainland coasts of China were concentrated on the island of Haiyang in northern Yellow Sea.

Right whales may have wintered in the Bonin Islands, but few sightings in recent decades support this idea. The Ogasawara Whale-watching Association reported seeing 3 groups of 4 different right whales in the Bonin Islands in the 1990s (two animals from different groups were photographed and recorded on underwater video); A pair of possible right whales were seen migrating south outside the port of Aogashima in December 2007. Another group of 2 or 3 animals appeared just off Mikura island in March 2008. One animal was sighted very close to shore in Niijima, 2011 (later described). A small right whale was seen nearby Manazuru Peninsula on April 3, and one or two right whales were sighted off Miyake Island on April 21, 2016.

Off the Kii peninsula, there was one sighting in June 1999, one mortal entanglement in April 2003, and three records of two animals in the spring-summer 2006 (both from many whale watching vessels). One of these whales was very active. A right whale escaped alive from a fishing net near Taiji Town in January 2009, a very close observation during whale watching tour (later described) in April 2011. An individual was sighted off Kushimoto within a pod of rough-toothed dolphins in February, 2016. Off Cape Muroto, two entanglements (both escaped safely) were reported in February 1971 and February 2008. Two adults stranded in the northern and southern Ibaraki Prefecture in 2003 and 2009.

Modern sightings in the Japan Sea are very seldom made. Some strandings were reported from the 1970s to late 2000s, but none of the possible sightings of right whales were published or confirmed. Whaling of right whales continued until 1978 in the Sea of Japan. A photo of a Right whale being hunted in 1922 in the Sea of Japan is available.

Unusually high numbers of right whales were recorded off Japan from February to mid-April 2011. One mature female of body length was stranded on the Shimoda coast on the southern Izu Peninsula. Carcass of this individual was not covered by barnacles. It had been previously sighted off Inatori, and another animal was sighted very close to shore off Inatori again. A photo and a video are available. Another possible right whale was observed just outside a port in Manaduru in May (no photo was taken).

In the Izu Islands, one whale was observed very close to shore, tail-slapping for an extended period of time. No photo of its head was taken.

Off Kii Peninsula, in April 2011, the same whale-watching operator who had encountered two right whales in 2006 had a very close encounter with a right whale. This whale was very curious and active; it swam around a vessel for more than 2 hours, displayed all the aerial actions several times (breaching, spyhopping, tail-slapping, pec-slapping) alongside the vessel, and the vessel had to cruise away from the whale because it kept following the vessel. Many professional whale photographers were on this tour, some of them were also on the board when this tour operator during the 2006 sightings.

Some whale watching or touring companies have encountered with several right whales or on several occasions such as several companies associated with Ogasawara Whale Watching Association (four animals in the 1990s), Nanki Marine Leisure Service (three animals in 2006 and 2011), Mikura Island Tourism Association (two whales in 2008), Godzilla-rock cruise (&quot;Gojira-iwa kankō&quot;) and its subsidiary, Shiretoko Fox Cruise since the 2000s (more than three times at least), Heritage Expeditions (at least three whales in the 2010s).

A young right whale was killed when it entangled itself in a net off Ōita Prefecture in March 2011. In fact, this was reported by a biologist who saw a right whale&#x27;s meat being sold at a local market, later reported to a local aquarium.

A sailor on a yacht had a very close encounter with a cow-calf pair breaching off Miura Peninsula in the earlier 2000s. This sighting was later confirmed by a local marine biologist working at an aquarium.

=== Wintering/calving grounds ===

No coastal or other wintering ground has been found for North Pacific right whales. Which factors cause right whales not to favor inshore waters is unknown.

Most recent sightings of &quot;E. japonica&quot; occurred near the coasts; however, as of 2014, none of studies to detect the wintering/calving grounds for &quot;E. japonica&quot; have been successful though there is an ongoing project by North Pacific Research Board to locate those areas with a hypothetical situation that &quot;E. japonica&quot; historically preferred coastal waters along east coasts of North American continent.

Reviewing of other &quot;Eubalaena&quot; species&#x27; biology, as the population of &quot;E. australis&quot; in New Zealand primarily use subantarctic Auckland and Campbell Islands as wintering/calving grounds, and the majority of non-calving adults of &quot;E. glacialis&quot; winter in pelagic waters of Bay of Fundy with recent records of new-born calves present in the region. These areas are known to be feasible for feeding/summering; hence, it is possible that it is not always necessarily for right whales in North Pacific to migrate to warmer waters for wintering/calving, and historical wintering ranges could have been much broader than previously considered. Large portions of southern rights also wintered in pelagic waters in the past, from sub-polar to nearby Equator regions.

In winter, the whales&#x27; distribution is particularly mysterious. There have been a few sightings close to shores in California and even Baja, particularly in the 1990s along locations like La Jolla, Point Sur, Big Sur coasts, Piedras Blancas, San Simeon, Point Montara, and in Santa Barbara Channel. They have been rare, of short duration and none since 1998. Largest numbers of whales sighted at one times in eastern Pacific outside of SE Bering Sea since after the late 20th century were of 8 animals off Destruction Island in 1959, sightings off Cape Flattery of 3 whales in and 1967 and 6 or 7 whales in 1973, 4 whales at the mouth of Yakutat Bay in March 1979, a pod of 2 or 3 whales at Three Arch Rocks in Oregon in 1994, and likely a pair seen off southwest of San Miguel Island in February 2015. In the western Pacific, the latest of recent records were of a close encounter by a yachter with a cow-calf pair off Sajima Island in Sagami Bay in the early 2000s and a pod appeared close to the pier on Mikura Island in 2008.

==== Eastern North Pacific ====

Off the west coast of the United States, Point Conception is a turning location in terms of sighting records in the 19th and 20th centuries, and this may contribute to support the once-abandoned idea; existence of historical breeding grounds in coastal waters including along North American continent.

Until recently, most researchers thought that right whales in the eastern North Pacific wintered off the west coast of North America, particularly along the coasts of Washington, Oregon and California. There have been few winter sightings in all these areas, particularly in California. A more detailed study argues that these single individuals were merely stragglers. Notwithstanding 7 days/week whale-watching operations in several parts of this range, there have been only 17 sightings between Baja and Washington state. The absence of calves from historic California stranding data suggests that this area was never an important calving or wintering ground. When a right whale was observed along the coast of La Jolla in 2017, the animal was initially misidentified as a gray whale.

==== Western North Pacific ====

Modern observation of right whales in southern Japan and in Izu and Bonin Islands, and in Amami Ōshima, didn&#x27;t show any signs of whales spending long periods there (although being relaxed, resorting activities have been confirmed) and mostly whales left in a few days, thus where these individuals spent most time in those winters are largely unclear. Only record of longer staying was of Shiretoko sighting in 2013 as possibly the same individual stayed along western coasts of the peninsula for two weeks, and this case was in summer. It is unclear whether the two sightings from the same area on June 25 and July 19, 2019, belong to the same individual (see above).

There are remote (hence less pressures from impacts of human activities) and unstudied areas still possessing less – damaged environments where right whales were historically distributed, scattering among North Pacific and adjacent waters. These include northern proportions of Sea of Japan within Russian, North Korean, and Japanese EEZ such as along Primorsky Krai like Rudnaya Bay and Peter the Great Bay, northern Korean Peninsula and adjacent islands such as at East Korea Bay, Ulleungdo, Oki Islands, pacific islands, atolls, seamounts, and guyots in lower latitude such as Ladd Seamount, north of Northern Mariana Islands, north of Babuyan Islands, small, outer islands and atolls of Taiwan and those in South China Sea such as Pengjia Islet, Green Island, Lanyu, adjacent to Kenting and Dapeng Bay like Xiaoliuqiu, Dongsha Atoll, and vicinity to Marshall Islands, and Midway Islands. According to other &quot;Eubalaena&quot; species&#x27; seasonal distribution, some proportions of Pacific right whales could winter in colder waters, and congregation areas could also be restricted into particular harbors or straits of particular oceanic islands. It could be also said that wintering distributions of &quot;E. japonica&quot; could have extended further south to regions near the Equator line, according to the historical distributions of right whales in South Pacific that a population existed to winter on pelagic waters on lower latitude which is comparable to latitudes of Diego Garcia, Egmont Islands, and Great Chagos Bank, or even crossing the line on occasions where &quot;E. australis&quot; have been known to reach Kiribati, Gabon, and &quot;E. glacialis&quot; likely migrated south to Mauritania to Senegal in the past.

=== Korea ===

The first record of a living animal since after the whaling in the Sea of Japan occurred at Namhae near Busan in February 2015, 41 years after the last record in the Korean EEZ.

=== China ===

There was a sighting off Shenzhen in 2015 although this was broadcast as a humpback whale, and the first stranding of the species was recorded on Shandong Province between 2000 and 2006.

== Whale watching ==

There have been several locations where right whales have been observed regularly close to shore among western north Pacific in recent years, but to observe right whales purposely in commercial operations is a different story. Expedition tours targeting Sea of Okhotsk, Kamchatka, and Commander islands region allows the highest possibilities to observe these whales, however, to encounter with North Pacific right whales during whale watching tours are extremely low, only a handful of operators around the world have had. One extraordinary case occurred in Japan. &quot;Nanki Marine Leisure Service&quot;, a whale-watching operator working off Kumano-nada sea had 2 encounters of different animals in 2006, and another one in 2011. For sighting in 2011, it could be one of the most well-recorded observations ever in the history as some of aerial behaviors was observed for the first time such as keep following vessels over several hours, continuously displaying almost all-known surface behaviours of the species in a row. Several cameramen were on board both in 2006 and 2011, and Kenji Oda, a professional whale cameraman had two encounters in 2006 and later. The Bonin islands is the location with the second-highest sighting rates during commercial tours, followed by the Izu Islands.

== Threats ==
In adopting a Recovery Plan for the North Pacific right whale, the United States government (NOAA) described its evaluation of the various threats to the continued survival of the species. Under Section 4(c)(2) of the Endangered Species Act, NOAA must review the status of all threatened and endangered species at least once every five years to determine if their listing status should be changed. NOAA published it most recent 5 Year Review of the status of the North Pacific Right Whale on February 13, 2024.

=== Unsustainably small population ===
When populations of wild animals get very small, the population becomes much more vulnerable to certain risks than larger populations. One of these risks is inbreeding depression.

A second risk of very small populations is their vulnerability to adverse events. In its 2006 Status Review, NMFS stated &quot;E. japonica&quot; low reproductive rates, delayed sexual maturity, and reliance on high juvenile survivorship combined with its specialized feeding requirements of dense schools of copepods &quot;make it extremely vulnerable to environmental variation and demographic stochasticity at such low numbers&quot;. For example, a localized food shortage for one or more years may reduce the population below a minimum size. As the NMFS Status Review notes: &quot;Zooplankton abundance and density in the Bering Sea has been shown to be highly variable, affected by climate, weather, and ocean processes and in particular ice extent.&quot;

A third risk is an inability to find mating partners. With so few whales in such a large area, simply finding a mate is difficult. Right whales generally travel alone or in very small groups. In other oceans, breeding females attract mates by calling. The success of this strategy depends upon having males within hearing range. As expanding shipping traffic increases the ocean&#x27;s background noise, the audible range for such mating calls has decreased.

=== Oil exploration, extraction, transport and spills ===
Oil and gas exploration and production in the right whale&#x27;s range could threaten the species&#x27; survival as a result of oil spills, other pollution, ship collisions and noise. In its 2006 Status Review, NMFS notes that the development of the Russian oil fields off the Sakhalin Islands in the Sea of Okhotsk &quot;is occurring within the habitat&quot; of the western population of North Pacific right whales.

There have been recent oil spills in the Bering Sea. In 2005, the wreck of the M/V &quot;Selendang Ayu&quot; near Unalaska released approximately of fuel oil and of diesel into the Bering Sea.

The exploration phase of oil development is characterized by numerous ships engaged in seismic testing to map undersea geological formations. Testing involves blasts of noise which echo off the undersea rock formations. These explosions have been banned in the Beaufort Sea during the time of year that bowheads are present. In its 2006 Status Review, NMFS concludes: &quot;In general, the impact of noise from shipping or industrial activities on the communication, behavior and distribution of right whales remains unknown.&quot;

On April 8, 2008, a NMFS review found that there had been no recent Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas activities in or adjacent to the areas designated as critical habitat for &quot;E. japonica&quot;. On the same day, the U.S. Minerals Management Service (MMS) published a notice of a proposed Oil and Gas Lease Sale 214 for in the North Aleutian Basin. In January 2009, the MMS reported in a Scoping Report for the Environmental Impact Statement for the Lease Sale that &quot;Many commentators expressed concern about impacts resulting from industrial activity and noise to the North Pacific right whales.&quot; More than half of the proposed Oil and Gas Lease Sale 214 in the Bering Sea is within the designated critical habitat of the North Pacific right whale.

On March 31, 2010, President Obama issued a memorandum for the Secretary of the Interior withdrawing Sale 214 from disposition by leasing through June 30, 2017, the Bristol Bay area of the North Aleutian Basin in Alaska. Right whales were not mentioned specifically in the reasons for this withdrawal.

=== Environmental changes ===
The habitat of &quot;E. japonica&quot; is changing in ways that threaten its survival. Two environmental effects of particular concern are global warming and pollution.

The high densities of copepods that right whales require for normal feeding are the result of high phytoplankton productivity and currents which aggregate the copepods. Satellite studies of right whales show them traveling considerable distances to find these localized copepod concentrations.

Global warming can affect both copepod population levels and the oceanographic conditions which concentrate them. This ecological relationship has been studied intensively in the western North Atlantic.

=== Hybridization with bowhead whales ===
Recently, scientists have begun to notice that the warming Arctic Ocean and land is resulting in changed distribution of species with the result of breaking down climate barriers that have prevented hybridization between closely related species. The most reported examples have been the three confirmed grizzly–polar bear hybrids. In 2010, a team led by National Marine Mammal Laboratory ecologist Brendan Kelly counted 34 possible hybridizations between distinct populations or species of Arctic marine mammals, many of which are endangered or threatened. These observed hybridizations included in 2009, a cross between a bowhead whale and a North Pacific right whale in the Bering Sea. Kelly stated that &quot;The breedings between the North Pacific right whale, whose numbers have fallen below 200, and the more numerous bowhead whale, could push the former to extinction. (Over time, the hybrids would begin to outnumber the sparse right whales.)&quot; Co-author Andrew Whitely wrote: &quot;Breedings between these marine mammals near the North Pole are likely to result in fertile offspring, because many of these animals have the same number of chromosomes...[and] Over the short term the hybrid offspring from these Arctic animal matings will likely be strong and healthy, because unlike inbreeding, which magnifies deleterious genes, so-called outbreeding can mask these genes ... But over time, as the hybrids mate randomly, those harmful genes will come out of hiding and make the offspring less fit and less capable of surviving.&quot;

In Sea of Okhotsk, habitat sharing with an endangered population of bowhead whales have been confirmed at northern parts of the sea especially within the region contains Akademii and Ul&#x27;bansky Bays as well as critically endangered western gray whales. Whales may appear into northeastern part as well such as Shelikhov Gulf. Extent of effect to both species by habitat sharing is unknown.

=== Entanglement in fishing gear and interaction with marine debris ===

In its 2013 evaluation of the threats to survival of the North Pacific right whale, NOAA examined the possible impacts of entanglement in fishing gear and ingestion of marine debris. Entanglement in fishing gear is a major threat to the survival of the North Atlantic right whale. Marine debris includes, among other items, abandoned or lost fishing gear and small plastic items that could be ingested.

There is year around commercial fishing in the range of the North Pacific right whale in both the Bering Sea and the Gulf of Alaska. and also in the western part of its range around Kamchatka, the sea of Okhotsk, and the Japan. Entanglement in fishing gear can both result in the death of the whale relatively quickly, or result in long-term stress that reduces the whale&#x27;s health leading to less reproduction or death.

As more attention has been paid to the issue of whale entanglement with fishing gear, more records of entanglements are discovered. Here is a list of entanglements of North Pacific right whales in fishing gear:

* February 2015 – a young right whale became entangled in the ropes of a musselaquaculture operation in Korea. (The whale was eventually released.)

In the eastern Bering Sea gear is deployed in nearshore waters, areas &quot;not associated and generally not overlapping with known North Pacific right whale distribution.&quot; Pot fisheries occur in offshore waters, but are often deployed in winter when right whales are not known to be present.

* October 2016 – Japan, a 9.5m whale was killed in entanglement in the Volcano Bay, Hokkaido. The body was processed to products on sale.
* June 2013 – British Columbia, Canada. One of the two right whales seen had serious injuries to its rostrum that appear to have been caused by entanglement in fishing gear.
* 2011 – Japan a young right whale was killed by being entangled in net in Ōita Prefecture. This death was reported by a biologist who saw a right whale&#x27;s meat being sold at a local market, later reported to a local aquarium.
In the Sea of Okhotsk entanglement in fishing gear, like deep-water crab traps and Japanese pelagic driftnet gear for salmon may be a significant problem.

All the modern records of entanglement have involved Japanese fisheries including cases in the Russian Far East in which about 60% of all cetacean (medium to larger species) entanglements recorded in the Sea of Okhotsk were caused by Japanese fisheries.
* August 3, 2003 – in the Sea of Okhotsk at 47° 04 580N 146°-06-566&quot;E two right whales sighted in 3,200 m water depth. One of the whales had a big scar anterior to the blowhole caused by fishing gear such as the mainline from crab nets (photos).
* December 25, 1996 – in the Sea of Okhotsk, one right whale found alive but entangled in crab net gear. The whale was released from the gear, but escaped carrying 5 m of mainline still attached.
* September 1, 1995 – in the Sea of Okhotsk, one whale dead from entanglement in unspecified gear at 
* August 1992 – Sea of Okhotsk one whale found alive with fishing gear wrapped on the tail flukes
* 1994 – Japan (October) dead from entanglement in Japanese drift net

=== Ship collisions ===
Collisions with commercial ships are the greatest threat to North Atlantic right whales. Both summer feeding ranges and winter calving grounds are located in busy shipping channels. &quot;E. japonica&quot; does not frequent shipping channels. In the North Pacific, this threat is probably smaller, but it still exists.

All larger cetaceans passing through under threats of being struck by vessels on various sea-lanes in Asian nations, especially in the Tsushima Strait. Japanese Coast Guard has started to collect sighting records of large whales in the area, but majorities of species identities of each records are unspecified in their log, hence it is unknown if any right whales have ever been actually sighted.

=== Ship noise ===
In its 2013 Recovery Plan, NOAA reviewed the scientific evidence on the effects of ship noise on right whales at length. No studies have been done on North Pacific right whales due to the difficulty of even finding them. Several studies have been done on North Atlantic right whales which are reviewed. Ship noise in the oceans has increased dramatically due to both the amount of shipping and the exploration for oil and gas. The increased noise may make right whales more vulnerable to being struck by ships. It may also impose a sublethal level of stress on them that might impact their health. (citation).

NOAA concluded that &quot;the severity of ship noise to North Pacific right whales is unknown and uncertainty of the threat is high. Therefore, the relative impact to recovery is ranked as unknown.&quot;

=== Predation ===
The 2013 U.S. Recovery Plan noted that there is &quot;currently no evidence&quot; of predation on North Pacific right whale by killer whales, and that none of the photos of North Pacific right whales showed no images of tooth rake marks typical of killer whale attacks, but &quot;this is not to suggest ... this predation does not occur, only that it has not been observed&quot;.

There are records of sharks attacking North Atlantic right whales on their calving grounds. In the Canadian Arctic 17 Inuit reported having seen killer whales attack bowhead whales.

The U.S. Recovery Plan concludes that any predation would likely have a larger impact on calf and subadult age classes, and that the relative impact to recovery from predation is ranked as low severity and medium uncertainty.

=== Whaling ===
Historic whaling is the reason North Pacific right whales are so endangered today. The two critical periods of whaling were 1839 to 1849 (pelagic whaling, 90% American ships) and 1963 to 1968 (illegal Soviet whaling). The illegal Soviet whaling in the 1960s killed 514 right whales in the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska to plus 136 right whales in the Sea Okhotsk and the Kuril Islands.

Although whaling was the principal threat to North Pacific right whales, there is no record of whalers targeting this species since the 1980s. Accordingly, this threat appears minor at this time.

=== Lack of funding for management, research and conservation ===
Trying to research and manage human interactions with whale populations that are spread out geographically in remote areas and hard to locate is expensive. With governments around the North Pacific facing reductions in budgets, funding for such efforts are becoming increasingly difficult to obtain. Most of the research on the right whales in the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska was funded as part of proposed leases for oil and gas exploration that recently have been deferred and that funding ended. The U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service reports &quot;currently there is no funding at all for North Pacific right whale research despite the critically endangered nature of this population.&quot;

In Japan, the only system of collecting reports of large whales along the Japanese coast is the ICR Strandings Record – this applies only to stranded individuals, hence the limited knowledge about the biology of free-swimming right whales in Japan. There were more unpublished or unreported sightings of right whales confirmed by locals in recent years in which some important observations such as a cow-calf pairs observation close to shore are included (personal contact). For example, a sailor on a yacht had a very close encounter with a cow-calf pair breaching off Miura Peninsula in earlier 2000s. This sighting was later confirmed by a local marine biologist working at an aquarium.

== Conservation ==

=== The challenge of finding right whales ===

A threshold problem for conserving this species is locating them. Other right whale species can reliably be found on their feeding grounds (North Atlantic right whale), or on their wintering grounds (both North Atlantic and Southern right whale). In contrast, there are no reliable places where researchers can find North Pacific right whales. In the eastern portion of their range, there are so few whales that researchers have described it looking for a needle in a haystack. In the western portion of their range, the ability of researchers to find right whales in the Sea of Okhotsk and Kuril Islands is greatly hindered by the difficulty and expense of getting access to these areas which are in Russian territorial waters and EEZ, and by the fog that makes visibility minimal.

Until recently nearly all the records of North Pacific right whales have been visual observations from ships or from shore. However, on their summer grounds in the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska, the sea conditions are frequently so rough, windy and/or foggy that detection of right whales known to be present is problematic. In 2015, a NOAA research cruise in the Bering Sea off Kodiak focused on finding right whales detected acoustic signals on two occasions from a right whale, but in neither case were the researchers able to visually locate the whales. Previous NOAA dedicated ship surveys in the southeast Bering Sea also have had only sporadic success in visibly locating right whales. A month-long NOAA dedicated research cruises in August 2007 in the southeast Bering Sea sighted no right whales.

More recently, scientists have increasingly been using a new technology to acoustically detect right whales. As described above, right whales make calls that can be distinguished from the calls of other species so that researchers have concluded they such detections constitute reliable records based solely on the acoustic recordings.
The technology is able to detect submerged animals, independent of water clarity.

Acoustic searching for North Pacific right whales has been done with two types of listening devices. Directional and ranging sonobuoy are floating devices that are deployed from ships are monitored for short periods of time (hours) from ships. Alternate listening devices are permanently moored acoustic recorders that acoustically sample over long periods (months) until the acoustic is retrieved by a ship.

Acoustic detection and visual searches are often used in conjunction. Right whales are detected acoustically then are located visually by shipboard observers. In August 2004, NOAA listening devices in the southeastern Bering Sea detected right whale vocalizations. The researchers then deployed directional and ranging sonobuoys to locate the calling whales. This information allowed researchers to find visually the whales and photograph, biopsy dart (to collect genetic samples) and tag two whales.

Researchers have also developed increasingly sophisticated and durable satellite tags that can be attached to whales, including right whales. These tags can collect information for months about the long-distance travels of whales, and have produced information on movements of right whales in the North Atlantic and Southern Hemisphere. satellite-monitored radio tags. These are non-lethal, and applied with a crossbow, can beam the whales&#x27; location, movements, dives and other information to researchers. However, the only occasion on which researchers have visually detected a right whale and been able to attach a satellite tag was on the 2006 NOAA research in the Bering Sea. Only one of the deployed tags worked, and it failed after 40 days, just as the whale was expected to start its southern migration. During that period the whale moved throughout a large part of the shelf, including areas of the outer shelf where right whales have not been seen in decades.

 and 1997–2004.

There may be locations in the Sea of Okhotsk where right whales can reliably be found in summer. In the Sea of Okhotsk, the right whales are currently distributed far from shore in the southern part of the sea. The Sea is mainly Russian territorial waters, so Russian cooperation is required for any surveys. The remoteness of the location and the enormous demand for ships and aircraft associated with oil and gas exploration near Sakhalin Island, make any ship or aerial surveys difficult and expensive.

=== International law ===
After World War I, the major whaling nations of the time (Norway, Great Britain, United States) became increasingly concerned by the depletion of blue whales and other whale species, and entered into first international whaling treaty in 1931: the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling which became effective in 1935 after ratification by the member nations. The treaty banned the hunting of all right whales. However, Japan and the Soviet Union did not ratify the treaty, and thus were not bound by it. Attempts to bring the other major whaling nations under an international regime stalled until after World War II.

In 1946 the major whaling countries signed the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling which established the International Whaling Commission (IWC) whose regulations first took effect in 1949. Since its inception, the IWC has banned the commercial hunting of right whales. Currently, the IWC classifies &quot;E. japonica&quot; a &quot;Protection Stock&quot; which bars commercial whaling.

However, the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling explicitly allows member countries to issue permits to their own citizens kills whales for scientific research, even if that species is otherwise protected from commercial hunts. In 1955, the Soviet Union granted it whalers permits to kill 10 North Pacific right whales, and in 1956 and 1958 the Japanese granted permits to its whalers to kill 13 North Pacific right whales. The member nation issuing the scientific permit must report these permits to the International Whaling Commission. The 23 North Pacific right whales taken pursuant to these permits provide much of published morphology and reproductive biology data for this species. No further scientific whaling permits have been issued by any country to take North Pacific right whales.

During the 1960s, the IWC did not place observers on whaling ships. Whaling nations were expected to monitor their own whalers. The Soviet Union abused this process, directing its whalers to capture thousands of protected blue whales, humpback whales and right whales around the world. The Soviet Union&#x27;s massive illegal whaling of North Pacific right whales is described in the discussion on historic whaling. The IWC did not require the Soviet Union (and other member nations) to have foreign observers on their ships until 1972, at which time the Soviet Union entered into agreement with Japan for Japanese observers on Soviet whaling ships.

Under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) all right whales (&quot;Eubalaena&quot; spp.) are listed in Appendix I which bans all international commercial trade of parts or products of right whale species.

Under the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) the North Pacific right whale is listed on Appendix I (CMS) as this species has been categorized as being in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant proportion of their range and CMS Parties strive towards strictly protecting these animals, conserving or restoring the places where they live, mitigating obstacles to migration and controlling other factors that might endanger them.

=== United States laws and regulations ===
Actions involving the North Pacific right whale are subject to three separate laws. First, the Whaling Convention Act of 1949 authorizes the federal government to adopt regulations that mirror the regulations (the &quot;Schedule&quot;) adopted by the International Whaling Commission, including the IWC&#x27;s ban on the commercial take of any right whales.

Second, the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) gives jurisdiction for management of all whale species to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of the Department of Commerce. NOAA determined that the North Pacific right whale is currently &quot;depleted&quot; as that term is used in the act in 1973. Such classification affords the species various protections under the MMPA.

Third, under the Endangered Species Act, NOAA has listed the North Pacific right whale as &quot;endangered&quot;. This law provides the species with additional protections which overlap those of the MMPA, but generally are more protective.

==== Critical habitat ====
The Endangered Species Act directs the managing agencies, in this case NOAA, to designate portions of oceans as &quot;Critical Habitat&quot; which triggers specific protective measures.
On October 4, 2000, the Center for Biological Diversity (CBD) petitioned NMFS to designate the southeast Bering Sea shelf from 55 to 60°N as critical habitat for &quot;E. japonica&quot;. On February 20, 2002, NMFS declined (67 FR 7660) at that time, arguing that available information was insufficient for such a finding. CBD challenged NMFS in court, and in June 2005, a federal judge directed the agency to make a designation. In 2006, NMFS complied, designating one in the Gulf of Alaska south of Kodiak Island and one in the southeast Bering Sea (71 FR 38277, July 6, 2006). Later, NMFS split the &quot;northern right whale&quot; into &quot;E. glacialis&quot; and &quot;E. japonica&quot;, and reissued its rule.

Critical habitats must contain one or more &quot;primary constituent elements&quot; (PCEs) that are essential to the conservation of the species. NMFS identified as PCEs: species of large zooplankton in right whale feeding areas, in particular the copepods &quot;Calanus marshallae&quot;, &quot;Neocalanus cristatus&quot;, and &quot;Thysanoessa raschii&quot; whose high lipid content and occurrence make them preferred prey items., and physical concentrating mechanisms, physical and biological features that aggregate prey into densities high enough to support efficient feeding.

NMFS simply used repeated right whale sightings in the same small area in spring and summer as a proxy for the presumed PCEs.

These areas support extensive and multi-species commercial fisheries for pollock, flatfish, cod, various crabs and other resources (but not salmon). NMFS ruled that these fisheries do not threaten PCE availability. NMFS also ruled that the zooplankton PCE was vulnerable to oil spills and discharges, which may require measures such as conditioning federal permits or authorizations with special operational constraints.

Once a critical habitat has been designated, federal agencies must consult with NOAA to ensure that any action they authorize, fund or carry out is unlikely to destroy or adversely modify it.

On March 10, 2022, the Center for Biological Diversity filed with the NMFS a &quot;Petition to Revise the Critical Habitat Designation for the North Pacific Right Whale (&quot;Eubalaena japonica&quot;) Under the Endangered Species Act&quot;, urged expansion of the critical habitat designation to &quot;a migratory corridor through the Fox Islands in the Aleutian chain, including Unimak Pass, and feeding grounds near Kodiak Island.

On September 26, 2023, NOAA issued its &quot;12 Month Finding&quot; in response to the CBD&#x27;s Petition, concluding in part:

&quot;Given the acoustic detections and sightings supporting North Pacific right whales&#x27; use of areas outside of the currently designated critical habitat and the recent shifts in the essential features of critical habitat (i.e.,certain zooplankton species), we intend to revise critical habitat.&quot; 


==== Recovery plan ====

In June 2013, NOAA issued a formal &quot;Recovery Plan for the North Pacific Right Whale&quot; pursuant to the Endangered Species Act. The Recovery Plan describes the current state of scientific knowledge of the species and the threats to its continued survival. The Plan also contains proposed conservation measures, which mainly consist of various research proposals including passive acoustic monitoring, satellite tagging, and review of historic whaling logbooks.

=== Canadian regulation ===
In Canada, some right whales had been caught in the early 20th century from whaling stations off northern Vancouver Island. There had been no sightings of right whales in Canadian waters since the large illegal Soviet kill in the 1960s with two exceptions of a pair confirmed off Haida Gwaii at – in 1970 and two large whales seen on Swiftsure Bank off Strait of Juan de Fuca in 1983 though their species was unconfirmed. There were no officially-confirmed records until the sighting of a single right whale on June 9 and 13, 2013, south of Langara Island at the north end of the Queen Charlotte Islands (Haida Gwaii), in British Columbia (~ 54°N, 132°W) followed by the second sighting of a different individual at the mouth of the Strait of Juan de Fuca four months later. Furthermore, a possible right whale was observed by a naturalist at the milepost 8 nearby Kydaka Point in October, 2014.

In 2003, Fisheries and Oceans Canada issued a National Recovery Strategy for &quot;E. japonica&quot; in Pacific Canadian Waters. In 2012, Fisheries and Oceans Canada issued an analysis of critical habitat for North Pacific right whales, and blue, fin and sei whales in British Columbia. In 2013, Fisheries and Oceans Canada issued a &quot;Draft Partial Action Plan for Blue, Fin, Sei and North Pacific Right Whales (&quot;Balaenoptera musculus&quot;, &quot;B. physalus&quot;, &quot;B. borealis&quot;, and &quot;Eubalaena japonica&quot;) in Pacific Canadian Waters&quot;.

== History of whaling ==

=== Whaling before 1835 ===
In Japan, hunting for right whales dates back at least to the 16th century, although stranded whales had been used for centuries before then. In 1675, Yoriharu Wada invented a new method of whaling, entangling the animals in nets before harpooning them. Initially the nets were made of straw, later replaced by the stronger hemp. A hunting group consisted of 15–20 &quot;Seko-bune&quot; or &quot;beater&quot; boats, 6 &quot;Ami-bune&quot; or netting boats and 4 &quot;Mosso-bune&quot; or tug boats, for a total of 30–35 boats with crews totaling about 400. In addition to right whales, they took gray whales and humpback whales.

Hunts took place in two regions: the south coast (modern Mie, Wakayama and Kōchi Prefectures) on the east coasts, and the waters north of the prefectures from Kyoto to Yamaguchi and to the west of Kyūshū which hunted in the Sea of Japan. Off the south coast of Japan, hunting lasted from winter to spring. Catches in Kōchi Prefecture between 1800 and 1835 totaled 259 whales. Catches at Ine on the Sea of Japan during the period 1700–1850 averaged less than 1 per year. Catches at Kawaijiri also on the Sea of Japan averaged 2 per year from 1699 to 1818.

A few Native American tribes hunted in the North Pacific. Their catches were much lower than the Japanese. The Inuit along the western and northwestern coasts of Alaska have hunted whales for centuries. They prefer the bowhead whale, and occasionally the gray whale. They hunted at or beyond the northern limits of the right whale&#x27;s range.

Aleuts hunted &quot;E. japonica&quot; and Gray whales along the Aleutian Islands and the Alaska peninsula, using poisoned harpoons. The catch was not recorded, but is unlikely to have been more than a few per year.

The Nootka, Makah, Quileute and Quinault tribes of Vancouver Island and the coast of Washington were also skilled whalers of the gray and humpback whales. Right whales were rare in their catches.

The North Pacific was the furthest whaling ground from New England and Europe markets. During the open-boat whaling era, the mainly American ships hunted in the nearest ranges first. As the fleet grew, boats spread to the eastern North Atlantic and, by the 1770s, the South Atlantic. Following the lead of the British, American vessels first sailed the South Pacific in 1791, and by the end of the decade had reached the eastern North Pacific. By the 1820s, the whalers had started to use Lahaina, Hawaii, as a base for hunting sperm whales.

=== Pelagic: 1835–1850 ===
In 1835, the French whaleship &quot;Gange&quot; ventured north of 50°N and became the first pelagic whaling ship to catch a North Pacific right whale. News of this find spread quickly. Whaleships north of 50° increased from 2 in 1839 to 108 in 1843 and to 292 in 1846. Approximately 90% of the whaleships were American, the remainder primarily French.

The focus of the North Pacific whaling fleet on right whales ended soon after 1848, when a whaler ventured through the Bering Straits and discovered unexploited populations of bowhead whales. Being more abundant, easier to capture, and yielding far more baleen, the majority of whalers rapidly switched to hunting bowheads. Since bowheads range further north than right whales, hunting pressure on right whales declined rapidly.

The estimated total catch in the fishery in the Gulf of Alaska, Bering Sea, North Pacific and Sea of Okhotsk was 26,500–37,000 right whales between 1839 and 1909. Eighty percent of this catch was concentrated in the single decade of 1840–49.

=== Industrial: 1850–1930s ===
In the decade between 1850 and 1859, the catch dropped to 3,000–4,000 animals, one-sixth the previous level. Between 1860 and 1870, it dropped to 1,000 animals. By the end of the 19th century, pelagic whalers averaged less than 10 right whales per year.

In the late 19th century, steam propulsion and the explosive harpoon opened up new whaling opportunities. Species previously too swift to hunt commercially could now be caught—blue and fin whales. Small coastal whaling operations opened in California, Oregon, and Washington, British Columbia, and in the Aleutian Islands and in southeast Alaska, and in the Kuril Islands in the west. Whalers hunted by day, towing their catch to shore for flensing, operating in a fairly small area around the whaling stations. Although they weren&#x27;t the primary targets, a few right whales were recorded in catches from these stations. A close-up photo of a North Pacific right whale taken at the Kyuquot whaling station, British Columbia in 1918 can be seen here.

=== After the official protection ===
The later &quot;factory ships&quot; that processed carcasses while at sea further transformed pelagic whaling. Right whales continued to be taken, although uncommonly due to their rarity. Japan continued hunting right whales through the beginning of World War II. Afterward, General Douglas MacArthur, head of Allied occupation forces, encouraged the Japanese to resume whaling to feed their hungry population. Japan then joined the International Whaling Commission which barred the hunting of right whales. Except for 13 killed under &quot;scientific permits&quot;, in accordance with IWC rules, Japanese whalers have honored this prohibition.
Possibly, several hundred whales (mostly unreported or unrecorded) were taken by Japanese until the late-1970s, including mass captures off southeastern Hokkaido and off Akkeshi. In 1977, one of a pair firstly sighted at beaches in Numadu was driven into port of Kumomi next day and was killed (although majority of medias even the museum itself claim that people tried their best to save the whale who stranded him/herself). A local museum (雲見くじら館) was later built specially for displaying the animal&#x27;s carcass. In the late 1970s, at least two cow-calf pairs were confirmed during cetacean surveys by Institute of Cetacean Research in very nearby area of Suruga Bay and off Bentenjima Island in Enshunada Sea, and another whale was observed in exactly the same area (Kumomi) in 1996 as well.

In the 1970s, four right whales were taken by Chinese (or actually by Japanese) and Korean whalers. At least two whales were taken off Haiyang in the Yellow Sea in by Japanese whalers in 1944, and another pair was also taken by Japanese whalers in north of the island in January 1973 where both of these were later made to be specimen where smaller specimen became the only specimen (with skins and baleens) of the species in the world at the Dalian Natural History Museum, and the larger individual is now on the Zhejiang Museum of Natural History. reaching around 16–17.1m, and were later made to be specimens for exhibition at several locations. Last record of the species in the nation was of a single whale being killed in the south of Haiyang Island in December 1977. There have been none of confirmed records along Chinese coasts targeting right whales since after the last catch (or a sighting) in 1977. For the catches in the Yellow Sea, P Wang, the same researcher who reported the catch in December 1977 off Haiyang Island in the Yellow Sea mentioned that it was possibly the same record as one in 1944 by Japanese whalers. Many of these captured individuals were rather large individuals as reaching around 16 m (52.5 ft), and were later made to be specimens for exhibition at several locations. There have also been an unknown number of modern catches off Taiwan as well.

World&#x27;s last catch records of the species were claimed to be two catches by Japanese whalers in the Yellow Sea in 1994.

=== Illegal Soviet whaling: 1962–1968 ===
Historically, compliance with fisheries regulations regarding species caught and amount of the catch could be monitored when the fishing vessel returned to port, but with whaling factory ships, the whales were processed at sea, and the resulting products from all the baleen whales (whale oil, meat) were combined into a single commodity by the time the whaling ship reached port. As a consequence, a whaling operation that caught a protected right whale could cover up this infraction by combining the meat and oil with that from legal catches and misreporting it as a legal catch of a fin or several minke whales which would yield the same amount of product. Before DNA analysis of meat products became available very recently, such infractions could not be detected when the factory ship returned to port.

At the time, the only way to monitor compliance was by having whaling &quot;inspectors&quot; on the factory ships themselves to record the species and size of whales caught. When the International Whaling Commission (IWC) was established in 1946, monitoring of compliance with and enforcement of the IWC&#x27;s regulations was the responsibility of each member nation with respect to its nationals&#x27; whaling operations. Each nation employed its own whaling inspectors at whaling stations and aboard whaling factory ships. Each member nation of the IWC was required to report to the IWC annually on compliance, describing the specifics of any infractions (e.g. number of illegal whales caught of which species), and what actions the member nation had taken regarding these infractions. The IWC itself has no legal authority to monitor whaling operations or impose sanctions on whaling operations for infractions. This policing of the whaling fleets by their own governments persisted until 1972 when the IWC established a system of international observers on whaling ships.

In the 1960s, Soviet whalers had no international observers on board, and no conservation groups following them at sea. By 1962, humpback, blue and fin whales were getting harder to find in the North Pacific, and the Soviet whalers, under great pressure from their own government to meet production targets, deliberately chose to hunt right whales, apparently killing every right whale they could over the next eight years, in the North Pacific and also the southern oceans. The Soviet government then filed fraudulent reports with the Bureau of International Whaling Statistics and the International Whaling Commission, admitting killing during this period only one right whale, by accident.

These Soviet infractions remained a state secret for four decades. In many instances, the Russian biologists who had been on the whaling ships were prohibited from examining the carcasses or taking any biological measurements of these whales. Nevertheless, several biologists kept their own records of what the whalers caught, then kept these records secret. After the collapse of the Soviet government, the new Russian government released at least part of the data on the true catch data.

In 2006, former Soviet whale biologist Nikolai Doroshenko published records of 372 right whales caught by the Soviet whaling fleets &quot;Vladivostok&quot; and &quot;Dalnij Vostok&quot; in the Bering Sea and eastern North Pacific between 1963 and 1968. He also documented an additional 126 right whales killed in the Sea of Okhotsk between 1963 and 1968 and another 10 in the Kuril Islands in 1971.

Doroshenko did not have information regarding catches by a third Soviet whaling fleet, the &quot;Sovetskaya Rossiya&quot;, operating in the Gulf of Alaska in 1962–1963 that caught 142 right whales that were additional to the 372 previously revealed. Of the whales killed by the &quot;Sovetskaya Rossiya&quot; fleet, 112 were killed in June 1963 in the central and northern Gulf of Alaska.

In 2012, newly discovered documents revealed that the total illegal catch was even larger. The accounting based on that information showed that the Soviet whaling fleets caught 529 right whales from 1962 to 1968 in the eastern North Pacific, plus 152 more right whales in the Sea of Okhotsk in 1967 and 1968, for a total of 661 right whales. Catches were distributed in the Bering Sea (115), eastern Aleutian Islands (28), Gulf of Alaska (366), Sea of Okhotsk (132), and other areas (20). Detailed information on catches of 112 right whales taken in May/June 1963 shows a broad distribution in offshore waters of the Gulf of Alaska, consistent with 19th century historical whaling records. Other major areas in which right whales were caught include south of Kodiak Island, western Bristol Bay (southeastern Bering Sea), and the central Sea of Okhotsk off eastern Sakhalin Island. The catches primarily involved large mature animals, thus greatly inhibiting recovery of right whales in these regions.

Since that 2012 accounting for illegally caught whales was published, the principle analyst for that study has increased her estimate of the total North Pacific right whales caught by the Soviet whalers in the North Pacific and Sea of Okhotsk from 661 whales to a new total of 765 whales, but details of the distribution of those additional whales is not yet published.

It was also revealed that Japan was in fact &#x27;helping&#x27; this destructive hunt in terms of neglecting and disregarding monitoring obligations and there were agreements between Japan and Soviet to keep their illegal mass whaling activities in foreign/international protected waters in confidentiality.

<text>Victor Vasarely (; born Győző Vásárhelyi, ; 9 April 1906 – 15 March 1997) was a Hungarian-French artist, who is widely accepted as a &quot;grandfather&quot; and leader of the Op art movement.

His work titled &quot;Zebra&quot;, created in 1937, is considered by some to be one of the earliest examples of Op art.

== Life and work ==
Vasarely was born in Pécs and grew up in Piešťany (then Pöstény) and Budapest, where, in 1925, he took up medical studies at Eötvös Loránd University. In 1927, he abandoned medicine to learn traditional academic painting at the private Podolini-Volkmann Academy. In 1928/1929, he enrolled at Sándor Bortnyik&#x27;s private art school called &quot;Műhely&quot; (lit. &quot;Workshop&quot;, in existence until 1938), then widely recognized as Budapest&#x27;s center of Bauhaus studies. Cash-strapped, the &quot;műhely&quot; could not offer all that the Bauhaus offered. Instead, it concentrated on applied graphic art and typographical design.
In 1929, he painted his &quot;Blue Study&quot; and &quot;Green Study&quot;. In 1930, he married his fellow student Claire Spinner (1908–1990). Together they had two sons, Andre and Jean-Pierre. Jean-Pierre was also an artist and used the professional name &#x27;Yvaral&#x27;. He worked for a ball-bearing company in accounting and designing advertising posters in Budapest. Vasarely became a graphic designer and a poster artist during the 1930s combining patterns and organic images.
Vasarely left Hungary and settled in Paris in 1930. He worked as a graphic artist and as a creative consultant at the advertising agencies Havas, Draeger, and Devambez (1930–1935). His interactions with other artists during this time were limited. He thought of opening an institution modeled after Sándor Bortnyik&#x27;s &quot;műhely&quot; and developed some teaching material for it. Having lived mostly in cheap hotels, he settled in 1942/1944 in Saint-Céré in the Lot &quot;département&quot;. After the Second World War, he opened an atelier in Arcueil, a suburb about 10 kilometers from the center of Paris (in the Val-de-Marne &quot;département&quot; of the Île-de-France). In 1961, he finally settled in Annet-sur-Marne (in the Seine-et-Marne &quot;département&quot;).
Vasarely eventually went on to produce art and sculpture using optical illusion. Over the next three decades, Vasarely developed his style of geometric abstract art, working in various materials but using a minimal number of forms and colours:
* &quot;1929–1944&quot;: &quot;Early graphics&quot;: Vasarely experimented with textural effects, perspective, shadow, and light. His early graphic period resulted in works such as &quot;Zebras&quot; (1937), &quot;Chess Board&quot; (1935), and &quot;Girl-power&quot; (1934).
* &quot;1944–1947&quot;: &quot;Les Fausses Routes – On the wrong track&quot;: During this period, Vasarely experimented with cubistic, futuristic, expressionistic, symbolistic and surrealistic paintings without developing a unique style. Afterwards, he said he was on the wrong track. He exhibited his works in the gallery of Denise René (1946) and the gallery René Breteau (1947). Writing the introduction to the catalogue, Jacques Prévert placed Vasarely among the surrealists. Prévert creates the term &quot;imaginaries&quot; (images + noir, black) to describe the paintings. &quot;Self Portrait&quot; (1941) and &quot;The Blind Man&quot; (1946) are associated with this period.
* &quot;1947–1951&quot;: &quot;Developing geometric abstract art (optical art)&quot;: Finally, Vasarely found his own style. The overlapping developments are named after their geographical heritage. &quot;Denfert&quot; refers to the works influenced by the white tiled walls of the Paris Denfert – Rochereau metro station. Ellipsoid pebbles and shells found during a vacation in 1947 at the Breton coast at Belle Île inspired him to the &quot;Belles-Isles&quot; works. Since 1948, Vasarely usually spent his summer months in Gordes in Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur. There, the cubic houses led him to the composition of the group of works labelled &quot;Gordes/Cristal&quot;. He worked on the problem of empty and filled spaces on a flat surface as well as the stereoscopic view.

* &quot;1951–1955&quot;: &quot;Kinetic images, black-white photographies&quot;: From his &quot;Gordes&quot; works he developed his kinematic images, superimposed acrylic glass panes create dynamic, moving impressions depending on the viewpoint. In the black-white period he combined the frames into a single pane by transposing photographies in two colors. &quot;Tribute to Malevitch&quot;, a ceramic wall picture of adorns the University of Caracas, Venezuela which he co-designed in 1954 with the architect Carlos Raúl Villanueva, is a major work of this period. Kinetic art flourished and works by Vasarely, Calder, Duchamp, Man Ray, Soto, Tinguely were exhibited at the Denise René gallery under the title &quot;Le Mouvement&quot; (the motion). Vasarely published his &quot;Yellow Manifest&quot;. Building on the research of constructivist and Bauhaus pioneers, he postulated that &quot;visual kinetics&quot; (&quot;plastique cinétique&quot;) relied on the perception of the viewer who is considered the sole creator, playing with optical illusions.

* &quot;1955–1965&quot;: &quot;Folklore planétaire, permutations, and serial art&quot;: On 2 March 1959, Vasarely patented his method of &quot;unités plastiques&quot;. Permutations of geometric forms are cut out of a coloured square and rearranged. He worked with a strictly defined palette of colours and forms (three reds, three greens, three blues, two violets, two yellows, black, white, gray; three circles, two squares, two rhomboids, two long rectangles, one triangle, two dissected circles, six ellipses) which he later enlarged and numbered. Out of this &quot;plastic alphabet&quot;, he started serial art, an endless permutation of forms and colours worked out by his assistants. (The creative process is produced by standardized tools and impersonal actors which questions the uniqueness of a work of art.) In 1963, Vasarely presented his palette to the public under the name of &quot;Folklore planetaire&quot;.
* &quot;1965–&quot;: &quot;Hommage à l&#x27;hexagone, Vega&quot;: The &quot;Tribute to the hexagon&quot; series consists of endless transformations of indentations and relief adding color variations, creating a &quot;perpetual mobile of optical illusion&quot;. In 1965 Vasarely was included in the Museum of Modern Art exhibition &quot;The Responsive Eye&quot;, created under the direction of William C. Seitz. His &quot;Vega&quot; series plays with spherical swelling grids creating an optical illusion of volume.


In October 1967, designer Will Burtin invited Vasarely to make a presentation to Burtin&#x27;s Vision &#x27;67 conference, held at New York University. On 5 June 1970, Vasarely opened his first dedicated museum with over 500 works in a renaissance palace in Gordes (closed in 1996). A second major undertaking was the &quot;Foundation Vasarely&quot; in Aix-en-Provence, a museum housed in a distinct structure specially designed by Vasarely. It was inaugurated in 1976 by French president Georges Pompidou, two years after his death. The museum is now in a state of disrepair, several of the pieces on display have been damaged by water leaking from the ceiling. Also, in 1976 his large kinematic object &quot;Georges Pompidou&quot; was installed in the Centre Pompidou in Paris and the Vasarely Museum located at his birthplace in Pécs, Hungary, was established with a large donation of works by Vasarely. In the same decade, he took a stab at industrial design with a 500-piece run of the upscale &quot;Suomi&quot; tableware by Timo Sarpaneva that Vasarely decorated for the German Rosenthal porcelain maker&#x27;s &quot;Studio Linie&quot;. In 1982, 154 specially created serigraphs were taken into space by the cosmonaut Jean-Loup Chrétien on board the French-Soviet spacecraft Salyut 7 and later sold for the benefit of UNESCO. In 1987, the second Hungarian Vasarely museum was established in Zichy Palace in Budapest with more than 400 works.

He died age 90 in Paris on 15 March 1997.

== Legacy ==
A new Vasarely exhibit was mounted in Paris at Musée en Herbe in 2012.
The original UK cover for David Bowie&#x27;s second album &#x27;David Bowie&#x27; (1969) features Vasarely&#x27;s work in the background.
In 2019, a temporary exhibition of Vasarely&#x27;s work titled &quot;Le Partage des Formes&quot; was displayed in the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris.

Inaugurated in July 2024, a permanent exhibition of Vasarely&#x27;s work in the Arkas Collection is being displayed in the Arkas Art Center in Alaçatı.

<text>Neustar, Inc. is an American technology company that provides real-time information and analytics for risk, digital performance, defense, telecommunications, entertainment, and marketing industries, and also provides clearinghouse and directory services to the global communications and Internet industries. Neustar was the domain name registry for a number of top-level domains, including .biz, .us (on behalf of United States Department of Commerce), .co, .nyc (on behalf of the city of New York), and .in (on behalf of the National Internet Exchange of India) until the sale of the division to GoDaddy in 2020.

Until the end of 2018, Neustar was also a North American Numbering Plan Administrator under behalf of the Federal Communications Commission, a role continued from its founder, Lockheed Martin. Their first contract was granted in 1997 and was renewed under its spin-off in 1999, 2004, and 2012. Since 2019, it has been replaced by Somos, Inc.

==History==
Neustar was founded in Delaware in 1998 as a business unit within Lockheed Martin Corporation. It was spun off to keep the neutrality that was essential to its original core contract with the nation&#x27;s telecommunications providers. In November 2006, it bought Followap, Inc., a UK-based enabler of mobile instant messaging services.

In 2010, Lisa Hook was named the firm&#x27;s President and Chief Operating Officer. In January 2010, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that under Hook&#x27;s leadership, Neustar was chosen by a consortium of Hollywood studios and technology executives to manage a system whereby consumers could access movies and other video entertainment from multiple digital devices. This system was named &quot;UltraViolet&quot;. Over the next years, Neustar bought several companies: TARGUSInfo (2011), Aggregate Knowledge (2013) and .CO Internet (2014).

Neustar entered into an asset purchase agreement in 2015 with Transaction Network Services for their caller authentication assets. The following year, Neustar planned to split into two independent publicly traded companies. This plan was abandoned later that year when Golden Gate Capital and GIC announced to buy all Neustar public shares for approximately $2.9 billion ($33.50 per share). This was completed by August 2017.

Neustar lost its Number Portability Administration Center (NPAC) contract in 2016 to Ericsson subsidiary Telcordia. Neustar had administered the number portability system since 1997. The local-number-portability administrator (LNPA) was created to handle NPAC, which enables users to take their phone numbers with them when they switch service providers. The NPAC manages the routing of all calls and texts for more than 650 million US and Canadian phone numbers for more than 2,000 carriers.

Charles Gottdiener was appointed as president and chief executive officer, succeeding Lisa Hook in July 2018. In October, Neustar announced that it bought Verisign&#x27;s security services customer contracts. This includes DDoS protection, DNS firewall, and managed and recursive DNS services customer contracts. Three months later, Neustar bought TRUSTID, a caller authentication and fraud prevention systems provider for contact centers.

GoDaddy bought Neustar&#x27;s domain name registry business in August 2020, which was then renamed GoDaddy Registry. In late 2021, TransUnion purchased Neustar&#x27;s main business for 3.1 billion. However, Neustar&#x27;s security business, Neustar Security Services, was excluded from the transaction and remained as a portfolio company of Golden Gate Capital and GIC, and was rebranded as Vercara in April 2023.

==Business==
From 1998 until 2015, the original business of Neustar was the administration of the North American Numbering Plan, the maintenance of the system of directories and databases that manage the telephone area codes and central office prefixes in North America. This enables the routing of calls among thousands of competing communications service providers (CSPs). Neustar also provided clearinghouse services to emerging CSPs, including Internet service providers (ISPs), mobile network operators, cable television operators, and &quot;voice over Internet protocol&quot; (VoIP) service providers.

Neustar offers internal and external managed Domain name system (DNS) services that play a role in directing and managing traffic in the Internet, cloud-based DDoS attack protection and website performance management tools. Before being purchased by Godaddy, Neustar managed the authoritative directories for the .us and .biz Internet domains, and acted as the worldwide &quot;registry gateway&quot; for China&#x27;s .cn and Taiwan&#x27;s .tw Internet domains outside of these two countries. Neustar also provided back end registry services for .co Top Level Domain.

Neustar previously operated the authoritative directory for U.S. Common Short Codes, part of the short messaging service (SMS) relied upon by the U.S. wireless industry, and provides solutions used by mobile network operators to enable mobile instant messaging for their end users. CTIA granted that contract to Iconectiv, who took over providing Common Short Code (CSC) Registry Services on January 1, 2016.

Neustar offered a &quot;Digital Rights Locker&quot; for Hollywood studios, consumer electronics manufacturers and retailers looking for Digital restrictions management, such as UltraViolet and the planned Mobile DTV Trust Authority (MDTV) Open Mobile Video Coalition (OMVC). UltraViolet was shut down on July 31, 2019.

<text>Winkworth Arboretum is a National Trust-owned arboretum in the civil parish of Busbridge between Godalming and Hascombe, south-west Surrey, England.

The arboretum was founded by Dr Wilfrid Fox, starting in 1938 and continuing through World War II. He cleared the land and planted it with carefully chosen trees and shrubs to maximise its autumnal appearance. Once it was established, he presented it to the National Trust in 1952.

Winkworth Arboretum exhibits over 1000 species of trees as well as large collections of azalea, rhododendron, and holly on slopes leading down to landscaped garden lakes. Gertrude Jekyll explored the woods in the early 20th century.

<doc id="311113" wikidata="Q29140" url="?curid=311113" title="Livonian Order">
<text>The Livonian Order was an autonomous branch of the Teutonic Order,
formed in 1237. From 1435 to 1561 it was a member of the Livonian Confederation.
==History==
The order was formed from the remnants of the Livonian Brothers of the Sword after their defeat by Samogitians in 1236 at the Battle of Schaulen (Saule). They were incorporated into the Teutonic Knights and became known as the Livonian Order in 1237. In the summer of that year, the Master of Prussia Hermann Balk rode into Riga to install his men as castle commanders and administrators of Livonia.

In 1238, the Teutonic Knights of Livonia signed the Treaty of Stensby with the Kingdom of Denmark. Under this agreement, Denmark would support the expansion ambitions of the order in exchange for northern maritime Estonia.

In 1242, the Livonian Order tried to take the city of Novgorod. However, they were defeated by Alexander Nevsky in the Battle on the Ice.

Fortresses as Paide in land ceded by Denmark in the Treaty of Stensby allowed the order to contain the threat of Russian troops. For that reason, the order focused on its southern borders and Semigallia.

Semigallia was a strategic territory for the Livonian Order. Lithuanians passed through Semigallia to raid settlements in Livonia, and they took advantage of the winter ice pack in the Gulf of Riga to reach Oesel Island. Also, this territory kept the Livonian Branch of the Teutonic Order separated from the Prussian Branch.

Between 1237 and 1290, the Livonian Order conquered all of Courland, Livonia, and Semigallia. In 1298, Lithuanians took Karkus Castle north of Riga, and defeated the order in the Battle of Turaida, killing Livonian Land Master Bruno and 22 knights. In 1346, the order bought the Duchy of Estonia from King Valdemar IV of Denmark. Life within the order&#x27;s territory is described in the &quot;Chronicle of Balthasar Russow&quot; (&quot;Chronica der Provinz Lyfflandt&quot;).

The Teutonic Order fell into decline following its defeat in the Battle of Grunwald in 1410 and the secularization of its Prussian territories by Albert of Brandenburg in 1525, while the Livonian Order managed to maintain an independent existence.

The Livonian Order&#x27;s defeat in the Battle of Święta (Wiłkomierz) on September 1, 1435, which claimed the lives of the master and several high-ranking knights, brought the order closer to its neighbors in Livonia. The Livonian Confederation agreement (&quot;eiine fruntliche eyntracht&quot;) was signed in Walk on December 4, 1435, by the Archbishop of Riga, the bishops of Courland, Dorpat, Ösel-Wiek and Reval; the representatives of the Livonian Order and vassals, and the deputies of Riga, Reval and Dorpat city municipal councils.

During the Livonian War, however, the order suffered a decisive defeat by troops of Muscovite Russia in the Battle of Ergeme in 1560. The Livonian Order then sought protection from Sigismund II Augustus, King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, who had intervened in a war between Bishop William of Riga and the Brothers in 1557.

After coming to an agreement with Sigismund II, Augustus and his representatives (especially Mikołaj &quot;the Black&quot; Radziwiłł), the last Livonian Master, Gotthard Kettler, secularized the order and converted to Lutheranism. In the southern part of the Brothers&#x27; lands he created the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia for his family. Most of the remaining lands were seized by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The north of Estonia was taken back by Denmark and Sweden.

From the 14th to the 16th centuries, Middle Low German as spoken in the towns of the Hanseatic League was the established language, but was subsequently succeeded by High German as official language in the course of the 16th and 17th centuries.

==Masters of the Livonian Order==
The Livonian Master, like the grandmaster of the Teutonic Order, was elected by his fellow knights for a life term. The grandmaster exercised supervisory powers and his advice was considered equal to a command. The grandmaster of Teutonic knights did not limit local autonomy, he rarely visited Livonia or sent ambassadors for oversight.

<doc id="311119" wikidata="Q333354" url="?curid=311119" title="Charles Wood, 1st Viscount Halifax">
<text>Charles Wood, 1st Viscount Halifax (20 December 1800 – 8 August 1885), known as Sir Charles Wood, 3rd Baronet, between 1846 and 1866, was a British Whig politician and Member of the British Parliament. He was Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1846 to 1852, First Lord of the Admiralty from 1855 to 1858, and Secretary of State for India from 1859 to 1866.

==Background==
Halifax was the son of Sir Francis Wood, 2nd Baronet of Barnsley, and his wife Anne, daughter of Samuel Buck. He was educated at Eton and Oriel College, Oxford, where he studied classics and mathematics.

==Political career==
A Liberal and Member of Parliament from 1826 to 1866, Wood abandoned the seat of Great Grimsby and was returned in 1831 for the pocket borough of Wareham, probably as a paying guest, which arrangement enabled him to remain in London in preparation for the reading of the Reform Bill. He confided his views to his father: the reform is an efficient, substantial, anti-democratic, pro-property measure, but it sweeps away rotten boroughs and of course disgusts their proprietors. The main hope therefore of carrying it, is by the voice of the country, thus operating by deciding all wavering votes ... The radicals, for which heaven be praised, support us ...He voted meticulously for the bill at every stage, and it received the Royal assent in the following year.

Wood served as Chancellor of the Exchequer in Lord John Russell&#x27;s government (1846–1852), where he opposed any further help for Ireland during the Great Famine there. In his 1851 budget, Sir Charles liberalized trade, reducing import duties and encouraging consumer goods. This reduction in tariffs led to a noticeable increase in consumption. In the succeeding Tory government, the new Chancellor Benjamin Disraeli, a former protectionist, referred to Wood&#x27;s influence on economic policy in an interim financial statement on 30 April 1852, setting a trend for the way budgets are presented in the Commons. For Wood, Disraeli was &#x27;petulant and sarcastic&#x27;, qualities he disliked.

Wood later served as President of the Board of Control under Lord Aberdeen (1852–1855), as First Lord of the Admiralty in Lord Palmerston&#x27;s first administration (1855–1858), and as Secretary of State for India in Palmerston&#x27;s second government (1859–1866). He succeeded to his father&#x27;s baronetcy in 1846, and in 1866 he was elevated to the peerage as Viscount Halifax, of Monk Bretton in the West Riding of the County of York. After the unexpected death of Lord Clarendon necessitated a reshuffle of Gladstone&#x27;s first cabinet, Halifax was brought in as Lord Privy Seal, serving from 1870 to 1874, his last public office.

==Role in the Irish Famine==
The Great Famine in Ireland (1845 to 1851) led to the death of 1 million, and over 1 million emigrating from the country to the United States or to the British dominions of Canada, Australia and New Zealand. On 30 June 1846, Peel&#x27;s Tories were replaced by a Whig government led by Lord John Russell. The government sought to embed free trade and laissez-faire economics. Sir Charles Trevelyan, a senior civil servant at the Treasury, in close cooperation with Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir Charles Wood, sought to oppose intervention in Ireland. Extreme parsimony of the British Government towards Ireland while Wood was in charge of the Treasury greatly enhanced the suffering of those affected by famine. Wood believed in the economic policy of &quot;Laissez-faire&quot; and preferred to leave the Irish to starve rather than &quot;undermine the market&quot; by allowing in cheap imported grain. Wood also shared Trevelyan&#x27;s anti-Irish, moralistic views, with Wood believing the famine should eliminate the &quot;present habits of dependence&quot;, and obliging Irish property to support Irish poverty. Wood wrote to the lord lieutenant that the famine was not accidental, but willed, and would bring along a social revolution: &quot;A want of food and employment is a calamity sent by Providence&quot;, it had &quot;precipitated things with a wonderful impetus, so as to bring them to an early head&quot;. He hoped the famine would clear small farmers, and lead to a &quot;better&quot; economic system.

==Wood&#x27;s despatch==

As the President of the Board of Control, Wood took a major step in spreading education in India in 1854, when he sent a to Lord Dalhousie, the Governor-General of India. Wood recommended the following:

# An education department should be set in every province.
# Universities on the model of the University of London should be established in large cities such as Bombay, Calcutta and Madras.
# At least one government school be opened in every district.
# Affiliated private schools should be given grant in aid.
# The Indian natives should be given training in the vernacular.

In accordance with Wood&#x27;s despatch, education departments were established in every province and universities were opened at Calcutta, Bombay and Madras in 1857, as well as in Punjab in 1882 and in Allahabad in 1887 .

== Family ==
Lord Halifax married Lady Mary Grey (3 May 1807 – 6 July 1884), fifth daughter of Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey, on 29 July 1829. They had four sons and three daughters:

* Hon. Blanche Edith Wood (d. 21 July 1921) married on 21 September 1876, Col Hon Henry William Lowry-Corry (30 June 1845 – 6 May 1927).
* Hon. Alice Louisa Wood (d. 3 June 1934)
* Charles Lindley Wood, 2nd Viscount Halifax (7 January 1839 – 19 January 1934)
* Hon. Emily Charlotte Wood (1840 – 21 December 1904) married Hugo Francis Meynell-Ingram (1822 – 26 May 1871) 
* Capt. Hon. Francis Lindley Wood, RN (17 October 1841 – 14 October 1873)
* Lt Col. Hon. Henry John Lindley Wood (12 January 1843 – 5 January 1903)

Lady Halifax died in 1884. Lord Halifax survived her by just over a year and died in August 1885, aged 84. He was succeeded in his titles by his eldest son Charles, who was the father of Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax.

<text>Attercliffe is an industrial suburb of northeast Sheffield, England on the south bank of the River Don. The suburb falls in the Darnall ward of Sheffield City Council.

==History==

The name Attercliffe can be traced back as far as an entry in the Domesday Book of 1086 - Ateclive – meaning “at the cliff”, a small escarpment that lay alongside the River Don. This cliff can be seen in images from the 19th century, but is no longer visible.

Westforth or Washford Bridge, at the Sheffield end of the village, was first recorded in a will of 1535. It was rebuilt in wood in 1608 and 1647, then in stone in 1672, 1789 and 1794.

Historically a part of the parish of Sheffield, Attercliffe Chapel was built in 1629 as the first place of worship in the settlement. The Town School was built in 1779, and Christ Church was built in 1826 but destroyed during the Second World War.

In 1686, Richard Frankland set up a dissenting academy at Attercliffe Hall. Three years later, it was taken over by the nonconformist minister Timothy Jollie, who educated students including John Bowes, Nicholas Saunderson and Thomas Secker. Secker, later Archbishop of Canterbury, was frustrated by Jollie&#x27;s poor teaching, famously remarking that he lost his knowledge of languages and that &#x27;only the old Philosophy of the Schools was taught there: and that neither ably nor diligently. The morals also of many of the young Men were bad. I spent my time there idly &amp; ill&#x27;.

In the early 19th century, Attercliffe remained a rural community known for its orchards, windmill, and large houses including the Old Hall, New Hall and Carlton House. New Hall was later converted into pleasure gardens, with a cricket ground, racecourse, bowling green, maze, lake and depictions of famous cities. It was known for its concerts and firework displays.

Small-scale manufacture of pen knives and pocket knives developed in the early 19th century, The suburb became more accessible with the construction of first a turnpike road from Sheffield to the terminus of the River Don Navigation at Tinsley, then the opening of the Sheffield Canal, running to the south of the village. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, there was a frequent proposal to widen this to form a Sheffield Ship Canal, to terminate in a basin at Attercliffe.

Attercliffe railway station opened in August 1871 and closed on 26 September 1927.
Attercliffe has long been an industrial area, but by the early 20th century, there was also a large residential population and high class shops, John Banner&#x27;s department store (Banner&#x27;s), which opened in 1934, in particular. The area declined after the Second World War as Victorian housing was cleared and not replaced, causing schools to close, followed by most of Attercliffe&#x27;s shops. Banner&#x27;s closed in 1980 and was converted into offices. Some of the local industries closed or moved to larger sites further out of Sheffield.

=== Adelphi Cinema ===

The Adelphi was an art deco cinema on Vicarage Road, built in 1920 by architect William C. Fenton. It is Grade II listed. The cinema closed in 1967, and the building was then used as a bingo hall under the name &quot;Adelphi Bingo Club&quot; and a nightclub. It is currently disused. In November 2022 Sheffield Council announced plans to redevelop the building for community use.

==Attractions==

Its location on the Sheffield Supertram route, the completion of the Five Weirs Walk and construction of the Don Valley Stadium and Sheffield Arena in the 1990s brought some life back to the area. As part of the area&#x27;s regeneration, new house building started in 2002. Don Valley Stadium was demolished in 2013, but other entertainment venues bring visitors to the area, including Hollywood Bowl &amp; Cineworld. This has changed Attercliffe from its previous seedy element to an area for outer city entertainment with the introduction of Valley Centertainment.

It is home to one of the highest concentrations of sporting facilities in the UK with the Olympic Legacy Park, incorporating iceSheffield and the English Institute of Sport.

==Politics==
Attercliffe falls within the Darnall Ward. Sheffield Attercliffe was the name of one of Sheffield&#x27;s parliamentary constituencies from 1885 to 2010, when it was renamed Sheffield South East.

<doc id="311127" wikidata="Q3126045" url="?curid=311127" title="Hallamshire">
<text>Hallamshire (or Hallam) is the historical name for an area of South Yorkshire, England, approximating to the current City of Sheffield local government area. 

The origin of the name is uncertain. The English Place-Name Society describe &quot;Hallam&quot; originating from a formation meaning &quot;on the rocks&quot;. Alternative theories are that it is derived from &quot;halgh&quot; meaning an area of land at a border, Old Norse &quot;hallr&quot; meaning a slope or hill, or Old English &quot;heall&quot; meaning a hall or mansion.

The exact boundaries of this historic district are unknown, but it is thought to have covered the parishes of Sheffield, Ecclesfield, and Bradfield—an area roughly equivalent to those parts of the present-day borough of the City of Sheffield that lie to the west of the rivers Don and Sheaf that are within the boundaries of the ancient county of Yorkshire (later descriptions also include Brightside and the parish of Handsworth).

==History==
===Pre-conquest Hallamshire===

In Anglo-Saxon times, Hallamshire was the most southerly of the &quot;small shires&quot; or &quot;regiones&quot; of the Kingdom of Northumbria. 

The mother church of Hallamshire lay five miles north of Sheffield at Ecclesfield, whose placename includes the Common Brittonic or primitive Welsh root &quot;*eglẽs&quot; meaning &quot;church&quot;, suggesting that Hallamshire has even earlier roots and must have existed as a territorial unit at the time of the area&#x27;s first conversion to Christianity during the Romano-British period.

On the basis of three separate extracts from the Domesday Survey it can be shown that the manors of Hallam, Attercliffe, and Sheffield were three distinct and separate entities at the time of the Survey and beyond. The Domesday Book of 1086 states that the manor of Hallam (&quot;Hallun&quot;) included sixteen hamlets or settlements and had existed before the 1066 Norman Conquest of England as part of the lands owned by Waltheof, the Earl of Huntingdon, who had an &quot;aula&quot; or hall located in the manor of Hallam. From the Domesday text it is clear that the village of Hallam and Waltheof’s aula could only have been located in the manor of Hallam, and not the manors of Sheffield or Attercliffe. However, the possibility that Waltheof&#x27;s &quot;aula&quot; and the surrounding settlement was located in the manor of Sheffield still persists since the manor of Sheffield had once been &quot;demesne or inland&quot; of the manor of Hallam, a term which in this case implies &quot;contained within&quot;. This has led to the suggestion that the &quot;Sheffield&quot; of the Domesday Book somehow encompassed the area that later became known as &quot;Sheffield Park&quot;, the historic town and castle being in Hallam. Indeed, an early 20th-century excavation at the site of Sheffield Castle found evidence of an Anglo-Saxon building on the site. However, alternative sites have been suggested in and around the Rivelin valley.

Local historian T. Walter Hall (in 1931), following Sidney Addy (1893), suggested that the district&#x27;s original settlement was at Hallam Head, above the River Rivelin, and that it had been destroyed during the Harrying of the North. As evidence, he noted that the location lies by the ancient Long Causeway route and that the name of the neighbouring Burnt Stones Common referenced its destruction. A compilation of early maps of the area surrounding Hallam Head assembled by Hallam (2015) from a number of sources provides compelling evidence that a pre-Conquest nucleated settlement, almost assuredly the Domesday village of Hallam, was located immediately south of the old Roman road (Redmires Road) approximately west of Sheffield. The geographic centre coincides with the junction of Tom Lane and Carsick Hill Road; two ancient byways found mentioned in medieval charters from the 13th century. Hallam provides corroborating charter evidence that leads to the identification of the location Hallam Head, the site for the village of Hallam identified by T. Walter Hall in 1931, being situated near the upper end, or head of the village. A series of three communal fields designated Hallam fields (Hallam Field, Great Hallam Field and Common Fields of Hallam) are mentioned frequently in surrenders from 1550 onward in the context of common pasture. The apparent pattern of a nucleated settlement and associated three-field system would be analogous to ‘town planning’ without a town, had the village of Hallam not existed. The arguments presented by T. Walter Hall and Hallam are rejected by David Hey, who notes that there is no evidence of any settlement larger than a hamlet ever having existed at the site, and that evidence suggests that the Harrying of the North did not affect the Sheffield area. The simple fact that the village of Hallam and Waltheof&#x27;s aula had been destroyed and no longer existed, and that the taxable value of the manors in the area had been significantly devalued by the time of the Domesday Survey would contradict Hay&#x27;s position. Addy himself preferred a location just outside the village of Stannington, where there is evidence of a large manor house surrounded by a moat.

===After the Norman Conquest===
Waltheof initially submitted to William I and was allowed to keep his lands. He took part in a failed uprising to support the 1069 invasion by Sweyn II of Denmark and Edgar Ætheling (including an attack on York), but then once again submitted to William and was married to Judith of Lens, the King&#x27;s niece. However, after taking part in a conspiracy against William in 1075 Waltheof was executed.

Initially, Judith retained his lands (including Hallamshire), but after Judith refused a second marriage to the Norman knight Simon Saint Liz, William confiscated much of her lands and handed them to her eldest daughter Maud, who then married Saint Liz in Judith&#x27;s stead. After the death of Saint Liz, Maud married David, the heir to the crown of Scotland, and Waltheof&#x27;s lands and Earldom were passed to him.

It is possible that Hallamshire was exempted from this transfer and remained in Judith&#x27;s hands. The Domesday Book states that the manor of Hallam was held by Roger de Busli &quot;of the Countess Judith&quot;. The exact nature of the arrangement between Judith and de Busli is unknown, however there is evidence that such an arrangement continued for a number of centuries – an inquisition following the death of Thomas de Furnival in 1332 found that his ancestors had held the manor of Sheffield &quot;of the King of Scotland&quot;, paying a yearly service of two white greyhounds.

The earliest known use of the term &quot;Hallamshire&quot; – &quot;Halumsire&quot; – is found in a deed of the house of Saint Wandrille in Ecclesfield dating from 1161. Historically, the term &quot;shire&quot; would simply mean the district appropriated to some city, town, or castle, and did not necessarily refer to a county. Hallamshire could therefore be assumed to be the district associated with a town (&quot;vill&quot;) called &quot;Hallam&quot;, although there is no known record of such a town&#x27;s existence.

During this early period, the name Hallamshire was retained for the Norman lordship. It was administered from Sheffield Castle, at the confluence of the River Don and the River Sheaf. A smaller castle was built at High Bradfield. During the 12th century, William de Lovetot acquired most of the land within the Sheffield area including the old manors of Hallam, Sheffield, and Attercliffe. He constructed a more substantial castle in Sheffield, establishing the town as the dominant settlement within Hallamshire. Sheffield gained a sizeable parish, split from the large parish of Ecclesfield, and a larger manor which encompassed most of Hallamshire. A charter of 1268 describes Hallamshire as containing just three manors: Ecclesfield, Sheffield and Bradfield. However, confusion arose later, as Sheffield acquired other manors outside historic Hallamshire, such as that of Handsworth.

Hallamshire was included in official lists of the counties of England under Henry VIII in the 16th century.

The territorial division of Hallamshire survived into the 19th century as a liberty, recorded in 1822 as including the parishes of Sheffield, Treeton, Whiston, Rotherham, Handsworth, and Ecclesfield, and with the Duke of Norfolk as Chief Bailiff.

===Modern Hallam===
Hallam has come to mean, broadly speaking, that area of Yorkshire in the foothills of the Peak District and southwest of the River Don. The region includes much of western Sheffield, and the parish of Bradfield. Suburbs and villages within this area include Bradfield, Broomhill, Crookes, Fulwood, Hillsborough, Loxley, Stannington, Strines, and Walkley.

A number of institutions, companies, and public houses use the &quot;Hallam/shire&quot; name to reflect their association with the Sheffield area :
*The Company of Cutlers in Hallamshire is a trade guild of steelworkers, founded in 1624 and based in Sheffield.
*Sheffield Hallam is a Parliamentary constituency in western Sheffield, demographically one of the wealthiest such constituencies in Britain.

==Connection to the Robin Hood legend==
The small village of Loxley, now a suburb of western Sheffield, lies within Hallamshire. A 1637 survey by John Harrison of the estates in or near Sheffield belonging to the Earl of Arundel states that a place called little Haggas croft in Loxley Firth contained &quot;&quot;. Antiquarian Joseph Hunter—writing in 1819—reaffirmed this local tradition, stating that Loxley Chase has &quot;the fairest pretensions to be the Locksley of our old ballads, where was born that redoubtable hero Robin Hood.&quot;

<text>Florianópolis () is the capital and second largest city of the state of Santa Catarina, in the South region of Brazil. The city encompasses Santa Catarina Island and surrounding small islands, as well as part of the mainland. It has a population of 537,211, according to the 2022 Brazilian census, the second-most populous city in the state (after Joinville), and the 39th in Brazil. The metropolitan area has an estimated population of 1,111,702, the 21st largest in the country. The city is known for having the country&#x27;s third highest Human Development Index score among all Brazilian cities (0.847).

The economy of Florianópolis is heavily based on information technology, tourism, and services. The city has 60 beaches and is a center of surfing activity. Lagoa da Conceição is the most famous area for tourism, recreation, nature, and extreme sports. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that &quot;Florianopolis is the Party Destination of the Year in 2009.&quot; &quot;Newsweek&quot; placed Florianópolis in its &quot;ten Most Dynamic cities of the World&quot; list in 2006. &quot;Veja&quot;, a Brazilian publication, named the city as &quot;the Best Place to live in Brazil.&quot; As a result of this exposure, Florianópolis is growing as a second home destination for many Paulistas, Argentines, Uruguayans, U.S. citizens, and Europeans.

Florianópolis is also commonly known by the nicknames &quot;Floripa&quot; and &quot;Ilha da Magia&quot; (Magic Island). Most of the population lives on the mainland and on the island&#x27;s central and northern parts. The southern half is less inhabited. Many small commercial fishermen populate the island.

The Hercílio Luz International Airport serves the city. Florianópolis is home to the Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (Federal University of Santa Catarina). There are also the Santa Catarina Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology (Instituto Federal de Santa Catarina), and two campuses of the Universidade do Estado de Santa Catarina (State University of Santa Catarina), among other institutions of higher and professional education.

The city has been ranked as the safest capital to live in Brazil in 2024, according to the 2024 Security Atlas, released by the Institute for Applied Economic Research (IPEA) and the Brazilian Public Security Forum (FBSP). Among other rankings, it has been placed as well as the 5th best place to retire, in BR and USA by the Mongeral Aegon Longevity Institute in partnership with FGV. 

== Etymology ==
The name Florianópolis is a tribute to Marshal Floriano Peixoto, the second President (1891–1894) of the Republic of the United States of Brazil and from Greek term &quot;polis&quot;, meaning &quot;city&quot;. Until 1893, the city was called Nossa Senhora do Desterro ( or ; ) or simply Desterro.

==Geography==
===Vegetation===
Florianópolis lies within the Atlantic Forest which has an extremely diverse and unique mix of vegetation and forest types. The main ecoregion is the coastal Atlantic forest, the narrow strip of about along the coast which covers about 20 percent of the region. This forest extends as far as inland and its range is as high as 2,000 meters above sea level. Altitude determines at least three vegetation types in the Atlantic Forest: the lowland forest of the coastal plain, montane forests, and the high-altitude grassland or &quot;campo rupestre.&quot;
The municipality contains part of the offshore Marinha do Arvoredo Biological Reserve, a fully protected conservation unit established in 1990.
It also contains part of the Serra do Tabuleiro State Park, a mountainous area covered in lush forests.
The park protects the sources of the Vargem do Braço, Cubatão and Una rivers, which supply most of the drinking water for greater Florianópolis and the south coast region.
The municipality contains the Rio Vermelho State Park in the northeast of Santa Catarina Island, created in 2007.

===Precipitation===
There is significant precipitation which is well distributed throughout the year. The annual normal precipitation for the period of 1961 through 1990 was . There is no dry season, and summer generally is the rainiest season. Increased rainfall occurs from January to March, with a median of per month, and from April to December there is somewhat less precipitation, averaging per month. The driest months are from June to August.

===Climate===
Florianópolis experiences a warm humid subtropical climate (Koppen: Cfa), falling just short of a true tropical climate. The seasons of the year are distinct, with a well-defined summer and winter, and characteristic weather for autumn and spring. Due to the proximity of the sea, the relative humidity of the atmosphere is 80% on average.

The area is threatened by climate change, with rising sea levels expected to lead to increased coastal erosion. Mangroves are being planted in and around the city to help mitigate potential damage while restoring local ecosystems.

The maximum temperatures of the hottest month varies from and the minimum temperatures are from . The lowest temperature ever recorded was in July 2000 while the highest temperature ever recorded was in February 1973.

===Neighbourhoods===

==History==

Carijós Indians, a Tupi people, were the first inhabitants of the Florianópolis area. The traces of its presence are verified through archaeological sites and sambaquis dating up to 4000 years ago. The Indians called the place Meiembipe or &quot;mountain along the channel&quot;.

Around 1514 the Portuguese landed and gave the area the name Ilha dos Patos, but in 1526 it was renamed Ilha de Santa Catarina (Saint Catherine&#x27;s Island). The area supplied the vessels that went to the River Plate (Río de la Plata) Basin.

The official settlement of the island began in 1673 with the arrival of bandeirante Francisco Dias Velho&#x27;s agricultural company and it continued in 1678 with the construction of a chapel consecrated to Nossa Senhora do Desterro. At this time a villa began to take form, slowly becoming a colonial settlement.

To guarantee its domain the Portuguese Crown elevated Santa Catarina Island to the category of village in 1714 with the name of Nossa Senhora do Desterro and already in 1726 they promoted it again, now to the category of town.

From this date on Vila do Desterro and mainly the port began to have a strategic function because it was situated halfway between Rio de Janeiro and Buenos Aires, possibly two of the largest seaside cities of South America at that time. For this reason in 1739 the Capitania da Ilha de Santa Catarina was created and Desterro became its capital. Soon the most expressive seaside defensive ring of Southern Brazil started to be built: Santa Cruz, São José da Ponta Grossa, Santo Antonio and Nossa Senhora da Conceição da Barra do Sul fortresses.

With the coming of the Captaincy the population began to grow, but the great population growth happened between 1747 and 1756 with the arrival of about 6,000 settlers coming from the Archipelago of Azores and from Madeira Island. The development of the agriculture, the cotton and linen industry and the commerce followed the Azorean occupation.
In 1823, during the monarchy which ended in 1889, Desterro became the Capital of Santa Catarina Province opening a period of prosperity with many urban works and also intense political organization.

Regional elites not happy with the government centralization staged the Federalist Revolt at the beginning of the Brazilian Republic. The movement that started in Rio Grande do Sul spread to Santa Catarina and turned Desterro into the Federalist Capital of the Republic. The then president of Brazil, marshal Floriano Peixoto, known as the Iron Marshal, suppressed the rebellion and ordered the shooting of many people who were considered enemies of the state, in the Anhatomirim Island Fortress. Possibly to show loyalty to the marshal, 1893 saw the change of the state capital&#x27;s name: from Desterro to Florianópolis, that is to say, city of Floriano.

==Demographics==


According to the 2022 census, there were 537,211 people residing in the city. The population density was . The last PNAD (National Research for Sample of Domiciles) census revealed the following numbers: 410,298 White people (76.4%), 87,542 Pardo (Multiracial) people (16.3%), 35,813 Black people (6.7%), 2.398 Asian people (0.4%) and 1,148 Amerindian people (0.2%).
Florianópolis has a population mostly composed of Brazilians of European descent. The numbers of immigrants started to increase in the mid-18th century, mostly with the arrival of Portuguese colonists from the Azores Islands. The population of Florianópolis was composed mainly of Portuguese/Azoreans, Germans, and Italians. Further south, some neighborhoods preserve their rural village identity. The cultural heritage left by their Azorean ancestors is noticeable in their dialect, in handicrafts, and traditional festivities.

The small village of Santo António de Lisboa (Saint Anthony of Lisbon) is an example of colonial period architecture and in Ribeirão da Ilha, the oldest part of the capital, the inhabitants speak in an accent closer to the Azorean dialect of the first settlers. In Ribeirão da Ilha is the church of Our Lady of Lapa do Ribeirão, built in 1806. Lagoa da Conceição, with its many sand dunes, restaurants and seaside night life and where women make lace to sell in the street, has also managed to retain many traces of its colonial architecture.

The city is densely populated, with a population distribution of 623.68 inhab./km2, the 6th highest in the state of Santa Catarina. The vast majority of Florianopólis residents live in the urban area of the municipality, corresponding to 96.2% of its inhabitants, while 3.78% live in the rural area of Florianópolis.

On the other side, the city has taken on a cosmopolitan air with the arrival of Brazilians from other states and foreigners who chose to live there. The island, which at the beginning of the colonization period, was an important whale hunting centre, is today a technological pole of the IT industry. A State Capital of interest to tourism, Florianópolis population in 2020 was estimated to be around 508,826 people in the city proper and 1,111,702 people in the metropolitan area.

==Economy==

According to 2002 Sefaz statistics, agricultural activities represented 0.05%, manufacturing represented 3.41% and the commerce and service sector 96.54%.

Tourism is one of the staples of Florianópolis&#x27;s economy, and relates to not only Floripa&#x27;s Azorean culture but also the fact that it is situated on the coastline. Its environmental restrictions on building and commercial development have been more or less strictly enforced, helping it to keep its original character.

The city has invested heavily in infrastructure, from roads to schools, and Florianópolis ranks high on development measures such as literacy (97 percent) and electrification (near 100 percent). By the late 1990s, private companies were flocking to the island, or emerging from a technology &quot;&quot; at the federal university. (Among the innovations it hatched: the computerized voting machines that have reduced fraud and increased efficiency in Brazilian elections.) Local officials now say their aim is to be the Silicon Valley of Brazil, with beaches.

In addition to its white sand beaches, Florianópolis offers many historical attractions, including the sites of the original Azorean colonists, the Lagoa da Conceição lagoon, and Santo Antônio de Lisboa. Tourism in Florianópolis has grown significantly over the past 10 years, with increasing numbers of visitors coming from other large cities in Brazil (particularly Porto Alegre, Curitiba, São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro) as well as other South American countries (particularly Argentina, with direct flights offered daily from Buenos Aires).

During the past decade technology and software development firms also experienced strong growth, and today Information Technology services are one of the top revenue generators in Florianópolis. Several technology centers are spread around Florianópolis, making the city an important pole in this economic sector.

The GDP for the city was R$323,264,000,000 (2019).

The per capita income for the city was R$45,602 (2021).

It was from there that whale harpooners and crewmen confessed and attended the mass before going fishing. Next, the priest would go down to the beach to bless the boats that would sail out to sea. Today, the boats leave there for Ilha do Campeche, one of the most visited islands around Florianópolis. It is also in Armação that one finds one of the most important archaeological sites of the State of Santa Catarina.

Hallam constituency extends from Stannington and Loxley in the north to Dore in the south and includes small parts of the city centre in the east. It includes the wards of Crookes, Dore and Totley, Ecclesall, Fulwood and Stannington.

The majority of Hallam is rural, spreading in the west into the Peak District National Park. It also contains some of the least deprived wards in the country, has low unemployment (1.5% jobseekers claimants in November 2012), and a high rate of owner occupancy, with few occupants who rent their home. Since the 2010 boundary changes, neither of Sheffield&#x27;s universities have a campus in the constituency, but it still includes areas where many students live.

On income-based 2004 statistics, this is the most affluent constituency one place below the top ten seats of the 650, which were spread across the South East of England (including London), with almost 12% of residents earning over £60,000 a year. This measure placed Sheffield Hallam above Windsor and Twickenham.

Based on 2011–12 income and tax statistics from HMRC, Sheffield Hallam has the 70th highest median income of the 650 parliamentary constituencies, with those above it almost exclusively in London and the South East, and placing it above Tunbridge Wells (76th), The Cotswolds (92nd), Cambridge (97th), Hemel Hempstead (103rd), and David Cameron&#x27;s former Witney constituency (121st).

The 2001 Census showed Hallam to have the highest number of people classified as professionals of any of the UK constituencies. Furthermore, 60% of working-age residents hold a degree, the 7th highest and exceeding Cambridge.

== History ==
Prior to its creation Hallam was a part of the larger Sheffield Borough constituency, which was represented by two Members of Parliament (MPs). In 1885 the Redistribution of Seats Act, which sought to eliminate constituencies with more than one MP and for the first time allow approximately equal representation of the people, led to the break-up of the constituency into five divisions: each represented by a single MP, as today. Hallam was one of these new divisions. Its first MP, the Conservative Charles Stuart-Wortley, had previously been an MP in the Sheffield constituency, elected for the first time in 1880.

Hallam was regarded in 2004 as the wealthiest constituency in the north of England and was held by the Conservative Party for all but two years from 1885 to 1997. At the 1997 general election, Richard Allan of the Liberal Democrats took the seat with an 18.5% swing, becoming only the second non-Tory ever to win it. He handed the seat to fellow Lib Dem and future UK Deputy Prime Minister, Nick Clegg in 2005; who held it until his defeat by Labour&#x27;s Jared O&#x27;Mara at the 2017 snap general election. That year saw the constituency record its highest turnout in 66 years, with 77.8% of the electorate going to the polls.

Sheffield Hallam is the only constituency in South Yorkshire that has not been a Labour stronghold, returning a Labour MP for the first time in 2017. In 2004 it had been regarded as the wealthiest constituency in the north of England and, apart from a brief period between 1916 and 1918, when it was taken by the Liberals, it was a safe Conservative seat from 1885 until 1997. This long period of Conservative dominance included the period under Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s premiership, starkly contrasting with most seats in the county and the neighbouring county of Derbyshire; the constituency was the only Conservative seat in South Yorkshire in the three elections before the 1997. 

At the 1997 general election, Richard Allan of the Liberal Democrats took the seat with an 18.5% swing, becoming only the second non-Tory ever to win it. He handed the seat to Nick Clegg in 2005, who was leader of the Liberal Democrats from 2007 to 2015 and Deputy Prime Minister from 2010 to 2015. Clegg held it until his defeat by Labour&#x27;s Jared O&#x27;Mara at the 2017 snap general election. That year saw the constituency record its highest turnout in 66 years, with 77.8% of the electorate going to the polls. This was the first time in the seat&#x27;s history that it had returned a Labour MP.

From 25 October 2017 until 3 July 2018, O&#x27;Mara had the whip withdrawn as a Labour MP and sat as an independent. It was later restored but he quit the Labour Party shortly afterwards. He then sat as an independent MP until leaving parliament. O&#x27;Mara announced he would resign as an MP in September 2019, citing mental health issues, which would have triggered a by-election in the constituency. However, he later postponed his resignation until the 2019 general election.

Olivia Blake won the seat for the Labour Party in the 2019 general election with a small majority of 1.2%. In her maiden speech to Parliament, Blake said that the Sheffield Hallam constituency had a &quot;very long history of social justice&quot;, as mythology points to a Yorkshire origin for Robin Hood in Loxley, thereby lending her support to the idea that Loxley was the birthplace of Robin Hood. 

Blake retained her seat at the 2024 general election with a much increased majority of 15.9%.

== Constituency polls during the 2010–2015 Parliament ==
Due in part to the high profile of the constituency&#x27;s then-MP Nick Clegg, who served as Deputy Prime Minister during the 2010–15 Parliament, Sheffield Hallam is unusual in having had seven constituency-specific opinion polls conducted between 2010 and 2015. Each of these polls suggested significant changes in the vote share compared to 2010 general election. The first poll, in October 2010, suggested a drop in the Lib Dem lead in the seat to just 2%, from nearly 30% at the general election five months earlier. Five of the six remaining polls, which appeared between May 2014 and May 2015, suggested that Labour was in the lead in the seat by this time, with the Labour lead fluctuating to between 1% and 10%, and one put the Lib Dems in the lead. On average across all seven opinion polls, Labour had a lead over the Lib Dems of 2.5%. The Conservatives came second in one poll, and third in the other six polls. The May 2015 ICM poll scores displayed are those of the constituency voting intention question. The same poll also carried the standard voting intention question, which showed a Labour lead.

In 2010, Sheffield Hallam was one of a number of constituencies that experienced problems on polling day leading to some people being unable to cast their vote. In this case, voters at the Ranmoor polling station were subjected to long queues and some voters were turned away when polls closed at 10 pm, with Liberal Democrat candidate Nick Clegg apologising to those voters affected. Acting Returning Officer John Mothersole said that staff had been &quot;caught out&quot; by a high turnout, and the Electoral Commission instigated a review of procedures in Hallam and other constituencies where similar problems had occurred.

<text>ISO/IEC 13490 (also known as [[Ecma International|ECMA]]-168) is the successor to ISO 9660 (level 3), intended to describe the file system of a CD-ROM or CD-R.

ISO 13490 has several improvements over its predecessor. It fully addresses the filename, POSIX attribute, and multibyte character issues that were not handled by ISO 9660. It is also a more efficient format, permits incremental recording, and permits both the ISO 9660 format and ISO/IEC 13490 format to co-exist on the same media. It also specifies how to use multisession properly.

It is derived from the Frankfurt Group (formed in 1990 by many CD-ROM and CD-WO hardware and media manufacturers, CD-ROM data publishers, users of CD-ROMs, and major computer companies) proposal and fully supports orange book media.

==Multiple session overview==
ISO 13490 define a rule for operating systems as to how to read a multiple-session ISO 9660 volume from a CD-R. Instead of looking for the volume descriptor at offset 32,768 (sector number 16 on a CD) from the start of the disc (which would be the default behavior in ISO 9660), programs accessing the disc should start reading from the 16th sector in the first track of the &quot;latest&quot; session. Sector numbers form a contiguous sequence starting at the first session, and continue over added sessions and their gaps.

Hence, if a CD mastering program wants to add a single file to a CD-R that has an ISO 9660 volume, it has to append a session containing at least an updated copy of the entire directory tree, plus the new file. The duplicated directory entries can still reference the data files in the previous session(s).

In a similar way, file data can be updated or even removed. Removal is, however, only virtual: the removed content does not appear any more in the directory shown to the user, but it is still physically present on the disc. It can therefore be recovered, and it takes up space (such that the CD will become full even though appearing to still have unused space).

===Support===
Though it was originally intended for multisession support only to apply to Mode 2 Form 1 formatted discs, some CD writing software supported multisession writing to Mode 1 format discs. Since only some of the early disc drives supported multisession Mode 1 discs, in many cases the second and following sessions would become unreachable in some drives.

Some older CD writing software, such as Nero Burning ROM, would not import previous session data from an inserted disc. It could thus only write a subsequent session to a disc on the same computer that had written all the previous sessions, and then only if the previous session data was saved before the writing software was closed down.

<text>Meadowhall is an indoor shopping centre in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England. It lies north-east of Sheffield city centre, and from Rotherham town centre. It is the largest shopping centre in Yorkshire, and currently the twelfth-largest in the United Kingdom. As of 2021, plans for an extension are currently under consideration, for completion in the 2020s, which would make Meadowhall the 11th largest shopping centre in the United Kingdom.

Architecturally, the original construction of Meadowhall in the early 1990s was inspired by the Place d&#x27;Orléans shopping centre in Ottawa, Canada. The Meadowhall Retail Park is a separate development, owned by British Land, lying almost to the south of Meadowhall shopping centre in the Carbrook area of the city.

==History==
The shopping centre was built by Bovis on the site previously occupied by Hadfields&#x27; East Hecla steelworks.

The centre was opened on 4 September 1990. With a floor area of , it is the twelfth-largest (second-largest when first opened) shopping centre in the UK. It is similar in concept to the Merry Hill Shopping Centre at Brierley Hill in the West Midlands, which was completed just before Meadowhall.

With over 280 stores, Meadowhall has been widely blamed for the closure of shops in both Sheffield City Centre, and Rotherham town centre. Meadowhall is wholly owned by Norges Bank Investment Management and is managed by British Land. The centre attracted 19.8 million visitors in its first year of opening, and now attracts about 30 million visitors a year.

One of Meadowhall&#x27;s largest stores of the past, Sainsbury&#x27;s on Market Street (originally branded SavaCentre in the 1990s) closed in July 2005 and was replaced by new Next and Primark stores in the summer of 2007. Sainsbury&#x27;s store relocated to Crystal Peaks. There was a Namco Station arcade in The Oasis food court which closed in September 2007 after more than 15 years at the shopping centre. December 2005 saw Meadowhall become home to the fifth Apple Store in the UK, and in late 2007 it gained the third Puma Store in the UK, after London and Glasgow. The centre was also home to the only McCafé in Yorkshire, which has been replaced with a franchise called ‘Love Koffee’. The centre&#x27;s Burger King which was located on Market Street got replaced by a small franchise called ‘Burger Knight’ in October 2007 when it reopened after the 2007 floods. The small franchise, along with Greggs, Massarella&#x27;s Coffee, Crawshaws Butchers and Pollard&#x27;s Tea and Coffee were forcibly shut in May 2008, only had just recently spent thousands of pounds on refurbishment after the 2007 floods – these stores were closed down so Meadowhall could create larger stores which are now occupied by Yankee Candle, TUI, Hays Travel, Quiz and Yours Clothing.

In October 2012, Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM) announced that the Norwegian Government Pension Fund Global had bought 50 per cent of the UK shopping centre Meadowhall for £348 million, or approximately 3.2 billion Norwegian kroner.

In 2014, the mall ‘Park Lane’ was refurbished in the style of a &quot;boutique arcade&quot;. In 2017, Park Lane was modernised during the 2015–2017 £60 million refurbishment, and is now seen as the most upmarket area of Meadowhall, with stores such as Pretty Green, Flannels, Hugo Boss, White Stuff and Yo! Sushi.

An agreement between Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM) and British Land was signed on 18 May 2024 for NBIM to acquire the remaining 50% stake of the Meadowhall estate from British Land, completing on 12 July 2024. The cost of the acquisition was £360 million, valuing the property at £720 million, with NBIM taking on the £426 million of debt that the property was encumbered with at the time of the agreement.

British Land stated that proceeds from the sale are expected to be £156 million after net debt of £200 million. As part of the agreement British Land would remain as the asset manager of the site.

===2015–2017 refurbishment===
Meadowhall celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2015, and announced in the same year a £60 million interior refurbishment to make it fit with newer centres opened since 1990. The refurbishment allowed some retailers to install double-height shop fronts. The first phase was completed in April 2017 and the second phase was completed in November 2017 with most of the work being done when after hours so as not to disrupt shopping, each area of Meadowhall has been themed to fit a certain style. After the closure of the BHS branch in August 2016, it was announced that Primark would be expanding its store into half of the vacant store, with Sports Direct taking up the other half, and that Wilko would be moving into the store already taken up by Sports Direct; this was completed in March 2018. The House of Fraser store has also been refurbished along with the centre, as well as Apple, AllSaints, Yo! Sushi, Hollister, Schuh, JD Sports and the opening of new stores such as Tag Heuer, Flannels, Joe Browns, Skinny Dip and River Island Children making the centre being perceived as more &quot;upmarket&quot;. Restaurants such as Handmade Burger Co and Pizza Express in the Oasis Dining quarter have also been refurbished with a new Gourmet Burger Kitchen, however this has since closed.

Scenes from the music video of the Sheffield-based duo Moloko&#x27;s first single &quot;Fun For Me&quot; were shot in the Oasis area of the shopping centre.

==Extension==
== Flooding incidents ==
Meadowhall was inundated by the River Don during the June 2007 floods, with water peaking at . The worst affected areas were between Market Street and The Arcade. Meadowhall reopened six days after a big cleanup operation and trading recommenced on the upper level. The majority of shops on the ground floor were boarded up for weeks on end (some for up to two months) so the interiors could be refitted – the centre fully relaunched in late September 2007. Meadowhall has since installed flood gates, to prevent this from happening in the future.

Meadowhall was also affected by the November 2019 floods on Thursday 7 November, the same night as the annual Christmas Light Switch-on. Although the event was cancelled, many people had already begun to travel for the performances. Once people had arrived public transport was already cancelled, affecting people all over South Yorkshire. With conditions growing worse across the area, many shops and businesses began to close, with a number of people being left stranded in the Meadowhall premises until the following morning. The shopping centre itself was not flooded internally during the November 2019 floods, as improved flood defences and barriers had been installed since the previous events of 2007.

==Sections==
The main Meadowhall structure is divided into multiple areas which each have shops for differing purposes:
*High Street with discount shops, banks and a bureau de change.
*The Arcade contains higher-end shops and is in the middle of the shopping centre.
*Park Lane has boutique and expensive shops and services (rebranded as The Avenue in 2023.)
*The Gallery has 5 (clothes shops) of the centre&#x27;s 9 anchor tenants.
*The Oasis, food and leisure space.
*The Lanes, adjacent to the Oasis, a small shopping area with 20 small, independent and specialty shops.

===Oasis===

The Oasis Dining Quarter is Meadowhall&#x27;s food court which has food outlets and seating on both floors. The ground floor contains mostly fast food outlets, with some restaurants and a pub. The upper floor has restaurants and a cinema. In July 2011 it has £7 million redevelopment with a renaming from the &#x27;Oasis Food Court&#x27;, to the &#x27;Oasis Dining Quarter&#x27;, more restaurants were added as part of the redevelopment.

The dining quarter includes an eleven screen multiplex cinema. It opened as a Warner Bros Theatre in 1993, becoming a Warner Village Cinema and was rebranded Vue in 2004. The cinema was refurbished after the 2007 flooding.

==Transport==
The centre is located at junction 34 of the M1 motorway. Meadowhall Interchange, is the only bus, rail and tram interchange serving a shopping centre in the UK.
===Interchange===
Meadowhall is served by two stops on the Sheffield Supertram network; the Yellow Line terminus at Meadowhall Interchange is located to the north of the shopping centre, while Tinsley / Meadowhall South tram stop is located to the south of the shopping centre and is served by the Yellow Line and tram-train services to Rotherham Parkgate. Meadowhall Interchange tram stop is located 15 minutes from the city centre and Meadowhall is used as a park and ride. The Yellow Line from Meadowhall passes the Sheffield Arena, Ice Sheffield, the Institute Of Sport and the Valley Centertainment entertainment complex.

The interchange has a large bus station with routes covering most of South Yorkshire, but especially the local Sheffield and Rotherham area.

There is a multi-platform railway station at Meadowhall which has frequent links to and from , , and Manchester.

== Awards ==
The centre has won awards, including two awards for innovative events at the ICSC maxi awards 2006, held in Chicago and two awards for its Retail Bonding Programme (in best Retail Partnership category) and also for its commercialisation, (adding value to the customer shopping experience) at the BCSC Purple Apple Awards in London.

== Environmental policy ==

The centre recycles 97% of waste from retailers and customers, with the remaining three per cent going to incineration with energy recovery; no waste goes to landfill.

Meadowhall was the first UK shopping centre to develop an on-site recycling facility. The Resource Recovery Centre, which opened in 2006, operates a conveyor belt system to separate out types of waste, from paper to plastic, cardboard to cans.

Meadowhall began to harvest rainwater in 2006. Four water storage tanks collect rainwater and condensation from air conditioning. This is then used throughout the Shopping Centre for cleaning, flushing toilets and watering the external landscaped areas. The tanks are nearly 7 metres high and can hold of water each.

In 2008, Meadowhall installed a bore hole. This is a narrow shaft drilled into the ground that collects water from beneath the earth. Water from the bore hole is collected into a master tank. The storage tanks are connected onto a &quot;network&quot;, which will ensure 90–95% of all water used by customers and retailers for flushing toilets is derived from rainwater harvesting or bore hole water.

== Facial recognition trial ==
In 2018, Meadowhall was the site of a month-long police trial of facial recognition software by South Yorkshire Police, without the public&#x27;s knowledge. In August 2019, a spokeswoman for British Land, Meadowhall&#x27;s owner, said, &quot;Over a year ago we conducted a short trial at Meadowhall, in conjunction with the police, and all data was deleted immediately after the trial&quot;. Big Brother Watch&#x27;s chief executive Silkie Carlo was reported by the BBC as saying, &quot;There is an epidemic of facial recognition in the UK. The collusion between police and private companies in building these surveillance nets around popular spaces is deeply disturbing&quot;.

<doc id="311141" wikidata="Q838534" url="?curid=311141" title="Paraná Clube">
<text>Paraná Clube, commonly referred to as Paraná, is a Brazilian professional club based in Curitiba, Paraná founded on 19 December 1989. It competes in the Campeonato Paranaense Série Prata, the second tier of the Paraná state football league.

Established on 19 December 1989, in the Vila Capanema district, it is one of several Brazilian clubs called &quot;Tricolor da Vila&quot; (&quot;tricolored of the town&quot;) by its fans because it has three team colors. Paraná&#x27;s three colors are red, white and blue. Apart from football, other sports sponsored at the club are bowling, futsal, martial arts, tennis, volleyball and weight-lifting.

==History==
On 19 December 1989, Paraná Clube was founded by the merger of EC Pinheiros (three times winner of the state championship (1967 as Savóia FC Água Verde, 1984, 1987)), and Colorado EC (winner of one state championship (1980)). Rubens Minelli was hired as the club&#x27;s first manager, and Emerson de Andrade was chosen as the director of football.

The club&#x27;s first match was played on 4 February 1990, when Coritiba beat Paraná 1–0 at the Estádio Couto Pereira.

In 1991, two years after the club&#x27;s foundation, Paraná won its first state championship. Later, Paraná would win five state championships in a row, from 1993 to 1997.

In 1992, the club won the Campeonato Brasileiro Série B, gaining the right to compete in the following year&#x27;s Série A. After 8 years, Paraná Clube won another national championship. In 2000, Paraná beat AD São Caetano to win the Yellow Module of the João Havelange Cup. This cup replaced the Campeonato Brasileiro (all levels), which had been suspended for one year.

On 9 April 2006, Paraná Clube won the Paraná State League for the 7th time after beating ADAP of Campo Mourão 3–0 in the Maringá and drawing 1–1 at Pinheirão Stadium. The attendance of the final match was 25,306 supporters. 2006 was one of the club&#x27;s best ever years, finishing fifth in the 2006 Série A and gaining a berth for the 2007 Libertadores. Highlights of the campaign were victories over Gremio (5-2), Flamengo (4-1), and Ponte Preta (5-2).

Estadio Vila Capanema was renovated in 2006. The capacity rose to 20,083 spectators, and the inaugural match was held on 20 September 2006 when Paraná beat Fortaleza 2–0 in the Campeonato Brasileiro.

In 2007, Paraná played its first Copa Libertadores match. In the first stage, Paraná eliminated Cobreloa from Chile, winning the first leg 2–0 in Calama and drawing 1–1 in Curitiba. In the group stage, composed by Parana Clube, Flamengo, Union Maracaibo and Real Potosi, the club finished in second place. Paraná was eliminated in the Round of 16 by Libertad, of Paraguay. In the 2007 Serie A, the club spent most of the season in mid table, but after a heavy 6-0 loss to Sao Paulo the club went into free-fall, losing ten of their last fifteen matches.

After 10 years in the second division, Paraná gained access to the first division of the Brazilian Championship, defeating CRB 1-0 for the 37th round of Serie B 2017. In the 2018 Serie A, the club had an even worse campaign from 2007, registering only 4 wins all season and finishing in last place with 23 points. 

Since then the club has been in a free-fall, suffering a double relegation; in 2020 Parana was relegated after an poor campaign in the Serie B, and the following season the club was relegated from the Serie C. In 2022, the club was relegated from the state league&#x27;s top division. 

==Stadiums==

Paraná Clube&#x27;s official stadium is Estádio Durival Britto e Silva, also known as Vila Capanema. They occasionally used to play at the Pinheirão. Vila Olímpica also belongs to Paraná Clube but it is only used for training:
* Estádio Durival Britto e Silva (Vila Capanema): capacity 20,000 spectators.
* Estádio Erton Coelho de Queiroz (Vila Olímpica): capacity 18,500 spectators.

<doc id="311144" wikidata="Q257953" url="?curid=311144" title="Margaret Fuller">
<text>Sarah Margaret Fuller (May 23, 1810 – July 19, 1850), sometimes referred to as Margaret Fuller Ossoli, was an American journalist, editor, critic, translator, and women&#x27;s rights advocate associated with the American transcendentalism movement. She was the first American female war correspondent and full-time book reviewer in journalism. Her book &quot;Woman in the Nineteenth Century&quot; is considered the first major feminist work in the United States.

Born Sarah Margaret Fuller in Cambridge, Massachusetts, she was given a substantial early education by her father, Timothy Fuller, a lawyer who died in 1835 due to cholera. She later had more formal schooling and became a teacher before, in 1839, she began overseeing her Conversations series: classes for women meant to compensate for their lack of access to higher education. She became the first editor of the transcendentalist journal &quot;The Dial&quot; in 1840, which was the year her writing career started to succeed, before joining the staff of the &quot;New-York Tribune&quot; under Horace Greeley in 1844. By the time she was in her 30s, Fuller had earned a reputation as the person in New England, male or female, and became the first woman allowed to use the library at Harvard College. Her seminal work, &quot;Woman in the Nineteenth Century&quot;, was published in 1845. A year later, she was sent to Europe for the &quot;Tribune&quot; as its first female correspondent. She soon became involved with the revolutions in Italy and allied herself with Giuseppe Mazzini. She had a relationship with Giovanni Ossoli, with whom she had a child. All three members of the family died in a shipwreck off Fire Island, New York, as they were traveling to the United States in 1850. Fuller&#x27;s body was never recovered.

Fuller was an advocate of women&#x27;s rights and, in particular, women&#x27;s education and the right to employment. Fuller, along with Samuel Taylor Coleridge, wanted to stay free of what she called the &quot;strong mental odor&quot; of female teachers. She also encouraged many other reforms in society, including prison reform and the emancipation of slaves in the United States. Many other advocates for women&#x27;s rights and feminism, including Susan B. Anthony, cited Fuller as a source of inspiration. Many of her contemporaries, however, were not supportive, including her former friend Harriet Martineau, who said that Fuller was a talker rather than an activist. Shortly after Fuller&#x27;s death, her importance faded. The editors who prepared her letters to be published, believing that her fame would be short-lived, censored or altered much of her work before publication.

==Biography==

===Early life and family===

Sarah Margaret Fuller was born on May 23, 1810, in Cambridgeport, Massachusetts, the first child of Congressman Timothy Fuller and Margaret Crane Fuller. She was named after her paternal grandmother and her mother, but by age nine she dropped &quot;Sarah&quot; and insisted on being called &quot;Margaret.&quot; The Margaret Fuller House, in which she was born, is still standing. Her father taught her to read and write at the age of three and a half, shortly after the couple&#x27;s second daughter, Julia Adelaide, died at 14 months old. He offered her an education as rigorous as any boy&#x27;s at the time and forbade her to read the typical feminine fare of the time, such as etiquette books and sentimental novels. He incorporated Latin into his teaching shortly after the birth of the couple&#x27;s son Eugene in May 1815, and soon Margaret was translating simple passages from Virgil.

Later in life, Margaret blamed her father&#x27;s exacting love and his valuation of accuracy and precision for her childhood nightmares and sleepwalking. During the day, Margaret spent time with her mother, who taught her household chores and sewing. In 1817, her brother William Henry Fuller was born, and her father was elected as a representative to the United States Congress. For the next eight years, he spent four to six months a year in Washington, D.C. At age ten, Fuller wrote a cryptic note which her father saved: &quot;On 23 May 1810, was born one foredoomed to sorrow and pain, and like others to have misfortunes.&quot;

Fuller began her formal education at the Port School in Cambridgeport in 1819 before attending the Boston Lyceum for Young Ladies from 1821 to 1822. In 1824, she was sent to the School for Young Ladies in Groton, on the advice of aunts and uncles, though she resisted the idea at first. While she was there, Timothy Fuller did not run for re-election, in order to help John Quincy Adams with his presidential campaign in 1824; he hoped Adams would return the favor with a governmental appointment. On June 17, 1825, Fuller attended the ceremony at which the American Revolutionary War hero Marquis de Lafayette laid the cornerstone of the Bunker Hill Monument 50 years after the battle. The 15-year-old Fuller introduced herself to Lafayette in a letter which concluded: &quot;Should we both live, and it is possible to a female, to whom the avenues of glory are seldom accessible, I will recal my name to your recollection.&quot; Early on, Fuller sensed herself to be a significant person and thinker. Fuller left the Groton school after two years and returned home at 16. At home, she studied the classics and trained herself in several modern languages and read world literature.

By this time, she realized she did not fit in with other young women her age. She wrote, &quot;I have felt that I was not born to the common womanly lot.&quot; Eliza Farrar, wife of Harvard professor John Farrar and author of &quot;The Young Lady&#x27;s Friend&quot; (1836), attempted to train her in feminine etiquette until the age of 20, but was never wholly successful.

===Early career===
Fuller was an avid reader, known for translating German literature and bringing German Romanticism to the United States. By the time she was in her 30s, she had earned a reputation as the best-read person, male or female, in New England. She used her knowledge to give private lessons based on the teaching style of Elizabeth Palmer Peabody. Fuller hoped to earn her living through journalism and translation; her first published work, a response to historian George Bancroft, appeared in November 1834 in the &quot;North American Review&quot;.

When she was 23, her father&#x27;s law practice failed and he moved the family to a farm in Groton. On February 20, 1835, Frederic Henry Hedge and James Freeman Clarke asked her to contribute to each of their periodicals. Clarke helped her publish her first literary review in the &quot;Western Messenger&quot; in June: criticisms of recent biographies on George Crabbe and Hannah More. In the fall of that year, she developed a terrible migraine with a fever that lasted nine days. Fuller continued to experience such headaches throughout her life. While she was still recovering, her father died of cholera on October 2, 1835. She was deeply affected by his death: &quot;My father&#x27;s image follows me constantly&quot;, she wrote. She vowed to step in as the head of the family and take care of her widowed mother and younger siblings. Her father had not left a will, and two of her uncles gained control of his property and finances, later assessed at $18,098.15, (~$ in ) and the family had to rely on them for support. Humiliated by the way her uncles were treating the family, Fuller wrote that she regretted being &quot;of the softer sex, and never more than now&quot;.

Around this time, Fuller was hoping to prepare a biography of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, but felt that she could work on it only if she traveled to Europe. Her father&#x27;s death and her sudden responsibility for her family caused her to abandon this idea. In 1836, Fuller was given a job teaching at Bronson Alcott&#x27;s Temple School in Boston, where she remained for a year. She then accepted an invitation to teach under Hiram Fuller (no relation) at the Greene Street School in Providence, Rhode Island, in April 1837 with the unusually high salary of $1,000 (~$ in ) per year. Her family sold the Groton farm and Fuller moved with them to Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts. On November 6, 1839, Fuller held the first of her Conversations, discussions among local women who met in the Boston home of the Peabodys. Fuller intended to compensate for the lack of women&#x27;s education with discussions and debates focused on subjects including the fine arts, history, mythology, literature, and nature.

Serving as the &quot;nucleus of conversation&quot;, Fuller also intended to answer the &quot;great questions&quot; facing women and encourage women &quot;to question, to define, to state and examine their opinions&quot;. She asked her participants, &quot;What were we born to do? How shall we do it? Which so few ever propose to themselves &#x27;till their best years are gone by&quot;. In Conversations, Fuller was finally finding equal intellectual companions among her female contemporaries. A number of significant figures in the women&#x27;s rights movement attended these gatherings, including Sophia Dana Ripley, Caroline Sturgis, and Maria White Lowell.

===&quot;The Dial&quot;===
In October 1839, Ralph Waldo Emerson was seeking an editor for his transcendentalist journal &quot;The Dial&quot;. After several declined the position, he offered it to Fuller, referring to her as &quot;my vivacious friend.&quot; Emerson had met Fuller in Cambridge in 1835; of that meeting, he admitted: &quot;she made me laugh more than I liked.&quot; The next summer, Fuller spent two weeks at Emerson&#x27;s home in Concord. Fuller accepted Emerson&#x27;s offer to edit &quot;The Dial&quot; on October 20, 1839, and began work in the first week of 1840. She edited the journal from 1840 to 1842, though her promised annual salary of $200 was never paid. Because of her role, she was soon recognized as one of the most important figures of the transcendental movement and was invited to George Ripley&#x27;s Brook Farm, a communal experiment. Fuller never officially joined the community but was a frequent visitor, often spending New Year&#x27;s Eve there. In the summer of 1843, she traveled to Chicago, Milwaukee, Niagara Falls, and Buffalo, New York; while there, she interacted with several Native Americans, including members of the Ottawa and the Chippewa tribes. She reported her experiences in a book called &quot;Summer on the Lakes&quot;, which she completed writing on her 34th birthday in 1844. The critic Evert Augustus Duyckinck called it &quot;the only genuine book, I can think of, this season.&quot; Fuller used the library at Harvard College to do research on the Great Lakes region, and became the first woman allowed to use Harvard&#x27;s library.

Fuller&#x27;s &quot;The Great Lawsuit&quot; was written in serial form for &quot;The Dial&quot;. She originally intended to name the work &quot;The Great Lawsuit: Man &#x27;versus&#x27; Men, Woman &#x27;versus&#x27; Women&quot;; when it was expanded and published independently in 1845, it was entitled &quot;Woman in the Nineteenth Century&quot;. After completing it, she wrote to a friend: &quot;I had put a good deal of my true self in it, as if, I suppose I went away now, the measure of my footprint would be left on earth.&quot; The work discussed the role that women played in American democracy and Fuller&#x27;s opinion on possibilities for improvement. It has since become one of the major documents in American feminism. It is considered the first of its kind in the United States. Soon after the American publication of &quot;Woman in the Nineteenth Century&quot;, it was pirated and published by H.G. Clarke in England. Despite never receiving commissions due to a lack of international copyright laws, Fuller was &quot;very glad to find it will be read by women&quot; around the world.

===&quot;New-York Tribune&quot;===

Fuller left &quot;The Dial&quot; in 1844 in part because of ill health but also because of her disappointment with the publication&#x27;s dwindling subscription list. She moved to New York that autumn and joined Horace Greeley&#x27;s &quot;New-York Tribune&quot; as a literary critic, becoming the first full-time book reviewer in American journalism and, by 1846, the publication&#x27;s first female editor. Her first article, a review of a collection of essays by Emerson, appeared in the December 1, 1844, issue. At this time, the &quot;Tribune&quot; had some 50,000 subscribers and Fuller earned $500 a year for her work. In addition to American books, she reviewed foreign literature, concerts, lectures, and art exhibits. During her four years with the publication, she published more than 250 columns, most signed with a &quot;*&quot; as a byline. In these columns, Fuller discussed topics ranging from art and literature to political and social issues such as the plight of slaves and women&#x27;s rights. She also published poetry; her poems, styled after the work of Emerson, do not have the same intellectual vigor as her criticism.

Around this time, she was also involved in a scandal involving fellow literary critic Edgar Allan Poe, who had been carrying on a public flirtation with the married poet Frances Sargent Osgood. Another poet, Elizabeth F. Ellet, had become enamored of Poe and jealous of Osgood and suggested the relationship between Poe and Osgood was more than an innocent flirtation. Osgood then sent Fuller and Anne Lynch Botta to Poe&#x27;s cottage on her behalf to request that he return the personal letters she had sent him. Angered by their interference, Poe called them &quot;Busy-bodies&quot;. A public scandal erupted and continued until Osgood&#x27;s estranged husband, Samuel Stillman Osgood, stepped in and threatened to sue Ellet.

===Assignment in Europe===

In 1846, the &quot;New-York Tribune&quot; sent Fuller to Europe, specifically England and Italy, as its first female foreign correspondent. She traveled from Boston to Liverpool in August on the &quot;Cambria&quot;, a vessel that used both sail and steam to make the journey in ten days and sixteen hours. Over the next four years she provided the &quot;Tribune&quot; with thirty-seven dispatches. She interviewed many prominent writers including George Sand and Thomas Carlyle—whom she found disappointing because of his reactionary politics, among other things. George Sand had previously been an idol of hers, but Fuller was disappointed when Sand chose not to run for the French National Assembly, saying that women were not ready to vote or to hold political office. Fuller was also given a letter of introduction to Elizabeth Barrett by Cornelius Mathews, but did not meet her at that time, because Barrett had just eloped with Robert Browning.

In England in the spring of 1846, she met Giuseppe Mazzini, who had been in exile there from Italy since 1837. Fuller also met the Roman patriot Giovanni Angelo Ossoli, a marquis belonging to a noble family of moderate means who worked as an employee at an uncle&#x27;s commercial office and at the same time volunteered in the Civic Guard corps (then National Guard). Fuller and Ossoli moved in together in Florence, Italy, likely before they were married; whether they ever married is uncertain. Fuller was originally opposed to marrying him, in part because she was Protestant and he was Catholic. Emerson speculated that the couple was &quot;married perhaps in Oct. Nov. or Dec&quot; of 1847, though he did not explain his reasoning. Biographers have speculated that the couple married on April 4, 1848, to celebrate the anniversary of their first meeting but one biographer provided evidence they first met on April 1 during the ceremony called &quot;Lavanda degli Altari&quot; (Altars Lavage). By the time the couple moved to Florence, they were referred to as husband and wife, though it is unclear if any formal ceremony took place. It seems certain that at the time their child was born, they were not married. 

Around New Year&#x27;s Day 1848, she suspected she was pregnant, but kept it from Ossoli for several weeks. Their child, Angelo Eugene Philip Ossoli, was born in early September 1848 and nicknamed Angelino. The couple was very secretive about their relationship, but after Angelino suffered an unnamed illness they became less so. Fuller informed her mother about Ossoli and Angelino in August 1849 in a letter that explained that she had kept silent so as not to upset her &quot;but it has become necessary, on account of the child, for us to live publicly and permanently together.&quot; Her mother&#x27;s response suggests that she was aware that the couple was not legally married. She was nevertheless happy for her daughter, writing: &quot;I send my first kiss with my fervent blessing to my grandson.&quot;

The couple supported Giuseppe Mazzini&#x27;s movement for the establishment of a Roman Republic proclaimed on February 9, 1849, after it had been voted by the Constituent Assembly, elected by universal male suffrage in January 1849. The fundamental decree of the Roman Republic stated: &quot;Art. 1. - The Pope has lapsed in fact and in law from the temporal government of the Roman State. Art. 2. —- The Roman Pontiff will have all the necessary guarantees for independence in the exercise of his spiritual power. Art. 3 - The form of the government of the Roman state will be pure democracy, and will take on the glorious name of Roman Republic. Art. 4. - The Roman Republic will have with the rest of Italy the relations required by the common nationality.&quot;

The Pope resisted this statement and asked for international intervention to be restored in his temporal power. Catholic mobilization on behalf of papal sovereignty was thus sparked. French zouaves were the first to respond to his appeal and besieged Rome. Ossoli fought on the ramparts of the Vatican walls while Fuller volunteered at two supporting hospitals. When the patriots they supported met defeat, the couple believed it safer to flee Rome and decided to move to Florence and, in 1850, to the United States. In Florence they finally met Elizabeth Barrett Browning. Fuller used her experience in Italy to begin a book about the history of the Roman Republic—a work she may have begun as early as 1847— and hoped to find an American publisher after a British one rejected it. She believed the work would be her most important, referring to it in a March 1849 letter to her brother Richard as &quot;something good which may survive my troubled existence.&quot;

===Death===
In the beginning of 1850, Fuller wrote to a friend: &quot;It has long seemed that in the year 1850 I should stand on some important plateau in the ascent of life ... I feel however no marked and important change as yet.&quot; Also that year, Fuller wrote: &quot;I am absurdly fearful and various omens have combined to give me a dark feeling ... It seems to me that my future upon earth will soon close ... I have a vague expectation of some crisis—I know not what&quot;. A few days after writing this, Fuller, Ossoli, and their child began a five-week return voyage to the United States aboard the ship &quot;Elizabeth&quot;, an American merchant freighter carrying cargo that included mostly marble from Carrara. They set sail on May 17. At sea, the ship&#x27;s captain, Seth Hasty, died of smallpox. Angelino contracted the disease and recovered.

Possibly because of the inexperienced first mate now serving as captain, the ship slammed into a sandbar less than 100 yards from Fire Island, New York, on July 19, 1850, around Many of the other passengers and crew members abandoned ship. The first mate, Mr. Bangs, urged Fuller and Ossoli to try to save themselves and their child as he himself jumped overboard, later claiming he believed Fuller had wanted to be left behind to die. On the beach, people arrived with carts hoping to salvage any cargo washed ashore. None made any effort to rescue the crew or passengers of the &quot;Elizabeth&quot;, though they were only 50 yards from shore. Most of those aboard attempted to swim to shore, leaving Fuller and Ossoli and Angelino some of the last on the ship. Ossoli was thrown overboard by a massive wave and, after the wave had passed, a crewman who witnessed the event said Fuller could not be seen.

Henry David Thoreau traveled to New York City at the urging of Emerson to search the shore, but neither Fuller&#x27;s body nor that of her husband was ever recovered. Angelino&#x27;s had washed ashore. Few of their possessions were found other than some of the child&#x27;s clothes and a few letters. Fuller&#x27;s manuscript on the rise and fall of the 1849 Roman Republic, which she described as &quot;what is most valuable to me if I live of any thing&quot;, was also lost. A memorial to Fuller was erected on the beach at Fire Island in 1901 through the efforts of Julia Ward Howe. A cenotaph to Fuller and Ossoli, under which Angelino is buried, is in Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The inscription reads, in part:

Within a week after her death, Horace Greeley suggested to Emerson that a biography of Fuller, to be called &quot;Margaret and Her Friends&quot;, be prepared quickly &quot;before the interest excited by her sad decease has passed away&quot;. Many of her writings were soon collected together by her brother Arthur as &quot;At Home and Abroad&quot; (1856) and &quot;Life Without and Life Within&quot; (1858). He also edited a new version of &quot;Woman in the Nineteenth Century&quot; in 1855. In February 1852, &quot;The Memoirs of Margaret Fuller Ossoli&quot; was published, edited by Emerson, James Freeman Clarke, and William Henry Channing, though much of the work was censored or reworded. It left out details about her love affair with Ossoli and an earlier relationship with a man named James Nathan. The three editors, believing the public interest in Fuller would be short-lived and that she would not survive as a historical figure, were not concerned about accuracy. For a time, it was the best-selling biography of the decade and went through thirteen editions before the end of the century. The book focused on her personality rather than her work. Detractors of the book ignored her status as a critic and instead criticized her personal life and her &quot;unwomanly&quot; arrogance.

Since her death, the majority of Fuller&#x27;s extant papers are kept at Houghton Library and Boston Public Library. She was also voted sixth in a mass magazine poll to select twenty American women for the Hall of Fame for Great Americans at University Heights in New York City in 1902.

==Beliefs==

Fuller was an early proponent of feminism and especially believed in providing education to women. Once equal educational rights were afforded women, she believed, women could push for equal political rights as well. She advocated that women seek any employment they wish, rather than catering to the stereotypical &quot;feminine&quot; roles of the time, such as teaching. She once said, &quot;If you ask me what office women should fill, I reply—any ... let them be sea captains if you will. I do not doubt that there are women well fitted for such an office&quot;. She had great confidence in all women but doubted that a woman would produce a lasting work of art or literature in her time and disliked the popular female poets of her time. Fuller also warned women to be careful about marriage and not to become dependent on their husbands. As she wrote, &quot;I wish woman to live, &quot;first&quot; for God&#x27;s sake. Then she will not make an imperfect man for her god and thus sink to idolatry. Then she will not take what is not fit for her from a sense of weakness and poverty&quot;. By 1832, she had made a personal commitment to stay single. Fuller also questioned a definitive line between male and female: &quot;There is no wholly masculine man ... no purely feminine&quot; but that both were present in any individual. She suggested also that within a female were two parts: the intellectual side (which she called the Minerva) and the &quot;lyrical&quot; or &quot;Femality&quot; side (the Muse). She admired the work of Emanuel Swedenborg, who believed men and women shared &quot;an angelic ministry&quot;, as she wrote, as well as Charles Fourier, who placed &quot;Woman on an entire equality with Man&quot;. Unlike several contemporary women writers, including &quot;Mrs. Sigourney&quot; and &quot;Mrs. Stowe&quot;, she was familiarly referred to in a less formal manner as &quot;Margaret&quot;.

Fuller also advocated reform at all levels of society, including prison. In October 1844, she visited Sing Sing and interviewed the women prisoners, even staying overnight in the facility. Sing Sing was developing a more humane system for its women inmates, many of whom were prostitutes. Fuller was also concerned about the homeless and those living in dire poverty, especially in New York. She also admitted that, though she was raised to believe &quot;that the Indian obstinately refused to be civilized&quot;, her travels in the American West made her realize that the white man unfairly treated the Native Americans; she considered Native Americans an important part of American heritage. She also supported the rights of African-Americans, referring to &quot;this cancer of slavery&quot;, and suggested that those who were interested in the abolition movement follow the same reasoning when considering the rights of women: &quot;As the friend of the Negro assumes that one man cannot by right hold another in bondage, so should the Friend of Woman assume that Man cannot by right lay even well-meant restrictions on Woman.&quot; She suggested that those who spoke against the emancipation of slaves were similar to those who did not support the emancipation of Italy.

Fuller agreed with the transcendental concern for the psychological well-being of the individual, though she was never comfortable being labeled a transcendentalist. Even so, she wrote, if being labeled a transcendentalist means &quot;that I have an active mind frequently busy with large topics I hope it is so&quot;. She criticized people such as Emerson, however, for focusing too much on individual improvement and not enough on social reform. Like other members of the so-called Transcendental Club, she rebelled against the past and believed in the possibility of change. However, unlike others in the movement, her rebellion was not based on religion. Though Fuller occasionally attended Unitarian congregations, she did not entirely identify with that religion. As biographer Charles Capper has noted, she &quot;was happy to remain on the Unitarian margins.&quot;

Fuller has been cited as a vegetarian because she criticized the slaughter of animals for food in her book &quot;Woman in the Nineteenth Century&quot;. However, biographer Margaret Vanderhaar Allen wrote that Fuller did not fully endorse vegetarianism as she was repelled by the fanaticism and moral rigorism of vegetarians.

==Legacy and criticism==

Margaret Fuller was especially known in her time for her personality and, in particular, for being overly self-confident and having a bad temper. This personality was the inspiration for the character Hester Prynne in Nathaniel Hawthorne&#x27;s novel &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot;, specifically her radical thinking about &quot;the whole race of womanhood&quot;. She may also be the basis for the character Zenobia in another of Hawthorne&#x27;s works, &quot;The Blithedale Romance&quot;. Hawthorne and his then-fiancée Sophia had first met Fuller in October 1839.

She was also an inspiration to poet Walt Whitman, who believed in her call for the forging of a new national identity and a truly American literature. Elizabeth Barrett Browning was also a strong admirer, but believed that Fuller&#x27;s unconventional views were unappreciated in the United States and therefore she was better off dead. She also said that Fuller&#x27;s history of the Roman Republic would have been her greatest work: &quot;The work she was preparing upon Italy would probably have been more equal to her faculty than anything previously produced by her pen (her other writings being curiously inferior to the impressions her conversation gave you)&quot;. An 1860 essay collection, &quot;Historical Pictures Retouched&quot;, by Caroline Healey Dall, called Fuller&#x27;s &quot;Woman in the Nineteenth Century&quot; &quot;doubtless the most brilliant, complete, and scholarly statement ever made on the subject&quot;. Despite his personal issues with Fuller, the typically harsh literary critic Edgar Allan Poe wrote of the work as &quot;a book which few women in the country could have written, and no woman in the country would have published, with the exception of Miss Fuller&quot;, noting its &quot;independence&quot; and &quot;unmitigated radicalism&quot;. Thoreau also thought highly of the book, suggesting that its strength came in part from Fuller&#x27;s conversational ability, and called it &quot;rich extempore writing, talking with pen in hand&quot;.

Another admirer of Fuller was Susan B. Anthony, a pioneer of women&#x27;s rights, who wrote that Fuller &quot;possessed more influence on the thought of American women than any woman previous to her time&quot;. Fuller&#x27;s work may have partially inspired the Seneca Falls Convention in 1848. Anthony, along with Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Matilda Joslyn Gage, wrote in their &quot;History of Woman Suffrage&quot; that Fuller &quot;was the precursor of the Women&#x27;s Rights agitation&quot;. Modern scholars have suggested &quot;Woman in the Nineteenth Century&quot; was the first major women&#x27;s rights work since Mary Wollstonecraft&#x27;s &quot;A Vindication of the Rights of Woman&quot; (1792), though an early comparison between the two women came from George Eliot in 1855. It is unclear if Fuller was familiar with Wollstonecraft&#x27;s works; in her childhood, her father prevented her from reading them. In 1995, Fuller was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

Fuller was not without her critics. A one-time friend, the English writer Harriet Martineau, was one of her harshest detractors after Fuller&#x27;s death. Martineau said that Fuller was a talker rather than an activist, that she had &quot;shallow conceits&quot; and often &quot;looked down upon persons who acted instead of talking finely ... and despised those who, like myself, could not adopt her scale of valuation&quot;. The influential editor Rufus Wilmot Griswold, who believed she went against his notion of feminine modesty, referred to &quot;Woman in the Nineteenth Century&quot; as &quot;an eloquent expression of her discontent at having been created female&quot;. New York writer Charles Frederick Briggs said that she was &quot;wasting the time of her readers&quot;, especially because she was an unmarried woman and therefore could not &quot;truly represent the female character&quot;. English writer and critic Matthew Arnold scoffed at Fuller&#x27;s conversations as well, saying, &quot;My G–d, what rot did she and the other female dogs of Boston talk about Greek mythology!&quot; Sophia Hawthorne, who had previously been a supporter of Fuller, was critical of her after &quot;Woman of the Nineteenth Century&quot; was published:
Fuller had angered fellow poet and critic James Russell Lowell when she reviewed his work, calling him &quot;absolutely wanting in the true spirit and tone of poesy ... his verse is stereotyped, his thought sounds no depth; and posterity will not remember him.&quot; In response, Lowell took revenge in his satirical &quot;A Fable for Critics&quot;, first published in October 1848. At first he considered excluding her entirely, but ultimately gave her what was called the &quot;most wholly negative characterization&quot; in the work. Referring to her as Miranda, Lowell wrote that she stole old ideas and presented them as her own, she was genuine only in her spite and &quot;when acting as censor, she privately blows a censer of vanity &#x27;neath her own nose&quot;.

Shortly after Fuller&#x27;s death, her importance faded. Her obituary in the newspaper she had once edited, the &quot;Daily Tribune&quot;, said that her works had a few great sentiments, &quot;but as a whole they must commend themselves mainly by their vigor of thought and habitual fearlessness rather than freedom of utterance&quot;. As biographer Abby Slater wrote, &quot;Margaret had been demoted from a position of importance in her own right to one in which her only importance was in the company she kept&quot;. Years later, Hawthorne&#x27;s son Julian wrote, &quot;The majority of readers will, I think, not be inconsolable that poor Margaret Fuller has at last taken her place with the numberless other dismal frauds who fill the limbo of human pretension and failure.&quot; Thomas R. Mitchell claims that Julian Hawthorne purposely misrepresented his father Nathaniel&#x27;s journal entries concerning Fuller, in order to benefit his father’s literary reputation at the expense of Fuller’s. In the twentieth century, American writer Elizabeth Hardwick wrote an essay called &quot;The Genius of Margaret Fuller&quot; (1986). She compared her own move from Boston to New York to Fuller&#x27;s, saying that Boston was not a good place for intellectuals, despite the assumption that it was the best place for intellectuals.

In 1995, Fuller was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

On June 21, 2016, a historical marker in honor of Fuller was placed in Polhill Park in Beacon, NY, to commemorate her staying at Van Vliet boarding house. For the dedication ceremony, Fuller&#x27;s poem, &quot;Truth and Form,&quot; was set to music by Debra Kaye and performed by singer Kelly Ellenwood.

<text>The Battle of Whitney&#x27;s Lane, also known as the Action at Whitney&#x27;s Lane, was a small, but psychologically important, land battle of the American Civil War fought on May 19, 1862, in north-central Arkansas.

== Strategic situation ==

=== Union situation ===
In early 1862, Union Major General Samuel R. Curtis had successfully invaded northwest Arkansas and defeated Confederate forces at the Battle of Pea Ridge. Soon after, most Confederate forces in Arkansas were withdrawn across the Mississippi River, leaving the state almost defenseless. Curtis intended to press his invasion with the hope of reaching the capital city of Little Rock and knocking the state out of the war.

=== Confederate situation ===
The Confederate outlook in the spring of 1862 was grim. Most of its armed forces had been withdrawn from Arkansas and no commander with field experience remained. General John Selden Roane was put in charge of the remaining Arkansas forces.

== Maneuvering to battle ==

=== Union movements ===
General Curtis began his movement from northwest Arkansas in early April. He moved his 17,000-man army back into Missouri to take advantage of better transportation routes and headed east. He established his base of supply at Rolla, Missouri. Curtis reached West Plains, Missouri on April 29 and turned southwards into Arkansas. In addition to his large force, Curtis was assigned an additional 5,000 men under Brigadier General Frederick Steele.

During the first part of May, Curtis and Steele encountered numerous logistical difficulties. Poor weather, difficult terrain, and lack of consistent resupply slowed their progress. But by May 9, Curtis&#x27; large, but ill-supplied, force had emerged from the Ozark foothills onto flat ground at Searcy. It was poised to strike deep into central Arkansas and seize Little Rock itself as soon as supplies were gathered. While encamped at Searcy, Curtis and overall commander Major General Henry W. Halleck began to correspond about the upcoming Federal administration of Little Rock.

=== Confederate movements ===
Confederate General Roane set to work immediately in cobbling together a defense to meet the approaching Union Army. Roane stopped elements of the 12th Texas Cavalry that were bound for the eastern theaters and ordered troops who had made it as far as Memphis, Tennessee to turn around. Some attempts at recruiting local volunteers were made, but with little success.

On May 10, Roane sent Texas cavalry as scouts to determine the federal position. The scouts encountered numerous refugees fleeing the Union Army. The refugees reported that the Union forces numbered about 30,000, mostly German immigrants. Roane had approximately 1,200 Texas horsemen to confront this force. He ordered cotton stores near Searcy destroyed, and Governor Henry Massey Rector prepared government offices for evacuation. Meanwhile, small advance parties from the Union Army clashed with the Texas scouts between Searcy and Little Rock, and a few Union casualties resulted.

By May 19, several companies of the Texas cavalry had reached Searcy Landing and awaited an opportunity to strike the overwhelming opponent.

== Battle ==
Union General Curtis continued to worry about logistical problems, as his supply line was unable to provide the necessities for his army. He ordered Colonel Peter J. Osterhaus to send a strong foraging party to nearby farms. It consisted of seven companies of mixed infantry and cavalry from the 17th Missouri Infantry and the 4th Missouri Cavalry. The forage party crossed the Little Red River and proceeded to two farms along Whitney&#x27;s Lane.

Scouting parties reported the movement of these companies to Colonel Emory Rogers, commander of approximately 150 Texas cavalrymen and local volunteers. About 300 additional Confederate troops were on the way, but Rogers decided to attack even though he was outnumbered. He divided his forces into two groups of Texans and one of Arkansans and ordered a mounted charge down the lane.

The initial charge overran Company H of the 17th Missouri, which dissolved under fire and fled toward Company F, which was attempting to set up a defensive position in a treeline. The combined companies fought bravely for a few minutes, as more Confederates came up to press them. The untrained and undisciplined Texans and local volunteers attacked furiously, and in some cases apparently ignored Union soldiers&#x27; attempts to surrender. Within a short time, Company F had been routed as well.

Meanwhile, Company G of the 17th and some Union cavalry moved forward and traded volleys with the Confederate horsemen. Major Eugen Kielmansegge of the 4th Missouri Cavalry ordered the rest of the available Union troopers to charge the Confederates. Company C of the 4th Missouri Cavalry plowed into the attackers and managed to drive them back into the woods between the foraging detail and the rest of the Federal army. Other Federal cavalry continued to arrive at the position. Kielmansegge, having concentrated his forces, set up a defensive position and continued to exchange fire with the Confederates as they prepared for another attack.

Meanwhile, other companies of the 17th Missouri had heard firing from the base camp across the Little Red River and marched out to relieve the forage party. Confederate Major Rogers ordered his men to retreat to the southwest and most did, though the Arkansans and some Texans remained on the field and attacked the relief column before withdrawing. The 300 expected Confederate reinforcements arrived on the field just after the retreat had been sounded and joined in the withdrawal.

== Aftermath ==
The battle at Whitney&#x27;s Lane had lasted one hour and resulted in 51 Union men killed or wounded and approximately 10 Confederate casualties. The 17th Missouri Infantry lost only 68 men during the entire war; nearly one third of those were at Whitney&#x27;s Lane.

The battle was little more than a skirmish, but the psychological and strategic effects of the conflict were far more than was reflected by the number of casualties. For both Confederate soldiers and civilians in Arkansas, the battle provided a huge psychological lift at a critical time. Arkansas newspapers trumpeted the battle and praised its participants. These articles lifted the despair that had gripped the state and provided the Confederates with a new sense of optimism and hope.

Even though their losses were small compared to the size of their force, the results of the battle proved disheartening for the Union. Union troops were suffering from lack of supplies and some soldiers reportedly lost confidence in their officers. Within a few days, Confederate cavalry was harassing the Union supply line from the rear, making Union logistics problems even worse. Confederate theater commander Hindman also launched a clever disinformation campaign aimed at convincing the Union forces that new units were pouring into Little Rock from Texas.

By May 31, Curtis began to rethink his position in the face of the Confederate activity. On June 2, Curtis held a council of war, and the Federal commanders agreed to a retreat toward the Ozark foothills. By the end of June, Curtis had abandoned his campaign against Little Rock entirely and moved to Helena, Arkansas to establish a new supply line at the Mississippi River.

<doc id="311154" wikidata="Q1881035" url="?curid=311154" title="M62 motorway">
<text>The M62 is a west–east trans-Pennine motorway in Northern England, connecting Liverpool and Hull via Manchester, Bradford, Leeds and Wakefield; of the route is shared with the M60 orbital motorway around Manchester. The road is part of the unsigned Euroroutes E20 (Shannon to Saint Petersburg) and E22 (Holyhead to Ishim).

The motorway, which was first proposed in the 1930s, and conceived as two separate routes, was opened in stages between 1971 and 1976, with construction beginning at Pole Moor near Huddersfield and finishing at that time in Tarbock on the outskirts of Liverpool. The motorway absorbed the northern end of the Stretford-Eccles bypass, which was built between 1957 and 1960. 
Adjusted for inflation to 2007, its construction cost approximately £765 million. The motorway has an average daily traffic flow of 144,000 vehicles in West Yorkshire, and has several sections prone to traffic congestion, in particular, between Leeds and Huddersfield and the M60 section around Eccles. The M62 coach bombing of 1974 and the Great Heck rail crash of 2001 are the largest incidents to have occurred on the motorway.

Stott Hall Farm, situated between the carriageways on the Pennine section, has become one of the best-known sights on the motorway. The M62 has no junctions numbered 1, 2 or 3, or even an officially numbered 4, because it was intended to start in Liverpool proper, not in its outskirts.

Between Liverpool and Manchester, and east of Leeds, the terrain along which the road passes is relatively flat. Between Manchester and Leeds it traverses the Pennines and its foothills, rising to above sea level slightly east of junction 22 in Calderdale, not far from the boundary between Greater Manchester and West Yorkshire.

==Planning==
The motorway&#x27;s origins are found in the 1930s, when the need for a route between Lancashire and Yorkshire had been agreed after discussion by their county highway authorities. At the same time, it was envisaged that a route between Liverpool and Hull was needed to connect the ports to industrial Yorkshire.

After the Second World War, the Minister of Transport appointed engineers to inspect road standards between the A580 East Lancashire Road in Swinton and the A1 road near Selby. The 1949 Road Plan for South Lancashire identified the need to upgrade the A580 to dual carriageway with grade separation and provide bypasses at Huyton and Cadishead. In 1952, the route for a trans-Pennine motorway, the Lancashire–Yorkshire Motorway, was laid down, with Ferrybridge at the eastern terminus rather than Selby. By the 1960s, the proposed A580 upgrade to dual carriageway was considered inadequate, and there was an urgent need to link Liverpool to the motorway network.

The route of the Lancashire-Yorkshire motorway was considered inadequate as it failed to cater for several industrial towns in Yorkshire. When James Drake visited the United States in 1962, his experience of the Interstate Highway System led him to conclude that the Merseyside Expressway, planned to run between Liverpool and the M6, would need to be extended to the Stretford-Eccles Bypass and beyond, to create a continuous motorway between Liverpool and Ferrybridge (a link between Ferrybridge and Hull was not considered until 1964). Initially the plans were unpopular and not supported by the Ministry of Transport, but the scheme was added to the Road Plan in 1963.

===Surveying===
Formal planning began on Wednesday 12 July 1961, when Ernest Marples authorised the two surveyors of Lancashire and the West Riding - Sir James Drake of Lancashire and Stuart Maynard Lovell of the West Riding, to plan a motorway from Worsley, in Lancashire, to Ledsham (now the Selby Fork) in the West Riding. From either end, the plan was that there would be &#x27;improved roads&#x27; from the eastern end, at the Selby Fork, eastwards to Hull, and &#x27;improved roads&#x27; from the western end, at Worsley (now the Worsley Braided Interchange), westwards to Liverpool.

==Construction==

===Liverpool to Worsley===
It was the intention to build an urban motorway in Liverpool. The M62 was intended to terminate at Liverpool&#x27;s Inner Motorway, which was not built. The proposed route would have followed the railway into Liverpool as far as Edge Hill, with junctions at Rathbone Road and Durning Road where it would drop to two lanes before terminating at the Islington Radial. Difficulties arose building the Liverpool urban motorway resulting in delays, with the section between Tarbock and Liverpool the last to be completed in 1976. In total, two viaducts, ten bridges and seven underpasses were constructed to secure the structural integrity of the surrounding residential areas. The motorway was constructed only as far as the Queens Drive inner ring road, which is junction 4.

The section west of Manchester was intended to be a separate motorway, the M52 to link Liverpool and Salford, but a continuous motorway between Leeds and Liverpool was deemed more feasible, Construction between Liverpool and Manchester started in 1971, with the construction of a link between the M57 and M6 motorways. Simultaneously, a contract to link the M6 with Manchester was underway, which required land drainage and the removal of unsuitable earth. This section was completed in August 1974, creating a continuous link between Ferrybridge and Tarbock.

===Greater Manchester===

Two motorways were planned, the M52 from Liverpool to Salford and the M62 to link Pole Moor with the Stretford–Eccles Bypass. The first part of the M62 to be built was the Stretford–Eccles Bypass, which is now the section between Junctions 7 to 13 of the M60. Construction started in 1957, and the motorway opened in 1960. It was originally built as a two-lane motorway only. It was later re-numbered M63. The section of the planned M52 between the interchange with the Stretford-Eccles Bypass and Salford opened as the M602 motorway in 1971.

The Eccles–Pole Moor section of the M62 opened in 1971. Between Eccles and Pole Moor, 67 motorway crossings were required, including seven viaducts and eight junctions. Much of the Worsley Braided Interchange was built on undeveloped mossland where deep peat deposits had been covered with waste. Between Worsley and Milnrow, some underlying coal seams were still actively worked when the motorway was constructed and allowances had to be made to counteract possible future subsidence. The motorway crosses the Irwell Valley and the Pendleton Fault on a single-span bridge above the river.

===Milnrow to Outlane===

Surveying for the Pennine section began in November 1961 and its route was determined in July 1963. Construction between Windy Hill and Pole Moor was difficult through inhospitable hilly terrain, peat bog, and in undesirable weather conditions. The motorway&#x27;s highest point, above sea level at Windy Hill near Denshaw () is the highest point of any motorway in England.

A notable structure between junctions 21 and 22 on the uphill section towards Windy Hill is the Rakewood Viaduct which carries the road over the Longden End Brook.

The first section of the motorway in Yorkshire was completed between the county boundary at Windy Hill and Outlane in 1970.
To build this section, of material was moved, of which was solid rock and of peat which had to be cut from the rock strata and deposited on adjacent hillsides. The geology of the moors resulted in the engineers splitting the carriageways for in the middle of this section, sparing Stott Hall Farm from demolition. The farm, which was built in the 18th century, remains the only one situated in the middle of a UK motorway.
The motorway crosses Scammonden Dam on an embankment between junctions 22 and 23. Preparatory work in the Deanhead Valley began in August 1964 and the dam in 1966. The motorway&#x27;s opening on 20 December 1970 was dependent on completion of the dam. Two other notable constructions on the Pennine section are the pedestrian bridge carrying the Pennine Way, which is curved downwards with long cantilevers, and Scammonden Bridge, the longest single-span non-suspension bridge in the world when it was built. It carries a B road above the motorway. The section between Pole Moor and Outlane suffered fewer problems as the summer weather was satisfactory.

===Outlane to Lofthouse===
The section of the motorway between Gildersome and Lofthouse was built at the same time, resulting in the demolition of a significant proportion of the village of Tingley to build the eponymous interchange.

Lofthouse Interchange was built between 1965 and 1967. Owen Williams and the Babtie Group were the engineers. Located where the M62 crosses above the M1 motorway, it is a complex three-level junction with eight bridges including a roundabout supported by four long curved bridges on piers above both motorways. The roundabout&#x27;s north and south bridges have spans of and the east and west have spans of . The M62 overbridge has a reinforced concrete multi-cellular deck of four spans. Two other pre-stressed reinforced concrete bridges carry slip roads over Longthorpe Lane, the B6135. Another bridge with no motorway access carries Longthorpe Lane over the M1.

Two skew tunnels were constructed beneath the original junction between 1996 and 1999. The tunnels, constructed using the cut-and-cover method, are for traffic travelling between the M1 south-bound and the M62 west. The tunnel under the M62 is in length.

===East of Lofthouse===
Two contracts were awarded for the section between Lofthouse and Ferrybridge in 1972, and both were completed in 1974. On the first contract, care was needed at the River Calder crossing due to the alluvial bedrock. On the second contract precautions were taken as the length was built on old coal mine workings.

The section between Ferrybridge and North Cave was the last to be planned and built. The Ouse Bridge, across the River Ouse west of Goole, commenced in January 1973 and is nearly long and rises to above ground level. Completion of the bridge was delayed due to &quot;steel supplies [being] a chronic headache&quot; and a partial collapse of the framework caused by bolts joining a cross-beam to a trestle shearing. Problems with the bridge delayed the opening of the section east of Goole to May 1976.

==Development==
In 1987, the Department of Transport proposed a parallel relief road to combat congestion around Manchester. It would have been restricted to long-distance traffic, and the current route, part of the Manchester Outer Ring Road (later the M60), used for local traffic. The proposal suggested the closure of junction 13. The proposal was designated a &quot;long term&quot; improvement in 1994, and cancelled on 23 November 1995.

In 1998, the section between Eccles Interchange and Simister Interchange (junctions 12 to 18) was designated the M60. Since then, two junctions were opened—in December 2002, the missing junction 8 was opened to allow access to the A574 and the Omega Development Site, while in January 2006, junction 32a was opened to link to the upgraded A1(M). The UK&#x27;s first motorway high-occupancy vehicle lane was opened at junction 26 in 2008 for eastbound traffic from the M606 with more than one occupant.

===Smart motorway===
Pre-2009 proposals to widen the motorway between junctions 25 and 28 to four lanes were withdrawn in January 2009 and replaced by a project to install hard shoulder running and a smart motorway system between junctions 25 and 30. Work started in 2014 to install the system around the M62 – M60 section.

==Traffic==

The section between junctions 18 (with the M60) and 29 (with the M1) through Greater Manchester and West Yorkshire has been identified as one of the most congested roads in Britain. The motorway provides a direct link between three of the five largest metro areas in England, and is the most practical route for HGVs and other commercial traffic between Manchester and Leeds. There are a significant number of warehouses in these urban areas, which require commercial delivery to the ports at Merseyside and around the Humber, all of which are transported via the M62.

Annual average daily traffic flows of 100,000 cars were recorded east of the Pennines (junction 22) in 2006 and 78,000 cars west of the Pennines. The figures were increases from 90,000 and 70,000 respectively in 1999. By way of comparison, the UK&#x27;s busiest motorway, the M25 carried 144,000 cars between junctions 7 and 23 in 2006.

==Major incidents==
On 4 February 1974, a bomb was detonated on a coach travelling between Chain Bar (junction 26) and Gildersome (junction 27). The coach was transporting off-duty army personnel and their family members. Twelve people were killed and 38 were injured. Hartshead Moor services was used as a makeshift hospital and base for investigations. The Provisional Irish Republican Army was deemed responsible. A memorial to the victims was erected at Hartshead Moor services in 2009.

The Selby rail crash happened on 28 February 2001, at 06:13 after Gary Hart, a sleep-deprived driver, swerved off the M62 onto the East Coast Main Line near Selby. While he was calling the emergency services, a GNER southbound train collided with his Land Rover and derailed into the path of an oncoming freight train. Ten people were killed, including the drivers of both trains, and 82 others were injured. Hart was later convicted of ten counts of causing death by dangerous driving, and was sentenced to five years in prison.

On 1 March 2018, a Highways England car fire in severe weather conditions (the beast from the East) caused up to 3,500 vehicles to become trapped on the eastbound Pennine section between junctions 20 and 24. Up to 200 people spent the night in their vehicles. The military, mountain rescue, fire services and Highways England worked alongside the police through the night to ensure people&#x27;s safety. Members of the public who lived in Milnrow and Newhey climbed up onto the motorway with food and drinks for the trapped people in their cars and trucks. A barrier between the carriageways was removed to facilitate moving most of the vehicles. The road remained closed the next day due to the weather conditions.

==Route==
In addition to passing Warrington, Manchester, Huddersfield, Halifax, Bradford, Leeds and Wakefield, the towns of Huyton, St Helens, Widnes, Bury, Rochdale, Oldham, Pontefract, Selby and Goole are designated primary destinations along the road. Many of the professional and semi-professional teams playing rugby league in England are connected by the M62 motorway and so the term &quot;M62 corridor&quot; is sometimes used to refer to the area where rugby league is most popular. The motorway was depicted in a BBC trailer for the 2021 Rugby League World Cup in England. 

The M62 is a terminus to two motorways: the M57 near Prescot and the M18 near Rawcliffe; and has four spur routes: the M602, which serves Manchester, the A627(M), which serves Oldham and Rochdale, the M606, which serves Bradford, and the M621, which serves Leeds.

Despite Hull being listed as a primary destination, the motorway downgrades near North Cave, to the west.

The western end of the motorway is at Queen&#x27;s Drive, on Liverpool&#x27;s middle ring road from where it runs eastward to the outer ring road, the M57. The route has four exits for Warrington: junction 7, an interchange with the A57 road, junction 8, which also houses IKEA, junction 9, which interchanges with the A49 road, which was intended to be a motorway, and junction 11. Between these is junction 10, which is a cloverstack interchange with the M6. The M62 crosses Chat Moss before interchanging with the M60 motorway. Owing to the original plan to extend this section of the motorway into Manchester, motorists must turn off to stay on (a TOTSO) the route into Yorkshire.

In Greater Manchester, the motorway shares seven junctions, 12 to 18, with the M60 motorway. Junction 13, signposted Leigh, is situated from junction 12, leaving exiting motorists the hazard of crossing the still-merging M62 traffic.
Worsley Braided Interchange serves Junctions 14 and 15 and Junctions 1 to 3 of the M61 which terminates to Preston.

Between junction 21 and junction 22, the motorway has four lanes eastbound to climb Windy Hill, before crossing the border into Yorkshire and interchanging with the rural A672 road, reaching the highest point of any motorway in England . There is then a travel through the Pennines to the next junction, passing Scammonden Reservoir and Stott Hall Farm. The next junction is 23, which is accessible only for westbound traffic. After this, the road dips through a valley to junction 24 and drops slowly before interchanging with the A644 road at junction 25. Between junctions 22 and 25, the road is used as a border between the metropolitan boroughs of Calderdale and Kirklees.

At junction 26, Chain Bar, the motorway interchanges with several roads: the M606, a spur into Bradford, the A58 road, which runs between Prescot and Wetherby, and the A638 road, which runs to Doncaster, then follows the old route of the A1 through Bawtry and Retford, to Markham Moor where it rejoins the A1. The next junction also serves a spur route: the M621 motorway, before bypassing Leeds to the south to the interchange with the M1 motorway, Lofthouse Interchange, at junction 29. East of Leeds, the motorway serves Wakefield at junction 30 and crosses by the River Calder. At junction 32a, the road is crossed by the A1(M) motorway, which also runs parallel to it for a short distance. The next junction 33 serves the A162 and A1 roads, and Ferrybridge service station. After Ferrybridge, the motorway becomes relatively flat. At junction 35, the motorway meets with the northern terminus of the M18 at a triangle (semi-directioinal-T) interchange. Soon after, there is a bridge that crosses the River Ouse. For approximately after this, the road runs towards Hull, serving Howden and North Cave, before downgrading to the A63 road.

<doc id="311160" wikidata="Q541010" url="?curid=311160" title="World Jewish Congress">
<text>The World Jewish Congress (WJC) is an international federation of Jewish communities and organizations, founded in Geneva, Switzerland in August 1936. According to its mission statement, the World Jewish Congress&#x27;s main purpose is to act as &quot;the diplomatic arm of the Jewish people&quot;. Membership in the WJC is open to all representative Jewish groups or communities, irrespective of the social, political or economic ideology of the community&#x27;s host country. The World Jewish Congress headquarters are in New York City, and the organization maintains international offices in Brussels, Belgium; Jerusalem; Paris, France; Moscow, Russia; Buenos Aires, Argentina; and Geneva, Switzerland. The WJC has special consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council.

==History==
The World Jewish Congress was established in Geneva, Switzerland in August, 1936, in reaction to the rise of Nazism and the growing wave of European anti-Semitism. Since its foundation, it has been a permanent body with offices around the world. The main aims of the organization were &quot;to mobilize the Jewish people and the democratic forces against the Nazi onslaught&quot;, to &quot;fight for equal political and economic rights everywhere, and particularly for the Jewish minorities in Central and Eastern Europe&quot;, to support the establishment of a &quot;Jewish National Home in Palestine&quot; and to create &quot;a worldwide Jewish representative body based on the concept of the unity of the Jewish people, democratically organized and able to act on matters of common concern&quot;.

===Precursor organizations (1917–1936)===
The WJC&#x27;s precursor organizations were the American Jewish Congress and the &quot;Comité des Délégations Juives&quot; (Committee of Jewish Delegations). The latter was established in March 1919 to represent Jewish communities at the Paris Peace Conference, and advocated for Jewish minority rights in various countries, including the negotiation of rights for Jews in Turkey in the Treaty of Sèvres (1920) and special agreements with smaller eastern European states. Headed by Russian Zionist Leo Motzkin, the &quot;Comité des Délégations Juives&quot; was composed of delegations from Palestine, the United States, Canada, Russia, Ukraine, Poland, East Galicia, Romania, Transylvania, Bukovina, Czechoslovakia, Italy, Yugoslavia, and Greece, and funded mainly by the World Zionist Organization.

However, the first impetus for the creation of the WJC came from the American Jewish Congress. In December 1917, the AJC adopted a resolution calling for the &quot;convening of a World Jewish Congress&quot;, &quot;as soon as peace is declared among the warring nations&quot; in Europe. In 1923, Motzkin visited the United States and addressed the AJC Executive Committee, &quot;pleading for a World Conference of Jews to discuss the conditions of Jews in various lands and to devise ways and means for effective protection of Jewish rights&quot;. Conferences co-organized by Motzkin and the AJC leaders Julian Mack and Stephen Wise took place in 1926 in London and in 1927 in Zurich, Switzerland. The latter was attended by 65 Jews from 13 countries, representing 43 Jewish organizations, though the main Jewish groups in Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands, as well as the American Jewish Committee, declined the invitation to attend.

The First Preparatory World Jewish Conference was held in Geneva in August 1932. A preparatory committee was headed by Zionist Nahum Goldmann, who was one of the leading advocates of the establishment of an international Jewish representative body. Goldmann defined the purpose of the World Jewish Congress as follows:

It is to establish the permanent address of the Jewish people; amidst the fragmentation and atomization of Jewish life and of the Jewish community; it is to establish a real, legitimate, collective representation of Jewry which will be entitled to speak in the name of the 16 million Jews to the nations and governments of the world, as well as to the Jews themselves.

The conference approved plans to set up the new organization in 1934, with headquarters in New York and European offices in Berlin, Germany. In a manifesto, delegates called upon the Jewish people to unite as the only effective means of averting danger. The Jews, the declaration said, had to rely on their own power with the assistance of such enlightened sections of the world which had not yet been saturated with poisonous anti-Semitism. It added: &quot;The World Jewish Congress does not aim at weakening any existing organizations, but rather to support and stimulate them.&quot; The new organization would be based on the &quot;concept of the Jewish people as a national entity, and authorized and obligated to deal with all problems affecting Jewish life&quot;.

In the summer of 1933, following the rise to power of Adolf Hitler and his NSDAP in Germany, American Jewish Congress President Bernard Deutsch called on US Jewish organizations to support the establishment of a World Jewish Congress &quot;to prove the sincerity of their stand&quot; in favor of the embattled Jews of Germany.

===Foundation (1936)===
After two more preparatory conferences in 1933 and 1934, the First Plenary Assembly, held in Geneva in August 1936, established the World Jewish Congress as a permanent and democratic organization. Elections for delegates to that assembly had to be according to democratic principles, namely secret, direct, and based on proportional representation. The 52 American delegates, for instance, were chosen at an Electoral Convention which met in Washington, DC, on 13/14 June 1936 and which was attended by 1,000 representatives from 99 communities in 32 US states.

The World Jewish Congress&#x27;s expressed goal was Jewish unity and the strengthening of Jewish political influence to assure the survival of the Jewish people and promote the establishment of a Jewish state. 230 delegates representing 32 countries gathered for the first WJC assembly. Addressing a press conference in Geneva, Stephen S. Wise assailed German Jews for opposing the WJC. He said: &quot;I must make clear that the congress is not a parliament nor an attempt at a parliament. It is nothing more than an assembly of representatives of those Jewries which choose to associate themselves in defense of Jewish rights. The congress will not be wholly representative until all Jews choose to be represented by it.&quot;
Although the delegates elected the US federal judge and erstwhile president of the American Jewish Congress Julian Mack as honorary president of the WJC, Wise was appointed as chairman of the WJC Executive and thus &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the congress. Nahum Goldmann was named chair of the Administrative Committee. The WJC Executive immediately drew up a declaration urging the British government not to halt immigration to Palestine which was presented to British diplomats in Bern, Switzerland.

The WJC chose Paris as its headquarters with a liaison office to the League of Nations in Geneva, first headed by the Swiss international lawyer and WJC Legal Advisor Paul Guggenheim and later by Gerhart Riegner, who initially served as Guggenheim&#x27;s secretary.

In its fight against growing anti-Semitism in Europe, the WJC pursued a two-pronged approach: the political and legal sphere (mainly lobbying of the League of Nations and public statements) and organizing a boycott of products from Nazi Germany. Given the weakness of the League of Nations vis-à-vis Germany and the successful efforts by the Nazi regime to stave off an economic boycott, neither approach proved very effective.

Following the November 1938 Kristallnacht pogroms against Jews in Germany in which at least 91 Jews were killed and many synagogues and Jewish shops were destroyed, the WJC issued a statement: &quot;Though the Congress deplores the fatal shooting of an official of the German Embassy in Paris by a young Polish Jew of seventeen, it is obliged to protest energetically against the violent attacks in the German press against the whole of Judaism because of this act and, especially, to protest against the reprisals taken against the German Jews after the crime.&quot;

With the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, the WJC moved to Geneva to facilitate communications with Jewish communities in Europe. In the summer of 1940, by which time most of Europe had fallen under Nazi occupation, the headquarters were moved to New York to share office space with the American Jewish Congress, and a special WJC office was set up in London. The British Section of the WJC was tasked with acting as the European representative of the organization.

Some of the personnel who worked in the WJC&#x27;s European offices immigrated to the United States when the WJC moved its headquarters there. At the New York office in the 1940s, the major departments were: Political Department, Institute of Jewish Affairs (research and legal work), Relief and Rescue, Department for Culture and Education (or Culture Department), and Organization Department. In 1940, the WJC opened a representative office in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

===The Holocaust and its aftermath===
The WJC&#x27;s initial priorities included safeguarding Jewish minority rights, combating anti-Semitism in Europe, and providing emergency relief to Jews fleeing Nazi persecution. The WJC also concentrated on security for Jewish refugees and victims of the war. In 1939, the World Jewish Congress set up a relief committee for Jewish war refugees (RELICO) and cooperated with the International Committee of the Red Cross to protect Jews in Nazi-occupied countries.

 Under the auspices of the WJC, 18 committees were set up in the United States composed of exiled representatives of the different European Jewish communities under Nazi rule. The committees were modeled on the governments-in-exile, and their task was to provide moral and material support for Jews in the respective countries, and to prepare a program of Jewish postwar demands. All representative committees together formed the Advisory Council on European Jewish Affairs, which came into being at a conference in New York City in June 1942.

The WJC also lobbied Allied governments on behalf of Jewish refugees, and urged US Jewish organizations to work towards waiving immigration quotas for Jewish refugees fleeing Nazi persecution. In 1940, General Charles de Gaulle, the leader of the French government in exile, pledged to the WJC that all measures taken by the Vichy regime against the Jews would be repudiated upon France&#x27;s liberation.

In late 1941 and early 1942, Western diplomats and journalists received scattered information about Nazi massacres of many thousands of Jews in German-occupied Poland and Russia. However, the news was difficult to confirm. In June 1942, Ignacy Schwarzbart, one of two Jewish representatives on the Polish National Council of the Polish government-in-exile, held a press conference with WJC officials in London, where it was stated that an estimated one million Jews had already been murdered by the Germans.

====Riegner Telegram====
On 8 August 1942, the WJC&#x27;s Geneva representative Gerhart Riegner sent a telegram to the US vice-consul in Geneva in which he informed the Allies for the first time about the Nazis&#x27; planned Final Solution to exterminate all Jews in the German-occupied territories. Riegner had received his information from the German industrialist Eduard Schulte.

His telegram read as follows:

Received alarming report about plan being discussed and considered in &quot;Führer&quot; headquarters to exterminate at one fell swoop all Jews in German-controlled countries comprising three and a half to four million after deportation and concentration in the east thus solving Jewish question once and for all stop campaign planned for autumn methods being discussed including hydrocyanic acid stop
It was only several weeks later, on 28 August 1942, that WJC President Stephen S. Wise received Riegner&#x27;s alarming message. The telegram was met with disbelief despite preexisting evidence for mass executions. The US State Department considered it &quot;a wild rumor, fueled by Jewish anxieties&quot;, while the British Foreign Office refused to forward the telegram for the time being and called for the allegations to be investigated first. It was only on 25 November 1942 that the WJC was allowed to release the news to the world.

On 28 July 1942, 20,000 people participated in a WJC-organized &quot;Stop Hitler Now&quot; demonstration at New York&#x27;s Madison Square Garden. Nine months later, on 1 March 1943, an estimated 22,000 people crowded into the same hall and a further 15,000 stood outside at a WJC rally addressed by Wise, Chaim Weizmann, New York Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia and others. However, the US government did not heed calls to rescue European Jews. Early in 1944, US Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau stated in front of President Roosevelt that &quot;certain officials in our State Department&quot; had failed while it would have been commanded by duty to &quot;prevent the extermination of the Jews in German-controlled Europe&quot;.

====Rescue efforts====
Throughout the war, the WJC lobbied the Allied governments to grant visas to Jewish refugees from Europe and to ensure the restoration of Jewish minority rights in areas liberated by the Allied forces. Despite the US State Department&#x27;s opposition, the WJC obtained permission from the US Treasury Department, headed by Henry Morgenthau, to transmit funds to Europe for the rescue and assistance of persecuted Jews. According to a report by Riegner, these funds helped to bring 1,350 Jewish children from the occupied countries to Switzerland and 70 to Spain.

However, at the Bermuda Refugee Conference in 1943, both the United States and Britain refused to relax their immigration policies, not even for British Mandatory Palestine. In reaction, the WJC published a comment which said: &quot;The truth is that what stands in the way of aid to the Jews in Europe by the United Nations is not that such a program is dangerous, but simple lack of will to go to any trouble on their behalf.&quot; Only in January 1944, President Franklin D. Roosevelt ordered the setting up of the War Refugee Board, whose purpose was to &quot;rescue victims of enemy oppression who are in imminent danger of death&quot;.

The World Jewish Congress also tried – mostly in vain – to convince the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to assert its authority more forcefully vis-à-vis the Germans, and urged it to secure the status of civilian prisoners of war under the Third Geneva Convention on prisoners of war for those Jews that were confined to ghettos and Nazi concentration camps, which would have entitled the ICRC to provide care to them. However, the ICRC stuck to the view that it was &quot;in no position to bring pressure to bear upon governments&quot;, and that the success of its work &quot;depended on discreet and friendly successions&quot;.

The Holocaust era president of WJC, Stephen Wise, used his great influence with Jewish communities nationwide to energetically obstruct the Bergson Group&#x27;s strategical level rescue activism. Later president of the WJC Nachum Goldman told the State Department (per department protocol) that Hillel Kook (aka Peter Bergson) is an adventurer and does not represent &quot;organized Jewry&quot;. He pleaded to either deport or draft Hillel Kook in order to stop his activism, which organized Jewry strongly opposed. Eleanor Roosevelt, many from Hollywood and Broadway and many in Congress supported the Bergson Group, including Senator Harry Truman for a while.

====Letter to State Department====
On 9 August 1944, Leon Kubowitzki (later Aryeh Leon Kubovy), the head of the WJC&#x27;s Rescue Department, relayed a message from Ernest Frischer of the Czechoslovak State Council to the US State Department urging the destruction of the gas chambers and the bombing of railways lines leading to the Auschwitz death camp. US Undersecretary of War John J. McCloy rejected the suggestion five days later, writing to Kubowitzki:

After a study it became apparent that such an operation could be executed only by the diversion of considerable air support essential to the success of our forces now engaged in decisive operations elsewhere and would in any case be of such doubtful efficacy that it would not warrant the use of our resources.

In November 1944, at the War Emergency Conference held in Atlantic City, USA, the WJC elaborated a program for the post-war period, which included calls for reparations from Germany to Jews and the use of heirless Jewish property for Jewish rehabilitation. Also at that conference, Stephen S. Wise was elected president of the World Jewish Congress. Delegates decided to embark on a $10,000,000 fund-raising effort for relief and increased political activity throughout the world. The news agency JTA also reported the following:

The closing session of the conference also adopted a resolution recommending that the Congress establish a Department of Community Service which would be charged with aiding in the reconstruction of the spiritual and cultural life of Jews in liberated countries. Another resolution extended the gratitude of the gathering to the Vatican and to the Governments of Spain, Sweden and Switzerland for the protection they offered under difficult conditions to the persecuted Jews in German-dominated Europe. At the same time, it expressed regret at the fact that &#x27;deplorably little has been done to have Axis civilians under the power of the United Nations exchanged for Jews in ghettos, internment, concentration and labor camps.&#x27;

====Meeting with Heinrich Himmler====
In February 1945, the head of the Swedish office of the WJC, Hilel Storch, established contact through an intermediary with SS chief Heinrich Himmler. In April, Norbert Masur of the Swedish Section of the WJC secretly met with Himmler at Harzfeld, around 70 kilometers north of Berlin. Masur had been promised safe conduct by Himmler. Through negotiations with the Nazi leader and the subsequent talks with the head of the Swedish Red Cross, Folke Bernadotte, the WJC was allowed to save 4,500 inmates from the women&#x27;s concentration camp at Ravensbrück. Approximately half of these women, who had been deported to Germany from over forty countries, were Jewish.

====Post-war efforts====
At the end of the war, the WJC undertook efforts to rebuild Jewish communities in Europe, pushed for indemnification and reparation claims against Germany, provided assistance to displaced persons and survivors of the Holocaust, and advocated for the punishment of Nazi leaders for war crimes and crimes against humanity. The World Jewish Congress notably took part in the formulation of the principles governing the Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal and furnished evidence against Nazi leaders to the US prosecutors.
On 19 August 1945, a conference of representatives of European Jews was organized in Paris, France by the WJC, whose leadership (Wise, Goldmann, Kubowitzki) traveled there from the US. Delegates from Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, Sweden and Switzerland attended the gathering.

On 21 September 1945, Pope Pius XII received WJC Secretary General Leon Kubowitzki in audience, who recounted to the pope the &quot;great losses&quot; suffered by the Jews during the war and expressed gratitude for what the church had done to help &quot;our persecuted people&quot;. Kubowitzki suggested a papal encyclical on the Catholic Church&#x27;s attitude toward the Jews and a condemnation of anti-Semitism. &quot;We will consider it,&quot; Pius XII reportedly replied, adding: &quot;certainly, most favorably, with all our love&quot;. The WJC also urged the Vatican to assist in the recovery of Jewish children saved by Catholics during the Holocaust.

The WJC also supported the foundation of the United Nations Organization in 1945. In 1947, the organization became one of the first NGOs to be granted consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC).

In 1947, an estimated 30,000 people attended the opening of the Latin American Conference of the World Jewish Congress at Luna Park, Buenos Aires, Argentina.

===Creation of the State of Israel===
Although its principal purpose was to defend the rights of Jews in the Diaspora, the WJC always actively supported the aims of Zionism, i.e. creation of a Jewish National Home in British Mandatory Palestine. The Yishuv, the Jewish community in British Mandatory Palestine, was represented at the First Plenary Assembly of the WJC in 1936, which affirmed in a resolution &quot;the determination of the Jewish people to live in peaceful cooperation with their Arab neighbors on the basis of mutual respect for the rights of each&quot;.

In 1946, in a memorandum to the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry on Palestine drafted by WJC Political Secretary Alexander L. Easterman, the WJC declared that &quot;the only hope of reviving the life and culture of the Jewish people lies in the establishment of a fully self-governing Jewish Homeland, recognised as such throughout the world; that is, a Jewish Commonwealth in Palestine.&quot;

WJC officials lobbied UN member states in favor of the adoption of UN General Assembly Resolution 181 of 1947, which called for the creation of a Jewish and an Arab state in Palestine. On 15 May 1948, the day of Israel&#x27;s proclamation of independence, the WJC Executive pledged &quot;world Jewry&#x27;s solidarity&quot; with the fledgling Jewish state. In Montreux, Switzerland, delegates from 34 countries attended the Second Plenary Assembly of the World Jewish Congress, held from 27 June to 6 July 1948.

===Negotiations with Germany on reparations and compensation===
In 1949, the World Jewish Congress called on the newly established Federal Republic of Germany to acknowledge responsibility and liability of the German people for the wrongs inflicted on the Jewish people by the Nazi regime. In 1950, the WJC opened an office in Frankfurt to function as a &quot;listening post&quot; on developments in Germany. In representations to the United States, Britain and France, the WJC detailed Jewish moral and material claims on Germany. In 1951, Nahum Goldmann, at the request of the Israeli government, established the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany (Claims Conference).

The same year, in a declaration approved by the parliament, West German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer recognized Germany&#x27;s duty to make moral and material restitution to the Jewish people and signaled its readiness to engage in negotiations with Jewish representatives and the State of Israel. &quot;Unspeakable crimes have been committed in the name of the German people, calling for moral and material indemnity [ ... ] The Federal Government are prepared, jointly with representatives of Jewry and the State of Israel [ ... ] to bring about a solution of the material indemnity problem, thus easing the way to the spiritual settlement of infinite suffering,&quot; Adenauer said.

On 10 September 1952, WJC and Claims Conference head Nahum Goldmann and the West German federal government signed an agreement embodied in two protocols. Protocol No. 1 called for the enactment of laws that would compensate Nazi victims directly for indemnification and restitution claims arising from Nazi persecution. Under Protocol No. 2, the West German government provided the Claims Conference with 450 million deutschmarks for the relief, rehabilitation and resettlement of Jewish victims of Nazi persecution. Similar agreements were also signed with the State of Israel.

Subsequent to these agreements, the Claims Conference continued to negotiate with the German government for amendments to the various legislative commitments and monitored the implementation of the various compensation and restitution laws. According to the Claims Conference, more than 278,000 Jewish Holocaust survivors received lifetime pensions under the German Federal Indemnification Laws. Germany expended a total of US$60 billion in satisfaction of Jewish claims.

In 1952, the World Jewish Congress called on the Austrian government to intensify efforts for the restitution of heirless Jewish property. Austrian Chancellor Leopold Figl subsequently pledged to remedy Jewish grievances.

At the Third Plenary Assembly in Geneva (4 to 11 August 1953), Nahum Goldmann was elected president of the World Jewish Congress, having previously served as acting president.

===Zionism and Jewish rights in the Soviet Union===

Although the Soviet Union initially supported the creation of the State of Israel, during the 1950s the Jewish state emerged as part of the Western camp, and Zionism raised fears of internal dissent and opposition among the Communist leadership.

During the later part of the Cold War, Soviet Jews were suspected of being traitors, Western sympathizers, or security liabilities. The Communist leadership closed down various Jewish organizations and declared Zionism an ideological enemy. Synagogues were often placed under police surveillance, both openly and through the use of informers. As a result of the persecution, both state-sponsored and unofficial, anti-Semitism became deeply ingrained in the society and remained a fact for years. The Soviet media, when depicting political events, sometimes used the term &#x27;fascism&#x27; to characterize Israeli nationalism. Jews often suffered hardships, epitomized by often not being allowed to enlist in universities, work in certain professions, or participate in government. Many Jews felt compelled to hide their identities by changing their names.
In 1953, the World Jewish Congress condemned the indictment in Moscow of Jewish doctors as alleged conspirators against the Soviet Union leadership, the so-called Doctors&#x27; plot, and called a leadership meeting in Zurich, Switzerland, which was canceled at the last minute due to the death of Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin. The new Soviet leadership declared that the case against the doctors had been fabricated.

In 1956, WJC leaders delivered a memorandum to Soviet leaders Nikolai Bulganin and Nikita Khrushchev during their visit to London, and a year later the World Jewish Congress Executive launched a worldwide call to attention regarding the plight of Jews in the Soviet Union and other Communist countries. This resulted in a growing international campaign for their cultural and religious rights and for the reunion of families separated by the Cold War. After a lapse of seven years, the organization also re-established contact with several Jewish communities in Communist Eastern Europe. In 1957, the Jewish community of Hungary re-affiliated with the WJC.

In 1960, the WJC convoked the International Conference on Soviet Jewry in Paris, which was chaired by Goldmann. In 1971, the WJC co-sponsored the First World Conference of Jewish Communities on Soviet Jewry in Brussels, Belgium. Successor events were held in Brussels and Zurich in 1976.

At the second Brussels conference, Jewish leaders called on the Soviet Union to implement the Declaration of Helsinki on human rights, respect its own constitution and laws and &quot;recognize and respect the right of Jews in the USSR to be united with their brethren in the Land of Israel, the Jewish historic homeland&quot;. Under the motto, &#x27;Let my people go!, the Soviet Jewry movement caught the attention of statesmen and public figures throughout the West, who considered the Soviet Union&#x27;s policy toward Jews to be in violation of basic human and civil rights such as freedom of immigration, freedom of religion, and the freedom to study one&#x27;s own language, culture and heritage. &quot;You have no choice but to release Soviet Jewry,&quot; US President Ronald Reagan told Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev during the latter&#x27;s first state visit to the US in 1987.

On 25 March 1987, WJC leaders Edgar M. Bronfman, Israel Singer, Sol Kanee and Elan Steinberg, as well as the head of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, Morris B. Abram, arrived in Moscow to discuss the matter with Soviet government ministers, though officials swiftly denied that the USSR had agreed to an increase in Jewish emigration and had invited an Israeli delegation to visit Moscow. Nonetheless, the visits by WJC officials to Moscow were widely seen as helpful in securing the exit permits for prominent Jews in the Soviet Union.

In 1989, Soviet Jewish organizations were granted permission by the authorities to join the World Jewish Congress, and two years later in Jerusalem, several directly elected delegates from the Soviet Union were officially represented for the first time at a World Jewish Congress Plenary Assembly.

===North Africa and the Middle East===
In the aftermath of World War II and the establishment of the State of Israel, the World Jewish Congress was actively involved in assisting Jews in Arab and other Muslim countries, who had come under increasing pressure. In January 1948, WJC President Stephen Wise, appealed to US Secretary of State George Marshall: &quot;Between 800,000 and a million Jews in the Middle East and North Africa, exclusive of Palestine, are in &#x27;the greatest danger of destruction&#x27; at the hands of Muslims being incited to holy war over the Partition of Palestine ... Acts of violence already perpetrated, together with those contemplated, being clearly aimed at the total destruction of the Jews, constitute genocide, which under the resolutions of the General Assembly is a crime against humanity.&quot; The United States, however, did not take any follow-up action to investigate these pleadings.

The WJC also submitted a memorandum on the problem to the UN Economic and Social Council, asking for urgent action. The memorandum in particular mentioned an Arab League document which planned to strip Jewish citizens of their rights and belongings as part of a calculated plan. However, when the WJC brought the Arab League document before the ECOSOC, its president Charles H. Malik, a representative of Lebanon to the UN, refused to bring it to the floor.

During the 1950s, the WJC conducted negotiations with a number of Arab governments, notably in North Africa, and pleaded with them to allow their Jewish populations to leave their native countries. With the advance of Arab nationalism, especially during the 1950s, these efforts were increasingly complicated. In 1954, a WJC delegation visited Morocco, then still under French colonial rule.

The WJC leadership also kept in close touch with the leaders of the Moroccan independence movement, including the exiled sultan of Morocco, Mohammed V, who insisted that an autonomous Morocco would guarantee the freedom and equality of all its citizens, including access of non-Muslims to public administration. When Morocco became independent from France in 1956, WJC Political Director Alex Easterman immediately began negotiations with Prime Minister Mbarek Bekkay and other government officials, pressing them to grant Jews the right to leave.

Whilst in 1957 an agreement was reached to allow for the emigration of all 8,000 Jews from Mazagan that were held in a refugee camp near Casablanca, a 1959 WJC report concluded that in spite of repeated assurances by the new government that Jewish rights would be safeguarded, &quot;internal political conflicts have obstructed a solution&quot; to the problem that Moroccan Jews willing to leave the country were denied passports by the authorities. In 1959, Morocco became a member of the Arab League, and all communications with Israel were stopped. However, both King Mohammed V and his successor, Hassan II of Morocco continued to emphasize that Jews enjoyed equal rights in their country.

===Cold War activities===
Delegates from 43 countries attended the Fourth WJC Plenary Assembly held in Stockholm in 1959.

In 1960, the WJC convoked a special conference in Brussels following a series of anti-Semitic incidents in Europe.
In 1966, the speaker of the West German parliament, Eugen Gerstenmaier, delivered an address titled, &#x27;Germans and Jews – A Problem Unresolved&#x27; to the Fifth Plenary Assembly in Brussels, Belgium, becoming the first senior German politician to address a WJC conference, which caused some controversy within the WJC. Some delegates from Israel boycotted the session with Gerstenmaier in protest.

In 1963, the American Section of the WJC was set up to broaden the organization&#x27;s constituency in the country with the biggest Jewish community worldwide. In 1974, the Board of Deputies of British Jews affiliated with the World Jewish Congress. The British Section of the WJC, which had previously represented UK Jewry, was dissolved.

To emphasize its solidarity with the State of Israel, the WJC held its Sixth Plenary Assembly in 1975 for the first time in Jerusalem, and with one exception, all plenary assemblies have since been held there. The delegates also adopted new statutes and a new structure for the organization, and the WJC entered into a cooperation agreement with the World Zionist Organization.

====Opposition to UN resolution condemning Zionism as racism====
The World Jewish Congress was vocal in efforts to repeal United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3379, which was adopted on November 10, 1975, and held &quot;that Zionism is a form of racism and racial discrimination&quot;.

The WJC Executive characterized the resolution as an &quot;attempt to defame Zionism by equating it with imperialism, colonialism, racism, and apartheid, ... amounting to incitement to racism and racial hatred&quot;. All communities and organizations affiliated to the Congress were urged to take immediate action to mobilize public opinion against the resolution. Israel made revocation of Resolution 3379 a condition of its participation in the Madrid Peace Conference of 1991. Resolution 3379 was revoked in 1991 by UN General Assembly Resolution 4686.

During the 1960s and 1970s, the WJC also campaigned for an end to the Arab boycott of Israel.

====Leadership changes====
At the WJC Plenary in 1975, longtime WJC leader Nahum Goldmann (then 80) stood again for WJC president. Several Israeli delegates, notably from the Herut movement, but also former Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir, opposed Goldmann&#x27;s re-election for his criticism of Israel&#x27;s policies, notably with respect to the peace process.

Two years later, in 1977, the American real estate developer and erstwhile president of B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith International Philip Klutznick succeeded Goldmann as WJC president. In 1979, when Klutznick was named US secretary of commerce by President Jimmy Carter, the Canadian-American businessman Edgar Bronfman Sr. took over as acting head of the organization. Bronfman was formally elected WJC president by the Seventh Plenary Assembly, held in Jerusalem in January 1981.

=====Edgar M. Bronfman=====
Under the leadership of Bronfman, the new Secretary General Israel Singer (who took over from Gerhart Riegner in 1983), and Executive Director Elan Steinberg, the WJC adopted a more aggressive style. Steinberg characterized the change as follows: &quot;For a long time, the World Jewish Congress was meant to be the greatest secret of Jewish life, because the nature of diplomacy after the war was quiet diplomacy. This is a newer, American-style leadership — less timid, more forceful, unashamedly Jewish.&quot; 
Bronfman led the World Jewish Congress in becoming the preeminent Jewish organization. He broadened its organizational base by bringing in new member communities in Europe. Through campaigns to free Soviet Jewry, the exposure of the Nazi past of Austrian President Kurt Waldheim, and the campaign to compensate victims of the Holocaust, Bronfman became well known internationally in the 1980s and 1990s.

On 25 June 1982, WJC President Edgar Bronfman became the first leader ever of a Jewish organization to address the United Nations General Assembly.

====Controversy over Catholic convent&#x27;s presence at Auschwitz====
In 1985, Carmelite nuns opened a convent near the site of the former Nazi death camp Auschwitz I. WJC President Edgar Bronfman called for the removal of the convent. In public statements, other Jewish leaders, including former WJC Secretary General Gerhart Riegner, also called for the removal. A year later, the Catholic Church agreed to those requests and said the convent would be removed within two years.

However, the Carmelites stayed put, and a year later erected a large cross from a 1979 mass with the Pope near their site. The World Jewish Congress Executive strongly urged the Vatican to take action against the convent&#x27;s presence and said Pope John Paul II should &quot;exercise his authority&quot; to order the prompt removal of convent and cross. The WJC Executive said the pontiff&#x27;s action was necessary to implement the agreement major European Catholic cardinals, including the cardinal of Kraków, Franciszek Macharski, had signed with Jewish leaders on 22 February 1987 in Geneva. Edgar Bronfman declared: &quot;It is not only a matter of the Auschwitz convent, but the broader implications of historical revisionism in which the uniqueness of the Holocaust and the murder of the Jewish people is being suppressed.&quot;

A few months later, the Carmelites were ordered by Rome to move. The WJC praised the Vatican for taking action, although the nuns remained on the site until 1993, leaving the large cross behind.

====Diplomatic contacts with Communist countries====
During the mid-1980s, the World Jewish Congress also entered into diplomatic talks with several Central and Eastern European countries, notably Communist East Germany, whose leadership the WJC urged to recognize its obligations to Jewish victims of Nazi Germany. In February 1990, GDR Prime Minister Hans Modrow sent a letter to WJC President Edgar Bronfman in which he recognized on behalf of the East German government the GDR&#x27;s responsibility for German crimes committed against the Jewish people under the Nazi regime. In a statement, Modrow said:

The German Democratic Republic stands unalterably by its duty to do everything against racism, Nazism, anti-Semitism, and hatred among peoples, so that, in the future, war and fascism will never again start from German soil, but only peace and understanding among people.

A few weeks later, the first freely elected parliament of the GDR, the &quot;Volkskammer&quot;, passed a resolution which recognized the GDR&#x27;s responsibility for the Holocaust and asked &quot;Jews around the world for forgiveness&quot;. The GDR pledged to compensate for material damages to Jews and to safeguard Jewish traditions. The resolution became part of the German reunification treaty and continues to be part of German law.

In 1987, the World Jewish Congress held a meeting of its executive committee in Budapest, Hungary, the first WJC gathering in Communist Eastern Europe since the end of World War II. The Hungarian government had accepted that there would to be no restrictions to the attendance of Israeli delegates or the subjects of discussion.

====Waldheim affair====
In 1986, the World Jewish Congress alleged that Austrian presidential candidate Kurt Waldheim, a former secretary general of the United Nations, had lied about his service as an officer in the mounted corps of the Nazi Party &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (SA), and his time as German ordnance officer in Thessaloniki, Greece, from 1942 to 1943.

Waldheim called the allegations &quot;pure lies and malicious acts&quot;. In a telex to Bronfman, he said that his past had been &quot;deliberately misinterpreted&quot;. Nevertheless, he admitted that he had known about German reprisals against partisans: &quot;Yes, I knew. I was horrified. But what could I do? I had either to continue to serve or be executed.&quot; He said that he had never fired a shot or even seen a partisan. His former immediate superior at the time stated that Waldheim had &quot;remained confined to a desk&quot;.

Former Austrian Jewish chancellor Bruno Kreisky called the World Jewish Congress&#x27;s actions an &quot;extraordinary infamy&quot; adding that in election, Austrians &quot;won&#x27;t allow the Jews abroad to order us about and tell us who should be our President&quot;.

In view of the ongoing international controversy, the Austrian government decided to appoint an international committee of historians to examine Waldheim&#x27;s life between 1938 and 1945. Their report found no evidence of any personal involvement of Waldheim in those crimes. At the same time, although he had stated that he was unaware of any crimes taking place, the historians cited evidence that Waldheim must have known about war crimes.

Throughout his term as president (1986–1992), Waldheim and his wife Elisabeth were officially deemed &quot;personae non gratae&quot; by the United States. They could visit only Arab countries and the Vatican City. In 1987, they were put on a watch list of persons banned from entering the United States and remained on the list even after the publication of the International Committee of Historians&#x27; report on his military past in the Wehrmacht.

On May 5, 1987, Bronfman spoke to the World Jewish Congress saying Waldheim was &quot;part and parcel of the Nazi killing machine&quot;. Waldheim subsequently filed a lawsuit against Bronfman, but dropped the suit shortly after due to a lack of evidence in his favor.

===Restitution of Holocaust-era assets and compensation payments===
In 1992, the World Jewish Congress established the World Jewish Restitution Organization (WJRO), an umbrella body of Jewish organizations and including the Jewish Agency for Israel. Its purpose is to pursue the restitution of Jewish property in Europe, outside Germany (which is dealt with by the Claims Conference). According to its website, the WRJO&#x27;s mission is to consult and negotiate &quot;with national and local governments to conclude agreements and ensure legislation concerning the restitution of property to the Jewish people&quot;, to conduct &quot;research on Jewish property in national and local archives and to establish a central data bank in which information on Jewish communal property will be recorded and assembled, and to allocate &quot;funds for the preservation of Jewish cultural and educational projects in that country. To date, such funds have been establishes in Poland, Romania and Hungary.&quot; Current World Jewish Congress President Ronald S. Lauder is chairman of the WRJO.

====Swiss bank settlement====

In the late 1990s, as President of the WJC, Edgar Bronfman championed the cause of restitution from Switzerland for Holocaust survivors. Bronfman began an initiative that led to the $1.25 billion settlement from Swiss banks, aiming to resolve claims &quot;that the Swiss hoarded bank accounts opened by Jews who were murdered by the Nazis&quot;.

In total, the WJC, the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, the World Jewish Restitution Organization, and the International Commission on Holocaust Era Insurance Claims, founded in 1998, have secured millions of dollars for the victims and survivors of the Holocaust in payments from Germany, Swiss banks, Insurances and other parties totaling $20 billion.
In 1995, the WJC initiated negotiations on behalf of various Jewish organizations with Swiss banks and the government of Switzerland over so-called dormant World War II-era bank accounts of Holocaust victims. The WJC entered a class-action lawsuit in Brooklyn, NY alleging that Holocaust victims and their families faced improper barriers to accessing WWII-era Swiss bank accounts because of requirements such as death certificates (typically non-existent for Holocaust victims), and that some Swiss banks made deliberate efforts to retain the account balances indefinitely. The claims also included the value of art works purported to have been stolen, &quot;damages&quot; to persons denied admission to Switzerland on the strength of refugee applications, and the value or cost of labor purported to have been performed by persons being maintained at Swiss government expense in displaced-person camps during the Holocaust, along with interest on such claims from the time of loss. The WJC marshaled the support of US government officials including New York Senator Alfonse D&#x27;Amato, who held hearings of the Senate Banking Committee on the topic and claimed that &quot;hundreds of millions of dollars&quot; of WWII-era Jewish assets remained in Swiss banks. At the behest of US President Bill Clinton, Undersecretary of Commerce Stuart Eizenstat testified at these hearings that Swiss banks knowingly purchased looted gold from the Nazis during WWII. Eizenstat was later named special envoy of the US government for Holocaust issues. The report relied exclusively on US government archives. It contained no new historical information on Nazi victims&#x27; deposits into Swiss banks, and criticized the decisions of US officials who negotiated settlements with Switzerland after the war as being too lenient.

Audits ordered by the Swiss government of dormant accounts between 1962 and 1995 showed a total of US$32 million (in 1995 terms) in unclaimed war-era accounts. However, during the negotiations, the Swiss banks agreed to commission another audit of wartime accounts, headed by former US Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker. The Volcker Commission report concluded that the 1999 book value of all dormant accounts possibly belonging to victims of Nazi persecution that were unclaimed, closed by the Nazis or closed by unknown persons was CHF 95 million. Of this total, CHF 24 million were &quot;probably&quot; related to victims of Nazi persecution.

The commission recommended that for settlement purposes, the book values should be modified back to 1945 values (by adding back fees paid and subtracting interest) and then be multiplied by 10 to reflect average long-term investment rates in Switzerland. On 12 August 1998, several major Swiss banks agreed to pay Holocaust survivors and their relatives more than US$1.25 billion over the following three years. As part of the settlement, the plaintiffs agreed to drop a lawsuit against the Government-owned Swiss National Bank in US courts.

====Nazi gold====
In 1997, a study commissioned by the World Jewish Congress concluded that Nazi Germany had looted at least US$8.5 billion in gold between 1933 and 1945 from Jews and other victims. The study estimated that a third of the gold had come from individuals and private businesses rather than central banks and that over US$2 billion of privately owned gold eventually ended up in Swiss banks. Switzerland rejected the WJC accusations. In response to inquiries from the World Jewish Congress, the US Federal Reserve Bank admitted in 1997 that personal gold seized by the Nazis was melted into gold bars after the war and then shipped as gold bullion to the central banks of four European countries. In 1996, Sweden also opened an investigation into assertions by the World Jewish Congress that looted Nazi gold from World War II had been deposited in Swedish government bank vaults.

====Agreements with other European countries on Holocaust-era property restitution and compensation====
During the 1990s and 2000s, at the behest of the World Jewish Congress a total of 17 European countries established special committees to look into their role during World War II. Many set up funds to compensate Jewish and other victims of the war.

In 1997, French Prime Minister Alain Juppé created a commission to investigate the seizures of Jewish property by the occupying Nazi forces and the French collaborators during the war.

In 2000/2001, the World Jewish Congress helped to negotiate a compensation agreement with the German government and industry under which a €5 billion fund was set up to compensate World War II slave and forced laborers, mainly living Central and Eastern Europe, who had hitherto not received any compensation payments for the suffering under Nazi rule.

====Restitution of looted art====
In 1998, the WJC released a list of 2,000 people who allegedly took part in the Nazis&#x27; massive looting of art. It named people from 11 countries, including museum curators, gallery owners, art experts and other intermediaries. A few weeks later, in Washington DC, delegates from 44 countries agreed to set up a central registry on art looted by the Nazis which could be established on the Internet.

Ronald S. Lauder, then chairman of the WJC Art Recovery Commission, estimated that 110,000 pieces of art worth between US$10 and 30 billion were still missing. In 2000, the World Jewish Congress criticized museums for waiting for artworks to be claimed by Holocaust victims instead of publicly announcing that they have suspect items. In the wake of the WJC accusations, a number of countries commissioned investigations into Nazi-looted art.

== Organization and related bodies ==
The WJC is made up of five regional branches: WJC North America, the Latin American Jewish Congress, the European Jewish Congress, the Euro-Asian Jewish Congress (working in Russia, Ukraine etc.), and the WJC Israel. Besides that, Jewish umbrella organizations in 100 countries are directly affiliated to the World Jewish Congress. Its highest decision-making body is the Plenary Assembly, which meets every four years and elects the lay leadership (executive committee) of the WJC. In between plenary assemblies, meetings of the WJC Governing Board are normally held once a year. Affiliated Jewish organizations send delegates to these two WJC bodies; their number depends on the size of the Jewish communities they represent.

A special meeting of the Plenary Assembly, attended by over 400 delegates and observers from over 70 countries, was held in Buenos Aires in March 2015. The last regular plenary assembly was held In New York in April 2017, and prior to that in Budapest in May 2013, with 600 delegates and observers in attention.

The WJC also maintains a Research Institute based in Jerusalem, Israel. It is involved in research and analysis of a variety of issues of importance to contemporary Jewry, and its findings are published in the form of policy dispatches.

Operating under the auspices of the World Jewish Congress in Israel, the Israel Council on Foreign Relations has since its inception in 1989 hosted heads of state, prime ministers, foreign ministers and other distinguished visitors to Israel and has issued several publications on Israeli foreign policy and international affairs, including its tri-annual foreign policy journal, the Israel Journal of Foreign Affairs.

The WJC&#x27;s current policy priorities include combating anti-Semitism, especially the rise of neo-Nazi parties in Europe, providing political support for Israel, opposing the &quot;Iranian threat&quot;, and dealing with the legacy of the Holocaust, notably with respect to property restitution, reparation and compensation for Holocaust survivors, as well as with Holocaust remembrance. One of the WJC&#x27;s major programs is concerned with the plight of Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries. The WJC is also involved in inter-faith dialogue with Christian and Muslim groups.

===Current leadership===
At the 13th Plenary Assembly in Jerusalem in January 2009, Ronald S. Lauder was formally and unanimously elected as WJC president, having previously served as acting president. Lauder was confirmed in his post by the 14th Plenary Assembly, which took place in Budapest in May 2013, and for a third term by the 15th Plenary Assembly in New York, in April 2017.

French banker Baron David René de Rothschild serves as chairman of the WJC Governing Board, and Lebanese-born Chella Safra from Brazil is the treasurer of the organization. Viatcheslav Moshe Kantor, the president of the European Jewish Congress was named as chairman of the WJC Policy Council.

Although the WJC Executive Committee comprises almost 50 members, including the heads of the 12 largest Jewish communities in the world outside Israel, a smaller Steering Committee is running the day-to-day activities of the organization. It is composed of the president, the chairman of the WJC Governing Board, the treasurer, the chairmen of the five regional affiliates, the chairmen of the Policy Council, and other members.

===Jewish Diplomatic Corps===
The Jewish Diplomatic Corps (JDCorps), also referred to as World Jewish Diplomatic Corps (WJDC) — is an international network of Jewish professionals engaged in public diplomacy. Initiated in February 2006 by the WJC, it consists of about 300 members, known as Jewish Diplomats (JDs), aged 27 to 45 from more than 50 countries, who are already accomplished professionals. It was turned independent in 2009 by cofounders Adam H. Koffler and Peleg Reshef. At the end of 2021, a delegation of 40 young diplomats from the WJC visited the United Arab Emirates.

==Relations with Poland==
The WJC has evinced a great interest in Poland, both before the war, when the country was home to some 3.25 million Jews (10 percent of that country&#x27;s total population, forming the largest Jewish community in Europe); and in the post-war period, when the Jewish community was reconstituted. In second half of the 1930s, in the face of a marked rise in antisemitism, the WJC attempted to intervene on behalf of Polish Jewry. In December 1936, for example, Nahum Goldmann visited Poland and conferred with the Minister of Foreign Affairs Jozef Beck, but this &quot;demarche&quot; did little to abate the situation. In order to counter the drastic effects of the ban on kosher slaughter (Shechita), the WJC Economic Department prepared a study on the legislation and proposed various relief measures that could be instituted. The WJC also intervened to ensure that Polish Jews deported from Germany at the end of October 1938 and stranded in Zbaszyn would be allowed to resettle elsewhere in Poland.

After the war, when a wave of anti-Jewish violence swept the country, the WJC prevailed upon the Polish government to remove all obstacles faced by Jews who sought to leave the country and for the most part Jews were able to emigrate unhindered until about 1950. Most left without visas or exit permits thanks to a decree of Gen. Spychalski.

As the Jewish community dwindled, over successive waves of emigration (the last in 1968), the WJC saw Poland as an important repository of Jewish history as well as the custodians of the killing grounds in which much of European Jewry fell victim to the German Final Solution. In 1979, the Polish government and the WJC worked to have Auschwitz placed on the UNESCO World Heritage list as site of genocide. The organization repeatedly pressed Poland to ensure that in Auschwitz and other Nazi German death camp sites, the memory of the Jews who had been the main victims, would not be subsumed in collective memory. As such, at the end of the 1980s, the organization was deeply involved in the struggle to have the Carmelite convent that had been established on its ground removed. Rabbi David Rosen of the Anti-Defamation League noted at the time: &quot;To some extent the WJC did determine the tune. Their style created the atmosphere in which no public Jewish organization could not get involved. Had the WJC not got involved, those issues might not have developed in the way they did.&quot;

In April 2012, President Lauder declared that by prevaricating on the restitution issue Poland was &quot;telling many elderly prewar landowners, including Holocaust survivors, that they have no foreseeable hope of even a small measure of justice for the assets that were seized from them&quot;.

In pursuit of a more nuanced approach to the history of Polish-Jewish relations that includes Jewish recognition of Polish losses suffered during World War II, the WJC&#x27;s Research Institute published two monographs which explored the attempts to revive Polish Jewry and the ways in which Poles and Jews have confronted their common history. Moreover, the Israel Council on Foreign Relations, which operates under the auspices of the World Jewish Congress, together with the Polish Institute for International Affairs, held two successive conferences (one in Warsaw in 2009 and the other in Jerusalem in 2010) to discuss bilateral relations and international issues of mutual concern. At the second gathering the 20th anniversary of the re-establishment of relations between the two countries was marked.

==Support for Israel==

The mission statement of the World Jewish Congress says that the organization seeks &quot;to enhance solidarity among Jewish communities throughout the world and, recognizing the centrality of the State of Israel to contemporary Jewish identity, to strengthen the bonds of Jewish communities and Jews in the Diaspora with Israel&quot;.

=== Israeli legitimacy ===
The WJC recently started to focus its main activity on countering the delegitimization of Israel.

The WJC says that it lobbies international organizations, notably the United Nations, to ensure that governments &quot;apply the same standards to Israel when judging its actions compared with those of other countries&quot;. The WJC states on its website that &quot;Israel should not be singled out for criticism by countries which do not themselves adhere to the principles of democracy, human rights and the rule of law&quot; and that &quot;Israel needs to be treated fairly in international organizations, especially in United Nations bodies such as the UN Human Rights Council.&quot;

In April 2017, United Nations Secretary General António Guterres became the first UN chief ever to address a World Jewish Congress gathering and also addressed the issue of bias against Israel. Speaking in New York to the delegates of the WJC Plenary Assembly, Guterres promised to stand up against anti-Israel bias at the world organization and said the Jewish state &quot;must be treated like any other member state&quot;. He also stressed that Israel had an &quot;undeniable right to exist and to live in peace and security with its neighbors,&quot; and that &quot;the modern form of anti-Semitism is the denial of the existence of the State of Israel&quot;.

In September 2011, the World Jewish Congress, together with the International Council of Jewish Parliamentarians, assembled in New York to lobby the international community against allowing the Palestinian Authority&#x27;s unilateral move to become a full member of the United Nations and bypass negotiations with Israel. At a dinner hosted by WJC President Lauder, the delegation of Jewish parliamentarians engaged in an open discussion with UN ambassadors from key countries including Germany, France, Poland and Russia.

Ronald Lauder, writing in the German newspaper &quot;Die Welt&quot;, called for Israel to be admitted into the Western alliance NATO: &quot;Israel needs real guarantees for its security. European NATO member states – including Turkey – must admit the state of Israel into the Western alliance,&quot; the WJC president wrote. He referred to the uprisings in Egypt and Tunisia and said they were reminders of how &quot;unpredictable&quot; developments in the Middle East were. Israeli NATO membership &quot;would send a strong signal to other countries not to take on Israel&quot;, Lauder argued.

In June 2012, on the third anniversary of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&#x27;s speech at Bar-Ilan University, Lauder published a full-page ad in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; and other newspapers in which he called on Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to return to the negotiating table. &quot;Accept the offer to talk, President Abbas. It takes two sides to make peace,&quot; Lauder wrote.

==Holocaust remembrance==

Preserving the memory of the Shoah is a key issue in the WJC&#x27;s public efforts. In January 2011, WJC President Lauder accompanied German President Christian Wulff and a number of Holocaust survivors to Auschwitz. Lauder declared:

Auschwitz is the largest Jewish cemetery in the world. Auschwitz is where the systematic annihilation of European Jewry was refined and perfected. It is where four gas chambers and four crematoria annihilated more than a million Jews. It is the place where the notorious SS &quot;Doctor&quot; Josef Mengele conducted cruel medical experiments on people. It is also the place where thousands upon thousands of Poles, Roma and Sinti and Soviet prisoners of war were brutally murdered alongside the Jewish victims. We owe it to all of them, and to the survivors, to make sure that today&#x27;s anti-Semites and hatemongers – those who want to destroy the Jewish people and its only refugee, the Jewish nation state Israel – will not get another go at it.

On January 28, 2017, WJC President Lauder defended a statement made by President Donald Trump on the occasion of International Holocaust Remembrance Day that had generated controversy for failing to mention that the victims of the Holocaust were Jewish. In response to Anti-Defamation League director Jonathan Greenblatt&#x27;s criticism of the statement, Lauder dismissed concern for remembering the Jewish identities of the victims of the Holocaust as &quot;manufactured controversies&quot;.

Since September 2019 the World Jewish Congress receives &quot;Austrian Holocaust Memorial Servants&quot; from the Gedenkdienst program, founded in 1992 by Dr. Andreas Maislinger, from the Austrian Service Abroad.

==Restitution of Jewish assets==
Since the end of World War II, the WJC has pressed governments and private enterprises to return seized or looted Jewish assets to their rightful owners. It was instrumental in concluding agreements with a number of European countries.

&quot;See above:&quot; Restitution of Holocaust-era assets and compensation payments

In its policy guidelines the WJC states that negotiations on Holocaust-era assets are &quot;conducted in the framework of the World Jewish Restitution Organization in coordination with the Israeli government and with the support of the US government and the European Union.&quot;
The organization emphasizes that &quot;the distribution of any compensation monies should not be handled by the WJC. The WJC does not seek any form of commission or gratification payments from Holocaust-era compensation or restitution agreements.&quot; WJC leaders have in particular urged the Polish government to come up with a restitution law for looted private properties, but Warsaw in March 2011 announced that this was impossible due to the current economic situation.

=== Fighting Holocaust denial, revisionism and glorification of the Nazis ===
On repeated occasions, the WJC has urged countries to ensure that Holocaust denial is publicly condemned and fought. WJC officials have been critical of a rise of marches in a number of European countries including Hungary and Serbia by WWII Nazi veterans, far-right extremists and neo-Nazis who publicly glorify the Hitler regime and espouse anti-Semitic ideology.
In July 2009, Bernie Ecclestone faced calls from WJC President Ronald S. Lauder to resign as Formula One chief after he had praised Adolf Hitler in a newspaper interview and said that Hitler &quot;got things done.&quot; Lauder said someone with Ecclestone&#x27;s views should not be allowed to run such an important and popular racing series. He urged Formula One teams, drivers and host countries to suspend their cooperation with him. In reaction, Ecclestone told the news agency Associated Press that &quot;I think the people who are saying that haven&#x27;t got the power to say these things.&quot; Asked if the WJC was influential, Ecclestone said: &quot;It&#x27;s a pity they didn&#x27;t sort the banks out&quot; and &quot;They have a lot of influence everywhere.&quot; After a public outcry, Ecclestone apologized for his remarks and said he had &quot;been an idiot.&quot;

The WJC also criticized the US internet retailer Amazon.com for selling &#x27;I love Hitler&#x27; T-shirts and similar merchandise praising senior Nazi officials. The items were later removed from the website.

In February 2012, the WJC attacked the German Federal Constitutional Court for a ruling which acquitted a Holocaust denier. WJC Vice-president Charlotte Knobloch called the verdict &quot;quirky&quot; and said that it cast a damning light on the legal proceedings. She accused the highest German court of disposing of Germany&#x27;s law that makes the denial of the Shoah a crime &quot;through the backdoor&quot;.

Following an interview with Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on German public television in which he repeatedly called Israel &quot;an artificial state&quot; that had been built on the &quot;lie of the Holocaust&quot;, Knobloch called on the German government to publicly condemn the Iranian leader&#x27;s statements and to isolate Iran diplomatically.

Standing alone amongst all major Jewish organizations, World Jewish Congress President Ronald Lauder backed Donald Trump&#x27;s decision to omit any mention of Jews in his 2017 Holocaust commemoration statement. Lauder contended that other Jewish groups were &quot;play[ing] politics&quot; and engaging in &quot;manufactured outrages&quot; that distracted from &quot;real&quot; instances of anti-Semitic threats. The WJC also publicly backed David M. Friedman as President Trump&#x27;s nominee for ambassador to Israel, in spite of critics who accused Friedman of trivializing the gravity of the Holocaust by comparing Jewish members of the liberal pro-Israel group J Street to &quot;kapos&quot;, or Nazi collaborators.

==Prosecution of Nazi war criminals==
The World Jewish Congress has repeatedly called for the prosecution of presumed Nazi war criminals. WJC President Ronald S. Lauder said in 2011: &quot;There must never be impunity or closure for those who were involved in mass murder and genocide, irrespective of their age&quot;. The WJC would persist in its efforts to bring the &quot;few old men out there who have the blood of innocent Shoah victims on their hands&quot; before courts of law, to be tried and held accountable for their actions.

In 2009, WJC officials called for the extradition Ukrainian-born John Demjanjuk from the United States to Germany, where he was wanted on charges of aiding to kill at least 27,900 Jews at the Sobibor death camp during World War II. Demjanjuk&#x27;s trial and conviction by a Munich court in May 2011 was hailed by the organization. It declared: &quot;Belatedly, justice has now been done, and the family members of those who were brutally murdered in Sobibor will certainly welcome this verdict.&quot;

In December 2010, Lauder publicly urged Serbia to extradite Peter Egner to the United States where he was wanted to stand trial for serving in a Nazi unit during World War II that murdered 17,000 Jews. Egner died in January 2011.

==Fighting anti-Semitism==
One of the principal activities of the World Jewish Congress has been to fight anti-Semitism in all its forms. Its stated policy on this issue is: &quot;Governments and international organizations need to provide adequate resources for the fight against hatred, notably by providing security to Jewish communities and by improving education. Laws against anti-Semitism and other forms of racism need to be adopted and enforced properly in every country. All forms and expressions of neo-Nazism, xenophobia and intolerance are unacceptable and have to be condemned, and the full force of the law needs to be applied to those who are a danger to democracy liberty and Jewish communities. Marches by extremist, anti-Semitic groups should be banned where national laws provide for such a possibility. Governments and political leaders should condemn such events and work together with local Jewish communities.&quot;

In an opinion article entitled &quot;Sweden&#x27;s Shame&quot;, in 2010, WJC President Ronald S. Lauder attacked the Swedish government, church officials and media for &quot;fanning the flames&quot; of hatred against Jews.

In May 2012, Lauder condemned as &quot;despicable&quot; remarks made by the Norwegian sociologist Johan Galtung who had &quot;revived anti-Semitic canards such as Jewish control of the media&quot; and suggested that Israel&#x27;s Mossad could have been behind the 2011 &quot;massacres in Norway committed by Anders Breivik&quot; in which 77 people died. Lauder declared: &quot;There is a growing tendency to blame the Jews for all evil that happens under the sun. It is a scandal that a leading academics such as Galtung does not shy away from citing notorious forgeries such as the Protocols of the Elders of Zion to support his bigoted arguments.&quot;

In August 2012, the WJC president criticized Austrian politicians for failing to publicly denounce the leader of the third-largest political party in the country, the FPÖ, Heinz-Christian Strache, who had posted an anti-Semitic cartoon on his Facebook page. &quot;Clearly, and not for the first time, the FPÖ leader is trying to whip up anti-Semitic sentiment. His repeated denials are not credible because his words and actions speak for themselves,&quot; Ronald Lauder said in a statement, adding: &quot;This scandal shows that anti-Jewish resentment is still widespread, and unscrupulous politicians are allowed to exploit it for electioneering purposes. That is mind-boggling, and it could have negative repercussions for Austrian Jews.&quot;

In 2013, Budapest, Hungary was chosen as a location for the 14th Plenary Assembly because of concerns over the rise of anti-Semitism in that country. Péter Feldmájer, president of the Federation of Jewish Communities in Hungary, stated this was &quot;a symbol of solidarity with our Jewish community, which has been faced with growing anti-Semitism in recent years&quot;. In his speech at the opening dinner, in the presence of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, WJC President Ronald S. Lauder lambasted a series of recent anti-Semitic and racist incidents in Hungary. He particularly mentioned Zsolt Bayer, who had penned a newspaper column referring to Roma as &quot;cowardly, repulsive, noxious animals&quot; that are &quot;unfit to live among people&quot; and &quot;shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to exist.&quot; Lauder said &quot;such words are reminiscent of the darkest era in European history&quot; and concluded that &quot;Hungary&#x27;s international reputation has suffered in recent years&quot; not because it was being &quot;smeared by the foreign press&quot; but rather due to extremists in the Jobbik party. &quot;Jobbik is dragging the good name of Hungary through the mud,&quot; Lauder said. On the eve of the WJC assembly in Budapest, about 700 Jobbik supporters held a demonstration in downtown Budapest where they railed against &quot;Zionists who had subjugated the indigenous people of Hungary.&quot;

In his speech to WJC delegates, Orbán condemned the rise in anti-Semitism in Hungary and in Europe more widely. He called it a danger that &quot;threatens even us Christians&quot; and voiced determination to stamp it out. The WJC said in reaction that Orbán had not confronted the true nature of the problem. &quot;We regret that Mr. Orbán did not address any recent anti-Semitic or racist incidents in the country, nor did he provide sufficient reassurance that a clear line has been drawn between his government and the far-right fringe,&quot; a WJC spokesman said afterwards.

=== Hatred on the internet ===
The World Jewish Congress has also urged internet companies, including social media giants such as Google, to act against Holocaust denial, hate speech and anti-Jewish incitement on their platforms. A survey published by the WJC in 2017 revealed that &quot;More than 382,000 anti-Semitic posts were uploaded to social media in 2016, an average of one post every 83 seconds&quot;, which WJC CEO R. Robert Singer said revealed &quot;how alarming the situation really is.&quot;

Previously, the organization had urged the German branch of YouTube of tolerating clips of neo-Nazi rock bands on its platform that were illegal in Germany. In an opinion piece for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Singer also accused the internet retailer Amazon.com of offering books that glorify the Holocaust. The WJC CEO wrote that Amazon customers &quot;can buy a plethora of Holocaust-denying literature, swastika pendants and other Nazi memorabilia. While books are clearly different from doormats or flags, they still violate Amazon&#x27;s guidelines, not to mention common decency.&quot;

===Dialogue with other religions===
The WJC believes that the three Abrahamic faiths (Judaism, Christianity and Islam) can cooperate &quot;to respond to the challenges posed by developments in modern society, especially to discuss and promote shared values.&quot;

==Jewish–Christian dialogue==
Inter-religious dialogue between Jews and Christians started in the 1940s, notably with the establishment of the International Council of Christians and Jews in Switzerland in 1947. The WJC has managed to establish good relations with the Catholic Church, especially since the Second Vatican Council and the Declaration &quot;Nostra aetate&quot; in 1965. Progress, however, is slow with regard to the Orthodox and Protestant Churches, which according to the WJC is mainly due to the decentralized nature of these churches and certain political issues related to the Middle East conflict.
Since 1945, WJC leaders have been received by Catholic pontiffs a number of times. Pope Pius XII received WJC Secretary General A. Leon Kubowitzki in private audience in 1945. Pope Paul VI met WJC President Nahum Goldmann in 1969 and WJC Secretary General Gerhart Riegner in 1975. In 1979, Philip Klutznick met with Pope John Paul II, and Klutznick&#x27;s successor Edgar Bronfman Sr. was received by John Paul II in 1992 and 2003. Bronfman led a delegation of Jewish leaders for a meeting with Pope Benedict XVI in June 2005, and his successor Ronald S. Lauder was received by Benedict XVI in October 2007, December 2010 and May 2012. Pope Francis received a delegation of the International Jewish Committee on Interreligious Consultations, including several members of the WJC, in June 2013.

On his election as new Catholic pontiff, Ronald Lauder called Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio &quot;an experienced man, someone who is known for his open-mindedness ... a man of dialogue, a man who is able to build bridges with other faiths&quot;.

The organization was instrumental in the creation inter-faith bodies such as the International Jewish Committee of Inter-religious Consultations (IJCIC), and it has actively participated in the International Catholic-Jewish Liaison Committee (ILC). The WJC also contributed to the establishment of diplomatic relations between the State of Israel and the Holy See in the 1990s.

During the 1980s, the WJC persuaded Pope John II to come out in favor of the removal of a convent of Carmelite nuns which had opened near the site of the former Nazi death camp Auschwitz.

The role of the Vatican during the Holocaust remains a controversial issue and has repeatedly flared up. The beatification and possible canonization of Pope Pius XII was criticized by WJC President Ronald S. Lauder, who said that all Vatican archives on the period should be made accessible to scholars. &quot;There are strong concerns about Pope Pius XII&#x27;s political role during World War II which should not be ignored,&quot; Lauder declared in a statement.

In February 2009, Lauder and the WJC were highly critical of the Vatican&#x27;s decision to revoke the excommunication of Bishop Richard Williamson, a senior member of the dissident Catholic group Society of St. Pius X. Williamson, in an interview with Swedish television, had denied the existence of gas chambers in Nazi concentration camps. Lauder said: &quot;The Vatican was badly advised to revoke the excommunication of the four bishops ... Therefore, we call on Pope Benedict XVI to urgently address these concerns and to ensure that the achievements of four decades of Catholic-Jewish dialogue are not being damaged by a small minority of people who want to divide rather than unite.&quot; Lauder later praised Benedict XVI for writing a personal letter to Catholic bishops in which the Pope explained himself. &quot;The Pope has found clear and unequivocal words regarding Bishop Williamson&#x27;s Holocaust denial, and he deserves praise for admitting that mistakes were made within the Vatican in the handling of this affair,&quot; the WJC president was quoted as saying.

In 2010, Ronald S. Lauder was also critical of the continued use of the Good Friday Prayer for the Jews in church liturgy. In an op-ed for the Italian newspaper &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot;, the WJC president wrote: &quot;When the Pope allows the use of the Good Friday Prayer of the old Tridentine liturgy, which calls for Jews to acknowledge Jesus Christ as the Savior of all men, some of us are deeply hurt.&quot;

==Dialogue with Islam==
The World Jewish Congress considers dialogue with representatives of moderate Islam as &quot;one of the most important and challenging issues at this time. The increasing gap of understanding between so-called Western liberal democracies and the Islamic world is extremely dangerous,&quot; according to the WJC website.

In 2008, WJC leaders met with King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia at an inter-faith conference in the Spanish capital Madrid. Later that year, WJC President Ronald S. Lauder also called on the Saudi monarch in New York. In December 2011, WJC Vice-president Marc Schneier was received by King Hamad of Bahrain at the royal palace in Manama.

The World Jewish Congress also co-hosted a gathering of European Muslim and Jewish leaders in Brussels in December 2010, which included meetings with senior European Union officials. On that occasion, WJC Vice-president Marc Schneier declared: &quot;We have hopefully kick-started a movement that will spread across Europe. The recipe really is quite simple: our two communities must focus more on what unites us than what separates us. We also must restrain the radicals within our own ranks and make sure they don&#x27;t gain the upper hand.&quot;

In a speech in London in 2010, Schneier praised leaders of the Al-Azhar University in Cairo, considered the oldest center of Islamic scholarship in the world, for opening up inter-religious dialogue to the Jews. He declared: &quot;This is a landmark decision, and Al-Azhar deserves praise for it. Coming from the leading center of Islamic thinking in the world, it will be enormously helpful for all moderate forces within Islam. [ ... ] Leaders from both sides should now seize the opportunity and take Jewish-Muslim relations to the next level. Both communities have a lot more in common, and to give to the other side, than many people think.&quot;

==Pluralistic Israel==
In August 2018, WJC President Ronald S. Lauder called on &quot;Israel&#x27;s government to listen to the voices of protest and outrage&quot; and uphold the country&#x27;s democratic and egalitarian principles against the threat of dominance by restrictive Orthodox influence, from what he called &#x27;a radical minority&#x27;.

===Iran===
Since the Islamic revolution in 1979, and in particular following the terrorist attacks against the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires in February 1992 and the AMIA Jewish center in Buenos Aires in July 1994, in which over 100 people were killed and which Iran&#x27;s leadership was accused of having masterminded, the World Jewish Congress has been vocal in denouncing what it calls the &quot;Iranian threat&quot;.

In 1995, then WJC President Edgar Bronfman Sr. was reportedly instrumental in blocking a planned deal by the DuPont-owned US oil firm Conoco with Iran. Bronfman was a member of the DuPont board of directors. The deal would have been the first major investment by an oil company in Iran since 1979, when the United States broke off trade with the country after the seizure of the US Embassy in Teheran by Islamic militants. Two months later, the WJC publicly welcomed a decision by US President Bill Clinton to impose a trade embargo on Iran. &quot;We applaud President Clinton&#x27;s decisive blow against terrorism,&quot; declared WJC Executive Director Elan Steinberg. In 2006, after prosecutors in Argentina asked a judge to order the arrest of a former Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and other members of his government in connection with the AMIA bombing, Bronfman said that &quot;Iran is a state sponsor of terrorism&quot;, adding that &quot;the entire international community has a moral responsibility to ensure that Iran is held accountable for its terrorist actions.&quot;

The WJC lobbied for the issuing of Red Notices by Interpol against the Iranian suspects in the bombing case, which were approved by the Interpol General Assembly in November 2007. On the 18th anniversary of the AMIA bombing in July 2012, WJC President Lauder declared: &quot;The Iranian regime has blood on its hands, not only by suppressing dissent at home but also by sponsoring terrorism world-wide. What the world saw 18 years ago in Buenos Aires it can still see today, be it in Syria, in Lebanon or in other places.&quot;

In a 2010 resolution on Iran, the WJC expressed support for international condemnation of current Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&#x27;s repeated calls for the abolition of the State of Israel and his statements questioning the Holocaust. The organization resolved &quot;to make the four-fold threat (the nuclear threat; the threat of genocidal incitement; international state sponsored terrorism; and the systematic and widespread violations of the human and civil rights of the Iranian people) that the current Iranian regime poses to international peace and stability, a high strategic priority of the WJC.&quot;

In 2006, the WJC launched the &quot;Iran Update&quot;, &quot;a comprehensive weekly publication disseminated via the internet to most members of the US Congress and government, United Nations missions, foreign diplomats, European Union officials, and Israeli policymakers, in addition to Jewish communities worldwide.&quot; The publication focused on exposing Iran&#x27;s ongoing pursuit of a nuclear capability, domestic Iranian politics, Iranian foreign policy in the Middle East and internationally, Israeli policy vis-à-vis Iran and the efforts of worldwide Jewish communities in combating Iranian Holocaust-denial and nuclear proliferation.

Further to the WJC&#x27;s and other international organizations&#x27; calls, representatives of many Western countries either did not show up or walked out of the conference chamber when Iranian President Ahmadinejad attacked Israel in his speech to the Durban Review Conference in Geneva in April 2009 and to the United Nations General Assembly meeting in New York in September 2009.
The WJC has repeatedly run campaigns accusing Iran of deceiving the international community and calling Ahmadinejad &quot;the world&#x27;s foremost hatemonger&quot;.

In 2008, WJC President Ronald S. Lauder criticized a visit by Swiss Foreign Minister Micheline Calmy-Rey to Tehran, where she met with Ahmadinejad mainly to help a Swiss company secure a multibillion-dollar contract to buy natural gas from Iran. Lauder told a press conference in Bern: &quot;Maybe that money that Switzerland is paying to Iran will some day be used to either buy weapons to kill Israelis, or buy weapons to kill Americans, or buy missiles to be able to deliver nuclear weapons.&quot;

Lauder also led diplomatic efforts to persuade European businesses to withdraw from Iran. In January 2010, he warmly welcomed the announcement by Siemens CEO Peter Löscher that his company would not seek new business in Iran.

The WJC has repeatedly urged the international community to do more to bring to justice the masterminds of the terrorist attacks against Israel&#x27;s embassy and AMIA Jewish community center in Buenos Aires in the 1990s, which Argentinean prosecutors have said were carried out at the instigation of senior Iranian officials.
In July 2011, Olympic news outlet &quot;Around the Rings&quot; reported that World Jewish Congress president Ronald S. Lauder had issued a statement urging IOC officials to ban Iran from participating in the Olympic Games, citing Iranian athletes&#x27; refusal to compete against Israeli athletes. &quot;It is high time that a strong signal is sent to Iran that unless this long-standing boycott is lifted, Iranian athletes will not be allowed to enter major international events such as next year&#x27;s Olympic Games in London&quot;, Lauder said. The WJC reiterated its position when in May 2012 Iranian President Ahmadinejad announced plans to attend the London Olympics. Ahmadinejad has &quot;no business&quot; attending the London Olympic Games this summer, the &quot;Jewish Chronicle&quot; quoted a World Jewish Congress spokesman as saying.

==Jewish refugees from Arab countries==
The issue of Jewish refugees from Arab lands continues to be on the World Jewish Congress agenda today. The WJC website states that &quot;The plight of Jews who fled from, or still live in, Arab lands and their specific concerns are not well-known and need to be raised with governments and international organizations. Where illegal seizure of assets took place, these should be returned to their former owners, or adequate compensation should be paid. Jews remaining in Arab lands, as well as other religious minorities, should be granted religious freedom and allowed to practice their faith according to their traditions. Jewish communal sites in Arab countries must be preserved and respected.&quot; The WJC believes that the plight of the Jewish refugees from Arab lands has been neglected for decades by the international community, including governments and international organizations.

In September 2012, the WJC co-hosted two conferences on the issue, together with the Israeli government. They were held in Jerusalem and at the United Nations headquarters in New York, respectively. The aim was to raise the profile of the issue and enlist international support. In a speech to the New York symposium, WJC President Ronald S. Lauder urged the world to recognize the suffering of Jewish refugees. &quot;Now is the time to set the historical, diplomatic and legal record straight. Lasting peace can only be built on historical facts – both the issues of the Jewish refugees and the Palestinian refugees must be addressed.&quot; Lauder said that &quot;only addressing the historical facts&quot; could help to bring about peace. At the Jerusalem conference, a joint declaration was adopted calling on the United Nations to place the issue of Jewish refugees on its agenda and that of its affiliated forums.

Palestinian critics derided the move to raise this issue now as a &quot;manipulative strategy&quot;. It was &quot;part of a public relations campaign that is both cynical and hypocritical&quot;, PLO Executive member Hanan Ashrawi told the newspaper &quot;USA Today&quot;.

Following the conferences, Israel&#x27;s Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman instructed Israeli diplomats around the world to raise the matter in all official government meetings and with parliamentarians. According to figures provided by the Israeli Foreign Ministry, approximately 850,000 Jews from Arab states across the Middle East left their native countries following the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948 due to state-sponsored persecution. Most of them were forced to abandon their property and possessions, the ministry said.

==Other issues==
In August 2008, World Jewish Congress and Venezuelan Jewish community leaders met in Caracas with Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez Frias. The meeting stirred some controversy in the Jewish world because of Chávez&#x27; public support for Iranian leader Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and his strong criticism of Israel. However, then WJC Secretary-General Michael Schneider defended the meeting with Chávez and said the WJC acted only on behalf of, and with the backing of, the Venezuelan Jewish community.

Following the exclusion of Israeli tennis player Shahar Peer from an ATP tournament in Dubai in February 2009, the WJC called for the &quot;suspension of all sporting events in the [United Arab Emirates] until Israeli participants are admitted.&quot; The response of the women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s tours to the exclusion of Peer had been &quot;faint-hearted,&quot; and they should have canceled the event immediately, WJC President Lauder was quoted by the news agency Bloomberg as saying.

Ahead of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, the World Jewish Congress criticized the president of the International Olympic Committee, Jacques Rogge, for not agreeing to hold one minute&#x27;s silence at the opening ceremony in remembrance of the eleven Israeli sportsmen killed by Palestinian terrorists during the Olympic Games in Munich in 1972. Ronald Lauder said Rogge&#x27;s stance was &quot;unfeeling&quot; and &quot;completely out of touch.&quot; He added: &quot;Forty years after the saddest moment in Olympic history – when eleven Israeli athletes and sports officials and a German police officer were killed by Palestinian terrorists – it would have been an excellent opportunity to show to everyone that the sports world stands united against terrorism ... Nobody wants to &#x27;politicize&#x27; the Olympic Games, as the IOC seems to suggest, but Baron Rogge and his colleagues on the IOC Executive have utterly failed – or refused – to grasp the importance of such a symbolic act.&quot;

In January 2019 WJC President Lauder, the Albanian Ambassador to the UN Besiana Kadare, and the United Nations Department of Global Communications co-hosted an event discussing the actions of Albanians who protected Jews during the Holocaust in Albania.

==Fundraising and finances==
The WJC raises its funds mainly through the World Jewish Congress American Section, which is a non-profit body registered in the United States.

==Controversy==
A series of allegations about the organization&#x27;s accounting practices and &quot;unusual&quot; money transfers, was raised in 2004 by Isi Leibler, then a vice-president of the WJC. It led to an investigation of the finances of the World Jewish Congress. A comprehensive audit of the WJC&#x27;s accounts in Switzerland from 1995 to 2004, conducted by the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, reportedly found that &quot;over the years $3.8 million &#x27;disappeared&#x27; from the bank accounts&quot; and that there were &quot;significant un-reconciled cash withdrawals where there is no documentation of the usage of the funds.&quot; In January 2006, an investigation by the Office of the NY State Attorney General into the matter found no evidence of criminal conduct on the part of the WJC. Furthermore, the report of Attorney General Eliot Spitzer noted that the WJC had implemented all of his recommendations to improve financial oversight and management.

Spitzer&#x27;s office identified financial mismanagement and breaches of fiduciary duty, but found no criminal wrongdoing and concluded that any misconduct &quot;did not compromise the core mission&quot; of the organization or result in &quot;identifiable losses of charitable assets.&quot;

The report also highlighted several initiatives the WJC had taken since 2004 to improve financial management, including &quot;the creation of an audit committee and the position of chief financial officer, the computerization of all financial records, the creation of an employee handbook outlining official procedures and policies, the implementation of travel and reimbursement procedures, and the creation of a new fund-raising entity (the WJC Foundation).&quot;

Despite vigorously defending Israel Singer during the Attorney General&#x27;s inquiry, in March 2007 Bronfman abruptly announced his firing. He accused Singer of &quot;&#x27;help[ing] himself to cash from the WJC office, my cash.&quot; However, internal WJC documents seemed to suggest that a friction had developed between Singer and Bronfman over Singer&#x27;s position on various internal WJC political matters, including the perception that he was insufficiently advocating the candidacy of Edgar Bronfman&#x27;s son Matthew to the presidency of the WJC.

In May 2007, Bronfman stood down as the president of the WJC, having served in the post for 28 years.

<text>Linda Eder (; born February 3, 1961) is an American singer and actress. She originated the role of Lucy Harris in the Broadway musical &quot;Jekyll &amp; Hyde&quot;, for which she was nominated for the Drama Desk Award.

==Biography==

Eder was born in Tucson, Arizona, on February 3, 1961, and raised in Garrison, Minnesota. Her parents, Georg (from Austria) and Laila (from Norway), exposed her to music at an early age. She cites Judy Garland, Barbra Streisand, and Eileen Farrell as her childhood inspiration. Eder cites Garland, specifically, as her greatest influence.

Before her work on Broadway, Eder sang in clubs in Minneapolis and performed at Harrah&#x27;s Casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey. In 1988 she won the talent show &quot;Star Search&quot;, where her performance caught the notice of Frank Wildhorn. She signed with RCA Records and starred in two 1991 stagings of Wildhorn&#x27;s musical &quot;Svengali&quot; (the 1990 world premiere and 1995–96 national tour), the 1997 Broadway production of his &quot;Jekyll &amp; Hyde&quot;, and the 2003 World Premiere of &quot;Camille Claudel&quot;. During those years, Eder recorded several CDs on Angel Records and Atlantic Records. Wildhorn and Eder married in 1998 and divorced in 2004; they have one son, Jake. Eder won the Theater World Award (1996–97) for Best Broadway Debut in &quot;Jekyll &amp; Hyde&quot;.

Since her divorce from Wildhorn, Eder has mainly performed in live concerts at venues including the Greek Theater, Radio City Music Hall, Carnegie Hall, and the Kennedy Center. She has continued to release solo albums, including one recorded live at Skidmore College in 2014, and a 2024 delayed release of TOSOSM - The Other Side of Me - Live, recorded during her 2018 touring season of the concert series by the same name.

<text>The Rarey technique is a method of calming horses that have become vicious and fearful of humans due to abusive handling or other traumatic events. It is named for its inventor, John Solomon Rarey (1827–1866) of Groveport, Ohio, USA, who became famous for taming violent horses with it, and later for teaching it in various countries around the world.

==The technique==

Rarey began by tying one of the traumatized horse&#x27;s legs with a strap so that the horse could not stand on it. This gave him control over the horse and quickly tired the animal out. Then, Rarey would gently but firmly cause the horse to lie down on a comfortable surface. Once the horse was lying on its side, Rarey could use his weight, concentrated at a strategic point, to keep the horse from rising. While the horse was thus unable to protect itself, Rarey showed it that it was still entirely safe with him by touching and stroking it on all parts of its body. The result was that the horse learned that it could be entirely safe in Rarey&#x27;s company, and from that beginning it was relatively easy to demonstrate to the horse that it did not need to protect itself from most other humans.
