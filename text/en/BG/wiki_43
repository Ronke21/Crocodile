<text>Hillel ( &quot;Hīllēl&quot;; variously called Hillel the Elder or Hillel the Babylonian; died c. 10 CE) was a Jewish religious leader, sage and scholar associated with the development of the Mishnah and the Talmud and the founder of the House of Hillel school of &quot;tannaim&quot;. He was active during the end of the first century BCE and the beginning of the first century CE.

He is popularly known as the author of three sayings:

* &quot;If I am not for myself, who will be for me? And being for myself, what am I? And if not now, when?&quot;
* &quot;That which is hateful to you, do not do unto your fellow. That is the whole Torah; the rest is the explanation; go and learn.&quot;
* &quot;Be of the disciples of Aaron, loving peace and pursuing peace, loving mankind and drawing them close to the Torah.&quot;

== Biography ==
He came from Babylon to Israel, although he was descended from David. His descendent Judah haNasi traced his lineage through both the female lineage of the Tribe of Benjamin and the family of David.

When Josephus speaks of Hillel&#x27;s great-grandson, Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel I, as belonging to a very celebrated family, he probably refers to the glory the family owed to the activity of Hillel and Rabban Gamaliel Hazaken. Only Hillel&#x27;s brother Shebna is mentioned; he was a merchant, whereas Hillel devoted himself to studying the Torah whilst also working as a woodcutter.

Hillel lived in Jerusalem during the time of King Herod and the Roman emperor Augustus. In the Midrash compilation Sifre, the periods of Hillel&#x27;s life are made parallel to those in the life of Moses. At the age of forty Hillel went to the Land of Israel; forty years he spent in study; and the last third of his life he was the spiritual head of the Jewish people. A biographical sketch can be constructed that Hillel went to Jerusalem in the prime of his life and attained a great age. His 40 years of leadership likely covered the period of 30 BCE to 10 CE.

According to the Mishnah, Hillel went to Jerusalem with the intention of studying biblical exposition and tradition at the age of 40 in 70 BCE. The difficulties Hillel had to overcome to gain admittance to the school of Sh&#x27;maya and Abtalion, and the hardships he suffered while pursuing his aim, are told in the Talmud. Some time later, Hillel succeeded in settling a question concerning the sacrificial ritual in a manner that showed his superiority over the Bnei Bathyra, who were at that time the heads of the Sanhedrin. On that occasion, it is narrated, they voluntarily resigned their position as Nasi (President) in favor of Hillel. After their resignation, Hillel was recognized as the highest authority among the Pharisees (predecessors to Rabbinic Judaism). Hillel was the head of the great school, associated at first with Menahem the Essene (who might be the same Menahem the Essene as the one mentioned by Flavius Josephus in relation to King Herod), and later with Shammai (Hillel&#x27;s peer in the teaching of Jewish Law).

According to the Jerusalem Talmud (&quot;Nedarim&quot; 5:6), Hillel the Elder had eighty pairs of disciples, the oldest being Jonathan ben Uzziel and the youngest Yohanan ben Zakkai.

Whatever Hillel&#x27;s position, his authority was sufficient to introduce those decrees handed down in his name. The most famous of his enactments was the &quot;Prozbul&quot;, an institution that, in spite of the law concerning cancellation of debts in the Sabbatical year ensured the repayment of loans. The motive for this institution was the &quot;repair of the world&quot;, i.e., of the social order, because this legal innovation protected both the creditor against the loss of his property, and the needy against being refused the loan of money for fear of loss. A similar tendency is found in another of Hillel&#x27;s institutions, having reference to the sale of houses. These two are the only institutions handed down in Hillel&#x27;s name, although the words that introduce the &quot;prozbul&quot; show that there were others. Hillel&#x27;s judicial activity may be inferred from the decision by which he confirmed the legitimacy of some Alexandrians whose origin was disputed, by interpreting the marriage document (&quot;ketubah&quot;) of their mother in her favor. No other official acts are mentioned in the sources.

According to the Midrash Hillel lived to be 120 years old, like Moses, Yohanan ben Zakkai, and Rabbi Akiva.

== Notable sayings ==

Several of Hillel&#x27;s teachings are explained by comparison to what Shammai (Hillel&#x27;s principal adversary, rival or disputant) taught on the same subject.

Some of Hillel the Elder&#x27;s teachings remain commonly known. However, at least two other notable Hillels came after him, and some scholars have suggested that some sayings attributed to &quot;Hillel&quot; may have originated from them.

The saying of Hillel that introduces the collection of his maxims in the Mishnaic treatise Pirkei Avot mentions Aaron &quot;HaKohen&quot; (the high priest) as the great model to be imitated in his love of peace, in his love for his fellow man, and in his leading mankind to a knowledge of the Law (Pirkei Avoth 1:12). In mentioning these characteristics, which the aggadah attributes to Moses&#x27; brother, Hillel stated his own prominent virtues. He considered &quot;love of his fellow man&quot; the kernel of Jewish teaching.

=== The Oral Law ===
A gentile came to Shammai and asked how many Torahs there were. Shammai answered &quot;two&quot;: the written Torah and the Oral Torah. The gentile did not believe him and asked to be converted on condition he only had to learn the written Torah. Shammai sent him away. The gentile went to Hillel who converted him and then started teaching him the Torah(s). He started with teaching him the Hebrew alphabet: the first letter is &quot;Aleph&quot;, the next letter is &quot;bet&quot;, etc. The next day, Hillel taught him: the first letter is &quot;Tav&quot;, the next letter is &quot;shin&quot;, etc. (the alphabet backwards). The convert said that this was different to what he had been taught the previous day. Hillel replied that in the same way you need an oral teaching to learn the written alphabet, so you need an oral explanation to understand the written Torah.

=== The Golden Rule ===
The comparative response to the challenge of a prospective convert who asked that the Torah be explained to him while he stood on one foot, illustrates the character differences between Shammai and Hillel. Shammai dismissed the man. Hillel gently chided the man: &quot;What is hateful to you, do not do to your fellow: this is the whole Torah; the rest is the explanation; go and learn.&quot; This rule is commonly called the Golden Rule, which has been practiced by a wide range of peoples, and through Christianity, the Enlightenment Age and Kant&#x27;s categorical imperative is practised to this day.

=== Love of peace ===

The exhortation to love peace emanated from Hillel&#x27;s most characteristic traits—from that proverbial meekness and mildness—as in the saying: &quot;Let a man be always humble and patient like Hillel, and not passionate like Shammai&quot;. Hillel&#x27;s gentleness and patience are illustrated in an anecdote that describes how two men made a bet on the question of whether Hillel could be made angry. Though they questioned him and made insulting allusions to his Babylonian origin, they were unsuccessful.

===Obligations to self and others===
From the doctrine of man&#x27;s likeness to God, Hillel deduced man&#x27;s duty to care for his own body. According to Midrash Leviticus rabbah he said &quot;As in a theater and circus the statues of the king must be kept clean by him to whom they have been entrusted, so the bathing of the body is a duty of man, who was created in the image of the almighty King of the world.&quot; In this work, Hillel calls his soul a guest upon earth, toward which he must fulfill the duties of charity.

In Avot, Hillel stated &quot;If I am not for myself, who is for me? And being for my own self, what am &#x27;I&#x27;? And if not now, when?&quot; The third part contains the admonition to postpone no duty, the same admonition he gave with reference to study: &quot;Say not, &#x27;When I have free time I shall study&#x27;; for you may perhaps never have any free time.&quot;

The precept that one should not separate oneself from the community, Hillel paraphrases (referencing ) in the following saying: &quot;Appear neither naked nor clothed, neither sitting nor standing, neither laughing nor weeping.&quot; Man should not appear different from others in his outward deportment; he should always regard himself as a part of the whole, thereby showing that love of man Hillel taught. The feeling of love for one&#x27;s neighbor shows itself also in his exhortation (Avot 2:4).

How far his love of man went may be seen from an example that shows that benevolence must be given with regard to the needs of the poor. Thus, Hillel provided a riding horse to a man of good family who became poor, in order that he not be deprived of his customary physical exercise; he also gave him a slave, that he might be served.

===Other maxims===
* &quot;Do not separate yourself from the community; do not believe in yourself until the day you die; do not judge your fellow until you have reached their place; do not say something inappropriate, for it will then be appropriated; and do not say, &#x27;When I am free I will study,&#x27; for perhaps you will not become free.&quot;
* &quot;Whosoever destroys one soul, it is as though he had destroyed the entire world. And whosoever saves a life, it is as though he had saved the entire world.&quot;
* &quot;A name gained is a name lost.&quot;
* &quot;Where there are no men, strive to be a man!&quot;
* &quot;My humiliation is my exaltation; my exaltation is my humiliation.&quot;

=== The study of Torah ===
The many anecdotes according to which Hillel made proselytes, correspond to the third part of his maxim: &quot;Bring men to the Law.&quot; A later source (Avot of Rabbi Nathan) gives the following explanation of the teaching: Hillel stood in the gate of Jerusalem one day and saw the people on their way to work. &quot;How much,&quot; he asked, &quot;will you earn to-day?&quot; One said: &quot;A denarius&quot;; the second: &quot;Two denarii.&quot; &quot;What will you do with the money?&quot; he inquired. &quot;We will provide for the necessities of life.&quot; Then said he to them: &quot;Would you not rather come and make the Torah your possession, that you may possess both this and the future world?&quot;

This narrative has the same points as the epigrammatic group of Hillel&#x27;s sayings (Avot 2:7) commencing: &quot;The more flesh, the more worms,&quot; and closing with the words: &quot;Whoever has acquired the words of the Law has acquired the life of the world to come.&quot; In an Aramaic saying Hillel sounds a warning against neglect of study or its abuse for selfish purposes: &quot;Whoever would make a name (i.e. glory) loses the name; he who increases not [his knowledge] decreases; whoever learns not [in Avot of Rabbi Nathan 12: &quot;who does not serve the wise and learn&quot;] is worthy of death; whoever exploits for his own use the crown (of Torah) perishes&quot; (Avot 1:13).

==Halachic teachings==
Only a few halachic decisions have been handed down under Hillel&#x27;s name; but much of the oldest anonymous traditional literature is attributed directly to him or to the teachings of his masters. The fixation of the hermeneutical norms for Midrash and halakhic scripture exposition was first made by Hillel, in the &quot;seven rules of Hillel,&quot; which, as is told in one source, he applied on the day on which he overcame the Bnei Bathyra. On these seven rules rest the thirteen of R. Ishmael; they were epoch-making for the systematic development of the ancient Scripture exposition.

=== Hillel&#x27;s influence: &quot;House of Hillel&quot; vs. &quot;House of Shammai&quot; ===
Hillel&#x27;s disciples are generally called the &quot;House of Hillel&quot;, in contrast to Shammai&#x27;s disciples, the &quot;House of Shammai&quot;. Their controversies concern all branches of the Jewish law.

=== Hillel&#x27;s sandwich ===

During the Passover Seder (the annual commemoration of the Exodus from Egypt), one re-enacts ancient customs in the Haggadah. In the section of &quot;Korech&quot;, or &#x27;sandwich&#x27;, participants are instructed to place bitter herbs between two pieces of matzo and eat them after saying in Hebrew: &quot;This is a remembrance of Hillel in Temple times—This is what Hillel did when the Temple existed: He enwrapped the Paschal lamb, the matzo and the bitter herbs to eat them as one, in fulfillment of the verse, &quot;with matzot and maror they shall eat it.&quot;&quot;(Numbers 9:11). This sandwich apparently refers to traditional soft matzot rather than modern crisp matzot, and so would have borne a striking resemblance to a modern shawarma.

In modern times, when there is no paschal lamb, the Babylonian Talmud requires the practice of emulating Hillel&#x27;s example by making a sandwich of matzo and maror (the &quot;bitter herbs&quot;: either lettuce, endive, or horseradish). The maror, if lettuce or endive, is dipped in the meal&#x27;s traditional charoset (a finely chopped sweet mixture of fruits and nuts; among Ashkenazi Jews it is typically made of apples, walnuts, red wine, cinnamon, and honey) just before the sandwich is made. In Ashkenazi families where grated horseradish is used for the maror instead of lettuce or endive, the maror cannot be dipped in the charoset, so it is the custom to spread the bottom piece of matzah with horseradish maror, cover it with a pile of charoset, and top it with another piece of matzah to make a hot-sweet sandwich.

== In contemporary culture ==
Hillel&#x27;s reputation is such that his influence extends beyond Judaism and has entered into popular culture.
* Beginning in the late 1940s, soap-maker Emanuel Bronner (February 1, 1908 – March 7, 1997), a German-Jewish immigrant to the United States, featured the maxims of Hillel on millions of product labels. He referred to these as &quot;Rabbi Hillel&#x27;s Moral ABC.&quot; The label texts were later collected into a self-published book titled &quot;The Moral ABC I &amp; II&quot; by Dr. Emmanuel Bronner. On page 23, Bronner wrote, &quot;Rabbi Hillel taught Jesus to unite the whole human race in our Eternal Father&#x27;s great, All-One-God-Faith.&quot; On page 39, he stated that &quot;Small minds discuss people. Average minds discuss events. Great minds teach Rabbi Hillel&#x27;s Moral ABC.&quot; These references to Rabbi Hillel remain in print in the book and on the million more soap labels manufactured since Dr. Bronner&#x27;s death.
* Primo Levi&#x27;s 1982 novel about Jewish partisans in World War II, If Not Now, When? (novel).
* In &quot;The Chosen Image: Television&#x27;s Portrayal of Jewish Themes and Characters&quot; by Jonathan Pearl and Judith Pearl (MacFarland, 2005), the authors mention &quot;episodes of [the 1960s series] &#x27;Have Gun – Will Travel&#x27; [in which] Paladin, the program&#x27;s erudite gunslinger [...] employs an adage from the sage Hillel&quot;—and they continue by noting that &quot;Rabbi Hillel&#x27;s popularity as disseminator of wisdom extended to a 1973 episode of &#x27;Medical Center,&#x27; where series star Dr. Gannon appears to be an admirer of him as well&quot;
* In a National Public Radio transcript of a broadcast called &quot;Modern Lessons From Hillel,&quot; which originally aired on the news show &quot;All Things Considered&quot; with co-hosts Melissa Block and Robert Siegel on September 7, 2010, Siegel said: &quot;Well, I mentioned something that a great Jewish sage, Rabbi Hillel, said not long before the time of Jesus. A man asked Rabbi Hillel to teach him the entire Torah, the five books of Moses, while standing on one foot. ...&quot;
* In &quot;The Jewish Story Finder: A Guide to 668 Tales Listing Subjects and Sources&quot; by Sharon Barcan Elswit (McFarland, 2012), the famous story of the man who stands on one foot is told, including this passage, &quot;The man then goes to the great Rabbi Hillel. He tells Hillel that he does not have much time. ... Rabbi Hillel replies ...&quot;
* In &quot;Do Justly, Love Mercy, and Walk Humbly with God,&quot; Dale Gunnar Renlund of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, spoke about Hillel the Elder to a worldwide audience in a live broadcast of General Conference in October 2020: &quot;The importance of not mistreating others is highlighted in an anecdote about Hillel the Elder, a Jewish scholar who lived in the first century before Christ. One of Hillel&#x27;s students was exasperated by the complexity of the Torah—the five books of Moses with their 613 commandments and associated rabbinic writings. The student challenged Hillel to explain the Torah using only the time that Hillel could stand on one foot. Hillel may not have had great balance but accepted the challenge. He quoted from Leviticus, saying, &quot;Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.&quot; Hillel then concluded: &quot;That which is hateful unto you, do not do to your neighbor. This is the whole of the Torah; the rest is commentary. Go forth and study.&quot;
*In Episode 5 of the Christian television drama &quot;The Chosen&quot;, Hillel&#x27;s phrase &quot;If not now, when?&quot; is a key line exchanged between Jesus and Mary. In the second season, Pharisees Yanni and Shmuel discuss the politics of the Sanhedrin, which they see as dividable into two schools of thought: The School of Hillel and the School of Shammai. 
*Hillel&#x27;s maxim &quot;If not now, when?&quot; features prominently in the 2018 film &quot;Robin Hood&quot;. It is repeated several times throughout the film and appears on a title card afterwards (without citation).

<text>The Apostolic Palace is the official residence of the Pope, the head of the Catholic Church, located in Vatican City. It is also known as the Papal Palace, the Palace of the Vatican and the Vatican Palace. The Vatican itself refers to the building as the Palace of Sixtus V, in honor of Pope Sixtus V, who built most of the present form of the palace.

The building contains the papal apartments, various offices of the Catholic Church and the Holy See, private and public chapels, Vatican Museums, and the Vatican Library, including the Sistine Chapel, Raphael Rooms, and Borgia Apartment. The modern tourist can see these last and other parts of the palace, but other parts, such as the Sala Regia (Regal Room) and Cappella Paolina, had long been closed to tourists, though the Sala Regia allowed occasional tourism by 2019. The Scala Regia (Regal Staircase) can be viewed from one end and used to enter the Sala Regia. The Cappella Paolina remains closed to tourists.

== History ==
In the 5th century, Pope Symmachus built a papal palace close to the Old St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica which served an alternative residence to the Lateran Palace. The construction of a second fortified palace was sponsored by Pope Eugene III and extensively modified under Pope Innocent III in the twelfth century.

Upon returning to Rome in 1377 after the interlude of the Avignon Papacy, which saw Rome subject to civil unrest and the abandonment of several Christian monuments, the popes chose to reside first at Basilica di Santa Maria in Trastevere and then at Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore. The Vatican Palace had fallen into disrepair from lack of upkeep, and the Lateran Palace underwent two destructive fires, in 1307 and 1361, which resulted in irreparable harm. In 1447, Pope Nicholas V razed the ancient fortified palace of Eugene III to erect a new building, the current Apostolic Palace.

In the 15th century, the palace was placed under the authority of a prefect. This position of apostolic prefecture lasted from the 15th century until the 1800s, when the Papal States fell into economic difficulties. In 1884, when this post was reviewed in light of saving money, Pope Leo XIII created a committee to administer the palace.

The major additions and decorations of the palace are the work of the following popes for 150 years. Construction of the current version of the palace began on 30 April 1589 under Pope Sixtus V and its various intrinsic parts were completed by later successors, Pope Urban VII, Pope Innocent XI and Pope Clement VIII. In the 20th century, Pope Pius XI built a monumental art gallery and museum entrance.

Construction of the Papal Palace (also known as the Apostolic Palace or Vatican Palace) at the Vatican in Vatican City, took place mainly between 1471 and 1605. Covering 162,000 square metres (1,743,753 square feet), it contains the papal apartments, offices of the Roman Catholic Church and Holy See, chapels, Vatican Library, museums and art galleries.

== Structure ==

The Apostolic Palace is run by the Prefecture of the Pontifical Household. The &quot;palace&quot; is more accurately a series of self-contained buildings within the well-recognized outer structure which is arranged around the Courtyard of Sixtus V (Cortile di Sisto V). It is located northeast of St Peter&#x27;s Basilica and adjacent to the Bastion of Nicholas V and Palace of Gregory XIII.

The Apostolic Palace houses both residential and support offices of various functions as well as administrative offices not focused on the life and functions of the Pope himself.

=== Sistine Chapel ===
Perhaps the best known of the palace chapels is the Sistine Chapel named in honor of Sixtus IV (Francesco della Rovere). It is famous for its decoration that was frescoed throughout by Renaissance artists including Michelangelo, Sandro Botticelli, Pietro Perugino, Pinturicchio, Domenico Ghirlandaio, and others.

One of the primary functions of the chapel is as a venue for the election of each successive Pope in a conclave of the College of Cardinals. In this closed-door election, the cardinals choose a successor to the traditional first Pope, Peter, who according to tradition is buried in the crypts of nearby St. Peter&#x27;s Church.

===Raphael Rooms===
This suite of rooms is famous for its frescos by a large team of artists working under Raphael. They were originally intended as a suite of apartments for Pope Julius II. He commissioned Raphael, then a relatively young artist from Urbino, and his studio in 1508 or 1509 to redecorate the existing interiors of the rooms entirely. It was possibly Julius&#x27; intent to outshine the apartments of his predecessor (and rival) Pope Alexander VI, as the &quot;Stanze&quot; are directly above Alexander&#x27;s Borgia Apartments. They are on the second floor, overlooking the south side of the Belvedere Courtyard.

From east to west, as a visitor would have entered the apartment, but reversing the sequence in which the &quot;Stanze&quot; were frescoed, and also the route of the modern visitor, the rooms are the Sala di Constantino (&quot;Hall of Constantine&quot;), the Stanza di Eliodoro (&quot;Room of Heliodorus&quot;), the Stanza della Segnatura (the earliest and the most admired) (&quot;Room of the Signature&quot;) and the Stanza dell&#x27;Incendio del Borgo (&quot;The Room of the &quot;Fire in the Borgo&quot;&quot;).

After the death of Julius in 1513, with two rooms frescoed, Pope Leo X continued the program. Following Raphael&#x27;s death in 1520, his assistants Gianfrancesco Penni, Giulio Romano and Raffaellino del Colle finished the project with the frescoes in the &quot;Sala di Costantino&quot;.

=== Borgia Apartments ===

The Borgia Apartments is a suite of rooms in the palace adapted for personal use by Pope Alexander VI (Rodrigo de Borja). He commissioned the Italian painter Pinturicchio to lavishly decorate the apartments with frescoes.

The paintings and frescoes, which were executed between 1492 and 1494, drew on a complex iconographic program that used themes from medieval encyclopedias, adding an eschatological layer of meaning and celebrating the supposedly divine origins of the Borgias.

The rooms are variously considered a part of the Vatican Library and Vatican Museums. Some of the rooms are now used for the Vatican Collection of Modern Religious Art, inaugurated by Pope Paul VI in 1973.

=== Clementine Hall ===

The Clementine Hall was established in the 16th century by Pope Clement VIII in honor of Pope Clement I, the third pope. Like other chapels and apartments in the palace, the hall is notable for its large collection of frescos and other art.

=== Loggias ===

The loggias are corridors designed by Donato Bramante and decorated by Raphael with frescoes, which depict 52 biblical events divided into bays in groups of four. They served as inspiration to Italian architect Giacomo Quarenghi while working on the Raphael loggias in the Hermitage Museum.

<text>RSTS () is a multi-user time-sharing operating system developed by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC, now part of Hewlett-Packard) for the PDP-11 series of 16-bit minicomputers. The first version of RSTS (RSTS-11, Version 1) was implemented in 1970 by DEC software engineers that developed the TSS-8 time-sharing operating system for the PDP-8. The last version of RSTS (RSTS/E, Version 10.1) was released in September 1992. RSTS-11 and RSTS/E are usually referred to just as &quot;RSTS&quot; and this article will generally use the shorter form. RSTS-11 supports the BASIC programming language, an extended version called BASIC-PLUS, developed under contract by &quot;Evans Griffiths &amp; Hart&quot; of Boston. Starting with RSTS/E version 5B, DEC added support for additional programming languages by emulating the execution environment of the RT-11 and RSX-11 operating systems.

==Acronyms and abbreviations==

*BTSS (Basic Time Sharing System – never marketed) – The first name for RSTS.
*CCL (Concise Command Language) – equivalent to a command to run a program kept in the Command Line Interpreter.
*CIL (Core Image Library) – A container file format used to hold one or more standalone (bootable) programs and operating systems, such as RSTS through version 6A.
*CILUS (Core Image Library Update and Save) – DOS-11 program to manipulate a CIL file.
*CLI (Command Line Interpreter) – See Command-line interface.
*CUSPs (Commonly Used System Programs) – System management applications like Task Manager or Registry Editor on Microsoft Windows. On RSTS-11, CUSPs were written in BASIC-Plus just like user programs.
*DCL (Digital Command Language) – See DIGITAL Command Language.
*DTR (DATATRIEVE) – programming language
*FIP (File Information Processing) – resident area for issuing file requests
*FIRQB (File Information Request Queue Block) – A data structure containing information about file requests.
*KBM (Keyboard Monitor) – Analogous to Command Line Interpreter.
*LAT (Local Area Transport) – Digital&#x27;s predecessor to TCP/IP
*MFD (Master File Directory) – Root directory of file system.
*PBS (Print Batch Services)
*PIP (Peripheral Interchange Program)
*PPN (Project Programmer Number) – Analogous to GID and UID in Unix.
*RDC (Remote Diagnostics Console) – A replacement front panel for a PDP-11 which used a serial connection to the console terminal or a modem instead of lights and toggle switches to control the CPU.
*RSTS-11 (Resource Sharing Time Sharing System) – The first commercial product name for RSTS
*RSTS/E (Resource Sharing Timesharing System Extended) – The current implementation of RSTS.
*RTS (Run Time System) – Read only segment of code provided by the supplier which would be mapped into the high end of a 32K, 16-bit word address space that a user program would use to interface with the operating system. Only one copy of an RTS would be loaded into RAM, but would be mapped into the address space of any user program that required it. In essence, shared, re-entrant code, to reduce RAM requirements, by sharing the code between any programs that required it.
*RTSS (Resource Time Sharing System – never marketed) – The second name for RSTS
*SATT (Storage Allocation Truth Table) a series of 512KB blocks on every disk that indicated if the block, or cluster, on the whole disk was allocated on the disk. Bitwise, a 1 indicated a cluster was in use; a 0 indicated it was not in use.
*SIL (Save Image Library) – The OS container file format after the RSTS system generation procedure was switched from one using DOS-11 to one running natively on RSTS/E, called that by analogy to the CIL it replaced.
*SILUS (Save Image Library Update and Save) – The program to create SIL files, called that by analogy to the (unrelated) DOS-11 CILUS program it replaced.
*UFD (User File Directory) – A user&#x27;s home directory. Root directory of a file system.
*XRB (Transfer Request Block) – A data structure containing information about other types of system requests that do not use FIRQBs to convey the information
==Development==

===1970s===
The kernel of RSTS was programmed in the assembly language MACRO-11, compiled and installed to a disk using the CILUS program, running on a DOS-11 operating system. RSTS booted into an extended version of the BASIC programming language which DEC called &quot;BASIC-PLUS&quot;. All of the system software CUSPS for the operating system, including the programs for resource accounting, login, logout, and managing the system, were written in BASIC-PLUS. From 1970 to 1973, RSTS ran in only 56K bytes of magnetic core memory (64 kilobytes including the memory-mapped I/O space). This would allow a system to have up to 16 terminals with a maximum of 17 jobs. The maximum program size was 16K bytes. By the end of 1973 DEC estimated there were 150 licensed systems running RSTS.

In 1973, memory management support was included in RSTS (now RSTS/E) for the newer DEC PDP-11/40 and PDP-11/45 minicomputers (the PDP-11/20 was only supported under RSTS-11). The introduction of memory management in the newer PDP-11 computers not only meant these machines were able to address four times the amount of memory (18-bit addressing, 256K bytes), it also paved the way for the developers to separate user mode processes from the core of the kernel.

In 1975, memory management support was again updated for the newer 22-bit addressable PDP-11/70. RSTS systems could now be expanded to use as much as two megabytes of memory running up to 63 jobs. The RTS and CCL concepts were introduced although they had to be compiled in during &quot;SYSGEN&quot;. Multi-terminal service was introduced which would allow a single job the ability to control multiple terminals (128 total). Large-message send/receive and interprocess communication became very sophisticated and efficient. By August there are 1,200 licensed systems.

In 1977, the installation process for RSTS was no longer dependent on DOS-11. The RSTS kernel could now be compiled under the RT-11 RTS, formatted as a kernel file with RT-11 SILUS, and copied to the system or other disks, while the computer was time-sharing. The BASIC-PLUS RTS (as well as RT-11, RSX-11, TECO and third party RTSs) all ran as user mode processes, independent of the RSTS kernel. A systems manager could now decide during the bootstrap phase which RTS to run as the systems default Keyboard Monitor (KBM). By now, there were some 3,100 licensed systems.

In 1978, the final memory management update was included for all machines that could support 22-bit addressing. RSTS could now use the maximum amount of memory available to a PDP-11 (4 megabytes). Support was also included for SUPERVISORY mode which made RSTS the first DEC operating system with this capability. DECnet was also supported as well as remote diagnostics from field service technicians at the RDC in Colorado Springs, Colorado (a DEC subscription service). By the end of the decade, there are over 5,000 licensed systems.

===1980s===
In 1981, support for separate instruction and data space for users with Unibus machines (PDP-11/44, PDP-11/45, PDP-11/55 and PDP-11/70) provided an extension to the memory constraints of an individual program. Compiling programs to use separate instruction and data space would soon give a program up to 64 KB for instructions, and up to 64 KB for buffering data. The DCL RTS was included as well as support for the newer revision of DECnet III.

By 1983, with an estimated 15,000 DEC machines running RSTS/E, V8.0-06 included support for the smallest 18-bit PDP-11 sold by DEC (the MicroPDP-11). A pre-generated kernel and CUSPS were included in this distribution to make installation on the MicroPDP-11 easier. DEC sold the pre-generated version on the MicroPDP-11 as MicroRSTS at a reduced price, however users needed to purchase the full version if they had a need to generate their own kernel. The file system was upgraded and given the designation RSTS Directory Structure 1 (RDS1). All previous versions of the RSTS file system are given the designation RDS0. The newer file system was designed to support more than 1700 user accounts. &quot;It is now thought that there are well over 10,000 licensed users and at least an equal number of unlicensed users!&quot;.

From 1985 to 1989, RSTS became a mature product in the Version 9 revisions. DCL was installed as the primary RTS and the file system was again upgraded (now RDS1.2) to support new user account features. Passwords were encrypted using a modified DES algorithm instead of limited to six (6) characters stored in DEC Radix-50 format. Before Version 9, there was a non-user system account in the project (group) zero (the designation is [0,1]), and all accounts in project number 1 were privileged (not unlike the root account on Unix systems). With the release of Version 9, additional accounts could be created for project zero, and multiple privileges could be individually set for any account. Support for the LAT protocol was included, as well as the ability to run the newest version of DECnet IV. These network enhancements give any user connected to a terminal through a DECserver the ability to communicate with a RSTS machine, just as easily as with a VAX running VMS. The DCL command structure between DEC operating systems also contributed to the familiar look and feel:

This is not just another pseudo command file processor; it is based on VMS features. The DCL command file processor is fully supported and integrated in RSTS through extensive changes to DCL and the monitor. DCL executes command files as part of your job; therefore, no pseudo keyboard or forcing of commands to your keyboard is necessary (as with ATPK).

===1990s===
In 1994, DEC sold most of its PDP-11 software business to Mentec. Digital continued to support its own PDP-11 customers for a short period after with the assistance of Mentec staff.

In 1997, Digital and Mentec granted anyone wishing to use RSTS 9.6 or earlier for non-commercial, hobby purposes no-cost license. The license is only valid on the SIMH PDP-11 emulator. The license also covers some other Digital operating systems. Copies of the license are included in an authorized software kit available for download on the official website of the SIMH emulator.

==Operation==

===Communication===
RSTS uses a serial communication connection to interact with the operator. The connection might be a local computer terminal with a 20 mA current loop interface, an RS-232 interface (either local serial port or remote connection via modem), or by an Ethernet connection using DECnet or LAT. As many as 128 terminals (using multi-terminal service) can connect to a RSTS system, running a maximum of 63 jobs (depending on the processor being used, the amount of memory and disk space, and the system load). Most RSTS systems had far fewer terminals. Users can also submit jobs to be run in batch mode. There is also a batch program called &quot;ATPK&quot; that allows users to run a series of commands on an imaginary terminal (pseudo-terminal) in semi-interactive mode similar to batch commands in MS-DOS.

===Login [Project, Programmer]===
Users connect to the system by typing the LOGIN command (or HELLO) at a logged-out terminal and pressing return. Typing any command at a logged-out terminal starts the LOGIN program which then interprets the command. If it is one of the commands which were allowed to be used by a user that is not yet logged in (&quot;Logged Out&quot;), then the associated program for that command is CHAINed, otherwise the message &quot;Please say HELLO&quot; is printed on the terminal. Prior to Version 9, a user can also initiate a 1 line login, however this leaves the user&#x27;s password on the screen for anyone else in the room to view (examples follow):

or

or

The status of a terminal can be determined from the command responses, printed by the command interpreter. A logged-in user communicating with the BASIC-PLUS KBM (key board monitor) is given the prompt &quot;Ready&quot; and a user who is logged out is given the prompt &quot;Bye&quot;.

A user logs in by supplying their PPN number and password. User numbers consist of a project number (equivalent to a group number in Unix), a comma, and a programmer number. Both numbers are in the range of 0 to 254, with special exceptions. When specifying an account, the project and programmer number are enclosed in brackets. A typical user number can be [10,5] (project 10, programmer 5), [2,146], [254,31], or [200,220], etc. When a user is running a system program while logged out (because the system manager has enabled it) their PPN number is [0,0], and appears in the SYSTAT CUSP as **,**. Thus that is not a valid account number. If the user specifies a slash (/) instead of a comma between the project number and programmer number, a system wide message stored in [1,2]NOTICE.TXT (equivalent to the Unix motd) will not be displayed at login.

===System and user accounts===
In every project, the programmer number 0 is usually reserved to as a group account, as it can be referenced by the special symbol #. If one&#x27;s user number is [20,103], a reference to a file name beginning with &quot;#&quot; refers to a file stored in the account of the user number [20,0]. This feature is useful in educational environments, as programmer number 0 can be issued to the instructor of a class, and the individual students given accounts with the same project number, and the instructor can store in his account files marked as shared only for that project number (which would be students in that class only, and no other).

Two special classes of project numbers exist. The project number 0 is generally reserved for system software, and prior to Version 9 there is only 1 project 0 account (named [0,1]). Programmers in the project number 1 are privileged accounts, equivalent to the single account &quot;root&quot; on Unix systems, except that the account numbers [1,0] through [1,254] are all privileged accounts. As of Version 9, any account can be granted specific privileges by the systems manager.

The account [0,1] is used to store the operating system file itself, all run-time library systems, and certain system files relating to booting the system (author&#x27;s comments appear on the right in bold):

 DIR [0,1]

 Total of 1952 blocks in 11 files in SY:[0,1]
 (&quot;Editor&#x27;s note: This directory listing is prior to Version 9.&quot;)

The DIR command is an installed CCL equivalent to a RUN command for the DIRECT program. [0,1] is the account number (and directory name) of the operating system storage account. It would be referred to as &quot;project number 0, programmer number 1&quot;.

The numbers shown after each file represent its size in disk blocks, a block being 512 bytes or 1/2 kilobyte (K). &quot;C&quot; indicates the file is contiguous (is stored as one file without being separated into pieces, similar to files on a Microsoft Windows system after a drive has been defragmented), while &quot;P&quot; indicates it is specially protected (cannot be deleted, even by a privileged user, unless the P bit is cleared by separate command). The numbers in brackets (like &quot;&lt; 40&gt;&quot;) represent the protections for the file, which is always displayed in decimal. Protections indicate if the file may be seen by any other user, by other users with the same programmer number, if the file is read only or if it may be altered by another user, and whether the file may be executed by an ordinary user giving them additional privileges. These protection codes are very similar to the r, w and x protections in Unix and similar operating systems such as BSD and Linux. Code 60 is equivalent to a private file, code 63 is a private non-deletable file, and 40 is a public file.

Library files are kept in account [1,1] and it is usually referenced by the logical name LB:. The account [1,2] is the system startup account (much like a Unix system starting up under root), and contains the system CUSPS that could be referenced by prefixing the CUSP name with a dollar sign ($). &quot;!&quot; is used for account [1,3], &quot;%&quot; for [1,4] and &quot;&amp;&quot; for [1,5]. The account [1,1] also had the special privilege of being the only account where a user logged in under that account is permitted to execute the POKE system call to put values into any memory in the system. Thus the account number [1,1] is the closest equivalent to &quot;root&quot; on Unix-based systems.

==Run-time environments==
One of the features of RSTS is the means for the execution of programs and the environment used to run them. The various environments allowed for programming in BASIC-PLUS, the enhanced and hard compiled BASIC-Plus-2, and in more traditional programming languages such as COBOL (eventually upgraded to COBOL-85) and FORTRAN IV (eventually upgraded to FORTRAN-77). Other languages were supported such as DIBOL and MUMPS. These environments were separate from each other such that one could start a program from one environment and the system would switch to a different environment while running a different program, and then return the user to the original environment they started with. These environments were referred to as a Runtime System (&quot;RTS)&quot;. The term for the command line interface that most of these RTSs had was the &quot;KBM&quot;. Prior to Version 9, the systems manager needed to define which RTS the system would start under, and it had to be one that would execute compiled programs.

A systems manager may also install special CCL (concise command language) commands, which take precedence over all KBM commands (with the exception of DCL). A CCL is analogous to a shortcut to a program on a Windows system or a symbolic link on Unix-based systems. CCLs are installed as a memory-resident command either during startup, or dynamically while the system is running by a system&#x27;s manager (i.e.: it is not permanent like a disk file).

When logged in, a user can &quot;SWITCH&quot; to any of these environments, type language statements in the BASIC-PLUS programming language, issue RUN commands to specific programs, or issue a special command called a CCL to execute a program with command options.

Most RSTS systems managers generated the kernel to include the &quot;Control-T&quot; one line status option which could tell the user what program they were running, under what RTS the program was using, how much memory the program was taking, how much it could expand to, and how much memory the RTS was using.

===BASIC-PLUS===
Programs written in BASIC-PLUS ran under the BASIC RTS, which allowed them up to 32K bytes of memory (out of 64K total). The language was interpreted, each different keyword being internally converted to a unique byte code and the variables and data being indexed and stored separately within the memory space. The internal byte-code format was known as PCODE. When the interactive SAVE command was issued, the BASIC Plus RTS simply saved the working memory area to a disk file with a &quot;.BAC&quot; extension. Although this format was undocumented, two Electronic Engineering undergraduates from Southampton University in the UK (Nick de Smith and David Garrod) developed a decompiler that could reverse engineer BAC files into their original BASIC-Plus source, complete with original line numbers and variable names (both subsequently worked for DEC). The rest of the memory was used by the BASIC RTS itself. If one wrote programs in a language that permitted true binary executables such as BASIC-Plus-2, FORTRAN-IV, or Macro Assembler, then the amount of memory available would be 56K (8K allocated to the RTS). The standard BASIC-PLUS prompt is the &quot;Ready&quot; response, pressing Control-T displays status (example):
===DCL (Digital Command Language)===
Starting with Version 9, DCL became the primary startup RTS even though it does not have the ability to execute binary programs. This became possible with the advent of the disappearing RSX RTS (see below). DCL was incorporated into all of the recent versions of DEC&#x27;s operating systems (RSX-11, RT-11, VMS, and later OpenVMS) for compatibility. The standard DCL prompt is the dollar &quot;$&quot; sign (example):

$ write 0 &quot;Hello World, it is &quot;+F$TIME()
Hello World, it is 01-Jan-08 10:20 PM
$ inquire p1 &quot;Press Control-T for 1 line status:&quot;

1748K - 1751K ( 4K) (User) RMSRES LIB
1752K - 2043K ( 292K) ** XBUF **
2044K - *** END ***


===RSX (Realtime System eXecutive)===
Programs that were written for the RSX RTS such as COBOL, Macro Assembler, or later releases of BASIC-Plus-2, could use the maximum amount of memory available for a binary program (56K due to the requirements of an RTS needing the top 8K to use for itself). RSTS Version 7 and later allowed the RSX RTS to be included in the kernel, making it completely &quot;disappear&quot; from the user address space, thus allowing 64K bytes of memory for user programs.

Programs got around the limitations of the amount of available memory by using libraries (when permissible), by complicated overlay strategies, or by calling other programs (&quot;Chaining&quot;) and passing them commands and data in a shared memory area called &quot;Core Common,&quot; among other practices. 

When RSX is the default KBM, the standard RSX prompt (both logged in and logged out) is the &quot;&gt;&quot; (or MCR &quot;Monitor Console Routine&quot;) sign (example):

&gt;run
Please type HELLO
&gt;HELLO 1,1;SECRET
&gt;run
?What?
&gt;help
Valid keyboard commands are:

Total of 35 blocks in 4 files in SY:[1,2]


===RT-11===
The RT-11 RTS emulated the Single Job version of the RT-11 distribution. Like the RSX emulation, RT-11 occupied the top 8K of memory, leaving the bottom 56K for CUSPS, programs written in FORTRAN-IV or Macro Assembler. When RT-11 is the default KBM, the standard RT-11 prompt (both logged in and logged out) is the &quot;.&quot; sign (example):
.VERSION
Please type HELLO

.HELLO 1,1;SECRET

.VERSION

===TECO (Text Editor and COrrector)===
The TECO editor was itself implemented as an RTS to maximize the amount of memory available for the editing buffer, and also because it was first implemented in RSTS V5B, before the release of the general purpose runtime systems (RSX and RT11). TECO was the only RTS distributed with RSTS that did not contain a built-in KBM. The user would start up TECO (like any other program) by running a TECO program (TECO.TEC). TECO and the affine QEDIT were the direct ancestors of the first UNIX-based text editor, ED. Most RSTS systems used CCL&#x27;s to create a file (MAKE filespec), edit a file (TECO filespec), or run a TECO program (MUNG filespec, data). The following program is an example of how TECO could be used to calculate pi (currently set to 20 digits):

==RSTS easter eggs==

===System start-up (INIT.SYS)===
If a user typed an unrecognized command at system boot to the &quot;Option:&quot; prompt of INIT.SYS, the startup utility, the message &quot;Type &#x27;HELP&#x27; for help&quot; was displayed. If the user subsequently typed &#x27;HELP&#x27; (including the quotes) to the prompt, the response was &quot;How amusing, anyway...&quot; followed by the actual help message.

===PDP-11 console lights===
A system manager could compile into the kernel a rotating display pattern that gave the illusion of two snakes chasing each other around the console lights. The normal kernel would give the illusion of one snake moving from right to left in the data lights across the bottom. If the system manager also compiled the &quot;lights&quot; object module the user would see an additional snake moving from left to right in the address lights across the top. This was accomplished by using supervisory mode in the versions prior to 9.0. RSX also had a similar display pattern that would appear as if two snakes were playing chicken and would run into each other in the center of the console.

===Teco easter egg===
The command &#x27;make&#x27; allowed a user to make a text file and automatically enter the TECO text editor. If a user typed &#x27;make love&#x27;, the system created a file called &#x27;love&#x27; and typed back, &#x27;Not War?&#x27;

===Open Files List===
Kevin Herbert, later working for DEC, added an undocumented feature in the 90&#x27;s to allow a user to enter to see a list of open files the user process had, complete with blocks in use and file sizes.

===Stardate===
Beginning with version 9.0, an undocumented feature would allow the system manager to change the display of the system date. RSTS became the first operating system that would display the system date as a set of numbers representing a stardate as commonly known from the TV series &quot;Star Trek&quot;.

==Add-ons by other companies==
&quot;System Industries&quot; bought the only source license for RSTS to implement an enhancement called (SImultaneous Machine ACceSs), which allowed their special disk controller to set a semaphore flag for disk access, allowing multiple WRITES to the same files on a RSTS System where the disk is shared by multiple PDP-11 RSTS systems. This feature was implemented in System Industries controllers that were attached to many DEC computers and designed by Dr. Albert Chu while he worked at System Industries.

The main innovation was use of a semaphore, a flag to indicate which processor, by cooperative sharing, has exclusive write access.

This required many changes to the way access to disks was accomplished by the RSTS operating system. The FIPS (File Information Processing System) system, that handled i/o access, was single-threaded in RSTS. To allow a disk access to stall while another machine had active access to a block, required that the FIPS could timeout a request, go to the next request and &#x27;come back&#x27; to the stalled one in a round robin fashion. The code to allow this was written by Philip Hunt while working at System Industries, in Milpitas, California. He eventually worked for Digital Equipment in the New England area in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

&quot;SIMACS&quot; was not limited to the &quot;PDP-11&quot; product line; &quot;VAXen&quot; could also use it.

==RSTS emulations==

===ROSS/V===
In 1981, Evans Griffiths &amp; Hart marketed the &quot;ROSS/V&quot; product. &quot;ROSS/V&quot; allowed all user mode processes of RSTS (CUSPS, RTSs and user programs) the ability to run unmodified under VMS on the VAX-11 machines. The code for this emulation handled all of the kernel processes that would normally be handled by a RSTS kernel running on a PDP-11. The original BASIC-PLUS language that has carried through all versions of RSTS was subcontracted by Evans Griffiths &amp; Hart, Inc. for a fixed price of $10,500.

===Other PDP-11 emulators===
RSTS and its applications can run under a number of PDP-11 emulators such as SIMH and Ersatz-11. For more information, see PDP-11.

==RSTS mascot==

===Spike and Albert===

==Versions==
RSTS was originally called &quot;BTSS&quot; (Basic Time Sharing System). Before shipment began, the name was changed from BTSS to RTSS because a product called BTSS was already being marketed by Honeywell. A simple typing mistake changed the name from RTSS to RSTS.

The addition of new memory management support and the ability to install more memory in the PDP-11/40 and PDP-11/45 led to another name change: RSTS-11 now became RSTS/E.

===Clones in the USSR===
*DOS-KP (&quot;ДОС-КП&quot;)

==Applications==
Computer bureaus sometimes deployed User-11 for RSTS/E-based data management.

<text>Cosmos is a genus, with the same common name of cosmos, consisting of flowering plants in the sunflower family.

==Name==
The generic name &quot;Cosmos&quot; derives either from the Greek κόσμος (cosmos) ‘(ordered) world’ -in reference to the neat, orderly arrangement of the floral structures - or the Greek κόσμημα (kósmima) ‘jewel’ - in reference to the jewel-like colours of the capitula (composite flowers).

==Description==
&quot;Cosmos&quot; are herbaceous perennial plants or annual plants growing tall. The leaves are simple, pinnate, or bipinnate, and arranged in opposite pairs. The flowers are produced in a capitulum with a ring of broad ray florets and a center of disc florets; flower color varies noticeably between the different species. The genus includes several ornamental plants popular in gardens. Numerous hybrids and cultivars have been selected and named.

==Distribution==
&quot;Cosmos&quot; species are native to scrub and meadowland in Mexico where most of the species occur. In the United States, some varieties may be found as far north as the Olympic Peninsula in Washington, but the range also extends through Central America to South America as far south as Paraguay. One species, &quot;C. bipinnatus&quot;, is naturalized across much of the eastern United States and eastern Canada.

It is also widespread over the high eastern plains of South Africa, where it was introduced via contaminated horsefeed during the Anglo-Boer War.

<text>Sid Meier&#x27;s Civilization III is the third installment of the &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Civilization&quot; turn-based strategy video game series. It was released in 2001, and followed by &quot;Civilization IV&quot;. Unlike the original game, &quot;Civilization III&quot; was not designed by Sid Meier, but by Jeff Briggs, a game designer, and Soren Johnson, a game programmer.

&quot;Civilization III&quot;, like the other &quot;Civilization&quot; games, entails building an empire, from the ground up, beginning in 4,000 BC and continuing slightly beyond the modern day. The player must construct and improve cities, train military and non-military units, improve terrain, research technologies, build Wonders of the World, make war or peace with neighboring civilizations, and so on. The player must balance a good infrastructure, resources, diplomatic and trading skills, technological advancement, city and empire management, culture, and military power to succeed.

==Gameplay==

The game map is made up of square tiles on a grid. Each city, terrain improvement, and unit is located in a specific tile, and each tile can host any number of units. Land tiles can contain a transportation improvement (road or railroad) and a land improvement (farm or mine) or a city. Cities must be built a minimum of one tile away from each other, i.e., no two cities may touch. Each tile is made of a particular type of terrain that determines, among other things, how much food, production, and trade it produces when &quot;worked&quot;. A tile can only be worked if it is one of the twenty tiles surrounding a city. A tile can only be worked by one city at a time, and each city can only work a number of tiles equal to or less than its population.

Food is used to grow the player&#x27;s cities. Each population unit requires food to survive, and excess food is stored. Production, represented in the game as &quot;shields&quot;, is used to build units, buildings, and wonders. Commerce powers the player&#x27;s economy. This commerce is split up as the player sees fit between research, tax revenue, and luxuries, each with a different purpose.

Each city&#x27;s citizens have a certain mood (happy, content, unhappy, or resisting). If most citizens are unhappy, the city falls into civil disorder and all production ceases; if a city remains in civil disorder for too long, it can lead to rioting, which results in improvements being destroyed. If most citizens are happy, they will like their leader and increase economic benefits.

Terrain improvements are built by Worker units. Irrigation increases food, mines increase production, and roads increase commerce and reduce movement costs for all allied land units using them. Two civilizations must have &quot;Right of passage&quot; treaty signed to benefit from each other&#x27;s roads.

Buildings enhance a city in some way and cost maintenance. Like units and Wonders, each one can only be built when the requisite technology has been acquired. Buildings require financial maintenance each turn, and can be destroyed. Only one of each type of building can be constructed in each city.

As in previous installments of &quot;Civilization&quot;, there are unique Wonders of the World that can only be built once per game. Wonders provide a variety of major benefits to a specific city, all cities on a continent, or to an entire empire. &quot;Civilization III&quot; also added Small Wonders, which are functionally equivalent to Wonders except that each one can be constructed once per civilization, as opposed to once in every whole game. Small Wonders have, for the most part, a sociological requirement to construct them, as well as a technological requirement. When a civilization captures a city with a Small Wonder, it is automatically destroyed. Some examples of small wonders are Wall Street, the Forbidden Palace, and The Pentagon.

One of the major features of gameplay is scientific research. Completing the research of a new technology will make available new units, city improvements, and wonders of the world, as well as special bonuses and abilities that are related to the technology. The technology tree is divided into four ages (Ancient Age, Middle Ages, Industrial Age, and Modern Age); each age requires the research of specific technologies to advance to that age. Additionally, there are non-requisite technologies that nevertheless provide useful bonuses that are often essential for good empire management, or allow a civilization to install a new government. Technologies can also be traded to and from other civilizations in return for gold, resources, technologies, workers, and cities. Technologies acquired in this way can in turn be exchanged (also called &#x27;technology brokering&#x27;) for other new technologies by contacting one or more other civilizations.

Citizens are the people who work in a city. There are four kinds: Laborers, Entertainers, Tax Collectors, and Scientists. If there are more citizens in a city than available tiles to work, the extra citizens automatically become Entertainers. The second expansion, &quot;Conquests&quot;, adds two new types of citizens to the game: Policemen (reduce corruption) and Civil Engineers (enhance building and wonder production).

Culture is a feature that was not present in previous installments of the franchise. Each city has a cultural rating, which is the city&#x27;s influence over local terrain. Essentially, the culture&#x27;s outer edge, or &quot;border&quot;, acts as the boundary of each civilization&#x27;s empire. As the city&#x27;s culture rating increases, so does its sphere of influence, bringing more territory under the player&#x27;s control. Civilizations&#x27; borders may abut, resulting in their culture ratings vying for territory. If one player&#x27;s culture rating is sufficiently higher than the other&#x27;s, the former&#x27;s borders will encroach into territory previously owned by the latter. Given enough time and cultural pressure, the latter player&#x27;s city may even elect to join, or &quot;flip to,&quot; the former&#x27;s empire. Culture can thus serve as a means of peaceful conquest.

Every civilization starts with certain special abilities, and they have a special &quot;unique unit&quot; that only they can build; these units usually have a historical basis (for example: the Japanese unique unit is the samurai, which replaces the standard knight, whereas the British unique unit is the Man-O-War, which replaces the standard frigate).

Citizens have a nationality based upon the civilization under which they were &quot;born.&quot; Citizens have a &quot;memory&quot; of their nationality and will consider themselves members of their previous civilization until they are assimilated into their new civilization.

Combat is an important aspect of the game. Each combat unit begins as a &quot;regular&quot; unit with three hit points (although some units have additional hit points bonuses which affect their stats). If the unit loses all its hit points, it dies. Units can be promoted after successful combat missions and gain hit points. The highest rank a unit can attain is that of &quot;elite&quot; (which features five hit points), whereas the lowest is &quot;conscript&quot; (featuring two hit points; this rank is only given to newly drafted soldiers and barbarian units). Each unit has an attack and defense value to determine the winner of each battle. Additional defensive bonuses can be conferred by, e.g., certain terrain types, the unit&#x27;s &quot;Fortify&quot; command, or defending across a river. Ultimately, a random number generator determines the outcome of each battle. When an elite unit wins a battle against an enemy unit, there is also a small chance that it will produce a Great Leader. A Great Leader has the ability to create an Army or instantly finish construction of a building in a city, which made them particularly useful for completing wonders.

With respect to developing the cities within an empire, bonus resources may be found on tiles within the cultural borders. Each type of resource may provide a bonus to food, production, or commerce if found within the city radius and worked by a citizen. Particular kinds of resources, such as luxury or strategic resources, provide additional benefits such as increasing citizens&#x27; happiness or providing access to resource-specific combat units.

Corruption exists in &quot;Civilization III&quot; alongside waste, which decreases a city&#x27;s productivity; together, corruption and waste represent the mismanagement of resources, the malfeasance of city-level bureaucrats, and the limits of a central authority&#x27;s ability to manage an empire. Corruption and waste is often lowest in the capital city and highest on the outskirts of an empire. Furthermore, the levels of corruption and waste are dependent on the system of government of a civilization. There are a number of ways to combat corruption which include building city improvements, such as the courthouse and the police station. Small wonders like the Forbidden Palace and the Secret Police HQ also drastically reduce corruption and waste by acting, in effect, as supplementary capitals.

There are several ways to win the game. A player needs to meet only one of the victory conditions in order to win. These include Conquest victory, achieved when no civilizations besides the player&#x27;s exist; Domination victory, achieved when two thirds of the world&#x27;s land and population are controlled by the player; Cultural victory, achieved when the player successfully assimilates other civilizations; Diplomatic victory, achieved when the player is elected leader of the United Nations; and a science-based victory, achieved when the player researches a sufficient number of technologies and builds a spaceship to reach Alpha Centauri. If no civilization has met any of the other victory conditions by the year 2050, the civilization with the highest score wins the game.

==Development==

Civilization III was released after about two years of development on October 30, 2001. Developed by Westlake Interactive and published by MacSoft, a version for Mac OS was released on January 6, 2002.

==Reception==
===Sales===
In the United States, &quot;Civilization III&quot; entered NPD Intelect&#x27;s weekly computer game sales rankings at #1 for October 28–November 3, 2001. Its &quot;Collectors Edition&quot; SKU claimed second during the period. Thanks to this debut, &quot;Civilization III&quot; became the country&#x27;s fourth-best-selling computer title of October as a whole, with an average retail price of $49. In its second week of availability, the game was pushed to #2 by &quot;Backyard Basketball&quot;, and the &quot;Collectors Edition&quot; was absent from the top 10. Firaxis&#x27;s title remained in NPD&#x27;s weekly top 10 from November 11–December 1, and took sixth place for November as a whole. After an absence, it reappeared in the weekly top 10 twice during December and secured 11th for the month. &quot;Civilization III&quot; finished 2001 with domestic sales of 294,789 units, for revenues of $13.5 million.

&quot;Civilization III&quot; sold 550,000 copies and earned $21.7 million in the United States by August 2006. At the time, this led &quot;Edge&quot; to declare it the country&#x27;s 21st-best-selling computer game released since January 2000. Combined sales of all &quot;Civilization&quot; titles released during the 2000s totaled 2.5 million units by 2006. Internationally, &quot;Civilization III&quot; received a &quot;Silver&quot; sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 100,000 copies in the United Kingdom.

===Reviews and awards===
Jeff Lundrigan reviewed the PC version of the game for &quot;Next Generation&quot;, rating it five stars out of five, and stated that &quot;Given that &quot;Civ II&quot; was as close to perfect as any game has ever been, it&#x27;s arguable that it wasn&#x27;t possible to change it so much as add to it.&quot;

Upon release, the reaction to &quot;Civilization III&quot; was very positive. It won several &quot;Game of the Year&quot; awards, such as the &quot;PC Strategy&quot; award from the AIAS&#x27; 5th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards (along with nominations for &quot;Computer Game of the Year&quot; and &quot;Game of the Year&quot;). The editors of &quot;Computer Games Magazine&quot; named &quot;Civilization III&quot; the best strategy title and best overall computer game of 2001. They commented, &quot;It&#x27;s the best &quot;Civilization&quot; yet, and that&#x27;s saying something.&quot; Nonetheless, the initial release of the game was slightly marred by bugs and glitches. The first patch came very soon after the game&#x27;s initial release and other patches were released subsequently, improving gameplay significantly. The patches also added certain features, such as the group movement command. There were complaints about the addition of features and bug fixes after initial release.

The editors of &quot;PC Gamer US&quot; awarded &quot;Civilization III&quot; their 2001 &quot;Best Turn-Based Strategy Game&quot; prize, and wrote that it &quot;manages to recapture all that was great about its predecessors and color them with a few great new strokes—&quot;without&quot; pantsing up what was so great about them in the first place.&quot; &quot;Civilization III&quot; was a nominee for &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;″s 2001 &quot;Best Strategy Game&quot; award, which ultimately went to &quot;&quot;. The editors wrote, &quot;&quot;Civilization III&quot; was another fantastic candidate. Many feel it&#x27;s the best game so far in the series and is the new benchmark for turn-based strategy games.&quot;

==Expansions==
Two expansion sets have been published for &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Civilization III&quot;: &quot;Play the World&quot; in October 2002, and &quot;Conquests&quot; in November 2003. &quot;Play the World&quot; added multiplayer capabilities, eight new civilizations and some new units to the original release. &quot;Play the World&quot; was followed-up by &quot;Conquests&quot;, which offers nine more historical scenarios, ranging from Mesopotamia to WWII in the Pacific. Many of these scenarios have resources, improvements, wonders, music, and even government types that are specific to the scenario, especially the Mesoamerican and Sengoku Japan campaigns.

The stand-alone version is &quot;Civilization III: Complete Edition&quot;, which includes the two expansions and several patches. (This version came after &quot;Civilization III: Gold Edition&quot; and &quot;Civilization III: Game of the Year Edition&quot;.)

==Board game==
In 2002, Eagle Games published the &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Civilization&quot; board game, created by Glenn Dover. The game was based on &quot;Civilization III&quot; and mirrored many of the video game&#x27;s concepts and gameplay components.

<text>Irma Brandeis (1905–1990) was an American scholar of Dante Alighieri. Her work &quot;The Ladder of Vision&quot; was acclaimed as a breakthrough in Dantean studies upon its publication in the 1960s.

Brandeis graduated from Barnard College in 1926. In her visits to Italy between 1933 and 1939 Brandeis became acquainted with the poet Eugenio Montale and was the inspiration for the metaphysical figure &quot;Clizia&quot; in his poetry, a coded senhal particularly prominent in his second book, &quot;Le Occasioni&quot; (The Occasions). The love story is narrated in Montale&#x27;s posthumous book &quot;Lettere a Clizia&quot; (A. Mondadori, Milan 2006). Despite significant coverage in the literary press of the 1980s of her &quot;Clizia&quot; identity, Brandeis declined to clarify the nature of her relationship to Montale or discuss her possible significance in his work (particularly in poems she had helped translate).

Brandeis was also a close friend of the poet James Merrill, who funded in her memory the Irma Brandeis Professorship of Romance Cultures and Literature at Bard College (where Brandeis taught from 1944 until her semi-retirement in 1979). Merrill wrote in his 1993 memoir &quot;A Different Person&quot; about his unsuccessful efforts to encourage reconciliation between Brandeis and Montale late in life. In a memorial tribute to Brandeis (not published until 2004), Merrill wrote of contacting Brandeis through a Ouija board after her death, and finding her happily reunited &quot;in a manner of speaking&quot; with Montale.

United States Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis was the second cousin of Brandeis&#x27; father.

<text>Maria Luisa Spaziani (21 June 1923 – 30 June 2014) was an Italian poet.

== Biography ==

Spaziani was born in Turin. At nineteen, she founded the review &quot;Il dado&quot;, working with collaborators such as Vasco Pratolini, Sandro Penna and Vincenzo Ciaffi. Virginia Woolf sent her a chapter of her novel &quot;The Waves&quot;, autographed to &quot;Alla piccola direttrice&quot; (To the young editor). Spaziani did not contribute her own poems, however, feeling that they were not of sufficient quality.

In the 1950s Spaziani became involved with the poet Eugenio Montale (1896–1981). Montale encouraged Spaziani to write poetry and was a significant influence in her early style. Maria Luisa Spaziani&#x27;s first book of poetry, &quot;Le acque del sabato&quot;, appeared in 1954. Montale drew upon his affair with her in creating the character of &quot;la Volpe&quot; (&quot;the Fox&quot;) in his work &quot;La bufera e altro&quot; (1956). Montale&#x27;s poem &quot;Da un lago svizzero&quot; is an acrostic forming her name, Maria Luisa Spaziani. (Spaziani eventually published her correspondence with Montale, some eight hundred letters, in 1995.)

After travelling extensively in the late 1950s and early 1960s, in countries including the United Kingdom, Belgium, Greece, France, and the Soviet Union, Spaziani chose to settle in Rome. Starting from 1964 she taught French language and literature at the University of Messina. She published extensively, as a poet, translator, and scholar.

Spaziani was nominated thrice for the Nobel Prize for Literature; 1990, 1992 and 1997. Her poetry combines a vivid and immediate sense of the natural world with a rich appreciation of literary culture and tradition. Though echoes of past poets appear in her work, Spaziani&#x27;s voice is clearly her own, sensitive and controlled.

Spaziani was the president of the &quot;Centro Internazionale Eugenio Montale&quot;, which confers the &quot;Premio Montale&quot;, a literary prize for translations and publications of Italian verse.

Spaziani died on 30 June 2014 at the age of 91.

<text>Paper money, often referred to as a note or a bill (North American English), is a type of negotiable promissory note that is payable to the bearer on demand, making it a form of currency. The main types of paper money are government notes, which are directly issued by political authorities, and banknotes issued by banks, namely banks of issue including central banks. In some cases, paper money may be issued by other entities than governments or banks, for example merchants in pre-modern China and Japan. &quot;Banknote&quot; is often used synonymously for paper money, not least by collectors, but in a narrow sense banknotes are only the subset of paper money that is issued by banks.

Paper money is often, but not always, legal tender, meaning that courts of law are required to recognize them as satisfactory payment of money debts. 

Counterfeiting, including the forgery of paper money, is an inherent challenge. It is countered by anticounterfeiting measures in the printing of paper money. Fighting the counterfeiting of notes (and, for banks of cheques) has been a principal driver of security printing methods development in recent centuries.

==History==
Code of Hammurabi Law 100 ( 1755–1750 BC) stipulated repayment of a loan by a debtor to a creditor on a schedule with a maturity date specified in written contractual terms. Law 122 stipulated that a depositor of gold, silver, or other chattel/movable property for safekeeping must present all articles and a signed contract of bailment to a notary before depositing the articles with a banker, and Law 123 stipulated that a banker was discharged of any liability from a contract of bailment if the notary denied the existence of the contract. Law 124 stipulated that a depositor with a notarized contract of bailment was entitled to redeem the entire value of their deposit, and Law 125 stipulated that a banker was liable for replacement of deposits stolen while in their possession.

Carthage was purported to have issued government notes on parchment or leather before 146 BC. Hence Carthage may be the oldest user of lightweight promissory notes. In China during the Han dynasty, promissory notes appeared in 118 BC and were made of leather. Rome may have used a durable lightweight substance as promissory notes in 57 AD, which have been found in London. 

The first documented paper money was issued during the Tang dynasty and Song dynasty of China, starting in the 7th century, called &quot;flying money&quot;. Its roots were in merchant receipts of deposit during the Tang dynasty (618–907), as merchants and wholesalers desired to avoid the heavy bulk of copper coinage in large commercial transactions. Although government issued centralized paper money did not appear until the 11th century, during the Song dynasty. 

In Europe, cloth notes were in use in Prague in 960 and as part of the banking scheme of the Knights Templars around 1150.

The first European attempt by a bank of issue at issuing banknotes was in 1661 by Stockholms Banco, whose legacy was soon taken over by Sweden&#x27;s Sveriges Riksbank. The French Revolution resulted in the mass issuance of government notes known as assignats whose value soon collapsed, leading Napoleon to establish the Bank of France to issue paper banknotes in the early 1800s. 

Cash paper money originated as receipts for value held on account &quot;value received&quot;, and should not be conflated with promissory &quot;sight bills,&quot; which were issued with a promise to convert at a later date. 

The perception of paper money as currency has evolved over time. Originally, money was based on precious metals, or commodity money. Paper money was seen by some as an I.O.U. or promissory note: a promise to pay someone in precious metal on presentation (see representative money). But they were readily accepted—for convenience and security—in London, for example, from the late 1600s onwards. With the gradual removal of precious metals from the monetary system, paper money evolved into pure fiat money.

===Early Chinese paper money===

The first known paper money instrument was used in China in the 7th century, during the Tang dynasty (618–907). Merchants would issue what are today called promissory notes in the form of receipts of deposit to wholesalers to avoid using the heavy bulk of copper coinage in large commercial transactions. Before these notes, circular coins with a rectangular hole in the middle were used. Multiple coins could be strung together on a rope. Merchants found that the strings were too heavy to carry around easily, especially for large transactions. To solve this problem, coins could be left with a trusted person, with the merchant being given a slip of paper (the receipt) recording how much money they had deposited with that person. Their coins would be restored when they went back and gave that person the paper.

True paper money, called &quot;jiaozi&quot;, developed from these promissory notes by the 11th century, during the Song dynasty. By 960, the Song government was short of copper for striking coins, and issued the first generally circulating notes. These notes were a promise by the ruler to redeem them later for some other object of value, usually specie. The issue of credit notes was often for a limited duration, and at some discount to the promised amount later. The &quot;jiaozi&quot; did not replace coins but was used alongside them.

The central government soon observed the economic advantages of printing paper money, issuing a monopoly for the issue of these certificates of deposit to several deposit shops. By the early 12th century, the amount of notes issued in a single year amounted to an annual rate of 26 million strings of cash coins. By the 1120s, the central government started to produce its own state-issued paper money (using woodblock printing).

Even before this point, the Song government was amassing large amounts of paper tribute. It was recorded that each year before 1101, the prefecture of Xin&#x27;an (modern Shexian, Anhui) alone would send 1,500,000 sheets of paper in seven different varieties to the capital at Kaifeng. In 1101, the Emperor Huizong of Song decided to lessen the amount of paper taken in the tribute quota because it was causing detrimental effects and creating heavy burdens on the people of the region. However, the government still needed masses of paper products for the exchange certificates and the state&#x27;s new issuing of paper money. For the printing of paper money alone, the Song government established several government-run factories in the cities of Huizhou, Chengdu, Hangzhou, and Anqi.

The workforce employed in these paper money factories was quite large; it was recorded in 1175 that the factory at Hangzhou alone employed more than a thousand workers a day. However, the government issues of paper money were not yet nationwide standards of currency at that point; issues of notes were limited to regional areas of the empire, and were valid for use only in a designated and temporary limit of three years.

Between 1265 and 1274, the late southern Song government introduced a gold- or silver-backed national paper currency standard, which changed the geographic restriction. The range of varying values for these notes was perhaps from one string of cash to one hundred at the most. Ever after 1107, the government printed money in no less than six ink colors and printed notes with intricate designs and sometimes even with mixture of a unique fiber in the paper to combat counterfeiting.

The founder of the Yuan dynasty, Kublai Khan, issued paper money known as Jiaochao. The original notes were restricted by area and duration, as in the Song dynasty, but in the later years, facing massive shortages of specie to fund their rule, the paper money began to be issued without restrictions on duration. The fact that the state was guaranteeing the Chinese paper money impressed Venetian merchants.

===Early European paper money===

According to a travelogue of a visit to Prague in 960 by Ibrahim ibn Yaqub, small pieces of cloth were used as a means of trade, with these cloths having a set exchange rate versus silver.

Around 1150, the Knights Templar would issue notes to pilgrims. Pilgrims would deposit valuables with a local Templar preceptory before embarking for the Holy Land and receive a document indicating the value of their deposit. They would then use that document upon arrival in the Holy Land to receive funds from the treasury of equal value.

In the 13th century, Chinese paper money of Mongol Yuan became known in Europe through the accounts of travelers, such as Marco Polo and William of Rubruck. Marco Polo&#x27;s account of paper money during the Yuan dynasty is the subject of a chapter of his book, &quot;The Travels of Marco Polo&quot;, titled &quot;&quot;.

In medieval Italy and Flanders, because of the insecurity and impracticality of transporting large sums of cash over long distances, money traders started using promissory notes. In the beginning, these were personally registered, but they soon became a written order to pay the amount to whoever had it in their possession. These notes are seen as a predecessor to banknotes by some but are mainly thought of as proto bills of exchange and cheques. The term &quot;bank note&quot; itself comes from the notes of the bank (&quot;nota di banco&quot;) and dates from the 14th century; it originally recognized the right of the holder of the note to collect the precious metal (usually gold or silver) deposited with a banker (via a currency account). In the 14th century, it was used in every part of Europe and in Italian city-state merchants colonies outside of Europe. For international payments, the more efficient and sophisticated bill of exchange (&quot;lettera di cambio&quot;), that is, a promissory note based on a virtual currency account (usually a coin no longer physically existing), was used more often. All physical currencies were physically related to this virtual currency; this instrument also served as credit.

===Birth of European banknotes===
The shift toward the use of these receipts as a means of payment took place in the mid-17th century, as the price revolution, when relatively rapid gold inflation was causing a re-assessment of how money worked. The goldsmith bankers of London began to give out the receipts as payable to the &quot;bearer&quot; of the document rather than the original depositor. This meant that the note could be used as currency based on the security of the goldsmith, not the account holder of the goldsmith-banker. The bankers also began issuing a greater value of notes than the total value of their physical reserves in the form of loans, on the assumption that they would not have to redeem all of their issued banknotes at the same time. This was a natural extension of debt-based issuance of split tally sticks used for centuries in places like St. Giles Fair, however, done in this way, it was able to directly expand the expansion of the supply of circulating money. As these receipts were increasingly used in the money circulation system, depositors began to ask for multiple receipts to be made out in smaller, fixed denominations for use as money. The receipts soon became a written order to pay the amount to whoever had possession of the note. These notes are credited as the first modern banknotes.

The first short-lived attempt at issuing banknotes by a central bank was in 1661 by Stockholms Banco, a predecessor of Sweden&#x27;s central bank, Sveriges Riksbank. These replaced the copper-plates being used instead as a means of payment. The peculiar circumstances of the Swedish coin supply were what led to this banknote issue. Cheap foreign imports of copper had forced the Crown to steadily increase the size of the copper coinage to maintain its value relative to silver. The heavy weight of the new coins encouraged merchants to deposit it in exchange for receipts. These became banknotes when the manager of the bank decoupled the rate of note issue from the bank currency reserves. Three years later, the bank went bankrupt after rapidly increasing the artificial money supply through the large-scale printing of paper money. A new bank, the &quot;Riksens Ständers Bank,&quot; was established in 1668, but did not issue banknotes until the 19th century.

===Permanent issue of banknotes===
The idea that social and legal consensus determines what constitutes money is the foundation of modern banknotes. A gold coin&#x27;s value is simply a reflection of the supply and demand mechanism of a society exchanging goods in a free market, as opposed to stemming from any intrinsic property of the metal. By the late 17th century, this new conceptual outlook helped to stimulate the issue of banknotes. The economist Nicholas Barbon wrote that money &quot;was an imaginary value made by a law for the convenience of exchange&quot;.

A temporary experiment of banknote issue was carried out by Sir William Phips as the governor of the Province of Massachusetts Bay starting on December 20, 1690, to help fund the war effort against France. The other Thirteen Colonies followed in Massachusetts&#x27; wake and began issuing bills of credit, an early form of paper currency distinct from banknotes, to fund military expenditures and for use as a common medium of exchange. By the 1760s, these bills of credit were used in the majority of transactions in the Thirteen Colonies.

The first bank to initiate the permanent issue of banknotes was the Bank of England. Established in 1694 to raise money for the funding of the war against France, the bank began issuing notes in 1695 with the promise to pay the bearer the value of the note on demand. They were initially handwritten to a precise amount and issued on deposit or as a loan. There was a gradual move toward the issuance of fixed denomination notes, and by 1745, standardized printed notes ranging from £20 to £1,000 were being printed. Fully printed notes that did not require the name of the payee and the cashier&#x27;s signature first appeared in 1855.

The Bank of Scotland was established in 1695 to support Scottish businesses, and in 1696 became the first European bank to issue banknotes in fixed values. It continues to issue banknotes and is the longest continuous banknote issue in the world.

The Scottish economist John Law helped establish banknotes as a formal currency in France, after the wars waged by Louis XIV left the country with a shortage of precious metals for coinage.

In the United States, there were early attempts at establishing a central bank in 1791 and 1816, but it was only in 1862 that the federal government of the United States, began to print banknotes.

===Central bank issuance of legal tender===

Originally, the banknote was simply a promise to the bearer that they could redeem it for its value in specie, but the Bank of England Act 1833, the second in a series of Bank Charter Acts, established that banknotes would be considered as legal tender during peacetime.

Until the mid-19th century, commercial banks were able to issue their own banknotes, and notes issued by provincial banking companies were the common form of currency throughout England, outside London. The Bank Charter Act 1844, which established the modern central bank, restricted authorisation to issue new banknotes to the Bank of England, which would henceforth have sole control of the money supply in 1921. At the same time, the Bank of England was restricted to issue new banknotes only if they were 100% backed by gold or up to £14 million in government debt. The Act gave the Bank of England an effective monopoly over the note issue from 1928.

==Advantages and disadvantages==
Prior to the introduction of paper money, precious or semiprecious metals minted into coins to certify their substance were widely used as a medium of exchange. The value that people attributed to coins was originally based upon the value of the metal unless they were token issues or had been debased. When paper money was issued by banks, that was originally a claim for the coins held by the bank, but due to the ease with which they could be transferred and the confidence that people had in the capacity of the bank to settle the notes in coin if presented, they became a popular means of exchange in their own right. They now make up a very small proportion of the &quot;money&quot; that people think that they have, as demand deposit bank accounts and electronic payments have negated much of the need to carry notes and coins.

Paper money has a natural advantage over coins in that it is lighter to carry; but it is also less durable than coins. Banknotes issued by commercial banks had counterparty risk, meaning that the bank may not be able to make payment when the note was presented. Notes issued by central banks had a theoretical risk when they were backed by gold and silver. Both notes and coins are subject to inflation. The durability of coins means that even if metal coins melt in a fire or are submerged under the sea for hundreds of years, they still have some value when they are recovered. Gold coins salvaged from shipwrecks retain almost all of their original appearance, but silver coins slowly corrode.

Other costs of using bearer money include:

# Discounting to face value: Before national currencies and efficient clearing houses, banknotes were only redeemable at face value at the issuing bank. Even a branch bank could discount notes of other branches of the same bank. The discounts usually increased with distance from the issuing bank. The discount also depended on the perceived safety of the bank. When banks failed, the notes were usually partly redeemed out of reserves, but they sometimes became worthless. The problem of discounting within a country does not exist with national currencies.
#Counterfeiting paper notes has always been a problem, especially since the introduction of color photocopiers and computer image scanners. Numerous banks and nations have incorporated many types of countermeasures in order to keep the money secure. However, extremely sophisticated counterfeit notes known as superdollars have been detected in recent years.
# Manufacturing or issue costs. Coins are produced by industrial manufacturing methods that process the precious, semi-precious, or other metals, and require additions of alloy for hardness and wear resistance. By contrast, bank notes are printed paper (or polymer), and typically have a higher cost of issue, especially in larger denominations, compared with coins of the same value.
# Wear costs. Banknotes do not lose economic value by wear, since, even if they are in poor condition, they are still a legally valid claim on the issuing bank. However, banks of issue do have to pay the cost of replacing banknotes in poor condition, and paper and even polymer notes wear out much faster than coins.
# Cost of transport. Coins can be expensive to transport for high value transactions, but banknotes can be issued in large denominations that are much lighter than the equivalent value in coins.
# Cost of acceptance. Coins can be checked for authenticity by weighing and other forms of examination and testing. These costs can be significant, but good quality coin design and manufacturing can help reduce these costs. Banknotes also have an acceptance cost – the expense of checking the banknote&#x27;s security features and confirming acceptability of the issuing bank.

The different advantages and disadvantages of commodity money and paper money imply that there may be an ongoing role for both forms of bearer money, each being used where its advantages outweigh its disadvantages.

==Paper money collecting as a hobby==

Paper money collecting, also referred to as banknote collecting or notaphily, is a slowly growing area of numismatics. Although generally not as widespread as coin and stamp collecting, the hobby is slowly expanding. Prior to the 1990s, currency collecting was a relatively small adjunct to coin collecting, but currency auctions and greater public awareness of paper money have caused more interest in rare items and consequently their increased value. The most valuable note is the $1000 bill issued in 1890 that was sold at an auction for $2,255,000.

===Trades===

For years, the mode of collecting paper money was through a handful of mail order dealers who issued price lists and catalogs. In the early 1990s, it became more common for rare notes to be sold at various coin and currency shows via auction. The illustrated catalogs and &quot;event nature&quot; of the auction practice seemed to fuel a sharp rise in overall awareness of paper money in the numismatic community. The emergence of currency third party grading services (similar to services that grade and &quot;slab&quot;, or encapsulate, coins) also may have increased collector and investor interest in notes. Entire advanced collections are often sold at one time, and to this day, single auctions can generate millions in gross sales. Today, eBay has surpassed auctions in terms of the highest volume of sales of banknotes. However, rare banknotes still sell for much less than comparable rare coins. This disparity is diminishing as paper money prices continue to rise. A few rare and historical banknotes have sold for more than a million dollars.

There are many different organizations and societies around the world for the hobby, including the International Bank Note Society (IBNS), which currently asserts to have around 2,000 members in 90 countries.

===Novelty===

The universal appeal and instant recognition of paper money have resulted in a plethora of novelty merchandise that is designed to have the appearance of paper currency. These items cover nearly every class of product. Cloth material printed with banknote patterns is used for clothing, bed linens, curtains, upholstery, and more. Acrylic paperweights and even toilet seats with bank notes embedded inside are also common. Items that resemble stacks of bank notes and can be used as a seat or ottoman are also available.

Manufacturers of these items must take into consideration when creating these products whether the product could be construed as counterfeiting. Overlapping note images and/or changing the dimensions of the reproduction to be at least 50% smaller or 50% larger than the original are some ways to avoid the risk of being considered a counterfeit. But in cases where realism is the goal, other steps may be necessary. For example, in the stack of banknotes seat mentioned earlier, the decal used to create the product would be considered counterfeit. However, once the decal has been affixed to the resin stack shell and cannot be peeled off, the final product is no longer at risk of being classified as counterfeit, even though the resulting appearance is realistic.

<text>Herzliya ( ; , / ) is an affluent city in the central coast of Israel, at the northern part of the Tel Aviv District, known for its robust start-up and entrepreneurial culture. In it had a population of . Named after Theodor Herzl, the founder of modern Zionism, Herzliya covers an area of . Its western, beachfront area is called Herzliya Pituah and is one of Israel&#x27;s most affluent neighborhoods and home to numerous embassies, ambassadors&#x27; residences, companies headquarters, and houses of prominent Israeli business people.

==History==
Herzliya, named after Theodor Herzl, was founded in 1924 as a semi-cooperative farming community (moshava) with a mixed population of new immigrants and veteran residents. During that year, 101 houses and 35 cowsheds were built there, and the village continued to grow. The 1931 census recorded a population of 1,217 inhabitants, in 306 houses. 
Upon the establishment of the state in 1948, Herzliya was a town of 5,300. Large numbers of immigrants settled there, and it had 12,000 residents within a few years. In 1960, when the population reached 25,000, Herzliya was declared a city.

Under current plans, the city&#x27;s population will triple to around 290,000 by 2030, with 52,000 new homes and new industrial developments and hotels built, with more dense construction in the city center while expanding the city to the north and southwest.

==Demographics==
According to the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics, residents of Herzliya are among the wealthiest in Israel. In 2003–2005, average monthly salaries were ILS 8,211, or about ILS 1,500 above average in a survey of Israel&#x27;s 15 largest cities. However, there is a large gap between the city&#x27;s seven working-class neighborhoods, among them Yad Tisha, Neve Yisrael and Neve Amal, and upscale Herzliya Pituah.

Some of Israel&#x27;s most expensive homes and finest beaches are in Herzliya Pituah, a neighborhood on the west side of Herzliya. Herzliya Pituach is a sought-after venue for high-tech companies, and its marina, many restaurants and entertainment spots have turned this part of Herzliya into a vibrant hub of Israeli nightlife.

==Arab–Israeli conflict==
A makeshift strip located around the current Herzliya Airport was used as the main operating base of Israel&#x27;s first true fighter aircraft (as opposed to makeshift use of light planes), Avia S-199, during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. The airfield was used as it was a bit back from the front lines and was clandestine since it was a purpose-built strip, that was constructed after the beginning of hostilities, between the orange orchards around Herzliya, and did not appear on published maps.

On June 11, 2002, Hadar Hershkowitz (14) was killed in the 2002 Herzliya shawarma restaurant bombing. On May 30, 2006, Re&#x27;ut Feldman (20), a resident of Herzliya, was killed in the Kedumim bombing.

<text>Minter City is an unincorporated community in Leflore County and Tallahatchie County, Mississippi, United States. It is part of the Greenwood, Mississippi micropolitan area, and is within the Mississippi Delta.

Mississippi Highway 8 intersects U.S. Route 49E southwest of Minter City, and the Tallahatchie River flows to the east. The post office on U.S. Route 49E has the ZIP Code 38944.

==History==
The original settlement was known as &quot;Walnut Place Landing&quot; and &quot;Minter City Landing&quot;.

After traveling down Charley&#x27;s Trace (also known as the Old Trading Trail), Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto may have crossed the Tallahatchie River near Minter City as his party traveled west in 1541.

In 1849, James A. Towne bought in the area for 25 cents per acre, and built a log house on the western shore of the river at Minter City. Known as &quot;Uncle Jimmy&quot;, Towne supported the local Methodist church, and was known to give each new preacher a wagon and mule.

The &quot;James Minter Ferry&quot;, documented in 1868, enabled the crossing of the Tallahatchie River at this site.

Minter City became a junction for two railroads, both now abandoned. The Mobile, Jackson and Kansas City Railroad was established in 1890, and the Minter City Southern and Western Railroad, a shortline railroad servicing the sawmills west of Minter City, began operating in 1904. A depot and railroad facilities were erected in Minter City.

The African-American educator William H. Holtzclaw, founder of the Utica Normal and Industrial Institute for the Training of Colored Young Men and Young Women (now part of Hinds Community College) in Utica, Mississippi, wrote about his experiences establishing schools for African-Americans in Mississippi in his book &quot;The Black Man&#x27;s Burden&quot;, published in 1915. In it, he describes meeting with a wealthy white plantation owner in Minter City to discuss the establishment of a school there:
I believe you are about to engage in a good work, and I would like to see the Negro educated, but, candidly, I do not think that the kind of school you would like to start would do any good in the Delta. I really think it would do harm. What I want here is Negroes who can make cotton, and they don&#x27;t need education to help them make cotton. I could not use educated Negroes on my place, but since you have asked me for advice, I will tell you candidly that here in the Delta is no place to start a school.

The Frank Streater Consolidated School (White) was constructed in Minter City in 1921. The abandoned building burned in 2013.

Minter City was the site of a lynching in 1933. Richard Roscoe, an African-American Baptist deacon and tenant farmer, had been in a physical altercation with the white plantation manager, and both men had been injured. An hour later, Roscoe was abducted, shot dead, and then dragged through the streets of Minter City tied to the back of the sheriff&#x27;s car.

==Education==
Areas in Leflore County are is in the Greenwood-Leflore School District. Residents are zoned to Amanda Elzy High School. This area was formerly served by the Leflore County School District. T.Y. Fleming Elementary School was in the area, but it closed in 2009. The editor of the &quot;Greenwood Commonwealth&quot; criticized the closure. Effective July 1, 2019 the Leflore district district consolidated into the Greenwood-Leflore School District.

Areas in the Tallahatchie County portion are zoned to the West Tallahatchie School District. The local schools for West Tallahatchie are R. H. Bearden Elementary School and West Tallahatchie High School. Previously Black Bayou Elementary School in Glendora served southern parts of the West Tallahatchie district. The district decided to close Black Bayou in 1998. Previously West District Middle School (now Bearden) served as a middle school for the West Tallahatchie area.

Mississippi Delta Community College is the designated community college for Leflore County. Coahoma Community College is the designated community college for Tallahatchie County.

==In popular culture==
* Richard Ford references Minter City in his 1996 novel &quot;Independence Day&quot;.

<text>The Orange County Transportation Authority (OCTA) is the transportation planning commission for Orange County, California, in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. OCTA is responsible for funding and implementing transit and capital projects for the transportation system in the county, including freeway expansions, express lane management, bus and rail transit operation, and commuter rail funding and oversight.

OCTA was founded in 1991 through the consolidation of seven separate transportation agencies by the California State Legislature and is governed by a 17-member Board of Directors with the Caltrans District Director serving in a non-voting capacity. The Authority&#x27;s administrative offices are located in Orange, California.

==History==

OCTA&#x27;s predecessor agency, the Orange County Transit District, was created in August 1972 by a referendum of county voters. It originally started as Santa Ana Transit, a small transit agency with five bus routes operating in Orange County. Santa Ana Transit later merged with other, smaller agencies throughout the county, eventually leading to the formation of OCTD. The routing system was formed over the course of about 15 years and was held in place until the merge to OCTA.

In 1991, OCTA was created under state law, combining the seven separate Orange County agencies that managed transportation planning: Orange County Transportation Commission, Orange County Transit District, Consolidated Transportation Services Agency, Orange County Local Transportation Authority, Orange County Service Authority for Freeway Emergencies, Orange County Congestion Management Agency, and Orange County Service Authority for Abandoned Vehicles.

Park-and-ride facilities, public transportation and other transportation related administrative offices merged into one organization. OCTA administers funds from &quot;Measure M&quot; (also known as OC Go), a half-cent transportation sales tax. Measure M was originally passed in 1990 and renewed in 2006. It has paid for the expansion on most freeways within Orange County, street improvements and repairs, traffic signal synchronization, and increased Metrolink service.

In 1995, OCTA suffered tremendously during the Orange County bankruptcy and never fully recovered. The agency lost $202 million in revenue over 17 years due to the bankruptcy. As a result, bus service was reduced.

In October 2015, OCTA rebranded its bus services as &quot;OC Bus&quot; and launched the OC Bus 360° plan, which aims to consolidate routes into more frequent service and increase ridership. OCTA also plans to replace 40% of its bus fleet with compressed natural gas-powered vehicles. The change was approved by the OCTA board on February 22, 2016.

In January 2022, OCTA debuted battery-electric buses.

==Bus operations==
OCTA operates 52 bus routes under the OC Bus brand, encompassing every city in Orange County. Some of the lines also extend to serve the Los Angeles County border communities of Artesia, Lakewood, La Mirada, Cerritos, Hawaiian Gardens and Long Beach.

The longest is route 1 (Long Beach–San Clemente) which utilizes Pacific Coast Highway (State Route 1) for the vast majority of its route, with trips taking an average of 2 to 2.5 hours. South Coast Plaza is the most served location with five OC Bus routes (55, 57, 86, 150 and Bravo! 553).

OCTA also operates six routes under the iShuttle (Irvine Shuttle) brand, serving the cities of Irvine and Tustin. These buses have a different paint scheme and fare structure, but still accept OC Bus passes. These routes connect to Irvine Transportation Center and Tustin station, and have schedules timed to give passengers a smooth transfer to/from Metrolink and Amtrak trains.
==Rail operations==
===Commuter rail===

The OCTA began funding rail operations with the &quot;Orange County Commuter&quot;, which Amtrak started operating in early 1990 running between Los Angeles Union Station and with stops in , , Anaheim, , and . After being tasked by the California Senate to create a joint commuter rail program with other local authorities, the OCTA became a founding member of the Southern California Regional Rail Authority, which later adopted the brand name Metrolink.

The &quot;Orange County Commuter&quot; was subsequently transferred to Metrolink, becoming the Orange County Line. With the Metrolink takeover in 1994, the southern terminus moved to and five infill stations were added: and in 1995, and in 2002, and in 2007. Starting in 2005, OCTA has funded greatly expanded service on the Orange County Line, with trains now running twenty hours daily, seven days a week, as often as every 30 minutes. Additional platforms were added at the Fullerton and Laguna Niguel/Mission Viejo stations to accommodate the additional trains.

Metrolink&#x27;s Inland Empire–Orange County Line began operations in October 1995 between Riverside and Irvine; it was the first suburb-to-suburb commuter rail in the U.S. at the time. The line was later extended and now operates between San Bernardino and Oceanside.

Metrolink also added a third line through Orange County on May 6, 2002, the 91 Line, later renamed the 91/Perris Valley Line. The service initially operated between Los Angeles Union Station and Riverside–Downtown station via Buena Park, Fullerton, and Corona, roughly paralleling part of the route of the namesake California State Route 91. Limited weekend service began in July 2014. On June 6, 2016, service was extended beyond Riverside to Moreno Valley and Perris–South station in Perris.

===OC Streetcar===
, OCTA is collaborating with the cities of Santa Ana and Garden Grove to build the OC Streetcar, a , 12-station light rail line along Santa Ana Boulevard and 4th Street in the two cities, using portions of the West Santa Ana Branch of the old Pacific Electric right-of-way. The western terminus of the proposed route would follow the Pacific Electric right-of-way near the intersection of Harbor Boulevard and Westminster Avenue in Garden Grove, then along street running track on Santa Ana Boulevard into Downtown Santa Ana, where it would reach the Santa Ana Regional Transportation Center at its eastern terminus. In February 2016, $125 million towards the project was included in the proposed United States federal budget for the 2016-17 fiscal year. OCTA began construction in 2018 and plans to open the project in 2025.

===Cancelled CenterLine light rail===

The CenterLine was a proposed light rail system serving Irvine, Costa Mesa and Santa Ana. It was originally planned in the 1990s and was intended to open in 2009. Costing $1 billion, it was originally envisioned as a route that would run from Fullerton to Irvine, through Anaheim, Orange, Santa Ana and Costa Mesa. The route would have served destinations including John Wayne Airport, South Coast Metro, South Coast Plaza, Santa Ana College and downtown Santa Ana.

While OCTA secured funding through Measure M, lack of support from Orange County&#x27;s congressional representatives resulted in no federal funds obtained for the proposed transit line. In February 2005, the CenterLine was suspended indefinitely, and in May 2005, the plan was officially scrapped in favor of expanding express bus service throughout Orange County and improving existing Metrolink commuter rail service.

==Highway and road operations==
OCTA is responsible for the Countywide Master Highway Plan, which designates major arterial streets in the county, however, most road maintenance responsibilities fall with the city where the street operates in, or with the county, in the case of unincorporated areas. OCTA street funding is steered towards roadways on the Master Plan in recognition of their role in regional travel.

===Recent projects===

West County Connectors: In June 2010, OCTA broke ground on the West County Connectors project. The $328 million project is Orange County&#x27;s largest stimulus project and one of the biggest construction jobs in nearly a decade. It added a 6-mile carpool lane and directly connected the carpool lanes on the San Diego Freeway (I-405) with the San Gabriel Freeway (I-605) and the Garden Grove Freeway (State Route 22). The project also modified and rebuilt three freeway overpasses at Valley View Street, Seal Beach Boulevard and the 7th Street Bridge into Long Beach.

Riverside Freeway (SR-91): This project added a new eastbound lane between the SR-241 in Orange County and the SR-71 in Riverside County, widening bridges and building new retaining and sound walls in an attempt to reduce traffic noise.

This was the first project in a series of capacity expansions planned for the SR-91. The second project added a new lane in each direction from the SR-55 to SR-241. The third project added a new westbound lane from SR-57 to Interstate 5. The project was completed in 2015.

Orange Freeway (SR-57): Work began in the summer of 2011 on the SR-57 to add a new northbound lane from Orangethorpe Avenue to Lambert. The project was completed in early 2014. Another project, which added a new northbound lane from Katella Avenue to Lincoln Avenue, got underway in early 2012 and was completed by late 2014.

I-5 Gateway Project: Construction began in spring 2006 on the I-5 Gateway project. The four-year project widened the remaining two miles of the I-5 in Orange County from the SR-91 to the Los Angeles County line. The I-5 Gateway project is the final link in the original Measure M&#x27;s freeway expansion program. The project was completed in 2010.

In addition to freeway capacity expansions, OCTA is in the midst of the most comprehensive rail safety program in the nation that includes a public awareness program regarding safety near the tracks and implementing safety enhancements at more than 50 railroad crossings throughout the county.

The safety enhancements scheduled for completion in 2011 include:
* Upgrades to warning devices in place to advise drivers of train tracks ahead
* Additional gate arms to prevent drivers and pedestrians from crossing the tracks when the gates are lowered and a train is passing
* Extended and raised medians to deter drivers from passing around lowered gates
* Coordinated local traffic signals to prevent vehicles from stalling on the tracks

===91 and 405 Express Lanes===
OCTA owns and operates the 91 Express Lanes and the 405 Express Lanes, two high-occupancy toll (HOT) lane facilities in the county.

OCTA purchased the 91 Express Lanes in 2003 from the California Private Transportation Corporation. Opening in 1995, the four-lane express lanes run in the median of the Riverside Freeway (SR-91) between the Interstate 15 and the Costa Mesa Freeway (SR-55). OCTA purchased the 91 Express Lanes without taxpayer money and removed a &quot;non-compete&quot; clause that prevented safety improvements and traffic capacity expansions along the stretch of tollway. In July 2003, OCTA adopted a toll policy for the 91 Express Lanes based on the concept of congestion management pricing, which is designed to optimize traffic flow at free-flow speeds. The policy calls for dropping and raising tolls based on traffic demand. Traffic volumes are monitored daily and adjusted quarterly.

The 405 Express Lanes between SR-73 and the I-605/SR-22 interchange near the Los Angeles County line opened in December 2023.

The other tollways in Orange County (SR-241, SR-261, and parts of SR-73 and SR-133) are governed by the Transportation Corridor Agencies.

<text>The Rio Negro ( &quot;Black River&quot;), or Guainía as it is known in its upper part, is the largest left tributary of the Amazon River (accounting for about 14% of the water in the Amazon basin), the largest blackwater river in the world, and one of the world&#x27;s ten largest rivers by average discharge. Despite its high flow, the Rio Negro has a low sediment load (5.76 million tonnes per year on average in Manaus).&lt;ref name=&quot;Suspended sediment transport estimation in Negro River (Amazon Basin) using MSI/Sentinel-2 data&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geography ==
=== Upper course ===
The source of the Rio Negro lies in Colombia, in the Department of Guainía where the river is known as the &quot;Guainía River&quot;. The young river generally flows in an east-northeasterly direction through the Puinawai National Reserve, passing several small indigenous settlements on its way, such as Cuarinuma, Brujas, Santa Rosa and Tabaquén. After roughly the river starts forming the border between Colombia&#x27;s Department of Guainía and Venezuela&#x27;s Amazonas State. After passing the Colombian community of Tonina and Macanal the river turns southwest. Maroa is the first Venezuelan town the river passes. further downstream the river receives the Casiquiare canal from the left (north), forming a unique link between the Orinoco and the Amazon river basin. Henceforth the river is called &quot;Rio Negro&quot;.

=== Middle course ===
The river now continues in a southeastern direction passing the Venezuelan town of San Carlos de Río Negro, its largest settlement on the river, and Colombia&#x27;s San Felipe.
In this stretch the river is constantly fed with tributaries from both sides, and it quickly grows in size creating large river islands, a common feature for all rivers in the Amazon basin. After forming the border between Colombia and Venezuela for the Rio Negro reaches the Piedra del Cocuy, an igneous rock formation from the Precambrian era, belonging to the Guyana Shield. Here the Tripoint of Colombia, Venezuela and Brazil is found in the middle of the river and it now completely enters Amazonas State, Brazil. After passing Cucuí, the river continues south, only temporarily turning west for several kilometers. In Missão Boa Vista the Içana River joins the Rio Negro and in São Joaquim the Uaupes River, the largest tributary of the Rio Negro, also enters from the right hand side. The Rio Negro now turns markedly towards the east, forming several rapids and small islets on its way. It then passes Sao Gabriel da Cachoeira an important commercial city. After several more rapids and imposing views of the Adormecida mountain chain the river leaves the Guyana shield it traversed in its upper and middle course.

=== Lower course ===
After the Marié River enters the Rio Negro the river continues its eastward course forming many large islands and becoming very wide at several locations. It passes local communities such as Santa Isabel do Rio Negro. During the wet season, the river floods the country far and wide here, sometimes to a width of , for long distances. During this season, from April until October, it is a succession of lagoons, full of long islands and intricate channels with a lot of water wildlife. Near Carvoeiro the last major tributary of the Rio Negro, the Branco River joins the Rio Negro and the river temporarily forms the border between the state of Roraima and Amazonas State, Brazil. The river now takes a more southeastern course, becoming again very wide in many stretches before reaching the biggest city on its course Manaus.

The Anavilhanas National Park, a conservation unit that was originally an ecological station created in 1981, protects part of the Anavilhanas river archipelago in this part of the river.
Below the archipelago, it meets the Solimões River to form the Amazon River, creating a phenomenon known as the Meeting of Waters.

== History ==
The river was named by the Spanish explorer Francisco de Orellana, who first came upon it in 1541. By the middle of the 17th century, Jesuits had settled along its banks in the midst of numerous tribes: Manau, Aruák, and Trumá Indians. After 1700 slaving along the river was common, and Native American populations were greatly diminished after contact with Eurasian diseases. In 1800 German scientist Alexander von Humboldt and French botanist Aimé Bonpland explored the river. During 1852-1854 Richard Spruce and Alfred Russel Wallace made numerous observations and botanical collections. During a 1924–25 expedition, Alexander H. Rice Jr. of Harvard University traveled up the Orinoco, traversed the Casiquiare canal, and descended the Rio Negro to the Amazon at Manaus. It was the first expedition to use aerial photography and shortwave radio for mapping of the region. In 1968 the Rio Negro was navigated by an SRN6 hovercraft during a National Geographic expedition. This area was the filming location for Survivor:The Amazon in 2003.

== Fauna and flora ==
While the name &quot;Rio Negro&quot; means &quot;Black River&quot;, its waters are similar in colour to strong tea, which is typical of blackwater rivers. The dark color comes from humic acid due to an incomplete breakdown of phenol-containing vegetation from sandy clearings. The river was named because it looks black from a distance.

Much has been written on the productivity of the Rio Negro and other blackwater rivers. The older idea that these are &quot;hunger rivers&quot; is giving way, with new research, to the recognition that the Rio Negro, for example, supports a large fishing industry and has numerous turtle beaches. If explorers did not find many Indigenous peoples along the Rio Negro during the 17th century, it is likely that their populations were reduced because of new infectious diseases and warfare rather than low river productivity.

Rio Negro has a very high species richness. About 700 fish species have been documented in the river basin, and it is estimated that the total is 800–900 fish species, including almost 100 endemics and several undescribed species. Among these are many that are important in the aquarium trade, including the cardinal tetra. As a result of the Casiquiare canal, many aquatic species are found both in the Rio Negro and Orinoco. Because the Casiquiare includes both blackwater and clear- to whitewater sections, only relatively adaptable species are able to pass through it between the two river systems.

==In media==
The sixth season of &quot;Survivor&quot;, &quot;&quot; was filmed in Rio Negro in 2003. Also Meeting of the Waters by Animal Collective was recorded in Rio Negro in 2016.

<text>Ichthyostega (from , &#x27;fish&#x27; and , &#x27;roof&#x27;) is an extinct genus of limbed tetrapodomorphs from the Late Devonian of what is now Greenland. It was among the earliest four-limbed vertebrates ever in the fossil record and was one of the first with weight-bearing adaptations for terrestrial locomotion. &quot;Ichthyostega&quot; possessed lungs and limbs that helped it navigate through shallow water in swamps. Although &quot;Ichthyostega&quot; is often labelled a &#x27;tetrapod&#x27; because of its limbs and fingers, it evolved long before true crown group tetrapods and could more accurately be referred to as a stegocephalian or stem tetrapod. Likewise, while undoubtedly of amphibian build and habit, it is not a true member of the group in the narrow sense, as the first modern amphibians (members of the group Lissamphibia) appeared in the Triassic Period. Until finds of other early stegocephalians and closely related fishes in the late 20th century, &quot;Ichthyostega&quot; stood alone as a transitional fossil between fish and tetrapods, combining fish and tetrapod features. Newer research has shown that it had an unusual anatomy, functioning more akin to a seal than a salamander, as previously assumed.

== History ==
In 1932 Gunnar Säve-Söderbergh described four &quot;Ichthyostega&quot; species from the Late Devonian of East Greenland and one species belonging to the genus &quot;Ichthyostegopsis&quot;, &quot;I. wimani&quot;. These species could be synonymous (in which case only &quot;I. stensioei&quot; would remain), because their morphological differences are not very pronounced. The species differ in skull proportions, skull punctuation and skull bone patterns. The comparisons were done on 14 specimens collected in 1931 by the Danish East Greenland Expedition. Additional specimens were collected between 1933 and 1955.

==Description==
&quot;Ichthyostega&quot; was a fairly large animal for its time, as it was broadly built and about 1.5 m (4.9 ft) long. The skull was low, with dorsally placed eyes and large labyrinthodont teeth. The posterior margin of the skull formed an operculum covering the gills. The spiracle was situated in an otic notch behind each eye. Computed tomography has revealed that &quot;Ichthyostega&quot; had a specialized ear, including a stapes with a unique morphology compared to other tetrapods or to any fish hyomandibula. 

=== Postcranial skeleton ===
The legs were large compared to contemporary relatives. It had seven digits on each hind leg, along with a peculiar, poorly ossified mass which lies anteriorly adjacent to the digits. The exact number of digits on the forelimb is not yet known, since fossils of the hand have not been found. While in water, the foot would have functioned like a fleshy paddle more than a fin.The vertebral column and ribcage of &quot;Ichthyostega&quot; was unusual and highly specialized relative to both its contemporaries and later tetrapods. The thoracic vertebrae at the front of the trunk and the short neck have tall neural spines that lean backwards. They attach to pointed ribs which increase in size and acquire prominent overlapping flanges. Past the sixth or seventh flanged rib, the ribs abruptly decrease in size and lose their flanges. The lumbar vertebrae at the back of the trunk have strong muscle scars and neural spines which are bent forwards and decrease in size towards the hips. The sacral vertebrae above the hips have fan-shaped neural spines that transition from forward-leaning to backward-leaning as they approach the tail. The vertebrae right behind the hips have unusually large ribs similar to those of the thoracic region. The caudal vertebrae have slender spines that lean backwards. The tail of &quot;Ichthyostega&quot; retained a low fin supported by bony lepidotrichia (fin rays). The tail fin was not as deep as in Acanthostega, and would have been less useful for swimming.

&quot;Ichthyostega&quot; is related to &quot;Acanthostega gunnari&quot;, which is also from what is now East Greenland. &quot;Ichthyostega&quot;&#x27;s skull seems more fish-like than that of &quot;Acanthostega&quot;, but had apelvic girdle morphology that seems stronger and better adapted to life on land. &quot;Ichthyostega&quot; also had more supportive ribs and stronger vertebrae with more developed zygapophyses. Whether or not these traits were independently evolved in &quot;Ichthyostega&quot; is debated. It does, however, show that &quot;Ichthyostega&quot; may have ventured onto land on occasions, unlike contemporaneous limbed vertebrates, such as &quot;Elginerpeton&quot; and &quot;Obruchevichthys&quot;.

==Classification==

Traditionally, &quot;Ichthyostega&quot; was considered part of an order named for it, the &quot;Ichthyostegalia&quot;. However, this group represents a paraphyletic grade of primitive stem-tetrapods and is not used by many modern researchers. Phylogenetic analysis has shown &quot;Ichthyostega&quot; is intermediate between other primitive stegocephalian stem-tetrapods. The evolutionary tree of early stegocephalians below follows the results of one such analysis performed by Swartz in 2012.

== Paleobiology ==
Early limbed vertebrates like &quot;Ichthyostega&quot; and &quot;Acanthostega&quot; differed from earlier tetrapodomorphs such as &quot;Eusthenopteron&quot; or &quot;Panderichthys&quot; in their increased adaptations for life on land. Though tetrapodomorphs possessed lungs, they used gills as their primary means of discharging carbon dioxide. Tetrapodomorphs used their bodies and tails for locomotion and their fins for steering and braking; &quot;Ichthyostega&quot; may have used its forelimbs for locomotion on land and its tail for swimming.Its massive ribcage was made up of overlapping ribs and the animal possessed a stronger skeletal structure, a largely fishlike spine, and forelimbs apparently powerful enough to pull the body from the water. These anatomical modifications may have been a result of selection to overcome the lack of buoyancy experienced on land. The hindlimbs were smaller than the forelimbs and unlikely to have borne full weight in an adult, while the broad, overlapping ribs would have inhibited side-to-side movements. The forelimbs had the required range of movement to push the body up and forward, probably allowing the animal to drag itself across flat land by synchronous (rather than alternate) &quot;crutching&quot; movements, much like that of a mudskipper or a seal. It was incapable of typical quadrupedal gaits as the forelimbs lacked the necessary rotary motion range.

<doc id="313934" wikidata="Q1353988" url="?curid=313934" title="Erik Jarvik">
<text>Anders Erik Vilhelm Jarvik (30 November 1907 – 11 January 1998) was a Swedish paleontologist who worked extensively on the sarcopterygian (or lobe-finned) fish &quot;Eusthenopteron&quot;. In a career that spanned some 60 years, Jarvik produced some of the most detailed anatomical work on this fish, making it arguably the best known fossil vertebrate.

Jarvik was born at a farm in Utby Parish near Mariestad in northern Västergötland. He studied botany, zoology, geology, and paleontology at Uppsala University, where he took his licentiate&#x27;s degree in 1937. In 1942, he completed his PhD with the dissertation &quot;On the structure of the snout of Crossopterygians and lower Gnathostomes in general&quot;. He participated in the Greenland expedition of Gunnar Säve-Söderbergh in 1932 and was appointed assistant in the Department of Palaeozoology of the Swedish Museum of Natural History in Stockholm in 1937; he eventually succeeded Erik Stensiö as professor and head of the department in 1960, retiring in 1972.

==Research==
Jarvik&#x27;s research concerned mainly the sarcopterygian fishes. His main interests were in the so-called &quot;rhipidistian&quot; sarcopterygian fishes, which he held to be divided into two groups: the Osteolepiformes and the Porolepiformes. He published several solidly descriptive works on Devonian sarcopterygians.

After the death of Säve-Söderbergh, Jarvik was tasked with investigating and fully describing the anatomy of &quot;Ichthyostega&quot;. His work resulted in a 1996 monograph with an extensive photographic documentation of the material collected in 1929–1955.

=== Work on &quot;Eusthenopteron&quot; ===

In particular, he conducted detailed anatomical studies of the cranium of &quot;Eusthenopteron foordi&quot; using a serial-section technique introduced by William Johnson Sollas and applied to fossil fishes by Erik Stensiö. A fossil of limited external quality was sectioned by grinding off a thin section, photographing the grind-off end and repeat the process until the whole fossil was worked through. The internal structures would then show up on long series of photographs. Working in the day before computer simulations, models were made by projecting reversal film on a board, and cut thin wax plates to match. The sticky wax plates could then be assembled to a three-dimensional scaled-up model of the skull, complete with internal structures such as nerve channels and other internal hollows rarely seen in fossils. Further section to the cranium could easily be made by cutting the wax model at the desired angle. Due to the sticky nature of the wax used, a sectioned skull was put back together by simply pressing the two sections back together. This technique was also applied to the cranium of the porolepiform &quot;Glyptolepis groenlandica&quot;.

=== Hypotheses on amphibian phylogeny ===

Jarvik was deeply involved in the debate over the principal structure and homology of the vertebrate head, and he was responsible for a controversial proposal regarding the origin of the tetrapods. He proposed, on the basis of detailed analyses of the snout and nasal capsule structures as well as the intermandibular, neuroepiphysial, and occipital regions, that Tetrapoda was biphyletic. In his view, the anatomical details of the Caudata (salamanders) bound them to the primitive &quot;porolepiform&quot; fishes, while all other tetrapods (“eutetrapods”) – apodans possibly excepted – were descended from primitive osteolepiforms. Thus, in his view Amphibia had arisen twice.

On the basis of his findings, he argued that Amphibia should be split, with salamanders (and possibly caecilians) in one class (the Urodelomorpha), and the frogs as a separate class, the Batrachomorpha. The Lepospondyli were considered to be possible urodelomorphans, while the &quot;labyrinthodonts&quot; were thought to be batrachomorphs. Jarvik&#x27;s ideas was never widely accepted, though Friedrich von Huene did include his system in systematic treatment of tetrapods. Few other supported his ideas, and today it has been abandoned by vertebrate paleontologists. The term &quot;Batrachomorpha&quot; is still occasionally used in a cladistic sense to denote labyrinthodonts more closely related to modern amphibians than to amniotes.

=== Lungfish phylogeny ===
Jarvik also studied the anatomy and relationships of lungfish which he held to be relatively primitive gnathostomes, possibly related to holocephalans, and of acanthodians, which he considered to be elasmobranchs rather than osteichthyans. He made contributions to a number of classical problems in comparative anatomy, including the origin of the vertebrates the origin of the pectoral and pelvic girdles and paired fins, and the homologies of the frontal and parietal bones in fishes and tetrapods

==Legacy==
Some of Jarvik&#x27;s views did not accord with general opinion in vertebrate paleontology. However, his anatomical studies of &quot;Eusthenopteron foordi&quot; laid the foundations for modern studies of the transition from fishes to tetrapods. Jarvik was a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and French Academy of Sciences and Knight of the Order of Vasa. The lungfish &quot;Jarvikia&quot; and the osteolepiform &quot;Jarvikina&quot; are named after him.

<text>The Mitsubishi F-2 is a multirole fighter derived from the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon, and manufactured by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Lockheed Martin for the Japan Air Self-Defense Force, with a 60/40 split in manufacturing between Japan and the United States. The basis of the F-2&#x27;s design is the F-16 Agile Falcon, an unsuccessful offer by General Dynamics to provide a low-cost alternative for the Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) competition. Production started in 1996 and the first aircraft entered service in 2000.

The first 76 aircraft entered service by 2008, with a total of 98 airframes produced. The first active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar on a combat aircraft was the J/APG-1 introduced on the Mitsubishi F-2 in 1995.

The F-2 is nicknamed Viper Zero, a reference to the F-16&#x27;s unofficial nickname of &quot;Viper&quot; and the Mitsubishi A6M Zero.

The JASDF and its contractors considered developing a Japanese-designed, Japanese-produced replacement for the aging Mitsubishi F-1 fighter as early as 1981. A formal feasibility study commenced in 1985.

Japan&#x27;s initial intentions to develop the aircraft domestically built upon Japan&#x27;s previous success in producing the F-15J fighter under license from McDonnell Douglas.

Japanese defense contractors argued that they needed to build a new aircraft from the beginning in order to develop the skill of their engineers and, in turn, develop the Japanese aircraft industry.

As the program began to take formal shape in 1985, several United States officials raised concerns that the program would result in an inferior aircraft, and would weaken the U.S.–Japan defense relationship. Pentagon officials advocated co-production or co-development of an aircraft based on the F-16 or F/A-18 platform, as they believed that Japan would not agree to buy U.S. aircraft.

In early 1987, the United States, through Caspar Weinberger and other administration officials, began formally pressuring Japan to execute the project as a U.S.–Japan bilateral joint development. The timing of this lobbying coincided with the height of &quot;Japan bashing&quot; in the United States: the Toshiba-Kongsberg scandal, in which Toshiba was found to have sold propeller milling machinery to the Soviet Union in violation of COCOM sanctions, became public in May 1987. Japan&#x27;s negotiating stance changed amid the risk of deterioration in U.S.–Japan relations.

The Reagan administration and Nakasone government announced the joint project in October 1987.

Under a memorandum of understanding signed in November 1988, General Dynamics would provide its F-16 Fighting Falcon technology to Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, and would handle up to 45 percent of the development work as a joint principal contractor.

On the American side, senior officials in the U.S. State Department and Defense Department supported the project as a means for the U.S. to access Japanese technology and as a means of strengthening U.S.–Japan relations, but the Commerce Department and many members of Congress opposed the project due to the risk of strengthening Japan&#x27;s ability to compete with U.S. aerospace firms. Opponents in Congress argued that Japan should acquire American aircraft in order to offset the trade deficit between the two countries. More than twenty members of the Senate demanded official review of the deal.

After George H. W. Bush took office as president of the United States in January 1989, the U.S. government responded to domestic criticism of the deal by seeking &quot;clarification&quot; of the terms of the MOU, which the Japanese government viewed as an attempt to re-negotiate it. The Bush administration was particularly concerned with the risks of transferring technology to Japan.

Bush announced a revised agreement in April 1989, shortly before the resignation of his Japanese counterpart Noboru Takeshita, under which Japanese access to flight control and weapons control software was limited, while the U.S. was to have access to any new technology that Japan developed for the project. American contractors were guaranteed at least 40% of the production for the program. Congress ratified the deal in June 1989 while expressing official displeasure with it.

Japanese lawmaker Shintaro Ishihara was a vocal critic of the final deal, writing in 1990 that &quot;our Foreign Ministry and other Government agencies decided it was better to eat humble pie than incur Uncle Sam&#x27;s wrath on yet another bilateral issue,&quot; and pointing out that &quot;we give away our most advanced defense technology to the United States but pay licensing and patent fees for each piece of technology we use.&quot;

===Production===
Work started in the FS-X program, initially given the company designation Mitsubishi SX-3. In 1984 General Dynamics had offered an enlarged version of the F-16 to the US Air Force and considered entering it as a low cost alternative in the Advanced Tactical Fighter competition. Neither came to fruition, however this concept became the starting point for F-2 development. The F-2 used the wing design of the F-16 Agile Falcon, but much of the electronics was further updated to 1990s standards. Japan selected the fighter to replace the F-4EJ and supplement the F-15J, its main air superiority fighter. The program involved technology transfer from the U.S. to Japan and vice versa.

Responsibility for cost sharing was split 60% by Japan and 40% by the U.S. Lockheed Martin would manufacture all the aft fuselages and wing leading-edge flaps and eight of the ten left-hand wingboxes.

The F-2 program was controversial, because the unit cost, which includes development costs, is roughly four times that of a Block 50/52 F-16, which does not include development costs. Inclusion of development costs distorts the incremental unit cost (this happens with most modern military aircraft), though even at the planned procurement levels, the price per aircraft was somewhat high. The initial plan of 141 F-2s would have reduced the unit cost by up to (€7.5 million) per unit, not including reduced cost from mass production. As of 2008, 94 aircraft were planned.

The F-2&#x27;s maiden flight was on 7 October 1995. Later that year, the Japanese government approved an order for 141 (but that was soon cut to 130), to enter service by 1999; structural problems resulted in service entry being delayed until 2000. Because of issues with cost-efficiency, orders for the aircraft were curtailed to 98 (including four prototypes) in 2004. Flight testing of the four prototypes were conducted by the Japan Defense Agency at Gifu Air Field.

The last of 94 production aircraft ordered under contract was delivered to the Defense Ministry on 27 September 2011. During the roll-out ceremony of the last production F-2 fighter jet, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries confirmed that production of the F-2 would end and no more F-2 fighters will be produced by the manufacturer. there are 61 single-seaters flying, and 21 two-seat trainers.

==Design==
General Electric, Kawasaki, Honeywell, Raytheon, NEC, Hazeltine, and Kokusai Electric were among the primary component sub-contractors. Lockheed Martin supplied the aft fuselage, leading-edge slats, stores management system, a large percentage of wingboxes (as part of two-way technology transfer agreements), and other components. Kawasaki built the midsection of the fuselage, as well as the doors to the main wheel and the engine, while the forward fuselage and wings were built by Mitsubishi.

Some of the avionics were supplied by Lockheed Martin, and the digital fly-by-wire system was jointly developed by Japan Aviation Electric and Honeywell (formerly Allied Signal). Contractors for communication systems and IFF interrogators included: Raytheon, NEC, Hazeltine, and Kokusai Electric. The fire control radar, IRS, the mission computer, and the EW system were developed by Japan.

In addition, the flight control computer, the flight control laws and related computer software were essentially all developed and integrated by Japan. Final assembly was done in Japan, by MHI at its Komaki-South facility in Nagoya.

Larger wings give an aircraft better payload and maneuverability in proportion to its thrust, but also tend to add weight to the airframe in various ways. More weight can have negative effects on acceleration, climbing, payload, and range. To make the larger wings lighter, the skin, spars, ribs and cap of the wings were made from graphite-epoxy composite and co-cured in an autoclave. This was the first application of co-cured technology to a production tactical fighter.

This technology for the wings encountered some teething problems, but proved to be a leading-edge use of a technology that provides weight savings, improved range, and some stealth benefits. This technology was then transferred back to America, as part of the program&#x27;s industrial partnership.

The F-2 has three display screens, including a liquid crystal display from Yokogawa.

Mitsubishi used the existing F-16 design as a reference guide for design work, and more than 95% of F-16 engineering drawings are changed for F-2.

Some differences in the F-2 from the F-16A:
* a 25% larger wing area
* composite materials used to reduce overall weight and radar signature
* longer and wider nose to accommodate a J/APG-1/J/APG-2 active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar. Almost simultaneously with a single squadron of USAF F-15C Eagles, the F-2 was the first operational military aircraft in the world to feature an AESA radar, before the F-22 Raptor&#x27;s AN/APG-77 AESA radar.
* larger tailplane
* three-piece cockpit canopy
* Equipments and OFP related to the avionics system differ from the F-16 in many aspects.
* Original flight control system.
* capabilities for four ASM-1 or ASM-2 anti-ship missiles, four AAMs, and additional fuel tanks

Also, the F-2 is equipped with a drogue parachute, like the version of the F-16 used by South Korea, the Netherlands, Norway, Greece, Turkey, Indonesia, Taiwan, and Venezuela.

==Operational history==
On 7 February 2013, two Russian Air Force Sukhoi Su-27 fighters briefly entered Japanese airspace off Rishiri Island near Hokkaido, flying south over the Sea of Japan before turning back to the north. Four F-2 fighters were scrambled to visually confirm the Russian planes, warning them by radio to leave their airspace.

A photo taken by a JASDF pilot of one of the two Su-27s was released by the Japan Ministry of Defense. Russia denied the incursion, saying the jets were making routine flights near the disputed Kuril Islands.

On 22 August 2013, two Russian Tupolev Tu-142 Bear-F maritime patrol aircraft entered Japanese airspace near the major southern island of Kyushu for less than two minutes. F-2 fighters were scrambled in response.

==Variants==

* XF-2A: Single-seat prototypes.
* XF-2B: Two-seat prototypes.
* F-2A: Single-seat fighter version.
* F-2B: Two-seat training version.
* F-2A Super Kai: proposed variant with CFTs (conformal fuel tanks), based on the F-16C Block 60. It was intended to replace the F-4EJ Kai Phantom II. It was rejected when the F-35A Lightning II was chosen.

==Accidents and incidents==
* On 31 October 2007, an F-2B crashed during takeoff and subsequently caught fire at Nagoya Airfield in central Japan. The jet was being taken up on a test flight by Mitsubishi employees, after major maintenance and before being delivered to the JSDF. Both test pilots survived the incident with only minor injuries. It was eventually determined that improper wiring caused the crash.
* As a result of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, 18 F-2Bs belonging to the 21st Fighter Squadron at Matsushima Air Base were damaged or destroyed. Of these 18, 5 were deemed beyond repair and have been scrapped. The remaining 13 F-2s are being repaired at the estimated cost of . In the meantime, training duties carried out by the 21st Fighter Squadron have been transferred to other air bases. Repair work was completed by 2016, when the 21st Squadron returned to Matsushima.
* On 20 February 2019, an F-2B crashed during a training flight over the Sea of Japan. Both the flight instructor and pilot survived the accident.
* In April 2021, two F-2 jets (an F-2A and an F-2B) flying in formation, had a minor mid-air collision over Yamaguchi Prefecture. They safely landed afterwards with no reported injuries and little damage to the jets.

<text>Greenwood LeFlore or Greenwood Le Fleur (June 3, 1800 – August 31, 1865) served as the elected Principal Chief of the Choctaw in 1830 before removal. Before that, the nation was governed by three district chiefs and a council of chiefs. A wealthy and regionally influential Choctaw of mixed-race, who belonged to the Choctaw elite due to his mother&#x27;s rank, LeFlore had many connections in state and federal government. In 1830 LeFlore led other chiefs in signing the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek, which ceded the remaining Choctaw lands in Mississippi to the US government and agreed to removal to Indian Territory. It also provided that Choctaw who chose to stay in Mississippi would have reserved lands, but the United States government failed to follow through on this provision.

While many leaders argued that removal was inevitable, others opposed the treaty and made death threats against LeFlore. Ousted by the tribal council in a coup, he stayed in Mississippi, where he settled in Carroll County and accepted United States citizenship. He was elected to the state government as a legislator and senator in the 1840s. During the American Civil War, he sided with the Union.

==Background==
LeFlore was the first son of Rebecca Cravatt, a high-ranking Choctaw niece of the chief Pushmataha, and Louis LeFleur, a French fur trader and explorer from French Canada who worked for Panton, Leslie &amp; Company, based in Spanish Florida. 
 Because the Choctaw had a matrilineal system for property and hereditary leadership, LeFlore gained elite status from his mother&#x27;s family and clan. By the 1820s, as the historian Greg O&#x27;Brien notes, the Choctaw called such mixed-race children &quot;itibapishi toba&quot; (to become a brother or sister), which emphasized the connection to Choctaw, or &quot;issish iklanna&quot; (half-blood), which seemed to imitate Euro-American concepts. O&#x27;Brien notes the importance of their being first of all, part of the Choctaw elites. Choctaw chiefs recognized the advantage of using such mixed-race elite men as &quot;trailblazers into an unprecedented universe of capitalist accumulation and renewable wealth.&quot;

Some, like LeFlore, gained a Euro-American education that enabled them to negotiate the changing world developing in the American South. When LeFlore was twelve, his father sent him to Nashville to be educated by Americans.

==Marriage and family==
At age 17, LeFlore married Rosa Donley in Nashville, whom he met there and brought back with him to the Choctaw Nation when he returned in 1817. After her death in 1829 he married again twice. He married Elizabeth Coody (or Cody) in 1830. He married Priscilla Donley in 1834. Priscilla was the sister of his first wife. His children were Elizabeth Donley Leflore Halsey, John Donley &quot;Jack&quot; Leflore, Jane G. Leflore Spring &amp; Rebecca Cravat Leflore Harris. 

==Advocate of civilization==
While LeFlore was not said to be popular among the full-blood tribal men, he became powerful and influential within the tribe at an early age, largely because of his mother&#x27;s clan and maternal uncle&#x27;s position and his own skills. With other leaders, he struggled to resist European-American encroachment while adapting to some of the new ways and the increasing pressure from the United States government in support of removal.

When Leflore was 22, he became a chief of the western division of the Choctaw Nation, when it was still in Mississippi. He is credited with abolishing the Choctaw &quot;blood for blood&quot; law, which dictated rounds of revenge for murders. LeFlore supported the &quot;civilization&quot; program, which U.S. President George Washington and Henry Knox developed during the Washington administration. Particularly after Andrew Jackson&#x27;s election as president in 1828, he encouraged the Choctaw to make permanent residences, cultivate the land in agriculture, convert to Christianity, and send their children to United States schools for education.

==Removal or U.S. citizenship==

Despite being recognized as one of the &quot;Five Civilized Tribes&quot;, the Choctaw were under pressure from encroaching European-American settlers. The settlers kept entering the Choctaw Nation lands in great numbers. The US government wanted to remove the Choctaw to lands west of the Mississippi River.

With the election of Andrew Jackson as president in 1828, who supported Indian removal, many Choctaw claimed that removal was inevitable. They concluded they could not give armed resistance. After passage of the Indian Removal Act of 1830, the chiefs of the western and eastern districts resigned, and on March 15, 1830, the council elected LeFlore as principal chief, the first time that power had been so centralized among the Choctaw. He drafted a treaty which he sent to Washington, to try to secure the best terms for the Choctaw.

United States representatives came out to the Choctaw for a treaty council, where LeFlore used his formidable personal political capital and position as head of a unified tribe to secure the largest and most desirable areas of what would later be called Indian Territory. In addition, he believed that Article XIV would be honored and allow the Choctaw to keep some reserves in Mississippi. He regarded removal as inevitable, given his assessment of the politics and the sheer numbers of the growing European-American population.

The treaty included provisions allowing those Choctaw who chose to do so, to remain in Mississippi and become a citizen of the United States.

ART. XIV. Each Choctaw head of a family being desirous to remain and become a citizen of the States, shall be permitted to do so, by signifying his intention to the Agent within six months from the ratification of this Treaty, and he or she shall thereupon be entitled to a reservation of one section of six hundred and forty acres of land, to be bounded by sectional lines of survey; in like manner shall be entitled to one half that quantity for each unmarried child which is living with him over ten years of age; and a quarter section to such child as may be under 10 years of age, to adjoin the location of the parent. If they reside upon said lands intending to become citizens of the States for five years after the ratification of this Treaty, in that case a grant in fee simple shall issue; said reservation shall include the present improvement of the head of the family, or a portion of it. Persons who claim under this article shall not lose the privilege of a Choctaw citizen, but if they ever remove are not to be entitled to any portion of the Choctaw annuity.
William Ward, who was the U.S. agent for the Indians, &quot;refused to enroll the Choctaw claimants&#x27; reserves&quot; in Mississippi, which undermined LeFlore&#x27;s objectives for the treaty and led him to consider it a failure.

LeFlore&#x27;s accomplishments in unifying and strengthening the Choctaw people are still honored as the historian James Taylor Carson writes, &quot;He was a Choctaw nationalist who sought to carve out a new and powerful nation for his people within the Cotton Kingdom of the Old South.&quot; His pragmatic approach to their removal from ancestral lands is still controversial.

Many Choctaw at the time believed that LeFlore had let them down and could have refused removal. Mushulatubbee, who had resigned, took back his office as Chief of the Western Division (which would later become the new Choctaw Nation in the post-removal Indian Territory), and rejected many of the civilizing measures which the national council had ordered during the previous two years. The Western Division council led a movement to depose LeFlore, and in a successful coup, they elected his nephew George W. Harkins in his place.

Jackson and other American leaders at the time had generally low opinions of mixed-race leaders, related more to their own ideas of race than an ability to appraise the Native American leaders. Carson believes that such negative opinions have affected the writing of historians for decades and their assessments of men such as LeFlore. He considers LeFlore and leaders like him to have been a new Creole generation, raised as Choctaw but absorbing what they could of the changing world to make a place for their peoples.

In the event, the Choctaw were awarded the largest territory of any removed tribe. It was located in the fertile, forested southeast corner of what is now Oklahoma. LeFlore did receive a grant of land in Mississippi, for 1,000 acres (4 km²) of land (his grant by the treaty, including allowances for unmarried children living with him.)

==LeFlore as a U.S. citizen==

In the 1840s, LeFlore was elected Mississippi representative and senator. He was a fixture of Mississippi high society and a personal friend of Jefferson Davis. He was elected to represent Carroll County in the state house for two terms, and elected by the legislature as a state senator, serving one term. He became a wealthy planter and amassed a huge estate, where slaves worked acres of cotton. When a woman named Arena James died in 1939, it was reported that she was the last surviving slave and had been at Malmaison from her birth in 1829 until emancipation. During the American Civil War Leflore opposed the Confederacy and secession. He sided with the Union when Mississippi seceded from the United States. When federal troops approached his property, he offered them assistance and said he was happy to see &quot;the old flag again carried by United States Soldiers.&quot;

==Malmaison==

Leflore wanted a manor house that befitted his status as a wealthy planter. He commissioned James Harris, a Georgian, to design it. Leflore was an admirer of Napoleon Bonaparte and Josephine, and had the house designed in French style. When he sought a name for the house, &quot;he decided on the name of the Château de Malmaison, ten miles west of Paris on the Seine.&quot; LeFlore called his Carroll County home &quot;Malmaison&quot;. LeFlore occupied the Malmaison until his death in 1865.

To furnish his mansion, LeFlore imported most of the furniture from France, where it had been made to order. Silver, glass, and china came in sets of dozens. The drawing room set was of 30 pieces of solid mahogany, finished in genuine gold and upholstered in silk damask. The house held mirrors, tables, large four-poster beds of rosewood with silken and satin canopies, and four tapestry curtains depicting the four palaces of Napoleon and Josephine: Versailles, Malmaison, Saint Cloud and Fontainebleau.

Malmaison was one of the show places of Mississippi. It was a great tourist attraction and was visited annually by hundreds from all parts of the United States. Around it clung the memories of the transition of Mississippi from Indian territory to its present status.

LeFlore descendants used the mansion until it was destroyed in a fire in 1942. The cause of the fire remains unknown. Only a few pieces of crystal and silver, and some chairs were salvaged from the ruins of the mansion. The horse carriage used to transport LeFlore to visit Andrew Jackson and other Washington, D.C. officials was also saved and has been preserved. Artifacts and furniture from Malmaison including a bedroom set, paintings, and children&#x27;s toys are on display in the Malmaison Room at the Museum of the Mississippi Delta.

==American Civil War and death==

LeFlore was a Southern Unionist. He was openly and notoriously opposed to succession and to the rebellion throughout its progress. In retaliation, a party of rebels fired on his home and attempted to set fire to Malmaison. Leflore is said to have defied them, and calling for a United States flag declared his intention to die there under its folds. He died a few months after the war ended at the age of 65. He left, in addition to the mansion, an estate of 15,000 acres and 400 slaves. With emancipation any slaves became freedmen, but many may have stayed on the plantation to work. It is said that Malmaison contributed voluntarily and largely to assist the United States Army when they arrived in February 1864. LeFlore was buried wrapped in the American flag, on the estate.

Carson describes LeFlore:

He was first and foremost a man whose family had positioned him to draw together Choctaw and Anglo-American worlds. He owned slaves which became freedmen, read and wrote, and prayed at camp meetings, but he also presided over a political hierarchy of pipe lighters and captains, provided food, shelter, and educational opportunities for his followers, and promulgated his vision of the Choctaw future at the foot of the mound [Nanih Waiya] that had given his people life.

<text>The piccolo heckelphone is a very rare woodwind instrument invented in 1905 by the firm of Wilhelm Heckel in Wiesbaden-Biebrich, Germany. A variant of the heckelphone, the piccolo heckelphone was intended to add power to the very highest woodwind register of the late Romantic orchestra, providing a full and rich oboe-like sound well into the sopranino range. A transposing instrument pitched in F, a perfect fourth above the oboe, its written range is from B3 to E6, though it can reach tones as much as a third above this.

Following the basic principle of the heckelphone, the piccolo heckelphone in F has an extremely wide bore with large tone holes. The angle of the instrument&#x27;s conicity is quite wide (though not as wide as that of a saxophone), giving it a characteristically strong and powerful tone. The instrument is built in one section with a detachable bell and has simple-system German fingering.

Richard Strauss, who scored for the heckelphone on a number of occasions, was an early enthusiast of the piccolo heckelphone, even using it in a performance of Bach&#x27;s second &quot;Brandenburg Concerto&quot;, where it played the solo trumpet part in the final movement. In 1915, Strauss requested that a piccolo heckelphone in E be built for use in his composition &quot;Eine Alpensinfonie&quot;. Named the terz-heckelphon, Strauss ultimately did not score for it, though a handful were built.

The piccolo heckelphone never became popular, for a number of reasons. Its esoteric name likely did not help matters. Furthermore, with the trend toward economical orchestration following the excesses of the Romantic period, massive sonorities and (by extension) instruments capable of cutting through quadruple wind sections became much less necessary. Finally, the instrument was only ever produced in extremely small numbers, with the last one built in 1955. According to company records, only eight instruments were ever sold.

Altogether, 13 piccolo heckelphones were completed. A further five have remained &#x27;blanks&#x27;: assigned serial numbers, but not fitted with keys. Two are preserved at the Heckel museum in Biebrich, one is in a museum in Russia, and there is also a piccolo heckelphone at the University of Leipzig&#x27;s Musical Instrument Museum. Only one is known to be in active use. Of the rest, some may have been lost or destroyed, or may be in the hands of private collectors awaiting discovery.

Despite the extreme rarity of the instrument, there does exist a repertoire, albeit a very small one. In 1971, the German composer Hans-Joachim Hespos composed a trio for piccolo heckelphone, basset-horn, and cello entitled &quot;Fahl-Brüchig&quot;, which has been performed several times and recorded by German radio. More recently, a number of composers have expressed interest in the instrument and some are writing for it again. A revival appears to be underway.

In recent years, rumors have circulated that Heckel is planning on bringing the piccolo heckelphones in F and E back into production on a limited basis. Were a modern version produced, it could well prove to be a great asset to contemporary composers, providing an alternative to the less powerful piccolo oboe (oboe musette or musette oboe) in F or E.

<doc id="313942" wikidata="Q1868524" url="?curid=313942" title="Local search (optimization)">
<text>In computer science, local search is a heuristic method for solving computationally hard optimization problems. Local search can be used on problems that can be formulated as finding a solution that maximizes a criterion among a number of candidate solutions. Local search algorithms move from solution to solution in the space of candidate solutions (the &quot;search space&quot;) by applying local changes, until a solution deemed optimal is found or a time bound is elapsed.

Local search algorithms are widely applied to numerous hard computational problems, including problems from computer science (particularly artificial intelligence), mathematics, operations research, engineering, and bioinformatics. Examples of local search algorithms are WalkSAT, the 2-opt algorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problem and the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm. 

While it is sometimes possible to substitute gradient descent for a local search algorithm, gradient descent is not in the same family: although it is an iterative method for local optimization, it relies on an objective function’s gradient rather than an explicit exploration of the solution space.

== Examples ==
Some problems where local search has been applied are:

# The vertex cover problem, in which a solution is a vertex cover of a graph, and the target is to find a solution with a minimal number of nodes
# The traveling salesman problem, in which a solution is a cycle containing all nodes of the graph and the target is to minimize the total length of the cycle
# The Boolean satisfiability problem, in which a candidate solution is a truth assignment, and the target is to maximize the number of clauses satisfied by the assignment; in this case, the final solution is of use only if it satisfies &quot;all&quot; clauses
# The nurse scheduling problem where a solution is an assignment of nurses to shifts which satisfies all established constraints
# The k-medoid clustering problem and other related facility location problems for which local search offers the best known approximation ratios from a worst-case perspective
# The Hopfield Neural Networks problem involves finding stable configurations in Hopfield network.

== Description ==
Most problems can be formulated in terms of a search space and target in several different ways. For example, for the traveling salesman problem a solution can be a route visiting all cities and the goal is to find the shortest route. But a solution can also be a path, and being a cycle is part of the target.

A local search algorithm starts from a candidate solution and then iteratively moves to a neighboring solution; a neighborhood being the set of all potential solutions that differ from the current solution by the minimal possible extent. This requires a neighborhood relation to be defined on the search space. As an example, the neighborhood of vertex cover is another vertex cover only differing by one node. For Boolean satisfiability, the neighbors of a Boolean assignment are those that have a single variable in an opposite state. The same problem may have multiple distinct neighborhoods defined on it; local optimization with neighborhoods that involve changing up to &quot;k&quot; components of the solution is often referred to as k-opt.

Typically, every candidate solution has more than one neighbor solution; the choice of which one to select is taken using only information about the solutions in the neighborhood of the current assignment, hence the name &quot;local&quot; search. When the choice of the neighbor solution is done by taking the one locally maximizing the criterion, i.e.: a greedy search, the metaheuristic takes the name hill climbing.
When no improving neighbors are present, local search is stuck at a locally optimal point.
This local-optima problem can be cured by using restarts (repeated local search with different initial conditions), randomization, or more complex schemes based on iterations, like iterated local search, on memory, like reactive search optimization, on memory-less stochastic modifications, like simulated annealing.

Local search does not provide a guarantee that any given solution is optimal. 
The search can terminate after a given time bound or when the best solution found thus far has not improved in a given number of steps. Local search is an anytime algorithm; it can return a valid solution even if it&#x27;s interrupted at any time after finding the first valid solution. 
Local search is typically an approximation or incomplete algorithm because the search may stop even if the current best solution found is not optimal. This can happen even if termination happens because the current best solution could not be improved, as the optimal solution can lie far from the neighborhood of the solutions crossed by the algorithm.

Schuurman &amp; Southey propose three measures of effectiveness for local search (depth, mobility, and coverage): 
* depth: the cost of the current (best) solution; 
* mobility: the ability to rapidly move to different areas of the search space (whilst keeping the cost low); 
* coverage: how systematically the search covers the search space, the maximum distance between any unexplored assignment and all visited assignments. 
They hypothesize that local search algorithms work well, not because they have some understanding of the search space but because they quickly move to promising regions, and explore the search space at low depths as quickly, broadly, and systematically as possible.

* Tabu search
* Late acceptance hill climbing
* Reactive search optimization (combining machine learning and local search heuristics)

===Real-valued search-spaces===
Several methods exist for performing local search of real-valued search-spaces:
* Luus–Jaakola searches locally using a uniform distribution and an exponentially decreasing search-range.
* Random optimization searches locally using a normal distribution.
* Random search searches locally by sampling a hypersphere surrounding the current position.
* Pattern search takes steps along the axes of the search-space using exponentially decreasing step sizes.

<text>Circular reasoning (, &quot;circle in proving&quot;; also known as circular logic) is a logical fallacy in which the reasoner begins with what they are trying to end with. Circular reasoning is not a formal logical fallacy, but a pragmatic defect in an argument whereby the premises are just as much in need of proof or evidence as the conclusion. As a consequence, the argument becomes a matter of faith and fails to persuade those who don&#x27;t already accept it. Other ways to express this are that there is no reason to accept the premises unless one already believes the conclusion, or that the premises provide no independent ground or evidence for the conclusion. Circular reasoning is closely related to begging the question, and in modern usage the two generally refer to the same thing.

Circular reasoning is often of the form: &quot;A is true because B is true; B is true because A is true.&quot; Circularity can be difficult to detect if it involves a longer chain of propositions.

An example of circular reasoning is: &quot;Alkaline water is healthy because it results in health benefits, and it has health benefits because it is healthy&quot;.

==History==
The problem of circular reasoning has been noted in Western philosophy at least as far back as the Pyrrhonist philosopher Agrippa who includes the problem of circular reasoning among his Five Tropes of Agrippa. The Pyrrhonist philosopher Sextus Empiricus described the problem of circular reasoning as &quot;the reciprocal trope&quot;: 

The reciprocal trope occurs when what ought to be confirmatory of the object under investigation needs to be made convincing by the object under investigation; then, being unable to take either in order to establish the other, we suspend judgement about both.

==The problem of induction==
Joel Feinberg and Russ Shafer-Landau note that &quot;using the scientific method to judge the scientific method is circular reasoning&quot;. Scientists attempt to discover the laws of nature and to predict what will happen in the future, based on those laws. The laws of nature are arrived at through inductive reasoning. David Hume&#x27;s problem of induction demonstrates that one must appeal to the &quot;principle of the uniformity of nature&quot; if they seek to justify their implicit assumption that laws which held true in the past will also hold true in the future. Since the principle of the uniformity of nature is itself an inductive principle, any justification for induction must be circular. But as Bertrand Russell observed, &quot;The method of &#x27;postulating&#x27; what we want has many advantages; they are the same as the advantages of theft over honest toil&quot;.

<doc id="313948" wikidata="Q4878104" url="?curid=313948" title="Beaver Lake (Arkansas)">
<text>Beaver Lake is a man-made reservoir in the Ozark Mountains of Northwest Arkansas and is formed by a dam across the White River. Beaver Lake has some of shoreline. With towering limestone bluffs, natural caves, and a wide variety of trees and flowering shrubs, it is a popular tourist destination. Beaver Lake is the source of drinking water in Northwest Arkansas, which is managed, treated and sold by Beaver Water District, serving more than 450,000 customers. One out of 7 people in Arkansas get their drinking water from Beaver Lake.

==Beaver Dam==

Beaver Dam was authorized by the Flood Control Act of 1944 and other following acts. The United States Army Corps of Engineers constructed Beaver Dam during the years 1960–1966, impounding a major part of the White River and creating Beaver Lake and flooding much of the valley including the remains of the historic resort town Monte Ne. The dam is located northwest of Eureka Springs, Arkansas. Construction of the powerhouse and switch yard began in 1963. Power generation began in May 1965 and continues today. The initial cost of the project was $60 million. The lake is approximately in length and covers approximately , with about of shoreline and an elevation of . This is also the first dam in the tailwater chain to provide cold water fishery along the White River.

==Recreation==
The Army Corps of Engineers has also constructed a variety of recreational facilities around the lake. Paved access roads wind through twelve developed parks. These parks have modern campsites offering electricity and fire rings with drinking water, showers, and restrooms nearby. Other facilities, such as picnic sites, swimming beaches, hiking trails, boat launching ramps, and sanitary dump stations are also available in the parks. There are 12 recreation areas with 677 campsites along with 7 full-service commercial marina concessions, which hold 1,750 rental slips. There are 9 limited motel / resort leases and 28 boat ramps licensed to County or State. There are 8 national bass tournaments per year and many other fishing tournaments. There are 3.1 million visitors annually.

The Hobbs State Park-Conservation Area (formerly known as the Beaver Lake State Park) is the only State Park in Benton County, Arkansas.
==Geography==
The majority of Beaver Lake is located in Benton County. The dam itself is located in west Carroll County. Parts of the lake extend into Washington County and Madison County.

U.S. Route 62 runs along the north and west sides of Beaver Lake.

== Hydropower ==
The powerplant operates two main 56 MW turbines in one house unit. Total power generation capacity is 6,347,345 MWh. The revenue from power generation is returned to the US federal government to pay for the purchase price of the dam. Unit 2 of the hydropower complex has been offline since 2016. Both hydropower units are currently undergoing stator rewind and other rehabilitation by Andritz Hydro Corp for $14.6M and as of Mar. 2023 scheduled to be back online by Nov. 7, 2023.

==Flood control==

Beaver Lake is the first of several flood control lakes on the White river watershed. Beaver Lakes holds back flood water from Table Rock Lake. The estimated flood damages prevented in 2007 are $1.3 million. Since its creation, the Beaver Lake is estimated to have prevented $52.5 billion in damage.

Known as the &quot;Redbud City,&quot; the town hosts &quot;Redbud Day&quot; annually the Saturday before Mother&#x27;s Day, organizing a variety of themed events to recognize the tree.

==Description==
The eastern redbud typically grows to tall with an spread. It generally has a short, often twisted trunk and spreading branches. A 10-year-old tree will generally be around tall. The bark is dark in color, smooth, later scaly with ridges somewhat apparent, sometimes with maroon patches. The twigs are slender and zigzag, nearly black in color, spotted with lighter lenticels. The winter buds are tiny, rounded and dark red to chestnut in color. The leaves are alternate, simple, and heart shaped with an entire margin, long and wide, thin and papery, and may be slightly hairy below.

The flowers are showy, light to dark magenta pink in color, long, appearing in clusters from spring to early summer, on bare stems before the leaves, sometimes on the trunk itself. There are cultivars with white flowers. The flowers are pollinated by long-tongued bees such as blueberry bees and carpenter bees. Short-tongued bees cannot reach the nectaries. The fruit are flattened, dry, brown, pea-like pods, long that contain flat, elliptical, brown seeds long, maturing in August to October.


* Bark: Red brown, with deep fissures and scaly surface. Branchlets at first lustrous brown, later become darker.
* Wood: Dark reddish brown; heavy, hard, coarse-grained, not strong. Sp. gr., 0.6363; weight of cu. ft. 39.65 lbs.
* Winter buds: Chestnut brown, obtuse, one-eighth inch long.
* Cotyledons oval, flat
* Leaves: Alternate, simple, heart-shaped or broadly ovate, two to five inches long, five to seven-nerved, cordate or truncate at the base, entire, acute. They come out of the bud folded along the line of the midrib, tawny green; when they are full grown they become smooth, dark green above, paler beneath. In autumn they turn bright clear yellow. Petioles slender, terete, enlarged at the base. Stipules caducous.
* Flowers: April, May, before and with the leaves, papilionaceous. Perfect, rose color, borne four to eight together, in fascicles which appear at the axils of the leaves or along the branch and sometimes on the trunk itself.
* Calyx: Dark red, campanulate, oblique, five-toothed, imbricate in bud.
* Corolla: Papilionaceous, petals five, nearly equal, pink or rose color, upper petal the smallest, enclosed in the bud by the wings, and encircled by the broader keel petals.
* Stamens: Ten, inserted in two rows on a thin disk, free, the inner row rather shorter than the others.
* Pistil: Ovary superior, inserted obliquely in the bottom of the calyx tube, stipitate; style fleshy, incurved, tipped with an obtuse stigma.
* Fruit: Legume, slightly stipitate, unequally oblong, acute at each end. Compressed, tipped with the remnants of the style, straight on upper and curved on the lower edge. Two and a half to three inches long, rose color, full grown by midsummer, falls in early winter. Seeds ten to twelve, chestnut brown, one-fourth of an inch long.

==Subspecies==
Three subspecies are accepted:
*&quot;Cercis canadensis&quot; subsp. &quot;canadensis&quot; (synonyms &quot;C. dilatata, C. ellipsoidea&quot;, and &quot;C. georgiana&quot;) – eastern and Central United States to northeastern and central Mexico
*&quot;Cercis canadensis&quot; subsp. &quot;mexicana&quot; (synonym &quot;C. mexicana&quot;) – northeastern Mexico, southwestern Texas (Trans-Pecos), southeastern New Mexico
*&quot;Cercis canadensis&quot; subsp. &quot;texensis&quot; (synonyms &quot;C nitida, C. reniformis&quot;, and &quot;C. texensis&quot;) Oklahoma redbud – Oklahoma and Texas east of the Pecos River

==Ecological benefits==
The leaves are eaten by the caterpillars of some Lepidoptera—for example, Henry&#x27;s elfin, the redbud leaffolder, the red-humped caterpillar (which can cause extensive defoliation in late summer but generally does no lasting harm to a healthy tree), the fall webworm (also a late-season defoliator), the white flannel moth, the American dagger moth, the grape leaffolder, and the Io moth.

==Cultivation==
&quot;Cercis canadensis&quot; is grown in parks and gardens, with several cultivars being available. The cultivars &#x27;Forest Pansy&#x27;
and &#x27;Ruby Falls&#x27; 
have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit (confirmed 2017). Both are cultivated for their showy purple leaves, which turn brilliant shades of red and orange in the fall (autumn). &#x27;Ruby Falls&#x27; is a weeping form.

In the wild, eastern redbud is a frequent native understory tree in mixed forests and hedgerows. It is also much planted as a landscape ornamental plant.

In the United States, this tree is difficult to grow farther west into arid areas west of western Kansas and Colorado, as there is not enough rain. There has been success growing the tree in Columbus, Wisconsin, whose cultivar has become known as the &quot;Columbus strain&quot; and is a seed source for nurseries. Seeds can be made to germinate by first dipping in boiled (99 °C) water for one minute and then sowing in a pot (do not boil the seeds).

&quot;Cercis canadensis var. mexicana&quot; are tolerant of high salinity levels allowing them to grow more effectively in areas similar to the southwestern United States.

==Uses==

The flowers can be eaten fresh or fried.

In some parts of southern Appalachia, green twigs from the eastern redbud are used as seasoning for wild game such as venison and opossum. Because of this, in these mountain areas the eastern redbud is sometimes known as the spicewood tree.

Native Americans consume redbud flowers raw or boiled, and eat roasted seeds. Analysis of nutritional components in edible parts of eastern redbud reported that the flower extract contains anthocyanins, green developing seeds contained proanthocyanidin, and linolenic, α-linolenic, oleic and palmitic acids are present in seeds.

<doc id="313953" wikidata="Q1155708" url="?curid=313953" title="Lenticel">
<text>A lenticel is a porous tissue consisting of cells with large intercellular spaces in the periderm of the secondarily thickened organs and the bark of woody stems and roots of gymnosperms and dicotyledonous flowering plants. It functions as a pore, providing a pathway for the direct exchange of gases between the internal tissues and atmosphere through the bark, which is otherwise impermeable to gases. The name lenticel, pronounced with an , derives from its lenticular (lens-like) shape. The shape of lenticels is one of the characteristics used for tree identification.

==Evolution==

Before there was much evidence for the existence and functionality of lenticels, the fossil record has shown the first primary mechanism of aeration in early vascular plants to be the stomata. 

However, in woody plants, while the respiratory function of stomata is retained in the living epidermis of leaves and green stems, that function is lost where the epidermis of trunks and branches is displaced by vascular and cork cambial activity and by secondary growth. In such parts the entire epidermis may be shed as it is replaced by a suberized periderm or bark in which the respiratory functions of the stomata may be replaced by lenticels, at least until the bark becomes too thick.

The extinct arboreal plants of the genera &quot;Lepidodendron&quot; and &quot;Sigillaria&quot; were the first to have distinct aeration structures that rendered these modifications. &quot;Parichnoi&quot; (singular: parichnos) are canal-like structures that, in association with foliar traces of the stem, connected the stem&#x27;s outer and middle cortex to the mesophyll of the leaf. Parichnoi were thought to eventually give rise to lenticels as they helped solve the issue of long-range oxygen transport in these woody plants during the Carboniferous period. They also acquired secondary connections as they evolved to become transversely elongated to efficiently aerate the maximum number of vertical rays as well as the central core tissue of the stem. The evolutionary significance of parichnoi was their functionality in the absence of cauline stomata, where they can also be affected and destroyed by pressure similar to what can damage to stomatal tissue. Evidently, in both conifers and Lepidodendroids, the parichnoi, as the primary lenticular structure, appear as paired structures on either side of leaf scars. The development and increase in the number of these primitive lenticels were key to providing a system that was open for aeration and gas exchange in these plants.

==Structure and development==

In plant bodies that produce secondary growth, lenticels promote gas exchange of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and water vapor. Lenticel formation usually begins beneath stomatal complexes during primary growth preceding the development of the first periderm. The formation of lenticels seem to be directly related to the growth and strength of the shoot and on the hydrose of the tissue, which refers to the internal moisture. As stems and roots mature lenticel development continues in the new periderm (for example, periderm that forms at the bottom of cracks in the bark).

Lenticels are found as raised circular, oval, or elongated areas on stems and roots. In woody plants, lenticels commonly appear as rough, cork-like structures on young branches. Underneath them, porous tissue creates a number of large intercellular spaces between cells. This tissue fills the lenticel and arises from cell division in the phellogen or substomatal ground tissue. Discoloration of lenticels may also occur, such as in mangoes, that may be due to the amount of lignin in cell walls.

In oxygen deprived conditions, making respiration a daily challenge, different species may possess specialized structures where lenticels can be found. For example, in a common mangrove species, lenticels appear on pneumatophores (specialized roots), where the parenchyma cells that connect to the aerenchyma structure increase in size and go through cell division. In contrast, lenticels in grapes are located on the pedicels and act as a function of temperature. If they are blocked, hypoxia and successive ethanol accumulation may result and lead to cell death.

==Fruits==

Lenticels are also present on many fruits, quite noticeably on many apples and pears. On European pears, they can serve as an indicator of when to pick the fruit, as light lenticels on the immature fruit darken and become brown and shallow from the formation of cork cells. Certain bacterial and fungal infections can penetrate fruits through their lenticels, with susceptibility sometimes increasing with its age.

While the term lenticel is usually associated with the breakage of periderm tissue that is associated with gas exchange, it also refers to the lightly colored spots found on apples (a type of pome fruit). &quot;Lenticel&quot; seems to be the most appropriate term to describe both structures mentioned in light of their similar function in gas exchange. Pome lenticels can be derived from no longer functioning stomata, epidermal breaks from the removal of trichomes, and other epidermal breaks that usually occur in the early development of young pome fruits. The closing of pome lenticels can arise when the cuticle over the stomata opening or the substomatal layer seals. Closing can also begin if the substomatal cells become suberized, like cork. The number of lenticels usually varies between the species of apples, where the range may be from 450 to 800 or from 1500 to 2500 in Winesap and Spitzenburg apples, respectively. This wide range may be due to the water availability during the early stages of development of each apple type.

&quot;Lenticel breakdown&quot; is a global skin disorder of apples in which lenticels develop dark 1–8 mm diameter pits shortly after processing and packing. It is most common on the &#x27;Gala&#x27; (&quot;Malus&quot; × &quot;domestica&quot;) variety, particularly the &#x27;Royal Gala&#x27;, and also occurs in &#x27;Fuji&#x27;, &#x27;Granny Smith&#x27;, &#x27;Golden Delicious&#x27;, and &#x27;Delicious&#x27; varieties. It is more common in arid regions, and is thought to be related to relative humidity and temperature. The effect can be mitigated by spraying the fruit with lipophilic coatings prior to harvest.

==Tubers==
Lenticels are also present on potato tubers.

<text>The Sunset Strip is the stretch of Sunset Boulevard that passes through the city of West Hollywood, California, United States. It extends from West Hollywood&#x27;s eastern border with the city of Los Angeles near Marmont Lane to its western border with Beverly Hills at Phyllis Street. The Sunset Strip is known for its boutiques, restaurants, rock clubs, and nightclubs, as well as its array of huge, colorful billboards.

==History==

Prior to the 1984 incorporation of the city of West Hollywood, the Sunset Strip lay in an unincorporated area of Los Angeles County. Because of this, the Sunset Strip and all of West Hollywood gained a reputation for being a loosely regulated area, in large part because it was not under the jurisdiction of the Los Angeles Police Department.

=== 1920s ===
Gambling was illegal in the city of Los Angeles, but legal in unincorporated Los Angeles County, which fostered the development of rather wilder nightlife in West Hollywood than was found within the city limits. In the 1920s a number of nightclubs and casinos moved in along Sunset Strip, which attracted movie people; alcohol was served in back rooms during Prohibition.&lt;ref name=&quot;roadandtrack/a39529791&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1930s and 1940s ===
In the 1930s and the 1940s, restaurants and nightclubs on Sunset Strip, like Sherry&#x27;s, Ciro&#x27;s, the Mocambo and the Trocadero, were patronized by people working in the movie industry. Some of its expensive nightclubs and restaurants were said to be owned by gangsters like Mickey Cohen and Bugsy Siegel, earning Sunset Strip a place in Raymond Chandler&#x27;s 1949 Philip Marlowe novel, &quot;The Little Sister&quot;. Also on Sunset Strip are the Garden of Allah apartments—Hollywood quarters for transplanted writers like Robert Benchley, Dorothy Parker, and F. Scott Fitzgerald—and Schwab&#x27;s Drug Store.

=== 1960s ===

By the early 1960s, Sunset Strip had lost favor with the majority of movie people, but its restaurants, bars and clubs continued to serve as an attraction for locals and tourists. In the mid-1960s it became a major gathering place for the counterculture and was the scene of the Sunset Strip curfew riots in November 1966, involving police and crowds of young club-goers. Those riots inspired the Buffalo Springfield song &quot;For What It&#x27;s Worth&quot;.

Sunset Strip became popular with rock musicians and their fans. Bands such as Led Zeppelin, the Doors, the Byrds, Love, the Seeds, Frank Zappa, and others played at clubs like Gazzarri&#x27;s, the Whisky a Go Go, the Roxy, Pandora&#x27;s Box and the London Fog. In July 1965 Go-Go dancers also began performing. The Hyatt West Hollywood (now known as the Andaz West Hollywood) became a popular hotel.

=== 1970s ===

Rodney Bingenheimer&#x27;s English Disco, influenced by Britain&#x27;s glam rock movement, opened in 1972. It became a hangout for musicians, including the Stooges and the New York Dolls. Clubs on the Sunset Strip at that time, Rodney Bingenheimer&#x27;s in particular, were notorious for allowing teenage patrons. &quot;Nobody carried or cared about ID&#x27;s. Thirteen-year-old girls could walk in dressed like sexy 25-year-olds, and kids could sidle up to the bar and order a cocktail, so it wasn&#x27;t a big stretch for us to get up and play there&quot;, recalled Quiet Riot founder Kelly Garni. The 1979 Donna Summer song &quot;Sunset People&quot;, from the album &quot;Bad Girls&quot;, was about the nightlife on Sunset Boulevard. Sunset Strip continued to be a major focus for punk rock and new wave music during the late 1970s.

=== 1980s ===

During the latter part of the 1970s and well into the 1980s, the Sunset Strip would become synonymous with the Los Angeles heavy metal movement, commonly referred to as the West Coast Metal Explosion. The clubs on the Sunset Strip such as the Whisky a Go Go and The Roxy, became home to numerous LA-based heavy metal bands such as Van Halen, Quiet Riot, Mötley Crüe, Ratt and Guns N&#x27; Roses. The scene became synonymous with glam metal, with many fans mimicking the hair and clothing worn by the bands. The many heavy metal fans who would congregate outside the clubs along the strip became a defining feature.

The adoption of &quot;pay to play&quot; policies, in which bands were charged a fee to play at clubs, diminished its appeal to groups, other than as an industry showcase. As of the 2010s, the music industry establishment continues to dominate the clubs on Sunset Strip.

In November 1984, voters in West Hollywood passed a proposal on the ballot to incorporate, and the area became an independent city. Increasingly, the western end of Sunset Strip was occupied by office buildings, mostly catering to the entertainment industry, as well as hotels.

=== 1990s ===
During the 1990s, the center of the alternative music activity in Los Angeles shifted further east to areas like Echo Park, Silver Lake and Los Feliz.

==Landmarks==
==In popular culture==
&quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot;, a 1958–1964 TV series, was set on Sunset Strip between La Cienega Boulevard and Alta Loma Road.

&quot;Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip&quot; was a behind-the-scenes television drama of a late-night comedy sketch show performed at a fictional theater on Sunset Strip.

Premiering on January 27, 2006, in Los Angeles at Vanguard Hollywood, the &quot;Rock of Ages&quot; stage production inspired the 2012 film of the same name. Its story line is centered along Sunset Strip in 1987.

The opening credits of the HBO TV series &quot;Entourage&quot; featured shots of Sunset Strip.

Los Angeles-based artist Edward Ruscha created the artist&#x27;s book &quot;Every Building on the Sunset Strip&quot; in 1966, later &quot;12 Sunsets&quot; website for the Getty Research Institute.&lt;ref name=&quot;washingtonpost/ruscha-sunset-strip&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Ian Astbury was born in Heswall, Cheshire, and is of Scottish and English descent. He moved with his family to Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, from England in 1973 when he was 11. He attended Glendale Secondary School. Astbury&#x27;s early musical influences took root in Hamilton, where he became a fan of David Bowie, Iggy Pop and New York Dolls. He did not start performing until after his return to the UK.

In 1979, while living in Glasgow, Astbury was influenced by the Doors&#x27; song &quot;The End&quot;, which he heard while watching the film &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;, later describing this as &quot;a religious experience&quot;.

==Career==
===Early career===
In 1980, Astbury was in Liverpool, where he was active on the punk scene based around Eric&#x27;s Club. He moved to Bradford in late 1980, and by 1981 he helped found the post-punk band Southern Death Cult, which lasted until March 1983. Along with guitarist Billy Duffy, bassist Jamie Stewart and drummer Raymond Taylor Smith, Astbury formed a new band, Death Cult, and released the &quot;Death Cult&quot; extended play (EP). To help broaden their appeal, the band changed its name to &quot;the Cult&quot; in January 1984 before appearing on the Channel 4 television show, &quot;The Tube&quot;.

The Cult&#x27;s debut studio album, &quot;Dreamtime&quot;, was released in 1984, followed by &quot;Love&quot; in 1985. &quot;Love&quot; featured the single &quot;She Sells Sanctuary&quot;, which introduced the band to an international audience. Many songs of these early albums focus on Native American themes, a particular interest of Astbury&#x27;s. On their third studio album, &quot;Electric&quot; (1987), the Cult made a transformation to a hard rock sound with the help of producer Rick Rubin.

After the release of the 1989 studio album &quot;Sonic Temple&quot; and the single &quot;Fire Woman&quot;, Astbury relocated to Los Angeles, California, US.

===1990s===
In 1994, the Cult returned with an eponymous studio album and a musical change of pace. Their hard rock sound was gone, as a result of Astbury&#x27;s growing interest in alternative music, fashion and introspective lyrics. Although the album produced two singles (&quot;Coming Down&quot; and &quot;Star&quot;), it was not a commercial success. They toured to support the album, but in Brazil creative differences with guitarist Duffy reached their nadir, which resulted in him leaving the band.

Astbury soon assembled another group of musicians and began writing new songs. He called the band Holy Barbarians, and in 1996 the band released the studio album &quot;Cream,&quot; which was not a commercial success. The band appeared at the small Tunbridge Wells Forum, where Vic Reeves joined the band onstage for a rendition of &quot;Wildflower&quot;.

Personal difficulties and a drive for further introspection drove Astbury away from his new group, and he began working on a solo studio album, eventually released as &quot;Spirit/Light/Speed&quot; in 2000.

In 1999, Astbury and Duffy reformed the Cult. The band signed a new recording contract with Atlantic Records, and in 2001 &quot;Beyond Good and Evil&quot; was released. The band initially enjoyed radio success with the single &quot;Rise&quot;, until a falling out with Atlantic, which ended all commercial promotions and radio play for the album. Disillusioned by the fight with the record label, Astbury brought the Cult to another hiatus in 2002.

===2000–present===

Astbury became lead vocalist of the Doors of the 21st Century in 2002. The group featured original Doors members Robby Krieger and Ray Manzarek.

In 2003, Astbury performed with the surviving members of MC5 at the 100 Club in London.

He re-formed the Cult with Duffy in 2006, for a series of live shows. In October 2007, the Cult released &quot;Born into This&quot;, which included the single &quot;Dirty Little Rockstar&quot;. In 2009, the band embarked on a tour with shows across Canada, the US, and various countries in Europe where they performed their 1985 studio album &quot;Love&quot; in its entirety.

On 29 May 2010, the Japanese band Boris performed &quot;The End&quot; with Ian Astbury at Vivid Festival in Sydney. Boris and Astbury released a four-song EP in September 2010 on Southern Lord and Daymare Records, containing four tracks entitled &quot;Teeth and Claws,&quot; &quot;We are Witches,&quot; &quot;Rain&quot; and &quot;Magickal Child.&quot;

===Other musical ventures===
Astbury is featured on the UNKLE tracks &quot;Burn My Shadow&quot;, &quot;When Things Explode&quot; and &quot;Forever.&quot; He also sings &quot;Flame On&quot; on Black Sabbath lead guitarist Tony Iommi&#x27;s debut solo studio album &quot;Iommi&quot; (2000), and recorded a duet with Debbie Harry on her 1989 solo studio album &quot;Def, Dumb and Blonde&quot;, called &quot;Lovelight&quot;.

In 2010, he provided the vocals for the song &quot;Ghost&quot; on guitarist Slash&#x27;s self-titled solo studio album. The track also featured former Guns N&#x27; Roses guitarist Izzy Stradlin on rhythm guitar. Astbury is also credited for playing the drums on a track called &quot;Gasp&quot; by Japanese Cartoon.

==Personal life==
Astbury lives in Los Angeles. He has played on the amateur football team Hollywood United with Billy Duffy and Steve Jones of the Sex Pistols. He is a supporter of English Premier League club Everton. On 26 May 2012, Astbury married the Black Ryder singer and guitarist Aimee Nash in Las Vegas.

<doc id="313995" wikidata="Q761163" url="?curid=313995" title="Music of Laos">
<text>The music of Laos includes the music of the Lao people, a Tai ethnic group, and other ethnic groups living in Laos. The traditional music of Laos has similarities with the traditional music of Thailand and Cambodia, including the names of the instruments and influences and developments. To categorize Lao music, it seems helpful to distinguish between the nonclassical folk traditions (which are presented through the ensembles and instruments used within), the classical music traditions and its basic ensembles, and vocal traditions.

The most popular form of music in Laos is the indigenous mor lam.

== Classical music ==
The Lao term ເພງລາວເດີມ &quot;peng Lao deum&quot; (traditional Lao songs) describes the Royal Court music of Laos. Historical records indicate that an indigenous classical tradition existed, which was mainly influenced by ancient Khmer traditions and mountainous ethnic groups. King Fa Ngum was raised and educated in Angkor Wat, so the Khmer traditions were the first center for the court music, which evolved and changed as the Lao kingdom grew and prospered in the golden age.

Today, the court music has mostly vanished. It was considered as &quot;elitist, bourgeoisie&quot; and forbidden by the communist government, and the last performers in Tennessee, USA tried to rebuild the court music in diaspora but failed due to a lack of members. The classical ensemble and its instruments still get used in many Lao traditions today, are only used for the &quot;lam&quot; traditions and the only &quot;theater&quot; like traditions &quot;li-ke&quot; (or &quot;lam poem&quot;, from 1940) which immigrated from northern Siam, gets performed with acting, storytelling in &quot;lam&quot; singing styles and a Khene mouth organ, thus remaining the only theater tradition in Laos today.

== Mor lam ==
Laotian mor lam (also spelled maw lam), though usually called simply lam in Laos () is considered purer and more traditional than the forms found in Thailand. It often features the &quot;khaen &quot;() (bamboo and reed mouth organ) and jousting pairs of singers, backed by colorful troupes, who improvise stories and courting duels. The material is often topical, colloquial, sexual and bawdy and is tolerated by the government even when sometimes it is the object of some of the jokes.
Ensembles typically include two singers (&quot;mor lam&quot;, the same term referring to the genre of music)— one male and one female—, a khene player (&quot;mor khaen&quot;), and other instruments including fiddles, flutes and bells. Music varies widely across Laos, with the lam saravane style being most popular, while the city of Luang Prabang is known for a slow form called khaplam wai. An extremely popular form of Lao lam that developed in Thailand is called mor lam sing, and is faster and electrified.

== Regional music of Laos ==

Each of these traditions is influenced by regional playing styles, which can be separated in three different areas: Luang Prabang in the north, Vientiane in the center, and Champassak in the south.

=== Luang Prabang ===
In Luang Prabang, classical Lao court music developed to high estate and vanished. Unfortunately, most of the instruments are collecting dust in the royal museum, but showpieces like bronze drums of the Dong Son age show the influence of ethnic minorities which were often from the mountainous areas.

=== Vientiane ===
In Vientiane the governmental school &quot;Natasin&quot; which was closed 1975 was reopened 1990 and educates and provides some ensembles for festivals, marriages and other purposes.

=== Champasak ===
The southern region of Champassak is not only influenced by Khmer traditions, but is typically a mixture of Khmer, Thai and indigenous Lao traditions.

== Popular music ==

In the 1960s, lam nu and lam ploen contributed to the development of lam luang, which is a form of song (and dance) which often has narrative lyrics.

== Instruments ==
* The most distinctive Lao musical instrument is a bamboo mouth organ called a khene. The instrument was supposedly invented by a woman trying to imitate the calls of the garawek bird. The woman took the new instrument to her king, and he told her it was fair, but that he wanted more. She modified the instrument and he replied &quot;Tia nee khaen dee&quot; (&quot;this time it was better&quot;).

<text>Ouro Preto (, ), formerly Vila Rica (, ), is a municipality in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. The city, a former colonial mining town located in the Serra do Espinhaço mountains, was designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO due to its Baroque colonial architecture. Ouro Preto used to be the capital of Minas Gerais from 1720 until the foundation of Belo Horizonte in 1897.

The municipality became one of the most populous cities of Latin America, counting on about 40,000 people in 1730, and 80,000 in 1750. At that time, the population of New York was less than half of that number of inhabitants and the population of São Paulo did not surpass 8,000. Officially, 800 tons of gold were sent to Portugal in the eighteenth century, not to mention what was circulated in an illegal manner, nor what remained in the colony, such as gold used in the ornamentation of the churches.

Other historical cities in Minas Gerais are São João del-Rei, Diamantina, Mariana, Tiradentes, Congonhas and Sabará.

==History==
Founded at the end of the 17th century, Ouro Preto (meaning &quot;Black Gold&quot;) was originally called Vila Rica, or &quot;Rich Village&quot;, the focal point of the gold rush and Brazil&#x27;s golden age in the 18th century under Portuguese rule. Between 1695 and 1696, a gold-bearing stream was discovered in Itacolomi, which would be renamed Gualacho do Sul. In 1711, several small settlements were united as a municipality called Villa Rica, which later came to be called Ouro Preto. This name was adopted on 20 May 1823, when the former Vila Rica was elevated from village to city. The name &quot;Black Gold&quot; comes from the gold covered with a layer of iron oxide that is found in the city.

The city centre contains well-preserved Portuguese colonial architecture, with few signs of modern urban development. New construction must keep with the city&#x27;s historical aesthetic. 18th- and 19th-century churches decorated with gold and the sculptured works of Aleijadinho make Ouro Preto a tourist destination.

The tremendous wealth from gold mining in the 18th century created a city which attracted the intelligentsia of Europe. Philosophy and art flourished, and evidence of a baroque revival called the &quot;Barroco Mineiro&quot; is illustrated in architecture as well as by sculptors such as Aleijadinho, painters such as Manoel da Costa Ataíde, composers such as Lobo de Mesquita, and poets such as Tomás António Gonzaga. At that time, Vila Rica was the largest city in Brazil, with 100,000 inhabitants.

In 1789, Ouro Preto became the birthplace of the Inconfidência Mineira, a failed attempt to gain independence from Portugal. The leading figure, Joaquim José da Silva Xavier, known as Tiradentes, was hanged as a threat to any future revolutionaries.

In 1876, the Escola de Minas (Mines School) was created. This school established the technological foundation for several of the mineral discoveries in Brazil.

Ouro Preto was the capital of Minas Gerais from 1720 until 1897, when the needs of government outgrew this town in the valley. The state government was moved to the new, planned city of Belo Horizonte.

===Climate===
Located at above sea level, Ouro Preto has a subtropical highland climate (&quot;Cwb&quot;, according to the Köppen climate classification), with warm and humid summers and mild, dry winters. Frost is occasional and occur in June and July. There is a report of snow in the city in the year of 1843.

==Economy==
Although Ouro Preto now relies heavily on the tourism industry for part of its economy, there are important metallurgic and mining industries located in town, such as Novelis, formerly Alcan, the most important aluminum factory in the country, Vale S.A., and others. Main economic activities are tourism, transformation industries, and mineral riches such as deposits of iron, bauxite, manganese, talc and marble.

Minerals of note in the city are: gold, hematite, dolomite, tourmaline, pyrite, muscovite, topaz and imperial topaz, which is a stone only found in Ouro Preto.

Soapstone handicraft items are a common souvenir among tourists, and can be found in many shops in the city&#x27;s town centre and street fairs. Jewelry made of local precious and semi-precious gemstones (such as hematite) can also be found for sale.

==The University and the fraternities==
Ouro Preto is also a university town with an intense student life. The Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto (Federal University of Ouro Preto or UFOP) has approximately 10,000 students in the city. Many of them live in communal houses that are somewhat similar to fraternity houses as found in North American colleges. These communal or shared houses are called &quot;repúblicas&quot;, 66 of which are owned by the university, called &quot;repúblicas federais&quot;, and 250 are privately owned (&quot;repúblicas particulares&quot;).

The &quot;repúblicas&quot; system of Ouro Preto is unique in Brazil. No other university city in the country has exactly the same characteristics of the student lodgings found there. It shares traits with the &quot;repúblicas&quot; of the Portuguese University of Coimbra, where the tradition originated. Before universities were founded in Brazil, Coimbra was where most of the rich students who could afford an overseas education went to. Each &quot;república&quot; has its own different history. There are &quot;repúblicas&quot; in which the freshmen, also known as &quot;bixos&quot; (misspelling of &quot;bichos&quot;, Portuguese for &quot;animals&quot;), have to undergo a hazing period, called &quot;batalha&quot; (battle), before being accepted permanently as residents of the houses. The final choice of the freshmen, called &quot;escolha&quot;, has to be unanimous among the senior students of the house.

The Museu Mineralógico da Escola de Minas (Mineralogy Museum) can be of special interest to visitors. It belongs to the UFOP&#x27;s School of Mining, which opened its doors on 12 October 1876. The museum is located at the Tiradentes Square No. 20, in the town&#x27;s historical center, and contains a rich assortment of minerals on display, including precious and semi-precious gemstones and large crystals. Security is tight, however (for example, no cameras are allowed), due to the incalculable value of the gemstones and ores on display.

==Tourist attractions==

Ouro Preto is a major tourist destination, for its well-preserved colonial appearance with baroque architecture and cobblestone streets.

===Churches===

The city contains numerous churches, many known for their religious art and baroque architecture. Some of the best known are:

* Nossa Senhora do Carmo (Our Lady of Mount Carmel) - just off Tiradentes Square, next to the Inconfidência Museum.
* São Francisco de Assis (St. Francis of Assisi)
* Nossa Senhora da Conceiçao (Immaculate Conception)
* Capela do Padre Faria (Father Faria&#x27;s Chapel)
* Nossa Senhora das Mercês (Our Lady of Mercy)
* Nossa Senhora do Pilar (Our Lady of the Pillar)
* Nossa Senhora do Rosário (Our Lady of the Rosary)

===Museums===
* Museu da Inconfidência - In the former municipal palace on Tiradentes Plaza, traces the Inconfidencia independence movement.
* Museu do Oratório (Oratory Museum) - next to the church of Nossa Senhora do Carmo, displays religious art.
* Museu de Ciência e Técnica (Museum of Science and Technology) - in the Ouro Preto School of Mines building on Tiradentes Plaza. The museum is noted for its collection of mineral specimens.
* Casa Dos Contos - Historical museum.
*Capela Padre Fabio de Mello
*Museu do Aleijadinho - In the Antônio Dias plaza, historical museum known for the collection of pieces of Aleijadinho.

===Mines===
A number of former gold mines in the city offer tours to tourists. One of the most well known is the Mina do Chico Rei, near the sanctuary of Nossa Senhora da Conceição. Another infamous mine is the Mina da passagem. In the early 19th century, Portugal gave the United Kingdom exclusive use of this mine for 100 years to pay Portugal&#x27;s sovereign debts. This is the world&#x27;s largest mine open to the public. The municipality contains about 10% of the Serra do Gandarela National Park, created in 2014.

===Carnival===
The street carnival in Ouro Preto attracts thousands of people every year. Carnival blocks are the most traditional type of parade, where bands play across the town, followed by herds of paraders dressed up in costumes. The block Zé Pereira dos Lacaios, founded in 1867, is the oldest block that is still active in Brazil. Parades with samba schools also happen.

The street party is also celebrated in neighbouring towns such as Mariana.

==Miscellaneous==
Ouro Preto was a setting in the comedy movie &quot;Moon over Parador&quot; (1988), with actors Richard Dreyfuss and Sonia Braga.

Mining is Brazil&#x27;s sixth largest industry.

<text>Gisèle MacKenzie (born Gisèle Marie Louise Marguerite LaFlèche; January 10, 1927 – September 5, 2003) was a Canadian-American singer, actress, and commercial spokesperson, best known for her performances on the US television program &quot;Your Hit Parade&quot;.

==Biography==

She was born Gisèle Marie Louise Marguerite LaFlèche in Winnipeg, Manitoba in 1927. The daughter of a Winnipeg doctor, MacKenzie spent her childhood in Manitoba where she studied violin and attended the Sacred Heart School as a child. As a teenager she studied violin and voice at The Royal Conservatory of Music in Toronto, Ontario. She had at least two Canadian Broadcasting Corporation radio programs, &quot;Meet Gisèle&quot;, where she played hostess to Jack Benny, Clark Gable, Loretta Young, Fred Astaire, and James Stewart; and &quot;Gisele and Mr. Cable&quot;.

She took on the stage name MacKenzie and moved to Los Angeles, California in 1951 to replace The Andrews Sisters on CBS Radio&#x27;s daily program, &quot;Club Fifteen&quot;, starring Bob Crosby, where she alternated as regular vocalist with Jo Stafford. She became a naturalized US citizen in 1955.

MacKenzie recorded albums and singles on various record labels, most notably Capitol and RCA, Everest, Mercury, Liberty Sunset, and Cricket Playhour (Pickwick). In 1953 she reached No. 6 in the UK Singles Chart, with her rendition of &quot;Seven Lonely Days&quot;.

Her biggest selling song was &quot;Hard To Get&quot; in 1955. She was also an accomplished classical violinist, studying at The Royal Conservatory of Music; she performed many comedic musical duets with mentor Jack Benny. In an often-played clip, she and Benny perform a violin duet of &quot;Getting to Know You&quot;, in which she breaks their synchronization several times to add some extra musical flourishes, to his mock irritation. Finally, he breaks in with a lengthy (and stereotypically mediocre) flourish of his own, and evokes audience laughter with mock indignation: &quot;Fool around with ME, sister!&quot;

She was a guest on such shows as &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot;; &quot;The Dinah Shore Chevy Show&quot;; &quot;The Ford Show, Starring Tennessee Ernie Ford&quot;; &quot;The Pat Boone Chevy Showroom&quot;; &quot;The Bell Telephone Hour&quot;; &quot;The Colgate Comedy Hour&quot;; &quot;The Eddie Fisher Show&quot;; &quot;The George Gobel Show&quot;; and &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;. She acted in &quot;Justice&quot;. She appeared frequently in Las Vegas venues and in numerous North American concerts. She did a European tour with Benny. 

In the United States, she replaced the Andrews Sisters as a regular vocalist on &quot;Club 15&quot; and her guest appearance on Mario Lanza&#x27;s &quot;Coke Time&quot; resulted in Lanza inviting her to join his show&#x27;s cast every week. She also hosted a radio show entitled &quot;Airtime&quot; at the same time she was appearing on TV&#x27;s &quot;Your Hit Parade&quot;. 

In 1952–53, she toured with Jack Benny, who recommended her for &quot;Your Hit Parade&quot;. During her 4-year tenure on that show, &quot;Hard to Get&quot; became a hit. She announced in 1957 that she would not be returning to the show for another season. She went on to star in her own short lived Saturday night NBC variety program, &quot;The Gisele MacKenzie Show&quot;, and hosted such guests as Benny, Boris Karloff, Ronald Reagan, Bobby Diamond, and folk singer Jimmie Rodgers; it was cancelled after twentysix weeks. She returned to television in 1963 as Sid Caesar&#x27;s 4th television wife on &quot;The Sid Caesar Show&quot;, in which she did comedy with Caesar and sang a song each week. 1959 saw the release of her first of a series of children&#x27;s albums, &quot;Gisele MacKenzie sings Lullaby and Goodnight&quot;. The album sold very well and resulted in two more for Cricket Play Hour Records (Pickwick).

Starting in 1955, during her summer breaks from &quot;Your Hit Parade&quot;, she added musical comedies to her resume musical theater by starring in such classics as &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot;, &quot;The King and I&quot;, and &quot;South Pacific&quot;. 

In 1957 she appeared in the TV drama &quot;Love at Fourth Sight&quot;.

In 1986, she appeared in several episodes as a temporary recast in the role of Katherine Chancellor on &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;. She expanded her acting credits in the 1990s, making guest appearances on television series including &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, &quot;Boy Meets World&quot;, and &quot;MacGyver&quot;.

MacKenzie has a star on the Hollywood Walk Of Fame at 1601 Vine.

==Personal life==
MacKenzie was married to her personal manager, Robert J. Shuttleworth (February 24, 1958 – August 12, 1966) and to Robert F. Klein (May 10, 1975–????); both marriages ended in divorce. She had a son, MacKenzie Duffy, and a daughter, contemporary jazz artist Gigi MacKenzie.

==Death==
MacKenzie died from colon cancer, aged 76, on September 5, 2003, in Burbank, California.

<doc id="314006" wikidata="Q2295828" url="?curid=314006" title="Yoknapatawpha County">
<text>Yoknapatawpha County () is a fictional Mississippi county created by the American author William Faulkner, largely based on and inspired by Lafayette County, Mississippi, and its county seat of Oxford (which Faulkner renamed &quot;Jefferson&quot;). Faulkner often referred to Yoknapatawpha County as &quot;my apocryphal county&quot;.

==Overview==
From &quot;Sartoris&quot; (1929) onwards, Faulkner set all but three of his novels in the county, as well as over 50 of his stories (the three later novels which were set elsewhere were &quot;Pylon&quot;, &quot;The Wild Palms&quot;, and &quot;A Fable&quot;). &quot;Absalom, Absalom!&quot; includes a map of Yoknapatawpha County drawn by Faulkner.

The word &quot;Yoknapatawpha&quot; is derived from two Chickasaw words—&quot;Yocona&quot; and &quot;petopha&quot;, meaning &quot;split land.&quot; Faulkner said to a University of Virginia audience that the compound means &quot;water flows slow through flat land.&quot; &quot;Yoknapatawpha&quot; was the original name for the actual Yocona River, a tributary of the Tallahatchie which runs through the southern part of Lafayette County. The first mention of the county, in &quot;Flags in the Dust&quot; (originally published as &quot;Sartoris&quot;), refers to it as &quot;Yocona County.&quot; 

The area was originally Chickasaw land. European settlement started around the year 1800. Prior to the American Civil War, the county consisted of several large plantations. By family surname, they were: Grenier in the southeast, McCaslin in the northeast, Sutpen in the northwest, and Compson and Sartoris in the immediate vicinity of Jefferson. Later, the county became mostly small farms. By 1936, the population was 15,611, of which 6,298 were white and 9,313 were black.

Richard Reed has presented a detailed chronological analysis of Yoknapatawpha County. Charles S. Aiken has examined Faulkner&#x27;s incorporation of real-life historical and geographical details into the overall presentation of the county. Aiken has further discussed the parallels of Yoknapatawpha County with the real-life Lafayette County, and also the representation of the &quot;Upland South&quot; and the &quot;Lowland South&quot; in Yoknapatawpha.

Faulkner&#x27;s imaginary county has inspired at least one other Mississippi author to follow his lead: Jesmyn Ward, who is the only woman to win the National Book Award twice for fiction. She drew upon Faulkner for Bois Sauvage, where she placed her three novels.

<doc id="314008" wikidata="Q6687294" url="?curid=314008" title="Louis Grenier">
<text>Louis Grenier is a fictional character in William Faulkner&#x27;s novels and stories.

Grenier (died 1837), a French Huguenot architect and dilettante came, around 1800, with Dr. Samuel Habersham and Alexander Holston to the settlement which would later become Jefferson. Grenier was a student at the Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf. He bought land in the southeastern part of Yoknapatawpha County and established the first cotton plantation and had the first slaves in that part of the state. His slaves straightened a nearly ten-mile stretch of the Yoknapatawpha River to prevent flooding, according to &quot;The Hamlet&quot;. His house later became known as the Old Frenchman&#x27;s Place, and the small settlement as Frenchman&#x27;s Bend. 

His last living descendant was known as &quot;Lonnie Grinnup&quot;, a feeble-minded man in his middle thirties sometime around the first quarter of the twentieth century, although his real name was the same as that of his first Yoknapatawpha County ancestor.

Louis Grenier appears in &quot;Requiem for a Nun&quot; and is referred to in &quot;Intruder in the Dust&quot;, &quot;Hand Upon the Waters&quot;, &quot;The Town&quot;, and &quot;The Reivers&quot;. In addition, a character named &quot;Grenier Weddel&quot; appears in &quot;The Town&quot;.

<text>Andorians are a fictional race of humanoid extraterrestrials in the American science fiction franchise &quot;Star Trek&quot;. They were created by writer D. C. Fontana. Within the &quot;Star Trek&quot; narrative, they are native to the blue icy Class M moon, Andoria (sometimes referred to as Andor). Distinctive traits of Andorians include their blue/green skin, a pair of cranial antennae, and white hair.

Andorians first appeared in the 1967 &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot; episode &quot;Journey to Babel&quot;, and have been seen or mentioned in episodes of subsequent series in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise. They were indicated to be a vital, important member of the United Federation of Planets in the 1997 &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; episode &quot;In the Cards&quot;, but did not gain considerable exposure until the 2001–2005 series &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot;, on which they were used as recurring characters, most notably in the person of Thy&#x27;lek Shran, a starship commander who maintained a sometimes adversarial and begrudging friendship with &quot;Enterprise&quot; Captain Jonathan Archer. The series revealed more about Andorian ships, the home world Andoria, and the culture and history of Andorians and their subspecies, the Aenar. The 2004 episode &quot;Zero Hour&quot; established that Andorians were one of the four founding members of the United Federation of Planets.

== Development ==
Andorians appeared in four episodes of The Original Series, and were background elements in &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; and &quot;Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home&quot;, but remained largely undeveloped until &quot;Enterprise&quot;. Showrunner Brannon Braga originally wanted to limit the number of original series elements on &quot;Enterprise&quot;, but came to see the challenge of &quot;tak(ing) the goofiest aliens from The Original Series and make them a real culture that’s cool and believable.&quot;

== Appearance ==

Andorians have blue blood, blue skin, white hair, and antennae on the crown of the skull. By the time of the 2001 – 2005 TV series &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot;, the antennae were depicted as protruding from the forehead, and capable of movement, used for gesturing and balancing. The design of Andorians has changed with every new production; including the placement of their antennae, additional makeup appliances, and the blue shade of their skin.

== Homeworld ==
Andoria (sometimes referred to as Andor), is an icy moon orbiting a ringed gas giant. In a DVD bonus feature for the 4th season of &quot;Enterprise&quot;, episode writers Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens stated that Andor was the gas giant, Andoria the moon, and that this was a conscious effort to address the discrepancy, but continued varying usage across canon, reference, and licensed sources have not fully resolved the discrepancy.

Most of Andoria&#x27;s cities are built underground to take advantage of geothermal warmth. Temperatures have been known to reach −28 °C in the summer. Andoria has at least one moon or neighboring planet. Andorians share their homeworld with an obscure telepathic subspecies, Aenar, which have either light blue or white skin.

The non-canonical &quot;Star Trek Star Charts&quot; (2002) cites Andoria as the seventh planet in orbit around the star Procyon (Alpha Canis Minoris) in the Beta quadrant, but previous material has Andoria as the eighth planet of the orange dwarf Epsilon Indi in the Alpha quadrant. Andoria is near Betazed, Earth, Tellar, and Vulcan.

== Reception ==
In 2017, &quot;Den of Geek&quot; ranked the Andorians the 9th best aliens of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise.

<text>Steamboat Geyser, in Yellowstone National Park&#x27;s Norris Geyser Basin, is the world&#x27;s tallest active geyser. Steamboat Geyser has two vents, northern and southern, approximately apart. The north vent is responsible for the tallest water columns; the south vent&#x27;s water columns are shorter.

Prior to 1904, Waimangu Geyser, in New Zealand, had some taller eruptions capable of reaching , but in 1904, a landslide changed the local water table, and since then, Waimangu has not erupted. Excelsior Geyser in Yellowstone&#x27;s Midway Geyser Basin, and Semi-Centennial Geyser just north of Roaring Mountain on the Grand Loop Road were reported to be as tall as Steamboat, both with eruptions reaching . However, Excelsior has not erupted since 1985, and functions as a hot spring, and Semi-Centennial&#x27;s one eruption of this height was reported in 1922 and it has been dormant since.

Steamboat&#x27;s major eruptions generally last from 3 to 40 minutes (several durations surpassing an hour were observed during the 2018 active phase), and are followed by powerful jets of steam. During these eruptions, water may be thrown more than into the air. Steamboat does not erupt on a predictable schedule, with recorded intervals between major eruptions ranging from three days to fifty years. The geyser was dormant from 1911 to 1961. In 1964, twenty-nine eruptions were reported, setting a record for the most eruptions within a calendar year. In 2018, the geyser began a prolonged period of frequent activity lasting through at least 2022, with more than 40 eruptions recorded annually in both 2019 and 2020.

Minor eruptions of are much more frequent.

After an eruption, the geyser often vents large amounts of steam for up to 48 hours. Sometimes during this part of an eruption, water may return to Steamboat, causing it to jet water once again, though to lesser heights. Cistern Spring, located nearby, will drain completely following a major eruption of the geyser; the spring refills within a few days.

== Recent eruptions and active phase of 2018–2024 ==
The most recent eruption of Steamboat Geyser occurred on October 7, 2024. This was the 168th eruption since it re-activated in early 2018.

In 2019 the 48th eruption occurred on December 26. That set a new record for the most eruptions within a calendar year. The calendar year 2020 also saw 48 eruptions, tying the record set in 2019.

<text>A dark horse is a previously lesser-known person, team or thing that emerges to prominence in a situation, especially in a competition involving multiple rivals, that is unlikely to succeed but has a fighting chance, unlike the underdog who is expected to lose.

The term comes from horse racing and horse betting jargon for any new but promising horse. It has since found usage mostly in other sports, sports betting, and sports journalism and to lesser extent in nascent business environments, such as experimental technology and startup companies.

==Origin==
The term began as horse racing parlance for a race horse that is unknown to gamblers and thus difficult to establish betting odds for.

The first known mention of the concept is in Benjamin Disraeli&#x27;s novel &quot;The Young Duke&quot; (1831). Disraeli&#x27;s protagonist, the Duke of St. James, attends a horse race with a surprise finish: &quot;A dark horse which had never been thought of, and which the careless St. James had never even observed in the list, rushed past the grandstand in sweeping triumph.&quot;

==Politics==

The concept has been used in political contexts in such countries as Iran, Philippines, Russia, Egypt, Finland, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

Politically, the concept came to the United States in the nineteenth century when it was first applied to James K. Polk, a relatively unknown Tennessee politician who won the Democratic Party&#x27;s 1844 presidential nomination over a host of better-known candidates. Polk won the nomination on the ninth ballot at his party&#x27;s national nominating convention, and went on to become the country&#x27;s eleventh president.

Other successful dark horse candidates for the United States presidency include:
* Franklin Pierce, chosen as the Democratic nominee and later elected the fourteenth president in 1852.
* Abraham Lincoln, chosen as the Republican nominee and elected as the sixteenth president in 1860.
* Rutherford B. Hayes, elected the nineteenth president in 1876.
* James A. Garfield, elected the twentieth president in 1880; in the beginning of that same year, Garfield was a rising star in the Republican party but had no interest in the presidency and endorsed Secretary of the Treasury John Sherman. However, his party&#x27;s national nominating convention became deadlocked due to a split in the delegates between former Republican president Ulysses S. Grant, Senator James G. Blaine, and Sherman. The party sought a compromise candidate, and they opted to select Garfield over the latter&#x27;s own objections. Garfield, however, would be assassinated just six months into his term.
* Warren G. Harding, Senator from Ohio, elected the twenty-ninth president in 1920 after his surprise nomination.
*Harry S. Truman, Vice-President and former Senator from Missouri and thirty-third president, was virtually unknown to the American people when he succeeded President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1945. Truman was considered a lame duck President with no chance of winning against the immensely popular Republican nominee and New York Governor Thomas E. Dewey, yet managed to shock the world by emerging victorious in the 1948 United States presidential election – widely considered one of the biggest upsets in American history.
* Jimmy Carter, former Governor of Georgia elected the thirty-ninth president in 1976; in the beginning of that same year, Carter was relatively unknown outside his home state of Georgia but went on to win the nomination over rivals with more national prominence. At the 1976 Democratic National Convention Carter made a joke of his obscurity beginning his speech saying &quot;My name is Jimmy Carter, and I&#x27;m running for President.&quot; 
Perhaps the two most famous unsuccessful dark horse presidential candidates in American history are Democrat William Jennings Bryan, a three-term congressman from Nebraska nominated on the fifth ballot after impressing the 1896 Democratic National Convention with his famous Cross of Gold speech (Bryan would go on to receive the Democratic presidential nomination twice more and serve as United States Secretary of State), and Republican businessman Wendell Willkie, who was nominated on the sixth ballot at the 1940 Republican National Convention despite never having previously held government office and having only joined the party in 1939. 

In Peru, &quot;dark horse&quot; candidates who won include Alberto Fujimori, who defeated Mario Vargas Llosa in the 1990 election, and Pedro Castillo, a previously unknown elementary school teacher, who won the 2021 election. In the United Kingdom, Jeremy Corbyn was considered a &quot;dark horse&quot; candidate when he ran for the 2015 Labour Party leadership election; despite struggling to secure enough nominations from the Parliamentary Labour Party to stand as a candidate, he won the leadership in a landslide. In Venezuela, then-President of the National Assembly Juan Guaidó was described as &quot;the accidental leader&quot; of the Venezuelan opposition; he declared himself acting president in 2019, during the Venezuelan presidential crisis. In Turkey, Ekrem İmamoğlu was little-known before his victory in the 2019 Istanbul mayoral election. In Iran, Masoud Pezeshkian, a little-known &quot;dark horse&quot; candidate, was allowed to run by the Guardian Council and won a surprising victory in the second round of the 2024 Iranian presidential election.

==Use in sport==
The term has been used in sport to describe teams and athletes who unexpectedly outperformed their expectations in a competition. Examples include the Los Angeles Kings during the 2012 Stanley Cup playoffs (who placed 1st despite being an 8th-seed entry into the playoffs); Bulgaria at the 1994 FIFA World Cup; Croatia at the 1998 FIFA World Cup and 2018 FIFA World Cup (who placed 2nd despite being ranked 20th in the FIFA World Rankings); and Morocco at the 2022 FIFA World Cup (who placed 4th despite being ranked 23rd in the FIFA World Rankings).

<doc id="314026" wikidata="Q229881" url="?curid=314026" title="Grace Slick">
<text>Grace Slick (born Grace Barnett Wing; October 30, 1939) is an American painter and retired musician whose musical career spanned four decades. She was a prominent figure in San Francisco&#x27;s psychedelic music scene during the mid-1960s to the early 1970s.

Initially performing with the Great Society, Slick achieved fame as the lead singer and frontwoman of Jefferson Airplane and the subsequent spinoff bands Jefferson Starship and Starship. Slick and Jefferson Airplane achieved significant success and popularity with their 1967 studio album &quot;Surrealistic Pillow&quot;, which included the top-ten US &quot;Billboard&quot; hits &quot;White Rabbit&quot; and &quot;Somebody to Love&quot;.

With Starship, she sang co-lead for two number-one hits, &quot;We Built This City&quot; and &quot;Nothing&#x27;s Gonna Stop Us Now&quot;. She has released four studio albums as an independent artist. Slick retired from music in 1990, but continues to be active in visual arts. In 1996, Slick was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Jefferson Airplane.

==Early life and education==
Grace Barnett Wing was born October 30, 1939, in Highland Park, Illinois, a Chicago suburb, to Ivan Wilford Wing (1907–1987), of British descent, and Virginia Wing (née Barnett; 1909–1983). Her parents met while they were both students at the University of Washington in Seattle, and later married. In 1949, her younger brother Chris was born.

Her father worked in the investment banking sector for Weeden and Company, and the family relocated several times when she was a child. She lived in the Chicago metropolitan area, Los Angeles and San Francisco before her family settled in Palo Alto, California in the early 1950s. Wing attended Palo Alto Senior High School, then transferred to Castilleja School, a private all-girls school in Palo Alto.

Following graduation, she attended Finch College in New York City from 1957 to 1958, and the University of Miami in Coral Gables, Florida, from 1958 to 1959.

==Career==
Slick worked as a model at an I. Magnin department store for three years. She also started composing music, including a contribution to a short film by her husband, Jerry Slick.

===1965–1966: The Great Society===
In August 1965, Slick read an article in the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; about the newly formed Jefferson Airplane. Despite being situated in the growing musical center of San Francisco, Slick only half-heartedly considered music for a profession until she watched the band live at The Matrix. As a result, Slick (vocals, guitar), accompanied by husband Jerry Slick (drums), Jerry&#x27;s brother Darby Slick (lead guitar), and David Miner (bass guitar) formed a group called the Great Society. On October 15, 1965, the band made its debut performance at a venue known as the Coffee Gallery. Soon after, Slick composed the psychedelic piece &quot;White Rabbit&quot;. The song, which she is purported to have written in an hour, is a reflection on the hallucinogenic effects of psychedelic drugs; when performed live, it featured a speedier tempo and was an instant favorite among the band&#x27;s followers.

Although Slick was an equal contributor to the Great Society&#x27;s original material, Darby Slick pushed the band toward becoming a raga-influenced psychedelic act. By late 1965, they had become a popular attraction in the Bay Area. Between October and December 1965, the Great Society entered Golden State Recorders and recorded several tracks under the supervision of Sly Stone. One single emerged from the demos, the Darby Slick-penned &quot;Somebody to Love&quot;, the &quot;B&quot; side to &quot;Free Advice&quot;, on the locally based Autumn Records subsidiary label &quot;North Beach&quot;. Grace Slick supplied vocals, guitar, piano, and recorder.

===1966–1972: Jefferson Airplane===

During the autumn of 1966, Jefferson Airplane&#x27;s singer Signe Toly Anderson decided to leave the band to raise her child, and Jack Casady asked Slick to join them. Slick stated that she joined the Airplane because it was run in a professional manner, unlike the Great Society. With Slick on board, Jefferson Airplane began recording new music, and they turned in a more psychedelic direction than their former folk-rock style. &quot;Surrealistic Pillow&quot; included new recordings of &quot;White Rabbit&quot; and &quot;Somebody to Love&quot;, both of which became top 10 singles.

Jefferson Airplane became one of the most popular bands in the country, and through it Slick rose to a position of prominence among female rock musicians of her time. In 1968, Slick performed &quot;Crown of Creation&quot; on &quot;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot; in blackface and ended the performance with a Black Panther raised fist. In an appearance on a 1969 episode of &quot;The Dick Cavett Show&quot;, she became the first person to say &quot;motherfucker&quot; on television during a performance of &quot;We Can Be Together&quot;.

===1970–1984: Jefferson Starship and solo career===

After Jack Casady and Jorma Kaukonen decided to leave Jefferson Airplane to focus on their project Hot Tuna, Slick formed Jefferson Starship with Paul Kantner and other bandmates, and also began a string of solo albums with &quot;Manhole&quot;, followed by &quot;Dreams&quot;, &quot;Welcome to the Wrecking Ball!&quot;, and &quot;Software&quot;. &quot;Manhole&quot; also featured keyboardist/bassist Pete Sears, who joined Jefferson Starship in 1974. Sears and Slick penned several early Jefferson Starship songs together, including &quot;Hyperdrive&quot; and &quot;Play On Love&quot;. &quot;Dreams&quot;, which was produced by Ron Frangipane and incorporated many of the ideas Slick encountered attending twelve-step program meetings, is the most personal of her solo albums, and was nominated for a Grammy Award. 

Slick was nicknamed &quot;The Chrome Nun&quot; by David Crosby, who also used the nickname &quot;Baron von Tollbooth&quot; for Kantner. Their nicknames appear as the title of an album she made in 1973 with bandmates Kantner and David Freiberg: &quot;Baron von Tollbooth &amp; the Chrome Nun&quot;.

===1984–1989: Starship and Jefferson Airplane reunion===

During the 1980s, while Slick was the only member remaining from Jefferson Airplane in Starship, the band went on to score three chart-topping successes with &quot;We Built This City&quot;, &quot;Sara&quot;, and &quot;Nothing&#x27;s Gonna Stop Us Now&quot;. Despite the success, Slick since has spoken negatively about the experience and the music. In 1987, Slick co-hosted &quot;The Legendary Ladies of Rock &amp; Roll&quot;, for which she also sang backing vocals on &quot;Be My Baby&quot; and &quot;Da Doo Ron Ron&quot;. She left Starship in 1988, shortly after the release of &quot;No Protection&quot;.

In 1989, Slick and her former Jefferson Airplane band members reformed the group. They released a self-titled reunion album, and held a successful tour before disbanding.

===1990–present: Retirement===

Following the Jefferson Airplane reunion, Slick retired from the music business. During a 1998 interview with VH1 on a &quot;Behind the Music&quot; documentary featuring Jefferson Airplane, Slick, who was never shy about discussing the process of getting old, said that the main reason she retired from the music business was that, &quot;All rock-and-rollers over the age of 50 look stupid and should retire.&quot; In a 2007 interview, she repeated her belief that, &quot;You can do jazz, classical, blues, opera, country until you&#x27;re 150, but rap and rock and roll are really a way for young people to get that anger out&quot;, and, &quot;It&#x27;s silly to perform a song that has no relevance to the present or expresses feelings you no longer have.&quot;

Despite her retirement, Slick has appeared twice with Kantner&#x27;s revamped version of Jefferson Starship; the first came in 1995 when the band played at Los Angeles&#x27;s House of Blues, as documented on the live album &quot;Deep Space/Virgin Sky&quot;. The second was for a post-9/11 gig in late 2001, during which she came on the stage initially covered in black from head to toe in a makeshift burqa. She then removed the burqa to reveal a covering bearing an American flag and the words &quot;Fuck Fear&quot;. Her statement to fans on the outfit was: &quot;The outfit is not about Islam, it&#x27;s about oppression; this flag is not about politics, it&#x27;s about liberty.&quot;

After retiring from music, Slick began painting and drawing. She has done many renditions of her fellow 1960s musicians, including Janis Joplin, Jerry Garcia, and others. Slick has had a passion for art since she was a child, before she pivoted to music. In 2000, she began displaying and selling her artwork. She attends many of her art shows across the United States. She has generally refrained from engaging in the music business, although she did perform on &quot;Knock Me Out&quot;, a track from &quot;In Flight&quot;, the 1996 solo debut from former 4 Non Blondes singer, and friend of daughter China, Linda Perry. The song was also on the soundtrack to the film &quot;The Crow: City of Angels.&quot;

Slick published her autobiography, &quot;Somebody to Love? A Rock and Roll Memoir&quot;, in 1998 and narrated an abridged version of the book as an audiobook. A biography, &quot;Grace Slick, The Biography&quot;, by Barbara Rowes, was released in 1980 and is currently out of print. In a 2001 &quot;USA Today&quot; article, Slick said, &quot;I&#x27;m in good health and people want to know what I do to be this way ... I don&#x27;t eat cheese, I don&#x27;t eat duck—the point is I&#x27;m vegan.&quot; However, she admitted she&#x27;s &quot;not strict vegan, because I&#x27;m a hedonist pig. If I see a big chocolate cake that is made with eggs, I&#x27;ll have it.&quot;

In 2006, Slick suffered from diverticulitis. After initial surgery, she had a relapse requiring further surgery and a tracheotomy. She was placed in an induced coma for two months and then had to learn to walk again. Also in 2006, Slick gave a speech at the inauguration of the new Virgin America airline, which named their first aircraft &quot;Jefferson Airplane&quot;.

In 2010, Slick co-wrote &quot;Edge of Madness&quot; with singer Michelle Mangione to raise money for remediation efforts following the BP oil spill. Grace also sang background vocals on the song and is clearly audible in the middle of the song singing, &quot;On the edge of madness.&quot; In recent years, Slick has made sporadic appearances and has done radio interviews. She accepted Jefferson Airplane&#x27;s Grammy Lifetime Achievement awards in 2016, and made an appearance for the unveiling of the band&#x27;s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2022.

==Personal life==
Slick was married to cinematographer and drummer Gerald &quot;Jerry&quot; Slick from 1961 to 1971, then to lighting designer Skip Johnson from 1976 to 1994. She has a daughter, actress China Wing Kantner, born January 25, 1971. China&#x27;s father is Jefferson Airplane guitarist Paul Kantner, with whom Slick had a relationship from 1969 to 1975.

In 1971, Slick was severely injured when she crashed a car into the inside of a tunnel in San Francisco. This happened while she was drag racing Jorma Kaukonen and both were driving over .

Slick has publicly acknowledged her alcoholism and use of substances including LSD (for which she got the nickname The Acid Queen) and marijuana. She has discussed this and her rehabilitation experiences in her autobiography, various interviews, and several published celebrity addiction and recovery books. The latter include &quot;The Courage to Change&quot; by Dennis Wholey and &quot;The Harder They Fall&quot; by Gary Stromberg and Jane Merrill.

Her alcoholism became a problem for the band during Jefferson Starship&#x27;s 1978 European tour. The group had to cancel the first performance night in Germany because she was too intoxicated to perform, causing the audience to riot. She performed the next night with the band but was so inebriated that she could not sing properly. She also attacked the audience, mocking Germany for losing World War II and groping both female audience members and bandmates. She left the group the next day, and she was &quot;dragged off&quot; a San Francisco game show for abusing the contestants. She was admitted to a detoxification facility at least twice, once during the 1970s at Duffy&#x27;s in Napa Valley, and once in the 1990s with daughter China.

===Legal incidents===
President Richard Nixon&#x27;s daughter Tricia and Slick are both alumnae of Finch College, and Slick was invited to a tea party for the alumnae at the White House in 1969. She invited anarchist Abbie Hoffman to be her escort and planned to spike President Nixon&#x27;s tea with 600 micrograms of LSD, but the party had been billed as an &quot;all ladies&quot; event. Hoffman&#x27;s presence in the waiting line immediately aroused the suspicions of White House security personnel. He claimed to be Slick&#x27;s &quot;bodyguard and escort&quot;, which failed to convince the security personnel, who told him that the event was &quot;strictly for females&quot;.

Hoffman then took out a black flag with a multicolored marijuana leaf and hung it on the White House gate. Slick declined to attend once Hoffman was denied entry, and the two ran across the street to a waiting car. Slick later speculated that she received the invitation only because it was addressed to &quot;Grace Wing&quot; (her maiden name), and that she never would have been invited if the Nixons had known that she was Grace Slick.

Slick was arrested at least four times for what she has referred to as &quot;TUI&quot; (&quot;talking under the influence&quot;) and &quot;drunk mouth&quot;. One incident occurred when a police officer encountered her sitting against a tree trunk in the backwoods of Marin County, California, drinking wine, eating bread, and reading poetry. The officer asked what she was doing; she gave a sarcastic response and was arrested and jailed. She was arrested in 1994 for assault with a deadly weapon after pointing an unloaded gun at a police officer. She alleged that the officer had come onto her property without explanation.

==Visual art==

After retiring, and after a house fire, divorce, and breakup, Slick began drawing and painting animals, mainly to amuse herself and because doing so made her happy during a difficult period in her life. Soon thereafter, she was approached about writing her memoir, which ultimately became &quot;Somebody to Love? A Rock-and-Roll Memoir&quot;. Her agent saw her artwork and asked her to do some portraits of some of her various contemporaries from the rock-and-roll genre to be included in the autobiography. Hesitant at first (because she thought &quot;it was way too cute. Rock-n-Roll draws Rock-n-Roll&quot;), she eventually agreed because she found she enjoyed it, and color renditions of Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, and Jerry Garcia appeared in the completed autobiography.

An &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;-themed painting and various other sketches are scattered throughout the book. Her paintings of Jorma Kaukonen and Jack Casady were used for the cover art of the 1998 album &quot;The Best of Hot Tuna&quot;. Though Slick has been drawing and painting since she was a child, she admits to not being able to multitask, so did not do much of it while she was focusing on her music career. A notable exception is the 1974 cover art of her first solo album, &quot;Manhole&quot;, which she signed &quot;Child Type Odd Art by Grace&quot;.

Slick does not always use the same style or medium in her production of visual art and has no interest in doing so. She uses acrylic paints (saying oil paint takes too long to dry), canvas, pen, ink, scratchboard, pastels, and pencil. Many of her works are mixed media. Her styles include the children&#x27;s bookish &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; themes, realistic rock and roll portraits, scratchboards of animals, minimalist ink wash-styled nudes and a variety of other subjects and styles.

The best-selling prints and originals are her various renditions of the White Rabbit and the portraits of her colleagues in the music industry. In 2006, the popularity of her &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; works led to a partnership with Dark Horse Comics, Inc. that resulted in the release of stationery and journals with the &quot;Wonderland&quot; motif.

While critics have variously panned and praised her work, Slick seems indifferent to the criticism. She views her visual artistry as just another extension of the artistic temperament that landed her in the music business in the first place, as it allows her to continue to produce art in a way that does not require the physical demands of appearing on a stage nightly or traveling with a large group of people.

Interviewed in 2007, Slick attends many of her art gallery shows across the United States, sometimes attending more than 30 shows in a year. While she says she enjoys talking with the people who come to her art shows, she is not a fan of the traveling involved, particularly the flying.

==Legacy==
Slick, famous as a rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll singer, was one of the earliest female rock stars alongside her close contemporary Janis Joplin, and was an important figure in the development of rock music in the late 1960s. Her distinctive vocal style and striking stage presence exerted influence on other female performers, including Stevie Nicks, Patti Smith, and Terri Nunn.

Between 1985 and 1999, Slick was the oldest female vocalist on a &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart-topping single. &quot;We Built This City&quot; reached number one on November 16, 1985, shortly after her 46th birthday. Previously, the distinction of the oldest female vocalist with a chart-topping single was Tina Turner, who at age 44 had 1984&#x27;s number-one smash, &quot;What&#x27;s Love Got To Do With It&quot;. Turner (who was one month younger than Slick) turned 45 two months after the song topped the charts. Slick broke her own record in April 1987 at age 47 when &quot;Nothing&#x27;s Gonna Stop Us Now&quot; topped the US charts. Her record stood for 12 years but was ultimately broken by Cher, who was 53 in 1999 when &quot;Believe&quot; hit number one.

Slick performed vocals for a piece known as &quot;Jazz Numbers&quot;, a series of animated shorts about the numbers two through 10 (a number-one short was never made), which aired on &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. The segment for the number two appeared in the first episode of the first season of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, November 10, 1969. She was nominated for a Grammy Award in 1981 as Best Rock Female Vocalist for her solo album &quot;Dreams&quot;. She also performed the song &quot;Panda&quot; at the 1990 March for the Animals.

She was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996 as a member of Jefferson Airplane.

In 1993, she narrated the Stephen King short story &quot;You Know They Got a Hell of a Band&quot; on his &quot;Nightmares &amp; Dreamscapes&quot; audiobook.

She was ranked number 20 on VH1&#x27;s 100 Greatest Women of Rock N Roll in 1999.

In 2017, Grace Slick licensed the Starship song &quot;Nothing&#x27;s Gonna Stop Us Now&quot; to Chick-fil-A to use in a TV commercial, but because she disagrees with Chick-fil-A&#x27;s corporate views on same-sex marriage she gave all of the proceeds of that deal to Lambda Legal, an organization that works to advance the civil rights of LGBTQ people and everyone living with HIV.

<text>A body orifice is any opening in the body of an animal.

==External==
In a typical mammalian body such as the human body, the external body orifices are:

* The nostrils, for breathing and the associated sense of smell
* The mouth, for eating, drinking, breathing, and vocalizations such as speech
* The ear canals, for the sense of hearing 
* The nasolacrimal ducts, to carry tears from the lacrimal sac into the nasal cavity
* The anus, for defecation
* The urinary meatus, for urination in males and females and ejaculation in males
* In females, the vagina, for menstruation, copulation and birth
* The nipple orifices

Other animals may have some other body orifices:
*cloaca, in birds, reptiles, amphibians, and a few mammals, such as monotremes.
*siphon in mollusks, arthropods, and some other animals

==Internal==
Internal orifices include the orifices of the outflow tracts of the heart, between the heart valves.

<doc id="314034" wikidata="Q5648507" url="?curid=314034" title="Hank the Angry Drunken Dwarf">
<text>Henry Joseph Nasiff Jr. (April 20, 1962 – September 4, 2001), better known professionally as Hank the Angry Drunken Dwarf, was an American entertainer. He appeared numerous times on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; and on the televised studio segments which aired on the E! channel. He was a member of the show&#x27;s Wack Pack. Hank&#x27;s career began August 16, 1996, when he entered Stern&#x27;s studio at radio station WXRK (K-Rock) in New York City. He was tall and weighed .

Hank received widespread media coverage in 1998 when he won a &quot;People&quot; magazine online poll asking the public to vote for the most beautiful person in the world as part of the run-up promotion for the magazine&#x27;s &quot;50 Most Beautiful People&quot; issue. When the public was given the option to submit a write-in candidate, the magazine had not counted on 230,169 votes for Hank the Angry Drunken Dwarf—beating out assorted celebrities by a wide margin. In third place was Leonardo DiCaprio, with 14,471 votes. In the early years of public participation on the Internet, media critics responded by wondering whether this was evidence of an emerging digital democracy.

== Early life ==
Henry Joseph Nasiff Jr. was born on April 20, 1962, in Fall River, Massachusetts. He was diagnosed with achondroplasia dwarfism a week after he was born. His mother, Claudette, taught him from a young age that he could do whatever he set his mind to do, and Hank learned to ride a bike and participated in Little League Baseball for several seasons. When Hank was twelve he had an operation on his legs to straighten them. Although doctors had said that he would eventually require more surgery, Hank put off doing it and ultimately opted to not undergo another operation.

Before being associated with &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;, Hank had a bit part in an ongoing performance of &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; at a Boston dinner theater. Hank played a character who would pop up out of a beer keg at the end of each performance. He was paid $50 to say four lines of dialogue. The gig lasted two years.

== First &quot;Stern Show&quot; appearance ==
Hank met Howard Stern on August 16, 1996, after driving to New York City with a friend from the Boston dinner theatre. After a night of drinking, Hank was waiting outside the K-Rock studios in Manhattan at 5:30am. He never had a doubt that he would make it onto the air. Stern&#x27;s producer Gary Dell&#x27;Abate recalled arriving at work and encountering an obviously intoxicated dwarf who aggressively demanded that he be permitted to meet Stern:

There was a dwarf standing there, and I remember he was wearing a Hawaiian shirt and one of those Hawaiian leis. And he had a vodka bottle in his hand... and he was drunk beyond belief. And it really was like a gift for our show. It was like a gift fell out of the sky. He could go to Regis, he could go to Letterman, he could go to all those shows, and they&#x27;d have him arrested. And I said &#x27;Howard, I just walked in and there&#x27;s a drunken dwarf wearing a Hawaiian lei, with a vodka bottle.&#x27; And [Howard] said, &#x27;Bring him in &quot;immediately&quot;.&#x27; He really found the right place.

Hank&#x27;s first appearance that day included reading a series of one-sentence jabs against various groups and ethnicities which he had scrawled on a piece of paper the night before.


Hank asserted from his first on-air conversation with Stern that he be referred to as a dwarf and not a midget, and was quick to correct anyone who violated this rule, viewing it as an issue of respect. The name of Hank&#x27;s character came about spontaneously during his first appearance. During that day&#x27;s show, Stern commented: &quot;I&#x27;ve always wanted an angry, drunken dwarf on my program and now I&#x27;ve got one&quot;. A short time later he added, &quot;Isn&#x27;t this great? An angry dwarf, an angry drunken dwarf. Everything I&#x27;ve ever dreamed about.&quot;

From his first appearance until his death five years later, Hank the Angry Drunken Dwarf became a popular character on the show. Never afraid to express himself, Hank would come across completely unguarded. In terms of being belligerent, Hank&#x27;s manager Doug Z. Goodstein explained that this tended to only occur when Hank was really drunk and people would heckle him. He described Hank &quot;as a relatively soft-spoken polite guy who quite often had a big smile on his face.&quot; Behind Hank&#x27;s public persona, an underlying &quot;good nature&quot; tended to shine through, which fans seemed to recognize. During the first few years, Hank would take the bus from Boston each month as soon as he got his SSI disability check. Hank was a member of the show&#x27;s Wack Pack and soon attracted a large informal fan base.

Hank was not paid for his appearances on the show, but he said sometimes they would &quot;slip [him] a little under the table.&quot; Adding, &quot;What do I need money for anyway? People fight to buy me drinks.&quot;

== Most Beautiful Person poll ==
In May 1998, &quot;People Magazine&quot; conducted an online poll on their website asking the public to vote to determine the &quot;Most Beautiful People&quot; in the world as part of the promotion for their annual Spring issue. The film &quot;Titanic&quot; had been released the previous winter, and had a prominent position in American popular culture. There were indications that &quot;People&#x27;s&quot; editors simply assumed that the film&#x27;s leading star, Leonardo DiCaprio, would automatically garner the most votes.

The magazine also allowed readers to submit a write-in candidate. The suggestion to vote for Hank the Angry Drunken Dwarf started on a Stern fan website and was discussed on message boards, and Stern mentioned it on air a few times. Word started to spread and votes for Hank started coming into &quot;People&quot; Online at a rate of fifty per minute. The voting lasted a week, and by that Wednesday Hank had garnered 50,000 votes as a write-in candidate.

The following Tuesday, the official poll results were posted and Hank the Angry Drunken Dwarf had won by a landslide with 230,169 votes. DiCaprio&#x27;s final tally was 14,471 votes (third place). In second-place was another write-in candidate, professional wrestler Ric Flair, with 17,145 votes. The executive editor of &quot;People&quot; was none too thrilled with the poll&#x27;s outcome, stating, &quot;Frankly, I think it&#x27;s stupid.&quot;

When &quot;People&#x27;s&quot; &quot;50 Most Beautiful People&quot; issue was released, DiCaprio appeared on the cover. (The magazine photographed Hank so that he was mentioned on their website along with the more famous runners-up).

Details of what had happened with the poll were picked up by various media; as one writer explained, &quot;Voting for Hank offered people a chance to violate &quot;People&#x27;s&quot; expectations while still playing by its rules&quot;. Some observers concluded that the reaction by the public to vote for Hank was a veiled commentary on how the media assumes that the masses are easily manipulated into liking what is marketed to them. The &quot;New York Times&quot; quoted a participant in the poll as stating, &quot;The &#x27;media&#x27; tells us what food to eat, what movies to see, what music to listen to, who to vote for politically and what kind of people are attractive enough to have relationships with!...Voting for &#x27;Hank the Dwarf&#x27; is a reflection of how the people really feel about media!&quot;

And some saw it as public recognition of Hank&#x27;s &quot;inner beauty.&quot; Hank himself often wondered what it all meant.

== Memorable appearances ==
Whenever Hank appeared on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; inevitably he would be carrying a green plastic bottle of Sprite or some other soda mixed with vodka. He explained that it was so he could drink during the bus commute from Boston without getting hassled.

Hank would don a costume for some appearances, such as when he was an angel with wings and a halo; a leprechaun; or dressed as Superman.

On March 4, 1998, Hank dressed in a pink rabbit suit, took a succession of phone calls from Stern listeners, sang karaoke to Led Zeppelin songs, and blew a .375 on a breathalyzer test.

After the publicity generated by the online poll, Hank started appearing more often on the &quot;Stern Show&quot;. In June 1998, Hank was followed by the cameras of &quot;E! Entertainment Television&quot; as he was given a make-over. Hank had his 1970s-era hair cut at a salon; had a manicure; received an eye exam and new glasses; got fitted for a tuxedo; and was supposed to have his teeth cleaned at a dentist, but was too inebriated.

One of the producers from &quot;E!&quot; started managing Hank, and soon he was being offered various paying gigs to make appearances at bachelor parties, bars, strip clubs, etc. His manager related in an interview that &quot;Hank was diligent in finding out every fine detail about his appearances and treated them with the utmost professionalism.&quot; Hank would be hired to sing karaoke, bartend, or hurl insults. He also started merchandising a line of T-shirts and key chains. Hank, once dependent on disability checks, was now making $5,000–7,000 per month. He had bought himself a new stereo, and was most excited about almost being out of credit card debt.
When Hank was asked if he was worried that he was being exploited he replied: &quot;No, and even If I am I don&#x27;t care, I&#x27;m making money.&quot;

In 1999 Hank was hired by Interplay Entertainment to promote the developer&#x27;s upcoming video game &quot;Messiah&quot;. Hank donned an angel costume and wandered the streets of various cities with a sign promoting the game. Several videos of these public events were eventually released as commercials to advertise the game.

On November 29, 2000, Hank again dressed up in his iconic bunny costume and was sent by Stern to disrupt extreme performer David Blaine during his Frozen in Time stunt. Speaking remotely through a portable microphone connection, Stern initially wanted Hank to urinate on the statue or streak by it. Not wanting to be incarcerated, Hank refused and instead gave Blaine the middle finger.

== Rock trivia contest ==
Hank was intelligent and had an exceptional knowledge of rock music trivia, especially 1960s–1970s rock music. In what many fans consider to be one of his most memorable appearances, on April 25, 2001, Hank competed against Stern producer Gary Dell&#x27;Abate in a rock music trivia contest (Dell&#x27;Abate was scheduled to be a contestant on VH1&#x27;s &quot;Rock &amp; Roll Jeopardy!&quot;). Despite being so inebriated that it was difficult for him to sit fully upright in his chair, Hank easily won the contest. Among the questions that Hank answered correctly included, &quot;Who played keyboards on &#x27;Let It Be&#x27;?&quot;; and &quot;Which group sang the song, &#x27;Green-Eyed Lady&#x27;?&quot; After the match was over, Hank insisted on lying down in the studio and passed out for several minutes. The segment was televised on the &quot;Howard Stern Show&quot; on E!, and has since aired on &quot;Howard TV&quot; on demand. During a later Stern show, Hank also competed against Sugar Ray lead singer Mark McGrath in a rock trivia contest, which Hank also won.

== Film and television ==
Hank was friends with actor Billy Barty and had auditioned for a part in the 1988 movie &quot;Willow&quot; in which Barty had a role as a benevolent wizard, but Hank did not get the part. Because of his friendship with Barty, Hank raised money every year for the Billy Barty Foundation to Benefit Little People.

Hank made at least one appearance on WWF &quot;Raw is War&quot; on May 25, 1998, being presented by The Jackyl as Oddities; and starred in a local commercial selling used cars.

In 2000, Hank played the role of &quot;God&quot; in the movie &quot;Citizen Toxie: The Toxic Avenger IV&quot;.

In 2000, Hank had a supporting actor role in the film &quot;Shoe Shine Boys&quot; playing a mustached felon named Leo Henry Williams. Actor Martin Landau saw the film and was so impressed with Hank&#x27;s performance that he arranged a meeting and met Hank. (The film&#x27;s title was later changed to &quot;Prank&quot;).

In 2001 Hank had a guest starring role in an episode of the FX network comedy &quot;Son of the Beach&quot;.

== Death ==
Hank would occasionally cut down on his drinking. During a &quot;Stern Show&quot; segment in August 1999 in which Howie Mandel was the guest, Hank explained that when he reduced his intake of alcohol it precipitated him to go into a seizure during an appearance in California.

In a documentary short that profiled Hank, his mother related how doctors had told her that Hank&#x27;s liver was damaged, and that she did not know how long he had to live, and that she &quot;didn&#x27;t know what to do.&quot; Hank had been in rehab before, as well as court-mandated detox, and it had never worked. Once Hank was even kicked out of Alcoholics Anonymous because he brought a bottle of MD 20/20 to a meeting and started drinking it five seconds after the meeting started. Regarding trying to get Hank help for his alcoholism, Stern explained, &quot;People always asked me if we tried to get him to stop drinking, and I said all the time we did...&quot; Stern also related that there were employees of the show who tried to get Hank into programs.

Hank had related that he first tried alcohol when his grandfather had given him a taste of blackberry brandy when he was around seven or eight years old (his grandfather died when Hank was eight).
Although the schtick of Hank the Angry Drunken Dwarf was that Hank drank because he was angry about being a dwarf, Hank had actually experienced significant trauma in his life as a child. On his first appearance on the &quot;Stern Show&quot; he related how he had been sexually abused by a male when he was seven years old (Hank explained that it was someone unrelated to him). Later, during another Stern appearance, when asked further about the incident, Hank said that the abuse was in the form of rape. As he got older he said that he almost took out lethal revenge against the perpetrator. When Hank reached adolescence, particularly around the age of fourteen, his drinking started to pick up, and he slowly started &quot;to build up a tolerance&quot;.

On the afternoon of September 4, 2001, Hank died in his sleep at the home he shared with his parents in Fall River. His mother discovered that he had died when she went to wake him. He was 39 years old. His death certificate listed his immediate cause of death as a seizure disorder, with ethanol abuse and chondrodystrophy as contributing factors. Hank is buried at the Notre Dame Cemetery in Fall River, Massachusetts. The next day, Stern devoted most of the show to Hank.

Hank&#x27;s mother, Claudette, called into the &quot;Stern Show&quot; on September 10, 2001, to publicly thank everyone who attended Hank&#x27;s funeral and wake. She also thanked everyone who emailed and sent their condolences. She told an anecdote about how someone in the family had put a can of beer in Hank&#x27;s casket. She said that &quot;someone else slipped a bottle of Jack Daniel&#x27;s in under Hank&#x27;s coat.&quot; She ultimately left the items in the casket because she said that is what Hank would have wanted.

== Aftermath ==
Talk of Hank&#x27;s death in the media was cut short by the events of 9/11. Early in the 8 o&#x27;clock hour of the &quot;Stern Show&quot; on 9/11, Stern was interviewing an executive from the E! channel who said that they were going to produce an &quot;E! True Hollywood Story&quot; about Hank and that Hank actually had quite a few friends in the entertainment industry. (The first plane crashed into the World Trade Center at 8:46am.)

<text>Anorthosite () is a phaneritic, intrusive igneous rock characterized by its composition: mostly plagioclase feldspar (90–100%), with a minimal mafic component (0–10%). Pyroxene, ilmenite, magnetite, and olivine are the mafic minerals most commonly present.

Anorthosites are of enormous geologic interest, because it is still not fully understood how they form. Most models involve separating plagioclase crystals based on their density. Plagioclase crystals are usually less dense than magma; so, as plagioclase crystallizes in a magma chamber, the plagioclase crystals float to the top, concentrating there.

Anorthosite on Earth can be divided into five types: 
# Archean anorthosites
# Proterozoic anorthosite (also known as massif or massif-type anorthosite) – the most abundant type of anorthosite on Earth
# Layers within Layered Intrusions (e.g., Bushveld and Stillwater intrusions)
# Mid-ocean ridge and transform fault anorthosites 
# Anorthosite xenoliths in other rocks (often granites, kimberlites, or basalts)
Of these, the first two are the most common. These two types have different modes of occurrence, appear to be restricted to different periods in Earth&#x27;s history, and are thought to have had different origins.

Lunar anorthosites constitute the light-coloured areas of the Moon&#x27;s surface and have been the subject of much research.

The presence of Martian anorthosites has also been confirmed and is the subject of on-going research.

== Proterozoic anorthosite massifs ==

===Age===
Proterozoic anorthosites were emplaced during the Proterozoic Eon (c. 2,500–542 Ma), though most were emplaced between 1,800 and 1,000 Ma.

===Occurrence===

Proterozoic anorthosites typically occur as extensive stocks or batholiths. The areal extent of anorthosite batholiths ranges from relatively small (dozens or hundreds of square kilometers) to nearly , in the instance of the Nain Plutonic Suite or Mistastin crater in northern Labrador, Canada.

Major occurrences of Proterozoic anorthosite are found in the southeast U.S., the Appalachian Mountains (e.g., the Honeybrook Upland of eastern Pennsylvania), eastern Canada (e.g., the Grenville Province), across southern Scandinavia and eastern Europe. Mapped onto the Pangaean continental configuration of that eon, these occurrences are all contained in a single straight belt, and must all have been emplaced intracratonally. The conditions and constraints of this pattern of origin and distribution are not clear. However, see the Origins section below.

=== Related rocks ===
Many Proterozoic anorthosites occur in spatial association with other highly distinctive, contemporaneous rock types: the so-called &#x27;anorthosite suite&#x27; or &#x27;anorthosite-mangerite-charnockite-granite (AMCG) complex&#x27;.

These rock types can include:
* Mangerite: a pyroxene-bearing monzonite intrusive igneous rock 
* Charnockite: an orthopyroxene-bearing quartz-feldspar rock, once thought to be intrusive igneous, now recognized as metamorphic 
* Iron-rich felsic rocks, including monzonite and rapakivi granite 
* Iron-rich diorite, gabbro, and norite 
* Leucocratic mafic rocks such as leucotroctolite and leuconorite
Though co-eval, these rocks likely represent chemically-independent magmas, likely produced by melting of country rock into which the anorthosites intruded.

Importantly, large volumes of ultramafic rocks are not found in association with Proterozoic anorthosites.

===Physical characteristics===

Since they are primarily composed of plagioclase feldspar, most of Proterozoic anorthosites appear, in outcrop, to be grey or bluish. Individual plagioclase crystals may be black, white, blue, or grey, and may exhibit an iridescence known as labradorescence on fresh surfaces. The feldspar variety labradorite is commonly present in anorthosites. Mineralogically, labradorite is a compositional term for any calcium-rich plagioclase feldspar containing 50–70 molecular percent anorthite (An 50–70), regardless of whether it shows labradorescence. The mafic mineral in Proterozoic anorthosite may be clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene, olivine, or, more rarely, amphibole. Oxides, such as magnetite or ilmenite, are also common.

Most anorthosite plutons are very coarse grained; that is, the individual plagioclase crystals and the accompanying mafic mineral are more than a few centimetres long. Less commonly, plagioclase crystals are megacrystic, or larger than one metre long. However, most Proterozoic anorthosites are deformed, and such large plagioclase crystals have recrystallized to form smaller crystals, leaving only the outline of the larger crystals behind.

While many Proterozoic anorthosite plutons appear to have no large-scale relict igneous structures (having instead post-emplacement deformational structures), some do have igneous layering, which may be defined by crystal size, mafic content, or chemical characteristics. Such layering clearly has origins with a rheologically liquid-state magma.

===Chemical and isotopic characteristics===

Proterozoic anorthosites are typically &gt;90% plagioclase, and the plagioclase composition is commonly between An40 and An60 (40–60% anorthite). This compositional range is intermediate, and is one of the characteristics which distinguish Proterozoic anorthosites from Archean anorthosites (which are typically &gt;An80).

Proterozoic anorthosites often have significant mafic components in addition to plagioclase. These phases can include olivine, pyroxene, Fe-Ti oxides, and/or apatite. Mafic minerals in Proterozoic anorthosites have a wide range of composition, but are not generally highly magnesian.

The trace-element chemistry of Proterozoic anorthosites, and the associated rock types, has been examined in some detail by researchers with the aim of arriving at a plausible genetic theory. However, there is still little agreement on just what the results mean for anorthosite genesis; see the &#x27;Origins&#x27; section below. A very short list of results, including results for rocks thought to be related to Proterozoic anorthosites,

Some research has focused on neodymium (Nd) and strontium (Sr) isotopic determinations for anorthosites, particularly for anorthosites of the Nain Plutonic Suite (NPS). Such isotopic determinations are of use in gauging the viability of prospective sources for magmas that gave rise to anorthosites. Some results are detailed below in the &#x27;Origins&#x27; section.

====High-alumina orthopyroxene megacrysts (HAOMs)====
Many Proterozoic-age anorthosites contain large crystals of orthopyroxene with distinctive compositions. These are the so-called high-alumina orthopyroxene megacrysts (HAOM).

HAOM are distinctive because 1) they contain higher amounts of Al than typically seen in orthopyroxenes; 2) they are cut by numerous thin lathes of plagioclase, which may represent exsolution lamellae; and 3) they appear to be older than the anorthosites in which they are found.

The origins of HAOMs are debated. One possible model suggests that, during anorthosite formation, a mantle-derived melt (or partially-crystalline mush) was injected into the lower crust and began crystallizing. HAOMs would have crystallized out during this time, perhaps as long as 80–120 million years. The HAOM-bearing melt could then have risen to the upper crust. This model is supported by the fact that aluminum is more soluble in orthopyroxene at high pressure. In this model, the HAOM represent lower-crustal cumulates that are related to the anorthosite source-magma. One problem with this model is that it requires the anorthosite source-magma to sit in the low crust for a considerable time. To solve this, some authors suggest that the HAOMs may have formed in the lower crust independent of the anorthosite source-magma. Later, the anorthosite source-magma may have entrained pieces of the HAOM-bearing lower crust on its way upward. Other researchers consider the chemical compositions of the HAOM to be the product of rapid crystallization at moderate or low pressures, eliminating the need for a lower-crustal origin altogether.

===Origins of Proterozoic anorthosites===
The origins of Proterozoic anorthosites have been a subject of theoretical debate for many decades. A brief synopsis of this problem is as follows:

The problem begins with the generation of magma, the necessary precursor of any igneous rock.

Magma generated by small amounts of partial melting of the mantle is generally of basaltic composition. Under normal conditions, the composition of basaltic magma requires it to crystallize between 50 and 70% plagioclase, with the bulk of the remainder of the magma crystallizing as mafic minerals. However, anorthosites are defined by a high plagioclase content (90–100% plagioclase), and are not found in association with contemporaneous ultramafic rocks. This is now known as &#x27;the anorthosite problem.&#x27; Proposed solutions to the anorthosite problem have been diverse, with many of the proposals drawing on different geological subdisciplines. 
It was suggested early in the history of anorthosite debate that a special type of magma, anorthositic magma, had been generated at depth, and emplaced into the crust. However, the solidus of an anorthositic magma is too high for it to exist as a liquid for very long at normal ambient crustal temperatures, so this appears to be unlikely. The presence of water vapor has been shown to lower the solidus temperature of anorthositic magma to more reasonable values, but most anorthosites are relatively dry. It may be postulated, then, that water vapor be driven off by subsequent metamorphism of the anorthosite, but some anorthosites are undeformed, thereby invalidating the suggestion.

The discovery, in the late 1970s, of anorthositic dykes in the Nain Plutonic Suite, suggested that the possibility of anorthositic magmas existing at crustal temperatures needed to be reexamined. However, the dykes were later shown to be more complex than was originally thought.

In summary, though liquid-state processes clearly operate in some anorthosite plutons, the plutons are probably not derived from anorthositic magmas.

Many researchers have argued that anorthosites are the products of basaltic magma, and that mechanical removal of mafic minerals has occurred. Since the mafic minerals are not found with the anorthosites, these minerals must have been left at either a deeper level or the base of the crust. A typical theory is as follows: partial melting of the mantle generates a basaltic magma, which does not immediately ascend into the crust. Instead, the basaltic magma forms a large magma chamber at the base of the crust and fractionates large amounts of mafic minerals, which sink to the bottom of the chamber. The co-crystallizing plagioclase crystals float, and eventually are emplaced into the crust as anorthosite plutons. Most of the sinking mafic minerals form ultramafic cumulates which stay at the base of the crust.

This theory has many appealing features, of which one is the capacity to explain the chemical composition of high-alumina orthopyroxene megacrysts (HAOM). This is detailed below in the section devoted to the HAOM. However, on its own, this hypothesis cannot coherently explain the origins of anorthosites, because it does not fit with, among other things, some important isotopic measurements made on anorthositic rocks in the Nain Plutonic Suite. The Nd and Sr isotopic data show the magma which produced the anorthosites cannot have been derived only from the mantle. Instead, the magma that gave rise to the Nain Plutonic Suite anorthosites must have had a significant crustal component. This discovery led to a slightly more complicated version of the previous hypothesis: Large amounts of basaltic magma form a magma chamber at the base of the crust, and, while crystallizing, assimilating large amounts of crust.

This small addendum explains both the isotopic characteristics and certain other chemical niceties of Proterozoic anorthosite. However, at least one researcher has cogently argued, on the basis of geochemical data, that the mantle&#x27;s role in production of anorthosites must actually be very limited: the mantle provides only the impetus (heat) for crustal melting, and a small amount of partial melt in the form of basaltic magma. Thus anorthosites are, in this view, derived almost entirely from lower crustal melts.

== Lunar anorthosite ==
On the Moon, anorthosite is the dominant rock type of the lunar highlands which covers ~80% of the lunar surface. Lunar anorthosite is characterized as ferroan anorthosite (FAN), or magnesium anorthosite (MAN). Pristine lunar FAN is some of the oldest lunar rock and the original cumulate of the lunar magma ocean, with the Mg-suite forming from later impacts and plutonism. However, debate exists on the magma ocean fractionation complicated by surface impact mixing with evidence potentially indicating MAN being older and more primitive. 

Lunar anorthosite is associated with two other rock types: norite and troctolite. Together, they comprise the &quot;ANT&quot; suite of moon rocks.

== Archean anorthosites ==
Archean anorthosites represent the second largest anorthosite deposits on Earth. Most have been dated between 3,200 and 2,800 Ma, and commonly associated with basalts and/or greenstone belts.

Archean anorthosites are distinct texturally and mineralogically from Proterozoic anorthosite bodies. Their most characteristic feature is the presence of equant, euhedral megacrysts (up to 30 cm) of plagioclase surrounded by a fine-grained mafic groundmass. The plagioclase in these anorthosites is commonly An80-90.

== Economic value ==
The material´s high temperature resistance makes it valuable in applications in the aerospace and defense industries.
===Contents===
The primary economic value of anorthosite bodies is the titanium-bearing oxide ilmenite. However, some Proterozoic anorthosite bodies have large amounts of labradorite, which is quarried for its value as both a gemstone and a building material. Archean anorthosites, because they are aluminium-rich, have large amounts of aluminium substituting for silicon; a few of these bodies are mined as ores of aluminium.

Anorthosite was prominently represented in rock samples brought back from the Moon, and is important in investigations of Mars, Venus, and meteorites.

===Soil development on anorthosite===
In the Adirondack Mountains, soils on anorthositic rock tend to be stony loamy sand with classic podzol profile development usually evident. In the San Gabriel Mountains, soils on anorthosite have a dominance of 1:1 clay minerals (kaolinite and halloysite) in contrast to more mafic rock over which 2:1 clays develop.

<doc id="314039" wikidata="Q331292" url="?curid=314039" title="Duke of Atholl">
<text>Duke of Atholl, named after Atholl in Scotland, is a title in the Peerage of Scotland held by the head of Clan Murray. It was created by Queen Anne in 1703 for John Murray, 2nd Marquess of Atholl, with a special remainder to the heir male of his father, the 1st Marquess.

, there were twelve subsidiary titles attached to the dukedom: Lord Murray of Tullibardine (1604), Lord Murray, Gask and Balquhidder (1628), Lord Murray, Balvany and Gask (1676), Lord Murray, Balvenie and Gask, in the County of Perth (1703), Viscount of Balquhidder (1676), Viscount of Balquhidder, Glenalmond and Glenlyon, in the County of Perth (1703), Earl of Atholl (1629), Earl of Tullibardine (1628), Earl of Tullibardine (1676), Earl of Strathtay and Strathardle, in the County of Perth (1703), Marquess of Atholl (1676) and Marquess of Tullibardine, in the County of Perth (1703). These titles are also in the Peerage of Scotland. The dukes have also previously held the following titles: Baron Strange (Peerage of England 1628) between 1736 and 1764 and 1805 and 1957; Baron Murray, of Stanley in the County of Gloucester, and Earl Strange (Peerage of Great Britain 1786) between 1786 and 1957, Baron Glenlyon, of Glenlyon in the County of Perth (Peerage of the United Kingdom 1821) between 1846 and 1957 and Baron Percy (Peerage of Great Britain 1722) between 1865 and 1957. From 1786 to 1957, the Dukes of Atholl sat in the House of Lords as Earl Strange.

The Duke&#x27;s eldest son and heir apparent uses the courtesy title Marquess of Tullibardine. The heir apparent to Lord Tullibardine uses the courtesy title Earl of Strathtay and Strathardle (usually shortened to Earl of Strathtay). Lord Strathtay&#x27;s heir apparent uses the courtesy title Viscount Balquhidder. The Duke of Atholl is the hereditary chief of Clan Murray.

==Family history==

The Dukes of Atholl belong to an ancient Scottish family. Sir William Murray of Castleton married Lady Margaret, daughter of John Stewart, 1st Earl of Atholl (see Earl of Atholl). Sir William was one of the many Scottish noblemen killed at the Battle of Flodden in 1513. His son Sir William Murray lived at Tullibardine in Perthshire. The latter&#x27;s grandson, Sir John Murray, was created Lord Murray of Tullibardine in 1604 and Lord Murray, Gask and Balquhidder and Earl of Tullibardine in 1606. All three titles were in the Peerage of Scotland. He was succeeded by his eldest son, William Murray (1574–1628), the second Earl of Tullibardine. He married as his third wife Lady Dorothea, daughter of John Stewart, 5th and last Earl of Atholl. Charles I agreed to revive the earldom of Atholl in favour of Lord Tullibardine&#x27;s children by Lady Dorothea. Tullibardine consequently resigned his titles in favour of his younger brother, Patrick Murray, who was created Lord Murray of Gask and Earl of Tullibardine in 1628, with remainder to his heirs male whatsoever and presumably with the precedence of 1606. John Murray, son of the second Earl of Tullibardine by Lady Dorothea Stewart, was created Earl of Atholl in the Peerage of Scotland in 1629. He was succeeded by his son, the second Earl of Atholl. In 1670 he succeeded his cousin James Murray, 2nd Earl of Tullibardine, as third (or fifth) Earl of Tullibardine. In 1676 he was created Lord Murray, Balveny and Gask, Viscount of Balquhidder, Earl of Tullibardine and Marquess of Atholl, with remainder to the heirs male of his body. All titles were in the Peerage of Scotland. Lord Atholl married Lady Amelia Anne Sophia, daughter of James Stanley, 7th Earl of Derby (and 1st Baron Strange).

On his death the titles passed to his eldest son, the second Marquess. He had already been created Lord Murray, Viscount Glenalmond and Earl of Tullibardine for life in the peerage of Scotland in 1696. In 1703 he was made Lord Murray, Balvenie and Gask, in the County of Perth, Viscount of Balwhidder, Glenalmond and Glenlyon, in the County of Perth, Earl of Strathtay and Strathardle, in the County of Perth, Marquess of Tullibardine, in the County of Perth, and Duke of Atholl, with remainder failing heirs male of his own to the heirs male of his father. All five titles were in the Peerage of Scotland. His eldest surviving son and heir apparent, William Murray, Marquess of Tullibardine, took part in the Jacobite rising of 1715. He was charged with high treason and attainted by Act of Parliament. An Act of Parliament was also passed to remove him from the succession to his father&#x27;s titles. William was, on 1 February 1717, created Duke of Rannoch, Marquis of Blair, Earl of Glen Tilt, Viscount of Glenshie, and Lord Strathbran in the Jacobite Peerage. The first Duke was consequently succeeded by his third son, James, the second Duke. In 1736 he also succeeded his kinsman James Stanley, 10th Earl of Derby as 7th Baron Strange and as Lord of Mann. On the death of his brother William in 1746, he succeeded to the Jacobite titles, such as they were. The Duke&#x27;s two sons both died in infancy. His eldest daughter Lady Charlotte succeeded him in the barony of Strange and the lordship of Mann. Atholl died in 1764 and was succeeded in the dukedom and remaining titles by his nephew, John, the third Duke. He was the eldest son of Lt-Gen Lord George Murray, sixth son of the first Duke (who had been attainted for his participation in the Jacobite Rebellion of 1715), the same year he succeeded the House of Lords decided that he should be allowed to succeed in the titles despite his father&#x27;s attainder. He married his first cousin, the aforementioned Charlotte Murray, Baroness Strange. They sold their sovereignty over the Isle of Man to the British Crown for £70,000.
The Duke and Duchess were both succeeded by their eldest son John, the fourth Duke. In 1786 he was created Baron Murray, of Stanley in the County of Gloucester, and Earl Strange in the Peerage of Great Britain. These titles gave him a seat in the House of Lords. Atholl sold his remaining properties and privileges in the Isle of Man to the British Crown for £409,000. He was succeeded on his death in 1829 by his eldest son, John, the fifth Duke. He had already in 1798 been declared to have been of an &quot;unsound mind&quot;. The fifth Duke never married and was succeeded by his nephew, George Murray, 2nd Baron Glenlyon, the eldest son of James Murray, 1st Baron Glenlyon, second son of the fourth Duke, who had been created Baron Glenlyon, of Glenlyon in the County of Perth, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom in 1821. Lord Glenlyon married Lady Emily Frances Percy, daughter of Hugh Percy, 2nd Duke of Northumberland and 3rd Baron Percy.

The sixth Duke was succeeded by his only child, John, the seventh Duke. In 1865 he succeeded as sixth Baron Percy through his grandmother aforesaid. The same year he registered the additional surname of Stewart at the Lyon Court. In 1893 he resumed the original spelling of the title, &quot;Atholl&quot; instead of &quot;Athole&quot;. He was succeeded by his second but eldest surviving son, John, the eighth Duke, who died childless in 1942 and was succeeded by his youngest brother, James, the ninth Duke. James never married, and on his death in 1957 the baronies of Murray and Glenlyon and earldom of Strange became extinct, the barony of Percy was passed on to his kinsman Hugh Percy, 10th Duke of Northumberland, while the barony of Strange fell into abeyance (see Baron Strange).

The dukedom of Atholl and remaining titles were passed on to the late Duke&#x27;s fourth cousin twice removed, Iain Murray, the tenth Duke of Atholl. He was the grandson of Sir Evelyn Murray, son of Sir George Murray, grandson of Dr George Murray, Bishop of Rochester, son of Bishop Lord George Murray, second son of the third Duke. As all the English titles had become extinct on the ninth Duke&#x27;s death, the tenth Duke was not entitled to an automatic seat in the House of Lords, gaining in 1957 the then unfortunate distinction of being the highest ranking peer without a seat in the upper chamber of parliament. However, in 1958 Atholl was elected a Scottish representative peer and was able to take a seat in the House of Lords. Through the Peerage Act 1963 all hereditary Scottish peers gained the right to sit in the House of Lords. The tenth Duke was unmarried and was succeeded in 1996 by his second cousin once removed, John Murray, 11th Duke of Atholl. He was the grandson of the Rev. Douglas Stuart Murray, brother of the aforementioned Sir George Murray, great-grandfather of the tenth Duke. On his death in 2012, the eleventh Duke was succeeded by his eldest son, Bruce Murray, 12th Duke of Atholl.

==Traditional residence and military command==
The Dukes of Atholl&#x27;s traditional residence is Blair Castle, though the family has owned several other residences and castles in the past, notably Huntingtower Castle, Balvenie Castle, Tullibardine Castle and Dunkeld House (the latter two demolished).

The traditional burial place of the Dukes of Atholl is the &quot;Family Burial Ground&quot; (photo) next to the ruins of St Bride&#x27;s Kirk in the grounds of Blair Castle. The ruin stands on a mound a little to the north-east of the castle, where a church has existed since at least 1134. St Bride&#x27;s was the village church of Old Blair but fell into disuse after 1823 when the estate village was relocated to its current location.

The holder of the dukedom of Atholl also commands the only legal private army in Europe, the Atholl Highlanders, which is headquartered at Blair Castle.

<doc id="314043" wikidata="Q1245377" url="?curid=314043" title="Duke of Beaufort">
<text>Duke of Beaufort ( ) is a title in the Peerage of England. It was created by Charles II in 1682 for Henry Somerset, 3rd Marquess of Worcester, a descendant of Charles Somerset, 1st Earl of Worcester, legitimised son of Henry Beaufort, 3rd Duke of Somerset, a Lancastrian leader in the Wars of the Roses. The name &quot;Beaufort&quot; refers to a castle in Champagne, France (now Montmorency-Beaufort). It is the only current dukedom to take its name from a place outside the British Isles.

The Dukes of Beaufort descend in the male line from the House of Plantagenet through John of Gaunt, son of Edward III. This statement was challenged after the analysis of the Y chromosomal DNA of the remains of Richard III. Most living male heirs of the 5th Duke of Beaufort were found to carry a relatively common Y chromosome type, which is different from the rare lineage found in Richard III&#x27;s remains. The instance of false paternity could have occurred anywhere in the numerous generations separating Richard III from the 5th Duke of Beaufort. The break also could have occurred with Richard III&#x27;s grandfather Richard of Conisburgh, whose paternity has been called into question although he was acknowledged by his father.

The Beaufort Castle was in possession of John of Gaunt, and the surname Beaufort was given to Gaunt&#x27;s four legitimised children by his mistress and third wife, Katherine Swynford. This was the foundation of the House of Beaufort, Dukes of Somerset. A descendant of the Beauforts through his mother was Henry VII of England. Charles Somerset, 1st Earl of Worcester, (c. 1460 – 15 March 1526), was the bastard son of Henry Beaufort, 3rd Duke of Somerset by his mistress Joan Hill.

The Duke of Beaufort holds two subsidiary titles – Marquess of Worcester (created 1642) and [[Earl of Worcester]] (created 1514). The title of Marquess of Worcester is used as a courtesy title by the duke&#x27;s eldest son and heir. The title of Earl of Glamorgan is used by the eldest son of the heir apparent to the dukedom. The Earl of Glamorgan&#x27;s eldest son is known as Viscount Grosmont. The Earldom of Glamorgan and Viscountcy of Grosmont derive from an irregular creation in 1644 by Charles I in favour of Edward Somerset, who later succeeded his father as 2nd Marquess of Worcester.

Although the Earldom of Glamorgan and Viscountcy of Grosmont were not recognised as substantive titles at the restoration of Charles II, because of irregularities in the patent of creation, they have nevertheless continued to be used as convenient courtesy titles in order to distinguish the bearer from the Marquess of Worcester as heir apparent, the Earldom of Worcester not being distinctive enough for this purpose. All subsidiary titles are in the Peerage of England.

Field Marshal The Lord Raglan, born Lord FitzRoy Somerset (1788–1855), was the youngest son of the fifth duke.

The family seat was once Raglan Castle in Monmouthshire, but was Badminton House near Chipping Sodbury in Gloucestershire. The principal burial place of the Dukes and Duchesses of Beaufort is St Michael and All Angels&#x27; Church, Badminton.

Following the creation of the dukedom, each successive duke has served as Master of the Duke of Beaufort&#x27;s Hunt, a foxhound pack kenneled on the Badminton Estate.

==Coat of arms==

The heraldic blazon for the coat of arms of the dukedom is: &quot;Quarterly, 1st and 4th, azure three fleurs-de-lys or&quot; (for France); &quot;2nd and 3rd, gules three lions passant guardant in pale or&quot; (for England)&quot;, all within a bordure compony argent and azure&quot;.

This can be translated as: a shield divided into quarters, the top left and bottom right quarters are blue with three golden fleurs-de-lys (for France), and the top right and bottom left quarters are red with three golden lions &quot;passant&quot; with their faces toward the viewer, one above the other (for England); the foregoing quarters are within a border around the shield with segments alternating white and blue.

In heraldry, a &quot;bordure compony&quot; is traditionally used to designate illegitimacy. Since the original Beaufort siblings&#x27; father was of the English royal family, the English royal arms are used. At that time, the king of England also claimed the French crown, hence the inclusion of the French royal arms.

<text>Norwalk is a city in Fairfield County, Connecticut, United States. The city, part of the New York Metropolitan Area, is the sixth-most populous city in Connecticut as of the 2020 census, with a population of 91,184.

Norwalk is on the northern shore of Long Island Sound and was first settled in 1649.

==History==
Roger Ludlow purchased the areas east of the Norwalk River from Chief Mahackemo of the Norwaake (or Naramauke) Indians in 1640. Norwalk was settled in 1649, incorporated September 1651, and named after the Algonquin word , meaning &quot;point of land&quot;, or more probably from the Native American name &quot;Naramauke&quot;.

The Battle of Norwalk took place during the Revolutionary War, and led to the burning of most of the town. In 1836, the borough of Norwalk was created, covering the central area of the town. In 1853, the first ever train disaster in the United States happened over the Norwalk River. During the 19th and early 20th century, Norwalk was a major railroad stop for the New York, New Haven, and Hartford Railroad. The city of South Norwalk and the remaining parts of the town of Norwalk were both combined in 1910 to form the current city.

The Ku Klux Klan had a brief presence in Norwalk during the 1920s, but quickly fell apart due to internal issues. In 1955, multiple hurricanes hit the city, causing flooding in Norwalk Harbor. During the 1970s, efforts were taken to historically preserve South Norwalk, resulting in the creation of the Washington Street Historic District.

Norwalk has voted Democratic for president since 1992, when the city voted for Bill Clinton. However, between 1928 and 1992, the city only voted Democratic twice: 1936 and 1964.


===Districts===
Norwalk has six taxing districts. The First, Second, Third, and Sixth taxing districts are political entities with their respective voters electing officers, holding annual business meetings, approving budgets, and considering other matters, as specified in each of their charters. Election of Taxing District Commissioners and Treasurers by voters from the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 6th districts take place in odd-numbered years. The Fourth and Fifth districts are not counted as separate governments, as they constitute the city proper. Each taxing district has its own property tax rate reflecting the mix of services each receives from the city.
Secondly, municipal elections of mayor, common council, board of education, and other positions are also held in odd-numbered years at 13 polling places within five voting districts around the city. Voting districts are not the same for state and federal elections, which are held on even-numbered years at 12 polling locations.

====Municipal====
Norwalk&#x27;s municipal government is a weak-mayor form of a mayor-council government with the mayor of Norwalk elected by its voters. The city&#x27;s charter gives certain administrative powers exclusively to the council and others jointly to the Council and Mayor. The Common Council is the law-writing body of the City of Norwalk. Norwalk&#x27;s common council consists of fifteen council members, five elected at-large and ten elected by district, two from each district.

===Representatives===

Norwalk is represented in the Connecticut General Assembly by five House representatives corresponding to five Connecticut legislative districts and one senator from one Connecticut Senate district.

Norwalk, which lies within Connecticut&#x27;s 4th congressional district, is represented in the United States Congress by one congressional representative (Democrat Jim Himes) in the United States House of Representatives, and along with the rest of Connecticut, by two U.S. Senators (Democrats Richard Blumenthal and Chris Murphy) in the United States Senate.

==Education==

Norwalk Public Schools operates public schools, while the community also has various private schools.

Norwalk was granted a town charter by the Connecticut General Court in 1651. On May 29, 1678, town records mention the establishment of community-supported teaching activities with a passage that reads:
&quot;&#x27;At a town meeting... voted and agreed to hier a scole master to teach all the children in ye town to lerne to Rede and write; and that Mr. Cornish shall be hierd for that service and the townsmen are to hier him upon as reasonable terms as they can.&quot;

The school that was established in the 1670s was located near the Ludlow Square area of East Norwalk (near the former Roger Ludlow Junior High School).

==Sports==
Baseball and softball are popular amateur sports with active leagues across many age groups in Norwalk. Four baseball fields and 16 Little League fields are in the city. Several of the fields, including Calf Pasture Beach, are illuminated for nighttime play. The fields at the Norwalk Little League team won the Little League World Series in 1952.

Being a coastal city, Norwalk is home to a great many water sports, including competitive swimming, recreational boating and fishing, sailing, windsurfing, and kayaking. The Norwalk River and inner Norwalk Harbor host rowing events and organizations. Norwalk resident Daniel Walsh won a bronze medal in Beijing
with the U.S. Olympic rowing team in the 2008 Summer Olympics.

Three golf courses are in the city of Norwalk: Shorehaven Golf Club is a private club in East Norwalk, the Silvermine Golf Club is a private club in Silvermine (part of the course lies in the town of Wilton), and the Oak Hills Park golf course is a public course in West Norwalk.

The cross-town rivalry between the city&#x27;s two largest high schools, Norwalk High School and Brien McMahon High School, is fierce, particularly for the football, basketball, soccer, and field hockey teams in the fall, as well as lacrosse, baseball, and softball teams in the spring. Brien McMahon High School&#x27;s football team won the Fairfield County Interscholastic Athletic Conference and Class M State Football championship in 1994. McMahon High School&#x27;s boys&#x27; lacrosse team won the state division 2 lacrosse championship in 2000.

==Infrastructure==
===Utilities===
Electric power and natural gas in most of Norwalk are provided by Eversource Energy.
* The First Taxing District provides water to the Third, Fourth and Fifth Taxing Districts.
* The Second Taxing District serves sections of South Norwalk, East Norwalk, West Norwalk, Rowayton and Silvermine. and also owns and operates South Norwalk Electric and Water.
* The Third Taxing District provides electric power for East Norwalk.
The districts purchase wholesale power and arrange for its delivery to, and distribution within, their respective districts. Power lines and meters in East Norwalk, South Norwalk, and parts of Rowayton are maintained by the districts. Both the second (SNEW) and third (TTD) district electric departments belong to the six member Connecticut Municipal Electric Energy Cooperative which pools their wholesale power purchasing to obtain lower rates for their customers.

Connecticut Light and Power (now Eversource Energy) operated a power plant, Norwalk Harbor Station on Manresa Island, from 1960 to 1999 when it was acquired by NRG Energy, which then began its deactivation in 2013.

In 2004 the Third Taxing District installed three diesel powered generators at the Norden complex on Norden Place that were initially licensed only for emergency power supply. By summer 2008 the generators, with a combined capacity of 6 Megawatts, had been upgraded to allow licensed operation as regular power providers for the grid (not just emergency power).

In 2007 and 2008 the construction of the Middletown-Norwalk transmission line disrupted traffic along the Boston Post Road, but the completion of the line was hoped to help provide additional power to lower Fairfield County. In addition, a high-voltage undersea line runs from Manressa Island to Long Island to help provide electric power to Long Island Power Authority customers. In 2008, the city government of Norwalk started initial investigations of whether the city might resume generating power for sale to electricity customers in the city.

===Emergency services===

Norwalk Police Department serves as the city&#x27;s police department, and Norwalk Fire Department serves Norwalk&#x27;s fire protection district. Norwalk is served 24/7 by Norwalk Hospital and Norwalk Hospital EMS, a 911 paramedic service.

<text>The 3-D Battles of WorldRunner (shortened to 3-D WorldRunner on the North American box art), originally released in Japan as , is a 1987 third-person rail shooter platform video game developed and published by Square for the Family Computer Disk System. It was later ported to cartridge format and published by Acclaim for the Nintendo Entertainment System.

For its time, the game was technically advanced; the game&#x27;s three-dimensional scrolling effect is very similar to the linescroll effects used by &quot;Pole Position&quot; and many racing games of the day as well as the forward-scrolling effect of Sega&#x27;s 1985 third-person rail shooter &quot;Space Harrier&quot;. &quot;3-D WorldRunner&quot; was an early forward-scrolling pseudo-3D third-person platform-action game where players were free to move in any forward-scrolling direction and had to leap over obstacles and chasms. It was also notable for being one of the first stereoscopic 3-D games. &quot;WorldRunner&quot; was designed by Hironobu Sakaguchi and Nasir Gebelli, with music composed by Nobuo Uematsu. All were later core members of the team behind the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; role-playing video game series.

==Gameplay==

&quot;WorldRunner&quot; features many sprite-based elements that are typical of a forward-scrolling rail shooter game, where the player focuses on destroying or dodging onscreen enemies against a scrolling background. &quot;3-D WorldRunner&quot; incorporates a distinct third-person view, where the camera angle is positioned behind the main character.

As Jack, players make their way through eight worlds, battling hostile alien creatures such as blob monsters and leaping over bottomless canyons. Each world is divided into different quadrants, and the player must pass through each quadrant before the time counter on the bottom of the game screen reaches zero. In each quadrant, the player can find pillar-like columns that house power-ups, objects that are beneficial or add extra abilities to the game character such as temporary invincibility or laser missiles. At the end of each world&#x27;s last quadrant is a serpentine creature which must be defeated to advance. A status bar at the bottom of the screen displays the player&#x27;s score, the time counter, the world number, the world quadrant, the number of bonus stars (items that increase the player&#x27;s score count) collected by the player, and the number of lives remaining.

Because the game is set against a constantly scrolling screen, Jack&#x27;s movement cannot be stopped, but the player can speed up or slow down Jack&#x27;s pace. The player is also allowed a degree of limited horizontal movement. When fighting Serpentbeasts at the end of each world, the player is capable of moving Jack freely in all directions. Jack&#x27;s basic actions consist of jumping, used to dodge canyons and enemies, and firing collectible missiles of various types to destroy enemies.

Part of the appeal and selling point of &quot;WorldRunner&quot; was its &quot;3D mode&quot;. It was the first of three games by Square to feature such an option. To enter or exit 3D mode, players would press the select button. When the 3D mode is enabled, the game uses computer image processing techniques to combine images from two slightly different viewpoints into a single image in a process known as anaglyph 3D. While North American copies of the game included a pair of 3D glasses for players to view the effect, such glasses were sold separately from Japanese copies.

==Plot==
Players assume the role of Jack the WorldRunner, a wild &quot;space cowboy&quot; on a mission to save various planets overrun by serpentine beasts. The game takes place in Solar System #517, which is being overrun by a race of aliens known as Serpentbeasts, who are led by the evil Grax. As WorldRunner, the player must battle through eight planets to find and destroy Grax with fireballs.

==Development==
In a 1999 interview with &quot;NextGeneration&quot; magazine, Sakaguchi admitted that he &quot;liked &quot;Space Harrier&quot;&quot;, but said that his main reason for the development of the game was that Square owner Masafumi Miyamoto wanted to demonstrate Nasir Gebelli&#x27;s 3D programming techniques for which he had been hired.

==Reception==
At the time of release, &quot;Cashbox&quot; magazine praised the games visual effects and the variety of enemies and obstacles.

In retrospective reviews, the game had a mixed reception. &quot;Game Informer&quot; praises the surrealistic landscape and behind the character running capability, but noted that they were not capable of seeing the 3D effect even with the 3D glasses on. &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; criticized for being a seeming ripoff of Sega&#x27;s &quot;Space Harrier&quot;, noting that even the bosses of both games look similar. They did applaud the soundtrack and the bright visuals, comparing the color palette to &quot;Fantasy Zone&quot;. Vito Gesualdi of &quot;Destructoid&quot; named it among the &quot;five most notorious videogame ripoffs of all time&quot; in 2013.

Commercially, the game was met with modest success, selling roughly 500,000 copies worldwide. The sales of this game title and other titles from Square at this time were not enough for Square to stay in business, and the companies fortunes only turned around with the release of the first &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;.

===Sequel===
 is a Japan-only follow-up to the game released on December 7, 1987, developed by the same team who did the original, but as a regular cart instead of for the Disk System. &quot;JJ&quot; was one of the few games to utilize the Famicom 3D System, and was Square&#x27;s last work before the inception of the popular &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; franchise.

&quot;JJ&quot; is a sort of &quot;dark version&quot; of the original game; it moves at a much faster pace with increased difficulty, plus a more &quot;sinister&quot; art style and use of color. The soundtrack was again composed by Nobuo Uematsu, and each track was made to match the respective track from the first game.

<text>Arduin is a fictional universe and fantasy role-playing system created in the mid-1970s by David A. Hargrave. It was the first published &quot;cross-genre&quot; fantasy RPG, with everything from interstellar wars to horror and historical drama, although it was based primarily in the medieval fantasy genre.

==Development history==
&quot;Arduin&quot; was one of the earliest challengers to TSR&#x27;s &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. It began in the mid-1970s as a personal project Hargrave created to share with friends, but became so popular that he was inspired to publish the material.

Hargrave was one of several early RPG players from the San Francisco Bay area to also become a game designer, having started by creating variant rules for his weekly &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; campaign. The setting of Arduin was heavily house-ruled and included hundreds of players and was situated in a neutral ground between nations that were once at war with each other. Greg Stafford of Chaosium played in the &quot;Arduin&quot; game run by Hargrave for a while around 1976, and he approached Hargrave to get the game system published as &quot;The Arduin Grimoire&quot;. Chaosium listed the resulting book on its publication schedule for February 1977 to be its first role-playing game product, but the company instead rejected the incomplete manuscript that Hargrave submitted. Hargrave self-published &quot;The Arduin Grimoire&quot; in 1977 and two follow-up &quot;Grimoire&quot; books in 1978, and the three books became what was known as &quot;The Arduin Trilogy&quot;. They are, in order, &quot;The Arduin Grimoire&quot; (1977), &quot;Welcome to Skull Tower&quot; (1978), and &quot;The Runes Of Doom&quot; (1978).

The &quot;Arduin&quot; books attempted to add many interesting and notable features to the fantasy role playing milieu. In addition to new rules, &quot;the Arduin Trilogy&quot; contained unique new spells and character classes, new monsters, new treasures, maps, storylines, extensive demonography, and all sorts of charts and lists which detailed the &quot;Arduin&quot; &quot;multiverse&quot;, many of which were new to role-playing gamers of the time.

Dave Hargrave appreciated the &quot;brilliant idea&quot; behind the original &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, but was dissatisfied with the rules and playability of the game and decided to come up with his own design for fantasy role playing rules. Although the &quot;Arduin&quot; books did not explicitly claim to be a &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; supplement, they were treated as such by most users. As follows, there was contention in the RPG world that the &quot;Arduin&quot; system lacked cohesion. It was only with the publication of the later book &quot;The Arduin Adventure&quot; (1981) that a true standalone system began to evolve, where other systems were not needed to adequately run a game. &quot;The Arduin Adventure&quot; was eventually written to replace use of the &quot;D&amp;D&quot; core book. Material from all of these were subsequently used as the basis for &quot;The Compleat Arduin&quot; (1992), a standalone system.

==Publication history==
The original &quot;Arduin&quot; suite of supplements, dungeon modules, and gaming aids were initially self-published (1977–78), but were then later produced by Grimoire Games. Dragon Tree Press produced four further &quot;Arduin&quot; supplements in the mid-1980s before the &quot;Arduin&quot; rights and properties were purchased by David Bukata and George De Rosa of Emperors Choice Games and Miniatures in 1998.

===Grimoire Games===
Grimoire Games was a publishing company run by Jim Mathis. Active from 1978 to mid 1981, Grimoire Games&#x27;s primary focus was the early Arduin series of RPG supplements, written by Hargrave. &quot;The Arduin Trilogy&quot; is the most famous of the Hargrave supplements.

Hargrave sold &quot;Arduin&quot; in 1978 to one of his players, Jim Mathis, who started Grimoire Games out of a UC campus apartment in Berkely to publish &quot;Arduin&quot; material by Hargrave beginning with a series of four adventure modules and two boxed sets. By the time &quot;The Arduin Adventure&quot; was published in 1981, the company was experiencing increasing financial challenges, and in 1984 its last publication for many years was 100 copies of the &quot;Arduin: A Primer&quot; booklet of revised rules; Mathis moved to San Diego and continued to sell products from the company for a few years. Hargrave continued to publish &quot;Arduin&quot; material through Dragon Tree Press until he died in 1988, at which point the rights to &quot;Arduin&quot; returned to Mathis and Grimoire Games.

Mathis worked with Mark Schynert to complete the last unfinished &quot;Arduin&quot; manuscript by Hargrave, and Grimoire Games eventually published it as &quot;The Compleat Arduin&quot; in 1993 with financial assistance from a games distributor; however the large work was expensive and outdated and only sold less than half of its print run, and the distributor took a loss, and it became the last publication by Grimoire Games.

===One-of-a-kind &quot;Arduin&quot; items===
Hargrave&#x27;s death in 1988 left many &quot;Arduin&quot; items press-ready but unpublished and/or incomplete. A few items he created on a whim for those he especially liked or was close to. Among these are the following:

;The Book of the Shining Land
:Created December/January, 1980-81. Dedication and signature inside front cover. This is a complete campaign area, designed as a generic adventure campaign suitable for insertion into any RPG, written by David for his longtime friend, writer Paul Mosher. &quot;The Book of the Shining Land&quot; comprises 118 handwritten pages of 10 × 7 quad ruled paper in a composition style notebook. It includes a Master Map of the area (approximately 100 miles square) and 59 &quot;keyed&quot; adventure area maps all cross-referenced off of the Master Map.

;The Book of Dreams of Lost Sardath
:Created October 1981. Similar in size and concept to &quot;The Book of the Shining Land&quot;, this work comprises 158 handwritten pages of 10 × 7 quad ruled paper in a composition style notebook. Includes a Master Map of an area approximately 100 miles square. This work was written by David for his longtime friend, writer Paul Mosher. It comprises a &quot;lost&quot; island kingdom containing 136 villages/towns/cities cross referenced on the Master Map as well as 79 adventure area maps, of which 31 are &quot;keyed&quot;.

;Lancer&#x27;s Rest
:Created October 1987. One of the last game-related items created by David A. Hargrave before his death in August 1988, &quot;Lancer&#x27;s Rest&quot; was Lance Mazmanian&#x27;s personal burial chamber, a very large single-level dungeon adventure which included an Arduin &quot;Hell Spiral&quot; and a pool where Mazmanian&#x27;s corpse was entombed. Created by Hargrave as a tongue-in-cheek tribute, the adventure itself was essentially a quest to gain life-prolonging treasure while avoiding Mazmanian&#x27;s wandering Avatar, an extremely powerful Lich-like entity who would either attack or help a party on random percentage roll.
Per Emperors Choice Games &amp; Miniatures Corp.: Lancers Rest has been fully developed and written and art completed in 2023 and is to be released with the new Arduin Bloody Arduin rules system in 2025.

==Reception==
In 2019, Goodreads carried a cumulative rating of 4.21 out of 5 for the first of the Arduin Trilogy publications, &quot;The Arduin Grimoire, Volume 1&quot;. The second Arduin volume, &quot;Welcome to Skull Tower,&quot; carried a 2019 rating of 4.08 of 5, and the final volume of the original Arduin trilogy, &quot;The Runes of Doom&quot;, a rating of 3.91.

In the April–May 1979 edition of &quot;White Dwarf&quot; magazine (Issue 12), Don Turnbull gave the just-published &quot;Trilogy&quot; a below average rating of only 4 out of 10, finding it disorganized, hard to read, and &quot;a mass of information, no doubt useless to some and useful to others.&quot; Turnbull concluded &quot;I could not advise anyone to buy &quot;The Grimoire&quot; from which to learn the fantasy game hobby from scratch, but if you want what is in effect a &quot;D&amp;D&quot; supplement, don&#x27;t mind the price and are prepared to be selective in what you extract from it, there will no doubt be useful snippets you could find.&quot;

In the Oct-Nov 1979 edition of &quot;Different Worlds&quot; (Issue 5), Mike Gunderloy admired the huge amount of supplementary information in the &quot;Arduin Trilogy&quot; that could be added to a &quot;D&amp;D&quot; campaign. But he admitted the trilogy was not perfect, especially &quot;the lack of organization. Rules relating to a single subject are often in different parts, even different volumes, of the trilogy. Worse, not only are there no cross-references to related sections, there is no index either.&quot; But Gunderloy concluded that any &quot;D&amp;D&quot; gamemaster looking to improve their campaign world needed the trilogy: &quot;No referee who has decided to expand his world should be without a copy of &quot;The Arduin Trilogy&quot;. Buy it, you&#x27;ll be amply rewarded in the form of ideas and enjoyment.&quot;

Lawrence Schick, in his 1991 book &quot;Heroic Worlds&quot;, described &quot;Arduin&quot; as a &quot;Fantasy system, derivative of &quot;Original D&amp;D&quot;. In fact, the first Arduin rulebooks were thinly-disguised supplement for &quot;D&amp;D&quot; – only later did Arduin grow into a stand-alone system. Arduin rules and scenarios are frequently unencumbered by the restraints of conventional good taste.&quot;

In his 2023 book &quot;Monsters, Aliens, and Holes in the Ground&quot;, RPG historian Stu Horvath noted, &quot;with the &quot;Arduin&quot; zines, Hargrave plants the first seeds of transgression in RPGs. The zines seem calculated to &quot;shock&quot;, in the same way that some lurid heavy metal album covers sought to fluster squares with cartoon skulls, demons, and blood. That whiff of the forbidden would stick to RPGs for years, and it might be &quot;Arduin&quot;″s greatest legacy.&quot;

==Controversy and criticism==

===The TSR legal issue===
In 1977, TSR objected to certain contents of the first Arduin book. David Hargrave negotiated with TSR about two points. First, Hargrave&#x27;s foreword made it appear as though he advocated people copying game books (such as D&amp;D) without buying them. Hargrave removed that foreword from later editions. Second, a Prismatic Wall spell in Arduin appeared to be plagiarized directly from D&amp;D; Hargrave changed some of the description, including some colors. Hargrave further distanced himself from controversy by using white-out and typing correction tape to mask all direct references to Dungeons and Dragons, and then the volumes were reprinted exactly that way. In some versions of the &quot;Arduin&quot; printings, these so-called &quot;corrections&quot; are clearly visible.

===&quot;Arduin&quot; mechanics===
Much criticism was made of Hargrave&#x27;s combat mechanics, to the point where many Game Masters simply used either their own versions, or those of TSR.

===Greg Stafford and Chaosium===
While David Hargrave was considered one of the &quot;best of the best&quot; of game masters, he was also known for having a somewhat volatile personality. The original role-playing community at large was split between love and mere tolerance of Hargrave&#x27;s passions, and his infamous falling-out with Greg Stafford, which resulted in Hargrave naming an &quot;Arduin&quot; spell after him as revenge, is one such example. The spell was called Stafford&#x27;s Star Bridge (&quot;The Arduin Grimoire&quot;, Volume 1, Page 41):

Hargrave felt that Stafford had betrayed him over a Chaosium publishing deal, thus &quot;falling through selectively&quot;. According to Stafford, Hargrave was later very upset with himself for having created this spell and for his behavior in the situation.

==Notable illustrators==

Several notable illustrators worked on &quot;Arduin&quot; materials at various times over the years, including the following:

;Erol Otus
:The first printings of &quot;The Arduin Grimoire&quot; (specifically, &quot;The Arduin Trilogy&quot;, Vol. 1) contained artwork by Erol Otus, an artist who would later become known for his illustrations appearing on and in TSR&#x27;s &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; publications.
:Otus&#x27; artwork was later removed from subsequent printings of &quot;The Arduin Grimoire&quot;.

;Greg Espinoza
:Greg Espinoza contributed many of the &quot;Arduin&quot; covers and interior illustrations (close to 80 pieces) from approximately 1978 to 1981. He drew many of the monster and artifact cards for several of the standalone dungeon modules, and also painted the box art (with airbrushing by Anthony Delgado) for Grimoire Games&#x27; &quot;The Arduin Adventure&quot;. Espinoza has created high-level work for decades via Blackthorne, TSR, Malibu, Eclipse, Antarctic Press, Tundra/Kitchen Sink Press, and Image Comics, among others. His Image Comics graphic novel &quot;Pug&quot; (with Derek McCulloch) was nominated for the 2011 Spinetingler Award, in the category of Best Crime Comic/Graphic Novel. In 2009, he was hired by Emperor&#x27;s Choice Games to create new cover art for a hardcover reprinting of the original Arduin Grimoire Trilogy.

;Brad Schenck
:Brad Schenck (also known as Morno) contributed the cover of &quot;Welcome to Skull Tower&quot; (&quot;AG II&quot;). His is also the original design for the &quot;Arduin&quot; &quot;Shield&quot; now featured by Emperor&#x27;s Choice Games and Miniatures as their trademark. He also did the cover for &quot;The Arduin Adventure&quot; rule book.

;Michio Okamura
:Michio Okamura was a regular contributor from the earliest volumes of the &quot;Arduin&quot; books, his distinct woodcut art style was featured on the cover of &quot;Dark Dreams&quot; (AG VI). Michio would later find employment at Blizzard North where he worked on &quot;Diablo&quot; and &quot;Diablo II&quot;.

<text>Maurilio Manara (; born 12 September 1945), known professionally as Milo Manara, is an Italian comic book writer and artist.

==Career==
After architecture and painting studies, he made his comics debut in 1969 drawing for &quot;Genius&quot;, a fumetti neri series of pocket books from publisher Furio Vanio in the wake of the popularity of &quot;Kriminal&quot; and &quot;Satanik&quot;. In 1970, he illustrated for the magazine &quot;Terror&quot;, and starting in 1971 drew the erotic series &quot;Jolanda de Almaviva&quot; written by Francisco Rubino, issued in small format by publisher Erregi. Joining the youth magazine &#x27;, he worked with Rubino, Carlo Barbieri, Mino Milani and Silverio Pisú. With Pisú Manara launched the publications &#x27; and &#x27; in 1974 and the series &#x27;, and with writer Mino Milani the series &quot;&quot; in 1975. Manara and Pisú later went on to publish &quot;Lo Scimmiotto&quot; (&quot;The Ape&quot;) along the story of the Chinese Monkey King in &quot;Alter Linus&quot; in 1976, and with Alfredo Castelli, &quot;L&#x27;Uomo delle Nevi&quot; (&quot;The Snowman&quot;) in 1978.

During this period Manara began publishing work in several Franco-Belgian comics magazines including &quot;Charlie Mensuel&quot;, &quot;Pilote&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;Écho des savanes&quot;. For &quot;(A SUIVRE)&quot; Manara created the first stories featuring &quot;HP and Giuseppe Bergman&quot;, which grew to become a large body of work. The character &quot;HP&quot; is based on Manara&#x27;s friend, the Italian comics creator Hugo Pratt, and a collaborator on some of Manara&#x27;s most acclaimed work, initially &#x27; (1983, &quot;Indian Summer&quot;) and later &quot;El Gaucho&quot; (1991). Manara also completed two stories working with another of his heroes, Federico Fellini. In his own right Manara has been commended on his skills as a writer, as with the western &#x27; (1982, &quot;The Paper Man&quot;).

Manara&#x27;s reputation for producing comics that revolve around elegant, beautiful women caught up in unlikely and fantastical erotic scenarios became solidified with work such as &#x27; (1983, also known as &quot;Click&quot; or &quot;Le Déclic&quot;), about a device which renders women helplessly aroused; &#x27; (1986, &quot;Butterscotch&quot;), introducing the heroine Miele (Honey) and a sweet-smelling body-paint which makes the wearer invisible; and &quot;Candid camera&quot; (1988, &quot;Hidden Camera&quot;), featuring the same protagonist in further explicit adventures. In the following years of combining sequels, original work, and collaborations with noted creators, Manara&#x27;s production continued in this direction to explore erotic comics themes with an artistic and storytelling expression in a manner considered unique to Manara.

In the U.S. &quot;The Ape&quot; was serialised in &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; in the early 1980s and Manara received some exposure through collaborations with Neil Gaiman and other artists.

===Later work===
In connection with their joint project &quot;Quarantasei&quot;, in July 2006, Manara designed a helmet for Moto GP rider Valentino Rossi, specifically made for the Italian GP in Mugello. Rossi declared:
In 2003, Manara&#x27;s work featured on the cover of Scottish rock band Biffy Clyro&#x27;s second studio album &quot;The Vertigo of Bliss&quot;. Manara also created the artwork for all the singles released from this album.

In October 2006, Manara developed character designs for the animated television series &quot;City Hunters&quot;. The series, consisting of ten 11-minute episodes, blends traditional animation techniques with modern CGI, to be broadcast across all of Latin America on the FOX network throughout 2006 and 2007.

Manara penciled an &quot;X-Men&quot; project written by Chris Claremont for Marvel Comics called &quot;X-Men: Ragazze in fuga&quot; that released in April 2009 in Italy, and was later reprinted in short circulation by Marvel Comics in English as &quot;X-Women&quot;.

He was profiled in the 2011 documentary film &quot;Derailments (Deragliamenti)&quot;.

In 2013 he started to do low print variant covers for issues of Marvel comic books. In 2014, Manara&#x27;s variant cover for Spider-Woman #1 was widely criticized for putting the character in a pose that was deemed over-sexualized and oddly proportioned by many. Defenders of Manara highlighted that this was a rare collector&#x27;s variant cover, reflective of his art style for those familiar with him. The piece later sold for over £37,000 at auction in 2020.

<doc id="314055" wikidata="Q155824" url="?curid=314055" title="Juscelino Kubitschek">
<text>Juscelino Kubitschek de Oliveira (; 12 September 1902 – 22 August 1976), also known by his initials JK, was a prominent Brazilian politician who served as the 21st president of Brazil from 1956 to 1961. Kubitschek&#x27;s government plan, dubbed &quot;50 years in 5&quot;, was centered on economic and social development. During his term the country experienced a period of notable economic growth and relative political stability. However, there was also a significant increase in external debt, inflation, income concentration and wage erosion. At the time, there was no re-election and, on 31 January 1961, he was succeeded by Jânio Quadros, supported by the UDN. Kubitschek is best known for the construction of Brazil&#x27;s new capital: Brasília, which was inaugurated on 21 April 1960, replacing Rio de Janeiro.

Kubitschek was born in Diamantina, Minas Gerais, in 1902. His father, João César de Oliveira, died when he was only two years old. JK completed the humanities course at the Diamantina Seminary and moved to Belo Horizonte in 1920. In 1927, he graduated in medicine from the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG), and in 1930 he specialized in urology in Paris. In December 1931, he married Sarah Lemos, with whom he had a daughter, Márcia, in 1943. The couple also adopted Maria Estela in 1947. In 1931, Kubitschek joined the Public Force of Minas Gerais as a doctor. During this period, he served on the Constitutionalist Revolution and became friends with politician Benedito Valadares who, upon being appointed federal intervenor in 1933, appointed Kubitschek as his chief of staff. In 1934, Kubitschek was elected federal deputy, but his term was revoked during the Estado Novo coup. With the loss of his term, Kubitschek returned to medicine. In 1940, he was appointed mayor of Belo Horizonte by Valadares, remaining in this position until October 1945. At the end of the same year he was elected constituent deputy for the Social Democratic Party (PSD). In 1950, he defeated Bias Fortes in the PSD caucuses to choose the party&#x27;s candidate for that year&#x27;s gubernatorial election in Minas Gerais. In the election, he defeated his brother-in-law Gabriel Passos and was sworn in as governor on 31 January 1951. As governor, he created the Companhia Energética de Minas Gerais, and also prioritized road building and industrialization.

In October 1954, Kubitschek launched his candidacy for the 1955 presidential election, which was made official in February 1955. He presented a developmentalist speech and used &quot;50 years in 5&quot; as his campaign slogan. In an alliance formed by six parties, his running mate was João Goulart. On 3 October, he was elected president of Brazil with 35.6% of the votes. The opposition tried to annul the election on the grounds that Kubitschek had not obtained an absolute majority of votes. However, general Henrique Teixeira Lott triggered a military movement to ensure Kubitschek&#x27;s inauguration. As president, Kubitschek was responsible for the construction of a new federal capital, Brasília, thus carrying out an old project to promote the development of Brazil&#x27;s interior and the country&#x27;s integration.

In 1961, Kubitschek was elected senator for Goiás and tried to make his candidacy for the 1965 presidential election viable. However, with the 1964 military coup, Kubitschek was accused by the military of corruption and being supported by the communists. As a result, his term was revoked and his political rights were suspended. From then on, Kubitschek began touring cities in the United States and Europe, in voluntary exile. In March 1967, he returned to Brazil and joined Carlos Lacerda and Goulart in organizing the &quot;Frente Ampla&quot;, in opposition to the military dictatorship. The &quot;Frente Ampla&quot; was extinguished by the military a year later, and Kubitschek went to prison for a short period. He intended to return to political life ten years after the suspension of his political rights. In October 1975, Kubitschek unsuccessfully ran for a seat at the Brazilian Academy of Letters. He occupied chair number 34 at the Minas Gerais Academy of Letters. Kubitschek died in a car accident on 22 August 1976. According to the forensic examination and official report at the time, the accident occurred as a result of a normal traffic fatality. The conclusion was contested by his family, who asked for the remains to be exhumed twenty years later, suspecting that Kubitschek had been the victim of a murder. The results of the examination confirmed the previous reports.

==Early life and career==

Kubitschek was born into a poor family in Diamantina, Minas Gerais. His father, João César de Oliveira (1872–1905), who died when Juscelino was two years old, was a traveling salesman. He was raised by his mother, a schoolteacher named Júlia Kubitschek (1873–1973). His mother was of part Czech and Roma descent. He was educated at a seminary school in Diamantina, where he was an average student.

Kubitschek attended the Federal University of Minas Gerais in Belo Horizonte when he turned twenty. He became a licensed medical doctor after seven years of schooling. He then went to live in Europe for a few months after graduating eventually returning to Brazil after the revolution of 1930 that marked the ascension of President Getúlio Vargas.

Kubitschek served as a doctor in the military police and saw patients at a military hospital in Minas Gerais. Kubitschek befriended the Governor of Minas Gerais, Benedito Valadares, who named Kubitschek his Chief of Staff in 1932. Two years later in 1934 Kubitschek ran for office for the first time, becoming a member of the Federal Chamber of Deputies of Brazil with the support of Partido Progressista (Progressive Party). In 1940, he was appointed Mayor of Belo Horizonte; in 1945, he was elected to the Chamber of Deputies with the support of Partido Social Democrático (Social Democratic Party) and was noted to be ambitious in his push to expand public works and improve infrastructure. It was in his term as Mayor of Belo Horizonte that he would establish a strong, professional relationship with the renowned architect Oscar Niemeyer, who would later become instrumental in designing Brasília. Kubitschek at this time commissioned Oscar Niemeyer to design several municipal buildings in Belo Horizonte.

He would run again for the Federal Chamber of Deputies in 1945, and in 1950 ran for Governor of the state of Minas Gerais. As Governor he was noted with focusing on addressing transportation and energy establishing a government energy corporation that built five new power plants, and he promoted improving roads, bridges, schools, and hospitals.

==Presidency==

After President Getúlio Vargas committed suicide in 1954, his Vice-President João Café Filho fulfilled the rest of his term until the elections of 1955 which were held in October. Juscelino Kubitschek decided to run for president in a race with two other candidates. He ran with the slogan of “fifty years progress in five” and developed a platform that highlighted energy, agriculture, industry, education, and transportation. He also stressed a wish to diversify Brazil’s economy and open it up to foreign investment. He was also a vocal supporter of moving the government capital out of Rio de Janeiro, to a more central location in the country, to promote regional development.

Before Kubitschek was even inaugurated, however, rumors of a military coup were brewing and the opposition party União Democrática Nacional (National Democratic Union or UDN) became vocal over his close ties to Vargas and his alleged sympathy towards communists. Henrique Teixeira Lott, then Minister of War, and a coalition of high ranking military officers staged a countercoup to ensure that Juscelino Kubitschek was inaugurated. Juscelino Kubitschek would be inaugurated as the 21st President of Brazil on 31 January 1956.

His economic plan had 31 goals distributed in six large categories: energy, transport, food, base industries, education, and the main goal, the construction of Brasília. This plan sought to diversify and expand the Brazilian economy, based on industrial expansion and integration of the national territory.

===Healthcare===
As a practicing doctor, Juscelino was passionate about reforming healthcare. Kubitschek campaigned on establishing a central health bureaucracy that previously did not exist to address rural health issues more adequately. The most notable is DNERU which was an agency created to address tuberculosis and malaria, and issue vaccines in areas of the country where access to healthcare was scarce.

===Economy and major works===

Although his main project was to develop national industry, it was with the &quot;Goals plan&quot;, launched in 1956, that there was a greater opening of the national economy for foreign investment. He made all imported machines and industrial equipment exempt from taxes, as well as to assist foreign capital. However, the exemption only applied if the foreign capital was associated with the national capital (&quot;associated capital&quot;). To amplify the internal market, he developed a generous credit policy.

He promoted the development of the automobile industry, naval industry, heavy industry and the construction of hydroelectric power stations. With the exception of the hydroelectric industry, Juscelino practically created an economy without state-owned companies. He also had a very progressive agenda proposed for Education; however, that was never carried out.

Kubitschek cared a great deal about the construction of transregional roads. He was criticised for focusing only in road construction and putting aside the railways, a decision still controversial today. The construction of the roads helped the integration of the Amazon region, together with the construction of Brasília.

In the short term the economy boomed, with a stronger industry under his leadership. More dependent on energy resources, Brazil became one of the countries most affected by the oil crises of 1973 and 1979. Having to import over 80% of its consumption, the quadrupling of oil prices greatly contributed to Brazil&#x27;s debts and spiralling inflation, for which his administration was directly blamed by the critics as a result. In fact, the economy continued to suffer well into the 1980s as Brazil&#x27;s industries became less and less competitive in the global market.

By the end of his term, the foreign debt had grown from 87 million dollars to 297 million dollars. Inflation and wealth inequality had grown larger, with rural-zone strikes that spread to the urban areas. However, the minimum wage from that time is still considered the highest at any moment in Brazilian history. He also initially sought a loan from International Monetary Fund, but backed out of the negotiations.

Kubitschek ended his time in office with a growth of 80% in industrial production but with an inflation rate of 43%.

===The construction of Brasília===
The idea of building a new capital in the center of the country was already idealised in the Brazilian constitutions of 1891, 1934 and 1946, but it was only in 1956 that planning began to take form in response to Kubitschek&#x27;s campaign promise to develop the interior. Initially the move of the capital from Rio de Janeiro was controversial and had division and opposition from people within Rio and throughout Brazil. Debates that included statesmen, residents and professionals were televised on the TV show &quot;Que será do Rio&quot; and letters to the editor in &quot;Correio da Manhã&quot;.

The work, led by urban planner Lúcio Costa, architect Oscar Niemeyer and landscape designer Roberto Burle Marx, started in February 1957. More than 200 machines were put to work and 30,000 workers came from every part of the country, though most from the northeast. The construction went on day and night to meet the objective of finishing Brasília by 21 April 1960, in a homage to the Inconfidência Mineira and Rome&#x27;s founding. A completely new capital city, its streets, government palaces, infrastructure, living facilities, etc., suddenly emerged in the middle of a savanna in just 41 months, and before the target date. As soon as it was inaugurated, Brasília was considered a masterpiece of urbanism and modern architecture.

Brasília plays a strategic role in integrating Brazil&#x27;s farthest regions, bringing development to unpopulated areas and guaranteeing Brazil&#x27;s cultural and territorial unity.

The construction of Brasília fostered the development of many roads, linking Brazil&#x27;s vast territories. One important example was the construction of the Belém–Brasília Highway. Previously, the only way to go from Rio or São Paulo to Belém was via ship on the Atlantic Ocean. During the Second World War, this weak link had been blocked by German U-boats, virtually disrupting all commerce.

The new capital was soon to help integrate all the Brazilian regions, create jobs and absorb a workforce from the Brazilian Northeast, and to stimulate the economy of the Central-west and North. During the construction of Brasília, in the haste to finish the job, accidents were frequent, something Kubitschek&#x27;s government did its utmost to cover up.

===Allegations of corruption===

Kubitschek&#x27;s government was often accused of corruption. The accusations began at the time he was governor and intensified during his presidency, when the construction of Brasília began. There were serious reasons to believe that people connected to Juscelino had been favored in the construction. Also, the airline Pan-Air Brazil held a monopoly on the transport of people and goods during this period, yet another source of controversy.

During his time in office, &quot;Time&quot; magazine wrote that he had the seventh greatest fortune in the world, a claim that was never proven. In fact, upon his death many years later, it was shown he had earned very modest means. This did not stop a candidate for the next presidency, Jânio Quadros, from stating during his presidential campaign that he would &quot;sweep the corruption out of the country&quot;. Later, during the military regime, Juscelino would be questioned about the corruption allegations and about his supposed ties with communist groups.

Kubitschek was succeeded by Jânio Quadros in 1961. After the military took power in 1964, Kubitschek&#x27;s political rights were suspended for 10 years. He went into self-imposed exile and stayed in numerous U.S. and European cities.

==Return to Brazil and death==

Kubitschek returned to Brazil in 1967, but died in a car crash in 1976, near the city of Resende in the state of Rio de Janeiro. 350,000 mourners were present at his burial in Brasília. He is now buried in the JK Memorial in Brasília, which was opened in 1981.

On 26 April 2000, the former governor of Rio de Janeiro, Leonel Brizola, alleged that the former presidents of Brazil, João Goulart and Kubitschek, who died a few months apart in 1976, were murdered as part of the US-backed Operation Condor, and requested the investigation of their deaths as part of the National Truth Commission investigations. They were originally reported to have died respectively of a heart attack and a car accident. On 27 March 2014, the commission concluded that Kubitschek was not assassinated.

==Honours==

The Presidente Juscelino Kubitschek International Airport of Brasília, the Juscelino Kubitschek bridge and Juscelino Kubitschek Power Plant are named after him. There is also a luxury hotel named Kubitschek Plaza located in that city.

Many cities have things named after him, such as Juscelino Kubitschek, Santa Maria. &quot;JK&quot; is a ubiquitous acronym honouring the ex-president, who is often seen by Brazilians as the &quot;father of modern Brazil&quot;.

<text>Lisa Lampanelli (born Lisa Marie Lampugnale; July 19, 1961) is an American former stand-up comedian, actress, and insult comic.

==Early life and journalism career==
Lampanelli was born in Trumbull, Connecticut, to a middle-class family. Three of her grandparents were of Italian descent, and the fourth of Polish ancestry. Her mother, Gloria (née Velgot), worked for the local police department, where &quot;she typed in all the arrests made&quot;, and her father, Leonard Lampugnale, worked for Sikorsky Aircraft and later became a painter. Lampanelli attended Roman Catholic schools, studied journalism at Boston College and Syracuse University, and attended the Radcliffe Publishing Course.

She worked as a copy editor at &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; and an assistant at &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. She was also a fact checker and the first chief of research for &quot;Spy&quot; magazine; a book about &quot;Spy&quot; describes her then as &quot;your average decked-out-heavy-metal-head-next-door.&quot; Speaking later to &quot;Maxim Magazine Online&quot;, Lampanelli remarked, &quot;I was a real journalist for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Spy&quot;, &quot;Hit Parader&quot;. I interviewed those fuckin&#x27; hair bands: Cinderella, Slaughter.&quot;

==Career==

===Comedy===
Lampanelli began her stand-up career in New York in the early 1990s. She had a break-out role at the 2002 New York Friars&#x27; Club roast of Chevy Chase, and went on to participate in the roasts of Denis Leary, Pamela Anderson, Jeff Foxworthy, Flavor Flav, William Shatner, David Hasselhoff, and Donald Trump and to serve as Roastmaster for Larry the Cable Guy. Lampanelli was frequently on the dais for &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; roasts, including appearances at the roasts for Gary Dell&#x27;Abate, Artie Lange, Andy Dick, and A&amp;E&#x27;s &quot;Gene Simmons Roast&quot; in April 2008.

Lampanelli released a comedy special on DVD entitled &quot;Take it Like A Man&quot; in 2005, appeared in the 2006 motion picture &quot;Larry the Cable Guy: Health Inspector&quot;, and had a cameo appearance in the VH1 sitcom &quot;So NoTORIous&quot;. She also landed a deal with Fox for a sitcom pilot with the tentative title &quot;Big Loud Lisa&quot;, which was considered a candidate for the network&#x27;s 2006–07 television season. Lampanelli taped her stand-up special &quot;Dirty Girl&quot; in the fall of 2006, which aired on Comedy Central on January 28, 2007. Her &quot;Dirty Girl&quot; CD and &quot;Dirty Girl—No Protection&quot; DVD were released by Warner Bros./Jack Records on January 30, 2007. Lampanelli was also featured in the movie &quot;Delta Farce&quot; starring Larry the Cable Guy, Bill Engvall, and D.J. Qualls, which was released early in 2008, and in &quot;Drillbit Taylor&quot; starring Owen Wilson.

Her style of humor was influenced most by the Dean Martin roasts that televised when she was growing up; she did not start watching other stand-up comedians until she became one herself.

On November 21, 2008, in Santa Rosa, California, Lampanelli taped her first one-hour HBO Special at the Wells Fargo Center for the Arts. The special, &quot;Lisa Lampanelli: Long Live the Queen&quot;, which aired January 31, 2009, was directed by Dave Higby, who also directed her &quot;Dirty Girl&quot; special. In December 2010 she reunited with Higby when he directed her &quot;Tough Love&quot; special for Comedy Central that aired in the spring of 2011. Her one-woman show, &quot;Bring Back the Fat Chick&quot;, debuted on Broadway in 2012.

In May 2012, she headlined at the Night of a Thousand Gowns, a huge charity gala in NYC, where she also filmed a cameo for Adam Barta&#x27;s new &quot;Q&amp;A&quot; music video.

Lampanelli&#x27;s album &quot;Back to the Drawing Board&quot; was nominated for Best Comedy Album at the 58th Annual Grammy Awards.

===Retirement from comedy===
Lampanelli underwent gastric-sleeve surgery in 2012, and lost over 100 pounds. She reported the change made her reevaluate many things in her life, she amicably divorced her husband, and introduced him to the woman he ultimately married.

Lampanelli also started to think that her insult comedy was being misunderstood by some, when she did not intend to be hurtful to anyone. On October 30, 2018, she announced her retirement from stand-up comedy on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; in order to become a life coach. She still does storytelling events, which she describes as &quot;heartfelt but funny,&quot; in which she talks about her journey with food and weight.

===&quot;The Celebrity Apprentice 5&quot;===

Lampanelli was a contestant on &quot;The Celebrity Apprentice 5&quot; (also known as &quot;The Apprentice 12&quot;). She was criticized by viewers and had numerous outbursts and clashes with other contestants, including Victoria Gotti, Arsenio Hall, Lou Ferrigno, and (particularly) Dayana Mendoza. Lampanelli refused to apologize for her treatment of other contestants and racist remarks about Hispanics. In spite of her behavior and relations with other contestants, she raised $130,000 for Gay Men&#x27;s Health Crisis winning two out of three of the challenges she took on as Project Manager. Lampanelli was fired on May 6, 2012, during the Final Four interview because John Rich and Marlee Matlin thought she was overly emotional.

==Books==
It Books (HarperCollins) is the publisher of Lampanelli&#x27;s memoir, &quot;Chocolate, Please: My Adventures in Food, Fat, and Freaks&quot; (2009). &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; reviewed:
==Personal life==
Lampanelli married in 1991 and divorced soon afterward. She married Jimmy Cannizzaro, a former tavern owner from Valley Stream, New York, on October 2, 2010, at the New York Friars&#x27; Club. In May 2014, she filed for divorce from Cannizzaro after three and a half years of marriage.

Lampanelli is a supporter of the LGBTQ+ community. When members of the Westboro Baptist Church planned to protest against a show she held on May 20, 2011, in Topeka, Kansas, she promised to donate $1,000 to Gay Men&#x27;s Health Crisis (the same charity she contributed to during &quot;The Celebrity Apprentice&quot;) for every protester that attended. After an initial count of 44 protesters, she rounded up the donation to an even $50,000, crediting the donation as being &quot;made possible by the WBC.&quot;

<doc id="314063" wikidata="Q3278527" url="?curid=314063" title="Portraits of Periodical Offering">
<text>The Portraits of Periodical Offering () were tributary documentative paintings (with illustration on each of the portrait) produced by various Chinese dynasties and later as well in other East Asian dynasties, such as Japan and Vietnam. These paintings were official historical documents by the imperial courts. The term &quot;&quot; roughly translates to &quot;duty offering pictorial&quot;. Throughout Chinese history, tributary states and tribes were required to send ambassadors to the imperial court periodically and pay tribute with valuable gifts (; &quot;gòngpǐn&quot;).

Drawings and paintings with short descriptions were used to record the expression of these ambassadors and to a lesser extent to show the cultural aspects of these ethnic groups. These historical descriptions beside the portrait became the equivalent of documents of diplomatic relations with each country. The drawings were reproduced in woodblock printing after the 9th century and distributed among the bureaucracy in albums. The &quot;Portraits of Periodical Offering of Imperial Qing&quot; by Xie Sui (), completed in 1751, gives verbal descriptions of outlying tribes as far as the island of Britain in Western Europe.

== Portraits of Periodical Offering of Liang (526–539 CE)==
The &quot;Portraits of Periodical Offering of Liang&quot; () was painted by the future Emperor Yuan of Liang, Xiao Yi (ruled 552–555 CE) of the Liang dynasty while he was a Governor of the province of Jingzhou as a young man between 526 and 539 CE, a post he held again between 547 and 552 CE, and had the opportunity to meet many foreigners. It is the earliest surviving of these specially significant paintings. They reflect foreign embassies that took place, particularly regarding the three Hephthalite (Hua) ambassadors, in 516–520 CE. The original of the work was lost, but three copies or derived works are known.

===Portraits of Periodical Offering of Liang (526–539 CE) (Song dynasty copy of the 11th century CE)===
A surviving edition of this work is a copy from the Song dynasty in the 11th century, the &quot;Song copy of the Portraits of Periodical Offering of Liang&quot; (), and is currently preserved at the National Museum of China. The original work consisted of at least twenty five portraits of ambassadors from their various countries. The copy from the Song dynasty has twelve portraits and descriptions of thirteen envoys; the envoy from Dangchang has no portrait. The work included individual descriptions, which follow closely the dynastic chronicle &quot;Liangshu&quot; (Volume 54).

The envoys from right to left were: the Hephthalites (), Persia (), Korea (), Kucha (), Japan (), Malaysia (), Qiang (), Yarkand (), Kabadiyan (), Kumedh (), Balkh (), and finally Merv ().

The remaining countries, now lost, are thought to have been: Gaojuli (Goguryeo), Yutian (Hotan in Xinjiang), Xinluo (Silla), Kepantuo (Tashkurgan in present-day Xinjiang), Wuxing fan (in Shanxi), Gaochang (Turpan), Tianmen Man (somewhere between Henan, Hubei, and Guizhou), Dan 蜑 Barbarians of Jianping (between Hubei and Sichuan), and Man 蠻 Barbarians of Linjiang (East Sichuan). There may also have been: Zhongtianzhu , Bei tianzhu (India), and Shiziguo (Sri Lanka), for a total of twenty-five countries.

====Individual portraits====
Some of the main portraits are:
===Tang dynasty &quot;The Gathering of Kings&quot; (circa 650 CE)===
A Tang period painting consisting in a version of the Liang portraits of Periodical Offerings, entitled &quot;The Gathering of Kings&quot; (, &quot;Wanghuitu&quot;). It was probably made by Yan Liben.

See the complete &quot;Wanghuitu&quot;.
====Individual portraits====
Some of the main portraits are:
=== Southern Tang &quot;Entrance of the Foreign Visitors&quot; (10th century CE)===
Emperor Yuan of Liang, Xiao Yi (552-555 CE) made another painting entitled &quot;Entrance of the Foreign Visitors&quot; (), now lost. A copy named &quot;Entrance of the Foreign Visitors of Emperor Yuan of Liang&quot; () was made by the painter Gu Deqian () of the Southern Tang dynasty (937–976 CE), native of Jiangsu.

From right to left, the countries are Lu (魯國) which is a reference to the Eastern Wei, Rouran (芮芮國), Tuyuhun (), Central India (), Western Wei (), Champa (), Sri Lanka (), Northern India (), Tashkurgan (), Wuxing City of the Chouchi (), Dangchang (), Langkasuka (), Dengzhi (), Persia (), Baekje (), Kucha (), Japan (), Yarkand (), Kabadiyan (), Kumedh (), Baiti (), Barbarians of Linjiang (), Goguryeo (), Gaochang (), Barbarians of Tianmen (天門蠻), Barbarians of Jianping (), Hephthalites (), Khotan (), Silla (), Kantoli (), Funan ().

==&quot;Portraits of Periodical Offering of Tang&quot; (Song dynasty copy, 11–13th century)==
The &quot;Portraits of Periodical Offering of Tang&quot; by painter Yan Liben, depicting foreign envoys with tribute bearers for the Tang dynasty arriving at Chang&#x27;an in 631, during the reign of the Emperor Taizong of Tang. The painting consists of 27 people from various states. The original work was lost, and the only surviving edition was a Song dynasty copy, which is currently preserved at the National Palace Museum in Taipei.

==&quot;Portraits of Offerings to the Imperial Qing&quot; (1759)==
In the mid-18th century during the Qing dynasty, the painter Xiesui () again painted a &quot;Portraits of Periodical Offering of the Imperial Qing&quot; (&quot;Huángqīng Zhígòngtú&quot; ), completed in 1759, with a second part added in 1765, showing various foreign people known at that time, with texts in Chinese and Manchu. See the complete Huangqing Zhigongtu.


==&quot;Ten Thousand Nations Coming to Pay Tribute&quot; (1761)==
&quot;Ten Thousand Nations Coming to Pay Tribute&quot; (, 1761) is a monumental (299x207cm) Qing dynasty painting depicting foreign delegations visiting the Qianlong Emperor in the Forbidden city in Beijing during the late 1750s.

The painting was intended to show the cosmopolitanism and the centrality of the Qing Empire, since most countries of Asia and Europe are shown paying their respects to the Chinese Emperor. The title literally refers to ten thousand countries (&quot;万国&quot;), but this simply has the meaning of an uncountable multitude.

<doc id="314068" wikidata="Q2657460" url="?curid=314068" title="History of Christianity in Ukraine">
<text>The history of Christianity in Ukraine dates back to the earliest centuries of the history of Christianity, to the Apostolic Age, with mission trips along the Black Sea and a legend of Andrew the Apostle even ascending the hills of Kiev. The first Christian community on territory of modern Ukraine is documented as early as the 4th century with the establishment of the Metropolitanate of Gothia, which was centered in the Crimean peninsula. However, on territory of the Old Rus in Kiev, Christianity became the dominant religion since its official acceptance in 989 by Vladimir the Great (Volodymyr the Great), who brought it from Byzantine Crimea and installed it as the state religion of medieval Kievan Rus (Ruthenia), with the metropolitan see in Kiev.

Although separated into various Christian denominations, most Ukrainian Christians share a common faith based on Eastern Christianity. This tradition is represented in Ukraine by the Byzantine Rite, the Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic churches, which have been at various historic times closely aligned with Ukrainian national self-identity and Byzantine culture.

Being officially eliminated since the end of World War II, the recent revival of Ukrainian national religions started just before dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1989 with reestablishment of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church which also triggered recovery of the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church movement out of diaspora and transition of the former Russian Orthodox Church clergy who were native Ukrainians. Today, there are three national Ukrainian churches: the Orthodox Church of Ukraine, the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, and the Ukrainian Orthodox Church. Additionally, there is a smaller number of Byzantine rite adherents in the Ruthenian Greek Catholic Church who were dominated by the Kingdom of Hungary in the past. Western Christian bodies including the Latin Church of the Catholic Church and several Protestant denominations have had a limited presence on the territory of Ukraine since at least the 16th century and represent a minority of Christians in the country.

== Early history ==

===Andrew the Apostle===

Andrew the apostle is believed to have travelled up the western shores of the Black Sea, to the area of present-day southern Ukraine, while preaching in the lands of Scythia. Legend (recorded in the Radziwiłł Chronicle) has it that he travelled further still, up the Dnieper River, until he came to the location of present-day Kiev in AD 55, where he erected a cross and prophesied the foundation of a great Christian city. Belief in the missionary visit of Andrew became widespread by the Middle Ages, and by 1621, a Kiev synod had declared him the &quot;Rus&#x27;-apostle&quot;. Titus, a disciple of Andrew, is also venerated in Ukrainian churches, as are three &quot;Scythian&quot; disciples, Saints Ina, Pina and Rima, who accompanied him to Kiev. Both the 18th-century Church of St Andrew and an earlier structure from 1086 it replaced were purportedly built on the very location of the apostle&#x27;s cross, planted on a hill overlooking the city of Kiev.

Although the Primary Chronicle refers to the apostle continuing his journey as far north as Novgorod, Andrew&#x27;s visit to any of these lands has not been proven, and in fact may have been a later invention designed to boost the autocephalic aspirations in the territories where the upper clergy continued to be dominated by Greeks for several centuries.

These first half-legendary Christian churches on the territory of present Ukraine were eliminated by the Gothic invasion in the third century. The head of the &quot;Scythian bishopric&quot; presented at the First Ecumenical Council in Nicaea in 325 probably in fact was Bishop Cadmus from the Bosporan Kingdom.

===Crimean roots===


Pope Clement I (ruled 88–98) was exiled to Chersonesos on the Crimean peninsula in 102, as was Pope Martin I in 655. Furthermore, it has been definitively recorded that a representative from the Black Sea area, the &quot;head of the Scythian bishopric&quot;, was present at the First Council of Nicaea in 325, as well as the First Council of Constantinople in 381; it has been surmised that this representative would have to have been Bishop Cadmus of the Bosporan Kingdom. Ostrogoths, who remained on present-day Ukrainian lands after the invasion of the Huns, established a metropolinate under the Bishop of Constantinople at Dorus in northern Crimea around the year 400. A bishop&#x27;s seat had also existed since 868 across the Strait of Kerch, in the ancient city of Tmutarakan. The Polans and the Antes cultures, located so close to the Crimea, surely became familiarized with Christianity by this time.

===Cyril and Methodius===
The relics of Pope Martin were allegedly retrieved by the &quot;Equal-to-apostles&quot; brothers Cyril and Methodius, who passed through present-day Ukraine on their way to preach to the Khazars. Sent from Constantinople at the request of the ruler of Great Moravia, these brothers would add to foundation of Christianity in Ukraine by creating the Glagolitic alphabet, a precursor to the eponymous &quot;Cyrillic script&quot;, which enabled the local population to worship God in Old Church Slavonic, a language closer to the vernacular Old East Slavic language than the Greek used to worship in Constantinople, or Latin in the west.

In response to local disputes with clerics of the Latin Church, Cyril and Methodius appealed in person to the Bishop of Rome in 867, bringing with them the relics of Pope Martin from Chersonesos. Their labors and request were met with approval, and their continued efforts planted the Christian faith into Ukrainian Rus. By 906, they had founded a diocese in Peremyshl, today a diocese of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church in Przemyśl, Poland. Their efforts, and those of their apostles, led to the translation of Christian Scriptures and service (liturgies) from Greek to Slavonic, and the eventual development of the modern Cyrillic alphabet.

==Early Rus&#x27; period==

By the 9th century, it is known that the Slavic population of western Ukraine (likely the White Croats) had accepted Christianity while under the rule of Great Moravia. However, it was the East Slavs who came to dominate most of the territory of present-day Ukraine, beginning with the rule of the Rus&#x27;, whose pantheon of gods had held a considerable following for over 600 years.

Following the 860 assault on Constantinople by Rus&#x27; forces under the command of Askold and Dir, the two princes were baptized in that holy city. Returning to Kiev, the two actively championed Christianity for a period of 20 years, until they were murdered by the pagan Prince Oleg in the inter-princely rivalry for the Kiev throne. Patriarch Photios purportedly provided a bishop and priests from Constantinople to help in the Christianization of the Slavs. By 900, a church was already established in Kiev, St. Elijah&#x27;s, modeled on a church of the same name in Constantinople. This gradual acceptance of Christianity is most notable in the Rus&#x27;-Byzantine Treaty of 945, which was signed by both &quot;baptized&quot; and unbaptized Rus&#x27;&quot;, according to the text included in the Primary Chronicle.

===Establishment of the Kiev Metropolitan===
Christianity acceptance among the Rus&#x27; nobility gained a vital proponent when Princess Olga, the ruler of Kiev, became baptized, taking the &quot;Christian name&quot; &quot;Helen&quot;. Her baptism in 955 (or 957) in either Kiev or Constantinople (accounts differ) was a turning point in religious life of Rus&#x27; but it was left to her grandson, Vladimir the Great, to make Kievan Rus a Christian state. Both Vladimir and Olga are venerated as the Equal-to-apostles saints by the Eastern Orthodox Church.

Princess Olga of Kiev shortly after her baptism appealed to the Holy Roman emperor Otto the Great to send missionaries into Kievan Rus. Adalbert, a Latin missionary bishop from Germany, was sent, but his missions and the priests who missionized along with him, were stopped. Most of the group of Latin missionaries were slain by pagan forces sent by Olga&#x27;s son, Prince Svyatoslav, who had taken the Crown from his mother.

Christianity became dominant in the territory with the mass Baptism of Kiev in the Dnieper River in 988 ordered by Vladimir. That year is considered as the year of establishment of the Kiev Metropolis and part of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. The exact date of establishment is not clearly known as the Kiev eparchy (metropolis) is mentioned as early as 891. The first cathedral temple, Church of the Tithes (Assumption of Virgin Mary), was built in 996.

Following the Great Schism in 1054, the Kievan Rus that incorporated some of the modern Ukraine ended up on the Eastern Orthodox Byzantine side of the divided Christian world. Early on, the Orthodox Christian metropolitans had their seat in Pereyaslav, and later in Kiev. The people of Kiev lost their Metropolitan to Vladimir-Suzdal in 1299 (who retained the title), but gained a new Metropolitan in Halych in 1303. The religious affairs were also ruled in part by a Metropolitan in Navahrudak, (present-day Belarus).

==After the breakup of the Kievan Rus==

In the 15th century, the primacy over the Ruthenian Orthodox Church was moved to Vilnius, under the title &quot;Metropolis of Kiev and all Rus&#x27;&quot;. One clause of the Union of Krevo stipulated that Jagiello would disseminate Catholicism among Orthodox subjects of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, of which Ukraine was a part. The opposition from the Ostrogskis and other Orthodox magnates led to this policy being suspended in the early 16th century.

Following the Union of Lublin, the Polonization of the Ukrainian church was accelerated. Unlike the Catholic Church, the Orthodox church in Ukraine was liable to various taxes and legal obligations. The building of new Orthodox churches was strongly discouraged. The Catholics were strictly forbidden to convert to Orthodoxy, and the marriages between Catholics and Orthodox were frowned upon. Orthodox subjects had been increasingly barred from high offices of state.

===Union of Brest and its aftermath===

In order to oppose such restrictions and to reverse cultural polonization of Orthodox bishops, the Ecumenical Patriarch encouraged the activity of the Orthodox urban communities called the &quot;brotherhoods&quot; &quot;(bratstvo)&quot;. In 1589 Hedeon Balaban, the bishop of Lviv, asked the Pope to take him under his protection, because he was exasperated by the struggle with urban communities and the Ecumenical Patriarch. He was followed by the bishops of Lutsk, Cholm, and Turov in 1590. In the following years, the bishops of Volodymyr-Volynskyy and Przemyśl and the Metropolitan of Kiev announced their secession from the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, which was increasingly influenced by the Ottomans. In 1595 some representatives of this group arrived to Rome and asked Pope Clement VIII to take them under his jurisdiction and unite them to the Apostolic See of Saint Peter.

In the Union of Brest of 1596 (colloquially known as &quot;unia&quot;), a part of the Ukrainian Church was accepted under the jurisdiction of the Roman Pope, becoming a Byzantine Rite Catholic Church, a Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, colloquially known as the Uniate Church. While the new church gained many faithful among the Ukrainians in Galicia, the majority of Ukrainians in the rest of the lands remained within Eastern Orthodoxy with the church affairs ruled by then from Kiev under the metropolitan Petro Mohyla. The Orthodox Church was made illegal (its legality was partially restored in 1607), its property confiscated, and Orthodox believers faced persecution and discrimination which became an important reason for large numbers of Ukrainians to emigrate to Tsardom of Russia following the Union. The eastward spread of the Union of Brest led to violent clashes, for example, assassination of the Greek Catholic Archbishop Josaphat Kuntsevych by the Orthodox mob in Vitebsk in 1623.

===Khmelnytsky Uprising===
As the &quot;unia&quot; continued its expansion into Ukraine, its unpopularity grew, particularly in the southern steppes where Dnieper Cossacks lived. The Cossacks, who valued their traditions and culture, saw the &quot;unia&quot; as a final step of Polonization. As a result, they reacted by becoming fierce proponents of Orthodoxy. Such feelings played a role in the mass uprising whose targets included all non-Orthodox religious proponents, the Catholic and Uniate clergy and Jews. During this time metropolitan Mogila took full advantage of the moment to restore the Orthodox domination in Ukraine, including returning one of its sacred buildings, the Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev.

==Rule of the Empires==
===Territories gained by Pereyaslav Rada===

In 1686, 40 years after Mogila&#x27;s death, the Ottomans, acting on the behalf of the regent of Russia Sophia Alekseyevna, pressured the Patriarch of Constantinople into transferring the Orthodox Church of Kiev and all Rus&#x27; from the jurisdiction of Constantinople to the Patriarch of Moscow, established a century prior to that. The legality of this step is occasionally questioned to this day along with the fact that the transfer was accompanied by graft and bribery, which in church affairs amounts to an ecclesiastical crime. The transfer itself, however, led to the significant Ukrainian domination of the Russian Orthodox Church, which continued well into the 18th century, Feofan Prokopovich, Epifany Slavinetsky, Stephen Yavorsky and Demetrius of Rostov being among the most notable representatives of this trend.

===Territories gained from Crimean Khanate===

In the late 18th century, the Crimean Khanate (Vassal for Ottoman Empire) was conquered by Russia, and the latter annexed most of the southern steppes and Crimea. Colonization of these lands was actively encouraged by Orthodox people, particularly Ukrainians, Russians and Serbs. As New Russia (Novorossiya, as it was then known) was settled, new Orthodox parishes were created. Construction of cathedrals that demonstrate some of the finest examples of late-19th-century Russian Architecture was undertaken in large cities such as Odesa and Sevastopol.

===Territories gained from partitions===

In the late 17th century Poland became less and less influential and internal corruption as well as the pressure from its powerful neighbors resulted in its partitions by neighbouring empires. The Russian Empire, in particular, gained most of ethnically Ukrainian land and all of the Belarusian lands. After nearly two centuries of polonization, the Uniate influence on the Ukrainian population was so great that hardly any remained Orthodox. Although some, particularly in Podolia, chose to revert to Orthodoxy soon after, this in many cases was an exception rather than trend and in locations where the Unia already gave deep roots into the population all of the church property remained in the Catholic and Uniate authority. Also significant was Empress Catherine II&#x27;s decree &quot;On the newly acquired territory&quot;, according to which most of the Polish magnates retained all their lands and property (thus a significant control over population) in the newly acquired lands.

Nevertheless, the first Russophile tendencies began to surface, and came in face of the Uniate Bishop Joseph Semashko. Believing that the Uniate Church&#x27;s role as an interim bridge between Orthodoxy and their eventual path to Catholicism is over, now that the ruler of the lands is no longer a Catholic, but an Orthodox Monarch, he began to push for an eventual reversion of all Uniates. Although the idea was shared by growing number of the lower priests, the ruling Uniate synod, controlled by the strong Polish influence, rejected all Semashko&#x27;s suggestions. In addition many of the Latin Church Catholic authorities responded to this by actively imposing Latin practice and hierarchy.

In 1831, the general discontent of the Poles with the Russian rule erupted into a revolt, now known as the November Uprising, which the Uniate Church officially supported. However, the uprising failed, and the Russian authorities were quick to respond to its organisers and areas of strongest support. The outcome was that the Uniate synod&#x27;s members were removed along with most of the Polish magnates privileges&#x27; and authority being taken away. With the Polish influence in the Ruthenian lands significantly reduced and in some cases eliminated, the Uniate Church began to disintegrate. In Volhynia the famous Pochayiv Lavra was returned to Russian Orthodox clergy in 1833. The final blow came from the Synod of Polotsk in 1839 headed by the ex-Uniate Bishop Semashko, where it was agreed to terminate the accords of Union of Brest and all of the remaining Uniate property on the territory of the Belarus and Right Bank Ukraine within the Russian Empire was incorporated into the Russian Orthodox Church. Those Uniate clergy who refused to join the Russian Orthodox Church (593 out of a total of 1,898 in Ukraine and Belarus) were exiled to the Russian interior or Siberia. By means of mass deportations, persecution and even executions the Uniates were practically eliminated in the Russian Empire. Only a small number of Greek Catholics in the Kholm Governorate managed to preserve their faith.

Within the Russian Empire, the Uniate Church continued to function until 1875, when the Eparchy of Chelm was abolished.The greater longevity of the Uniate Church in this region was attributed to the fact that it came under Russian control later than did the other territories (1809) and that, unlike other Ukrainian regions within the Russian Empire, it had been part of the Congress Poland, which had some autonomy until 1865. Within Chelm, the conversion to Orthodoxy met with strong resistance from the local ethnic Ukrainian priests and parishioners, and was accomplished largely through the efforts of Russian police, Cossacks, and immigrating Russophile priests from eastern Galicia. The resistance was strong enough that when, a generation later in 1905, the formally Eastern Orthodox population of Chelm was allowed to return to Catholicism (Russian authorities only allowing conversion to the Latin Church), 170,000 out of 450,000 did so by 1908.

===Austrian Galicia and World War I===
Although the Partitions of Poland awarded most of the Ruthenian lands to the Russian Empire, this excluded the southwestern Kingdom Of Galicia (constituting the modern Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk and parts of Ternopil oblasts), which fell under the control of the Habsburg monarchy and subsequently the Austrian Empire and the Austria-Hungary. Similarly to the situation in the lands of the Russian Empire, the Uniate Ruthenian (Ukrainian) peasantry was largely under the Polish Latin Catholic domination. The Austrians granted equal legal privileges to the Uniate Church and removed Polish influence. They also mandated that Uniate seminarians receive a formal higher education (previously, priests had been educated informally by other priests, usually their fathers, as the vocation was passed on within families), and organized institutions in Vienna and Lviv that would serve this function. This led to the appearance, for the first time, of a large educated social class within the Ukrainian population in Galicia. As a result, within Austrian Galicia over the next century the Uniate Church ceased being a puppet of foreign interests and became the primary cultural force within the Ukrainian community. Most independent native Ukrainian cultural trends (such as Rusynophilia, Russophilia and later Ukrainophilia) emerged from within the ranks of the Uniate Church. The participation of Uniate priests or their children in western Ukrainian cultural and political life was so great that western Ukrainians were accused of wanting to create a theocracy in western Ukraine by their Polish rivals.

During the 19th century there was a struggle within the Uniate Church (and therefore within the general Galician society due to its domination by priests) between Russophiles who desired union with Russia and Ukrainophiles who saw the Galician Ruthenians as Ukrainians, not Russians. The former group were mostly represented by older and more conservative elements of the priesthood, while the latter ideology was more popular among the younger priests. The Russophilia of the Galician Ruthenians was particularly strong during the mid-19th century, although by the end of that century the Russophiles had declined in importance relative to the Ukrainophiles. The Austrian authorities during this time began to be more and more involved in the power-struggle with Russia for the rule of the Balkans, as the declining Ottoman Empire withdrew, and in so doing opposed the Russophiles. The Balkans themselves were largely Orthodox and crucial to the Russian Panslavism movement. In this situation, the Galician Ruthenians found themselves in the pawn&#x27;s position.

When the power struggle erupted into the First World War, the Russian Army initially quickly overran Galicia (see Eastern Front (World War I)). Free of Polish domination, unlike in other areas of Ukraine the Uniate church had become closely linked to the Ukrainian people and the Ukrainian national movement. For this reason, the population in general were quite loyal to the Austrian Habsburgs, earning the nickname &quot;Tyroleans of the East&quot;, and resisted reunion into the Orthodox Church. A minority of them, however, welcomed the Russians and reverted to Orthodoxy. After regaining the lost territories with the counterattack in late 1914, the Austrian authorities responded with repressions: several thousand Orthodox and Russophilic people died while being interred at a Talerhof concentration camp for those deemed disloyal to Austria. Already a minority, the Russophiles were largely extinguished as a religious-cultural force in Galicia as a result of these actions.

==Twentieth and twenty-first centuries==

===Soviet Union===
After the Russian Revolution and the Russian Civil War the Bolsheviks seized power in the Russian Empire and transformed it into the Soviet Union. Religion in the new socialist society was assigned little value by the state, but in particular Russian Orthodox Church was distrusted because of its active support of the White Movement. Massive arrests and repressions began immediately. In the Ukrainian SSR (one of the founding republics of the USSR) as early as in December 1918 the first execution of the head of the Ukrainian Exarchate Metropolitan of Kiev and Halych took place. This was only the start which culminated in mass closing and destruction of churches (some standing since the days of the Kievan Rus) and executions of clergy and followers.

Ukraine was controlled by several short-lived yet independent governments which revived the Ukrainian national idea. Ukraine declared its political independence following the fall of the Provisional Government in 1918 and the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church was established.

Following the Soviet regime&#x27;s taking root in Ukraine and despite the ongoing Soviet-wide antireligious campaign, the Bolshevik authorities saw the national churches as a tool in their goal to suppress the Russian Orthodox Church always viewed with the great suspicion by the regime for its being the cornerstone of pre-revolutionary Russian Empire and the initially strong opposition the church took towards the regime change (the position of the patriarch Tikhon of Moscow was especially critical).

On November 11, 1921 , an unrecognised Church Council started in Kiev. The council would proclaim the first formation of the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church (UAOC). The Russian Orthodox Church strongly opposed the formation of the Ukrainian autocephaly and not a single ordained bishop was willing or able to ordain the hierarchy for a new church. Therefore, the clergy &quot;ordained&quot; its own hierarchy itself, a practice questionable under the canon law, in the &quot;Alexandrian&quot; manner - by laying on priests&#x27; hands on two senior candidates who became known as Metropolitan Vasyl (Lypkivsky) and Archbishop Nestor (Sharayivsky) (reportedly the relics of Clement of Rome who died in Ukraine in the 1st century were also used). Despite the canon law controversy, the new church was recognized in 1924 by the Ecumenical Patriarch Gregory VII.

In the wake of the Ukrainization policies carried out in Soviet Ukraine in the first decade of the Soviet rule many of the Orthodox clergy willfully joined the church thus avoiding the persecution suffered by many clergy members who remained inside the Russian Orthodox Church. During the period in which the Soviet government tolerated the renewed Ukrainian national church the UAOC gained a wide following particularly among the Ukrainian peasantry.

In the early-1930s the Soviet government abruptly reversed the policies in the national republics and mass arrests of UAOC&#x27;s hierarchy and clergy culminated in the liquidation of the church in 1930. Most of the surviving property was officially transferred to the ROC, with some churches closed for good and destroyed. On the eve of the Second World War only 3% of the pre-revolutionary parishes on the territory of Ukraine remained open to the public, often hidden in deep rural areas.

===Second Polish Republic===
The 1921 Peace of Riga treaty that ended the Polish-Soviet War gave the significant areas of the ethnically Ukrainian (and Belarusian) territories to the reborn Polish state. This included Polesie and Volhynia, areas with almost exclusively Orthodox population amongst the rural peasants, as well as the former Austrian province of Galicia with its Uniate population.

The Greek Catholic church, which functions in communion with the Latin Catholicism, could have hoped to receive a better treatment in Poland, whose leadership, especially the &quot;endecja&quot; party, saw the Catholicism as one of the main tools to unify the nation where non-Polish minority comprised over one third of the citizenry. Nevertheless, the Poles saw the Greek Catholic Galicia Ukrainians as even less reliable and loyal as the Orthodox Volhynia Ukrainians. Also, despite the communion with Rome, the UGCC attained a strong Ukrainian national character of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, and the Polish authorities sought to weaken it in various ways. In 1924, following a visit with the Ukrainian Catholic believers in North America and western Europe, the head of the UGCC was initially denied reentry to Lviv until after a considerable delay. Polish priests led by their bishops began to undertake missionary work among Eastern Catholic faithful, and the administrative restrictions were placed on the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church.

With respect to the Orthodox Ukrainian population in eastern Poland, the Polish government initially issued a decree defending the rights of the Orthodox minorities. In practice, this often failed, as the Catholics, also eager to strengthen their position, had stronger representation in the Sejm and the courts. During the Polish rule, 190 Orthodox churches were destroyed (although some of them have already been abandoned) and 150 were forcibly transformed into Catholic (not Ukrainian Catholic) churches. Such actions were condemned by the head of the Ukrainian Catholic Church, metropolitan Andrei Sheptytsky, who claimed that these acts would &quot;destroy in the souls of our non-united Orthodox brothers the very thought of any possibility of reunion.&quot;

In addition to persecution from the new authorities, the Orthodox clergy found itself with no ecclesiastical link to submit to. Like most ex-Russian Orthodox communities that ended up outside the USSR, and thus with no possible contact with the persecuted mother church, the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople agreed to take over Moscow Patriarchate&#x27;s role and in 1923 the Polish Orthodox Church was formed out of the parishes that were on the territory of the Polish republic although 90% of its clergy and believers were non-Polish people.

===Czechoslovakia===
The redrawal of national boundaries following World War I also affected yet another ethnically Ruthenian territory. In 1920, the country of Czechoslovakia was formed, the nation included several minorities. In the easternmost end of the country, Transcarpathia lived the Rusyn population. For most of their history they were ruled by the Hungarians, who unlike the Austrians ruling Galicia were quite active in opposing Ukrainophile sentiments. Instead, the Hungarians supported a Rusyn identity (separate from either a pro-Ukrainian or pro-Russian orientation) through pro-Hungarian priests in an effort to separate the Ruthenian people under their rule from their brethren across the mountains. Thus despite being Uniate at the time of the formation of Czechoslovakia, the population was about evenly divided between Rusynophile, Ukrainophile and Russophile orientation. The general Russophilic sentiment was very strong amongst them, and these cultural and political orientations impacted the local religious communities. Even before the first world war already quite a lot of distant mountain communities were de facto Orthodox, where priests simply ceased to follow the Uniate canons. However, much more significant changes took place in the interwar period.

In the 1920s many Russian emigres, particularly Orthodox clergy, settled in Serbia. Loyal to the Orthodox state, they became actively involved in missionary work in central Europe. A group, headed by Bishop Dosifei went to Transcarpathia. Because of the historical links between the local Greek Catholic clergy to the disliked Hungarian authorities, mass conversions to the Orthodox Church occurred. By the start of the Second World War, approximately one third of all of the Rusyn population reverted to Orthodoxy . The region&#x27;s local Hungarian population, estimated at slightly less than 20% of the population, remained overwhelmingly Calvinist or Catholic. (For the Ruthenian population left outside Ukraine in 1945 (today Prešov territory in Slovakia) see Czech and Slovak Orthodox Church).

===Second World War===

On September 17, 1939, with Poland crumbling under the German attack that started the Second World War, the Red Army attacked Poland, assigning territories with an ethnic Ukrainian majority to Soviet Ukraine. Because the Ukrainians were by-and-large discontented with Polish rule most of the Orthodox clergy actually welcomed the Soviet troops.

The addition of the ethnic Ukrainian territory of Volhynia to the USSR created several issues. Having avoided the Bolshevik repression, the Orthodox church of this rural region outnumbered the rest of the Ukrainian SSR by nearly a thousand churches and clergy as well as many cloisters including the Pochayiv Lavra. The ecclesiastical link with the Moscow Patriarchate was immediately restored. Within months nearly a million Orthodox pilgrims, from all over the country, fearing that these reclaimed western parishes would share the fate of others in the USSR, took the chance to visit them. However, the Soviet authorities, although confiscating some of the public property, did not show the repressions of the post-revolutionary period that many expected and no executions or physical destruction took place.

On October 8, 1942, Archbishop Nikanor and Bishop Mstyslav (later a Patriarch) of the UAOC and Metropolitan Oleksiy (Hromadsky) of the Ukrainian Autonomous Orthodox Church concluded an Act of Union, uniting the two national churches at the Pochayiv Lavra. Later German occupation authorities and pro-Russian hierarchs of the Autonomous Church convinced Metropolitan Oleksiy to remove his signature. Metropolitan Oleksiy was murdered in Volhynia on May 7, 1943, by the nationalists of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army which saw this as treason.

===Post-war situations===

The Russian Orthodox Church regained its general monopoly in the Ukrainian SSR after World War II following another shift in the official Soviet attitude towards Christian churches. As a result, many started to accuse it of being a puppet of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. After the suspicious death of Patriarch Tikhon, the UAOC and UGCC sought to avoid the transfer under the Moscow Patriarchate; something that Moscow tolerated until after World War II, for example the head of the Ukrainian Communist Party, Nikita Khrushchev attended the funeral of the head of the Uniate Church in 1946. Nevertheless, as the Uniate Church did in some cases support the Nazi regime, the overall Soviet attitude was negative. In 1948 a small group of priests started to proclaim a reunion with Orthodoxy. The Soviet state organized in 1948 a synod in Lviv, where the 1596 Union of Brest was annulled, thereby breaking the canonical ties with Rome and transferring under the Moscow Patriarchate. In Transcarpathia, the reigning Greek Catholic bishop, Theodore Romzha, was murdered and the remaining priests were forced to return their Church to Orthodoxy. This move&#x27;s acceptance was mixed. With many clergy members and lay believers turning to the ROC, some adamantly refused. As a result of this the Patriarchate of Moscow could now legally lay claim to any Orthodox church property that was within the territory of its uncontested jurisdiction, which it did. Some believers refused to accept liquidation of their churches and for nearly 40 years the UAOC and UGCC existed in Western Ukraine underground led by the clergy members under the threat of prosecution by the Soviet state. Much of the UGCC and UAOC clergy not willing to serve in the ROC emigrated to Germany, the United States, or Canada. Others were sent to Siberia and even chose to be martyred. Officially the Moscow Patriarchate never recognised the canonical right of the synod as it lacked any bishops there.

The relatively permissive post-war government attitude towards the Orthodox Church came to an end with Khrushchev&#x27;s &quot;Thaw&quot; programme, which included closing the recently opened Kiev&#x27;s Caves Lavra. However, in the west-Ukrainian dioceses, which were the largest in the USSR, the Soviet attitude was &quot;softest&quot;. In fact in the western city of Lviv, only one church was closed. The Moscow Patriarchate also relaxed its canons on the clergy, especially those from the former-uniate territories, allowing them, for example to shave beards (a very uncommon Orthodox practice) and conduct eulogy in Ukrainian instead of Church Slavonic.

===Late Soviet period===
In 1988 with the millennium anniversary of the baptism of Rus, there was yet another shift in the Soviet attitude towards religion, coinciding with the Perestroika and Glasnost programmes. The Soviet Government publicly apologized for oppression of religion and promised to return all property to the rightful owners. As a result, thousands of closed religious buildings in all areas of the USSR were returned to their original owners. In Ukraine this was the then ROC&#x27;s Ukrainian Exarchate, which took place in the central, eastern and southern Ukraine. In the former-uniate areas of western Ukraine things were more turbulent. As UGCC survived in diaspora and in the underground they took their chance and were immediately revived in Ukraine, where in the wake of general liberalization of the Soviet policies in the late-1980s the activization of Ukrainian national political movements was also prompted. The Russian Orthodox Church became viewed by some as an attribute of Soviet domination, and bitter, often violent clashes over church buildings followed with the ROC slowly losing its parishes to the UGCC.

The UAOC also followed suit. Sometimes possessors of Church buildings changed several times within days. Although the Soviet law-enforcement did attempt to pacify the almost-warring parties, these were often unsuccessful, as many of the local branches in the ever-crumbling Soviet authority sympathised with the national sentiments in their areas. Violence grew especially after the UGCC&#x27;s demand that all property that was held prior to 1939 would be returned.

It is now believed that the only real event which helped to contain the growing schism in the former-uniate territories was the ROC&#x27;s reaction of raising its Ukrainian Exarchate to the status of an autonomous church, which took place in 1990, and up until the break up of the USSR in late 1991 there was an uneasy peace in western Ukraine. After the nation became independent, the question of an independent and an autocephalous Orthodox Church arose once again.

===Post-Soviet period===

In November 1991, Filaret, the Metropolitan of Kyiv, asked the hierarchy of the Russian Orthodox Church to grant the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC) autocephalous status. The skeptical hierarchy of the Russian Orthodox Church called for a full Synodical council (Sobor) where this issue would have been discussed at length. Filaret, using his support from the old friendship-ties with the then newly elected President of Ukraine (Leonid Kravchuk), convinced Kravchuk that a new independent government should have its own independent church.

In January 1992 Filaret convened an assembly at the Kiev Pechersk Lavra that adopted a request of autocephaly for Ukrainians, addressed to the Moscow Patriarch.

Upon returning to Kyiv from a Russian Orthodox Church synod meeting, Filaret carried out his reserve option: he revealed that his resignation from the position of Primate of the UOC had taken place under pressure and that he would not resign. The Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk gave Filaret his support, as did the Ukrainian nationalist paramilitaries, in retaining his rank. In a crisis moment the Hierarchical Council of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church agreed to another synod which met in May 1992. The council convened in the eastern city of Kharkiv, where the majority of the bishops voted to suspend Filaret from his clerical functioning. Simultaneously they elected a new leader, Metropolitan Volodymyr (Viktor Sabodan), native of the Khmelnytskyi Oblast and a former Patriarchal Exarch to Western Europe.

With only three bishops giving him support, Filaret initiated unification with the UAOC, and in June 1992 established a new Ukrainian Orthodox Church - Kyiv Patriarchate (UOC-KP) with 94-year-old Patriarch Mstyslav of the UAOC as a leader. While chosen as Mstyslav&#x27;s assistant, Filaret &quot;de facto&quot; ruled the new Church. A few of the Autocephalous bishops and clergy who opposed such situation refused to join the new church, even after the death of Mstyslav in June 1993. The church was once again ripped apart by a schism and most of the UAOC parishes were regained when the churches re-separated in July 1993.

Most of the fate of control of church buildings was decided by the church parishes, but as most refused to follow Filaret, paramilitaries, especially in Volyn and Rivne Oblasts where there was strong nationalist sympathy amongst the new regional authorities, carried out raids bringing property under their control. The lack of parishes in eastern and southern Ukraine prompted President Kravchuk to intervene and to force buildings still closed from the Communist era to re-open under the UOC-KP&#x27;s ownership. Upon the 1994 election of Leonid Kuchma as President of Ukraine, most of the violence was promptly stopped, and the presidency adopted a &quot;de facto&quot; neutrality attitude to all the four major church groups.

===Modern times===

The recent events of the 2004 Ukrainian presidential election and the Orange Revolution affected the religious affairs in the nation as well. Members of the UOC (MP) actively supported the former Prime minister Viktor Yanukovych while members of the UOC-KP, UAOC, and UGCC supported the opposition candidate Viktor Yushchenko, who was running against him. After Yushchenko&#x27;s victory, the UOC (MP) criticised him for what they see as support of the &quot;uncanonical organisations&quot;, such as his celebrating Orthodox Christmas in St Volodymyr&#x27;s Cathedral (owned by UOC-KP). Yushchenko himself has publicly pledged to distance himself from Orthodox politics during his presidential campaign. Nonetheless, he claims that his intention is to achieve a unity of the nation&#x27;s Eastern Orthodox Church affairs. Questions still arise on what will be the ecclesiastical status of the Church and who will head it, and as of February 2007 no public dialogue has begun.

To date the issue between rivalries of different churches remains politicised and sensitive and also controversial. In a 2007 survey 33.3% felt satisfied with the current condition of several Orthodox Churches. At the same time up to 42.1% felt it would be important for a single united church, with 30.7% favoring the UOC-KP and 11.4% the UOC (MP). On the question of who shall head the church the political polarisation of the country surfaced - 56.1% of voters of Our Ukraine and 40.7% of voters from the Bloc Yulia Tymoshenko endorsed wanting one Orthodox Church under the Kyiv Patriarchate.

On 15 December 2018, members of the existing Ukrainian Orthodox churches (the UOC-KP, the UAOC and two bishops who had left the UOC) voted through their representatives (bishops) to unite into the Orthodox Church of Ukraine on the basis of complete canonical independence. They elected their primate and adopted a charter for the Orthodox Church of Ukraine.

Metropolitan Epiphanius of the UOC-KP, who had been chosen on 13 December by the UOC-KP as its only candidate, and was considered as Filaret&#x27;s right arm and protégé, was elected Metropolitan of Kyiv and all Ukraine by the unification council on 15 December 2018 after the second round of voting.

On 1 January 2019, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew confirmed his intention to grant the tomos of autocephaly to Metropolitan Epiphany on 6 January 2019, the day of Christmas Eve according to the old Julian calendar.

On 5 January 2019, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew and Metropolitan Epiphanius celebrated a Divine Liturgy in St. George&#x27;s Cathedral in Istanbul; the tomos was signed thereafter, also in St. George&#x27;s Cathedral.

The &quot;tomos&quot; &quot;has come into force from the moment of its signing&quot;. The signing of the &quot;tomos&quot; officially established the autocephalous Orthodox Church of Ukraine. President Poroshenko traveled to Istanbul to attend the signing ceremony.

After the &quot;tomos&quot; was signed, Ecumenical Patriarch Batholomew made an address to Metropolitan Epiphanius. President Poroshenko and Metropolitan Epiphanius also made speeches. On 6 January, after a Liturgy celebrated by Metropolitan Epiphanius and Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew read the &quot;tomos&quot; of the OCU and then gave it to Metropolitan Epiphanius. President Poroshenko was present during the signing and handing over of the tomos.

On 9 January 2019, the tomos was brought back to Istanbul so that all the members of the Holy Synod of the Ecumenical Patriarchate could sign the tomos. The tomos has now been fully ratified, and will be returned again to Kyiv where it will remain permanently. The representative of the press service of the OCU, priest Ivan Sydor, said the tomos was valid after the signature of the Ecumenical Patriarch, &quot;but according to the procedure, there must also be the signatures of those bishops who take part in the synod of the Constantinople Patriarchate.&quot; Former press secretary of the UOC-KP, , declared the Ecumenical Patriarch recognized the OCU by signing the tomos of autocephaly and by concelebrating the liturgy with Epiphanius while considering Epiphanius as primate of the OCU. The Ecumenical Patriarchate declared on 8 January 2018 that the tomos was &quot;approved and valid&quot; and that the signing by the whole synod was a &quot;purely technical step&quot;. It added that Ukraine had asked for the tomos to be brought to Ukraine for Christmas instead of leaving it in Istanbul for a few days until the whole synod signed it.

== Main religious groups ==
The main religious groups are presented below:

===Eastern Orthodox===

====Orthodox Church of Ukraine====
Abbreviated as the OCU, the church was established by a unification council on 15 December 2018, and received its of autocephaly (decree of ecclesial independence) by Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople on 5 January 2019. The council voted to unite the existing Ukrainian Orthodox jurisdictions: the Ukrainian Orthodox Church – Kyiv Patriarchate (UOC-KP), the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church (UAOC) and two bishops of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC).

The primate of the church is the Metropolitan of Kyiv and all Ukraine. The unification council elected Epiphanius Dumenko as its primate, previously the Metropolitan of Pereiaslav-Khmelnytskyi and Bila Tserkva (UOC-KP) in 2018.

Orthodox Ukrainians of the diaspora are subject to the jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople.

====Ukrainian Orthodox Church====

The Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC), operates as an autonomous church that was formerly part of the Moscow Patriarchate until declaring its full independence in 2022. The head of the church is Metropolitan Onufriy who was enthroned in August 2014 as the &quot;Metropolitan of Kyiv and all Ukraine&quot;. The UOC claims to be the largest religious body in Ukraine with the greatest number of parish churches and communities counting up to half of the total in Ukraine and totaling over 10 thousand. As of 2007, the UOC also claimed to have up to 75% of the Ukrainian population. Independent survey results, however, show significant variance, as many Orthodox Ukrainians do not clearly self-identify with a particular jurisdiction and, sometimes, are even unaware of the affiliation of the church they attend or the existence of the controversy itself. This makes it difficult to use survey numbers as an indicator of the relative strength of any given Church. Also, the geographical factor plays a major role in the number of adherents, as the Ukrainian population tends to be more churchgoing in the western part of the country rather than in the UOC&#x27;s heartland in southern and eastern Ukraine.

Statistics on the number of parishes may be more reliable and consistent, even though they may not necessarily directly translate into the numbers of adherents. By number of parishes and quantity of church buildings, the UOC&#x27;s strong base is central and north-western Ukraine. However, percentage wise (with respect to rival Orthodox Churches) its share of parishes there varies from 60 to 70 percent. At the same time, by percentage alone (with respect to rival Orthodox Churches) the UOC&#x27;s share of church buildings peaks in the urban russophone southern and eastern Ukrainian provinces, being as high as 90%. The same can be said about Transcarpathia, although there the UOC&#x27;s main rival is the Greek Catholic Church and thus its share of &quot;total&quot; church buildings is only 40%. The capital Kyiv is where the greatest Orthodox rivalry takes place, with the UOC holding about half of the Orthodox communities there. The only places where the UOC is a true minority, in both quantity, percentage and support are the former Galician provinces of Western Ukraine. There the total share of parishes does not exceed more than five percent.

On 27 May 2022, the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC) formally cut ties and declared independence from the Russian Orthodox Church. Upon declaring its independence from the Moscow Patriarchate, the UOC began creating new parishes in Western Europe to serve Ukrainian refugees. By the end of 2022, 32 such parishes had been organized, and Bishop Veniamin (Voloshchuk) of Boyar was appointed to oversee the new diaspora parishes. One UOC parish exists in North America and predates the war: Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary, in Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada.

====Old Believers====
Traditionally the Ukrainian clergy, following the annexation of Kyivan Metropolia, were one of the main sources of opposition to the Old Believer schism which took place at the time, under Patriarch Nikon. None of the Ukrainian parishes followed the Russian Orthodox Old-Rite Church. Although in 1905 the Tsar&#x27;s decree on freedom of religion allowed the Old Believers church to reform, it gained little support in Ukraine. Presently, however the Old Believer community very much exploited the politicised schism in Ukrainian Orthodoxy and, as of 2004, number 53 communities scattered throughout Ukraine, with one of the biggest in Vylkove.

===Catholic Church===
====Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church====


Abbreviated as the UGCC, and originally formed from the Union of Brest in 1596, the Church was outlawed by the Soviet government in 1948 but continued to exist in the Ukrainian underground and in the Western Ukrainian diaspora. It was officially re-established in Ukraine in 1989. In 1991, Cardinal Lubachivsky returned to Lviv from emigration. Since 2011 UGCC has been headed by Major Archbishop Sviatoslav Shevchuk.

Currently the Ukrainian Greek Catholic church has 3317 parishes which makes it the third largest denomination in Ukraine. Geographically, the Church&#x27;s parishes were previously confined to the Western provinces of Lviv, Ternopil and Ivano-Frankivsk, where it has the most parishes of any Church and where its share of parishes ranges from 47% to 64%. The UGCC is also found in the neighboring Lemko areas in Poland. Numerous surveys conducted since the late 1990s consistently show that between 6% and 8% of Ukraine&#x27;s population, or 9.4% to 12.6% of religious believers, identify themselves as belonging to this Church. In addition, the church has mass parishes abroad in the North American continent, South America, and Australia.

In recent times parishes have been established in many Eastern Ukrainian cities such as Kharkiv, Donetsk, in the south in Odesa and Yalta and also in Russia. with parishes being set up in Moscow, Novosibirsk, Ufa, Cheliabinsk, Tomsk, and other cities. These parishes have been formed primarily by resettled Ukrainians from Western Ukraine.

One of the largest religious controversies in Ukraine recently involved having the almost exclusively western Ukraine-based UGCC move its administrative centre from Lviv to Kyiv whilst its new cathedral&#x27;s construction was sponsored by the first lady, Kateryna Yushchenko-Chumachenko. This move was criticised not only by the UOC(MP), but also by the whole Eastern Orthodox Communion.

====Latin Church====
The Latin Church in Ukraine is predominantly populated by non-Ukrainian minorities, in particular Poles and Hungarians. Originally holding a large number of parishes, most of the churches remained empty after World War II, which is attributed to the fact that much of the Polish population (once a significant minority, especially in the west of modern-day Ukraine) was killed in the war and the interethnic violence that occurred during the war as well as being subject to forcible evacuations and deportations.

After the restoration of Soviet power in Western Ukraine since 1944, many Catholic churches and monasteries were compulsorily closed and clergy persecuted.

In 1991, Pope John Paul II officially restored the activities of Catholic Dioceses in Ukraine and appointed bishops.
Currently the Catholic Church in Ukraine has 807 parishes in 713 churches.

====Ruthenian Greek Catholic Church====

Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the Byzantine rite Catholic church in Transcarpathia emerged from the underground and was restored as a separate entity from the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church based in Galicia, namely the Ruthenian Catholic Church. This was done despite the protests by a portion of the Church members led by the bishop of Khust who demanded to be integrated into the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church. Despite this revival, unlike its sister Church in Galicia, the Ruthenian Byzantine rite Catholic Church has not regained its pre-war position as the dominant Church in Transcarpathia. It currently has about 23% of Transcarpathia&#x27;s parishes, slightly less than 60% of the Orthodox total there. Its traditional base is the Rusyn (Ruthenian) ethnic minority in Transcarpathia.

=== Protestantism ===
In the 16th century small groups of Anabaptists appeared in Volodymyr-Volynskyi, but the influence of the Reformation in Ukraine remained marginal until three centuries later.

Protestantism arrived to Ukraine together with German immigrants in the 18th and 19th centuries. They were initially granted religious freedom by the Russian Imperial authorities, unlike the native population. While some were Catholic, the majority were either Evangelical (in North America known as Lutheran) or Mennonite (Anabaptist). Of the 200,000 or so Germans in Volhynia c.1900, some 90% or so were Lutheran. Lutheranism went into a major decline with the emigration of most of the Germans out of the region during the World Wars but there are still small remnants today (2006) in the Odesa and Kyiv regions.

One of earliest Protestant groups in Ukraine were Stundists (the name originated from the German &quot;Stunde&quot;, &quot;hour&quot;) German Evangelical sect that spread from German villages in Bessarabia and Ekaterinoslav province to the neighbouring Ukrainian population. Protestantism in Ukraine rapidly grew during the liberal reforms of Alexander II in the 1860s. However, towards the end of the century authorities started to restrict Protestant proselytism of the Orthodox Christians, especially by the Stundists, routinely preventing prayer meetings and other activities. At the same time Baptists, another major Protestant group that was growing in Ukraine, were treated less harshly due to their powerful international connections.

In the early 20th century, Volyn became the main centre of the spread of Protestantism in Ukraine. During the Soviet period Protestantism, together with Orthodox Christianity, was persecuted in Ukraine, but the 1980s marked the start of another major expansion of Protestant proselytism in Ukraine.

Today the largest Protestant groups in Ukraine include Baptists (All-Ukrainian Union of the Association of Evangelical Baptists), Pentecostals (All-Ukrainian Union of Christians of the Evangelical Faith-Pentecostals), Seventh-day Adventists (Ukrainian Union Conference of Seventh-day Adventists) and a growing number of charismatic churches. Of note is the Hillsong Church in Kyiv. One of the most prominent Protestants in modern Ukraine is a practising Baptist pastor Oleksandr Turchynov, former head of the SBU, Ukraine&#x27;s successor to the KGB. Despite recent rapid growth, Protestants in Ukraine still remain a small minority in a largely Orthodox Christian country.

<text>The Ford Windstar (later the Ford Freestar and Mercury Monterey) is a minivan that was produced and sold by Ford. The replacement for the Ford Aerostar, the Windstar adopted the front-wheel drive configuration of the Chrysler minivans. From the 1995 to 2007 model years, three generations of the model line were sold, with the final generation renamed as the Ford Freestar.

Unrelated to the Nissan-developed Mercury Villager, the Windstar was marketed without a Lincoln-Mercury counterpart. As part of the 2004 launch of the Ford Freestar, Mercury introduced its first Ford-produced minivan in a revival of the Mercury Monterey nameplate.

Following a decline in sales across the minivan segment in the mid-2000s, the Freestar and Monterey were discontinued after the 2007 model year with no direct replacement. In North America, the model line was functionally matched by the 7-passenger 2008 Ford Taurus X wagon/CUV; in Mexico, the Freestar was replaced by the Ford Transit/Tourneo. In 2014, Ford reentered the segment as the Ford Transit Connect compact MPV gained 7-passenger seating in North America.

During its production the Ford Windstar/Freestar and the Mercury Monterey were sourced from Oakville Assembly (Oakville, Ontario). In total, 1,984,232 were produced (1,704,786 Windstars, 246,493 Freestars, and 32,953 Montereys).

==Development==
In 1985, Ford launched the Aerostar minivan with some degree of success; while it outsold the Chevrolet Astro/GMC Safari, Volkswagen Vanagon, and its Japanese competition, it consistently remained in second place in terms of sales in the minivan segment. To better compete with Chrysler, Ford decided its next minivan would adopt the same front-wheel drive layout popularized by Chrysler.

Codenamed &quot;WIN88&quot;, development of the front-wheel drive minivan commenced in 1988 with a projected 1993 introduction (for the 1994 model year). By 1989, design work was well underway, with a concept design theme being settled on by December 1989. In 1990, the WIN88 exterior design by Camilo Pardo was frozen for scheduled 1993 production, with prototypes being tested from early 1991. Trademarks were filed for the Windstar name at the USPTO on April 13, 1992, with development ending in 1993.

While developed by the Ford truck division (the designers of the Aerostar and Econoline/Club Wagon), the Windstar was designed predominantly by a women-led engineering and design team. Intended nearly exclusively for family use, the design team considered design scenarios from the perspective of pregnant women, women wearing skirts and high heels, and adopted family-friendly design features (reconfigurable cupholders, auxiliary stereo controls).

== First generation (1995–1998) ==
The Ford Windstar was released in March 1994 as a 1995 model, preceding the launch of the third-generation Chrysler minivans by over a year, enabling Ford to cut into Chrysler minivan sales significantly. While the competing model lines roughly benchmarked each other, the Windstar was sold only as an equivalent to the long-wheelbase &quot;Grand&quot; Chrysler vans, with Lincoln-Mercury selling the smaller, unrelated Mercury Villager (jointly developed with Nissan).

From the 1995 to 1997 model years, the Windstar was sold concurrently with its Ford Aerostar predecessor; initially slated for discontinuation following the 1994 model year, continued consumer and dealer demand for the Aerostar led Ford to market both vehicles. For its first year on the market, the Windstar was priced above both the Aerostar and the Mercury Villager. By 1997, however, the Villager&#x27;s base price had surpassed the Windstar&#x27;s by several hundred dollars, and top-of-the-line Villager &quot;Nautica&quot; models were priced some $6,000 USD higher.

In what would later become a design faux pas, this generation of the model line was marketed without a driver-side sliding door, a feature popularized by the introduction of third-generation Chrysler minivans. During its development, Ford claimed its focus groups did not identify it as an important feature; previously, vans (of all sizes) with a driver-side sliding door had sold poorly in the United States.

The Windstar was the first North American-built van to be exported to Europe and sold through the official Ford Europe sales channel. It was slotted above the Ford Galaxy in size and equipment level. The sole powertrain was the 3.0 L V6 engine and automatic transmission, with no diesel engine nor manual transmission available. As it wasn&#x27;t available in right-hand-drive form and with left-side sliding door, it was not sold in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and other left-hand rule of road countries.

=== Chassis specification ===
The first generation Ford Windstar is codenamed WIN88, sharing the front-wheel drive DN5 platform with the first-generation Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable. Using a 120.7-inch wheelbase (nearly 15 inches longer than the Taurus), the Windstar replaced the integrated frame-rail design of the Aerostar with full unibody construction. The front suspension used MacPherson struts, while the rear suspension was a beam axle using coil springs; air suspension was an option.

Front brakes were discs, with rear drum brakes; anti-lock braking was standard. In 1996, four-wheel disc brakes were introduced as an option (when ordered with traction control or the towing package). In contrast to the Aerostar, 15-inch wheels were fitted to the first-generation Windstar (except the 1998 Limited).

==== Powertrain ====
The Windstar shared its powertrains with the Ford Taurus/Mercury Sable. For its 1995 launch, the 3.8L V6 was the sole engine in GL and LX Models, producing 155 hp; a 150 hp 3.0L V6 was introduced as the standard engine in October 1995 for base and lower GL models. For 1996, the 3.8L V6 saw its output increased to 200 hp.

=== Body design ===
To compete more closely with the Chrysler minivans, Ford designers shifted from a &quot;one-box&quot; design to a &quot;two-box&quot; configuration; influenced somewhat by the Mercury Villager, the Windstar had a distinct hoodline and passenger compartment. Benchmarked in size against the long-wheelbase &quot;Grand&quot; Chrysler minivans, the Windstar was given a longer wheelbase than the Aerostar and both the second and third-generation Chrysler minivans; only a long-wheelbase version was marketed.

In what would be a preview of the 1996 Ford Taurus, the Windstar was designed with an oval rear window, though adopting several design elements of the Mercury Villager/Nissan Quest. While far more vertically oriented, the curved dashboard of the Windstar shares influences of the multi-tiered design used by the Lincoln Mark VIII.

For 1996 and 1997, there were no exterior changes except the base-trim model renamed the 3.0L.
The GL did however get the option of Quad Command Bucket Seats which was coupled with alloy wheels and a premium audio system. Most dealers marketed it as a &quot;GLX&quot; model. The Quad Command Seating changed the seats from the high back buckets in the front to the low back bucket seats. 
Traction control was also available on upper end GL Models.

==== 1998 revision ====
The first-generation Windstar underwent few revisions during its production. After a shortened 1997 model year (lasting from October 1996 to January 1997), the 1998 Windstar was introduced. Coinciding with a mid-cycle revision, to compete with the introduction of driver-side sliding doors, Ford widened the driver-side door and added an optional tilting/sliding driver seat.

The front fascia underwent a facelift, adopting a trapezoidal grille and redesigned headlamps (with amber turn signal lenses); the optional fog lamps were moved out of the lower intake of the grille. The rear saw mild revisions, with revised tailgate badging, with larger model script and the centering of the Ford Blue Oval over the license plate). On all trim levels, new wheel covers and alloy wheel designs were introduced; the body side moldings were restyled, the GL and LX/Limited models featured specific bodyside moldings.

The interior saw a minor revision, coinciding with the addition of the tilt-slide driver&#x27;s seat; the power vent switches were moved to the driver&#x27;s door and an intermittent wipe was added for the rear wiper; while the dashboard remained unchanged, head restraints were added to the rear bench seats (already on rear bucket seats). Largely to make up for the retirement of the Aerostar Eddie Bauer, a &quot;Northwoods&quot; appearance package was offered for the GL and LX, offering leather (LX) or cloth/vinyl (GL) seats, gold-trimmed wheels, and luggage rack, and a unique two-tone exterior and bodyside moldings.

==== Features ====
While adopting the front-wheel drive form factor similar to the Chrysler minivans, the Windstar adopted several design features from the Ford Aerostar and Mercury Villager, including rear-seat audio controls, rear air conditioning and middle-row bucket seats; a digital instrument panel was coupled with a trip computer, automatic headlamps, and an auto-dimming rearview mirror. Shared with Ford sedans, the Windstar offered a keyless entry system (using a door-mounted keypad) along with an alarm system.

In contrast to its lack of a driver-side sliding door, the Windstar introduced several features to the minivan segment, including a door lock control from the rear door (unless with the family security package, the rear button was omitted.) and a wide-angle mirror in the overhead console allowing a view of the rear passenger compartment.

=== Trim ===
In line with the Aerostar and the Econoline/Club Wagon, the Windstar was sold as both a passenger van and as a cargo van. In place of using the XL/XLT nomenclature used by Ford trucks and vans, the Windstar adopted the model nomenclature used by the majority of the Ford car lineup. For retail sales, the base trim Windstar was the GL, with the Windstar LX as the flagship model.

For 1998, the Limited trim was introduced, distinguished by its monochromatic exterior and five-spoke 16-inch chrome wheels; wood interior trim was added. Slotted above both the LX and the Mercury Villager LS, the Windstar was offered with all optional features from the LX as standard.

===Safety===
The 1995–1998 Ford Windstar, which was tested as a 1995 model received an &quot;Excellent&quot; (5-stars) rating from the IIHS in all marks, in which the driver survives the accident without any injuries.

It was marketed as the &quot;safest minivan on the market&quot;.

=== Problems ===
During and after its production, this generation of the Windstar would become known for several notable reliability issues. The 3.8 L V6 Essex engine in 1995 models was susceptible to head gasket failure, as it was in its Taurus and Sable stablemates. However, the Windstar&#x27;s problem was a cast iron block with aluminum heads, coupled with higher loads than the Taurus, the van being 700 pounds heavier. In response, Ford extended the warranty on the head gasket to 100,000 miles on most Windstars with this engine. The 3.0 L V6 Vulcan engine was not susceptible to head gasket failure, as it was a completely different engine design.

The Windstar was paired with an AX4S transaxle, which was prone to internal failure. The transmission suffered from cracked forward and reverse clutch pistons. These transmission failures were most susceptible with the 3.8L engine, as the transmission could not handle the extra torque and the extra vehicle weight.

The Windstar was also plagued with various suspension woes. Due to the heft of the overall vehicle, the tierod ends required constant replacement. The front springs were prone to breaking (Covered under safety recall) in specific markets where extreme cold and heavy salt use in winter months occurred.

== Second generation (1999–2003) ==
Released in the summer of 1998 as an early 1999 model, the Ford Windstar was given a complete redesign. As one of the first Ford vehicles in North America to adopt the New Edge styling language, the redesign also was distinguished by the addition of a driver&#x27;s side sliding door.

While retaining mechanical commonality with the Taurus/Sable, Ford shifted the Windstar to a dedicated chassis architecture, introducing the Ford V platform. Several major features made their debut, including front seat-mounted side airbags on vans with VINs starting with 2FMDA, dual power-sliding doors, and rear reverse sensors.

=== Year-by-year changes ===
*2000: The &quot;Limited&quot; model returned as the most luxurious model. A VCR-based rear-seat entertainment system featuring a flip-down LCD screen was a new option on &quot;SE&quot;, &quot;SEL&quot;, and &quot;Limited&quot; models.
*2001: Slight cosmetic changes were made to front and rear fascias for &#x27;01. &quot;LX&quot; became the base model, and a new &quot;SE Sport&quot; model joined the lineup. The smaller 3.0 L was gone, leaving the 3.8 L as the sole engine choice. Models with 2nd row bucket seats now got their own center console. Front-seat side airbags became standard on &quot;Limited&quot;s. The chrome grille on the SE and SEL models was redesigned. The steering wheel was updated to a more modern style, with the blue Ford Logo placed in the center. The transmission was updated to the 4F50N.
*2002: Dual sliding doors became standard on all models.

The 2002 Windstar was the most dependable minivan on the market in the JD Powers dependability survey at three years in service in the 2005 survey. The Windstar beat out the Toyota Sienna and the Honda Odyssey for these honors.
*2003: The last year of the Windstar; no major changes were made in anticipation of a 2004 redesign. In a new marketing strategy, the upcoming third-generation Windstar was rebranded as the Ford Freestar. The last Ford Windstar was produced on July 25, 2003.

=== Trim levels ===
In 1999, Ford began a shift in trim levels that would be seen in many of its American-market sedans through the 2000s. In place of the GL, the LX was the new base model, with the SE and SEL making their debut as the highest trim levels, respectively.

Although all versions of the Windstar wagon were sold with 7-passenger seating, LX-trim Windstars are equipped with 2nd-row bench seats; SE and SEL-trim examples are equipped with 2nd-row bucket seats.
*&quot;Cargo Van&quot; (1999–2003)
*base (1999–2000) Included: 7-passenger seating, air conditioning, power mirrors, power doors, power locks and windows with automatic driver&#x27;s side window, &quot;sleeping baby mode&quot; lights, sliding door locks, 15&quot; steel wheels with hubcaps, and an AM/FM stereo.
*&quot;LX&quot; (1999–2003) Included: 7 passenger-seating, air conditioning, keyless entry, 15&quot; hubcaps, and an AM/FM radio with cassette player and clock, and overhead console. LX Deluxe added 16&quot; alloy rims, an auxiliary climate control with rear controls, and adjustable pedals.
*&quot;SE&quot; (1999–2003) Added: cloth seats, premium AM/FM radio with cassette player (later, a single CD/cassette player) and clock, and 6-way driver&#x27;s seat.
*&quot;SE Sport&quot; (2001–2003)
*&quot;SEL&quot; (1999–2003) Added: automatic headlamps, heavy-duty maintenance battery, leather seats, auto-dimming rear-view mirror, message center, two-tone bumpers, and a premium AM/FM stereo with a single-CD/cassette player.
*&quot;Limited&quot; (2000–2003) Added: reverse sensing system, anti-theft system, side airbags, premium leather seats, memory driver&#x27;s seat, a premium AM/FM radio with in-dash 6-disc CD player and clock, leather-wrapped steering wheel, trailer tow package, floor mats, and heated mirrors.

=== Recalls ===
==== Rear axle ====
In August 2010, Ford issued a voluntary recall of 575,000 Windstar minivans for rear axle problems. This recall followed an investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration which had begun in May 2010. The NHTSA preliminary evaluation stated the design of the rear axle beam, an inverted &quot;U&quot; channel design, appeared to provide a collection point for road slurry. In states which used much road salt, corrosion progressively weakened the axle until it fractured. The states covered by the recall were Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Utah, Vermont, West Virginia and Wisconsin, as well as Washington D.C. In May 2012, 27,000 of the minivans from Virginia were added to the axle recall, bringing the overall total to more than 600,000 vehicles between the U.S. and Canada.

A class action lawsuit was filed against Ford Motor Company in May 2010 proceeding Ford&#x27;s recall. This lawsuit was filed by Plaintiff Aaron Martin against Defendant Ford Motor Company. In this lawsuit, documents were introduced which showed Ford&#x27;s testing of the Benteler Axle in March 1998 resulted in failure of two out of the eleven axles tested. In August 1998, Ford determined the cause of this failure was improper heat treating. In September 1998, the axle manufacturer Bentley Automotive agreed with Ford&#x27;s findings. In October 1999, Ford&#x27;s internal documents show lab testing proved the axle life could be doubled by heat treating, but would require initial retooling cost and result in $3.45 piece cost increase. No changes were made until March 2003.

==== Subframe corrosion ====
In March 2011, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and Ford announced another Ford Windstar recall over corrosion concerns. 425,288 of the model year 1999–2003 Windstar vans originally sold or currently registered in some cold weather states are part of the recall. The problem involves rusting of the subframe. Most of the corrosion occurs on the passenger side of the subframe. If the subframe collapses while driving, the vehicle could potentially lose all steering control and end up in an accident. According to the NHTSA action #PE10026, some Ford Windstar owners had their drive axle detach from the transmission. Ford is offering alternative transportation to owners if their vehicle is unsafe to drive. If the minivan can&#x27;t be repaired, Ford will repurchase the vehicle.

=== IIHS crash test results ===
The 1999–2003 Ford Windstar received an &quot;Acceptable&quot; rating by the IIHS for fair structural performance, moderate injuries to the left foot, and fair dummy control. Although most redesigned vehicles outperform their predecessors to cut down insurance costs and possible injuries to the driver, this generation Windstar did not perform as well as its first generation predecessor. The NHTSA graded the minivan an overall rating of 5 stars in both the frontal and side impact tests.

=== Yearly U.S. sales ===
== Third generation (Ford Freestar; 2004–2007) ==



For the 2004 model year, the third generation Ford Windstar was released; as part of a mid-2000s rebranding of the Ford car model line with nameplates starting with the letter &quot;F&quot;, the Windstar was renamed the Ford Freestar.

Sharing the MV1 platform with the 2000-2003 Ford Windstar, the primary initiative of the $600 million redesign focused on driveline reliability, an issue that had plagued the Windstar since its 1994 introduction. In its development, the Freestar saw the addition of heavier-duty drive axles, larger wheel bearings, and the standardization of four-wheel disc brakes. The 3.0L and 3.8L V6 engines were both retired, in favor of two new engines. In the United States (only), the Freestar was powered by a 193 hp 3.9L V6 (shared with the Ford Mustang) while an optional 201 hp 4.2L V6 (the base engine of the Ford E-150) was standard for Canada and export vans. The 3.9L and 4.2L V6 engines were both enlarged versions of the long-running 3.8L V6. As part of the initiative to improve driveline reliability, the 4-speed automatic transmission saw upgrades for improved shifting and reliability.

Despite that, transmission failures were still common. NHTSA launched an investigation into the 2004 and 2005 Freestar and Monterey due to numerous complaints with regard to the equipped 4F50N transmission. Although the investigation is centered on the torque converter, specifically the failure of the torque converter spline shaft, these failures often required the entire transaxle be rebuilt or replaced. Ford later recalled 2004 and 2005 Freestars and Montereys to have the torque converter replaced free of charge, although 2006-2007 models still suffered from torque converter problems, despite not being recalled.

In the redesign, the Ford Freestar saw a minor exterior facelift. While retaining much of the roofline of the previous-generation Windstar, in a shift away from New Edge design language, the Freestar adopted styling elements from several Ford vehicles, including the Ford Explorer, Ford Freestyle, and Ford Five Hundred. Shifting from the trademark curved dashboard of the previous Ford Windstar, the Ford Freestar adopted a flat dashboard, sharing many design elements with the then-upcoming Ford Five Hundred. In line with a number of competitive minivans, the Ford Freestar introduced a third-row seat that folded flat into the floor.

=== Trim levels ===
The Freestar carried much of the trim lineup from the Windstar, with two exceptions. The &quot;LX&quot; and &quot;Sport&quot; trim levels were dropped in favor of the &quot;SES&quot; and &quot;S&quot; trims.
*&quot;S&quot; (2004 and 2005) Included: cloth upholstery, 3.9L V6 engine, 16&quot; steel rims with hubcaps, keyless entry, an AM/FM stereo, power locks, power windows with automatic driver&#x27;s side window, adjustable pedals, power points, and manual sliding doors.
*&quot;SE&quot; (2004–2007) Included: 3.9L V6 engine, three-row seating, rear air conditioning (on 2006 and 2007 models), an AM/FM radio with single-CD player and digital clock and four speakers, power mirrors, locks and windows, tinted rear windows, keyless entry, and 16&quot; steel rims with hubcaps.
*&quot;SES&quot; (2004 and 2005) Added: 16&quot; sport alloy rims, tri-zone air conditioning, and power driver&#x27;s seat. 
*&quot;SEL&quot; (2004–2007) Added: 4.2L V6 engine, 6-way power driver&#x27;s seat, overhead console, leather-wrapped steering wheel with audio controls, an AM/FM stereo with single-CD and cassette players (cassette removed in 2006) and clock, rear seat audio controls, high-capacity air-conditioning, and 16&quot; alloy rims.
*&quot;Limited&quot; (2004–2007) Added: 3rd row reading lights, an AM/FM stereo with single CD/Cassette players (later, AM/FM stereo with single-CD player with speed-sensitive volume and rear audio controls), analog clock, turn signal mirrors, cornering lamps, message center, power-sliding doors, automatic climate control, and 17&quot; alloy rims (later, 16&quot; clad alloy rims).

=== IIHS crash test results ===
The 2004–2007 Ford Freestar received an &quot;Good&quot; rating in the offset frontal crash test from the IIHS and outperformed the 1999–2003 Ford Windstar, but resulted in moderate injuries only on the head and neck. In the side-impact tests, it received a &quot;Poor&quot; rating without the optional side airbags for poor structural performance, potential head and neck injuries, and high forces on the driver&#x27;s torso, but fared better with the side airbags, earning an overall &quot;Acceptable&quot; rating, but resulted in a moderate head and neck injury to the driver.

=== Yearly American sales ===
=== Awards ===
In 2009, the 2005 Freestar scored second place in J.D. Power&#x27;s Vehicle Dependability Study, behind the Dodge Caravan.

=== Mercury Monterey ===
For the 2004 model year, the Ford Windstar/Freestar gained a Mercury counterpart with the introduction of the Mercury Monterey, replacing the Mercury Villager. In line with Ford introducing &quot;F&quot; nameplates during the early 2000s, Mercury revived a historic &quot;M&quot; nameplate for its minivan (the Monterey name was used from 1950 to 1974). In line with the Freestar, the Monterey adopted design elements from other Mercury vehicles, including the Mountaineer and Montego. Larger than the Villager, it was marketed as a competitor to the Buick Terraza (which replaced the Oldsmobile Silhouette) and the Chrysler Town &amp; Country.

In line with the later Mariner, Milan, and Montego, three trim levels were offered for the Monterey: Convenience, Luxury, and Premier. Features such as power-sliding doors and a rear-seat DVD player were available on Luxury and Premier trim lines. Unique to the Premier was the option of heated and cooled front seats, a class exclusive at the time. The Monterey was offered solely with the 4.2 L V6 engine.

Sales of the Monterey fell far under projections, driven primarily by an overall decline of the minivan segment in North America. In total, 32,195 examples were sold over its three-year production run.

== Replacement ==
After selling far under sales projections, Ford discontinued the Freestar and Monterey after the 2007 model year. The final Monterey was produced by Oakville Assembly on August 25, 2006; the final Freestar was produced on December 29, 2006.

In Mexico and export markets, Ford largely replaced the Freestar by the V185 Ford Transit/Tourneo (front-wheel drive). In North America, Ford became the first American manufacturer to withdraw from the minivan segment entirely, with Ford shifting towards crossover wagons, with the Ford Taurus X (Freestyle) marketed as a 7-passenger vehicle by Ford; in 2009, the Taurus X was replaced by the Flex and Explorer.

For 2010, Ford began imports of the Ford Transit Connect compact MPV. While imported in passenger-van configuration, most sales were intended for cargo-van users. As part of a 2014 redesign, the Transit Connect gained a 7-passenger configuration; though offered with a 120-inch wheelbase (nearly identical to the Windstar/Freestar/Monterey), most other dimensions of the second-generation Transit Connect LWB more closely match the extended-length Aerostar in size.

<doc id="314078" wikidata="Q1343212" url="?curid=314078" title="Enix">
<text>was a Japanese multimedia publisher who handled and oversaw video games, manga, guidebooks, and merchandise. It was founded in 1975 by Yasuhiro Fukushima as Eidansha Boshu Service Center, initially as a tabloid publisher and later attempting to branch into real estate management. Beginning in 1982, Enix began publishing video games. Notable early collaborators were designers Yuji Horii and Koichi Nakamura, artist Akira Toriyama, and composer Koichi Sugiyama. Horii, Nakamura, Toriyama, and Sugiyama would all work on the 1986 role playing video game &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; for the Family Computer; one of the earliest successful RPGs for consoles, it spawned a franchise of the same name which remained Enix&#x27;s best-known product.

They would gain notoriety as a publisher for several studios and their properties including tri-Ace, Tose, Chunsoft and Quintet. It also founded the &quot;Gangan Comics&quot; imprint family, and created international subsidiaries or partnerships related to technology development, publishing, and education. In the early 2000s, due to rising game development costs, Enix entered discussions about merging with Square, a rival company known for the legendary &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; franchise. The merger eventually went ahead in 2003 forming Square Enix, with Enix as the surviving corporate entity.

==History==
===1975-1989: Origins, &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;===
Enix was founded under the name Eidansha Boshu Service Center on September 22, 1975 by Yasuhiro Fukushima. An architect-turned-business entrepreneur, Fukushima initially founded Eidansha as a publishing company focused on advertising tabloids for real estate. On February 5, 1980, Eidansha Boshu created a wholly owned subsidiary Eidansya Fudousan for the purpose of specializing in real estate trading and brokerage, being renamed Eidansha Systems the following year. It was based in Shinjuku, Tokyo. During 1982 Eidansha Boshu made an unsuccessful attempt to become a nationwide chain. Fukushima decided to invest his capital into the emerging video game market; during this period on August 30, Eidansya Fudousan was renamed Enix Corporation. The name Enix was a play on both the mythological Phoenix, and the early computer ENIAC.

Seeking game proposals, Fukushima organized a competition dubbed the &quot;Enix Game Hobby Program Contest&quot; in both computer and manga magazines, offering a prize of ¥1 million (US$10,000) for a game prototype which could be published by Enix. Among the winners were Yuji Horii, then a writer for &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot;, with the sports game &quot;Love Match Tennis&quot;; designer Koichi Nakamura with the puzzle game &quot;Door Door&quot;; and self-trained programmer Kazuro Morita with the simulation video game &quot;Morita&#x27;s Battlefield&quot;. During the next few years, Enix would publish titles for both the PC market and the fledgling Japanese console market. Using his royalties, Morita established the developer Random House and developed several PC and console titles including the &quot;Morita&#x27;s Shogi&quot; series. In collaboration with Nakamura&#x27;s new company Chunsoft, Horii notably created the adventure game &quot;The Portopia Serial Murder Case&quot; (1983), then during discussions around a port of the game to the Famicom (Nintendo Entertainment System) Horii and Nakamura decided to develop a role-playing video game (RPG) for the platform.

The RPG, titled &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;, began development in 1985. Horii and Nakamura acted as designers, composer Koichi Sugiyama created the score for the game, and &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; artist Akira Toriyama was brought on board for art design. While meeting with initially slow sales, &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; became a critical and commercial success, selling over one million copies in Japan. The success of &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; spawned a franchise of the same name, which would become Enix&#x27;s highest-grossing property. Horii, Sugiyama and Toriyama remained mainstays with the series. Chunsoft developed the next five &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; titles. While the &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; series proved successful, Enix continued publishing PC titles to maintain financial stability. The company also began selling merchandise themed after &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; in 1988 with character statues and toys, expanding to board and card games the following year.

In October 1983, Enix co-founded Konishiroku Enix with Konishiroku Photo Company, later purchasing all shares in January 1989. A second subsidiary, Enix Products, was established in March 1988 for the sale of publications and character merchandise. Both subsidiaries along with the original Enix were merged into their parent company Eidansha Boshu in April 1989, which renamed itself Enix Corporation.

===1990-1999: Publishing and collaborations===
In 1990, Enix published their first third-party console title &quot;ActRaiser&quot; for the Super Famicom. The game was developed by Quintet, a Japanese independent developer made up of former Nihon Falcom staff. Enix acted as publisher for all of Quintet&#x27;s subsequent Super Famicom games in Japan. Enix had begun publishing guidebooks for the &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; series, between 1988 and 1991 the company decided to make print publication their second major business section alongside video game publishing. This was to ensure their income did not entirely depend on &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;. This eventually led to Enix launching the &quot;Gangan Comics&quot; imprint family, beginning with &quot;Monthly Shonen Gangan&quot; March 1991. Following its first publication with &quot;Monthly Shonen Gangan&quot; in March 1991, several other manga imprints with magazine and &quot;tankōbon&quot; editions were created for different genres including &quot;Monthly G-Fantasy&quot; and &quot;Monthly Shonen Gag-OU&quot;. The company also expanded their merchandise range to include other notable series including &quot;Mario&quot; and &quot;Pokémon&quot;. In February 1991, Enix registered with the Japan Securities Dealers Association to offer shares for public purchase.

Following &quot;Dragon Quest V&quot; (1992), Chunsoft left as main series developer, wanting to create their own titles. In the years following, Chunsoft continued collaborating with Enix on spin-off &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; titles including early entries in their &quot;Mystery Dungeon&quot; franchise. The next two entries were developed by Heartbeat, a company founded by former Chunsoft staff dedicated to developing &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; titles. Heartbeat would handle main series production until going on sabbatical in 2002. From 1994, Enix acted as publisher for Horii&#x27;s &quot;Itadaki Street&quot; series, taking over the series from ASCII. They also frequently acted as publisher for titles from Tamtam, and created the &quot;Dragon Quest Monsters&quot; spin-off series with developer Tose.

Enix were initially pitched unsuccessfully by Wolf Team with &quot;Tales of Phantasia&quot;, which was ultimately published by Namco in 1995. Enix later acted as publisher for &quot;Star Ocean&quot; (1996), developed by former &quot;Tales of Phantasia&quot; staff members who split from Wolf Team to form tri-Ace. In partnership with Enix, tri-Ace developed three further &quot;Star Ocean&quot; titles, and the Norse mythology-inspired RPG &quot;Valkyrie Profile&quot; (1999). Enix also notably helped publish two Western console titles; &quot;Riven&quot; (1998) and &quot;Tomb Raider III&quot; (1999). In August 1996, Enix moved from Shinjuku to offices in Shibuya. In contrast to other companies at the time, which were leaving behind cartridge-based Nintendo 64 for the disc-based PlayStation, Enix announced in 1997 that they would publish titles for both platforms. They later stated their intention to develop for the GameCube. In August 1999, Enix was listed on Tokyo Stock Exchange&#x27;s first section, which includes the largest companies on the exchange.

===2000-2003: Internal troubles, merger===
Beginning in the early 2000s, Enix&#x27;s manga publishing division went through a period of turbulence as several editors expressed dissatisfaction with Enix&#x27;s focus on &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; media and the &quot;shōnen&quot; demographic, a growing lack of creative freedom, and rising tensions between authors and editors. Editor Yoshihiro Hosaka and a number of other &quot;Gangan&quot; associates founded Mag Garden in 2001, which became a market rival through the &quot;Monthly Comic Blade&quot; magazine. Mag Garden&#x27;s foundation triggered a mass departure of creatives and legal battles with Enix over manga copyright ownership. The issues were resolved in 2003 when Enix agreed to partially invest in Mag Garden. The manga division&#x27;s troubles were lessened with the beginning of &quot;Fullmetal Alchemist&quot;, which proved highly popular. Enix also suffered from financial losses due to the delayed releases of &quot;Dragon Quest VII&quot; (2000) and &quot;Dragon Quest Monsters 2&quot; (2001). Some notable titles begun or announced during the 2000s were PlayStation 2 titles in the &quot;Grandia&quot; series, the MMORPG &quot;Fantasy Earth: The Ring of Dominion&quot; from Puraguru, and the action role-playing game &quot;Drakengard&quot; from Cavia.

In 2001, citing the rising cost of game development, Enix expressed interest in merging with either Square or Namco. They ultimately began talks with Square, a market rival and developer of the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; franchise. Talks were temporarily halted when Square suffered financially due to the failure of the 2001 feature film &quot;Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within&quot;. Following the commercial success of &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; (2001) and &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; (2002), talks went ahead on the merger with Enix as Square&#x27;s finances stabilized; Square&#x27;s then-CEO Yoichi Wada described it as a merger of two companies &quot;at their height&quot;. Despite this, some shareholders had doubts about the merger, notably Square&#x27;s founder Masafumi Miyamoto, who would find himself holding significantly less shares and having a smaller controlling stake if the deal went ahead as initially planned. Miyamoto&#x27;s issue was resolved by altering the exchange ratio to one Square share for 0.85 Enix shares, and the merger was greenlit. The merger resulted in Square Enix being formed on April 1, 2003, with Enix as the surviving corporate entity and Square dissolving its departments and subsidiaries into the new company. Enix&#x27;s last two published titles were &quot;Star Ocean: Till the End of Time&quot; and &quot;Dragon Quest Monsters: Caravan Heart&quot;, both in 2003. &quot;Fantasy Earth&quot; and &quot;Drakengard&quot; were published after the merger.

==Company structure and affiliates==

During reports on the merger with Square, Takashi Oya of Deutsche Securities described Enix as &quot;[outsourcing] game development and [having] few in-house creators&quot; compared to Square&#x27;s focus on internal development. At the time of the merger, Enix had two development divisions; one managing the &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; series led by Yuu Miyake, and a supervisory division made up of producers. Speaking in 1997, Quintet staff described their company as a &quot;subcontractor&quot; for Enix, being involved in its projects even when not acting as a publisher. Horii notably created Armor Project as a company to oversee &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; for Enix, with him comparing the relationship to that between an editor and an artist. Armor Project survived as an associate of Square Enix, growing into a larger entity over the years.

Enix Webstar Network Technology (Beijing) Co., Ltd. was a company formed between Enix and Mauritius Webstar Inc. in 2001 to develop online and mobile phone games in China and, later, other parts of Asia. The subsidiary was carried over after the merger between Square and Enix, but was dissolved in 2005 after the establishment of Square Enix China. Digital Entertainment Academy Co., Ltd. was established as a partially owned subsidiary in 1991. Originally called Toshima Ku Hokkaido University, the school was founded to teach game development.

Enix America Corporation was the corporation&#x27;s first American localization subsidiary based in Redmond, Washington. It was organized after the release of &quot;Dragon Warrior&quot; by Nintendo of America in 1989. The subsidiary came into existence in 1990, but closed in November 1995 when the parent company decided to no longer release products in North America due to poor sales. One of the games they published, &quot;King Arthur &amp; the Knights of Justice&quot;, was Enix&#x27;s first and only North America exclusive game. Enix America, Inc., Enix&#x27;s last American localization subsidiary, was organized in 1999, and was based in Seattle, Washington. Paul Handelman, who was part of Enix America Corporation&#x27;s staff, returned to lead Enix America, Inc. as president. The corporation was in existence until 2003, ceasing to exist after the merger with Square Co., Ltd. Several of Enix&#x27;s localized games were published by other companies including Nintendo and Sony Computer Entertainment; the last was &quot;Dragon Warrior Monsters&quot;, which was through a publishing deal with Eidos.

==Legacy==
The &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; series became one of the most popular video game series in Japan, spinning off into a multimedia franchise, and entering mainstream popular culture in the country. Several publications have cited the original game as a pioneer for the genre on home consoles, influencing the development of other popular series. Enix&#x27;s &quot;Gangan Comics&quot; imprint, in addition to publishing a number of successful series, was credited by critic Tsuyoshi Ito with helping manga appeal to a wider cross-demographic audience that blending the &quot;shōnen&quot; and &quot;shōjo&quot; manga styles. Hosaka also credited Enix with introducing fantasy into the wider mainstream market, and as a pioneer of publishers directly investing in and having creative input into anime adaptations of their work.

<doc id="314080" wikidata="Q4092980" url="?curid=314080" title="Big dumb booster">
<text>Big Dumb Booster (BDB) is a general class of launch vehicle based on the premise that it is cheaper to operate large rockets of simple design than it is to operate smaller, more complex ones regardless of the lower payload efficiency. As referred to by the Office of Technology Assessment:

Even though the large minimum-cost design (MCD) booster is less efficient for all around operation, its total cost of operation is cheaper because it is easier to build, operate and maintain, with the benefit of high reliability because of reduced parts counts.

== History ==

Concept work was led by proponents at Aerospace Corporation, TRW, and Aerojet General, beginning in the late 1950s. The typical approach included maraging steel (HY-140) for structure, pressure-fed engines using / UDMH, later LOX /RP-1, with pintle injectors scaled up from TRW&#x27;s Lunar Module Descent Engine (LMDE).

The Sea Dragon was an extremely large BDB/MCD 2-stage launch vehicle defined by Robert Truax and others at Aerojet. Space Technology Laboratories, Inc. (TRW) contributed to the design effort. It was to be able to carry a payload of over 500 metric tons into low Earth orbit.

TRW (now Northrop Grumman) developed and fired several engines, including their TR-106, a robust, low-cost engine of 2890 kN (650 klb) thrust to demonstrate the engine technology readiness. TRW also defined a low-cost shuttle-surrogate booster to launch 29 metric tons into a 28-degree orbit at a cost of about $59 million.

Beal Aerospace furthered the quintessential BDB/MCD with their BA-1 and BA-2 launch vehicles.

==Minimum cost design==

The MCD methodology was developed by Arthur Schnitt. It is a process of making trade analyses to understand the cost versus mass implications. It is not a specific design choice like pressure-fed engines or single engine per stage. The process shows how to reduce costs by allowing mass to increase where there is a favorable impact on life-cycle cost. Some of the early design concepts were referred to as big dumb boosters, not necessarily in a favorable manner.

The cost of a launch vehicle relative to the payload mass (e.g. dollars per kilogram to orbit) can be determined from the rocket equation, along with mass ratios and cost ratios. As low-tech rocket hardware gets heavier (such as the mass of tanks relative to propellants and the mass of engines relative to thrust), the cost of that hardware (dollars per kg of material) must become vastly cheaper, which explains why a big dumb booster would likely be impractical.

Many of the film projects that received these awards were noted for breaking new ground in terms of technology, where an awards category simply did not yet exist for the given area. New awards categories were often opened in following years. For example, &quot;Toy Story&quot; was awarded a special achievement award as the first computer-animated feature film in 1996, before the best animated feature category debuted in 2001.

The award may only be conferred for achievements in productions that also qualify as an eligible release for distinguished achievements and meet the Academy&#x27;s eligibility year and deadlines requirements. Special Achievement Awards were primarily given between the 1970s and 1990s, with only a single award being given since 2000.

<text>Dalton James Patrick McGuinty Jr. (born July 19, 1955) is a Canadian former politician who served as the 24th premier of Ontario from 2003 to 2013. He was the first Liberal leader to win two majority governments since Mitchell Hepburn nearly 70 years earlier. In 2011, he became the first Liberal premier to secure a third consecutive term since Oliver Mowat after his party was re-elected in that year&#x27;s provincial election.

McGuinty was born in Ottawa. He studied science at university, but ended up taking a law degree and practiced law in Ottawa. His father served as a Liberal member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) from 1987 until his death in 1990. A provincial election was called for later that year and McGuinty successfully ran in his father&#x27;s seat, though the incumbent Liberal government was defeated. After party leader Lyn McLeod resigned due to her leading the Liberals to a second defeat in the 1995 election, McGuinty was elected leader in the 1996 leadership election. McGuinty lost the 1999 election to Progressive Conservative Premier Mike Harris, but won a resounding majority in 2003.

From 2003 to 2007, McGuinty&#x27;s government increased spending for health care and education. He won another majority in 2007, though his second term was deeply affected by the 2008 financial crisis, which saw government revenues plummet. In addition, a scandal developed around a new plan to update health care records called eHealth Ontario. Just prior to the 2011 election, another controversy developed when McGuinty&#x27;s government cancelled gas plants that were located in key Liberal ridings and were widely opposed by the local residents. The cost to cancel the projects was close to $1 billion and the move was seen as pandering to the electorate in a few electoral districts. The scandal caused the Liberals to be reduced to a minority government.

McGuinty continued as premier for another year and a half, but the continuing gas plant issue refused to go away. He prorogued the legislature in October 2012 before being succeeded as Liberal leader and premier by Kathleen Wynne in February 2013. McGuinty resigned his own seat in June 2013. Shortly after leaving the legislature, he was named a senior fellow at Harvard University&#x27;s Weatherhead Center for International Affairs.

==Early life==
McGuinty was born in Ottawa, Ontario. His parents are politician and professor Dalton McGuinty Sr. and full-time nurse Elizabeth (Pexton) McGuinty. The son of a Francophone mother and an Anglophone father, McGuinty is bilingual. McGuinty is the second Roman Catholic to hold the premiership. His father is Irish, and his mother is English and French Canadian. His maternal grandfather immigrated to Canada from England. He has nine brothers and sisters. His younger brother David has represented the riding of Ottawa South in the House of Commons of Canada since 2004.

He is an alumnus of St. Patrick&#x27;s High School in Ottawa, earning a B.Sc. in biology from McMaster University. He then earned his LL.B from the University of Ottawa before practicing law in Ottawa.

Since 1980, he has been married to high school girlfriend Terri McGuinty, an elementary school teacher. The couple have one daughter and three sons.

==Member of Provincial Parliament==
McGuinty&#x27;s father, Dalton Sr., served as Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) for Ottawa South until his death in 1990. Dalton Jr. won the Liberal Party&#x27;s nomination for his father&#x27;s former riding for the provincial election of 1990 and was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario.

The Liberal government of David Peterson was defeated by the social democratic Ontario New Democratic Party (NDP) in that election. In opposition, McGuinty served as the Liberal Party&#x27;s critic for energy, environment and colleges and universities. He was re-elected in Ottawa South in the 1995 provincial election without much difficulty. The Liberals maintained their status as the official opposition amid a provincial swing from the NDP to the Progressive Conservatives.

==Provincial leadership==
McGuinty&#x27;s supporters in his 1996 leadership bid included John Manley, Murray Elston, and Bob Chiarelli. He was elected leader at the party&#x27;s convention December in a surprise victory over front-runner Gerard Kennedy.

Kennedy, a former head of Toronto&#x27;s Daily Bread food bank, was popular on the progressive wing of the party, while McGuinty built his core support on its establishment and pro-business right-wing. McGuinty was fourth on the first and second ballots, closely behind Dwight Duncan. He then overtook Duncan and Joe Cordiano on the third and fourth ballots, respectively, receiving the support of their delegates to win on the fifth ballot over Kennedy. Critics called McGuinty &quot;Harris Lite&quot;, but his supporters argued that a right-leaning leader like McGuinty was necessary to compete against the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario (PC Party) of Premier Mike Harris.

==Opposition leader==

McGuinty&#x27;s first term in opposition was difficult. The governing Progressive Conservatives played up McGuinty&#x27;s low profile by defining him as &quot;not up to the job&quot; in a series of television advertisements. His internal management of the Liberal Party was also criticized by some.

McGuinty&#x27;s performance in the early weeks of the 1999 provincial election was widely criticized in the media, and he was generally regarded as having performed poorly in the election&#x27;s only leaders&#x27; debate. In response to a question by late CITY-TV journalist Colin Vaughan, he described Mike Harris as a &quot;thug&quot; who is lying to the people of Ontario.

McGuinty&#x27;s Liberals won support from progressive voters who had supported the Ontario New Democratic Party, and now hoped to defeat the governing Conservatives by strategic voting. The Progressive Conservative Party was re-elected, and McGuinty rallied his party in the election&#x27;s closing days to draw 40% of the popular vote for the Liberals, their second-best performance in fifty years, which increased their seat total in the Legislature from 30 to 36. McGuinty himself faced a surprisingly difficult re-election in Ottawa South, before defeating his Conservative opponent by about 3,000 votes.

During McGuinty&#x27;s second term as opposition leader, he hired a more skilled group of advisors and drafted former cabinet minister Greg Sorbara as party president. McGuinty also rebuilt the party&#x27;s fundraising operation, launching the Ontario Liberal Fund. In preparation for the 2003 election, the party adopted a platform that emphasized lowering class sizes in schools, hiring more nurses, increasing environmental protections, and &quot;holding the line&quot; on taxes. McGuinty also made an effort to improve his debating skills and received coaching from Scott Reid who also trained United States Senator John McCain.

McGuinty&#x27;s chances of forming government were improved by a number of controversies involving the governing PC Party, including the fallout over the shooting death of native protester Dudley George at Ipperwash, the deaths of seven people from tainted water in Walkerton, and the decision to provide tax credits to parents who sent their children to private schools.

Harris resigned in 2001 and his successor, Ernie Eves, received a short boost in the polls from his attempts to move the PC Party to the centre.

===2003 election campaign===

The 2003 North America blackout gave Eves increased exposure and rallied some support for his party. He called an election immediately after the blackout, and polling showed that the previous Liberal lead had narrowed to a tie in the first week. The rise in Tory support was short-lived. The Liberals took a commanding lead in the campaign&#x27;s second week, and remained in that position until election day.

The Progressive Conservative government accidentally distributed a press release which described McGuinty as an &quot;evil reptilian kitten-eater from another planet&quot;. Eves later stated that this was obviously meant as a joke, but acknowledged its inappropriateness.

McGuinty undertook a series of choreographed events, including signing a taxpayer protection pledge not to raise taxes. He appeared on the popular sports show &quot;Off the Record&quot;, where he received an endorsement from &quot;Canadian Idol&quot; winner Ryan Malcolm.

McGuinty was able to maintain his party&#x27;s standing in the polls in the last stages, preventing Eves from making up ground during the leader&#x27;s debate. On election day, the Liberal were elected to a majority government, winning 72 of the Ontario Legislature&#x27;s 103 seats. The PC Party fell to 24 seats, while the NDP lost official party status in the legislature.

Following the election, the McGuinty government asked former Provincial Auditor Erik Peters to examine the province&#x27;s finances. Peters revealed that the out-going Progressive Conservative government had left a hidden deficit of at least $5.6 billion. The Conservatives questioned Peters&#x27; methodology, and suggested that the McGuinty government was overstating the province&#x27;s financial difficulties to break or delay some of its campaign spending promises.

==Premier of Ontario (2003–2013)==
===First term (2003–2007)===

====First year====
McGuinty took office as Premier and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs on October 23, 2003.

The new government called the Legislature back in session in late 2003. The government brought in auto insurance reforms (including a price cap), rolled-back a series of corporate and personal tax cuts that had been scheduled for 2004, passed legislation that enshrined publicly funded healthcare into provincial law, hired more meat and water inspectors, opened up the provincially owned electricity companies to Freedom of Information laws and enacted a ban on partisan government advertising.

On May 18, 2004, Provincial Finance Minister Greg Sorbara released the McGuinty government&#x27;s first budget, the first year of a four-year plan focused on tackling four deficits the Liberals claim the previous Tories left behind: the &quot;health deficit&quot;, the &quot;education deficit&quot;, the &quot;infrastructure deficit&quot; and the &quot;fiscal deficit&quot;.

This budget was focused on health care. At its core was a large infusion of new money into hospitals specifically to shorten wait times in key areas: knee and hip replacements, cancer treatment, cardiac treatment, cataracts, and MRI and CT scans. The government also brought in free immunizations for children, 150 new Family Health Teams to improve access to physicians, almost 100,000 new home care spaces for Ontario&#x27;s elderly, almost 4,000 new long-term care beds, and $200 million more to improve public health and fight potential outbreaks like SARS and West Nile fever.

To pay for this plan, the Liberals imposed a controversial new Health Premium of $300 to $900, staggered according to income. This violated a key Liberal campaign pledge not to raise taxes, and gave the government an early reputation for breaking promises. The Liberals defended the premium by arguing that the previous government had a hidden deficit, and McGuinty claimed he needed to break his campaign pledge on taxation to fulfill his promises on other fronts. His own finance critic of the time, Gerry Phillips, had predicted that the Tories&#x27; projected balanced budget would in fact result in a $5 billion deficit in a meeting of the Standing Committee of Estimates of the Legislature on June 3, 2003. Liberal MPP Monte Kwinter also predicted a $5 billion deficit.

As a result, the Liberals dropped badly in polls and McGuinty fell behind Ernie Eves in the category of preferred premier.

The Ontario Health Premium also became a major issue in the early days of the 2004 federal election, called a week after the Ontario budget. Many believe that the controversy hampered Liberal Prime Minister Paul Martin&#x27;s bid for re-election .

Also controversial was the elimination of coverage for health services not covered by the Canada Health Act including eye examinations and physical therapy. Other elements of the McGuinty government&#x27;s first budget were a four-year plan to tackle the deficit, funding for 1,000 new teachers, a transfer of two cents of the existing gas tax to municipalities to help fund transit, and a three per cent increase to those on social assistance, the first increase in ten years.

Soon after the federal election, McGuinty attended a First Ministers&#x27; Meeting on health-care reform that resulted in a new agreement for a national health accord. This Accord saw the provinces receive new federal funding in exchange for providing reports on such things as waiting times for surgeries.

McGuinty&#x27;s government ended the year by releasing &quot;Progress Report 2004: Getting Results for Ontario&quot;. This work focused on health, education, and economic growth, and set targets to achieve before the next election (including reducing the high school drop out rate, increasing participation in post-secondary education and reducing wait times for specific medical procedures).

====Second year====

The McGuinty government brought forward a number of initiatives in the fall of 2004. These included legislation allowing restaurant patrons to bring their own wine, banning junk food in public schools, outlawing smoking in public places, and requiring students to stay in school until age 18. Following a series of high-profile maulings by pit bulls, the government also moved to ban the dogs. Some Ontarians were critical of this issue since it was seen as moving the responsibility for safety away from owners and over toward the animals. People who owned pitbulls previous to the ban were allowed to keep them, muzzled in public and sterilized to prevent them from breeding. The &quot;importing&quot; and breeding of pitbulls in Ontario was banned, while all pitbulls being held in shelters were euthanized or sent to research facilities. 

During early 2005, McGuinty called the Legislature back for a rare winter session to debate and pass several high-profile bills. The government legislated a &quot;greenbelt&quot; around Toronto. The size of Prince Edward Island, the Greenbelt protects a broad swath of land from development and preserves forests and farmland. In response to court decisions, the McGuinty Liberals updated legislation to reflect the change in the definition of marriage to include homosexual couples.

McGuinty also launched a campaign to narrow the so-called &quot;$23 billion gap&quot; between what Ontario contributes to the federal government and what is returned to Ontario in services. This came as a sharp turn after more than a year of cooperating with the federal government. McGuinty said special deals made by the federal government with other provinces (Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia) compromised the nature of equalization. He noted that immigrants in Ontario receive $800 in support from the federal government, while those in Quebec receive $3,800.

Premier McGuinty and Prime Minister Paul Martin debated the Ontario government&#x27;s accusations throughout the spring of 2005. McGuinty and Martin finally met in May and, following a nine-hour meeting, McGuinty received a commitment for $5.75 billion, spread out over five years, including new money for immigrant settlement, training for the unemployed, federal delivery of meat inspection and corporate tax collection and per capita funding for post-secondary education.

In late April 2005, McGuinty announced the closure of the Lakeview coal-fired generating station, one of Ontario&#x27;s largest polluters. Although the McGuinty government had promised to close all coal-burning plants by 2007, Energy Minister Dwight Duncan announced on June 14, 2005, that this was no longer possible, and that the Nanticoke Coal Plant will not close until 2009.

On May 11, 2005, the McGuinty Liberals delivered their second budget, built around the &quot;Reaching Higher&quot; plan for education. The second year of the four-year plan, this budget was designed to tackle to so-called &quot;education deficit&quot;. Investing $6.2 billion over the next four years, the budget included the largest investment in higher education in forty years. It also increased accessibility for low-income students, expanded medical school spaces, and invested in new faculty, graduate scholarships and research. The budget also broke a promise to balance the budget in 2007–08. The government instead aimed at balance in 2008–09.

The McGuinty Liberals also moved to expand infrastructure spending by encouraging Ontario&#x27;s large pension plans to invest in the construction of new roads, schools and hospitals. Specific projects in the budget included a 10-year expansion of the Toronto Transit Commission and GO Transit, 15,000 new affordable housing units and improved border crossings. NDP leader Howard Hampton described this move as &quot;privatization by stealth&quot;.

During their second year in office, the McGuinty Liberals brought forward a series of negotiations with the province&#x27;s unions.First, Health Minister George Smitherman concluded an agreement with the province&#x27;s doctors that included incentives to practice in family health teams or under-serviced communities. Education Minister Gerard Kennedy established a province-wide negotiating framework with the province&#x27;s teachers&#x27; unions with the result that most school boards settled their contracts without lost teaching time. Finally, Management Board Chair Gerry Phillips closed a deal with the provincial government&#x27;s own civil service union, the Ontario Public Service Employees Union.

On June 22, 2005, Education Minister Gerard Kennedy announced that 90–95% of Ontario students between junior kindergarten and Grade Three would be in classes of twenty students or fewer by 2007. He also acknowledged that extenuating circumstances may require slightly larger classes in some cases. Opposition critic Frank Klees accused the McGuinty government of breaking its promise to cap classroom sizes. Kennedy responded that some flexibility is always necessary, and that any reasonable person would regard a 90–95% success rate as a promise kept.

Also in June 2005, two cabinet ministers in McGuinty&#x27;s government were scrutinized for alleged improprieties. Joseph Cordiano faced calls for his resignation after revelations that he billed $17,000 for personal expenses to his riding association. These expenses included meals in Paris and Milan, and theatre tickets in London. Cordiano insisted that these expenses were related to riding activities, and refused to resign. McGuinty defended Cordiano in public, claiming he had &quot;complete confidence&quot; in the minister.

At around the same time, Minister of Transportation Harinder Takhar was accused of a conflict-of-interest, after visiting a company that he owned in a blind trust. Takhar acknowledged that he made &quot;an error in judgement&quot;, but denied any wrongdoing. Both Cordiano and Takhar were retained in their portfolios following a cabinet shuffle on June 29, 2005. The matter was sent to the provincial ethics commissioner, who on January 4, 2006, ruled that Takhar had violated Ontario&#x27;s integrity guidelines by not maintaining an arms length relationship with the trustee appointed to run his blind trust. McGuinty has defended his minister, and has rejected calls to remove him from cabinet, even after the Integrity Commissioner issued his finding.

In the same cabinet shuffle, Premier McGuinty withdrew from the Intergovernmental Affairs portfolio and became the province&#x27;s first Minister of Research and Innovation.

====Third year====
On October 11, 2005, police raided the Sorbara Group offices — owned by Greg Sorbara and his brothers — as part of the ongoing Royal Group Technologies investigation. The warrant stated that there were reasonable grounds to believe Sorbara and other directors of Royal Group defrauded the company and shareholders when they bought land in Brampton, that was owned by a subsidiary of the Sorbara Group. Sorbara initially resisted opposition calls for him to step down, then resigned as Minister of Finance the same day. He consistently denied any knowledge of the specific allegations against him, and sued the RCMP to either clarify their case against him or withdraw their investigation. Following Sorbara&#x27;s resignation, Dwight Duncan was appointed as Minister of Finance and Chair of the Management Board. Donna Cansfield took over Duncan&#x27;s responsibility as Minister of Energy and Jim Bradley as Government House Leader.

The next day, the McGuinty government put forward a throne speech in October reiterating their priorities of health, education and economic prosperity. The speech outlined plans to offer the first money-back guarantee on a public service: a refund for people who do not receive a birth certificate within 15 days of applying on-line.

On November 18, 2005, it was announced that Ontario&#x27;s Drive Clean emissions program was to be expanded rather than scrapped.

The 2006 budget was the third year of the four-year plan, and focused on the &quot;infrastructure deficit&quot;. The centrepiece was MoveOntario, a $1.2 billion investment in transportation infrastructure. $400 million was invested to build and repair roads and bridges in municipalities across Ontario.

On May 18, 2006, a judge agreed with Greg Sorbara&#x27;s contention that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCPP) had erred in including his name in the search warrant. In striking Sorbara&#x27;s name from the warrant, Justice Ian Nordheimer of the Ontario Superior Court said there were inadequate grounds for police to include him in the first place. The judge was particularly scathing in his review of the RCMP probe of Sorbara. On May 23, 2006, Sorbara was reinstated as Minister of Finance, while Duncan returned to the Energy portfolio.

On August 17, 2006, &quot;Foreign Direct Investment&quot; magazine (a British magazine owned by the &quot;Financial Times&quot;) named Dalton McGuinty &quot;personality of the year&quot; for encouraging investment in the auto sector, for developing a plan to increase energy production, and for promoting research and innovation.

====Fourth year====
On June 14, 2006, Energy Minister Dwight Duncan announced the McGuinty government&#x27;s twenty-year electricity plan, which committed to spending $46 billion on rebuilding all of the province&#x27;s ageing nuclear reactors. The plan also made the McGuinty government the first Ontario government since the 1970s to commit to building new nuclear stations, and further postponed the schedule for closing Ontario&#x27;s coal stations to 2014. In response, Greenpeace activists occupied Energy Minister Duncan&#x27;s offices. The day after the announcement of its long-term electricity plan &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; published a front-page story that the government had quietly passed a regulation to &#x27;exempt&#x27; its energy plan from an environmental assessment.

The government&#x27;s decision to exempt the government&#x27;s electricity plan was criticized by some environmental organizations. In a press release, Greenpeace, the David Suzuki Foundation, and the Pembina Institute noted that each had provided the government with a legal opinion prepared by the Canadian Environmental Law Association, which concluded that the government&#x27;s energy plan would be subject to the province&#x27;s Environmental Assessment Act.

The McGuinty government&#x27;s 2007 budget was criticized by Toronto mayor David Miller, who argued that the province was refusing to &quot;pay its bills&quot;, and said that Toronto&#x27;s budgetary problems were the result of $500 million in social service costs mandated by the provincial government. During a later discussion, provincial Finance Minister Greg Sorbara declined to help the city to fix its $71 million shortfall, saying that &quot;he doesn&#x27;t have a mandate to fix this&quot;.

On July 26, 2007, McGuinty dismissed Mike Colle as Minister of Citizenship and Immigration following a report by the auditor general that Colle had mishandled government funds. He was criticized for giving out $32 million in government grants to immigrant and cultural groups without official applications or formal statements of purpose. In one case, the Ontario Cricket Association received $1 million when it asked for $150,000.

====2007 re-election====
In late 2004, John Tory was chosen to replace Ernie Eves as leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario. A principal secretary to former PC Premier Bill Davis, Tory was regarded as more moderate than Mike Harris and the mostly rural MPPs who made up the majority of his caucus. McGuinty&#x27;s Liberals ran a candidate against Tory during the latter&#x27;s successful bid to enter the legislature. Howard Hampton continued to lead the NDP. Though Tory out-polled McGuinty in the category of preferred premier, the Liberals held a lead over the Progressive Conservatives, while the NDP held around 20% support.

In October 2006, the McGuinty Liberals held their last Annual General Meeting before the 2007 election. The event set in place several key elements of their reelection strategy. First, American political consultant James Carville advised Liberal activists to stick to a simple message in the next election. Second, the party elected long-time activist Gord Pheneuf as the new president. Finally, Premier McGuinty laid out the theme of the next campaign: standing up for Ontario families.

On October 10, 2007, McGuinty and his Ontario Liberal Party won a consecutive majority government in the 39th general provincial election. The last Liberal Party Premier to achieve such success was Mitchell Hepburn during the 1930s.

===Second term (2007–2011)===
The 2009 Ontario Budget contained significant tax policy changes: McGuinty&#x27;s Minister of Finance Dwight Duncan announced plans to harmonize Ontario&#x27;s retail sales tax with the federal Goods and Services Tax, and reduce corporate and personal taxes.

On March 31, 2009, McGuinty admitted to considering of the removal of the minimum wage increase at 2010 from $9.25, to $10.25 as a mistake after the reactions that he received from the opposition and anti-poverty activists.

There was criticism of McGuinty and calls for Health Minister David Caplan to resign after it was revealed that eHealth Ontario CEO Sarah Kramer had approved about $4.8 million in no-bid contracts during the first four months of the agency&#x27;s operation, while also spending, argued that the McGuinty government spent five years and $647 million on the Smart Systems for Health Agency, which used 15 per cent of its $225-million annual budget on consultants despite employing 166 people with annual salaries exceeding $100000, before the project was shut down and restarted as eHealth Ontario. Premier Dalton McGuinty said he was concerned about eHealth&#x27;s spending information and said that he would act upon the auditor general&#x27;s report. McGuinty and Caplan said that it was tough to recruit top experts to build a province wide electronic health records system. McGuinty and Caplan promised an independent review of eHealth, outside of the auditor general&#x27;s probe. It was later revealed that the ministry and eHealth did not contract PricewaterhouseCoopers to conduct the review. The Liberals said it would have duplicated the auditor general&#x27;s work, and the opposition noted that Caplan had earlier suggested the independent review had been underway. Documents obtained by the press showed that McGuinty intervened using an order in council to have Kramer hired as CEO, bypassing the competitive selection process, over the objections of officials in the Health Ministry who felt she was inexperienced. McGuinty said that he relied upon the advice of then-chairman of eHealth Dr. Alan Hudson and now described Kramer&#x27;s hiring as a mistake.

==== Gas plant scandal ====

McGuinty&#x27;s minority government was also criticized for a decision during the 2011 election campaign to scrap unpopular gas plants being constructed in Mississauga and Oakville — the move was seen as a politically expedient one made to improve the Liberal Party&#x27;s chances of retaining the five ridings it held in the area, as the opposition PC&#x27;s and NDP had already promised to scrap them. The opposition, emboldened by the minority government situation, demanded that Energy Minister Chris Bentley release all documents related to the decision. Bentley delayed prior to releasing 36,000 pages in September and insisted that all documents had been released. The cancellation of the gas plant was estimated to be $950 million to $1.1 billion over approximately 20 years. 

====2011 re-election====
On October 6, 2011, the Liberals were reelected for a third term in government, though they lost their majority in the Legislature. Only winning 53 of the 107 legislative seats, the Liberals were one seat short of a majority.

===Third term (2011–2013)===
Now that Ontario had returned to a minority government after decades of majorities, the political landscape changed significantly. The governing Liberals were required to work with the other parties to move forward with legislation and avoid losing a non-confidence motion. McGuinty had promised not to form a coalition with any other party if elected in a minority, and proceeded to govern by attracting support from opposition MPPs on a bill-by-bill basis.

McGuinty commissioned former Toronto-Dominion Bank chief economist Don Drummond to examine the province&#x27;s finances. In February 2012, Drummond released the report that stated that the province would face a $30-billion deficit by 2017-18, which was nearly double what the McGuinty government had projected. Drummond recommended severe austerity measures to curb the growth of the province&#x27;s debt, which was $215 billion at the time, from reaching $411 billion in five years. While McGuinty inherited a moderate deficit of $5 billion, it had tripled due to his progressive spending programs as well as the recent economic recession.

The government was soon mired in controversy on several fronts. As a result of Ontario&#x27;s budgetary situation, the government took a hard line on public sector wages. It introduced Bill 115 &#x27;Putting Students First Act 2012&#x27; in order to suspend collective bargaining, impose contracts on teachers and suspend their right to strike for two years. It also introduced legislation to impose a wage freeze on 481,000 additional public sector workers in hospitals, colleges, public agencies and the civil service.

In 2012, the Liberals were plagued by yet another scandal. During the Ornge Air Ambulance scandal, the CEO was paid 14.1 million dollars, and the executives purchased a commercial building, and them leased it back to themselves at a higher than market rate, through a shell company.

The Liberals had hoped to regain their majority through by-elections and on September 6, 2012, two by-elections were held, one in Vaughan which the Liberal Party won, and another in Kitchener—Waterloo. Former Deputy Premier Elizabeth Witmer, a Progressive Conservative, had represented Kitchener—Waterloo for the previous four terms. Her resignation allowed the riding to elect Catherine Fife of the New Democratic Party (NDP), leaving McGuinty&#x27;s Liberals with a minority government. The NDP victory in Kitchener-Waterloo, the seat the Liberals needed to gain, was attributed in part to the backlash against Bill 115; the Liberals placed third in the riding.

====2012 prorogation and resignation====
After it became known that there were an additional 20,000 documents Bentley was cited by a rare contempt motion by a legislative committee and was facing a contempt motion of the Legislature when McGuinty unexpectedly announced on October 15, 2012, that he was ending the legislative session by proroguing the legislature and that he would resign as premier as soon as the Liberal Party chose his successor, in January 2013.

Liberal House Leader John Milloy later stated that prorogation was necessary because an impasse was reached with labour leaders and the opposition over plans to freeze all public sector wages. The opposition charged that it was done to dodge negative publicity over the investigation and criminal probe into the Ornge Air affair, the controversial decision to halt construction of two gas-fired power plants during the previous election, and the subsequent threats by the opposition to vote on finding Cabinet ministers in Contempt of Parliament for withholding from the Legislature information related to halting the projects. In early 2013, Onley explained in an interview conducted by the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; that, though he and McGuinty discussed the matter, among others, before he granted the prorogation, he could only follow the constitution and adhere to the principles of responsible government; only if the premier were &quot;trying to subvert democracy&quot; could Onley have refused the advice and, as Onley put it, &quot;something that&#x27;s politically controversial doesn&#x27;t fit that category. Doesn&#x27;t even come close... It&#x27;s up to the politicians to work out the political process, the political decision-making that is behind prorogation—and the fallout after prorogation.&quot; On the subject of the lack of a date on which the Legislature would be summoned to return, the Lieutenant-Governor said he had no guide; the Legislature&#x27;s standing orders outline that a specific date must be set, but the Legislative Assembly Act does not, and precedents are inconsistent.

While there had been speculation that McGuinty would become a candidate for the federal Liberal leadership election, on October 23, 2012, he announced that he would not be doing so. McGuinty resigned from his premiership on February 11, 2013. He resigned his seat in the legislature on June 12, 2013, at the end of the legislative session, after representing Ottawa South for 23 years.

==Life after politics==
In June 2013, McGuinty was named a senior fellow for the fall semester at Harvard University&#x27;s Weatherhead Center for International Affairs.

McGuinty published a memoir with Dundurn Press in 2014 called &quot; Dalton McGuinty: Making a Difference&quot; about his life in politics.

<doc id="314085" wikidata="Q467616" url="?curid=314085" title="Arai Hakuseki">
<text>was a Confucianist, scholar-bureaucrat, academic, administrator, writer and politician in Japan during the middle of the Edo period, who advised the &quot;shōgun&quot; Tokugawa Ienobu. His personal name was Kinmi or Kimiyoshi (君美). Hakuseki (白石) was his pen name. His father was a Kururi han samurai Arai Masazumi (新井 正済).

==Biography==
Hakuseki was born in Edo and from a very early age displayed signs of genius. According to one story, at the age of three Hakuseki managed to copy a Confucian book written in Kanji, character by character. Because he was born on the same year as the Great Fire of Meireki and because he was hot tempered and his brow would crease looking like 火 or &quot;fire&quot;, he was affectionately called &quot;Hi no Ko&quot; (火の子) or &quot;child of fire&quot;. He was a retainer of Hotta Masatoshi, but after Masatoshi was assassinated by Inaba Masayasu, the Hotta clan was forced to move from Sakura to Yamagata then to Fukushima and the domain&#x27;s income declined. Hakuseki offered to leave, becoming a &quot;rōnin&quot; and studied under Confucianist Kinoshita Jun&#x27;an. He was offered a post by the largest &quot;han&quot;, that of Kaga Domain, but he offered the position to a fellow samurai.

In 1693, Hakuseki was called up to serve by the side of Manabe Akifusa as a &quot;brain&quot; for the Tokugawa shogunate and shogun Tokugawa Ienobu. He went on to displace the official Hayashi advisers to become the leading confucianist for Ienobu and Tokugawa Ietsugu. While some of Hakuseki&#x27;s policies were still carried out after Ienobu&#x27;s death, after the 6th shogun, Tokugawa Ietsugu, died and Tokugawa Yoshimune&#x27;s rule began, Hakuseki left his post to begin his career as a prolific writer of Japanese history and Occidental studies.

He was buried in Asakusa (current day Taitō, Tokyo), Hoonji temple but was later moved to Nakano, Tokyo, Kotokuji temple.

==Economic policy==

Under the top Rōjū, Abe Seikyo, with strong support from Ienobu, he launched Shōtoku no chi, a series of economic policies designed to improve the shogunate&#x27;s standing. By minting new and better quality currency, inflation was controlled. Calculating from trade records, Hakuseki deduced that fully 25% of gold and 75% of silver in Japan had been spent on trades with foreign countries. Concerned that Japan&#x27;s national resources were at risk, he implemented a new trade policy, the &quot;Kaihaku Goshi Shinrei&quot; (海舶互市新例), to control payments to Chinese and Dutch merchants by demanding that instead of precious metals, products like silk, porcelain, and dried seafoods should be used for trading. However, the beneficial effects of this policy were limited as the trade of precious metals from Tsushima and Satsuma was uncontrolled by the &quot;bakufu&quot;.

He also simplified rituals for welcoming the Joseon dynasty&#x27;s ambassadors, in the face of opposition from the Tsushima Confucianist Amenomori Hōshu.

==Constitutional policy==

Hakuseki applied the mandate of heaven to both the emperor and the &quot;shōgun&quot;. Since there had been no revolution to change Japan&#x27;s basic institutions, he argued that the shogun was subordinate to the emperor and that in showing good governance, moral fortitude and respect to the emperor a shogun proved that he held divine right. He also traced Tokugawa family roots back to the Minamoto clan and thus to a line of imperial descent in order to show that Ieyasu&#x27;s political supremacy had been fitting. To strengthen the shogun&#x27;s power and maintain national prestige he proposed changing the title to koku-ō – nation-king.
