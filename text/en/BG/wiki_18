<text>The Designers Republic (also tDR, and styled as The Designers Republic™) is a British graphic design studio based in Sheffield, England, founded in 1986 by Ian Anderson and Nick Phillips. They are best known for electronic music logos, album artwork, and anti-establishment aesthetics, embracing &quot;brash consumerism and the uniform style of corporate brands&quot;. Work by tDR is held in the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art and the Victoria and Albert Museum.

The studio in its larger form closed in January 2009, with Anderson stating it would continue in a more &quot;slimline&quot; form.

== Style ==

Work by the Designers Republic generally is viewed as &quot;playful and bright&quot; and considered Maximum-minimalist, mixing images from Japanese anime and subvertised corporate logos with a postmodern tendency towards irony. It often features statements/slogans such as &quot;Work Buy Consume Die&quot;, &quot;Robots Build Robots&quot;, &quot;Customized Terror&quot;, &quot;Buy nothing, pay now&quot;, and &quot;Made in the Designers Republic&quot;. They also celebrated their northern roots with phrases like &quot;Made in the Designers Republic, North of Nowhere&quot; and &quot;SoYo&quot; (referring to Sheffield&#x27;s county of South Yorkshire) – affirming they were not from London&#x27;s design community in Soho.

== History ==

Initially, Ian Anderson founded The Designers Republic to design flyers for the band Person to Person, which he managed at the time. His first ideas were inspired by Russian constructivism. Nick Phillips, a sculptor and the organ player in World of Twist, soon joined him, and the duo created a visual identity for Fon Records, and album cover for Chakk&#x27;s &quot;10 Days in an Elevator&quot;. This financed a studio space in the boardroom of a former engineering works.

Another early client which brought them to the wider public&#x27;s attention was Leeds band Age of Chance, for whom they developed a series of record covers between 1986 and 1987, beginning with a cover of the Prince track &quot;Kiss&quot;. The duo worked 72-hour weekly shifts, doing everything by hand using photocopiers, craft knives and spraymount.

The sleeve of the 1987 12-inch &quot;Don&#x27;t Get Mad... Get Even! (The New York Remixes)&quot; was selected as one of &quot;Q&quot;&#x27;s &quot;100 Best Record Covers of All Time&quot; in 2001.

Their work for Age of Chance led to further record sleeve work for Krush and Pop Will Eat Itself, for whom tDR bastardised the Pepsi logo to form the band&#x27;s visual identity.

In the 1990s, they established a faux corporation branded &#x27;Pho-Ku&#x27;, to express their dislike of corporate-driven consumerist identity.

In 1994, &quot;Emigre&quot; magazine devoted a whole issue to the Designers Republic. A copy is held by MoMA. This issue is still &quot;Emigre&quot;&#x27;s best-ever seller and is now sold out, changing hands for up to £750.

The Designers Republic later produced album cover designs for the electronica label Warp Records (also based in Sheffield). They designed the covers for many Warp artists, including Autechre, LFO and Aphex Twin. Their style became &quot;the visual language of ambient techno and Sheffield pop&quot;. They also worked for other labels, designing sleeves for Moloko, Fluke, Funkstörung, The Orb, Pulp (and Jarvis Cocker), Supergrass and Towa Tei, and the New York City label Sleeping Giant Glossolalia.

Outside the music industry, tDR created the visuals, packaging and manual for the PlayStation–Sega Saturn game &quot;Wipeout&quot; (1995), the interface for the PC game &quot;Hardwar&quot; (1998), and packaging and posters for the first &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; (1997). They collaborated with Swatch in 1996 to design their own watch. They also designed the packaging for Sony&#x27;s AIBO.

tDR has consulted on the re-branding of the city of Quito, capital of Ecuador, and was the only non-national design company to be invited to propose a new flag for Slovenia. tDR was also commissioned to create a logo and general graphic design by French musician-producer Julien Civange for its Music2titan mission to take music on the European Space Agency&#x27;s Cassini–Huygens probe to the moon Titan in 2004.

On 20 January 2009, after 23 years in operation, tDR went into voluntary liquidation, Anderson bought back the company name and assets, and relaunched tDR as a smaller outfit.

<text>Layered Image File Format (LIFF) is a file format used in the Openlab suite for microscope image processing. It is a proprietary format, but has an open, extensible form analogous to TIFF. It was specifically designed to contain a large number of high resolution images, and also all of the meta data generated by analysis of such images.

Apart from being an acronym, the name LIFF was chosen to honour Douglas Adams and John Lloyd&#x27;s &quot;The Meaning of Liff&quot;, which was in turn named after Liff, a town in Scotland.</text><links>

<doc id="310033" wikidata="Q1152919" url="?curid=310033" title="Multinational Character Set">
<text>The Multinational Character Set (DMCS or MCS) is a character encoding created in 1983 by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) for use in the popular VT220 terminal. It was an 8-bit extension of ASCII that added accented characters, currency symbols, and other character glyphs missing from 7-bit ASCII. It is only one of the code pages implemented for the VT220 National Replacement Character Set (NRCS). MCS is registered as IBM code page/[[CCSID]] 1100 (Multinational Emulation) since 1992. Depending on associated sorting Oracle calls it WE8DEC, N8DEC, DK8DEC, S8DEC, or SF8DEC.
Such &quot;extended ASCII&quot; sets were common (the National Replacement Character Set provided sets for more than a dozen European languages), but MCS has the distinction of being the ancestor of ECMA-94 in 1985 and ISO 8859-1 in 1987.

The code chart of MCS with ECMA-94, ISO 8859-1 and the first 256 code points of Unicode have many more similarities than differences. In addition to unused code points, differences from ISO 8859-1 are:

<doc id="310034" wikidata="Q3553018" url="?curid=310034" title="VT220">
<text>The VT200 series is a family of computer terminals introduced by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) in November 1983. The VT220 was the basic version, a text-only version with multi-lingual capabilities. The VT240 added monochrome ReGIS vector graphics support to the base model, while the VT241 did the same in color. The 200 series replaced the successful VT100 series, providing more functionality in a much smaller unit with a much smaller and lighter keyboard. Like the VT100, the VT200 series implemented a large subset of ANSI X.364. Among its major upgrades was a number of international character sets, as well as the ability to define new character sets.

The VT200 series was extremely successful in the market. Released at $1,295, but later priced at $795, the VT220 offered features, packaging and price that no other serial terminal could compete with at the time. In 1986, DEC shipped 165,000 units, giving them a 42% market share, double that of the closest competitor, Wyse. Competitors adapted by introducing similar models at lower prices, leading DEC to do the same by releasing the less-expensive $545 VT300 series in 1987. By that time, DEC had shipped over one million VT220s.

==Hardware==
The VT220 improved on the earlier VT100 series of terminals with a redesigned keyboard, much smaller physical packaging, and a faster microprocessor, the Intel 8051 microcontroller. The VT220 was available with CRTs that used white, green, or amber phosphors.

The VT100s, like the VT50s before them, had been packaged in relatively large cases that provided room for expansion systems. The VT200s abandoned this concept, and wrapped the much smaller 1980s-era electronics tightly around the CRT. The result was a truncated pyramidal case with the apex at the back, only slightly larger than the CRT. This made it much easier to fit the terminal on a desk.

Normally the monitor sat facing upward at about a 15 degree angle. Because it was lower than head height, the result was an especially ergonomic terminal. On the rear bottom of the case was a carrying handle that could also be used to angle the monitor more forward. An extendable post could do so to even greater angles, allowing the monitor to face directly forward.

The LK201 keyboard supplied with the VT220 was one of the first full-length, low-profile keyboards available; it was developed at DEC&#x27;s Roxbury, Massachusetts facility. It was much smaller and lighter than the VT100s version, and connected to the terminal using a lighter and more flexible coiled cable and a telephone jack connector.

The VT200s were the last DEC terminals to provide a 20mA current loop serial interface (using a 8-pin Molex-style connector), an older standard originally developed for the telegraph system but became popular on computers due to the early use of Teletype Model 33&#x27;s as &quot;ad hoc&quot; terminals. A standard 25-pin D-connector was also provided for RS-232. Only one of the two ports could be in use at a given time. Later DEC terminals would replace both of these with their proprietary Modified Modular Jack (MMJ) connectors.

Another version of the terminal, the VT240, used DEC&#x27;s own DEC T-11, a single-chip microcontroller version of the PDP-11 minicomputer.
The VT241 is the color version of the VT240, consisting of the same V240 base unit with VR-241 color monitor. A VT240 can be upgraded to a VT241 by replacing the monitor and the cable.

==Software==
The VT220 was designed to be compatible with the VT100, but added features to make it more suitable for an international market. This was accomplished by including a number of different character sets that could be selected among using a series of ANSI commands.

Glyphs were formed within a 10 by 10 grid. The terminal shipped with a total of 288 characters in its ROM, each one formed from an 8 by 10 pixel glyph. Using only 8 of the columns left space between the characters. The characters included the 96 printable ASCII characters, 67 Display Controls, 32 DEC Special Graphics, and a backward question mark used to represent undefined characters.

The VT200s included the ability to make minor changes to the character set using the National Replacement Character Set (NRCS) concept. When operating on an 8-bit clean link up to 256 character codes were available, which included a full set of European characters. But when operating on a typical 7-bit link, only 128 were available, and only 96 of these produced display output as the rest were control characters. This was not enough characters to handle all European languages. Most terminals solved this by shipping multiple complete character sets in ROM, but there was a cost in doing so.

DEC&#x27;s solution to this problem, NRCS, allowed individual characters glyphs in the base set of 96 7-bit characters to be swapped out. For instance, the British set made a single substitution, replacing the US&#x27;s hash character, , with the pound sign, . The terminal included 14 such replacement sets, most of which swapped out about a dozen characters. This eliminated the need to ship 14 versions of the terminal, or to include 14 different 7-bit character sets in ROM.

Additionally, the VT200s allowed for another 96 characters in the Dynamically Redefined Character Set (DRCS), which could be downloaded from the host computer. Data for the glyphs was sent by encoding a set of six vertical pixels into a single character code, and then sending many of these &quot;Sixels&quot; to the terminal, which decoded them into the character set memory. In later models, the same sixel concept would be used to send bitmapped graphics as well. Character graphics were a common example of these downloaded sets.

==Escape Key controversy==
Prior to the VT220, if an Escape key was present, it was positioned in the upper left corner of the keyboard. The VT220 moved it to the typical location for the f11 key, in the middle of the top row of keys. For users of the TECO editor, in which it is heavily used, this was inconvenient.

==Legacy==
In 1983-1984, during the design phase of the IBM Model M keyboard, the VT220 was a new and very popular product. IBM&#x27;s design team chose to emulate its LK201 keyboard layout. Key innovations that IBM copied were the inverted-T shape of the arrow cluster, the navigation keys above it, and the numeric keypad off to its right. Eventually the popularity of the IBM PC would lead to the Model M layout becoming standardized by ANSI and ISO. Through those standards, minor variations of the VT220&#x27;s keyboard layout have dominated keyboard design ever since.

<doc id="310046" wikidata="Q710501" url="?curid=310046" title="James G. Watt">
<text>James Gaius Watt (January 31, 1938 – May 27, 2023) was an American lawyer, lobbyist, and civil servant who served as U.S. Secretary of the Interior in the Ronald Reagan administration from 1981 to 1983. He was described as &quot;anti-environmentalist&quot; and was one of Ronald Reagan&#x27;s most controversial cabinet appointments.

His tenure as Secretary of the Interior was controversial primarily because he was perceived as hostile to environmentalism. Watt opened up nearly all of America&#x27;s coastal waters to oil and gas drilling, widened access to coal on federal lands, and eased restrictions on strip-mining. His proposals to sell off federal lands failed due to extensive opposition. In 1983, he resigned after controversially remarking that a panel reviewing his coal-leasing policies had &quot;every kind of mixture—I have a Black. I have a woman, two Jews and a cripple.&quot;

After resigning from government, Watt became a lobbyist for builders seeking contracts with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). In 1995, he was indicted on 18 counts of felony perjury and obstruction of justice for making false statements before a federal grand jury investigating influence peddling at HUD. The following year, he was sentenced to five years&#x27; probation.

==Early life and career==
Watt was born in Lusk, Wyoming, the son of Lois Mae (née Williams) and William Gaius Watt, a lawyer and homesteader.

Watt attended the University of Wyoming, earning a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1960 and a juris doctor degree in 1962.

==Career==
Watt&#x27;s first political job was as an aide to Republican Party Senator Milward L. Simpson of Wyoming, whom he met through Simpson&#x27;s son, Alan.

A lifelong Republican, he served as Secretary to the right-leaning Natural Resources Committee and Environmental Pollution Advisory Panel of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. In 1969, Watt was appointed the deputy assistant secretary of water and power development at the Department of the Interior. In 1975, Watt was appointed vice chairman of the Federal Power Commission. 

In 1977, Watt became the first president and chief legal officer of Mountain States Legal Foundation, a public interest law firm &quot;dedicated to individual liberty, the right to own and use property, limited and ethical government and economic freedom&quot;. A number of attorneys who worked for Watt at the firm later became high-ranking officers of the federal government, including Ann Veneman and Gale Norton.

===U.S. Secretary of the Interior===
In 1980, President-elect Reagan nominated Watt as his Secretary of the Interior. The United States Senate subsequently confirmed the nomination. Greg Wetstone, the chief environment counsel at the House Energy and Commerce Committee during the Reagan administration, who subsequently served as director of advocacy at the Natural Resources Defense Council, argued that Watt was one of the two most &quot;intensely controversial and blatantly anti-environmental political appointees&quot; in American history. The other was Anne Gorsuch, director of the EPA at the time. Environmental groups accused Watt of reducing funding for environmental programs, restructuring the department to decrease federal regulatory power, wanting to eliminate the Land and Water Conservation Fund which aimed at increasing the area of wildlife refuges and other protected land, easing regulations of oil and mining, and recommending lease of wilderness and shore lands such as Santa Monica Bay to explore and develop oil and gas. Watt resisted accepting donation of private land to be used for conservation. 

Watt proposed that 80 million acres (320,000 km2) of undeveloped land in the United States all be opened for drilling and mining by 2000. The area leased to coal mining quintupled during his term as Secretary of the Interior. Watt boasted that he leased &quot;a billion acres&quot; (4 million km2) of coastal waters, even though only a small portion of that area would ever be drilled. Watt once stated, &quot;We will mine more, drill more, cut more timber.&quot; According to the Center for Biological Diversity, Watt had the record, among those who served as Secretary of the Interior, of listing the fewest species protected under the Endangered Species Act. The record was later surpassed by Dirk Kempthorne, a George W. Bush appointee, who had not listed a single species in the 15-month period since his confirmation.

Watt periodically mentioned his Dispensationalist Christian faith when discussing his method of environmental management. Speaking before Congress, he once said, &quot;I do not know how many future generations we can count on before the Lord returns, whatever it is we have to manage with a skill to leave the resources needed for future generations.&quot; One apocryphal quotation attributed to Watt is: &quot;After the last tree is felled, Christ will come back.&quot; Glenn Scherer, writing for &quot;Grist&quot; magazine, erroneously attributed this remark to 1981 testimony by Watt before Congress. Journalist Bill Moyers, relying on the &quot;Grist&quot; article, also attributed the comment to Watt. After it was discovered that the alleged quotation did not exist, &quot;Grist&quot; corrected the error, and Moyers apologized. &quot;I never said it. Never believed it. Never even thought it,&quot; Watt later wrote of the statement. &quot;I know no Christian who believes or preaches such error. The Bible commands conservation—that we as Christians be careful stewards of the land and resources entrusted to us by the Creator.&quot;

====Beach Boys concert====
From 1980 through 1982, The Beach Boys and The Grass Roots separately performed at Independence Day concerts at the National Mall in Washington, D.C., attracting large crowds. In April 1983, Watt banned the concerts, asserting that &quot;rock bands&quot; who had performed on the Mall on Independence Day in 1981 and 1982 had encouraged drug use and alcoholism and had attracted &quot;the wrong element&quot;, who would subsequently rob attendees of similar events. Watt then announced that Las Vegas singer Wayne Newton, a friend and an endorser of President Reagan and a contributor to the Republican Party, would perform at the Independence Day celebration at the mall in 1983. During the ensuing controversy, Rob Grill, lead singer of The Grass Roots, stated that he felt &quot;highly insulted&quot; by Watt&#x27;s remarks, which he termed &quot;nothing but un-American.&quot;

The Beach Boys stated that the Soviet Union, which had invited them to perform in Leningrad in 1978, &quot;obviously ... did not feel the group attracted the wrong element.&quot; Vice President George H. W. Bush said of The Beach Boys, &quot;They&#x27;re my friends, and I like their music.&quot; Watt apologized to The Beach Boys after learning that President Reagan and First Lady Nancy Reagan were fans of the band. Nancy Reagan apologized for Watt. The White House staff gave Watt a plaster foot with a hole for his &quot;having shot himself in the foot&quot;.

====Other controversies====
In early 1982, Congress voted to cite Watt in contempt due to refusing to hand over documents.

&quot;Mad&quot; magazine listed ten Watt controversies on the back cover of their October 1982 issue, under the title &quot;Watt... We Worry!&quot;

In an interview with the Satellite Program Network, Watt said, &quot;If you want an example of the failure of socialism, don&#x27;t go to Russia, come to America and go to the Indian reservations.&quot;

====Resignation====
A controversy erupted after a speech to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in September 1983, when Watt mocked affirmative action with his description of a department coal leasing panel: &quot;I have a black, a woman, two Jews and a cripple. And we have talent.&quot;

Within three weeks of making this statement, on October 9, 1983, he announced his resignation at deputy undersecretary Thomas J. Barrack&#x27;s ranch, near President Reagan&#x27;s Rancho del Cielo.

==Later life==
After leaving the Department of the Interior in 1983, Watt lobbied the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Ten years later in 1995, Watt was indicted on 18 counts of felony perjury and obstruction of justice and accused of making false statements before a federal grand jury investigating influence peddling at the Department of Housing and Urban Development at that time. On January 2, 1996, Watt pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor count of withholding documents. On March 12, 1996, he was sentenced to five years&#x27; probation and ordered to pay a fine of $5,000 and perform 500 hours of community service.

In a 2001 interview with &quot;The Denver Post&quot;, Watt applauded the energy policy of the George W. Bush administration, stating that it was just what he recommended in the early 1980s: &quot;You&#x27;ve got to have more oil, you&#x27;ve got to have more coal, you&#x27;ve got to have more of everything,&quot; Watt said. &quot;You&#x27;ve got to have more conservation too, but ... solar energy and wind energy—they&#x27;re just teeny infant portions [of energy]. You&#x27;re not going to run the world with solar energy by the year 2001, or 2002, or 2010.&quot;

In his later years, Watt lived in Wickenburg, Arizona. 

==Death==
Watt died on May 27, 2023, in Arizona, at the age of 85.

==Personal life==
Watt was a talented athlete, class valedictorian and prom king at his high school; he married his prom queen, Leilani Bomgardner, in 1957, when he was 19. They had two children. 
Watt was a member of the Assemblies of God USA.

<doc id="310049" wikidata="Q1156834" url="?curid=310049" title="Irish Recorded Music Association">
<text>The Irish Recorded Music Association (IRMA) is a non-profit association set up in 1999 to promote certain interests of the music industry in Ireland. It is particularly active in addressing copyright issues, and it compiles the official music charts for Ireland.

==Membership==
Only Irish companies can become members of the IRMA. All members pay a yearly fee based on company size. Currently, the IRMA has 51 member companies.

=== Board member companies===
The recording companies and other music-related companies that are on the IRMA board are:
*Warner Music Ireland
*Universal Music Ireland
*Sony Music Ireland (formerly Sony BMG Ireland)
*IML Irish Music Licensing Ltd
*Faction Records
*Rubyworks

==Goals and activities==
IRMA operates to promote and protect the welfare and interests of the Irish record industry. Specifically, IRMA is involved in lobbying to protect and enhance the interest of member companies and lobby to prevent illegal downloading of music content from local and international artists.

IRMA also compiles and manages Ireland&#x27;s official music charts. These include: Top 100 Albums, Top 100 Singles, Top 10 Classical Albums, Top 10 Dance Singles, Top 20 Multi-Artist Compilation Albums, Top 30 Videos, Top 20 DVDs and Top 10 Music DVDS.

In the mid-1990s IRMA presented the IRMA Music Awards. These have been replaced by the annual music awards show Meteor Ireland Music Awards.

In the past IRMA has organised &quot;The IRMA Honours,&quot; an awards ceremony which honours the life work of Ireland&#x27;s leading musicians and people who have influenced the Irish music industry. Past recipients include Bob Geldof, Larry Gogan and Christy Moore.

===Copyright issues===
On 12 April 2005, the association began to take legal action against &quot;serial filesharers&quot; in Ireland who illegally distribute music on the Internet. On 15 November 2005, the IRMA began &quot;Phase II&quot; of its plan to battle filesharing.

On 12 June 2013, IRMA secured an Order of the High Court to block access to The Pirate Bay to all internet users in Ireland.

=== Filesharing controversy ===

IRMA and Eircom reached an agreement over file sharing which uses a third-party organisation to monitor Eircom users for downloading of infringing music. The agreed system was reported to use a &quot;three-strikes-and-you&#x27;re-out&quot; system. The agreement was criticised by Digital Rights Ireland and IrelandOffline.

The association sent solicitors&#x27; letters to several organisations, including hosting service Blacknight Solutions, whose MD, Michele Neylon, made the copy sent to his company publicly available on the company site. Although Blacknight Solutions is not an ISP they still received the letter, which stated &quot;in the event of a positive response to this letter it is proposed to make practical arrangements with Blacknight of a like nature to those made with Eircom&quot;.

Protests against some actions of IRMA are being organised by Digital Rights Ireland, as well as Blackout Ireland.

== The IRMA trust ==

In 1997 the IRMA set up a trust with Phonographic Performance Ireland, with the aim to enhance the opportunities for young people who want to pursue a career in music. The trust&#x27;s main initiative is the Instrument Bank, which provides music instruments to young people, particularly to young people who live in disadvantaged communities throughout Ireland.

== Awards ==

Since July, 2021 IRMA has awarded the number one selling album and single of the week with a specially commissioned award designed by NCAD design students Katie O’Brien and Kate McKenna. The trophy design – the number one and a musical note entwined – was made using brushed aluminium and black recycled acrylic.

This award is different from the awards show presented by IRMA in the 1990s. The IRMA Music Awards were discontinued in the late 1990s replaced with the Meteor Ireland Music Awards and later the Choice Music Prize.

<doc id="310051" wikidata="Q1122677" url="?curid=310051" title="Modernisme">
<text>Modernisme (, Catalan for &quot;modernism&quot;), also known as Catalan modernism and Catalan art nouveau, is the historiographic denomination given to an art and literature movement associated with the search of a new entitlement of Catalan culture, one of the most predominant cultures within Spain. Nowadays, it is considered a movement based on the cultural revindication of a &quot;Catalan identity&quot;. Its main form of expression was Modernista architecture, but it also encompassed many other arts, such as painting and sculpture, and especially the design and the decorative arts (cabinetmaking, carpentry, forged iron, ceramic tiles, ceramics, glass-making, silver and goldsmith work, etc.), which were particularly important, especially in their role as support to architecture. Modernisme was also a literary movement (poetry, fiction, drama).

Although Modernisme was part of a general trend that emerged in Europe around the turn of the 20th century, in Catalonia the trend acquired its own unique personality. Modernisme&#x27;s distinct name comes from its special relationship, primarily with Catalonia and Barcelona, which were intensifying their local characteristics for socio-ideological reasons after the revival of Catalan culture and in the context of spectacular urban and industrial development. It is equivalent to a number of other fin de siècle art movements going by the names of Art Nouveau in France and Belgium, Jugendstil in Germany, Vienna Secession in Austria-Hungary, Liberty style in Italy, and Modern or Glasgow Style in Scotland.

Modernisme was active from roughly 1888 (the First Barcelona World Fair) to 1911 (the death of Joan Maragall, the most important &quot;Modernista&quot; poet). The &quot;Modernisme&quot; movement was centred in the city of Barcelona, though it reached far beyond, and is best known for its architectural expression, especially in the work of Antoni Gaudí, Lluís Domènech i Montaner and Josep Puig i Cadafalch, but was also significant in sculpture, poetry, theatre and painting. Notable painters include Santiago Rusiñol, Ramon Casas, Isidre Nonell, Hermen Anglada Camarasa, Joaquim Mir, Eliseu Meifrèn, Lluïsa Vidal, and Miquel Utrillo. Notable sculptors are Josep Llimona, Eusebi Arnau and Miquel Blay.

==Main concepts==

Catalan nationalism was an important influence upon &quot;Modernista&quot; artists, who were receptive to the ideas of Valentí Almirall and Enric Prat de la Riba and wanted Catalan culture to be regarded as equal to that of other European countries. Such ideas can be seen in some of Rusiñol&#x27;s plays against the Spanish army (most notably &quot;L&#x27;Hèroe&quot;), in some authors close to anarchism (Jaume Brossa and Gabriel Alomar, for example) or in the articles of federalist anti-monarchic writers such as Miquel dels Sants Oliver. They also opposed the traditionalism and religiousness of the Renaixença Catalan Romantics, whom they ridiculed in plays such as Santiago Rusiñol&#x27;s &quot;Els Jocs Florals de Canprosa&quot; (roughly, &quot;The Poetry Contest of Proseland&quot;), a satire of the revived Jocs Florals and the political milieu which promoted them.

&quot;Modernistes&quot; largely rejected bourgeois values, which they thought to be the opposite of art. Consequently, they adopted two stances: they either set themselves apart from society in a bohemian or culturalist attitude (Decadent and Parnassian poets, Symbolist playwrights, etc.) or they attempted to use art to change society (&quot;Modernista&quot; architects and designers, playwrights inspired by Henrik Ibsen, some of Maragall&#x27;s poetry, etc.)

==Architecture==

The earliest example of &quot;Modernista&quot; architecture is the Castle of the Three Dragons designed by Lluís Domènech i Montaner in the Parc de la Ciutadella for the 1888 Barcelona Universal Exposition. It is a search for a particular style for Catalonia drawing on Medieval and Arab styles. Like the currents known in other countries as Art Nouveau, Jugendstil, Liberty style, Modern Style and Vienna Secession, &quot;Modernisme&quot; was closely related to the English Arts and Crafts movement and the Gothic Revival. As well as combining a rich variety of historically-derived elements, it is characterized by the predominance of the curve over the straight line, by rich decoration and detail, by the frequent use of vegetal and other organic motifs, the taste for asymmetry, a refined aestheticism and dynamic shapes. While Barcelona was the centre of &quot;Modernista&quot; construction, the Catalan industrial bourgeoisie built industrial buildings and summer residences (&quot;cases d&#x27;estiueig&quot;) in many Catalan towns, notably Terrassa and Reus. The textile factory which is now home to the Catalan national technical museum mNACTEC is an outstanding example.

Antoni Gaudí is the best-known architect of this movement. Other influential architects were Lluís Domènech i Montaner and Josep Puig i Cadafalch, and later Josep Maria Jujol, Rafael Guastavino and Enrique Nieto.

== Architects ==

There were more than 100 architects who made buildings of the &quot;Modernista&quot; style, three of whom are particularly well known for their outstanding buildings: Antoni Gaudí, Lluís Domènech i Montaner and Josep Puig i Cadafalch.
* Antoni Gaudí, who went beyond mainstream &quot;Modernisme&quot;, creating a personal style based on observation of the nature and exploitation of traditional Catalan construction traditions. He was using regulated geometric shapes as the hyperbolic paraboloid, the hyperboloid, the helicoid and the conoide.
* Lluís Domènech i Montaner created a genuine alternative architecture. Along with Josep Vilaseca i Casanovas he worked towards a modern and international style. Domènech continued on from Viollet-le-Duc, his work characterized by a mix of constructive rationalism and ornaments inspired in the Hispano-Arab architecture as seen in the Palau de la Música Catalana, in the Hospital de Sant Pau or in the Institut Pere Mata of Reus. His Hotel Internacional at Passeig de Colom in Barcelona (demolished after the 1888 World Fair) was an early example of industrial building techniques.
* Josep Puig i Cadafalch was a Catalan architect, politician and historian who was involved in many projects to restore older buildings. One of his most well-known buildings is his rebuilding of the Casa Amatller in Passeig de Gràcia. It has elements in both the Catalan tradition and others originating in the Netherlands or the German Gothic. Neo-Gothic is also apparent in his Codorniu Winery (Caves Codorniu, 1904). He built Casa Amatller and Casa Trinxet.

=== Other architects ===
* Enric Sagnier i Villavecchia, the great builder of buildings for the bourgeoisie to the l&#x27;Eixample.
* Josep Maria Jujol i Gibert, Gaudi&#x27;s collaborator, creator of the fountain of the Plaça Espanya in Barcelona, and professor of the Escola Superior d&#x27;Arquitectura.
* Cèsar Martinell i Brunet, designer of nearly 40 wineries (The Cathedrals of the Wine), and agricultural buildings throughout southern and central Catalonia.
* Josep Vilaseca i Casanovas, author of the Arc de Triomf of Barcelona (gate entrance to the Exposition of 1888) and the Casa Pia Batlló of the Rambla Catalunya, Gran Via.
* Joan Rubió i Bellver, pupil of Domènech i Montaner and disciple and assistant of Gaudí between 1893 and 1905 to the Sagrada Família, to the Casa Batlló and the Parc Güell. He built the Casa Golferichs, the Casa Pomar and the building of the Escola Industrial.

==Literature==
In literature, &quot;Modernisme&quot; stood out the most in narrative. The &quot;nouvelles&quot; and novels of decadent writers such as Prudenci Bertrana (whose highly controversial &quot;Josafat&quot; involved a demented priest who ends up killing a prostitute), Caterina Albert (also known as Víctor Catala), author of bloody, expressionistic tales of rural violence, opposed to the idealisation of nature propugned by Catalan Romantics, or Raimon Casellas have been highly influential upon later Catalan narrative, essentially recovering a genre that had been lost due to political causes since the end of the Middle Ages. Those writers often, though not always, show influences from Russian literature of the 19th century and also Gothic novels. Still, works not influenced by those sources, such as Joaquim Ruyra&#x27;s slice-of-life tales of the North-Eastern Catalan coast are perhaps even more influential than that of the aforementioned authors, and Rusiñol&#x27;s well-known &quot;L&#x27;auca del senyor Esteve&quot; (roughly &quot;The Tale of Mr. Esteve&quot;; an &quot;auca&quot; is a type of illustrated broadside, similar to a one-sheet comic book) is an ironic critique of Catalan bourgeoisie more related to ironic, pre-Realist Catalan &quot;costumisme&quot;.

In poetry, &quot;Modernisme&quot; closely follows Symbolist and Parnassian poetry, with poets frequently crossing the line between both tendencies or alternating between them. Another important strain of &quot;Modernista&quot; poetry is Joan Maragall&#x27;s &quot;Paraula viva&quot; (&quot;Living word&quot;) school, which advocated Nietzschean vitalism and spontaneous and imperfect writing over cold and thought-over poetry. Although poetry was very popular with the &quot;Modernistes&quot; and there were many poets involved in the movement, Maragall is the only &quot;Modernista&quot; poet who is still widely read today.

&quot;Modernista&quot; theatre was also important, as it smashed the insubstantial regional plays that were popular in 19th-century Catalonia. There were two main schools of &quot;Modernista&quot; theatre: social theatre, which intended to change society and denounce injustice—the worker stories of Ignasi Iglésias, for example &quot;Els Vells&quot; (&quot;The old ones&quot;); the Ibsen-inspired works of Joan Puig i Ferreter, most notably &quot;Aigües Encantades&quot; (&quot;Enchanted Waters&quot;); Rusiñol&#x27;s antimilitaristic play &quot;L&#x27;Hèroe&quot;—and symbolist theatre, which emphasised the distance between artists and the bourgeoisie—for example, Rusiñol&#x27;s &quot;Cigales i Formigues&quot; (&quot;Cicadas and Ants&quot;) or &quot;El Jardí Abandonat&quot; (&quot;The Abandoned Garden&quot;).

==Linguistics==
&quot;Modernista&quot; ideas impelled &quot;L&#x27;Avenç&quot; collaborator Pompeu Fabra to devise a new orthography for Catalan. However, only with the later rise of Noucentisme did his projects come to fruition and end the orthographic chaos which reigned at the time.

==Decline==
By 1910, &quot;Modernisme&quot; had been accepted by the bourgeoisie and had pretty much turned into a fad. It was around this time that Noucentista artists started to ridicule the rebel ideas of &quot;Modernisme&quot; and propelled a more bourgeois art and a more right-of-centre version of Catalan Nationalism, which eventually rose to power with the victory of the Lliga Regionalista in 1912. Until Miguel Primo de Rivera&#x27;s dictatorship suppressed all substantial public use of Catalan, Noucentisme was immensely popular in Catalonia. However, &quot;Modernisme&quot; did have a revival of sorts during the Second Spanish Republic, with &quot;avant-garde&quot; writers such as Futurist Joan-Salvat Papasseit earning comparisons to Joan Maragall, and the spirit of Surrealists such as Josep Vicent Foix or Salvador Dalí being clearly similar to the rebellion of the &quot;Modernistes&quot;, what with Dalí proclaiming that Catalan Romanticist Àngel Guimerà was &quot;a putrefact pervert&quot;. However, the ties between Catalan art from the 1930s and &quot;Modernisme&quot; are not that clear, as said artists were not consciously attempting to continue any tradition.

&quot;Modernista&quot; architecture survived longer. The Spanish city of Melilla in Northern Africa experienced an economic boom at the turn of the 20th century, and its new bourgeoisie showed its riches by massively ordering &quot;Modernista&quot; buildings. The workshops established there by Catalan architect Enrique Nieto continued producing decorations in this style even when it was out of fashion in Barcelona, which results in Melilla having, oddly enough, the second-largest concentration of &quot;Modernista&quot; works after Barcelona.

<text>The Heinkel He 70 &quot;Blitz&quot; (&quot;lightning&quot;) was a fast monoplane aircraft designed and produced by the German aircraft manufacturer Heinkel Flugzeugwerke. It was the first &quot;Schnellbomber&quot; operated by the Luftwaffe.

Development of the He 70 commenced in the early 1930s in response to a request from &quot;Deutsche Lufthansa&quot; for a fast mail plane. Heinkel designed a low-wing cantilever monoplane that incorporated various measures to minimise drag, including its use of an aerodynamically efficient elliptical wing, a smooth external finish, and a retractable undercarriage. The He 70 was powered by a single nose-mounted BMW VI 7.3 Z engine and cooled via a relatively compact retractable radiator as a further drag-reducing measure. The first prototype performed its maiden flight on 1 December 1932 and set eight separate world speed records over the following months. 

The He 70 was adopted by Deutsche Lufthansa in 1934, although its commercial career was relatively brief before the type was eclipsed by larger and more capable aircraft. In addition to its civilian use, the He 70 was also adapted for military purposes, in which capacity it was flown in both the bomber and aerial reconnaissance capacities. In addition to the Luftwaffe, militarised models were operated by both the Royal Hungarian Air Force and the &quot;Ejército del Aire&quot;. The type was already relegated to secondary roles, such as training, by the outbreak of the Second World War. The He 70 is perhaps best known as being an ancestor to the Heinkel He 111, a larger bomber that featured similar elliptical wings and a streamlined fuselage. 

==Design and development==
The Heinkel He 70 &quot;Blitz&quot; (Lightning) was designed in the early 1930s as a mailplane for &quot;Deutsche Lufthansa&quot; in response to a request for an aircraft faster than the Lockheed Model 9 Orion (used by Swissair) to service short routes. While German officials initially specified a desired top speed of 250 kmph in 1931, this was subsequently superseded by an increased top speed of 320 kmph. Around this time, Germany was already experimenting with producing high-speed mail planes that could compete with American offerings; furthermore, it was generally recognised that the speed of an aircraft was a major competitive advantage over other modes of transportation. It was also recognised that to achieve such performance, engine power alone would not suffice, the airframe would have to possess favourable aerodynamic performance as well.

On 12 February 1932, a formal order was placed for the design and construction of an aircraft designated &quot;He 65&quot;, which had a guaranteed top speed of 285 kmph. However, in July of that year, it was decided to modify the design so that it could achieve a greater maximum speed; this redesign received the &quot;He 70&quot; designation. The redesigned aircraft had a guaranteed top speed of 312 kmph while maintaining identical cabin dimensions, wing loading, and landing speeds to its American-built competitors. The aircraft&#x27;s speed was prioritised over all other potential improvements.

A low-wing cantilever monoplane configuration was selected in order to achieve low drag along with a permissible fuselage cross-section for the desired cabin space, which needed to accommodate two pilots, five passengers, and their baggage. The arrangement was distinct from that of those of the rival aircraft manufacturer Junkers, possessing greater aerodynamic performance for the fuselage section in proportion to its usable cabin space. The mounting of the wing in relation to the fuselage was such that the wing&#x27;s upper surface and the side of the fuselage formed a relatively obtuse angle that had a pronounced anhedral that progressed into a dihedral in a manner that ensured sufficient lateral stability. Wing flaps were initially not used in order to save weight, increase simplicity, and pursue greater top speeds; while the aircraft maintained satisfactory landing characteristics during testing, it was decided to add compact flaps so that shorter landing strips could be used by the He 70. Various configurations were trialled.

Various wing configurations were considered, the design team having to balance pure aerodynamic performance against various other factors and characteristics, such as roll damping, weight, and the need to accommodate the retractable undercarriage. Particular care was paid to obtain a high level of torsional stiffness and a sufficient margin against any oscillations, which was a particular problem for cantilever wings. The selected wing&#x27;s profile thickness tapered considerably towards the wing tips while the camber corresponded directly with wing thickness and determined mathematically. The wing was composed of wood and had a twin-spar structure that extended into two box-shaped recesses in the fuselage where they were secured to the main frames using bolts. The ribs were made of spruce and the webs were of laminated birch while the exterior of the wing was covered in plywood. The torsional stiffness was relatively high on account of the continuous wing covering.

A spindle-shaped monocoque fuselage composed of duralumin was adopted. The longerons, bulkheads and stiffeners were all open channel sections; the combination of frame bulkheads and longitudinal channel sections permitted the presence of unobstructed compartments. The cabin extended across four primary bulkheads; all channels in close proximity to the cabin were riveted to the skin. The bulkheads themselves were not directly connected to the skin. The fuselage terminated in a series of longitudinal channels that rested on circular bulkheads and was riveted to the skin. While not particularly resistant to buckling, the amount that did occur even under high stresses was considered to be reasonably minor. Thick shell plates for conveying local stresses were only present in a few key locations, such as near to the main wing fittings.

The fuselage, wings, and control surfaces were all shell-plated and flush riveted to create a relatively smooth surface to minimize drag and help fulfil the aircraft&#x27;s demanding speed requirements. For similar reasons, all fittings, including the foot steps and door knobs, were inset and flush windows fitted. Another drag-reduction measure was the fully retractable main undercarriage that made use of the space in between the wing spars. The ailerons were precisely balanced to prevent flutter. The cantilever flight control surfaces were elliptical in planform. No wind tunnel testing was conducted prior to the completion of the first He 70 due to alleged calculation complications between models and real aircraft; several wind tunnel tests were performed after the aircraft&#x27;s completion however.

It was typically flown by a crew of two, a pilot and radio operator, who were seated in a tandem configuration in a fairly central position within the fuselage that was slightly elevated for better visibility. Visibility was further bolstered by the presence of a transparent movable cabin roof and an adjustable seat. The elevators and ailerons were actuated using wheels while the rudder was controlled using a pedal. A third seat, intended for use by a mechanic or a single passenger, was also present in the cockpit. Aft of the flight crew&#x27;s position was a compact cabin that seated up to four passengers in pairs facing each other. The passenger cabin was provisioned with air-based heating and ventilation and large windows that could be used as emergency exits. Aft of this cabin is a baggage hold.

It was powered by a single BMW VI V-12 engine, capable of producing up to at 1,600 rpm. Unusually, this engine was cooled using ethylene glycol rather than water, which enabled the use of a more compact radiator. This radiator, which was located beneath the fuselage, had one-third of the frontal surface area of a conventional counterpart and could be retracted when the aircraft was flying at high speeds to further reduce drag. The bottom of the oil tank, which was partitioned, was used for cooling; a wing pump was used for oil circulation. Both the engines and their cowlings were streamlined wherever practical to do so. the aircraft was considered to be capable of achieving even higher speeds if it were to be outfitted with more powerful engines.

On 1 December 1932, the first prototype performed its maiden flight. Flight testing proved it to possess excellent performance, setting eight world records for speed over distance, and reaching a maximum speed of .

==Operational history==
===Civil use===
Luft Hansa operated He 70s between 1934 and 1937 for a fast service which connected Berlin with Frankfurt, Hamburg and Cologne, as well as between Cologne and Hamburg. Between 1934 and 1936, the type was also flown internationally from Stuttgart to Seville; this route was part of the South American mail service provided by Luft Hansa which continued via Bathurst, The Gambia to Natal, Brazil, using Junkers Ju 52/3m and Dornier Wal flying boats.

All remaining aircraft were transferred to the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; during 1937.

===Military use===
Starting in 1935, the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; operated the He 70, initially as a light bomber and aerial reconnaissance aircraft. As soon as more capable purpose-built designs became available, it was relegated to use as a liaison and courier aircraft.

During the late 1930s, 28 aircraft were sent to Spain as part of the German-manned &quot;Legion Condor&quot;. These aircraft saw action during the Spanish Civil War, typically as fast reconnaissance aircraft. There they were known as the &quot;Rayo&quot;, Spanish for &quot;lightning&quot;.

A single example was bought by Rolls-Royce for use as an engine testbed: it continued in use until 1944.

====He 170====

The He 70K (later given the RLM number: He 170) was a fast reconnaissance airplane export variant used by the Hungarian Air Force. Powered by a Gnome-Rhône Mistral Major radial engine, the engines were built under license in Hungary as the WM-K-14, but the airframe manufacture and final assembly took place in Germany. The new engines raised the top speed of the aircraft from . 18 were used by the Royal Hungarian Air Force from 1937 to 1942.

====Weaknesses====

A major weakness of the He 70 in military use was the fire risk. Parts of the airframe were made out of an extremely flammable magnesium alloy called &quot;elektron&quot;, though the majority of the monocoque fuselage was duralumin. Elektron is very light yet strong, but burns readily when ignited and is difficult to extinguish. Moreover, each wing contained a non-self-sealing fuel tank, which may have further added to the aircraft&#x27;s reputation for catching fire.

Other problems included poor defensive armament, short range and poor view from the cabin, all of which led to the Hungarian He 170A fleet being prematurely retired and replaced with obsolescent Heinkel He 46 parasol-wing monoplanes, until Focke-Wulf Fw 189 &quot;Uhu&quot; medium altitude observation aircraft could be introduced.

==Influence==
While the He 70 saw only limited service in training capacities during the Second World War, it was the Luftwaffe&#x27;s first &quot;Schnellbomber&quot; and served as the antecedent for some of the bombers involved in the Battle of Britain.

===German designs===
The He 70 is known mainly as the ancestor to the Heinkel He 111, which had similar elliptical wings and streamlined fuselage in a twin-engined configuration. The He 111, which began service with the Luftwaffe in 1936, went on to become the most numerous bomber type of the Luftwaffe – with just over 5,600 examples produced during the war in total – in the early years of World War II.

The He 70 was essentially scaled down to produce the He 112 fighter which lost out on competition against the Messerschmitt Bf 109, but was nonetheless built in small numbers.

===Japanese designs===
An He 70 was exported to Japan for study and inspired the Aichi D3A (&quot;Val&quot;) carrier-launched light bomber. This aircraft shared the He 70&#x27;s distinctive, low-mounted elliptical wing.

===British designs===
Beverley Shenstone, R.J. Mitchell&#x27;s aerodynamic advisor denied that the Spitfire wing was copied from the He 70. Shenstone said:

The Günther brothers had already used an elliptical wing for the Bäumer Sausewind sports aircraft before they joined Heinkel.

Shenstone said that the He 70&#x27;s influence on the Spitfire design was limited to use as a benchmark for aerodynamic smoothness.

<text>The Trinovantēs (Common Brittonic: *&quot;Trinowantī&quot;) or Trinobantes were one of the Celtic tribes of Pre-Roman Britain. Their territory was on the north side of the Thames estuary in current Essex, Hertfordshire and Suffolk, and included lands now located in Greater London. They were bordered to the north by the Iceni, and to the west by the Catuvellauni. Their name possibly derives from the Celtic intensive prefix &quot;tri-&quot; and a second element which was either &quot;nowio&quot; – new, so meaning &quot;very new&quot; in the sense of &quot;newcomers&quot;, but possibly with an applied sense of vigor or liveliness ultimately meaning &quot;the very vigorous people&quot;. Their capital was Camulodunum (modern Colchester), one proposed site of the legendary Camelot.

==History==
Shortly before Julius Caesar&#x27;s invasion of Britain in 55 and 54 BC, the Trinobantes were considered the most powerful tribe in Britain. At this time their capital was probably at Braughing (in modern-day Hertfordshire). In some manuscripts of Caesar&#x27;s &quot;Gallic War&quot; their king is referred to as Imanuentius, although in other manuscripts no name is given. Some time before Caesar&#x27;s second expedition this king was overthrown by Cassivellaunus, who is usually assumed to have belonged to the Catuvellauni. Imanuentius&#x27;s son, Mandubracius, fled to the protection of Caesar in Gaul. During his second expedition Caesar defeated Cassivellaunus and restored Mandubracius to the kingship, and Cassivellaunus undertook not to molest him again. Tribute was also agreed.

The next identifiable king of the Trinovantes, known from numismatic evidence, was Addedomarus, who took power c. 20–15 BC, and moved the tribe&#x27;s capital to Camulodunum. For a brief period c. 10 BC Tasciovanus of the Catuvellauni issued coins from Camulodunum, suggesting that he conquered the Trinobantes, but he was soon forced to withdraw, perhaps as a result of pressure from the Romans, as his later coins no longer bear the mark &quot;Rex&quot;, and Addedomarus was restored. Addedomarus was briefly succeeded by his son Dubnovellaunus c. 10–5 BC, but a few years later the tribe was finally conquered by either Tasciovanus or his son Cunobelinus.

The Trinovantes reappeared in history when they participated in Boudica&#x27;s revolt against the Roman Empire in 60 AD. Their name was given to one of the &quot;civitates&quot; of Roman Britain, whose chief town was Caesaromagus (modern Chelmsford, Essex). The style of their rich burials (see facies of Aylesford) is of continental origin and evidence of their affiliation to the Belgic people.

==Mythology==
The kings of the Trinovantes are important figures in Welsh mythology and as important antecedents in the genealogies of Medieval Welsh kings. Dubnovellaunus and Mandubracius appear as Dyfnwal Moelmud (Dubnovellaunus the Bald and Silent) and Manawydan, while the Welsh Triads recall Addedomarus as Aedd Mawr (Addedo the Great) is one of the founders of Britain.

In the &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;, Geoffrey of Monmouth claimed that the Trinovantes took their name from &quot;Trinovantum&quot; (&quot;New Troy&quot;), which he states was the original name for London. Geoffrey connecting the city with Brutus, the legendary founder of Britain.

==Popular culture==
In Chelmsford 123, a British television situation comedy produced for Channel 4 by Hat Trick Productions, the main character of Badvoc (played by Rory McGrath) was the leader of The Trinovantes.

<text>Lamlash () is a village on the Isle of Arran, in the Firth of Clyde, Scotland. It lies south of the island&#x27;s main settlement and ferry port Brodick, in a sheltered bay on the island&#x27;s east coast, facing the Holy Isle. Lamlash is the seat of Arran&#x27;s local government offices, and is also the location of the island&#x27;s police station, secondary school and hospital. In common with the rest of the island, the village&#x27;s main industry is tourism and the public sector is also an important employer. Lamlash has an RNLI Lifeboat station with a B class Atlantic 75 lifeboat, covering the inshore waters around the coast of Arran, and in summer, there is a regular ferry service from Lamlash harbour to Holy Isle. The village has several buildings of historical interest, including Hamilton Terrace, which consists of two rows of single storey-and-attic cottages on the Lamlash seafront, arranged in pairs.

== History ==
A prehistoric ring of stones indicates that an ancient settlement has existed near Lamlash since antiquity. The name &quot;Lamlash&quot; dates back to the 6th Century hermitage of Saint Molaise, a Celtic monk born in Ireland but raised in Scotland, who, circa 590, spent some time in a cave on the neighbouring Holy Isle. Commonly known as &quot;MoLaise&quot; the Gaelic name of Holy Isle was, as a result, &quot;Eilean MoLaise&quot;. This gradually evolved through &quot;Elmolaise&quot; and &quot;Lemolash&quot; to Lamlash, which is what Holy Isle was called until early in the 19th century. After that time the name was more normally attached to the village that grew up facing it.

Lamlash was peripherally involved in the 13th century Battle of Largs. It was the birthplace of artist James Kay.

When Mary, Queen of Scots was at Dumbarton Castle in February 1548 during the war of the Rough Wooing, the English commander Grey of Wilton proposed basing some warships at &quot;Lammelashe&quot; to watch for French ships. Mary was taken to France. Her ship was at first forced by adverse winds to return towards the Firth of Clyde, and anchored at the &quot;roadstead of the isle of Lamlash&quot; or &quot;Lamelesche&quot; on August 6.

The village was the training place for No. 11 (Scottish) Commando during the early years of the Second World War.

== Geography ==
Lamlash is located in the southern half of the island, some to the south of Brodick and to the north of Whiting Bay. It is on the eastern side and sits on a bay facing the Holy Isle and the Firth of Clyde.

== Notable sights ==
The basic character of the village is formed by a long building line of two and three-storey roughcast or stone houses lining the inland side of the shore road. The parish church and the former St George&#x27;s church sit at either end of this series of buildings. 

===Hamilton Terrace===
Hamilton Terrace consists of two rows of single storey-and-attic cottages of which numbers 1–27 are on the Lamlash seafront, arranged in pairs. Numbers 1a–24a are positioned behind these and are probably coeval with numbers 1–27 and assumed to have been built for residents&#x27; summer occupation allowing the main houses to be let to visitors, an accepted practice in Arran. The terrace is a major architectural feature of the village, designed by Sir John James Burnet and constructed in the late 19th century. The houses have survived with minimal changes, even to their rear elevation. Some still have original glazing. One of the houses functions as the Lamlash Post Office at no 27. On the front side (seaside) the complex had two rectangular garden enclosures; one of these is currently a car park. On the lawn between the enclosures is a modern monument in remembrance of the Arran clearance emigrants in the form of three standing stones.

=== Clearances monument ===
The Clearances (Scottish Gaelic: Fuadach nan Gàidheal, the expulsion of the Gael) is a period in the 18th and 19th centuries where large forced displacements of the rural population in Scotland took place as part of a process of agricultural change. The clearances led to mass emigration to the sea coast, the Scottish Lowlands and the North American colonies. In general the Clearances on Arran seem to have been less brutal than in many other places in Scotland, but when the crofters in Glen Sannox had to make way for large-scale sheep farming, many of them saw no other option than to emigrate, and they departed from Lamlash. For this reason, Arran&#x27;s Clearance Monument is situated in Lamlash, in front of Hamilton Terrace. A plaque on the monument recalls their departure and their new life as settlers in Canada with the following words:&quot;Erected on behalf of Arran clearance descendants across North America to their brave forefathers who departed from their beloved island home to Canada during the clearance years 1829 to 1840. Here at Lamlash on April 25, 1829 part of the clearance (86 souls) when embarking on the brig Caledonia (196 ton) the Rev.A.Mackay preached from The Mound (opposite) formed by the departing his text &quot;Casting all your care upon him: for he careth for you&quot; 1st Peter ch.5 v.7. The Caledonia arrived at Quebec City June 25th 1829. The group was the first of more than 300 Arran colonists of Megantic County, Province of Quebec. The largest group, more than 400, had as their destination the seaport town of Dalhousie, New Brunswick to be pioneer settlers of the Restigouche-Bay Chaleur District. &quot;Yet still the blood is strong, the heart is highland&quot;. A chlann eilean mo ghaoil bithibh dileas d&#x27;a cheile.&quot;The monument was erected at the initiative of the Canadian descendants of the Arran emigrants.

===Churches===

St George&#x27;s United Free Church stands on the northern end of Lamlash, on Bungalow Road in the Margnaheglish neighbourhood. The church was erected between 1885-1892 in early English style by the Duke of Hamilton to replace an older church from 1774. It is built in cream-coloured sandstone and has a square stone pyramidal spire with an iron weathervane. 

The church was used by the Lamlash Free Church congregation from 1892 until the union of the Free and United Presbyterian Churches in 1900, when it became the United Free Church. From 1929 it formed one of the congregations of Lamlash Parish church at that year&#x27;s union with the Church of Scotland. The church was in use until 1947 and stands empty since. As of 2015, the building was undergoing renovation.

The Arran Theatre and Arts Trust, established in 1989 had as its main objective to convert St George&#x27;s Church into a theatre. As part of that objective, the Trust ran many events and brought touring companies to Arran, but because of &quot;wider political issues&quot; the plan never materialised. Similarly, plans to turn it into a Childhood Heritage Museum also failed in 1999. In the meantime the Scottish Civic Trust added the church to the register of &quot;Buildings at Risk&quot; in 1993. 

A chance to save the building arose in October 2004 when CRGP Architects &amp; Surveyors from Glasgow applied for permission for the conversion of the church to form 8 flats and the erection of an extension to the rear to form 6 flats with associated parking. The application was granted on 7 February 2005 by the North Ayrshire Council, subject to a number of conditions. However, the development was not realised.

In February 2007, the North Ayrshire Council commissioned ARP Lorimer and Associates (ARPL) to carry out a townscape audit for the Lamlash seafront with the specific assignment (i.a.) to evaluate the potential for the Church. In its report, ARPL considered the state of the church poor but saveable. It recommended that, as a category B listed building, the retention of this historic structure is of importance. ARPL suggested to convert the church into three apartments and to build some new development to the rear to make it financially viable (just as CRGP Architects had requested 3 years earlier), and advised the Council to encourage the owner to progress the development to ensure the building did not decline to the point where demolition is required. 

As of 2010, the building remains neglected. Minutes from the Arran Community Council show that the future of the church is a regular topic of debate, but difficulty in contacting the private owner or convincing him to cooperate seem to be (part of) the reason that there has been no progress to date.

As of October 2024, the renovation and refurbishment of the building to form 14 high quality apartments was completed.

The church&#x27;s former manse is also a category B listed building. It was built in 1898 and remained in use as manse for the united congregation until circa 1990.

Lamlash and Kilbride Parish Church and the church hall. It is a T-plan, aisleless, Gothic-style church built in 1886 by architect Hugh Barclay in red sandstone with a campanile-like tower. It replaces an earlier plain building of 1773, itself replacing the earlier Kilbride church, the remains of which survive at the present Lamlash graveyard. The cross and baptismal font in the church were both unearthed in the graveyard of the old Kilbride Church in 1892, and are thought to be of 14th-century origin. In the tower is a 9-bell carillon. The church hall, a separate, adjacent building, was built and used for worship some years before the church itself (around 1880), and included a reading room and library. It is a single storey, rectangular-plan hall, made into a T-plan by lower wings.

===The Lookout===
The Lookout was an early to mid-19th-century classical villa with prominent corner pilasters and Tudor Jacobean details, located on the main road close to the shore. It was marked as &#x27;Bank&#x27; on Ordnance Survey maps of 1868, 1897 and 1924. In October 2002, the North Ayrshire Council turned down an application by John Thomson Construction Limited (from Lamlash) to have the building demolished. It was argued that demolition would be contrary to national policy and to the Isle of Arran Local Plan as it would have an adverse impact on the Lamlash Conservation Area. The Council also considered that it had not been satisfactorily demonstrated that the Lookout could not be restored and brought back into use as advised by Historic Scotland. 

In 2004, the Scottish Civic Trust added the villa to the register of &quot;Buildings at Risk&quot;. Then, in February 2007 the North Ayrshire Council commissioned ARP Lorimer and Associates (ARPL) to carry out a townscape audit for the Lamlash seafront with the specific assignment (i.a.) to evaluate the potential for the &quot;Lookout&quot;. In its report ARPL suggested a residential conversion into four flats as the most economically viable option to save the building, but in 2009 an inspection revealed that the condition of the building had further deteriorated. The Lookout was demolished in March 2012.

===Other listed buildings===
Glenkiln, a mid-19th-century farmhouse and includes two adjoining cottages from the early 19th century.
 It is one of the two remaining farms in Lamlash (of the 7 there once were), the other one being the Clauchlands Farm.

Monamore Bridge Millhouse, an early 19th-century single storey former mill house in L-form.

Whitehouse Lodge, a late 19th-century lodge, formerly belonging to the (demolished) White House mansion. The lodge is single storey-and-attic with a basically rectangular-plan. The site of the former White House itself is now designated for development.

Bellhaven, a single storey and attic 3-bay cottage from 1808 next to the Parish Church.

Other notable buildings are the former pier house with clock tower (1885); the &#x27;Crafts Made in Arran&#x27; Shop (late 19th century); the early 19th century Pier of red rubble blocks; the Sea Gate, part of the former Steamer Pier Office (1902) and the Bay Hotel, the latter being a good example of an early Victorian villa.

===Former community centre===
Lamlash Community Centre on Benlister Road was a large former military hall from 1914. The hall (rectangular, single storey, corrugated-iron) was built by the Admiralty in 1914 as accommodation for the fleet arriving at Lamlash. It was supplied in prefabricated form, assembled on site quickly and cheaply. It comprised a canteen, reading rooms, offices, lavatories, a stage and gymnasium. Tents were erected in the surrounding playing fields for the soldiers. In 1917 the hall was converted for use as a hospital for recovering soldiers. The hall was given to the village of Lamlash after World War I on the condition that it be used again when necessary for troops. This indeed happened during World War II when it was used as a troops&#x27; canteen. The community centre was demolished in 2010 following the opening of community facilities in the new Arran High School nearby.

==Economy==
=== Employment ===
In common with the rest of the island the village&#x27;s main industry is tourism. In Lamlash the public sector is also an important employer. Fisheries is no longer important; although the Clyde was once the finest fishery in Europe it is now all but gone. There are strictly speaking no fish left in the Clyde for commercial capture and the few fishermen left are reduced to scraping the seabed for scallops and prawns.

=== Harbour and lifeboat ===
According to Glasgow&#x27;s Department of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering, Lamlash Bay is a good natural harbour offering very good shelter. It has accommodated the Royal Navy Home Fleet and Atlantic Fleet.

Lamlash has an RNLI Lifeboat station with a B class Atlantic 75 lifeboat, covering the inshore waters around the coast of Arran.
In summer, there is a regular ferry service from Lamlash harbour to Holy Isle.

=== Lamlash Bay Community Marine Protected Area ===
On 20 September 2008 the so-called &quot;Inshore Fishing Order 2008&quot; entered into effect, prohibiting commercial and recreational fishing in the northern portion of Lamlash Bay, between Holy Island and the Margnaheglish neighborhood of Lamlash. This No Take Zone (NTZ) aims to protect Maerl seaweed beds and the regeneration of all marine life. It is hoped this NTZ will benefit the Lamlash economy by attracting scuba divers and by providing bigger and better catches for fishermen in the neighbouring overspill area. The prohibition area is defined as follows: from Mount Pleasant Farm () in a straight line in a south to southeasterly direction to Holy Isle West () thence in an easterly direction around the northern end of Holy Island by the mean high water mark of ordinary spring tides to Holy Isle East (); thence by a straight line in a north to north westerly direction to Hamilton Rock (); thence in a west to northwesterly direction by a straight line to Clauchlands Point (); and thence in a west to southwesterly direction by the mean high water mark of ordinary spring tides to Mount Pleasant Farm. The area includes both the sea and the seabed.

This NTZ is the first in Scotland. It is also the first time that statutory protection has been given to a marine area as a result of proposals being developed at a grassroots level; in this case after a long campaign by the Community of Arran Seabed Trust (C.O.A.S.T.), Violation of the fishing ban can lead to an unlimited fine upon conviction on indictment. The remainder of Lamlash Bay is to become a Fisheries Management Area, focusing primarily on scallops.

Early press reports regarding the establishment of the NTZ indicated anticipation for the subsequent formation of a Fisheries Management Area. According to the C.O.A.S.T., this was expected based on assurances from the Scottish Government. However, as of May 2010, this development had not yet occurred. Furthermore, the NTZ remains unmarked, lacking any interpretation boards to inform anglers. This has led the Community of Arran Seabed Trust to call into question the government&#x27;s commitment to the overall project. The NTZ and the Fisheries Management Area would jointly have been known as the &quot;Lamlash Bay Community Marine Protected Area&quot;.

The sea surrounding the south of Arran, including Lamlash, is now recognised as one of 31 Mature Conservation Marine Protected Areas in Scotland. The designated are includes the current No Take Zone in Lamlash Bay, but is not itself a No Take Zone.

<text>The yellow-throated day gecko (Phelsuma flavigularis) is an endangered diurnal species of gecko from eastern Madagascar. It typically inhabits rainforests and dwells on trees. This endangered species feeds on insects and nectar.

== Description ==
This lizard belongs to the medium-sized day geckos. Males can reach a total length of about while females are often much smaller. The body colour is dark green or bluish green. On the snout there are two red transversal bars. One to three rust-coloured stripes may be present on the neck. On the back there are small brownish or reddish dots and spottings. The throat is light yellow and the ventral side is beige. &quot;P. flavigularis&quot; has blue eye rings.

== Distribution ==
This species has a limited distribution. It is only known from the area around Andasibe on the east coast of Madagascar, about east of Antananarivo.

== Habitat ==
&quot;P. flavigularis&quot; is found on banana trees and palms. Its original habitat are rainforests. The east coast of Madagascar has a humid and warm climate.

== Diet ==
These day geckos feed on various insects and other invertebrates. They also like to lick soft, sweet fruit; pollen; and nectar.

== Behaviour ==
Like most &quot;Phelsuma spec.&quot;, this species can be quite quarrelsome and do not accept other males in their neighbourhood. In captivity, where the females cannot escape, the males can also sometimes seriously wound a female during courtship. In this case, the male and female must be separated immediately.

== Care and maintenance in captivity ==
These animals should be housed in pairs and need a large, well planted terrarium. The temperature should be between 25 and 28 °C. The humidity should be maintained between 75 and 100%. In captivity, these animals can be fed with crickets, wax moths, fruit flies, mealworms, and houseflies.

<text>A polyphyletic group is an assemblage that includes organisms with mixed evolutionary origin but does not include their most recent common ancestor. The term is often applied to groups that share similar features known as homoplasies, which are explained as a result of convergent evolution. The arrangement of the members of a polyphyletic group is called a polyphyly . It is contrasted with monophyly and paraphyly.

For example, the biological characteristic of warm-bloodedness evolved separately in the ancestors of mammals and the ancestors of birds; &quot;warm-blooded animals&quot; is therefore a polyphyletic grouping. Other examples of polyphyletic groups are algae, C4 photosynthetic plants, and edentates.

Many taxonomists aim to avoid homoplasies in grouping taxa together, with a goal to identify and eliminate groups that are found to be polyphyletic. This is often the stimulus for major revisions of the classification schemes. Researchers concerned more with ecology than with systematics may take polyphyletic groups as legitimate subject matter; the similarities in activity within the fungus group &quot;Alternaria&quot;, for example, can lead researchers to regard the group as a valid genus while acknowledging its polyphyly. In recent research, the concepts of monophyly, paraphyly, and polyphyly have been used in deducing key genes for barcoding of diverse groups of species.

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;polyphyly&quot;, or &quot;polyphyletic&quot;, derives from the two Ancient Greek words () &#x27;many, a lot of&#x27;, and () &#x27;genus, species&#x27;, and refers to the fact that a polyphyletic group includes organisms (e.g., genera, species) arising from &quot;multiple&quot; ancestral sources.

Conversely, the term &quot;monophyly&quot;, or &quot;monophyletic&quot;, employs the ancient Greek adjective () &#x27;alone, only, unique&#x27;, and refers to the fact that a monophyletic group includes organisms consisting of all the descendants of a &quot;unique&quot; common ancestor.

By comparison, the term &quot;paraphyly&quot;, or &quot;paraphyletic&quot;, uses the ancient Greek preposition () &#x27;beside, near&#x27;, and refers to the situation in which one or several monophyletic subgroups are &quot;left apart&quot; from all other descendants of a unique common ancestor.

== Avoidance ==
In many schools of taxonomy, the recognition of polyphyletic groups in a classification is discouraged. Monophyletic groups (that is, clades) are considered by these schools of thought to be the only valid groupings of organisms because they are diagnosed (&quot;defined&quot;, in common parlance) on the basis of synapomorphies, while paraphyletic or polyphyletic groups are not. From the perspective of ancestry, clades are simple to define in purely phylogenetic terms without reference to clades previously introduced: a node-based clade definition, for example, could be &quot;All descendants of the last common ancestor of species X and Y&quot;. On the other hand, polyphyletic groups can be delimited as a conjunction of several clades, for example &quot;the flying vertebrates consist of the bat, bird, and pterosaur clades&quot;.

From a practical perspective, grouping species monophyletically facilitates prediction far more than does polyphyletic grouping. For example, classifying a newly discovered grass in the monophyletic family Poaceae, the true grasses, immediately results in numerous predictions about its structure and its developmental and reproductive characteristics, that are synapomorphies of this family. In contrast, Linnaeus&#x27; assignment of plants with two stamens to the polyphyletic class Diandria, while practical for identification, turns out to be useless for prediction, since the presence of exactly two stamens has developed convergently in many groups.

== Polyphyletic species ==
Species have a special status in systematics as being an observable feature of nature itself and as the basic unit of classification. It is usually implicitly assumed that species are monophyletic (or at least paraphyletic). However, hybrid speciation arguably leads to polyphyletic species. Hybrid species are a common phenomenon in nature, particularly in plants where polyploidy allows for rapid speciation. Some cladist authors do not consider species to possess the property of &quot;-phyly&quot;, which they assert applies only to groups of species.

<doc id="310094" wikidata="Q1292082" url="?curid=310094" title="Sore throat">
<text>Sore throat, also known as throat pain, is pain or irritation of the throat. The majority of sore throats are caused by a virus, for which antibiotics are not helpful. 

For sore throat caused by bacteria (GAS), treatment with antibiotics may help the person get better faster, reduce the risk that the bacterial infection spreads, prevent retropharyngeal abscesses and quinsy, and reduce the risk of other complications such as rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease. In most developed countries, post-streptococcal diseases have become far less common. For this reason, awareness and public health initiatives to promote minimizing the use of antibiotics for viral infections have become the focus.
Approximately 35% of childhood sore throats and 5–25% of cases in adults are caused by a bacterial infection from group A streptococcus. Sore throats that are &quot;non-group A streptococcus&quot; are assumed to be caused by a viral infection. Sore throat is a common reason for people to visit their primary care doctors and the top reason for antibiotic prescriptions by primary care practitioners such as family doctors. In the United States, about 1% of all visits to the hospital emergency department, physician office and medical clinics, and outpatient clinics are for sore throat (over 7 million visits for adults and 7 million visits for children per year).

==Causes==
Causes of sore throat include:
* viral infections
* group A streptococcal infection (GAS) bacterial infection
* pharyngitis (inflammation of the throat)
* tonsillitis (inflammation of the tonsils), or dehydration, which leads to the throat drying up.

==Definition==
A sore throat is pain felt anywhere in the throat.

==Symptoms==
Symptoms of sore throat include:
* a scratchy sensation
* pain during swallowing
* discomfort while speaking
* burning sensation
* swelling in the neck

==Diagnosis==
The most common cause (80%) is acute viral pharyngitis, a viral infection of the throat. Other causes include other bacterial infections (such as group A streptococcus or streptococcal pharyngitis), trauma, and tumors. Gastroesophageal (acid) reflux disease can cause stomach acid to back up into the throat and also cause the throat to become sore. In children, streptococcal pharyngitis is the cause of 35–37% of sore throats.

The symptoms of a viral infection and a bacterial infection may be very similar. Some clinical guidelines suggest that the cause of a sore throat is confirmed prior to prescribing antibiotic therapy and only recommend antibiotics for children who are at high risk of non-suppurative complications. A group A streptococcus infection can be diagnosed by throat culture or a rapid test:
* In order to perform a throat culture, a sample from the throat (obtained by swabbing) is cultured (grown) on a blood agar plate to confirm the presence of group A streptococcus. Throat cultures are effective for people who have a low bacterial count (high sensitivity), however, throat cultures usually take about 48 hours to obtain the results.
* Rapid tests to detect GAS (bacteria) give a positive or negative result that is usually based on a colour change on a test strip that contains a throat swab (sample). Test strips detect a cell wall carbohydrate that is specific to GAS by using an immunologic reaction. Rapid testing can be performed in the doctor&#x27;s office and usually takes 5–10 minutes for the test strip to indicate the result. Specificity for most rapid tests is approximately 95%, however sensitivity is about 85%. Although the use of rapid testing has been linked with an overall reduction in antibiotic prescriptions, further research is necessary to understand other outcomes such as safety, and when the person starts to feel better.

Clinicians often also make treatment decisions based on the person&#x27;s signs and symptoms alone. In the US, approximately two-thirds of adults and half of children with sore throat are diagnosed based on symptoms and do not have testing for the presence of GAS to confirm a bacterial infection.

Numerous clinical scoring systems (decision tools) have also been developed to support clinical decisions. Scoring systems that have been proposed include Centor&#x27;s, McIsaac&#x27;s, and the feverPAIN. A clinical scoring system is often used along with a rapid test. The scoring systems use observed signs and symptoms in order to determine the likelihood of a bacterial infection.

==Management==
Sore or scratchy throat can temporarily be relieved by gargling a solution of 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon (1.3 to 2.5 milliliters) salt dissolved in an glass of water.

Pain medications such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and paracetamol (acetaminophen) help in the management of pain. The use of corticosteroids seems to increase slightly the likelihood of resolution and the reduction of pain, but more analysis is necessary to ensure that this minimal benefit outweighs the risks. Antibiotics probably reduce pain, diminish headaches and could prevent some sore throat complications, but as these effects are small they must be balanced with the threat of antimicrobial resistance. It is not known whether antibiotics are effective for preventing recurrent sore throat.

There is only limited evidence that a hot drink can help alleviate a sore throat, and other common cold and influenza symptoms. If the sore throat is unrelated to a cold and is caused by, for example, tonsillitis, a cold drink may be helpful.

There are also other medications such as lozenges which can help soothe irritated tissues of the throat.

Without active treatment, symptoms usually last two to seven days.

==Statistics==
In the United States, there are about 2.4 million emergency department visits with throat-related complaints per year.

<text>The Homework First is a combination lock parental control device for the Nintendo Entertainment System made by SafeCare Products, Inc. of Dundee, Illinois and Master Lock. The lock features a &quot;Self-Setting&quot; combination that attaches to the open bay of a front-loading NES-001 system via a screw hole below the cartridge slot which enables the lock to grab the console like a vise to prevent both the insertion of cartridges and the removal of the device. Around 25,000 units were claimed to have been sold.

==Reception==
ACE magazine panned the device on a conceptual level during their 1989 CES coverage.

Jeuxvideo.com cited the device as one of the first video game parental controls.

<text>The Miracle Piano Teaching System is educational software which uses a MIDI keyboard to teach how to play the piano. It was published in 1990 by The Software Toolworks for the Nintendo Entertainment System, Super NES, Macintosh, Amiga, Sega Genesis, and MS-DOS compatible operating systems.

==Description==

The Miracle Piano Teaching System consists of a keyboard, connecting cables, power supply, soft foot pedals, and software. The software comes either on 3.5&quot; floppy disks for personal computers or on cartridges for video game consoles. After the supplied MIDI keyboard is connected to a console or computer and the included software is loaded, a user follows the on-screen notes. Its marketed value is as a tool to teach users to play the piano. It provides hundreds of lessons, and was advertised as the perfect adjunct to formal lessons. It was sold for US$500 and had low sales, in part due to its high price.

It was released in the United States and in multiple regions of Europe. Some of the NES Miracle keyboards were later converted for PC use and the Nintendo Seal of Quality on these boards was covered up with a piece of plastic.

With the exception of the metronome that is used in the Miracle system&#x27;s lessons, the Miracle system does not ever generate sounds through the video game console hardware. All MIDI information from the console is converted into audio by the instrument&#x27;s built-in ROM and played through the instrument&#x27;s stereo speakers, allowing the keyboard to be used independently of the console.

===Features===

Students can learn to play classic piano, rock piano, or show tunes. The Miracle system assesses the player&#x27;s ability to create custom lessons. Fun exercises were meant to make learning the piano seem less like a chore and more like playing a video game. Instead of using the traditional NES controller, the piano becomes the controller as players aim at targets in order to perfect their music skills.

There are multiple games that students can play to help teach musical skills. One game is called &quot;Robo Man&quot; where the player has to press the correct keys at the right time to create a bridge. If they miss, Robo Man falls and the player loses. In the duck hunting game, the player has to press the keys that correspond to the positions of the ducks on a musical staff to shoot them. In the &quot;Ripchord&quot; game, players must press the correct combination of keys for a chord to land paratroopers onto a target.

==Successors==
Around 1995, technology from the Miracle system was incorporated into the &quot;Piano Discovery System&quot;, an interactive PC software application that works with any MIDI keyboard including the Miracle keyboard. By 1997, the Miracle product had been discontinued in favor of the &quot;Piano Discovery System&quot;.

==Reception==

The Miracle system failed commercially with its high price of – (equivalent to US$–US$ in , depending on format), but it was overall well received by critics.

&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; liked the Miracle system&#x27;s games and graphics, describing them as &quot;not only entertaining and challenging, but they are also cleverly designed to reinforce the lessons&quot;. The magazine concluded, &quot;everything that Software Toolworks promises about this system is true [but] there is still no substitute for parental involvement&quot;. David Wesley and Gloria Barczak mentioned that the system was praised by educators and that in 1990 it was the highest-rated third-party NES title by Nintendo&#x27;s software review team. It was not well-suited to average gamers who lacked musical experience or who were not highly committed and dedicated to undertaking long-term electronic piano learning. &quot;PC Magazine&quot; mentioned the system as being easy to use and likely more patient than a live piano teacher though the system did not cover certain aspects of piano playing such as hand position. The game was reviewed in the &quot;Oppenheim Toy Portfolio Guide Book&quot; where the authors described it as &quot;by far the highest use a video-game machine has ever been put to&quot;.

NPR personality Noah Adams begins his 1997 memoir &quot;Piano Lessons&quot; attempting to teach himself how to play through the use of Miracle for PC software, ultimately finding greater success by taking more traditional lessons.

<text>Chelsea is an area in West London, England, due south-west of Charing Cross by approximately . It lies on the north bank of the River Thames and for postal purposes is part of the south-western postal area.

Chelsea historically formed a manor and parish in the Ossulstone hundred of Middlesex, which became the Metropolitan Borough of Chelsea in 1900. It merged with the Metropolitan Borough of Kensington, forming the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea upon the creation of Greater London in 1965.

The exclusivity of Chelsea as a result of its high property prices historically resulted in the coining of the term &quot;Sloane Ranger&quot; in the 1970s to describe some of its residents, and some of those of nearby areas. Chelsea is home to one of the largest communities of Americans living outside the United States, with 6.53% of Chelsea residents having been born in the U.S.

== History ==
=== Early history ===
The word &quot;Chelsea&quot; (also formerly &quot;Chelceth&quot;, &quot;Chelchith&quot;, or &quot;Chelsey&quot;,) originates from the Old English term for &quot;landing place [on the river] for chalk or limestone&quot; (&quot;Cealc-hyð&quot;: chalk-wharf, in Anglo-Saxon). Chelsea hosted the Synod of Chelsea in 787 AD. The first record of the Manor of Chelsea precedes the Domesday Book and records the fact that Thurstan, governor of the King&#x27;s Palace during the reign of Edward the Confessor (1042–1066), gave the land to the Abbot and Convent of Westminster. From at least this time, up to 1900, the Manor and Parish of Chelsea included a exclave which is now known as Kensal Town. The exclave, which was once heavily wooded, was sometimes also known as &quot;Chelsea-in-the-Wilderness&quot;.

Abbot Gervace subsequently assigned the manor to his mother, and it passed into private ownership. By 1086 the Domesday Book records that Chelsea was in the hundred of Ossulstone in Middlesex, with Edward of Salisbury as tenant-in-chief.

King Henry VIII acquired the manor of Chelsea from Lord Sandys in 1536; Chelsea Manor Street is still extant. Two of King Henry&#x27;s wives, Catherine Parr and Anne of Cleves, lived in the Manor House; Princess Elizabeth – the future Queen Elizabeth I – resided there; and Thomas More lived more or less next door at Beaufort House. In 1609 James I established a theological college, &quot;King James&#x27;s College at Chelsey&quot; on the site of the future Royal Hospital Chelsea, which Charles II founded in 1682.

By 1694, Chelsea – always a popular location for the wealthy, and once described as &quot;a village of palaces&quot; – had a population of 3,000. Even so, Chelsea remained rural and served London to the east as a market garden, a trade that continued until the 19th-century development boom which caused the final absorption of the district into the metropolis. The street crossing that was known as Little Chelsea, Park Walk, linked Fulham Road to King&#x27;s Road and continued to the Thames and local ferry down Lover&#x27;s Lane, renamed &quot;Milmans Street&quot; in the 18th century.

King&#x27;s Road, named for Charles II, recalls the King&#x27;s private road from St James&#x27;s Palace to Fulham, which was maintained until the reign of George IV. One of the more important buildings in King&#x27;s Road, the former Chelsea Town Hall, popularly known as &quot;Chelsea Old Town hall&quot; – a fine neo-classical building – contains important frescoes. Part of the building contains the Chelsea Public Library. Almost opposite stands the former Odeon Cinema, now Habitat, with its iconic façade which carries high upon it a large sculptured medallion of the now almost-forgotten William Friese-Greene, who claimed to have invented celluloid film and cameras in the 1880s before any subsequent patents.

The memorials in the churchyard of Chelsea Old Church, near the river, illustrate much of the history of Chelsea. These include Lord and Lady Dacre (1594/1595); Lady Jane Cheyne (1698); Francis Thomas, &quot;director of the china porcelain manufactory&quot;; Sir Hans Sloane (1753); Thomas Shadwell, Poet Laureate (1692). The intended tomb Sir Thomas More erected for himself and his wives can also be found there, though More is not in fact buried here.

In 1718, the Raw Silk Company was established in Chelsea Park, with mulberry trees and a hothouse for raising silkworms. At its height in 1723, it supplied silk to Caroline of Ansbach, then Princess of Wales.

Chelsea once had a reputation for the manufacture of Chelsea buns, made from a long strip of sweet dough tightly coiled, with currants trapped between the layers, and topped with sugar. The Chelsea Bun House sold these during the 18th century and was patronised by the Georgian royalty. At Easter, great crowds would assemble on the open spaces of the Five Fields – subsequently developed as Belgravia. The Bun House would then do a great trade in hot cross buns and sold about quarter of a million on its final Good Friday in 1839.

The area was also famous for its &quot;Chelsea China&quot; ware, though the works, the Chelsea porcelain factory – thought to be the first workshop to make porcelain in England – were sold in 1769, and moved to Derby. Examples of the original Chelsea ware fetch high values.

The best-known building is Chelsea Royal Hospital for old soldiers, set up by Charles II (supposedly on the suggestion of Nell Gwynne), and opened in 1694. The beautifully proportioned building by Christopher Wren stands in extensive grounds, where the Chelsea Flower show is held annually. The former Duke of York&#x27;s Barracks (built 1801–3) off King&#x27;s Road is now part of Duke of York Square, a redevelopment including shops and cafes and the site of a weekly &quot;farmers&#x27; market&quot;. The Saatchi Gallery opened in the main building in 2008. Chelsea Barracks, at the end of Lower Sloane Street, was also in use until recently, primarily by ceremonial troops of the Household Division. Situated on the Westminster side of Chelsea Bridge Road, it was bought for re-development by a property group from Qatar.

St Mark&#x27;s College, Chelsea, was founded in 1841, based on the beliefs of The Reverend Derwent Coleridge, son of the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge, its first principal: that its primary purpose was to widen the educational horizons of its students. During the First World War, St Mark&#x27;s College was requisitioned by the War Office to create the 2nd London General Hospital, a facility for the Royal Army Medical Corps to treat military casualties. It merged with St John&#x27;s College, Battersea, in 1923, establishing a single institution in Chelsea as the College of St Mark &amp; St John. In 1973 it moved to Plymouth, having outgrown the Chelsea campus. The former chapel of St Mark&#x27;s College, designed by Edward Blore is on the Fulham Road, Chelsea, and is now a private residence.

Dring the mid-1800s, Cremorne Gardens, London, was a popular pleasure gardens area established in 1845. It continued to operate until 1877. The area lay between Chelsea Harbour and the end of the King&#x27;s Road.

Chelsea&#x27;s modern reputation as a centre of innovation and influence originated in a period during the 19th century, when the area became a Victorian artists&#x27; colony (&quot;see Borough of artists below&quot;). It became prominent once again as one of the centres of the &quot;Swinging London&quot; of the 1960s, when house prices were lower than in the staid Royal Borough of Kensington.

=== The borough of artists ===

Chelsea once had a reputation as London&#x27;s bohemian quarter, the haunt of artists, radicals, painters and poets. Little of this seems to survive now – the comfortable squares off King&#x27;s Road are homes to, amongst others, investment bankers and film stars. The Chelsea Arts Club continues &quot;in situ&quot;; however, the Chelsea College of Art and Design, founded in 1895 as the Chelsea School of Art, moved from Manresa Road to Pimlico in 2005.

The Chelsea Book Club, at no. 65 Cheyne Walk (Lombard Terrace), a bookshop that also presented exhibitions and lectures, held the first exhibition of African art in London (sculpture from Ivory Coast and Congo) in 1920, and was the first bookshop to stock Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot; in 1922. Sold in 1928 owing to financial problems, it became the Lombard Restaurant.


Its reputation stems from a period in the 19th century when it became a sort of Victorian artists&#x27; colony: painters such as James Webb, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, J. M. W. Turner, James McNeill Whistler, William Holman Hunt, and John Singer Sargent all lived and worked here. There was a particularly large concentration of artists in the area around Cheyne Walk and Cheyne Row, where the Pre-Raphaelite movement had its heart. The artist Prunella Clough was born in Chelsea in 1919.

The architect John Samuel Phene lived at No. 2 Upper Cheyne Row between 1903 and his death in 1912. He installed numerous artefacts and objets d&#x27;art around the house and gardens and it was known locally as the &quot;Gingerbread Castle&quot;. It was demolished in 1924.

Chelsea was also home to writers such as George Meredith, Algernon Charles Swinburne, Leigh Hunt and Thomas Carlyle. Jonathan Swift lived in Church Lane, Richard Steele and Tobias Smollett in Monmouth House. Carlyle lived for 47 years at No. 5 (now 24) Cheyne Row. After his death, the house was bought and turned into a shrine and literary museum by the Carlyle Memorial Trust, a group formed by Leslie Stephen, father of Virginia Woolf. Virginia Woolf set her 1919 novel &quot;Night and Day&quot; in Chelsea, where Mrs. Hilbery has a Cheyne Walk home.

In a book, &quot;Bohemia in London&quot; by Arthur Ransome which is a partly fictional account of his early years in London, published in 1907 when he was 23, there are some fascinating, rather over-romanticised accounts of bohemian goings-on in the quarter. The American artist Pamela Colman Smith, the designer of A. E. Waite&#x27;s Tarot card pack and a member of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, features as &quot;Gypsy&quot; in the chapter &quot;A Chelsea Evening&quot;.

A central part of Chelsea&#x27;s artistic and cultural life was Chelsea Public Library, originally situated in Manresa Road. Its longest-serving member of staff was Armitage Denton, who joined in 1896 at the age of 22, and he remained there until his retirement in 1939; he was appointed Chief Librarian in 1929. In 1980, the building was purchased by Chelsea College of Art and Design.

The Chelsea Society, formed in 1927, remains an active amenity society concerned with preserving and advising on changes in Chelsea&#x27;s built environment. Chelsea Village and Chelsea Harbour are new developments outside of Chelsea itself.

=== Swinging Chelsea ===
Chelsea shone again, brightly but briefly, in the 1960s Swinging London period and the early 1970s. The Swinging Sixties was defined on King&#x27;s Road, which runs the length of the area. The Western end of Chelsea featured boutiques Granny Takes a Trip and The Sweet Shop, the latter of which sold medieval silk velvet caftans, tabards and floor cushions, with many of the cultural cognoscenti of the time being customers, including Twiggy and many others.

The &quot;Chelsea girl&quot; was a symbol, media critic John Crosby wrote, of what &quot;men [found] utterly captivating&quot;, flaunting a life is fabulous&#x27; philosophy&quot;. Chelsea at this time was home to the Beatles and to Rolling Stones members Brian Jones, Mick Jagger, and Keith Richards. In the 1970s, the World&#x27;s End area of King&#x27;s Road was home to Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood&#x27;s boutique &quot;SEX&quot; (at Number 430, the King&#x27;s Road), and saw the birth of the British punk movement.

===1974 bombings===
On 27 November 1974, the London unit of the Provisional Irish Republican Army exploded twin bombs on Tite Street, injuring 20 people.

===Administrative history===
Chelsea Manor was served by the ancient parish of Chelsea. (Such parish units were typically in place by the end of the twelfth century with their boundaries, based on those of the constituent manor or manors, rarely if ever changing.) The manor and parish formed part of the Ossulstone Hundred of the county of Middlesex.


The area covered by the civil parish became the Metropolitan Borough of Chelsea in 1900, part of a new County of London. At that time, the exclave of Kensal Town, which had been part of Chelsea since at least the time of the 11th-century Saxon King Edward the Confessor, was removed from Chelsea and divided between the new boroughs of Kensington and Paddington (each of which was otherwise based on its corresponding ancient parish). The parliamentary constituency of Chelsea, which was identical to the parish, retained Kensal Town until 1918.

In 1965 the area merged with the Metropolitan Borough of Kensington to form the modern London Borough of Kensington and Chelsea.

==Geography==
The parish and borough of Chelsea, which now forms the southern part of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, was bounded by rivers on three sides with Fulham Road forming part of its northern boundary with Kensington.

The eastern boundary with Westminster was formed by the River Westbourne, but was adjusted to follow Chelsea Bridge Road after the river was culverted.

The short western boundary with Fulham was formed by the former Counter&#x27;s Creek, of which the mouth - Chelsea Creek - is the only surviving part, with the river&#x27;s route now used by the West London Line. Chelsea Football Club&#x27;s Stamford Bridge home, lies just west of the Counter&#x27;s Creek in Fulham, and takes its name from a bridge which carried the Fulham Road over the river. The bridge was also known as Little Chelsea Bridge.

The southern Thames frontages run west from Chelsea Bridge along the Chelsea Embankment past Albert Bridge and Battersea Bridge to Chelsea Creek. Lots Road is a major landmark on the Chelsea side of the confluence of Chelsea Creek and the Thames.
Chelsea also gives its name to nearby locations, such as Chelsea Harbour in the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham, and Chelsea Barracks in the City of Westminster. Chelsea includes large parts of the SW3 and SW10 postal districts, and a small section of SW1.

This former fashionable village was absorbed into London during the eighteenth century. Many notable people of 18th-century London, such as the bookseller Andrew Millar, were both married and buried in the district.

King&#x27;s Road is one of the district&#x27;s major thoroughfares, a street which despite its continuing reputation as a shopping mecca, is now home to many of the same shops found on other British high streets, such as Gap, and McDonald&#x27;s. Sloane Street and its environs is quickly catching up with Bond Street as one of London&#x27;s premier shopping destinations, housing a variety of high-end fashion or jewellery boutiques such as Cartier, Tiffany &amp; Co, Dolce &amp; Gabbana, Prada, Gucci, Harrods, Dior, Louis Vuitton, Jimmy Choo, Giorgio Armani, Yves Saint Laurent, Chanel, Valentino, Bvlgari, Gianni Versace and Graff.

As well as a number of garden squares, Chelsea has several open spaces including Albert Bridge Gardens, Battersea Bridge Gardens, Chelsea Embankment Gardens, the Royal Hospital Chelsea (the grounds of which are used by the annual Chelsea Flower Show) and Chelsea Physic Garden.

==Sport==
In the 18th century, Chelsea Cricket Club was prominent for a time and played its home matches on what was then Chelsea Common, an area that virtually disappeared under building work in the 19th century. Records have survived of five matches between 1731 and 1789 which involved the Chelsea club and/or were played on the common.

Chelsea Football Club is located at Stamford Bridge in neighbouring Fulham, adjacent to the border with Chelsea. As a result of Chelsea&#x27;s expensive location and wealthy residents, Chelsea F.C. has the wealthiest local supporters in England.

==Transport==

===Buses===

Chelsea is served by many Transport for London bus services.

===Tube and rail===
Chelsea has no Underground station, but there are two stations close to its boundary; Sloane Square to the east and Gloucester Road to the north (both of these on the District and Circle lines). In addition, to the west is the London Overground station Imperial Wharf, on the West London Line.

A Chelsea railway station (later renamed &quot;Chelsea and Fulham&quot;) previously existed on this line, located between the King&#x27;s Road and the Fulham Road in neighbouring Fulham, but this was closed in 1940 following World War II bomb damage and later demolished.

There is a proposal to construct a Chelsea Underground station on the King&#x27;s Road as part of the Crossrail 2 project (also known as the &quot;Chelsea-Hackney line&quot;). The project, run by Transport for London, has not yet been approved or funded but is at the consultation stage. According to plans published by TfL in 2008, it is envisaged that the station would be located on the Dovehouse Green area of King&#x27;s Road. In late 2020 central government shelved plans to progress the Crossrail 2 project.

<doc id="310123" wikidata="Q353754" url="?curid=310123" title="Paul de Man">
<text>Paul de Man (; December 6, 1919 – December 21, 1983), born Paul Adolph Michel Deman, was an American literary critic and literary theorist. He was known particularly for his importation of German and French philosophical approaches into Anglo-American literary studies and critical theory. Along with Jacques Derrida, he was part of an influential critical movement that went beyond traditional interpretation of literary texts to reflect on the epistemological difficulties inherent in any textual, literary, or critical activity. This approach aroused considerable opposition, which de Man attributed to &quot;resistance&quot; inherent in the difficult enterprise of literary interpretation itself.

After his death, de Man became a subject of further controversy when his history of writing pro-Nazi and anti-Jewish propaganda for the wartime edition of &quot;Le Soir&quot;, a major Belgian newspaper during German occupation, came to light.

==Early life and education==
Paul de Man was born to a family of artisans of nineteenth-century Belgium and by the time of his birth, his family was prominent among the new bourgeoisie in Antwerp. He was the son of Robert de Man, a manufacturer and Magdalena de Braey. His maternal great-grandfather was the noted Flemish poet Jan Van Beers, and the family spoke French at home. His uncle Henri de Man (Dutch: Hendrik) was a famous socialist theorist and politician, who became a Nazi-collaborator during World War II. He played an important part in the decisions made by De Man during the Nazi occupation of Belgium. Paul&#x27;s father, Robert (&quot;Bob&quot;) de Man, was a moderately successful businessman whose firm manufactured X-ray equipment. De Man&#x27;s father and his mother, Madeleine, who were first cousins, married over the family&#x27;s opposition. The marriage proved unhappy.

De Man&#x27;s early life was difficult and shadowed by tragedy. His mother Madeleine&#x27;s first pregnancy with her oldest son Hendrik (&quot;Rik,&quot; b. 1915) coincided with the intense German bombings of World War I and strained her physical and mental health. The stillbirth of a daughter two years later pushed her into intermittent but lifelong suicidal depression. She was psychologically fragile and had to be watched. The family walked on eggshells and &quot;Bob&quot; de Man found solace with other women. In contrast to Rik, who was backward and a failure in school, Paul dealt with his difficult home life by becoming a brilliant student and accomplished athlete. He was enrolled in the Dutch-speaking cohort of boys admitted to the prestigious and highly competitive Royal Athenaeum of Antwerp. There, he followed his father&#x27;s career path in choosing to study science and engineering, consistently receiving top marks in all subjects and graduating at the top of his class. He took no courses in literature or philosophy but developed a strong extracurricular interest in both as well as in religious mysticism. In 1936, his brother Rik de Man was killed at the age of 21 when his bicycle was struck by a train at a railroad crossing. The following year, it was Paul, then seventeen, who discovered the body of their mother, who had hanged herself a month before the anniversary of Rik&#x27;s death.

That fall Paul enrolled in the Free University of Brussels. He wrote for student magazines and continued to take courses in science and engineering. For stability he turned to his uncle Henri as a patron and surrogate emotional father, later on several occasions telling people Henri was his real father and his real father was his uncle. He fathered a son with Romanian-born Anaïde Baraghian, the wife of his good friend, Gilbert Jaeger. They lived in a &quot;ménage à trois&quot; until August 1942, when Baraghian left her husband. Paul married her in 1944, and the couple had two more sons together.

De Man, Baraghian and Jaeger fled to the south of France near the Spanish border when the Nazis occupied Belgium in 1940. Henri, who by then was a self-avowed fascist, welcomed the Nazi invaders, whom he saw as essential for instituting his brand of socialism. For a year, Henri de Man was appointed as de facto puppet Prime Minister of Belgium under the Nazis. Some believed that he used his influence to secure his nephew a position as an occasional cultural critic for &quot;Le Soir&quot;, the influential Belgian French-language newspaper. After contributing an essay, &quot;The Jews in Present-Day Literature&quot;, to &quot;Le Soir volé&quot;&#x27;s notorious anti-Semitic attack of March 4, 1941, de Man became its official book reviewer and a cultural critic. Later he contributed to the Flemish daily &quot;Het Vlaamsche Land&quot;; both publications were vehemently anti-Semitic when under Nazi control. As a cultural critic, de Man would contribute hundreds of articles and reviews to these publications. His writings supported the Germanic ideology and the triumph of Germany in the war, while never referring directly to Hitler himself. In spite of that he maintained friendships with individual Jews.

Holding three different jobs, de Man became very highly paid, but he lost all three between November 1942 and April 1943, failures that resulted from a combination of losing a coup he had launched against one employer and his own incompetence as a businessman at another. After this, de Man went into hiding; the Belgian Resistance had now begun assassinating prominent Belgian pro-Nazis. He had lost his protection in late 1942, when Henri, mistrusted by his collaborators on the right and himself marked for death as a traitor by the Belgian Resistance, went into exile.

De Man spent the rest of the war in seclusion reading American and French literature and philosophy and organizing a translation into Dutch of &quot;Moby Dick&quot; by Herman Melville, which he published in 1945. He would be interrogated by prosecutor Roger Vinçotte, but not charged after the war. Henri de Man was tried and convicted &quot;in absentia&quot; for treason; he died in Switzerland in 1953, after crashing his car into an oncoming train, an accident that was almost certainly a suicide.

==Post-war years==
In 1948, de Man left Belgium and emigrated to New York City. He had fled as an exile to avoid what became two trials for criminal and financial misdeeds (thefts of money from investors in a publishing company he ran) for which he was convicted &quot;in absentia&quot; to five years of imprisonment and heavy fines. Baraghian sailed with their three young sons to Argentina, where her parents had recently immigrated. De Man found work stocking books at the Doubleday Bookstore at New York City&#x27;s Grand Central Station. From there he wrote to his friend Georges Bataille, a French philosopher, and through him, he met Dwight Macdonald, a key figure on the New York intellectual and literary scene. At Macdonald&#x27;s apartment, de Man met the celebrated novelist Mary McCarthy. McCarthy recommended de Man to her friend Artine Artinian, a professor of French at Bard College, as a temporary replacement while Artinian spent the academic year 1949–50 in France as a Fulbright fellow.

De Man was to teach Mr. Artinian&#x27;s courses, advise Mr. Artinian&#x27;s advisees, and move into Mr. Artinian&#x27;s house. By December [1949], de Man had married one of the advisees, a French major named Patricia Kelley, and when the first Mrs. de Man turned up with their three young boys, Hendrik, Robert, and Marc, in the spring of 1950, Patricia de Man [sic] was pregnant.

De Man persuaded the devastated Baraghian to accept a sum of money, agree to a divorce, and return to Argentina. She, however, surprised him when she left the eldest boy with him, while he surprised her when his first check proved worthless. The boy was raised by Kelley&#x27;s parents while she took the younger ones back to Argentina with a promise of child support that de Man was never to honor.

A heavily fictionalized account of this period of de Man&#x27;s life is the basis of Henri Thomas&#x27;s 1964 novel &quot;Le Parjure&quot; (&quot;The Perjurer&quot;). His life also provides the basis for Bernhard Schlink&#x27;s 2006 novel, translated as &quot;Homecoming&quot;. De Man married Kelley a first time in June 1950, but did not tell her that he had not actually gotten a divorce and that the marriage was bigamous. They underwent a second marriage ceremony in August 1960, when his divorce from Baraghian was finalized, and later had a third ceremony in Ithaca. In addition to their son, Michael, born while the couple was at Bard College, they had a daughter, Patsy. The couple remained together until de Man&#x27;s death, aged 64, in New Haven, Connecticut.

==Academic career==

The de Mans moved to Boston, where Paul earned money teaching conversational French at Berlitz and did translations assisted by Patricia de Man; he also gave private French lessons to Harvard student Henry Kissinger, then running a small center and publication of his own. There, de Man met Harry Levin, the Harvard Professor of Comparative Literature, and &quot;was invited to join an informal literary seminar that met at Levin&#x27;s house (alongside, e.g., George Steiner and John Simon). By the fall of 1952, he was officially admitted to graduate study in comparative literature.&quot; In 1954 someone sent Harvard an anonymous letter denouncing de Man as a wartime collaborator and questioning his immigration status (a letter not surviving, and known only on the basis of de Man&#x27;s response to it). According to Harvard faculty members, de Man offered a thorough and more than satisfactory account of his immigration status and the nature of his political activities. While he was writing his dissertation, de Man was awarded a prestigious appointment at the Harvard Society of Fellows. In 1960, because his thesis was unsatisfactory to his mentors on several counts, and especially its philosophical approach, they were prepared to dismiss him, but he moved immediately to an advanced position at Cornell University, where he was highly valued.

He began his teaching career in the United States at Bard College where he taught French literature. He completed his Ph.D. at Harvard University in 1960, then taught at Cornell University, Johns Hopkins University, and the University of Zurich. He joined the faculty in French and Comparative Literature at Yale University, where he was considered part of the Yale School of Deconstruction. At the time of his death from cancer, he was Sterling Professor of the Humanities and chairman of the Department of Comparative Literature at Yale. De Man oversaw the dissertations of Gayatri Spivak (at Cornell), Barbara Johnson (at Yale), Samuel Weber (at Cornell), and many other noted scholars.

Peter Brooks, who was de Man&#x27;s undergraduate student at Harvard, and later became his friend and colleague at Yale, wrote that rather than brand de Man as a confidence man, as his critics were inclined to do:

One might consider this a story of remarkable survival and success following the chaos of war, occupation, postwar migration, and moments of financial desperation: without any degrees to his name, de Man had impressed, among others, Georges Bataille, Macdonald, McCarthy, and Levin, and entered the highest precincts of American academia. During the following decade, he contributed nine articles to the newly established &quot;New York Review&quot;: astute and incisive short essays on major European writers—Hölderlin, Gide, Camus, Sartre, Heidegger, as well as Borges—that display notable cultural range and critical poise.

In 1966, de Man attended a conference on structuralism held at Johns Hopkins University, where Jacques Derrida delivered his celebrated essay, &quot;Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences&quot;; de Man and Derrida soon became fast friends. Both were to become identified with Deconstruction. De Man came to reflect the influence primarily of Heidegger and used deconstruction to study Romanticism, both English and German, as well as French literature, specifically the works of William Wordsworth, John Keats, Maurice Blanchot, Marcel Proust, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Friedrich Nietzsche, Immanuel Kant, G .W. F. Hegel, Walter Benjamin, William Butler Yeats, Friedrich Hoelderlin, and Rainer Maria Rilke.

Following an appointment to a professorship in Zürich, de Man returned to the United States in the 1970s to teach at Yale University, where he served for the rest of his career. At the time of his death of cancer at age 64, he was a Sterling Professor and chairman of the department of comparative literature at Yale.

After his death, a researcher uncovered some two hundred previously unknown articles which de Man had written in his early twenties for Belgian collaborationist newspapers during World War II, some of them implicitly and two explicitly anti-Semitic. These, in combination with revelations about his domestic life and financial history, caused a scandal and provoked a reconsideration of his life and work.

==Contributions to literary theory==

Although de Man&#x27;s work in the 1960s differs from his later deconstructive endeavors, considerable continuity can also be discerned. In his 1967 essay &quot;Criticism and Crisis&quot; (included as the first chapter of &quot;Blindness and Insight&quot;), he argues that because literary works are understood to be fictions rather than factual accounts, they exemplify the break between a sign and its meaning: literature &quot;means&quot; nothing, but critics resist this insight:

When modern critics think they are demystifying literature, they are in fact being demystified by it. But since this necessarily occurs in the form of a crisis, they are blind to what takes place within themselves. What they call anthropology, linguistics, psychoanalysis, is nothing but literature reappearing like the hydra&#x27;s head in the very spot where it had been suppressed. The human mind will go through amazing feats to avoid facing &#x27;the nothingness of human matters&#x27;.

De Man would later observe that, due to this resistance to acknowledging that literature does not &quot;mean&quot;, English departments had become &quot;large organizations in the service of everything except their own subject matter&quot; (&quot;The Return to Philology&quot;). He said that the study of literature had become the art of applying psychology, politics, history, philology, or other disciplines to the literary text, in an effort to make the text &quot;mean&quot; something.

Among the central threads running through de Man&#x27;s work is his attempt to tease out the tension between rhetoric (which de Man uses as a term to mean figural language and trope) and meaning, seeking moments in the text where linguistic forces &quot;tie themselves into a knot which arrests the process of understanding.&quot; De Man&#x27;s earlier essays from the 1960s, collected in &quot;Blindness and Insight&quot;, represent an attempt to seek these paradoxes in the texts of New Criticism and move beyond formalism. One of De Man&#x27;s central topoi is of the blindness on which these critical readings are predicated, that the &quot;insight seems instead to have been gained from a negative movement that animates the critic&#x27;s thought, an unstated principle that leads his language away from its asserted stand...as if the very possibility of assertion had been put into question.&quot; Here de Man tries to undercut the notion of the poetic work as a unified, atemporal icon, a self-possessed repository of meaning freed from the intentionalist and affective fallacies. In de Man&#x27;s argument, formalist and New Critical valorization of the &quot;organic&quot; nature of poetry is ultimately self-defeating: the notion of the verbal icon is undermined by the irony and ambiguity inherent within it. Form ultimately acts as &quot;both a creator and undoer of organic totalities&quot;, and &quot;the final insight...annihilated the premises which led up to it.&quot;

In &quot;Allegories of Reading&quot;, de Man further explores the tensions arising in figural language in Nietzsche, Rousseau, Rilke, and Proust. In these essays, he concentrates on crucial passages which have a metalinguistic function or metacritical implications, particularly those where figural language has a dependency on classical philosophical oppositions (essence/accident, /, appearance/reality) which are so central to Western discourse. Many of the essays in this volume attempt to undercut figural totalization, the notion that one can control or dominate a discourse or phenomenon through metaphor. In de Man&#x27;s discussion of Nietzsche&#x27;s &quot;The Birth of Tragedy&quot;, for instance, he claims that &quot;genetic&quot; conceptions of history appearing in the text are undercut by the rhetorical strategies Nietzsche employs: &quot;the deconstruction does not occur between statements, as in a logical refutation or a dialectic, but happens instead between, on the one hand, metalinguistic statements about the rhetorical nature of language and, on the other hand, a rhetorical praxis that puts these statements into question.&quot; For de Man, an &quot;allegory of reading&quot; emerges when texts are subjected to such scrutiny and reveal this tension; a reading wherein the text reveals its own assumptions about language, and in so doing dictates a statement about undecidability, the difficulties inherent in totalization, their own readability, or the &quot;limitations of textual authority.&quot;

De Man is also known for his readings of English and German Romantic and post-Romantic poetry and philosophy (&quot;The Rhetoric of Romanticism&quot;), and concise and deeply ironic essays. Specifically noteworthy is his critical dismantling of the Romantic ideology and the linguistic assumptions which underlie it. His arguments are outlined below. First, de Man seeks to deconstruct the privileged claims in Romanticism of symbol over allegory, and metaphor over metonymy. In his reading, because of the implication of self-identity and wholeness which is inherent in the Romantics&#x27; conception of metaphor, when this self-identity decomposes, so also does the means of overcoming the dualism between subject and object, which Romantic metaphor sought to transcend. In de Man&#x27;s reading, to compensate for this inability, Romanticism constantly relies on allegory to attain the wholeness established by the totality of the symbol.

In addition, in his essay &quot;The Resistance to Theory&quot;, which explores the task and philosophical bases of literary theory, de Man uses the example of the classical &quot;trivium&quot; of grammar, rhetoric, and logic to argue that the use of linguistic sciences in literary theory and criticism (i.e. a structuralist approach) was able to harmonize the logical and grammatical dimension of literature, but only at the expense of effacing the rhetorical elements of texts which presented the greatest interpretive demands. He posits that the resistance to theory is the resistance to reading, thus the resistance to theory is theory itself. Or the resistance to theory is what constitutes the possibility and existence of theory. Taking up the example of the title of Keats&#x27;s poem &quot;The Fall of Hyperion&quot;, de Man draws out an irreducible interpretive undecidability which bears strong affinities to the same term in Derrida&#x27;s work and some similarity to the notion of incommensurability as developed by Jean-François Lyotard in &quot;The Postmodern Condition&quot; and &quot;The Differend&quot;. De Man argues that the recurring motive of theoretical readings is to subsume these decisions under theoretical, futile generalizations, which are displaced in turn by harsh polemics about theory.

==Influence and legacy==
De Man&#x27;s influence on literary criticism was considerable, in part through his numerous and vocal disciples. Although much of his work brought to bear insights on literature drawn from German philosophers such as Kant and Heidegger, de Man also closely followed developments in contemporary French literature, criticism, and theory.

Much of de Man&#x27;s work was collected or published posthumously, for instance in his book &quot;Resistance to Theory&quot; which he complete shortly before his death, and a collection of essays, edited by his former Yale colleague Andrzej Warminski, was published by the University of Minnesota Press in 1996 under the title &quot;Aesthetic Ideology&quot;.

==Wartime journalism and posthumous controversies==

In August 1987, Ortwin de Graef, a Belgian graduate student at the University of Leuven, discovered some two hundred articles, including anti-semitic pieces, which de Man had written during World War II for &quot;Le Soir&quot;, a Nazi-controlled newspaper. In 1988, a conference on Paul de Man took place at the University of Antwerp. &quot;On the last day, Jean Stengers, a historian at the Free University of Brussels, addressed a topic pointedly titled: &quot;Paul de Man, a Collaborator?&quot; Then Georges Goriely, professor emeritus of sociology at the Free University of Brussels, rose to deliver what he called &quot;A Personal Testimony&quot;:

M. Goriely began by extolling de Man, whom he had known intimately in his youth, as &quot;a charming, humorous, modest, highly cultured&quot; &quot;homme de lettres&quot; renowned in Belgian literary circles during their youth. Then the professor dropped his bombshell. De Man, he asserted, wasn&#x27;t all that he appeared to be. He was &quot;completely, almost pathologically, dishonest,&quot; a crook who had bankrupted his family. &quot;Swindling, forging, lying were, at least at the time, second nature to him.&quot; 

The European press was in an uproar: &quot;There were stories in La &quot;Quinzaine Litteraire&quot;, the &quot;Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung&quot;, The &quot;(Manchester) Guardian&quot;. &quot;Newsweek&quot; juxtaposed a photograph of de Man with another of Nazis on the march. &quot;Le Soir&quot; described him as &#x27;an academic Waldheim.&quot;

De Man&#x27;s disciples tried to portray the attacks on de Man as a cover for his critics&#x27; dislike of deconstruction, alleging that the attacks were a ruse that used de Man&#x27;s youthful errors as evidence of what they considered the decadence at the heart of the Continental thought behind de Man and his theories. The controversies quickly spread from the pages of scholarly journals to the broader media. &quot;The Chronicle of Higher Education&quot; and the front page of &quot;The New York Times&quot; exposed the sensational details of de Man&#x27;s personal life, particularly the circumstances of his marriage and his difficult relationships with his children.

In the most controversial and explicitly anti-semitic essay from this wartime journalism, titled &quot;Jews in Contemporary Literature&quot; (1941), de Man described how &quot;[v]ulgar anti-semitism willingly takes pleasure in considering post-war cultural phenomenon (after the war of 14–18) as degenerate and decadent because they are [enjewished].&quot; He notes that

Literature does not escape this lapidary judgement: it is sufficient to discover a few Jewish writers under Latinized pseudonyms for all contemporary production to be considered polluted and evil. This conception entails rather dangerous consequences ... it would be a rather unflattering appreciation of western writers to reduce them to being mere imitators of a Jewish culture which is foreign to them.

The article claimed that contemporary literature had not broken from tradition as a result of the First World War and that

the Jews cannot claim to have been its creators, nor even to have exercised a preponderant influence over its development. On any closer examination, this influence appears to have extraordinarily little importance since one might have expected that, given the specific characteristics of the Jewish Spirit, the later would have played a more brilliant role in this artistic production.

The article concluded that &quot;our civilization...[b]y keeping, in spite of Semitic interference in all aspects of European life, an intact originality and character...has shown that its basic character is healthy.&quot; It concluded that &quot;the creation of a Jewish colony isolated from Europe&quot; as &quot;a solution to the Jewish problem&quot; would not entail any &quot;deplorable consequences&quot; for &quot;the literary life of the west.&quot; This is the only known article in which de Man pronounced such views so openly, though two or three other articles also accept without demurral the disenfranchisement and ostracization of Jews, as some contributors to &quot;Responses&quot; have noted.

De Man&#x27;s colleagues, students, and contemporaries tried to respond to his early writings and his subsequent silence about them in the volume &quot;Responses: On Paul de Man&#x27;s Wartime Journalism&quot; (edited by Werner Hamacher, Neil Hertz, and Thomas Keenan; Nebraska, 1989). His longtime friend, Jacques Derrida, who was Jewish, published a long piece responding to de Man&#x27;s critics, declaring:

To judge, to condemn the work or the man on the basis of what was a brief episode, to call for closing, that is to say, at least figuratively, for censuring or burning his books is to reproduce the exterminating gesture which one accuses de Man of not having armed himself against sooner with the necessary vigilance. It is not even to draw a lesson that he, de Man, learned to draw from the war.

Some readers objected to what they considered as Derrida&#x27;s effort to relate criticism of de Man to the greater tragedy of extermination of the Jews.

Fredric Jameson lengthily defended de Man in &quot;Postmodernism, or, the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism&quot; (1991), observing about de Man&#x27;s critics that &quot;it does not seem to me that North American intellectuals have generally had the kind of experience of history that would qualify them to judge the actions and choices of people under military occupation.&quot; According to Jameson, the efforts to implicate de Man in the Holocaust hinged on a fundamental misunderstanding of Nazi anti-Semitism:

The exclusive emphasis on anti-Semitism ignores and politically neutralizes its other constitutive feature in the Nazi period: namely, anticommunism. [The] very possibility of the Judeocide was absolutely at one with and inseparable from the anticommunist and radical right-wing mission of National Socialism... But put this way, it seems at once clear that DeMan was neither an anticommunist nor a right-winger: had he taken such positions in his student days..., they would have been public knowledge.

Turning to the content and ideology of de Man&#x27;s wartime journalism, Jameson contended that it was &quot;devoid of any personal originality or distinctiveness&quot;, simply rehearsing corporatist commonplaces found in a broad range of European political movements. From this, Jameson concluded that none of the wartime articles &quot;had any relevance to Paul De Man, for whom the thing dramatically called &#x27;collaboration&#x27; was simply a job, in a Europe henceforth and for the foreseeable future united and German, and who as long as I knew him personally was simply a good liberal.&quot;

Since the late 1980s, some of de Man&#x27;s followers, many of them Jewish, have pointed out that de Man at no time in his life displayed personal animus against Jews. Shoshana Felman, recounted that

about a year after the journalistic publication of his compromising statement, he and his wife sheltered for several days in their apartment the Jewish pianist Esther Sluszny and her husband, who were then illegal citizens in hiding from the Nazis. During this same period, de Man was meeting regularly with Georges Goriely, a member of the Belgian Resistance. According to Goriely&#x27;s own testimony, he never for one minute feared denunciation of his underground activities by Paul de Man.

Jameson proposed that de Man&#x27;s apparent anti-Semitism was suffused with irony and, properly interpreted, served as a philosemitic parody and rebuke of conventional anti-Semitic tropes.

But, his disciples and defenders have failed to agree about the nature of de Man&#x27;s silence about his wartime activities. His critics, on the other hand, point out that throughout his life de Man was not only passively silent, but also engaged in an active coverup through lies and misdirections about his past.

The question of de Man&#x27;s personal history has continued to fascinate scholars, as evidenced by Evelyn Barish&#x27;s 2014 biography &quot;The Double Life of Paul de Man&quot;. In an advance review published in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, Christine Smallwood concludes that de Man, as portrayed by Barish, was &quot;a slippery Mr. Ripley, a confidence man, and a hustler who embezzled, lied, forged, and arreared his way to intellectual acclaim.&quot; In response to these claims, Peter Brooks, who succeeded to de Man&#x27;s post as Sterling Professor at Yale, stated that some of Barish&#x27;s accusations were overblown, identifying several errors in her footnotes: &quot;One could do a review of Barish&#x27;s footnotes that would cast many doubts on her scholarship&quot;. For example, he cites the footnote Barish provides to support her claim that in 1942 de Man planned to launch a Nazi literary magazine: &quot;I shared this information, and it has since been previously published in Belgian sources not now available to me&quot;, noting that this sort of thing &quot;does not pass any sort of muster.&quot; Harvard professor Louis Menand, on the other hand, in his review in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, finds Barish&#x27;s biography important and credible, notwithstanding the presence of occasional errors and exaggerations. Menand writes &quot;[h]er book is a brief for the prosecution. But it is not a hatchet job, and she has an amazing tale to tell. In her account, all guns are smoking. There are enough to stock a miniseries.&quot;

<doc id="310126" wikidata="Q240851" url="?curid=310126" title="Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak">
<text>Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak (; born 24 February 1942) is an Indian scholar, literary theorist, and feminist critic. She is a University Professor at Columbia University and a founding member of the establishment&#x27;s Institute for Comparative Literature and Society.

Considered one of the most influential postcolonial intellectuals, Spivak is best known for her essay &quot;Can the Subaltern Speak?&quot; and her translation of and introduction to Jacques Derrida&#x27;s &quot;De la grammatologie&quot;. She has also translated many works of Mahasweta Devi into English, with separate critical notes on Devi&#x27;s life and writing style, notably &quot;Imaginary Maps&quot; and &quot;Breast Stories.&quot;

Spivak was awarded the 2012 Kyoto Prize in Arts and Philosophy for being &quot;a critical theorist and educator speaking for the humanities against intellectual colonialism in relation to the globalized world.&quot; In 2013, she received the Padma Bhushan, the third highest civilian award given by the Republic of India.

Although associated with postcolonialism, Spivak confirmed her separation from the discipline in her book &quot;A Critique of Postcolonial Reason&quot; (1999), a position she maintains in a 2021 essay titled &quot;How the Heritage of Postcolonial Studies Thinks Colonialism Today&quot;, published by &quot;Janus Unbound: Journal of Critical Studies&quot;.

==Life==

=== Early life ===
Spivak was born on 24 February 1942 as Gayatri Chakravorty in Calcutta, India, into a Bengali family. Her father was Pares Chandra Chakravorty and mother was Sivani Chakravorty. After completing her secondary education at St. John&#x27;s Diocesan Girls&#x27; Higher Secondary School, Spivak attended Presidency College, Kolkata under the University of Calcutta, from which she graduated in 1959.

Spivak has been married twice—first to Talbot Spivak, from 1964 to 1977, and then to Basudev Chatterji. She has no children.

=== 1960s and 1970s ===
In 1959, upon graduation, she secured employment as an English tutor for forty hours a week. Her MA thesis was on the representation of innocence in Wordsworth with M.H. Abrams. In 1961, Spivak joined the graduate program in English at Cornell University in the United States, traveling on money borrowed on a so-called &quot;life mortgage&quot;. In 1962, unable to secure financial aid from the department of English, she transferred to a new program called Comparative Literature, although she had insufficient preparation in French and German. Her dissertation was under the guidance of the program&#x27;s first director, Paul de Man, titled &quot;Myself Must I Remake: The Life and Poetry of W.B. Yeats&quot;. In 1963–1964, she attended Girton College, Cambridge, as a research student under the supervision of Professor T.R. Henn, writing on the representation of the stages of development of the lyric subject in the poetry of Yeats. She presented a course in the summer of 1963 on &quot;Yeats and the Theme of Death&quot; at the Yeats Summer School in Sligo, Ireland. (She returned there in 1987 to present Yeats&#x27; position within post-coloniality.)

In the Fall of 1965, Spivak became an assistant professor in the English department of the University of Iowa. She received tenure in 1970. She did not publish her doctoral dissertation, &quot;The Great Wheel: Stages in the Personality of Yeats&#x27;s Lyric Speaker&quot; (Cornell, 1967), but decided to write a critical book on Yeats that would be accessible to her undergraduate students without compromising her intellectual positions. The result was her first book, written for young adults, &quot;Myself Must I Remake: The Life and Poetry of W.B. Yeats&quot;.

In 1967, on her regular attempts at self-improvement, Spivak purchased a book, by an author unknown to her, entitled &quot;De la grammatologie&quot;. She decided to translate this book, and wrote a long translator&#x27;s preface. This publication was immediately a success, and the &quot;Translator&#x27;s Preface&quot; began to be used around the world as an introduction to the philosophy of deconstruction launched by the author, Jacques Derrida, whom Spivak met in 1971.

In 1974, at the University of Iowa, Spivak founded the MFA in Translation in the department of Comparative Literature. The following year, she became the Director of the Program in Comparative Literature and was promoted to a full professorship. In 1978, she was National Humanities Professor at the University of Chicago. She received many subsequent residential visiting professorships and fellowships. In 1978, she joined the University of Texas at Austin as professor of English and Comparative Literature.

=== 1980s to present ===
In 1982, she was appointed as the Longstreet Professor in English and Comparative Literature at Emory University. In 1986, at the University of Pittsburgh, she became the first Mellon Professor of English. Here, she established the Cultural Studies program. From 1991, she was a member of faculty at Columbia University as Avalon Foundation Professor in the Humanities, where, in 2007, she was made University Professor in the Humanities.

Since 1986, Spivak has been engaged in teaching and training adults and children among the landless illiterates on the border of West Bengal and Bihar/Jharkhand. This sustained attempt to access the epistemologies damaged by the millennial oppression of the caste system has allowed her to understand the situation of globality as well as the limits of high theory more clearly. In 1997, her friend Lore Metzger, a survivor of the Third Reich, left her $10,000 in her will, to help with the work of rural education. With this, Spivak established the Pares Chandra and Sivani Chakravorty Memorial Foundation for Rural Education; to which she contributed the majority of her Kyoto Prize.

==Work==
Spivak rose to prominence with her translation of Derrida&#x27;s &quot;De la grammatologie&quot;, which included a translator&#x27;s introduction that has been described as &quot;setting a new standard for self-reflexivity in prefaces&quot;. After this, as a member of the &quot;Subaltern Studies Collective&quot;, she carried out a series of historical studies and literary critiques of imperialism and international feminism. She has often referred to herself as a &quot;practical Marxist-feminist-deconstructionist&quot;. Her predominant ethico-political concern has been for the space occupied by the subaltern, especially subaltern women, both in discursive practices and in institutions of Western cultures. Edward Said wrote of Spivak&#x27;s work, &quot;She pioneered the study in literary theory of non-Western women and produced one of the earliest and most coherent accounts of that role available to us.&quot;

=== &quot;Can the Subaltern Speak?&quot; ===
Her essay, &quot;Can the Subaltern Speak?&quot; (1988), established Spivak among the ranks of feminists who consider history, geography, and class when thinking about women. In &quot;Can the Subaltern Speak?&quot;, Spivak discusses the lack of an account of the Sati practice, leading her to reflect on whether the subaltern can even speak. Spivak writes about the process, the focus on the Eurocentric Subject as they disavow the problem of representation; and by invoking the Subject of Europe, these intellectuals constitute the subaltern &#x27;Other of Europe&#x27; as anonymous and mute. In all her work, Spivak&#x27;s main effort has been to try to find ways of accessing the subjectivity of those who are being investigated. She is hailed as a critic who has feminized and globalized the philosophy of deconstruction, considering the position of the subaltern (a word used by Antonio Gramsci as describing ungeneralizable fringe groups of society who lack access to citizenship).

In the early 1980s, she was also hailed as a co-founder of postcolonial theory, which she refused to accept fully. Her &quot;A Critique of Postcolonial Reason&quot;, published in 1999, explores how major works of European metaphysics (e.g., Kant, Hegel) not only tend to exclude the subaltern from their discussions, but actively prevent non-Europeans from occupying positions as fully human subjects. In this work, Spivak launched the concept of &quot;sanctioned ignorance&quot; for the &quot;reproducing and foreclosing of colonialist structures&quot;. This concept denotes a purposeful silencing through the &quot;dismissing of a particular context as being irrelevant&quot;; an institutionalized and ideological way of presenting the world.

Spivak coined the term &quot;strategic essentialism&quot;, which refers to a sort of temporary solidarity for the purpose of social action. For example, women&#x27;s groups have many different agendas that potentially make it difficult for feminists to work together for common causes. &quot;Strategic essentialism&quot; allows for disparate groups to accept temporarily an &quot;essentialist&quot; position that enables them able to act cohesively and &quot;can be powerfully displacing and disruptive.&quot;

However, while others have built upon the idea of &quot;strategic essentialism&quot;, Spivak has been unhappy with the ways the concept has been taken up and used. In interviews, she has disavowed the term, although she has not completely deserted the concept itself.

In speeches given and published since 2002, Spivak has addressed the issue of terrorism and suicide bombings. With the aim of bringing an end to suicide bombings, she has explored and &quot;tried to imagine what message [such acts] might contain&quot;, ruminating that &quot;suicidal resistance is a message inscribed in the body when no other means will get through&quot;. One critic has suggested that this sort of stylised language may serve to blur important moral issues relating to terrorism. However, Spivak stated in the same speech that &quot;single coerced yet willed suicidal &#x27;terror&#x27; is in excess of the destruction of dynastic temples and the violation of women, tenacious and powerfully residual. It has not the banality of evil. It is informed by the stupidity of belief taken to extreme.&quot;

Apart from Derrida, Spivak has also translated the fiction of the Bengali author, Mahasweta Devi, the poetry of the 18-century Bengali poet Ramprasad Sen, and &quot;A Season in the Congo&quot; by Aimé Césaire, a poet, essayist, and statesman from Martinique. In 1997, she received a prize for translation into English from the Sahitya Akadami from the National Academy of Literature in India.

=== Academic roles and honors ===
She has been a Guggenheim fellow, has received numerous academic honours including an honorary doctorate from Oberlin College, and has been on the editorial board of academic journals such as &quot;Boundary 2&quot;. She was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2007. In March of that same year, Columbia University President Lee Bollinger appointed Spivak University Professor, the institution&#x27;s highest faculty rank. In a letter to the faculty, he wrote:

Spivak has served on the advisory board of numerous academic journals, including &quot;Janus Unbound: Journal of Critical Studies&quot; published by Memorial University of Newfoundland, &quot;differences&quot;, &quot;Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society&quot;, &quot;Interventions: International Journal of Postcolonial Studies&quot; published by Routledge, and &quot;Diaspora: A Journal of Transnational Studies&quot;. Spivak has received 11 honorary doctorates from the University of Toronto, University of London, Oberlin College, Universitat Rovira Virgili, Rabindra Bharati University, Universidad Nacional de San Martín, University of St Andrews, Université de Vincennes à Saint-Denis, Presidency University, Yale University, and University of Ghana-Legon. In 2012, she became the only Indian recipient of the Kyoto Prize in Arts and Philosophy in the category of Arts and Philosophy, while in 2021 she was elected a corresponding fellow of the British Academy.

Spivak has advised many significant post-colonial scholars. Professors Jenny Sharpe and Mark Sanders are among her former students.

==Criticism==

Spivak has often been criticized for her cryptic prose. Terry Eagleton laments that

Writing for the &quot;New Statesman&quot;, Stephen Howe complained that &quot;Spivak is so bewilderingly eclectic, so prone to juxtapose diverse notions without synthesis, that ascribing a coherent position to her on any question is extremely difficult.&quot;

Judith Butler, in a response critical of Eagleton&#x27;s position, cited Adorno&#x27;s comment on the lesser value of the work of theorists who &quot;recirculate received opinion&quot;, and opined that Spivak &quot;gives us the political landscape of culture in its obscurity and proximity&quot;, and that Spivak&#x27;s supposedly &quot;complex&quot; language has resonated with and profoundly changed the thinking of &quot;tens of thousands of activists and scholars&quot;, and continues to do so.

In May 2024, Spivak was involved in a controversy where she repeatedly corrected the pronunciation of a Dalit graduate student Anshul Kumar who asked her a question as part of a discussion at an event in Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi. Anshul Kumar shared in a Dalit blog about feeling humiliated and insulted during the incident. Spivak remarked in an interview that Anshul Kumar &quot;had not identified himself as a Dalit&quot;. Dalit scholar Anilkumar Payyappilly Vijayan called the student&#x27;s reaction &quot;a strategy of counter-violence&quot; against &quot;the structural violence built into the very edifice of postcoloniality on which many dominant class intellectuals [like Spivak] have been comfortably placed&quot;.

== Avital Ronell controversy ==
In May 2018, Spivak signed a collective letter to New York University to defend Avital Ronell, a colleague of Spivak, against the charge of sexual abuse from NYU graduate student Nimrod Reitman. Spivak and the other signatories called the case a &quot;legal nightmare&quot; for Ronell and charged Reitman with conducting a &quot;malicious campaign&quot; against her. More specifically, the letter suggested that Ronell should be excused on the basis of the significance of her academic contributions. Many signatories were also concerned of the utilisation of feminist tools, like Title IX, to take down feminists. Judith Butler, the chief signatory, subsequently apologized for certain aspects of the letter. NYU ultimately found Ronell guilty of sexual harassment and suspended her for a year.

<doc id="310132" wikidata="Q10544" url="?curid=310132" title="Munich (district)">
<text>Munich () is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in Bavaria, Germany. It borders (from the north and clockwise) the districts of Dachau, Freising, Erding, Ebersberg, Rosenheim, Miesbach, Bad Tölz-Wolfratshausen, Starnberg, Fürstenfeldbruck, and almost encircles (except for the west and northwest sides) the district-free city of Munich itself, which is the district seat.

==History==
The history of the region is connected to the city of Munich.

The district was established in 1852 and underwent several changes due to the ongoing incorporation of municipalities into the city of Munich. In 1972 the constant shrinking of the district was compensated by adding nine municipalities from the former district of Wolfratshausen.

==Geography==
The district is located in the east and the south of the city Munich, mostly covering the moraine plain around Munich. In the south of the district the foothills of the Alps start, which also contain the highest elevation of the district, two hills 703 m above sea level in the municipality Schäftlarn. The lowest elevation with 471 m is near Unterschleißheim in the north of the district. The main river is the Isar, which also flows through the city of Munich.

==Coat of arms==
The left half of the coat of arms show the Bavarian blue-and-white lozenge symbols. The black and gold (mostly simplified to yellow) colors in the right half are the colors of the city Munich. On top is a wavy line, which symbolizes the river Isar.

==Towns and municipalities==

==Government==
The district is administered by the Landratsamt München and politically led by the Kreistag.

<text>The Principality of Achaea () or Principality of [[Morea]] was one of the vassal states of the Latin Empire, which replaced the Byzantine Empire after the capture of Constantinople during the Fourth Crusade. It became a vassal of the Kingdom of Thessalonica, along with the Duchy of Athens, until Thessalonica was captured by Epirus in 1224. After this, Achaea became the dominant power in Greece, lasting continuously for 227 years and cumulatively for 229.

==Foundation==
Achaea was founded in 1205 by William of Champlitte and Geoffrey I of Villehardouin, who undertook to conquer the Peloponnese on behalf of Boniface of Montferrat, King of Thessalonica. With a force of no more than 100 knights and 500 foot soldiers, they took Achaea and Elis, and after defeating the local Greeks in the Battle of the Olive Grove of Koundouros, they became masters of the Morea. The victory was decisive, and after the battle, all resistance from the locals was limited to a few forts that continued to hold out. The fort of Araklovon in Elis was defended by Doxapatres Boutsaras and withstood the attacks until 1213, when the garrison finally surrendered. The fort of Monemvasia, and the castles of Argos, Nauplia and Corinth under Leo Sgouros held out until his suicide in 1208. By 1212, these too had been conquered, and organized as the lordship of Argos and Nauplia, and only Monemvasia continued to hold out until 1248. William of Champlitte ruled Achaea until he departed for France to assume an inheritance, but died on the way there in 1209. He was succeeded by Geoffrey I of Villehardouin, who ruled until his own death in 1219.

==Organization of the Principality==

===Territorial organization and feudal structure===

Achaea was rather small, consisting of the Peloponnese peninsula (then known as the Morea), but it was fairly wealthy, exporting wine, raisins, wax, honey, oil and silk. The capital of the principality was originally at Andravida. It was bordered on the north by Epirus and the Duchy of Athens and surrounded by Venetian-held territories in the Aegean Sea, including the forts of Modon and Coron on the Peloponnese.

In 1208/9, after Champlitte&#x27;s departure, William I created a commission, composed of two Latin bishops, two bannerets and five Greek magnates and chaired by himself, to assess the land and divide it, according to Latin practice, in fiefs. The resulting register was presented at a parliament held at the princely residence at Andravida, and divided the country into twelve baronies, mostly centred around a newly constructed castle—a testament to the fact that the Franks were a military elite amidst a potentially hostile Greek population. The twelve temporal barons were joined by seven ecclesiastic lords, headed by the Latin Archbishop of Patras. Each of the latter was granted a number of estates as knightly fiefs, with the Archbishop receiving eight, the other bishops four each, and likewise four granted to each of the military orders: the Templars, Hospitallers and the Teutonic Knights. The twelve secular baronies were:
Shortly after 1260, a thirteenth barony, that of Arcadia (modern Kyparissia) was established, which was also a personal fief of the Villehardouins. Aside from Kalamata (and later Arcadia), which became the Villehardouins&#x27; personal fief, the Prince&#x27;s own domain encompassed the region of Elis, where the capital Andravida, the port of Glarentza (Clarence) and the fortress of Chlemoutsi (Clermont) were situated, Corinthia, with the Acrocorinth as the chief site, as well as most of Messenia and Laconia around the fertile valley of Eurotas. When Tsakonia and the other mountainous regions of the southeast were subdued in the late 1240s, these too came under the Prince&#x27;s control.

The twelve barons retained considerable powers and privileges, so that the Prince was not an absolute sovereign but rather a &quot;first among equals&quot; among them. Thus they had the right to construct a castle without the Prince&#x27;s permission, or to decree capital punishment. Since Salic Law was not adopted in Achaea, women could also inherit the fiefs. The high secular and ecclesiastic lords formed the High Court (&quot;la Haute Court&quot;) of the principality, presided over by the Prince, which acted as the Prince&#x27;s advisory council and judged affairs pertaining to feudal law. In addition, a Lower Court (&quot;la Court de la Borgesie&quot;) is mentioned, which abjudicated in matters of common law.

On the other hand, all vassals owed the Prince four months service in the field and four months garrison duty every year, retiring after the age of sixty, but only if a replacement could be provided. This put the principality on constant war footing. Indeed, the knights of Achaea enjoyed a considerable reputation both in the Levant and in Western Europe.

With the Byzantine recovery of the region around Mystras after 1261, however, the rapid extinction of the original families and the expansion of Achaean influence across Frankish Greece, the initial organization of the Principate changed. By the time the principality&#x27;s laws, the &quot;Assizes of Romania&quot;, were codified in the 1330s, the peers of the Prince were: the Duke of Athens, the Duke of Naxos, the Triarchs of Negroponte, the Margrave of Bodonitza, the Count palatine of Cephalonia and Zakynthos, the barons of Patras, Matagrifon and Kalavryta, as well as the marshal of the principality.

===Government and administration===

The most important secular and ecclesiastical lords participated in the council of the &quot;Grand Court&quot;, which was presided over by the Prince. The council had great authority, and its decisions were binding for the Prince. The Principality&#x27;s higher officials were the chancellor, the Prince&#x27;s chief minister, the marshal, the constable, the treasurer, the &quot;protovestiarius&quot;, in charge of the Prince&#x27;s personal treasury, and the &quot;pourveur des chastiaux&quot;, who was responsible for the replenishment of the castles.

The Principality also produced a unique set of laws, the Assizes of Romania, which combined aspects of Byzantine and French law, and became the basis for the laws of the other Crusader states. Several Byzantine titles such as &quot;logothetes&quot; and &quot;protovestarius&quot; continued in use, although these titles were adapted to fit the conceptions of Western feudalism. The Byzantine &quot;pronoia&quot; system was also adapted to fit Western feudalism; peasants (&quot;paroikoi&quot;) technically owned their land, but military duties and taxes that they had not been subject to under the &quot;pronoia&quot; system were imposed on them by their new French lords.

The Frankish barons were subjected to heavy military obligations. They had to serve four months each year with the Principality&#x27;s army and further four months of guard duty on various castles. They could not leave the Principality, except with the Prince&#x27;s permission, and even then had to return within two years and two days or have their property confiscated.

==The Principality in the 13th century==
Geoffrey I was succeeded (1209) by his son Geoffrey II, who ruled until his death in 1245. By confiscating the ecclesiastical taxes, in the years 1221–1223 he built himself a powerful castle at Chlemoutsi, near modern Kyllini, which he used as his main residence. Because of this, he came into conflict with the Catholic Church, and was briefly excommunicated by the Pope. When John III of Nicaea besieged Constantinople in 1236, Geoffrey II came to the aid of the Latin Empire with 100 knights, 800 archers and 6 vessels.

Under his son and successor, Prince William II Villehardouin (ruled 1245–1278), the Principality reached its zenith. William was a poet and troubadour, and his court had its own mint at Glarentza, and a flourishing literary culture, using a distinct form of spoken French. In 1249, William II moved the capital of Achaea to the newly built fortress of Mistra, near ancient Sparta. In 1255 he became embroiled in the War of the Euboeote Succession, and in 1259 he allied with Michael II, despot of Epirus, against Michael VIII Palaeologus of Nicaea. However, Michael II then deserted to join the Nicaean side, and William was taken prisoner at the Battle of Pelagonia. After Michael recaptured Constantinople in 1261, William was released in 1262 in return for Mistra and much of Laconia, which became a Byzantine province (the nucleus of the future Despotate of the Morea), as well as an oath of allegiance to the Emperor.

However, soon after his release, William broke his oath of allegiance, and begun seeking alliances with and help from various Western nations. Informed by the local Byzantine governor of William&#x27;s actions, Michael VIII sent an army under the command of his half-brother, Constantine, against William, but the expedition was unsuccessful, the Byzantines first being routed at the Battle of Prinitza in 1263 and then, after Constantine&#x27;s return to Constantinople, suffering a heavy defeat at the Battle of Makryplagi in 1264.

Despite his successes at Prinitza and Makryplagi, the war with the Byzantines had taken a toll on Achaean resources, and their empire remained a looming threat. A proposal to marry William&#x27;s elder daughter Isabella to Andronikos, eldest son of Michael VIII, was strongly opposed by the Achaean nobility, who had no desire to come under Byzantine rule. Both William and his overlord Baldwin II, now dispossessed of Constantinople, had hoped for aid from King Manfred of Sicily, who had sent troops to aid William at Pelagonia. But Manfred fell under Papal sanction and was killed in 1266, when Charles of Anjou conquered his kingdom. Charles was now ascendant in Italy, and William and Baldwin came to terms with him in the Treaty of Viterbo (1267). In return for the military aid and funds they so greatly needed, Charles obtained the suzerainty over Achaea from Baldwin, and the Principality itself from William. The latter was to retain the Principality for life, and it was to pass to his daughter, Isabella, who was to marry one of Charles&#x27; sons.

These were hard terms, essentially detaching Achaea from the Latin Empire and making it a dependency of the Kingdom of Sicily. Nonetheless, William fulfilled his obligations, leading an Achaean force to aid Charles against the invasion of Conradin at the Battle of Tagliacozzo (1268), and bringing Isabelle to Italy to marry Charles&#x27; son Philip in 1271. The military support of Charles allowed William to resist the Byzantines, and the last years of his reign were relatively quiet.

However, after the death of William in 1278, the seeds of a calamitous succession dispute were laid. In the normal course of events, Achaea would have passed to a cadet branch of the House of Anjou. However, his son-in-law Philip had died in 1277 without an heir, and a reversionary clause in the Treaty of Viterbo provided that the Principality would go to Charles of Anjou, rather than Isabelle, should this occur. Charles duly took possession of the Principality, which he ruled through a series of bailiffs; he would never personally visit it.

A renewed commitment by Charles to retake the Latin Empire (Treaty of Orvieto, 1281) was forestalled by the War of the Sicilian Vespers, and this struggle with the Crown of Aragon consumed the remainder of his life. His son Charles II succeeded him in Achaea as well as Sicily (now reduced to the Kingdom of Naples), but was a prisoner in Aragonese hands. In the interim, the rule of Achaea devolved upon a series of bailiffs chosen from the Morean nobility. Not long after his release and coronation in 1289, he granted the Principality to Isabelle of Villehardouin upon her marriage with Florent of Hainaut, in part to redress the grasping application of the Treaty of Viterbo at William&#x27;s death. However, he retained feudal overlordship over the Principality, and his grant provided that neither Isabelle nor any daughter who was her heir might marry without his consent.

==The feudal conflict of the Morea (1307–1383) and last decades of the principality ==
For this period the principality was under a violent succession dispute, which originated from the dispossessed Latin Emperor Baldwin II&#x27;s gift of the overlordship of Achaea to Charles I of Sicily, in return for support in his attempt to reconquer the throne in Constantinople. This was an action which ignored the rights of the Villehardouin Princes of Achaea. The Angevin kings of Naples subsequently gave Achaea as their fief to a series of their own relatives who fought against Princess Margaret of Villehardouin and her heirs.

Charles II of Naples had at first granted Achaea to Princess Isabella of Villehardouin (of the Villehardouin dynasty), but he deposed her and her consort Philip I of Piedmont in 1307, stripping them of their rights and granting it to his son Philip I of Taranto, who in 1313 transferred it to Matilda (or Mafalda, or Maud) of Hainaut, heiress of Isabella of Villehardouin, who was married to Louis of Burgundy, titular King of Thessalonica. But Margaret, younger daughter of William II Villehardouin, claimed her rights from 1307. In 1313 she claimed them again without success and then transferred her rights to her daughter Isabelle of Sabran, wife of Ferdinand of Majorca. The son of Ferdinand and Isabelle, known as James the Unfortunate, was proclaimed prince of the Morea in 1315 under the regency of his father, who conquered the principality between 1315 and 1316 but was defeated and executed by Louis of Burgundy and Matilda in 1316. In 1316 Louis of Burgundy died and King Robert of Naples deposed Matilda and gave the principality to his brother John of Durazzo, to whom Matilda was briefly married under duress before being imprisoned.

From 1331 the feudal lords began to recognize the rights of James, and in 1333 the recognition was total. Then John transferred his rights to his sister-in-law, Catherine of Valois, titular Empress of Constantinople, wife of Philip I of Taranto, whose stepson Robert claimed her rights until 1346 when she died. The claim was then issued by the son of Philip and Catherine, Philip II of Taranto. In 1349, James was succeeded by his son James IV (II of the Morea). In 1364 Robert of Taranto, stepson of Catherine and eldest surviving son of Philip I of Taranto, died. In 1373 Philip II transferred his rights to his cousin, overlord and former sister-in-law Queen Joan I of Naples, whose third husband James IV of Majorca, when he died in 1375, left her his own claim to the principality, at which point she became more or less the uncontested Princess of Achaea. However, when Joan was imprisoned in Naples in 1381, another, much younger, James, James of Baux, grandson of Catherine and nephew of Philip II, who in 1374 had become titular Emperor of Constantinople, used the opportunity and seized Achaea. In 1383, Achaea was annexed by Charles III of Naples, successor and murderer of Queen Joan of Naples, who was the grandson of John of Durazzo, and James of Baux was driven away. In 1383 the Vicary government began, lasting until 1396, under the Durazzo kings of Naples.

In 1404, Ladislaus, King of Naples, sold the princely rights to Centurione II Zaccaria, the lord of Arkadia (modern Kyparissia). Centurione ruled until 1430, when the Despots of the Morea, Constantine Palaiologos and Thomas Palaiologos, conquered the heartland of the Principality in Achaea. Centurione was forced to marry off his daughter, Catherine, to Thomas and to constitute her his heiress. He retreated to his ancestral Messenian castle. Upon his death in 1432, this too was seized by the Byzantines.

Upon the start of the great Morean revolt in 1453, John Asen Zaccaria, Centurione&#x27;s son from his marriage to a scion of the Asen branch of the Palaiologos family, revived the principality and was proclaimed Prince of Achaea by the Latins of Morea, with additional support from the Greek and Albanian rebels. He was recognised as the legitimate ruler of Morea by King Alfonso of Naples and by the Doge of Venice whom congratulated him as &quot;Prince Centurione III.&quot; However, by late 1454, he was defeated by the Turkish allies of Thomas and fled to Modon, and then to Italy. In his exile in Rome, the Popes recognised John as the titular Prince of Achaea and offered him a symbolic pension.

The Byzantine reconquest proved short-lived, however, as in 1460, the Ottomans conquered the Despotate.

* &quot;Lord Geoffrey&#x27;s Fancy&quot; (first published 1962, Bello Publishing, ). One of the last books by British historical novelist Alfred Duggan, this covers events in the Morea and the Duchy of Athens during the period 1257–1272. It is told from the perspective of an English knight who follows Geoffrey of Briel, a real person who held the Barony of Karytaina. Duggan was an archaeologist and historian; key facts are taken from the &quot;Chronicle of the Morea&quot; then fleshed out but it is as accurate as any historical reconstruction can be.

<doc id="310142" wikidata="Q2497140" url="?curid=310142" title="Under Milk Wood">
<text>Under Milk Wood is a 1954 radio drama by Welsh poet Dylan Thomas. The BBC commissioned the play, which was later adapted for the stage. The first public reading was in New York City in 1953.

A film version of the same name, directed by Andrew Sinclair, was released in 1972. A second adaptation of the play, directed by Pip Broughton, was staged for television in 2014 for the 60th anniversary of the piece. 

An omniscient narrator invites the audience to listen to the dreams and innermost thoughts of the inhabitants of the fictional small Welsh fishing town, Llareggub, (buggerall spelt backwards).

They include Mrs. Ogmore-Pritchard, relentlessly nagging her two dead husbands; Captain Cat, reliving his seafaring times; the two Mrs. Dai Breads; Organ Morgan, obsessed with his music; and Polly Garter, pining for her dead lover. Later, the town awakens, and, aware now of how their feelings affect whatever they do, we watch them go about their daily business.

==Origins and development==
===Background===
In 1931, the 17-year-old Thomas created a piece for the Swansea Grammar School magazine that included a conversation of &quot;Milk Wood&quot; stylings, between Mussolini and Wife, similar to those between Mrs. Ogmore-Pritchard and her two husbands that would later be found in &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot;. 

In 1933, Thomas talked at length with his mentor and friend, Bert Trick, about creating a play about a Welsh town:
In February 1937, Thomas outlined his plans for a Welsh Journey, following a route that would &quot;be decided by what incidents arose, what people told me stories, what pleasant or unpleasant or curious things...I encountered in the little-known villages among the lesser-known people.&quot;

A year later, in March 1938, Thomas suggested that a group of Welsh writers should prepare a verse-report of their &quot;own particular town, village, or district.&quot;

===Laugharne===
In May 1938, the Thomas family moved to Laugharne, a small town on the estuary of the river Tâf in Carmarthenshire, Wales. They lived there intermittently for just under two years until July 1941. They did not return to live there until 1949. 

The author Richard Hughes, who lived in Laugharne, has recalled that Thomas spoke to him in 1939 about writing a play about Laugharne in which the townsfolk would play themselves, an idea pioneered on the radio by Cornish villagers in the 1930s. Four years later, in 1943, Thomas again met Hughes, and this time outlined a play about a Welsh village certified as &#x27;mad&#x27; by government inspectors.

Hughes believed that when Thomas &quot;came to write &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot;, he did not use actual Laugharne characters.&quot; Nevertheless, some elements of Laugharne are discernible in the play. A girl, age 14, named Rosie Probert (&quot;Rosie Probert, thirty three Duck Lane. Come on up, boys, I&#x27;m dead.&quot;) was living in Horsepool Road in Laugharne at the 1921 census. Although there is no-one of that name in Laugharne in the 1939 War Register, nor anyone named Rosie, Laugharne resident, Jane Dark, has described how she told Thomas about her. Dark has also described telling Thomas about the ducks of Horsepool Road (&quot;Duck Lane&quot;) and the drowning of the girl who went in search of them.

Both Laugharne and Llareggub have a castle, and, like Laugharne, Llareggub is on an estuary (&quot;boat-bobbing river and sea&quot;), with cockles, cocklers and Cockle Row. Laugharne also provides the clock tower of Myfanwy Price&#x27;s dreams, as well as Salt House Farm which may have inspired the name of Llareggub&#x27;s Salt Lake Farm. Llareggub&#x27;s Butcher Beynon almost certainly draws on butcher and publican Carl Eynon, though he was not in Laugharne but in nearby St Clears.

===New Quay===
In September 1944, the Thomas family moved to a bungalow called Majoda on the cliffs outside New Quay, Cardiganshire (Ceredigion), Wales, and left in July the following year. Thomas had previously visited New Quay whilst living in nearby Talsarn in 1942–1943, and had an aunt and cousins living in New Quay. He had written a New Quay pub poem, &quot;Sooner than you can water milk&quot;, in 1943, which has several words and ideas that would later re-appear in &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot;. Thomas&#x27; bawdy letter-poem from New Quay to T. W. Earp, written just days after moving into Majoda, contains the name &quot;No-good&quot;, anticipating Nogood Boyo of &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot;.

Thomas&#x27;s wife, Caitlin, has described the year at Majoda as &quot;one of the most important creative periods of his life...New Quay was just exactly his kind of background, with the ocean in front of him ... and a pub where he felt at home in the evenings.&quot; Thomas&#x27; biographers have taken a similar view. His time there, recalled Constantine FitzGibbon, his first biographer, was &quot;a second flowering, a period of fertility that recalls the earliest days … [with a] great outpouring of poems&quot;, as well as a good deal of other material. Biographer Paul Ferris agreed: &quot;On the grounds of output, the bungalow deserves a plaque of its own.&quot; Thomas&#x27; third biographer, George Tremlett, concurred, describing the time in New Quay as &quot;one of the most creative periods of Thomas&#x27;s life.&quot;

Some of those who knew him well, including FitzGibbon, have said that Thomas began writing &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot; in New Quay. The play&#x27;s first producer, Douglas Cleverdon, agreed, noting that Thomas &quot;wrote the first half within a few months; then his inspiration seemed to fail him when he left New Quay.&quot; One of Thomas&#x27; closest friends and confidantes, Ivy Williams of Brown&#x27;s Hotel, Laugharne, has said &quot;Of course, it wasn&#x27;t really written in Laugharne at all. It was written in New Quay, most of it.&quot;

The writer and puppeteer, Walter Wilkinson, visited New Quay in 1947, and his essay on the town captures its character and atmosphere as Thomas would have found it two years earlier. Photos of New Quay in Thomas&#x27; day, as well as a 1959 television programme about the town, can be found here.

There were many milestones on the road to Llareggub, and these have been detailed by Professor Walford Davies in his Introduction to the definitive edition of &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot;. The most important of these was &quot;Quite Early One Morning&quot;, Thomas&#x27; description of a walk around New Quay, broadcast by the BBC in 1945, and described by Davies as a &quot;veritable storehouse of phrases, rhythms and details later resurrected or modified for &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot;.&quot; For example, the &quot;done-by-hand water colours&quot; of &quot;Quite Early One Morning&quot; appear later as the &quot;watercolours done by hand&quot; of &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot;.

Another striking example from the 1945 broadcast is Mrs Ogmore-Pritchard who later appears as a major character in &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot;:

:Open the curtains, light the fire, what are servants for?
:I am Mrs. Ogmore-Pritchard and I want another snooze.
:Dust the china, feed the canary, sweep the drawing-room floor;
:And before you let the sun in, mind he wipes his shoes.

Mrs Ogmore Davies and Mrs Pritchard-Jones both lived on Church Street in New Quay. Mrs Pritchard-Jones was constantly cleaning, recalled one of her neighbours, &quot;a real matron-type, very strait-laced, house-proud, ran the house like a hospital ward.&quot; In her book on New Quay, Mrs Pritchard-Jones&#x27; daughter notes that her mother had been a Queen&#x27;s Nurse before her marriage and afterwards &quot;devoted much of her time to cleaning and dusting our home ... sliding a small mat under our feet so we would not bring in any dirt from the road.&quot;

Jack Lloyd, a New Quay postman and the Town Crier, also lived on Church Street. He provided the character of Llareggub&#x27;s postman Willy Nilly, whose practice of opening letters, and spreading the news, reflects Lloyd&#x27;s role as Town Crier, as Thomas himself noted on a work sheet for the play: &quot;Nobody minds him opening the letters and acting as [a] kind of town-crier. How else could they know the news?&quot; It is this note, together with our knowledge that Thomas knew Jack Lloyd (&quot;an old friend&quot;), that establish the link between Willy Nilly and Lloyd.

There were also other New Quay residents in &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot;. Dai Fred Davies the donkeyman on board the fishing vessel, the &quot;Alpha&quot;, appears in the play as Tom-Fred the donkeyman. Local builder, Dan Cherry Jones, appears as Cherry Owen in the play, as Cherry Jones in Thomas&#x27; sketch of Llareggub, and as Cherry Jones in one of Thomas&#x27; work sheets for the play, where Thomas describes him as a plumber and carpenter.

The time-obsessed, &quot;thin-vowelled laird&quot;, as Thomas described him, New Quay&#x27;s reclusive English aristocrat, Alastair Hugh Graham, lover of fish, fishing and cooking, and author of &quot;Twenty Different Ways of Cooking New Quay Mackerel&quot;, is considered to be the inspiration for &quot;Lord Cut-Glass … that lordly fish-head nibbler … in his fish-slimy kitchen ... [who] scampers from clock to clock&quot;.

Third Drowned&#x27;s question at the beginning of the play, &quot;How&#x27;s the tenors in Dowlais?&quot;, reflects the special relationship that once existed between New Quay and Dowlais, an industrial town in South Wales. Its workers traditionally holidayed in New Quay and often sang on the pier on summer evenings. Such was the relationship between the two towns that when St Mair&#x27;s church in Dowlais was demolished in 1963, its bell was given to New Quay&#x27;s parish church.

Other names and features from New Quay in the play include Maesgwyn farm the Sailor&#x27;s Home Arms, the river Dewi, the quarry, the harbour, Manchester House, the hill of windows and the Downs. The Fourth Drowned&#x27;s line &quot;Buttermilk and whippets&quot; also comes from New Quay, as does the stopped clock in the bar of the Sailors&#x27; Arms.

Walford Davies has concluded that New Quay &quot;was crucial in supplementing the gallery of characters Thomas had to hand for writing &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot;. FitzGibbon had come to a similar conclusion many years earlier, noting that Llareggub &quot;resembles New Quay more closely [than Laugharne] and many of the characters derive from that seaside village in Cardiganshire...&quot; John Ackerman has also suggested that the story of the drowned village and graveyard of Llanina, that lay in the sea below Majoda, &quot;is the literal truth that inspired the imaginative and poetic truth&quot; of &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot;. Another part of that literal truth were the 60 acres of cliff between New Quay and Majoda, including Maesgwyn farm, that collapsed into the sea in the early 1940s.

===Elba, South Leigh and Prague===
In April 1947, Thomas and family went to Italy. He intended to write a radio play there, as his letters home make clear. Several words and phrases that appear in &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot; can be found in some of Thomas&#x27; letters from the island of Elba, where he stayed for three weeks. The &quot;fishers and miners&quot; and &quot;webfooted waterboys&quot; of the letters become the &quot;fishers&quot; and &quot;webfoot cocklewomen&quot; of the first page of &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot;. The &quot;sunblack&quot; and &quot;fly-black&quot; adjectives of Elba anticipate the &quot;crowblack&quot; and &quot;bible-black&quot; descriptions of Llareggub. The play&#x27;s Fourth Drowned, Alfred Pomeroy Jones, &quot;died of blisters&quot;, and so, almost, did Thomas, as he vividly describes in a letter home. And, in time, the island&#x27;s &quot;blister-biting blimp-blue bakehouse sea&quot; would re-appear as Llareggub&#x27;s &quot;slow, black, crowblack, fishingboat-bobbing sea.&quot;

On their return from Italy in August 1947, the Thomases moved to South Leigh, near Witney in Oxfordshire, where Thomas declared his intent to work further on the play. It was here that he knocked the play into shape, as one biographer described it. There are various accounts of his work on the play at South Leigh, where he lived until May 1949. He also worked on filmscripts here, including &quot;The Three Weird Sisters&quot;, which includes the familiar Llareggub names of Daddy Waldo and Polly Probert.

Just a month or so after moving to South Leigh, Thomas met the BBC producer, Philip Burton, in the Café Royal in London, where he outlined his ideas for &quot;&quot;The Village of the Mad&quot;…a coastal town in south Wales which was on trial because they felt it was a disaster to have a community living in that way… For instance, the organist in the choir in the church played with only the dog to listen to him…A man and a woman were in love with each other but they never met… they wrote to each other every day…And he had the idea that the narrator should be like the listener, blind.…&quot; Burton&#x27;s friendship with Thomas, and his influence on the play, has been set within the context of the work done by Burton and T. Rowland Hughes in developing community portraiture on the radio.

Thomas went to Prague in March 1949 for a writers&#x27; conference. His guide and interpreter, Jiřina Hauková, has recalled that, at a party, Thomas &quot;narrated the first version of his radio play &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot;&quot;. She mentions that he talked about the organist who played to goats and sheep, as well as a baker with two wives. Another at the party remembered that Thomas also talked about the two Voices.

The testimony from Prague, when taken with that of Burton about the meeting in the Café Royal in 1947, indicates that several of the characters of the play were already in place by the time Thomas had moved to the Boat House in Laugharne in May 1949: the organist, the two lovers who never met but wrote to each other, the baker with two wives, the blind narrator and the Voices.

The first known sighting of a script for the play was its first half, titled &quot;The Town that was Mad&quot;, which Thomas showed to the poet Allen Curnow in October 1949 at the Boat House.

A draft first half of the play was delivered to the BBC in late October 1950. It consisted of thirty-five handwritten pages containing most of the places, people and topography of Llareggub, and which ended with the line &quot;Organ Morgan&#x27;s at it early…&quot; A shortened version of this first half was published in &quot;Botteghe Oscure&quot; in May 1952 with the title &quot;Llareggub. A Piece for Radio Perhaps&quot;. By the end of that year, Thomas had been in Laugharne for just over three years, but his half-play had made little progress since his South Leigh days. On 6 November 1952, he wrote to the editor of &quot;Botteghe Oscure&quot; to explain why he hadn&#x27;t been able to &quot;finish the second half of my piece for you.&quot; He had failed shamefully, he said, to add to &quot;my lonely half of a looney maybe-play&quot;.

=== America ===
Thomas gave a reading of the unfinished play to students at Cardiff University in March 1953. He travelled to the United States in April to give the first public readings of the play, even though he had not yet written its second half. He gave a solo reading of the first half on 3 May at the Fogg Museum, Harvard, sponsored by The Poets&#x27; Theatre, where the audience responded enthusiastically. 

Rehearsals for the play&#x27;s official premiere on 14 May in New York City had already started but with only half the play, and with Thomas unavailable as he left to carry out a series of poetry readings and other engagements. He was up at dawn on 14 May to work on the second half, and he continued writing on the train between Boston and New York, as he travelled to the 92nd Street Y&#x27;s Poetry Center for the premiere. With the performance just 90 minutes away, the &quot;final third of the play was still unorganised and but partially written.&quot; The play&#x27;s producer, Liz Reitell, locked Thomas in a room to continue work on the script, the last few lines of which were handed to the actors as they were preparing to go on stage. Thomas subsequently added some 40 new lines to the second half for the play&#x27;s next reading in New York on 28 May.

On his return to Laugharne, Thomas worked in a desultory fashion on &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot; throughout the summer. His daughter, Aeronwy, noticed that his health had &quot;visibly deteriorated. ... I could hear his racking cough. Every morning he had a prolonged coughing attack. ... The coughing was nothing new but it seemed worse than before.&quot; She also noted that the blackouts that Thomas was experiencing were &quot;a constant source of comment&quot; amongst his Laugharne friends.

Thomas gave readings of the play in Porthcawl and Tenby, before travelling to London to catch his plane to New York for another tour, including three readings of &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot;. He stayed with the comedian Harry Locke, and worked on the play, re-writing parts of the first half, and writing Eli Jenkins&#x27; sunset poem and Waldo&#x27;s chimney sweep song for the second half. Locke noticed that Thomas was very chesty, with &quot;terrible&quot; coughing fits that made him go purple in the face.

On 15 October 1953, Thomas delivered another draft of the play to the BBC, a draft that his producer, Douglas Cleverdon, described as being in &quot;an extremely disordered state...it was clearly not in its final form.&quot; On his arrival in New York on 20 October 1953, Thomas added a further 38 lines to the second half, for the two performances on 24 and 25 October.

Thomas had been met at the airport by Liz Reitell, who was shocked at his appearance: &quot;He was very ill when he got here.&quot; Thomas&#x27;s agent John Brinnin, deeply in debt and desperate for money, also knew Thomas was very ill, but did not cancel or curtail his programme. He had a punishing schedule of four rehearsals and two performances of &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot; in just five days, as well as two sessions of revising the play. After the first performance on 24 October, Thomas was close to collapse, standing in his dressing room, clinging to the back of a chair. The play, he said, &quot;has taken the life out of me for now.&quot;

At the next performance, the actors realised that Thomas was very ill and had lost his voice: &quot;He was desperately ill … we didn&#x27;t think that he would be able to do the last performance because he was so ill … Dylan literally couldn&#x27;t speak he was so ill … still my greatest memory of it is that he had no voice.&quot; After a cortisone injection, he recovered sufficiently to go on stage. The play&#x27;s cast noticed Thomas&#x27;s worsening illness during the first three rehearsals, during one of which he collapsed. Brinnin was at the fourth and was shocked by Thomas&#x27; appearance: &quot;I could barely stop myself from gasping aloud. His face was lime-white, his lips loose and twisted, his eyes dulled, gelid, and sunk in his head.&quot;

Through the following week, Thomas continued to work on the script for the version that was to appear in &quot;Mademoiselle&quot;, and for the performance in Chicago on 13 November. However, he collapsed in the early hours of 5 November and died in hospital on 9 November 1953.

===Inspiration===
The sources for the play have generated intense debate. Thomas himself declared on two occasions that his play was based on Laugharne, but this has not gone unquestioned. The towns of Llansteffan, Ferryside and particularly New Quay also have made their claims. An examination of these respective claims was published in 2004. Surprisingly little scholarship has been devoted to Thomas and Laugharne, and about the town&#x27;s influence on the writing of &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot;. Thomas&#x27;s four years at the Boat House were amongst his least productive, and he was away for much of the time. As his daughter, Aeronwy, has recalled, &quot;he sought any pretext to escape.&quot;

Douglas Cleverdon has suggested that the topography of Llareggub &quot;is based not so much on Laugharne, which lies on the mouth of an estuary, but rather on New Quay, a seaside town...with a steep street running down to the harbour.&quot; The various topographical references in the play to the &#x27;top of the town,&#x27; and to its &#x27;top and sea-end&#x27; are also suggestive of New Quay, as are Llareggub&#x27;s terraced streets and hill of windows. The play is true to even the minor topographical details of New Quay. For example, Llareggub&#x27;s lazy fishermen walk &quot;uphill&quot; from the harbour to the Sailors&#x27; Arms.

Thomas drew a sketch map of the fictional town, which is now held by the National Library of Wales and can be viewed online. The Dylan Thomas scholar, James Davies, has written that &quot;Thomas&#x27;s drawing of Llareggub is... based on New Quay&quot; and there has been very little disagreement, if any, with this view. An examination of the sketch has revealed some interesting features: Thomas uses the name of an actual New Quay resident, Dan Cherry Jones, for one of the people living in Cockle Street. The Rev. Eli Jenkins is not in the sketch, however, and there are also three characters in the sketch who do not appear in the draft of the play given by Thomas to the BBC in October 1950.

Thomas seems to have drawn on New Quay in developing Llareggub&#x27;s profile as an ocean-going, schooner and harbour town, as he once described it. Captain Cat lives in Schooner House. He and his sailors have sailed the clippered seas, as First Voice puts it. They have been to San Francisco, Nantucket and more, bringing back coconuts and parrots for their families. The Rev. Eli Jenkins&#x27; White Book of Llareggub has a chapter on shipping and another on industry, all of which reflect New Quay&#x27;s history of both producing master mariners and building ocean-going ships, including schooners. In his 1947 visit to New Quay, Walter Wilkinson noted that the town &quot;abounds&quot; in sea captains The following year, another writer visiting New Quay noted that there were &quot;dozens of lads who knew intimately the life and ways of all the great maritime cities of the world.&quot;

Llareggub&#x27;s occupational profile as a town of seafarers, fishermen, cockle gatherers and farmers has also been examined through an analysis of the returns in the 1939 War Register for New Quay, Laugharne, Ferryside and Llansteffan. This analysis also draws upon census returns and the Welsh Merchant Mariners Index. It shows that New Quay and Ferryside provide by far the best fit with Llareggub&#x27;s occupational profile.

Thomas is reported to have commented that &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot; was developed in response to the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, as a way of reasserting the evidence of beauty in the world. It is also thought that the play was a response by Thomas both to the Nazi concentration camps, and to the internment camps that had been created around Britain during World War II.

==Llareggub==

The fictional name &quot;Llareggub&quot; was derived by reversing the phrase &quot;bugger all&quot;. In some published editions of the play, it is often rendered (contrary to Thomas&#x27;s own use – see below) as &quot;Llaregyb&quot; or similar. It is pronounced . The name bears some resemblance to many actual Welsh place names, which often begin with &quot;Llan&quot;, meaning church or, more correctly, sanctified enclosure, although a double g is not used in written Welsh.

The name Llareggub was first used by Thomas in two short stories published in 1936. They were &quot;The Orchards&quot; (&quot;This was a story more terrible than the stories of the reverend madmen in the Black Book of Llareggub.&quot;) and &quot;The Burning Baby&quot; (&quot;Death took hold of his sister&#x27;s legs as she walked through the calf-high heather up the hill... She was to him as ugly as the sowfaced woman Llareggub who had taught him the terrors of the flesh.&quot;)

Thomas&#x27; first known use of the name Llareggub in relation to &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot; was at a recitation of an early version of the play at a party in London in 1945.

Thomas had also referred to the play as &quot;The Village of the Mad&quot; or &quot;The Town that was Mad&quot;. By the summer of 1951, he was calling the play &quot;Llareggub Hill&quot; but by October 1951, when the play was sent to &quot;Botteghe Oscure,&quot; its title had become &quot;Llareggub. A Piece for Radio Perhaps&quot;. By the summer of 1952, the title was changed to &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot; because John Brinnin thought &quot;Llareggub Hill&quot; would be too thick and forbidding to attract American audiences.

In the play, the Rev Eli Jenkins writes a poem that describes Llareggub Hill and its &quot;mystic tumulus&quot;. This was based on a lyrical description of Twmbarlwm&#x27;s &quot;mystic tumulus&quot; in Monmouthshire that Thomas imitated from Arthur Machen&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Far Off Things&quot; (1922).

The town&#x27;s name is thought to be the inspiration for the country of Llamedos (sod &#x27;em all) in Terry Pratchett&#x27;s &quot;Discworld&quot; novel &quot;Soul Music&quot;. In this setting, Llamedos is a parody of Wales.

==Plot==
The play opens at night, when the citizens of Llareggub are asleep. The narrator (First Voice/Second Voice) informs the audience that they are witnessing the townspeople&#x27;s dreams.

Captain Cat, the blind sea captain, is tormented in his dreams by his drowned shipmates, who long to live again and enjoy the pleasures of the world. Mog Edwards and Myfanwy Price dream of each other; Mr. Waldo dreams of his childhood and his failed marriages; Mrs. Ogmore-Pritchard dreams of her deceased husbands. Almost all of the characters in the play are introduced as the audience witnesses a moment of their dreams.

Morning begins. The voice of a guide introduces the town, discussing the facts of Llareggub. The Reverend Eli Jenkins delivers a morning sermon on his love for the village. Lily Smalls wakes and bemoans her pitiful existence. Mr. and Mrs. Pugh observe their neighbours; the characters introduce themselves as they act in their morning. Mrs. Cherry Owen merrily rehashes her husband&#x27;s drunken antics. Butcher Beynon teases his wife during breakfast. Captain Cat watches as Willy Nilly the postman goes about his morning rounds, delivering to Mrs. Ogmore-Pritchard, Mrs. Pugh, Mog Edwards and Mr. Waldo.

At Mrs. Organ-Morgan&#x27;s general shop, women gossip about the townspeople. Willy Nilly and his wife steam open a love letter from Mog Edwards to Myfanwy Price; he expresses fear that he may be in the poor house if his business does not improve. Mrs. Dai Bread Two swindles Mrs. Dai Bread One with a bogus fortune in her crystal ball. Polly Garter scrubs floors and sings about her past paramours. Children play in the schoolyard; Gwennie urges the boys to &quot;kiss her where she says or give her a penny.&quot; Gossamer Beynon and Sinbad Sailors privately desire each other.

During dinner, Mr. Pugh imagines poisoning Mrs. Pugh. Mrs. Organ-Morgan shares the day&#x27;s gossip with her husband, but his only interest is the organ. The audience sees a glimpse of Lord Cut-Glass&#x27;s insanity in his &quot;kitchen full of time&quot;. Captain Cat dreams of his lost lover, Rosie Probert, but weeps as he remembers that she will not be with him again. Nogood Boyo fishes in the bay, dreaming of Mrs. Dai Bread Two and geishas.

On Llareggub Hill, Mae Rose Cottage spends a lazy afternoon wishing for love. Reverend Jenkins works on the White Book of Llareggub, which is a history of the entire town and its citizens. On the farm, Utah Watkins struggles with his cattle, aided by Bessie Bighead. As Mrs. Ogmore-Pritchard falls asleep, her husbands return to her. Mae Rose Cottage swears that she will sin until she explodes.

As night begins, Reverend Jenkins recites another poem. Cherry Owen heads to the Sailor&#x27;s Arms, where Sinbad still longs for Gossamer Beynon. The town prepares for the evening, to sleep or otherwise. Mr. Waldo sings drunkenly at the Sailors Arms. Captain Cat sees his drowned shipmates—and Rosie—as he begins to sleep. Organ-Morgan mistakes Cherry Owen for Johann Sebastian Bach on his way to the chapel. Mog and Myfanwy write to each other before sleeping. Mr. Waldo meets Polly Garter in a forest. Night begins and the citizens of Llareggub return to their dreams again.

==Publication and translation==

The first publication of &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot;, a shortened version of the first half of the play, appeared in Botteghe Oscure in April 1952. Two years later, in February 1954, both The Observer newspaper and Mademoiselle magazine published abridged versions. The first publications of the complete play were also in 1954: J. M. Dent in London in February and New Directions in America in April.

An Acting Edition of the play was published by Dent in 1958. The Definitive Edition, with one Voice, came out in 1995, edited by Walford Davies and Ralph Maud and published by Dent. A Project Gutenberg of Australia eBook for free use went online in November 2006, produced by Colin Choat.

The first translation was published in November 1954 by Drei Brücken Verlag in Germany, as &quot;Unter dem Milchwald&quot;, translated by Erich Fried. A few months later, in January 1955, the play appeared in the French journal &quot;Les Lettres Nouvelles&quot; as &quot;Le Bois de Lait&quot;, translated by Roger Giroux, with two further instalments in February and March.

Over the next three years, &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot; was published in Dutch, Polish, Danish, Estonian, Norwegian, Finnish, Swedish, Japanese and Italian. It&#x27;s estimated that it has now been translated into over thirty languages, including Welsh with a translation by T. James Jones, (Jim Parc Nest), published in 1968 as &quot;Dan Y Wenallt&quot;.

The original manuscript of the play was lost by Thomas in a London pub, a few weeks before his death in 1953. The alleged gift of the manuscript, to BBC producer Douglas Cleverdon, formed the subject of litigation in &quot;Thomas v Times Book Co&quot; (1966), which is a leading case on the meaning of gift in English property law.

&quot;Under Milk Wood&quot;, along with all other published works by Thomas, entered the public domain in the United Kingdom on 1 January 2024.

== Casts of principal productions==
==Production history==

The play had its first reading on stage on 14 May 1953, in New York City, at The Poetry Center at the 92nd Street Y. Thomas himself read the parts of the First Voice and the Reverend Eli Jenkins. Almost as an afterthought, the performance was recorded on a single-microphone tape recording (the microphone was laid at front center on the stage floor) and later issued by the Caedmon company. It is the only known recorded performance of &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot; with Thomas as a part of the cast. A studio recording, planned for 1954, was precluded by Thomas&#x27;s death in November 1953.

The BBC first broadcast &quot;Under Milk Wood,&quot; a new &quot;&#x27;Play for Voices&quot;, on the Third Programme on 25 January 1954 (two months after Thomas&#x27;s death), although several sections were omitted. The play was recorded with a distinguished, all-Welsh cast including Richard Burton as &quot;First Voice&quot;, with production by Douglas Cleverdon. A repeat was broadcast two days later. Daniel Jones, the Welsh composer who was a lifelong friend of Thomas&#x27;s (and his literary trustee), wrote the music; this was recorded separately, on 15 and 16 January, at Laugharne School. The play won the Prix Italia award for radio drama that year.

There were other notable productions in 1954:

*14 February: extracts from the play read at the Dylan Thomas Memorial Recital at the Royal Festival Hall, London.
*28 February: a complete reading at the Old Vic with Sybil Thorndike, Richard Burton and Emlyn Williams, adapted by Philip Burton.
*10 March: a broadcast by the BBC German Service, translated by Erich Fried as &quot;Unter dem Milchwald&quot;, followed on 20 September by the first broadcast on German radio itself. 
*28 September: the first BBC Welsh Home Service broadcast.
*November: the first stage performance, held at the Théâtre de la Cour Saint-Pierre, Geneva, by Phoenix Productions, with props lent by the BBC.

The following year, 1955, saw the first British stage production, on 13 August, at the Theatre Royal, Newcastle, the first production at the Edinburgh Festival on 21 August and, on 20 September 1957, the first London West End stage production (at the New Theatre).

The first attempt to bring the play to the screen occurred in May 1957 when the BBC broadcast a televised version narrated by Donald Houston. In 1963, the original radio producer, Douglas Cleverdon, revisited the project and recorded the complete play, which was broadcast on the Third Programme on 11 October 1963.

In 1971, &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot; was performed at Brynmawr Comprehensive School. The production was entirely the work of pupils at the school—from set design, to lighting and direction. With very few exceptions, every character was acted by a different player to allow as many pupils as possible to take part. Scheduled for only one performance; it ran for a week.

The 1972 film adaptation, with Burton reprising his role, also featured Elizabeth Taylor, Peter O&#x27;Toole, Glynis Johns, Vivien Merchant and other well-known actors, including Ryan Davies as the &quot;Second Voice&quot;. It was filmed on location in Fishguard, Pembrokeshire, and at Lee International Film Studios in London.

In 1988, George Martin produced an album version, featuring more of the dialogue sung, with music by Martin and Elton John, among others; Antony Hopkins played the part of &quot;First Voice&quot;. This was subsequently produced as a one-off stage performance (as &quot;An Evening with Dylan Thomas&quot;) for The Prince&#x27;s Trust in the presence of HRH Prince Charles, to commemorate the opening in December 1992 of the new AIR Studios at Lyndhurst Hall. It was again produced by Martin and directed by Hopkins, who once again played &#x27;First Voice&#x27;. Other roles were played by Harry Secombe, Freddie Jones, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Siân Phillips, Jonathan Pryce, Alan Bennett and, especially for the occasion, singer Tom Jones. The performance was recorded for television (directed by Declan Lowney) but has never been shown.

In 1992, Brightspark Productions released a 50-minute animation version, using an earlier BBC soundtrack with Burton as narrator. This was commissioned by S4C (a Welsh-language public service broadcaster). Music was composed specially by Trevor Herbert and performed by Treorchy Male Voice Choir and the Welsh Brass Consort.

In February 1994, Guy Masterson premiered a one-man physical version of the unabridged text at the Traverse Theatre, Edinburgh, playing all 69 characters. This production returned for the subsequent Edinburgh International Fringe Festival and sold out its entire run. It has since played over 2000 times globally.

In 1997, Australian pianist and composer Tony Gould&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot; (written for narrator and chamber orchestra) was first performed by actor John Stanton and the Queensland Philharmonic Orchestra.

In November 2003, as part of their commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of Thomas&#x27;s death, the BBC broadcast a new production of the play, imaginatively combining new actors with the original 1954 recording of Burton playing &quot;First Voice&quot;. (Broadcast 15 November 2003, BBC Radio 4; repeated 24 December 2004.) Digital noise reduction technology allowed Burton&#x27;s part to be incorporated unobtrusively into the new recording, which was intended to represent Welsh voices more realistically than the original.

In 2006, Austrian composer Akos Banlaky composed an opera with the libretto based on the German translation by Erich Fried (&quot;Unter dem Milchwald&quot;, performed at Tiroler Landestheater in Innsbruck, Austria).

In 2008, the French composer, François Narboni, composed an opera, &quot;Au Bois lacté&quot;, based on his own translation and adaptation of &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot;. It was created at the Opéra-Théâtre in Metz, France, with staging by Antoine Juliens. The work is for 12 singers, large mixed choir, children choir, accordion, dancer and electronics sounds.

In 2008, a ballet version of &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot; by Independent Ballet Wales toured the UK. It was choreographed by Darius James with music by British composer Thomas Hewitt Jones. A suite including music from the ballet was recorded by Court Lane Music in 2009.

In 2009 and 2010 a translation in Dutch by the Belgian writer Hugo Claus was performed on stage by Jan Decleir and Koen De Sutter on a theatre tour in Belgium and the Netherlands (e.g. the Zeeland Late-Summer Festival, the Vooruit in Ghent, etc.).

In 2010, a one-woman production of the text was performed at the Sidetrack Theatre in Sydney, Australia, presented by Bambina Borracha Productions and directed by Vanessa Hughes. Actress Zoe Norton Lodge performed all 64 characters in the play.

In July 2011, Progress Youth Theatre (Reading, Berkshire, UK) performed a stage adaptation of the radio script. All visual aspects, such as stage directions, costume, set and lighting design were therefore devised entirely by the youth theatre. The voice parts were shared equally among seven actors, with other actors playing multiple &quot;named&quot; parts (with the exception of Captain Cat, who remained on stage throughout the production).

The BBC Formula 1 introduction to the 2011 Singapore Grand Prix featured extracts of the audio for their opening VT.

In 2012, the Sydney Theatre Company staged a production starring Jack Thompson as First Voice and Sandy Gore as Second Voice, with a cast including Bruce Spence, Paula Arundell, Drew Forsythe, Alan John, Drew Livingston and Helen Thomson. The production was staged in the Drama Theatre of the Sydney Opera House.

In 2012, Gould&#x27;s 1997 adaptation of &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot; (written for narrator and chamber orchestra) was again performed by actor John Stanton as part of the Victorian College of the Arts Secondary School&#x27;s inaugural performance at the Melbourne Recital Centre. Gould played piano and worked with the students as a musical mentor.

Guy Masterson of Theatre Tours International has produced and performed a solo version of the play over 2000 times since its world premiere in 1994. It has been performed at the Edinburgh Festival in 1994, 1996, 2000, 2003, 2007 and 2010; in Adelaide, Australia, in 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2012; and in London&#x27;s West End Arts Theatre.

In 2014, Pip Broughton directed an adaptation of the play for the BBC, starring Michael Sheen, Tom Jones, and Jonathan Pryce.

In October 2014, the BBC launched an interactive ebook entitled &quot;Dylan Thomas: The Road To Milk Wood&quot;, written by Jon Tregenna and Robin Moore. It deals with the journey from Swansea via the BBC to New York City and beyond.

In 2021, as part of its post-COVID-19 programme, the National Theatre produced an adaptation of &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot; with Michael Sheen reprising his role as First Voice. This new adaptation included additional material from actress Dame Siân Phillips, who also starred in the production. The adaptation tells the story of First Voice trying to connect with his father, played by Karl Johnson, who has dementia by inventing stories of characters from the village his father lived in as a boy.

2020 production starring Kenneth Welsh and featuring Deaf Sign Language Performer, Missy Keast.

<doc id="310153" wikidata="Q15872" url="?curid=310153" title="Gekkonidae">
<text>Gekkonidae (the common geckos) is the largest family of geckos, containing over 950 described species in 62 genera. The Gekkonidae contain many of the most widespread gecko species, including house geckos (&quot;Hemidactylus&quot;), the tokay gecko (&quot;Gekko&quot;), day geckos (&quot;Phelsuma&quot;), the mourning gecko (&quot;Lepidodactylus&quot;), and dtellas (&quot;Gehyra&quot;). Gekkonid geckos occur globally and are particularly diverse in tropical areas. Many species of these geckos exhibit an adhering ability to surfaces through Van der Waals forces utilizing intermolecular forces between molecules of their setae (foot hair) and molecules of the surface they are on.

The genus &quot;Hemidactylus&quot; is one of the most species-rich and widely distributed of all reptile genera.

== Fossils ==
The family Gekkonidae is a member of the infraorder Gekkota, which seems to have first emerged during the Jurassic period (201–145 million years ago). &quot;Eichstaettisaurus schroederi&quot; is recognized as one of the earliest examples of an ancestral gecko species. Members of the genus &quot;Eichstaettisaurus&quot; display morphological adaptations associated with climbing. &quot;Eichstaettisaurus&quot; has been ranked as a stem gekkotan, but its true taxonomic rank is unclear.

The species &quot;Hoburogekko suchanovi&quot; and &quot;Gobekko cretacicus,&quot; dated to the Albian-Aptian ages (121–100 million years ago) ages of the Cretaceous period, are unquestionably members of Gekkota. They are thought to be members of the Gekkonidae, as well, but their taxonomic rank is uncertain due to the incompleteness of the fossil remains.

&quot;Yantarogekko balticus&quot; is the earliest known gekkonid gecko. &quot;Y. balticus&quot; was discovered in Baltic amber dated to the Eocene epoch (56–33.9 million years ago). This species was small, measuring only 20–22 mm from snout to vent. &quot;Y. balticus&quot; has enlarged, undivided scansorial pads and a reduced but strongly clawed first digit, and lacks movable eyelids. Together, these morphological traits are distinctive of the family Gekkonidae, and also indicate that &quot;Y. balticus&quot; may have had adhesive abilities similar to modern geckos.

== Distribution ==
Species within the Gekkonidae inhabit every warm region. Furthermore, many genera are capable of widespread geographical habitation, and can be considered invasive in some areas; the genus &quot;Hemidactylus&quot; can be identified in all subtropical areas of the world. However, many genera in the family Gekkonidae are endemic. For example, genera &quot;Afroedura&quot; and &quot;Afrogecko&quot; are found only in Africa. The range of genus &quot;Lepidodactylus&quot; stretches from South Asia to Oceania; this genus also accounts for several island species. The genera listed here do not account for all Gekkonidae subspecies and are used only as examples of distribution. For a full list, see section &#x27;Genera&#x27;.

==Genera==
Gekkonidae contains these genera:
Possibly belonging to the family:

&quot;Yantarogekko&quot; (fossil)

==Phylogeny==

<text>Bimetallism, also known as the bimetallic standard, is a monetary standard in which the value of the monetary unit is defined as equivalent to certain quantities of two metals, typically gold and silver, creating a fixed rate of exchange between them.

For scholarly purposes, &quot;proper&quot; bimetallism is sometimes distinguished as permitting that both gold and silver money are legal tender in unlimited amounts and that gold and silver may be taken to be coined by the government mints in unlimited quantities. This distinguishes it from &quot;limping standard&quot; bimetallism, where both gold and silver are legal tender but only one is freely coined (e.g. the monies of France, Germany, and the United States after 1873), and from &quot;trade&quot; bimetallism, where both metals are freely coined but only one is legal tender and the other is used as &quot;trade money&quot; (e.g. most monies in western Europe from the 13th to 18th centuries). Economists also distinguish &quot;legal&quot; bimetallism, where the law guarantees these conditions, and &quot;de facto&quot; bimetallism, where gold and silver coins circulate at a fixed rate.

During the 19th century there was a great deal of scholarly debate and political controversy regarding the use of bimetallism in place of a gold standard or silver standard (monometallism). Bimetallism was intended to increase the supply of money, stabilize prices, and facilitate setting exchange rates. Some scholars argued that bimetallism was inherently unstable owing to Gresham&#x27;s law, and that its replacement by a monometallic standard was inevitable. Other scholars claimed that in practice bimetallism had a stabilizing effect on economies. The controversy became largely moot after technological progress and the South African and Klondike Gold Rushes increased the supply of gold in circulation at the end of the century, ending most of the political pressure for greater use of silver. It became completely academic after the 1971 Nixon shock; since then, all of the world&#x27;s currencies have operated as more or less freely floating fiat money, unconnected to the value of silver or gold. Nonetheless, academics continue to debate, inconclusively, the relative use of the metallic standards.

==Historical creation==

From the 7th century BCE, Asia Minor, especially in the areas of Lydia and Ionia, is known to have created a coinage based on electrum, a natural occurring material that is a variable mix of gold and silver (with about 54% gold and 44% silver). Before Croesus, his father Alyattes had already started to mint various types of non-standardized electrum coins. They were in use in Lydia and surrounding areas for about 80 years. The unpredictability of its composition implied that it had a variable value which was very hard to determine, which greatly hampered its development.

===Croeseids===

Croesus (reigned – BCE), king of Lydia, who became associated with great wealth. Croesus is credited with issuing the Croeseid, the first true gold coins with a standardised purity for general circulation,

Herodotus mentioned the innovation made by the Lydians:

===Achaemenid coinage===

Many ancient bimetallic systems would follow, starting with Achaemenid coinage. From around 515 BCE under Darius I, the minting of Croesids in Sardis was replaced by the minting of Darics and Sigloi. The earliest gold coin of the Achaemenid Empire, the Daric, followed the weight standard of the Croeseid, and is therefore considered to be later and derived from the Croeseid. The weight of the Daric would then be modified through a metrological reform, probably under Darius I.

Sardis remained the central mint for the Persian Darics and Sigloi of Achaemenid coinage, and there is no evidence of other mints for the new Achaemenid coins during the whole time of the Achaemenid Empire. Although the gold Daric became an international currency which was found throughout the Ancient world, the circulation of the Sigloi remained very much limited to Asia Minor: important hoards of Sigloi are only found in these areas, and finds of Sigloi beyond are always very limited and marginal compared to Greek coins, even in Achaemenid territories.

==Argentina==

In 1881, a currency reform in Argentina introduced a bimetallic standard, which went into effect in July 1883. Units of gold and silver pesos would be exchanged with paper peso notes at given par values, and fixed exchange rates against key international currencies would thus be established. Unlike many metallic standards, the system was very decentralized: no national monetary authority existed, and all control over convertibility rested with the five banks of issue. This convertibility lasted only 17 months: from December 1884 the banks of issue refused to exchange gold at par for notes. The suspension of convertibility was soon accommodated by the Argentine government, since, having no institutional power over the monetary system, there was little they could do to prevent it.

==France==

A French law of 1803 granted anyone who brought gold or silver to its mint the right to have it coined at a nominal charge in addition to the official rates of 200 francs per kilogram of 90% silver, or 3100 francs per kilogram of 90% fine gold. This effectively established a bimetallic standard at the rate which had been used for French coinage since 1785, i.e. a relative valuation of gold to silver of 15.5 to 1. In 1803 this ratio was close to the market rate, but for most of the next half century the market rate was above 15.5 to 1. As a consequence, silver powered the French economy and gold was exported. But when the California Gold Rush increased the supply of gold, its value was reduced relative to silver. The market rate fell below 15.5 to 1, and remained below until 1866. Frenchmen responded by exporting silver to India and importing nearly two-fifths of the world&#x27;s production of gold in the period from 1848 to 1870. Napoleon III introduced five franc gold coins which provided a substitute for the silver five franc coins which were hoarded, but still maintained the formal bimetallism implicit in the 1803 law.

==Latin Monetary Union==

The national coinages introduced in Belgium (1832), Switzerland (1850), and Italy (1861) were based on France&#x27;s bimetallic currency. These countries joined France in a treaty signed on 23 December 1865 which established the Latin Monetary Union (LMU). Greece joined the LMU in 1868 and about twenty other countries adhered to its standards. The LMU effectively adopted bimetallism by allowing unlimited free coinage of gold and silver at the 15.5 to 1 rate used in France, but also began to back away from bimetallism by allowing limited issues of low denomination silver coins struck to a lower standard for government accounts. A surplus of silver led the LMU to limit free coinage of silver in 1874 and to end it in 1878, effectively abandoning bimetallism for the gold standard.

==United Kingdom==

Medieval and early modern England used both gold and silver, at fixed rates, to provide the necessary range of coin denominations; but silver coinage began to be restricted in the 18th century, first informally, and then by an Act of Parliament in 1774. After the suspension of metal convertibility from 1797 to 1819, Peel&#x27;s Bill set the country on the gold standard for the remainder of the century; however advocates of a return to bimetallism did not cease to appear. After the crash of 1825, William Huskisson argued strongly within the Government for bimetallism, as a way to increase credit (as well as to ease trade with South America). Similarly, after the banking crisis of 1847, Alexander Baring headed an external bimetallist movement hoping to prevent the undue restriction of the currency. It was, however, only in the last quarter of the century that the movement for bimetallism gathered real strength, drawing on Manchester cotton merchants and City financiers with Far East interests to offer a serious (if ultimately unsuccessful) challenge to the gold standard.

==United States==

In 1792, Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton proposed fixing the silver to gold exchange rate at 15:1, as well as establishing the mint for the public services of free coinage and currency regulation &quot;in order not to abridge the quantity of circulating medium&quot;. With its acceptance, of the Coinage Act of 1792 established: &quot;That the proportional value of gold to silver in all coins which shall by law be current as money within the United States, shall be as fifteen to one, according to quantity in weight, of pure gold or pure silver;&quot; the proportion had slipped by 1834 to sixteen to one. Silver took a further hit with the Coinage Act of 1853, when nearly all silver coin denominations were debased, effectively turning silver coinage into a fiduciary currency based on its face value rather than its weighted value. Bimetallism was effectively abandoned by the Coinage Act of 1873, but not formally outlawed as legal currency until the early 20th century. The merits of the system were the subject of debate in the late 19th century. If the market forces of supply and demand for either metal caused its bullion value to exceed its nominal currency value, it tends to disappear from circulation by hoarding or melting down.

===Political debate===

In the United States, bimetallism became a center of political conflict toward the end of the 19th century. During the Civil War, to finance the war the U.S. switched from bimetallism to a fiat money currency. After the war, in 1873, the government passed the Fourth Coinage Act and soon resumption of specie payments began (without the free and unlimited coinage of silver, thus putting the U.S. on a mono-metallic gold standard.) Farmers, debtors, Westerners and others who felt they had benefited from wartime paper money formed the short-lived Greenback Party to press for cheap paper money backed by silver. The latter element—&quot;free silver&quot;—came increasingly to the fore as the answer to the same interest groups&#x27; concerns, and was taken up as a central plank by the Populist movement. Proponents of monetary silver, known as the silverites, referred back to the Fourth Coinage Act as &quot;The Crime of &#x27;73&quot;, as it was judged to have inhibited inflation, and favored creditors over debtors. Some reformers, however, like Henry Demarest Lloyd, saw bimetallism as a red herring and feared that free silver was &quot;the cowbird of the reform movement&quot;, likely to push the other eggs out of the nest. Nevertheless, the Panic of 1893, a severe nationwide depression, brought the money issue strongly to the fore again. The &quot;silverites&quot; argued that using silver would inflate the money supply and mean more cash for everyone, which they equated with prosperity. The gold advocates claimed that silver would permanently depress the economy, but that sound money produced by a gold standard would restore prosperity.

Bimetallism and &quot;Free Silver&quot; were demanded by William Jennings Bryan who took over leadership of the Democratic Party in 1896, as well as by the Populists. They were joined by a faction of Republicans from silver mining regions in the West, known as the Silver Republicans, who also endorsed Bryan. The Republican Party itself nominated William McKinley on a platform supporting the gold standard, which was favored by financial interests on the East Coast.

In support of the cause, Bryan gave the famous &quot;Cross of Gold&quot; speech at the National Democratic Convention on July 9, 1896, asserting that &quot;The gold standard has slain tens of thousands.&quot; He referred to &quot;a struggle between &#x27;the idle holders of idle capital&#x27; and &#x27;the struggling masses, who produce the wealth and pay the taxes of the country;&#x27; and, my friends, the question we are to decide is: Upon which side will the Democratic party fight?&quot; At the peroration, he said: &quot;You shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns, you shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold.&quot; However, his presidential campaign was ultimately unsuccessful; this can be partially attributed to the discovery of the cyanide process by which gold could be extracted from low-grade ore. This process and the discoveries of large gold deposits in South Africa (Witwatersrand Gold Rush of 1887 – with large-scale production starting in 1898) and the Klondike Gold Rush (1896) increased the world gold supply and the subsequent increase in money supply that free coinage of silver was supposed to bring. The McKinley campaign was effective at persuading voters in the business East that poor economic progress and unemployment would be exacerbated by the adoption of the Bryan platform. 1896 saw the election of McKinley. The direct link to gold was abandoned in 1934 in Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal program and later the link was broken by Richard Nixon when he closed the gold window.

===Economic analysis===

In 1992, economist Milton Friedman concluded that abandonment of the bimetallic standard in 1873 led to greater price instability than would have occurred otherwise, and thus resulted in long-term harm to the US economy. His retrospective analysis led him to write that the act of 1873 was &quot;a mistake that had highly adverse consequences&quot;.

<text>Harold Eugene &quot;Hal&quot; Roach Sr. (January 14, 1892 – November 2, 1992) was an American film and television producer, director and screenwriter, who was the founder of the namesake Hal Roach Studios.

Roach was active in the industry from the 1910s to the 1990s. He is known for producing a number of early Media franchise successes, including the Laurel and Hardy franchise, Harold Lloyd&#x27;s early films, the films of entertainer Charley Chase, and the &quot;Our Gang&quot; short film comedy series.

==Early life ==
Roach was born in Elmira, New York, to Charles Henry Roach, whose father was born in Wicklow, County Wicklow, Ireland, and Mabel Gertrude Bally, her father John Bally being from Switzerland. A presentation by the American humorist Mark Twain impressed Roach as a young grade school student.

Hal&#x27;s first job was as a newspaper deliverer. One of his customers lived at Quarry Farm - Samuel Clemens, more widely known as Mark Twain.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;chemung/Roach&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==
After an adventurous youth that took him to Alaska, Roach arrived in Hollywood in 1912 and began working as an extra in silent films. 

When Hal Roach came to Southern California at the age of 20, he had reached the tail end of a four-year trek across America, which took him from his hometown of Elmira, New York to Alaska, and down the Pacific Coast. Along the way, he picked up the know-how necessary to land work as an extra in a J. Warren Kerrigan western, which was being filmed on location in the desert. It was here that he first met fellow player Harold Lloyd, the first of many talents whom Hal Roach would nurture and build a fortune on. During the filming of a roulette sequence, Roach got himself promoted to the position of technical advisor by pointing out that the ball has to travel in the opposite direction of the wheel – knowledge he had gained in San Francisco&#x27;s Barbary Coast.&lt;ref name=&quot;silentfilm/HR&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
==Pathé Exchange==
On 23 July 1914, Roach incorporated &quot;Rolin Film Company&quot; with Dan Linthicum and I.H. Nance.

In 1914, the Lewis Leonard Bradbury (November 6, 1823 – July 15, 1892) mansion, on the corner of Court Street and Hill Street, Bunker Hill, Los Angeles, California, was Roach&#x27;s film studio.

Upon coming into an inheritance,&lt;ref name=&quot;latimes/1992-11-03-mn-1245&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; in 1915 he began producing short film comedies with his friend Harold Lloyd, who portrayed a character known as Willie Work, as in &quot;Willie Runs the Park&quot; and Lonesome Luke, as in &quot;Lonesome Luke, Social Gangster&quot;. 

In 1915, his first success, &quot;Just Nuts&quot; (1915), landed a long-standing distribution deal with Pathé Exchange.&lt;ref name=&quot;se/HR&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Unable to expand his studios in Downtown Los Angeles because of zoning, Roach leased&lt;ref name=&quot;ccHS/hrs&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; several studio sites in the Los Angeles area until he purchased what became the Hal Roach Studios from Harry Culver in Culver City, California, at 8822 Washington Boulevard, and built by 1920.&lt;ref name=&quot;DoAhr/HRS&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1920s and 1930s, he employed Lloyd (his top money-maker until his departure in 1923), Will Rogers, Max Davidson, the Our Gang children, Charley Chase, Harry Langdon, Thelma Todd, ZaSu Pitts, Patsy Kelly and, most famously, Laurel and Hardy. During the 1920s, Roach&#x27;s biggest rival was producer Mack Sennett. In 1925, Roach hired away Sennett&#x27;s supervising director, F. Richard Jones.&lt;ref name=&quot;HwoF/HR&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer==
Roach released his films through Pathé Exchange until 1927, when he struck a distribution deal with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. He converted his silent-movie studio to sound in late 1928 and began releasing talking shorts in early 1929. In the days before dubbing, foreign-language versions of the Roach comedies were created by reshooting each film in Spanish, French, and occasionally Italian and German. Laurel &amp; Hardy, Charley Chase, and the Our Gang kids (some of whom had barely begun school) were required to recite the foreign dialogue phonetically, often working from blackboards hidden off-camera.

In 1931, with the release of the Laurel &amp; Hardy film &quot;Pardon Us&quot;, Roach began producing occasional full-length features alongside the short subjects. Two-reel comedies were less profitable than features, and Roach phased most of them out by 1936. When the &quot;Our Gang&quot; feature film &quot;General Spanky&quot; did not do as well as expected, Roach intended to disband Our Gang entirely. MGM still wanted the Our Gang short subjects, so Roach agreed to supply them in single-reel (10-minute) form.

Roach was also a good friend to Walt Disney, who was a fan of Laurel and Hardy at the time. A monkey dressed in a Mickey Mouse costume as well as actors in Three Little Pigs costumes appeared in the 1934 Laurel and Hardy film &quot;March of the Wooden Soldiers&quot;. Mickey Mouse also appeared in &quot;Hollywood Party&quot;, also from 1934 and featuring Laurel and Hardy.

==Mussolini==
In 1937, Renato Senise,&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes/Senise&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;time/mussolini-roach&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; nephew of Carmine Senise, the then deputy chief of the Italian police,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bonsaver/Senise&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; conceived a joint business venture of Roach partnering with Vittorio Mussolini,&lt;ref name=&quot;Reuters/Vittorio/NYC&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; son of fascist Italian dictator Benito Mussolini, to form a production company called &quot;R.A.M.&quot; (Roach and Mussolini). On 11 September 1937, Roach and Vittorio Mussolini formed R.A.M. Productions.

Roach claimed the scheme involved Italian bankers providing US$6 million that would enable Roach&#x27;s studio to produce a series of 12 films. Eight would be for Italian screening only while the remaining four would receive world distribution. The first film for Italy was to be a feature film of the opera &quot;Rigoletto&quot;.

The Hollywood Anti-Nazi League for the Defense of American Democracy resented Mussolini&#x27;s presence and placed notices in various trade magazines: &quot;He asked for - and received - the privilege of being the first aviator to bomb helpless Ethiopians . . . his presence here is not an occasion for celebration or social fetes. Those who welcome him are opening their arms to a friend of Hitler and an enemy of democracy.&quot;

Roach defended himself by saying:

You don’t know, but that I might have dinner with Mussolini when I go back to Italy. Maybe I can suggest to him that Hitler is not going quite right about things and maybe Mussolini will write Hitler a note and tell him so... I never made a move in Europe in this matter at any time without the advice and cooperation of some of the most prominent Jews there who told me I was doing the finest thing ever done in their estimation — tying up with Mussolini’s son and taking the boy back to Hollywood...

This proposed business alliance with Mussolini alarmed MGM, which intervened and forced Roach to buy his way out of the venture. Loews chairman Nicholas Schenck was so upset this incident, combined with the underperformance of much of Roach&#x27;s latest feature-film output (except Laurel &amp; Hardy titles and the 1937 hit &quot;Topper&quot;), that he ultimately canceled Roach&#x27;s distribution contract with MGM.&lt;ref name=&quot;hollywoodreporter/167559&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Artists==
In May 1938, Roach sold MGM the production rights and actors contracts to the &quot;Our Gang&quot; shorts. Roach signed a distribution deal with United Artists at this time.

From 1937 to 1940, Roach concentrated on producing glossy features, abandoning low comedy almost completely. Most of his new films were either sophisticated farces (like &quot;Topper&quot; and &quot;The Housekeeper&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, 1939) or rugged action fare (like &quot;Captain Fury&quot;, 1939, and &quot;One Million B.C.&quot;, 1940). Roach&#x27;s one venture into heavy drama was the acclaimed &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; (1939), in which actors Burgess Meredith and Lon Chaney Jr. played the leading roles. The Laurel and Hardy comedies, once the Roach studio&#x27;s biggest drawing cards, were now the studio&#x27;s least important product and were phased out altogether in 1940.

In 1940, Roach experimented with medium-length featurettes, running 40 to 50 minutes each. He contended that these &quot;streamliners&quot;, as he called them, would be useful in double feature situations where the main attraction was a longer-length epic. Exhibitors agreed with him and used Roach&#x27;s mini-features to balance top-heavy double bills. He had intended to introduce the new format with a series of four Laurel and Hardy featurettes, but was overruled by United Artists, which insisted on two Laurel &amp; Hardy feature films instead. United Artists continued to release Roach&#x27;s streamliners through 1943. By this time, Roach no longer had a resident company of comedy stars and cast his films with familiar featured players (William Tracy and Joe Sawyer, Johnny Downs, Jean Porter, Frank Faylen, William Bendix, George E. Stone, Bobby Watson, etc.).

Recognizing the value of his film library, in 1943 Roach began licensing revivals of his older productions for theatrical distribution through Film Classics, Inc. and home-movie distribution.

==World War II==
Hal Roach Sr., commissioned in the U.S. Army Signal Reserve Corps in 1927, was called back to active military duty in the Signal Corps in June 1942, at age 50. The studio output he oversaw in uniform was converted from entertainment featurettes to military training films. The studios were leased to the U.S. Army Air Forces, and the First Motion Picture Unit made 400 training, morale and propaganda films at &quot;Fort Roach.&quot; Members of the unit included Ronald Reagan and Alan Ladd. After the war the government returned the studio to Roach, with millions of dollars of improvements.

==Television==
In 1946, Hal Roach resumed motion picture production, with former Harold Lloyd co-star Bebe Daniels as an associate producer. Roach was the first Hollywood producer to adopt an all-color production schedule, making four streamliners in Cinecolor, although the increased production costs did not result in increased revenue. In 1948, with his studio deeply in debt, Roach re-established his studio for television production, with Hal Roach Jr., producing series such as &quot;The Stu Erwin Show&quot;, &quot;Steve Donovan, Western Marshal&quot;, &quot;Racket Squad&quot;, &quot;The Public Defender&quot;, &quot;The Gale Storm Show&quot;, &quot;Rocky Jones, Space Ranger&quot; and &quot;My Little Margie&quot;, and independent producers leasing the facilities for such programs as &quot;Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy&quot;, &quot;The Life of Riley&quot; and &quot;The Abbott and Costello Show&quot;. By 1951, the studio was producing 1,500 hours of television programs a year, nearly three times Hollywood&#x27;s annual output of feature movies.

Roach&#x27;s old theatrical films were also early arrivals on television. His Laurel and Hardy comedies were successful in television syndication, as were the &quot;Our Gang&quot; comedies he produced from 1929 to 1938.

==Later years==
In 1955, Roach sold his interests in the production company to his son, Hal Roach Jr., and retired from active production. The younger Roach lacked much of his father&#x27;s business acumen and was forced to sell the studio in 1958 to The Scranton Corporation, a division of the automobile-parts conglomerate F. L. Jacobs Co. The Roach studio finally shut down in 1961.

For two more decades, Roach Sr. occasionally worked as a consultant on projects related to his past work. In 1983 the &quot;Hal Roach Studios&quot; name was reactivated as a video concern, pioneering the new field of colorizing movies. Roach lent his film library to the cause but was otherwise not involved in the new video productions. Extremely vigorous into an advanced age, Roach contemplated a comedy comeback at 96.

In 1984, 92-year-old Roach was presented with an honorary Academy Award. Former &quot;Our Gang&quot; members Jackie Cooper and George &quot;Spanky&quot; McFarland made the presentation to a flattered Roach, with McFarland thanking the producer for hiring him 53 years prior. An additional &quot;Our Gang&quot; member, Ernie Morrison, was in the crowd and started the standing ovation for Roach. Years earlier Cooper had been the youngest Academy Award nominee ever for his performance in &quot;Skippy&quot; when he had been under contract with Roach. Although Paramount had paid Roach $25,000 for Cooper&#x27;s services in that film, Roach paid Cooper only his standard salary of $50 per week.

On January 21, 1992, Roach was a guest on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;, guest-hosted by Jay Leno, one week after his 100th birthday. During the interview, Roach recounted experiences with such stars as Stan Laurel and Jean Harlow; he even did a brief, energetic demonstration of the &quot;humble hula&quot; dance. In February 1992, Roach traveled to Berlin to receive the honorary award of the &quot;Berlinale Kamera&quot; for Lifetime Achievement at the 42nd Berlin International Film Festival.

On March 30, 1992, Roach appeared at the 64th Academy Awards ceremony, hosted by Billy Crystal. When Roach rose from the audience to a standing ovation, he decided to give a speech without a microphone, causing Crystal to quip &quot;I think that&#x27;s appropriate because Mr. Roach started in silent films.&quot;

==Personal life==
In 1916, Roach&#x27;s mother and father moved into Roach&#x27;s studio in Culver City, living there until their death.

In September 1916, Roach married actress Marguerite Nichols, who worked as an actress in the 1930s and 1940s, and died in March 1941. They had two children, Hal Roach Jr., who followed his father as a producer and director, and Margaret Roach.

Roach married a second time, on September 1, 1942, to Lucille Prin, a Los Angeles secretary. They were married at the on-base home of Colonel Franklin C. Wolfe and his wife at Wright-Patterson Airfield in Dayton, Ohio, where Roach was stationed at the time while serving as a major in the United States Army Air Corps. Roach and Lucille had four children, Elizabeth Carson Roach (December 26, 1945 – September 5, 1946), Maria May Roach (born April 14, 1947), Jeanne Alice Roach (born October 7, 1949), and Kathleen Bridget Roach (born January 29, 1951).

Hal Roach died in his home in Bel Air, Los Angeles, from pneumonia, on November 2, 1992, at the age of 100. He had married twice, and had six children, eight grandchildren, and a number of great-grandchildren. Roach outlived three of his children by more than 20 years: Hal Jr. (died in 1972), Margaret (died in 1964), and Elizabeth (died in 1946). He also outlived many of the children who starred in his films. Roach is buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in Elmira, New York, where he grew up.

==Legacy==
In the 2018 Laurel and Hardy biopic &quot;Stan &amp; Ollie&quot;, Roach was portrayed by Danny Huston.

In 2020, Rose McGowan alleged that, in 1937, Roach was responsible for a case of large-scale sexual abuse of actresses. The closest link to such accusations against him is that an infamous sex party was held by MGM at the Hal Roach Ranch, which was used by the company as a studio. This is also in relation to one of the earliest reports of rape in Hollywood, filed by blacklisted dancer and extra Patricia Douglas, which was later covered in the documentary &quot;Girl 27&quot;, a production McGowan herself has praised for educating on sexual abuse in Hollywood.

<doc id="310163" wikidata="Q11145023" url="?curid=310163" title="Sant Antoni de Portmany">
<text>Sant Antoni de Portmany (; ), or simply Sant Antoni (), is a town on the western coast of Ibiza, the second-largest town and municipality on the island. It is situated on Sant Antoni Bay on the west coast of the island, part of the Spain autonomous community of the Balearic Islands.

==History==
For two thousand years, Sant Antoni was a small fishing village that rose from the Roman natural harbor Portus Magnus, but it began to grow in the late 1950s when many hotels and tourist resorts were built as part of a mass tourism initiative which took place across Spain. As the number of tourists grew, the development of bars, hotels and other tourist infrastructure spread right around to the other side of San Antonio bay, as far as Cala de Bou which lies in the adjacent municipality of Sant Josep de sa Talaia. Since the 1980s British tourists have made up the majority of summertime visitors to San Antonio.

===The Egg===
The Egg is a statue erected in the early 1990s to commemorate the local claim of having been the birthplace of Christopher Columbus (there is a similar claim that Hannibal was born in the region). The statue is in the shape of an egg, containing at its centre a model of his ship: the Santa Maria.

The choice of an egg comes from a story about Columbus, who when seeking funding for his Western route to the Indies, was told it was impossible. He then allegedly asked if standing an egg upright was impossible, and when told that it was, he cracked the base of an egg, thus making it possible for it to stand upright. He was then granted funding. See Egg of Columbus.

===Passeig de ses Fonts===

Part of Sant Antoni&#x27;s harbourside promenade, Passeig de ses Fonts, is an area which was developed in the early 1990s to improve the appearance of the town. There are many plants, including palm trees and rubber plants, as well as large fountains, which are illuminated by night. Across the square are a host of restaurants and cafés offering a view over Sant Antoni Bay. It is also the best place from which to watch the massive fireworks display which celebrates the fiesta of Saint Bartholomew on 24 August.

===West End===
The &#x27;West End&#x27; is an area of San Antonio. Only a couple of streets wide; the main street is the Carrer de Santa Agnès, it hosts a variety of bars ranging from the dance and house music Ibiza is famed for to rock and indie music. 
Originally the name &quot;The West End&quot; refers to a night time minibus trip from hotels in Es Cana in the 1970s that would come to San Antonio&#x27;s bars (as Es Cana had no bar scene) and the name of this tour package was &quot;The West End Experience&quot;. Since then the area has become known simply as &quot;The West End&quot;.

===Sunset Strip===
Along the coast of the natural bay of San Antonio de Portmany in the west is the Sunset Strip - a venue where visitors to the island meet at sunset at various bars including the Café del Mar, Café Mambo, where the likes of Swedish House Mafia, Carl Cox, David Guetta and Pete Tong DJ on a regular basis. The west-facing strip of coastline means that it faces the sunset.

===Ferries and boat cruises===
Among the harbour of San Antonio there are various boats and ferries that have multiple connections to beaches. These have daily departures from may until end September or October. Also once a week there is a ferry to Formentera.

<doc id="310167" wikidata="Q932302" url="?curid=310167" title="Dingle">
<text>Dingle ( or &quot;Daingean Uí Chúis&quot;, meaning &quot;fort of Ó Cúis&quot;) is a town in County Kerry, Ireland. The only town on the Dingle Peninsula, it sits on the Atlantic coast, about southwest of Tralee and northwest of Killarney. Principal industries in the town are tourism, fishing and agriculture: Dingle Mart (livestock market) serves the surrounding countryside.

In 2022, Dingle had a population of 1,671, a decrease from the 2016 census, and the oldest average age for a town in Ireland (44.4 years). Situated in a &quot;Gaeltacht&quot; region, 13.7% of the population spoke Irish on a daily basis in 2016. An adult Bottlenose dolphin named Fungie had been courting human contact in Dingle Bay since 1983 but disappeared in 2020.

==History==
A large number of Ogham stones were set up in an enclosure in the 4th and 5th centuries AD at Ballintaggart.

The town developed as a port following the Norman invasion of Ireland. By the thirteenth century, more goods were being exported through Dingle than Limerick, and in 1257 an ordinance of King Henry III imposed customs on the port&#x27;s exports. By the fourteenth century, importing wine was a major business. The 1st Earl of Desmond, who held palatine powers in the area, imposed a tax on this activity around 1329. By the sixteenth century, Dingle was one of Ireland&#x27;s main trading ports, exporting fish and hides and importing wines from the continent of Europe. French and Spanish fishing fleets used the town as a base.

Connections with Spain were particularly strong and, in 1529, Thomas Fitzgerald, 11th Earl of Desmond and the ambassador of Emperor Charles V signed the Treaty of Dingle. Dingle was also a major embarkation port for pilgrims to travel to the shrine of Saint James at Santiago de Compostela. The parish church was rebuilt in the sixteenth century under &quot;Spanish patronage&quot; and dedicated to the saint.

In 1569 the commerce of the town was increased when it was listed as one of fifteen towns or cities which were to have a monopoly on the import of wine.

===Second Desmond Rebellion===
The Dingle Peninsula was the scene of much of the military activity of 1579–80. On 17 July 1579 James FitzMaurice FitzGerald brought a small fleet of ships to Dingle. He made landfall, launching the Second Desmond Rebellion, but was to die soon after in a minor skirmish with the forces of a cousin. The fleet left the town after three days, anchoring at &quot;Dún an Óir&quot; at the western end of the peninsula, leading eventually to the Siege of Smerwick of 1580.

===Walled town and chartered borough===
The residents of Dingle applied in 1569 for a &quot;murage grant&quot; to construct walls around the town. The grant was not forthcoming on that occasion. Following the defeat of the Desmond Rebellion, Queen Elizabeth directed that a royal charter be granted to incorporate the town as a borough, and to allow for the construction of walls. Traces of these town walls can still be seen, while the street layout preserves the pattern of burgage plots.

Although Elizabeth intended to grant a charter, the document was only obtained in 1607. On 2 March of that year her successor, James I, sealed the charter, although the borough and its corporation had already been in existence for twenty-two years. The head of the corporation was the sovereign, fulfilling the role of a mayor. In addition to the sovereign, who was elected annually on the Feast of St Michael, the corporation consisted of twelve burgesses. The area of jurisdiction of the corporation was all land and sea within two Irish miles of the parish church. The borough also had admiralty jurisdiction over Dingle, Ventry, Smerwick and Ferriter&#x27;s Creek &quot;as far as an arrow would fly&quot;.

The charter also created Dingle a parliamentary borough, or constituency, electing two members to the House of Commons of the Irish Parliament.

===Linen===

Dingle suffered greatly in the Nine Years&#x27; War and the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, being burnt or sacked on a number of occasions. The town started to recover in the eighteenth century, due to the efforts of the Fitzgerald family, Knights of Kerry, who established themselves at &quot;The Grove&quot; at this time. Robert Fitzgerald imported flax seed and by 1755 a flourishing linen industry had been established, with cloth worth £60,000 produced annually. The trade collapsed following the industrial production of cotton in Great Britain, and was virtually extinct by 1837. The town fell victim to a cholera plague in 1849.

===Fishing===
Dingle is a major fishing port, and the industry dates back to about 1830. The 1870s saw major development, when &quot;nobby&quot; fleets from the Isle of Man came in search of mackerel. Lowestoft herring trawlers subsequently joined the fleet, allowing for a longer fishing season. The pier and maritime facilities were developed by the Congested Districts Board, and the arrival of rail transport in 1891 allowed for the transport of fish throughout the country, and a canning and curing industry developed.

===Education===
There are three primary schools in Dingle: Scoil An Ghleanna, Scoil Iognáid Rís and Bunscoil an Clochair. There are also two secondary schools – Pobalscoil Chorca Dhuibhne and Coláiste Íde Boarding School. Dingle as part of the Corca Dhuibhne Gaeltacht also hosts Irish School for students during the summer.

The Sacred Heart University, Connecticut, USA, has an Irish studies centre in Dingle.

==Places of interest==
Dingle&#x27;s St. Mary&#x27;s is a neo-Gothic church built to designs by J. J. McCarthy and O&#x27;Connell. The foundation stone was laid in 1862. It originally had a nave and aisles separated by arcades, supported on columns capped by octagonal tops. The arcades were demolished in one of the most radical reordering schemes to have been executed in Ireland. The project also saw the demolition of the exterior walls to below the original clerestory level, and, most notably, of the attic and upper ranges of the west elevation.

The Chapel of the Sacred Heart is a neo-gothic chapel attached to Saint Mary&#x27;s. It was built for a local enclosed order of Presentation Sisters, by the architect C. J. McCarthy in 1886. The major Irish artist Harry Clarke produced six double-lancet stained glass windows for the chapel which were installed in 1924. The lancets depict scenes from the life of Christ. Clarke was at the time a leading figure in the Arts and Crafts movement and was paid a fee of £1,000 for the works.

Irish traditional music is played in several locations, particularly during the summer tourist season. Dingle has a number of pubs, restaurants and cafes. The aquarium, &quot;Oceanworld Aquarium&quot;, is home to tropical, foreign and native animals, and a number of art and craft shops.

Dingle is home to Murphy&#x27;s Ice Cream, a cafe that serves ice cream and coffee. Murphy&#x27;s has homemade ice cream made from Kerry cattle. Another business, Dingle Distillery, was launched in 2012.

Gallaunmore, a standing stone and National Monument, lies 3 km (2 miles) to the east.

St. Manchan&#x27;s Oratory (An Teampall Geal), a medieval oratory with ogham stone and souterrain, lies on nearby Lateeve Hill.

==Sport==
Dingle is home to the Dingle GAA club, which fields Gaelic football teams. The most noted tournament in which Dingle competes is the Kerry Senior Football Championship. Rugbaí Chorca Dhuibhne, the local rugby team, and Dingle Bay Rovers F.C. are also based in the area.

The yearly Dingle Marathon started in 2009, when John Griffin, a former winner of the Dublin Marathon, won the race at 50 years old. The full marathon begins and ends in Dingle town, taking in Slea Head and the Dingle Peninsula on its route, whilst the half marathon goes from Dingle to Dun Chaoin. The inaugural event had 2,500 participants, and participation peaked at approximately 3,500 participants in 2018. The course is certified by the Athletics Association of Ireland.

==Transport==
Bus routes serving Dingle include routes to Killarney, to Tralee, to Kerry Airport, to Cloghane (via Castlegregory), and to Ballydavid (via Ballyferriter and Dunquin).

Dingle was formerly the western terminus of the narrow-gauge Tralee and Dingle Light Railway, which closed in 1953. The station was sited opposite the hospital, on the N86 road into the town from Lispole, where an undertakers premises and disused petrol station now stand. The railway station opened on 1 April 1891, closed for passenger traffic on 17 April 1939 and for regular goods traffic on 10 March 1947, finally closing altogether on 1 July 1953, by which time a cattle train once per month was the sole operation.

Today, the closest train terminal is Tralee, with bus services operating from Tralee Bus and Rail Stations. In addition, bus services operate from Killarney Bus and Rail Stations to Dingle.

==Name==
In 2005, Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs Éamon Ó Cuív announced that anglicised place names (such as &#x27;Dingle&#x27;) of &quot;Gaeltacht&quot; towns and villages would no longer feature on official signposts, and only the Irish language names would appear. The English-language version of the town&#x27;s name was thus officially dropped in early 2005, with the largely colloquial Irish name &quot;An Daingean&quot; being advanced.

In the case of Dingle, the move was particularly controversial, as the town relies heavily on the tourist industry, and there was fear that the change could prevent visitors from finding the town. Detractors noted that tourists might not recognise the Irish name on signposts and that there could also be confusion with a similarly named town (Daingean) in County Offaly. Supporters rejected this argument, pointing out that there are numerous towns in Ireland with similar names. The minister added to the controversy by suggesting that a name change to English could be brought about by removing the town&#x27;s &quot;Gaeltacht&quot; status, thereby losing its entitlement to government grants for Irish-speaking areas.

In late 2005, Kerry County Council approved the holding of a plebiscite for the change of name to the bilingual &quot;Dingle/&quot;Daingean Uí Chúis&quot;&quot; which took place in October 2006. The result was announced on 20 October, and 1,005 of the 1,086 returned ballots (electorate: 1,222) favoured the change to the bilingual version. Éamon Ó Cuív stated, however, that there was no remit to act on the results of the plebiscite. Nevertheless, in 2008, Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government John Gormley announced his intention to amend the local government laws to allow names chosen by plebiscite to supersede any Placenames Order under the &quot;Official Languages Act 2003&quot;. This would mean that &quot;Daingean Uí Chúis&quot; would be the official name of the town in Irish, with &quot;Dingle&quot; the official name in English. However, the name of the town on road signs within the &quot;Gaeltacht&quot; will continue to display the name of the town in Irish only. In the meantime, some locals took matters into their own hands by spray painting &quot;Dingle&quot; on road signs that bore only the Irish version of the name. Section 48 of the Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 specifically made &quot;Dingle&quot; the English name and &quot;Daingean Uí Chúis&quot; the Irish name.

<text>Dawn Silva is an American funk vocalist.

Silva started her career as a background vocalist for Sly and the Family Stone. She joined Parliament-Funkadelic in 1977. She was the only original Brides of Funkenstein member to continue through the Brides&#x27; entire career. In 1978, with Lynn Mabry, she released the successful &quot;Funk Or Walk&quot;. The Brides&#x27; first single release on Atlantic Records, &quot;Disco To Go&quot;, sold over five hundred thousand units, and was certified Gold. In 1979, with Sheila Horne and Jeanette McGruder, the Brides released the single &quot;Never Buy Texas From A Cowboy&quot;. In 1981, The Brides became the only group in the P-Funk organization to receive a Rhythm and Blues Award for the &quot;Never Buy Texas From A Cowboy&quot; album. It was voted by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 2001 as one of the top 50 coolest albums ever released.

== Later career ==
Silva recorded and toured with The Gap Band in 1982. She signed a solo deal with Polygram Records in 1988, but her debut album was never released.

Her recording and touring credits include but are not limited to; Ice Cube, Boyz n the Hood, Roy Ayers, Snoop Dogg, Coolio, B.B. King, and Parliament Funkadelic. Her first solo album release in Europe on Musisoft (Paris France) &quot;All My Funky Friends&quot;, December 2000, sold thousands of units, and was hailed by Tower Records (2001) as the only authentic funk album to be released in over two decades.

<text>Indian philosophy consists of philosophical traditions of the Indian subcontinent. The philosophies are often called darśana meaning, &quot;to see&quot; or &quot;looking at.&quot; Ānvīkṣikī means “critical inquiry” or “investigation.&quot; Unlike darśana, ānvīkṣikī was used to refer to Indian philosophies by classical Indian philosophers, such as Chanakya in the Arthaśāstra. 

A traditional Hindu classification divides āstika and nāstika schools of philosophy, depending on one of three alternate criteria: whether it believes the Vedas as a valid source of knowledge; whether the school believes in the premises of Brahman and Atman; and whether the school believes in afterlife and Devas. (though there are exceptions to the latter two: Mimamsa and Samkhya respectively).

There are six major (āstika) schools of Vedic philosophy—Nyaya, Vaisheshika, Samkhya, Yoga, Mīmāṃsā and Vedanta—and five major non-Vedic or heterodox (nāstika or sramanic) schools—Jain, Buddhist, Ajivika, Ajñana, and Charvaka. The āstika group embraces the Vedas as an essential source of its foundations, while the nāstika group does not. However, there are other methods of classification; Vidyaranya for instance identifies sixteen schools of Indian philosophy by including those that belong to the Śaiva and Raseśvara traditions.

The main schools of Indian philosophy were formalised and recognised chiefly between 500 BCE and the late centuries of the Common Era. Some schools like Jainism, Buddhism, Yoga, Śaiva and Vedanta survived, but others, like Ajñana, Charvaka and Ājīvika did not.

Ancient and medieval era texts of Indian philosophies include extensive discussions on ontology (metaphysics, Brahman-Atman, Sunyata-Anatta), reliable means of knowledge (epistemology, Pramanas), value system (axiology) and other topics.

==Common themes==
Indian philosophies share many concepts such as dharma, karma, samsara, dukkha, renunciation, meditation, with almost all of them focusing on the ultimate goal of liberation of the individual from dukkha and samsara through diverse range of spiritual practices (moksha, nirvana). While many sutra texts explicitly mention that the work leads to moksha, Indian philosophy is not exclusively concerned with moksha.

They differ in their assumptions about the nature of existence as well as the specifics of the path to the ultimate liberation, resulting in numerous schools that disagreed with each other. Their ancient doctrines span the diverse range of philosophies found in other ancient cultures.

==Hindu traditions==

Some of the earliest surviving Indian philosophical texts are the Upanishads of the later Vedic period (1000–500 BCE), which are considered to preserve the ideas of Brahmanism. Indian philosophical traditions are commonly grouped according to their relationship to the Vedas and the ideas contained in them. The origins of Jainism remain enigmatic, with scholarly consensus divided between pre-Vedic roots, parallel development alongside Vedic civilization or post-Vedic emergence. The historical presence of its 23rd Tirthankara, Parshvanatha in the 8th-7th century BCE provides one of the earliest anchors of the tradition. Despite the accepted historicity of Parshvanath, the historical claims such as the link between him and Mahavira, whether Mahavira renounced in the ascetic tradition of Parshvanatha, and other biographical details have led to different scholarly conclusions. Doubts about Parshvanatha&#x27;s historicity are also supported by the oldest Jain texts, which present Mahavira with sporadic mentions of ancient ascetics and teachers without specific names (such as sections 1.4.1 and 1.6.3 of the &quot;Acaranga Sutra&quot;).. Even the early archaeological finds, such as the statues and reliefs near Mathura, lack iconography such as lions and serpents. Buddhism also originated at the end of the Vedic period. These traditions drew upon already established Brahmanical concepts, states Wiltshire, to communicate their own distinct doctrines.

Hindu philosophy classify Indian philosophical traditions as either orthodox (&quot;āstika&quot;) or heterodox (&quot;nāstika&quot;), depending on whether they accept the authority of the Vedas and the theories of &quot;brahman&quot; and &quot;ātman&quot; found therein. Besides these, the &quot;heterodox&quot; schools that do &quot;not&quot; accept the authority of the Vedas include Buddhism, Jainism, Ajivika and Charvaka. 

This orthodox-heterodox terminology is a scholarly construct found in later Indian sources (and in Western sources on Indian thought) and not all of these sources agree on which system should be considered &quot;orthodox&quot;. As such there are various heresiological systems in Indian philosophy. Some traditions see &quot;orthodox&quot; as a synonym for &quot;theism&quot; and &quot;heterodox&quot; as a synonym for atheism. Other Hindu sources argue that certain systems of Shaiva tantra should be considered heterodox due to its deviations from the Vedic tradition. 

One of the most common list of Hindu orthodox schools is the &quot;six philosophies&quot; (&quot;ṣaḍ-darśana&quot;), which are: 

* Sāṃkhya (school of &quot;Enumeration&quot;), a philosophical tradition which regards the universe as consisting of two independent realities: &quot;puruṣa&quot; (the perceiving consciousness) and &quot;prakṛti&quot; (perceived reality, including mind, perception, &quot;kleshas&quot;, and matter) and which describes a soteriology based on this duality, in which &quot;purush&quot; is discerned and disentangled from the impurities of &quot;prakriti&quot;. It has included atheistic authors as well as some theistic thinkers, and forms the basis of much of subsequent Indian philosophy.
* Yoga, a school similar to &quot;Sāṃkhya&quot; (or perhaps even a branch of it) which accepts a personal god and focuses on yogic practice.
* Nyāya (the &quot;Logic&quot; school), a philosophy which focuses on logic and epistemology. It accepts four kinds of &quot;Pramā&quot; (valid presentation): (1) perception, (2) inference, (3) comparison or analogy, (4) word or testimony. &quot;Nyāya&quot; defends a form of direct realism and a theory of substances (&quot;dravya&quot;).
* Vaiśeṣika (the school of &quot;Characteristics&quot;), closely related to the &quot;Nyāya&quot; school, this tradition focused on the metaphysics of substance, and on defending a theory of atoms. Unlike &quot;Nyāya&quot;, they only accept two pramanas: perception and inference.
* Pūrva-Mīmāṃsā (the school of &quot;Prior Investigation&quot; [of the Vedas]), a school which focuses on exegesis of the Vedas, philology and the interpretation of Vedic ritual.
* Vedānta (&quot;the end of the Vedas&quot;, also called &quot;Uttara Mīmāṃsā&quot;), focuses on interpreting the philosophy of the Upanishads, particularly the soteriological and metaphysical ideas relating to Atman and Brahman.

Sometimes these six are coupled into three groups for both historical and conceptual reasons: &quot;Nyāya&quot;-&quot;Vaiśeṣika&quot;, &quot;Sāṃkhya&quot;-&quot;Yoga&quot;, and &quot;Mīmāṃsā&quot;-&quot;Vedānta&quot;. Each tradition also included different currents and sub-schools. For example, Vedānta was divided among the sub-schools of Advaita (non-dualism), Visishtadvaita (qualified non-dualism), Dvaita (dualism), Dvaitadvaita (dualistic non-dualism), Suddhadvaita (pure non-dualism), and Achintya Bheda Abheda (inconceivable oneness and difference).

The doctrines of the Vedas and Upanishads were interpreted differently by these six schools, with varying degrees of overlap. They represent a &quot;collection of philosophical views that share a textual connection&quot;, according to . They also reflect a tolerance for a diversity of philosophical interpretations within Hinduism while sharing the same foundation. 

Hindu philosophers of the orthodox schools developed systems of epistemology (&quot;pramana&quot;) and investigated topics such as metaphysics, ethics, psychology (&quot;guṇa&quot;), hermeneutics, and soteriology within the framework of the Vedic knowledge, while presenting a diverse collection of interpretations. The commonly named six orthodox schools were the competing philosophical traditions of what has been called the &quot;Hindu synthesis&quot; of classical Hinduism.

All these systems are not the only &quot;orthodox&quot; systems of philosophy, as numerous sub-schools developed throughout the history of Hindu thought. They are however the most well known Hindu philosophical traditions. 

In addition to the six systems, the Hindu philosopher Vidyāraṇya (ca. 1374–1380) also includes several further Hindu philosophical systems in his &quot;Sarva-darśana-saṃgraha&quot; (A &quot;Compendium of all the Philosophical Systems&quot;):

* Paśupata, a school of Shaivism founded by Nakulisa
* Shaiva Siddhantha, a theistic and dualistic school of Shaivism, which is influenced by Samkhya, and expands the Samkhya system further.
* Pratyabhijña (the school of &quot;Recognition&quot;), which defends an idealistic monism and part of the Kashmir Shaivism tradition of Tantric Shaivism
* Pāṇini Darśana, a tradition focusing on Sanskrit linguistics and grammar which also developed the theory of &quot;sphoṭavāda&quot; under Bhartṛhari, a theory which places speech and sound at the center of its metaphysics.
* Raseśvara, an alchemical school which advocated the use of mercury as a way to attain enlightenment.

==Śramaṇic traditions==
Several non-Vedic traditions of thought also flourished in ancient India and they developed their own philosophical systems. The Śramaṇas included various traditions which did not accept the Brahmanical religion of the Vedas. These non-Vedic schools gave rise to a diverse range of ideas about topics like the atman, atomism, ethics, materialism, atheism, agnosticism, free will, asceticism, family life, ahimsa (non-violence) and vegetarianism. Notable philosophies that were a part of Śramaṇa family were Jainism, early Buddhism, Charvaka, Ajñana and Ājīvika. 

Indian Śramaṇa tradition had one of its earliest known prominent exemplar as Parshvanatha, the 23rd Tirthankar in 9th century BCE. It became prominent in the 5th and 4th centuries BCE, and even more so during the Mauryan period (c. 322–184 BCE). Jainism and Buddhism were especially influential. These traditions influenced all later forms of Indian philosophy who either adopted some of their ideas or reacted against them. 

===Jain philosophy===

Jain philosophy is the oldest Indian philosophy that separates body (matter) from the soul (consciousness) completely. Each individual soul is inherently endowed with infinite knowledge and boundless bliss. However, since infinity its true nature has remained veiled due to ignorance, causing it to mistakenly identify with the physical body. This misidentification leads to suffering and the accumulation of karma. As karma accumulates, the soul becomes bound to the cycle of birth and rebirth, perpetuating a continuous journey of suffering and ignorance, until it ultimately attains liberation through self-realization (&quot;atma-anubhuti&quot;). Jainism  lays down the path for the soul to realize its true nature by right faith and active awareness of the self &quot;(bhedvigyān)&quot; as an unchanging eternal &quot;gnāta&quot; (knower) and &quot;drashtā&quot; (witness) distinct from its ignorant activities like thoughts, passions, etc. 

Jainism experienced a resurgence after Mahavira, the 24th &quot;Tirthankara&quot;, revitalized and unified the ancient teachings of the Śramaṇic tradition, originally established by Rishabhadeva, the first Jain Tirthankara, millions of years prior. Historians outside of the Jain tradition date Mahavira to the 6th century BCE, roughly contemporaneous with the Buddha. This timeline would place the historical Parshvanatha approximately 250 years earlier, in the 9th century BCE. 

Jainism is a Śramaṇic religion and rejected the authority of the Vedas. However, like all Indian religions, it shares the core concepts such as karma, ethical living, rebirth, samsara and moksha. Jainism places strong emphasis on asceticism, ahimsa (non-violence) and anekantavada (relativity of viewpoints) as a means of spiritual liberation, ideas that influenced other Indian traditions.

Jainism strongly upholds the individualistic nature of soul and personal responsibility for one&#x27;s decisions; and that self-reliance and individual efforts alone are responsible for one&#x27;s liberation. According to the Jain philosophy, the world (&quot;Saṃsāra&quot;) is full of &quot;hiṃsā&quot; (violence). Therefore, one should direct all efforts towards the attainment of Ratnatraya, which are Samyak Darshan (right perception), Samyak Gnana (right knowledge) and Samyak Chàritra (right conduct), the key requisites to attain liberation.

===Buddhist philosophy===
Buddhist philosophy refers to several traditions which can be traced back to the teachings of Siddhartha Gautama, the Buddha (&quot;awakened one&quot;). Buddhism is a Śramaṇa religion, but it contains novel ideas not found or accepted by other Śramaṇa religions, such as the Buddhist doctrine of not-self (anatta). Buddhist thought is also influenced by the thought of the Upanishads. 

Buddhism and Hinduism mutually influenced each other and shared many concepts, however it is now difficult to identify and describe these influences. Buddhism rejected the Vedic concepts of Brahman (ultimate reality) and Atman (soul, self) at the foundation of Hindu philosophies. 

Buddhism shares many philosophical views with other Indian systems, such as belief in &quot;karma&quot; – a cause-and-effect relationship, samsara – ideas about cyclic afterlife and rebirth, dharma – ideas about ethics, duties and values, impermanence of all material things and of body, and possibility of spiritual liberation (nirvana or moksha). A major departure from Hindu and Jain philosophy is the Buddhist rejection of an eternal soul (&quot;atman&quot;) in favour of &quot;anatta&quot; (non-Self). After the death of the Buddha, several competing philosophical systems termed &quot;Abhidharma&quot; began to emerge as ways to systematize Buddhist philosophy.

==== Schools of thought ====
The main traditions of Buddhist philosophy in India (from 300 BCE to 1000 CE) can be divided into Mahayana schools and non-Mahayana schools (sometimes called Śrāvakayāna schools, Nikaya Buddhism, &quot;Mainstream&quot; Buddhism or Hinayana, &quot;inferior&quot; or &quot;lesser&quot; vehicle, a term used only in Mahayana to refer to non-Mahayana traditions). The Mahayana schools accepted the Mahayana sutras and studied the works of Mahayana philosophers like Nagarjuna. The non-Mahayana schools drew their philosophical doctrines from the Tripitaka and on the Abhidharma treatises. 

Śrāvakayāna schools (non-Mahayana):
* The Mahāsāṃghika (&quot;Great Community&quot;) tradition (which included numerous sub-schools, all are now extinct). A key doctrine of this tradition was the supramundane and transcendent nature of the Buddha (lokottaravada).
* The schools of the Sthavira (&quot;Elders&quot;) tradition:
** Vaibhāṣika (&quot;Commentators&quot;) also known as the Sarvāstivāda-Vaibhāśika, was an Abhidharma tradition that composed the &quot;Great Commentary&quot; (&quot;Mahāvibhāṣa).&quot; They were known for their defense of the doctrine of &quot;sarvāstitva&quot; (all exists), which is a form of eternalism regarding the philosophy of time. They also supported direct realism and a theory of substances (&quot;svabhāva&quot;).
** Sautrāntika (&quot;Those who uphold the sutras&quot;), a tradition which did not see the northern Abhidharma as authoritative, and instead focused on the Buddhist sutras. They disagreed with the Vaibhāṣika on several key points, including their eternalistic theory of time, their direct realism and their realist theory of nirvana.
** Pudgalavāda (&quot;Personalists&quot;), which were known for their controversial theory of the &quot;person&quot; (&quot;pudgala&quot;) which is what undergoes rebirth and attain awakening. They are now extinct.
**Vibhajyavāda (&quot;The Analysts&quot;), a widespread tradition which reached Kashmir, South India and Sri Lanka. A part of this school has survived into the modern era as the Southeast Asian Theravada tradition. Their orthodox positions can be found in the &quot;Kathavatthu.&quot; They rejected the views of the Pudgalavāda and of the Vaibhāṣika among others.

Mahāyāna traditions:

The Mahāyāna (&quot;Great Vehicle&quot;) movement (c. 1st century BCE onwards) included new ideas and scriptures (Mahayana sutras). These philosophical traditions differ significantly from other schools of Buddhism, and include metaphysical doctrines which are not accepted by the other Buddhist traditions. Mahayana thought focuses on the universal altruistic ideal of the bodhisattva, a being who is on the path to Buddhahood for the sake of all living beings. It also defends the doctrine that there are limitless number of Buddhas throughout limitless numbers of universes. These Indian traditions are the main source of modern Tibetan Buddhism and of modern East Asian Buddhism. 

The main Indian Mahayana schools of philosophy are:

* Madhyamaka (&quot;Middle way&quot; or &quot;Centrism&quot;) founded by Nagarjuna. Also known as &quot;Śūnyavāda&quot; (the emptiness doctrine) and &quot;Niḥsvabhāvavāda&quot; (the no &quot;svabhāva&quot; doctrine), this tradition focuses on the idea that all phenomena are empty of any essence or substance (&quot;svabhāva&quot;).
* Yogācāra (&quot;Yoga-praxis&quot;), an idealistic school which held that only consciousness exists, and thus was also known as &quot;Vijñānavāda&quot; (the doctrine of consciousness).
* The Dignāga-Dharmakīrti tradition is an influential school of thought which focused on epistemology, or &quot;pramāṇa&quot; (&#x27;means of knowledge&#x27;). They generally followed the doctrine of &quot;Vijñānavāda.&quot;
*Some scholars see the &quot;Tathāgatagarbha&quot; (&quot;Buddha womb/source&quot;) or &quot;buddha-nature&quot; texts as constituting a third &quot;school&quot; of Indian Mahāyāna thought.
*Vajrayāna (also known as Mantrayāna, Tantrayāna, Secret Mantra, and Tantric Buddhism) is often placed in a separate category due to its unique tantric theories and practices.

Many of these philosophies were brought to other regions, like Central Asia and China. After the disappearance of Buddhism from India, some of these philosophical traditions continued to develop in the Tibetan Buddhist, East Asian Buddhist and Theravada Buddhist traditions. 

===Ājīvika philosophy===

The philosophy of Ājīvika was founded by Makkhali Gosala, it was a Śramaṇa movement and a major rival of early Buddhism and Jainism. Ājīvikas were organised renunciates who formed discrete monastic communities prone to an ascetic and simple lifestyle.

Original scriptures of the Ājīvika school of philosophy may once have existed, but these are currently unavailable and probably lost. Their theories are extracted from mentions of Ajivikas in the secondary sources of ancient Indian literature, particularly those of Jainism and Buddhism which polemically criticized the Ajivikas. The Ājīvika school is known for its &quot;Niyati&quot; doctrine of absolute determinism (fate), the premise that there is no free will, that everything that has happened, is happening and will happen is entirely preordained and a function of cosmic principles. Ājīvika considered the karma doctrine as a fallacy. Ājīvikas were atheists and rejected the authority of the Vedas, but they believed that in every living being is an &quot;ātman&quot; – a central premise of Hinduism and Jainism.
===Ajñana philosophy===

Ajñana was one of the nāstika or &quot;heterodox&quot; schools of ancient Indian philosophy, and the ancient school of radical Indian skepticism. It was a Śramaṇa movement and a major rival of early Buddhism and Jainism. Their ideas are recorded in Buddhist and Jain texts. They held that it was impossible to obtain knowledge of metaphysical nature or ascertain the truth value of philosophical propositions; and even if knowledge was possible, it was useless and disadvantageous for final salvation. They were sophists who specialised in refutation without propagating any positive doctrine of their own.
===Charvaka philosophy===

Charvaka (; IAST: &quot;Cārvāka&quot;), also known as &quot;Lokāyata&quot;, is an ancient school of Indian materialism. Charvaka holds direct perception, empiricism, and conditional inference as proper sources of knowledge, embraces philosophical skepticism and rejects ritualism and supernaturalism. It was a popular belief system in ancient India.

The etymology of Charvaka (Sanskrit: चार्वाक) is uncertain. Bhattacharya quotes the grammarian Hemacandra, to the effect that the word cārvāka is derived from the root carv, &#x27;to chew&#x27; : &quot;A Cārvāka chews the self (carvatyātmānaṃ cārvākaḥ). Hemacandra refers to his own grammatical work, Uṇādisūtra 37, which runs as follows: mavāka-śyāmāka-vārtāka-jyontāka-gūvāka-bhadrākādayaḥ. Each of these words ends with the āka suffix and is formed irregularly&quot;. This may also allude to the philosophy&#x27;s hedonistic precepts of &quot;eat, drink, and be merry&quot;.

Brihaspati is traditionally referred to as the founder of Charvaka or Lokāyata philosophy, although some scholars dispute this. During the Hindu reformation period in the first millennium BCE, when Buddhism was established by Gautama Buddha and Jainism was re-organized by Parshvanatha, the Charvaka philosophy was well documented and opposed by both religions. Much of the primary literature of Charvaka, the Barhaspatya sutras, were lost either due to waning popularity or other unknown reasons. Its teachings have been compiled from historic secondary literature such as those found in the shastras, sutras, and the Indian epic poetry as well as in the dialogues of Gautama Buddha and from Jain literature. However, there is text that may belong to the Charvaka tradition, written by the skeptic philosopher Jayarāśi Bhaṭṭa, known as the Tattvôpaplava-siṁha, that provides information about this school, albeit unorthodox.

One of the widely studied principles of Charvaka philosophy was its rejection of inference as a means to establish valid, universal knowledge, and metaphysical truths. In other words, the Charvaka epistemology states that whenever one infers a truth from a set of observations or truths, one must acknowledge doubt; inferred knowledge is conditional.

==Comparison of Indian philosophies==
The Indian traditions subscribed to diverse philosophies, significantly disagreeing with each other as well as orthodox Indian philosophy and its six schools of Hindu philosophy. The differences ranged from a belief that every individual has a soul (self, atman) to asserting that there is no soul, from axiological merit in a frugal ascetic life to that of a hedonistic life, from a belief in rebirth to asserting that there is no rebirth.


==Political philosophy==
The Arthashastra, attributed to the Mauryan minister Chanakya, is one of the early Indian texts devoted to political philosophy. It is dated to 4th century BCE and discusses ideas of statecraft and economic policy. The Kural text, attributed to Valluvar and dated to around 5th century CE, deals with ahimsa and morality, extending them to political philosophy and love.

The political philosophy most closely associated with modern India is the one of ahimsa (non-violence) and Satyagraha, popularised by Mahatma Gandhi during the Indian struggle for independence. In turn it influenced the later independence and Civil Rights movements, especially those led by Martin Luther King Jr. and Nelson Mandela. Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar&#x27;s Progressive Utilization Theory is also a major socio-economic and political philosophy.

Integral humanism was a set of concepts drafted by Upadhyaya as political program and adopted in 1965 as the official doctrine of the Jan Sangh.

Upadhyaya considered that it was of utmost importance for India to develop an indigenous economic model with a human being at center stage. This approach made this concept different from Socialism and Capitalism. Integral Humanism was adopted as Jan Sangh&#x27;s political doctrine and its new openness to other opposition forces made it possible for the Hindu nationalist movement to have an alliance in the early 1970s with the prominent Gandhian Sarvodaya movement going on under the leadership of J. P. Narayan. This was considered to be the first major public breakthrough for the Hindu nationalist movement.

==Influence==
In appreciation of subtlety and truth of the Indian philosophy, T. S. Eliot wrote that the great philosophers of India &quot;make most of the great European philosophers look like schoolboys&quot;. Arthur Schopenhauer used Indian philosophy to improve upon Kantian thought. In the preface to his book &quot;The World As Will And Representation&quot;, Schopenhauer writes that one who &quot;has also received and assimilated the sacred primitive Indian wisdom, then he is the best of all prepared to hear what I have to say to him.&quot; The 19th-century American philosophical movement Transcendentalism was also influenced by Indian thought.

<text>Harmon Clayton Killebrew Jr. (; June 29, 1936May 17, 2011), nicknamed &quot;the Killer&quot; and &quot;Hammerin&#x27; Harmon&quot;, was an American professional baseball first baseman, third baseman, and left fielder. He spent most of his 22-year career in Major League Baseball (MLB) with the Minnesota Twins. A prolific power hitter, Killebrew had the fifth-most home runs in major league history at the time of his retirement. He was second only to Babe Ruth in American League (AL) home runs, and was the AL career leader in home runs by a right-handed batter. Killebrew was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1984.

Killebrew was tall and 213 pounds (97 kg). His compact swing generated tremendous power and made him one of the most feared power hitters of the 1960s, when he hit at least 40 home runs per season eight times. In total Killebrew led the league six times in home runs and three times in RBIs, and was named to 13 All-Star teams. In 1965, he played in the World Series with the Twins, who lost to the Los Angeles Dodgers. His finest season was 1969, when he hit 49 home runs, recorded 140 RBIs and won the AL Most Valuable Player Award while helping lead the Twins to the AL West pennant.

With quick hands and exceptional upper body strength, Killebrew was known for both the frequency and distance of his homers. He hit the longest home runs ever recorded at Minnesota&#x27;s Metropolitan Stadium [], and Baltimore&#x27;s Memorial Stadium [], and was the first of four players to hit a ball over the left field roof at Detroit&#x27;s Tiger Stadium. Despite his nicknames and his powerful style of play, Killebrew was a quiet, kind man.

After retiring from baseball, Killebrew became a television broadcaster for several baseball teams from 1976 to 1988. He also served as a hitting instructor for the Oakland Athletics.

==Early life==
Killebrew was born and raised in Payette, Idaho, the youngest of four children born to Harmon Clayton Sr. and Katherine Pearl (May) Killebrew. His father, a painter and sheriff, was a member of an undefeated Millikin College football team who was later named an All-American under eventual Pro Football Hall of Fame coach Greasy Neale. According to family legend, Harmon Killebrew&#x27;s grandfather was the strongest man in the Union Army, winning every available heavyweight wrestling championship. Clayton encouraged Harmon and his brothers to stay active in various sports before his sudden death in 1953 at age 59.

As a child, Killebrew played baseball at Walter Johnson Memorial Field, named after the Hall of Fame pitcher who spent part of his childhood in Idaho. He worked as a farmhand in his youth, lifting ten-gallon milk cans, each weighing about . Killebrew earned 12 letters in various sports and was named an All-American quarterback at Payette High School; the school retired his uniform number. He was offered an athletic scholarship by the University of Oregon, but declined the offer.

In the early 1950s, Senator Herman Welker of Idaho told Washington Senators owner Clark Griffith about Killebrew, who was hitting for an .847 batting average for a semi-professional baseball team at the time. Griffith told his farm director Ossie Bluege about the tip and Bluege flew to Idaho to watch Killebrew play. The Boston Red Sox also expressed interest but Bluege succeeded in signing him to a $50,000 ($ today) contract on June 19, 1954.

==Professional career==
===Washington Senators / Minnesota Twins (1954–1974)===
Killebrew signed his contract under the bonus rule in effect at the time. Since he received a bonus of over $4,000 ($ today), Major League Baseball rules required that he spend two full seasons on the major league roster. He made his major league debut four days after signing and six days from his 18th birthday (becoming the youngest active player in the majors at the time), running for pinch-hitter Clyde Vollmer, who had been hit by a pitch with the bases loaded by Chicago White Sox starter Jack Harshman. On August 23, 1954, Killebrew made his first start in the second game of a doubleheader against the Philadelphia Athletics, hitting two singles and a double as the Senators won, 10–3. A year and one day after making his major league debut, Killebrew hit his first major league home run on June 24, 1955, in the fifth inning off Detroit Tigers starter Billy Hoeft, five days shy of his 19th birthday. In his first two seasons, Killebrew struck out 34 times in only 93 at bats, recording a .215 batting average with four home runs. Killebrew also had defensive difficulties at third base, where he played behind veteran Eddie Yost.

When Killebrew&#x27;s bonus period expired in 1956, he was sent to the Senators&#x27; minor league affiliate in Charlotte of the South Atlantic League. He returned to the majors in early May. On May 29, after being forced into action when regular second baseman Pete Runnels was injured early in a game against the Orioles, Killebrew hit two home runs, including only the second ball ever hit over a wire barrier in Baltimore&#x27;s Memorial Stadium&#x27;s center field. Killebrew had a .115 average through June 16, and as a result was sent back to Charlotte; he finished the season there with a .325 batting average and 15 home runs in 70 games. Killebrew spent most of the 1957 season with the Southern Association&#x27;s Chattanooga Lookouts, where he hit a league-high 29 home runs with 101 RBIs and was named to the All-Star Game. While in Chattanooga, Killebrew became the only player to hit a home run over the center field wall at Engel Stadium, from home plate. In 1958, he was briefly promoted to Indianapolis of the American Association but struggled and was sent back to Chattanooga for most of the season. Killebrew finished the season with 38 games played in Indianapolis and 86 in Chattanooga, where he hit .308 with 17 home runs. He also played a combined 22 games for the Senators in 1957 and 1958.

Calvin Griffith took over the Senators after his uncle Clark Griffith died in 1955, and decided Killebrew was ready to become the Senators&#x27; regular third baseman. Griffith traded the 32-year-old Eddie Yost to the Detroit Tigers on December 6, 1958, and Killebrew became the starting third baseman. From May 1 to May 17, he had five multi-home run games and his first five-RBI game on May 12. With 28 home runs by mid-season, he started the first 1959 All-Star Game and was a reserve in the second. Killebrew attracted so much attention in Washington that he was visited by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who frequently attended games, and Griffith turned down a $500,000 offer for Killebrew from the Cincinnati Reds. Killebrew finished the season with 42 home runs to tie for the American League lead; it also tied the Senators&#x27; single-season record set by his teammate Roy Sievers two years earlier. Although 1959 proved his breakout season, he was ineligible for the Rookie of the Year Award because of his previous sparse experience. Instead, the award went to teammate Bob Allison.

Killebrew was bothered by injury early in the 1960 season. In March, he had surgery for nasal irritation, and a recurring hamstring injury caused him to miss most of May. On his return, he remained in the lineup for the rest of the season, finishing the year with 31 home runs in 124 games. Killebrew&#x27;s arrival and home runs did little to improve the Senators&#x27; record, as they finished in the second division of the American League every year he played for Washington, including four years in last place. After the 1960 season, the Senators moved to Minnesota and became the Minnesota Twins.

====1961–1965====
For the franchise&#x27;s first year in Minnesota, Killebrew was named team captain by manager Cookie Lavagetto. He responded by hitting 46 home runs, breaking the franchise record he had tied two years earlier. Among his other production, Killebrew drove in a team-leading 122 RBIs, posted a career-best batting average of .288 and had a slugging percentage of over .600 for the only time in his career. In addition, he had a career-high seven triples, tying for the team lead, and led the Twins in runs, total bases and walks. On June 12, 1961, Killebrew had the only five-hit game of his career, though in a losing effort. Killebrew was named to both 1961 All-Star games. He did not play in the second, but in the first, he hit a pinch hit home run in the sixth inning. After the season ended, Killebrew took part in a home run hitting contest with Jim Gentile and Roger Maris, whose 61 home runs that year broke the single-season record; Killebrew hit 20 to win the contest.

After his seven-triple season, his speed began to decrease and he could no longer regularly score triples due to pulling his quadriceps during the 1962 season. Killebrew moved to left field, where he started off the season slowly. He hit under .200 in both April and June, and because of this Killebrew was not selected to play in either 1962 All-Star Game, the last season he was not named an All-Star before 1972. On July 18 in a game against the Cleveland Indians, Killebrew and Bob Allison became the first teammates since 1890 to hit grand slams in the same inning as the Twins scored 11 runs in the first. Over the course of the season, Killebrew hit 48 home runs, 126 RBIs, and had 107 walks, all career highs at the time. No one else in the AL managed even 40 home runs and he also led the league in RBIs. Killebrew&#x27;s 48 home runs also broke the franchise record for the second year in a row. Not all his stats were positive; Killebrew&#x27;s batting average dropped from .288 in 1961 to .243 and he struck out a career-worst 142 times, leading the AL.

Killebrew&#x27;s efforts were rewarded in 1963 when he agreed to a contract for about $40,000 ($ today). He started the season off slowly, and he missed the second half of April and early May due to a right knee injury that was slow to heal. Killebrew continued his hitting prowess for the Twins upon his return, and at one point led them on a six-game winning streak. On September 21, Killebrew hit three home runs in a game for the only time in his career in the first game of a doubleheader against the Boston Red Sox. Killebrew finished the season with a .258 batting average, 45 home runs, and 96 RBI, and led the league in home runs and slugging percentage (.555). He had surgery on his troublesome right knee after the season ended.

Having played left field for the previous three years with a below-average throwing arm, the additional complication of Killebrew&#x27;s knee surgery necessitated a move to the infield. For the remainder of his career, he played only 19 games in the outfield. He finished the 1964 season with a .270 batting average, 49 home runs, and 111 RBI; he led the AL in home runs for the third consecutive year.

The Twins finally won the American League pennant during the 1965 season. On July 11, the day before the All-Star break, the defending AL champion Yankees had a one-run lead over the Twins going into the bottom of the 9th inning, but Killebrew hit a two-run home run for the win. Two days later, Killebrew started the All-Star Game at his home field, Metropolitan Stadium, and hit a game-tying two-run home run, erasing what had been a 5–0 National League lead. Elected to play first base on his fifth All-Star team, Killebrew became the first player in All-Star game history to be elected at three different positions, having previously been selected to play third base (1959 and 1961) and left field (1963 and 1964).
Killebrew drove in the tying or winning run seven times in 1965 before suffering an injury on August 2. During a game against the Orioles, Twins third baseman Rich Rollins made a poor throw to first and while trying to save the play, Killebrew collided with the runner and dislocated his elbow, putting him out of action until mid-September. Despite his absence, the Twins had a win–loss record of 28–19 and even extended their first place lead. Killebrew ended the regular season with 25 home runs and 75 RBI, his lowest numbers in a full season due to the injury. In the 1965 World Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers, Killebrew and Zoilo Versalles led the Twins with .286 batting averages, and Killebrew hit a home run off Don Drysdale in Game 4. Minnesota was shut out in three games and the Dodgers won the series in seven.

====1966–1969====
At the start of the 1966 season, Killebrew hit few home runs; halfway through May, he had hit only two, his lowest total at that point of a season since 1960, when he had missed the first two months of the season. He later increased his tally to 39 and finished the season with a .281 batting average and 110 RBIs. He led the AL with 103 walks and finished 4th in Most Valuable Player Award (MVP) voting after Frank Robinson, Brooks Robinson, and Boog Powell of the American League leading Baltimore Orioles.

During the 1967 season Killebrew hit the then longest home run recorded at Metropolitan Stadium, a June 3 shot off Lew Burdette in the 4th inning that landed in the second deck of the bleachers. The Twins, led by Killebrew, were in the pennant race throughout the season, and had a one-game lead as the final two games of the season began against the Boston Red Sox. Having to win only once to clinch the pennant, Killebrew hit a home run in the first game and recorded two hits in each game, but Boston won twice and Minnesota finished in a second place tie with the Detroit Tigers. Killebrew finished the season with a .269 batting average and 113 RBIs, tied AL Triple Crown winner Carl Yastrzemski with 44 home runs, and led the league with 131 walks. He also finished a distant second in MVP voting to the Boston star.

In April 1968 Killebrew served as a prosecution witness in a case where his name was being used to fraudulently sell stocks in Idaho. The baseball season proved unsuccessful for Killebrew, whose batting average barely passed .200 most of the year; after a strong start, he hit below .200 in both May and June and his average stood at .204 with 13 home runs going into the all-star break. Even so, he was selected as the starting first baseman in the All-Star Game and Killebrew said that, owing to his poor start, he was &quot;surprised&quot; and &quot;embarrassed&quot; by the selection. During the third inning of the game he stretched for a ball thrown by shortstop Jim Fregosi, his foot slipped, and he did the splits, rupturing his left medial hamstring. He was carried from the field by a stretcher. At the time, the injury was considered career-threatening, but after missing about six weeks, he returned to limited action in September.

After enduring seven months of rehabilitation for his injury, Killebrew remained in pain but rebounded to have his best season in 1969. On July 5, Killebrew set a career-high with six RBIs in a game against the Oakland Athletics. On September 7 he topped that mark with a three-run homer and a grand slam in the first two innings, leading the team to another defeat of the Athletics . Killebrew led the best offense in the league and rookie manager Billy Martin&#x27;s Twins won the new American League West division as a result.

For the season, Killebrew set career highs in RBIs, runs, walks and on-base percentage, tied his career high with 49 home runs, and even registered eight of his 19 career stolen bases, en route to winning his only Most Valuable Player Award. Playing in all 162 games, he led the majors in home runs and RBI (140), while leading the AL in on-base percentage (.427), walks (145) and intentional walks (20). As of 2021, Killebrew&#x27;s home run, RBI, and walk totals from 1969 remain team records, and his 145 walks are tied for the 20th highest single season total in MLB history and 7th highest for a right-handed batter. In the 1969 American League Championship Series, the Baltimore Orioles used their pitching staff, the best in the league, to defeat Minnesota and win the series three games to none. Baltimore avoided Killebrew by walking him six times in the three games to avoid pitching to him, which was as many times as they walked the rest of the Twins team.

====1970–1974====
After his MVP season, Killebrew signed a new contract with the Twins worth $90,000 ($ today). He was set to lead a team that had undergone a lot of change; Killebrew was one of only four Twins remaining from the 1965 pennant-winning club. He spent most of the season&#x27;s first half continuing his success, and found Baltimore&#x27;s Brooks Robinson rivalling him for the third base spot during the All-Star voting process; the two were neck-and-neck throughout. He continued his success through the second half of the year, and at season&#x27;s end had hit 41 home runs with 113 RBIs and finished third in MVP voting behind teammate and runner-up Tony Oliva and Baltimore&#x27;s Boog Powell. In a rematch of the previous season the Twins again faced Powell and the Orioles in the 1970 American League Championship Series. Killebrew upped his performance and hit two home runs in three games, but Minnesota was again swept.

Killebrew reached 40 home runs in a season for the final time in 1970 and also made his last appearance in the postseason. His contract continued to grow in value though, and before the 1971 season began he was awarded the first $100,000 ($ today) contract in Twins history. Killebrew appeared in his last All-Star Game in 1971, hitting a two-run home run off Ferguson Jenkins to provide the margin of victory for the AL. He finished the season with a .254 batting average, 114 walks, 119 RBI, the latter two of which led the league, and 28 home runs. Killebrew hit his 498th home run on June 22, 1971, but a sprained right toe made his run to milestone number 500 a slow one. He hit number 499 more than a month later and finally hit number 500 off a Mike Cuellar slow curveball in the first inning of an August 10 home game; at the time, he was the 10th player in history to hit 500 home runs. He then wasted no time in hitting number 501, knocking a Cuellar fastball over the fences later in the same game.

In 1972, Killebrew showed signs of slowing down. He missed his first All-Star Game since 1962, but instead of expressing disappointment in his streak ending, he noted that Twins shortstop Danny Thompson should have had the opportunity to play instead; Thompson mentioned the same thing about Killebrew. Despite not making the team, Killebrew&#x27;s home run total continued to climb, and by the end of July he had Jimmie Foxx and Mickey Mantle&#x27;s career marks in his sights; he went on to pass both in August. Killebrew finished the season with a .231 batting average, 26 home runs, and 74 RBIs. There were questions about Killebrew&#x27;s health as the 1973 season began, as he had surgery twice during the offseason to fix leg problems. He played through the first half of the season, but an injury to his left knee on June 25 sidelined him. A month later, the injury had not cleared up, and he underwent surgery to remove some torn cartilage; he did not return to the lineup until mid-September. Killebrew played in only 69 games that season, hitting five home runs.

Fully recovered for the 1974 season, Killebrew made his mark early on, hitting two home runs in a May 5 match against the Detroit Tigers; the second was career home run number 550. In his honor, the Twins held Harmon Killebrew Day in August, when it was announced that they would retire his number; Killebrew responded by leading the Twins to a 5–4 victory over the Orioles. He finished the season with a .222 batting average, 13 home runs, and 54 RBIs. In December 1974, he was given the option of staying with the Twins as a coach and batting instructor, managing the AAA Tacoma Twins, or being released. He chose to be released, ending his 21-season tenure with the Twins.

===Kansas City Royals (1975)===
On January 24, 1975, eight days after getting his release from the Twins, Killebrew signed a one-year contract with the Kansas City Royals. During his return to Minnesota in early May, the Twins formally retired his No. 3 jersey. In that game, Killebrew hit a home run against his former teammates and received a standing ovation from the crowd. In 106 games with the Royals, he had a batting average of .199, 14 home runs, and 44 RBIs. At the end of the season, the Royals released Killebrew. In March 1976, he formally announced his retirement and said he would become an announcer and color commentator for Twins games. At the time of his retirement, he was fifth all-time on the home run list.

==Career overall==
===Statistics and achievements===
Killebrew hit 573 home runs (12th all time), drove in 1,584 RBIs and had 1,559 (15th all time) bases on balls during his career. He is also the all-time home run record holder among players born in Idaho; Vance Law is second. He also finished with the record of having the most plate appearances (9,831) in his career without a sacrifice hit (since broken by Frank Thomas with 10,074 plate appearances).

===Power hitting===
Killebrew was known for his quick hands and exceptional upper-body strength, demonstrated by frequent &quot;tape measure&quot; home runs he hit in the prime of his career. Killebrew said his first home run in the Majors was his favorite, coming off Billy Hoeft at Griffith Stadium. He said of it, &quot;Frank House was the catcher. When I came to the plate, he said, &#x27;Kid, we&#x27;re going to throw you a fastball.&#x27; I didn&#x27;t know whether to believe him or not. I hit it out. It was one of the longest home runs I ever hit. As I crossed the plate, House said, &#x27;That&#x27;s the last time I ever tell you what pitch is coming.&#x27;&quot;

On August 3, 1962, he became the first hitter ever to hit a baseball over the left field roof at Tiger Stadium, a seldom-reached target as contrasted with the old ballpark&#x27;s smaller right field area. Only three others accomplished this feat during the next 37 seasons before the stadium closed. On May 24, 1964, Harmon hit the longest measured homer at Baltimore&#x27;s Memorial Stadium, to deep left center. The ball landed in the far reaches of the bleachers. The only player to hit one completely out of the Orioles&#x27; stadium was Frank Robinson in 1966; his blast was reported as about , or about less than Killebrew&#x27;s. On June 3, 1967, Killebrew hit a home run, the longest measured home run ever hit at Metropolitan Stadium and, as of 2022, the longest in Twins history. That event is commemorated at the Mall of America in Bloomington, which includes a plaque marking home plate, and one red-painted seat from the Met which was placed at the location and elevation of the landing spot of the home run. Target Field had a statue of a Gold Glove outside Gate 34 that was exactly from Target Field&#x27;s home plate. It was moved to another location after the Twins created the Gate 34 experience.

==Honors and legacy==
Killebrew was first eligible for the Hall of Fame in and received 239 votes, or 59.6% of the vote; 75% of the vote is required for induction. While he did hit 573 home runs (5th all-time when he left the game), he amassed a relatively low hit total (2086), given the years he played, combined with a high number of strikeouts (1699), and a
.256 batting average.

In , Killebrew received 59.3% of the vote, taking a backseat to Hank Aaron and Frank Robinson, who made it in their first year of eligibility. After receiving 71.9% of the vote in , Killebrew said not getting in that year was more difficult to accept than the previous two times, and asked &quot;Why do the writers feel there only has to be a certain number inducted each time?&quot; In , Killebrew received 83.1% of the vote and was elected to the Hall in his fourth year of eligibility, joining Luis Aparicio and Don Drysdale as electees.

In 2022, &quot;The Sporting News&quot; named Killebrew on their &quot;Minneapolis Mount Rushmore of Sports&quot;, along with fellow Twin Kirby Puckett, Minnesota Timberwolves basketball player Kevin Garnett, and Minnesota Vikings football player Fran Tarkenton.

The street along the south side of the Mall of America, the former site of Metropolitan Stadium, in Bloomington, Minnesota, is named &quot;Killebrew Drive&quot; in his honor. Banners that hung above the Metrodome&#x27;s outfield upper deck, resembling baseball cards, showed the retired numbers: Killebrew (3), Rod Carew (29), Tony Oliva (6), Kent Hrbek (14) and Kirby Puckett (34). In 1999, he was ranked 69th on &quot;The Sporting News&quot; list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players and nominated as a finalist for Major League Baseball&#x27;s All-Century Team. When the Twins moved to Target Field in 2010, Gate 3 on the southeast (center field) side of the stadium was named in his honor. There are also corresponding gates for the team&#x27;s other retired numbers.

Despite rumors that Killebrew is the player depicted in the Major League Baseball logo, according to the creator, Jerry Dior, it was not patterned after any specific player. Killebrew is the model for the logo of the Major League Baseball Players Alumni Association, an organization he helped found in 1982.

Killebrew was known as an all-around gentleman during his playing career. &quot;He&#x27;s one of the greatest of all time.&quot; He was even noted as being kind to the umpires, as noted by Ron Luciano in his autobiography, &quot;The Umpire Strikes Back&quot;:

==Post-playing career==
Following his retirement, Killebrew was a television broadcaster for the Twins at WTCN TV from 1976 to 1978, the Oakland Athletics from 1979 to 1982, the California Angels in 1983 and back with Minnesota from 1984 to 1988. While with Oakland, he also served as a major- and minor-league hitting instructor.

Killebrew was involved in a Boise, Idaho insurance and securities business. He moved to Scottsdale, Arizona, in 1990, where he chaired the Harmon Killebrew Foundation, which he created in 1998. Killebrew founded the Danny Thompson Memorial Golf Tournament, now titled the Killebrew-Thompson Memorial in 1977 with former Idaho congressman Ralph Harding, which is played annually in mid August in Sun Valley, Idaho, and has donated more than $23 million to leukemia and cancer research. Thompson was a Twins teammate who continued his major league career while suffering from leukemia; he died in December 1976 at the age of 29.

==Personal life==
Despite his nicknames and style of play, Killebrew was considered by his colleagues to be a quiet, kind man. While still an active major leaguer, Killebrew became a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and never smoked or drank. He was once asked in an interview what hobbies he had, to which he replied, &quot;Just washing the dishes, I guess.&quot;

In the late 1980s, Killebrew had financial problems. In July 1988, his house went into foreclosure and, in 1989, the &quot;Minneapolis Star Tribune&quot; reported that he had fallen $700,000 into debt. He also divorced his first wife of more than 30 years, Elaine Killebrew &quot;née&quot; Roberts, whom he had married in 1955. Soon after, Killebrew&#x27;s health failed. In May 1990, he was rushed to the hospital with a collapsed lung and damaged esophagus. Together with a subsequent abscess and staph infection, Killebrew endured three surgeries and nearly died. He used a wheelchair for some time post-surgery. By December 1990, his health had improved and he married Nita Patten.

On December 29, 2010, Killebrew announced that he had been diagnosed with esophageal cancer and started treatment. On May 13, 2011, a Minnesota Twins press release reported he was ceasing treatment and entering hospice care, because his illness had progressed beyond his doctors&#x27; expectation of cure. To honor Killebrew, the Twins wore their 1961 throwback alternate jerseys at home for the remainder of the 2011 season; he was also honored by the Washington Nationals, who hung a jersey with Killebrew&#x27;s name and number 3 in their home dugout. Killebrew died on May 17, 2011, at his home in Scottsdale at the age of 74. He was interred at Riverside Cemetery in Payette, Idaho.

Following his death, Minnesota Twins president Dave St. Peter released the following statement:

<text>Rosalind Mallia Franklin (March 1, 1952 – February 5, 2010), also known as The Queen Of Funk, was a vocalist of the American funk band Parliament-Funkadelic. She introduced friends George Clinton and Bootsy Collins in 1971, and brought ex-Ohio Player Junie Morrison to the band in 1978.

She sang background on early Parliament and Funkadelic albums, and became an original member of Parlet, P-Funk&#x27;s sub-group, where she recorded &quot;Pleasure Principle&quot; in 1978 and half of &quot;Invasion Of The Booty Snatchers&quot; in 1979. She left the group to form a proposed P-Funk offshoot, Sterling Silver Starship with bassist Donnie Sterling.

She appeared with Clinton in Prince&#x27;s 1990 film &quot;Graffiti Bridge&quot;. Her first solo album &quot;Funken Tersepter&quot; was released in Japan in 1995 on P-Vine. She wrote, with Snoop Dogg, on the 2002 release &quot;Suited and Booted&quot;, and earlier appeared on his 1993 studio album, Doggystyle.

Franklin was married to drummer Nathaniel Neblett of the band New Birth. They had one child, Seth Neblett.

<text>Jeanette McGruder (born November 8, 1954) is a singer, comedian, sketch actress, and writer, who has performed with P-Funk, Brides Of Funkenstein, and Lynn Mabry and Dawn Silva. In 1979, she recorded with Silva and Sheila Horne on &quot;Never Buy Texas From A Cowboy&quot;. McGruder changed her professional name to Satori Shakoor in mid-1980s and became a comedian and sketch actress on the Canadian show &quot;Thick and Thin&quot;.

==Early life and career==
McGruder was born in Detroit, Michigan, in 1954, and began singing and studying the violin as a child. Taught by her stepmother, she sang in her junior high choir and joined a female trio called New Dawn, which performed at nightclubs and one Black Panthers rally. She became a professional violinist aged 15 as well as playing in her high school orchestra at Cass Technical High School. While still at school, Jeanette also played in various orchestras and bands in and around the city of Detroit, including The Electrifying Strings, a jazz string group with Earl Klugh (guitar), Cecil &quot;Van&quot; Cephus (keyboards), and Ralph Armstrong (bass). She played in studio sessions on recordings for local Detroit artists, and earned money for occasional performances at United Sound Studios for Motown Records. 

==Education and later musical career==

In 1972, upon entering the music department of Michigan State University (MSU), McGruder opted against pursuing a career as a violinist, and instead majored in voice. In 1974, she performed &quot;We Shall Overcome&quot; at an event honoring Coretta Scott King.

In 1978, after four years of studying at MSU and two years of singing in local bands, McGruder moved to New York City and began auditioning for Broadway. Later that year, her friend Overton Loyd told her about an audition for the Brides of Funkenstein, a new group created by George Clinton. McGruder returned to Detroit and got a job as a backing singer for Parliament-Funkadelic, and the original Brides of Funkenstein, Dawn Silva and Lynn Mabry, whose album &quot;Funk the Walk&quot; (1978) was in the charts. Mabry left the group within a year, leaving Dawn Silva to record a second album alone. George Clinton brought McGruder and Sheila Horne into the foreground, and the Brides of Funkenstein became a three-piece group, recording their second album, &quot;Never Buy Texas From A Cowboy&quot; (1979), which was voted into &quot;Billboard&quot;″s &quot;Top 50 albums&quot; of all time in 2002. One single from the album, &quot;Didn&#x27;t Mean To Fall in Love&quot;, won a rhythm and blues award in 1981 for &quot;Best New Female Group&quot;.

The Brides of Funkenstein disbanded in 1981. McGruder became the lyricist and lead singer for a Detroit rock band called Cherubim, which recorded one album and played in Japan.

A dramatic and humorous monologue featuring McGruder, now known as Satori Shakoor, was released on &quot;The Moth&quot; on January 21, 2013.

At the 13th Gemini Awards in 1998, she and her &quot;Thick and Thin&quot; castmates Ronnie Edwards, Kedar Brown and Kenny Robinson received an ensemble nomination for Best Performance in a Comedy Program or Series.

==Television Career==
Shakoor is the host of Detroit Performs: Live From Marygrove, which airs on Detroit Public Television.

==Personal life==
In 1982, McGruder had a son, Noah Shakoor. In 2002, Noah and his wife, Fonda Hollowell, had a daughter.

<text>Brigitte Helm (born Brigitte Gisela Eva Schittenhelm, 17 March 1908 – 11 June 1996) was a German actress, best remembered for her dual role as Maria and her double named Futura, in Fritz Lang&#x27;s 1927 silent film, &quot;Metropolis&quot;.

==Early life==
Brigitte Gisela Eva Schittenhelm was born on 17 March 1908 in Berlin, the daughter of Gretchen Gertrud Martha Schittenhelm (née Tews; 1877—1955) and merchant Edwin Alexander Johannes Schittenhelm (1871—1913).

Helm took an interest in acting as a child, and by age 12 was taking the lead in school plays.

==Career==
Helm&#x27;s first movie role was that of Maria in &quot;Metropolis&quot;, which she began work on while only 17 years old. She signed a ten-year contract with UFA in 1925. After &quot;Metropolis&quot;, Helm made over 30 other films, including talking pictures, before retiring in 1935. Her other appearances include &quot;The Love of Jeanne Ney&quot; (1927), &quot;Alraune&quot; (1928), &quot;L&#x27;Argent&quot; (1928), &quot;Gloria&quot; (1931), &quot;The Blue Danube&quot; (1932), &quot;L&#x27;Atlantide&quot; (1932), and &quot;Gold&quot; (1934). Helm was considered for the title role in &quot;Bride of Frankenstein&quot; before Elsa Lanchester was given the role.

==Personal life==
Helm was involved in several traffic accidents, and was briefly imprisoned. According to the Nazi Party&#x27;s Press Chief Obergruppenführer Otto Dietrich&#x27;s book, &quot;The Hitler I Knew&quot;, Adolf Hitler saw that manslaughter charges against her from an automobile accident were dropped.

Helm married her second husband, Dr. Hugo Kunheim, an industrialist, after her film contract expired in 1935. Helm stated that she retired from films because she was &quot;...disgusted with the Nazi takeover of the film industry...&quot; In 1935, she moved to Switzerland, where she had four children with Kunheim. In her later years, she refused to grant any interviews concerning her film career.

Helm died, 11 June 1996, in Ascona, Switzerland.

<doc id="310192" wikidata="Q19000" url="?curid=310192" title="Flag of Texas">
<text>The Lone Star Flag is the official flag of the U.S. state of Texas. The flag, flown at homes and businesses statewide, is highly popular among Texans and is treated with a great degree of reverence and esteem within Texas. Along with the flag of Hawaii, it is one of two state flags to have previously served as a national flag of an independent country. In 2001, the North American Vexillological Association surveyed its members on the designs of the 72 U.S. state, territorial, and Canadian provincial flags and ranked the Texas flag second, behind New Mexico.

==Flag design==
The state flag is officially described by law as:

==History and adoption==

Legislation authorizing the flag was introduced in the Congress of the Republic of Texas on December 28, 1838, by Senator William H. Wharton. The flag was adopted on January 25, 1839, as the national flag of the Republic of Texas. &quot;Accompanying the original Act ... is a drawing by Peter Krag of the national flag and seal ... although in the original President Lamar&#x27;s approval and signature are at the top and upside down[.]&quot; When Texas became the 28th U.S. state on December 29, 1845, the national flag became the state flag. From 1879 until 1933, there was no official state flag, although the Lone Star Flag remained the &quot;de facto&quot; state flag; in adopting the Revised Civil Statutes of 1879, the Legislature repealed all statutes not expressly continued in force; since the statutes pertaining to the flag were not among those renewed, Texas was formally flagless until the passage of the 1933 flag law.

The actual designer of the flag is unknown. Some claim that Charles B. Stewart of Montgomery, Texas, is either the designer of the flag or drew the image used by the Third Congress when enacting the legislation adopting the flag. However, Stewart&#x27;s drawing &quot;looks suspiciously like a tracing of the Peter Krag art, including the upside down signature of President Lamar&quot;.  

==Colors and symbolism==
The exact shades of red, white, and blue to be used in the flag are specified by Texas statute which are:

The Texas Flag Code assigns the following symbolism to the colors of the Texas flag: blue stands for loyalty, white for purity, and red for bravery. The code also states that the single (&quot;lone&quot;) star &quot;represents ALL of Texas and stands for our unity as one for God, State, and Country&quot;.

The idea of the single red stripe and single white stripe actually dates back to the short-lived Republic of Fredonia, a small state near modern Nacogdoches which seceded from Mexico in 1826 before being forcibly re-integrated. The new state was formed through an alliance between local Anglo settlers and Native American tribes and the Fredonian flag used a white and red stripe to symbolize the two ethnic/racial groups from which the state was formed. Though this rebellion ultimately failed it served as an inspiration to the later Texas Revolution.

The idea of the &quot;lone star&quot; is, in fact, an older symbol predating the flag which was used to symbolize Texans&#x27; solidarity in declaring independence from Mexico. A similar lone star was on the &quot;Burnet Flag&quot;, which resembled the flag of the short-lived Republic of West Florida. The &quot;Lone Star&quot; is still seen today as a symbol of Texas&#x27; independent spirit, and gave rise to the state&#x27;s official nickname &quot;The Lone Star State&quot;.

==Pledge of allegiance and flag protocol==
The pledge of allegiance to the state flag is as follows:

The pledge was instituted by the Texas Legislature in 1933. The pledge originally referred to the &quot;Texas flag of 1836&quot; (which was the Burnet Flag, and not the Lone Star Flag then in use). In 1965, the error was corrected by deleting the words &quot;of 1836&quot; because the current flag was not officially adopted by the Texas government until 1839. In 2007, the phrase &quot;one state under God&quot; was added. The addition of &quot;under God&quot; has been challenged in court, though an injunction was denied.
As of 2001 (amended 2017), the pledge is recited standing at attention with one&#x27;s right hand over one&#x27;s heart. A person in uniform instead renders a military salute. The Texas Pledge is always recited after reciting the Pledge of Allegiance to the American flag every morning in the majority of schools across the state.

The flag is required by law to be displayed on or near the main administration building of each state institution during each state or national holiday, and on any special occasion of historical significance, permanently above both doors of the Texas State Capitol, alone at the north door, and under the U.S. flag at the south door, with the exception being if the flags are at half mast or if the POW/MIA flag is being flown with the U.S. flag; in which event the Texas flag shall only fly at the North Door. State law also requires that the state flag be flown at or near any International Port of Entry. When displayed vertically, the blue stripe should be at top and, from the perspective of an observer, the white stripe should be to the left of the red stripe.

==Historical flags of Texas==

===National flags over Texas===


===Pre-Revolutionary flags===
===Revolutionary flags===

During revolutionary eras of Texas history, during the Spanish Texas period, Mexican Texas period, and the times of the Texas Revolution, a great number and variety of flags appeared.

The Lone Star and Stripes/Ensign of the First Texas Navy/War Ensign flag was widely used by both Texan land and naval forces. This flag was simply the United States flag with a Lone star in the canton. This flag echoes an earlier design, carried by the forces of James Long in failed 1819 and 1821 attempts to separate Texas from Spanish control. This earlier flag was exactly the same, save for the canton having a red background rather than blue. There is evidence that the Lone Star and Stripes was used at the battles of Goliad, the Alamo, and San Jacinto, and the first Congress of the Republic of Texas as convened under it in 1836. Although interim President David Burnet issued a decree making the Lone Star and Stripes the first official flag of the Republic of Texas, it never became the legal national flag. It did remain the naval flag of Texas until annexation, and was noted for being &quot;beneficial to our [Texan] Navy and Merchantmen&quot; due to its resemblance to the U.S. flag. Despite its unofficial status, the flag remained well known inside the region and internationally as the symbol of Texas. The official blue and gold &quot;Burnet Flag&quot;, on the other hand, was little known by Texans, and no contemporary illustrations of it have been discovered except for on the first series 2 dollar note of the Texas Dollar. An 1837 chart of national flags printed in Philadelphia showed the Lone Star and Stripes as the national flag of Texas, and Texas Senator Oliver Jones, who led the 1839 committee which approved the Lone Star Flag, was unaware that the Lone Star and Stripes was not the current official flag. Later, prior to the American Civil War, this flag was carried by Floridian militiamen in Pensacola during the seizure of U.S. property in that city.

The &quot;Come and Take It Flag&quot; was created by the people of Gonzales, featuring the phrase, a black five pointed star, and the image of the town cannon Mexican forces had demanded they turn over. In March 1831, Juan Gomez, a lieutenant in the Mexican Army, granted a small cannon to the colony of San Antonio. It was then transported to Gonzales, Texas and later was the object of Texas pride. At the minor skirmish known as the Battle of Gonzales, a small group of Texans successfully resisted the Mexican forces who had orders to seize their cannon. As a symbol of defiance, the Texans had fashioned a flag containing the phrase along with a black star and an image of the cannon which they had received six years earlier from Mexican officials.

The so-called &quot;Alamo Flag&quot; or &quot;1824 flag&quot; was created by replacing the Eagle in the center of the Mexican tricolor with the year &quot;1824&quot;, referencing the 1824 Constitution of Mexico, in support of which Texas was fighting. This was the first flag approved for use by rebel forces by a Texan legislative body. In 1835, the Texan provisional government approved the use of this flag for privateers preying on Mexican commerce. It has often been said that the 1824 flag was flown by Texan forces at the Battle of the Alamo. However, this was never alleged until 1860, long after the battle had occurred. Modern writers have pointed out that the presence of the 1824 flag at the time and place of the battle is highly unlikely. A similar flag was flown at least briefly by Texan Tejano forces, featuring two black, six pointed stars in place of the date. It is likely that the actual &quot;Alamo flag&quot; referred to by accounts of the time was the Lone Star and Stripes, which had been depicted in use at earlier battles such as Goliad, and was widely referred to as the &quot;Texian flag&quot;.

The Dodson Tricolor or Dodson flag was designed and sewn by a Mrs. Sarah Dodson during the Revolution. It resembled the flag of Revolutionary France, but with longer proportions and the Texan Lone Star in the canton. Stephen F. Austin was initially so alarmed by the obvious symbolism that he requested the flag not be used, but it nevertheless flew over Texan forces in Cibolo Creek, and may have been the first Texan flag raised over San Antonio. The flag was one of two that flew over the small cabin in which Texas delegates ratified their declaration of independence.

===Republic of Texas flags===

The Burnet Flag was adopted by the Texan Congress on December 10, 1836. The name refers David G. Burnet, who was provisional president of the Republic of Texas when the flag was adopted. It consisted of an azure background with a large golden star, inspired by the 1810 &quot;Bonnie Blue Flag&quot; of the Republic of West Florida. Variants of the Burnet Flag with a white star, virtually identical to the Bonnie Blue Flag, were also common. Other variants featured the star (of either color) upside down, and/or ringed with the word TEXAS, with each letter filling one of the gaps of the star.

===State flags over Texas===

===Secession flags of Texas, 1861===

In early 1861, between the secession of Texas from the U.S. and its accession to the Confederacy, Texas flew an unofficial, variant flag of Texas with fifteen stars, representing the fifteen slave states. No drawings exist of the flag; there are only imprecise descriptions. The flag may have been based on the state flag or the Bonnie Blue Flag.

=== Civil War flags ===
Various flags used by Texan soldiers during the American Civil War.

=== Commemorative flags of Texas ===
A centennial flag was created for the Texas Centennial Exposition of 1936, a world fair located in Dallas to mark the 100th anniversary of Texas independence.

To mark the Texas Sesquicentennial (150th anniversary) of Texas&#x27;s independence in 1986, a flag was created bearing the Texas Sesquicentennial logo.

==Urban legend==

It is an urban legend that the Texas flag is the only state flag that is allowed to fly at the same height as the U.S. flag. However, the legend is false. Neither the Joint Resolution for Annexing Texas to the United States nor the Ordinance of Annexation contains any provisions regarding flags. According to the United States Flag Code, any state flag can be flown at the same height as the U.S. flag, but the U.S. flag should be on its right (the viewer&#x27;s left). Consistent with the U.S. Flag Code, the Texas Flag Code specifies that the state flag should either be flown below the U.S. flag if on the same pole or at the same height as the U.S. flag if on separate poles.

==Proposed governor&#x27;s flag==

The Texas governor currently uses a flag consisting of the state coat of arms (a lone star encircled by live oak and olive branches) on a light blue circle, all on a dark blue field with a white star in each corner. The flag has been in use since the late 1960s or early 1970s. The design has never been formally adopted by executive order or legislation. Legislation was introduced to the Texas Legislature in 2007 and 2009 to adopt the 1839 pilot flag/civil ensign of the Republic of Texas as the official flag of the governor of Texas. While the 2007 bill died in committee, the 2009 bill was passed by the House but died in a Senate committee due to the flag&#x27;s similarity to the flag of Russia.

Amendments to the Texas Flag Code, signed into law in 1993, authorize the governor to adopt a governor&#x27;s flag, but this executive authority has not been exercised.

==Similar flags==
Many flags used by municipalities, counties, and other entities in Texas use the same basic scheme as the Texas flag.

Texas&#x27;s flag is similar to the flag of Chile, first used in 1817. However, the Chilean flag has a blue canton with a white star rather than the entire left side being blue, with the red bottom stripe beginning below the canton. One author suggests that both the Chilean flag and the Texas flag were designed to look like the flag of the United States from afar while at sea.

The flag of Texas is also similar to the flag of North Carolina, modified in 1991. The North Carolina flag has the entire one-third of blue on the hoist like Texas&#x27;s flag, except that it contains a rather small white star with the gold letter &quot;N&quot; in gilt on the left and the gold letter &quot;C&quot; in gilt on the right of said star. The upper gold ribbon contains in black letters this inscription &quot;May 20th 1775&quot;, and the lower gold ribbon contains in black letters the inscription: &quot;April 12th 1776&quot;. The remaining of the flag is divided horizontally into an upper red bar and a lower white bar rather than an upper white bar and a lower red bar.

<doc id="310194" wikidata="Q913560" url="?curid=310194" title="The Brides of Funkenstein">
<text>The Brides of Funkenstein were an American soul and funk girl band, originally composed of singers Dawn Silva and Lynn Mabry.

==History==
Previously background singers for Sly Stone, singer of Sly and the Family Stone, Lynn Mabry and Dawn Silva joined the P-funk collective in the mid-1970s. George Clinton named the group from a storyline and characters from the Parliament album &quot;The Clones of Dr. Funkenstein&quot;. The Brides provided the vocals for the 1977 album &quot;Game, Dames and Guitar Thangs&quot; by P-Funk guitarist Eddie Hazel. Clinton produced their debut album, &quot;Funk Or Walk&quot;, for Atlantic Records in 1978. The duo became an opening act for Parliament-Funkadelic tours and also performed backing vocals for the ensemble itself.

Mabry left the group in 1979. Lead singer Silva invited back-up &quot;Bridesmaids&quot; Sheila Horne and Jeanette McGruder to sing on their second album, &quot;Never Buy Texas From A Cowboy&quot;. This lineup received a &quot;Cashbox&quot; Rhythm &amp; Blues award for best new female artist, beating out The Pointer Sisters, Sister Sledge, and Cheryl Lynn. The trio recorded a third album, &quot;Shadows On The Wall, Shaped Like The Hat You Wore&quot; in 1980, but the album was not released. Most of the songs from the unreleased album gradually appeared elsewhere in the P-Funk catalog.

Mabry resurfaced in 1984 as a backing vocalist with Talking Heads, appearing in the concert film &quot;Stop Making Sense&quot; along with P-Funk colleague Bernie Worrell. Silva and Mabry had a brief reunion in 1981 as the New Wave Brides, opening for Grace Jones, and a lengthy tour with Was (Not Was). Silva would tour and record with the Gap Band from 1983 to 1991, moving on to work with Ice Cube. In 2000 Silva released the solo album &quot;All My Funky Friends&quot;, which received rave reviews in Europe and Asia. Dawn Silva &amp; The Brides continue to tour.

<doc id="310196" wikidata="Q336581" url="?curid=310196" title="Red Auerbach">
<text>Arnold Jacob &quot;Red&quot; Auerbach (September 20, 1917 – October 28, 2006) was an American professional basketball coach and executive. He served as a head coach in the National Basketball Association (NBA), most notably with the Boston Celtics. Auerbach was also the head coach of the Washington Capitols and Tri-Cities Blackhawks. As a coach, Auerbach set NBA records with 938 wins and nine championships. After his coaching retirement in 1966, he served as president and front-office executive of the Celtics until his death. As general manager and team president of the Celtics, he won an additional seven NBA titles for a total of 16 in a span of 29 years, the most of any individual in NBA history, making him one of the most successful team officials in the history of North American professional sports.

Auerbach introduced the fast break technique as an offensive tool. He coached many players who went on to be inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame.

Auerbach had a role in combatting racial discrimination in the NBA. He made history by drafting the first African-American NBA player, Chuck Cooper, introducing the first African-American starting five,and hiring Bill Russell to be the first African-American head coach in North American sports in 1966. Auerbach was also well known for smoking a cigar when he thought a victory was assured, a habit that came to be known as &quot;the ultimate symbol of victory&quot; during his tenure in Boston.

In 1967, the NBA Coach of the Year award, which he won in 1965, was renamed the &quot;Red Auerbach Trophy&quot;. Auerbach was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1969. In 1970, Auerbach was named president of the Celtics and first held the presidency from 1970 to 1997. In 2001, after spending four years as the team&#x27;s vice-chairman, he returned to the role of team president and served in that capacity until his death in 2006. He was 89 years old when he died. In 1980, he was named the greatest coach in the history of the NBA by the Professional Basketball Writers Association of America; and was NBA Executive of the Year in 1980. In addition, Auerbach was voted one of the NBA 10 Greatest Coaches in history, inducted into the National Jewish Sports Hall of Fame, and honored with a retired number 2 jersey in the TD Garden, the home of the Celtics.

==Early life==
Arnold Jacob &quot;Red&quot; Auerbach was born in Brooklyn, New York City, on September 20, 1917. Auerbach was one of the four children of Marie and Hyman Auerbach. Hyman was a Russian-Jewish immigrant from Minsk, Russia, and Marie Auerbach, née Thompson, was American-born. Auerbach Sr. had left Russia when he was thirteen, and the couple owned a delicatessen store and later went into the dry-cleaning business. Auerbach spent his childhood in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, playing basketball. With his flaming red hair and fiery temper, Auerbach was nicknamed &quot;Red.&quot;

Amid the Great Depression, Auerbach played basketball as a guard at PS 122 and in the Eastern District High School, where he was named &quot;Second Team All-Brooklyn&quot; by the World-Telegram in his senior year.

==College career==
After a season at Seth Low Junior College, Auerbach received an athletic scholarship to play for George Washington Revolutionaries men&#x27;s basketball in Washington, D.C. Auerbach was a standout basketball player and graduated with an M.A. in 1941. In those years, Auerbach began to develop the technique known as the fast break.

==Coaching career==
===St. Albans School (1940)===
In 1940, Auerbach began coaching basketball at the St. Albans School.

===Roosevelt High School (1940–1943)===
Auerbach coached at Roosevelt High School in Washington, D.C. for three years. Three years later, he joined the US Navy for three years, coaching the Navy basketball team in Norfolk.

===Washington Capitols (1946–1949)===
At the US Navy, Auerbach caught the eye of Washington millionaire Mike Uline, who hired him to coach the Washington Capitols in the newly founded Basketball Association of America (BAA), a predecessor of the NBA.

In the 1946–47 BAA season, Auerbach led a fast break-oriented team built around early BAA star Bones McKinney and various ex-Navy players to a 49–11 win–loss record, including a standard-setting 17-game winning streak that stood as the single-season league record until 1969. In the playoffs, however, they were defeated by the Chicago Stags in six games.

The next year the Capitols went 28–20 but were eliminated from the playoffs in a one-game Western Division tie-breaker. In the 1948–49 BAA season, the Caps won their first fifteen games and finished the season at 38–22. The team reached the BAA Finals, but were beaten by the Minneapolis Lakers, who were led by Hall-of-Fame center George Mikan. In the next season, the BAA and the rival league the National Basketball League merged to become the NBA, and Auerbach felt he had to rebuild his squad. However, owner Uline declined his proposals, and Auerbach resigned.

After leaving the Capitols, Auerbach became assistant coach of the Duke Blue Devils men&#x27;s basketball team. It was assumed that Auerbach would take over for head coach Gerry Gerard, who was battling cancer. During his tenure at Duke, Auerbach regularly worked with future All-American Dick Groat. Auerbach later wrote that he &quot;felt pretty bad waiting for [Gerard] to die&quot; and that it was &quot;no way to get a job&quot;.

===Tri-Cities Blackhawks (1949–1950)===
Auerbach left Duke after a few months when Ben Kerner, owner of the Tri-Cities Blackhawks, gave him the green light to rebuild the team from scratch. Auerbach traded more than two dozen players in just six weeks, and the revamped Blackhawks improved but ended the 1949–50 NBA season with a losing record of 28–29. When Kerner traded Auerbach&#x27;s favorite player John Mahnken, an angry Auerbach resigned again.

In 1950, Auerbach took a position as the athletic director of Kutsher&#x27;s Hotel in the Catskills, NY. Kutsher&#x27;s was the center of a summertime basketball league, and players from the New York City area would participate, playing for one of several local country clubs and hotels.

===Boston Celtics (1950–1966)===
Before the 1950–51 NBA season, Walter Brown, owner of the Boston Celtics, was desperate to turn around his struggling and financially strapped franchise, which was reeling from a 22–46 record. Brown, in characteristic candor, said to a gathering of local Boston sportswriters, &quot;Boys, I don&#x27;t know anything about basketball. Who would you recommend I hire as a coach?&quot; The group vociferously answered that he got the recently available Auerbach, and Brown complied. In the 1950 NBA draft, Auerbach made some notable moves. First, he famously snubbed Hall-of-Fame New England point guard Bob Cousy in the 1950 NBA draft, infuriating the Boston crowd. He argued that the flashy Cousy lacked the poise necessary to make his team, taunting him as a &quot;local yokel&quot;. Second, he drafted African American Chuck Cooper, the first black player to be drafted by an NBA club. With that, Auerbach effectively broke down the color barrier in professional basketball.

In that year, the core of the Celtics consisted of Hall-of-Fame center Ed Macauley, Auerbach&#x27;s old favorite McKinney, and an unlikely addition, Cousy. Cousy had refused to report to the club that had drafted him (which happened to be the Blackhawks, Auerbach&#x27;s old club), and because his next team (the Chicago Stags) folded, he ended up with the Celtics. With Auerbach&#x27;s fast-break tactics, the Celtics achieved a 39–30 record but lost in the 1951 NBA Playoffs to the New York Knicks. However, the relationship between Auerbach and Cousy improved when the coach saw that the &quot;Houdini of the Hardwood&quot;—as the spectacular dribbler and flashy passer Cousy was lovingly called—became the first great playmaker of the fledgling NBA.

In the following 1951–52 NBA season, Auerbach made a remarkable draft pick of future Hall-of-Fame guard Bill Sharman. With the high-scoring Macauley, elite passer Cousy, and new prodigy Sharman, Auerbach had a core that provided high-octane fast-break basketball. Other notable players who joined the Celtics were the forwards Frank Ramsey and Jim Loscutoff. Until 1956, the Celtics would make the playoffs every year, but never won the title. The Celtics often choked in the playoffs, going a mere 10–17 in the postseason from 1951 through 1956. As Cousy put it: &quot;We would get tired in the end and could not get the ball.&quot; As a result, Auerbach sought a defensive big man who could get easy rebounds, initiate fast breaks, and close out games.
Before the 1956 NBA draft, Auerbach had already set his sights on defensive rebounding center Bill Russell. Via a draft-day trade that sent Macauley and rookie Cliff Hagan to the rival St. Louis Hawks (Kerner had moved the Blackhawks to St. Louis), he acquired a center in Russell. In the same draft, Auerbach picked up forward Tom Heinsohn and guard K.C. Jones, also two future Hall-of-Famers. Emphasizing team play rather than individual performances, and stressing that defense was more important than offense, Auerbach drilled his players to play tough defense and force opposing turnovers for easy fast-break points. Forward Tom Sanders recalled that the teams were also regularly among the best-conditioned and toughest squads.

Anchored by defensive stalwart Russell, the tough Celtics forced their opponents to take low-percentage shots from farther distances (there was no three-point arc at the time); misses were then often grabbed by perennial rebounding champion Russell, who then either passed it on to elite fast-break distributor Cousy or made the outlet pass himself, providing their sprinting colleague&#x27;s opportunities for an easy slam dunk or layup. Auerbach also emphasized the need for role players like Frank Ramsey and John Havlicek, who became two of the first legitimate sixth men in NBA history, a role later played by Don Nelson. Auerbach&#x27;s recipe proved devastating to the opposition. From 1957 to 1966, the Celtics won nine of ten NBA championships. This included eight consecutive championships—which is the longest championship streak in North American sports—and six victories over the Los Angeles Lakers of Hall-of-Famers Elgin Baylor and Jerry West in the NBA Finals. The streak also denied perennial scoring and rebounding champion Wilt Chamberlain a title during Auerbach&#x27;s coaching reign.

Flowing from Auerbach&#x27;s emphasis on teamwork, what was also striking about his teams was that they never seemed to have a dominant scorer: in the 1960–61 NBA season, for instance, the Celtics had six players who scored between 15 and 21 points per game, but none made the Top 10 scoring list. In 1964, he sent out the first-ever NBA starting five consisting of an African-American quintet, namely Russell, Willie Naulls, Tom Sanders, Sam Jones, and K. C. Jones. Auerbach would go a step further in the 1966–67 NBA season, when he stepped down after winning nine titles in 11 years and made Bill Russell player-coach. Auerbach also popularized smoking a victory cigar whenever he thought a game was already decided, a habit that became cult-like in popularity in the Boston area. Furthermore, having acquired a reputation as a fierce competitor, he often got into verbal altercations with officials, receiving more fines and getting ejected more often than any other coach in NBA history.
All in all, Auerbach directly coached nine NBA championship teams and mentored four players—Russell, Sharman, Heinsohn, and K.C. Jones—who would go on to win an additional seven NBA championships as coaches (two each for Russell, Heinsohn and Jones, all with the Celtics, and one for Sharman with the Lakers). Thirteen players who played for Auerbach have been inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame—Macauley, Ramsey, Cousy, Sharman, Heinsohn, Clyde Lovellette, Arnie Risen, Andy Phillip, John R. Thompson (as a coach), Russell, K. C. Jones, Havlicek, and Sam Jones. Although Don Nelson played for Auerbach only during his last year as coach, his influence was profound: Nelson would later join Auerbach as one of the 10 Greatest Coaches in NBA history. Sharman, Heinsohn, and Russell would become three of only five people to be inducted into the Hall of Fame as both a player and a coach.

Before the 1965–66 NBA season, Auerbach announced the coming year would be his last as coach, stating to the rest of the league, &quot;This is your chance to take your last shot at me.&quot; After losing game 1 of the 1966 finals to the Lakers in overtime, he publicly named his successor, center Bill Russell. The Celtics won the series in seven games, sending Auerbach out on top.

==Executive career==
===Boston Celtics (1966–2006)===
Russell then took over as a player-coach, and so became the first African-American head coach ever in the four major North American professional team sports. While his pupil led the Celtics to two further titles in 1968 and 1969, Auerbach rebuilt the aging Celtics with shrewd draft picks, among them future Hall-of-Famers Dave Cowens and Jo Jo White, as well as Paul Westphal and Don Chaney. With his ex-player Tom Heinsohn coaching the Celtics and led by former sixth man John Havlicek, Auerbach&#x27;s new recruits won the Atlantic Division every year from 1972 to 1976, winning the NBA title in 1974 and 1976. Auerbach also signed veteran forward/center Paul Silas and ex-ABA star Charles Scott.

However, Auerbach could not prevent the Celtics from going into a slump at the end of the 1970s. He traded away both Silas and Westphal because they wanted salary increases that would have made them higher earners than the best player on the Celtics (Cowens), which was not acceptable to Auerbach. While the Westphal trade to the Phoenix Suns in exchange for Charlie Scott was considered a success due to the Celtics&#x27; 13th title in 1976, Auerbach later admitted he erred in letting Silas go, even after Cowens personally begged him to give Silas a new deal. When Havlicek retired in 1978, the Celtics went 61–103 in two seasons. In the summer of 1978, after the worst in a string of contentious clashes with several different owners after Walter Brown&#x27;s passing in 1964, Auerbach hopped into a taxi to take him to Logan Airport, where he was to board a flight to New York to consider a lucrative contract offer from Knicks owner Sonny Werblin. However, the cab driver pleaded with him to stay, emphasizing how much Bostonians loved him and considered him family. Soon after, heading a team press conference, and with his typical bravado, Auerbach puffed on his trademark cigar and stated simply, &quot;I&#x27;m not going anywhere. We&#x27;re going to sign Larry Bird, and we&#x27;re going to be on top again.&quot; Despite knowing that Bird, a talented young player from unheralded Indiana State, had a year of college eligibility remaining, he had drafted Bird as a junior eligible in the 1978 NBA draft and waited for a year until the future Hall-of-Fame forward Bird arrived, finally setting aside his team salary rules when it became clear that his choices were paying Bird a record-setting rookie salary or watch him simply re-enter the 1979 draft. Bird then became the highest-paid Celtic as a rookie, with a $650,000-per-year deal. Auerbach knew that the brilliant, hard-working Bird would be the cornerstone of a new Celtics generation.

In 1980, Auerbach pulled off what became known as &quot;The Steal of The Century&quot;. He convinced the Golden State Warriors to trade him a #3 overall pick and future Hall-of-Fame center Robert Parish in exchange for two picks in the 1980 NBA draft: #1 overall Joe Barry Carroll and the #13 pick Rickey Brown. With the #3 pick, Auerbach selected the player he most wanted in the draft, Kevin McHale, who would also be inducted into the Hall of Fame. The Parish-McHale-Bird frontcourt became one of the greatest in NBA history. Auerbach also hired head coach Bill Fitch, who led the revamped Celtics to the 1981 title.

In 1983, Auerbach named former Celtics player K.C. Jones as the coach of the Celtics. Starting in 1984, Jones coached the Celtics to four straight appearances in the NBA Finals, winning championships in 1984 and 1986.

Auerbach, as a part-time side gig, was the color analyst on NBA and college basketball games for TBS sports from 1982 to 1987.

In 1984, after he relinquished his general managing duties to Jan Volk, Auerbach focused on continuing as president and later vice-chairman of the Boston Celtics. In a surprising move after winning their 15th title, he traded popular guard Gerald Henderson, the game-2 hero in the finals against the Lakers, for Seattle&#x27;s first-round draft pick in 1986. Two years later, after the Celtics defeated Houston in the finals for their 16th championship, he used the second overall pick in the 1986 draft, the pick acquired from Seattle, to take college prodigy Len Bias from Maryland, arguably the most brilliant coup in Auerbach&#x27;s stellar career. With the team&#x27;s star players still in their prime, the defending champions appeared set to compete at the top for years. However, tragedy struck just two days later, when Bias died of a cocaine overdose. Several years later, Celtics star player Reggie Lewis died suddenly in 1993, and without any league compensation for either loss, the team fell into decline, not seeing another Finals in Auerbach&#x27;s lifetime.

In an interview, Auerbach confessed that he lost interest in big-time managing in the early 1990s, preferring to stay in the background and concentrating on his pastimes, racquetball and his beloved cigar-smoking. He would, however, stay on with the Celtics as president until 1997, as vice chairman until 2001, and then became president again, a position he held until his death, although in his final years, he was weakened by heart problems and often used a wheelchair.

==Personal life==

Auerbach was one of four children of American-born Marie Auerbach and Russian Jewish immigrant Hyman Auerbach in Brooklyn. His brother Zang Auerbach, four years his junior, was a respected cartoonist and portraitist at the &quot;Washington Star&quot;. Zang also helped create the iconic Boston Celtics leprechaun logo. He married Dorothy Lewis in the spring of 1941. The couple had two daughters, Nancy and Randy. They also helped raise Nancy&#x27;s daughter Julie.

Auerbach was known for his love of cigar smoking. Due to his affinity for victory cigars in the 1960s, Boston restaurants would often say &quot;No cigar or pipe smoking, except for Red Auerbach&quot;. In addition, Auerbach was well known for his love of Chinese food. In an interview shortly before his death, he explained that since the 1950s, Chinese takeout was the most convenient nutrition: back then, NBA teams traveled on regular flights and had a tight schedule, so filling up the stomach with heavier non-Chinese food meant wasting time and risking travel-sickness. Over the years, Auerbach became so fond of this food that he even became a part-owner of a Chinese restaurant in Boston. Despite a heart operation, he remained active in his 80s, playing racquetball and making frequent public appearances.

Despite his fierce nature, Auerbach was popular among his players. He recalled that on his 75th birthday party, 45 of his former players showed up; and when he turned 80, his perennial 1960s victim Wilt Chamberlain showed up, a gesture which Auerbach dearly appreciated.

In an interview with ESPN, Auerbach stated that his all-star fantasy team would consist of Bill Russell—who in the former&#x27;s opinion was the ultimate player to start a franchise with—as well as Bob Pettit, Elgin Baylor, Oscar Robertson and Jerry West, with John Havlicek as the sixth man. As for the greatest basketballers of all time, Auerbach&#x27;s candidates were Russell, Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Michael Jordan. Auerbach made multiple such &quot;all-time&quot; rankings over the years, with his last one being in June 2006, months before his death. Auerbach talked about his fictional team with journalist Ken Shouler which featured the following: Abdul-Jabbar, Chamberlain, and Russell at center; Bird, Erving, Pettit, and Baylor at forward; and Robertson, Jordan, Havlicek, Johnson, and Cousy at guard.

===Death===
Auerbach died of a heart attack on October 28, 2006, at the age of 89. NBA commissioner David Stern said, &quot;The void caused by his death will never be filled&quot; and players Bill Russell, K.C. Jones, John Havlicek and Larry Bird, as well as contemporaries like Jerry West, Pat Riley, and Wayne Embry universally hailed Auerbach as one of the greatest personalities in NBA history. Bird stated &quot;Red shared our passion for the game, our commitment to excellence, and our desire to do whatever it takes to win.&quot; Auerbach was survived by his daughters, Nancy, Randy, Julie, and Julie&#x27;s children Peter, Hope, and Noelle. Auerbach was interred in Falls Church, Virginia at King David Memorial Gardens within National Memorial Park on October 31, 2006. Attendees included basketball dignitaries Bill Russell, Kevin McHale, Danny Ainge, and David Stern.

During the 2006–07 NBA season, NBA TV and NBA.com aired reruns of Auerbach&#x27;s four-minute instructional videos known as &quot;Red on Roundball&quot; previously aired during &quot;NBA on CBS&quot; halftime shows in the 1970s and 1980s, and as a testament to his importance in the Boston sports world, the Boston Red Sox honored Auerbach at their April 20, 2007 game against the New York Yankees by wearing green uniforms and by hanging replicated Celtics championship banners on the &quot;Green Monster&quot; at Fenway Park. Boston won 7–6.

Prior to Boston&#x27;s season opener against the Wizards, his signature was officially placed on the parquet floor near center court, thereby naming the court as &quot;Red Auerbach Parquet Floor&quot;. The ceremony was attended by his daughter Randy and some of the Celtics legends. The signature replaced the Red Auerbach memorial logo used during the 2007 season.

==Writing==
Auerbach was the author of seven books. His first, &quot;Basketball for the Player, the Fan and Coach&quot;, has been translated into seven languages and is the best-selling basketball book in print. His second book, co-authored with Paul Sann, was &quot;Winning the Hard Way.&quot; He also wrote a pair of books with Joe Fitzgerald: &quot;Red Auerbach: An Autobiography&quot; and &quot;Red Auerbach On and Off the Court.&quot; In October 1991 &quot;M.B.A.: Management by Auerbach&quot; was co-authored with Ken Dooley. In 1994, &quot;Seeing Red&quot; was written with Dan Shaughnessy. In October 2004, his last book, &quot;Let Me Tell You a Story&quot;, was co-authored with sports journalist John Feinstein.

==Legacy==

Among Auerbach&#x27;s accomplishments during his 20-year professional coaching career were eleven Eastern Division titles (including nine in a row from 1957 to 1965), eleven appearances in the finals (including ten in a row from 1957 to 1966), and nine NBA championships. With a total of sixteen NBA championship rings in a span of 29 years (1957–86) as the Celtics coach, general manager, and team president, Auerbach is the most successful team official in NBA history. He is credited with creating several generations of championship Boston Celtics teams, including the first Celtics dynasty with Bill Russell, which won an NBA record eight titles in a row (1959–66). As Celtics general manager, he created championship-winning teams around Hall-of-Famers Dave Cowens and John Havlicek in the 1970s and Larry Bird in the 1980s.

In addition to coaching, Auerbach was a highly effective mentor; several players coached by Auerbach would become successful coaches themselves. Bill Russell won two titles as Auerbach&#x27;s successor, Tom Heinsohn won a pair of championships as a Celtics coach in the 1970s, K.C. Jones led the Celtics to two further titles in the 1980s, and Bill Sharman coached the Los Angeles Lakers to their first title in 1972. In addition, prototypical sixth man Don Nelson had a highly successful coaching career and joined his mentor Auerbach as one of 10 Greatest Coaches in NBA history. Outside the NBA, former Auerbach pupil John Thompson became a highly successful college coach with the Georgetown Hoyas, leading the team to the 1984 NCAA championship and mentored Hall of Fame players Patrick Ewing, Dikembe Mutombo, Alonzo Mourning, and Allen Iverson.

Throughout his coaching tenure in Boston, Auerbach served several other roles including, but not limited to, general manager, head of scouting, personnel director, and travel agent. In the early off-seasons, he would take the Celtics on barnstorming tours around New England, promoting the still fledgling NBA. At the end of every season, regardless of their on-court success, he approached owner Brown and asked, &quot;Walter, are our last paychecks going to clear?&quot; to which Brown would always positively respond, and they would. Despite Brown&#x27;s own close association with the NHL&#x27;s Boston Bruins, whose owners also possessed the Boston Garden, the Celtics were fleeced on concessions and profits as tenants. During this era, when most team owners not only thought of but also treated their players as cattle, athletes from all four major professional sports leagues were fighting for their rights and economic fairness. As Auerbach represented the management of the Celtics, team members frustrated with their salaries had only him to complain to, or about, in their role in the formation of the players&#x27; union. These interpersonal dynamics are construed as follows by journalist David Halberstam:


Auerbach was considered to be tough at the negotiating table, often opening contract negotiations with what he regarded as a fair offer and was not easily swayed into accepting alternatives. In the summer of 1984, Auerbach signed former finals MVP Cedric Maxwell to a lucrative guaranteed contract to stay with the Celtics. Auerbach faced a setback when Maxwell arrived that fall out of shape and, suffering from injuries, contributed little as the team was defeated by the Lakers in the 1985 Finals. Two key events followed: Auerbach traded Maxwell to San Diego in exchange for former MVP Bill Walton, who played a significant role in the team winning its 16th title in 1986, the last championship during Auerbach&#x27;s tenure. Second, Maxwell remains a respected figure within the Celtics organization, with his number retired alongside other notable players.

In Auerbach&#x27;s honor, the Celtics retired a number-2 jersey with his name, recognizing his significant contributions to the franchise, second only to founder Walter Brown, who is honored with the number-1 &#x27;BROWN&#x27; jersey.

His story is portrayed in the 2006 documentary &quot;The First Basket&quot;. It focuses on the history of Jews in Basketball. He is also featured as an interview subject for the film.

===Coaching pioneer===
From his early days, Auerbach was convinced that the fast break, where a team used a quick outlet pass to fast guards who ran downcourt and scored before the opponent had re-established position, was a potent tactical weapon. This new strategy proved lethal for the opposition. Further, Auerbach moved the emphasis away from individual accolades and instilled the teamwork element into his players. He also invented the concept of the role player and of the sixth man, stating: &quot;Individual honors are nice, but no Celtic has ever gone out of his way to achieve them. We have never had the league&#x27;s top scorer. In fact, we won seven league championships without placing even one among the league&#x27;s top 10 scorers. Our pride was never rooted in statistics.&quot;

While Auerbach was not known for his tactical bandwidth, famously restricting his teams to just seven plays, he was well known for his psychological warfare, often provoking opposing players and officials with unabashed trash talk. For his fiery temper, he was ejected more often and received more fines than any other coach in NBA history. Age did nothing to diminish his fire; in 1983, after star Larry Bird was ejected from a preseason game against Philadelphia at the Garden along with the Sixers&#x27; role player Marc Iavaroni, Auerbach stormed onto the court and after taking the officials to task, screamed nose-to-nose with the 6&#x27;10&quot; 260-pound Moses Malone. Concerning his own team, Auerbach was softer. Earl Lloyd, the first black player to play in the NBA, said: &quot;Red Auerbach convinced his players that he loved them ... so all they wanted to do was please him.&quot;

===No color barrier===
Auerbach was known for choosing players for talent and motivation, with disregard for skin color or ethnicity. In 1950, he made NBA history by drafting the league&#x27;s first African-American player Chuck Cooper. He constantly added new black players to his squad, including Bill Russell, Satch Sanders, Sam Jones, K. C. Jones, and Willie Naulls. In 1964, these five players became the first African-American starting five in the NBA. When Auerbach gave up coaching to become the Celtics general manager in 1966, he appointed Bill Russell as his successor. Russell became the first black NBA coach and was the first black coach of a professional sports organization since Fritz Pollard in 1925. As the Celtics general manager in the 1980s, Auerbach fielded an earnest, hardworking team that was derided as being &quot;too white&quot;. While the 1980s Celtics were not predominantly white or black, the NBA at the time was predominately black. White players like Larry Bird, Kevin McHale, Danny Ainge, and Bill Walton played alongside Tiny Archibald, Dennis Johnson, Robert Parish, and Cedric Maxwell to bring three more championships in the 1980s under coaches Bill Fitch (white) and Jones (black).

===Arnold &quot;Red&quot; Auerbach Award===
To honor Auerbach, the Celtics created the Arnold &quot;Red&quot; Auerbach Award in 2006. It is an award given annually to the current Celtic player or coach who &quot;best exemplifies the spirit and meaning of a true Celtic.&quot;

===NBA Coach of the Year Award===
The NBA gives out an annual coach of the year award to honor the league&#x27;s best coach as voted by a panel of sportswriters. The trophy is named the Red Auerbach Trophy, which depicts a figure of Auerbach sitting on a bench.

<doc id="310208" wikidata="Q5832" url="?curid=310208" title="Axum">
<text>Axum, also spelled Aksum (), is a town in the Tigray Region of Ethiopia with a population of 66,900 residents (as of 2015). It is the site of the historic capital of the Aksumite Empire.

Axum is located in the Central Zone of the Tigray Region, near the base of the Adwa mountains. It has an elevation of and is surrounded by La&#x27;ilay Maychew, a separately administered woreda of the Tigray region.

In 1980, UNESCO added Axum&#x27;s archaeological sites to its list of World Heritage Sites due to their historic value. Prior to the beginning of the Tigray War in 2020, Axum was a leading tourist destination for foreign visitors.

==History==
===Ancient===
Little information is available regarding the early centuries of Aksum&#x27;s presumed evolution from a humble regional hub to a dominant power. Archeological findings at Gobadra (Gobo Dara) and the Anqar Baahti rock-shelters suggest Stone Age remnants in close proximity. R. Fattovich&#x27;s excavations at amba &#x27;Beta Giyorgis above Aksum validate the pre-Aksumite roots of a settlement in Aksum dating back to approximately 7th to 4th centuries B.C. Furthermore, excavations in the Stele Park at the heart of Aksum. substantiate ongoing activity in that area since the beginning of the common era. By the 1st century AD, Aksum was described as a &quot;metropolis&quot; in the &quot;Periplus of the Erythraean Sea&quot;.

Several archaeological expeditions have conducted excavations in various parts of Aksum. The early utilization of stelae, or obelisks as grave markers, is documented, evolving over time to encompass some of the world&#x27;s largest monuments. Initially, the granite stelae in the primary cemetery, housing the Aksumite royal tombs, and in other cemeteries around the town were plain and rough. Subsequently, they became plain but carefully dressed in granite, eventually carved to emulate multi-storey towers in a distinctive architectural style. The Aksumite architecture is characterized by massive dressed granite blocks, smaller uncut stones for walling, mud mortar to fix them, bricks for vaulting and arches, and an external wooden framework resembling &quot;monkey-heads&quot; or square corner extrusions. The walls tend to incline inwards as they ascend, often featuring several recessed bays for added strength. A comparable architectural style is evident in substantial &quot;palace&quot; structures not only in Axum but also in other cities like Adulis and Matara. The presence of a large reservoir, now known as May Sum, below the hill called May Oho, may trace back to Aksumite times, indicating the city&#x27;s reliable water supply. axum likely had a prosperous agricultural vicinity, evident from wheat depicted on Aksumite coins, abundant livestock, local forests supplying firewood for centuries, and various industries such as metalworking, glassware, and pottery. The Aksumites&#x27; achievements in architecture and stone-working, along with evidence of ivory and leather-working, are found in Aksumite tombs.

Cosmas Indicopleustes, who visited Aksum in the second decade of the 6th century, described the four-towered palace of the king of Ethiopia, adorned with bronze statues of unicorns. Aksum also housed rows of monumental granite thrones, likely bearing metal statues dedicated to pre-Christian deities such as Astar, Baher, Madr, and Mahram. These thrones incorporated large panels with inscriptions, some attributed to Ousanas, Ezana, Kaleb, and his son Wazeba, chronicling their wars and serving as victory monuments. One inscription mentions Ezana setting up a throne &quot;here in Sado,&quot; presumably a place in Aksum. Libraries in Aksum housed essential Christian documents, and Coptic monks translated many of these books in the 5th and 6th century. The Bible was translated into Ge&#x27;ez language, and the sole, complete surviving copy of the Book of Enoch is in the Ge&#x27;ez language.

Contact with the Byzantine Empire ceased after its eastern provinces were seized by the Arabs and as a consequence, Aksum grew poorer and more isolated. It ceased to be the political capital of the Kingdom of Aksum sometime after the 8th century, which was relocated to the south. An inscription, crafted by a certain Hasani &#x27;Dano&#x27;el, mentions his success in subjugating the king of Aksum and reducing the city to the status of a tributary to his own kingdom in the 9th century. It is conceivable that the ecological damage extended to the surrounding area of Aksum due to increasing demands for foodstuffs and firewood. The region around the town might have eventually become incapable of sustaining the population of a major political center. By the end of the 9th century, Aksum was largely abandoned and lay in ruins.

=== Medieval ===
The city rose to prominence again after the rise of the Solomonic Dynasty, and became the spiritual capital of the Ethiopian Empire. A collection of Ge&#x27;ez documents, encompassing a concise legendary history of Aksum, land charters, and other related material, known as the &quot;Book of Axum&quot;, is occasionally discovered bound within manuscript books alongside the Kebra Nagast and other works. This compilation provides numerous insights into the church&#x27;s possessions and the subsequent history of the town. The city also had its own governor known as the Nebure Id, who was also a high dignitary of the church. The Kebra Nagast was written by Nebure Id Yishaq of Aksum, but Aksum is never mentioned by name in the
book. Instead, the &quot;city of the kingdom&quot; is called Dabra Makadda.

The Aksum Seyon was restored by Dawit I in 1406. It has been rumored to house the Biblical Ark of the Covenant, in which lie the Tablets of Stone upon which the Ten Commandments are inscribed. Zara Yaqob underwent his coronation there in 1436 and continued to reside in Aksum for three years. Subsequently, a few other monarchs also chose Aksum as the site for their coronation ceremonies. This unique ritual involved cutting a cord held by the &quot;daughters of Aksum,&quot; symbolizing the king&#x27;s ascent to &quot;king of Zion.&quot; The ancient Aksumite stone thrones served as coronation chairs, although the &quot;coronation&quot; itself comprised an anointing and tonsuring ritual, followed by a mass in the church.

Francisco Alvares, a Portuguese missionary and explorer who spent eight months in Aksum in the 1520s described it as &quot;a large town with very good houses and very good wells of water of very beautiful worked masonry, and also in most of the houses ancient figures of lions and dogs and birds, all well made in very hard, fine stone&quot; He also described Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion, the stelae, the thrones and other structures. Describing the church, he wrote: &quot;This church is very large; it has five aisles of good width and of great length, vaulted above, and all the vaults closed, the ceiling and sides all painted. Below, the body of the church is well worked with handsome cut stone; it has seven chapels, all with their backs to the east, and their altars well ornamented. It has a choir after our fashion, except that it is low, and they reach the vaulted roof with their heads; and the choir is also over the vault, and they do not use it. This church has a very large circuit, paved with flagstones like the lids of tombs. This consists of a very high wall, and it is not covered over like those of the other churches, but is left open. This church has a large enclosure, and it is also surrounded with another larger enclosure, like the enclosing wall of a large town or city. Within this enclosure are handsome groups of one storey buildings, and all spout out their water by strong figures of lions and dogs of stone [of different colours]. Inside this large enclosure there are two mansions, one on the right hand and the other on the left, which belong to the two rectors of the church; and the other houses are of canons and monks.&quot;

Adal leader Ahmed ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi led the conquest of Axum in the sixteenth century. Aksum was sacked and burned in 1535 by the troops of Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi who destroyed the church that Alvares had described. Before the city was sacked, a document in the Book of Aksum lists 1,705 golden objects as well as many other items from Aksum that Lebna Dengel distributed to various governors to save them from destruction, and it is recorded by Ahmad&#x27;s chronicler that a large stone object
was removed at this time for safety to &quot;Tabr&quot;.

Manuel de Almeida who visited after the convulsions of Ahmed ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi confirmed the extent of the ruin that befell Aksum in the 16th century commenting that it then had only about 100 inhabitants where everywhere there are ruins to be seen.

The city was rebuilt in 1580 by Emperor Sarsa Dengel who restored the church and held his coronation there.

===17th century===
In 1604/05 the city was visited by the Jesuit Fernao Guerreiro, he reported that the church had a nave, two aisles, and a thatched roof. It is possible that some elements of the internal architecture from the former church endured, including the outer walls, within which the smaller new church was situated. In 1608, during the coronation of Susenyos I in Aksum, Mass was conducted at this location. However in 1611, Aksum was sacked by Oromo, who set fire to the church. Pedro Páez who visited Aksum in around 1620 saw only about 150-200 mud houses, and Manoel Barradas wrote that Aksum was no more than a small village.

In 1655, Fasilides had the church restored. Its dedication was celebrated by his daughter, Princess Yodit, who gave &quot;an incalculable quantity of money&quot;, so that the church became &quot;marvellous and magnificent&quot;. In 1678, rebels under Ras &#x27;Faris, governor of Salawa, burned Aksum, but the church survived to serve at the coronation of Iyasu I in 1693.

===18th century===
The French traveller visited Aksum (which he called &quot;Heleni&quot;) in 1700, describing the stelae and the church. James Bruce also left descriptions of the old town, which in his time consisted, he estimated, of about 600 houses. He believed Aksum to have been mainly the work of the Ptolemies, crediting most of the monuments to Ptolemy III Euergetes.

After the decline of imperial authority in the period of the Zemene Mesafint, Aksum fell under the control of the rulers of Tigray. One of whom, Wolde Selassie, would grant the church of St. Mary a land grant in 1794.

===19th century===

According to the missionary Samuel Gobat, in the early 19th century Aksum was economically well off, as it was situated in a &quot;vast fertile plain&quot; which was &quot;richly cultivated&quot;. Apart from the ruins, the settlement was made up almost entirely of round huts with thatched roofs.

The warlord Wube Haile Maryam, gave a land grant to the Church of St. Mary in an undated charter.

On 12 January 1872, Yohannes IV was crowned Emperor of Ethiopia in the city of Aksum.

In February 1893 the British explorers, James Theodore Bent and his wife Mabel Bent, travelled by boat to Massawa on the west coast of the Red Sea. They then made their way overland to excavate at Axum and Yeha, in the hope of researching possible links between early trading networks and cultures on both sides of the Red Sea. They reached Axum by 24 February 1893, but their work was curtailed by the tensions between the Italian occupiers and local warlords, together with the continuing ramifications of the First Italo-Ethiopian War and they had to make a hasty retreat by the end of March to Zula for passage back to England.

The British journalist Augustus B. Wylde wrote after visiting Aksum in 1897: &quot;after every heavy downpour of rain, old coins are washed out of the soil, the local boys were delighted to accompany a stranger about the place. They were intelligent, sharp-eyed little urchins who took a great interest in the search for curiosities, though unless someone is there to reward them for finding the old coins they do not trouble to pick them up, as they are of no value to them.&quot;

===20th century===

Aksumite remains were investigated in 1906 by an important German archaeological mission led by the renowned scholar Enno Littmann.

Early in the Second Italo-Ethiopian War, Italian troops seized Aksum in October 1936. In 1937, a tall, 1,700-year-old Obelisk of Axum, was broken into five parts by the Italians and shipped to Rome to be erected. The obelisk is widely regarded as one of the finest examples of engineering from the height of the Axumite empire. Despite a 1947 United Nations agreement that the obelisk would be shipped back, Italy balked, resulting in a long-standing diplomatic dispute with the Ethiopian government, which views the obelisk as a symbol of national identity.

During the Ethiopian Civil War, on 30 March 1989, Axum was bombed from the air by the Ethiopian Air Force and three people were killed.

===21st century===
In April 2005, Italy finally returned the obelisk pieces to Axum amidst much official and public rejoicing; Italy also covered the US$4 million costs of the transfer. UNESCO assumed responsibility for the re-installation of this stele in Axum, and by the end of July 2008 the obelisk had been reinstalled. It was unveiled on 4 September 2008.

During the Tigray War, around 100–800 civilians were massacred by the Eritrean Army between 28 November and 15 December 2020.

==Main sites of Axum==
The major Aksumite monuments in the town are steles. These obelisks are around 1,700 years old and have become a symbol of the Ethiopian people&#x27;s identity. The largest number are in the Northern Stelae Park, ranging up to the Great Stele, believed to have fallen and broken during construction. The Obelisk of Axum was removed by the Italian army in 1937, and returned to Ethiopia in 2005 and reinstalled 31 July 2008. The next tallest is the King Ezana&#x27;s Stele. Three more stelae measure high, high, high. The stelae are believed to mark graves and would have had cast metal discs affixed to their sides, which are also carved with architectural designs. The Gudit Stelae to the west of town, unlike the northern area, are interspersed with mostly 4th century tombs.
The other major features of the town are the old and new churches of &quot;Our Lady Mary of Zion&quot;. The Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion was built in 1665 by Emperor Fasilides and said to have previously housed the Ark of the Covenant. The original cathedral, said to have been built by Ezana and augmented several times afterwards, was believed to have been massive with an estimated 12 naves. It was burned to the ground by Gudit, rebuilt, and then destroyed again during the Abyssinian–Adal war of the 1500s. It was again rebuilt by Emperor Gelawdewos (completed by his brother and successor Emperor Minas) and Emperor Fasilides replaced that structure with the present one. Only men are permitted entry into the Old St. Mary&#x27;s Cathedral (some say as a result of the destruction of the original church by Gudit). The New Cathedral of St. Mary of Zion stands next to the old one, and was built to fulfil a pledge by Emperor Haile Selassie to Our Lady of Zion for the liberation of Ethiopia from the Fascist occupation. Built in a neo-Byzantine style, work on the new cathedral began in 1955, and allows entry to women. Emperor Haile Selassie interrupted the state visit of Queen Elizabeth II to travel to Axum to attend the dedication of the new cathedral and pay personal homage, showing the importance of this church in the Ethiopian Empire. Queen Elizabeth visited the Cathedral a few days later. Between the two cathedrals is a small chapel known as The Chapel of the Tablet built at the same time as the new cathedral, and which is believed to house the Ark of the Covenant. Emperor Haile Selassie&#x27;s consort, Empress Menen Asfaw, paid for its construction from her private funds. Admittance to the chapel is closed to all but the guardian monk who resides there. Entrance is even forbidden to the Patriarch of the Orthodox Church, and to the Emperor of Ethiopia during the monarchy. The two cathedrals and the chapel of the Ark are the focus of pilgrimage and considered the holiest sites in Ethiopia to members of its Orthodox Church.
Other attractions in Axum include archaeological and ethnographic museums, the Ezana Stone written in Sabaean, Geʽez and Ancient Greek in a similar manner to the Rosetta Stone, King Bazen&#x27;s Tomb (a megalith considered to be one of the earliest structures), the so-called Queen of Sheba&#x27;s Bath (actually a reservoir), the 4th-century Ta&#x27;akha Maryam and 6th-century Dungur palaces, Pentalewon Monastery and Abba Liqanos and about west is the rock art called the Lioness of Gobedra.

Local legend claims the Queen of Sheba lived in the town.

==Climate==
The Köppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies its climate as subtropical highland (Cwb).
==Demographics==

According to the Central Statistical Agency of Ethiopia (CSA), the town of Axum&#x27;s estimated population was 56,576. The census indicated that 30,293 of the population were females and 26,283 were males.

The 2007 national census showed that the town population was 44,647, of whom 20,741 were males and 23,906 females). The majority of the inhabitants said they practiced Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity, with 88.03% reporting that as their religion, while 10.89% of the population were Ethiopian Muslim.

The 1994 national census reported the population for the city as 27,148, of whom 12,536 were men and 14,612 were women. The largest ethnic group reported was Tigrayans with 98.54% and Tigrinya was spoken as a first language by 98.68%. The majority of the population practised Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity with 85.08% reported as embracing that religion, while 14.81% were Muslim.

==Transport==

Axum Airport, also known as &quot;Emperor Yohannes IV Airport&quot;, is located just to the east of the city.

==Education==
Aksum University was established in May 2006 on a greenfield site, from Axum&#x27;s central area. The inauguration ceremony was held on 16 February 2007 and the current area of the campus is , with ample room for expansion. The establishment of a university in Axum is expected to contribute much to the ongoing development of the country in general and of the region in particular.

<text>Pleasure Principle is the debut album by the female P-Funk spin off group Parlet. The album was released in 1978 by Casablanca Records and was produced by P-Funk leader/producer George Clinton. Parlet consisted of Mallia Franklin, Debbie Wright, and Jeanette Washington. The album features heavy involvement from the P-Funk musical collective.

The track &quot;Cookie Jar&quot; was originally written and recorded by Clarence &quot;Fuzzy&quot; Haskins.

In 1992, &quot;Pleasure Principle&quot; was reissued on CD in Japan by the Casablanca/Polystar label, but quickly went out of print. On July 30, 2013, Real Gone Music in the U.S. reissued both &quot;Pleasure Principle&quot; and &quot;Invasion of the Booty Snatchers&quot;, featuring liner notes by former P-Funk minister of information Tom Vickers.

<doc id="310210" wikidata="Q16766" url="?curid=310210" title="Andy Lau">
<text>Andy Lau Tak-wah (; born Lau Fook-wing; 27 September 1961) is a Hong Kong actor, singer-songwriter and film producer. He was named the &quot;Fourth Tiger&quot; among the Five Tiger Generals of TVB in the 1980s as well as one of the Four Heavenly Kings in the 1990s. In the Philippines, he was previously given the screen name Ricky Chan.

Lau won the Hong Kong Film Award for Best Actor three times, the Golden Horse Award for Best Leading Actor twice, and was entered into the Guinness World Records for the &quot;Most Awards Won by a Cantopop Male Artist&quot; in 2000, with a total of 444 music awards by 2006. &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine has ranked Lau as one of the world&#x27;s highest-paid actors. In 2018, Lau became a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. In 2024, Lau was elected vice chairman of the 11th China Film Association. Over a career of four decades, Lau has been one of the most commercially and critically successful artists in the Chinese world.

== Early life ==
Lau was born Lau Fook-wing in Tai Po, British Hong Kong to fireman Lau Lai (1934–2023). He is the fourth of six siblings and has three elder sisters, one younger sister, and a younger brother named Lau Tak-sing. Although his family was wealthy due to his grandfather being a landowner with farmland and villages, his father moved them to the slums of Diamond Hill when he was six years old so he could receive a bilingual education to improve his English. The area was full of wooden houses, which unfortunately burnt down when he was eleven. During his childhood, Lau had to fetch water for his family up to eight times a day as their house lacked plumbing. He graduated from a Band One secondary school, Ho Lap College in San Po Kong, Kowloon. He also practices Chinese calligraphy and hair styling. He was raised in a nominally Buddhist household and is a follower of the Lingyan Mountain Temple in Taiwan.

== Career ==
=== Acting ===
In 1980, Lau enrolled in TVB&#x27;s actor training program and graduated the next year, signing a contract with TVB. He was propelled to fame by the TVB series &quot;The Emissary&quot; (1982). His popularity soared the next year with his role as Yang Guo in the TVB &quot;wuxia&quot; series &quot;The Return of the Condor Heroes;&quot; at the end of the year, Lau was featured in the TVB Anniversary Gala Show, alongside Tony Leung, Michael Miu, Felix Wong, and Kent Tong. Since then they were known as the &quot;Five Tiger Generals of TVB&quot;.

Meanwhile, Lau also started his film career. He made a guest appearance in one of Susanna Kwan&#x27;s music videos in 1981 and caught the eye of the manager Teddy Robin, who gave Lau his first minor role in the film, &quot;Once Upon a Rainbow&quot;. Lau then landed a role in Ann Hui&#x27;s 1982 film, &quot;Boat People&quot;. In 1983, he had his first leading role in the Shaw Brothers-produced action film, &quot;On the Wrong Track&quot;.

TVB insisted on a binding five-year exclusive contract, which Lau declined to sign, leading to his blacklisting by the network. In the late &#x27;80s, Lau departed from TVB and shifted his focus towards films. He established himself for his performances in films such as &quot;The Truth&quot; (1988)&quot;,&quot; Wong Kar-wai&#x27;s &quot;As Tears Go By&quot; (1988) and Benny Chan&#x27;s film &quot;A Moment of Romance&quot; (1990). His first major acting prize came with &quot;A Fighter&#x27;s Blues&quot;, which was his first Golden Bauhinia Award for Best Actor. He won the Hong Kong Film Award for Best Actor award that year for &quot;Running Out of Time&quot;. In 2004, he won the Golden Horse Award for Best Leading Actor for his performance in &quot;Infernal Affairs III&quot;.

Since the early 21st century, Lau has started working with filmmakers from China and beyond, notably in Zhang Yimou&#x27;s &quot;House of Flying Daggers&quot; (2004) and Feng Xiaogang&#x27;s &quot;A World Without Thieves&quot; (2004). In 2006 he starred in the pan-Asian blockbuster &quot;A Battle of Wits&quot; (2006), followed by a series of big-budget historical films such as &quot;The Warlords&quot; (2007), &quot;Three Kingdoms: Resurrection of the Dragon&quot; (2008), and Tsui Hark&#x27;s &quot;Detective Dee and the Mystery of the Phantom Flame&quot; (2010). 

In 2005, Lau received the &quot;No.1 Box office Actor 1985–2005&quot; award of Hong Kong, yielding a box office total of HKD 1,733,275,816 for shooting 108 films in the past 20 years. The aforementioned figure is as compared to the first runner-up Stephen Chow&#x27;s (HKD 1,317,452,311) and second runner-up Jackie Chan&#x27;s (HKD 894,090,962). For his contributions, a wax figure of Lau was unveiled on 1 June 2005 at the Madame Tussauds Hong Kong. In 2007, Lau also received the &quot;Nielsen Box Office Star of Asia&quot; award by the Nielsen Company (ACNielsen).

April 2017, he starred in the Hong Kong action film &quot;Shock Wave&quot;, which earned him another Best Actor Award at the 37th Hong Kong Film Awards in 2018. In February 2021, Lau reunited with Tony Leung since the &quot;Infernal Affairs&quot; series in the action film &quot;The Goldfinger&quot;.

=== Film production ===
In 1991, Lau set up his own film production company, Teamwork Motion Pictures, which in 2002 was renamed to Focus Group Holdings Limited. He was awarded the &quot;Asian Filmmaker of the Year&quot; in the Pusan International Film Festival in 2006. The films Lau has produced include &quot;Made in Hong Kong,&quot; &quot;A Simple Life&quot;, &quot;A Fighter&#x27;s Blues&quot;, &quot;Crazy Stone&quot;, &quot;Firestorm&quot; and &quot;Shock Wave&quot;.

=== Music ===

Lau released his first album &quot;Just Know I Only Love You&quot; (1985) under the record label Capital Artists to minimal commercial success. However, he achieved mainstream success in 1990 with the release of the album &quot;Would It Be Possible&quot; which won Lau his first RTHK Top 10 Gold Songs Award. The following year, he released the single &quot;The Days We Spent Together&quot; which topped Hong Kong&#x27;s music charts and was an international hit across Asia. The song was lauded by &quot;Time Out&quot; which described its popularity as &#x27;practically a national anthem&#x27; and &#x27;one of the most notable hits&#x27; in Lau&#x27;s career. His subsequent albums brought him further recognition spawning hit singles such as &quot;Ice Rain&quot; (1993), &quot;Forget Love Potion&quot; (1994), and &quot;Stupid Fellow&quot; (1998). His popularity as a music artist was such that Lau was dubbed as one of the Cantopop Four Heavenly Kings along with Jacky Cheung, Aaron Kwok, and Leon Lai. His album &quot;Love Notes Written in Bone Upon My Heart&quot; (1997) is certified 2× Platinum in Taiwan and is one of the best-selling albums with 640,305 copies sold. His other albums &quot;Because of Love&quot; (1996) and &quot;Love is Mysterious&quot; (1997) also reached 2× Platinum status there.

At the Jade Solid Gold Top 10 Awards, he won the &quot;Most Popular Hong Kong Male Artist&quot; award 7 times and the &quot;Asia Pacific Most Popular Hong Kong Male Artist&quot; award 15 times. By April 2000, he had already won an unprecedented total of 292 awards. That same year, he entered the Guinness World Records for &quot;Most Awards Won by a Cantopop Male Artist&quot; and again in 2021 for &quot;Most Douyin Followers Gained in 24 hours&quot; and &quot;Fastest Time to Reach Ten Million Followers on Douyin&quot;.

At the 2008 Summer Olympics, Lau sang &quot;Please Stay, Guests From Afar&quot; alongside Jackie Chan and Emil Chau during its closing ceremony. In addition, Lau, who has been supporting disabled athletes in Hong Kong for more than a decade, was appointed as the Goodwill ambassador for the 2008 Summer Paralympics. He led other performers in singing and performing the song &quot;Everyone is No.1&quot;&quot;&quot; at the Beijing National Stadium before the 2008 Paralympics opening ceremony began. He also sang the theme song &quot;Flying with the Dream&quot; with Han Hong during the Paralympics opening ceremony on 6 September 2008.

In 2022, Lau set records when an online concert he held via Douyin attracted more than 350 million viewers.

In addition to singing in Cantonese and Mandarin, Lau has also sung in other languages such as English, Japanese and Taiwanese Hokkien. He has held concerts in Asia, North America, Europe, and Oceania, and continues to tour with an upcoming Mainland China leg set for Summer 2024.

In September 2024, Andy Lau almost fell through an open trapdoor during a concert in Shenzhen but quickly recovered, continuing the show without injury.

=== Books ===
Lau has written two books, &quot;This Is How I Grew Up&quot; () (1995), an autobiography, and &quot;My 30 Work Days&quot; (我的30個工作天) (2012), a collection of his 30 personal diaries written while working on the 2011 film, &quot;A Simple Life&quot;.

=== Art exhibition ===
In 2023, Lau opened his debut art show titled the &quot;1/X Andy Lau X Art Exhibition&quot;, which ran on 25 August at the Freespace venue located in the West Kowloon Cultural District. The exhibit includes a sculpture which Lau designed, a projection of images from his films and concerts, paintings made by him and his daughter, and works where he collaborated with other artists, such as collaborating with Hong Kong artists Sticky Line on a statue of his character from &quot;Running on Karma&quot;, collaborating with Beijing artist Xu Zhuoer in glass covered film props from &quot;A Moment of Romance&quot;, and a collaboration with ink painter where Lau showcases his calligraphy.

== Philanthropy ==
In 1994, Lau established the &quot;Andy Lau Charity Foundation&quot; which helps people in need and promotes a wide range of youth education services. In 1999, he received the &quot;Ten Outstanding Young Persons of the World&quot; award, being the third person from Hong Kong at that time to receive this distinguished honour. In 2008, Lau took a main role in putting together the Artistes 512 Fund Raising Campaign for relief toward the victims of the 2008 Sichuan earthquake.

== Personal life ==
Lau had two public relationships. In the fall of 1983, while filming &quot;Shanghai 13&quot; in Taiwan, Lau was introduced to actress Yu Ke-Hsin. The two began a relationship that lasted for three years. Following the example of Jackie Chan and Joan Lin, they signed a symbolic “marriage certificate” that held no legal validity in Taiwan. Their relationship ended when Carol Chu appeared, and eight years after their breakup, Lau started dating Chu. In 2005, Yu published a memoir in which she detailed her romance with Lau. She revealed that they had agreed to meet again ten years after their breakup and Lau honored the pact by visiting her home in Los Angeles, ringing the doorbell, and claiming that media reports about his relationship with Chu were untrue. This led to a brief rekindling of their relationship. Yu&#x27;s mother later alleged that all 5,000 copies of the memoir sold in Hong Kong were purchased in bulk to prevent them from reaching store shelves. The books were subsequently returned in full, causing a financial loss of HKD 500,000.

In 2008, Lau secretly married Carol Chu in Las Vegas and acknowledged his marriage the following year, ending decades of speculation over their relationship. Both Lau and Chu are vegetarians and Buddhists. On 9 May 2012, Chu gave birth to their daughter Hanna.

In January 2017, Lau sustained a serious pelvic injury after being thrown off and stomped on by a horse during a commercial shoot in Thailand. He made a full recovery by the end of the year.

== Awards and nominations ==

== Honors ==
Lau was noted for his highly positive energy, his hard work and active involvement in charity works throughout his 30 years in showbiz and honoured as a &quot;Justice of Peace&quot; by the Hong Kong SAR government in 2008. In May 2010, he received the &quot;World Outstanding Chinese&quot; award and an &quot;honorary doctorate&quot; from the University of New Brunswick, Canada. On 14 December 2017, Lau was awarded a Doctor of Letters degree from the Hong Kong Shue Yan University, with the citation highlighting his popularity among locals which stated: &quot;His low-key, modest, friendly and approachable personality has endeared him to millions of fans and ordinary folks alike, who also consider him to be a &#x27;heartthrob&#x27; and the &#x27;unofficial Chief Executive of Hong Kong&#x27;&quot;.

In 2018, asteroid 55381 Lautakwah, discovered by Bill Yeung at the Desert Eagle Observatory in 2001, was named for Lau. The asteroid measures approximately in diameter and is located in the outermost region of the asteroid belt, just inside the Hecuba gap. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 11 July 2018.

In 2023, Lau was presented with a Special Tribute award at 2023 Toronto International Film Festival.

<text>Marvin Pierce Bush (born October 22, 1956) is an American businessman. He is a son of former U.S. President George H. W. Bush and First Lady Barbara Bush and the brother of former U.S. President George W. Bush, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, the late Robin Bush, Neil Bush, and Dorothy Bush Koch.

==Biography==

===Early life===

Marvin Pierce Bush was born on October 22, 1956, in Midland, Texas, and was named after his maternal grandfather, Marvin Pierce. He attended Woodberry Forest School in Virginia, graduating in 1975. He went on to obtain a B.A. degree in English from the University of Virginia, where he became a member of the Delta Phi fraternity (St. Elmo Hall). He spent most summers and holidays at the Bush family estate.

===Career===
He worked as director of HCC Insurance Holdings. HCC, formerly Houston Casualty Company, is a publicly traded insurance company on the New York Stock Exchange. He appears in the 2008 award-winning documentary on Lee Atwater, &quot;Boogie Man: The Lee Atwater Story&quot;. He served on the board of directors for SECURACOM from 1993 to June 2000.

===Personal life===
He is married to Margaret Conway (&quot;née&quot; Molster; b. 1959). They have two adopted children: a daughter, Marshall Lloyd (b. 1984), and a son, Charles Walker (b. 1989).

==Politics==
In the 2016 presidential election, Bush endorsed Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson, over either Republican candidate Donald Trump or Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. He stated that Johnson and running mate Bill Weld were both two-term governors, who are &quot;fiscally conservative, and their essential message is &#x27;get bureaucracy off our backs&#x27;, which used to be a part of what the Republicans believed.&quot; He said that a list of controversies made Clinton untrustworthy, and cited Trump&#x27;s negativity.

Bush previously endorsed his brother Jeb Bush, who lost the Republican primary. His announcement was consistent with his family&#x27;s general opposition to Trump. In the Republican primaries, however, another Bush brother, Neil Bush, joined the Ted Cruz election campaign on the finance team.

<text>L-3 MPRI was a provider of private military contractor services with customers that included the U.S. Department of Defense, U.S. Department of State, U.S. Department of Justice, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, law enforcement agencies, foreign governments, government agencies, and commercial businesses.

L-3 MPRI was based in Alexandria, Virginia. L-3 MPRI&#x27;s President was retired US Army General Bantz J. Craddock. The CEO was Carl E. Vuono.

==History==
L-3 MPRI, now known as Engility Corporation, was incorporated in 1987 by eight former senior military leaders, including Carl E. Vuono, a former Army Chief of Staff, who joined the company in 1993. General William F. Kernan of the U.S. Army also joined the firm after his military service.

In June 2000, L-3 MPRI became a division of L-3 Communications Corporation, which specializes in various areas, including Command, Control, and Communications; Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C3ISR); government services; training and simulation; aircraft modernization and maintenance; and electronic systems. L-3 is also a major provider of homeland defense products and services.

As part of a spin-off, L-3 MPRI became part of the newly independent company, ENGILITY Corporation.

==Training==
MPRI began by almost exclusively employing retired U.S. military personnel.

It used retired military personnel and current U.S. National Guard or reservists to run Reserve Officer Training Corps programs at more than 200 universities. Other employees have worked in U.S. Army recruitment centers and trained U.S. soldiers. With offices in other countries, employees also have trained foreign armies at ranges in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Iraq, Kuwait, and South Africa. MPRI offered a range of services to its clients, drawing on expertise from various fields such as the military, law enforcement, analysis, disaster management, diplomacy, and the private sector.

In 1995, before Operation Storm, according to some sources, MPRI provided training and preparation to the Croatian Army prior to its offensive to retake the Krajina region. In April 1995, training for the Democracy Transition Assistance Program (DTAP) began at the &quot;Petar Zrinski&quot; military school in Zagreb. Deborah Avant discusses the controversy in her book &quot;The Market for Force: The Consequences of Privatizing Security&quot;. MPRI provided (along with a French Foreign Legion organized training camp in Šepurine near Zadar) mainly training for commissioned officers, but a 1999 study published in the journal of the U.S. Army War College concluded that the company had no significant intelligence activities or professional influence on senior Croatian military strategy and tactics. The U.S. government approved MPRI&#x27;s engagement.

Local forces in Croatia were referred to MPRI by the United States Department of Defense and used their training. 120 African leaders and more than 5,500 African troops have been trained on security issues by MPRI.
MPRI started training the Army of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina for $140 million after 1995, when the Dayton Accords were established. On the back of its success in Croatia, MPRI won the approximately $50 million ‘Train and Equip’ contract for the Bosnian Federation army, which ran from July 1996. The training contract was accompanied by an approximately $100 million arms transfer program. The contract began with restructuring the Ministry of Defense and claimed to create a combined logistics system between the initial separate Muslim and Croat armies. While the contractors claimed they had combined the logistics system, assessments made in the 2000s disagreed: ‘the force integration of the Federation army has been superficial and limited to some cooperation at the HQ level.’ The contract also included the development of training policy, assistance with unit training, and the establishment of a central combat training center, including a school at Hadzici and a field combat simulation center at Livno. While the facilities may have been constructed, whether the training and logistics system changes lasted is uncertain, given Maxwell’s assessment.

MPRI-trained security forces were used to defeat an attack on the presidential palace of Equatorial Guinea&#x27;s long-serving dictator Teodoro Obiang Nguema.

==Defense contracts==
In the early 1990s, MPRI signed a 5-year contract with the U.S. State Department involving the shipment of donated medical supplies and food to former Soviet states.

In 1998, the government of Equatorial Guinea asked MPRI to evaluate its defense systems, particularly its need for a coast guard to protect its oil reserves. To be eligible for the job, MPRI needed a license from the U.S. State Department. The Clinton administration rejected the request, citing the West African nation&#x27;s human rights record. In 2000, after lobbying by MPRI, the State Department issued the license. MPRI did not reveal the terms of its contract with Equatorial Guinea.

In 1999, MPRI signed an 18-month, $4.3 million contract to work with the military in Colombia on the drug war. The contract expired in March 2001 and was not renewed, allegedly because the Colombian Defense Ministry and its officers were upset by recommendations such as &quot;Hit the enemy with a closed fist; do not poke at him with the fingers of an open hand.&quot; (Note: This is a maxim of World War II German General Heinz Guderian.) 
According to a United States Department of Defense census, MPRI has at least 500 employees working in Iraq on 12 different contracts, including mentoring civilian workers at the Ministry of Defense.

MPRI, under a US Department of Defense contract, conducted training and advisory services for the Afghan National Army (ANA). Also supported in various areas are logistical and advisory services in regional areas of Afghanistan.

MPRI is a contractor for the US State Department&#x27;s Bureau of African Affairs and provides training in African countries, including Uganda, with an emphasis on pre-deployment training of UPDF en route to support African Union initiatives in Somalia.

==Lawsuit==
A group of Serbs who lived in Krajina until Operation Storm sued MPRI for their alleged participation in military activities, including militarily equipping the Croatian Armed Forces, training Croatian officers, and developing a plan for Operation Storm. The claim was presented to the Federal Court in Chicago, and the plaintiffs were asking for $10.4 billion in compensation.

On September 26, 2014, the lawsuit was rejected by Judge John Lee because the war in former Yugoslavia is not under the jurisdiction of this court.

<text>Jan Gustaf Troell (born 23 July 1931) is a Swedish writer-director and cinematographer. His realistic films, with a lyrical photography in which nature is prominent, have placed him in the first rank of modern Swedish film directors along with Ingmar Bergman and Bo Widerberg.

==Life and career==
Troell was born in Limhamn outside Malmö, Sweden. For several years, he worked as an elementary-school teacher but started to make short films in the sixties. In 1965 he co-produced the film &quot;4x4&quot; and it was entered into the 4th Moscow International Film Festival. He became director of photography for Widerberg but soon made a debut with his own first feature, &quot;Here&#x27;s Your Life&quot; (&quot;Här har du ditt liv&quot;, 1966), about a working class boy in Sweden, set in the beginning of the 20th century. The film was based upon an autobiographical novel by Eyvind Johnson. For the film he won the Guldbagge Award for Best Director at the 4th Guldbagge Awards. His next film &quot;Who Saw Him Die?&quot; (&quot;Ole dole doff&quot;, 1968) won the Golden Bear award at the 18th Berlin International Film Festival.

Troell&#x27;s major work in the 1970s became &quot;The Emigrants&quot; (&quot;Utvandrarna&quot;, 1971) and its sequel &quot;The New Land&quot; (&quot;Nybyggarna&quot;, 1972), two epic films about some peasants emigrating from the barren Swedish countryside to America in the 19th century. Once again, Troell films were based upon the novels of a Swedish working-class author, in this case Vilhelm Moberg&#x27;s famous Emigrants suite. As in many of Troell&#x27;s films, Max von Sydow plays one of the major roles. &quot;The Emigrants&quot; was nominated for several Academy Awards.

After a brief and unsuccessful sojourn in Hollywood, which resulted in the films &quot;Zandy&#x27;s Bride&quot; (1974), starring Gene Hackman, and &quot;Hurricane&quot; (1979), Troell made &quot;Flight of the Eagle&quot; (&quot;Ingenjör Andrées luftfärd&quot;, 1982). It is a film about S. A. Andrée&#x27;s disastrous Arctic balloon expedition of 1897. &quot;The Flight of the Eagle&quot; was nominated for the Academy Awards (foreign-language film).

The release of &quot;Il Capitano: A Swedish Requiem&quot; (&quot;Il Capitano&quot;, 1991) became controversial since the film is based upon a true story; the brutal murder of a Swedish family just a few years earlier (see Juha Valjakkala). Yet, it concentrates on the psychological power game between the murderer and his girlfriend rather than the violence of the crime. He was awarded with the Silver Bear for Best Director at the 42nd Berlin International Film Festival. It also won the award for Best Film at the 27th Guldbagge Awards.

Troell has also made documentaries, for instance &quot;Land of Dreams&quot; (&quot;Sagolandet&quot;, 1988), dealing with modern society&#x27;s alienation from nature and &quot;A Frozen Dream&quot; (&quot;En frusen dröm&quot;, 1997) in which he once again brings up Andrée&#x27;s polar expedition. Troell took part of an extensive poll by &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot;, where he revealed his favorite films to be &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;, &quot;Hugo&quot;, &quot;Modern Times&quot;, &quot;Hour of the Wolf&quot;, &quot;The Night of the Hunter&quot; and &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot;.

Despite his age (he is currently in his 80s), Troell has remained productive. His recent films include &quot;As White as in Snow&quot; (&quot;Så vit som en snö&quot;, 2001), based on the life of Swedish aviator Elsa Andersson; a documentary called &quot;Presence&quot; (&quot;Närvarande&quot;, 2003); &quot;Everlasting Moments&quot; (&quot;Maria Larssons eviga ögonblick&quot;, 2008), based on the life of Maria Larsson, a 20th-century, working class photographer; and his latest film, &quot;The Last Sentence&quot; (&quot;Dom över död man&quot;)., a biographical film about the Swedish publicist Torgny Segerstedt. &quot;The Last Sentence&quot; premiered in November 2012 at the Stockholm International Film Festival. At the same festival Troell was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award.

<doc id="310230" wikidata="Q1349158" url="?curid=310230" title="Paolo Sarpi">
<text>Paolo Sarpi, O.S.M. (14 August 1552 – 15 January 1623) was an Italian Servite friar and Catholic priest who was a notable historian, scientist, canon lawyer, polymath and statesman active on behalf of the Venetian Republic during the period of its successful defiance of the papal interdict (1605–1607) and its war (1615–1617) with Austria over the Uskok pirates. His writings, frankly polemical and highly critical of the Catholic Church and its Scholastic tradition, &quot;inspired both Hobbes and Edward Gibbon in their own historical debunkings of priestcraft.&quot; Sarpi&#x27;s major work, the &quot;History of the Council of Trent&quot; (1619), was published in London in 1619; other works: a &quot;History of Ecclesiastical Benefices&quot;, &quot;History of the Interdict&quot; and his &quot;Supplement to the History of the Uskoks&quot;, appeared posthumously. Organized around single topics, they are early examples of the genre of the historical monograph.

As a defender of the liberties of Republican Venice and proponent of the separation of Church and state, Sarpi attained fame as a hero of republicanism and free thought and possible crypto Protestant. His last words, &quot;Esto perpetua&quot; (&quot;may she [i.e., the republic] live forever&quot;), were recalled by John Adams in 1820 in a letter to Thomas Jefferson, when Adams &quot;wished &#x27;as devoutly as Father Paul for the preservation of our vast American empire and our free institutions&#x27;, as Sarpi had wished for the preservation of Venice and its institutions.&quot;

Sarpi was also an experimental scientist, a proponent of the Copernican system, a friend and patron of Galileo Galilei, and a keen follower of the latest research on anatomy, astronomy, and ballistics at the University of Padua. His extensive network of correspondents included Francis Bacon and William Harvey.

Sarpi believed that government institutions should rescind their censorship of the Avvisi—the newsletters that started to be common in his time—and instead of censorship, publish their own versions of the news to counter enemy publications. In that spirit, Sarpi himself published several pamphlets in defence of Venice&#x27;s rights over the Adriatic. As such, Sarpi could be considered as an early advocate of the freedom of the press, though the concept did not yet exist in his lifetime.

== Early years ==
He was born Pietro Sarpi in Venice on 14 August 1552. His father was a merchant, although not a successful one; his mother was a Venetian noblewoman. His father died while he was still a child. The brilliant and precocious boy was educated by his maternal uncle, a school teacher, and then by Giammaria Capella, a friar of the Servite Order. In 1566, at the age of thirteen, he also entered the Order, later being given the religious name of Fra (Brother) Paolo, by which, with the epithet Servita, he was always known to his contemporaries.

Sarpi was assigned to a monastery in Mantua around 1567. In 1570 he sustained theses at a disputation there, and was invited to remain as court theologian to Duke Guglielmo Gonzaga. Sarpi remained four years at Mantua, studying mathematics and oriental languages. He then went to Milan in 1575, where he was an adviser to Charles Borromeo, the saint and bishop but was transferred by his superiors to Venice, to serve as a professor of philosophy at the Servite monastery there. In 1579, he was elected as Prior Provincial of the Venetian Province of the Servite Order, while studying at the University of Padua. Simultaneously he was appointed to serve as the Procurator General for the Order. In this capacity, he was sent to Rome, where he interacted with three successive popes, the grand inquisitor, and other influential people.

Sarpi returned to Venice in 1588 and passed the next 17 years in study, occasionally interrupted by the internal disputes of his community. In 1601, he was recommended by the Venetian senate for the bishopric of Caorle, but the papal nuncio, who wished to obtain it for a protégé of his own, accused Sarpi of having denied the immortality of the soul and controverted the authority of Aristotle. An attempt to obtain another bishopric in the following year also failed, Pope Clement VIII having taken offence at Sarpi&#x27;s habit of corresponding with learned heretics.

== Venice in conflict with the Pope ==
Clement VIII died in March 1605, and the attitude of his successor Pope Paul V strained the limits of papal prerogative. Venice simultaneously adopted measures to restrict it: the right of the secular tribunals to take cognizance of the offences of ecclesiastics had been asserted in two leading cases and the scope of two ancient laws of the city, that were: one forbidding the foundation of new churches or ecclesiastical congregations without the consent of the state, the other forbidding acquisition of property by priests or religious bodies. These laws had been extended over the entire territory of the republic. In January 1606, the papal nuncio delivered a brief demanding the unconditional submission of the Venetians. The senate promised protection to all ecclesiastics who should in this emergency aid the republic by their counsel. Sarpi presented a memoir, pointing out that the threatened censures might be met in two ways – &quot;de facto&quot;, by prohibiting their publication, and &quot;de jure&quot;, by an appeal to a general council. The document was well received, and Sarpi was made canonist and theological counsellor to the republic.

The following April, hopes of compromise were dispelled by Paul&#x27;s excommunication of the Venetians and his attempt to lay their dominions under an interdict. Sarpi entered energetically into the controversy. It was unprecedented for an ecclesiastic of his eminence to argue the subjection of the clergy to the state. He began by republishing the anti-papal opinions of the canonist Jean Gerson (1363–1429). In an anonymous tract published shortly afterwards (&quot;Risposta di un Dottore in Teologia&quot;), he laid down principles which struck radically at papal authority in secular matters. This book was promptly included in the &quot;Index Librorum Prohibitorum&quot;, and Cardinal Bellarmine attacked Gerson&#x27;s work with severity. Sarpi then replied in an &quot;Apologia&quot;. The &quot;Considerazioni sulle censure&quot; and the &quot;Trattato dell&#x27; interdetto&quot;, the latter partly prepared under his direction by other theologians, soon followed. Numerous other pamphlets appeared, inspired or controlled by Sarpi, who had received the further appointment of censor of everything written at Venice in defence of the republic.

Following Sarpi&#x27;s advice, the Venetian clergy largely disregarded the interdict and discharged their functions as usual, the major exception being the Jesuits, who left and were simultaneously expelled officially. The Catholic powers France and Spain refused to be drawn into the quarrel and resorted to diplomacy. At length (April 1607), the mediation of King Henry IV of France arranged a compromise which salvaged the pope&#x27;s dignity but conceded the points at issue. The two priests were returned to Rome but with Venice reserving the right to try clergy in civil courts. The outcome proved not so much the defeat of papal pretensions as the recognition that interdicts and excommunication had lost their force. &quot;The Republic,&quot; said Sarpi, &quot;has given a shake to papal claims. For whoever heard till now of a papal interdict, published with all solemnity, ending in smoke?&quot;

==Assassination attempt==

The republic rewarded Sarpi with the distinction of State Counsellor in Jurisprudence and the liberty of access to the state archives. These honours exasperated his adversaries, particularly Pope Paul V. In September 1607, at the instigation of the pope and his Cardinal nephew Scipio Borghese, Fra Sarpi became the target of an assassination attempt. A defrocked friar and brigand by the name of Rotilio Orlandini, assisted by his two brothers-in-law, agreed to kill Sarpi for the sum of 8,000 crowns. However, Orlandini&#x27;s plot was discovered, and when the three assassins crossed from Papal into Venetian territory they were arrested and imprisoned.

On 5 October 1607, Sarpi was attacked by assassins and left for dead with three stiletto thrusts, but he recovered. His attackers found both refuge and a welcome reception in the papal territories (described by a contemporary as a &quot;triumphal march&quot;), and papal enthusiasm for the assassins cooled only after learning that Brother Sarpi was not dead after all. The leader of the assassins, Poma, declared that he had attempted the murder for religious reasons. Sarpi himself, when his surgeon commented on the ragged and inartistic character of the wounds, responded, &quot;Agnosco stylum Romanae Curiae&quot; (&quot;I recognize the style of the Roman Curia&quot;). Sarpi&#x27;s would-be assassins settled in Rome, and were eventually granted a pension by the viceroy of Naples, Pedro Téllez-Girón, 3rd Duke of Osuna.

==Later life==
The remainder of Sarpi&#x27;s life was spent peacefully in his cloister, though plots against him continued to be formed, and he occasionally spoke of taking refuge in England. When not engaged in preparing state papers, he devoted himself to scientific studies, and composed several works. He served the state to the last. The day before his death, he had dictated three replies to questions on affairs of the Venetian Republic, and his last words were &quot;Esto perpetua,&quot; or &quot;may she endure forever.&quot;

These words were adopted as the state motto of Idaho and appear on the back of the 2007 Idaho quarter, as well as being taken up by various other groups and bodies in different countries (see &quot;Esto perpetua&quot;).

== &quot;History of the Council of Trent&quot; ==
In 1619 his chief literary work, &quot;Istoria del Concilio Tridentino&quot; (History of the Council of Trent), was printed in London, published under the name of Pietro Soave Polano, an anagram of Paolo Sarpi Veneto (plus o). The editor, Marco Antonio de Dominis (later declared a manifest heretic by the Holy Inquisition), did some work on polishing the text. He has been accused of falsifying it, but a comparison with a manuscript corrected by Sarpi himself shows that the alterations are unimportant. Translations into other languages followed: there was the English translation by Nathaniel Brent and a Latin edition in 1620 made by Adam Newton, de Dominis, and William Bedell, and French and German editions.

Its emphasis was on the role of the Papal Curia, and its slant on the Curia hostile. This was unofficial history, rather than a commission, and treated ecclesiastical history as politics. Sarpi in Mantua had known Camillo Olivo, secretary to Cardinal Ercole Gonzaga. His attitude, &quot;bitterly realistic&quot; for John Hale, was coupled with a criticism that the Tridentine settlement was not conciliatory but designed for further conflict. Denys Hay calls it &quot;a kind of Anglican picture of the debates and decisions&quot;, and Sarpi was much read by Protestants; John Milton called him the &quot;great unmasker&quot;. His eulogy, however, issued more from antipapal and anticlerical attitudes than from true admiration for Sarpi&#x27;s style and acumen. Catholic scholars like Jacques-Benigne Bossuet considered Sarpi a worthless historian, a view largely shared by more recent historiography.

Sarpi&#x27;s work attained such fame that the Vatican opened its archives to Cardinal Francesco Sforza Pallavicino, whom it commissioned to write a three-volume rebuttal, entitled the &quot;Istoria del Concilio di Trento, scritta dal P. Sforza Pallavicino, della Comp. di Giesù ove insieme rifiutasi con auterevoli testimonianze un Istoria falsa divolgata nello stesso argomento sotto nome di Petro Soave Polano&quot; (&quot;The History of the Council of Trent written by P. Sforza Pallavicino, of the Company of Jesus, in which a false history upon the same argument put forth under the name of Petro Soave Polano is refuted by means of authoritative testimony&quot;, 1656–1657). The great nineteenth century historian Leopold von Ranke (&quot;History of the Popes&quot;), examined both Sarpi and Pallavicino&#x27;s treatments of manuscript materials and judged them both as falling short of his own strict standards of objectivity. The former is described as moved by deadly hatred – malignant in his purpose and reckless in his means – fabricating falsehoods and distorting or perverting truths; while the Jesuit, though scrupulously correct in the documents he exhibits, often suppresses those opposed to his views. Nevertheless, Ranke rated the quality of Sarpi&#x27;s work very highly, considering him superior to Guicciardini. Sarpi never acknowledged his authorship, and baffled all the efforts of Louis II de Bourbon, Prince de Condé to extract the secret from him.

Hubert Jedin&#x27;s multi-volume history of the Council of Trent (1961), also Vatican-authorized, likewise faults Sarpi&#x27;s use of sources. David Wootton believes, however, that there is evidence Sarpi may have used original documents that have not survived and he calls Sarpi&#x27;s treatment of Council quite careful despite its partisan framing.

==Other works==
In 1615, a dispute occurred between the Venetian government and the Inquisition over the prohibition of a book. In 1613 the Senate had asked Sarpi to write about the history and procedure of the Venetian Inquisition. He argued that this had been set up in 1289, but as a Venetian state institution. The pope of the time, Nicholas IV, had merely consented to its creation. This work appeared in English translation by Robert Gentilis in 1639.

A Machiavellian tract on the fundamental maxims of Venetian policy (&quot;Opinione come debba governarsi la repubblica di Venezia&quot;) has been attributed to Sarpi and used by some of his posthumous adversaries to blacken his memory, but it in fact dates from 1681. He did not complete a reply which he had been ordered to prepare to the &quot;Squitinio della libertà veneta&quot; (1612, attributed to Alfonso de la Cueva), which he perhaps found unanswerable. In folio appeared his &quot;History of Ecclesiastical Benefices&quot;, in which, said Matteo Ricci, &quot;he purged the church of the defilement introduced by spurious decretals.&quot; It appeared in English translation in 1736 with a biography by John Lockman. In 1611, he attacked misuse of the right of asylum claimed for churches, in a work that was immediately placed on the Index.

His posthumous &quot;History of the Interdict&quot; was printed at Venice the year after his death, with the disguised imprint of Lyon. Sarpi&#x27;s memoirs on state affairs remained in the Venetian archives. Consul Smith&#x27;s collection of tracts in the Interdict controversy went to the British Museum. Francesco Griselini&#x27;s &quot;Memorie e aneddote&quot; (1760) was based on Sarpi&#x27;s unpublished writings, later destroyed by book burning.

==Correspondence networks and published letters==
Sarpi was the centre of a vast political and scholarly network of eminent correspondents, from which about 430 of his letters have survived. Early letter collections were: &quot;Lettere Italiane di Fra Sarpi&quot; (Geneva, 1673); &quot;Scelte lettere inedite de P. Sarpi&quot;, edited by Aurelio Bianchi-Giovini (Capolago, 1833); &quot;Lettere raccolte di Sarpi&quot;, edited by Polidori (Florence, 1863); &quot;Lettere inedite di Sarpi a S. Contarini&quot;, edited by Castellani (Venice, 1892).

Some hitherto unpublished letters of Sarpi were edited by Karl Benrath and published, under the title &quot;Paolo Sarpi. Neue Briefe&quot;, 1608–1610 (at Leipzig in 1909).

A modern edition (1961) &quot;Lettere ai Gallicani&quot; has been published of his hundreds of letters to French correspondents. These are mainly to jurists: Jacques Auguste de Thou, Jacques Lechassier, Jacques Gillot. Another correspondent was William Cavendish, 2nd Earl of Devonshire; English translations by Thomas Hobbes of 45 letters to the Earl were published (Hobbes acted as the Earl&#x27;s secretary), and it is now thought that these are jointly from Sarpi (when alive) and his close friend Fulgenzio Micanzio, something concealed at the time as a matter of prudence. Micanzio was also in touch with Dudley Carleton, 1st Viscount Dorchester. Giusto Fontanini&#x27;s &quot;Storia arcana della vita di Pietro Sarpi&quot; (1863), a bitter libel, is important for the letters of Sarpi it contains.

==Views==
Sarpi read and was influenced by the skepticism of Michel de Montaigne and his disciple Pierre Charron. As a historian and thinker in the realist tradition of Tacitus, Machiavelli, and Guicciardini, he stressed that patriotism as national pride or honour could play a central role in social control. At various times during his lifetime he was suspected of a lack of orthodoxy in religion: he appeared before the Inquisition around 1575, in 1594, and in 1607.

Sarpi hoped for toleration of Protestant worship in Venice and the establishment of a Venetian free church by which the decrees of the Council of Trent would have been rejected. Sarpi discusses his intimate beliefs and motives in his correspondence with Christoph von Dohna, envoy to Venice for Christian I, Prince of Anhalt-Bernburg. Sarpi told Dohna that he greatly disliked saying Mass and celebrated it as seldom as possible, but that he was compelled to do so, as he would otherwise seem to admit the validity of the papal prohibition. Sarpi&#x27;s maxim was that &quot;God does not regard externals so long as the mind and heart are right before Him.&quot; Another maxim Sarpi formulated to Dohna was &quot;Le falsità non dico mai mai, ma la verità non a ognuno&quot; (&quot;I never, never tell falsehoods, but the truth I do not tell to everyone.&quot;).

Sarpi at the end of his life wrote to Daniel Heinsius that he favoured the side of the Calvinist Contra-Remonstrants at the Synod of Dort. Yet although Sarpi corresponded with James I of England and admired the English &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;, Catholic theologian Le Courayer in the 18th century wrote that Sarpi was no Protestant, terming him &quot;Catholique en gros et quelque fois Protestant en détail&quot; (&quot;Catholic in general and sometimes Protestant in detail&quot;). In the twentieth century, William James Bouwsma found Sarpi to have been a philo-Protestant whose religious ideas were nevertheless &quot;consistent with Catholic orthodoxy,&quot; and Eric Cochrane described him as deeply religious in the typical spirit of the Counter-Reformation. Corrado Vivanti saw Sarpi as a religious reformer who aspired toward an ecumenical church, and historian Diarmaid MacCulloch describes Sarpi as having moved away from dogmatic Christianity. On the other hand, in 1983 David Wootton made a case for Sarpi as a scientific materialist and thus as likely a &quot;veiled&quot; atheist who was &quot;hostile to Christianity itself&quot; and whose politics looked forward to a secular society unrealizable in his own time, a thesis that has won some acceptance. Jaska Kainulainen, on the other hand, asserts that the thesis that Sarpi was an atheist contradicts the historical record, observing that neither Sarpi&#x27;s pronounced skepticism nor his pessimistic view of capabilities are incompatible with religious faith:
Sarpi’s writings do not support the claim that he was an atheist. In fact, from an atheistic point of view, systematic skepticism can be seen as providing support of religious belief, because atheists&#x27; position postulates certain knowledge of God&#x27;s inexistence. ...In his case the fundamental question was not the existence of God, but whether knowledge of God was obtainable by reason or by faith. His response was unequivocal: he was convinced that knowledge of divine matters was attained sola fide and he explicitly claimed that in religious matters one could not make judgments based on reason, but instead, they had to be based on affection or feeling

==Scientific scholar==
Sarpi wrote notes on François Viète which established his proficiency in mathematics, and a metaphysical treatise now lost, which is said to have anticipated the ideas of John Locke. His anatomical pursuits probably date from an earlier period. They illustrate his versatility and thirst for knowledge, but are otherwise not significant. His claim to have anticipated William Harvey&#x27;s discovery rests on no better authority than a memorandum, probably copied from Andreas Caesalpinus or Harvey himself, with whom, as well as with Francis Bacon and William Gilbert, Sarpi corresponded. The only physiological discovery which can be safely attributed to him is that of the contractility of the iris.

Sarpi wrote on projectile motion in the period 1578–84, in the tradition of Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia; and then again in reporting on Guidobaldo del Monte&#x27;s ideas in 1592, possibly by then having met Galileo Galilei. Galileo corresponded with him. Sarpi heard of the telescope in November 1608, perhaps before Galileo. Details then came to Sarpi from Giacomo Badoer in Paris, in a letter describing the configuration of lenses. In 1609, the Venetian Republic had a telescope on approval for military purposes, but Sarpi had them turn it down, anticipating the better model Galileo had made and brought later that year.

Sarpi&#x27;s life was first recounted in a laudatory memorial tribute by his secretary and successor, Fulgenzio Micanzio and much of our information about him comes from this. Several biographies dating from the nineteenth century include that by Arabella Georgina Campbell (1869), with references to manuscripts, Pietro Balan&#x27;s &quot;Fra Paolo Sarpi&quot; (Venice, 1887), and Alessandro Pascolato, &quot;Fra Paolo Sarpi&quot; (Milan, 1893). The late William James Bouwsma&#x27;s &quot;Venice and the Defense of Republican Liberty: Renaissance Values in the Age of the Counter-Reformation&quot; ([1968] Yale University Press; re-issued by the University of California Press, 1984) arose initially from Bouwsma&#x27;s interest in Sarpi. Its central chapters concern Sarpi&#x27;s life and works, including a lengthy analysis of the style and content of his &quot;History of the Council of Trent&quot;. Bouwsma&#x27;s final publication, &quot;The Waning of the Renaissance, 1550-1640&quot; (Yale University Press, 2002) also deals extensively with Sarpi.

<text>Television broadcasting in Greece began in 1966, preceded in 1951 by statute 1963 permitting television broadcasting.

==History==
===First broadcasts===
The first television broadcast in Greece became a reality during the 25th Thessaloniki International Fair (3 September 1960). The Studios were organized by the Public Power Corporation (ΔΕΗ) pavilion, supplied by Philips, along with other locally improvised equipment. Some years later, a small privately-owned television station started operating round the year from another pavilion in the same fair. This station operated until 1968 when the two new government channels started operation in Thessaloniki and requested the elimination of the &quot;illegal&quot; television station.

The two government channels, which held a television monopoly, during that period were ERT and YENED (for the military forces).

===A third state TV channel, its closure and color TV in Greece===
After the construction of the OTE Tower in the Thessaloniki Fair area, OTE started a third state TV channel in the SECAM color format. The two initial state channels requested the closing and elimination of the new OTE channel, fearing that OTE would drive them to close, because of the superiority of the color picture, the telecommunications network and the technical superiority of OTE. They succeeded and all the equipment, that OTE already had, passed to YENED, which started what now became ERT3, still broadcasting from Thessaloniki to this day. During the Greek military government period of 1967–74, the programs were a mixture of news and entertainment. A notable serial which still owns the watching record was the war drama &quot;O Agnostos Polemos&quot; (The Unknown War).

After the restoration of the Republic in 1974, the Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation continue to dominate, appealing to a much larger audience than YENED. Color television broadcasts began in the late 1970s and notable people were placed to improve the quality of the national channels, such as Dimitris Horn, Manos Hatzidakis and the Nobel laureate poet Odysseas Elytis. Color television was officially introduced in 1979, using the French SECAM system. ERT would later merge with YENED in 1982.

===The merger of ERT and YENED===
In 1982, ERT and YENED merged, forming &quot;ERT&quot; (Ellinikí Radiofonía Tileórasi), with ERT becoming &quot;ERT1&quot; and YENED becoming &quot;ERT2&quot;. Broadcasts originally lasted for seven to eight hours daily starting at about 5:30PM with children shows and then the first televised news of the day. In 1987 an experimental teletext type information screen known as &quot;Tilegrafos&quot; (meaning televised words, i.e. telegraph) showed written information on ET2 during the afternoon. By the late 1980s, television broadcasts on ET1 and ET2 (still commonly known as ERT-1 and ERT-2 until later years) had increased to 12–15 hours daily, though it was still common for one or both stations to sign off briefly in the afternoon and sign back on in the early evening hours.

===Illegal broadcasts, disputes between the government and Thessaloniki, constant frequency changes, and challenges to ERT&#x27;s monopoly===
Some illegal broadcasts made short-lived appearances during the 1980s showing mainly movies of adult nature but, in 1987, the City of Thessaloniki began rebroadcasting in a television frequency parts of European satellite channels, leading to a dispute between the government and the city, as the station&#x27;s equipment was confiscated numerous times. The more serious challenge to ERT&#x27;s monopoly, however, appeared with the establishment and operation of TV Plus in the Piraeus area, which began broadcasting major American films to the starved-for-diversity people of Athens. It is then that ERT decided to preempt the challenge to its monopoly and any further attempts to put private broadcasts on the air, by re-broadcasting itself foreign satellite channels. In October 1988, the first of these satellite channels made it to the airwaves in Athens to block the frequency used by TV Plus, and as this popular television station kept changing its frequency, more and more satellite channels were added by ERT to block the frequencies used by TV Plus. They included: Super Channel from the United Kingdom, TV5 from France, Sat.1 from Germany, Rai 2 from Italy, and Soviet Central Television from the Soviet Union via the Gorizont satellite. These channel were soon followed by MTV Europe and Sky Channel from the United Kingdom, while the broadcasts of Super Channel was taken over by TV Plus, due to the lack of an actual agreement with ERT. Sky Channel eventually morphed into what is now known as Eurosport, which is still rebroadcast in Greece, and Euronews, Rai 1 and Cyprus SAT were eventually added to the lineup. For a short time, NBC Europe was also rebroadcast, as were RTL Plus and 3sat from Germany.

===Establishment of regional channels===
In 1988, ERT also established ET3 a regional state-owned network which focused on issues of Northern Greece, to counter the Athens-centric broadcasts of the other two major state broadcasters at the time. Initially a regional network based in Thessaloniki, ET3 also began broadcasting in Athens, and within a few years, in most other regions of the country.

===The end of the state-owned monopoly on television===
Thessaloniki was the home of Greece&#x27;s first non-state owned television station, TV100, owned by the City of Thessaloniki, and TV Plus was the first non-state television station in the Athens region. TV Plus, was owned by Invest Plus SA, a US group headed by Daniel Bourla, with the participation of the Municipality of Piraeus, and its programming was quite innovative for Greek standards at the time, as it broadcast first-run Hollywood feature films with subtitles and no commercials. Soon, TV Plus began to offer an over-the-air subscription service, broadcasting an encoded signal 24-hours a day, which viewers could watch by obtaining a decoder (provided for free by the station) and paying a monthly subscription fee. This was especially revolutionary at the time, as a legal framework for private broadcasting, and private broadcasters, still did not exist in the country.

ERT did not take too kindly to the new television stations which began to crop up on the dial following the governments unsuccessful attempts to stop TV Plus, often changing the frequencies of its own stations around or adding repeaters, to interfere with new private broadcasts. However, in 1989, the Greek Parliament finally passed legislation legalizing private broadcasting (radio and television) and providing provisional licenses to two broadcasters, Mega Channel and Nea Tileorasi (New Television). Mega Channel began officially broadcasting in November 1989 as a national network, while Nea Tileorasi, after several months of broadcasting test bars, disappeared from the airwaves.

Other private broadcasters took advantage of loopholes in the existing legislation and the lack of an organized licensing process to begin broadcasting almost overnight. In December 1989, Antenna TV began broadcasting nationally, named after the successful new radio station by the same name. Mega and Antenna featured similar programming styles, with locally produced comedies and dramas, numerous variety shows (following in the Italian tradition), American films, and tabloid news broadcasts. They immediately won over most of ERT&#x27;s audience and advertising share, and to this day, are interchangeably the #1 and #2 stations in the audience ratings in Greece, while the ratings of ET1, ET2, and ET3 plummeted (they have recovered significantly since then but still do not challenge the major private networks).

=== Growth of privately-owned broadcasters ===
By early 1990, numerous other stations also appeared on the air, including &quot;New Channel&quot; (no relation to Nea Tileorasi) with movies, music videos and talk shows, &quot;Channel Seven-X&quot; (with avant-garde programming including foreign films, intellectual programming and a simulcast of French music TV network MCM), &quot;Jeronimo Groovy TV&quot; (initially a popular music video station that broadcast in Athens, amidst serious interference from other stations), &quot;TeleCity&quot; (a right-wing political station with news and talk shows), 902 TV (owned by the Communist Party of Greece), &quot;Kanali 29&quot; (a television station with political and cultural programs and a cult following), and a plethora of other broadcasters, which filled every available VHF and UHF frequency, often broadcasting only for several weeks or months, or with very little programming of note. Many broadcasters even began to broadcast on the same frequencies as other stations, especially ERT&#x27;s satellite broadcasts, many of which soon completely disappeared from the airwaves, as ERT seemed unwilling or unable to protect its frequencies. Similarly, private stations sprung up throughout the country, in every city and region and most towns.

===SECAM to PAL switchover===
The color television transmission system SECAM which had been used since the late 1970s finally switched over to the PAL color system widely used in the rest of Europe. PAL was the system used for years in Greece via video tape playbacks on rented movies from video stores but not by ERT. The first station to broadcast in PAL was TV Plus. Many other privately-owned stations also followed suit and eventually by ERT.

===Continued growth of privately-owned broadcasters and specialty TV, and mergers and acquisitions===
In 1993, two new major players entered the market. Skai TV began broadcasting, after a prolonged battle for open frequencies with ERT and other stations, and soon began to broadcast as a new national network following in the footsteps of the highly rated Skai radio station in Athens. Also in 1993, Kanali 29&#x27;s management was handed over to Niko Mastorakis, who was once again involved in Greek media after a long stint as a movie producer and director in the United States. Kanali 29 was renamed Star Channel, and featured programming rich in American films and TV series, and talk and lifestyle programmes. Star also began to broadcast nationally.

The following year, ERT decommissioned many of its terrestrial satellite broadcasts, and reassigned many of those now-vacant frequencies to Multichoice Hellas, for terrestrial pay services a year after TV Plus went off the air following a dispute with Time Warner that had acquired a 25% interest in the company. The name of this new pay-TV service was Filmnet. In 1995, Multichoice followed with another station, Supersport, which soon earned the broadcast rights to many Greek sports.

In 1997, ERT, whose audience had never recovered from the advent of private television, and which up until then lagged behind technologically compared to the largest private networks, revamped its operations, unveiling new logos and a new programming philosophy. The stations were modernized, and ET2 was renamed &quot;NET&quot; (Nea Elliniki Tileorassi). ET1 focused on general-interest programming (movies, sports, various TV series), while NET focused heavily on news and talk programming. ET3 continued to focus largely on Northern Greece, with a large dose of cultural programming.

By the late 1990s, Greece began to see its first major mergers and acquisitions (some of them ill-fated) in the realm of broadcast media. Skai TV was sold, and soon became known as &quot;Alpha-Sky&quot; before completely phasing into its current name as Alpha. Kanali 5, a regional television network broadcasting out of Athens, by the former owners of Kanali 29 (and with similar programming to that station), was also revamped, transitioning to &quot;Alter 5&quot; (with a program aimed largely at teenagers and young adults) before fully renaming itself to Alter. Its broadcast reach also gradually expanded, and the station now covers almost the entire country. Channel Seven-X, facing financial difficulties, was also sold, and was renamed &quot;Seven&quot;, featuring programming heavy on sports and news/talk programs. Seven never quite achieved the success of some of the other stations, as it continued to face financial difficulties even after the sale, and never was able to broadcast outside of certain large cities in the country. New Channel, which broadcast in many major cities but did not offer much original programming, was sold to a new investor and renamed &quot;New Tempo&quot; and finally &quot;Tempo TV&quot;, building up a national network of repeaters in an effort to become a major player in the television market, which it partially succeeded in, before financial troubles led to its failure in 2001. Finally, Makedonia TV, a regional private network broadcasting out of Thessaloniki, was purchased by the Antenna Group, and has served as a secondary network featuring many old programs from Antenna TV, American TV series, and a newscast focusing on Northern Greece. The station now also broadcasts nationally.

Specialty networks had also began to form. In 1992, TVC, Greece&#x27;s first 24h music channel, began operating in Lesvos island. The channel during the 2000s reformed into the pan-European Music Force Europe, available in 3 countries. Then, in 1996, Mad TV began operating out of Athens, replacing a small local channel known as &quot;Art 68&quot;. Mad TV featured programming heavy on hit music clips, similar to MTV and its Greek predecessor Jeronimo Groovy TV (which continued to exist but with a small coverage area and with programming more heavily dependent on talk); both channels, in opposition to TVC, operated in a few-hour rotation. Mad TV did not build a national network of its own, but instead was rebroadcast through local stations throughout the country. TV 0-6 began broadcasting in Athens, with many cartoons and children&#x27;s shows, while TV Magic, after an ill-fated attempt to become a news-talk station owned by Sokratis Kokkalis, became a station focusing on sports and particularly of Greek sports club Olympiacos, which Kokkalis also owned. Extra Channel was founded in 2000 with a heavy talk focus, and is now known as Extra 3.

In 1999, Multichoice Hellas also formed Nova, Greece&#x27;s first satellite television subscription service, which initially featured most (but not all) of Greece&#x27;s major networks, as well as many international networks, and other music and interactive services, which it has continued to expand since then. Nova was to be followed by a competing satellite platform, known as &quot;Magna&quot;, by the owners of &quot;Seven&quot;, which never began operations.

===Satellite television, failed ventures and the investment and creation of new ventures===
In 2000, Alpha TV founded &quot;Alpha Digital&quot;, which broadcast Alpha TV, Polis TV (a local station serving Athens owned by Alpha) various thematic stations also operated by Alpha, the radio stations owned by the Alpha group, and a small variety of foreign television networks, headlined by MTV and VH1 (MTV, by that time, was no longer rebroadcast terrestrially in Greece, that ceased in 1999). Despite the popularity of MTV and VH1 and Alpha earning the rights to Greek soccer matches, the company soon went under, leaving Nova as the only company providing pay-TV services in Greece to this day. Plans for a satellite bouquet managed by OTE (the Greek telecommunications company) never went past the test phase, with OTE leasing frequencies on the Hot Bird satellite, rebroadcasting several smaller Greek TV stations as well as many radio stations free-to-air.

The past few years had seen the failure of many television ventures, but the creation and investment in many new ones. Polis TV was relaunched as &quot;Channel 9&quot; in December 2005, with programming heavy on news and talk shows. More recently, the original owners of Skai TV returned to the television business, relaunching Skai on the frequencies of &quot;Seven TV&quot;. Other notable stations that have begun operating in recent years include &quot;Channel 10&quot;, while TeleCity was renamed Tileasty. Other stations had upgraded and modernized, however, the Greek airwaves are still cluttered with many unlicensed television stations, often broadcasting low quality programs (infomercials, low budget movies, music videos, illegal telephone hotlines, soft pornography).

===Status of broadcast licenses and the quasi-legal status===
To this day, the Greek government still has not issued official licenses to most television stations in Greece, which are currently broadcasting in a quasi-legal state. Tenders have been offered for national, regional and local broadcasters as well as terrestrial pay-TV services, which have either been frozen or have failed completely. Despite numerous government pledges, there has not been much movement on this issue in recent years. In the meantime, the airwaves are still cluttered, though things are significantly more organized than they were in the early 1990s. Despite the success of Nova, and the launch of Hellas Sat, cable television has been slow to follow, only existing on a local level in some communities around Greece until recently, when companies such as OnTelecoms have launched cable (IPTV) platforms.

===Greek debt crisis, budget cuts, and the closure of private broadcasters===
By the early 2010s, most Greek television stations suffered the consequences of the country&#x27;s debt crisis. In this decade two major Panhellenic stations ceased operations due to economic difficulties. Alter stopped its operation on 10 February 2012, after a history of more than 20 years.

Most channels cut their budget by decreasing their original programming (mostly their original series). Except for the high number of reruns, networks started airing a lot of foreign programs, the majority of them being Turkish dramas.

===The beginning of HD broadcasting and the closure of ERT===
On 27 April 2011, the first transmission of a high definition free-to-air channel was made by the state-owned ERT HD.

Two years later, on 11 June 2013, the Greek Government suspended the operations of the Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation (ERT) and automatically fired 2,656 employees, in one of the numerous spending cuts that had been implemented during Greek government-debt crisis. The plug was pulled at 23:10 during the news. On 11 June 2015, the new Government (made up of SYRIZA &amp; ANEL parties) reinstated the operations of ERT by hiring back the personnel and broadcasting the three ERT channels ERT1, ERT2, ERT3.

===The selling of 902 TV===
On late 2013, 902 TV, owned by the Communist Party, was sold to a Cypriot-based company A-Orizon Media Ltd. On 11 September, of the same year, the channel was renamed to Epsilon TV. After four years, the network once again sold, this time to Ivan Savides&#x27; company Dimera Media Investments Limited. On 24 August 2018, Epsilon TV was replaced by OPEN BEYOND.&lt;ref name=&quot;News24/7&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===The continuation of HD broadcasting and the closure of Mega===
Since early 2016, most Panhellenic networks began pilot high definition transmissions to a limited number of cities. 

By the end of the season, the channel Mega, the oldest privately owned national television station, stopped all live broadcasts, after a worker strike, due to its workers being unpaid for several months. The network continued broadcasting only reruns of old shows for more than two years, however, its ratings didn&#x27;t hit the bottom. The network was forced to stop its transmission on 28 October 2018, at 02:08 am, after almost 3 decades from its launch. Viewers paid a tribute to the network at its final hours. Mega achieved a share of 17,5% (22,5% on 15–44 age group), one of the highest rating stations in the country at the time. By the end of 2019, Vaggelis Marinakis purchased the network&#x27;s archives (programs, shows and footage) and logo.

===Rebranding of ERT HD===
On 9 February 2019, ERT renamed its HD channel into ERT Sports HD. Now its programs are aimed at sports.

===Current networks===
By the end of the decade, Greece had five national state-owned networks, four state-owned national digital television networks, a state-owned satellite broadcast network, and several national private television networks, in addition to approximately 150 local and regional television stations broadcasting across the country. Audience ratings were handled by AGB Hellas. The private networks were six, Ant1 (after Mega&#x27;s closure the oldest), Alpha, Skai TV, Star Channel and OPEN BEYOND, operating from the Attica region and Makedonia TV operating from Thessaloniki.

===The reopening of Mega===
The 2020s show the reopening of the Mega Channel. After Vaggelis Marinakis&#x27; purchase of the channel&#x27;s archive, he managed to relaunch Mega, under the same name and with a similar format (a combination of news programs, movies and Mega&#x27;s old Greek TV shows). The network resumed broadcasting on 17 February 2020.

==Digital terrestrial television==
In 2005, Alpha TV briefly ran experimental broadcasts in DVB-T locally in Athens, while in Heraklion, Crete, a regional network, CreteTV, in conjunction with the University of Crete, also started digital broadcasts.

In January 2006, the state broadcaster ERT launched free-to-air digital terrestrial television (DVB-T) channels with three &quot;pilot&quot; channels called Prisma+, Cine+ and Sport+, collectively branded as ERT Digital. The first channel, was targeted at disabled persons, while Cine+ broadcasts movies, and Sport+ broadcasts a sports program. A fourth channel, the Cypriot national channel&#x27;s satellite program RIK sat, was also retransmitted on digital.

In September 2009, the seven major television stations in Greece started broadcasting in DVB-T MPEG-4, via a company set up by them, Digea. The digital television transition was completed in February 2015 and a total of 156 digital transmitting centres are currently active throughout the country, broadcasting nationwide and regional channels and covering over 96% of the country&#x27;s population.

==Cable television==
The first cable television operator in Greece is located at Kalamaria in Thessaloniki. Hellenic Cable Networks (www.hcn.gr) among cable internet services offers digital video broadcasting - cable and analog TV services without the need of an external STB.

==IPTV==
In 2006, two companies began offering television service via IPTV, namely Vivodi Telecom and On Telecoms. Both of these went out of business.

They offered television service bundled with High-speed Internet &amp; Telephony services. Their channel offerings included local Greek networks, international stations and pay-TV networks Nova Cinema &amp; Nova Sports, that were made available to subscribers via an agreement with Greek DTH provider NOVA.

In 2009, Greek Telecommunications giant OTE launched IPTV service called &quot;Conn-x TV&quot; which was initially available in Athens, Thessaloniki, Patras, Larisa and Iraklion. Greek broadband provider Hellas Online also launched an IPTV platform called &quot;hol tv&quot; (now Vodafone TV). Vodafone TV offers all major Greek TV networks as well as news, sports, music and children&#x27;s channels. It is also the first provider in Greece to offer HDTV as well as Video on demand.

<text>Battery is a criminal offense involving unlawful physical contact, distinct from assault, which is the act of creating reasonable fear or apprehension of such contact.

Battery is a specific common law offense, although the term is used more generally to refer to any unlawful offensive physical contact with another person. Battery is defined by American common law as &quot;any unlawful and/or unwanted touching of the person of another by the aggressor, or by a substance put in motion by them&quot;. In more severe cases, and for all types in some jurisdictions, it is chiefly defined by statutory wording. Assessment of the severity of a battery is determined by local law.

== Generally ==
Specific rules regarding battery vary among different jurisdictions, but some elements remain constant across jurisdictions. Battery generally requires that:

# an offensive touch or contact is made upon the victim, instigated by the actor; and
# the actor intends or knows that their action will cause the offensive touching.

Under the US Model Penal Code and in some jurisdictions, there is battery when the actor acts recklessly without specific intent of causing an offensive contact. Battery is typically classified as either simple or aggravated. Although battery typically occurs in the context of physical altercations, it may also occur under other circumstances, such as in medical cases where a doctor performs a non-consented medical procedure.

== Specific countries ==
=== Canada ===

Battery is not defined in the Canadian &quot;Criminal Code&quot;. Instead, the Code has an offense of assault, and assault causing bodily harm.

=== England and Wales ===
Battery is a common law offence within England and Wales.

As with the majority of offences in the UK, it has two elements:
* Actus reus: The defendant unlawfully touched or applied force to the victim
* Mens rea: The defendant intended or was reckless as to the unlawful touch or application of force

This offence is a crime against autonomy, with more violent crimes such as ABH and GBH being statutory offences under the Offences against the Person Act 1861.

As such, even the slightest of touches can amount to an unlawful application of force. However, it is assumed that everyday encounters (such as making contact with others on public transportation) are consented to and not punishable.

Much confusion can come between the terms &quot;assault&quot; and &quot;battery&quot;. In everyday use the term assault may be used to describe a physical attack, which is indeed a battery. An assault is causing someone to apprehend that they will be the victim of a battery. This issue is so prevalent that the crime of sexual assault would be better labelled a sexual battery. This confusion stems from the fact that both assault and battery can be referred to as common assault. In practice, if charged with such an offence, the wording will read &quot;assault by beating&quot;, but this means the same as &quot;battery&quot;.

There is no separate offence for a battery relating to domestic violence; however, the introduction of the crime of &quot;controlling or coercive behaviour in an intimate or family relationship&quot; in section 76 of the Serious Crime Act 2015 has given rise to new sentencing guidelines that take into account significant aggravating factors such as abuse of trust, resulting in potentially longer sentences for acts of battery within the context of domestic violence.

==== Whether it is a statutory offence ====

In &quot;DPP v Taylor, DPP v Little&quot;, it was held that battery is a statutory offence, contrary to section 39 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988. This decision was criticised in &quot;Haystead v DPP&quot; where the Divisional court expressed the &quot;obiter&quot; opinion that battery remains a common law offence.

Therefore, whilst it may be a better view that battery and assault have statutory penalties, rather than being statutory offences, it is still the case that until review by a higher court, &quot;DPP v Little&quot; is the preferred authority.

==== Mode of trial and sentence ====

In England and Wales, battery is a summary offence under section 39 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988. However, by virtue of section 40, it can be tried on indictment where another indictable offence is also charged which is founded on the same facts or together with which it forms part of a series of offences of similar character. Where it is tried on indictment a Crown Court has no greater powers of sentencing than a magistrates&#x27; court would, unless the battery itself constitutes actual bodily harm or greater.

It is punishable with imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or a fine not exceeding level 5 on the standard scale, or both.

==== Defences ====

There are numerous defences to a charge of assault, namely

* Intoxication due to drugs/alcohol - voluntary or involuntary (does not apply to offences which may be committed recklessly, intentionally or with negligence i.e. assault/battery)
* Defence of self or others or others
* Prevention of crime
* Mistake
* Duress
* Necessity
* Insanity
* Automatism
* Provocation
* Alibi
* Diminished responsibility
* Consent (does not apply when the assault/battery results in ABH or greater)
* Superior orders
* Reasonable chastisement of a child
* Medical procedure
* Sporting activities
* Arrest by Constable
* Arrest by citizen

For provocation, see Tuberville v Savage.

=== Russia ===
There is an offence which could be (loosely) described as battery in Russia. Article 116 of the Russian Criminal Code provides that battery or similar violent actions which cause pain are an offence.

=== Scotland ===
There is no distinct offence of battery in Scotland. The offence of assault includes acts that could be described as battery.

=== United States ===

In the United States, criminal battery, or simple battery, is the use of force against another, resulting in harmful or offensive contact, including sexual contact. At common law, simple battery is a misdemeanor. The prosecutor must prove all three elements beyond a reasonable doubt:

# an unlawful application of force
# to the person of another
# resulting in either bodily injury or offensive touching.

The common-law elements serve as a basic template, but individual jurisdictions may alter them, and they may vary slightly from state to state.

Under modern statutory schemes, battery is often divided into grades that determine the severity of punishment. For example:
* Simple battery may include &quot;any&quot; form of non-consensual harmful or insulting contact, regardless of the injury caused. Criminal battery requires &quot;intent&quot; to inflict an injury on another.
* Sexual battery may be defined as non-consensual touching of the intimate parts of another. At least in Florida, &quot;Sexual battery means oral, anal, or vaginal penetration by, or union with, the sexual organ of another or the anal or vaginal penetration of another by any other object&quot;: See section 794.011.
* Family-violence battery may be limited in its scope between persons within a certain degree of relationship: statutes for this offense have been enacted in response to increasing awareness of the problem of domestic violence.
* Aggravated battery generally is seen as a serious offense of felony grade. Aggravated battery charges may occur when a battery causes serious bodily injury or permanent disfigurement. As a successor to the common law crime of mayhem, this is sometimes subsumed in the definition of assault. In Florida, aggravated battery is the &quot;intentional&quot; infliction of great bodily harm and is a second-degree felony, whereas battery that &quot;unintentionally&quot; causes great bodily harm is considered a third-degree felony.

==== Kansas ====

In the state of Kansas, battery is defined as follows:

:Battery.
:(a) Battery is:
:(1) Knowingly or recklessly causing bodily harm to another person; or
:(2) knowingly causing physical contact with another person when done in a rude, insulting, or angry manner.

==== Louisiana ====

The law on battery in Louisiana reads:

:§ 33. Battery defined:
:Battery is the intentional use of force or violence upon the person of another; or the intentional administration of a poison or other noxious liquid or substance to another.

== Jurisdictional differences ==

In some jurisdictions, battery has recently been constructed to include directing bodily secretions (i.e., spitting) at another person without their permission. Some of those jurisdictions automatically elevate such a battery to the charge of aggravated battery. In some jurisdictions, the charge of criminal battery also requires evidence of a mental state (&quot;mens rea&quot;). The terminology used to refer to a particular offense can also vary by jurisdiction. Some jurisdictions, such as New York, refer to what, under the common-law, would-be battery as assault, and then use another term for the crime that would have been assault, such as menacing.

== Distinction between battery and assault ==

A typical overt behavior of an assault is Person A chasing Person B and swinging a fist toward their head. That for battery is A striking B.

Battery requires:
* a volitional act (that is the defendant was acting volunarily), that
* results in physical (or in the US, &quot;harmful or offensive&quot;) contact with another person, and
* is committed for the purpose of causing that contact, or, in the US, under circumstances that render such contact substantially certain to occur or with a reckless disregard as to whether such contact will result, or in England and Wales, reckless that it might occur (meaning that the defendant foresaw the risk of that contact and carried on unreasonably to take that risk).

Assault, where rooted on English law, the act of intentionally causing a person to apprehend physical contact with their person. Elsewhere it is often similarly worded as the threat of violence to a person while aggravated assault is the threat with the clear and present ability and willingness to carry it out. Aggravated battery is, typically, offensive touching without a tool or weapon with attempt to harm or restrain.

<doc id="310236" wikidata="Q3550143" url="?curid=310236" title="Union des forces progressistes (Quebec)">
<text>The Union des forces progressistes (, UFP) was a left-wing political party in Quebec, Canada, active from 2002 to 2006.

==History==
The Union des Forces Progressistes (UFP) was formed in 2002 out of desire to unite Québec&#x27;s leftists into a political party. Four parties merged to form the Union:
* the Rassemblement pour l&#x27;alternative progressiste (RAP),
* the Parti de la démocratie socialiste (PDS), formerly the New Democratic Party of Quebec
* the Parti communiste du Québec (PCQ), and
* the Québec-based membership of the International Socialists.

On 5 November 2005, delegates of the UFP voted unanimously in favour of a merger with the party of the Option citoyenne movement led by Françoise David. The founding congress of the new party was held on 4 February 2006 and resulted in the formation of a new party, Québec solidaire.

==Principles and aims==
The aim of the UFP was to bring together progressive forces across the broad left wing of the political spectrum, including social democrats, socialists and communists. The UFP also advocated altermondialism, feminism, pacifism and green politics. Its platform did not specifically endorse social democracy, socialism, or communism.

The Green Party of Quebec pledged to try to avoid running candidates in ridings where there was a UFP candidate, although it reserved the right to run anywhere it wants to (even ridings with a UFP candidate), and did not merge with the UFP.

The UFP presented itself as an alternative to the main three parties in Québec: the centre-left Parti Québécois, the centre-right Quebec Liberal Party, and the conservative Action démocratique du Québec/Equipe Mario Dumont, saying that all three are but different faces of the same right-wing ideology called neoliberalism.

The UFP opposed globalization, privatization, and deregulation, and called for increased funding of social services, higher taxes on the rich and business, proportional representation in the National Assembly of Quebec, and an alternative economy based upon co-operatives and nonprofit organizations.

The UFP supported Québec sovereignty. It considered this option not as an end in itself, but rather as a means to achieve the party&#x27;s social ideal for the people of Québec. To solve the national question, the UFP suggested the creation of a Constituent Assembly, mandated to draw up and propose to the population, via referendum, a Constitution for a progressive, republican, secular, and democratic Québec.

The UFP was led by a council instead of a single leader. The UFP promised to be a party of the ballot box and of the streets, meaning that it would work to increase awareness of social problems and for progressive social change even between elections, particularly with regards to the rights of workers and of the unemployed.

Considering its modest results in the 2003 elections (1.06% of the votes or 1.50% if the Green Party of Québec&#x27;s votes were included), the UFP was a marginal party.

==UFP position on the national question==
From the Preamble of the UFP political platform, &quot;Building a world that reflects our ideals!&quot; :

:&quot;UFP members share the view that the answer to the national question, and by extension social emancipation, is sovereignty for the Quebec people. The UFP believes that Quebec should become a country, free from the federalist yoke, and should acquire the essential tools it needs to develop as a nation.&quot;

<text>François Viète (; 1540 – 23 February 1603), known in Latin as Franciscus Vieta, was a French mathematician whose work on new algebra was an important step towards modern algebra, due to his innovative use of letters as parameters in equations. He was a lawyer by trade, and served as a privy councillor to both Henry III and Henry IV of France.

== Biography ==

=== Early life and education ===
Viète was born at Fontenay-le-Comte in present-day Vendée. His grandfather was a merchant from La Rochelle. His father, Etienne Viète, was an attorney in Fontenay-le-Comte and a notary in Le Busseau. His mother was the aunt of Barnabé Brisson, a magistrate and the first president of parliament during the ascendancy of the Catholic League of France.

Viète went to a Franciscan school and in 1558 studied law at Poitiers, graduating as a Bachelor of Laws in 1559. A year later, he began his career as an attorney in his native town. From the outset, he was entrusted with some major cases, including the settlement of rent in Poitou for the widow of King Francis I of France and looking after the interests of Mary, Queen of Scots.

=== Serving Parthenay ===
In 1564, Viète entered the service of Antoinette d&#x27;Aubeterre, Lady Soubise, wife of Jean V de Parthenay-Soubise, one of the main Huguenot military leaders and accompanied him to Lyon to collect documents about his heroic defence of that city against the troops of Jacques of Savoy, 2nd Duke of Nemours just the year before.

The same year, at Parc-Soubise, in the commune of Mouchamps in present-day Vendée, Viète became the tutor of Catherine de Parthenay, Soubise&#x27;s twelve-year-old daughter. He taught her science and mathematics and wrote for her numerous treatises on astronomy and trigonometry, some of which have survived. In these treatises, Viète used decimal numbers (twenty years before Stevin&#x27;s paper) and he also noted the elliptic orbit of the planets, forty years before Kepler and twenty years before Giordano Bruno&#x27;s death.

John V de Parthenay presented him to King Charles IX of France. Viète wrote a genealogy of the Parthenay family and following the death of Jean V de Parthenay-Soubise in 1566 his biography.

In 1568, Antoinette, Lady Soubise, married her daughter Catherine to Baron Charles de Quellenec and Viète went with Lady Soubise to La Rochelle, where he mixed with the highest Calvinist aristocracy, leaders like Coligny and Condé and Queen Jeanne d’Albret of Navarre and her son, Henry of Navarre, the future Henry IV of France.

In 1570, he refused to represent the Soubise ladies in their infamous lawsuit against the Baron De Quellenec, where they claimed the Baron was unable (or unwilling) to provide an heir.

=== First steps in Paris ===

In 1571, he enrolled as an attorney in Paris, and continued to visit his student Catherine. He regularly lived in Fontenay-le-Comte, where he took on some municipal functions. He began publishing his &quot;Universalium inspectionum ad Canonem mathematicum liber singularis&quot; and wrote new mathematical research by night or during periods of leisure. He was known to dwell on any one question for up to three days, his elbow on the desk, feeding himself without changing position (according to his friend, Jacques de Thou).

In 1572, Viète was in Paris during the St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day massacre. That night, Baron De Quellenec was killed after having tried to save Admiral Coligny the previous night. The same year, Viète met Françoise de Rohan, Lady of Garnache, and became her adviser against Jacques, Duke of Nemours.

In 1573, he became a councillor of the Parlement of Rennes, at Rennes, and two years later, he obtained the agreement of Antoinette d&#x27;Aubeterre for the marriage of Catherine of Parthenay to Duke René de Rohan, Françoise&#x27;s brother.

In 1576, Henri, duc de Rohan took him under his special protection, recommending him in 1580 as &quot;maître des requêtes&quot;. In 1579, Viète finished the printing of his &quot;Universalium inspectionum&quot; (Mettayer publisher), published as an appendix to a book of two trigonometric tables (&quot;Canon mathematicus, seu ad triangula&quot;, the &quot;canon&quot; referred to by the title of his &quot;Universalium inspectionum&quot;, and &quot;Canonion triangulorum laterum rationalium&quot;). A year later, he was appointed maître des requêtes to the parliament of Paris, committed to serving the king. That same year, his success in the trial between the Duke of Nemours and Françoise de Rohan, to the benefit of the latter, earned him the resentment of the tenacious Catholic League.

=== Exile in Fontenay ===
Between 1583 and 1585, the League persuaded king Henry III to release Viète, Viète having been accused of sympathy with the Protestant cause. Henry of Navarre, at Rohan&#x27;s instigation, addressed two letters to King Henry III of France on March 3 and April 26, 1585, in an attempt to obtain Viète&#x27;s restoration to his former office, but he failed.

Viète retired to Fontenay and Beauvoir-sur-Mer, with François de Rohan. He spent four years devoted to mathematics, writing his &quot;New Algebra&quot; (1591).

=== Code-breaker to two kings ===
In 1589, Henry III took refuge in Blois. He commanded the royal officials to be at Tours before 15 April 1589. Viète was one of the first who came back to Tours. He deciphered the secret letters of the Catholic League and other enemies of the king. Later, he had arguments with the classical scholar Joseph Juste Scaliger. Viète triumphed against him in 1590.

After the death of Henry III, Viète became a privy councillor to Henry of Navarre, now Henry IV of France. He was appreciated by the king, who admired his mathematical talents. Viète was given the position of councillor of the &quot;parlement&quot; at Tours. In 1590, Viète broke the key to a Spanish cipher, consisting of more than 500 characters, and this meant that all dispatches in that language which fell into the hands of the French could be easily read.

Henry IV published a letter from Commander Moreo to the King of Spain. The contents of this letter, read by Viète, revealed that the head of the League in France, Charles, Duke of Mayenne, planned to become king in place of Henry IV. This publication led to the settlement of the Wars of Religion. The King of Spain accused Viète of having used magical powers.
In 1593, Viète published his arguments against Scaliger. Beginning in 1594, he was appointed exclusively deciphering the enemy&#x27;s secret codes.

=== Gregorian calendar ===

In 1582, Pope Gregory XIII published his bull &quot;Inter gravissimas&quot; and ordered Catholic kings to comply with the change from the Julian calendar, based on the calculations of the Calabrian doctor Aloysius Lilius, aka Luigi Lilio or Luigi Giglio. His work was resumed, after his death, by the scientific adviser to the Pope, Christopher Clavius.

Viète accused Clavius, in a series of pamphlets (1600), of introducing corrections and intermediate days in an arbitrary manner, and misunderstanding the meaning of the works of his predecessor, particularly in the calculation of the lunar cycle. Viète gave a new timetable, which Clavius cleverly refuted, after Viète&#x27;s death, in his &quot;Explicatio&quot; (1603).

It is said that Viète was wrong. Without doubt, he believed himself to be a kind of &quot;King of Times&quot; as the historian of mathematics, Dhombres, claimed. It is true that Viète held Clavius in low esteem, as evidenced by De Thou:

=== The Adriaan van Roomen problem ===
In 1596, Scaliger resumed his attacks from the University of Leyden. Viète replied definitively the following year. In March that same year, Adriaan van Roomen sought the resolution, by any of Europe&#x27;s top mathematicians, to a polynomial equation of degree 45. King Henri IV received a snub from the Dutch ambassador, who claimed that there was no mathematician in France. He said it was simply because some Dutch mathematician, Adriaan van Roomen, had not asked any Frenchman to solve his problem.

Viète came, saw the problem, and, after leaning on a window for a few minutes, solved it. It was the equation between sin(x) and sin(x/45). He resolved this at once, and said he was able to give at the same time (actually the next day) the solution to the other 22 problems to the ambassador. &quot;Ut legit, ut solvit,&quot; he later said. Further, he sent a new problem back to Van Roomen, for resolution by Euclidean tools (rule and compass) of the lost answer to the problem first set by Apollonius of Perga. Van Roomen could not overcome that problem without resorting to a trick (see detail below).

=== Final years ===
In 1598, Viète was granted special leave. Henry IV, however, charged him to end the revolt of the Notaries, whom the King had ordered to pay back their fees. Sick and exhausted by work, he left the King&#x27;s service in December 1602 and received 20,000 écus, which were found at his bedside after his death.

A few weeks before his death, he wrote a final thesis on issues of cryptography, which essay made obsolete all encryption methods of the time. He died on 23 February 1603, as De Thou wrote, leaving two daughters, Jeanne, whose mother was Barbe Cottereau, and Suzanne, whose mother was Julienne Leclerc. Jeanne, the eldest, died in 1628, having married Jean Gabriau, a councillor of the parliament of Brittany. Suzanne died in January 1618 in Paris.

The cause of Viète&#x27;s death is unknown. Alexander Anderson, student of Viète and publisher of his scientific writings, speaks of a &quot;praeceps et immaturum autoris fatum&quot; (meeting an untimely end).

== Work and thought ==
=== New algebra === 

==== Background ====
At the end of the 16th century, mathematics was placed under the dual aegis of Greek geometry and the Arabic procedures for resolution. At the time of Viète, algebra therefore oscillated between arithmetic, which gave the appearance of a list of rules; and geometry, which seemed more rigorous. Meanwhile, Italian mathematicians Luca Pacioli, Scipione del Ferro, Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia, Gerolamo Cardano, Lodovico Ferrari, and especially Raphael Bombelli (1560) all developed techniques for solving equations of the third degree, which heralded a new era.

On the other hand, from the German school of Coss, the Welsh mathematician Robert Recorde (1550) and the Dutchman Simon Stevin (1581) brought an early algebraic notation: the use of decimals and exponents. However, complex numbers remained at best a philosophical way of thinking. Descartes, almost a century after their invention, used them as imaginary numbers. Only positive solutions were considered and using geometrical proof was common.

The mathematician&#x27;s task was in fact twofold. It was necessary to produce algebra in a more geometrical way (i.e. to give it a rigorous foundation), and it was also necessary to make geometry more algebraic, allowing for analytical calculation in the plane. Viète and Descartes solved this dual task in a double revolution.

==== Viète&#x27;s symbolic algebra ====
Firstly, Viète gave algebra a foundation as strong as that of geometry. He then ended the algebra of procedures (al-Jabr and al-Muqabala), creating the first symbolic algebra, and claiming that with it, all problems could be solved (&quot;nullum non problema solvere&quot;).

In his dedication of the &quot;Isagoge&quot; to Catherine de Parthenay, Viète wrote:
Viète did not know &quot;multiplied&quot; notation (given by William Oughtred in 1631) or the symbol of equality, =, an absence which is more striking because Robert Recorde had used the present symbol for this purpose since 1557, and Guilielmus Xylander had used parallel vertical lines since 1575. Note also the use of a &#x27;u&#x27; like symbol with a number above it for an unknown to a given power by Rafael Bombelli in 1572.

Viète had neither much time, nor students able to brilliantly illustrate his method. He took years in publishing his work (he was very meticulous), and most importantly, he made a very specific choice to separate the unknown variables, using consonants for parameters and vowels for unknowns. In this notation he perhaps followed some older contemporaries, such as Petrus Ramus, who designated the points in geometrical figures by vowels, making use of consonants, R, S, T, etc., only when these were exhausted. This choice proved unpopular with future mathematicians and Descartes, among others, preferred the first letters of the alphabet to designate the parameters and the latter for the unknowns.

Viète also remained a prisoner of his time in several respects. First, he was heir of Ramus and did not address the lengths as numbers. His writing kept track of homogeneity, which did not simplify their reading. He failed to recognize the complex numbers of Bombelli and needed to double-check his algebraic answers through geometrical construction. Although he was fully aware that his new algebra was sufficient to give a solution, this concession tainted his reputation.

However, Viète created many innovations: the binomial formula, which would be taken by Pascal and Newton, and the coefficients of a polynomial to sums and products of its roots, called Viète&#x27;s formula.

==== Geometric algebra ====
Viète was well skilled in most modern artifices, aiming at the simplification of equations by the substitution of new quantities having a certain connection with the primitive unknown quantities. Another of his works, &quot;Recensio canonica effectionum geometricarum&quot;, bears a modern stamp, being what was later called an algebraic geometry—a collection of precepts how to construct algebraic expressions with the use of ruler and compass only. While these writings were generally intelligible, and therefore of the greatest didactic importance, the principle of homogeneity, first enunciated by Viète, was so far in advance of his times that most readers seem to have passed it over. That principle had been made use of by the Greek authors of the classic age; but of later mathematicians only Hero, Diophantus, etc., ventured to regard lines and surfaces as mere numbers that could be joined to give a new number, their sum.

The study of such sums, found in the works of Diophantus, may have prompted Viète to lay down the principle that quantities occurring in an equation ought to be homogeneous, all of them lines, or surfaces, or solids, or supersolids — an equation between mere numbers being inadmissible. During the centuries that have elapsed between Viète&#x27;s day and the present, several changes of opinion have taken place on this subject. Modern mathematicians like to make homogeneous such equations as are not so from the beginning, in order to get values of a symmetrical shape. Viète himself did not see that far; nevertheless, he indirectly suggested the thought. He also conceived methods for the general resolution of equations of the second, third and fourth degrees different from those of Scipione dal Ferro and Lodovico Ferrari, with which he had not been acquainted. He devised an approximate numerical solution of equations of the second and third degrees, wherein Leonardo of Pisa must have preceded him, but by a method which was completely lost.

Above all, Viète was the first mathematician who introduced notations for the problem (and not just for the unknowns). As a result, his algebra was no longer limited to the statement of rules, but relied on an efficient computational algebra, in which the operations act on the letters and the results can be obtained at the end of the calculations by a simple replacement. This approach, which is the heart of contemporary algebraic method, was a fundamental step in the development of mathematics. With this, Viète marked the end of medieval algebra (from Al-Khwarizmi to Stevin) and opened the modern period.

=== The logic of &quot;species&quot; ===
Being wealthy, Viète began to publish at his own expense, for a few friends and scholars in almost every country of Europe, the systematic presentation of his mathematic theory, which he called &quot;species logistic&quot; (from &quot;species:&quot; symbol) or art of calculation on symbols (1591).

He described in three stages how to proceed for solving a problem:
* As a first step, he summarized the problem in the form of an equation. Viète called this stage the Zetetic. It denotes the known quantities by consonants (B, D, etc.) and the unknown quantities by the vowels (A, E, etc.)
* In a second step, he made an analysis. He called this stage the Poristic. Here mathematicians must discuss the equation and solve it. It gives the characteristic of the problem, porisma (corrollary), from which we can move to the next step.
* In the last step, the exegetical analysis, he returned to the initial problem which presents a solution through a geometrical or numerical construction based on porisma.

Among the problems addressed by Viète with this method is the complete resolution of the quadratic equations of the form formula_1 and third-degree equations of the form formula_2 (Viète reduced it to quadratic equations). He knew the connection between the positive roots of an equation (which, in his day, were alone thought of as roots) and the coefficients of the different powers of the unknown quantity (see Viète&#x27;s formulas and their application on quadratic equations). He discovered the formula for deriving the sine of a multiple angle, knowing that of the simple angle with due regard to the periodicity of sines. This formula must have been known to Viète in 1593.

=== Viète&#x27;s formula ===

In 1593, based on geometrical considerations and through trigonometric calculations perfectly mastered, he discovered the first infinite product in the history of mathematics by giving an expression of , now known as Viète&#x27;s formula:

:formula_3

He provides 10 decimal places of  by applying the Archimedes method to a polygon with 6 × 216 = 393,216 sides.

=== Adriaan van Roomen&#x27;s challenge and the problem of Apollonius ===
This famous controversy is told by Tallemant des Réaux in these terms (46th story from the first volume of &quot;Les Historiettes. Mémoires pour servir à l’histoire du XVIIe siècle&quot;):
When, in 1595, Viète published his response to the problem set by Adriaan van Roomen, he proposed finding the resolution of the old problem of Apollonius, namely to find a circle tangent to three given circles. Van Roomen proposed a solution using a hyperbola, with which Viète did not agree, as he was hoping for a solution using Euclidean tools.

Viète published his own solution in 1600 in his work &quot;Apollonius Gallus&quot;. In this paper, Viète made use of the center of similitude of two circles. His friend De Thou said that Adriaan van Roomen immediately left the University of Würzburg, saddled his horse and went to Fontenay-le-Comte, where Viète lived. According to De Thou, he stayed a month with him, and learned the methods of the new algebra. The two men became friends and Viète paid all van Roomen&#x27;s expenses before his return to Würzburg.

This resolution had an almost immediate impact in Europe and Viète earned the admiration of many mathematicians over the centuries. Viète did not deal with cases (circles together, these tangents, etc.), but recognized that the number of solutions depends on the relative position of the three circles and outlined the ten resulting situations. Descartes completed (in 1643) the theorem of the three circles of Apollonius, leading to a quadratic equation in 87 terms, each of which is a product of six factors (which, with this method, makes the actual construction humanly impossible).

=== Religious and political beliefs ===
Viète was accused of Protestantism by the Catholic League, but he was not a Huguenot. His father was, according to Dhombres. Indifferent in religious matters, he did not adopt the Calvinist faith of Parthenay, nor that of his other protectors, the Rohan family. His call to the parliament of Rennes proved the opposite. At the reception as a member of the court of Brittany, on 6 April 1574, he read in public a statement of Catholic faith.

Nevertheless, Viète defended and protected Protestants his whole life, and suffered, in turn, the wrath of the League. It seems that for him, the stability of the state was to be preserved and that under this requirement, the King&#x27;s religion did not matter. At that time, such people were called &quot;Politicals.&quot;

Furthermore, at his death, he did not want to confess his sins. A friend had to convince him that his own daughter would not find a husband, were he to refuse the sacraments of the Catholic Church. Whether Viète was an atheist or not is a matter of debate.

=== Publications ===

== Reception and influence ==

During the ascendancy of the Catholic League, Viète&#x27;s secretary was Nathaniel Tarporley, perhaps one of the more interesting and enigmatic mathematicians of 16th-century England. When he returned to London, Tarporley became one of the trusted friends of Thomas Harriot.

Apart from Catherine de Parthenay, Viète&#x27;s other notable students were: French mathematician Jacques Aleaume, from Orleans, Marino Ghetaldi of Ragusa, Jean de Beaugrand and the Scottish mathematician Alexander Anderson. They illustrated his theories by publishing his works and continuing his methods. At his death, his heirs gave his manuscripts to Peter Aleaume. We give here the most important posthumous editions:
* In 1612: &quot;Supplementum Apollonii Galli&quot; of Marino Ghetaldi.
* From 1615 to 1619: &quot;Animadversionis in Franciscum Vietam, Clemente a Cyriaco nuper&quot; by Alexander Anderson
* &quot;Francisci Vietae Fontenaeensis ab aequationum recognitione et emendatione Tractatus duo Alexandrum&quot; per Andersonum. Paris, Laquehay, 1615, in 4, 135 p. The death of Alexander Anderson unfortunately halted the publication.
* In 1630, an &quot;Introduction en l&#x27;art analytic ou nouvelle algèbre&quot; (&#x27;Introduction to the analytic art or modern algebra&quot;), translated into French and commentary by mathematician J. L. Sieur de Vaulezard. Paris, Jacquin.
* The &quot;Five Books of François Viette&#x27;s Zetetic&quot; (&quot;Les cinq livres des zététiques de François Viette&quot;), put into French, and commented increased by mathematician J. L. Sieur de Vaulezard. Paris, Jacquin, p. 219.

The same year, there appeared an &quot;Isagoge&quot; by Antoine Vasset (a pseudonym of Claude Hardy), and the following year, a translation into Latin of Beaugrand, which Descartes would have received.

In 1648, the corpus of mathematical works printed by Frans van Schooten, professor at Leiden University (Elzevirs presses). He was assisted by Jacques Golius and Mersenne.

The English mathematicians Thomas Harriot and Isaac Newton, and the Dutch physicist Willebrord Snellius, the French mathematicians Pierre de Fermat and Blaise Pascal all used Viète&#x27;s symbolism.

About 1770, the Italian mathematician Targioni Tozzetti, found in Florence Viète&#x27;s &quot;Harmonicon coeleste&quot;. Viète had written in it: &quot;Describat Planeta Ellipsim ad motum anomaliae ad Terram&quot;. (That shows he adopted Copernicus&#x27; system and understood before Kepler the elliptic form of the orbits of planets.)

In 1841, the French mathematician Michel Chasles was one of the first to reevaluate his role in the development of modern algebra.

In 1847, a letter from François Arago, perpetual secretary of the Academy of Sciences (Paris), announced his intention to write a biography of François Viète.

Between 1880 and 1890, the polytechnician Fréderic Ritter, based in Fontenay-le-Comte, was the first translator of the works of François Viète and his first contemporary biographer with Benjamin Fillon.

=== Descartes&#x27; views on Viète ===
Thirty-four years after the death of Viète, the philosopher René Descartes published his &quot;method&quot; and a book of geometry that changed the landscape of algebra and built on Viète&#x27;s work, applying it to the geometry by removing its requirements of homogeneity. Descartes, accused by Jean Baptiste Chauveau, a former classmate of La Flèche, explained in a letter to Mersenne (1639 February) that he never read those works. Descartes accepted the Viète&#x27;s view of mathematics for which the study shall stress the self-evidence of the results that Descartes implemented translating the symbolic algebra in geometric reasoning. Descartes adopted the term &quot;mathesis universalis&quot;, which he called an &quot;already venerable term with a received usage&quot;, which originated in van Roomen&#x27;s book &quot;Mathesis Universalis&quot;.

Elsewhere, Descartes said that Viète&#x27;s notations were confusing and used unnecessary geometric justifications. In some letters, he showed he understands the program of the &quot;Artem Analyticem Isagoge&quot;; in others, he shamelessly caricatured Viète&#x27;s proposals. One of his biographers, Charles Adam, noted this contradiction:
Current research has not shown the extent of the direct influence of the works of Viète on Descartes. This influence could have been formed through the works of Adriaan van Roomen or Jacques Aleaume at the Hague, or through the book by Jean de Beaugrand.

In his letters to Mersenne, Descartes consciously minimized the originality and depth of the work of his predecessors. &quot;I began,&quot; he says, &quot;where Vieta finished&quot;. His views emerged in the 17th century and mathematicians won a clear algebraic language without the requirements of homogeneity. Many contemporary studies have restored the work of Parthenay&#x27;s mathematician, showing he had the double merit of introducing the first elements of literal calculation and building a first axiomatic for algebra.

Although Viète was not the first to propose notation of unknown quantities by letters - Jordanus Nemorarius had done this in the past - we can reasonably estimate that it would be simplistic to summarize his innovations for that discovery and place him at the junction of algebraic transformations made during the late sixteenth – early 17th century.
