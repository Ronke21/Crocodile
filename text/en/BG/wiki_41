<text>Durban ( ; , from meaning &quot;bay, lagoon&quot;) is the third-most populous city in South Africa, after Johannesburg and Cape Town, and the largest city in the province of KwaZulu-Natal. Situated on the east coast of South Africa, on the Natal Bay of the Indian Ocean, Durban is the busiest port city in sub-Saharan Africa and was formerly named Port Natal. North of the harbour and city centre lies the mouth of the Umgeni River; the flat city centre rises to the hills of the Berea on the west; and to the south, running along the coast, is the Bluff. Durban is the seat of the larger eThekwini Metropolitan Municipality, which spans an area of and had a population of 4.2million in 2022, making the metropolitan population one of Africa&#x27;s largest on the Indian Ocean. Within the city limits, Durban&#x27;s population was 595,061 in 2011. The city has a humid subtropical climate, with hot, wet summers and mild, dry winters.

Archaeological evidence from the Drakensberg mountains suggests that the area had been inhabited by hunter-gatherers millennia ago. Later, the Nguni people occupied the region. During Christmas 1497, Vasco da Gama saw the coast and named it , the Portuguese word for Christmas. In 1824, English traders from Cape Colony, led by Francis Farewell and Henry Fynn, established a trading post at Port Natal, and later that year, Shaka, the Zulu king, granted them land around the Bay. In 1835, the settlement was named after Sir Benjamin D&#x27;Urban, then governor of Cape Colony, and became a borough in 1854. From 1860 onwards, indentured labourers from British India arrived in Durban, as well as later passenger Indians. Natal colony, which had grown, became a province of the Union of South Africa in 1910, and Durban was granted city status in 1935.

Durban has a rich, diverse heritage, with large Zulu, Indian, White, and Coloured populations. Historically, it was a popular tourist destination domestically because of its beaches and warm climate, but in recent years, tourism has declined. Some notable places are the Golden Mile beachfront, Botanic Gardens, the Art Gallery and Natural Science Museum at City Hall, the Tudor-style Playhouse Theatre, uShaka Marine World, and the International Convention Centre. In addition to various architectural styles, ranging from Victorian to contemporary, Art Deco left its stamp on many of Durban&#x27;s buildings. As of 2018, the metro area contributed 59.9% and 9.6% to the provincial and national gross domestic product, respectively; the main sectors were finance, community services, manufacturing, trade, transport, and tourism. Durban was one of the host cities of the 2010 FIFA World Cup, for which the Moses Mabhida Stadium was built, and is UNESCO&#x27;s first City of Literature in Africa.

== History ==

Archaeological evidence from the Drakensberg mountains suggests that the Durban area has been inhabited by communities of hunter-gatherers since 100,000 BP. These people lived throughout the area of KwaZulu-Natal until the expansion of agro-pastoralists and pastoralists from the north saw their gradual incorporation. Oral history has been passed down from generation to generation by the Zulu nation, who were inhabitants of the land before European colonisers, but there is no written history of the area until it was sighted by Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama, who sailed parallel to the KwaZulu-Natal coast at Christmastide in 1497 while searching for a route from Europe to India. He named the area , meaning &quot;Christmas&quot; in Portuguese.

=== Abambo people ===
In 1686, a ship from the Dutch East India Company named &quot;Stavenisse&quot; was wrecked off the eastern coast of South Africa. Some of the survivors made their way to the Bay of Natal (Durban) where they were taken in by the &quot;Abambo&quot; tribe (Hlubi people), which was led by Chief Langalibalele. The crew became fluent in the tribe&#x27;s language and witnessed their customs. The tribe told them that the land where the Abambo people lived was called Embo by the natives and that the people were very hospitable.

On 28 October 1689, the galiot &quot;Noord&quot; travelled from Table Bay to the Bay of Natal to fetch the surviving crew of the &quot;Stavenisse&quot; and to negotiate a deal for purchasing the bay. The &quot;Noord&quot; arrived on 9 December 1689, whereafter the Dutch Cape Colony purchased the Bay of Natal from the Abambo people for £1,650. A formal contract was drawn up by Laurens van Swaanswyk and signed by the chief of the Abambo people, with the crew of the &quot;Stavenisse&quot; acting as translators.

=== First European colonisers ===
By 1822, James Saunders King, captain of the British ship , together with Lt. Francis George Farewell, both men being former Royal Navy officers from the Napoleonic Wars, were engaged in trade between the Cape and Delagoa Bay. On a return trip to the Cape in 1823, they were caught in a severe storm and decided to risk the Bar and anchor in the Bay of Natal. The crossing went well and they found safe anchor from the storm. Lt. King decided to map the Bay and named the &quot;Salisbury and Farewell Islands&quot;. In 1824 Lt. Farewell, together with a trading company called J. R. Thompson &amp; Co., decided to open trade relations with Shaka the Zulu King, and establish a trading station at the Bay. Henry Francis Fynn, another trader at Delagoa Bay, was also involved in this venture.

Fynn left Delagoa Bay and sailed for the Bay of Natal on the brig &quot;Julia&quot;, while Farewell followed six weeks later on the &quot;Antelope&quot;. Between them they had 26 possible settlers, although only 18 stayed. On a visit to King Shaka, Henry Francis Fynn succeeded in befriending the king by helping him recover from a stab wound that he had suffered as a result of an assassination attempt by one of his half-brothers. As a token of his gratitude King Shaka granted Fynn a &quot;25-mile strip of coast a hundred miles in depth&quot;.

On 7 August 1824, they concluded negotiations with King Shaka for a cession of land, including the Bay of Natal and land extending south of the Bay, north of the Bay and inland. 
Farewell took possession of this grant and raised the Union Jack with a Royal Salute, which consisted of four cannon shots and twenty musket shots. Only six of the original eighteen would-be settlers remained, and these six can be regarded as the founders of Port Natal as a British colony. These six were joined by Lt. James Saunders King and Nathaniel Isaacs in 1825.

The modern city of Durban thus dates from 1824, when the settlement was established on the northern shores of the bay near today&#x27;s Farewell Square. During a meeting of 35 European residents in Fynn&#x27;s territory on 23 June 1835, it was decided to build a capital town and name it &quot;D&#x27;Urban&quot; after Sir Benjamin D&#x27;Urban, who was the governor of the Cape Colony at the time.

=== Republic of Natalia ===

The Voortrekkers established the Republic of Natalia in 1839, with its capital at Pietermaritzburg.

Tension between the Voortrekkers and the Zulus prompted the governor of the Cape Colony to dispatch a force under Captain Charlton Smith to establish British rule in Natal, for fear of losing British control in Port Natal. The force arrived on 4 May 1842 and built a fortification that was later to be &quot;The Old Fort&quot;. On the night of 23/24 May 1842, the British attacked the Voortrekker camp at Congella. The attack failed, and the British had to withdraw to their camp, which was put under siege. A local trader Dick King and his servant Ndongeni were able to escape the blockade and rode to Grahamstown, a distance of in fourteen days to raise reinforcements. The reinforcements arrived in Durban 20 days later; the Voortrekkers retreated, and the siege was lifted.

Fierce conflict with the Zulu population led to the evacuation of Durban, and eventually the Afrikaners accepted British annexation in 1844 under military pressure.

====Durban&#x27;s historic regalia====
When the Borough of Durban was proclaimed in 1854, the council had to procure a seal for official documents. The seal was produced in 1855 and was replaced in 1882. The new seal contained a coat of arms without helmet or mantling that combined the coats of arms of Sir Benjamin D&#x27;Urban and Sir Benjamin Pine. An application was made to register the coat of arms with the College of Arms in 1906, but this application was rejected on grounds that the design implied that D&#x27;Urban and Pine were husband and wife. Nevertheless, the coat of arms appeared on the council&#x27;s stationery from about 1912. The following year, a helmet and mantling was added to the council&#x27;s stationery and to the new city seal that was made in 1936. The motto reads &quot;Debile principium melior fortuna sequitur&quot;—&quot;Better fortune follows a humble beginning&quot;.

The blazon of the arms registered by the South African Bureau of Heraldry and granted to Durban on 9 February 1979. The coat of arms fell into disuse with the re-organisation of the South African local government structure in 2000. The seal ceased to be used in 1995.

== Government ==
 With the end of apartheid, Durban was subject to restructuring of local government. Its first mayor was Sipho Ngwenya. In 1996, the city became part of the &quot;Durban UniCity&quot; in July 1996 as part of transitional arrangements and to &quot;eThekwini Metropolitan Municipality&quot; in 1999, with the adoption of South Africa&#x27;s new municipal governance system. In July 1996, Obed Mlaba was appointed mayor of Durban UniCity; in 1999 he was elected mayor of the eThekwini municipality and re-elected in 2006. Following the May 2011 local elections, James Nxumalo, the former speaker of the council, was elected as the new mayor. On 23 August 2016 Zandile Gumede was elected as the new mayor until 13 August 2019. On 5 September 2019 Mxolisi Kaunda was sworn in as the new mayor.

The name of the Durban municipal government, prior to the post-apartheid reorganisations of municipalities, was the &quot;Durban Corporation&quot; or &quot;City of Durban&quot;.

== Geography ==
Durban is located on the east coast of South Africa, looking out upon the Indian Ocean. The city lies at the mouth of the Umgeni River, which demarcates parts of Durban&#x27;s north city limit, while other sections of the river flow through the city itself. Durban has a natural harbour, Port of Durban, which is the busiest port in South Africa and the fourth-busiest in the Southern Hemisphere.

The extent of urban sprawl the Greater Durban agglomeration has experienced, virtually adjoining surrounding smaller towns, has made boundaries in the metropolitan area quite complicated. Durban proper, which is the main city, is demarcated by its administrative city limits, which are only as large to include the city centre, the Bluff, Berea, Durban North, Mobeni as well as Umbogintwini, Athlone Park, Isipingo and Prospecton to the south among other suburbs.

However, the eThekwini Metropolitan Municipality is an amalgamation of Durban proper and more than 120 other nearby formerly independent towns and suburbs such as Amanzimtoti, Cato Ridge, Chatsworth, Hillcrest, KwaMashu, Inanda, oThongathi, Pinetown, Queensburgh, uMhlanga, Umlazi, Verulam and Westville among others that have organically merged yet still retain their legal boundaries.

The name &quot;Durban&quot; is commonly referred to by residents as not just the city proper but the Greater Durban metropolitan area that sometimes extends beyond eThekwini to include Scottburgh, Ballito and KwaDukuza. Similarly, the demonym of a &quot;Durbanite&quot; not only refers to people who live within Durban proper but to residents of the Greater Durban metropolitan area.

=== Climate ===
Durban has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;), with hot, humid summers and mild to warm, moderately dry winters, which are frost-free. Durban has an annual rainfall of . The average temperature in summer ranges around , while in winter the average temperature is .

==== Climate change ====
A 2019 paper published in PLOS One estimated that under Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5, a &quot;moderate&quot; scenario of climate change where global warming reaches ~ by 2100, the climate of Durban in the year 2050 would most closely resemble the current climate of Kigali. The annual temperature would increase by , and the temperature of the coldest month by , while the temperature of the warmest month would be lower. According to Climate Action Tracker, the current warming trajectory appears consistent with , which closely matches RCP 4.5.

Moreover, according to the 2022 IPCC Sixth Assessment Report, Durban is one of 12 major African cities (Abidjan, Alexandria, Algiers, Cape Town, Casablanca, Dakar, Dar es Salaam, Durban, Lagos, Lomé, Luanda and Maputo) which would be the most severely affected by future sea level rise. It estimates that they would collectively sustain cumulative damages of US$65 billion under RCP 4.5 and US$86.5 billion for the high-emission scenario RCP 8.5 by the year 2050. Additionally, RCP 8.5 combined with the hypothetical impact from marine ice sheet instability at high levels of warming would involve up to US$137.5 billion in damages, while the additional accounting for the &quot;low-probability, high-damage events&quot; may increase aggregate risks to US$187 billion for the &quot;moderate&quot; RCP4.5, US$206 billion for RCP8.5 and US$397 billion under the high-end ice sheet instability scenario. Since sea level rise would continue for about 10,000 years under every scenario of climate change, future costs of sea level rise would only increase, especially without adaptation measures.

== Demographics ==


Durban is ethnically diverse, with a cultural richness of mixed beliefs and traditions. Zulus form the largest single ethnic group. It has a large number of people of British and Indian descent. The influence of Indians in Durban has been significant, bringing with them a variety of cuisine, culture and religion.

In the years following the end of apartheid, there was a population boom as black Africans were allowed to move into the city. The population grew by an annual average of 2.34% between 1996 and 2001. This led to shanty towns forming around the city, which were often demolished. Between 2001 and 2011, the population growth slowed down to 1.08% per year and shanty towns have become less common as the government builds low-income housing.

The population of the city of Durban and central suburbs such as Durban North, Durban South and the Berea increased 10.9% between 2001 and 2011 from 536,644 to 595,061. The proportion of black Africans increased while the proportion of people in all the other racial groups decreased. Black Africans increased from 34.9% to 51.1%; Indians or Asians decreased from 27.3% to 24.0%; whites decreased from 25.5% to 15.3%; and Coloureds decreased from 10.26% to 8.59%. A new racial group, &quot;Other&quot;, was included in the 2011 census at 0.93%.

The city&#x27;s demographics indicate that 68% of the population is of working age, and 38% of the people in Durban are under the age of 19 years.

Durban has the highest number of dollar millionaires added per year of any South African city, with the number having increased 200 percent between 2000 and 2014.

==Economy==
Sugar refining is one of Durban&#x27;s main industries. South Africa produces 19.9 million tons of sugar cane a year and most of it comes from KwaZulu-Natal.

=== Informal sector ===
Durban has a number of informal and semi-formal street vendors. The Warwick Junction Precinct is home to a number of street markets, with vendors selling goods from traditional medicine, to clothing and spices.

The city&#x27;s treatment of shack dwellers was criticised in a report from the United Nations linked Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions and there has also been criticism of the city&#x27;s treatment of street traders, street children and sex workers. The cannabis strain called &quot;Durban Poison&quot; is named for the city.

===Civil society===
There are a number of civil society organisations based in Durban. These include: Abahlali baseMjondolo movement, the Diakonia Council of Churches, the Right2Know Campaign, the South Durban Community Environmental Alliance and the South African Unemployed Peoples&#x27; Movement.

==Tourism and culture==

Durban has been named the greenest city in the world by Husqvarna Urban Green Space Index.

There are many museums, art galleries, theatres, and other centres of culture in Durban.
The African Art Centre is &quot;the longest surviving organisation involved in the development and promotion of African artists and crafters&quot;, founded in 1960, and moving to a new home in Station Drive in 2017.

Ethekwini Municipal Libraries is a free public library network with 90 circulating branch libraries across the metropolitan area, and the Central Reference Library at the Liberty Towers Building, which includes a significant collection of Africana books.

The Phansi Museum is located in the historic Roberts House, a 19th-century colonial mansion and former home of Esther Roberts, a librarian and collector of Africana, member and supporter of the Black Sash anti-apartheid group. The collection and library is now linked to the University of KwaZulu-Natal. It is one of the most extensive Southern African art museums in the world, founded by Paul Mikula, who purchased artefacts from traditional craftspeople through Southern Africa over 30 years. The collection includes 19th-century beadwork, pottery, carvings, and textiles. Talks and exhibitions are held at the museum.

The Playhouse Theatre is located on Anton Lembede Street (formerly Smith Street). The original building on the site was a cinema built in 1896, which was rebuilt in 1935 in Tudor Revival style. The cinema reopened on 7 June 1935 and finally closed in the 1970s. After being taken over by the Performing Arts Council in the 1980s, the building was restored in 1985–6, and with the former Colosseum Theatre (or Prince&#x27;s Theatre) is now a performing arts centre with five venues. The refurbishment architects, Small &amp; Pettit &amp; Robson, were awarded the 1987 Institute of South African Architects Natal Award of Merit for the work. home to the Playhouse Theatre Company. The company&#x27;s mission is &quot;is to provide cultural education and entertainment in both an African and international context&quot; and, apart from drama and dance performances, the company runs an educational program and presents theatre to schools. The Playhouse has been a venue for staging the work of many famous South African playwrights, including Mbongeni Ngema, and in October 2023 there was a casting call for a new musical entitled &quot;From Gibson Kente to Mbongeni Ngema&quot;, to celebrate the works and influence of Gibson Kente and Ngema.

Other significant cultural attractions include:
* Durban Art Gallery
* KZNSA - KwaZulu Natal Society of Arts

=== Places of worship ===
Among the places of worship, there are predominantly Christian churches and temples. These include: Zion Christian Church, Apostolic Faith Mission of South Africa, Assemblies of God, Baptist Union of Southern Africa (Baptist World Alliance), Methodist Church of Southern Africa (World Methodist Council), Anglican Church of Southern Africa (Anglican Communion), Presbyterian Church of Africa (World Communion of Reformed Churches), Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Durban (Catholic Church) and the Durban South Africa Temple (The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints).

There are also mosques and Hindu temples.

=== Architecture ===
From its earlier years to the present, many layers have added to Durban&#x27;s architectural heritage: Victorian, Edwardian, Islamic, Hindu, modernist, and contemporary. Additionally, and in contrast to the classical styles then prevalent, Art Deco found expression in many of Durban&#x27;s buildings in the 20th century, varying in manner from area to area.

== Media ==

Two major English-language daily newspapers are published in Durban, both part of the Independent Newspapers, the national group owned by Sekunjalo Investments. These are the morning editions of &quot;The Mercury&quot; and the afternoon &quot;Daily News&quot;. Like most news media in South Africa, they have seen declining circulations in recent years. Major Zulu language papers comprise &quot;Isolezwe&quot; (Independent Newspapers), &quot;UmAfrika&quot; and &quot;Ilanga&quot;. Independent Newspapers also publish &quot;Post&quot;, a newspaper aimed largely at the Indian community. A national Sunday paper, the &quot;Sunday Tribune&quot; is also published by Independent Newspapers as is the &quot;Independent on Saturday&quot;.

A major city initiative is the &quot;eZasegagasini Metro Gazette&quot;.

The national broadcaster, the SABC, has regional offices in Durban and operates two major stations there. The Zulu language Ukhozi FM has a huge national listenership of more than 6.67 million, making it the second largest radio station in the world. The SABC also operates Radio Lotus, which is aimed at South Africans of Indian origin. The other SABC national stations have smaller regional offices in Durban, as does TV for news links and sports broadcasts. A major English language radio station, East Coast Radio, operates out of Durban and is owned by SA media giant Kagiso Media. There are a number of smaller stations which are independent, having been granted licences by ICASA, the national agency charged with the issue of broadcast licences.

== Sport ==

Durban was initially successful in its bid to host the 2022 Commonwealth Games, but had to withdraw in March 2017 from the role of hosts when the government withdrew its subsidy due to financial constraints. Birmingham, England replaced Durban as the host city.

Durban is home to The Sharks rugby union club, also known as the Cell C Sharks, who compete in the domestic Currie Cup competition as well as in the international United Rugby Championship and Heineken Champions Cup competition. The Sharks&#x27; home ground is the 54,000 capacity HollywoodbetsKings Park Stadium, sometimes referred to as the Shark Tank. The Sharks are home to many South Africa national rugby union team players such as Bongi Mbonambi, Eben Etzebeth, Makazole Mapimpi, Lukhanyo Am and formerly to Thomas du Toit and 2019 Rugby World Cup captain Siya Kolisi.

The city has two soccer clubs in the Premiership — AmaZulu, and Golden Arrows. AmaZulu play most of their home games at the Moses Mabhida Stadium. Golden Arrows play most of their home games at the King Zwelithini Stadium in the nearby township of Umlazi, but sometimes play some of their matches at Moses Mabhida Stadium or Chatsworth Stadium. 

Durban is host to the KwaZulu-Natal cricket team, who play as the Dolphins when competing in the Sunfoil Series. Shaun Pollock, Jonty Rhodes, Lance Klusener, Barry Richards, Andrew Hudson, Hashim Amla, Vince van der Bijl, Kevin Pietersen, Dale Benkenstein and David Miller are all players or past players of the Natal cricket team. International cricketers representing them include Malcolm Marshall, Dwayne Bravo and Graham Onions. Cricket in Durban is played at Kingsmead cricket ground.

Durban hosted matches in the 2003 ICC Cricket World Cup. In 2007 the city hosted nine matches, including a semi-final, as part of the inaugural ICC World Twenty20. The 2009 IPL season was played in South Africa, and Durban was selected as a venue. 2010 saw the city host six matches, including a semi-final, in the 2010 Champions League Twenty20.

The city is home to Greyville Racecourse, a major Thoroughbred horse racing venue that annually hosts a number of prestigious races including the country&#x27;s premier event, the July Handicap, and the premier staying event in South Africa, the Gold Cup. Clairwood racecourse, south of the city, was a popular racing venue for many years, but was sold by the KZN racing authority in 2012.

Durban hosts many famous endurance sports events annually, such as the Comrades Marathon, Dusi Canoe Marathon and the Ironman 70.3.

The city hosted several continental basketball tournaments such as the 1994 FIBA Africa Championship for Women or the 2006 FIBA Africa Under-18 Championship.

== Transport ==

=== Air ===


King Shaka International Airport services both domestic and international flights, with regularly scheduled services to Dubai, Doha, Istanbul, Harare, Lusaka &amp; Manzini as well as eight domestic destinations. Flights to Gaborone started on 2 October 2024. The airport&#x27;s position forms part of the Golden Triangle between Johannesburg and Cape Town, which is important for convenient travel and trade between these three major South African cities. The airport opened in May 2010. King Shaka International Airport handled 6.1 million passengers in 2019/2020, up 1.8 percent from 2018/2019. King Shaka International was constructed at La Mercy, about north of central Durban. All operations at Durban International Airport have been transferred to King Shaka International as of 1 May 2010, with plans for flights to Hong Kong, Singapore, Mumbai, Kigali, Luanda, Lilongwe and Nairobi.

=== Sea ===
Durban has a long tradition as a port city. The Port of Durban, formerly known as Port Natal, is one of the few natural harbours between Port Elizabeth and Maputo, and is also located at the beginning of a particular weather phenomenon that can cause extremely violent seas. These two features made Durban an extremely busy port of call for ship repairs when the port was opened in the 1840s.

MSC Cruises bases one of their cruise ships in Durban from November to April every year. From the 2023/2024 Southern Africa cruise season MSC Cruises will be basing the MSC Splendida in Durban. Durban is the most popular cruise hub in Southern Africa. Cruise destinations from Durban on the MSC &quot;Splendida&quot; include Mozambique, Mauritius, Réunion, Madagascar and other domestic destinations such as Port Elizabeth and Cape Town. Many other ships cruise through Durban every year, including some of the world&#x27;s biggest, such as the RMS &quot;Queen Mary 2&quot;, the biggest ocean liner in the world. Durban has built a brand new R200 million cruise terminal that has been in operation since October 2019, the Durban Cruise Terminal. The tender was awarded to KwaZulu Cruise Terminal (Pty) Ltd, which is 70% owned by MSC Cruises SA and 30% by Africa Armada Consortium. The new cruise terminal will be able to accommodate two cruise ships at any given time.

Naval Base Durban on Salisbury Island (now joined to the mainland and part of the Port of Durban), was established as a naval base during the Second World War. It was downgraded in 2002 to a naval station. In 2012 a decision was made to renovate and expand the facilities back up to a full naval base to accommodate the South African Navy&#x27;s offshore patrol flotilla. In December 2015 it was redesignated Naval Base Durban.

=== Rail ===
Durban featured the first operating steam railway in South Africa when the Natal Railway Company started operating a line between the Point and the city of Durban in 1860.

Shosholoza Meyl, the passenger rail service of Spoornet, operates two long-distance passenger rail services from Durban: a daily service to and from Johannesburg via Pietermaritzburg and Newcastle, and a weekly service to and from Cape Town via Kimberley and Bloemfontein. These trains terminate at Durban railway station.

Metrorail operates a commuter rail service in Durban and the surrounding area. The Metrorail network runs from Durban Station outwards as far as KwaDukuza on the North Coast, Kelso on the South Coast, and Cato Ridge inland.

A high-speed rail link has been proposed; this link would Johannesburg and Durban.

=== Roads ===
The city&#x27;s main position as a port of entry onto the southern African continent has led to the development of national roads around it. The N3 Western Freeway, which links Durban with the economic hinterland of Gauteng, heads west out of the city. The N2 Outer Ring Road links Durban with the Eastern Cape to the south, and Mpumalanga in the north. The Western Freeway is particularly important because freight is shipped by truck to and from the Witwatersrand for transfer to the port.

The N3 Western Freeway starts in the central business district and heads west under Tollgate Bridge and through the suburbs of Sherwood and Mayville. The EB Cloete Interchange (which is informally nicknamed the Spaghetti Junction) lies to the west of Durban and east of Westville, allowing for transfer of traffic between the N2 Outer Ring Road and the Western Freeway.

The N2 Outer Ring Road cuts through the city from the north coast to the south coast. It provides a vital link to the coastal towns (such as eManzimtoti, Kingsburgh, Scottburgh, eMkhomazi, Ballito and KwaDukuza) that rely on Durban.

Durban also has a system of freeway and dual arterial metropolitan routes, which connect the sprawling suburbs that lie to the north, west and south of the city. The M4 exists in two segments. The northern segment, named the Ruth First Highway and Leo Boyd Highway, starts as an alternative highway from the R102 in Ballito and shortly after intersects the N2. It passes through the seaside towns and villages of La Mercy and eMdloti before becoming a dual carriageway in uMhlanga, north of Durban and ending at the northern edge of the CBD. The southern segment of the M4, the Inkosi Albert Lutuli Highway, starts at the southern edge of the CBD, connecting through to the old, decommissioned Durban International Airport, where it once again reconnects at the southern end of the N2 Outer Ring Road.

The M7 connects the southern industrial basin of Durban with the N3 and Pinetown via Queensburgh via the N2. The M19 connects the inner northern suburbs of Durban with Pinetown via Westville and the M41 connects uMhlanga and Phoenix via Mount Edgecombe and the N2.

The M13 (King Cetshwayo Highway) is an untolled alternative to the N3 Western Freeway (which is tolled at Mariannhill) and is an important commuter route linking the nearby towns and suburbs to the west of Durban such as Hillcrest, Gillitts, Kloof, Pinetown and Westville to the city.

In the late 2000s, 107 streets in Durban were renamed. They were typically renamed to honour individuals involved in the anti-apartheid or international revolutionary movements, with two-thirds of the streets named after individuals associated with the governing African National Congress. This was done in two stages; a first, smaller one, which renamed eighteen streets and was met with some trepidation by opposition parties, particularly the Democratic Alliance, the Inkatha Freedom Party, and the Minority Front, and a second, larger stage, which renamed 99 streets and was met with considerably wider opposition after the controversy of the first and the minimal time between them. The first group was met with some opposition from This process was met with outrage from both opposition parties and the parts of the general public, as well as incidents of vandalism against the new road signs. The Democratic Alliance, Inkatha Freedom Party, and Minority Front were concerned with their lack of participation in the process, and that the emphasis on individuals affiliated with the ANC presented a partisan image of the anti-apartheid struggle. Among the general public there was significant opposition from middle-class white South Africans, Indian South Africans, and Zulu nationalists, who believed that the new names should have a connection to the people and the history of the locality. In response, the ANC characterized the project as a transformation and part of progressive social change, characterizing their opponents as being &quot;antitransformation&quot; and &quot;pro-apartheid&quot;.

=== Buses ===
Several companies run long-distance bus services from Durban to the other cities in South Africa. Buses have a long history in Durban. Most of them have been run by Indian owners since the early 1930s. Privately owned buses that are not subsidised by the government also service the communities. Buses operate in all areas of the eThekwini Municipality. Since 2003 buses have been violently taken out of the routes and bus ranks by taxi operators.

Durban was previously served by the Durban trolleybus system, which ran from 1935 until 1968.

Since 2017, the newer Durban People Mover Bus System that runs along certain routes has been testing out free Wi-Fi for passengers.

=== Taxis ===
Durban has two kinds of taxis: metered taxis and minibus taxis. Unlike in many cities, metered taxis are not allowed to drive around the city to solicit fares and instead must be called and ordered to a specific location. A number of companies service the Durban and surrounding regions. These taxis can also be called upon for airport transfers, point to point pickups and shuttles.

Mini bus taxis are the standard form of transport for the majority of the population who cannot afford private cars. With the high demand for transport by the working class of South Africa, minibus taxis are often filled over their legal passenger allowance, making for high casualty rates when they are involved in accidents. Minibuses are generally owned and operated in fleets, and inter-operator violence flares up from time to time, especially as turf wars over lucrative taxi routes occur.

Ride sharing apps Uber and Taxify have been launched in Durban and are also used by commuters.

=== Rickshaws ===
Although rickshaws have been a mode of transportation since the early 1900s, they have been displaced by other forms of motorised transport. The roughly 25 remaining rickshaws mostly cater to tourists.

== Crime and safety ==
Compared to other South African cities, Durban has a high murder rate. Between April 2018 and March 2019, the Ethekwini Metropolitan Municipality recorded 1,871 murders, gradually increasing from 1,349 seven years earlier and down from 2,042 in 2009.

Criminals usually avoid targeting tourists because they know that the police response will be greater.

Heist or theft is a common crime in the city. Most houses are protected by high walls and wealthier residents are often able to afford greater protection such as electric fencing, private security or gated communities. Crime rates vary widely across the city and most inner suburbs have much lower murder rates than in outlying areas of Ethekwini. Police station precincts recording the lowest murder rates per 100,000 in 2017 were Durban North (7), Mayville (8), Westville (12) and Malvern (12); while some of the most dangerous areas were Kwamashu (76) and Umlazi (69). Other crime comparisons are less valuable due to significant under-reporting especially in outlying areas.

There was a period of intense violence beginning in the 1990s, and the Durban area recorded a murder rate of 83 per 100,000 in 1999. The murder rate dropped rapidly in the 2000s before increasing rapidly throughout the 2010s. Durban is one of the main drug trafficking routes for drugs exiting and entering sub-Saharan Africa. The drug trade has increased significantly over the past 20 years.

<text>The Twenty-One Demands (; ) was a set of demands made during the First World War by the Empire of Japan under Prime Minister Ōkuma Shigenobu to the government of the Republic of China on 18 January 1915. The secret demands would greatly extend Japanese control of China. Japan would keep the former German areas it had conquered at the start of World War I in 1914 and would be strong in Manchuria and South Mongolia while having an expanded role in railways. The most extreme demands (in section 5) would give Japan a decisive voice in finance, policing, and government affairs. The last part would make China in effect a protectorate of Japan, and thereby reduce Western influence.

Japan was in a strong position during the course of the war as the Allies were in a stalemate with their rivals, the Central Powers. Britain and Japan had a military alliance since 1902, and in 1914 London had asked Tokyo to enter the war. Beijing published the secret demands and it had angered those in Washington and London. They were sympathetic and forced Tokyo to drop section 5 in the final 1916 settlement. Japan gained little in China and lost a great deal of prestige and trust from both Britain and the United States.

The Chinese public responded with a spontaneous nationwide boycott of Japanese goods; Japan&#x27;s exports to China fell drastically. Britain was affronted and no longer trusted Japan as an ally. With the First World War underway, Japan&#x27;s position was strong and Britain&#x27;s was weak; nevertheless, Britain (and the United States) forced Japan to drop the fifth set of demands that would have given Japan a large measure of control over the entire Chinese economy and ended the Open Door Policy. Japan and China reached a series of agreements which ratified the first four sets of goals on 25 May 1915.

== Background ==

Japan had gained a large sphere of influence in northern China and Manchuria through its victories in the First Sino-Japanese War and the Russo-Japanese War, and had thus joined the ranks of the European imperialist powers in their scramble to establish political and economic domination over Imperial China under the Qing dynasty. With the overthrow of the Qing dynasty in the Xinhai Revolution, and the subsequent establishment of the new Republic of China, Japan saw an opportunity to further expand its position in China.

The German Empire was in control of Shandong province as part of the Kiautschou Bay concession since 1898. With the onset of the First World War, Japan declared war against Germany on 23 August 1914. Japanese and British forces quickly seized all German holdings in the Far East, after the Siege of Tsingtao.

== Initial negotiations ==

Japan, under Prime Minister Ōkuma Shigenobu and Foreign Minister Katō Takaaki, drafted the initial list of Twenty-One Demands, which were reviewed by the &quot;genrō&quot; and Emperor Taishō, and approved by the Diet. Ambassador Hioki Eki delivered the list to President Yuan Shikai of the Beiyang government in a private audience on 18 January 1915, with warnings of dire consequences if China were to reject them.

The Twenty One Demands were divided into five groups:

* Group 1 (four demands) confirmed Japan&#x27;s recent seizure of German ports and operations in Shandong Province, and expanded Japan&#x27;s sphere of influence over the railways, coasts and major cities of the province.
* Group 2 (seven demands) pertained to Japan&#x27;s South Manchuria Railway Zone, extending the leasehold over the territory for 99 years, and expanding Japan&#x27;s sphere of influence in southern Manchuria and eastern Inner Mongolia, to include rights of settlement and extraterritoriality, appointment of financial and administrative officials to the government and priority for Japanese investments in those areas. Japan demanded access to Inner Mongolia for raw materials, as a manufacturing site, and as a strategic buffer against Russian encroachment in Korea. 
* Group 3 (two demands) gave Japan control of the Han-Ye-Ping (Hanyang, Daye, and Pingxiang) mining and metallurgical complex in central China; it was deep in debt to Japan. 
* Group 4 (one demand) barred China from giving any further coastal or island concessions to foreign powers.
* Group 5 (seven demands) was the most aggressive. China was to hire Japanese advisors who could take effective control of China&#x27;s finance and police. Japan would be empowered to build three major railways, and also Buddhist temples and schools. Japan would gain effective control of Fujian, across the Taiwan Strait from Taiwan, which had been ceded to Japan in 1895.

Knowing the negative reaction &quot;Group 5&quot; would cause, Japan initially tried to keep its contents secret. The Chinese government attempted to stall for as long as possible and leaked the full contents of the Twenty-One Demands to European powers in the hope that due to a perceived threat to their own political and economic spheres of interest, they would help contain Japan.

==Japanese ultimatum ==
After China rejected Japan&#x27;s revised proposal on 26 April 1915, the &quot;genrō&quot; intervened and deleted ‘Group 5’ from the document, as these had proved to be the most objectionable to the Chinese government. A reduced set of &quot;Thirteen Demands&quot; was transmitted on May 7 in the form of an ultimatum, with a two-day deadline for response. Yuan Shikai was not in a position to risk war with Japan, and accepted appeasement, a tactic followed by his successors. The final form of the treaty was signed by both parties on May 25, 1915.
Katō Takaaki publicly admitted that the ultimatum was invited by Yuan to save face with the Chinese people in conceding to the Demands. American Minister Paul Reinsch reported to the US State Department that the Chinese were surprised at the leniency of the ultimatum, as it demanded much less than they had already committed themselves to concede.

== Consequences ==

The results of the revised final (Thirteen Demands) version of the Twenty-One Demands were far more negative for Japan than positive. Without &quot;Group 5&quot;, the new treaty gave Japan little more than it already had in China.

On the other hand, the United States expressed strongly negative reactions to Japan&#x27;s rejection of the Open Door Policy. In the Bryan Note issued by Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan on 13 March 1915, the U.S., while affirming Japan&#x27;s &quot;special interests&quot; in Manchuria, Mongolia and Shandong, expressed concern over further encroachments to Chinese sovereignty.

Great Britain, Japan&#x27;s closest ally, expressed concern over what was perceived as Japan&#x27;s overbearing, bullying approach to diplomacy, and the British Foreign Office in particular was unhappy with Japanese attempts to establish what would effectively be a Japanese protectorate over all of China.

Afterwards, Japan and the United States looked for a compromise; as a result, the Lansing–Ishii Agreement was concluded in 1917. It was approved by the Paris Peace Conference in 1919.

Japan continued to push for outright control over Shandong Province and won European diplomatic recognition for their claim at the Treaty of Versailles (despite the refusal of the Chinese delegation to sign the treaty). This, in turn, provoked ill-will from the United States government, as well as widespread hostility within China; a large-scale boycott against Japanese goods was just one effect. In 1922, the U.S. brokered a solution: China was awarded nominal sovereignty over all of Shandong, while in practice Japan&#x27;s economic dominance continued.

In China, the overall political impact of Japan&#x27;s actions was highly negative, creating a considerable amount of public ill-will towards Japan, contributing to the May Fourth Movement, and a significant upsurge in nationalism.

<doc id="313656" wikidata="Q913932" url="?curid=313656" title="Bridgewater Canal">
<text>The Bridgewater Canal connects Runcorn, Manchester and Leigh, in North West England. It was commissioned by Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater, to transport coal from his mines in Worsley to Manchester. It was opened in 1761 from Worsley to Manchester, and later extended from Manchester to Runcorn, and then from Worsley to Leigh.

The canal is connected to the Manchester Ship Canal via a lock at Cornbrook; to the Rochdale Canal in Manchester; to the Trent and Mersey Canal at Preston Brook, southeast of Runcorn; and to the Leeds and Liverpool Canal at Leigh. It once connected with the River Mersey at Runcorn but has since been cut off by a slip road to the Silver Jubilee Bridge. Following the re-routing of roads to the Silver Jubilee Bridge, the Runcorn Locks Restoration Society campaigns to reinstate the flight of locks.

The Bridgewater Canal is described as the first great achievement of the canal age, although the Sankey Canal opened earlier. Bridgewater captured the public imagination because of its engineering feats; it required the construction of an aqueduct to cross the River Irwell, and a tunnel at Worsley. Its success helped inspire a period of intense canal building in Britain, known as Canal Mania. It later faced intense competition from the Liverpool and Manchester Railway and the Macclesfield Canal. Navigable throughout its history, it is one of the few canals in Britain not to have been nationalised, and remains privately owned. Pleasure craft now use the canal which forms part of the Cheshire Ring network of canals.

== Design and construction ==
Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater, owned some of the coal mines dug to supply North West England with fuel for the steam engines instrumental in powering England&#x27;s Industrial Revolution. The duke transported his coal along the Mersey and Irwell Navigation and also by packhorse, but each method was inefficient and expensive; river transport was subject to the vagaries of river navigation, and the amount of coal packhorses could carry was limited by its relative weight. The duke&#x27;s underground mines also suffered from persistent flooding, caused by the geology of the Middle Coal Measures, where the coal seam lies beneath a layer of permeable sandstone.
Having visited the Canal du Midi in France and watched the construction of the Sankey Canal in England, the duke&#x27;s solution to these problems was to build an underground canal at Worsley, connected to a surface canal between Worsley and Salford. In addition to easing overland transport difficulties and providing drainage for his mines, an underground canal would provide a reliable source of water for the surface canal, and also eliminate the need to lift the coal to the surface (an expensive and difficult proposition). The canal boats would carry at a time, pulled by only one horse – more than ten times the amount of cargo per horse that was possible with a cart. The duke and his estate manager John Gilbert produced a plan of the canal, and in 1759 obtained an act of Parliament, the (32 Geo. 2. c. &quot;2&quot;), enabling its construction.
James Brindley was brought in for his technical expertise (having previously installed a pumping system at the nearby Wet Earth Colliery), and after a six-day visit suggested varying the route of the proposed canal away from Salford, instead taking it across the River Irwell to Stretford and thereon into Manchester. This route would make connecting to any future canals much easier, and would also increase competition with the Mersey and Irwell Navigation company. Brindley moved into Worsley Old Hall and spent 46 days surveying the proposed route, which to cross the Irwell would require the construction of an aqueduct at Barton-upon-Irwell. At the duke&#x27;s behest, in January 1760 Brindley also travelled to London to give evidence before a parliamentary committee. The duke therefore gained a second act of Parliament, the (33 Geo. 2. c. &quot;2&quot;), which superseded the original.

Brindley&#x27;s planned route began at Worsley and passed southeast through Eccles, before turning south to cross the River Irwell on the Barton Aqueduct. From there it continued southeast along the edge of Trafford Park, and then east into Manchester. Although a connection with the Mersey and Irwell Navigation was included in the new act, at Hulme Locks in Castlefield (on land previously occupied by Hulme Hall), this was not completed until 1838. The terminus would be at Castlefield Basin, where the nearby River Medlock was to help supply the canal with water. Boats would unload their cargoes inside the duke&#x27;s purpose-built warehouse. There were no locks in Brindley&#x27;s design, demonstrating his ability as a competent engineer. The Barton Aqueduct was built relatively quickly for the time; work commenced in September 1760 and the first boat crossed on 17 July 1761.

The duke invested a large sum of money in the scheme. From Worsley to Manchester its construction cost £168,000 (equivalent to £ in ), but its advantages over land and river transport meant that within a year of its opening in 1761, the price of coal in Manchester fell by about half. This success helped inspire a period of intense canal building, known as Canal Mania. Along with its stone aqueduct at Barton-upon-Irwell, the Bridgewater Canal was considered a major engineering achievement. One commentator wrote that when finished, &quot;[the canal] will be the most extraordinary thing in the Kingdom, if not in Europe. The boats in some places are to go underground, and in other places over a navigable river, without communicating with its waters&quot;.

In addition to the duke&#x27;s warehouse at Manchester, more buildings were built by Brindley and extended to Alport Street (now called Deansgate). The warehouses were of timber-frame design, with load-bearing hand-made brick walls, supported on cast iron posts. The duke&#x27;s warehouse was badly damaged by fire in 1789 but was rebuilt.
=== Manchester to Runcorn extension ===

In September 1761, with his assistant Hugh Oldham, Brindley surveyed an extension from Longford Bridge to Hempstones, near Halton, Cheshire. He assisted in obtaining parliamentary approval for the (2 Geo. 3. c. &quot;11&quot;) which allowed the construction of an extension to the canal, from Manchester, to the River Mersey at Runcorn. Despite objections from the Mersey and Irwell Navigation Company, Royal assent was given on 24 March 1762. A junction, Waters Meeting, was created in Trafford Park, at which the new extension branched south through Stretford, Sale, Altrincham, Lymm and finally to Runcorn.

In December 1761 Brindley undertook a survey of the route at Runcorn. His initial plan was to make the terminus at Hempstones, east of Runcorn Gap, but following a study of the tides and depth of water there, he decided instead to build the terminus west of Runcorn Gap. This change was designed to accommodate Mersey flats, although the low fixed bridges required that traffic on the canal be able to lower or unship their masts. Runcorn basin was almost above the Mersey, so a flight of ten locks, described as &quot;the wonder of their time&quot;, was built to connect the two. Nine locks had a fall of , with a fall at the river lock of more than at low water. It allowed vessels to enter and leave the canal on any tide. The connection to the Mersey was made on 1 January 1773. The river&#x27;s tidal action tended to deposit silt around the lower entrance to the locks, so to counteract this a channel, equipped with gates at each end and known as the Duke&#x27;s Gut, was cut through the marshes upriver from the locks. At high tide the gates were closed, and with the ebb of the tide were opened to release water, which scoured the silt from the entrance to the locks. The cut created an island, known as Runcorn Island, crossed by Castle Bridge.


The connection to Manchester was delayed by Sir Richard Brooke of Norton Priory. Concerned that boatmen might poach his game and wildfowl, Brooke did not want the canal to pass through his land. The act included several stipulations: the canal should not come within of his house; the towpath should be on the south side of the canal, furthest away from Brooke&#x27;s house; there should be no quays, buildings, hedges or fences to obstruct the view; no vessels were to be moored within of the house, other than during construction. Eventually, though, a compromise was reached. This included the construction of a link to the Trent and Mersey Canal at Preston Brook (permitted by the Trent and Mersey Canal Act 1766), and the building of the canal&#x27;s terminus to the west of Runcorn Gap. The Trent and Mersey link gave the Duke access to the Midlands, and forestalled the Weaver Trustees from making their own junction with the canal. The new extension also met with opposition from the Mersey and Irwell Navigation, until the duke purchased a controlling interest in the company. The first part of the new extension was opened in 1767, and completed in full by March 1776, but Brindley did not live to see its completion; it was continued by his brother-in-law, Hugh Henshall.

The total cost of the canal, from Worsley to Manchester and from Longford Bridge to the Mersey at Runcorn, was £220,000. Alongside the Mersey, the duke built Runcorn Dock, several warehouses, and Bridgewater House, a temporary home from which he could supervise operations at the Runcorn end. Two locks up from the tideway was a small dry dock.

=== Sale to Stockport branch ===

In 1766 the duke gained a fourth act of Parliament, the (6 Geo. 3. c. &quot;17&quot;) for a branch canal between Sale Moor and Stockport which was to follow the valley of the Mersey. The act was applied for to counter a proposed canal that would give the towns of Stockport and Macclesfield access to the Mersey, via the River Weaver. The work was not done, the act lapsed and this section of canal was never built.

Over two decades later, the nearby Manchester Bolton &amp; Bury Canal had sought a connection to other waterways, and it appears that the duke had planned to limit the activities of the new company. On 15 December 1792 the duke purchased a portion of the Ringspiggot estate in Salford which blocked the MB&amp;BC&#x27;s plans to build a riverside basin and wharfs there.

=== Worsley to Leigh extension ===
In 1795 the duke secured a fifth act, the (35 Geo. 3. c. 44), which enabled him to extend the canal a further from Worsley via Boothstown, Astley Green and Bedford to Leigh. The new extension enabled the supply to Manchester of coal from Leigh and the surrounding districts. On 21 June 1819 an act of Parliament was enacted to create a link between this extension and the Leeds and Liverpool Canal at Wigan.

Access to the canal brought about a rapid development in coal mining on the Manchester Coalfield west of Worsley. Chaddock pits in the east of Tyldesley were connected to an underground level from Worsley. In 1820, to ease congestion at the Delph in Worsley, Chaddock Pit was connected to the canal at Boothstown basin by an underground canal, the Chaddock Level which ran in a north west direction from the canal at Boothstown to the pit. Sometime after 1840 Samuel Jackson built a narrow gauge tramroad worked by horses from his Gin Pit Colliery to Marsland Green where he installed cranes and tipplers to load barges at a wharf. The tramroad was later worked by locomotives. In 1867 the Fletchers built a private railway line and the Bedford Basin with facilities for loading coal from Howe Bridge onto barges. Astley Green Colliery began winding coal on the north bank of the canal in 1912. In the 1940s and &#x27;50s coal was sent to Barton Power Station and Runcorn Gas Works.

=== Connection to Rochdale Canal ===


Upon completion of the Rochdale Canal in 1804, the two canals were joined at Castlefield. This connection may have been a factor in the failure of the Manchester Bolton &amp; Bury Canal Company&#x27;s rival scheme to build a canal between Bury and Sladen. The River Medlock, a major source of water for the canal and which was almost as badly polluted as the nearby Irwell, was diverted through a tunnel under the canal at Castlefield by Charles Edward Cawley, a civil engineer for the Salford Corporation and later a Member of Parliament (MP) for Salford. The canal was from that point supplied by the much purer water of the Rochdale Canal.

=== Mines ===

Worsley Delph, in Worsley, originally a centuries-old sandstone quarry near Worsley Brook, was the entrance to the Navigable Levels. It is now a Scheduled Monument. Two entrances, built years apart, allow access to the specially built M-boats (also known as Starvationers), the largest of which could carry of coal. Inside the mines of underground canal on four levels, linked by inclined planes, were constructed. The mines ceased production in 1887. As the canal passes through Worsley, iron oxide from the mines has, for many years, stained the water bright orange. The removal of this colouration is currently the subject of a £2.5 million remedial scheme.

=== Traffic ===
In 1791 the mines at Worsley produced of coal, of which were &quot;sold down the navigation&quot;; of rocksalt was also transported from Cheshire. Sales of coal were £19,455, and nearly £30,000 was earned from other cargoes. Passenger traffic in 1791 brought in receipts of £3,781.

The canal also carried passengers and was in keen competition with the Mersey and Irwell Navigation Company (M&amp;IN). The journey down river by the latter route took eight hours (nine hours in the up direction) while the journey on the Bridgewater Canal took nine hours each way. Fares were similar but the Bridgewater route was said to be &quot;more picturesque&quot;. Boating men also used the canal. They lifted their small lightweight boats out of the M&amp;IN at Runcorn, and carried them a short distance up the steep streets onto the Bridgewater Canal.

Barges on the canal continued to be towed by horses until the middle of the 19th century, when they were replaced by steam-powered boats after a fatal epidemic spread through the horse population. The &quot;dense smoke&quot; produced by the steam barges and their &quot;harsh unnecessary whistling&quot; proved unpopular with some local residents, who also began to suffer from a condition known as canal throat, &quot;no doubt caused by the foul emanations given off by its [the Bridgewater Canal&#x27;s] horribly filthy water&quot;.

The canal carried commercial freight traffic until 1975; the last regular cargo was grain from Liverpool to Manchester for BOCM. It is now used mainly by pleasure craft and hosts two rowing clubs – Trafford Rowing Club and Manchester University Boat Club.

The Duke of Bridgewater died on 8 March 1803. By his will the income from the canal was to be paid to his nephew George Leveson-Gower, the Marquess of Stafford (later the 1st Duke of Sutherland). On his death it was to go to Stafford&#x27;s second son Francis, provided he changed his name to Egerton; and then to his heirs and successors. The management of the company was placed in the hands of three trustees. These were Sir Archibald Macdonald, who was Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer, Edward Venables-Vernon-Harcourt, at the time the Bishop of Carlisle and later the Archbishop of York, and, as Superintendent, Robert Haldane Bradshaw, the Duke&#x27;s agent. Bradshaw managed the estate, for which he received a salary of £2,000 a year and the use of the duke&#x27;s mansions at Worsley and Runcorn. The other two trustees had each married nieces of the duke and were &quot;dummy trustees&quot;.

During the time the canal was administered by the Bridgewater Trustees, it made a profit every year. Until his retirement in 1834, the administration was carried out entirely by Bradshaw. It has been calculated that the average annual profit between 1806 and 1826 was of the order of 13 per cent, and in 1824, the best year, it was 23 per cent. Bradshaw found it difficult to delegate, and complained of being over-worked, but he was also regarded as being a &quot;formidable bargainer&quot;. In 1805 he was approached by the proprietors of the nearby Manchester Bolton &amp; Bury Canal to resolve a dispute with a Salford landowner, but his response was delayed. In 1810 there was a general agreement with the Mersey and Irwell Navigation Company (M&amp;IN) to simultaneously raise freight charges. However any cooperation between the two companies was short-lived and by 1812 the Mersey and Irwell had reduced their charges. Further competition was to come from other carriers who used the canal; in 1824 the traffic carried by private companies exceeded that carried by the Trustees for the first time. However, in time more profit came from &quot;tonnage traffic&quot; (that carried by private companies) than from the Bridgewater&#x27;s own carriage of freight. Bradshaw&#x27;s administration saw increased deterioration of the fabric of the canal, the locks, docks and warehouses. The undertakings were starved of capital largely owing to inadequate provision for it in the duke&#x27;s will. There were also problems caused by silting around the entrance to the Mersey and by the changing channels of the river itself.

During the 1820s there was increased dissatisfaction with the canals. They did not cope well with increasing volumes of cargo, and they were perceived as monopolistic, and the preserve of the landed gentry class. There was increased interest in the possibility of railway construction. The possible construction of a railway between Liverpool and Manchester was vigorously opposed by Bradshaw, who refused railway surveyors access to land owned by the trustees. When the first bill was presented to Parliament in 1825, the trustees opposed and it was overthrown. However, later in the year Lord Stafford, possibly persuaded to do so by William Huskisson, invested £100,000 (one-fifth of the required capital), in the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. Following this the trustees withdrew their opposition to the construction of the railway; they did not petition against the second bill, which was passed in 1826. At the same time as he made his investment in the railway, Lord Stafford advanced £40,000 for improvements to the canal. This was spent mainly on a second line of locks at Runcorn, which were completed in 1828, plus new warehouses at Manchester and Liverpool. The additional line of locks cost £35,000 and was used for traffic heading to Manchester, while the old line was used for traffic passing down to the Mersey.

In 1830 the new railway opened and by the end of the year was carrying freight. Bradshaw immediately went into competition by lowering the rates of carriage on the canal and by offering improved terms to the private carriers. By so doing he managed to maintain the volume of traffic carried by the canal, both freight and passengers, at a time when the country was suffering a trade depression. However Bradshaw&#x27;s tactics led to a sharp decline in profits. At the same time costs were rising, partly due to the use of steamboats on the Mersey. Further competition came with the opening of the Macclesfield Canal in 1831 which gave separate access to Manchester from the Midlands. In November 1831 Bradshaw suffered a stroke, as a result of which he lost the use of his left arm and leg, and there is evidence that it also impaired his judgement.

Matters came to a head in 1833, the year in which the canal made its lowest profit since the death of the Duke. On 19 July the Marquess of Stafford (now the 1st Duke of Sutherland) died and the profits from the canal passed to Francis Egerton. On 25 September Bradshaw&#x27;s son, Captain James Bradshaw, who had been acting as a deputy superintendent to the trustees, and who had been expected to succeed his father as superintendent, committed suicide. The agent for both Francis Egerton and his older brother, who was now the 2nd Duke of Sutherland, was James Loch. The events that followed were &quot;stage-managed by Loch&quot;. He reported to Francis Egerton that Bradshaw was no longer fit to be superintendent, and then persuaded Bradshaw to retire on his full salary. It had been expected that he would appoint his other son, William Rigby Bradshaw, as his successor, but Loch persuaded him to appoint James Sothern in the position; Sothern had been the principal agent of the trust since December 1832. He took over the position of superintendent on 3 February 1834. The appointment of Sothern was not a success. Charges were made against him of dishonesty and of nepotism. He entered into disputes and disagreements with Loch, with Francis Egerton, and with the other two trustees. (Sir Archibald Macdonald had died in 1826; by this time his place had been taken by the 10th Earl of Devon). To avoid a costly lawsuit, at the end of 1836 Sothern agreed to retire on various conditions which included receipt of £45,000. On 1 March 1837, he was succeeded as superintendent by James Loch.

Loch was extremely busy and did not have time to deal with the detailed administration of the Trust. He therefore looked for a deputy to take on these duties. His first choice was Richard Smith who was the mine agent to the Trustees of the 1st Earl of Dudley. However this was perceived as poaching and it led to such controversy that Smith declined the offer and recommended his son, George Samuel Fereday Smith for the post. Fereday Smith was appointed as Deputy Superintendent in March 1837 on a salary of £600 a year, half of the salary which had been offered to his father. Loch immediately undertook a reorganisation of the administration and efficiency of the business, restored the agreement with the Old Quay Company to raise freight charges, and improved the facilities for passengers, including the introduction of &quot;swift boats&quot;. By 1837, the trustees employed around 3,000 people (including those working in the colliery and in Worsley Yard), making it one of the largest employers in the country at the time. Since the death of the Duke the amount of freight carried by the canal had almost trebled; in 1803 it carried of goods and in 1836 .

In 1843 a new dock, the Francis Dock, was opened at Runcorn. The late 1830s and early 1840s had seen increased competition between the Bridgewater Canal on the one hand, and other canal companies and the railways on the other. The most dangerous of the rivals was the Mersey and Irwell Navigation Company who started to reduce their rates again in 1840. This led to a price war between the two canal companies and the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, who had previously cooperated on rates. Eventually, in desperation, the Bridgewater Trustees bought the Mersey and Irwell and took over its ownership on 1 January 1844. During the same year competition with other canals was further reduced by agreements made with the Ellesmere and Chester Canal Company and with the Anderton Carrying Company. In 1844 the canal made a profit of £76,410, the second highest during the time it was administered by the Trustees.

Having seen off competition from other canal companies, the next major threat was to come from the railways. This was the period in the mid-1840s known as the Railway Mania. The railways competed with the canals in three ways; by building, or threatening to build, new lines which would be in direct competition with the canals; by amalgamation into giant companies (such as the Midland and the London and North Western companies), which gave them more political power; and by taking over ownership of canal companies. On 13 April 1844 &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper reported that the canal was to be emptied of water, and converted into a railway, although nothing came of this scheme. In 1845, in return for concessions, the trustees supported the Grand Junction Railway in its campaign to build a more direct line to Liverpool, which crossed the Mersey over a bridge at Runcorn Gap. However the bill was overthrown in the House of Lords. Competition from the railways and other canals led to a decline in the trading and the profits between 1845 and 1848, but there was no &quot;disastrous collapse&quot;. During this time the Trustees and their representatives were engaged in vigorous campaigns in Parliament to protect their interests.

By October 1844 a bonding warehouse had been built in Manchester and the first cargo to arrive was announced in a letter to the &quot;Manchester Guardian,&quot; later printed in &quot;The Times:&quot;

However, this venture was less successful than expected, as is evidenced by a letter to &quot;The Observer&quot; later that year, also printed in &quot;The Times&quot;:

Between 1849 and 1851 the competition between the Trustees and the railway companies intensified. Agreements and alliances were made and broken. Their major opponents were the London and North Western Railway and the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway who reduced tariffs and took business away from the canals. For the first time the railways carried more trade between Liverpool and the towns of central Lancashire than the canals. The value of the traffic carried by the Bridgewater Canal in 1851 was the lowest in the time it was administered by the Trustees. In 1851 the Earl of Ellesmere hosted a visit to Manchester by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. They stayed at Worsley Hall, with a view of the canal, and were given a trip between Patricroft railway station and Worsley Hall, on state barges. Large crowds had gathered to cheer the royal party, which apparently frightened the horses drawing the barge so much that they fell into the canal.

The Trustees spent much time between 1851 and 1855 in negotiations to ease the competition, especially that from the London and North Western Railway. The most likely allies seemed to be other railway companies, including the Shrewsbury and Birmingham and the Shrewsbury and Chester railway companies, and the Great Western Railway. Of these, the most likely seemed to be the Great Western Railway who, in their concern to expand northwards were willing to help the Trustees with the carriage of their traffic to the south. However years of negotiations came to no agreement and, in the end, the Trustees&#x27; railway deal was done with the London and North Western Railway, who agreed to cooperate with the onward passage of the Trustees&#x27; traffic.

On 28 June 1855 James Loch, the Superintendent, died and was succeeded by Hon. Algernon Fulke Egerton, Lord Ellesmere&#x27;s third son. He was then aged 29, and had been educated at Harrow and Christ Church, Oxford; he had been destined for a political life and had no experience of managing coal mines or canals. Since James Loch had been appointed, he had been mainly in control of the management of the Trustees, assisted by his son George Loch. During this time the role of Fereday Smith had been diminished; initially appointed as Deputy Superintendent, his position was reduced to that of Principal Agent in 1845. With the arrival of the inexperienced Algernon Egerton, Fereday Smith had a much greater say in the management. During the previous four years the Lochs had been reluctant to invest in improvements to the canal or Runcorn Dock, despite the increasing demand for the passage of goods through the dock, and the profits made during these years became stagnant. Fereday Smith had been keen on expansion and now his opportunity came. He first reduced the top-heavy administration of the Trust, and then took on the planning of the expansion of the business. The steamers owned by the Trustees had been neglected and were in a poor state; these were repaired or sold.

George Loch, who had been opposed to using the Trustees&#x27; investments for improvements to the canals or docks, died in 1857. Between 1857 and 1872 the Trustees provided more capital for improvements from their own resources than at any previous time. The Runcorn and Weston Canal was built in 1858–59, providing a connection between Runcorn Docks and the Weaver Navigation. A new half tide dock, the Alfred Dock was opened at Runcorn in 1860. Electric telegraph was installed in 1861–62.

In 1862 the 2nd Earl of Ellesmere died and his son and heir, the 3rd Earl was a minor, aged 15. This gave Algernon Egerton even more power to invest the profits of the company in developments. Negotiations were made to increase sea-borne trade, both British and foreign, through the canal. Building started on a new dock at Runcorn in 1867. Work was carried out in the Mersey estuary around the docks to improve access for vessels. Some of this was carried out in conjunction with the London and North Western Railway who were building a bridge across Runcorn Gap to take their line from Weaver Junction to Liverpool; the railway paid half the cost of the improvements, amounting to about £20,000 (£ today). Improvements were made to the Trustees&#x27; facilities at Liverpool, to the Mersey and Irwell Navigation and to the Bridgewater Canal itself. Agreements were made with the railway companies to cooperate on the transit of goods and the rates of carriage and &quot;the Trustees&#x27; fortunes entered a calmer phase&quot;.

== Subsequent owners ==


In 1872 the Bridgewater Navigation Company Ltd was formed, and on Monday 9 September the canal was purchased in the names of Sir Edward William Watkin and William Philip Price, respectively chairmen of the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway and the Midland Railway for £1,120,000. The canal was sold again in 1885, when the Manchester Ship Canal Company paid the Bridgewater Navigation Company £1,710,000 for all their property. The construction of the ship canal forced the removal of Barton Aqueduct and the construction of Barton Swing Aqueduct, as the former was too low for the vessels which would use the new canal. In 1907 the (7 Edw. 7. c. xv) was passed, permitting coal mining near the canal between Monton Bridge and Leigh, in exchange for which the mine owners were obliged to pay the associated costs of keeping the canal open and navigable.

In 1923 Bridgewater Estates Ltd was formed to acquire the Ellesmere family estate in Worsley. In 1984 Bridgewater Estates Ltd was purchased by a subsidiary of Peel Holdings. In 1987 Highams acquired a majority shareholding of the Manchester Ship Canal Company (subsequently the shares held by Highams were transferred to Peel Holdings). In 1994 the Manchester Ship Canal Company became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Peel Holdings group. In 2004 ownership of the Manchester Ship Canal Company was transferred to the Peel Ports group.

== Current status ==
Bridgewater is described as the first great achievement of the canal age. It captured the public imagination because of its engineering feats, including the aqueduct over the River Irwell and the tunnel at Worsley, but the first canal to be open to traffic was the Sankey Canal. Bridgewater now terminates in Runcorn basin, just before the disused flight of 10 locks which (before the approach road to the Silver Jubilee Bridge was built) used to lower the canal to the Runcorn Docks on the River Mersey and later, to the Manchester Ship Canal. The old line of locks in Runcorn fell into disuse in the late 1930s, and were closed under the Manchester Ship Canal Act 1949 (12, 13 &amp; 14 Geo. 6. c. xxxvi), and filled in. The Manchester Ship Canal Act 1966 (c. xxvii) allowed the closure and filling in of the newer line of locks. The duke&#x27;s warehouse in Manchester was demolished in 1960.

The canal has suffered four breaches: one soon after opening, another in 1971 near the River Bollin aqueduct, another in 2005 when a sluice gate failed in Manchester, and another near the River Bollin aqueduct, overnight on New Year&#x27;s Eve 2024. Cranes are located at intervals along the canal&#x27;s length to allow boards to be dropped into slots in the banks. These allow sections of the canal to be isolated in the event of a leak. The navigation is currently closed at Dunham as a result of the 2024 breach.

The canal now forms an integral part of the Cheshire Ring network of canals. Pleasure craft have been allowed on the canal since 1952.

The construction of the Mersey Gateway Bridge may allow a realignment of the bridge approach road and the restoration of the original flight of locks – thus re-opening the link to Runcorn Docks, the Runcorn and Weston Canal, the River Mersey, the Manchester Ship Canal, and the River Weaver. This would create a new ring route for leisure boats involving the Trent and Mersey Canal, the Anderton Boat Lift and the River Weaver.

The Hulme Locks Branch Canal in Manchester is now disused, and on 26 May 1995 was replaced by the nearby Pomona Lock.

The Bridgewater Way is a scheme to redevelop the canal and make it more accessible to users, particularly cyclists. The development, which includes a new towpath, will form part of the National Cycle and Footpath Network as Regional Route number 82.

<text>Guy Hughes Carawan Jr. (July 28, 1927 – May 2, 2015) was an American folk musician and musicologist. He served as music director and song leader for the Highlander Research and Education Center in New Market, Tennessee.

Carawan is famous for introducing the protest song &quot;We Shall Overcome&quot; to the American Civil Rights Movement, by teaching it to the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) in 1960. A union organizing song based on a black spiritual, it had been a favorite of Zilphia Horton (d. 1956) wife of the founder of the Highlander Folk School. Carawan reintroduced it at the school when he became its new music director in 1959. The song is copyrighted in the name of Horton, Frank Hamilton, Carawan and Pete Seeger.

Carawan sang and played banjo, guitar, and hammered dulcimer. He frequently performed and recorded with his wife, singer Candie Carawan. The couple had two children, Evan Carawan and Heather Carawan. Occasionally Guy was accompanied by their son Evan Carawan, who plays mandolin and hammered dulcimer. 

==Early life==
Carawan was born in California in 1927, to Southern parents. His mother, from Charleston, South Carolina, was the resident poet at Winthrop College (now Winthrop University) in Rock Hill, South Carolina, and his father, a veteran of World War I from North Carolina, worked as an asbestos contractor. He described his parents &quot;He was a poor farm boy and she was a Charlestonian blue blood&quot;. He earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in mathematics from Occidental College in 1949 and a master&#x27;s degree in sociology from UCLA. 

Through his friend Frank Hamilton, Carawan was introduced to musicians in the People&#x27;s Songs network, including Pete Seeger and The Weavers. Moving to New York City, he became involved with the American folk music revival in Greenwich Village in the 1950s. 

==Career at Highlander Center==
Carawan first visited the Highlander Folk School in 1953, with singers Ramblin&#x27; Jack Elliot and Frank Hamilton. At the recommendation of Pete Seeger, he returned in 1959 as a volunteer, taking charge of the music program pioneered by Zilphia Horton, who had died in an accident in 1956. 

Here is the story of how he got the Highlander position from Guy himself:&quot;I called Myles; I&#x27;d met him before. He said Highlander needed a musical director. My job would be to help get people singing and sharing their songs. When someone began to sing, I&#x27;d back them up softly on my guitar so they&#x27;d get courage and keep going. Sometimes in sharing a song, people find bonds between themselves that they never knew they had. I can&#x27;t tell you how many pictures I have of myself standing behind other people, accompanying them on the guitar. I took the job, just for a year--that was thirty years ago&quot; 

According to his wife Candie, one of Guy&#x27;s most important roles during the Civil Rights Movement — more so than introducing &quot;We Shall Overcome&quot; as a Freedom Song — was his desire to record and archive the evolution of the movement through song. Both Guy and Candie believe that the political usage of religious and folk music could shape movements and influence people to take action in social change, and Guy&#x27;s initiative to record and preserve the already established Freedom Songs within the movement are used to inspire and to educate future leaders and activists.

Movement leader Rev. C. T. Vivian, a lieutenant of Martin Luther King Jr. reminisced:

I don&#x27;t think we had ever thought of spirituals as movement material. When the movement came up, we couldn&#x27;t apply them. The concept has to be there. It wasn&#x27;t just to have the music but to take the music out of our past and apply it to the new situation, to change it so it really fit. ... The first time I remember any change in our songs was when Guy came down from Highlander. Here he was with this guitar and tall thin frame, leaning forward and patting that foot. I remember James Bevel and I looked across at each other and smiled. Guy had taken this song, &quot;Follow the Drinking Gourd&quot; – I didn&#x27;t know the song, but he gave some background on it and boom – that began to make sense. And, little by little, spiritual after spiritual began to appear with new words and changes: &quot;Keep Your Eyes on the Prize, Hold On&quot; or &quot;I&#x27;m Going to Sit at the Welcome Table&quot;. Once we had seen it done, we could begin to do it.

At Highlander&#x27;s April workshop, Carawan had met Candie Anderson, an exchange student at Fisk University in Nashville, from Pomona College in California, who was one of the first white students involved in the sit-in movement. As a couple they traveled the south hosting workshops to influence people to embrace in the Civil Rights Movement&#x27;s music.
They also travelled the world influencing activists. They visited England and attended the World Festival of Youth and Students in the Soviet Union in 1957, continuing onward to the People&#x27;s Republic of China. They married in March 1961.

Guy and Candie Carawan lived in New Market, near the Highlander Center. 

Guy remained the musical director at Highlander till his retirement in the late 1980s.

The Guy and Candie Carawan Collection (1955-2010) is located in the Southern Folklife Collection of the Wilson Library of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

<text>In Japanese mythology, the Seven Lucky Gods or Seven Gods of Fortune (, in Japanese) are believed to grant good luck and are often represented in netsuke and in artworks. One of the seven (Jurōjin) is said to be based on a historical figure.

They all began as remote and impersonal gods, but gradually became much closer canonical figures for certain professions and Japanese arts. During the course of their history, the mutual influence between gods has created confusion about which of them was the patron of certain professions. The worship of this group of gods is also due to the importance of the number seven in Japan, supposedly a signifier of good luck.

==Origin and history==

It is known that these deities mostly have their origins as ancient gods of fortune from religions popular in Japan: from Mahayana Buddhism (Benzaiten, Bishamonten, Daikokuten) which came to Japan from China but originated in India, and from Chinese Taoism (Fukurokuju, Hotei, Jurojin); except for one (Ebisu) who has a native Japanese ancestry.

These gods have been recognized as such for over a thousand years. In the beginning, these gods were worshiped by merchants as the first two (Ebisu and Daikokuten) were gods of business and trade.

Subsequently, other classes of Japanese society looked for gods that could correspond with their professions: Benzaiten as the patron of the arts, Fukurokuju as the patron of the sciences, and so on.

In ancient times, these gods were worshiped separately, but this rarely happens today – only when it is required for the god to act on behalf of the applicant.

The Seven Gods of Fortune started being mentioned as a collective in the year 1420 in Fushimi, in order to imitate the processions of the &quot;daimyōs&quot;, the feudal lords of pre-modern Japan.

It is said that the Buddhist priest Tenkai selected these gods after speaking with the &quot;shōgun&quot; he served, Iemitsu Tokugawa, at the order of seeking whoever possessed the perfect virtues: longevity, fortune, popularity, sincerity, kindness, dignity, and magnanimity.

Shortly after, a famous artist of the time, Kano Yasunobu, was ordained to portray these gods for the first time.

==Description of the Fukujin deities==

=== Ebisu ===

From the period of the gods Izanami and Izanagi, Ebisu (恵比寿) is the only one whose origins are purely Japanese. He is the god of prosperity and wealth in business, and of plenitude and abundance in crops, cereals and food in general. He is the patron of fishermen and therefore is represented with fishermen&#x27;s costumes such as a typical hat, a fishing rod in his right hand and a fish that can be either a carp, a hake, a codfish or a sea bass, or any large fish, in general, that symbolize abundance in meals (such as a feast or banquet). It is now common to see his figure in restaurants where fish is served in great quantities or in household kitchens.

=== Daikokuten ===

Daikokuten (大黒天) is the god of commerce and prosperity, and he is sometimes considered the patron of cooks, farmers and bankers, and a protector of crops. He is also considered a demon hunter − legend says that the god Daikokuten hung a sacred talisman on the branch of a tree in his garden and, by using this as a trap, was able to catch a demon. This god is characterized by his smile, his short legs and the hat on his head. He is usually depicted with a bag full of valuable objects. Daikokuten&#x27;s popular imagery originated as a syncretic conflation of the Buddhist death deity Mahākāla with the Shinto deity Ōkuninushi. The Japanese name &quot;Daikoku&quot; is a direct translation of the Sanskrit name &quot;Mahākāla&quot; which means &quot;Great Blackness&quot;. Per the Butsuzōzui compendium of 1690 (reprinted and expanded in 1796), Daikoku can also manifest as a female known as &quot;Daikokunyo&quot; (大黒女, lit. &quot;She of Great Blackness&quot;) or &quot;Daikokutennyo&quot; (大黒天女, lit. &quot;She of Great Blackness of the Heavens&quot;).

=== Bishamonten ===

Bishamonten&#x27;s (毘沙門天) origins can be traced back to Hinduism, but he has been adopted into Japanese culture. He comes from the Hindu god Kubera and is also known by the name &quot;Vaisravana&quot;.

He is the god of fortune in war and battles, also associated with authority and dignity. He is the protector of those who follow the rules and behave appropriately. As the patron of fighters, he is represented dressed in armour and a helmet, and is often seen carrying a pagoda. He also acts as the protector of holy sites and important places and wields a spear to fight against the evil spirits. He is usually depicted in illustrations with a hoop of fire.

=== Benzaiten ===

Benzaiten&#x27;s (弁才天 or 弁財天) origin is found in Hinduism, as she comes from the Hindu goddess Saraswati. She is the only female Fukujin in the modern grouping, and may be named in various ways: Benzaiten (弁才天), Benten (弁天), Bentensama (弁天様), or Benzaitennyo (弁才天女). When she was adapted from Buddhism, she was given the attributes of financial fortune, talent, beauty and music among others. Often, her figure appears with a &quot;Torii&quot;. She is represented as a smart, beautiful woman with all the aforementioned attributes. She carries a &quot;biwa&quot;, a Japanese traditional lute-like instrument, and is normally accompanied by a white snake. She is the patron of artists, writers, dancers, and geisha, among others.

=== Jurōjin ===

Considered the incarnation of the southern pole star (南極星 &quot;nankyokusei&quot;), Juroujin (寿老人) is the god of the elderly and of longevity in Japanese Buddhist mythology. It is said that the legendary Juroujin is based on a real person who lived in ancient times. He was approximately 1.82 meters tall with a very long head. Besides his distinctive skull, he is represented with a long white beard, riding a deer, and is often also accompanied by a 1500-year-old crane and a tortoise, as symbols of his affinity with long lives. In addition, he is usually represented under a peach tree, as the fruit of this tree is considered, by Chinese Taoism, as able to prolong life. In his hand he holds a cane and a book or a scroll. The wisdom of the world remains written in its pages. Jurojin enjoys rice and wine and is a very cheerful figure.

=== Hotei ===

Hotei (布袋) is the god of fortune, guardian of children, patron of diviners and barmen, and also the god of popularity. He is depicted as a fat, smiling, bald man with a curly moustache. He always appears half-naked, as his clothes are not wide enough to cover his enormous belly. He blessed the Chinese, and they nicknamed him &quot;Cho-Tei-Shi&quot; or &quot;Ho-Tei-Shi&quot;, which means ‘bag of old clothes’.

Hotei was a Zen priest, but his appearance and some of his actions were against their moral code: his appearance made him look like quite a mischievous person and he had no fixed place to sleep.

He carries a bag on his shoulders which is loaded with fortunes for those who believe in his virtues. Hotei&#x27;s traits and virtues are contentment, magnanimity, and happiness.

Hotei&#x27;s original Chinese name was Kaishi, and according to legend, he died in March 916.

The Japanese began to believe in Hotei during the Edo era. The reason why the Japanese have such great respect for this god comes from a legend that says that, before Zen Buddhism arrived in Japan, an alternative Buddhist thought was extended by a priest of dubious aesthetic, who actually was a manifestation of Miroku. Miroku was the patron of those who could not be saved by the beliefs of Buddha, and Hotei was later perceived and accepted by the Japanese as a second Miroku.

=== Fukurokuju (sometimes omitted) ===

The god Fukurokuju (福禄寿) also has his origins in China. It is believed that he used to be a hermit during the Chinese Song dynasty, distinguished for being a reincarnation of the Taoist god Hsuan-wu. He is the god of wisdom, luck, longevity, wealth and happiness. This god receives certain credits, such as being one of the Chinese philosophers who could live without eating (breatharian). Moreover, he is the only god who was said to have the ability to resurrect the dead. Fukurokuju is characterized by the size of his head, being almost as large as the size of his whole body, and is represented wearing traditional Chinese costumes. He normally carries a cane in one hand and in the other a scroll with writings about the world. He is usually accompanied by a turtle, a crow or a deer, animals that are frequently used in Japan to symbolize a long life. It is also said that he likes to play chess, and hence is the patron of chess players. The characteristics of Fukurokuju and Jurōjin overlap as they both trace back to the Chinese Taoist deity Nánjílǎorén (南极老人), which is why Fukurokuju&#x27;s position is sometimes granted instead to the goddess Kichijōten, as in the Butsuzōzui compendium of 1783.

=== Kichijōten (sometimes omitted)===
Kichijōten (吉祥天), a Fukujin goddess is also known as Kisshōten or Kisshoutennyo (吉祥天女), and is adapted via Buddhism from the Hindu goddess Lakshmi. Kisshōten has the traits of beauty, happiness, and fertility. In the 1783 edition of the Butsuzōzui compendium, Kichijōten replaces Fukurokuju as one of the Fukujin. Kichijōten&#x27;s iconography is distinguished from the other Fukujin goddesses by the Nyoihōju gem (如意宝珠) in her hand. When Kichijōten replaces Fukurokuju, and Daikoku is regarded in feminine form, all three of the Hindu Tridevi goddesses are then represented among the seven Fukujin.

== Takarabune ==

During the first three days of the New Year the Seven Lucky Gods are said to pilot through the heavens the &quot;Takarabune&quot; or Treasure Ship. A picture of the ship forms an essential part of traditional Japanese New Year celebrations.

<text>Tresco () is the second-biggest island of the Isles of Scilly. It is in area, measuring about by .

==History==
In early times one group of islands was in the possession of a confederacy of hermits. King Henry I gave it to Tavistock Abbey which established a priory on Tresco; it was abolished during the Dissolution of the Monasteries. The priory was given the care of souls in the secular islands by the lord of the fief. In 1233, a prior here, known as Alan of Cornwall, was made Abbot of Tavistock.

The original name for the island (including Bryher) was the , meaning &quot;promontory of sand-dunes&quot;. In 1193, when the island was granted to the Abbot of Tavistock by Pope Celestine III, the island was known as &quot;St. Nicholas&#x27;s island&quot;, and by 1305 it is called &quot;Trescau&quot; (farm of elder-trees). By 1540 this has changed to &quot;Iniscaw&quot; (island of elder-trees). The island was named as &quot;Trescaw&quot; in an 1814 publication.

The island is administered for the Crown by the Duchy of Cornwall and is leased to the Dorrien-Smith estate, which runs it as a timeshare business. The current leaseholder is Robert Dorrien-Smith. The Dorrien-Smith family (descended from Augustus Smith) held the position of Lord Proprietors of the Scilly Islands between 1834 and 1920.

From 2001 until 2009, the island hosted a marathon run organised to benefit the Cystic Fibrosis Trust, consisting of 7½ laps around the island. The event was held on the same day as the London Marathon. Past winners include Dara O&#x27;Kearney. It was replaced by a sprint triathlon.

In 2007 a rebuild of the Abbey Farm/Shed area was completed; this area was RNAS Tresco, a seaplane base during the First World War.

==Geography==

A variety of scenery is found on the island, including rugged granite outcrops, heathland of the exposed north coast and mainly shell beaches in the east and south. The variety of its scenery and geomorphology is partly a result of the last ice age, when the Devensian ice sheet clipped the north side of the island, leaving deformation till deposits.

The main settlements are New Grimsby and Old Grimsby in the central part of the island. Combined, their facilities include a convenience store (with a post office sub-branch), an art gallery, a pub, and two café/restaurants, all of which are owned and run by the Tresco Estate. At the south of the island are the sub-tropical Tresco Abbey Gardens, including the Valhalla Figurehead Collection, and Tresco Heliport. To the north of New Grimsby are King Charles&#x27;s Castle and Cromwell&#x27;s Castle.

==Civil parish and ward==

Tresco is one of the five civil parishes of the Isles of Scilly, which are also wards. The civil parish and ward covers much more than the island of Tresco: it includes uninhabited islands such as Samson (inhabited until 1855), Teän, St Helen&#x27;s, Northwethel and Round Island. Tresco elects one councillor to the Council of the Isles of Scilly, the same as the other &quot;off-island&quot; wards. The civil parish is not functional, however, and there is no council or meeting.

==Demography==
&quot;These figures include permanent residents only. A large number of seasonal staff also reside on the island during the summer.&quot;

==Economy==
Unlike the other Scilly islands, Tresco is primarily run as a holiday resort, and virtually all activity and employment is tourist-related. On the other islands tourism is important, but does not dominate to the same extent.

==Landmarks==


;English Civil War
*King Charles&#x27;s Castle dates from 1550–54, and was occupied by the Royalists during the English Civil War. It was later partially demolished to provide the building materials for Cromwell&#x27;s Castle.
*A coastal tower known as Cromwell&#x27;s Castle was built 1651–52 with a gun platform added around 1740 by Abraham Tovey, Master Gunner.
*The Old Blockhouse gun tower protecting Old Grimsby harbour, vigorously defended during the Civil War, was probably built between 1548 and 1552.
*Oliver&#x27;s Battery, in the south of the island, by the Carn Near quay, was erected shortly after the capture of Tresco by Parliamentary forces in the English Civil War. It was built by Admiral Robert Blake.

;Other landmarks
*Monument to Augustus Smith, above Appletree Bay on the south west of the island (Grade II listed building, List Entry Number 1141199).
*Remains of St Nicholas&#x27; Priory, Tresco, in Tresco Abbey Gardens (Grade II listed building, List Entry Number 1141172; and Scheduled Monument, List Entry Number 1016184).
*Anglican church: see St Nicholas&#x27;s Church, Tresco.

==Education==

Five Islands Academy (previously Five Islands School) has its Tresco and Bryher Base, a primary campus in Tresco. Secondary pupils board at the St Mary&#x27;s main campus, staying there on weekdays and coming back and forth to their home islands on weekends.

Students at the sixth-form college level reside and board elsewhere, in mainland Great Britain. Previously the Learning and Skills Council paid for costs of accommodation for sixth-formers.

==Transport==
Tresco is a car-free island. Electric vehicles are used to transport overnight visitors to and from Tresco Heliport and from the various quays, and a few golf carts are available for disabled visitors.

From Tresco Heliport, a year-round helicopter service connects Tresco to Penzance Heliport on the mainland. From 1983 to cessation in 2012, the service was operated by British International Helicopters. In 2020, helicopter service was resumed from a new Penzance Heliport to Tresco and St Mary&#x27;s, operated by Penzance Helicopters.

==Wildlife and ecology==
Tresco is unique amongst the off islands in that its habitat ranges from a windswept northern plateau with waved heath to sheltered bulb fields, wetland and lakes, to beautiful beaches backed by a sand dune system on the south coast. The forerunner of Natural England designated three Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) in 1971 and 1976. They are the Castle Down (Tresco) SSSI, Great Pool (Tresco) SSSI and Pentle Bay, Merrick and Round Islands SSSI. Castle Down is a SSSI for its waved maritime heath, its lichen flora, a breeding colony of Common Tern (&quot;Sterna hirundo&quot;) and for its geology. Great Pool is an SSSI because it is the largest area of fresh water in the islands and important for its breeding birds, and as a sheltering and feeding area for migrants. Pentle Bay is designated for the transition from a flora-rich sand dune system to lichen-rich heath.


In October 2012, four male and one female Red Squirrel (&quot;Sciurus vulgaris&quot;), on permanent loan from the British Wildlife Centre, were transported to Tresco by helicopter. Only two survived, but in September 2013 a further twenty were transported to Tresco and released in Abbey Woods, near the Abbey Gardens. Tresco is considered to be a ″safe haven″ for the endangered mammal as it is free from predators such as foxes, and from grey squirrels and the squirrel pox they carry. In June 2014, an unknown number of baby squirrels have been pictured in the Abbey Gardens, proving the squirrels are successfully breeding.

===Vagrant birds===
Among the many vagrant birds which have been found here, the following were firsts for Britain:
*Common Nighthawk (&quot;Chordeiles minor&quot;), collected on 17 September 1927.
*Black-billed Cuckoo (&quot;Coccyzus erythrophthalmus&quot;), collected on 27 October 1932.
*Northern Parula (&quot;Setophaga americana&quot;), seen 16–17 October 1966.
*Western Sandpiper (&quot;Calidris mauri&quot;), originally identified as a Semipalmated Sandpiper, 19 August 1969.
*Yellow-bellied Sapsucker (&quot;Sphyrapicus varius&quot;), seen 26 September – 6 October 1975. 
The island also briefly hosted the second British record of Great Blue Heron (&quot;Ardea herodias&quot;) in April and May 2015, which also visited both Bryher and St Mary&#x27;s during its 23-day stay.

==Cultural references==
Because of its geography and history, Tresco has often featured in fiction, most notably in the books of author Sam Llewellyn, a direct descendant of Augustus Smith who, after his appointment as Lord Proprietor of the Scillies in 1834 and living on the island, began to create the Abbey Gardens on land which surrounded the old Priory.

*&quot;Why the Whales Came&quot; by Michael Morpurgo is set in the Isles of Scilly and features Tresco several times.
*&quot;Hell Bay&quot; (1984), by Sam Llewellyn, is set on Tresco and fictionalises the events leading up to Augustus Smith taking ownership of the island.
*&quot;The Sea Garden&quot; (1999), also by Sam Llewellyn, is set on a fictional island based heavily on Tresco. It features a stunning Sea Garden much like the Tresco Abbey Gardens and the history of the fictional island draws heavily from the real history of the island.

==Filmography==
*In the 1989 BBC adaptation of &quot;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot;, the scenes on the fictional Lone Islands were filmed on Tresco, with the on-ship scenes being filmed on a ship on the surrounding sea.
*Tresco is the setting for the 2010 film &quot;Archipelago&quot;, directed by Joanna Hogg and starring Tom Hiddleston. It premiered at the 2010 London Film Festival, and was released on 4 March 2011 in the U.K. and Ireland.
*In the early 1980s Tresco was used by the group Blondie for the location of filming the video to the song &quot;Island of Lost Souls&quot;.

==Notable inhabitants==
*Sam Llewellyn (b. 1948), author.
*John Deason (1829–1915), gold miner, co-discoverer of the world&#x27;s largest gold nugget.

<text>Walton Harris Walker (3 December 1889 – 23 December 1950) was a United States Army four-star general who served with distinction in World War I, World War II, and the Korean War, where he commanded the Eighth United States Army before dying in a jeep accident. He received two Distinguished Service Crosses for extraordinary heroism in World War II and the Korean War.

==Early life==
Walker was born in Belton, Texas, on 3 December 1889. His parents, Sam and Lydia Walker were both college graduates whose fathers had been officers in the Confederate Army. His father, a merchant, taught him how to ride a horse and to hunt and shoot. He graduated from the Wedemeyer Academy, a school which operated in Belton from 1886 to 1911. From a young age, he desired to go to United States Military Academy (USMA) at West Point, New York, and he hoped to be a general one day.

==Early military career==
Walker attended the Virginia Military Institute in preparation for his education at the USMA. He entered the Academy on 15 June 1907, but resigned on 7 October 1907. He reentered the Academy on March 3, 1908, and was commissioned a second lieutenant of Infantry on 12 June 1912.

As a lieutenant, Walker served at Fort Sheridan, Illinois; Fort Crockett, Texas; Veracruz, Mexico; Galveston, Texas; and Fort Sam Houston, Texas, from June 1912 to May 1917. He was a member of the 1914 Veracruz expedition under Brigadier General Frederick Funston; patrolling on the U.S.-Mexican border in 1916, he developed a close friendship with Dwight D. Eisenhower. He was promoted to captain on 15 May 1917, a few weeks after the American entry into World War I. He served at Camp Funston, Texas, from May to December 1917, and Fort Sam Houston with the 13th Machine Gun Battalion from December 1917 to April 1918.

During World War I, Walker deployed to France with the 13th Machine Gun Company, 5th Machine Gun Battalion, 5th Division in April 1918, and, after being promoted to major on 17 June 1918, served as a company commander and then battalion commander to July 1919, by which time the war was over. He was awarded two Silver Stars for gallantry in action.

==Interwar period==
After the war, Walker rotated through a variety of assignments at Camp Benning, Georgia, and Fort Sill, Oklahoma, and served as a company commander and instructor at West Point from August 1923 to June 1925. He attended the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, from September 1925 to June 1926. He then served at Fort Monroe, Virginia, from June 1926 to July 1930. He next commanded the 2nd Battalion, 15th Infantry at Camp Burrowes, Qinhuangdao and American Barracks, Tianjin, China, from September 1930 to March 1933.

He was promoted to lieutenant colonel on 1 August 1935, and, after attending the United States Army War College from August 1935 until June 1936, he served as post executive officer and then brigade executive officer with the 5th Infantry Brigade, 3rd Division, from August 1936 to June 1937; the brigade was commanded by George C. Marshall, the future Army Chief of Staff.

==World War II==
Walker served as a staff officer in the War Plans Division with the General Staff Corps in Washington, D.C. from August 1937 to April 1941. He next served as commanding officer of the 36th Infantry Regiment, which was activated 15 April 1941, as the 36th Infantry (Armored) and assigned to the 3rd Armored Division, June 1941; on 1 January 1942, it was redesignated the 36th Armored Infantry.

When Marshall (now Chief of Staff) assigned George S. Patton to organize America&#x27;s armored forces, Walker successfully lobbied Marshall for a post as one of Patton&#x27;s subordinate commanders, gaining promotion to brigadier general in the process. Promoted to major general in 1942; he commanded the 3rd Armored Division from August 1941 to August 1942. After being succeeded by Leroy H. Watson, Walker became commanding general of IV Corps and then XX Corps (IV Armored Corps became XX Corps), taking the latter to England in February 1944 and leading it into combat in Normandy in July as part of Patton&#x27;s Third Army. He was awarded a Silver Star for gallantry in action on 7 July 1944. The citation for the medal read:

Walker&#x27;s XX Corps played a role in Patton&#x27;s dash across France in August and early September 1944, earning the sobriquet &quot;Ghost Corps&quot; for the speed of its advance. He received the Distinguished Service Cross (DSC) or extraordinary heroism on 23 August 1944, the citation for which read:

Walker&#x27;s troops saw heavy fighting in France and Germany during the remainder of the war, especially at Metz, the Battle of the Bulge, and in the invasion of Germany. In the spring of 1945, XX Corps liberated Buchenwald concentration camp, then pushed south and east, eventually reaching Linz, Austria by May. Walker received his third star at this time, making him a lieutenant general.

Walker received the unconditional surrender of &quot;Generaloberst&quot; Lothar Rendulic, commander of German Army Group South, on 7 May 1945. For his service as commander of XX Corps from 1944 to 1945 He was awarded the Legion of Merit.

==Post-World War II==
In May 1945, Walker returned to the United States. He was given command of the Eighth Service Command, headquartered in Dallas, from May 1945 to May 1946. He was assigned as the commander of the Sixth Service Command and the Fifth Army, headquartered in Chicago, from May 1946 to September 1948, and then became commanding general of the U.S. Eighth Army, the American occupation force in Japan. Walker was ordered by General Douglas MacArthur, the Supreme Allied Commander in Japan, to restore the peacetime Eighth Army to combat-ready condition.

==Korean War==

At the end of World War II in 1945, Korea was divided into North Korea and South Korea, with North Korea (assisted by the Soviet Union) becoming a communist state after 1946, known as the Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea, followed by South Korea becoming the Republic of Korea (ROK). China became the communist People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949. In 1950, the Soviet Union backed North Korea while the United States backed South Korea, and China allied with the Soviet Union in what was to become the first military action of the Cold War.

Shortly after 75,000 North Korean troops with tanks invaded South Korea on 25 June 1950, American air and sea forces were ordered by President Harry S. Truman to give South Korean troops support. The U.S. Eighth Army was ordered to intervene and drive the invaders back across the 38th parallel, the border between the two countries. With only four lightly equipped and poorly trained divisions, Walker began landing troops on the southeast side of the Korean peninsula in July. After his lead units, elements of the 24th Infantry Division (including the ill-fated Task Force Smith), were virtually destroyed in a few days of furious fighting between Osan and Taejon, Walker realized his assigned mission was impossible and went on the defensive. Pushed steadily back towards the southeast by the North Korean advance, Walker&#x27;s forces suffered heavy losses and for a time were unable to form a defensible front, even after bringing the 1st Cavalry Division and 25th Infantry Division into the fight. 

Walker&#x27;s situation was not helped by MacArthur&#x27;s unrealistic demands from Tokyo for him not to retreat an inch. Attempting to obey, Walker gave a bombastic &quot;not a step back&quot; speech to his staff and subordinate commanders which did not go over well. Nor did it stop the North Korean troops from pushing back American and South Korea troops, which had been badly mauled in the opening days of the invasion, even further. As American and South Korean forces retreated further east and south, they finally arrived at a defensible line on the Nakdong River. They took advantage of shortened supply routes and a relatively good road network to exploit the advantages of interior lines. Walker was able to quickly shift his units from point to point, stopping North Korean attacks before they could be reinforced.

A critical advantage Walker had was signals intelligence produced by the U.S. Armed Forces Security Agency (now the National Security Agency). This data enabled Walker to gain an indication of North Korean Army movements prior to attacks. Walker kept his main units deployed on the front lines, while retaining other U.S. Army and Marine Corps forces as a mobile reserve. His ability to better interpret North Korean intentions allowed him and his staff to better position his forces along the perimeter. It also allowed him to employ artillery and airpower more effectively.

American military forces gradually solidified this defensive position on the southeast side of the Korean peninsula, dubbed the &quot;Pusan Perimeter&quot;. Walker received reinforcements, including the Provisional Marine Brigade, which he used along with the Army&#x27;s 27th Infantry Regiment as &quot;fire brigades,&quot; reliable troops who specialized in counterattacking and wiping out enemy penetrations. As more reinforcements arrived, the combat advantage shifted toward the United Nations forces. North Korean forces had suffered terribly and their supply lines were under constant aerial bombardment. Almost all of their Russian-made T-34 tanks, which had spearheaded the invasion, had been destroyed. Walker ordered local counterattacks, while planning for a large-scale breakout in conjunction with MacArthur&#x27;s Inchon landing in September.

With MacArthur&#x27;s amphibious flanking move, the North Koreans seemed trapped, but Walker&#x27;s rapid advance northwest towards Inchon and Seoul emphasized speed over maneuver and made no attempt to encircle and destroy the North Koreans after punching through their lines. Although thousands of prisoners were taken, many North Korean units successfully disengaged from the fighting, melting away into the interior of South Korea, where they would conduct a guerrilla war for two years. Others escaped all the way back to North Korea. Walker was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for extraordinary heroism from 14 July to 28 September 1950. The medal&#x27;s citation read:

With the war apparently won, Walker&#x27;s Eighth Army quickly moved north and, with the independent X Corps on its right, crossed the 38th parallel to occupy North Korea. Fighting tapered off to sporadic, sharp clashes with remnants of North Korean forces. By late October 1950, the Eighth Army was nearing the Yalu River, on the border between North Korea and China. MacArthur&#x27;s headquarters had assured Walker that the Chinese would not intervene, so Walker&#x27;s troops did not maintain watchful security. A gap opened between Eighth Army and X Corps as they advanced close to the Chinese border due to a lack of coordination between Walker, General Edward Almond, Commander of the X Corps, and MacArthur&#x27;s headquarters in Tokyo. Eventually, the weather turned extremely cold, and most American units had no training and inadequate equipment for these bitter temperatures.

Contrary to MacArthur&#x27;s expectations, the Chinese intervened in force on November 25, first in a series of ambushes, then in sporadic night attacks, and finally in an all-out offensive in which three Chinese armies infiltrated the lines, taking advantage of the American failure to take basic security measures, and the large gaps between American and South Korean units and between the Eighth Army and the X Corps. From late October until the beginning of December in 1950, the Chinese killed or captured thousands of American and ROK soldiers, decimating the 2nd Infantry Division and forcing Walker into a desperate retreat.

By early December, using his superior mobility, Walker successfully broke contact with the Chinese, withdrawing south to a position around Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea. Without instructions from MacArthur&#x27;s headquarters, Walker decided that the Eighth Army was too battered to defend Pyongyang and ordered the retreat to resume to below the 38th parallel, saving most of the Eighth Army.

==Death and burial==
Walker was killed in a traffic accident on 23 December 1950, in Dobong District, Seoul (near Uijeongbu), South Korea, when his north-bound command jeep collided with a south-bound weapons carrier from a South Korean army division that had swung out of its lane. His body was escorted back to the United States by his son Sam Sims Walker, then a Company commander with the 19th Infantry Regiment, who was also serving in Korea. On 2 January 1951, he was posthumously promoted to full general and his body was interred in Section 34 of Arlington National Cemetery.

==Legacy and honors==

Promoted posthumously to 4-star General, Walker&#x27;s memory was much honored in the years immediately following the Korean War. The Army chose his name (and his other nickname), for its next light tank, the M41 Walker Bulldog. The M41 Tank was already nicknamed the Little Bulldog before Gen. Walker&#x27;s death. The Army dropped the word Little and retained the name Bulldog as part of the new nickname for the M41 Tank.

In Dallas, Texas, the western segment of Texas State Highway Loop 12 was named after him (the portion going through neighboring Irving, Texas continues the naming convention). In Belton, Texas, American Legion Post 55 is named after him. One of the largest Armed Forces Recreation Center&#x27;s hotels, the General Walker Hotel in Berchtesgaden (now demolished), was also named in his honor. Camp Walker in Daegu, South Korea, is named in his honor.

In 1963, South Korea President Park Chung Hee honored Walker by naming a hill in the southern part of Seoul after him. Today, Walker Hill is the site of the Grand Walker Hill, a five-star international resort and hotel with its own full service casino. Also, Walker Hill Apartment is located in Gwangjin-gu. In December 2009, the mayor of Dobong-gu district, Choi Sun-Kil, unveiled the Walton Harris Walker monument to mark the site of his death. The memorial, which is near Dobong subway Station, pays tribute to Walker and to all those who defended South Korea in the Korean War.

Walker Intermediate School which is located on the Fort Knox Army Garrison, was named after Walker and opened in 1962. His picture hangs in the school lobby. A biography of Walker was published in 2008 titled &quot;General Walton H. Walker: Forgotten Hero-The Man Who Saved Korea&quot;, by Charles M. Province.

==In popular culture==
Walker was portrayed by Douglas Fowley in the 1963 film &quot;Miracle of the White Stallions&quot;, and by Garry Walberg in the 1977 film &quot;MacArthur&quot;.

<text>A guardian angel is a type of angel that is assigned to protect and guide a particular person, group or nation. Belief in tutelary beings can be traced throughout all antiquity. The idea of angels that guard over people played a major role in Ancient Judaism. In Christianity, the hierarchy of angels was extensively developed in the 5th century by Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite. The theology of angels and tutelary spirits has undergone many changes since the 5th century. The belief is that guardian angels serve to protect whichever person God assigns them to. The Memorial of the Holy Guardian Angels is celebrated on 2 October.

The idea of a guardian angel is central to the 15th-century book &quot;The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage&quot; by Abraham of Worms, a German Cabalist. In 1897, this book was translated into English by Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers (1854–1918), a co-founder of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, who styled the guardian angel as the Holy Guardian Angel.

Aleister Crowley (1875–1947), the founder of the esoteric religion Thelema, considered the &quot;Holy Guardian Angel&quot; to be representative of one&#x27;s truest divine nature and the equivalent of the &quot;Genius&quot; of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, the Augoeides of Iamblichus, the Atman of Hinduism, and the Daimon of the ancient Greeks. Following the teachings of the Golden Dawn, Crowley refined their rituals which were intended to facilitate the ability to establish contact with one&#x27;s guardian angel.

== Zoroastrianism ==

Also known as &quot;Arda Fravaš&quot; (&#x27;Holy Guardian Angels&#x27;). Each person is accompanied by a guardian angel, which acts as a guide throughout life. They originally patrolled the boundaries of the ramparts of heaven, but volunteer to descend to earth to stand by individuals to the end of their days.

== Judaism ==
=== In the Hebrew Bible ===
The guardian angel concept is present in the books of the Hebrew Bible, and its development is well marked. These books described God&#x27;s angels as his ministers who carried out his behests, and who were at times given special commissions, regarding men and mundane affairs.

In Genesis 18–19, angels not only acted as the executors of God&#x27;s wrath against the cities of the plain, but they delivered Lot from danger; in Exodus 32:34, God said to Moses: The story of Tobias concerns the angel Archangel Raphael guiding and aiding its primary character. Psalm 91:11 reads: (Cf. Psalm 33:8 and 34:5 — 34:7 and 35:6 in Protestant Bibles).

The belief that angels can be guides and intercessors for men can be found in Job 33:23–26, and in Daniel 10:13 angels seem to be assigned to certain countries. In this latter case, the &quot;prince of the kingdom of Persia&quot; contends with Gabriel. The same verse mentions &quot;Michael, one of the chief princes&quot;.

=== Rabbinic literature ===
In rabbinic literature, the rabbis expressed the notion that there are indeed guardian angels appointed by God to watch over people.
Lailah is an angel of the night in charge of conception and pregnancy. Lailah serves as a guardian angel throughout a person&#x27;s life and at death, leads the soul into the afterlife.

=== Late and modern Judaism ===
According to Rabbi Leo Trepp, in late Judaism, the belief developed that, &quot;the people have a heavenly representative, a guardian angel. Every human being has a guardian angel. Previously the term &quot;Malakh&quot; (angel) simply meant messenger of God.&quot;

Chabad believes that people might indeed have guardian angels. For Chabad, God watches over people and makes decisions directly with their prayers and it is in this context that the guardian angels are sent back and forth as emissaries to aid in this task. Thus, they are not prayed to directly, but the angels are part of the workings of how the prayer and response comes about.

In the view of Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz:
In Judaism, there are references to angels with specific protective functions. An example of this can be seen in the birth protection rituals practiced among others by Ashkenazi Jews in parts of Alsace, Switzerland and Southern Germany. Pregnant women and newborn children would be given text amulets bearing the names of the angels Senoi, Sansenoi and Semangelo. These angels were supposed to protect pregnant women and newborn children from Lilith. This can be traced back to the story of Lilith, in which God sends three angels to bring Lilith back to Adam. They are unsuccessful in this task, but Lilith admits to having been created to harm children. She promises to spare children who carry the name or likeness of the three angels with them.

Samael was identified as the guardian angel and prince of Rome and the archenemy of Israel. By the beginning of Jewish culture in Europe, Samael had been established as a representative of Christianity, due to his identification with Rome.

== Christianity ==
=== New Testament ===
In the New Testament the concept of guardian angel may be noted. Angels are everywhere the intermediaries between God and man; and Christ set a seal upon the Old Testament teaching: &quot;See that you despise not one of these little ones: for I say to you, that their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father who is in heaven.&quot; (Matthew 18:10). Guardian angels work both for single persons and for communities of people. and refers of the angels of the seven churches of Asia who work in the role of their guardians.

=== Roman Catholic Church ===

According to Saint Jerome, the concept of guardian angels is in the &quot;mind of the Church&quot;. He stated: .

The first Christian theologian to outline a specific scheme for guardian angels was Honorius of Autun in the 12th century. He said that every soul was assigned a guardian angel the moment it was put into a body. Scholastic theologians augmented and ordered the taxonomy of angelic guardians. Thomas Aquinas agreed with Honorius and believed that it was the lowest order of angels who served as guardians, and his view was most successful in popular thought, but Duns Scotus said that any angel is bound by duty and obedience to the Divine Authority to accept the mission to which that angel is assigned. In the 15th century, the Feast of the Guardian Angels was added to the official calendar of Catholic holidays.

In his 31 March 1997 Regina Caeli address, Pope John Paul II referred to the concept of guardian angels and concluded the address with the statement: .

In his 2014 homily for the Feast of Holy Guardian Angels, 2 October, Pope Francis told those gathered for daily Mass to be like children who pay attention to their &quot;traveling companion&quot;. , the Pope said. During the Morning Meditation in the chapel of Santa Marta, the Pope noted that oftentimes, we have the feeling that This, he said, &quot;is the voice of&quot; our guardian angel. The Pope instructed each, The Pope urged that this &quot;doctrine on the angels&quot; not be considered &quot;a little imaginative&quot;, as it is rather one of &quot;truth&quot;: it is .

Pope Francis concluded with a series of questions so that each one can examine their own conscience: Each one of us can do so in order to evaluate He reiterated this in a homily on 2 October 2018: The Congregation for Divine Worship and Discipline of the Sacraments discourages assigning names to angels beyond those revealed in scripture: Michael, Gabriel, and Raphael.

The Opus Sanctorum Angelorum is a public association of the Catholic Church that Christians can join as members in order to promote Within the Opus Sanctorum Angelorum is the Confraternity of the Holy Guardian Angels that one becomes eligible for after entering a two year formation period.

==== Angels as guardians ====

According to Aquinas, By means of an angel, God is said to introduce images and suggestions leading a person to do what is right.

==== Saints and their angels ====
Father Giovangiuseppe Califano recounted how, one day, a newly appointed bishop confessed to Pope John XXIII . Pope John attributed the idea of calling Second Vatican Council to an inspiration from his guardian angel.

Saint Gemma Galgani, a Roman Catholic mystic, stated that she had interacted with and spoken with her guardian angel. Saint Pio of Pietrelcina was known to instruct his parishioners to send him their guardian angel to communicate a trouble or issue to him when they could not travel to get to him or another urgency existed.

=== Anglican Communion ===
&quot;Of the Intercession and Invocation of Angels and Saints&quot;, printed in the Library of Anglo-Catholic Theology, held that &quot;many learned Protestants think it probable that each of the faithful, at least, has a guardian angel. It seems certainly proved by Scripture. Zanchius says that all the Fathers held this opinion&quot;. Building upon sacred scripture and the teachings of the Church Fathers, Richard Montagu, the Anglican Bishop of Norwich in the 17th century, stated that .

=== Eastern Orthodox Church ===
Sergei Bulgakov writes that the Eastern Orthodox Church teaches that:

As such, before the Eastern Orthodox liturgy of the Communion of the Faithful, a prayer asks 

=== Lutheran Church ===
The Morning Prayer and Evening Prayer found in Martin Luther&#x27;s Small Catechism include the supplication . Donald Schneider, a Lutheran priest, states that Martin Luther may have based these prayers on , which includes a verse stating .

=== Methodist Church ===
John W. Hanner, a Methodist minister and theologian, wrote on the topic of guardian angels in his &quot;Angelic Study&quot;, stating that:
In May and June 1743, Methodists experienced persecution in Wednesbury and Walsall and the founder of the Methodist Church, John Wesley, was threatened with death by a mob who dragged him in the rain; however, and he .

=== Reformed and Presbyterian Churches ===

In &quot;Reformed Dogmatics&quot;, Heinrich Heppe states that some Reformed theologians espoused the view of guardian angels, including Bucan, who taught:

== Islam ==
There is a similar Islamic belief in the Mu&#x27;aqqibat. According to many Muslims, each person has two guardian angels, in front of and behind him, while the two recorders are located to the right and left.

== Renaissance magic ==
=== Christian Kabbalah ===
The idea of a Holy Guardian Angel is central to the book &quot;The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage&quot; by Abraham of Worms, a German Christian Cabalist who wrote the book on ceremonial magic during the 15th century and which was later translated by Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers, a co-founder of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. He elaborated on this earlier work, giving it extensive magical notes. In Mathers&#x27; publication of &quot;The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage&quot;, he writes:
=== Enochian magic ===
The Enochian system of 16th-century occultist John Dee discusses the guardian angel. In this dialog between Dee and the angel Jubanladace on p.18, Cotton Appendix XLVI 1, the angel says the following:

== Thelema ==

Having studied &quot;The Book of Abramelin&quot; during his time with the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, occult writer Aleister Crowley adapted the concept of the Holy Guardian Angel from Renaissance magic (see above) and made it central to the philosophy and practices of Thelema, popularizing it in the process.

In his earlier writings, Crowley states that the Holy Guardian Angel is the &quot;silent self&quot;, the equivalent of the Genius of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, the &quot;Augoeides&quot; of Iamblichus, the &quot;Ātman&quot; of Hinduism, and the Daimon of the ancient Greeks. In his late sixties, when composing &quot;Magick Without Tears&quot;, he states that the Holy Guardian Angel is not one&#x27;s self, but rather a discrete and independent being, who may have been previously human.

=== Methods of contact ===
Within the system of Aleister Crowley&#x27;s magical Order A∴A∴, one of the two most important goals is to consciously connect with one&#x27;s Holy Guardian Angel, representative of one&#x27;s truest divine nature: a process termed &quot;Knowledge and Conversation&quot;.

Crowley suggested that the Abramelin procedure was not the only way to achieve success in this endeavour:
Since the operation described in &quot;Abramelin&quot; is complex and requires time and resources not available to many people, Crowley wanted to provide a more accessible method. While at the Abbey of Thelema in Italy, he wrote &quot;Liber Samekh&quot; based on the Bornless Ritual, a ritual designed as an example of how one may attain the knowledge and conversation with one&#x27;s Holy Guardian Angel. In his notes to this ritual, Crowley sums up the key to success: &quot;INVOKE OFTEN.&quot;

Crowley also explains, in more detail, the general mystical process of the ritual:
Another detailed description of the general operation is given in &quot;The Vision and the Voice&quot; in the eighth Aethyr and is also described in &quot;Liber 8&quot;.

== Literary usage ==

Guardian angels were often considered to be matched by a personal demon who countered the angel&#x27;s efforts, especially in popular medieval drama such as morality plays like the 15th-century &quot;The Castle of Perseverance&quot;. In Christopher Marlowe&#x27;s play &quot;The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus&quot;, , Faustus has a &quot;Good Angel&quot; and &quot;Bad Angel&quot; who offer competing advice (Act 2, scene 1, etc.).

Guardian angels appear in literary works of the medieval and Renaissance periods. Later the Anglican English physician and philosopher Sir Thomas Browne (1605–1682), stated his belief in &quot;Religio Medici&quot; (part 1, paragraph 33):
By the 19th century, the guardian angel was no longer viewed in Anglophone lands as an intercessory figure, but rather as a force protecting the believer from performing sin. A parody appears in Lord Byron&#x27;s 1819 poem &quot;Don Juan&quot;: (Canto I, xvii).

In Cardinal Newman&#x27;s 1865 poem &quot;The Dream of Gerontius&quot;, the departed soul is met by his guardian angel. J. R. R. Tolkien talks of a Guardian Angel in several letters to his children. He described the Guardian Angel as &quot;God&#x27;s very attention itself, personalised&quot;.

== In popular culture ==
* Clarence Odbody, the guardian angel in the 1946 film &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; and the 1990 film &quot;Clarence&quot;, &quot;earned his wings&quot; through bringing awareness that life was worth living to the 1946 film&#x27;s protagonist, George Bailey.
* Teen Angel, Frenchy&#x27;s guardian angel in the 1978 film &quot;Grease&quot;, who advises her to return to high school in the song &quot;Beauty School Dropout&quot;.

<doc id="313664" wikidata="Q1150151" url="?curid=313664" title="Abe no Seimei">
<text>was a Japanese &quot;onmyōji&quot;, a court official and specialist of &quot;Onmyōdō&quot;, during the middle of the Heian period. In addition to his prominence in history, he is a legendary figure in Japanese folklore. He has been portrayed in several stories and films.

Seimei worked as an &quot;onmyōji&quot; for emperors and the Heian government, advising on the spiritually correct way to deal with issues. He prayed for the well-being of emperors and the government and advised on various issues. He was also an astrologer and predicted astrological events. He lived a long life of 84 years, free from any major illness, contributing to the popular belief that he had mystical powers.

The Seimei Shrine, located in Kyoto, is dedicated to him. The Abeno train station and district in Osaka are named after him, as it is one of the locations where legends place his birth.

==Life and legends==

Seimei&#x27;s life is well recorded, and there is little to question about his existence. Immediately after his death, however, legends arose much like those surrounding Merlin. Many legends of Seimei were originally written in the &quot;Konjaku Monogatarishū&quot;, and by the Edo period, many stories in circulation focused on his heroic acts.

His ancestry was not very clear. His ancestor might have been Abe no Masuki (安倍 益材), a &quot;Daizen-no-daibu&quot; (大膳大夫 &quot;Master of the Palace Table&quot;), or Abe no Shunzai (安倍 春材), a &quot;Kokushi&quot; of Awaji. Another candidate is Abe no Miushi (阿倍 御主人), who appeared as an &quot;Udaijin&quot; (右大臣 &quot;Minister of the Right&quot;) in &quot;The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter&quot;. Seimei might also have been a descendant of Abe no Nakamaro as Abe-no-Sukune-no-Seimei (安倍宿禰晴明). However, some other sources recorded his name as Abe-no-Asomi-no-Seimei (安倍朝臣晴明), which refers to the Abe-no-Asomi descending from Abe no Miushi. The name Sukune (宿禰), through the Abe clan, was taken from Naniwa no Imiki (難波忌寸, later Naniwa no Sukune) of the Naniwa clan (難波氏), also known as the Naniwa no Kishi (難波吉士), which Naniwa no Mitsuna (難波 三綱, ) established.

According to Anderson, Abe no Seimei was a descendant of the poet Abe no Nakamaro and a disciple of Kamo no Tadayuki (賀茂忠行) and Kamo no Yasunori, 10th-century diviners of the Heian court. He became Kamo no Yasunori&#x27;s successor in astrology and divination, while Yasunori&#x27;s son took on the lesser responsibility of devising the calendar. Seimei&#x27;s duties included analyzing strange events, conducting exorcisms, warding against evil spirits, and performing various rites of geomancy. He was said to be incredibly skilled in divining the sex of fetuses and finding lost objects. According to the &quot;Konjaku Monogatarishu&quot;, he correctly predicted the abdication of Emperor Kazan based on his observation of celestial phenomena.

Seimei&#x27;s reputation grew sufficiently that, from the late 10th century, the &quot;Onmyōryō&quot;, the government ministry of &quot;Onmyōdō&quot;, was controlled by the Abe clan. The Kamo clan likewise became the hereditary keepers of the calendar.

The mystical symbol of the central five-pointed star referred to in the West as a pentagram, is known in Japan as the &quot;Seiman&quot;, the &quot;Seal of Abe no Seimei&quot;, or the &quot;Seimei Kikyō&quot; (晴明紋 / 晴明桔梗); this pentacle was originally the personal seal of Abe-no-Seimei, later becoming the symbol for the &quot;Onmyōryō&quot; (the government ministry department for the practice of Onmyōdō, or the Bureau of Taoist Geomancy) and for Onmyōdō itself, given its association with the Chinese Five Elements.

According to legend, Abe no Seimei was not entirely human. His father, Abe no Yasuna (安倍 保名), was human. Still, his mother, Kuzunoha, was a &quot;kitsune&quot; (a &quot;fox spirit&quot;). At a very early age, no later than five, he was allegedly able to command weak &quot;oni&quot; to do his bidding. His mother entrusted Seimei to Kamo no Tadayuki to live a good human life and not become evil himself.

The Heian period, mainly when Seimei lived, was a time of peace. Many of his legends revolve around a series of magical battles with a rival, Ashiya Dōman (蘆屋道満), who often tried to embarrass Seimei so that he could usurp his position. One noted story involved Dōman and the young Seimei in a divination duel to reveal the contents of a particular box. Dōman had another person put fifteen mandarin oranges into the box and &quot;divined&quot; that there were fifteen oranges in it. Seimei saw through the ruse, metamorphosed the oranges into rats, and stated that fifteen rats were in the box. When the rats were revealed, Dōman was shocked and defeated. It’s described that Hakudō Sennin (伯道上人) was Seimei’s teacher.

Seimei is involved in numerous other tales as well. He appears as a minor character in the &quot;Heike Monogatari&quot; and is said to be responsible for divining the location of the Shuten-dōji, a powerful oni purportedly slain by Minamoto no Yorimitsu. He is sometimes said to be the onmyōji who discovered Tamamo-no-Mae&#x27;s true nature, although the time of the Tamamo-no-Mae story does not coincide with Seimei&#x27;s lifetime; other sources credit the act to a descendant, Abe no Yasuchika.

==Legacy==

After Seimei&#x27;s death, Emperor Ichijo made a shrine in his honor, the Seimei Jinja was erected at the location of his home in 1007 AD. The original shrine was destroyed in war during the fifteenth century, but it was rebuilt in the same location and still stands today. The Seimei Jinja located in Kyoto attracts fans of Seimei&#x27;s interpretations in popular culture. In 2005, the shrine was renovated and decorated with pentagrams. The shrine sells amulets with pentagrams and the Chinese bellflower adorning them, associated with Seimei. The shrine is now popular with fans of Seimei-inspired media, such as Okano Reiko&#x27;s manga.

The asteroid 5541 Seimei, discovered in 1976, is named for him.

Japanese figure skater and two-time Olympic champion Yuzuru Hanyu portrayed Abe no Seimei in his Olympic free skate program &quot;Seimei&quot;, using the soundtrack of the movies &quot;Onmyōji&quot; and &quot;Onmyōji II&quot;. With the program, Hanyu became the first skater across all disciplines to score above 200 points in the free skate and set back-to-back world records in the 2015–16 season. This program also contributed to the win of his second Olympic title in 2018 and the completion of the first career Super Slam in the men&#x27;s singles discipline in 2020.

Abe no Seimei&#x27;s origin story would be retold on the Japanese Animation television show &quot;Folktales from Japan&quot; in episode 83. His story would appear in the third segment of the episode, telling the tale of the meeting of parents and early life known as Doujimaru. It would show how his mother commanded him to become a fortune teller at the capital to help others.

Abe no seimei was termed the &quot;Merlin the Magician of Japan&quot; by some scholars due to his legends and portrayals in several stories, folklore, and films – also due to the legends of Merlin being a cambion of a demon and a human much like the Kuzunoha legend.

===&quot;Senji Ryakketsu&quot;===
Abe no Seimei is credited with the &quot;Senji Ryakketsu&quot;, an &quot;Onmyōdō&quot; primer.

==In fiction==

His name appears in many works of fiction, often as a helpful, wise man and rarely as an enemy, such as &quot;Twin Star Exorcists&quot;. There are exceptions, such as &quot;&quot;, where Seimei was also a great ayakashi and the Lord of Darkness.

Since 1989, Abe no Seimei has been depicted as a bishōnen.

=== Novels ===
The first modern fictional work credited with bringing back widespread interest to &quot;Onmyōdō&quot; mysticism in Japan is the 1985 historical fantasy novel &quot;Teito Monogatari&quot; by Hiroshi Aramata. In the novel&#x27;s story, two of the primary characters, Yasumasa Hirai and Yasunori Katō, are descendants of Seimei and have inherited all his knowledge. Yasumasa Hirai is a notable example because his appearance is modeled off classic depictions of Seimei, and many of his actions are based on those of Seimei&#x27;s from stories in the &quot;Uji Shūi Monogatari&quot;. Yasunori Katō&#x27;s first name &quot;Yasunori&quot; is derived from the name of Seimei&#x27;s legendary teacher and he proudly wears Seimei&#x27;s symbol, the Seiman (five-pointed star), on his gloves and handkerchief. Unlike Hirai, though, Katō&#x27;s burning hatred for the Japanese Empire has metamorphosed him into an oni. With one in defense of the Empire and one against it, the two men naturally become enemies. The rest of the novel chronicles the battle between their two factions.

In 1988, Baku Yumemakura started a novel series named &quot;Onmyōji&quot; with Seimei portrayed as a handsome young man who lived in a Heian-period world populated by mysterious beings. Reiko Okano turned this into a manga and became popular with teenage girls. In 2002, an NHK television series was made based on the novels. A version of Abe has also been rendered by acclaimed Taiwanese manga artist Ethan, who has stated that he is a massive fan of the novel. The novels were adapted into an anime by the studio Marvy Jack for Netflix in November 2023.

=== Films ===
The film &quot;Onmyōji&quot;, starring Mansai Nomura as Seimei, was released in 2001 (2004 in the U.S.) by Pioneer (now Geneon). As with any other work featuring both Seimei and Minamoto no Hiromasa, the film was based on Yumemakura&#x27;s novels. Despite Yumemakura being involved, the manga adaptation and the movie adaptation are quite different in style and plot.

A sequel, &quot;Onmyoji II&quot;, was made in 2003.

In 2020, a Chinese film, &quot;The Yin-Yang Master: Dream of Eternity&quot;, was produced based on an adaption from &quot;Onmyōji&quot; written by Baku Yumemakura. Seimei was portrayed by Mark Chao. In the following year, another Chinese film, &quot;The Yinyang Master&quot; was released. The film is an adaption of a NetEase game &quot;Onmyōji&quot; (which in turn is based on the novel series &quot;Onmyōji&quot; by author Baku Yumemakura). Seimei was portrayed by Chen Kun.

A prequel film, titled , starring Kento Yamazaki as Seimei, premiered on April 19, 2024; it was later released worldwide on Amazon Prime Video on October 18 of the same year. The film served as a prequel of Seimei solving a murder mystery at the before becoming an &quot;onmyōji&quot;.

=== Television ===
To capitalize on the success of the &quot;Onmyōji&quot; films, Fuji Television produced a miniseries in 2004, called &quot;Onmyoji: Abe no Seimei&quot;. This series has no ties to cinematic releases.

=== Manga ===
Hao Asakura&#x27;s character from Hiroyuki Takei&#x27;s &quot;Shaman King&quot; is directly based on Seimei. Hao is the author of a magical book called Chō-Senjiryakketsu, clearly inspired by Seimei&#x27;s &quot;Senji Ryakketsu&quot;. They also share facts about their lives, such as their mother being called a demon fox and their ability to create &quot;oni&quot; since they were young.

Seimei had been shown in a manga called &quot;Nurarihyon no Mago&quot; by Hiroshi Shiibashi, as a Nue, dark lord of the Ayakashi, born from an evil fox. &quot;Nurarihyon no Mago&quot; was adapted into an anime series starting in July 2010.

Abe no Seimei also appears in the manga Igyoujin Oniwakamaru as an evil spirit who plans to revive himself to begin his second life and rule over humans and yokai.

He also appeared in Kouta Hirano&#x27;s &quot;Drifters&quot; manga series leading a group of magicians called the Octobrist Organization. Appearing as a young man, he has been pulled into an alternate world where various historical figures are summoned, and magicians need their skills and techniques to save their world from destruction. It is mentioned in English dubbed anime of &quot;Drifters&quot; that Abe no Haruakira was another way to read the kanji of his name.

The main character of the manga series A Terrified Teacher at Ghoul School!, Seimei was the main character&#x27;s ancestor.

In the manga series &quot;Twin Star Exorcists&quot;, Seimei was, in fact, a female exorcist no older than thirteen. She was the founder of yang-style exorcism who did away with the King of Kegare (Impurities), creating Magano as a powerful barrier and forcefield. Before shutting herself and her retainers inside, she turned to her disciple Doujimaru and granted him a some of her powers. This Doujimaru that modern times know as &#x27;Abe no Seimei&#x27;. (The truth about Seimei being female is known only to a few characters in-universe). In contrast to the source material, however, the second half of its anime adaptation with its completely original story in comparison to the source has Seimei still be male. He serves as the final antagonist of the anime-only storyline, with his plans to use the Cataclysm King that is Rokuro to cleanse humanity by erasing humanity&#x27;s free will.

In the manga series &quot;Gintama&quot;, Ketsuno Seimei is directly based on Seimei. Ketsuno Seimei is the current leader of the Ketsuno Clan, responsible for protecting the Bakufu and Edo by foretelling disasters and ill omens. For this, he has 1000 of his shikigami all around Edo as his &quot;eyes&quot; and he can also summon a fox-like shikigami called Kuzunoha based on the Abe No Seimei’s mother. He is as a major character in Diviner Arc (Gintama Vol. 32 - 33, ch. 282 - 289).

=== Anime ===
Seimei can be seen in the anime &quot;Magical Shopping Arcade Abenobashi&quot;, released in 2004 in the U.S. by ADV Films. The show&#x27;s focus was on the Onmyoji practice of changing events to avoid an ill occurrence and the misadventures of two youths. Seimei also appears in the anime &quot;Gintama&quot; as an onmyoji, and in the anime &quot;Shonen Onmyouji&quot; which is about his grandson. Seimei is a central character in the anime called &quot;Otogi Zoshi&quot;.

Seimei appears in the anime &quot;New Getter Robo&quot; as the leader of the villainous oni.

The second season of the anime &quot;&quot; features a female Abe no Seimei as its protagonist.

He also appears in the anime &quot;Fukigen no Mononokean&quot; with Ashiya as his companion rather than his rival.

Seimei plays a role in the &quot;Midnight Occult Civil Servants&quot; anime, about mild-mannered civil servants in Tokyo&#x27;s Shinjuku ward who secretly manage a huge population of fairies and other magical creatures.

&quot;Onmyoji&quot;, an original net animation adaptation by Netflix, directed by Soubi Yamamoto and produced by Marvy Jack, released on Netflix on November 28, 2023.

=== Games ===
The horror/survival PlayStation 2 video game Kuon featured Seimei as a female exorcist who becomes a playable character near the end of the game.

Abe no Seimei was made a playable character in the PlayStation 4, PlayStation Portable, Xbox One, and Wii U versions of &quot;Warriors Orochi 3&quot;.

Seimei appears in the video game &quot;&quot; as a mitama (a hero&#x27;s soul from Japanese history).

In Part 1.5 of the mobile game &quot;Fate/Grand Order&quot;, Seimei&#x27;s name is claimed as an undercover pseudonym used by Ashiya Dōman in the Shimōsa story chapter. Later, Seimei indirectly appears briefly in Part 2&#x27;s Heian-kyō story chapter as an ally to the protagonist.

&quot;Onmyoji&quot;, a mobile game, featured Abe no Seimei as the protagonist who summons various Shikigami to ward off demons alongside his onmyoji comrades.

In &quot;Dragalia Lost&quot;, Seimei plays a part as head of the Ox Clan, one of the twelve Hinomotoan clans serving Amaterasu, with his soul pact dragon Gozu Tennō and his kitsune disciple Kuzunoha.

Seimei appears as an NPC in the video game &quot;Nioh 2&quot;. Despite being from the Heian period, he strangely appears during the Sengoku era to train the players in the art of Onmyō magic. It is later revealed in the DLC &quot;Darkness in the Capital&quot; that this individual was an avatar created by the real Seimei, who had sacrificed himself alongside Minamoto no Yorimitsu to seal away Shuten Dōji and Tamamo-no-Mae within Byōdō-in during the Heian period.

Seimei appears in the PlayStation Vita game &quot;&quot; as the main villain of the game, a priest who places a curse on the main characters that shortens their lifespan to only two years.

<text>Fantasy Masterworks is a series of British paperbacks by Millennium (an imprint of Victor Gollancz). It is intended to comprise &quot;some of the greatest, most original, and most influential fantasy ever written&quot; and to contain &quot;the books which, along with Tolkien, Peake and others, shaped modern fantasy.&quot; as claimed by its publisher. 

It has a companion series in the SF Masterworks line. A separate &quot;Future Classics&quot; line has also started featuring eight science fiction novels from the last few decades.

The books were numbered only through No. 50; in the 2013 reboot of the series, the books are unnumbered, have a uniform look, and feature introductions by well-known writers and critics.

== Numbered paperback series (2000–2007) ==
== Reboot series, with new design (2013 - 2016) ==

* Also published in the &quot;Fantasy Masterworks&quot; numbered series.

<doc id="313667" wikidata="Q1146944" url="?curid=313667" title="Block (data storage)">
<text>In computing (specifically data transmission and data storage), a block, sometimes called a physical record, is a sequence of bytes or bits, usually containing some whole number of records, having a maximum length; a &quot;block size&quot;. Data thus structured are said to be &quot;blocked&quot;. The process of putting data into blocks is called &quot;blocking&quot;, while &quot;deblocking&quot; is the process of extracting data from blocks. Blocked data is normally stored in a data buffer, and read or written a whole block at a time. Blocking reduces the overhead and speeds up the handling of the data stream. For some devices, such as magnetic tape and CKD disk devices, blocking reduces the amount of external storage required for the data. Blocking is almost universally employed when storing data to 9-track magnetic tape, NAND flash memory, and rotating media such as floppy disks, hard disks, and optical discs.

Most file systems are based on a block device, which is a level of abstraction for the hardware responsible for storing and retrieving specified blocks of data, though the block size in file systems may be a multiple of the physical block size. This leads to space inefficiency due to internal fragmentation, since file lengths are often not integer multiples of block size, and thus the last block of a file may remain partially empty. This will create slack space. Some newer file systems, such as Btrfs and FreeBSD UFS2, attempt to solve this through techniques called block suballocation and tail merging. Other file systems such as ZFS support variable block sizes.

Block storage is normally abstracted by a file system or database management system (DBMS) for use by applications and end users. The physical or logical volumes accessed via &quot;block I/O&quot; may be devices internal to a server, directly attached via SCSI or Fibre Channel, or distant devices accessed via a storage area network (SAN) using a protocol such as iSCSI, or AoE. DBMSes often use their own block I/O for improved performance and recoverability as compared to layering the DBMS on top of a file system.

On Linux the default block size for most file systems is 4096 bytes. The command part of GNU Core Utilities can be used to check the block size.

In Rust a block can be read with the method.

const BLOCK_SIZE: usize = 4096;

if let Ok(mut file) = File::open(&quot;example.bin&quot;)
 let mut buf = [0u8; BLOCK_SIZE];
 file.read_exact(&amp;mut buf);


In Python a block can be read with the method.

BLOCK_SIZE = 4096

with open(&quot;example.bin&quot;, &quot;rb&quot;) as file:
 block = file.read(BLOCK_SIZE)
In C# a block can be read with the class.

const int BLOCK_SIZE = 4096;

using FileStream stream = File.Open(&quot;example.bin&quot;, FileMode.Open);
var block = new byte[BLOCK_SIZE];
await stream.ReadAsync(block, 0, BLOCK_SIZE);

<text>The Dinaric Alps (), also Dinarides, are a mountain range in Southern and Southcentral Europe, separating the continental Balkan Peninsula from the Adriatic Sea. They stretch from Italy in the northwest through Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro, and Kosovo to Albania in the southeast.

The Dinaric Alps extend for approximately along the western Balkan Peninsula from the Julian Alps of the northeast Italy, downwards to the Šar and Korab massif, where their direction changes. The Accursed Mountains are the highest section of the entire Dinaric Alps; this section stretches from Albania to Kosovo and eastern Montenegro. Maja Jezercë, standing at above the Adriatic, is the highest peak and is located in Albania.

The Dinaric Alps are one of the most rugged and extensive mountainous areas of Europe, alongside the Caucasus Mountains, Alps, Pyrenees, Carpathian Mountains and Scandinavian Mountains. They are formed largely of Mesozoic and Cenozoic sedimentary rocks of dolomite, limestone, sandstone and conglomerates formed by seas and lakes that once covered the area. During the Alpine earth movements that occurred 50 to 100 million years ago, immense lateral pressures folded and overthrust the rocks in a great arc around the old rigid block of the northeast. The main tectonic phase of the orogenesis in the area of the Dinaric Karst took place in Cenozoic Era (Paleogene) as a result of the Adriatic Microplate (Adria) collision with Europe, and the process is still active. The Dinaric Alps were thrown up in more or less parallel ranges, stretching like necklaces from the Julian Alps as far as northern Albania and Kosovo, where the mountainous terrain subsides to make way for the waters of the Drin River and the plains of Kosovo.

==Name==
The Dinarides are named after Mount Dinara (1,831 m), a prominent peak in the center of the mountain range on the border with the Dalmatian part of Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Names of the chain in local languages include or ; ; or ; .

==Geology==

The Dinaric Karst region is built mostly of Mesozoic limestone and dolomite deposited on top of a huge Bahama-type carbonate platform, while a few kilometers thick carbonate successions have been deformed during the Alpine orogenesis. The main tectonic phase of the Alpine orogenesis in the Dinaric Karst region took place in the Cenozoic Era (Paleogene) as a result of the Adriatic microplate (Adria) collision with the Serbo-Macedonian and Rhodope Massifs, and the process is still active. The Mesozoic limestone forms a very distinctive region of the Balkans, notable for features such as the Karst Plateau, which has given its name to all such terrains of limestone eroded by groundwater. The Dinarides are known for being composed of karst – limestone rocks – as is Dinara, the mountain for which they were named. The Quaternary ice ages had relatively little direct geologic influence on the Balkans. No permanent ice caps existed, and there is little evidence of extensive glaciation. Only the highest summits of Durmitor, Orjen and Prenj have glacial valleys and moraines as low as . However, in the Accursed Mountains (), a range on the northern Albanian border that runs east to west (thus breaking the general geographic trend of the Dinaric system), there is evidence of major glaciation. One geological feature of great importance to the present-day landscape of the Dinarides must be considered in more detail: that of the limestone mountains, often with their attendant faulting. They are hard and slow to erode, and often persist as steep jagged escarpments, through which steep-sided gorges and canyons are cleft by the rivers draining the higher slopes.

The partially submerged western Dinaric Alps form the numerous islands and harbors along the Croatian coast.

===Rivers in Dinaric karst===
The most extensive example of limestone mountains in Europe are those of the Karst of the Dinaric Alps. Here, all the characteristic features are encountered again and again as one travels through this wild and thinly populated country. Limestone is a very porous rock, yet very hard and resistant to erosion. Water is the most important corrosive force, dissolving the limestone by chemical action of its natural acidity. As it percolates down through cracks in the limestone it opens up fissures and channels, often of considerable depth, so that whole systems of underground drainage develop. During subsequent millennia these work deeper, leaving in their wake enormous waterless caverns, sinkholes and grottoes and forming underground labyrinths of channels and shafts. The roofs of some of these caverns may eventually fall in, to produce great perpendicular-sided gorges, exposing the surface to the water once more.

The Dinaric rivers carved many canyons characteristic for Dinaric Alps, and in particular karst. Among the largest and most well known are the Neretva, the Rakitnica, the Prača, the Drina, the Sutjeska, the Vrbas, the Ugar, the Piva, the Tara, the Komarnica, the Morača, the Cem/Ciijevna, the Lim, and the Drin.

Only along the Dinaric gorges is communication possible across the Karst, and roads and railways tunnel through precipitous cliffs and traverse narrow ledges above roaring torrents. A number of springs and rivers rise in the Dinaric range, including Jadro Spring noted for having been the source of water for Diocletian&#x27;s Palace at Split. At the same time, the purity of these rocks is such that the rivers are crystal clear, and there is little soil-making residue. Water quality testing of the Jadro River, for example, indicates the low pollutant levels present. Rock faces are often bare of vegetation and glaring white, but what little soil there is may collect in the hollows and support lush lime-tolerant vegetation, or yield narrow strips of cultivation.

==Human activity==

Ruins of fortresses dot the mountainous landscape, evidence of centuries of war and the refuge the Dinaric Alps have provided to various armed forces. During the Roman period, the Dinarides provided shelter to the Illyrians resisting Roman conquest of the Balkans, which began with the conquest of the eastern Adriatic coast in the 3rd century BC. Rome conquered the whole of Illyria in 168 BC, but these mountains sheltered Illyrian resistance forces for many years until the area&#x27;s complete subjugation by 14 AD. More recently, the Ottoman Empire failed to fully subjugate the mountainous areas of Montenegro. In the 20th century, too, the mountains provided favourable terrain for guerrilla warfare, with Yugoslav Partisans organising one of the most successful Allied resistance movements of World War II.

The area remains underpopulated, and forestry and mining remain the chief economic activities in the Dinaric Alps. The people of the Dinaric Alps are on record as being the tallest in the world, with an average male adolescent height of . The people of Bosnia and Herzegovina have the highest recorded average of any single country, with 183.9 cm average for men and 171.8 cm for women.

<doc id="313670" wikidata="Q1314091" url="?curid=313670" title="We Shall Overcome">
<text>&quot;We Shall Overcome&quot; is a gospel song that is associated heavily with the U.S. civil rights movement. The origins of the song are unclear; it was thought to have descended from &quot;I&#x27;ll Overcome Some Day,&quot; a hymn by Charles Albert Tindley, while the modern version of the song was first said to have been sung by tobacco workers led by Lucille Simmons during the 1945–1946 Charleston Cigar Factory strike in Charleston, South Carolina. 

In 1947, the song was published under the title &quot;We Will Overcome&quot; in an edition of the &quot;People&#x27;s Songs Bulletin&quot;, as a contribution of and with an introduction by Zilphia Horton, then-music director of the Highlander Folk School of Monteagle, Tennessee—an adult education school that trained union organizers. She taught it to many others, including People&#x27;s Songs director Pete Seeger, who included it in his repertoire, as did many other activist singers, such as Frank Hamilton and Joe Glazer.

In 1959, the song began to be associated with the civil rights movement as a protest song, when Guy Carawan stepped in with his and Seeger&#x27;s version as song leader at Highlander, which was then focused on nonviolent civil rights activism. It quickly became the movement&#x27;s unofficial anthem. Seeger and other famous folksingers in the early 1960s, such as Joan Baez, sang the song at rallies, folk festivals, and concerts in the North and helped make it widely known. Since its rise to prominence, the song, and songs based on it, have been used in a variety of protests worldwide.

The U.S. copyright of the &quot;People&#x27;s Songs Bulletin&quot; issue which contained &quot;We Will Overcome&quot; expired in 1976, but The Richmond Organization (TRO) asserted a copyright on the &quot;We Shall Overcome&quot; lyrics, registered in 1960. In 2017, in response to a lawsuit against TRO over allegations of false copyright claims, a U.S. judge issued an opinion that the registered work was insufficiently different from the &quot;We Will Overcome&quot; lyrics that had fallen into the public domain because of non-renewal. In January 2018, the company agreed to a settlement under which it would no longer assert any copyright claims over the song.

In 2025, the publication &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Seeger&#x27;s adaptation of the song at number 8 on its list of &quot;The 100 Best Protest Songs of All Time.&quot;

==Origins as gospel, folk, and labor song==
&quot;I&#x27;ll Overcome Some Day&quot; was a hymn or gospel music composition by the Reverend Charles Albert Tindley of Philadelphia that was first published in 1901. A noted minister of the Methodist Episcopal Church, Tindley was the author of approximately 50 gospel hymns, of which &quot;We&#x27;ll Understand It By and By&quot; and &quot;Stand By Me&quot; are among the best known. The published text bore the epigraph, &quot;Ye shall overcome if ye faint not&quot;, derived from Galatians 6:9: &quot;And let us not be weary in doing good, for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.&quot; The first stanza began:

Tindley&#x27;s songs were written in an idiom rooted in African American folk traditions, using pentatonic intervals, with ample space allowed for improvised interpolation, the addition of &quot;blue&quot; thirds and sevenths, and frequently featuring short refrains in which the congregation could join. Tindley&#x27;s importance, however, was primarily as a lyricist and poet whose words spoke directly to the feelings of his audiences, many of whom had been freed from slavery only 36 years before he first published his songs, and were often impoverished, illiterate, and newly arrived in the North. &quot;Even today,&quot; wrote musicologist Horace Boyer in 1983, &quot;ministers quote his texts in the midst of their sermons as if they were poems, as indeed they are.&quot;

A letter printed on the front page of February 1909, &quot;United Mine Workers Journal&quot; states: &quot;Last year at a strike, we opened every meeting with a prayer, and singing that good old song, &#x27;We Will Overcome&#x27;.&quot; This statement implied that the song was well-known, and it was also the first acknowledgment of such a song having been sung in both a secular context and a mixed-race setting.

Tindley&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;ll Overcome Some Day&quot; was believed to have influenced the structure for &quot;We Shall Overcome&quot;, with both the text and the melody having undergone a process of alteration. The tune has been changed so that it now echoes the opening and closing melody of &quot;No More Auction Block For Me&quot;, also known from its refrain as &quot;Many Thousands Gone&quot;. This was number 35 in Thomas Wentworth Higginson&#x27;s collection of Negro Spirituals that appeared in the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot; of June 1867, with a comment by Higginson reflecting on how such songs were composed (i.e., whether the work of a single author or through what used to be called &quot;communal composition&quot;):

Bob Dylan used the same melodic motif from &quot;No More Auction Block&quot; for his composition, &quot;Blowin&#x27; in the Wind&quot;. Thus similarities of melodic and rhythmic patterns imparted cultural and emotional resonance (&quot;the same feeling&quot;) towards three different, and historically very significant songs.

Music scholars have also pointed out that the first half of &quot;We Shall Overcome&quot; bears a notable resemblance to the famous lay Catholic hymn &quot;O Sanctissima&quot;, also known as &quot;The Sicilian Mariners Hymn&quot;, first published by a London magazine in 1792 and then by an American magazine in 1794 and widely circulated in American hymnals. The second half of &quot;We Shall Overcome&quot; is essentially the same music as the 19th-century hymn &quot;I&#x27;ll Be All Right&quot;. As Victor Bobetsky summarized in his 2015 book on the subject: &quot;&#x27;We Shall Overcome&#x27; owes its existence to many ancestors and to the constant change and adaptation that is typical of the folk music process.&quot;

==Role of the Highlander Folk School==
In October 1945 in Charleston, South Carolina, members of the Food, Tobacco, Agricultural, and Allied Workers union (FTA-CIO), who were mostly female and African American, began a five-month strike against the American Tobacco Company. To keep up their spirits during the cold, wet winter of 1945–1946, one of the strikers, a woman named Lucille Simmons, led a slow &quot;long meter style&quot; version of the gospel hymn, &quot;We&#x27;ll Overcome (I&#x27;ll Be All Right)&quot; to end each day&#x27;s picketing. Union organizer Zilphia Horton, who was the wife of the co-founder of the Highlander Folk School (later Highlander Research and Education Center), said she learned it from Simmons. Horton was Highlander&#x27;s music director during 1935–1956, and it became her custom to end group meetings each evening by leading this, her favorite song. During the presidential campaign of Henry A. Wallace, &quot;We Will Overcome&quot; was printed in &quot;Bulletin No. 3&quot; (September 1948), 8, of People&#x27;s Songs, with an introduction by Horton saying that she had learned it from the interracial FTA-CIO workers and had found it to be extremely powerful. Pete Seeger, a founding member of People&#x27;s Songs and its director for three years, learned it from Horton&#x27;s version in 1947. Seeger writes: &quot;I changed it to &#x27;We shall&#x27;... I think I liked a more open sound; &#x27;We will&#x27; has alliteration to it, but &#x27;We shall&#x27; opens the mouth wider; the &#x27;i&#x27; in &#x27;will&#x27; is not an easy vowel to sing well ...&quot; Seeger also added some verses (&quot;We&#x27;ll walk hand in hand&quot; and &quot;The whole wide world around&quot;).

In 1950, the CIO&#x27;s Department of Education and Research released the album, &quot;Eight New Songs for Labor&quot;, sung by Joe Glazer (&quot;Labor&#x27;s Troubador&quot;), and the Elm City Four. (Songs on the album were: &quot;I Ain&#x27;t No Stranger Now&quot;, &quot;Too Old to Work&quot;, &quot;That&#x27;s All&quot;, &quot;Humblin&#x27; Back&quot;, &quot;Shine on Me&quot;, &quot;Great Day&quot;, &quot;The Mill Was Made of Marble&quot;, and &quot;We Will Overcome&quot;.) During a Southern CIO drive, Glazer taught the song to country singer Texas Bill Strength, who cut a version that was later picked up by 4-Star Records.

The song made its first recorded appearance as &quot;We Shall Overcome&quot; (rather than &quot;We Will Overcome&quot;) in 1952 on a disc recorded by Laura Duncan (soloist) and The Jewish Young Singers (chorus), conducted by Robert De Cormier, co-produced by Ernie Lieberman and Irwin Silber on Hootenany Records (Hoot 104-A) (Folkways, FN 2513, BCD15720), where it is identified as a Negro Spiritual.

Frank Hamilton, a folk singer from California who was a member of People&#x27;s Songs and later The Weavers, picked up Seeger&#x27;s version. Hamilton&#x27;s friend and traveling companion, fellow-Californian Guy Carawan, learned the song from Hamilton. Carawan and Hamilton, accompanied by Ramblin Jack Elliot, visited Highlander in the early 1950s where they also would have heard Zilphia Horton sing the song. In 1957, Seeger sang for a Highlander audience that included Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., who remarked on the way to his next stop, in Kentucky, about how much the song had stuck with him. When, in 1959, Guy Carawan succeeded Horton as music director at Highlander, he reintroduced it at the school. It was the young (many of them teenagers) student-activists at Highlander, however, who gave the song the words and rhythms for which it is currently known, when they sang it to keep their spirits up during the frightening police raids on Highlander and their subsequent stays in jail in 1959–1960. Because of this, Carawan has been reluctant to claim credit for the song&#x27;s widespread popularity. In the PBS video &quot;We Shall Overcome&quot;, Julian Bond credits Carawan with teaching and singing the song at the founding meeting of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee in Raleigh, North Carolina, in 1960. From there, it spread orally and became an anthem of Southern African American labor union and civil rights activism. Seeger has also publicly, in concert, credited Carawan with the primary role of teaching and popularizing the song within the civil rights movement.

==Use in the 1960s civil rights and other protest movements==
In August 1963, 22-year old folksinger Joan Baez led a crowd of 3,000 in singing &quot;We Shall Overcome&quot; at the Lincoln Memorial during A. Philip Randolph&#x27;s March on Washington. President Lyndon Johnson, himself a Southerner, used the phrase &quot;we shall overcome&quot; in addressing Congress on March 15, 1965, in a speech delivered after the violent &quot;Bloody Sunday&quot; attacks on civil rights demonstrators during the Selma to Montgomery marches, thus legitimizing the protest movement.

Four days before the April 4, 1968 assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., King recited the words from &quot;We Shall Overcome&quot; in his final sermon, delivered in Memphis on Sunday, March 31. He had done so in a similar sermon he gave previously in 1965 to an interfaith congregation at Temple Israel of Hollywood, California:

&quot;We Shall Overcome&quot; was sung days later by over fifty thousand attendees at the funeral of Martin Luther King Jr.

Farmworkers in the United States later sang the song in Spanish during the strikes and grape boycotts of the late 1960s. The song was notably sung by the U.S. Senator for New York Robert F. Kennedy, when he led anti-Apartheid crowds in choruses from the rooftop of his car while touring South Africa in 1966. It was also the song which Abie Nathan chose to broadcast as the anthem of the Voice of Peace radio station on October 1, 1993, and as a result it found its way back to South Africa in the later years of the Anti-Apartheid Movement.

William Bradford Reynolds, facing a mounting torrent of criticism for not moving fast enough on civil rights enforcement in the 1980s, sang &quot;We Shall Overcome&quot; hand in hand with Jesse Jackson on a trip to meet with the black communities of the Mississippi Delta.

The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association adopted &quot;we shall overcome&quot; as a slogan and used it in the title of its retrospective publication, &quot;We Shall Overcome – The History of the Struggle for Civil Rights in Northern Ireland 1968–1978&quot;. The film &quot;Bloody Sunday&quot; depicts march leader and Member of Parliament (MP) Ivan Cooper leading the song shortly before 1972&#x27;s Bloody Sunday shootings. In 1997, the Christian men&#x27;s ministry, Promise Keepers featured the song on its worship CD for that year: &quot;The Making of a Godly Man&quot;, featuring worship leader Donn Thomas and the Maranatha! Promise Band. Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s re-interpretation of the song was included on the 1998 tribute album &quot;Where Have All the Flowers Gone: The Songs of Pete Seeger&quot; as well as on Springsteen&#x27;s 2006 album &quot;We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions&quot;.

==Widespread adaptation==
&quot;We Shall Overcome&quot; was adopted by various labor, nationalist, and political movements both during and after the Cold War. In his memoir about his years teaching English in Czechoslovakia after the Velvet Revolution, Mark Allen wrote:

The words &quot;We shall overcome&quot; are sung emphatically at the end of each verse in a song of Northern Ireland&#x27;s civil rights movement, &quot;Free the People&quot;, which protested against the internment policy of the British Army. The movement in Northern Ireland was keen to emulate the movement in the US and often sang &quot;We shall overcome&quot;.

The melody was also used (crediting it to Tindley) in a symphony by American composer William Rowland. In 1999, National Public Radio included &quot;We Shall Overcome&quot; on the &quot;NPR 100&quot; list of most important American songs of the 20th century. As a reference to the line, in 2009, after the first inauguration of Barack Obama as the 44th President of the United States, a man holding the banner, &quot;WE HAVE OVERCOME&quot; was seen near the Capitol, a day after hundreds of people posed with the sign on Martin Luther King Jr. Day.

As the attempted serial killer &quot;Lasermannen&quot; shot several immigrants around Stockholm in 1992, Prime Minister Carl Bildt and Immigration Minister Birgit Friggebo attended a meeting in Rinkeby. As the audience became upset, Friggebo tried to calm them down by proposing everyone sing &quot;We Shall Overcome&quot;. This statement is widely regarded as one of the most embarrassing moments in Swedish politics. In 2008, the newspaper &quot;Svenska Dagbladet&quot; listed the Sveriges Television recording of the event as the best political clip available on YouTube.

On June 7, 2010, Roger Waters of Pink Floyd fame released a new version of the song as a protest against the Israeli blockade of Gaza.

On July 22, 2012, Bruce Springsteen performed the song during the memorial-concert in Oslo after the terrorist attacks in Norway on July 22, 2011.

In India, the renowned poet Girija Kumar Mathur composed a literal translation in Hindi &quot;&quot;Hum Honge Kaamyab (हम होंगे कामयाब)&quot; which became a popular patriotic/spiritual song during the 1970s and 1980s, particularly in schools. This song also came to be used by the Blue Pilgrims for motivating the India national football team during international matches.

In Bengali-speaking India and Bangladesh, there are two versions, both of which are popular among schoolchildren and political activists. &quot;Amra Korbo Joy&quot; (আমরা করবো জয়)”, is a literal translation by Bengali folk singer Hemanga Biswas, re-recorded by Bhupen Hazarika. Hazarika, who had heard the song during his days in the United States, also translated the song to Assamese as &quot;Ami hom xophol&quot; (আমি হ&#x27;ম সফল). Another version, translated by Shibdas Bandyopadhyay, &quot;Ek Din Shurjer Bhor&quot; (এক দিন সূর্যের ভোর, literally &quot;One Day The Sun Will Rise&quot;&quot;) was arranged by Ruma Guha Thakurta and recorded by the Calcutta Youth Choir during the 1971 Bangladesh War of Independence, becoming one of the bestselling Bengali records. It was a favorite of Prime Minister Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, and it was regularly sung at public events after Bangladesh gained its independence in the early 1970s.

In the Indian state of Kerala, a traditional Communist stronghold, the song became popular on college campuses during the late 1970s. It was the struggle song of the Students Federation of India (SFI), the largest student organisation in the country. The song translated into the local Malayalam as “&quot;Nammal Vijayikkum”&quot; by SFI activist N. P. Chandrasekharan, using the same tune of the original. Later, it was published in &quot;Student&quot;, the monthly magazine of SFI in Malayalam as well as in &quot;Sarvadesheeya Ganangal&quot; (Mythri Books, Thiruvananthapuram), a translation of international struggle songs.

&quot;We Shall Overcome&quot; was a prominent song in the 2010 Bollywood film &quot;My Name is Khan&quot;, which compared the struggle of Muslims in modern America with the struggles of African Americans in the past. The song was sung in both English and Hindi in the film, which starred Kajol and Shahrukh Khan.

In 2014, a recording of &quot;We Shall Overcome&quot; arranged by composer Nolan Williams Jr. and featuring mezzo-soprano Denyce Graves was among several works of art, including the poem &quot;A Brave and Startling Truth&quot; by Maya Angelou, were sent to space on the first test flight of the spacecraft Orion.

The Argentine writer and singer María Elena Walsh wrote a Spanish version called &quot;Venceremos&quot;.

Celtic punk band Dropkick Murphys released their version of the song as a single and music video in 2022. Their version can also be found on the expanded edition of their 2021 album, &quot;Turn Up That Dial&quot;.

==Copyright status==
The copyright status of &quot;We Shall Overcome&quot; was disputed in the late 2010s. A copyright registration was made for the song in 1960, which is credited as an arrangement by Zilphia Horton, Guy Carawan, Frank Hamilton, and Pete Seeger, of a work entitled &quot;I&#x27;ll Overcome&quot;, with no known original author. Horton&#x27;s heirs, Carawan, Hamilton, and Seeger share the artists&#x27; half of the rights, and The Richmond Organization (TRO), which includes Ludlow Music, Essex, Folkways Music, and Hollis Music, holds the publishers&#x27; rights, to 50% of the royalty earnings. Seeger explained that he registered the copyright under the advice of TRO, who showed concern that someone else could register it. &quot;At that time we didn&#x27;t know Lucille Simmons&#x27; name&quot;, Seeger said. Their royalties go to the &quot;We Shall Overcome&quot; Fund, administered by Highlander under the trusteeship of the &quot;writers&quot;. Such funds are purportedly used to give small grants for cultural expression involving African Americans organizing in the U.S. South.

In April 2016, a lawsuit was filed against TRO and Ludlow by the We Shall Overcome Foundation (WSOF), a group led by producer Isaias Gamboa that was denied permission to use the song in a documentary on its history. The suit alleged that the TRO-Ludlow copyright claims were invalid because the copyright had not been renewed as required by United States copyright law at the time, and that the copyright of the 1948 &quot;People&#x27;s Songs&quot; publication containing &quot;We Will Overcome&quot; had therefore expired in 1976. Additionally, it was argued that the registered copyrights only covered specific arrangements of the tune and &quot;obscure alternate verses&quot;, that the registered works &quot;did not contain original works of authorship, except to the extent of the arrangements themselves&quot;, and that no record of a work entitled &quot;I&#x27;ll Overcome&quot; existed in the database of the United States Copyright Office. The WSOF was working on a documentary about the song and its history, and were denied permission to use the song by TRO-Ludlow. The suit sought to have the copyright status of the song clarified, and the return of all royalties collected by the companies from its usage.

The suit acknowledged that Seeger himself had not claimed to be an author of the song, stating of the song in his autobiography, &quot;No one is certain who changed &#x27;will&#x27; to &#x27;shall.&#x27; It could have been me with my Harvard education. But Septima Clarke, a Charleston schoolteacher (who was director of education at Highlander and after the civil rights movement was elected year after year to the Charleston, S.C. Board of Education) always preferred &#x27;shall.&#x27; It sings better.&quot; He also reaffirmed that the decision to copyright the song was a defensive measure, with his publisher apparently warning him that &quot;if you don&#x27;t copyright this now, some Hollywood types will have a version out next year like &#x27;Come on Baby, We shall overcome tonight. Furthermore, the liner notes of Seeger&#x27;s compilation album &quot;If I Had a Hammer: Songs of Hope &amp; Struggle&quot; contained a summary on the purported history of the song, stating that &quot;We Shall Overcome&quot; was &quot;probably adapted from the 19th-century hymn, &#x27;I&#x27;ll Be All Right, and that &quot;I&#x27;ll Overcome Some Day&quot; was a &quot;possible source&quot; and may have originally been adapted from &quot;I&#x27;ll Be All Right&quot;. 

Gamboa had shown interest in investigating the origins of &quot;We Shall Overcome&quot;; in a book entitled &quot;We Shall Overcome: Sacred Song On The Devil&#x27;s Tongue&quot;, he notably disputed the song&#x27;s claimed origins and copyright registration with an alternate theory, suggesting that &quot;We Shall Overcome&quot; was actually derived from &quot;If My Jesus Wills&quot;, a hymn by Louise Shropshire that had been composed in the 1930s and had its copyright registered in 1954. The WSOF lawsuit did not invoke this theory, focusing instead on the original belief that the song stemmed from &quot;We Will Overcome&quot;. The lawyer backing Gamboa&#x27;s suit, Mark C. Rifkin, was previously involved in a case that invalidated copyright claims over the song &quot;Happy Birthday to You&quot;.

On September 8, 2017, Judge Denise Cote of the Southern District of New York issued an opinion that there were insufficient differences between the first verse of the &quot;We Shall Overcome&quot; lyrics registered by TRO-Ludlow, and the &quot;We Will Overcome&quot; lyrics from &quot;People&#x27;s Songs&quot; (specifically, the aforementioned replacement of &quot;will&quot; with &quot;shall&quot;, and changing &quot;down in my heart&quot; to &quot;deep in my heart&quot;) for it to qualify as a distinct derivative work eligible for its own copyright.

On January 26, 2018, TRO-Ludlow agreed to a final settlement, under which it would no longer claim copyright over the melody or lyrics to &quot;We Shall Overcome&quot;. In addition, TRO-Ludlow agreed that the melody and lyrics were thereafter dedicated to the public domain.

<doc id="313671" wikidata="Q313320" url="?curid=313671" title="Akechi Mitsuhide">
<text>, first called Jūbei from his clan and later from his title, was a Japanese &quot;samurai&quot; general of the Sengoku period. Mitsuhide was originally a bodyguard of Ashikaga Yoshiaki and later, one of the trusted generals under &quot;daimyō&quot; Oda Nobunaga during his war of political unification in Japan.

Mitsuhide rebelled against Nobunaga for unknown reasons in the Honnō-ji Incident in 1582, forcing the unprotected Nobunaga to commit &quot;seppuku&quot; in Kyoto.

Mitsuhide attempted to establish himself as &quot;shōgun&quot;, but was pursued by Nobunaga&#x27;s successor Toyotomi Hideyoshi and defeated at the Battle of Yamazaki. The 13-days short reign of Mitsuhide is listed as the inspiration for the yojijukugo set phrase .

He is still popular in present culture. A ceremonial activity was held on April 15, 2018, in Kyoto.

== Biography ==
===Early life===
Akechi Mitsuhide was believed to be born on 10 March 1528 in Tara Castle, Mino Province (present-day Kani, Gifu Prefecture). In the Akechi Family Tree recorded in &quot;Zoku Gunsho Ruiju&quot; and the &quot;Mino no Kuni Shokki&quot;, it is said that the Akechi clan which Mitsuhide hailed from were descended as branch of Toki clan of the Seiwa Genji clan, where the Toki clan served as shugo in Mino Province for over 200 years from the Kenmu Restoration, and has produced several dozen branches from then on. However, there are no primary historical sources that supported this claim. Moreover, when Ashikaga Yoshiaki was staying in Echizen Province, Mitsuhide served as a foot soldier (made up of those who were not direct vassals of the Shogun) recruited during the time of Ashikaga Yoshiteru. This cast doubts among historian he was not from the main line of the Akechi clan of the Toki clan, who were listed in the hokoshu, a higher rank than the foot soldiers. His father is listed as Akechi Mitsutsuna in various genealogies from the Edo period. Furthermore, historian Kobayashi Masanobu stated that the name of Mitsusuna, father of Mitsuhide, cannot be found in historical documents of Akechi clan from Toki branch. Thus Tadachika Kuwata suspected that he came from lower branch of Akechi clan, not the main branch.

Mitsuhide is rumored to be a childhood friend or cousin of Nōhime. It is believed that he was raised to be a general among 10,000 by Saitō Dōsan and the Toki clan during their governorship of the Mino Province. When Dōsan&#x27;s son, Saitō Yoshitatsu, rebelled against his father in 1556, Mitsuhide sided with Dōsan.

=== Service under Ashikaga Shogunate ===
Mitsuhide began serving the &quot;wandering &quot;shōgun&quot;&quot; Ashikaga Yoshiaki as one of his guardians under Hosokawa Fujitaka. &quot;Shōgun&quot; Ashikaga Yoshiaki asked Asakura Yoshikage to be his official protector, an offer which Yoshikage declined. Later, Yoshiaki appealed to Mitsuhide, who suggested Oda Nobunaga instead.

In 1567, after Nobunaga conquered Mino and Ise Province, Mitsuhide, Nobunaga and also Yoshiaki marched through Omi province to Kyoto.

In 1568 November, Nobunaga, Yoshiaki and Mitsuhide arrived in Kyoto, the capital of Japan. Later, Nobunaga made Yoshiaki the next shogun and turned Honkoku-ji Temple into a temporary Shogun palace.

In 1569, on January 21, the Miyoshi clan triumvirate (&quot;Miyoshi Saninshu&quot;) attacked Ashikaga Yoshiaki at Honkoku-ji temple. In this battle, Mitsuhide and Hosokawa Fujitaka defended the shōgun and repulsed the Miyoshi clan. On April, Mitsuhide worked together with Kinoshita Hideyoshi (later changing his surname to Hashiba), Niwa Nagahide, and Nakagawa Shigemasa, as he was tasked as magistrate to manage the government affairs of Kyoto and the surrounding areas under the control of Oda Nobunaga.

In 1570, on the first day of June, at the Siege Kanegasaki in Echizen Province, Mitsuhide led the rearguard of the Oda forces when Nobunaga gave the order to retreat. Later in September, during the conflict between the Oda clan and the forces of Saika Ikki, Mitsuhide was assigned to guard Usayama Castle with 300-400 garrison soldiers under his command.

In 1571, after the successful attack at the Ikkō-ikki Enryaku-ji temple, Mitsuhide received the area of Sakamoto and built Sakamoto Castle. During this battle, about 18 soldiers from Akechi&#x27;s army were killed. Mitsuhide donated rice offerings to the Saigyo-ji Temple to mourn the fallen. A letter of donation from Mitsuhide remains at the temple, and one of the 18 people mentioned in it was not a samurai but a &quot;chūkan&quot; In addition, two letters of condolence from Mitsuhide to his vassals who were injured in the battle remain. In July, after Shogun Ashikaga Yoshiaki was defeated in the battle of Makishima Castle, he became exiled, and the Muromachi Shogunate was virtually abolished. Thereby, Many of the former Shogunate vassals, including Ise Sadaoki and other members of the Ise clan, and Suwa Morinao, entered service as vassals of Mitsuhide.

In 1572, Mitsuhide continued serving Shogun Yoshiaki by contributing to the campaign in Kawachi Province under Ashikaga Yoshiteru.

=== Service under Oda Nobunaga ===
In 1573, the relationship between Ashikaga Yoshiaki and Nobunaga worsened as Ashikaga raised a coalition against Nobunaga with Takeda Shingen on February. Mitsuhide sided with Nobunaga and participated in the battles of Ishiyama Castle and Imakatata Castle as a direct vassal of Nobunaga. Mitsuhide brought his vassals such as Akechi Yahei, Akechi Jurozaemon, Akechi Jyuemon, Tsumaki Kazue, Miyake Tobei, Fujita Dengo, Matsuda Tarozaemon, and Hida Tatewaki to these battles, killing 58 samurai and over 300 non-samurai infantries of Ashikaga. After the end of the battle, Nobunaga intended to repair his relationship with Ashikaga and opened peace negotiation with him, although it immediately collapsed just before they were concluded due to interference from Matsunaga Hisahide.

In 1574, after the Ashikaga Shogunate ended, Mitsuhide served as a dual magistrate, assessing taxes on temple holdings in Kyōto and its environs.

In 1575, He participated in the Siege of Takaya Castle (高屋城の戦い) against Miyoshi Yasunaga-Ikko Ikki coalition, and then in the Battle of Nagashino against the Takeda clan. After that, Nobunaga sent Akechi Mitsuhide to take control of Tanba Province. Mitsuhide attempted diplomacy and won over a number of the smaller local lords to his side. However, the Akai clan were adamant in their opposition, and Mitsuhide was forced to lay siege to Kuroi Castle for two months in the winter of 1575. According to the &quot;Yoshikawa clan&#x27;s record&quot;, even though many of local lords in Tanba has joined the anti-Nobunaga force, the majority of them keep their loyalty to Nobunaga and supporting Mitsuhide. in this campaign. Later, he was awarded the Court titles of &quot;Junior Fifth Rank (Lower)&quot; and &quot;Governor of Hyūga&quot;, and the honorary title of &quot;Koretō Hyūga-no-kami&quot;. In June, Nobunaga ordered him to pacify Tanba Province and Tango Province. During this campaign in Tanba Province, Mitsuhide cooperated with local lords such as Obata Nagaaki from Funai County. In addition, Kawakatsu Tsuguhisa from Imamiya, Kuwata County, had also switched sides to the Oda side after being persuaded by Obata. On July, Mitsuhide began attacking pro-Yoshiaki local lords of Tanba such as Utsuno Yorishige with the help of Obata and Kawakatsu. However, at the same time he was also ordered by Nobunaga to send reinforcements to Echizen and Tango, and left the area. On August, Utsuno Yorishige attacked the Oda clan&#x27;s Umaji Castle and Amarube Castle. The reason behind this order was said to be a checkmate against Akai Naomasa of Hikami County, who was pursuing attacks on Izushi Castle and Takeda Castle in Tajima, which were the territory of the Yamana clan, while showing an ambiguous attitude toward Nobunaga&#x27;s attack on Tanba. Later, Mitsuhide returned to Sakamoto Castle, and on October began a new attack on Tanba. Utsu Yorishige fled without fighting, and Mitsuhide then besieged Kuroi Castle, where Akai Naomasa had returned after giving up on the attack on Takeda Castle. Later, Mitsuhide built fortifications on at least three separate places in his effort to besiege and capture Kuroi Castle.

In January 1576, Akai Naomasa suddenly attacked Mitsuhide, where they engaged in the battle of Kuroi Castle, forcing Mitsuhide to retreat his forces. In April, Naomasa and his relative, Akai Tadai, submitted once again to Nobunaga Nobunaga, as they feared the reprisal from the Oda clan, albeit it was argued that it was Mitsuhide&#x27;s role to negotiate and convince them to do so. Later in the same month, during the Ishiyama Hongan-ji War, Mitsuhide, Hosokawa Fujitaka, Harada Naomasa, and Araki Murashige led the Oda forces against the Ikkō-ikki in the battle of Tenno-ji. On May 5, Mitsuhide involved in a battle where one of his general, Hanawa Naomasa, was killed in battle. Mitsuhide were cornered by the Ikkō rebel forces at Tenno-ji Fort, until he relieved by Nobunaga&#x27;s aid. On May 23, Mitsuhide fell ill due to overwork and had to recuperate for a while. Meanwhile, in Tanba Province, the Hatano clan under Hatano Hideharu, the lord of Yakami Castle, declared independence and rebelled against Nobunaga. Hideharu sudden insurrection caught Mitsuhide in surprise and defeated his forces. During this battle, Hyōdayū Horibe, who acted as Mitsuhide&#x27;s Kagemusha (replacement), was killed.

In 1577, Mitsuhide, along with Hosokawa Fujitaka and Tsutsui Junkei, fought under Oda Nobutada in the Siege of Shigisan against Matsunaga Hisahide, who had rebelled against Nobunaga. Later, Mitsuhide took part in the Battle of Tedorigawa against Uesugi Kenshin.

In 1578, two years after the Hatano clan rebelled, Nobunaga ordered Mitsuhide to return to Tanba Province and subdue them. Mitsuhide defeated several rebel clans allied to the Hatano. He defeated the Akai clan, led by Akai Naomasa, at the second siege of Kuroi castle. On March, after Naomasa died of an illness, Mitsuhide brought his forces to attack Sonobe Castle and forced the defender, Araki Ujitsuna, to surrender. For this successful campaign, Nobunaga awarded Mitsuhide Kameyama Castle, and Tanba Province as a fief with revenue of 550,000 &quot;koku&quot;. On June 4, Mitsuhide was sent to Harima Province as reinforcements for Hideyoshi, who was attacking the Mōri clan, where he participated in the siege of Kamiyoshi Castle. However, in September, a huge uprising broke out in Tanba Province, and even Umahori Castle, which was a key location for the defense of Kameyama Castle, was temporarily occupied by the rebels. Mitsuhide returned to Tanba in response and recapture the castle. Later, Mitsuhide besiege Yakami Castle which held by Hatano Hideharu. However, as Yakami Castle was a mountain castle which very difficult to capture. Mitsuhide then decided to a strategy of besieging Yakami Castle commence separate operations to subdue another subsidiary fortresses belongs to Hideharu one by one to isolate Yakami castle. Mitsuhide first dug a moat around Yakami Castle, built earthworks, and then built walls and fences on top of it. By completely surrounding Yakami Castle, he prevented military supplies and ammunition from being brought into the castle. After completely surrounding Yakami Castle in this way, started to capture the other fortresses.
In 1579, the conflict of the Oda clan against Hatano Hideharu in Tanba province reached its final stage. However in January, Hatano&#x27;s forces counterattacked and Obata Nagaakira, one of the few Tanba locals who had consistently supported the Oda clan, was killed. Mitsuhide gave Nagaakira&#x27;s surviving child the surname Akechi, and although he allowed the Obata clan to appoint a temporary representative, he ordered that Nagaakira&#x27;s son must become the head of the family after he reached adulthood. Later, Mitsuhide stormed and captured Kuroi Castle, causing Akai Naoyoshi, who was 9 years old at the time, fled the castle. After Tanba was pacified, Mitsuhide distribute a fief of 10,000 koku to Saitō Toshimitsu and appoint him as the lord of Kuroi Castle, and governance of Hikami district.

In 1580, Nobunaga dismissed his most important commander, Sakuma Nobumori. Mitsuhide replaced Nobumori in command and came to lead the largest force in the Kinki area (Kansai). This move was often said to be linked to the Honnō-ji Incident.

In 1581, Nobunaga assigned Mitsuhide to manage the &quot;Kyōto ouma-zoroi&quot; (&quot;Kyōto Mounted Horse Parade&quot;), a large-scale military parade held to the east of the Imperial Palace in Kyōto.

=== Honnō-ji Incident ===

In 1582, Mitsuhide was ordered by Nobunaga to march west to assist Hashiba Hideyoshi who was at that time fighting the Mōri clan. Ignoring his orders, Mitsuhide assembled an army of 13,000 soldiers and moved against Nobunaga&#x27;s position at Honnō-ji. On June 21, Mitsuhide was quoted as saying, &quot;The enemy is at Honnō-ji!&quot; His army surrounded the temple and eventually set it on fire. Oda Nobunaga was killed either during the fighting, or by his own hand. Nobunaga&#x27;s son, Oda Nobutada, fled the scene, but was surrounded at , a fortified imperial villa near today&#x27;s Nijō Castle, and killed. Despite not killing Nobunaga personally, Mitsuhide claimed responsibility for his death.

Mitsuhide&#x27;s betrayal of the Oda shocked the capital, and he was forced to move quickly to secure his position. Mitsuhide looted Azuchi castle to reward his men and maintain their loyalty.

Mitsuhide attempted to make gestures of friendship to a panicked Imperial Court; he also made many attempts to win over the other clans, but to no avail.

Meanwhile, Hosokawa Fujitaka, to whom he was related through marriage, quickly cut ties with him, as well as Tsutsui Junkei, who refused to take Akechi&#x27;s side, and half-heartedly supported Hideyoshi. Tetsuo Owada argued that the biggest mistake of Mitsuhide after he killed Nobunaga was that he could not provide the head of either Nobunaga or Nobutada as proof, since it would backfire as many daimyo lords doubt his success, while Hideyoshi managed to spun his propaganda that Nobunaga was still alive and escaped the assassination attempt. This caused Mitsuhide&#x27;s reputation to be further undermined as many began to doubt his capability to kill Nobunaga, while most of Oda vassals and allies rather expecting the return of Nobunaga than accepting the invitation from Mitsuhide to join him.

=== Death ===

Mitsuhide had counted on Toyotomi Hideyoshi being occupied fighting with the Mori, and unable to respond to Mitsuhide&#x27;s coup d&#x27;état. However, having learned of the assassination of his lord, Hideyoshi quickly signed a peace treaty with the Mori, and alongside Tokugawa Ieyasu rushed to be the first to avenge Nobunaga. Hideyoshi force marched his army to Settsu in four days, and caught Mitsuhide off guard.

Mitsuhide had been unable to garner support for his cause, and his army had dwindled down to 10,000 men. Hideyoshi, however, had won over former Oda retainers, including Niwa Nagahide and Ikeda Tsuneoki, and had a strength of 20,000 men. In July 2, 1582, the two forces met at the Battle of Yamazaki.

Mitsuhide took up a position south of Shōryūji Castle, securing his right flank by the Yodo river, and his left at the foot of the 270-metre Tennozan. Hideyoshi immediately seized the advantage by securing the heights of Tennōzan; his vanguard then maneuvered to face the Akechi forces along the Enmyōji river.

Mitsuhide&#x27;s forces made a failed attempt to force Hideyoshi from Tennōzan. Ikeda Tsuneoki moved to reinforce Hideyoshi&#x27;s right flank, which soon crossed Enmyōji-gawa and turned the Akechi flank. Simultaneously, Hideyoshi&#x27;s forces marched against the Akechi front; this started a rout, only two hours after the battle had begun.

Mitsuhide&#x27;s men fled, with the exception of the 200 men under Mimaki Kaneaki (御牧 兼顕), who charged and were destroyed by Hideyoshi&#x27;s larger force. Soon, panic set in among the Akechi army, and Hideyoshi&#x27;s army chased them back to Shōryūji, where the garrison collapsed. The bandit leader Nakamura Chōbei later killed Mitsuhide as Mitsuhide fled the battle.

===Tensho Koshirae sword===
The &quot;Tensho Koshirae&quot; was first forged during the Azuchi-Momoyama Era and was meant to be a replica of Akechi Mitsuhide&#x27;s sword. These katanas were made for practical use and thus had a simplistic design philosophy and the metal tempered to be strong and durable. The Akechi family was able to trace their heritage to the Toki clan and from there to the Minamoto clan.

Approximately 230 volumes, including hardcover and revised editions, have been published in total.

Superseding the earlier series Gollancz Classic SF (1986–1987) and VGSF Classics (1988–1990), the SF Masterworks series began publication in 1999. Developed to feature important and out of print science fiction novels, the selections were described by science fiction author Iain M. Banks as &quot;amazing&quot; and &quot;genuinely the best novels from sixty years of SF&quot;. Many of the selections had been out of print in the United Kingdom for many years.

Its companion series include [[Fantasy Masterworks]] and Gateway Essentials.

== Numbered series ==
=== Softcover editions (1999–2007) ===

=== Hardcover editions (2001) ===
Not all printings include a volume number stamp. Printings distributed to the United States do not include any markings to indicate they are part of a series.
== Relaunch series ==
=== Softcover editions (2010–present) ===
The new designs sport yellow/white spines, with the SF Masterworks logo written vertically on the cover. The original 10 numbered titles were re-issued first. For titles that were previously issued in the original series, generally the cover artwork is tinted in a different colour from the original version. For example, &quot;The Dispossessed&quot; cover artwork is primarily red in the original release, and was tinted green when reprinted as part of the relaunch.

Only two titles from the numbered series have not yet been reprinted in the relaunch series: &quot;The Drowned World&quot; and &quot;Now Wait for Last Year&quot;. Since these are also the only entries missing from the &quot;Complete List&quot; of titles published by Gollancz in 2016, the delay in reprinting both titles is likely a publisher oversight.


=== Hardcover editions (2010–2017) ===

=== Unpublished softcover editions ===
The following editions were announced, but appear to have been withdrawn:
== &quot;Best of the Masterworks&quot; ==

=== Softcover (2022–23) ===

<text>The Sobig Worm was a computer worm that infected millions of Internet-connected, Microsoft Windows computers in August 2003.

Although there were indications that tests of the worm were carried out as early as August 2002, Sobig.A was first found in the wild in January 2003. Sobig.B was released on May 18, 2003. It was first called &quot;Palyh&quot;, but was later renamed to Sobig.B after anti-virus experts discovered it was a new generation of Sobig. Sobig.C was released May 31 and fixed the timing bug in Sobig.B. Sobig.D came a couple of weeks later followed by Sobig.E on June 25. On August 19, Sobig.F became known and set a record in sheer volume of e-mails.

The worm was most widespread in its &quot;Sobig.F&quot; variant.

, Sobig is the second fastest computer worm to have ever entered the wild, being surpassed only by Mydoom.

Sobig was not only a computer worm in the sense that it replicates by itself, but also a Trojan horse in that it masquerades as something other than malware. The Sobig.F worm would appear as an electronic mail with one of the following subjects:

* Re: Approved
* Re: Details
* Re: Re: My details
* Re: Thank you!
* Re: That movie
* Re: Wicked screensaver
* Re: Your application
* Thank you!
* Your details

It would contain the text: &quot;See the attached file for details&quot; or &quot;Please see the attached file for details&quot;, as well as an attachment as one of the following names:

* application.pif
* details.pif
* document_9446.pif
* document_all.pif
* movie0045.pif
* thank_you.pif
* your_details.pif
* your_document.pif
* wicked_scr.scr

==Technical details==

The Sobig viruses infected a host computer by way of the above-mentioned attachment. When this is started they will replicate by using their own SMTP agent engine. E-mail addresses that will be targeted by the virus are gathered from files on the host computer. The file extensions that will be searched for e-mail addresses are:

* .dbx
* .eml
* .hlp
* .htm
* .html
* .mht
* .wab
* .txt

The Sobig.F variant was programmed to contact 20 IP addresses on UDP port 8998 on August 26, 2003 to install some program or update itself. It is unclear what this program was, but earlier versions of the virus had installed the WinGate proxy server software—a legitimate product—in a configuration allowing it to be used as a backdoor for spammers to distribute unsolicited e-mail.

The Sobig worm was written using the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler, and subsequently compressed using a data compression program called tElock.

The Sobig.F worm deactivated itself on September 10, 2003. On November 5 the same year, Microsoft announced that they will pay $250,000 for information leading to the arrest of the creator of the Sobig worm. Ruslan Ibragimov is attributed to be the original creator of the worm, however this is not confirmed.

<doc id="313677" wikidata="Q1141023" url="?curid=313677" title="Shugo">
<text>, commonly translated as &#x27;[military] governor&#x27;, &#x27;protector&#x27;, or &#x27;constable&#x27;, was a title given to certain officials in feudal Japan. They were each appointed by the shogun to oversee one or more of the provinces of Japan. The position gave way to the emergence of the daimyo (military feudal lords) in the late 15th century, as &quot;shugo&quot; began to claim power over lands themselves, rather than serving simply as governors on behalf of the shogunate.

== History ==
The post is said to have been created in 1185 by shogun Minamoto no Yoritomo to aid the capture of Yoshitsune, with the additional motivation of extending the rule of the Minamoto shogunate government throughout Japan. The &quot;shugo&quot; (military governors) progressively supplanted the existing &quot;kokushi&quot; (civil governors), who were appointed by the Imperial Court in Kyoto. Officially, the &quot;gokenin&quot; in each province were supposed to serve the &quot;shugo&quot;, but in practice, the relationship between them was fragile, as the gokenin were vassals of the &quot;shōgun&quot; as well.

&quot;Shugo&quot; often stayed for long periods in the capital, far from their province, and were sometimes appointed &quot;shugo&quot; for several provinces at the same time. In such cases, a deputy &quot;shugo&quot;, or &quot;shugodai&quot; (守護代), was appointed.

Over time, the powers of some &quot;shugo&quot; grew considerably. Around the time of the Ōnin War (1467–1477), conflicts between &quot;shugo&quot; became common. Some &quot;shugo&quot; lost their powers to subordinates such as the &quot;shugodai&quot;, while others strengthened their grip on their territories. As a result, at the end of the 15th century, the beginning of the Sengoku period, the power in the country was divided amongst military lords of various kinds (&quot;shugo&quot;, &quot;shugodai&quot;, and others), who came to be called &quot;daimyōs&quot;.

== Famous &quot;shugo&quot; and &quot;daimyō&quot; clans of the Muromachi period ==
Below is a list of some of the major clans that produced &quot;shugos&quot; and &quot;daimyōs&quot; during the Muromachi era and Sengoku period, as well as the regions over which they ruled.
* Hosokawa clan – Izumi, Settsu, Tanba, Bitchū, Awaji, Awa, Sanuki, Iyo, and Tosa provinces
* Takeda clan – Kai Province, Aki province, Wakasa Province
* Ōtomo clan – Bungo Province, Buzen Province
* Toki clan – Mino Province

<doc id="313685" wikidata="Q2063546" url="?curid=313685" title="Statue of Freedom">
<text>The Statue of Freedom, also known as Armed Freedom or simply Freedom, is a bronze statue designed by Thomas Crawford that, since 1863, has crowned the United States Capitol dome. Originally named Freedom Triumphant in War and Peace, a U.S. government publication now states that the statue &quot;is officially known as the &quot;Statue of Freedom&quot;.&quot; The statue depicts a female figure bearing a military helmet and holding a sheathed sword in her right hand and a laurel wreath and shield in her left.

==Description==
The &quot;Statue of Freedom&quot; is a colossal bronze figure standing tall and weighing approximately 15,000 pounds (6,800 kg). Her crest peaks at 288 feet (88 m) above the east front plaza of the U.S. Capitol. She is an allegorical figure whose right hand holds the hilt of a sheathed sword, while a laurel wreath of victory and the Shield of the United States are clasped in her left hand. Her chiton is secured by a brooch inscribed &quot;U.S.&quot; and is partially covered by a heavy, Native American–style fringed blanket thrown over her left shoulder. She faces east toward the main entrance of the building and the rising Sun. She wears a military helmet adorned with stars and an eagle&#x27;s head which is itself crowned by an umbrella-like crest of feathers. Although not actually called , she shares many of her iconic characteristics. &quot;Freedom&quot; stands atop a cast-iron globe encircled with one of the national mottoes, &quot;E pluribus unum&quot;. The lower part of the base is decorated with fasces and wreaths. Ten spikes are attached to her headdress, shoulders and shield to deter birds from roosting. The statue conducts lightning to its base where it is grounded by thick copper wire connected to a spike in the earth as a safe high current pathway for lightning strikes.

==History==

===Design===
A monumental statue for the top of the national Capitol appeared in architect Thomas U. Walter&#x27;s original drawing for the new cast-iron dome, which was authorized in 1855. Walter&#x27;s drawing showed the outline of a statue representing the Goddess of Liberty; Crawford proposed instead an allegorical figure of &quot;Freedom Triumphant in War and Peace&quot;. In doing so, Crawford invoked the goddesses Minerva, Bellona, or Athena.

Crawford was commissioned to design &quot;Freedom&quot; in 1854 and executed the plaster model for the statue in his studio in Rome, Italy. U.S. Senator and U.S. Secretary of War Jefferson Davis (who would later become President of the Confederacy) was in charge of the Capitol construction and its decorations. According to David Hackett Fischer in his book &quot;Liberty and Freedom&quot;, Crawford&#x27;s statue was... Davis sent his aide, Captain Montgomery Meigs, with orders to remove the cap, saying that &quot;its history renders it inappropriate to a people who were born free and would not be enslaved&quot;. A military helmet, with an American eagle head and crest of feathers, replaced the cap in the sculpture&#x27;s final version. (Today many casual observers take the statue, with its eagle and feathers, to be a Native American.)

===Execution===
Crawford died in 1857 before the full-size plaster model left his studio. The model, packed into six crates, was shipped from Italy in a small sailing vessel in the spring of 1858. During the voyage, the ship began to leak and stopped in Gibraltar for repairs. After leaving Gibraltar, the ship began leaking again to the point that it could go no farther than Bermuda, where the model was stored until other transportation could be arranged. Half of the crates finally arrived in New York City in December, but all sections were not in Washington, D.C., until late March 1859.

Beginning in 1860, the statue was cast in five main sections by Clark Mills, whose bronze foundry was located on the outskirts of Washington. Work was halted in 1861 because of the Civil War, but by the end of 1862, the statue was finished and temporarily displayed on the Capitol grounds. The cost of the statue, exclusive of installation, was $23,796.82.

While &quot;Freedom&quot; was being cast at Mills&#x27; foundry, the foreman in charge of the casting went on strike. Instead of paying him the higher wages he demanded, Mills turned the project over to Philip Reid, one of the slaves working at the facility. Reid presided over the rest of the casting and assembly of the figure. Late in 1863, construction of the dome was sufficiently advanced for the installation of the statue, which was hoisted by former slaves (freed by the Compensated Emancipation Act in 1862) in sections and assembled atop the cast-iron pedestal. The final section, the figure&#x27;s head and shoulders, was raised on December 2, 1863, to a salute of 35 guns answered by the guns of the 12 forts around Washington, D.C.

===Restoration===
On May 9, 1993, after being in place almost 130 years, the statue was brought down from its pedestal by helicopter for restoration, giving tourists a rare chance to see the statue up close. The work was needed because of extensive pitting and corrosion on the surface of the bronze and because of a crack and rusting on the cast-iron pedestal. The United States Capitol Preservation Commission provided the $780,000 in privately raised funds. The work was performed by New Arts Foundry of Baltimore, Maryland.

The cast-iron pedestal was restored in place atop the dome. The metal was stripped of paint, and the wreaths and fasces were removed to ensure that they were thoroughly cleaned and coated. The crack was permanently repaired, and the entire pedestal was primed and painted with a color specially mixed to match the statue.
Restoration of the statue and the pedestal was completed in approximately four months. The &quot;Statue of Freedom&quot; was returned to its pedestal by helicopter on October 23, 1993, amid the celebration of the of the U.S. Capitol. Since then, every 2–3 years, the statue undergoes two weeks of cleaning and recoating as necessary.

The plaster model of the statue, in storage for 25 years, was reassembled and restored in the basement rotunda of the Russell Senate Office Building, where it was returned to permanent public display in January 1993. The plaster model was relocated to the Emancipation Hall of the Capitol Visitor Center, which provides more visitors access to look at the statue&#x27;s details.

==Use of &quot;Freedom&quot;&#x27;s image==

The well-known &quot;Statue of Freedom&quot; has appeared on several official designs, akin to the Statue of Liberty. The head of the statue is depicted on a postage stamp (1923, USA Scott No. 573), which was re-issued in 2006. The entire statue is depicted on a stamp commemorating the 150th anniversary of Washington, D.C. (1950, USA Scott No. 989).

Two 1989 United States Congress Bicentennial commemorative coins feature the Statue, the half-dollar and the silver dollar.

It can also be found on the obverse of the Medal of Freedom (1945) and the reverse of the Iraq Campaign Medal, awarded to members of the U.S. military deployed to Iraq during the Iraq War. The Secretary of Defense Medal for the Global War on Terrorism also depicts the statue on the obverse of the medal.

<text>The Highlander Research and Education Center, formerly known as the Highlander Folk School, is a social justice leadership training school and cultural center in New Market, Tennessee. Founded in 1932 by activist Myles Horton, educator Don West, and Methodist minister James A. Dombrowski, it was originally located in the community of Summerfield in Grundy County, Tennessee, between Monteagle and Tracy City. It was featured in the 1937 short film, &quot;People of the Cumberland&quot;, and the 1985 documentary film, &quot;You Got to Move&quot;. Much of the history was documented in the book &quot;Or We&#x27;ll All Hang Separately: The Highlander Idea&quot; by Thomas Bledsoe.

Highlander provides training and education for emerging and existing movement leaders throughout the South, Appalachia, and the world. Some of Highlander&#x27;s earliest contributions were during the labor movement in Appalachia and throughout the Southern United States. During the 1950s, it played a critical role in the American Civil Rights Movement. It trained civil rights leader Rosa Parks prior to her historic role in the Montgomery bus boycott, as well as providing training for many other movement activists, including members of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), Septima Clark, Anne Braden, Martin Luther King Jr., James Bevel, Hollis Watkins, Bernard Lafayette, Ralph Abernathy and John Lewis in the mid- and-late 1950s. Backlash against the school&#x27;s involvement with the Civil Rights Movement led to the school&#x27;s closure by the state of Tennessee in 1961. 

Staff reorganized and moved to Knoxville, Tennessee, where they rechartered Highlander under the name &quot;Highlander Research and Education Center.&quot; Highlander has been in its current (and longest consecutive) home in New Market, Tennessee, since 1971. Highlander&#x27;s archives reside at the Wisconsin Historical Society and the Louis Round Wilson Library at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

==History==

===Early years===
The Highlander Folk School was originally established in Grundy County, Tennessee, on land donated for this purpose by educator Lilian Wyckoff Johnson. When Highlander was founded in 1932, the United States was in the midst of the Great Depression. Workers in all parts of the country were met with major resistance by employers when they tried to organize labor unions, especially in the South. Against that backdrop, Horton, West and Dombrowski created the Highlander School &quot;to provide an educational center in the South for the training of rural and industrial leaders, and for the conservation and enrichment of the indigenous cultural values of the mountains.&quot; Horton was influenced by observing rural adult education schools in Denmark started in the 19th century by Danish Lutheran Bishop N. F. S. Grundtvig. During the 1930s and 1940s, the school&#x27;s main focus was labor education and the training of labor organizers. In the 1930s, Myra Page taught here.

===Civil rights===
In the 1950s, Highlander turned its energies to the rising issues of civil rights and desegregation. In addition to Myles Horton, Zilphia Horton, and others, a key figure during this period was John Beauchamp Thompson, a minister and educator who became one of the principal fund-raisers and speakers for the school. Highlander worked with Esau Jenkins of Johns Island to develop a literacy program for Blacks who were prevented from registering to vote by literacy requirements. The Citizenship Education Schools coordinated by Septima Clark with assistance from Bernice Robinson spread widely throughout the South and helped thousands of Blacks register to vote. Later, the program was transferred to the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), led by Martin Luther King Jr., because the state of Tennessee was threatening to close the school.

Civil rights activists, most notably King, Bevel, Bernard Lafayette, Rosa Parks, John Lewis, and Julian Bond, came to the Center at different times. Lewis revealed later that he had his first meal in an integrated setting at Highlander. &quot;I was a young adult, but I had never eaten a meal in the company of Black and white diners,&quot; the congressman wrote. He continued, &quot;Highlander was the place that Rosa Parks witnessed a demonstration of equality that helped inspire her to keep her seat on a Montgomery bus, just a few weeks after her first visit. She saw Septima Clark, a legendary black educator, teaching side-by-side with (Highlander founder Myles) Horton. For her it was revolutionary. She had never seen an integrated team of equals working together, and it inspired her.&quot;

The civil rights anthem, &quot;We Shall Overcome&quot;, was adapted from a gospel song, by Highlander music director Zilphia Horton, wife of Myles Horton, from the singing of striking tobacco factory workers from the 1945–1946 Charleston Cigar Factory strike. Shortly afterward, it was published by folksinger Pete Seeger in the People&#x27;s Songs bulletin. It was revived at Highlander by Guy Carawan, who succeeded Zilphia Horton as Highlander&#x27;s music director in 1959. Guy Carawan taught the song to SNCC at their first convening at Shaw University. The song has since spread and become one of the most recognizable movement songs in the world.

===Backlash===
Highlander has been the target of violence and suppression many times since being founded as the Highlander Folk School in Monteagle, Tennessee, in 1932.

In reaction to the school&#x27;s work, during the late 1950s, Southern newspapers said that Highlander was creating racial strife. In 1957, the Georgia Commission on Education published a pamphlet titled &quot;Highlander Folk School: Communist Training School, Monteagle, Tennessee&quot;. A controversial photograph of Martin Luther King Jr. with writer, trade union organizer, civil rights activist and co-founder of the Highlander School Donald Lee West, was published. According to information obtained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, West was the District Director of the Communist Party in North Carolina, though West denied he had ever been a member of the Communist Party. In 1961, the state of Tennessee revoked Highlander&#x27;s charter, and confiscated and auctioned the school&#x27;s land and property. According to Septima Clark&#x27;s autobiography, the Highlander Folk School was closed because it engaged in commercial activities in violation its charter. The Highlander Folk School was chartered by the State of Tennessee as a non-profit corporation without stockholders or owners. Once the State revoked its charter, no one could make a legal claim on any of the property. In 1961, the Highlander staff reincorporated as the Highlander Research and Education Center and moved to Knoxville. In 1971, it relocated to New Market, Tennessee.

===Appalachian issues===
In the 1960s and 1970s, Highlander focused on worker health and safety in the coalfields of Appalachia. Its leaders, including its former president Mike Clark, played a role in the emergence of the region&#x27;s environmental justice movement. It helped start the Southern Appalachian Leadership Training (SALT) program, and coordinated a survey of land ownership in Appalachia. In the 1980s and 1990s, Highlander broadened their base into broader regional, national, and international environmentalism; struggles against the negative effects of globalization; grassroots leadership development in under-resourced communities. Beginning in the 1990s, became involved in LGBT issues, both in the U.S. and internationally. Youth-focused organizing is another aspect of Highlander&#x27;s work.

=== Community-based and participatory research ===
Highlander programming oftentimes incorporates community-led or participatory research projects. This approach can be traced back to Myles Horton and other founding figures in their mission to encourage communities to trust in and learn from their own experiences. In the 1970s, Highlander staff began to plan and facilitate participatory projects surrounding topics that are often complex for non-expert audiences such as environmental risk and corporate land ownership. This work has continued through collaborations that prioritize building relationships and networks so that people with shared stakes can find themselves in conversation with one another.

=== Popular education ===
In line with its stated mission of &quot;supporting [peoples&#x27;] efforts to take collective action to shape their own destiny,&quot; many Highlander projects incorporate popular education strategies. Popular education, which draws on the experiences and knowledges of a group of people, is often linked to participatory research initiatives. Highlander uses popular education tactics to develop shared leadership and to emphasize the expertise of lived experiences.

==Since 2000==
Current focuses of Highlander include issues of democratic participation and economic justice, with a particular focus on youth, immigrants to the U.S. from Latin America, African Americans, LGBT, and poor white people. Highlander&#x27;s work with immigrants focuses on uplifting immigrant and refugee leaders at local, state, and national levels. Their work with immigrant rights focuses on highlighting intersectionality with other social movements and increasing the presence of the US South in the movement.

In 2014, the Tennessee Preservation Trust placed the original Grundy County school building on its list of the ten most &quot;endangered&quot; historic sites in Tennessee.

On March 29, 2019, a fire destroyed a building that housed executive offices at the Highlander Center. Nobody was inside the building, but many items were lost, including decades of historic documents, speeches, artifacts, and memorabilia. White supremacist graffiti, in the form of the Iron Guard symbol, was found at the site, and the county and state are both investigating whether arson was committed.

<doc id="313690" wikidata="Q1302273" url="?curid=313690" title="WinGate">
<text>WinGate is an integrated multi-protocol proxy server, email server and internet gateway from Qbik New Zealand Limited in Auckland. It was first released in October 1995, and began as a re-write of SocketSet, a product that had been previously released in prototype form by Adrien de Croy.

WinGate proved popular, and by the mid- to late 1990s, WinGate was used in homes and small businesses that needed to share a single Internet connection between multiple networked computers. The introduction of Internet Connection Sharing in Windows 98, combined with increasing availability of cheap NAT-enabled routers, forced WinGate to evolve to provide more than just internet connection sharing features. Today, focus for WinGate is primarily access control, email server, caching, reporting, bandwidth management and content filtering.

WinGate comes in three versions, Standard, Professional and Enterprise. The Enterprise edition also provides an easily configured virtual private network system, which is also available separately as WinGate VPN. Licensing is based on the number of concurrently connected users, and a range of license sizes are available. Multiple licenses can also be aggregated.

The current version of WinGate is version 9.4.5, released in October 2022.

==Notoriety==
Versions of WinGate prior to 2.1d (1997) shipped with an insecure default configuration that - if not secured by the network administrator - allowed untrusted third parties to proxy network traffic through the WinGate server. This made open WinGate servers common targets of crackers looking for anonymous redirectors through which to attack other systems. While WinGate was by no means the only exploited proxy server, its wide popularity amongst users with little experience administering networks made it almost synonymous with open SOCKS proxies in the late 1990s. Furthermore, since a restricted (two users) version of the product was freely available without registration, contacting all WinGate users to notify of security issues was impossible, and therefore even long after the security problems were resolved there were still many insecure installations in use.

Some versions of the Sobig worm installed an unlicensed copy of WinGate 5 in a deliberately insecure configuration to be used by spammers. These installations used non-standard ports for SOCKS and WinGate remote control and so in general did not interfere with other software running on the infected host computer. This resulted in some antivirus software incorrectly identifying WinGate as malware and removing it.

<doc id="313693" wikidata="Q6545196" url="?curid=313693" title="Life in the United Kingdom test">
<text>The Life in the United Kingdom test is a computer-based test constituting one of the requirements for anyone seeking Indefinite Leave to Remain in the UK or naturalisation as a British citizen. It is meant to prove that the applicant has a sufficient knowledge of British life. The test is a requirement under the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. It consists of 24 questions covering topics such as British values, history, traditions and everyday life. The test has been frequently criticised for containing factual errors, expecting candidates to know information that would not be expected of native-born citizens as well as being just a &quot;bad pub quiz&quot; and &quot;unfit for purpose&quot;.

== Purpose ==

A pass in the test fulfils the requirements for &quot;sufficient knowledge of life in the United Kingdom&quot; which were introduced for naturalisation on 1 November 2005 and which were introduced for settlement on 2 April 2007.

Initially, attending the &quot;ESOL (English for Speakers of Other Languages) with Citizenship&quot; course was an alternative to passing the Life in the UK Test, but since 2013 applicants are required to both meet the knowledge of the language and pass the test to fulfil the requirements. Meeting the knowledge of English can be satisfied by having an English qualification at B1, B2, C1 or C2 level, or by completing a degree which is taught or researched in English. Legally, sufficient knowledge of Welsh or Scottish Gaelic can also be used to fulfil the language requirement, but the mechanism by which this can be achieved is not clear in legislation. 

Conversely, Home Office guidance states that if anyone wishes to take the Life in the UK Test in these languages (for instance Gaelic‐speaking Canadians or Welsh‐speaking Argentinians), arrangements will be made for them to do so. One test each in Scottish Gaelic and in Welsh have been taken as of 2020.

Plans to introduce such a test were announced in September 2002 by the then Home Secretary, David Blunkett. He appointed a &quot;Life in the United Kingdom Advisory Group&quot;, chaired by Sir Bernard Crick, to formulate the test&#x27;s content. In 2003, the Group produced a report, &quot;The New and the Old&quot;, with recommendations for the design and administration of the test. There was dissent among the committee members on certain issues, and many of the recommendations were not adopted by the Government. In 2005, plans to require foreign-born religious ministers to take the test earlier than other immigrants were abandoned by the then Immigration Minister, Tony McNulty.

== Content ==
The test lasts for 45 minutes, during which time the candidate is required to answer 24 multiple-choice questions. To pass the test, the candidate must receive a grade of 75% or higher, i.e. at least 18 correct answers to the 24 questions. Testing is not directly administered by UK Visas and Immigration (which replaced the UK Border Agency in 2013), but is carried out by Learndirect, a private company. As of 20 July 2021 the cost of the test is £50.

From November 2005 to March 2007, the questions for the test were based on chapters 2 to 4 of the book &quot;Life in the United Kingdom: A Journey to Citizenship&quot;. The handbook was revised in March 2007 and the test was changed to be based on chapters 2 to 6 of it. The additional chapters covered knowledge and understanding of employment matters and everyday needs such as housing, money, health and education. The third edition of the handbook, &quot;Life in the United Kingdom: A Guide for New Residents&quot;, was released in 2013 and prompted another change in the test format. The test covered the chapters &quot;The Values and principles of the UK&quot;, &quot;What is the UK?&quot;, &quot;A long and illustrious history&quot;, &quot;A modern, thriving society&quot; and &quot;The UK government, the law and your role&quot;.

At the time of the test&#x27;s introduction the materials were primarily about England, but the second edition of the handbook contained more detail about aspects of life in the United Kingdom which differ in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. Applicants taking the test receive a version tailored to where they live; for example, candidates in Scotland will be asked about the Scottish Parliament, but not about the Senedd.

== Pass rate ==

Of the 906,464 tests taken between 2005 and 2009, 263,641 were failed (a pass rate of 70.9%). The results of candidates from countries with a strong tradition of immigration to the UK were variable. The pass rates for people from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States were all above 95%. In contrast, the pass rates for people from Iraq, Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Turkey were below 50%. The largest single country of origin was India, with just over 100,000 tests taken and 79,229 passed (79.2%). Furthermore, data available from the 2nd quarter of 2010 to the 3rd quarter of 2014 indicates that of the 748,613 Life in the UK tests taken during this period 185,863 were failed, which means a pass rate of 75.17%. These results initially look comparable to those from previous years. However, the percentage pass rates for the previous version of the test had been rising steadily until the introduction of the new version of the test in March 2013. With the introduction of testing on the new study material from March 2013 pass rates fell to an average of 70%. Analysis of pass rates available for the first 11 months of the new test (from April 2013 to February 2014) show significant variances in pass rate by nationality of origin of those taking the test. For example: Laos 33%, Afghanistan 40%, Syria 67%, Nigeria 69%, India 74%, Canada 95%. The pass rate for those EU citizens taking the test in this period averaged 86% (Austria 71%, Belgium 75%, Bulgaria 84%, Croatia 92%, Cyprus 83%, Czech Republic 93%, Denmark 95%, Estonia 87%, Finland 86%, France 87%, Germany 91%, Greece 91%, Hungary 90%, Ireland 95%, Italy 92%, Latvia 80%, Lithuania 81%, Luxembourg 100%, Malta 100%, Netherlands 81%, Poland 87%, Portugal 80%, Romania 79%, Slovakia 88%, Slovenia 100%, Spain 89%, Sweden 86%).

Upon completion of the test, candidates are not informed of their exact marks. Successful candidates are informed that they have passed and will be given a Pass Notification Letter that they will have to sign, while unsuccessful candidates learn the topics that they should study further. The test may be taken an unlimited number of times until a candidate achieves a pass. Since its inception, there have been numerous instances of fraud and cheating on the test.

== Criticism ==

Prior to its launch, the test produced considerable speculation in the British media about possible questions.

Upon its publication, the associated handbook was widely criticised. Particular criticism was reserved for the section on the UK&#x27;s history, which was described by the &quot;Guardian&quot; as a &quot;turgid, abysmal piece of writing,&quot; filled with &quot;factual errors, sweeping generalisations [and] gross misrepresentations.&quot; The UK Border Agency acknowledged that the first edition of the handbook &quot;did not fulfil [its] role particularly well.&quot;

In 2008, Lord Goldsmith stated in a report on citizenship that the test &quot;is not seen typically as a stimulus for learning, though that was one of its stated aims.&quot;

In 2011, the government announced its intention to include questions on the UK&#x27;s history and remove questions on the EU from the test.

In 2012, an article in the &quot;New Statesman&quot; described the test as mocking Britishness since there was no general agreement amongst the population on what was or was not relevant to culture and history. Every member of the &quot;New Statesman&quot; editorial team asked by the author to complete the test failed.

In 2013, Thom Brooks&#x27; report &quot;The Life in the United Kingdom Citizenship Test: Is It Unfit for Purpose?&quot; argued that there were serious problems with the test, finding it to be impractical, inconsistent, containing too much trivia and having a gender imbalance.

===Minority languages===
The lack of provision for citizenship services in the Irish language has been met with criticism from the Committee of Experts of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, which the UK has ratified for the Cornish language, the Irish language, Manx Gaelic, the Scots &amp; Ulster Scots dialects, Scottish Gaelic and the Welsh language. In a 2014 report detailing the application of the Charter in the UK, the Committee stated that they were given no justification for the inequality in the treatment of Irish speakers in contrast to that of English, Scottish Gaelic and Welsh speakers, and that efforts to rectify the inequality were non-existent.

<text>The Bristol Channel (, literal translation: &quot;Severn Sea&quot;) is a major inlet in the island of Great Britain, separating South Wales (from Pembrokeshire to the Vale of Glamorgan) and South West England (from Devon, Somerset to North Somerset). It extends from the smaller Severn Estuary of the River Severn () to the North Atlantic Ocean. It takes its name from the English city and port of Bristol.

Long stretches of both sides of the coastline are designated as Heritage Coast. These include Exmoor, Bideford Bay, the Hartland Point peninsula, Lundy Island, Glamorgan, Gower Peninsula, Carmarthenshire, South Pembrokeshire and Caldey Island.

Until Tudor times the Bristol Channel was known as the Severn Sea, and it is still known as this in both and .

==Geography==
The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) defines the offshore western limit of the Bristol Channel as &quot;a line joining Hartland Point in Devon () to St. Govan&#x27;s Head in Pembrokeshire ()&quot;. Western and northern Pembrokeshire, north Cornwall and that part of Devon west of Hartland Point are outside the IHO defined limits of the Bristol Channel, and are considered part of the seaboard of the Atlantic Ocean, specifically the Celtic Sea. Lundy lies on the boundary between the Bristol Channel and the Atlantic. In common usage, the distinction between the Bristol Channel and Celtic Sea is less clearly defined, with the name Bristol Channel sometimes applied to areas of the Celtic Sea.

Upstream, the distinction between the Bristol Channel and Severn Estuary is more ambiguous, with no official boundary between them. Some sources consider the Bristol Channel to encompass the estuary, or draw no distinction between them. The Severn Estuary Partnership encompasses an area upstream of Hurlstone Point and Nash Point, while the Living Levels Partnership draw the line between Lavernock Point and Sand Point, marked by Steep Holm and Flat Holm islands. Lavernock Point is also used as the boundary between Marine Character Areas 28 and 29, named Bristol Channel and Severn Estuary. In common usage, the term Bristol Channel is often applied to areas upstream of these lines.
The Bristol Channel–Severn Estuary system extends eastward inland to the limit of tidal influence, at Gloucester Docks. The channel shoreline alternates between resistant and erosional cliff features, interspersed with depositional beaches backed by coastal sand dunes; in the Severn Estuary, a low-lying shoreline is fronted by extensive intertidal mudflats. The Severn Estuary and most of the embayments around the channel are less than deep. Within the channel, however, there is an east–west valley deep, which is thought to have been formed by fluvial run-off during Pleistocene phases of lower sea level. Along the margins of the Bristol Channel are extensive linear tidal sandbanks, which are dredged for aggregates. In the outer Bristol Channel, off the Welsh coast, are the OBel Sands, an extensive area of sand waves up to high, covering more than ).

==Ecology==

The Bristol Channel is an important area for wildlife, in particular waders, and has protected areas, including national nature reserves such as Bridgwater Bay at the mouth of the River Parrett. At low tide large parts of the channel become mud flats due to the tidal range of , frequently stated to be second only to the Bay of Fundy in Eastern Canada but smaller than those at Ungava Bay, also in Canada. Development schemes have been proposed along the channel, including an airport and a tidal barrier for electricity generation, but conservation issues have so far managed to block such schemes.

The largest islands in the Bristol Channel are Lundy, Steep Holm and Flat Holm, which are mostly uninhabited and protected as nature reserves, and are home to some unique wild flower species. In 1971 a proposal was made by the Lundy Field Society to establish a marine reserve. Provision for the establishment of statutory Marine Nature Reserves was included in the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, and on 21 November 1986 the Secretary of State for the Environment announced the designation of a statutory reserve at Lundy. There is an outstanding variety of marine habitats and wildlife, and a large number of rare and unusual species in the waters around Lundy, including some species of seaweed, branching sponges, sea fans and cup corals.

The Bristol Channel has some extensive and popular beaches and spectacular scenery, particularly on the coasts of Exmoor and Bideford Bay in North Devon and the Vale of Glamorgan and Gower Peninsula on the Glamorgan coast. The western stretch of Exmoor boasts Hangman cliffs, the highest cliffs in mainland Britain, culminating near Combe Martin in the &quot;Great Hangman&quot;, a 1,043 ft (318 m) &#x27;hog-backed&#x27; hill with a cliff-face of 820 ft (250 m); its sister cliff the &quot;Little Hangman&quot; has a cliff-face of 716 ft (218 m). On the Gower Peninsula, at its western extremity is the Worms Head, a headland of Carboniferous Limestone which is approachable on foot at low tide only. The beaches of Gower (at Rhossili, for example) and North Devon, such as Croyde and Woolacombe, win awards for their water quality and setting, as well as being renowned for surfing. In 2004, &quot;The Times&quot; &quot;Travel&quot; magazine selected Barafundle Bay in Pembrokeshire as one of the twelve best beaches in the world. In 2007, Oxwich Bay made the same magazine&#x27;s Top 12 best beaches in the world list, and was also selected as Britain&#x27;s best beach for 2007.

==Coastal cities and towns==
The city of Swansea is the largest settlement on the Welsh coast of the Bristol Channel. Other major built-up areas include Barry (including Barry Island), Port Talbot and Llanelli. Smaller resort towns include Porthcawl, Mumbles, Saundersfoot and Tenby. The cities of Cardiff and Newport adjoin the Severn estuary.

On the English side, the resort towns of Weston-super-Mare, Burnham-on-Sea, Watchet, Minehead and Ilfracombe are located on the Bristol Channel. Barnstaple and Bideford are sited on estuaries opening onto Bideford Bay, at the westernmost end of the Bristol Channel. Within the Severn Estuary, are Clevedon, Portishead and the city of Bristol. The Port of Bristol, originally established inland on the River Avon in the centre of the city, but now with larger commercial deep water docks on the Severn Estuary, is one of the busiest ports in Britain.

==Navigation==
There are no road or rail crossings of the Bristol Channel so direct crossings are necessarily made by sea or air, or less directly by the road and rail crossings of the Severn estuary. The Channel can be a hazardous area of water because of its strong tides and the rarity of havens on the north Devon and Somerset coasts that can be entered in all states of the tide. Because of the treacherous waters, pilotage is an essential service for shipping. A specialised style of sailing boat, the Bristol Channel Pilot Cutter, developed in the area.

===Paddle steamers===
P &amp; A Campbell, based in Bristol, was the main operator of pleasure craft, particularly paddle steamers, from the mid-19th century to the late 1970s, together with the Barry Railway Company. These served harbours along both coasts, such as Ilfracombe and Weston-super-Mare.

This tradition is continued each summer by the &quot;PS Waverley&quot;, the last seagoing paddle steamer in the world, built in 1947. The steamer provides pleasure trips between the Welsh and English coasts and to the islands of the channel. Trips are also offered on the , also owned by Waverley Excursions.

===Marine rescue services===
The Burnham-on-Sea Area Rescue Boat (BARB) uses a hovercraft to rescue people from the treacherous mud flats on that part of the coast. A hovercraft was recently tested to determine the feasibility of setting up a similar rescue service in Weston-super-Mare. There are also RNLI lifeboats stationed along both sides of the Channel. In the Severn Estuary, in-shore rescue is provided by two independent lifeboat trusts, the Severn Area Rescue Association (SARA) and the Portishead and Bristol Lifeboat Trust.

==Renewable energy==

The Bristol Channel and Severn Estuary have the potential to generate more renewable electricity than any other in the UK. It has been stated that it would contribute significantly to UK climate change goals and European Union renewable energy targets. Earlier studies of a possible Severn Barrage included estimates of bed load transport of sand and gravel by tidal ebb and flood that would be interrupted if a solid dam were built across the Channel. More recently, the Severn Tidal Power Feasibility Study was launched in 2008 by the British Government to assess all tidal range technologies, including barrages, lagoons and others. The study will look at the costs, benefits and impacts of a Severn tidal power scheme and will help Government decide whether it could or could not support such a scheme. Some of the options being looked at may include a road crossing downstream of the existing crossings of the estuary.

==1607 flood==

On 30 January 1607 thousands of people were drowned, houses and villages swept away, farmland inundated and flocks destroyed when a flood hit the shores of the Channel. The devastation was particularly bad on the Welsh side, from Laugharne in Carmarthenshire to above Chepstow on the English border. Cardiff was the most badly affected town. There remain plaques up to 8 ft (2.4 m) above sea level to show how high the waters rose on the sides of the surviving churches. It was commemorated in a contemporary pamphlet &quot;&quot;God&#x27;s warning to the people of England by the great overflowing of the waters or floods&quot;.&quot;

The cause of the flood is uncertain and disputed. It had long been believed that the floods were caused by a combination of meteorological extremes and tidal peaks, but research published in 2002 showed some evidence of a tsunami in the Channel. Although some evidence from the time describes events similar to a tsunami, there are also similarities to descriptions of the 1953 floods in East Anglia, which were caused by a storm surge. It has been shown that the tide and weather at the time were capable of generating such a surge.

==Religion==
In 1835 John Ashley was on the shore at Clevedon with his son who asked him how the people on Flat Holm could go to church. For the next three months Ashley voluntarily ministered to the population of the island. From there he recognised the needs of the seafarers on the four hundred sailing vessels in the Bristol Channel and created the Bristol Channel Mission. He raised funds and in 1839 a specially designed mission cutter was built with a main cabin which could be converted into a chapel for 100 people; this later became first initiative of the Mission to Seafarers.

==Recreation==

===Surfing===
Much of the coastline at the western end of the Bristol Channel faces west towards the Atlantic Ocean meaning that a combination of an off-shore (east) wind and a generous Atlantic swell produces excellent surf along the beaches. The heritage coasts of the Vale of Glamorgan, Bideford Bay and Gower are, along with the Atlantic coasts of Pembrokeshire and Cornwall, the key areas for surfing in the whole of Britain. Although slightly overshadowed by the Atlantic coasts of North Cornwall and West Pembrokeshire, both Gower and Bideford Bay nevertheless have several superb breaks—notably Croyde in Bideford Bay and Langland Bay on Gower—and surfing in Gower and Bideford Bay is enhanced by the golden beaches, clean blue waters, excellent water quality and good facilities close by to the main surf breaks.

===Windsurfing across the channel===
The first known crossing of the Bristol Channel (from Swansea to Woody Bay, near Lynton, Devon) by a windsurfer was Adam Cowles in April 2006, apparently accidentally. Other windsurfers have reported making the crossing as a training exercise (Hugh Sim Williams) or as part of a windsurf around Britain (e.g. Jono Dunnett). The coastguard has stated that windsurf crossings of the channel are dangerous and should not be attempted without appropriate preparations.

===Walking===
The high quality of the landscape of much of both coasts of the Bristol Channel means that they are popular destinations for walkers. Sections of two national trails; the South West Coast Path and the Pembrokeshire Coast Path follow these shores, and the West Somerset Coast Path extends eastwards from the South West Coast Path to the mouth of the River Parrett. A continuous coastal path, the Wales Coast Path, was opened in May 2012 along the entire Welsh shore under the auspices of the Countryside Council for Wales.

===Swimming records===

====First person to swim across the Bristol Channel====
The first person to swim across the Bristol Channel was Kathleen Thomas, a 21-year-old woman from Penarth who swam to Weston-super-Mare on 5 September 1927. She completed the swim, nominally 11 miles but equivalent to 22 miles because of tidal flows, in 7 hours 20 minutes. In 2007 the achievement was marked by a plaque on the seafront at Penarth. There is also a plaque at Anchor Head in Weston-super-Mare.

====Youngest person to swim across the Bristol Channel====
In 1929, Edith Parnell, a 16-year-old schoolgirl, emulated Kathleen Thomas&#x27;s swim from Penarth to Weston-super-Mare in 10 hours 15 minutes. Edith later became the first wife of Hugh Cudlipp the Welsh journalist and newspaper editor.

====Ilfracombe to Swansea====
The first person to swim the from Ilfracombe to Swansea was Gethin Jones, who achieved the record on 13 September 2009, taking nearly 22 hours.

====Penarth to Clevedon====
The youngest person to swim from Penarth to Clevedon is Gary Carpenter, who in August 2007 at the age of 17, completed the crossing in 5 hours 35 minutes. He held the record for the fastest swim across the Bristol Channel until 2020. Carpenter&#x27;s coach, Steve Price, was the first person to swim from Penarth to Clevedon, in 1990.
In 2020 Joanne Jones swam from Penarth to Clevedon in a time of 5 hours, 27 minutes. Joanne was the first woman to swim this route, and holds the current record for fastest time.

<doc id="313701" wikidata="Q131112" url="?curid=313701" title="Paul Krugman">
<text>Paul Robin Krugman ( ; born February 28, 1953) is an American New Keynesian economist who is the Distinguished Professor of Economics at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. He was a columnist for &quot;The New York Times&quot; from 2000 to 2024. In 2008, Krugman was the sole winner of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for his contributions to new trade theory and new economic geography. The Prize Committee cited Krugman&#x27;s work explaining the patterns of international trade and the geographic distribution of economic activity, by examining the effects of economies of scale and of consumer preferences for diverse goods and services.

Krugman was previously a professor of economics at MIT, and, later, at Princeton University which he retired from in June 2015, holding the title of professor emeritus there ever since. He also holds the title of Centennial Professor at the London School of Economics. Krugman was President of the Eastern Economic Association in 2010, and is among the most influential economists in the world. He is known in academia for his work on international economics (including trade theory and international finance), economic geography, liquidity traps, and currency crises.

Krugman is the author or editor of 27 books, including scholarly works, textbooks, and books for a more general audience, and has published over 200 scholarly articles in professional journals and edited volumes. He has also written several hundred columns on economic and political issues for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Fortune&quot; and &quot;Slate&quot;. A 2011 survey of economics professors named him their favorite living economist under the age of 60. According to the Open Syllabus Project, Krugman is the second most frequently cited author on college syllabi for economics courses. As a commentator, Krugman has written on a wide range of economic issues including income distribution, taxation, macroeconomics, and international economics. Krugman considers himself a modern liberal, referring to his books, his blog on &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and his 2007 book &quot;The Conscience of a Liberal&quot;. His popular commentary has attracted widespread praise and criticism.

On December 6, 2024, &quot;New York Times&quot; opinion editor Kathleen Kingsbury announced that Krugman was retiring as a &quot;Times&quot; columnist; His final column was published on December 9. Afterwards, Krugman began publishing a daily newsletter. Krugman wrote there that he left the &quot;Times&quot; because his editors began to discourage him from writing columns that might &quot;get some people (particularly on the right) riled up.&quot;

==Early life and education==

Krugman was born to a Ukrainian Jewish family, the son of Anita and David Krugman. In 1914, his maternal grandparents immigrated to the United States from Ukraine, while in 1920, his paternal grandparents arrived from Belarus. He was born in Albany, New York, spent several years of his childhood in the upstate city of Utica, before growing up from age eight in Merrick, a hamlet in Nassau County, Long Island. He graduated from John F. Kennedy High School in Bellmore. According to Krugman, his interest in economics began with Isaac Asimov&#x27;s &quot;Foundation&quot; novels, in which the social scientists of the future use a new science of &quot;psychohistory&quot; to try to save civilization. Since present-day science fell far short of &quot;psychohistory&quot;, Krugman turned to economics as the next best thing.

In 1974, Krugman earned his BA&quot; summa cum laude&quot; in economics from Yale University, where he was a National Merit Scholar. He then went on to pursue a PhD in economics from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). In 1977, he successfully completed his PhD in three years, with a thesis titled &quot;Essays on flexible exchange rates.&quot; While at MIT, he was part of a small group of MIT students sent to work for the Central Bank of Portugal for three months in the summer of 1976, during the chaotic aftermath of the Carnation Revolution.

Krugman later praised his PhD thesis advisor, Rudi Dornbusch, as &quot;one of the great economics teachers of all time&quot; and said that he &quot;had the knack of inspiring students to pick up his enthusiasm and technique, but find their own paths&quot;. In 1978, Krugman presented a number of ideas to Dornbusch, who flagged as interesting the idea of a monopolistically competitive trade model. Encouraged, Krugman worked on it and later wrote, &quot;[I] knew within a few hours that I had the key to my whole career in hand&quot;. In that same year, Krugman wrote &quot;The Theory of Interstellar Trade&quot;, a tongue-in-cheek essay on computing interest rates on goods in transit near the speed of light. He says he wrote it to cheer himself up when he was &quot;an oppressed assistant professor&quot;.

== Academic career ==
Krugman became an assistant professor at Yale University in September 1977. He joined the faculty at MIT in 1979. From 1982 to 1983, Krugman spent a year working at the Reagan White House as a staff member of the Council of Economic Advisers. He rejoined MIT as a full professor in 1984. Krugman has also taught at Stanford and the London School of Economics.

In 2000, Krugman joined Princeton University as Professor of Economics and International Affairs. He is also currently Centenary Professor at the London School of Economics, and a member of the Group of Thirty international economic body. He has been a research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research since 1979. Krugman was President of the Eastern Economic Association in 2010. In February 2014, he announced that he would be retiring from Princeton in June 2015 and that he would be joining the faculty at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York.

Paul Krugman has written extensively on international economics, including international trade, economic geography, and international finance. The Research Papers in Economics project ranks him among the world&#x27;s most influential economists. Krugman&#x27;s &quot;International Economics: Theory and Policy&quot;, co-authored with Maurice Obstfeld, is a standard undergraduate textbook on international economics. He is also co-author, with Robin Wells, of an undergraduate economics text which he says was strongly inspired by the first edition of Paul Samuelson&#x27;s classic textbook. Krugman also writes on economic topics for the general public, sometimes on international economic topics but also on income distribution and public policy.

The Nobel Prize Committee stated that Krugman&#x27;s main contribution is his analysis of the effects of economies of scale, combined with the assumption that consumers appreciate diversity, on international trade and on the location of economic activity. The importance of spatial issues in economics has been enhanced by Krugman&#x27;s ability to popularize this complicated theory with the help of easy-to-read books and state-of-the-art syntheses. &quot;Krugman was beyond doubt the key player in &#x27;placing geographical analysis squarely in the economic mainstream&#x27; ... and in conferring it the central role it now assumes.&quot;

=== New trade theory ===

Prior to Krugman&#x27;s work, trade theory (see David Ricardo and Heckscher–Ohlin model) emphasized trade based on the comparative advantage of countries with very different characteristics, such as a country with a high agricultural productivity trading agricultural products for industrial products from a country with a high industrial productivity. However, in the 20th century, an ever-larger share of trade occurred between countries with similar characteristics, which is difficult to explain by comparative advantage. Krugman&#x27;s explanation of trade between similar countries was proposed in a 1979 paper in the &quot;Journal of International Economics&quot;, and involves two key assumptions: that consumers prefer a diverse choice of brands, and that production favors economies of scale. Consumers&#x27; preference for diversity explains the survival of different versions of cars like Volvo and BMW. However, because of economies of scale, it is not profitable to spread the production of Volvos all over the world; instead, it is concentrated in a few factories and therefore in a few countries (or maybe just one).

Krugman modeled a &#x27;preference for diversity&#x27; by assuming a CES utility function like that in a 1977 paper by Avinash Dixit and Joseph Stiglitz. Many models of international trade now follow Krugman&#x27;s lead, incorporating economies of scale in production and a preference for diversity in consumption. This way of modeling trade has come to be called New Trade Theory.

Krugman&#x27;s theory also took into account transportation costs, a key feature in producing the &quot;home market effect&quot;, which would later feature in his work on the new economic geography. The home market effect &quot;states that, ceteris paribus, the country with the larger demand for a good shall, at equilibrium, produce a more than proportionate share of that good and be a net exporter of it&quot;. The home market effect was an unexpected result, and Krugman initially questioned it, but ultimately concluded that the mathematics of the model were correct.

When there are economies of scale in production, it is possible that countries may become &#x27;locked into&#x27; disadvantageous patterns of trade. Krugman points out that although globalization has been positive on a whole, since the 1980s the process known as hyper-globalization has at least played a part in rising inequality. Nonetheless, trade remains beneficial in general, even between similar countries, because it permits firms to save on costs by producing at a larger, more efficient scale, and because it increases the range of brands available and sharpens the competition between firms. Krugman has usually been supportive of free trade and globalization. He has also been critical of industrial policy, which New Trade Theory suggests might offer nations rent-seeking advantages if &quot;strategic industries&quot; can be identified, saying it&#x27;s not clear that such identification can be done accurately enough to matter.

=== New economic geography ===
It took an interval of eleven years, but ultimately Krugman&#x27;s work on New Trade Theory (NTT) converged to what is usually called the &quot;new economic geography&quot; (NEG), which Krugman began to develop in a seminal 1991 paper, &quot;Increasing Returns and Economic Geography&quot;, published in the &quot;Journal of Political Economy&quot;. In Krugman&#x27;s own words, the passage from NTT to NEG was &quot;obvious in retrospect; but it certainly took me a while to see it. ... The only good news was that nobody else picked up that $100 bill lying on the sidewalk in the interim.&quot; This would become Krugman&#x27;s most-cited academic paper: by early 2009, it had 857 citations, more than double his second-ranked paper. Krugman called the paper &quot;the love of my life in academic work&quot;.

The &quot;home market effect&quot; that Krugman discovered in NTT also features in NEG, which interprets agglomeration &quot;as the outcome of the interaction of increasing returns, trade costs and factor price differences&quot;. If trade is largely shaped by economies of scale, as Krugman&#x27;s trade theory argues, then those economic regions with most production will be more profitable and will therefore attract even more production. That is, NTT implies that instead of spreading out evenly around the world, production will tend to concentrate in a few countries, regions, or cities, which will become densely populated but will also have higher levels of income.

=== Agglomeration and economies of scale ===
Manufacturing is characterized by increasing returns to scale and less restrictive and expansive land qualifications as compared to agricultural uses. So, geographically where can manufacturing be predicted to develop? Krugman states that manufacturing&#x27;s geographical range is inherently limited by economies of scale, but also that manufacturing will establish and accrue itself in an area of high demand. Production that occurs adjacent to demand will result in lower transportation costs, but demand, as a result, will be greater due to concentrated nearby production. These forces act upon one another simultaneously, producing manufacturing and population agglomeration. Population will increase in these areas due to the more highly developed infrastructure and nearby production, therefore lowering the expense of goods, while economies of scale provide varied choices of goods and services. These forces will feed into each other until the greater portion of the urban population and manufacturing hubs are concentrated into a relatively insular geographic area.

=== International finance ===
Krugman has also been influential in the field of international finance. As a graduate student, Krugman visited the Federal Reserve Board where Stephen Salant and Dale Henderson were completing their discussion paper on speculative attacks in the gold market. Krugman adapted their model for the foreign exchange market, resulting in a 1979 paper on currency crises in the &quot;Journal of Money, Credit, and Banking&quot;, which showed that misaligned fixed exchange rate regimes are unlikely to end smoothly but instead end in a sudden speculative attack. Krugman&#x27;s paper is considered one of the main contributions to the &#x27;first generation&#x27; of currency crisis models, and it is his second-most-cited paper (457 citations as of early 2009).

In response to the 2008 financial crisis, Krugman proposed, in an informal &quot;mimeo&quot; style of publication, an &quot;international finance multiplier&quot;, to help explain the unexpected speed with which the global crisis had occurred. He argued that when, &quot;highly leveraged financial institutions [HLIs], which do a lot of cross-border investment [. ... ] lose heavily in one market ... they find themselves undercapitalized, and have to sell off assets across the board. This drives down prices, putting pressure on the balance sheets of other HLIs, and so on.&quot; Such a rapid contagion had hitherto been considered unlikely because of &quot;decoupling&quot; in a globalized economy. He first announced that he was working on such a model on his blog, on October 5, 2008. Within days of its appearance, it was being discussed on some popular economics-oriented blogs.
The note was soon being cited in papers (draft and published) by other economists, even though it had not itself been through ordinary peer review processes.

=== Macroeconomics and fiscal policy ===

Krugman has done much to revive discussion of the liquidity trap as a topic in economics. He recommended pursuing aggressive fiscal policy and unconventional monetary policy to counter Japan&#x27;s lost decade in the 1990s, arguing that the country was mired in a Keynesian liquidity trap. The debate he started at that time over liquidity traps and what policies best address them continues in the economics literature.

Krugman had argued in &quot;The Return of Depression Economics&quot; that Japan was in a liquidity trap in the late 1990s, since the central bank could not drop interest rates any lower to escape economic stagnation. The core of Krugman&#x27;s policy proposal for addressing Japan&#x27;s liquidity trap was inflation targeting, which, he argued &quot;most nearly approaches the usual goal of modern stabilization policy, which is to provide adequate demand in a clean, unobtrusive way that does not distort the allocation of resources&quot;. The proposal appeared first in a web posting on his academic site. This mimeo-draft was soon cited, but was also misread by some as repeating his earlier advice that Japan&#x27;s best hope was in &quot;turning on the printing presses&quot;, as recommended by Milton Friedman, John Makin, and others.

Krugman has since drawn parallels between Japan&#x27;s &#x27;lost decade&#x27; and the late 2000s recession, arguing that expansionary fiscal policy is necessary as the major industrialized economies are mired in a liquidity trap. In response to economists who point out that the Japanese economy recovered despite not pursuing his policy prescriptions, Krugman maintains that it was an export-led boom that pulled Japan out of its economic slump in the late-90s, rather than reforms of the financial system.

Krugman was one of the most prominent advocates of the 2008–2009 Keynesian resurgence, so much so that economics commentator Noah Smith referred to it as the &quot;Krugman insurgency&quot;.
His view that most peer-reviewed macroeconomic research since the mid-1960s is wrong, preferring simpler models developed in the 1930s, has been criticized by some modern economists, like John H. Cochrane. In June 2012, Krugman and Richard Layard launched &quot;A manifesto for economic sense&quot;, where they call for greater use of fiscal stimulus policy to reduce unemployment and foster growth. The manifesto received over four thousand signatures within two days of its launch, and has attracted both positive and critical responses.

=== Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences ===
Krugman was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences (informally the Nobel Prize in Economics), the sole recipient for 2008. This prize includes an award of about $1.4 million and was given to Krugman for his work associated with New Trade Theory and the New Economic Geography. In the words of the prize committee, &quot;By having integrated economies of scale into explicit general equilibrium models, Paul Krugman has deepened our understanding of the determinants of trade and the location of economic activity.&quot;

A May 2011 Hamilton College analysis of 26 politicians, journalists, and media commentators who made predictions in major newspaper columns or television news shows from September 2007 to December 2008 found that Krugman was the most accurate. Only nine of the prognosticators predicted more accurately than chance, two were significantly less accurate, and the remaining 14 were no better or worse than a coin flip. Krugman was correct in 15 out of 17 predictions, compared to 9 out of 11 for the next most accurate media figure, Maureen Dowd.

Krugman was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2011.

&quot;Foreign Policy&quot; named Krugman one of its 2012 FP Top 100 Global Thinkers &quot;for wielding his acid pen against austerity&quot;.

== Author ==

In the 1990s, besides academic books and textbooks, Krugman increasingly began writing books for a general audience on issues he considered important for public policy. In &quot;The Age of Diminished Expectations&quot; (1990), he wrote in particular about the increasing US income inequality in the &quot;New Economy&quot; of the 1990s. He attributes the rise in income inequality in part to changes in technology, but principally to a change in political atmosphere which he attributes to Movement Conservatives.

In September 2003, Krugman published a collection of his columns under the title, &quot;The Great Unraveling&quot;, about the Bush administration&#x27;s economic and foreign policies and the US economy in the early 2000s. His columns argued that the large deficits during that time were generated by the Bush administration as a result of decreasing taxes on the rich, increasing public spending, and fighting the Iraq War. Krugman wrote that these policies were unsustainable in the long run and would eventually generate a major economic crisis. The book was a best-seller.

In 2007, Krugman published &quot;The Conscience of a Liberal&quot;, whose title refers to Barry Goldwater&#x27;s &quot;Conscience of a Conservative&quot;. It details the history of wealth and income gaps in the United States in the 20th century. The book describes how the gap between rich and poor declined greatly during the middle of the century, and then widened in the last two decades to levels higher even than in the 1920s. In &quot;Conscience&quot;, Krugman argues that government policies played a much greater role than commonly thought both in reducing inequality in the 1930s through 1970s and in increasing it in the 1980s through the present, and criticizes the Bush administration for implementing policies that Krugman believes widened the gap between the rich and poor.

Krugman also argued that Republicans owed their electoral successes to their ability to exploit the race issue to win political dominance of the South. Krugman argues that Ronald Reagan had used the &quot;Southern Strategy&quot; to signal sympathy for racism without saying anything overtly racist, citing as an example Reagan&#x27;s coining of the term &quot;welfare queen&quot;.

In his book, Krugman proposed a &quot;new New Deal&quot;, which included placing more emphasis on social and medical programs and less on national defense. In his review of &quot;Conscience of a Liberal&quot;, the liberal journalist and author Michael Tomasky credited Krugman with a commitment &quot;to accurate history even when some fudging might be in order for the sake of political expediency&quot;. In a review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Pulitzer Prize-winning historian David M. Kennedy stated: &quot;Krugman&#x27;s chapter on the imperative need for health care reform is the best in this book, a rueful reminder of the kind of skilled and accessible economic analysis of which he is capable&quot;.

In late 2008, Krugman published a substantial updating of an earlier work, entitled &quot;The Return of Depression Economics and the Crisis of 2008&quot;. In the book, he discusses the failure of the United States regulatory system to keep pace with a financial system increasingly out-of-control, and the causes of and possible ways to contain the greatest financial crisis since the 1930s. In 2012, Krugman published &quot;End This Depression Now!&quot;, a book which argues that looking at the available historical economic data, fiscal cuts and austerity measures only deprive the economy of valuable funds that can circulate and further add to a poor economy – people cannot spend, and markets cannot thrive if there is not enough consumption and there cannot be sufficient consumption if there is large unemployment. He argues that while it is necessary to cut debt, it is the worst time to do so in an economy that has just suffered the most severe of financial shocks, and must be done instead when an economy is near full-employment when the private sector can withstand the burden of decreased government spending and austerity. Failure to stimulate the economy either by public or private sectors will only unnecessarily lengthen the current economic depression and make it worse.

== Commentator ==
Martin Wolf has written that Krugman is both the &quot;most hated and most admired columnist in the US&quot;.
Economist J. Peter Neary has noted that Krugman &quot;has written on a wide range of topics, always combining one of the best prose styles in the profession with an ability to construct elegant, insightful and useful models&quot;. Neary added that &quot;no discussion of his work could fail to mention his transition from Academic Superstar to Public Intellectual. Through his extensive writings, including a regular column for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, monographs and textbooks at every level, and books on economics and current affairs for the general public ... he has probably done more than any other writer to explain economic principles to a wide audience.&quot; Krugman has been described as the most controversial economist in his generation and according to Michael Tomasky since 1992 he has moved &quot;from being a center-left scholar to being a liberal polemicist&quot;.

From the mid-1990s onwards, Krugman wrote for &quot;Fortune&quot; (1997–99) and &quot;Slate&quot; (1996–99), and then for &quot;The Harvard Business Review&quot;, &quot;Foreign Policy&quot;, &quot;The Economist&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;, and &quot;Washington Monthly&quot;. In this period Krugman critiqued various positions commonly taken on economic issues from across the political spectrum, from protectionism and opposition to the World Trade Organization on the left to supply-side economics on the right.

During the 1992 presidential campaign, Krugman praised Bill Clinton&#x27;s economic plan in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and Clinton&#x27;s campaign used some of Krugman&#x27;s work on income inequality. At the time, it was considered likely that Clinton would offer him a position in the new administration, but allegedly Krugman&#x27;s volatility and outspokenness caused Clinton to look elsewhere. Krugman later said that he was &quot;temperamentally unsuited for that kind of role. You have to be very good at people skills, biting your tongue when people say silly things.&quot; In a Fresh Dialogues interview, Krugman added, &quot;you have to be reasonably organized ... I can move into a pristine office and within three days it will look like a grenade went off.&quot;

In 1999, near the height of the dot com boom, &quot;The New York Times&quot; approached Krugman to write a bi-weekly column on &quot;the vagaries of business and economics in an age of prosperity&quot;. His first columns in 2000 addressed business and economic issues, but as the 2000 US presidential campaign progressed, Krugman increasingly focused on George W. Bush&#x27;s policy proposals. According to Krugman, this was partly due to &quot;the silence of the media – those &#x27;liberal media&#x27; conservatives complain about ...&quot; Krugman accused Bush of repeatedly misrepresenting his proposals, and criticized the proposals themselves. After Bush&#x27;s election, and his perseverance with his proposed tax cut in the midst of the slump (which Krugman argued would do little to help the economy but substantially raise the fiscal deficit), Krugman&#x27;s columns grew angrier and more focused on the administration. As Alan Blinder put it in 2002, &quot;There&#x27;s been a kind of missionary quality to his writing since then ... He&#x27;s trying to stop something now, using the power of the pen.&quot; Partly as a result, Krugman&#x27;s twice-weekly column on the Op-Ed page of &quot;The New York Times&quot; has made him, according to Nicholas Confessore, &quot;the most important political columnist in America ... he is almost alone in analyzing the most important story in politics in recent years – the seamless melding of corporate, class, and political party interests at which the Bush administration excels.&quot; In an interview in late 2009, Krugman said his missionary zeal had changed in the post-Bush era and he described the Obama administration as &quot;good guys but not as forceful as I&#x27;d like ... When I argue with them in my column this is a serious discussion. We really are in effect speaking across the transom here.&quot; Krugman says he&#x27;s more effective at driving change outside the administration than inside it, &quot;now, I&#x27;m trying to make this progressive moment in American history a success. So that&#x27;s where I&#x27;m pushing.&quot;

Krugman&#x27;s columns have drawn criticism as well as praise. A 2003 article in &quot;The Economist&quot; questioned Krugman&#x27;s &quot;growing tendency to attribute all the world&#x27;s ills to George Bush&quot;, citing critics who felt that &quot;his relentless partisanship is getting in the way of his argument&quot; and claiming errors of economic and political reasoning in his columns. Daniel Okrent, a former &quot;The New York Times&quot; ombudsman, in his farewell column, criticized Krugman for what he said was &quot;the disturbing habit of shaping, slicing and selectively citing numbers in a fashion that pleases his acolytes but leaves him open to substantive assaults&quot;.

Krugman&#x27;s &quot;New York Times&quot; blog was &quot;The Conscience of a Liberal&quot;, devoted largely to economics and politics.

Five days after 9/11 terrorist attacks, Krugman argued in his column that the calamity was &quot;partly self-inflicted&quot;, citing poor pay and training for airport security driven by the transfer of responsibility for airport security from government to airlines. His column provoked an angry response and &quot;The New York Times&quot; was flooded with complaints. According to Larissa MacFarquhar of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, while some people thought that he was too partisan to be a columnist for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, he was revered on the left. Similarly, on the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 on the United States Krugman again provoked a controversy by accusing on his &quot;New York Times&quot; blog former U.S. President George W. Bush and former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani of rushing &quot;to cash in on the horror&quot; after the attacks and describing the anniversary as &quot;an occasion for shame&quot;.

Krugman was noteworthy for his opposition to the 2016 presidential campaign of Bernie Sanders. On January 19, 2016, he wrote an article which criticized Bernie Sanders for his perceived lack of political realism, compared Sanders&#x27; plans for healthcare and financial reform unfavorably to those of Hillary Clinton, and cited criticisms of Sanders from other liberal policy wonks like Mike Konczal and Ezra Klein. Later, Krugman wrote an article which accused Sanders of &quot;[going] for easy slogans over hard thinking&quot; and attacking Hillary Clinton in a way that was &quot;just plain dishonest&quot;.

On the 12 July 2016, Krugman tweeted &quot;leprechaun economics&quot;, in response to Central Statistics Office (Ireland) data that 2015 GDP grew 26.3% and 2015 GNP grew 18.7%. The leprechaun economics affair (proved in 2018 to be Apple restructuring its double Irish subsidiaries), led to the Central Bank of Ireland introducing a new economic statistic, Modified gross national income (or GNI*) to better measure the Irish economy (2016 Irish GDP is 143% of 2016 Irish GNI*). The term leprechaun economics has since been used by Krugman, and others, to describe distorted/unsound economic data.

Krugman&#x27;s use of the term leprechaun to refer to Ireland and its people has raised rebuke. In June 2021, Krugman wrote an article titled, &quot;Yellen&#x27;s New Alliance Against Leprechauns&quot;. Following the article, the Irish Ambassador to the US, Daniel Mulhall, wrote a letter to his publisher saying, &quot;This is not the first time your columnist has used the word &#x27;leprechaun&#x27; when referring to Ireland, and I see it as my duty to point out that this represents an unacceptable slur.&quot;

Krugman harshly criticized the Trump administration. He has also remarked several times on how Trump tempts him to assume the worst, such that he has to be careful to check his personal beliefs against the weight of evidence.

In January 2025, speaking on his departure from &quot;The New York Times&quot; the previous month, Krugman said that he found the back-and-forth with his editor had become intrusive and tiresome. He cited &quot;toning down [his] voice&quot; and &quot;pressure for what I considered false equivalence&quot; as complaints, as well as a desire to publish him less often by removing his newsletter. The &quot;Columbia Journalism Review&quot; reported that he refused an offer to reduce his regular columns from twice to once a week in exchange for keeping his newsletter.

=== East Asian growth ===
In a 1994 &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; article, Paul Krugman argued that it was a myth that the economic successes of the East Asian &#x27;tigers&#x27; constituted an economic miracle. He argued that their rise was fueled by mobilizing resources and that their growth rates would inevitably slow. His article helped popularize the argument made by Lawrence Lau and Alwyn Young, among others, that the growth of economies in East Asia was not the result of new and original economic models, but rather from high capital investment and increasing labor force participation, and that total factor productivity had not increased. Krugman argued that in the long term, only increasing total factor productivity can lead to sustained economic growth. Krugman&#x27;s article was highly criticized in many Asian countries when it first appeared, and subsequent studies disputed some of Krugman&#x27;s conclusions. However, it also stimulated a great deal of research, and may have caused the Singapore government to provide incentives for technological progress.

During the 1997 Asian financial crisis, Krugman advocated currency controls as a way to mitigate the crisis. Writing in a &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine article, he suggested exchange controls as &quot;a solution so unfashionable, so stigmatized, that hardly anyone has dared suggest it&quot;. Malaysia was the only country that adopted such controls, and although the Malaysian government credited its rapid economic recovery on currency controls, the relationship is disputed. An empirical study found that the Malaysian policies produced faster economic recovery and smaller declines in employment and real wages. Krugman later stated that the controls might not have been necessary at the time they were applied, but that nevertheless &quot;Malaysia has proved a point – namely, that controlling capital in a crisis is at least feasible.&quot; Krugman more recently pointed out that emergency capital controls have even been endorsed by the IMF, and are no longer considered radical policy.

=== U.S. economic policies ===
In the early 2000s, Krugman repeatedly criticized the Bush tax cuts, both before and after they were enacted. Krugman argued that the tax cuts enlarged the budget deficit without improving the economy, and that they enriched the wealthy – worsening income distribution in the US. Krugman advocated lower interest rates (to promote investment and spending on housing and other durable goods), and increased government spending on infrastructure, military, and unemployment benefits, arguing that these policies would have a larger stimulus effect, and unlike permanent tax cuts, would only temporarily increase the budget deficit. In addition, he was against Bush&#x27;s proposal to privatize social security.

In August 2005, after Alan Greenspan expressed concern over housing markets, Krugman criticized Greenspan&#x27;s earlier reluctance to regulate the mortgage and related financial markets, arguing that &quot;[he&#x27;s] like a man who suggests leaving the barn door ajar, and then – after the horse is gone – delivers a lecture on the importance of keeping your animals properly locked up.&quot; Krugman has repeatedly expressed his view that Greenspan and Phil Gramm are the two individuals most responsible for causing the subprime crisis. Krugman points to Greenspan and Gramm for the key roles they played in keeping derivatives, financial markets, and investment banks unregulated, and to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which repealed Great Depression era safeguards that prevented commercial banks, investment banks and insurance companies from merging.

Krugman also was critical of some of the Obama administration&#x27;s economic policies. He criticized the Obama stimulus plan as being too small and inadequate given the size of the economy and the banking rescue plan as misdirected; Krugman wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;an overwhelming majority [of the American public] believes that the government is spending too much to help large financial institutions. This suggests that the administration&#x27;s money-for-nothing financial policy will eventually deplete its political capital.&quot; In particular, he considered the Obama administration&#x27;s actions to prop up the US financial system in 2009 to be impractical and unduly favorable to Wall Street bankers. In anticipation of President Obama&#x27;s Job Summit in December 2009, Krugman said in a Fresh Dialogues interview, &quot;This jobs summit can&#x27;t be an empty exercise ... he can&#x27;t come out with a proposal for $10 or $20 Billion of stuff because people will view that as a joke. There has to be a significant job proposal ... I have in mind something like $300 Billion.&quot;

Krugman has criticized China&#x27;s exchange rate policy, which he believes to be a significant drag on global economic recovery from the Late-2000s recession, and he has advocated a &quot;surcharge&quot; on Chinese imports to the US in response. Jeremy Warner of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; accused Krugman of advocating a return to self-destructive protectionism.

In April 2010, as the Senate began considering new financial regulations, Krugman argued that the regulations should not only regulate financial innovation, but also tax financial industry profits and remuneration. He cited a paper by Andrei Shleifer and Robert Vishny released the previous week, which concludes that most innovation was in fact about &quot;providing investors with false substitutes for [traditional] assets like bank deposits&quot;, and once investors realize the sheer number of securities that are unsafe a &quot;flight to safety&quot; occurs which necessarily leads to &quot;financial fragility&quot;.

In his June 28, 2010, column in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, in light of the recent G-20 Toronto Summit, Krugman criticized world leaders for agreeing to halve deficits by 2013. Krugman claimed that these efforts could lead the global economy into the early stages of a &quot;third depression&quot; and leave &quot;millions of lives blighted by the absence of jobs&quot;. He advocated instead the continued stimulus of economies to foster greater growth.

In a 2014 review of Thomas Piketty&#x27;s &quot;Capital in the Twenty-First Century&quot; he stated we are in a Second Gilded Age.

== Economic views ==
===Keynesian economics===
Krugman identifies as a Keynesian and a saltwater economist, and he has criticized the freshwater school on macroeconomics. Although he has used New Keynesian theory in his work, he has also criticized it for lacking predictive power and for hewing to ideas like the efficient-market hypothesis and rational expectations. Since the 1990s, he has promoted the practical use of the IS-LM model of the neoclassical synthesis, pointing out its relative simplicity compared to New Keynesian models, and its continued currency in economic policy analysis.

During the Great Recession, he remarked that he is &quot;gravitating towards a Keynes-Fisher-Minsky view of macroeconomics&quot;. Post-Keynesian observers cite commonalities between Krugman&#x27;s views and those of the Post-Keynesian school, although Krugman has been critical of some Post-Keynesian economists such as John Kenneth Galbraith – whose works &quot;The New Industrial State&quot; (1967) and &quot;Economics in Perspective&quot; (1987) Krugman has referred to as not &quot;real economic theory&quot; and &quot;remarkably ill-informed&quot; respectively. In recent academic work, he has collaborated with Gauti Eggertsson on a New Keynesian model of debt-overhang and debt-driven slumps, inspired by the writings of Irving Fisher, Hyman Minsky, and Richard Koo. Their work argues that during a debt-driven slump, the &quot;paradox of toil&quot;, together with the paradox of flexibility, can exacerbate a liquidity trap, reducing demand and employment.

=== Free trade ===
Krugman&#x27;s support for free trade in the 1980s–1990s provoked some ire from the anti-globalization movement. In 1987 he quipped that, &quot;If there were an Economist&#x27;s Creed, it would surely contain the affirmations &#x27;I understand the Principle of Comparative Advantage&#x27; and &#x27;I advocate Free Trade&#x27;.&quot; However, Krugman argues in the same article that, given the findings of New Trade Theory, &quot;[free trade] has shifted from optimum to reasonable rule of thumb ... it can never again be asserted as the policy that economic theory tells us is always right.&quot; In the article, Krugman comes out in favor of free trade given the enormous political costs of actively engaging in strategic trade policy and because there is no clear method for a government to discover which industries will ultimately yield positive returns. He also notes that increasing returns and strategic trade theory do not disprove the underlying truth of comparative advantage. In 1994, Krugman criticized the notion of national competitiveness, particularly comparisons of nations as competing corporations. Krugman noted that a country&#x27;s economic success does not need to come at the expense of a rival nation, as if they were two competing companies selling similar products. Instead, foreign nations typically serve as export markets for a nation&#x27;s goods, as well as suppliers of useful imports. 

In the midst of the 2009 Great Recession, Krugman made a significant departure from his general support for free trade, entertaining the idea of a 25% tariff on Chinese imports as a retaliation for China&#x27;s policy of maintaining a low value for the renminbi, which many saw as hostile currency manipulation, artificially making their exports more competitive.

In 2015, Krugman noted his ambivalence about the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership, as the agreement was not mainly about trade and, &quot;whatever you may say about the benefits of free trade, most of those benefits have already been realized&quot; [by existing agreements].

After the 2016 elections, and Trump&#x27;s moves towards protectionism, he wrote that while protectionism can make economies less efficient and reduce long-term growth, it would not directly cause recessions. He noted that if there is a trade war, imports would decrease as much as exports, so employment should not be strongly impacted, at least in the medium to long run. He believes that the US should not repeat Reagan&#x27;s 1981 policy on taxes and quotas on imported products, as even if it does not produce a recession, protectionism would shock &quot;value chains&quot; and disrupt jobs and communities in the same way as free trade in the past. In addition, other countries would take retaliatory measures against US exports. Krugman recommended against the abandonment of NAFTA, because it could cause economic losses and disruptions to businesses, jobs, and communities.

In the late 2010s, Krugman admitted that the models that scholars used to measure the impact of globalization in the 1990s underestimated the effect on jobs and inequality in developed countries such as the US. He noted that although free trade has harmed some industries, communities, and some workers, it remains a win-win system overall, enriching both parties to the agreement at the national level; a trade war is equivalently negative for the nations involved, even while it may benefit some individuals or industries within each nation.

=== Immigration ===
In 2006, Krugman wrote: &quot;[i]mmigration reduces the wages of domestic workers who compete with immigrants. That&#x27;s just supply and demand: we&#x27;re talking about large increases in the number of low-skill workers relative to other inputs into production, so it&#x27;s inevitable that this means a fall in wages ... the fiscal burden of low-wage immigrants is also pretty clear,&quot; citing an estimate of 0.25% of GDP from the National Research Council. However, in 2024, he reported that “most labor economists now believe that immigrants don’t do much head-to-head competition with native-born workers; they bring different skills and take different jobs. And the past few years, with elevated immigration, have also been an era of exceptional growth in wages for the worst paid.”

=== Green economy ===
Krugman has called for a transition to a green economy. He supported the Green New Deal, asserting &quot;I believe progressives should enthusiastically embrace the G.N.D.&quot;. He said that a &quot;Green New Deal stuff is investment. On that stuff, don&#x27;t worry about paying for it. Debt as an issue is vastly overstated, and a lot of these things pay for themselves. Go ahead and just deficit finance it.&quot; In 2021, he wrote that &quot;we will almost surely have to put a price&quot; on greenhouse gas emissions. He criticized Democratic &quot;moderates&quot; and corporations &quot;torpedoing efforts to avoid a civilization-threatening crisis because you want to hold down your tax bill&quot;.

== Political views ==
Krugman describes himself as liberal and has explained that he views the term &quot;liberal&quot; in the American context to mean &quot;more or less what social democratic means in Europe&quot;. In a 2009 &quot;Newsweek&quot; article, Evan Thomas described Krugman as having &quot;all the credentials of a ranking member of the East coast liberal establishment&quot; but also as someone who is anti-establishment, a &quot;scourge of the Bush administration&quot;, and a critic of the Obama administration. In 1996, &quot;Newsweek&quot; Michael Hirsh remarked, &quot;Say this for Krugman: though an unabashed liberal ... he&#x27;s ideologically colorblind. He savages the supply-siders of the Reagan–Bush era with the same glee as he does the &#x27;strategic traders&#x27; of the Clinton administration.&quot;

Krugman has at times advocated free markets in contexts where they are often viewed as controversial. He has written against rent control and land-use restrictions in favor of market supply and demand, likened the opposition against free trade and globalization to the opposition against evolution via natural selection (1996), opposed farm subsidies, argued that sweatshops are preferable to unemployment, dismissed the case for living wages (1998), and argued against mandates, subsidies, and tax breaks for ethanol (2000). In 2003, he questioned the usefulness of NASA&#x27;s manned space flights given the available technology and their high financial cost compared to their general benefits. Krugman has also criticized U.S. zoning laws and European labor market regulation.

Krugman endorsed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the run-up to the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

=== U.S. race relations ===
Krugman has criticized the Republican Party leadership for what he sees as a strategic (but largely tacit) reliance on racial divisions. In his &quot;Conscience of a Liberal&quot;, he wrote:

=== On working in the Reagan administration ===
Krugman worked for Martin Feldstein when the latter was appointed chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers and chief economic advisor to President Ronald Reagan. He later wrote in an autobiographical essay, &quot;It was, in a way, strange for me to be part of the Reagan Administration. I was then and still am an unabashed defender of the welfare state, which I regard as the most decent social arrangement yet devised.&quot; Krugman found the time &quot;thrilling, then disillusioning&quot;. He did not fit into the Washington political environment and was not tempted to stay on.

=== On Gordon Brown vs. David Cameron ===
According to Krugman, Gordon Brown and his party were unfairly blamed for the 2008 financial crisis. He has also praised the former British prime minister, whom he described as &quot;more impressive than any US politician&quot; after a three-hour conversation with him. Krugman asserted that Brown &quot;defined the character of the worldwide financial rescue effort&quot; and urged British voters not to support the opposition Conservative Party in the 2010 general election, arguing their Party Leader David Cameron &quot;has had little to offer other than to raise the red flag of fiscal panic&quot;.

=== On Donald Trump ===
Krugman has been a vocal critic of Donald Trump and his administration. His criticisms have included the president&#x27;s climate change proposals, economic policy, the Republican tax plan and Trump&#x27;s foreign policy initiatives. Krugman often used his op-ed column in &quot;The New York Times&quot; to set out arguments against the president&#x27;s policies. On election night in 2016, Krugman wrongly predicted in a &quot;New York Times&quot; op-ed that the markets would never recover under Trump and stated &quot;first-pass answer is never&quot; but retracted the call in the same publication three days later. Trump gave him a &#x27;Fake News Award&#x27;. Krugman stated &quot;I get a &#x27;fake news award&#x27; for a bad market call, retracted 3 days later, from 2000-lie man, who still won&#x27;t admit he lost the popular vote. Sad!&quot;

===Foreign policy ===
In his &quot;New York Times&quot; column, Krugman described Russia as a &quot;Potemkin superpower&quot; in reaction to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. He stated that &quot;Russia is even weaker than most people, myself included, seem to have realized&quot;, that the military performance of Russia &quot;has been less effective than advertised&quot; in a stalemate at the beginning of the invasion, and that Russia encountered serious logistical problems. Krugman observed that the country&#x27;s total gross domestic product is only a bit more than half as large as those of countries such as Britain and France, despite Russia&#x27;s greater landmass, total population and natural resource endowment. He also noted that Russia&#x27;s economy was further weakened by international sanctions as a result of the war. He concluded that Russia had &quot;far less real strength than meets the eye.&quot;

Krugman opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq. He wrote in his &quot;New York Times&quot; column: &quot;What we should have learned from the Iraq debacle was that you should always be skeptical and that you should never rely on supposed authority. If you hear that &#x27;everyone&#x27; supports a policy, whether it&#x27;s a war of choice or fiscal austerity, you should ask whether &#x27;everyone&#x27; has been defined to exclude anyone expressing a different opinion.&quot;

In 2012, Krugman praised Peter Beinart’s &quot;The Crisis of Zionism&quot; as a “brave book,” criticizing the policies of Benjamin Netanyahu’s government. In 2024, amidst the Israel–Hamas war, Krugman wrote that Netanyahu’s government was “killing huge numbers of civilians” but expressed skepticism at President Joe Biden’s ability to stop the body count, but did not elaborate, having said in 2012 that “like many liberal American Jews — and most American Jews are still liberal — I basically avoid thinking about where Israel is going.”

== Views on technology ==
In 1998 during the dot-com bubble, Krugman wrote a commentary for &quot;Red Herring&quot; that urged skepticism of optimistic predictions for technology-driven progress. He followed it with several pessimistic predictions of his own, including that &quot;[b]y 2005 or so, it will become clear that the Internet&#x27;s impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine&#x27;s&quot; and that the number of jobs for IT specialists would decelerate and turn down. In a 2013 interview, Krugman stated that the predictions were meant to be &quot;fun and provocative, not to engage in careful forecasting&quot;.

Krugman is a vocal critic of Bitcoin, arguing against its economic soundness since 2011. In 2017, he predicted that Bitcoin is a more obvious bubble than housing and stated that &quot;[t]here&#x27;s been no demonstration yet that it actually is helpful in conducting economic transactions&quot;.

In December 2022 Krugman predicted that, because of generative AI such as ChatGPT, &quot;quite a few knowledge jobs may be eminently replaceable&quot;. He suggested that such technology would likely prove beneficial &quot;in the long run&quot;, but that &quot;in the long run, we are all dead, and even before that, some of us may find ourselves either unemployed or earning far less than we expected&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Krugman has been married twice. His first wife, Robin L. Bergman, is a designer. He is currently married to Robin Wells, an academic economist who received her BA from the University of Chicago and her PhD from the University of California, Berkeley. She, like Krugman, taught at MIT. Together, Krugman and his wife have co-authored several economics textbooks. In early 2007, rumors began circulating that Krugman&#x27;s &quot;son&quot; was working for Hillary Clinton’s campaign. However, Krugman clarified in his op-ed column for the &quot;New York Times&quot; that he and his wife do not have any children.

Krugman currently lives in New York City. Upon retiring from Princeton after fifteen years of teaching in June 2015, he addressed the issue in his column, stating that while he retains the utmost praise and respect for Princeton, he wishes to reside in New York City and hopes to focus more on public policy issues. He subsequently became a professor at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York and a distinguished scholar at the Graduate Center&#x27;s Luxembourg Income Study Center.

Krugman reports that he is a distant relative of conservative journalist David Frum. He has described himself as a &quot;Loner. Ordinarily shy. Shy with individuals.&quot;

<text>Johannes Secundus (also Janus Secundus) (15 November 1510 – 25 September 1536) was a Neo-Latin poet of Dutch nationality.

== Early life and education ==

Born Jan Everaerts in The Hague, his father Nicolaes Everaerts was a well known jurist and friend of Erasmus.

In 1528 his family moved to Mechlin, where Secundus wrote his first book of elegies. In 1532 he went to Bourges with his brother Marius to study law under Alciati. He obtained his &quot;licentia&quot;.

== Career ==

In 1533 he went to join his other brother Grudius at the Spanish court of Charles V. There he spent two years working as secretary to the Archbishop of Toledo. He returned to Mechlin because of illness, and died at Saint-Amand in September 1536 at the age of twenty-four.

== Writings ==

Secundus was a prolific writer, and in his short life he produced several books of elegies on his lovers Julia and Neaera, epigrams, odes, verse epistles and epithalamia, as well as some prose writings (epistles and itineraria).

His most famous work, though, was the &quot;Liber Basiorum&quot; (&quot;Book of Kisses&quot;, first complete edition 1541), a short collection consisting of nineteen poems in various metres, in which the poet explores the theme of the kiss in relation to his Spanish lover, Neaera. The &#x27;Basia&#x27; are really extended imitations of Catullus (in particular poems 5 and 7) and some poems from the Anthologia Graeca; Secundus situates his poetry, stylistically as well as thematically, firmly with the Neo-Catullan tradition. Variations on the central theme include: imagery of natural fertility; the &#x27;arithmetic&#x27; of kissing; kisses as nourishment or cure; kisses that wound or bring death; and the exchange of souls through kissing. Secundus also introduces elements of Neo-Platonism and Petrarchism into his poems.

== Musical settings and influence==
*His poems were later set in Dutch translation as madrigals by Cornelis Tijmensz Padbrué (1631).
*Montaigne considered his &quot;Kisses&quot; the equivalent of Rabelais or &quot;The Decameron&quot; in terms of entertainment value.

<doc id="313709" wikidata="Q1806491" url="?curid=313709" title="Transylvania Colony">
<text>The Transylvania Colony, also referred to as the Transylvania Purchase or the Henderson Purchase, was a short-lived, extra-legal colony founded in early 1775 by North Carolina land speculator Richard Henderson, who formed and controlled the Transylvania Company. Henderson and his investors had reached an agreement to purchase a vast tract of Cherokee lands west of the southern and central Appalachian Mountains through the acceptance of the Treaty of Sycamore Shoals with most leading Cherokee chieftains then controlling these lands. In exchange for the land the tribes received goods worth, according to the estimates of some scholars, about 10,000 British pounds ($1.5 million U.S. in 2016). To further complicate matters, this frontier land was also claimed by the Virginia Colony (particularly following Lord Dunmore&#x27;s War) and a southern portion by Province of North Carolina.

The Transylvania Colony was located in what is now the central and western parts of Kentucky, and a chunk of north central Tennessee. The American pioneer and frontier explorer Daniel Boone was hired by Henderson to establish the Wilderness Road going through the Cumberland Gap and into southeastern Kentucky to facilitate settlement. A governmental compact was concluded by the settlers in May 1775. Most settlement was forestalled by the Revolutionary War, except around established towns. Henderson&#x27;s Transylvania claim in Kentucky was invalidated by the Virginia General Assembly in 1778, and the remaining Tennessee portion was invalidated by North Carolina in 1783. Henderson was compensated with a land grant along the Ohio River in western Kentucky and the current town of Henderson was founded there.

==Background==
The Royal Proclamation of 1763 that ended the French and Indian War declared lands west of the Appalachians as &quot;Indian Territory&quot; forbidden to colonial settlement.
Continued provocations by colonial explorers, traders and trappers necessitated some concessions by the Indians to concede lands for settlement in exchange for peace.
In the 1768 Treaty of Fort Stanwix, the Iroquois ceded their claims on lands south of the Ohio River to the British Empire. Although they claimed sovereignty over much of what is now Kentucky, the Iroquois did not actually reside there, as did their nominal vassal, the Shawnee. In addition, the Cherokee to the south and southeast used much of the area as their historical hunting grounds. Neither of these peoples had been consulted regarding the Stanwix treaty, although a series of borders was worked out with the Cherokee at the Treaty of Hard Labour (1768), the Treaty of Lochaber (1770), and once more in 1771 when they agreed to extend the Lochaber cession into present-day northeast Kentucky. The Shawnee, however, had not conducted a boundary agreement with the colonies since 1758 at the Treaty of Easton, giving them a claim to everything west of the Alleghenies. Consequently, they began to attack frontier settlers moving into the region. This led to Lord Dunmore&#x27;s War, fought in 1774, primarily between the Shawnee and Virginia Colony. The Shawnee lost this brief war and their chief Cornstalk ceded all their claims south of the Ohio River, including Kentucky.

Also, through much of the second half of the 17th century, a state of war had existed between the &quot;northern tribes&quot; (particularly the Iroquois, and the Lenape and Shawnee who were then tributary to them) and the &quot;southern tribes&quot; of the Cherokee and Catawba, the shared hunting grounds of Kentucky remained a contentious neutral zone.

==The Transylvania Company==

On 27 August 1774, Richard Henderson, a judge from North Carolina, organized a land speculation company with a number of other prominent North Carolinians. Originally called Richard Henderson and Company, the company name was first changed to the Louisa Company, and finally to the Transylvania Company on January 6, 1775. The Transylvania Company investors hoped to establish a British proprietary colony by purchasing the Kentucky lands from the Cherokee who had earlier settled much of the south and southeastern Kentucky areas and still claimed hunting rights in the abandoned Shawnee lands.

===Treaty of Sycamore Shoals (a.k.a. Watauga Treaties)===

In March 1775, Richard Henderson and Daniel Boone met with more than 1,200 Cherokee at Sycamore Shoals (present day Elizabethton in northeastern Tennessee). Present were Cherokee leaders such as Attakullakulla and Oconostota. With five grant deeds that constituted the Treaty of Sycamore Shoals, Henderson purchased all the land lying between the Cumberland River, the Cumberland Mountains, and the Kentucky River, and situated south of the Ohio River on March 14, 1775. Some adjacent land to the southeast, in Virginia and North Carolina, was also purchased. The land thus delineated, 20 million acres (81,000 km2), encompassed an area half the size of present-day Kentucky.

Henderson and his partners probably believed that a recent British legal opinion, the Pratt–Yorke opinion, had made such purchases legal. In fact, the Transylvania Company&#x27;s purchase was in violation of both Virginia and North Carolina law, as well as the Royal Proclamation of 1763, which prohibited private purchase of American Indian land and the establishment of any non-Crown sanctioned colony.

The Treaty was disavowed by some of the chiefs. A dissident Cherokee chief, Dragging Canoe, refused to sign, endorse, or obey the Treaty of Sycamore Shoals, declaring that &quot;it is bloody ground, and will be dark and difficult to settle&quot;. It would prove to be prophetic, and subsequently Kentucky came to be referred to by the sardonic phrase, &quot;dark and bloody ground&quot;. Dragging Canoe left the Sycamore Shoals treaty grounds and took those who were loyal to him and his way of thinking into southeastern Tennessee, near present-day Chattanooga. This group came to be called the &quot;Chickamauga&quot; after the nearby creek of the same name. Dragging Canoe and this group went on to become the chief protagonists of the Cherokee-American wars.

==Settlement==

Prior to the signing of the Sycamore Shoals Treaty, Henderson had hired Daniel Boone, an experienced hunter, to travel to the Cherokee towns and to inform them of the upcoming negotiations. Boone had been in southeast Kentucky long before the founding of any Kentucky settlements.
Afterward, Boone was hired to blaze what became known as the Wilderness Road, which went from southwestern Virginia north through the Cumberland Gap and into central Kentucky. During this trail-blazing expedition, Boone and his party suffered several Indian attacks. Along with a party of about thirty workers, Boone cleared a path from the Cumberland Gap to the Kentucky River, where he established Boone&#x27;s Station (today Boonesborough) which was intended to be the capital of Transylvania. Unknown to Boone, Henderson led another expedition following in Boone&#x27;s tracks, widening the path so travellers could bring through wagons. In addition to Boone&#x27;s Station, other settlements, including Harrod&#x27;s Town, Logan&#x27;s Fort (formerly St. Asaph), Lexington and Kenton&#x27;s Station (also called Limestone) were established at this time. Many of these settlers had come to Kentucky on their own initiative, and some of them refused to recognize Transylvania&#x27;s authority.

When Henderson arrived at Boonesborough fewer than a hundred people resided there. This population and a few other settlements in the area constituted the sparse concentration of white settlers in the isolated western wilderness. The settlers recognized their precarious situation. They not only faced significant Indian hostilities, but lacked adequate supplies and shelter. Notwithstanding these circumstances, Henderson urged settlers in the area to hold a constitutional convention.

Henderson&#x27;s plan involved the various settlements scattered across Transylvania sending delegates to Boonesborough, acting in the name of the people they represented and whose consent would justify the convention. Representatives from Harrod&#x27;s Town, Boiling Spring (adjacent to Harrod&#x27;s Town), Logan&#x27;s Fort and Boone&#x27;s Station attended. In May 1775, under the shade of a huge elm tree, a three-day convention met. In addition to passing nine bills dealing with immediate matters of governance, delegates drafted a compact that organized a frame of government, known as the Transylvania Compact. This plan included executive, legislative, and judicial branches.

==Demise==
After concluding the compact, Henderson returned to North Carolina. On behalf of his fellow investors in the land scheme he petitioned the Continental Congress, seeking to make Transylvania a legally recognized colony. Despite those efforts, the Congress declined to act without the consent of Virginia and North Carolina, both of whom claimed jurisdiction over the region in question. In June 1776 the Virginia General Assembly prohibited the Transylvania Land Company from making any demands on settlers in the region. In December 1778, Virginia&#x27;s Assembly finally declared the Transylvania claim void. In compensation, Henderson and his partners received a grant of 200,000 acres (312 square miles) on the Ohio River below the mouth of Green River. An early settlement there was named Red Banks, and became the city of Henderson in 1797.

Henderson pressed on with his remaining modest claim in Tennessee, and it was finally invalidated by North Carolina in 1783. Henderson was similarly compensated there with a land grant of 200,000 acres in Powell Valley.

In 2020, the Portage Lake District Library received the June B. Mendel Award for Excellence in Rural Library Service from the Library of Michigan. The bi-annual award honored Library staff for the development of non-traditional library programs for the community.

Adams and Elm River Townships had been part of the library district until 1997 when they voted to sever their relationship with it.

The original location was built in 1909, at the site originally occupied by the Armory Building for Company G of the Houghton Light Infantry, using a $15,000 grant from Andrew Carnegie. In 2006 the Portage Lake District Library moved to a new building on the Houghton Waterfront. The former library building became the Carnegie Museum.

In November 2018, the Portage Lake District Library assumed operations of the Hancock public library located at Hancock High School.

<doc id="313714" wikidata="Q57909" url="?curid=313714" title="Joseph Ferdinand of Bavaria">
<text>Joseph Ferdinand Leopold of Bavaria (28 October 1692 – 6 February 1699) was the son of Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria (1679–1705, 1714–1726) and his first wife, Maria Antonia of Austria, daughter of Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor, maternal granddaughter of King Philip IV of Spain.

==Youth==
 Prince Joseph Ferdinand was born in Vienna on October 28, 1692, son of Duke Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria, and Archduchess Maria Antonia, daughter of Emperor Leopold I. He was a great-nephew of Charles II of Spain.

His mother died soon after his birth. He was then left in the charge of his grandfather, Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I, as his father was in Brussels, where he served as governor of the Spanish Netherlands from March 1692. On May 2, 1693, Joseph Ferdinand, accompanied by the former household of his mother, left Vienna for Munich, where he arrived on 2 or 3 June.

==Heir of Charles II==
Charles II of Spain suffered from ill health for most of his life and seemed likely to die childless. Because the Spanish Empire remained powerful and largely intact, the succession was of great significance to the European balance of power and a matter of debate for many years. As the only surviving descendant of Margaret Theresa and a great-grandson of Philip IV, Joseph Ferdinand&#x27;s claim was sound and widely recognized in Spain. Furthermore, being neither a Habsburg nor a Bourbon, his candidacy appealed to England and the Dutch Republic due to its alignment with the emerging balance of power doctrine in Europe.

Charles II&#x27;s mother, Mariana of Austria, recognized Joseph Ferdinand as rightful heir to the Spanish crown and firmly advocated for his claim. This put her at odds with her younger brother Leopold I and daughter-in-law Mariana of Neuburg: both wanted Leopold&#x27;s son, the Archduke Charles, to succeed Charles II. In an attempt to limit his grandson&#x27;s succession rights and strengthen the claim of his son, Emperor Leopold I had forced his daughter, Maria Antonia (the Electoral Prince&#x27;s mother), to waive her inheritance rights before she died.

At the Spanish court, conflict over the succession of Charles II emerged between the two Marianas—the Queen Mother and the Consort—sparking a period of intense political tension and intrigue from 1693 to 1696, culminating in the death of the Queen Mother. The Bavarian cause, led by the Queen Mother, found numerous followers among the nobles dissatisfied with the German clique of Mariana of Neuburg. According to rumors circulated by the court, there was a plot which intended to lock up the Queen and bring Prince Joseph Ferdinand to Madrid, to be placed on the throne under the regency of the Queen Mother and her chief supporters.

The Queen Mother died on May 16, 1696. Her triumph was a posthumously signed will in which her son, Charles II, decreed in September 1696 his great-nephew Joseph Ferdinand of Bavaria, the heir to the monarchy. In the State Council of June 13, 1696, an intermediate position between the French and the imperial candidates for succession, in which Joseph Ferdinand was featured as the candidate best suited to the succession. In the end Charles wrote a will in which he declared the Electoral Prince to be his successor.

In September of that year Charles II had a severe relapse so the State Council resolved to force the King to sign the will in June. The King had a relapse on October 9, so that the State Council reconvened. At that meeting the Bavarian party got the will pushed through and Cardinal Portocarrero forced King Charles II to sign the testament in favor of the Electoral Prince of Bavaria: only the Admiral of Castile, the Constable and three members supported the Archduke Charles.

During the minority of Joseph Ferdinand, the regency instituted by the will appointed a governing board which supported Mariana of Austria during the minority of Charles II, headed by Cardinal Portocarrero, the Regent-Governor who would have very broad powers.

The stubborn defence of the nomination by the pro-Bavarian Cardinal Portocarrero, become a key policy of the last years of the reign of Charles II. The Cardinal prevented Charles II from succumbing to the influence of his wife and possibly summoning a Parliament to modify the testament.

In early 1698 Portocarrero presented the king with a new report of the State Council in favor of the Bavarian Succession. The monarch wanted to consult with Pope Innocent XII, who was also allegedly pro-Bavarian. It was in such circumstances that the King reaffirmed his Testament:

Mariana of Neuburg reacted against the Testament by having Catalonia seized, and German troops were sent to Toledo and Madrid, while her cousin, Prince George of Hesse-Darmstadt prepared to leave Barcelona with his troops. The French Ambassador to Madrid, Henri, duc d’Harcourt, met 6000 soldiers who had arrived in Madrid ready to intervene.

Max Emanuel of Bavaria sent for his son to come to Brussels with the intention that the States of Flanders would swear an oath on the death of Charles II. Joseph Ferdinand came to the Flemish capital on 23 May 1698. Meanwhile, Louis XIV agreed in The Hague with the maritime powers on the distribution of the Spanish Crown&#x27;s lands on the death of Charles II: the First Partition Treaty was signed with England on September 8 and the United Provinces on 11 October. It provided that the peninsular kingdoms, with the exception of Guipúzcoa, plus the Indies would go to Joseph Ferdinand (section 5), the Archduke Charles would receive the Milanese (article 6), while Louis, Dauphin of France would remain in possession of the kingdoms of Naples and Sicily, as well as the State of Presidi and the Marquisate of Finale.

The Spanish refused to have their empire divided without being consulted, and on 14 November 1698, Charles II published his will making Joseph Ferdinand heir to an independent and undivided Spanish Empire.

==Death and legacy==
Joseph Ferdinand died of smallpox on February 6, 1699, at the age of six, leaving the Spanish Succession uncertain again. His death was quite sudden, marked by seizures, vomiting and prolonged loss of consciousness. He was rumored to have been poisoned by his grandfather Leopold I, but nothing has been proven. He is buried in Brussels. With him the furthest line of descent possible from the marriage of Philip IV of Spain and his second wife and niece Mariana of Austria ended.

Joseph Ferdinand&#x27;s death before that of Charles II, the last Habsburg king of Spain, helped to trigger the War of the Spanish Succession. If he had survived Charles, the European powers might have permitted him to accede to the throne of Spain under the terms of the First Partition Treaty.

In his biography of Charles II, John Langdon-Davies describes the impact of the prince&#x27;s death:It was as if the one iron band holding together a crumbling ruin had suddenly broken; the mystical joy gave way to very material discontent. The population which had been exalted by patriotic fantasy into a state of euphoria that bore no relation whatever to their daily experiences, now saw life as slow starvation, with bread and all other foods scarce and dear, fields without crops, frontiers without protection, existence without hope. Even when there was almost nothing to eat Spaniards could feel themselves well-fed if they could believe in their dream; once the dream vanished, all crumbled away. Jose Fernando of Bavaria had been the point around which fantasy could weave compensating patterns of national dignity, at his death the insubstantial fabric disappeared.

<text>Physeter is a genus of toothed whales. There is only one living species in this genus: the sperm whale (&quot;Physeter macrocephalus&quot;). Some extremely poorly known fossil species have also been assigned to the same genus including &quot;Physeter antiquus&quot; (5.3–2.6 mya) from the Pliocene of France, and &quot;Physeter vetus&quot; (2.6 mya – 12 ka) from the Quaternary of the U.S. state of Georgia. &quot;Physeter vetus&quot; is very likely an invalid species, as the few teeth that were used to identify this species appear to be identical to those of another toothed whale, &quot;Orycterocetus quadratidens&quot;.

Sperm whales spend more than 72% of their time engaged in foraging dive cycles.
Foraging behavior, including buzz vocalizations for prey capture. 
The efficiency of sperm whale foraging is attributed to their effective long range echolocation, and efficient locomotion during deep dives.

The name is from Greek () .

<text>Rapperswil-Jona is a municipality in the &quot;Wahlkreis&quot; (constituency) of See-Gaster in the canton of St. Gallen in Switzerland.
Besides Rapperswil and Jona, which were separate municipalities until 2006, Rapperswil-Jona also includes Bollingen, Busskirch, Curtiberg, Kempraten-Lenggis, and Wagen.

The official language of Rapperswil is (the Swiss variety of Standard) German, but the main spoken language is the local variant of the Alemannic Swiss German dialect.

==Today==


On 1 January 2007, the municipalities of Rapperswil and Jona merged to form a new political entity. After the merger Rapperswil-Jona had a population of 25,777 (17,799 from Jona and 7,601 from Rapperswil). This makes it the second largest town in the canton of St. Gallen after the capital St. Gallen itself. On the population was .

Rapperswil-Jona is one of the most significant traffic junctions in the region, and Rapperswil railway station is a nodal point for the Swiss Federal Railways, Südostbahn and S-Bahn Zürich lines. Zürichsee-Schifffahrtsgesellschaft (commonly abbreviated to &quot;ZSG&quot;) operates passenger vessels on the Lake Zürich, connecting surrounding towns between Zürich-Bürkliplatz and Rapperswil. The &quot;Seedamm&quot;, a moraine of the across Lake Zürich, links Rapperswil with Hurden (SZ) on the other side of the lake. This connection has been part of old pilgrimage routes. From early centuries, a wooden footbridge led across Lake Zürich. At a later stage, the bridge was replaced by a stone dam. In 2001, a new wooden footbridge was opened alongside the dam for the first 840 meters of the crossing. It was built in the same place as the original bridge and links Rapperswil with the nearby bridge chapel (&quot;Heilig Hüsli&quot;) built in 1551.

The main sights are concentrated in the centre of Rapperswil and can be seen while strolling through the medieval alleys. The main sights of Rapperswil are its roses, the castle, the reconstructed wooden bridge to Hurden with its bridge chapel, and a Capuchin monastery. There are also a number of churches, chapels, and the nearby Wurmsbach Abbey. In the surroundings of the town there are a number of churches. St. John&#x27;s Church in Rapperswil was built around 1220 and became Rapperswil&#x27;s parish church in 1253, the Chapel St. Ursula in the village of Kempraten was built around 885. The St. Dionysius Chapel, dedicated to Denis, the first bishop of Paris, was reconstructed in 1493 and attracts pilgrims. The nunnery (Wurmsbach Abbey), was established in 1259 and today houses an institute for girls, and St. Martin Busskirch is the former parish church of Rapperswil.

Bollingen is known for the &quot;Tower&quot; built there by Carl Jung. Kempraten is one of the most important archeological sites in the canton of St. Gallen and is located at the northern shore of &quot;Obersee&quot;, the eastern part of Lake Zürich.

==History==

Settlements in the area of Rapperswil-Jona date back at least 5000 years. Evidence includes archaeological relicts collected from the Neolithic Seegubel site or the body burials of the La Tène culture. Centum Prata, after which Kempraten is named, is an important archeological site of the Gallo-Roman era.

Atop the &quot;Lindenhof&quot; hill overlooking a former small village (&quot;Endingen&quot;), Rapperswil Castle was built around 1220 by the Counts of Rapperswil and is first mentioned in 1229. The town was founded when the nobility of Rapperswil moved from Altendorf across the lake to Rapperswil. The town was soon acquired by the Habsburg family who, in 1358/60, built the wooden bridge across the upper Lake Zürich. Later, the town bought itself free, and ending Old Zürich War made an alliance with the Swiss Confederation.

Because of its strategic location along important infrastructure the town grew rich because of flourishing trade. This allowed a certain degree of freedom which was ended with the formation of Swiss cantons by Napoleon. Rapperswil was at first part of the Helvetic canton of Linth. After 1803&#x27;s Act of Mediation, it joined the canton of St. Gallen. The locational advantage of the place attracted the national Circus Knie who built its headquarters in Rapperswil in 1919. The circus is now also responsible for the Knie&#x27;s Kinderzoo and the &quot;Circus Museum&quot;.

=== Cultural heritage ===
After the Seedamm causeway and bridge were built in 1878, the &quot;Heilig Hüsli&quot; chapel was the only remaining structure of the medieval wooden bridge. It stood isolated in the lake and was not accessible to visitors until the reconstruction of the former wooden bridge was erected in 2001. The reconstructed wooden bridge is listed as Swiss heritage sites of national significance as part of the Seedamm area including Heilig Hüsli and the remains of the prehistoric wooden bridges respectively stilt house settlements.

Located at the &quot;Seedamm&quot; isthmus, an ice age moraine (Linth Glacier) between the &quot;Obersee&quot; and the main body of the &quot;Zürichsee&quot;, the area is in close vicinity to the prehistoric lake crossings that are documented by finds in the Hurden Rosshorn site. Three pile dwelling settlements were closely connected to these sea crossings: Freienbach–Hurden Seefeld, Rapperswil-Jona/Hombrechtikon–Feldbach and Rapperswil-Jona–Technikum. Because the lake has grown in size over time, the original piles are now around to under the water level of .

As well as being part of the 56 Swiss sites of the UNESCO World Heritage Site &quot;Prehistoric pile dwellings around the Alps&quot;, the settlements are also listed in the Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance as a &quot;Class object&quot;.

There are further sites that are listed as in the Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance as &quot;Class A&quot; object: The chapel of St. Dionys, Schloss Rapperswil with the Polish Museum and its archive and the &quot;Rathaus&quot; (Town Council house) of Rapperswil are the more recent structures. The Roman Vicus &quot;Centum Prata&quot; at Kempraten and the &quot;Seedamm&quot; region and historical bridge (which had existed in some form since the prehistoric era through the Middle Ages with the most recent bridge in 2001 and &quot;Heilig Hüsli&quot;) round out the five.

==Geography==
Rapperswil-Jona has an area, , of . Of this area, 37.4% is used for agricultural purposes, while 30.6% is forested. Of the rest of the land, 28.6% is settled (buildings or roads) and the remainder (3.4%) is non-productive (rivers or lakes).

Rapperswil-Jona is situated across the &quot;Seedamm&quot;, an ice age moraine built by the Linth Glacier, which separates Lake Zurich into an upper and lower part. The Linth Glacier, named after the River Linth, also formed Lake Zurich itself (glacial lake) and shaped the surrounding land. It was connected to the Rhine Glacier. The River Jona, which originates near Gibswil in the canton of Zürich, runs through Rapperswil-Jona and flows into &quot;Obersee&quot;.

==Demographics==
Most of the population () speaks German (86.9%), with Italian being second most common ( 3.1%) and Serbo-Croatian being third (2.1%).

==Transport==
===Train===


The municipality of Rapperswil-Jona is served by four railway stations, of which the main one is . This railway station is served by S-Bahn lines S5, S7, S15 and S40 of the Zürich S-Bahn, the first three of which provide frequent (6 trains per hour) and fast (36 minute journey time) links to the city of Zürich. It is also a calling point of the &quot;Voralpen-Express&quot;, an InterRegio (IR) running hourly between Lucerne and St. Gallen. The S5, S40 and the &quot;Voralpen-Express&quot; use the Seedamm causeway (Rapperswil-Pfäffikon railway). Rapperswil railway station is also the terminus of three hourly regional trains of St. Gallen S-Bahn: the S4 which operates eastwards to Sargans via St. Gallen, the S6 which operates south-east to Schwanden/Linthal via Ziegelbrücke, and the S17 which operates eastwards to Sargans via Ziegelbrücke.

The other three railway stations are , served by lines S5 and S15 of the Zürich S-Bahn (combined quarter-hourly service), , served half-hourly by line S7 of the Zürich S-Bahn, and , served half-hourly by lines S6 and S17 of St. Gallen S-Bahn. The fifth station, , is now disused.

The S5 and S15 of ZVV are operated by Swiss Federal Railways, whereas the S4, S6 and S17 (&#x27;), S40 (&#x27;), and the IR &quot;Voralpen-Express&quot; are operated by Südostbahn (SOB).

====History====
Prior to the 10 December 2023 timetable change, service over the Rapperswil-Ziegelbrücke railway line east of Rapperswil-Jona was provided by the S6 and InterRegio &quot;Voralpen-Express&quot;, which combined for a half-hourly service to Uznach. While the S6 called at all stations, the &quot;Voralpen-Express&quot; did not serve . With the upgrade from single track to double-track between and (constructed between 2021 and 2023), Rapperswil received two additional S-Bahn services. The S4, which followed a circle route between 2013 and 2023, was rerouted to run between Sargans and Rapperswil via . This line does not call at stations between Uznach and Rapperswil. Additionally, a new line, the S17, began operations between Sargans and Rapperswil via Ziegelbrücke (calling at all stations between Uznach and Rapperswil). The scheduled call at Schmerikon of the &quot;Voralpen-Express&quot; was suspended in December 2023.

===Bus===
The municipality is served by a local bus service, &quot;Stadtbus Rapperswil-Jona&quot;, provided since 2008 by the Verkehrsbetriebe Zürichsee und Oberland (VZO). In addition, &quot;&quot; operates line 622 to Wagen (continues to St. Gallenkappel/Wattwil) and, since December 2023, bus line 995 from to Hummelberg and Buechstrasse Ost. the bus services are as follows:

====History====
Until the timetable change on 10 December 2023, bus line 621 (operated by &quot;Schneider&quot;) ran between Rapperswil railway station and Jona, Buechstrasse Ost. This line stopped operations due to the increase in frequency of line 622, which mostly uses the same route. Line 995 operated between Rapperswil railway station and Hummelberg, but its leg between &quot;Kreuz&quot; (Jona railway station) and Rapperswil railway station was truncated in December 2023 for the same reason. Line 995 now also serves the leg from &quot;Jona Center&quot; to &quot;Jona, Buechstrasse Ost&quot;, formerly operated by line 621.

===Boat===
Rapperswil harbour is adjacent to the old town of Rapperswil and Rapperswil railway station. Lake shipping services of the &quot;Zürichsee-Schifffahrtsgesellschaft&quot; (&quot;ZSG&quot;) provide routes to Zürich and other lakeside towns on Lake Zürich. Most boats of &quot;ZSG&quot; dock Ufenau island near Rapperswil harbour.

During summer, there is a ferry across &quot;Obersee&quot;. The ferry connects a pier near the University of Applied Sciences Rapperswil (now part of OST), just south of Rapperswil railway station, with Lachen and Altendorf in the canton of Schwyz.

===Private transport===
As of 2016, an average of 26,000 road vehicles cross the Seedamm causeway and the &quot;Bahnhofstrasse&quot; in Rapperswil every day.

<doc id="313732" wikidata="Q21446362" url="?curid=313732" title="Physeteroidea">
<text>Physeteroidea is a superfamily that includes three extant species of whales: the sperm whale, in the genus &quot;Physeter&quot;, and the pygmy sperm whale and dwarf sperm whale, in the genus &quot;Kogia&quot;. In the past, these genera have sometimes been united in a single family, the Physeteridae, with the two &quot;Kogia&quot; species in the subfamily Kogiinae; however, recent practice is to allocate the genus &quot;Kogia&quot; to its own family, the [[Kogiidae]], leaving the Physeteridae as a monotypic (single extant species) family, although additional fossil representatives of both families are known.

== Characteristics ==

The sperm whale (&quot;Physeter macrocephalus&quot;) is the largest species of toothed whale, with adult bulls (males) growing to be about long, and weighing about . The two kogiid species are much smaller, around in length, and weighing .

The bodies of physeteroids are robustly proportioned, with paddle-shaped flippers. The lower jaw is always relatively small and thin relative to the upper jaw. The nasal bones of these whales are distinctly asymmetrical, with the blowhole being located on the left side of the head; in the sperm whale, this is near the top of the head, while on the kogiids it is further forward. All species have a large number of similar, and relatively simple, teeth. In the kogiids, and sometimes also in the sperm whale, the teeth in the upper jaw do not erupt, and are sometimes altogether absent.

The eyes of physeteroids are unable to swivel in their sockets, and possess only a vestigial anterior chamber. Echolocation likely is a far more important sense to these animals than vision.

Another common characteristic is the spermaceti, a semiliquid waxy white substance filling the &#x27;case&#x27; or spermaceti organ in the whale&#x27;s head, which plays a primary role in the production and directional manipulation of focused clicking sounds used for echolocation in the extant great sperm whale (&quot;Physeter macrocephalus&quot;). All three species dive to great depths to find food, although the sperm whale is believed to dive much deeper than either of the kogiids. Members of both families eat squid, fish, and even sharks.

Gestation lasts from 9 to 15 months, depending on species. The single calf remains with the mother for at least two years, before being weaned. Physeteroids do not reach full sexual maturity for several years. All species congregate in &#x27;pods&#x27; or herds, consisting of mostly females, calves, and adolescent males, although these pod sizes are typically smaller in the kogiids.

== Evolution ==
The earliest sperm whale fossils are known from the late Oligocene – about 25 million years ago, with an ancestry tracing back from the latest Eocene before diverging from the remainder of the odontocetid line, leading to the dolphins, and porpoises.

The fossil record suggests that sperm whales were more common in the Miocene, during which basal lineages (such as &quot;Zygophyseter&quot; and &quot;Brygmophyseter&quot;) existed; other fossil genera assigned to the Physeteridae include &quot;Ferecetotherium&quot;, &quot;Helvicetus&quot;, &quot;Idiorophus&quot;, &quot;Diaphorocetus&quot;, &quot;Aulophyseter&quot;, &quot;Orycterocetus&quot;, &quot;Scaldicetus&quot;, and &quot;Placoziphius&quot;, while kogiid fossil genera include &quot;Kogiopsis&quot;, &quot;Scaphokogia&quot;, and &quot;Praekogia&quot;. The earliest kogiids are known from the late Miocene, around 7 million years ago.

The close relationship between extant Physeteridae and Kogiidae is confirmed in recent molecular studies using mitochondrial cytochrome &quot;b&quot;,; on the basis of these analyses, their nearest relatives appear to be the Ziphiidae on one hand, and the Mysticeti and Platanistidae on the other. The last cited paper also favours the grouping of Physeteridae and Kogiidae in a single superfamily, Physeteroidea, as has sometimes previously been suggested. Bianucci &amp; Landini, 2006 suggest that &quot;Diaphorocetus&quot;, &quot;Zygophyseter&quot;, &quot;Naganocetus&quot;, and &quot;Aulophyseter&quot; antedate the inferred split of the Kogiidae and Physeteridae, thus would restrict the family Physeteridae to those genera that postdate this split (a cladistic view).

== Classification ==
They are members of the Odontoceti, the suborder containing all the toothed whales and dolphins. Suggestions that the sperm whales might be a sister group to the baleen whales were refuted by molecular and morphological data, confirming the monophyly of Odontoceti including sperm whales. One extant species of the genus &quot;Physeter&quot; is placed in the family Physeteridae. Two species of the related extant genus &quot;Kogia&quot;, the pygmy sperm whale &quot;K. breviceps&quot; and the dwarf sperm whale &quot;K. simus&quot;, are sometimes also placed in this family, or else are placed in their own family, the Kogiidae.

<doc id="313733" wikidata="Q561737" url="?curid=313733" title="François Hotman">
<text>François Hotman (23 August 1524 – 12 February 1590) was a French lawyer and writer, associated with the legal humanists and with the monarchomaques, who struggled against absolute monarchy. His first name is often written &#x27;Francis&#x27; in English. His surname is Latinized by himself as Hotomanus, by others as Hotomannus and Hottomannus. He has been called &quot;one of the first modern revolutionaries&quot;.

== Biography ==

He was born in Paris, the eldest son of Pierre Hotman (1485–1554), Seigneur de Villers-St-Paul, jure uxoris and Paule de Marle, heiress of the Seigneurie de Vaugien and Villers-St-Paul. His grandfather Lambert Hotman, a Silesian burgher, emigrating from Emmerich, (in the Duchy of Cleves), had left his native country to go to France with Engelbert, Count of Nevers. His father Pierre was a lawyer, practising at the Paris Bar. Around the time of Francois&#x27; birth, Pierre was appointed to an official position in the Department of Woods and Forests (known as the &#x27;Marble Table&#x27;). By this time, the Hotman family, that is, Pierre, his brothers and uncles, were one of the most important legal families in France.

Pierre, a zealous Catholic and a counsellor of the &quot;parlement&quot; of Paris, intended his son for the law, and sent him at the age of fifteen to the University of Orléans. He obtained his doctorate in three years, and returned to Paris. The work of a practising lawyer was not to his taste; he turned to jurisprudence and literature, and in 1546 was appointed lecturer in Roman Law at the University of Paris. The fortitude of Anne Dubourg under torture gained his adhesion to the cause of reform.

Giving up a career on which he had entered with high repute, he went in 1547 to Lyon. In the summer of 1548, at Bourges, he married Claude Aubelin (daughter of Guillaume Aubelin, Sieur de La Rivière and Françoise de Brachet). She and her father, like himself, were refugees. In October 1548, he moved to Geneva to be John Calvin&#x27;s secretary. He went to Lausanne, and was elected to that university in February 1550. There, on the recommendation of Calvin, he was appointed professor of &quot;belles lettres&quot; and history. He was made a citizen of Geneva in 1553, his eldest child Jean was born there in 1552. On the invitation of the magistracy, he lectured at Strasbourg on law in October 1555, and became professor in June 1556, superseding François Baudouin, who had been his colleague in Paris. He was a member, from Strasbourg, to the Colloquy of Worms on 11 September 1557.

His fame was such that overtures were made to him by the courts of Prussia and Hesse, and by Elizabeth I of England. Twice he visited Germany, in 1556 accompanying Calvin to the Diet of Frankfurt. He was entrusted with confidential missions from the Huguenot leaders to German potentates, carrying at one time credentials from Catherine de&#x27; Medici. In 1560 he was one of the principal instigators of the Amboise conspiracy; in September of that year he was with Antoine of Navarre at Nérac. In 1562 he attached himself to Louis, prince of Condé. In 1564 he became professor of civil law at Valence, retrieving by his success the reputation of its university. In 1567 he succeeded Jacques Cujas in the chair of jurisprudence at Bourges.

Five months later his house and library were wrecked by a Catholic mob; he fled by Orléans to Paris, where Michel de l&#x27;Hôpital made him historiographer to king Charles IX. As agent for the Huguenots, he was sent to Blois to negotiate the peace of 1568. He returned to Bourges, but was driven away by the outbreak of hostilities. At Sancerre, during its siege, he composed his &quot;Consolatio&quot; (published in 1593). The peace of 1570 restored him to Bourges, whence a third time he fled the massacre of St Bartholomew (1572). In 1572 he left France forever with his family, in favour of Geneva. He there became professor of Roman law and published his &#x27;Franco-Gallia&#x27; in 1573. On the approach of the duke of Savoy he removed to Basel in 1579. In 1580 he was appointed councillor of state to Henry of Navarre. The plague sent him in 1582 to Montbéliard, where his wife Claude died in 1583. Returning to Geneva in 1584 he developed a kind of scientific turn, dabbling in alchemy and the research for the philosopher&#x27;s stone. He was admitted to the Privy Council of King Henry in December 1585. In 1589, he finally retired to Basel, where he died, leaving two sons and four daughters; he was buried in the cathedral.

== Works ==

François Hotman was a home-loving and genuinely pious man (as his &quot;Consolatio&quot; shows). His constant removals were inspired less by fear for himself than for his family, and he had a constitutional desire for peace. He did much for 16th century jurisprudence, having a critical knowledge of Roman sources, and a fine Latin style. He broached the idea of a national code of French law. His works were very numerous, beginning with his &quot;De gradibus cognationis&quot; (1546), and including a treatise on the Eucharist (1566); a treatise (&quot;Anti-Tribonian&quot;, 1567) to show that French law could not be based on Justinian; a life of Coligny (1575); a polemic (&quot;Brutum fulmen&quot;, 1585) directed against a bull of Sixtus V, with many other works on law, history, politics, and classical learning.

His most important work, the &quot;Franco-Gallia&quot; (1573), found favour neither with Catholics nor with Huguenots in its day (except when it suited their purposes); yet its vogue has been compared to that obtained later by Jean-Jacques Rousseau&#x27;s &quot;Contrat Social&quot;. It presented an &quot;Ideal of Protestant statesmanship&quot;, pleading for a representative government and an elective monarchy. It served the purpose of the Jesuits in their pamphlet war against Henry IV of France.

==Family==
He had seven children with his wife:
# Jean Hotman, Marquis de Villers-St-Paul, Count de Hotman d 1634. He married Renée de St-Martin, the former lady-in-waiting to Penelope Devereux, Lady Rich
# Theages
# Daniel, Prêtre de l&#x27;Oratoire
# Marie Strausbourg
# Pierre, Counsellor to the King
# Suzanne married first to John Menteith of Scotland, and secondly to Antoine d&#x27;Ailleboust, counsellor to Henri II, Prince of Condé. Their son Louis d&#x27;Ailleboust de Coulonge, was the governor of New France 1648–1651.
# Theodora m Jean Burquenon, Secretary of this same Prince of Condé.

<text>In the mathematical field of knot theory, a knot polynomial is a knot invariant in the form of a polynomial whose coefficients encode some of the properties of a given knot.

==History==
The first knot polynomial, the Alexander polynomial, was introduced by James Waddell Alexander II in 1923. Other knot polynomials were not found until almost 60 years later.

In the 1960s, John Conway came up with a skein relation for a version of the Alexander polynomial, usually referred to as the Alexander–Conway polynomial. The significance of this skein relation was not realized until the early 1980s, when Vaughan Jones discovered the Jones polynomial. This led to the discovery of more knot polynomials, such as the so-called HOMFLY polynomial.

Soon after Jones&#x27; discovery, Louis Kauffman noticed the Jones polynomial could be computed by means of a partition function (state-sum model), which involved the bracket polynomial, an invariant of framed knots. This opened up avenues of research linking knot theory and statistical mechanics.

In the late 1980s, two related breakthroughs were made. Edward Witten demonstrated that the Jones polynomial, and similar Jones-type invariants, had an interpretation in Chern–Simons theory. Viktor Vasilyev and Mikhail Goussarov started the theory of finite type invariants of knots. The coefficients of the previously named polynomials are known to be of finite type (after perhaps a suitable &quot;change of variables&quot;).

In recent years, the Alexander polynomial has been shown to be related to Floer homology. The graded Euler characteristic of the knot Floer homology of Peter Ozsváth and Zoltan Szabó is the Alexander polynomial.

==Examples==
Alexander–Briggs notation organizes knots by their crossing number.

Alexander polynomials and Conway polynomials can &quot;not&quot; recognize the difference of left-trefoil knot and right-trefoil knot.

So we have the same situation as the granny knot and square knot since the addition of knots in formula_1 is the product of knots in knot polynomials.

<doc id="313737" wikidata="Q2392270" url="?curid=313737" title="Anti-spam techniques">
<text>Various anti-spam techniques are used to prevent email spam (unsolicited bulk email).

No technique is a complete solution to the spam problem, and each has trade-offs between incorrectly rejecting legitimate email (false positives) as opposed to not rejecting all spam email (false negatives) – and the associated costs in time, effort, and cost of wrongfully obstructing good mail.

Anti-spam techniques can be broken into four broad categories: those that require actions by individuals, those that can be automated by email administrators, those that can be automated by email senders and those employed by researchers and law enforcement officials.

==End-user techniques==

There are a number of techniques that individuals can use to restrict the availability of their email addresses, with the goal of reducing their chance of receiving spam.

===Discretion===
Sharing an email address only among a limited group of correspondents is one way to limit the chance that the address will be &quot;harvested&quot; and targeted by spam. Similarly, when forwarding messages to a number of recipients who don&#x27;t know one another, recipient addresses can be put in the &quot;bcc: field&quot; so that each recipient does not get a list of the other recipients&#x27; email addresses.

===Address munging===
Email addresses posted on webpages, Usenet or chat rooms are vulnerable to e-mail address harvesting. Address munging is the practice of disguising an e-mail address to prevent it from being automatically collected in this way, but still allow a human reader to reconstruct the original: an email address such as, &quot;no-one@example.com&quot;, might be written as &quot;no-one at example dot com&quot;, for instance. A related technique is to display all or part of the email address as an image, or as jumbled text with the order of characters restored using CSS.

===Avoid responding to spam===
A common piece of advice is to not to reply to spam messages as spammers may simply regard responses as confirmation that an email address is valid. Similarly, many spam messages contain web links or addresses which the user is directed to follow to be removed from the spammer&#x27;s mailing list – and these should be treated as dangerous. In any case, sender addresses are often forged in spam messages, so that responding to spam may result in failed deliveries – or may reach completely innocent third parties.

===Contact forms===

Businesses and individuals sometimes avoid publicising an email address by asking for contact to come via a &quot;contact form&quot; on a webpage – which then typically forwards the information via email. Such forms, however, are sometimes inconvenient to users, as they are not able to use their preferred email client, risk entering a faulty reply address, and are typically not notified about delivery problems. Further, contact forms have the drawback that they require a website with the appropriate technology.

In some cases contact forms also send the message to the email address given by the user. This allows the contact form to be used for sending spam, which may incur email deliverability problems from the site once the spam is reported and the sending IP is blacklisted.

===Disable HTML in email===
Many modern mail programs incorporate web browser functionality, such as the display of HTML, URLs, and images.

Avoiding or disabling this feature does not help avoid spam. It may, however, be useful to avoid some problems if a user opens a spam message: offensive images, obfuscated hyperlinks, being tracked by web bugs, being targeted by JavaScript or attacks upon security vulnerabilities in the HTML renderer. Mail clients which do not automatically download and display HTML, images or attachments have fewer risks, as do clients who have been configured to not display these by default.

===Disposable email addresses===
An email user may sometimes need to give an address to a site without complete assurance that the site owner will not use it for sending spam. One way to mitigate the risk is to provide a &quot;disposable&quot; email address — an address which the user can disable or abandon which forwards email to a real account. A number of services provide disposable address forwarding. Addresses can be manually disabled, can expire after a given time interval, or can expire after a certain number of messages have been forwarded.
Disposable email addresses can be used by users to track whether a site owner has disclosed an address, or had a security breach.

===Ham passwords===
Systems that use &quot;ham passwords&quot; ask unrecognised senders to include in their email a password that demonstrates that the email message is a &quot;ham&quot; (not spam) message. Typically the email address and ham password would be described on a web page, and the ham password would be included in the subject line of an email message (or appended to the &quot;username&quot; part of the email address using the &quot;plus addressing&quot; technique). Ham passwords are often combined with filtering systems which let through only those messages that have identified themselves as &quot;ham&quot;.

===Reporting spam===

Tracking down a spammer&#x27;s ISP and reporting the offense can lead to the spammer&#x27;s service being terminated and criminal prosecution. Unfortunately, it can be difficult to track down the spammer, and while there are some online tools such as SpamCop and Network Abuse Clearinghouse to assist, they are not always accurate. Historically, reporting spam in this way has not played a large part in abating spam, since the spammers simply move their operation to another URL, ISP or network of IP addresses.

In many countries consumers may also report unwanted and deceptive commercial email to the authorities, e.g. in the US to the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC), or similar agencies in other countries.

==Automated techniques for email administrators==
There are now a large number of applications, appliances, services, and software systems that email administrators can use to reduce the load of spam on their systems and mailboxes. In general these attempt to reject (or &quot;block&quot;), the majority of spam email outright at the SMTP connection stage. If they do accept a message, they will typically then analyze the content further – and may decide to &quot;quarantine&quot; any categorised as spam.

===Authentication===
A number of systems have been developed that allow domain name owners to identify email as authorized. Many of these systems use the DNS to list sites authorized to send email on their behalf. After many other proposals, SPF, DKIM and DMARC are all now widely supported with growing adoption. While not directly attacking spam, these systems make it much harder to spoof addresses, a common technique of spammers - but also used in phishing, and other types of fraud via email.

===Challenge/response systems===
A method which may be used by internet service providers, by specialized services or enterprises to combat spam is to require unknown senders to pass various tests before their messages are delivered. These strategies are termed &quot;challenge/response systems&quot;.

===Checksum-based filtering===
&quot;Checksum-based filter&quot; exploits the fact that the messages are sent in bulk, that is that they will be identical with small variations. Checksum-based filters strip out everything that might vary between messages, reduce what remains to a checksum, and look that checksum up in a database such as the Distributed Checksum Clearinghouse which collects the checksums of messages that email recipients consider to be spam (some people have a button on their email client which they can click to nominate a message as being spam); if the checksum is in the database, the message is likely to be spam. To avoid being detected in this way, spammers will sometimes insert unique invisible gibberish known as &quot;hashbusters&quot; into the middle of each of their messages, to make each message have a unique checksum.

===Country-based filtering===
Some email servers expect to never communicate with particular countries from which they receive a great deal of spam. Therefore, they use country-based filtering – a technique that blocks email from certain countries. This technique is based on country of origin determined by the sender&#x27;s IP address rather than any trait of the sender.

===DNS-based blacklists===
There are large number of free and commercial DNS-based Blacklists, or DNSBLs which allow a mail server to quickly look up the IP of an incoming mail connection - and reject it if it is listed there. Administrators can choose from scores of DNSBLs, each of which reflects different policies: some list sites known to emit spam; others list open mail relays or proxies; others list ISPs known to support spam.

===URL filtering===
Most spam/phishing messages contain an URL that they entice victims into clicking on. Thus, a popular technique since the early 2000s consists of extracting URLs from messages and looking them up in databases such as Spamhaus&#x27; Domain Block List (DBL), SURBL, and URIBL.

===Strict enforcement of RFC standards===
Many spammers use poorly written software or are unable to comply with the standards because they do not have legitimate control of the computer they are using to send spam (zombie computer). By setting tighter limits on the deviation from RFC standards that the MTA will accept, a mail administrator can reduce spam significantly - but this also runs the risk of rejecting mail from older or poorly written or configured servers.

Greeting delay – A sending server is required to wait until it has received the SMTP greeting banner before it sends any data. A deliberate pause can be introduced by receiving servers to allow them to detect and deny any spam-sending applications that do not wait to receive this banner.

Temporary rejection – The greylisting technique is built on the fact that the SMTP protocol allows for temporary rejection of incoming messages. Greylisting temporarily rejects all messages from unknown senders or mail servers – using the standard 4xx error codes. All compliant MTAs will proceed to retry delivery later, but many spammers and spambots will not. The downside is that all legitimate messages from first-time senders will experience a delay in delivery.

HELO/EHLO checking – says that an SMTP server &quot;MAY verify that the domain name argument in the EHLO command actually corresponds to the IP address of the client. However, if the verification fails, the server MUST NOT refuse to accept a message on that basis.&quot; Systems can, however, be configured to 
* Refuse connections from hosts that give an invalid HELO – for example, a HELO that is not an FQDN or is an IP address not surrounded by square brackets.
* Refusing connections from hosts that give an obviously fraudulent HELO
* Refusing to accept email whose HELO/EHLO argument does not resolve in DNS

Invalid pipelining – Several SMTP commands are allowed to be placed in one network packet and &quot;pipelined&quot;. For example, if an email is sent with a CC: header, several SMTP &quot;RCPT TO&quot; commands might be placed in a single packet instead of one packet per &quot;RCPT TO&quot; command. The SMTP protocol, however, requires that errors be checked and everything is synchronized at certain points. Many spammers will send everything in a single packet since they do not care about errors and it is more efficient. Some MTAs will detect this invalid pipelining and reject email sent this way.

Nolisting – The email servers for any given domain are specified in a prioritized list, via the MX records. The nolisting technique is simply the adding of an MX record pointing to a non-existent server as the &quot;primary&quot; (i.e. that with the lowest preference value) – which means that an initial mail contact will always fail. Many spam sources do not retry on failure, so the spammer will move on to the next victim; legitimate email servers should retry the next higher numbered MX, and normal email will be delivered with only a brief delay.

Quit detection – An SMTP connection should always be closed with a QUIT command. Many spammers skip this step because their spam has already been sent and taking the time to properly close the connection takes time and bandwidth. Some MTAs are capable of detecting whether or not the connection is closed correctly and use this as a measure of how trustworthy the other system is.

===Honeypots===
Another approach is simply creating an imitation MTA that gives the appearance of being an open mail relay, or an imitation TCP/IP proxy server that gives the appearance of being an open proxy. Spammers who probe systems for open relays and proxies will find such a host and attempt to send mail through it, wasting their time and resources, and potentially, revealing information about themselves and the origin of the spam they are sending to the entity that operates the honeypot. Such a system may simply discard the spam attempts, submit them to DNSBLs, or store them for analysis by the entity operating the honeypot that may enable identification of the spammer for blocking.

===Hybrid filtering===

SpamAssassin, Policyd-weight and others use some or all of the various tests for spam, and assign a numerical score to each test. Each message is scanned for these patterns, and the applicable scores tallied up. If the total is above a fixed value, the message is rejected or flagged as spam. By ensuring that no single spam test by itself can flag a message as spam, the false positive rate can be greatly reduced.

===Outbound spam protection===
Outbound spam protection involves scanning email traffic as it exits a network, identifying spam messages and then taking an action such as blocking the message or shutting off the source of the traffic. While the primary impact of spam is on spam recipients, sending networks also experience financial costs, such as wasted bandwidth, and the risk of having their IP addresses blocked by receiving networks.

Outbound spam protection not only stops spam, but also lets system administrators track down spam sources on their network and remediate them – for example, clearing malware from machines which have become infected with a virus or are participating in a botnet.

===PTR/reverse DNS checks===
The PTR DNS records in the reverse DNS can be used for a number of things, including:
* Most email mail transfer agents (mail servers) use a forward-confirmed reverse DNS (FCrDNS) verification and if there is a valid domain name, put it into the &quot;Received:&quot; trace header field.
* Some email mail transfer agents will perform FCrDNS verification on the domain name given in the SMTP HELO and EHLO commands. See #Strict enforcement of RFC standards §HELO/EHLO .
* To check the domain names in the rDNS to see if they are likely from dial-up users, dynamically assigned addresses, or home-based broadband customers. Since the vast majority of email that originates from these computers is spam, many mail servers also refuse email with missing or &quot;generic&quot; rDNS names.
* A Forward Confirmed reverse DNS verification can create a form of authentication that there is a valid relationship between the owner of a domain name and the owner of the network that has been given an IP address. While reliant on the DNS infrastructure, which has known vulnerabilities, this authentication is strong enough that it can be used for whitelisting purposes because spammers and phishers cannot usually bypass this verification when they use zombie computers to forge the domains.

===Rule-based filtering===
Content filtering techniques rely on the specification of lists of words or regular expressions disallowed in mail messages. Thus, if a site receives spam advertising &quot;herbal Viagra&quot;, the administrator might place this phrase in the filter configuration. The mail server would then reject any message containing the phrase.

Header filtering looks at the header of the email which contains information about the origin, destination and content of the message. Although spammers will often spoof fields in the header in order to hide their identity, or to try to make the email look more legitimate than it is, many of these spoofing methods can be detected, and any violation of, e.g., , standards on how the header is to be formed can also serve as a basis for rejecting the message.

===SMTP callback verification===
Since a large percentage of spam has forged and invalid sender (&quot;from&quot;) addresses, some spam can be detected by checking that this &quot;from&quot; address is valid. A mail server can try to verify the sender address by making an SMTP connection back to the mail exchanger for the address, as if it were creating a bounce, but stopping just before any email is sent.

Callback verification has various drawbacks: (1) Since nearly all spam has forged return addresses, nearly all callbacks are to innocent third party mail servers that are unrelated to the spam; (2) When the spammer uses a trap address as his sender&#x27;s address. If the receiving MTA tries to make the callback using the trap address in a MAIL FROM command, the receiving MTA&#x27;s IP address will be blacklisted; (3) Finally, the standard VRFY and EXPN commands used to verify an address have been so exploited by spammers that few mail administrators enable them, leaving the receiving SMTP server no effective way to validate the sender&#x27;s email address.

===SMTP proxy===
SMTP proxies allow combating spam in real time, combining sender&#x27;s behavior controls, providing legitimate users immediate feedback, eliminating a need for quarantine.

===Spamtrapping===
Spamtrapping is the seeding of an email address so that spammers can find it, but normal users can not. If the email address is used then the sender must be a spammer and they are black listed.

As an example, if the email address &quot;spamtrap@example.org&quot; is placed in the source HTML of a web site in a way that it isn&#x27;t displayed on the web page, human visitors to the website would not see it. Spammers, on the other hand, use web page scrapers and bots to harvest email addresses from HTML source code - so they would find this address. When the spammer later sends to the address the spamtrap knows this is highly likely to be a spammer and can take appropriate action.

===Statistical content filtering===
Statistical, or Bayesian, filtering once set up requires no administrative maintenance per se: instead, users mark messages as &quot;spam&quot; or &quot;nonspam&quot; and the filtering software learns from these judgements. Thus, it is matched to the &quot;end user&#x27;s&quot; needs, and as long as users consistently mark/tag the emails, can respond quickly to changes in spam content. Statistical filters typically also look at message headers, considering not just the content but also peculiarities of the transport mechanism of the email.

Software programs that implement statistical filtering include Bogofilter, DSPAM, SpamBayes, ASSP, CRM114, the email programs Mozilla and Mozilla Thunderbird, Mailwasher, and later revisions of SpamAssassin.

===Tarpits===
A &quot;tarpit&quot; is any server software which intentionally responds extremely slowly to client commands. By running a tarpit which treats acceptable mail normally and known spam slowly or which appears to be an open mail relay, a site can slow down the rate at which spammers can inject messages into the mail facility. Depending on the server and internet speed, a tarpit can slow an attack by a factor of around 500. Many systems will simply disconnect if the server doesn&#x27;t respond quickly, which will eliminate the spam. However, a few legitimate email systems will also not deal correctly with these delays. The fundamental idea is to slow the attack so that the perpetrator has to waste time without any significant success.

An organization can successfully deploy a tarpit if it is able to define the range of addresses, protocols, and ports for deception. The process involves a router passing the supported traffic to the appropriate server while those sent by other contacts are sent to the tarpit. Examples of tarpits include the Labrea tarpit, Honeyd, SMTP tarpits, and IP-level tarpits.

=== Collateral damage ===

Measures to protect against spam can cause collateral damage. This includes:

*The measures may consume resources, both in the server and on the network.

*When a mail server rejects legitimate messages, the sender needs to contact the recipient out of channel.

*When legitimate messages are relegated to a spam folder, the sender is not notified of this. 

*If a recipient periodically checks his spam folder, that will cost him time and if there is a lot of spam it is easy to overlook the few legitimate messages.

* Measures that imposes costs on a third party server may be considered to be abuse and result in deliverability problems.

==Automated techniques for email senders==

There are a variety of techniques that email senders use to try to make sure that they do not send spam. Failure to control the amount of spam sent, as judged by email receivers, can often cause even legitimate email to be blocked and for the sender to be put on DNSBLs.

===Background checks on new users and customers===

Since spammer&#x27;s accounts are frequently disabled due to violations of abuse policies, they are constantly trying to create new accounts. Due to the damage done to an ISP&#x27;s reputation when it is the source of spam, many ISPs and web email providers use CAPTCHAs on new accounts to verify that it is a real human registering the account, and not an automated spamming system. They can also verify that credit cards are not stolen before accepting new customers, check the Spamhaus Project ROKSO list, and do other background checks.

===Confirmed opt-in for mailing lists===

A malicious person can easily attempt to subscribe another user to a mailing list — to harass them, or to make the company or organisation appear to be spamming. To prevent this, all modern mailing list management programs (such as GNU Mailman, LISTSERV, Majordomo, and qmail&#x27;s ezmlm) support &quot;confirmed opt-in&quot; by default. Whenever an email address is presented for subscription to the list, the software will send a confirmation message to that address. The confirmation message contains no advertising content, so it is not construed to be spam itself, and the address is not added to the live mail list unless the recipient responds to the confirmation message.

===Egress spam filtering===
Email senders typically now do the same type of anti-spam checks on email coming from their users and customers as for inward email coming from the rest of the Internet. This protects their reputation, which could otherwise be harmed in the case of infection by spam-sending malware.

===Limit email backscatter===
If a receiving server initially fully accepts an email, and only later determines that the message is spam or to a non-existent recipient, it will generate a bounce message back to the supposed sender. However, if (as is often the case with spam), the sender information on the incoming email was forged to be that of an unrelated third party then this bounce message is backscatter spam. For this reason it is generally preferable for most rejection of incoming email to happen during the SMTP connection stage, with a 5xx error code, while the sending server is still connected. In this case then the &quot;sending&quot; server will report the problem to the real sender cleanly.

===Port 25 blocking===
Firewalls and routers can be programmed to not allow SMTP traffic (TCP port 25) from machines on the network that are not supposed to run Mail Transfer Agents or send email. This practice is somewhat controversial when ISPs block home users, especially if the ISPs do not allow the blocking to be turned off upon request. Email can still be sent from these computers to designated smart hosts via port 25 and to other smart hosts via the email submission port 587.

===Port 25 interception===
Network address translation can be used to intercept all port 25 (SMTP) traffic and direct it to a mail server that enforces rate limiting and egress spam filtering. This is commonly done in hotels, but it can cause email privacy problems, as well making it impossible to use STARTTLS and SMTP-AUTH if the port 587 submission port isn&#x27;t used.

===Rate limiting===
Machines that suddenly start sending lots of email may well have become zombie computers. By limiting the rate that email can be sent around what is typical for the computer in question, legitimate email can still be sent, but large spam runs can be slowed down until manual investigation can be done.

===Spam report feedback loops===
By monitoring spam reports from places such as spamcop, AOL&#x27;s feedback loop, and Network Abuse Clearinghouse, the domain&#x27;s abuse@ mailbox, etc., ISPs can often learn of problems before they seriously damage the ISP&#x27;s reputation and have their mail servers blacklisted.

===FROM field control===

Both malicious software and human spam senders often use forged FROM addresses when sending spam messages. Control may be enforced on SMTP servers to ensure senders can only use their correct email address in the FROM field of outgoing messages. In an email users database each user has a record with an email address. The SMTP server must check if the email address in the FROM field of an outgoing message is the same address that belongs to the user&#x27;s credentials, supplied for SMTP authentication. If the FROM field is forged, an SMTP error will be returned to the email client (e.g. &quot;You do not own the email address you are trying to send from&quot;).

===Strong AUP and TOS agreements===
Most ISPs and webmail providers have either an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) or a Terms of Service (TOS) agreement that discourages spammers from using their system and allows the spammer to be terminated quickly for violations.

==Legal measures==
From 2000 onwards, many countries enacted specific legislation to criminalize spamming, and appropriate legislation and enforcement can have a significant impact on spamming activity. Where legislation provides specific text that bulk emailers must include, this also makes &quot;legitimate&quot; bulk email easier to identify.

Increasingly, anti-spam efforts have led to co-ordination between law enforcement, researchers, major consumer financial service companies and Internet service providers in monitoring and tracking email spam, identity theft and phishing activities and gathering evidence for criminal cases.

Analysis of the sites being spamvertised by a given piece of spam can often be followed up with domain registrars with good results.

==New solutions and ongoing research==
Several approaches have been proposed to improve the email system.

===Cost-based systems===
Since spamming is facilitated by the fact that large volumes of email are very inexpensive to send, one proposed set of solutions would require that senders pay some cost in order to send email, making it prohibitively expensive for spammers. Anti-spam activist Daniel Balsam attempts to make spamming less profitable by bringing lawsuits against spammers.

=== Machine-learning-based systems ===
Artificial intelligence techniques can be deployed for filtering spam emails, such as artificial neural networks algorithms and Bayesian filters. These methods use probabilistic methods to train the networks, such as examination of the concentration or frequency of words seen in the spam versus legitimate email contents.

===Other techniques===

Channel email is a new proposal for sending email that attempts to distribute anti-spam activities by forcing verification (probably using bounce messages so back-scatter does not occur) when the first email is sent for new contacts.

Spam is the subject of several research conferences, including:

<doc id="313738" wikidata="Q1965630" url="?curid=313738" title="Kogiidae">
<text>Kogiidae is a family comprising at least two extant species of Cetacea, the pygmy (&quot;Kogia breviceps)&quot; and dwarf (&quot;K. sima)&quot; sperm whales. As their common names suggest, they somewhat resemble sperm whales, with squared heads and small lower jaws, but are much smaller, with much shorter skulls and more notable dorsal fins than sperm whales. Kogiids are also characterized by a &quot;false gill slit&quot; behind their eyes.

A number of extinct genera have been named.

==Taxonomy==

There is some amount of uncertainty over if Kogiidae belongs in the sperm whale family. Research still suggests a close relationship between Kogiidae and sperm whales using mitochondrial DNA, which supports Kogiidae as part of the sperm whale family. This relationship is supported by similarities of the anatomical structures in the head, responsible for sound production, in particular the presence of a spermaceti organ. Other phylogenetic research raises further questions over a potential relationship between kogiids and Ziphiidae. Other questions exist regarding the high relatedness in mitochondrial DNA between &quot;Platanista&quot; and kogiids. Fossil evidence is limited for this family, which potentially limits an understanding of their relationship to other extant cetaceans.

Researchers have proposed that &quot;K. sima&quot; may represent at least two genetically unique species, and further genetic research is needed to determine the real number of extant species of &quot;Kogiidae&quot;.

==Biology==

Kogiid skulls are characterized by a very short rostrum, the smallest among extant cetaceans, as well as high levels of asymmetry, which is expected among odontocetes. Kogiid skulls have the most blunt mandible among extant cetaceans as well. Extant kogiidae also show relatively high encephalization quotient, the ratio between observed brain size and expected brain size. The pygmy sperm whale has an EQ of 1.78, while the dwarf sperm whale&#x27;s EQ is 1.63. Kogiidae do possess spermaceti in their head like sperm whales. However, kogiid spermaceti is unique as the whales are able to control its temperature. Kogiidae are also homodonts, showing teeth all of the same size and shape.

Kogiidae possess a unique system of organs to produce sound, including a bagpipe-like structure to produce sound and an amplifying horn.

Kogiidae have a modified colon which works as an &quot;ink sac&quot;, storing liquid red feces. They are able to release over three gallons of this fecal &quot;ink&quot; to confuse or discourage predators.

==Ecology==

===Range===

Kogiidae are believed to be cosmopolitan species, inhabiting all oceans except polar waters, remaining between the 50° latitude lines.

Two fossilized species of &quot;Kogia sp.&quot; were shown to exhibit sympatry, similar to the two modern members of &quot;Kogia&quot;, which researchers suggested shows that this behavior has been part of &quot;Kogiidae&quot; for at least 3 million years.

===Behavior and feeding===

Extant kogiids travel in small groups and rarely surface, potentially to avoid predators like orcas.

Kogiidae are deep diving whales, believed to dive up to depths of 500 m. Kogiids feed using a technique known as suction feeding, and their diet primarily consists of squid. Pygmy sperm whales are able to eat larger prey than dwarf sperm whales, although their diet as a whole is relatively similar. They have also been observed using echolocation to find their prey, and their hearing places them in the &quot;Very High Frequency&quot; group of cetaceans that can hear well above 100 kHz.

==Human threats==

Most observations of &quot;Kogia&quot; have come from individuals tangled in fishing line or stranded individuals. There is a commercial fishery for &quot;K. breviceps&quot; in parts of southeast Asia and the Lesser Antilles. Both species of extant &quot;Kogia&quot; have also been observed stranded with plastics blocking their intestines.

<text>The current solar income of the Earth, or any ecoregion of the earth, is the amount of solar energy that falls on it as sunlight. This is thought important in some branches of green economics, as the ultimate measure of renewable energy.

Buckminster Fuller first described the concept in his 1970 paper &quot;Cosmic Costing&quot;, contrasting the photosynthesis on which natural capital and sustainable infrastructural capital depend, with the chemosynthesis of extracting and using fossil fuels.

Paul Hawken is a more recent advocate of the concept, and views it as central to his notion of a restorative economy. It remains a popular notion among those who believe that toxic waste and maintenance problems of direct solar energy devices can ultimately be overcome, or that yields of passive or biological means of gathering and using this energy as biofuels can be made to approximate those of fossil fuels.

<doc id="313741" wikidata="Q249013" url="?curid=313741" title="3D projection">
<text>A 3D projection (or graphical projection) is a design technique used to display a three-dimensional (3D) object on a two-dimensional (2D) surface. These projections rely on visual perspective and aspect analysis to project a complex object for viewing capability on a simpler plane.

3D projections use the primary qualities of an object&#x27;s basic shape to create a map of points, that are then connected to one another to create a visual element. The result is a graphic that contains conceptual properties to interpret the figure or image as not actually flat (2D), but rather, as a solid object (3D) being viewed on a 2D display.

3D objects are largely displayed on two-dimensional mediums (such as paper and computer monitors). As such, graphical projections are a commonly used design element; notably, in engineering drawing, drafting, and computer graphics. Projections can be calculated through employment of mathematical analysis and formulae, or by using various geometric and optical techniques.

==Overview==
Projection is achieved by the use of imaginary &quot;projectors&quot;; the projected, mental image becomes the technician&#x27;s vision of the desired, finished picture. Methods provide a uniform imaging procedure among people trained in technical graphics (mechanical drawing, computer aided design, etc.). By following a method, the technician may produce the envisioned picture on a planar surface such as drawing paper.

There are two graphical projection categories, each with its own method:
*parallel projection
*perspective projection

==Parallel projection==
In parallel projection, the lines of sight from the object to the projection plane are parallel to each other. Thus, lines that are parallel in three-dimensional space remain parallel in the two-dimensional projected image. Parallel projection also corresponds to a perspective projection with an infinite focal length (the distance from a camera&#x27;s lens and focal point), or &quot;zoom&quot;.

Images drawn in parallel projection rely upon the technique of axonometry (&quot;to measure along axes&quot;), as described in Pohlke&#x27;s theorem. In general, the resulting image is &quot;oblique&quot; (the rays are not perpendicular to the image plane); but in special cases the result is &quot;orthographic&quot; (the rays are perpendicular to the image plane). &quot;Axonometry&quot; should not be confused with &quot;axonometric projection&quot;, as in English literature the latter usually refers only to a specific class of pictorials (see below).

===Orthographic projection===
The orthographic projection is derived from the principles of descriptive geometry and is a two-dimensional representation of a three-dimensional object. It is a parallel projection (the lines of projection are parallel both in reality and in the projection plane). It is the projection type of choice for working drawings.

If the normal of the viewing plane (the camera direction) is parallel to one of the primary axes (which is the &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, or &quot;z&quot; axis), the mathematical transformation is as follows;
To project the 3D point formula_1, formula_2, formula_3 onto the 2D point formula_4, formula_5 using an orthographic projection parallel to the y axis (where positive &quot;y&quot; represents forward direction - profile view), the following equations can be used:
:formula_6
:formula_7
where the vector s is an arbitrary scale factor, and c is an arbitrary offset. These constants are optional, and can be used to properly align the viewport. Using matrix multiplication, the equations become:
:formula_8

While orthographically projected images represent the three dimensional nature of the object projected, they do not represent the object as it would be recorded photographically or perceived by a viewer observing it directly. In particular, parallel lengths at all points in an orthographically projected image are of the same scale regardless of whether they are far away or near to the virtual viewer. As a result, lengths are not foreshortened as they would be in a perspective projection.

====Multiview projection====
With &quot;multiview projections&quot;, up to six pictures (called &quot;primary views&quot;) of an object are produced, with each projection plane parallel to one of the coordinate axes of the object. The views are positioned relative to each other according to either of two schemes: &quot;first-angle&quot; or &quot;third-angle&quot; projection. In each, the appearances of views may be thought of as being &quot;projected&quot; onto planes that form a 6-sided box around the object. Although six different sides can be drawn, &quot;usually&quot; three views of a drawing give enough information to make a 3D object. These views are known as &quot;front view&quot;, &quot;top view&quot;, and &quot;end view&quot;. The terms &quot;elevation&quot;, &quot;plan&quot; and &quot;section&quot; are also used.

===Oblique projection===
In &quot;oblique projections&quot; the parallel projection rays are not perpendicular to the viewing plane as with orthographic projection, but strike the projection plane at an angle other than ninety degrees. In both orthographic and oblique projection, parallel lines in space appear parallel on the projected image. Because of its simplicity, oblique projection is used exclusively for pictorial purposes rather than for formal, working drawings. In an oblique pictorial &quot;drawing&quot;, the displayed angles among the axes as well as the foreshortening factors (scale) are arbitrary. The distortion created thereby is usually attenuated by aligning one plane of the imaged object to be parallel with the plane of projection thereby creating a true shape, full-size image of the chosen plane. Special types of oblique projections are:

====Cavalier projection (45°)====
In cavalier projection (sometimes cavalier perspective or high view point) a point of the object is represented by three coordinates, &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; and &quot;z&quot;. On the drawing, it is represented by only two coordinates, &quot;x″&quot; and &quot;y″&quot;. On the flat drawing, two axes, &quot;x&quot; and &quot;z&quot; on the figure, are perpendicular and the length on these axes are drawn with a 1:1 scale; it is thus similar to the dimetric projections, although it is not an axonometric projection, as the third axis, here &quot;y&quot;, is drawn in diagonal, making an arbitrary angle with the &quot;x″&quot; axis, usually 30 or 45°. The length of the third axis is not scaled.

====Cabinet projection====
The term cabinet projection (sometimes cabinet perspective) stems from its use in illustrations by the furniture industry. Like cavalier perspective, one face of the projected object is parallel to the viewing plane, and the third axis is projected as going off in an angle (typically 30° or 45° or arctan(2) = 63.4°). Unlike cavalier projection, where the third axis keeps its length, with cabinet projection the length of the receding lines is cut in half.

====Military projection====
A variant of oblique projection is called &quot;military projection&quot;. In this case, the horizontal sections are isometrically drawn so that the floor plans are not distorted and the verticals are drawn at an angle. The military projection is given by rotation in the &quot;xy&quot;-plane and a vertical translation an amount &quot;z&quot;.

===Axonometric projection===
&quot;Axonometric projections&quot; show an image of an object as viewed from a skew direction in order to reveal all three directions (axes) of space in one picture. Axonometric projections may be either &quot;orthographic&quot; or &quot;oblique&quot;. Axonometric instrument drawings are often used to approximate graphical perspective projections, but there is attendant distortion in the approximation. Because pictorial projections innately contain this distortion, in instrument drawings of pictorials great liberties may then be taken for economy of effort and best effect.

&quot;Axonometric projection&quot; is further subdivided into three categories: &quot;isometric projection&quot;, &quot;dimetric projection&quot;, and &quot;trimetric projection&quot;, depending on the exact angle at which the view deviates from the orthogonal. A typical characteristic of orthographic pictorials is that one axis of space is usually displayed as vertical.

====Isometric projection====
In isometric pictorials (for methods, see Isometric projection), the direction of viewing is such that the three axes of space appear equally foreshortened, and there is a common angle of 120° between them. The distortion caused by foreshortening is uniform, therefore the proportionality of all sides and lengths are preserved, and the axes share a common scale. This enables measurements to be read or taken directly from the drawing.

====Dimetric projection====
In dimetric pictorials (for methods, see Dimetric projection), the direction of viewing is such that two of the three axes of space appear equally foreshortened, of which the attendant scale and angles of presentation are determined according to the angle of viewing; the scale of the third direction (vertical) is determined separately. Approximations are common in dimetric drawings.

====Trimetric projection====
In trimetric pictorials (for methods, see Trimetric projection), the direction of viewing is such that all of the three axes of space appear unequally foreshortened. The scale along each of the three axes and the angles among them are determined separately as dictated by the angle of viewing. Approximations in Trimetric drawings are common.

===Limitations of parallel projection===

Objects drawn with parallel projection do not appear larger or smaller as they extend closer to or away from the viewer. While advantageous for architectural drawings, where measurements must be taken directly from the image, the result is a perceived distortion, since unlike perspective projection, this is not how our eyes or photography normally work. It also can easily result in situations where depth and altitude are difficult to gauge, as is shown in the illustration to the right.

In this isometric drawing, the blue sphere is two units higher than the red one. However, this difference in elevation is not apparent if one covers the right half of the picture, as the boxes (which serve as clues suggesting height) are then obscured.

This visual ambiguity has been exploited in op art, as well as &quot;impossible object&quot; drawings. M. C. Escher&#x27;s &quot;Waterfall&quot; (1961), while not strictly utilizing parallel projection, is a well-known example, in which a channel of water seems to travel unaided along a downward path, only to then paradoxically fall once again as it returns to its source. The water thus appears to disobey the law of conservation of energy. An extreme example is depicted in the film &quot;Inception&quot;, where by a forced perspective trick an immobile stairway changes its connectivity. The video game &quot;Fez&quot; uses tricks of perspective to determine where a player can and cannot move in a puzzle-like fashion.

== Perspective projection ==

Perspective projection or perspective transformation is a projection where three-dimensional objects are projected on a &quot;picture plane&quot;. This has the effect that distant objects appear smaller than nearer objects.

It also means that lines which are parallel in nature (that is, meet at the point at infinity) appear to intersect in the projected image. For example, if railways are pictured with perspective projection, they appear to converge towards a single point, called the vanishing point. Photographic lenses and the human eye work in the same way, therefore the perspective projection looks the most realistic. Perspective projection is usually categorized into &quot;one-point&quot;, &quot;two-point&quot; and &quot;three-point perspective&quot;, depending on the orientation of the projection plane towards the axes of the depicted object.

Graphical projection methods rely on the duality between lines and points, whereby two straight lines determine a point while two points determine a straight line. The orthogonal projection of the eye point onto the picture plane is called the &quot;principal vanishing point&quot; (P.P. in the scheme on the right, from the Italian term &quot;punto principale&quot;, coined during the renaissance).

Two relevant points of a line are:
*its intersection with the picture plane, and
*its vanishing point, found at the intersection between the parallel line from the eye point and the picture plane.

The principal vanishing point is the vanishing point of all horizontal lines perpendicular to the picture plane. The vanishing points of all horizontal lines lie on the horizon line. If, as is often the case, the picture plane is vertical, all vertical lines are drawn vertically, and have no finite vanishing point on the picture plane. Various graphical methods can be easily envisaged for projecting geometrical scenes. For example, lines traced from the eye point at 45° to the picture plane intersect the latter along a circle whose radius is the distance of the eye point from the plane, thus tracing that circle aids the construction of all the vanishing points of 45° lines; in particular, the intersection of that circle with the horizon line consists of two &quot;distance points&quot;. They are useful for drawing chessboard floors which, in turn, serve for locating the base of objects on the scene. In the perspective of a geometric solid on the right, after choosing the principal vanishing point —which determines the horizon line— the 45° vanishing point on the left side of the drawing completes the characterization of the (equally distant) point of view. Two lines are drawn from the orthogonal projection of each vertex, one at 45° and one at 90° to the picture plane. After intersecting the ground line, those lines go toward the distance point (for 45°) or the principal point (for 90°). Their new intersection locates the projection of the map. Natural heights are measured above the ground line and then projected in the same way until they meet the vertical from the map.

While orthographic projection ignores perspective to allow accurate measurements, perspective projection shows distant objects as smaller to provide additional realism.

===Mathematical formula===

The perspective projection requires a more involved definition as compared to orthographic projections. A conceptual aid to understanding the mechanics of this projection is to imagine the 2D projection as though the object(s) are being viewed through a camera viewfinder. The camera&#x27;s position, orientation, and field of view control the behavior of the projection transformation. The following variables are defined to describe this transformation:
* formula_9 – the 3D position of a point &quot;A&quot; that is to be projected.
* formula_10 – the 3D position of a point &quot;C&quot; representing the camera.
* formula_11 – The orientation of the camera (represented by Tait–Bryan angles). 
* formula_12 – the display surface&#x27;s position relative to aforementioned formula_13. 
Most conventions use positive z values (the plane being in front of the pinhole formula_13), however negative z values are physically more correct, but the image will be inverted both horizontally and vertically.
Which results in:
* formula_15 – the 2D projection of formula_16

When formula_17 and formula_18 the 3D vector formula_19 is projected to the 2D vector formula_20.

Otherwise, to compute formula_15 we first define a vector formula_22 as the position of point &quot;A&quot; with respect to a coordinate system defined by the camera, with origin in &quot;C&quot; and rotated by formula_23 with respect to the initial coordinate system. This is achieved by subtracting formula_13 from formula_25 and then applying a rotation by formula_26 to the result. This transformation is often called a , and can be expressed as follows, expressing the rotation in terms of rotations about the &quot;x,&quot; &quot;y,&quot; and &quot;z&quot; axes (these calculations assume that the axes are ordered as a left-handed system of axes):
:formula_27
This representation corresponds to rotating by three Euler angles (more properly, Tait–Bryan angles), using the &quot;xyz&quot; convention, which can be interpreted either as &quot;rotate about the &quot;extrinsic&quot; axes (axes of the &quot;scene&quot;) in the order &quot;z&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;x&quot; (reading right-to-left)&quot; or &quot;rotate about the &quot;intrinsic&quot; axes (axes of the &quot;camera&quot;) in the order &quot;x, y, z&quot; (reading left-to-right)&quot;. If the camera is not rotated (formula_28), then the matrices drop out (as identities), and this reduces to simply a shift: formula_29

Alternatively, without using matrices (let us replace formula_30 with formula_31 and so on, and abbreviate formula_32 to formula_33 and formula_34 to formula_35):
:formula_36
This transformed point can then be projected onto the 2D plane using the formula (here, &quot;x&quot;/&quot;y&quot; is used as the projection plane; literature also may use &quot;x&quot;/&quot;z&quot;):
:formula_37

Or, in matrix form using homogeneous coordinates, the system
:formula_38
in conjunction with an argument using similar triangles, leads to division by the homogeneous coordinate, giving
:formula_39

The distance of the viewer from the display surface, formula_40, directly relates to the field of view, where formula_41 is the viewed angle. (Note: This assumes that you map the points (-1,-1) and (1,1) to the corners of your viewing surface)

The above equations can also be rewritten as:
:formula_42
In which formula_43 is the display size, formula_44 is the recording surface size (CCD or Photographic film), formula_45 is the distance from the recording surface to the entrance pupil (camera center), and formula_46 is the distance, from the 3D point being projected, to the entrance pupil.

Subsequent clipping and scaling operations may be necessary to map the 2D plane onto any particular display media.

=== Weak perspective projection ===

A &quot;weak&quot; perspective projection uses the same principles of an orthographic projection, but requires the scaling factor to be specified, thus ensuring that closer objects appear bigger in the projection, and vice versa. It can be seen as a hybrid between an orthographic and a perspective projection, and described either as a perspective projection with individual point depths formula_47 replaced by an average constant depth formula_48, or simply as an orthographic projection plus a scaling.

The weak-perspective model thus approximates perspective projection while using a simpler model, similar to the pure (unscaled) orthographic perspective.
It is a reasonable approximation when the depth of the object along the line of sight is small compared to the distance from the camera, and the field of view is small. With these conditions, it can be assumed that all points on a 3D object are at the same distance formula_48 from the camera without significant errors in the projection (compared to the full perspective model).

Equation
:formula_50
assuming focal length formula_51.

== Diagram ==

To determine which screen &quot;x&quot;-coordinate corresponds to a point at formula_52 multiply the point coordinates by:
:formula_53
where 
:formula_54 is the screen &quot;x&quot; coordinate
:formula_55 is the model &quot;x&quot; coordinate
:formula_56 is the focal length—the axial distance from the camera center to the image plane
:formula_57 is the subject distance. 
Because the camera is in 3D, the same works for the screen &quot;y&quot;-coordinate, substituting &quot;y&quot; for &quot;x&quot; in the above diagram and equation.

Alternatively, one could use clipping techniques, replacing the variables with values of the point that are out of the FOV-angle and the point inside Camera Matrix.

This technique, also known as &quot;Inverse Camera&quot;, is a Perspective Projection Calculus with known values to calculate the last point on visible angle, projecting from the invisible point, after all needed transformations finished.

<text>Related to 1896 in Afghanistan:
Negotiations are going on between the Indian government and the &quot;amir&quot; tending to the appointment of a joint commission for determining the last of Indo-Afghan frontier yet unsettled, from Landi Kotal in the Khyber to Nawar Kotal on the Kunar River.

Nasrullah Khan is received in a most cordial manner on his return from his visit to England. There are great rejoicings for two or three weeks, but then he gradually drops out of notice. His brother, Habibullah Khan, on the other hand, is immensely popular with everybody, and is in high favour with the &quot;amir&quot;.

* Monarch – Abdur Rahman Khan

==Events==

===Early 1896===
Conclusion of the Kafiristan campaign. The Afghans have captured twenty-five forts at an admitted loss of 1,500 killed and wounded. In some of the valleys, however, the Kafirs still hold out, although many of the chiefs submit to the &quot;amir&quot; at the beginning of February. Soon after hostilities are resumed on the southern and eastern sides of Kafiristan, and nearly all the fertile portions are taken by the Afghan forces. In May the troops are ordered into the more inaccessible northwestern part, so as to complete the subjugation of the country. The &quot;amir&quot; treats the conquered people with leniency. Orders are issued forbidding slave traffic in Kafirs, for it was alleged that after the victories in the Bashgal Valley at the beginning of the year certain captives were reduced to an atrocious form of slavery. The &quot;amir&quot; also gives orders to the Afghan officers to treat the Kafirs kindly, and not seek to convert them by force to Islam.

===Summer 1896===
The &quot;amir&quot; sends a force of militia to occupy the Mittai Valley in Bajaur, where the clans previously received a demand for taxes. The Khan of Nawagai, who rendered excellent service in the Chitral expedition, is alarmed and complains to the government of India. The &quot;amir&quot;, after some hesitation, acknowledges his obligations under the Durand Line Agreement, but at the end of the year the Afghan outpost still remains at Mittai.

===October 1896===
On the Pamir Mountains frontier the transfer of the Darwaz district of Bukhara to the Afghans up to the Amu Darya, as agreed upon between Russia and Britain, is completed. It is stated that Russia is making movements in the direction of Herat, and intends not only to extend the railway from Merv into the Kushk Valley, but also to build a line from Charjui along the Oxus to Karki, close to the Afghan frontier.

===December 1896===
A slight collision takes place between the forces of the Khan of Nawagai, whose territory was threatened by the Afghans at Mittai, and the Khan of Pashat, and the Afghan force moves down the Kunar River about fifteen miles (24 km) from Asmar to protect their communications with Jalalabad, but nothing more serious happens, and the final solution of the frontier question is in a fair way of settlement. The arrangements for the demarcation of the boundary between British Baluchistan and Persia from Koh-i-Malik Siah on the north, to a point near Jalk, are concluded, and pillars are to be set up in the desert marking the frontier.

<text>Rodolphe-Madeleine Cléophas Dareste de La Chavanne (December 25, 1824March 24, 1911) was a French jurist.

Born in Paris, he studied at the École des Chartes and the Faculty of Law of Paris, and starting early on a legal career he rose to be counsellor to the Court of Cassation (1877 to 1900). His first publication was an &quot;Essai sur François Hotman&quot; (1850), completed later by his publication of Hotman&#x27;s correspondence in the &quot;Revue historique&quot; (1876), and he devoted the whole of his leisure to legal history.

==History==

===&quot;We Sell for Less&quot;===
In 1919, Toronto grocers Theodore Pringle Loblaw and J. Milton Cork opened the first Loblaw Groceterias store modelled on a new and radically different retail concept, namely &quot;self serve&quot;. The traditional grocery store provided a high level of personal service but was a labour-intensive operation. Customers typically had to wait while a clerk fetched items from behind a counter. Other goods, such as sugar and flour, had to be individually weighed and the order was then tallied by hand and added to the customer’s account. Home delivery, by wagon, was usually included free of charge. Loblaw and Cork, friends from the days when both worked as young clerks in the Cork family grocery store, believed they could cut costs by introducing self service combined with cash and carry. While cash stores were not new, the idea of allowing customers to select their own merchandise was a new concept. The pair had heard of the Piggly Wiggly &quot;self-serving store&quot; in the United States and travelled to Memphis, Tennessee, to see it in operation first hand. With customers allowed to browse freely, pick up their own goods and then pay cash at a central checkout counter, with no credit or home delivery, operating costs were reduced. The two came away convinced that a similar style of operation could work in Canada. But Loblaw was met with scepticism:
In the early days when I started the cash and carry business, I was told that it could not be done, but my contention was that the people of Toronto and Ontario would welcome the opportunity to carry their groceries home,
providing I could offer them higher qualities at a much lower price than they were used to paying.
The first Loblaw Groceterias Co. store opened at 2923 Dundas St. W., Toronto, in June 1919. Months later, a second location, at 528 College Street, followed. The ’groceterias’ name was apparently derived from cafeteria – a popular self serve restaurant format. Along with the Loblaw name, the outlets featured big &quot;We Sell For Less&quot; signs across their storefronts. Inside, the stores were clean and well lit, with items neatly displayed and clearly marked:
From the entry, one passes through a turnstile which permits egress only. Just inside are piles of market baskets from which the customer helps himself and proceeds in his quest for food at lower prices. Out in front, the shelves are packed with bottled and canned goods, whose names are household words, all plainly tagged with price. Further back, one finds teas, coffee fancy biscuits and cheese, all wrapped ready to carry home ... The customer having selected her purchases, carries her basket to one of the counters near the point of exit. Here her purchases are quickly totaled on an adding machine and she receives her slip. While she pays the bill her groceries are neatly packed in a larger bag..&quot;
While produce was limited and fresh meats largely excluded from the early stores, sales proved strong. Within its first five months of operation, the chain&#x27;s second location had expanded its sales room into that part of the store normally reserved for storage. In spite of the success of the new groceteria format, Cork did not feel that traditional, full-service grocery stores were in danger of going out of business since many customers still valued the extension of credit, individual serve and home delivery. A year later, another Toronto grocer, C.B. Shields, joined with Loblaw and Cork. 
 In addition to being a proponent of self serve, Loblaw was also a firm believer in &quot;the fundamentally sound principle of the chain store system&quot; and its ability to deliver better price and superior quality to through its buying power. Three years after the opening of the first store, there were nine groceterias throughout Toronto. The company had also expanded into the United States with Loblaw Groceterias Inc. outlets in Buffalo, New York.

In 1928, with 69 stores throughout Ontario, the company unveiled its new state-of-the-art head office and warehouse at Fleet and Bathurst streets, along today&#x27;s Lake Shore Blvd, in Toronto. At a cost of million, the Loblaw warehouse was likened to a &quot;temple of commerce&quot; and hailed as a model of efficiency. One newspaper report described it as, &quot;the most modern warehouse building of its kind in the dominion.&quot; The warehouse, which served as a distribution centre and manufacturing depot, included an interior loading dock that could simultaneously accommodate eight railway freight cars and 23 large trucks. It featured its own electric tram railway, four giant ovens for baking a ton of cake and half a ton of cookies a day, huge drums for blending tea, 22 thousand feet of ammonia-filled pipes for refrigeration, and a system of pneumatic tubes for sending messages from department to department. A &quot;punched card&quot; tabulating system, forerunner to today&#x27;s computer, would be installed for tracking inventory as the first of its kind in the Canadian grocery industry. For Loblaw employees, the warehouse included amenities such as bowling lanes and a billiards room, along with an auditorium for putting on plays. That same year, the American company expanded beyond New York State with the opening of outlets in Chicago, Illinois.

===Depression and war===

By October 1929, Loblaw Groceterias&#x27; rapid expansion had attracted the attention of competitor Dominion Stores Limited, another Toronto-based food store chain. In a letter to its shareholders, Dominion management put forward a plan to purchase a controlling interest in Loblaw, funded by a preferred share offering. Weeks later, though, stock markets around the world collapsed and the
proposed acquisition never took place.
In spite of the onset of the Great Depression, Loblaw continued to expand,
albeit at a slower pace. By 1930, the chain boasted of 97 &quot;spotlessly clean
Groceterias&quot; in Ontario. By 1936, that number had grown to 111, but press reports
indicated the company had curtailed further expansion in order to increase
the scope of its product offerings at the chain&#x27;s existing outlets. Meanwhile, the
company made a partial retreat from the U.S. market with the sale of its 77
Loblaw Groceterias Inc. stores in Chicago, Illinois, to the Jewel Tea
Company. The stores had never shown a profit, although they had largely
been turned around by the time of the sale. The company retained its 50
stores in Buffalo, New York, which were profitable operations.

In 1933, company co-founder Theodore Pringle Loblaw died suddenly of complications from minor surgery. Eulogized as &quot;the Merchant Prince&quot; by the press, Loblaw was remembered not only for his accomplishments in business but also his religious conviction and personal philanthropy that benefited local charities such as the Kiwanis Boys Clubs of Toronto and the Stevenson Memorial Hospital of his hometown of Alliston, Ontario. After Loblaw&#x27;s death, co-founder John Milton Cork took charge of the company.

During the early 1930s, Loblaw Groceterias began converting many of its outlets to &quot;Market Stores&quot; that featured full-service meat and produce departments for the first time. Previously excluded because of the chain&#x27;s &#x27;self serve&#x27; format and the need to cut meats and weigh produce, the new departments proved popular with customers. By 1936, over half of all Ontario locations had been converted to the new format that expanded sales &quot;without a corresponding increase in store overhead.&quot; The company also began updating the appearance of its stores to the new, modern, streamlined look. In terms of branding, while the chain often promoted itself as &quot;Loblaw&#x27;s&quot; in newspaper ads, it was not until 1939 that the first &quot;Loblaws&quot; signs went up on store facades – replacing the Loblaw Groceterias Co. Limited signage. In addition to the new meat and produce departments, frozen food sections were also featured – a first in Canada. Loblaw also began introducing other modern amenities such as &quot;electronic eye&quot; automatic doors and mechanical ventilation systems for the comfort of shoppers.

===Post-war expansion===

Store construction, halted during World War II, resumed in the late 1940s as Loblaw undertook a program of &quot;expansion and modernization.&quot; Parking lots, a new phenomenon for the chain, became an important design component of the company&#x27;s &quot;supermarkets&quot; in the post-war era. In particular, Loblaw promoted its new &quot;rear entrance and exit stores,&quot; with checkout counters at the back that allowed shoppers, increasingly motorized and suburban, direct access to their cars. Other modernizations included &quot;healthfully-cool refrigerated&quot; air conditioning, introduced by Loblaw in 1949 – the first Canadian grocery chain to do so. In spite of such innovations, the chain still hearkened back to its retail roots with references to the &quot;self-serve&quot; nature of its fruit, vegetable and meat departments.

===Garfield Weston===

In 1947, a major shift in corporate ownership took place with the purchase of 100,000 Class B shares of Loblaw Groceterias Co. Limited by Canadian industrialist W. Garfield Weston. Weston, president of George Weston Limited, whose interests included baking, grocery wholesaling, and paper manufacturing, acquired the block of voting stock from Loblaw co-founder J. Milton Cork. Although the share purchase did not represent majority control of Loblaw, Weston was able to have his old friend and colleague George C. Metcalf appointed to the board of directors, as well as named vice president and general manager. By 1953, though, Garfield Weston had secured majority control through parent company George Weston Limited and Metcalf was appointed
president of Loblaw Groceterias. With Weston in control, a program of rapid expansion, particularly through acquisition, followed as the company extended its holdings beyond Ontario into other regions of Canada and into the United States.

===Loblaw Companies Limited===
In 1953, Loblaw Groceterias acquired majority control of Loblaw Inc., the former American branch of the company with stores in the State of New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio, through a purchase of stock from George Weston Limited. That same year, Loblaw also bought the Power Supermarkets chain of
Toronto. More noteworthy, though, was its decision to take a 25 per cent stake in Chicago-based National Tea Co., a major supermarket chain with some 750 stores in twelve states, three years later. With an ever-increasing array of retail assets, Loblaw Companies Limited was incorporated in 1956 as holding company for Loblaw Groceterias and the recently acquired holdings south of the border. That same year, Loblaw also announced a major new thrust into Western Canada with 32 supermarkets slated for construction. Other acquisitions followed, including Atlantic Wholesalers in the Maritimes with its associated retail outlets. At its height, Loblaw Companies Limited would represent the third largest grocery retailer in
North America.

As large as Loblaw had grown, food retailing remained highly competitive and special promotions and customer loyalty programs were introduced as a way of attracting and retaining consumers. During the 1950s, car giveaways were a popular highlight of many grand openings of new Loblaws supermarkets. In 1959, the company entered the trading stamp wars with its own Lucky Green Stamps. Loblaw president George Metcalf brought store managers together for an early morning meeting in Toronto to make the surprise announcement, informing them that the
stamps, redeemable for household gifts, had already been delivered to their stores. While at first quite popular, the program was finally concluded in 1967 as customers increasingly saw trading stamps as an expensive promotion that translated into higher prices at the checkout counter.

===Stagnation===

During the 1960s, while Loblaw set record sales, corporate profits declined. An era of aggressive expansion had paid off in terms of revenue growth but apparently at the expense of profitability. As shareholders complained about a lack of information from the company, frustrated analysts, unsure as to the corporate structure or holdings, became increasingly reluctant to recommend the stock. Loblaw annual meetings were better known for their distribution of cookies, cake and groceries than information on operating performance. While George Metcalf remained head of Loblaw Companies Limited, chairman W. Garfield Weston began making changes to senior executive ranks, including the appointment of Leon Weinstein, former head and son of the founders of Power Supermarkets, as president of Loblaw Groceterias Co. Limited from 1968 to 1970. Weinstein soon indicated his intent to &quot;stop giving away baskets of groceries at annual shareholder meetings and try to raise dividends.&quot; To find out what Loblaws shoppers thought about the chain, Weinstein introduced a questionnaire on his personal letterhead, &quot;asking customers to check-off their complaints,&quot; and received 65,000 replies, or three times the number expected.

In spite of attempts to get a handle on operational issues, Loblaws was still perceived as an &quot;ailing supermarket chain.&quot; Meanwhile, pre-tax profits for Loblaw Companies Limited declined from million in 1966 to $18.6 million in 1971, &quot;and then vanished altogether.&quot; By the late 1960s, the company had begun selling assets. Between 1968 and 1974, Loblaw sold $164 million in holdings to corporate parent George Weston Limited in an apparent extension of &quot;financial assistance.&quot; Yet Loblaw continued to make acquisitions. In 1969, it bought a controlling interest in Sayvette, a money-losing Toronto-based discount department store chain and went on to spend $8.7 million to acquire 100 percent ownership. But as competition heated up, losses mounted and stores were closed. The last Sayvette shut its doors in late 1977.

===Reinventing Loblaws===
By the early 1970s, Loblaw was struggling under the weight of too much debt with millions of dollars of financial obligations coming due over the next few years. At the same time, its stores were badly in need of refurbishing and sales were in virtual free fall. Within a year, the company&#x27;s share of the crucial Ontario market had been 
cut in half as a result of price wars among the major chains. South of the border, things looked somewhat better but only on the surface, with many of the company&#x27;s supermarkets in large American inner cities in decline. A
Canadian royal commission study years later noted &quot;the company&#x27;s failure to spend sufficient funds on the refurbishing of its existing supermarkets and the opening of new ones,&quot; in addition to a dividend policy that could not be justified on the basis of earnings. Loblaw also found itself constrained by various financial arrangements. In particular, so-called &quot;lease and leaseback&quot; agreements effectively
prevented it from closing many of its smaller, money-losing outlets. To make matters worse, senior management was often reluctant or intransigent when it came to making operational changes. Faced with the possible bankruptcy of Loblaws, Garfield Weston asked his youngest son, W. Galen Weston, a successful entrepreneur and retailer in his own right, to take a close look at the chain to see if it could be saved. In February 1972, Galen
Weston was appointed chief executive officer of Loblaw Companies Limited. With financing secured through a family holding company that freed Loblaw from its leaseback agreements, Weston began rationalizing operations, shutting down dozens of unprofitable stores while remodelling those that remained. &quot;As a 200 store chain, we didn&#x27;t look very good. As a 100 store chain, we looked very good indeed.&quot; In addition to dozens of store closures, warehouse operations were consolidated and new distribution centres built.

In 1973, Galen Weston brought in Toronto designer Don Watt. Known for his innovative product packaging and use of photography, Watt proposed a complete makeover of Loblaw&#x27;s corporate image and retail space. Although Watt had little experience in supermarket design, Weston gave him the go ahead to remodel one of the stores. Weston reportedly told Watt that, &quot;Loblaws is in such trouble that if it doesn’t work, it doesn&#x27;t matter. If it works – good.&quot; On a budget of only $30,000, the renovations took place at night so the store could stay open during the day. Along with a complete redesign inside and out, that included new colours and a new repeating &#x27;L&#x27; Loblaws logo, Watt made changes to traditional grocery store layout. He doubled the floor space of the produce department and moved it from the back of the store to the front. He also introduced new design elements such as moveable bins and huge photo enlargements of fresh fruits, vegetables and meats to graphically convey quality and freshness. Wood panelling covered over old walls and broken mirrors to give the interior a fresh, contemporary feel. Within the first few months of the remodelling, sales increased 60 percent.

Meanwhile, on the promotional side, a new advertising campaign was rolled out which featured Canadian actor William Shatner of &quot;Star Trek&quot; fame. TV viewers were told that, &quot;More than the price is right...but by
gosh, the price is right.&quot; Other changes involved the introduction of basic managerial techniques, such as profit and loss statements at the store level. But as the company slowly regained market share in Ontario, it began bleeding red ink when it came to its U.S. operations and in particular its National supermarket chain. The company initiated a similar program of rationalization and renewal which saw hundreds of stores closed and others remodelled. In 1976, Loblaw suspended the dividend on both its Class A and B shares as management cited &quot;anticipated large extraordinary losses&quot; by year’s end. The company also sold its Chicago Division of
National supermarkets, purchased by A&amp;P, after continued losses. In
Canada, Nabob Foods Limited was also sold off. Meanwhile, parent George Weston Limited injected an additional $29 million into Loblaw through a purchase of treasury shares. By the end of the decade, through rationalization of both its retail stores
and various businesses, Loblaw Companies Limited, as well as George Weston Limited, had returned to profitability. One Canadian business magazine described what W. Galen Weston and team had pulled off as a classic turnaround
saga:
After 10 years of ruthless, painful reorganization, which involved divestitures, acquisitions and massive store closings, he and his team have transformed the Weston-Loblaw group into a lean, profitable, progressive,
rational, superbly managed company – a winner and a world leader in what is still a perilous, savagely competitive business.
By 2019, the company&#x27;s strategy to increase on-line sales of groceries was well established. (Loblaw stores were offering either delivery or customer pickup of orders placed on-line.) In spite of the limited sales in this category, about 10% of the market for all retailers, the company continued to move forward with the concept. &quot;I see online being more relevant and more important to customers going forward. That’s why we’re focused on it&quot;, said Greg Ramier president of the market division at Loblaw Cos., in an interview by the Toronto Star. 

===No Name and No Frills===
Loblaw also moved to rejuvenate its own private label program by allocating millions of dollars to the development of in-store brands. In 1978, the company joined the &quot;generics&quot; movement with the introduction of 16 &quot;No Name&quot; items, marketed in simple black and yellow packaging. The new line was heavily promoted with advertised savings of between 10 and 40 percent. At a time of high inflation and consumer complaints about ever increasing food prices, No Name proved popular, with sales exceeding the company&#x27;s own projections, as noted by Loblaws president Dave Nichol:
Since Loblaws introduced its 16 no-name products, it has sold one million units with many repeat purchases. &quot;The suppliers of a number of these products can&#x27;t keep up with the demand. In several cases, we&#x27;ve sold in two and a half weeks what we originally estimated would be our annual requirements.

When one competing food industry executive was critical of Nichol, noting the irony of heavily advertising No Name when generics typically went unadvertised to hold down costs, Nichol pointed out that Loblaw had not increased its promotional budget but simply redirected its advertising dollars towards the new line. A year later, the number of No Name products had increased to a hundred different items and represented five percent of Loblaws sales.

Within months of the No Name launch, Loblaw opened a prototype No Frills store in East York. Also known as a &#x27;box store,&#x27; since items were not individually shelved but left in their cardboard shipping cartons, usually with the front cut away, the new store advertised &quot;the lowest overall prices in Toronto.&quot; Though customers had to pack their own groceries, bring their own bags or pay three cents apiece, and contend with a limited selection of only 500 items, shoppers crowded the store on opening day. Customers gave up other standard conveniences, such as full-service meat or dairy departments, since
refrigeration units had been removed to cut costs. In spite of the limited selection and minimal service, the first No Frills store proved a success and within months the company converted two more Loblaws locations to the new deep discount format.

===President&#x27;s Choice===
{{main|President&#x27;s Choice}}
While the original No Name line-up was promoted as basic, everyday items at considerable savings, Dave Nichol eventually began experimenting with the product line-up by adding more upscale items. Products such as Gourmet Barbecue Sauce, Escargot and imported jams began appearing in the familiar yellow and black generic packaging. When President’s Blend Gourmet Coffee was launched in time for Christmas 1983, it was soon outselling every other grocery item on Loblaws shelves. Nichol concluded that consumers wanted to go up-market and the decision was made to develop an entire line of upscale products under its own private label brand.

Modelled on the Marks &amp; Spencer St. Michael in-house brand, and touted as being equal to or better in quality than competing national brands at less money, President’s Choice was personally endorsed by Nichol as president of Loblaw Supermarkets.

The introduction of the premium line also coincided with the advent of an advertising flyer entitled &quot;Dave Nichol’s Insider’s Report.&quot; Based on a California supermarket flyer called &quot;Trader Joe’s Insider’s Report,&quot; and referred to as &quot;a mix of Mad magazine and Consumer Reports, zaniness and food tips, wrapped up in a comic book format,&quot; the insert proved popular with Ontario households. The flyer also became an important advertising vehicle for President’s Choice, which it came to exclusively promote. One of Nichol&#x27;s early product development successes was President’s Choice The Decadent Chocolate Chip Cookie, which took over a year to develop. Nichol and his team insisted on the use of real butter and twice as much chocolate per cookie as the leading national brand. Although The Decadent was sold in only 17 percent of Canadian supermarkets, compared to 98 percent for Nabisco&#x27;s Chips Ahoy!, &quot;it fast became Canada&#x27;s best selling cookie.&quot;

=== Superstore and Liquorstore ===

{{main|Real Canadian Superstore|Real Atlantic Superstore|Real Canadian Liquorstore}}

The 1980s saw further innovation with regard to store formats. In Western Canada, &quot;Westfair Foods&quot;, a Loblaw subsidiary, unveiled its first &quot;superstore&quot; in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, in 1979. Opened under the &quot;SuperValu&quot; banner, it was later renamed the &quot;Real Canadian Superstore&quot;. Modelled after the European hypermarket, the &quot;combination store&quot; included a large selection of general merchandise, along with a full supermarket component.{{citation needed|date=November 2022}}

Touted as a &quot;one-stop shopping&quot; destination, the new superstore carried some 30,000 SKUs (stock-keeping units), which expanded to 40,000 over the next decade. The new format not only provided economies of scale and permitted lower retail prices, but also meant that management could build stores on its own terms, rather than be
dependent on shopping mall construction. Sudbury, Ontario saw the first Superstore format in 1981 coinciding with the opening of the Sudbury Supermall.{{citation needed|date=November 2022}}

In 1985, with nine Real Canadian Superstores across Western Canada, Loblaw tried to duplicate their success in Eastern Canada with the opening of its first combination store at Pickering, Ontario. Eventually, 13 superstores, four times the size of a conventional supermarket with about a third of the space devoted to general merchandise, were opened in Ontario and the Maritimes. Sales, however, lagged. By 1988, with corporate profits almost cut in half, the company downsized eight of the operations, in some cases changing store banners and leasing out the redundant space to other retailers. &quot;Had Loblaw Companies not owned the real estate, the conversion and sub-leasing penalties might have proven prohibitive.&quot;

===Expansion===
By the mid-1980s, Loblaw Companies Limited had become Canada&#x27;s largest supermarket retailer. Much of that success could be attributed to the effectiveness of the company&#x27;s &quot;control label&quot; or private label program. In the case of President&#x27;s Choice, a key management strategy had been to create a line of products available nowhere else but Loblaw stores.{{citation needed |date=November 2022}}

The company also began extending the brand&#x27;s market beyond Canada, making international inroads and in particular into the highly competitive American market. By the early 1990s, not only were PC products increasingly available at select U.S. regional supermarket chains, Loblaw was supplying retail giant Wal-Mart, marketing President&#x27;s Choice products under the brand Sam&#x27;s American Choice, later shortened to Sam&#x27;s Choice, named after company founder Sam Walton. All indications were that Loblaw&#x27;s control label program was starting to pay off south of the border:
President&#x27;s Choice, the upscale private label at Loblaw&#x27;s supermarkets, has been a resounding success in the United States – and has fired a rebellion of consumers and retailers against highly advertised, and therefore pricey, national brands. Its products have found their way into more than 1,200 stores in 34 states. The biggest deal is with Wal-Mart, which had $73 billion in sales in 1993. Dave Nichol, the man behind President&#x27;s Choice, reports that Wal-Mart&#x27;s volume on Sam&#x27;s American Choice and Great Value lines, also developed by Loblaw&#x27;s, was up 300 percent last year.
Meantime, though, Wal-Mart had announced what media reports likened to an &quot;invasion of Canada,&quot; namely the acquisition of 120 Woolco stores across the country. Though Wal-mart was barred from selling the private-label line developed by Loblaw in Canada, the two retailers eventually parted company as they increasingly became competitors in the Canadian marketplace.{{citation needed |date=November 2022}}

In November 1993, it was announced that Dave Nichol, who for the past decade had been so closely associated with President&#x27;s Choice in terms of promotion and product development, was leaving his senior executive post to become a private label consultant. Initially, both he and Loblaw expressed the desire to continue working together, with Nichol remaining on in the role of PC spokesman. But as Nichol moved forward with plans to develop his own Dave Nichol brand of private label products with Cott Corporation of Toronto, presumably in competition with President&#x27;s Choice, the relationship deteriorated. Nichol hosted a couple more issues of Dave Nichol&#x27;s Insider&#x27;s Report but then vanished from the cover. The November 1994 edition dropped his name to become simply The Insider&#x27;s Report. While media coverage of the Nichol/Loblaw split had been extensive, it seemingly had little or no negative impact on brand equity. News reports later indicated that Loblaw, post-Nichol, was experiencing stronger-than-ever corporate earnings.

As Loblaw expanded operations in Canada under an array of regional and market segment store banners, by the mid-1990s it divested the last of its retail holdings south of the border with the sale of National supermarkets in St. Louis and New Orleans. At the time, Loblaw president Richard Currie reiterated the company&#x27;s objective to move strategically, which included exiting markets if capital could be better deployed elsewhere. He further stated the company&#x27;s intent to enter the Quebec market. In 1998, it did so with the purchase of Provigo, the Quebec-based supermarket chain with close to 250 outlets. In order to comply with Competition Bureau concerns, Loblaw sold 47 Loeb stores in Ontario, acquired through the Provigo deal, to Metro-Richelieu and agreed to divest stores in eight other markets.{{citation needed |date=November 2022}} The Provigo acquisition meant that Loblaw had become the leading food retailer in Quebec, with Metro a close second.{{citation needed |date=November 2022}} That same year, Loblaw also made another regional acquisition with the purchase of the 80-store Agora chain in Atlantic Canada.{{citation needed |date=November 2022}} While other food chains, such as the Oshawa Group, struggled to turn a profit, Loblaw kept adding more stores and more square footage through acquisition and new construction:
Loblaw president Richard Currie laughs at the notion that Canada has too many grocery stores. There&#x27;s a lot of floor space, he allows, but never enough in the large, modern, well-equipped, one-stop shopping supermarkets that some Canadians like. Loblaw keeps expanding its fleet of 900 stores, adding about 10 percent to its floor space and sales each year, while increasing its profit margin. 
In 1998, Loblaw become the first Canadian food retailer to extend its product mix into the realm of banking with the launch of &quot;President&#x27;s Choice Financial.&quot; Promoted as a very basic no-hassle, no-fee form of personal banking, conveniently located where you do your grocery shopping, PC Financial kiosks and automatic tellers began springing-up in supermarkets across the country. While Loblaw provided the branding, the service-end was made possible through a partnership with the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. Loblaw also promised a new loyalty program that would allow customers to redeem &#x27;points&#x27; for free groceries – which later became &quot;PC Points.&quot; Within a year, Loblaw would have more than a hundred President&#x27;s Choice Financial kiosks and bank machines.

===Management shakeup===

After almost 25 years at the helm of Loblaw Companies Limited, Richard J. Currie retired as company president in November 2000. John Lederer, a veteran Loblaw executive, took over the top job. As president, Lederer moved forward with a number of strategic initiatives. Administrative functions were consolidated as a new corporate headquarters was unveiled in Brampton, Ontario. Warehouse operations were streamlined with the opening of new distribution centres as the company updated facilities and information technology. And, once again, Loblaw made an effort to offer more general merchandise in its stores in the hope of becoming more of a &#x27;one-stop&#x27; shopping destination for consumers – all moves presumably designed to combat the threat posed by a &quot;looming Wal-Mart incursion&quot; as the retail giant announced the opening of more Supercentres in Canada. But as supply chain problems took root, customers began to complain of empty Loblaw shelves and out-of-stock items, while suppliers expressed their frustration coordinating deliveries to distribution centres. Unsold general merchandise began piling up in warehouses. Meantime, key staff, such as company buyers, had quit rather than relocate to the new corporate headquarters. Loblaw began losing money, quarter after quarter, and by the end of fiscal 2005, the company had recorded its first year-end loss in almost twenty years. In September 2006, John Lederer resigned as president of Loblaw Companies Limited and W.
Galen Weston stepped down as chairman of the board. Weston&#x27;s son, Galen G. Weston, was appointed executive chairman, while former Canadian Tire retail head Mark Foote became president and Allan Leighton, a prominent UK executive and longtime advisor to the senior Weston, took on the job of deputy chairman. Dalton Philips was later named Loblaw&#x27;s chief operating officer. Reaction to the management shakeup was mixed, with Richard Currie critical of the move, saying it was unnecessary, while Dave Nichol expressed his personal frustration that it took five quarters of declining earnings before action was finally taken.

With the new management team in place, Loblaw completed a 100-day consultation in which senior executives met with store managers and employees to hear their concerns and complaints. Weston subsequently introduced a &quot;simplify, innovate and grow&quot; strategy designed to &quot;fix the basics&quot; by refocusing the company’s attention on food retailing.{{citation needed |date=November 2022}} He also publicly declared that it would take at least three years to turn operations around as the company continued to work out kinks in its supply chain and upgrade computer systems.{{citation needed |date=November 2022}} By the end of 2007, Loblaw had returned to profitability.{{citation needed |date=November 2022}}

Since the departure of Dave Nichol a decade and a half before, Loblaw had been without a spokesman to pitch its brands and supermarkets. In 2007, in a major shift on the promotional side, executive chairman Galen Weston became the new public face of the company and in particular, its in-store private label products. With the 2008 financial crisis and recession, Loblaw began to heavily promote not only President&#x27;s Choice but also its generic No Name products as an economical alternative to higher-priced national brands. In a television commercial reminiscent of Nichol from the 1980s, Weston presented two shopping carts, one filled with No Name items and the other with comparable national brands to show how consumers might save on their grocery bills.

On April 18, 2023, Loblaw announced that Galen Weston will be stepping back from the day-to-day activities as president and CEO. Per Bank, who has led Denmark&#x27;s largest retailer, Sailing Group, for over a decade has been named the successor and will join the company in early 2024. Galen Weston will remain chairman of Loblaw and CEO of holding company George Weston Ltd.

In early 2024, new CEO Per Bank announced new changes to the company&#x27;s divisional operating structure, including the newly created hard discount division, encompassing NOFRILLS and Maxi - with the Real Canadian Superstore banner joining the Market Division.

===Joe Fresh===
{{Main|Joe Fresh}}

In 2006, Loblaw and Canadian fashion designer Joe Mimran teamed up to launch &quot;Joe Fresh&quot; a line of low-cost clothing from contracted suppliers in Asia.{{citation needed |date=November 2022}} Promoted as chic but highly affordable clothing, the new line is sold in supermarket and superstore aisles. Joe Fresh sales soon exceeded the company&#x27;s own projections and Loblaw began expanding into children&#x27;s wear, shoes, lingerie, beauty and bath products. In 2010, the first standalone store opened in Vancouver and Loblaw announced plans for 20 outlets across Canada.{{citation needed |date=November 2022}}

Loblaw unveiled a number of Joe Fresh permanent and pop-up stores in New York City and the surrounding region in what one Loblaw executive described as &quot;very much a pilot project.&quot; But Mimran, the former co-founder of Club Monaco, spoke less cautiously, envisioning 800 Joe Fresh stores across the United States within five years, with Asia and Europe the next logical international markets to take the brand.

===Environment===

Under Weston, Loblaw refocused its efforts in the area of corporate social responsibility, and in particularly on the environment, in issuing annual CSR reports. A line of more environmentally friendly GREEN products was launched (considered by many environmentalists and concerned consumers to be examples of greenwashing). Weston appeared in TV commercials to promote &quot;Canada&#x27;s greenest shopping bag,&quot; a reusable grocery bag made of 85 percent post-consumer recycled plastic, designed to reduce the number of disposable bags that ended up in landfill sites by one billion a year.{{citation needed |date=November 2022}} Loblaw also unveiled one energy-efficient, low emissions environmental flagship store in Scarborough, Ontario, and became the first Canadian supermarket chain to install a wind turbine to supply renewable electricity to one of its stores.{{citation needed |date=November 2022}}

In November 2008, Greenpeace alleged that Loblaw was selling 14 out of 15 fish species on that organization&#x27;s &quot;redlist&quot; of those considered to be the most destructively farmed, and staged protests at some Toronto-area locations. The company denied the allegations, while the accuracy of the redlist itself has been challenged by U.S. government regulators and by the fish industry. Loblaw has since committed to sourcing all of its seafood from sustainable sources by 2013, and now features several Marine Stewardship Council-certified products under its President&#x27;s Choice product line. Greenpeace&#x27;s ratings of Loblaw&#x27;s seafood initiatives have improved over the years and are now above all other national retailers (and second-highest of all retailers ranked), but were still classified as a failing grade in its 2010 report, based on an absence of labelling indicating where or how seafood is fished or farmed, and continued sale of some redlist species.

===T&amp;T and Black Label===

In July 2009, Loblaw extended its presence in the ethnic retail market with its announced purchase of T&amp;T Supermarket Inc., Canada&#x27;s largest chain of Asian food stores, for some {{CAD|225 million}} – 191 million in cash and the rest in preferred shares. Founded in 1993, the 17-store chain, with outlets in British Columbia, Alberta and Ontario, recorded more than $500 million in annual sales. T&amp;T CEO Cindy Lee noted that some of the supermarket&#x27;s customers already referred to it as the &quot;Asian Loblaws.&quot;

Loblaw rented a Toronto avant garde art gallery as backdrop to the launch of its new &quot;Black Label&quot; line of gourmet food products. The luxury grocery items, marketed under the President&#x27;s Choice brand, were showcased via a celebrity chef by-invitation-only dinner party. Promoted as &quot;affordable indulgences,&quot; the products range in price from $1.99 to $24.99. &quot;From the smoky bacon marmalade, to the crumbly eight year old cheddar, to the cherry shiraz fruit jelly,&quot; the eclectic line-up is designed to compete with specialty stores.{{citation needed |date=November 2022}} Though dubbed &quot;PC Black Label,&quot; the brand name does not actually appear on any of the items, with its largely black and white packaging and photography the primary clue to the product line&#x27;s identity:
&quot;It goes back to our first successful controlled brand product in a yellow and black package with No Name on it. It wasn’t until six years later that we actually put &quot;No Name&quot; on the packaging,&quot; Ian Gordon, vice president at Loblaw Brands Limited, explained.{{citation needed |date=November 2022}}
Loblaw has published its own book of recipes. &quot;The Epicurean&#x27;s Companion&quot; lists an eclectic assortment of dishes prepared using Black Label products including Cheddar Bacon Marmalade Toast and Porcini Glazed Mushrooms with Pancetta.

===Maple Leaf Gardens===
{{main|Maple Leaf Gardens}}
In 2004, Loblaw Companies purchased Maple Leaf Gardens, a former hockey arena in Toronto. In 2009, the company announced a {{CAD|60 million}} project, in which it would partner with Ryerson University to construct a flagship Loblaws store at its ground level, as well as a multi-purpose athletics complex (the Mattamy Athletic Centre) for Ryerson in its upper levels, featuring volleyball and basketball courts, and a full-sized hockey rink. These plans had been delayed due to financial concerns, criticism over the purchase by residents, and conditions imposed by MLSE forbidding the purchaser from unduly using the building as a competing sports venue.

The location, Loblaws at Maple Leaf Gardens, opened on November 30, 2011; the 85,000 square-foot store features many historical and architectural features of the old Gardens, including the spot where centre ice once stood. It also features artwork honouring notable events and concerts held at the arena, including murals and a blue maple leaf sculpture (in honour of the Toronto Maple Leafs) constructed from its seating. The store also includes an LCBO location, and a Joe Fresh store. Loblaw executive chairman Galen Weston explained that the store was designed to &quot;[reimagine] the urban supermarket&quot;.

=== Choice Properties ===
{{Main|Choice Properties REIT}}
In December 2012, Loblaw announced that it would spin off most of its real estate properties into a new publicly listed real estate investment trust. The move would allow Loblaw to monetize the value of its real estate holdings, invest in its grocery business, by reducing taxes through tax advantages of the REIT structure.{{citation needed |date=November 2022}} Loblaw shares increased 24% on the news. On July 5, 2013, the new REIT, Choice Properties REIT, held a {{CAD|400}} million IPO. Loblaw retained majority ownership in the new company.

In February 2018, Choice announced that it would acquire Canadian Real Estate Investment Trust (CREIT), a diversified commercial REIT, for {{CAD|3.9 billion}}.

===Shoppers Drug Mart and Pharmaprix===
{{Main|Shoppers Drug Mart|Pharmaprix}}

On July 15, 2013, Loblaw announced that it would acquire Canada&#x27;s largest pharmacy chain, Shoppers Drug Mart (branded &quot;Pharmaprix&quot; in the Province of Quebec), for {{CAD|12.4 billion|link=yes}} in a cash and stock deal. Galen G. Weston indicated the possibility for store brands from the two chains to appear in each other&#x27;s stores following the merger, and that the merger would give Loblaw greater buying power for health and wellness products. The merger received approval by both shareholders and the Competition Bureau, allowing Loblaw to close the deal on March 28, 2014. Shoppers Drug Mart and its administration will continue to work as a separate operating division of Loblaw Companies Limited.

Following the purchase, the Shoppers Drug Mart loyalty program Optimum was merged with Loblaw&#x27;s PC Plus program to form PC Optimum.

==Banners==
Loblaw operates under many banners throughout Canada, so as to appeal to different niches but also to present the illusion of greater competition. While most of these banners are not likely to be abandoned in the near future, during much of the 2000s, the company focused on developing the large-format Real Canadian Superstore banner, which is gradually replacing some Loblaws and Zehrs locations in Ontario, as a national rival to Walmart Canada.{{citation needed |date=November 2022}}

Additionally, as part of a 2006 agreement with unionized employees in Ontario, Loblaw announced that it would introduce a new food-centred supermarket format (originally called the &quot;Great Canadian Food Store&quot;) for locations not converted to the Superstore format. This format has since opened under the name &quot;Loblaw Great Food&quot;. In total, 44 existing Ontario stores were planned to be converted to either the Superstore or Great Food format between 2006 and 2010, in addition to new construction and existing Superstores.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

===Petroleum===
Loblaw used to operate gas stations co-located with 213 of its stores, under brands such as &quot;Gas Bar&quot;, &quot;At The Pumps&quot;, &quot;À pleins gaz&quot;, and &quot;Refuel&quot;. In 2017, Loblaw announced that it had sold these operations to Brookfield Business Partners for $540 million. The stations were subsequently rebranded as Mobil.

==Corporate governance==
The current members of the Board of Directors of Loblaw Companies Limited are: Galen Weston Jr. (Executive Chairman), Stephen E. Bachand, Paul M. Beeston, Gordon A. M. Currie, Anthony S. Fell, Christiane Germain, Anthony R. Graham, John S. Lacey, Nancy H. O. Lockhart, Thomas C. O&#x27;Neil, and John D. Wetmore.

== Controversies ==
In April 2019, it was reported that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau gave Loblaws a federal grant of $12 million Canadian dollars for new refrigeration units in their stores in order to agree to spending $36 million on upgrading their refrigerators to a more environmentally friendly model. Both Trudeau and the Canadian Environment Minister Catherine McKenna in April 2019 were criticized for allowing $12 million taxpayer dollars to go to the second richest family in Canada for new refrigerator installations. Joanne Dobson, and Meredith Logan, two of Loblaws top lobbyists, donated thousands of dollars to the Liberal Party of Canada, and hosted fundraising events for the Liberals and Trudeau family.

In January 2018, Loblaws was implicated in price-fixing the cost of bread in Canada, taking part from 2001 until 2015. The company admitted its involvement in the scheme. In response to the price-fixing, in January 2018, all consumers were offered the chance to receive a $25 gift card for bread. Previously, the company had estimated between 3 and 5 million Canadians would sign up. There was some criticism for the Loblaws policy of requiring an ID for the gift cards, which was investigated by the privacy commissioner of Canada and resulted in protests. Loblaws and George Weston Limited agreed to pay $500 million to settle the lawsuit in July 2024, with the class action lawsuit against several other retailers continuing.

Also in 2018, Loblaws was ordered to pay back taxes of $368 million in relation to a banking subsidiary in the Caribbean. It involved a Loblaws Inc. subsidiary in Barbados that had been renamed Glenhuron Bank. Loblaws had net earnings of around $800 million in 2018, and profits of $3 billion.

In August 2019, the Supreme Court of Canada decided that Loblaws could not be held responsible for the Rana Plaza textile factory disaster which killed 1,130 people and seriously injured 2,520 others in Dhaka, Bangladesh. At the time, the garment factory was under an arm&#x27;s length contract to manufacture items for Loblaws&#x27; Joe Fresh brand.

In January 2020, it was reported that 800 employees were being laid off in Quebec and Ontario in 2021 when Loblaws switched to automated distribution at two of its major facilities. In May 2020, the franchise stated it would re-open service counters in the near future, after being closed for the COVID-19 pandemic. The company hiked employee pay in March 2020 for the coronavirus pandemic, upping wages by $2 per hour. The union Unifor criticized Loblaws for removing the pandemic pay bump in June 2020. Despite revenue growth, in July 2020, Loblaws reported that profits were down due to expenditures related to the pandemic. Starting September 1, 2020, it was announced that Loblaws and its associated company Shoppers Drug Mart were offering asymptomatic testing for COVID-19 at all their pharmacies.

In March 2023, Galen Weston Jr. along with the CEOs of Metro Inc. and Empire Co. was summoned to testify before a House of Commons committee as part of an ongoing study on food price inflation. He informed lawmakers that the grocery chain earned $2.66 billion Canadian dollars before taxes in the previous year, at a pre-tax margin of 4.7%; up slightly from 4.6% a year earlier. Lawmakers were told that the higher margins came from pharmacy, cosmetic and apparel sales, while overall sales have benefitted from consumers shifting spending away from restaurants toward groceries.

In January 2025, a CBC News investigation found that Loblaws had illegally sold underweighed meat by including the weight of packaging in 80 stores for an unknown period before ending the practice in December 2023. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency alerted Loblaws and did not issue a fine because the practice was ended. CBC News found that underweighing still occurred at two Loblaws-operated stores in late 2024.

===May 2024 boycott===

On May 1, 2024, Canadian shoppers began a boycott against Loblaw along with its companies and supermarkets. Organized by Reddit community r/loblawsisoutofcontrol, which was created by Milton, Ontario, mental health worker Emily Johnson in late 2023, the boycott was organized amidst accusations against Loblaw of engaging in corporate greed practices such as greedflation and price gouging, due to the corporation recording major profits whilst heavily increasing their grocery prices. A Dalhousie University study in late 2022 for example found that Loblaw, along with Canada&#x27;s two other largest grocers, Metro and Sobeys, had all reported yearly profits that were &quot;above average&quot; compared to their five-year averages. Critics argued that these companies were &quot;profiteering at a time when food prices are rising at the fastest rate in more than 40 years.&quot; The study highlighted Loblaw&#x27;s profits for outperforming both their past-five-year average and individual year performances.

The boycott encouraged Canadian consumers to seek locally-owned alternatives to Loblaws-owned grocery stores, such as small businesses. The aim of the boycott was to pressure Loblaw into making a 15% reduction on their grocery prices, and signing Canada&#x27;s Grocery Code of Conduct, a proposed process created by Agriculture and Food ministers throughout Canada to “address the concerns of processors, producers and independent grocers regarding increased retailer fees on suppliers and the need for balance in the supplier-retailer relationship, while also ensuring that Canadians continue to have access to a reliable food supply at affordable prices.” Loblaw, as well as Walmart, have both previously refused to sign onto the code of conduct.

On the same day marking the start of the boycott, Loblaw reported {{CAD|459 million}} in profits out of {{CAD|13.58 billion}} in revenue during the first quarter of 2024, a 9.8% increase in profits and a 4.5 percent increase in revenue from last year. Around the beginning of the boycott, Loblaw made attempts to contact those involved with organizing it. On May 3, 2024, Johnson had a meeting with Per Bank, the CEO and president of Loblaw, sharing &quot;shoppers&#x27; concerns and questions&quot; with him. The boycott calls additionally caught the attention of Loblaw Chairman Galen Weston Jr., who considered it to be &quot;misguided criticism&quot; and added that given their significance in Canada&#x27;s grocery market, &quot;it is natural that Loblaw would be singled out as a focal point for media and government and of course consumer frustrations.” Weston denied Loblaw&#x27;s alleged responsibility in the rising costs of groceries, adding that &quot;inflation is a global issue and is not specific to our company or to our industry.&quot; According to a poll conducted between May 17 and 19, 58% of Canadians supported the boycott, and 18% of Canadians or members of their household were participating in it.

<doc id="313751" wikidata="Q957503" url="?curid=313751" title="Philippe de Rémi (died 1296)">
<text>Philippe de Rémi or Philippe de Beaumanoir (c. 1247–1296), contemporarily &quot;Phelippes de Beaumanoir&quot;, was a French jurist and royal official. He was a junior son of Philippe de Rémi (d. 1265), poet and bailli of the Gâtinais, who was renowned for his 20,000 verses of poetry, including &quot;La Manekine&quot;, &quot;Jehan et Blonde&quot;, and a &quot;salut d&#x27;amour&quot;.

After studying law in Orléans and perhaps Bologna, Philippe became bailli of Clermont in the county of Beauvaisis (1279), then seneschal of Poitou (1284) and the Saintonge (1287). Afterwards, he came to hold some of the most senior administrative offices in the realm: bailli of the Vermandois (1289), the Touraine (1291), and Senlis (1292).

His administrative experience formed the basis of his principal work, the &quot;Coustumes de Beauvoisis&quot; of 1283, which was first printed in 1690. Even though barely noticed in its own time, it was later regarded as one of the best works bearing on old French customary law, and was frequently referred to with high admiration by Montesquieu, who called him &quot;la lumière de son temps&quot; (&quot;the light of his time&quot;).

<text>Chachoengsao (, ) is one of Thailand&#x27;s seventy-six provinces (&quot;changwat&quot;), located in eastern Thailand.

==History==
&quot;Chachoengsao&quot; or &quot;Paet Rio&quot; (&#x27;eight stripes&#x27;) is a province in eastern Thailand. It has a history dating back to the reign of King Borommatrailokkanat in the mid-Ayutthaya period. People originally settled by the Bang Pakong River and along canals. Chachoengsao, Paet Rio, has a history dating back to the reign of King Borommatrailokkanat in the Ayutthaya period. Most people have settled by the Bang Pakong River and along canals. &quot;Luangpho Phuttha Sothon&quot; is a centre of faith of the people of Paet Rio. In the past, Chachoengsao was a fourth class city under the ministry of defence. During the reign of King Rama I, it was attached to the ministry of the interior. During the reign of King Rama V, who changed the administration system, Chachoengsao became a city in the Prachin Buri Circle. In 1916, its status was changed from a city to a province. &quot;Chachoengsao&quot; is a Chong word which means &quot;deep canal&quot;. The name &quot;Paet Rio&quot; comes from the story that the city once teemed with giant snakehead fish; up to eight cuts were required on the sides in the making of sun-dried fish.

==Geography==
Neighboring provinces are (from north clockwise) Prachinburi, Sa Kaeo, Chanthaburi, Chonburi, Samut Prakan, Bangkok, Pathum Thani, and Nakhon Nayok. It has a short coastline on the Gulf of Thailand.

The western part of the province is the low river plain of the Bang Pa Kong River, which is used extensively for farming rice. To the east is hillier terrain, with an average elevation of more than 100 metres. In Tha Takiap District is the Khao Ang Rue Nai Wildlife Sanctuary with an area of 674,352 rai ~ . The total forest area in the province is or 15.5 percent of provincial area.

==Economy==
The province has gained a reputation as a centre for recycling potentially hazardous electronic waste (e-waste), despite a June 2018 ban on imports of foreign e-waste to Thailand. China banned the import of foreign e-waste in 2018 also. Since the e-waste ban, 28 new recycling factories, most dealing with e-waste, have started in Chachoengsao province, particularly in the Ko Khanun Subdistrict of Phanom Sarakham District. In 2019, 14 businesses in Chachoengsao were granted licenses to process electronic waste, six of them in Ko Khanun. An official of the Basel Action Network, which campaigns against dumping waste in poor countries, said, &quot;E-waste has to go somewhere, and the Chinese are simply moving their entire operations to Southeast Asia. The only way to make money is to get huge volume with cheap, illegal labour and pollute the hell out of the environment,&quot; he added.

In 2024, Thailand is actively progressing towards the establishment of a special economic zone (SEZ) in Chachoengsao province. This SEZ initiative specifically aims to advance clean energy development and support the production of electric vehicles (EVs). The SEZ, designed as an industrial estate, will attract investments in battery plants, clean energy technologies, and electricity infrastructure.

Chachoengsao province is expected to play a significant role in Thailand&#x27;s growing EV industry. Domestic sales of battery electric vehicles experienced an impressive surge of 603% in 2020, driven by government subsidies provided to EV purchasers ranging from 70,000 to 150,000 THB (1,900-4,160 USD). Despite a reduction in subsidies for the current year, the trend of EV adoption is expected to continue.

The boundaries of the SEZ and investment privileges for businesses will be determined by Thailand&#x27;s Policy Committee. This initiative adds to the existing special economic zones within the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC), which encompass various sectors such as high-speed rail, digital industry, innovation, medical innovation, aviation, genomics, and digital innovation and advanced technology. The establishment of the SEZ in Chachoengsao province is anticipated to contribute significantly to Thailand&#x27;s objectives of promoting clean energy, supporting the growth of the EV industry, and fostering economic development in the region.

==Symbols==
The provincial seal shows the main hall of the Wat Sothonwararam. In this hall is the most important Buddha image of the province, known as &quot;Luangpho Phutthasothon&quot;.

The provincial tree is &quot;Peltophorum dasyrachis&quot;. The tree was assigned to the province by Queen Sirikit on the 50th anniversary of the coronation of King Rama IX in 2000. The provincial flower is the Yellow Flamboyant (&quot;Peltophorum pterocarpum&quot;). The provincial fish is the barramundi (&quot;Lates calcarifer&quot;).

The provincial slogan is &quot;The bountiful Bang Pakong River. The sacred image of Luang Pho Sothon. Phraya Sri Sunthon, the scholar of Thai language. The rich forests of Ang Rue Nai.&quot;

==Administrative divisions==
===Provincial government===

The province is divided into 11 districts (&quot;amphoes&quot;). These are further divided into 93 subdistricts (&quot;tambons&quot;) and 859 villages (&quot;mubans&quot;).
===Local government===
As of 26 November 2019 there are: one Chachoengsao Provincial Administration Organisation (&quot;&quot;) and 34 municipal (&quot;thesaban&quot;) areas in the province. Chachoengsao has town (&quot;thesaban mueang&quot;) status. Further 33 subdistrict municipalities (&quot;thesaban tambon&quot;). The non-municipal areas are administered by 74 Subdistrict Administrative Organisations - SAO (&quot;ongkan borihan suan tambon&quot;).

<doc id="313757" wikidata="Q1188543" url="?curid=313757" title="Fourth-generation fighter">
<text>The fourth-generation fighter is a class of jet fighters in service from around 1980 to the present, and represents design concepts of the 1970s. Fourth-generation designs are heavily influenced by lessons learned from the previous generation of combat aircraft. Third-generation fighters were often designed primarily as interceptors, being built around speed and air-to-air missiles. While exceptionally fast in a straight line, many third-generation fighters severely lacked in maneuverability, as doctrine held that traditional dogfighting would be impossible at supersonic speeds. In practice, air-to-air missiles of the time, despite being responsible for the vast majority of air-to-air victories, were relatively unreliable, and combat would quickly become subsonic and close-range. This would leave third-generation fighters vulnerable and ill-equipped, renewing an interest in manoeuvrability for the fourth generation of fighters. Meanwhile, the growing costs of military aircraft in general and the demonstrated success of aircraft such as the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II gave rise to the popularity of multirole combat aircraft in parallel with the advances marking the so-called fourth generation.

During this period, maneuverability was enhanced by relaxed static stability, made possible by introduction of the fly-by-wire (FBW) flight-control system, which in turn was possible due to advances in digital computers and system-integration techniques. Replacement of analog avionics, required to enable FBW operations, became a fundamental requirement as legacy analog computer systems began to be replaced by digital flight-control systems in the latter half of the 1980s. The further advance of microcomputers in the 1980s and 1990s permitted rapid upgrades to the avionics over the lifetimes of these fighters, incorporating system upgrades such as active electronically scanned array (AESA), digital avionics buses, and infra-red search and track.

Due to the dramatic enhancement of capabilities in these upgraded fighters and in new designs of the 1990s that reflected these new capabilities, they have come to be known as 4.5 generation. This is intended to reflect a class of fighters that are evolutionary upgrades of the fourth generation incorporating integrated avionics suites, advanced weapons efforts to make the (mostly) conventionally designed aircraft nonetheless less easily detectable and trackable as a response to advancing missile and radar technology (see stealth technology). Inherent airframe design features exist and include masking of turbine blades and application of advanced sometimes radar-absorbent materials, but not the distinctive low-observable configurations of the latest aircraft, referred to as fifth-generation fighters or aircraft such as the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor.

The United States defines 4.5-generation fighter aircraft as fourth-generation jet fighters that have been upgraded with AESA radar, high-capacity data-link, enhanced avionics, and &quot;the ability to deploy current and reasonably foreseeable advanced armaments&quot;. Contemporary examples of 4.5-generation fighters are the Sukhoi Su-30SM/Su-34/Su-35, Shenyang J-15B/J-16, Chengdu J-10C, Mikoyan MiG-35, Eurofighter Typhoon, Dassault Rafale, Saab JAS 39E/F Gripen, Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, Lockheed Martin F-16E/F/V Block 70/72, McDonnell Douglas F-15E/EX Strike Eagle/Eagle II, HAL Tejas MK1A, CAC/PAC JF-17 Block 3, and Mitsubishi F-2.

==Characteristics==

===Performance===

Whereas the premier third-generation jet fighters (e.g., the F-4 and MiG-23) were designed as interceptors with only a secondary emphasis on maneuverability, 4th generation aircraft try to reach an equilibrium, with most designs, such as the F-14 and the F-15, being able to execute BVR interceptions while remaining highly maneuverable in case the platform and the pilot find themselves in a close range dogfight. While the trade-offs involved in combat aircraft design are again shifting towards beyond visual range (BVR) engagement, the management of the advancing environment of numerous information flows in the modern battlespace, and low-observability, arguably at the expense of maneuvering ability in close combat, the application of thrust vectoring provides a way to maintain it, especially at low speed.

Key advances contributing to enhanced maneuverability in the fourth generation include high engine thrust, powerful control surfaces, and relaxed static stability (RSS), this last enabled via &quot;fly-by-wire&quot; computer-controlled stability augmentation. Air combat manoeuvring also involves a great deal of energy management to maintain speed and altitude under rapidly changing flight conditions.
===Fly-by-wire===
Fly-by-wire is a term used to describe the computerized automation of flight control surfaces. Early fourth-generation fighters like the F-15 Eagle and F-14 Tomcat retained electromechanical flight hydraulics. Later fourth-generation fighters would make extensive use of fly-by-wire technology.

The General Dynamics YF-16, eventually developed into the F-16 Fighting Falcon, was the world&#x27;s first aircraft intentionally designed to be slightly aerodynamically unstable. This technique, called relaxed static stability (RSS), was incorporated to further enhance the aircraft&#x27;s performance. Most aircraft are designed with &quot;positive&quot; static stability, which induces an aircraft to return to its original attitude following a disturbance. However, positive static stability, the tendency to remain in its current attitude, opposes the pilot&#x27;s efforts to maneuver. An aircraft with &quot;negative&quot; static stability, though, in the absence of control input, will readily deviate from level and controlled flight. An unstable aircraft can therefore be made more maneuverable. Such a 4th generation aircraft requires a computerized FBW flight control system (FLCS) to maintain its desired flight path.

Some late derivatives of the early types, such as the F-15SA Strike Eagle for Saudi Arabia, have included upgrading to FBW.

===Thrust vectoring===
Thrust vectoring was originally introduced in the Hawker Siddeley Harrier for vertical takeoff and landing, and pilots soon developed the technique of &quot;viffing&quot;, or vectoring in forward flight, to enhance manoeuvrability. The first fixed-wing type to display enhanced manoeuvrability in this way was the Sukhoi Su-27, the first aircraft to publicly display thrust vectoring in pitch. Combined with a thrust-to-weight ratio above unity, this enabled it to maintain near-zero airspeed at high angles of attack without stalling, and perform novel aerobatics such as Pugachev&#x27;s Cobra. The three-dimensional TVC nozzles of the Sukhoi Su-30MKI are mounted 32° outward to the longitudinal engine axis (i.e. in the horizontal plane) and can be deflected ±15° in the vertical plane. This produces a corkscrew effect, further enhancing the turning capability of the aircraft. The MiG-35 with its RD-33OVT engines with the vectored thrust nozzles allows it to be the first twin-engined aircraft with vectoring nozzles that can move in two directions (that is, 3D TVC). Other existing thrust-vectoring aircraft, like the F-22, have nozzles that vector in one direction. The technology has been fitted to the Sukhoi Su-47 Berkut and later derivatives. The U.S. explored fitting the technology to the F-16 and the F-15, but did not introduce it until the fifth generation arrived.

===Supercruise===

Supercruise is the ability of a jet aircraft to cruise at supersonic speeds without using an afterburner.

Maintaining supersonic speed without afterburner use saves large quantities of fuel, greatly increasing range and endurance, but the engine power available is limited and drag rises sharply in the transonic region, so drag-creating equipment such as external stores and their attachment points must be minimised, preferably with the use of internal storage.

The Eurofighter Typhoon can cruise around Mach 1.2 without afterburner, with the maximum level speed without reheat is Mach 1.5. An EF T1 DA (Development Aircraft trainer version) demonstrated supercruise (1.21 M) with 2 SRAAM, 4 MRAAM and drop tank (plus 1-tonne flight-test equipment, plus 700 kg more weight for the trainer version) during the Singapore evaluation.
===Avionics===
Avionics can often be swapped out as new technologies become available; they are often upgraded over the lifetime of an aircraft. For example, the F-15C Eagle, first produced in 1978, has received upgrades in 2007 such as AESA radar and joint helmet-mounted cueing system, and is scheduled to receive a 2040C upgrade to keep it in service until 2040.
The primary sensor for all modern fighters is radar. The U.S. fielded its first modified F-15Cs equipped with AN/APG-63(V)2 AESA radars, which have no moving parts and are capable of projecting a much tighter beam and quicker scans. Later on, it was introduced to the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and the block 60 (export) F-16 also, and will be used for future American fighters. France introduced its first indigenous AESA radar, the RBE2-AESA built by Thales in February 2012 for use on the Rafale. The RBE2-AESA can also be retrofitted on the Mirage 2000. A European consortium GTDAR is developing an AESA Euroradar CAPTOR radar for future use on the Typhoon. For the next-generation F-22 and F-35, the U.S. will use low probability of intercept capacity. This will spread the energy of a radar pulse over several frequencies, so as not to trip the radar warning receivers that all aircraft carry.
In response to the increasing American emphasis on radar-evading stealth designs, Russia turned to alternate sensors, with emphasis on Infrared Search and Track (IRST) sensors, first introduced on the American F-101 Voodoo and F-102 Delta Dagger fighters in the 1960s, for detection and tracking of airborne targets. These measure IR radiation from targets. As a passive sensor, it has limited range, and contains no inherent data about position and direction of targets—these must be inferred from the images captured. To offset this, IRST systems can incorporate a laser rangefinder in order to provide full fire-control solutions for cannon fire or for launching missiles. Using this method, German MiG-29 using helmet-displayed IRST systems were able to acquire a missile lock with greater efficiency than USAF F-16 in wargame exercises. IRST sensors have now become standard on Russian aircraft. 

A computing feature of significant tactical importance is the datalink. All modern European and American aircraft are capable of sharing targeting data with allied fighters and AWACS planes (see JTIDS). The Russian MiG-31 interceptor also has some datalink capability. The sharing of targeting and sensor data allows pilots to put radiating, highly visible sensors further from enemy forces, while using those data to vector silent fighters toward the enemy.

===Stealth===

While the basic principles of shaping aircraft to avoid radar detection were known since the 1960s, the advent of radar-absorbent materials allowed aircraft of drastically reduced radar cross-section to become practicable. During the 1970s, early stealth technology led to the faceted airframe of the Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk ground-attack aircraft. The faceting reflected radar beams highly directionally, leading to brief &quot;twinkles&quot;, which detector systems of the day typically registered as noise, but even with digital FBW stability and control enhancement, the aerodynamic performance penalties were severe and the F-117 found use principally in the night ground-attack role. Stealth technologies also seek to decrease the infrared signature, visual signature, and acoustic signature of the aircraft.

In the modern-day, the KF-21 Boramae, though not considered a 5th-gen fighter, has much more significant stealth than other 4th gen fighters.

==4.5 generation==
The term 4.5 generation is often used to refer to new or enhanced fighters, which appeared beginning in the 1990s, and incorporated some features regarded as fifth generation, but lacked others. The 4.5-generation fighters are therefore generally less expensive, less complex, and have a shorter development time than true fifth-generation aircraft, while maintaining capabilities significantly in advance of those of the original fourth generation. Such capabilities may include advanced sensor integration, AESA radar, supercruise capability, supermaneuverability, broad multi-role capability, and reduced radar cross-section.

The 4.5-generation fighters have introduced integrated IRST systems, such as the Dassault Rafale featuring the &quot;optronique secteur frontal&quot; integrated IRST. The Eurofighter Typhoon introduced the PIRATE-IRST, which was also retrofitted to earlier production models. The Super Hornet was also fitted with IRST although not integrated but rather as a pod that needs to be attached on one of the hardpoints.

As advances in stealthy materials and design methods enabled smoother airframes, such technologies began to be retrospectively applied to existing fighter aircraft. Many 4.5 generation fighters incorporate some low-observable features. Low-observable radar technology emerged as an important development. The Pakistani / Chinese JF-17 and China&#x27;s Chengdu J-10B/C use a diverterless supersonic inlet, while India&#x27;s HAL Tejas uses carbon-fiber composite in manufacturing. The IAI Lavi used an S-duct air intake to prevent radar waves from reflecting off the engine compressor blades, an important aspect of fifth-generation fighter aircraft to reduce frontal RCS. These are a few of the preferred methods employed in some fifth-generation fighters to reduce RCS.

KAI KF-21 Boramae is a joint South Korean-Indonesian fighter program, the functionality of the Block 1 model (the first flight test prototype) has been described as ‘4.5th generation’.

<text>Black sand is sand that is black in color. One type of black sand is a heavy, glossy, partly magnetic mixture of usually fine sands containing minerals such as magnetite, found as part of a placer deposit. Another type of black sand, found on beaches near a volcano, consists of tiny fragments of basalt.

While some beaches are predominantly made of black sand, even other color beaches (e.g. gold and white) can often have deposits of black sand, particularly after storms. Larger waves can sort out sand grains leaving deposits of heavy minerals visible on the surface of erosion escarpments.

==Placer deposits==
Black sands are used by miners and prospectors to indicate the presence of a placer formation. Placer mining activities produce a concentrate that is composed mostly of black sand. Black sand concentrates often contain additional valuables, other than precious metals: rare earth elements, thorium, titanium, tungsten, zirconium and others are often fractionated during igneous processes into a common mineral-suite that becomes black sands after weathering and erosion.

Several gemstones, such as garnet, topaz, ruby, sapphire, and diamond are found in placers and in the course of placer mining, and sands of these gems are found in black sands and concentrates. Purple or ruby-colored garnet sand often forms a showy surface dressing on ocean beach placers.

An example of a non-volcanic black sand beach is at Langkawi in Malaysia.

==Basalt fragments==

When lava contacts water, it cools rapidly and shatters into sand and fragmented debris of various size. Much of the debris is small enough to be considered sand. A large lava flow entering an ocean may produce enough basalt fragments to build a new black sand beach almost overnight. The famous &quot;black sand&quot; beaches of Hawaii, such as Punaluʻu Beach and Kehena Beach, were created virtually instantaneously by the violent interaction between hot lava and sea water. Since a black sand beach is made by a lava flow in a one time event, they tend to be rather short lived since sands do not get replenished if currents or storms wash sand into deeper water. For this reason, the state of Hawaii has made it illegal to remove black sand from its beaches. Further, a black sand beach is vulnerable to being inundated by future lava flows, as was the case for Hawaiʻi&#x27;s Kaimū, usually known simply as Black Sand Beach, and Kalapana beaches. An even shorter-lived black sand beach was Kamoamoa. Unlike with white and green sand beaches, walking barefoot on black sand can result in burns, as the black sand absorbs more solar radiation.

<doc id="313766" wikidata="Q141037" url="?curid=313766" title="Edward Burnett Tylor">
<text>Sir Edward Burnett Tylor (2 October 18322 January 1917) was an English anthropologist, and professor of anthropology.

Tylor&#x27;s ideas typify 19th-century cultural evolutionism. In his works &quot;Primitive Culture&quot; (1871) and &quot;Anthropology&quot; (1881), he defined the context of the scientific study of anthropology, based on the evolutionary theories of Charles Lyell. He believed that there was a functional basis for the development of society and religion, which he determined was universal. Tylor maintained that all societies passed through three basic stages of development: from savagery, through barbarism to civilization. Tylor is a founding figure of the science of social anthropology, and his scholarly works helped to build the discipline of anthropology in the nineteenth century. He believed that &quot;research into the history and prehistory of man [...] could be used as a basis for the reform of British society.&quot;

Tylor reintroduced the term &quot;animism&quot; (faith in the individual soul or &quot;anima&quot; of all things and natural manifestations) into common use. He regarded animism as the first phase in the development of religions.

==Early life and education==
Tylor was born in 1832, in Camberwell, London, the son of Joseph Tylor and Harriet Skipper, part of a family of wealthy Quakers who owned a London brass factory. His elder brother, Alfred Tylor, became a geologist.

He was educated at Grove House School, Tottenham, but due to his Quaker faith and the death of his parents he left school at the age of 16 without obtaining a degree. After leaving school, he prepared to help manage the family business. This plan was put aside when he developed tuberculosis at age 23. Following medical advice to spend time in warmer climes, Tylor left England in 1855, and travelled to the Americas. The experience proved to be an important and formative one, sparking his lifelong interest in studying unfamiliar cultures.

During his travels, Tylor met Henry Christy, a fellow Quaker, ethnologist and archaeologist. Tylor&#x27;s association with Christy greatly stimulated his awakening interest in anthropology, and helped broaden his inquiries to include prehistoric studies.

==Professional career==

Tylor&#x27;s first publication was a result of his 1856 trip to Mexico with Christy. His notes on the beliefs and practices of the people he encountered were the basis of his work &quot;Anahuac: Or Mexico and the Mexicans, Ancient and Modern&quot; (1861), published after his return to England. Tylor continued to study the customs and beliefs of tribal communities, both existing and prehistoric (based on archaeological finds). He published his second work, &quot;Researches into the Early History of Mankind and the Development of Civilization&quot;, in 1865. Following this came his most influential work, &quot;Primitive Culture&quot; (1871). This was important not only for its thorough study of human civilisation and contributions to the emergent field of anthropology, but for its undeniable influence on a handful of young scholars, such as J. G. Frazer, who were to become Tylor&#x27;s disciples and contribute greatly to the scientific study of anthropology in later years.

Tylor was appointed Keeper of the University Museum at Oxford in 1883, and, as well as serving as a lecturer, held the title of the first &quot;Reader in Anthropology&quot; from 1884 to 1895. In 1896 he was appointed the first Professor of Anthropology at Oxford University. He was also closely involved in the early history of the Pitt Rivers Museum, built adjacent to the University Museum. Tylor acted as anthropological consultant on the first edition of the Oxford English Dictionary.

The 1907, festschrift &quot;Anthropological Essays presented to Edward Burnett Tylor&quot;, formally presented to Tylor on his 75th birthday, contains essays by 20 anthropologists, a 15-page appreciation of Tylor&#x27;s work by Andrew Lang, and a comprehensive bibliography of Tylor&#x27;s publications compiled by Barbara Freire-Marreco.

==Thought==
===Classification and criticisms===

The word evolution is forever associated in the popular mind with Charles Darwin&#x27;s Theory of Evolution, which professes, among other things, that man as a species developed diachronically from some ancestor among the Primates who was also ancestor to the Great Apes, as they are popularly termed, and yet this term was not a neologism of Darwin&#x27;s. He took it from the cultural milieu, where it meant etymologically &quot;unfolding&quot; of something heterogeneous and complex from something simpler and more homogeneous. Herbert Spencer, a contemporary of Darwin, applied the term to the universe, including philosophy and what Tylor would later call culture. This view of the universe was generally termed evolutionism, while its exponents were evolutionists.

In 1871 Tylor published &quot;Primitive Culture&quot;, becoming the originator of cultural anthropology. His methods were comparative and historical ethnography. He believed that a &quot;uniformity&quot; was manifest in culture, which was the result of &quot;uniform action of uniform causes.&quot; He regarded his instances of parallel ethnographic concepts and practices as indicative of &quot;laws of human thought and action.&quot; He was an evolutionist. The task of cultural anthropology therefore is to discover &quot;stages of development or evolution.&quot;

Evolutionism was distinguished from another creed, diffusionism, postulating the spread of items of culture from regions of innovation. A given apparent parallelism thus had at least two explanations: the instances descend from an evolutionary ancestor, or they are alike because one diffused into the culture from elsewhere. These two views are exactly parallel to the tree model and wave model of historical linguistics, which are instances of evolutionism and diffusionism, language features being instances of culture.

Two other classifications were proposed in 1993 by Upadhyay and Pandey, Classical Evolutionary School and Neo Evolutionary School, the Classical to be divided into British, American, and German. The Classical British Evolutionary School, primarily at Oxford University, divided society into two evolutionary stages, savagery and civilization, based on the archaeology of John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury. Upadhyay and Pandey list its adherents as Robert Ranulph Marett, Henry James Sumner Maine, John Ferguson McLennan, and James George Frazer, as well as Tylor. Marett was the last man standing, dying in 1943. By the time of his death, Lubbock&#x27;s archaeology had been updated. The American School, beginning with Lewis Henry Morgan, was likewise superseded, both being replaced by the Neoevolutionist School, beginning with V. Gordon Childe. It brought the archaeology up-to-date and tended to omit the intervening society names, such as savagery; for example, Neolithic is both a tool tradition and a form of society.

There are some other classifications. Theorists of each classification each have their own criticisms of the Classical/Neo Evolutionary lines, which despite them remains the dominant view. Some criticisms are in brief as follows. There is really no universality; that is, the apparent parallels are accidental, on which the theorist has imposed a model that does not really fit. There is no uniform causality, but different causes might produce similar results. All cultural groups do not have the same stages of development. The theorists are arm-chair anthropologists; their data is insufficient to form realistic abstractions. They overlooked cultural diffusion. They overlooked cultural innovation. None of the critics claim definitive proof that their criticisms are less subjective or interpretive than the models they criticise.

===Basic concepts===
====Culture====
Tylor&#x27;s notion is best described in his most famous work, the two-volume &quot;Primitive Culture&quot;. The first volume, The &quot;Origins of Culture&quot;, deals with ethnography including social evolution, linguistics, and myth. The second volume, &quot;Religion in Primitive Culture&quot;, deals mainly with his interpretation of animism.

On the first page of &quot;Primitive Culture&quot;, Tylor provides a definition which is one of his most widely recognised contributions to anthropology and the study of religion:

Also, the first chapter of the work gives an outline of a new discipline, science of culture, later known as culturology.

====Universals====
Unlike many of his predecessors and contemporaries, Tylor asserts that the human mind and its capabilities are the same globally, despite a particular society&#x27;s stage in social evolution. This means that a hunter-gatherer society would possess the same amount of intelligence as an advanced industrial society. The difference, Tylor asserts, is education, which he considers the cumulative knowledge and methodology that takes thousands of years to acquire. Tylor often likens primitive cultures to &quot;children&quot;, and sees culture and the mind of humans as progressive. His work was a refutation of the theory of social degeneration, which was popular at the time. At the end of &quot;Primitive Culture,&quot; Tylor writes, &quot;The science of culture is essentially a reformers&#x27; science.&quot;

===Tylor&#x27;s evolutionism===
In 1881 Tylor published a work he called &quot;Anthropology&quot;, one of the first under that name. In the first chapter he uttered what would become a sort of constitutional statement for the new field, which he could not know and did not intend at the time:

The view was a restatement of ideas first innovated in the early 1860s. The theorist perhaps most influential on Tylor was John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury, innovator of the terminology, &quot;Paleolithic&quot; and &quot;Neolithic.&quot; A prominent banker and British liberal Parliamentarian, he was imbued with a passion for archaeology. The initial concepts of prehistory were his. Lubbock&#x27;s works featured prominently in Tylor&#x27;s lectures and in the Pitt Rivers Museum subsequently.

====Survivals====
A term ascribed to Tylor was his theory of &quot;survivals&quot;. His definition of survivals is

&quot;Survivals&quot; can include outdated practices, such as the European practice of bloodletting, which lasted long after the medical theories on which it was based had faded from use and been replaced by more modern techniques. Critics argued that he identified the term but provided an insufficient reason as to why survivals continue. Tylor&#x27;s meme-like concept of survivals explains the characteristics of a culture that are linked to earlier stages of human culture.

Studying survivals assists ethnographers in reconstructing earlier cultural characteristics and possibly reconstructing the evolution of culture.

====Evolution of religion====
Tylor argued that people had used religion to explain things that occurred in the world. He saw that it was important for religions to have the ability to explain why and for what reason things occurred in the world. For example, God (or the divine) gave us sun to keep us warm and give us light. Tylor argued that animism is the true natural religion that is the essence of religion; it answers the questions of which religion came first and which religion is essentially the most basic and foundation of all religions. For him, animism was the best answer to these questions, so it must be the true foundation of all religions. Animism is described as the belief in spirits inhabiting and animating beings, or souls existing in things. To Tylor, the fact that modern religious practitioners continued to believe in spirits showed that these people were no more advanced than primitive societies. For him, this implied that modern religious practitioners do not understand the ways of the universe and how life truly works because they have excluded science from their understanding of the world. By excluding scientific explanation in their understanding of why and how things occur, he asserts modern religious practitioners are rudimentary. Tylor perceived the modern religious belief in God as a &quot;survival&quot; of primitive ignorance. However, Tylor did not believe that atheism was the logical end of cultural and religious development, but instead a highly minimalist form of monotheist deism. Tylor thus posited an anthropological description of &quot;the gradual elimination of paganism&quot; and disenchantment, but not secularization.

<text>A time horizon, also known as a planning horizon, is a fixed point of time in the future at which point certain processes will be evaluated or assumed to end. It is necessary in an accounting, finance or risk management regime to assign such a fixed horizon time so that alternatives can be evaluated for performance over the same period of time.

Although short term horizons such as end of day, end of week, end of month matter in accounting, generally it is mere summing-up and the simplest mark to market processes that take place at these short term horizons. No scenario analysis or mark to future activities are usually undertaken for such short periods, except for very large portfolios.

The most common horizons used in planning are one &quot;quarter&quot; (a quarter year, or three months), a year, two years, three years, four years (especially in a representative democracy where this is a quite common term of office and election cycle) and five years (in corporate planning). More far-sighted companies and government agencies may also use between ten and one hundred years. Thirty years is often used in mortgage contracts and US Treasury bonds such as the &quot;long bond&quot;. The Forestry Commission in the UK plans over a century into the future.

Agreeing on a common time horizon for action is particularly important in global policy, as each participant will have very different time horizon habits. Achieving simultaneous policy is quite difficult without an agreement, as those taking action early may be seriously disadvantaged in competition with those taking action late on a regulatory matter. One attempt to bring about a global simultaneous policy is being attempted by the International Simultaneous Policy Organization&#x27;s SIMPOL campaign.
