<text>Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis (), often known by his surnames as Machado de Assis, &quot;Machado,&quot; or &quot;Bruxo do Cosme Velho&quot; (21 June 1839 – 29 September 1908), was a pioneer Brazilian novelist, poet, playwright and short story writer, widely regarded as the greatest writer of Brazilian literature. In 1897, he founded and became the first President of the Brazilian Academy of Letters. He was multilingual, having taught himself French, English, German and Greek later in life.

Born in , Rio de Janeiro, from a poor family, he was the grandson of freed slaves in a country where slavery would not be fully abolished until 49 years later. He barely studied in public schools and never attended university. With only his own intellect and autodidactism to rely on, he struggled to rise socially. To do so, he took several public positions, passing through the Ministry of Agriculture, Trade and Public Works, and achieving early fame in newspapers where he first published his poetry and chronicles. 

Machado&#x27;s work shaped the realist movement in Brazil. He became known for his wit and his eye-opening critiques of society. Generally considered to be Machado&#x27;s greatest works are &quot;Dom Casmurro&quot; (1899), &quot;Memórias Póstumas de Brás Cubas&quot; (&quot;Posthumous Memoirs of Brás Cubas&quot;, also translated as &quot;Epitaph of a Small Winner&quot;) and &quot;Quincas Borba&quot; (also known in English as &quot;Philosopher or Dog?&quot;). In 1893, he published &quot;A Missa do Galo&quot; (&quot;Midnight Mass&quot;), often considered to be the greatest short story in Brazilian literature.

==Biography==

===Birth and adolescence===

Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis was born on 21 June 1839 in Rio de Janeiro, then capital of the Empire of Brazil. His parents were Francisco José de Assis, a wall painter, the son of freed slaves, and Maria Leopoldina da Câmara Machado, a Portuguese washerwoman from the Azores. He was born in Livramento country house, owned by &quot;Dona&quot; Maria José de Mendonça Barroso Pereira, widow of senator Bento Barroso Pereira, who protected his parents and allowed them to live with her. &quot;Dona&quot; Maria José became Joaquim&#x27;s godmother; her brother-in-law, commendator Joaquim Alberto de Sousa da Silveira, was his godfather, and both were paid homage by giving their names to the baby. Machado had a sister who died young. Joaquim studied in a public school, but was not a good student. While helping to serve the masses, he met Father Silveira Sarmento, who became his Latin teacher and also a good friend.

When Joaquim was ten years old, his mother died, and his father took him along as he moved to São Cristóvão. Francisco de Assis met Maria Inês da Silva, and they married in 1854. Joaquim had classes in a school for girls only, thanks to his stepmother who worked there making candies. At night he learned French with an immigrant baker. In his adolescence, he met Francisco de Paulo Brito, who owned a bookstore, a newspaper and typography. On 12 January 1855, Francisco de Paula published the poem &quot;Ela&quot; (&quot;Her&quot;) written by Joaquim, then 15 years old, in the newspaper &quot;Marmota Fluminense&quot;. In the following year, he was hired as typographer&#x27;s apprentice in the &quot;Imprensa Oficial&quot; (the Official Press, charged with the publication of Government measures), where he was encouraged as a writer by Manuel Antônio de Almeida, the newspaper&#x27;s director and also a novelist. There he also met Francisco Otaviano, journalist and later liberal senator, and Quintino Bocaiuva, who decades later would become known for his role as a republican orator.

===Early career and education===

Francisco Otaviano hired Machado to work on the newspaper &quot;Correio Mercantil&quot; as a proofreader in 1858. He continued to write for the &quot;Marmota Fluminense&quot; and also for several other newspapers, but he did not earn much and had a humble life. As he did not live with his father anymore, it was common for him to eat only once a day for lack of money.

Around this time, he became a friend of the writer and liberal politician José de Alencar, who taught him English. From English literature, he was influenced by Laurence Sterne, William Shakespeare, Lord Byron and Jonathan Swift. He learned German years later and in his old age, Greek. He was invited by Bocaiúva to work at his newspaper &quot;Diário do Rio de Janeiro&quot; in 1860. Machado had a passion for theater and wrote several plays for a short time; his friend Bocaiúva concluded: &quot;Your works are meant to be read and not played.&quot; He gained some notability and began to sign his writings as J. M. Machado de Assis, the way he would be known for posterity: Machado de Assis. He established himself in advanced Liberal Party circles by taking stands in defense of religious freedom and Ernest Renan&#x27;s controversial &quot;Life of Jesus&quot; while attacking the venality of the clergy.

His father, Francisco de Assis, died in 1864. Machado learned of his father&#x27;s death through acquaintances. He dedicated his compilation of poems called &quot;Crisálidas&quot; to his father: &quot;To the Memory of Francisco José de Assis and Maria Leopoldina Machado de Assis, my Parents.&quot; With the Liberal Party&#x27;s ascension to power at that time, Machado thought he might receive a patronage position that would help him improve his life. To his surprise, aid came from the Emperor Dom Pedro II, who hired him as director-assistant in the &quot;Diário Oficial&quot; in 1867, and knighted him as an honor. In 1888 Machado was made an officer of the Order of the Rose.

===Marriage and family===

In 1868 Machado met the Portuguese Carolina Augusta Xavier de Novais, five years older than he was. She was the sister of his colleague Faustino Xavier de Novais, for whom he worked on the magazine &quot;O Futuro&quot;. Machado had a stammer and was extremely shy, short and lean. He was also very intelligent and well-learned. He married Carolina on 12 November 1869; although her parents, Miguel and Adelaide, and her siblings disapproved because Machado was of African descent and she was a white woman. They had no children.

===Literature===

Machado managed to rise in his bureaucratic career, first in the Agriculture Department. Three years later, he became the head of a section in it. He published two poetry books: &quot;Falenas&quot;, in 1870, and &quot;Americanas&quot;, in 1875. Their weak reception made him explore other literary genres.

He wrote five romantic novels: &quot;Ressurreição&quot;, &quot;A Mão e a Luva&quot;, &quot;Helena&quot; and &quot;Iaiá Garcia&quot;. The books were a success with the public, but literary critics considered them mediocre. Machado suffered repeated attacks of epilepsy, apparently related to the hearing of the death of his old friend José de Alencar. He was left melancholic, pessimistic and fixed on death. His next book, marked by &quot;a skeptical and realistic tone&quot;: &quot;Memórias Póstumas de Brás Cubas&quot; (Posthumous Memoirs of Brás Cubas, also translated as &quot;Epitaph of a Small Winner&quot;), is widely considered a masterpiece. By the end of the 1880s, Machado had gained wide renown as a writer.

Although he was opposed to slavery, he never spoke against it in public. He avoided discussing politics. He was criticized by the abolitionist José do Patrocínio and by the writer Lima Barreto for staying away from politics, especially the cause of abolition. He was also criticized by them for having married a white woman. Machado was caught by surprise with the monarchy overthrown on 15 November 1889. Machado had no sympathy towards republicanism, as he considered himself a liberal monarchist and venerated Pedro II, whom he perceived as &quot;a humble, honest, well-learned and patriotic man, who knew how to make of a throne a chair [for his simplicity], without diminishing its greatness and respect.&quot; When a commission went to the public office where he worked to remove the picture of the former emperor, the shy Machado defied them: &quot;The picture got in here by an order and it shall leave only by another order.&quot;

The birth of the Brazilian republic made Machado become more critical and an observer of the Brazilian society of his time. From then on, he wrote &quot;not only the greatest novels of his time, but the greatest of all time of Brazilian literature.&quot; Works such as &quot;Quincas Borba&quot; &quot;(Philosopher or Dog?)&quot; (1891), &quot;Dom Casmurro&quot; (1899), &quot;Esaú e Jacó&quot; (1904) and &quot;Memorial de Aires&quot; (1908), considered masterpieces, were successes with both critics and the public. In 1893 he published &quot;A Missa do Galo&quot; (&quot;Midnight Mass&quot;), considered his greatest short story.

===Later years===

Machado de Assis, along with fellow monarchists such as Joaquim Nabuco, Manuel de Oliveira Lima, Afonso Celso, Viscount of Ouro Preto and Alfredo d&#x27;Escragnolle Taunay, and other writers and intellectuals, founded the Brazilian Academy of Letters. He was its first president, from 1897 to 1908, when he died. For many years, he requested that the government grant a proper headquarters to the Academy, which he managed to obtain in 1905. In 1902 he was transferred to the accountancy&#x27;s directing board of the Ministry of Industry.

His wife Carolina Novais died on 20 October 1904, after 35 years of a &quot;perfect married life&quot;. Feeling depressed and lonely, Machado died on 29 September 1908.

==Narrative style==

Machado&#x27;s style is unique, and several literary critics have tried to describe it since 1897. He is considered by many the greatest Brazilian writer of all time, and one of the world&#x27;s greatest novelists and short story writers. His chronicles do not share the same status. His poems are often misunderstood for the use of crude terms, sometimes associated to the pessimist style of Augusto dos Anjos, another Brazilian writer.
Machado de Assis was included on American literary critic Harold Bloom&#x27;s list of the greatest 100 geniuses of literature, alongside writers such as Dante, Shakespeare and Cervantes. Bloom considers him the greatest black writer in Western literature; although, in Brazil, Machado is perceived as a Pardo. 

His works have been studied by critics in various countries of the world, such as Giuseppe Alpi (Italy), Lourdes Andreassi (Portugal), Albert Bagby Jr. (US), Abel Barros Baptista (Portugal), Hennio Morgan Birchal (Brazil), Edoardo Bizzarri (Italy), Jean-Michel Massa (France), Helen Caldwell (US), John Gledson (England), Adrien Delpech (France), Albert Dessau (Germany), Paul B. Dixon (US), Keith Ellis (US), Edith Fowke (Canada), Anatole France (France), Richard Graham (US), Pierre Hourcade (France), David Jackson (US), G. Reginald Daniel (US), Linda Murphy Kelley (US), John C. Kinnear, Alfred Mac Adam (US), Victor Orban (France), Daphne Patai (US), Houwens Post (Italy), Samuel Putnam (US), John Hyde Schmitt, Tony Tanner (England), Jack E. Tomlins (US), Carmelo Virgillo (US), Dieter Woll (Germany), August Willemsen (Netherlands) and Susan Sontag (US).

Critics are divided as to the nature of Machado de Assis&#x27;s writing. Some, such as Abel Barros Baptista, classify Machado as a staunch anti-realist, and argue that his writing attacks Realism, aiming to negate the possibility of representation or the existence of a meaningful objective reality. Realist critics such as John Gledson are more likely to regard Machado&#x27;s work as a faithful description of Brazilian reality—but one executed with daring innovative technique. In light of Machado&#x27;s own statements, Daniel argues that Machado&#x27;s novels represent a growing sophistication and daring in maintaining a dialogue between the aesthetic subjectivism of Romanticism (and its offshoots) and the aesthetic objectivism of Realism-Naturalism. Accordingly, Machado&#x27;s earlier novels have more in common with a hybrid mid-19th-century current often referred to as &quot;Romantic Realism.&quot; In addition, his later novels have more in common with another late 19th-century hybrid: literary Impressionism. Historians such as Sidney Chalhoub argue that Machado&#x27;s prose constitutes an exposé of the social, political and economic dysfunction of late Imperial Brazil. Critics agree on how he used innovative techniques to reveal the contradictions of his society. Roberto Schwarz points out that Machado&#x27;s innovations in prose narrative are used to expose the hypocrisies, contradictions, and dysfunction of 19th-century Brazil. Schwarz, argues that Machado inverts many narrative and intellectual conventions to reveal the pernicious ends to which they are used. Thus we see critics reinterpret Machado according to their own designs or their perception of how best to validate him for their own historical moment. Regardless, his incisive prose shines through, able to communicate with readers from different times and places, conveying his ironic and yet tender sense of what we, as human beings, are.

Machado&#x27;s literary style has inspired many Brazilian writers. His works have been adapted to television, theater, and cinema. In 1975 the &quot;Comissão Machado de Assis&quot; (&quot;Machado de Assis Commission&quot;), organized by the Brazilian Ministry of Education and Culture, organized and published critical editions of Machado&#x27;s works, in 15 volumes. His main works have been translated into many languages. Great 20th-century writers such as Salman Rushdie, Cabrera Infante and Carlos Fuentes, as well as the American film director Woody Allen, have expressed their enthusiasm for his fiction. Despite the efforts and patronage of such well-known intellectuals as Susan Sontag, Harold Bloom, and Elizabeth Hardwick, Machado&#x27;s books—the most famous of which are available in English in multiple translations—have never achieved large sales in the English-speaking world and he continues to be relatively unknown, even by comparison with other Latin American writers.

In his works, Machado appeals directly to the reader, breaking the so-called fourth wall.

<doc id="319744" wikidata="Q211870" url="?curid=319744" title="Paisley, Renfrewshire">
<text>Paisley ( ; ; ) is a large town situated in the west central Lowlands of Scotland. Located north of the Gleniffer Braes, the town borders the city of Glasgow to the east, and straddles the banks of the White Cart Water, a tributary of the River Clyde.

Paisley serves as the administrative centre for the Renfrewshire council area, and is the largest town in the historic county of the same name. It is often cited as &quot;Scotland&#x27;s largest town&quot; and is the fifth largest settlement in the country, although it does not have city status.

The town became prominent in the 12th century, with the establishment of Paisley Abbey, an important religious hub which formerly had control over other local churches. Paisley expanded significantly during the Industrial Revolution as a result of its location beside White Cart Water, with access to the Clyde and nearby ore, mineral and agricultural resources. Factories and mills developed leading to an increase in the town&#x27;s population. The town&#x27;s associations with political radicalism were highlighted by its involvement in the Radical War of 1820, with striking weavers being instrumental in the protests.

By the late 19th century, Paisley was a global centre of the weaving industry, giving its name to the Paisley shawl and the Paisley pattern. However, industrial decline followed in the 20th century. By 1993, all of Paisley&#x27;s mills had closed, although they are memorialised in the town&#x27;s museums and civic history. The town now functions as a regional centre for local governance and services as well as a residential commuting area within the Greater Glasgow urban region.

==History==
===Early history===
Formerly and variously known as &quot;Paislay&quot;, &quot;Passelet&quot;, &quot;Passeleth&quot;, and &quot;Passelay&quot; the burgh&#x27;s name is of uncertain origin; some sources suggest a derivation either from the Brittonic word &quot;pasgill&quot;, &quot;pasture&quot;, or from the Cumbric &quot;basaleg&quot;, &quot;basilica&quot;, (i.e. major church), derived from the Greek βασιλική &quot;basilika&quot;. Some Scottish placename books suggest &quot;Pæssa&#x27;s wood/clearing&quot;, from the Old English personal name &quot;Pæssa&quot;, &quot;clearing&quot;, and &quot;leāh&quot;, &quot;wood&quot;. Pasilege (1182) and Paslie (1214) are recorded previous spellings of the name. The Gaelic translation is &quot;Pàislig&quot;. 

It is worth noting that some sources favour the name of the town as having its roots in the Gaelic word &quot;Baisleac&quot;, which is, like the Cumbric &quot;basaleg&quot;, derived from &quot;basilika&quot;. As Paisley was part of the Cumbric speaking Kingdom of Strathclyde, before being absorbed into the Gaelic speaking Kingdom of Alba in the 11th century, and with Cumbric being considered extinct by the 12th century, it is uncertain whether the name of Paisley is of Cumbric or Gaelic origin, due to the linguistic shift that occurred around this time.

The Roman name for Paisley was Vanduara.

Paisley has monastic origins. A chapel is said to have been established by the 6th / 7th-century Irish monk, Saint Mirin, at a site near a waterfall on the White Cart Water known as the Hammils. Though Paisley lacks contemporary documentation it may have been, along with Glasgow and Govan, a major religious centre of the Kingdom of Strathclyde. A priory was established in 1163 from the Cluniac priory at Wenlock in Shropshire, England at the behest of Walter fitz Alan, Steward of Scotland (died 1177). In 1245 this was raised to the status of an abbey. The restored Abbey and adjacent &#x27;Place&#x27; (palace), constructed out of part of the medieval claustral buildings, survive as a Church of Scotland parish church. One of Scotland&#x27;s major religious houses, Paisley Abbey was much favoured by the Bruce and Stewart royal families. King Robert III (1390–1406) was buried in the Abbey. His tomb has not survived, but that of Princess Marjorie Bruce (1296–1316), ancestor of the Stewarts, is one of Scotland&#x27;s few royal monuments to survive the Reformation.

Paisley coalesced under James II&#x27;s wish that the lands should become a single regality and, as a result, markets, trading and commerce began to flourish. In 1488 the town&#x27;s status was raised by James IV to Burgh of barony. Many trades sprang up and the first school was established in 1577 by the Town Council.

====Witch Trials====
The Paisley witches, also known as the Bargarran witches or the Renfrewshire witches, were tried in Paisley in 1697. Seven were convicted and five were hanged and then burnt on the Gallow Green. Their remains were buried at Maxwelton Cross in the west end of the town. This was the last mass execution for witchcraft in western Europe. A horse shoe was placed on top of the site to lock in the evil. A horse shoe is still visible in the middle of this busy road junction today—though not the original. The modern shoe is made of bronze and bears the inscription, &quot;Pain Inflicted, Suffering Endured, Injustice Done&quot;.

===18th and 19th centuries===
====Industrial Revolution====

The Industrial Revolution, based on the textile industry, turned Paisley from a small market town to an important industrial town in the late 18th century. Initially beginning with small scale weaving (as took place at the Sma’ Shot cottages located in Shuttle Street), Paisley&#x27;s location and workforce attracted English mill owners; migrants from Ayrshire and the Highlands poured into a town that offered jobs to women and children until silk fell out of fashion in 1790. The mills switched to the imitation Kashmir (cashmere) shawls called &quot;Paisley&quot;. Under the leadership of Thomas Coats (1809–1893), Paisley became the world centre for thread making. Mills and textile factories grew from the late 18th century, coming to dominate the town in the late Victorian era. These include the Anchor and Seedhill mills, as well as the adjacent Atlantic, Pacific and Mile End mills. Another example was Underwood Mill, a cotton mill founded in the 1780s which was later rebuilt as a thread mill in the 1860s (it fell into disuse in the 1970s). Other thread mills include Oakshaw thread works (later used by Arrol-Johnston car manufacturers) and the Burnside thread works.

==== Origins of Paisley Shawls ====
By the mid-19th century weaving had become the town&#x27;s principal industry. The Paisley weavers&#x27; most famous products were the shawls, which bore the Paisley Pattern made fashionable after being worn by a young Queen Victoria. Despite being of a Kashmiri design and manufactured in other parts of Europe, the teardrop-like pattern soon became known by Paisley&#x27;s name across the western world. Although the shawls dropped out of fashion in the 1870s, the Paisley pattern remains an important symbol of the town: the Paisley Museum maintains a significant collection of the original shawls in this design, and it has been used, for example, in the modern logo of Renfrewshire Council, the local authority.

According to Monique Lévi-Strauss, information on the history of Kashmir shawls&#x27; weaving techniques had been described in books, but in a very unintelligible language. John Irwin published a book named Shawls, a Study in Indo-European Influences, in 1955, in which he relates the Kashmir shawl&#x27;s history and how these shawls spread on the European market during the 19th century. The book showed images of shawls woven in India and also fifteen images of shawls woven in United Kingdom, amongst which is one assigned to a Paisley manufacture, circa 1850. But according to Monique Lévi-Strauss, it resembles by many details a shawl designed by a French designer named Antony Berrus, born in 1815 at Nîmes-France and died in 1883. The designer studied at the drawing School of Nîmes, before settling in Paris and opening in the French capital his own successful design studio, which employed 200 designers. His textile drawings were sold to Lyon in France, in Scotland, in England, in Austria and also in Kashmir. The fact that shawl patterns drawings were made in Europe, sold there and also to India, made the research work extremely difficult, in order to give a precise location of manufacture. Therefore, in 1973, John Irwin published an update of his book, named as The Kashmir Shawl, in which he removed all the images of the shawls related to a European manufacturing. Monique Lévi-Strauss clearly states that her research led her to focus on the shawls creative industries in France in the 19th century, for the reason that the shawl industries in the United Kingdom (Paisley), Austria (Vienna), Germany (Elberfeld) were inspired by France (Paris) and never the opposite. The author then invited textile specialists from these countries to conduct research on their own field. Monique Lévi-Strauss notes the large influence that Kashmir had on the French shawl creative industries, narrowly linking the French history of Kashmir shawls to the Indian ones.
====Political radicalism====
The high-status skilled weavers mobilised themselves in radical protests after 1790, culminating in the failed Radical War between 1816 and 1820. Through its weaving fraternity, Paisley gained notoriety as being a literate and somewhat radical town. Political intrigue, early trades unionism and reforming zeal came together to produce mass demonstrations, cavalry charges down the high street, public riots and trials for treason. Documentation from the period indicates that overthrow of the government was even contemplated by some. The weavers of Paisley were certainly active in the &#x27;Radical War&#x27;. The perceived radical nature of the inhabitants prompted the Tory Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli to comment &quot;Keep your eye on Paisley&quot;. The poet Robert Tannahill lived in this setting, working as a weaver. Paisley&#x27;s annual Sma&#x27; Shot Day celebrations held on the first Saturday of July were initiated in 1856 to commemorate a 19th-century dispute between weavers and employers over payment for &quot;sma&#x27; shot&quot; – a small cotton thread which, although unseen, was necessary in holding together garments.

A permanent military presence was established in the town with the completion of Paisley Barracks in 1822. 

====Economic change====
The economic crisis of 1841–43 hit Paisley hard as most of the mills shut down. Among the mill owners, 67 of 112 went bankrupt. A quarter of the population was on poor relief. The Prime Minister, Sir Robert Peel decided to act. He secured additional funds for relief and sent his own representative to the town to supervise its distribution. He convinced Queen Victoria to wear Paisley products in order to popularise the products and stimulate demand. Overproduction, the collapse of the shawl market and a general depression in the textile industry led to technical changes that reduced the importance of weavers. Politically the mill owners remained in control of the town. However, other industrial development continued in and around Paisley outside of textiles, including the development of ironstone and oil shale extraction at Inkerman. The town also had numerous other industries, examples include numerous engineering works, as well as a distillery, ironwork, dye works and tanneries.

The American Civil War of 1861–1865 cut off cotton supplies to the textile mills of Paisley. The mills in 1861 had a stock of cotton in reserve, but by 1862 there were large-scale shortages and shutdowns. There were no alternative jobs for the workers, and local authorities refused to provide relief. Voluntary relief efforts were inadequate, and the unemployed workers refused to go to workhouses. Workers blamed not the United States, but rather the officials in London for their hardship and did not support the idea of war with the United States. Many of the cotton mills either closed or were converted to thread manufacture which became the main focus of the textile industry in Paisley until the 20th century.

===20th century===
====First World War====
Paisley suffered heavy losses in the First World War. Paisley War Memorial was designed by Sir Robert Lorimer (other sources say Harold Tarbolton) in 1922 and depicts Robert the Bruce going into battle on horseback escorted by footsoldiers dressed as First World War infantry soldiers. It was sculpted by Alice Meredith Williams.

====Bottled snail incident====
Paisley was also the site of an incident that gave rise to a major legal precedent. In a Paisley cafe in 1928, a woman claimed to find a dead snail in a bottle of ginger beer, and became ill. She sued the manufacturer for negligence. At the time a manufacturer was considered liable only if there was a contract in place with the harmed party. After &quot;Donoghue v Stevenson&quot;, a precedent was established that manufacturers (and other &quot;neighbours&quot; or fellow citizens) owe a duty not to do foreseeable harm to others by negligence, regardless of contractual obligations, which paved the way for modern tort law. The case is often called the &quot;Paisley snail&quot;.

====Second World War====
Owing to its industrial roots, Paisley, like many industrial towns in Renfrewshire, became a target for German &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; bombers during World War II. Although it was not bombed as heavily as nearby Glasgow (see Clydebank Blitz), air raids still occurred periodically during the early years of the war, killing nearly a hundred people in several separate incidents; on 6 May 1941, a parachute mine was dropped in the early hours of the morning claiming 92 victims; this is billed the worst disaster in Paisley&#x27;s history. The Gleniffer Braes, on the southern outskirts of Paisley, are home to a number of &quot;decoy ponds&quot; (mock airfields) used by the RAF after the Battle of Britain as part of a project code-named &quot;Starfish Decoy&quot; designed to confuse German spies.

====Industrial decline====
Paisley, as with other areas in Renfrewshire, was at one time famous for its weaving and textile industries. As a consequence, the Paisley pattern has long symbolic associations with the town. Until the Jacquard loom was introduced in the 1820s, weaving was a cottage industry. This innovation led to the industrialisation of the process and many larger mills were created in the town. Also as a consequence of greater mechanisation, many weavers lost their livelihoods and left for Canada and Australia. Paisley was for many years a centre for the manufacture of cotton sewing thread. At the heyday of Paisley thread manufacture in the 1930s, there were 28,000 people employed in the huge Anchor and Ferguslie mills of J &amp; P Coats Ltd, said to be the largest of their kind in the world at that time. In the 1950s, the mills diversified into the production of synthetic threads but production diminished rapidly as a result of less expensive imports from overseas and the establishment of mills in India and Brazil by J &amp; P Coats. By the end of the 1993, there was no thread being produced in Paisley.

The town also supported a number of engineering works some of which relied on the textile industry, others on shipbuilding. Paisley once had five shipyards including John Fullerton and Company (1866–1928), Bow, McLachlan and Company (1872–1932) and Fleming and Ferguson (1877–1969).

A number of food manufacture companies existed in Paisley. The preserve manufacturer Robertsons began in Paisley as a grocer whose wife started making marmalade from oranges in 1860. This product was successful and a factory was opened in Storie Street, Paisley, to produce it in 1866 and additional factories were later opened in Manchester, London and Bristol. The company was taken over by Rank Hovis McDougall who closed its Stevenson Street factory and transferred production to England in the 1970s. Brown and Polson was formed in Paisley in 1840 and two years later started producing starch for the weaving trades, by 1860 it was making food products including its patent cornflour. It later became CPC Foods Ltd, a subsidiary of Unilever, which produced Hellmann&#x27;s mayonnaise, Gerber baby foods and Knorr soups. The company ceased production in Paisley in 2002. The Piazza shopping centre was opened by Sean Connery in 1970 and has since been modernised several times.

In 1981 Peugeot Talbot, formerly Chrysler and before that Rootes, announced that its Linwood factory just outside Paisley would cease production. This led to the loss of almost 5,000 jobs. At one time M&amp;Co. (Mackays) had its head office in Caledonia House in Paisley. Paisley had several cinemas in the town, all of which have since closed, including the Palladium (closed 1960s), the Regal, the La Scala Picture House (the B listed art deco 1912 facade of the cinema is now the entrance to the Paisley Centre) and the Kelburne.

===21st century===
====Regeneration====
In 2015, the town launched its bid to become UK City of Culture in 2021. On 15 July 2017 Paisley was announced as one of five shortlisted candidates, On 7 December 2017 it lost to Coventry. Following the announcement, Renfrewshire Council and the Paisley 2021 Board stated that Paisley&#x27;s &quot;journey will continue&quot; and that the bid process was &quot;just the beginning&quot; for regeneration processes in the town.

Funding acquired during the City of Culture bid has led to multi-million pound regenerations for many of the town&#x27;s key attractions. This includes a £22million refurbishment to the Town Hall which reopened in October 2023, a new £7million Central Library and Learning Hub on the High Street which opened November 2023, and a £45million transformation of Paisley Museum due to be completed in late 2024. Renfrewshire Council also maintains its Townscape Heritage Initiative and Conservation Area Regeneration Scheme to provide grants to property owners in Paisley and the surrounding areas to carry out historic building repair and traditional shopfront reinstatement.

==Governance==
Paisley is the administrative centre for the council area of Renfrewshire Council, and also lies within the registration county of the same name. The town is divided into Community Councils for representation at the most local level.

Paisley in represented in the Scottish Parliament by George Adam MSP, who holds the Paisley seat. For the House of Commons of the United Kingdom the town is divided between two constituencies covering the whole of Renfrewshire: Paisley and Renfrewshire North (Alison Taylor MP) and Paisley and Renfrewshire South (Johanna Baxter MP).

==Public services==

Paisley lies within the Renfrewshire and Inverclyde Division of the Scottish police service and is one of three Area Commands in that division. Paisley is divided into five community policing areas: Paisley North-west (incorporating Glasgow Airport); Paisley South-west; Paisley East and Ralston; Paisley South; Gallowhill (as part of Renfrew and Gallowhill). Gallowhill is covered by the Renfrew Area Command. For judicial purposes, the area forms part of the sheriffdom of North Strathclyde and public prosecutions are directed by the Procurator Fiscal for Argyll and Clyde.

NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde is the National Health Service Board serving Paisley and the town&#x27;s main hospital with accident and emergency facilities is the Royal Alexandra Hospital. Strathclyde Fire and Rescue is the statutory fire and rescue service covering Paisley, with one community fire station on the town&#x27;s Canal Street.

Water and sewerage is provided in Paisley by Scottish Water, a public body, and water and sewerage charges are collected alongside council tax by Renfrewshire Council, the local authority, on its behalf. Renfrewshire Council is also responsible for the provision of waste management in the area. Paisley&#x27;s distribution network operator, the organisation licensed to transmit electricity from the National Grid to consumers, is Scottish Power.

==Geography and climate==

=== Geography ===
Paisley sits primarily on an expanse of low ground around 12 metres (40 ft) above sea level surrounding the White Cart Water, which runs through the town centre. There are some hills and ridges which have been absorbed as the town has expanded. The settlement is historically centred on Oakshaw, an area surrounding a hill to the north of the current High Street. Oakshaw is a conservation area, and on the high ground many of Paisley&#x27;s significant buildings can be found, such as the High Kirk, the Coats Observatory and the former John Neilson Institution, which was once a school and is now converted into residential flats.

Paisley expanded steadily, particularly in the Victorian and Edwardian eras, creating many suburbs. Castlehead is a wooded conservation area primarily made up of Victorian villas where many of the town&#x27;s leading industrialists made their homes in the late 19th century. Thornly Park is another conservation area, to the south of the town, just off Neilston Road toward Barrhead. It contains a variety of architecture ranging from mock Tudor to Art Deco. Many of the houses were designed by W. D. McLennan, a contemporary of Charles Rennie MacIntosh. McLennan also designed several local churches such as St Matthew&#x27;s Church.

Particularly following the Housing Act 1946, modern Paisley grew into the surrounding countryside, and several large residential areas were created in the post-war period. These include portions of Glenburn (south), Foxbar (south west), Ferguslie Park (north west), Gallowhill (North East) and Hunterhill (South East). Gockston in the far north of the town has many terraced houses, and after regeneration has many detached and semi-detached houses as well as several blocks of flats. Dykebar, to the south east of the town centre, is a residential area which is also the site of Dykebar Hospital, a secure psychiatric hospital. Local parks include Fountain Gardens and Barshaw Park.

On the outskirts of the town are a number of settlements such as Ralston, a residential area in the far east bordering the city of Glasgow. Ralston was outside the Paisley burgh boundary when constructed in the 1930s, but as a result of local authority reorganisation in the 1990s, it is now a suburb of Paisley.
=== Climate ===

==Economy==
Public sector organisations in Paisley include the headquarters of Renfrewshire Council, the largest campus of the University of the West of Scotland, the Paisley campus of West College Scotland and the Royal Alexandra Hospital.

Glasgow Airport, located on the northern edge of Paisley, is also a significant employer and part of the area&#x27;s transport infrastructure. The airline Loganair&#x27;s registered office is located within the airport complex.
Scotch whisky blenders and bottlers Chivas Brothers, now a subsidiary of Pernod Ricard, are also located in the town.

The site of the former Rootes/Chrysler/Talbot on the western outskirts of the town is now home to Phoenix Retail Park. Numerous private developers have invested, creating various retail outlets, vehicle showrooms, restaurants, a cinema complex, hotel and a business centre.

===Civic buildings===
As the administrative centre of the county of Renfrewshire, Renfrew District and, currently, Renfrewshire council area, Paisley is home to many significant civic buildings. Paisley Town Hall, adjacent to the Abbey, was funded by the will of George Aitken Clark, one of the Clark family, owners of the Anchor Mills. In competition, Sir Peter Coats funded the construction of the modern Paisley Museum and Central Library (1871), also in a neo-Classical style. The Clarks and Coats families dominated Paisley industry until their companies merged in 1896. Renfrewshire&#x27;s former County Buildings, Police Station and Jail on County Square were demolished in 1821, and the County Council then met in a newer neo-classical building, completed in 1890, which now houses Paisley Sheriff Court.

Renfrewshire House, the modern headquarters of Renfrewshire Council, was constructed as Paisley Civic Centre. Designed by Hutchison, Locke and Monk following a competition, the building was designed to house offices of both the county and town councils. It was intended to become a civic hub for Paisley but the absence of any shops and non-council premises prevented this from happening. It became the home of the Renfrew sub-region of Strathclyde Regional Council in 1975 and of Renfrewshire Council in 1996. It is listed by the conservation organisation DoCoMoMo as one of the sixty key Scottish monuments of the post-war period.

Other civic buildings of interest include the Russell Institute, an art deco building constructed in 1926.

===Religious sites===
 Most noticeable among the buildings of Paisley is its medieval Abbey in the centre of the town dating from the 12th century. The earliest surviving architecture is the south-east doorway in the nave from the cloister, which has a round arched doorway typical of Romanesque architecture which was the prevalent architectural style before the adoption of Gothic. The choir (east end) and tower date from the late 19th and early 20th centuries and are examples of Gothic Revival architecture. They were reconstructed in three main phases of restorations with the tower and choir conforming to the designs of Dr Peter MacGregor Chalmers. The roof in the nave is the most recent of restorations with the plaster ceiling by Rev Dr Boog which was added in the 1790s being replaced by a timber roof in 1981.
Former Thomas Coats Memorial Baptist Church, named for the industrialist Thomas Coats (1809–1883), is an example of Gothic Revival architecture. It dominates the town&#x27;s skyline with its crown spire more than high. Opened in 1894 and designed by Hippolyte Jean Blanc it was the largest Baptist church in Europe. The exterior is made of old red sandstone. Inside, the church is decorated with wood carvings, mosaic floors and marble fonts. The church also contains a 3040 pipe Hill Organ.

The St Mirin&#x27;s Cathedral in Incle Street is the seat of the Catholic Bishop of Paisley. The church was completed in 1931 to replace an earlier building, in nearby East Buchanan Street, which dated from 1808. The original St Mirin&#x27;s church was the first Catholic church to be built in Scotland since the Reformation. With the erection of the Diocese of Paisley in 1947 the church was raised to cathedral status.

St Matthew&#x27;s Church (Church of the Nazarene) at the junction of Gordon Street and Johnston Street is Art Nouveau in style. Designed by local architect William Daniel McLennan, a contemporary of Charles Rennie Mackintosh, it was built in 1905–07.

===Other===
Dating from circa 1160 Blackhall Manor is the oldest building in Paisley. It was given to the Burgh of Paisley by the Shaw-Stewart family in 1940, but was threatened with demolition in 1978. It was privately purchased in 1982 and fully restored as a private dwelling.
As a result of its historic textile industry, Paisley has many examples of Victorian industrial architecture. Most notable is the Category A listed Anchor Mills, built in 1886. The building was converted in 2005 into residential flats. Textiles have a longer history in Paisley, represented by the Sma&#x27; Shot cottages complex on Shuttle Street: a small public museum of weaving from its 18th-century origins as a cottage industry.

Another landmark connected with the textile industry is the Dooslan Stane or Stone. The stone was a meeting place of the Weavers Union in the south of Paisley; it was also used as a &quot;soapbox&quot; and was originally inscribed with its history (now largely faded). It was moved from its original site at the corner of Neilston Road and Rowan Street to its present location in Brodie Park. Also present, arranged around the Dooslan Stane, are the four original Paisley Tolbooth stones. The Dooslan Stane is still used today as the congregating point for the annual Sma&#x27; Shot parade which takes place on the first Saturday in July.

The High Street drill hall was completed in about 1896.

The composer Thomas Wilson&#x27;s 1988 work &quot;Passeleth Tapestry&quot; (later his Fourth Symphony) commemorates the history of Paisley in a single 30-minute movement. Commissioned by Renfrew District Council to mark Paisley&#x27;s 500th anniversary as a burgh of barony, it was premiered on 6 August 1988 in Paisley Abbey with the Royal Scottish National Orchestra under Bryden Thomson. It was subsequently recorded by the Royal Scottish National Orchestra with conductor Rory Macdonald on the Linn Record Label, and received critical acclaim by the Gramophone, which considered its orchestration as &quot;beguiling&quot;, but the string glissandos as &quot;kitsch&quot;.

==Transport==

Paisley is connected to the motorway network and the National Rail network, and contains Glasgow Airport within its boundaries.

Paisley is connected by road to the UK motorway network, with the M8 running along the northern edge of the town, Junctions 27, 28 and 29 providing access to Greenock to the west and Glasgow to the east. This forms part of the unsigned E05 Euroroute from Greenock to Gibraltar. Many major A roads converge through the town, including the A726, A737 and A761. The Strathclyde Partnership for Transport, a public body, has direct operational responsibilities covering the area, such as supporting (and in some cases running) local bus services in Paisley (Graham&#x27;s Bus Service) and across Strathclyde.

The town has four railway stations and is linked by rail to Glasgow city centre as well as Inverclyde and the Ayrshire coast. Paisley Gilmour Street is the largest of the stations and is also the fourth busiest train station in Scotland. There are also smaller stations at Paisley St James, Paisley Canal and Hawkhead. The rail links also connect to Glasgow Prestwick International Airport and ferry routes to Dunoon, the Isle of Arran, Isle of Bute and Northern Ireland. Over the years there have been thirteen railway stations in Paisley and three rail lines that are now closed (The Paisley and Barrhead District Railway, the Barrhead Branch of the GSWR, and the Paisley and Renfrew Railway). Paisley Canal station and the Paisley Canal Line owe their names to the Glasgow, Paisley and Johnstone Canal which occupied the route of the line until 1885, when it was filled in. The line reusues part of the Paisley Canal, which was the site of the Paisley canal disaster in 1810.

Glasgow Airport, operated by AGS Airports, is Scotland&#x27;s largest airport, located to the north of Paisley at Abbotsinch. It is adjacent to the M8 motorway and served by buses from Paisley Gilmour Street railway station. The planned Glasgow Airport Rail Link project, which was to run through Paisley, was abandoned in 2009. As mentioned above, Glasgow Prestwick Airport in Ayrshire is directly accessible by rail from Paisley Gilmour Street station.

==Education==

Paisley is the main site for the modern University of the West of Scotland, which was created from a merger between the University of Paisley and Bell College in Hamilton, South Lanarkshire. The University of Paisley was granted university status in 1992, having existed previously as a central institution known as Paisley College of Technology. The further education college West College Scotland has a campus in the town; this institution was previously known as Reid Kerr College.

There are currently four comprehensive state secondary schools in Paisley: Paisley Grammar School, Castlehead High School, St Andrew&#x27;s Academy, Paisley and Gleniffer High School. The oldest of these is Paisley Grammar which was founded in 1576 and was one of two former grammar schools in the town – alongside the former John Neilson Institution (latterly John Neilson High School) founded in 1852. Other former secondary schools in the area include Merksworth High School (to the north west of the town), St Mirin&#x27;s Academy or High School (on the west side of the town), St Aelred&#x27;s High School and Stanely Green High School (both on the south side of the town). Of the current secondary schools in the town, all are non-denominational save for St Andrew&#x27;s Academy which is a Roman Catholic school.

== Religion ==


Paisley is home to a number of religious denominations and is an important historical centre for the Christian faith in Scotland. The town&#x27;s historic patron saint is Saint Mirin (or Mirren); according to legendary accounts, Mirin settled in Paisley as a missionary sent from Ireland in the 6th century and was instrumental in bringing the relics of St Andrew to Scotland. Paisley Abbey, one of the town&#x27;s most significant landmarks, was constructed as a priory in the 12th century and raised to abbey status in the 13th. It served as an ecclesiastical centre for a wide area surrounding the county of Renfrewshire for centuries until the Reformation when such religious centres were reduced to the status of parish churches. For the Church of Scotland, Paisley forms part of the Presbytery of Clyde. (&quot;see: Church of Scotland synods and presbyteries&quot;).

Other Christian communities have a number of churches in Paisley, many of which were the result of the Industrial Revolution where people from around the British Isles came to Paisley for work. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Paisley, created in 1947, is centred upon the town&#x27;s St Mirin&#x27;s Cathedral, the seat of the Bishop of Paisley. Paisley also forms part of the Episcopalian (Anglican) Diocese of Glasgow and Galloway with its main facilities being contained at the Holy Trinity and St Barnabas Church in the town centre, a congregation which united in 2004. There are currently two Baptist congregations in Paisley: in addition to Thomas Coats Memorial Baptist Church (see under &quot;Landmarks – religious sites&quot;) is Central Baptist Church, which meets in nearby Lady Lane. Paisley is home to a meetinghouse of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints located on Glenburn Road.

Other smaller religious groups exist in the town. The Methodist Church of Great Britain has a church and central hall opposite Paisley Abbey which forms part of the Ayrshire and Renfrewshire Circuit. The Christadelphians meet in a hall on Alice Street.

==Media==
Paisley has one local daily newspaper, the Paisley Daily Express, which is owned by the Trinity Mirror Group. Various local radio stations have operated at times, including Q96 from 1992 to 2007 – serving the Renfrewshire area, although for a considerable period based in neighbouring Glasgow. Its replacement, Glasgow-based Guardian Media Group station 96.3 Rock Radio carries Renfrewshire focused material. In October 2011 Rock Radio, faced with falling advertising revenue, was rebranded by Guardian Media Group as Real Radio XS after a proposed management buyout failed to materialise.
Paisley has two local radio stations, Paisleyradio.com broadcasts from the centre of Paisley with a large online audience. Paisleyradio.com won the Prestige Scotland Radio Station of the Year award 3 times 2021/22, 2022/23 and 2023/24. In 2023 paisleyradio.com officially became the most successful radio station from Paisley with 8 media awards. 
Paisley FM broadcasts from the Grammar School, it covers Paisley, Renfrew and Johnstone.

==Sport==

St Mirren F.C. is Paisley&#x27;s sole professional association football team. As of 2018, it plays in the Scottish Premiership. In 2009, the team moved from their Love Street stadium to a new 8,029 capacity stadium, known formally as St Mirren Park, on Greenhill Road. The stadium was later renamed as The Paisley 2021 Stadium to mark the town&#x27;s bid to be UK City of Culture in 2021. St Mirren last won the Scottish Cup on 16 May 1987. The club won the Scottish League Cup for the first time in its history on 17 March 2013. Another professional football team, Abercorn F.C., was based in Paisley until its decline and liquidation in 1920.

St Mirren Basketball Club was formed in 1997: they have won the National League title once, in 2000, and have won the Scottish Cup three times (1999, 2002 and 2012).

Paisley RFC is an amateur rugby union club based at the Anchor Recreation Grounds in Paisley.

Kelburne Hockey Club is a local club which was founded in 1969.

==Notable people==

Historically, Paisley was notable as the religious home of the Stewart family who descended from Walter FitzAlan, the first High Steward of Scotland and founder of Paisley Abbey, eventually becoming the Scottish and British Royal Family. The Stewarts once resided at a castle in nearby Renfrew. All six of the High Stewards are buried in the Abbey, as is Marjorie Bruce – the eldest daughter of Robert I of Scotland (Robert the Bruce) – who married the 6th High Steward, thus founding the Stewart dynasty. The first Stewart King of Scotland and son of Marjorie Bruce and Walter Stewart, Robert II, is believed to have been born in the Abbey. His son Robert III is buried there.

Ronald Reagan&#x27;s maternal great-great-grandparents, Claude Wilson and Margaret Downey, were married at Paisley High Church on 23 May 1807.

<text>The Albert Einstein College of Medicine is a private medical school in New York City. Founded in 1953, Einstein is an independent degree-granting institution within the Montefiore Health System.
Einstein offers an M.D. program, a Ph.D. program in the biomedical sciences and clinical investigation, and two Master of Science (M.S.) degrees. Admission to Einstein&#x27;s MD program is among the most competitive in the United States, with an acceptance rate of 1.87% in 2024. Einstein also hosts one of the original three Medical Scientist Training Programs—which award MD/PhD degrees—to be awarded funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in 1964, and has received continuous funding since.
Einstein arose from plans by Yeshiva University president Samuel Belkin in the 1940s. Physicist Albert Einstein, who noted that the college would be &quot;unique&quot; as it would provide medical training to &quot;students of all creeds and races&quot;, lent his name to the school. Due to Yeshiva&#x27;s financial difficulties, Einstein was transferred to Montefiore in 2015. Following a $1 billion donation to the school by Ruth Gottesman in 2024, Einstein became tuition-free for all MD students.
The college includes several NIH-designated centers and has been the site of medicals feats such as the first coronary artery bypass surgery. Faculty members have included 18 members of the National Academy of Sciences, as well as neurologist and writer Oliver Sacks. Alumni have made significant scientific contributions and include seven members of the National Academy of Sciences, two Howard Hughes Medical Investigators, a MacArthur Fellow, and a National Medal of Science awardee.

==History==
===Founding===

As early as 1945, Yeshiva University president Samuel Belkin began planning a new medical school. Six years later, Belkin and New York City Mayor Vincent Impellitteri entered into an agreement to begin its construction with funding from Henry H. Minskoff and Phillip Stollman. 

Around the same time, physicist and humanitarian Albert Einstein sent a letter to Belkin. He remarked that such an endeavor would be &quot;unique&quot; in that the school would &quot;welcome students of all creeds and races&quot;. Two years later, on his 74th birthday, March 14, 1953, Einstein agreed to have his name attached to the medical school.

The first classes began September 12, 1955, with 56 students. Irving London was the founding chair of the department of medicine. Einstein was the first new medical school to open in New York City since 1897.

===Expansion===

The Sue Golding Graduate Division was established in 1957 to offer Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degrees in biomedical science. The Medical Scientist Training Program, a combined MD–PhD program, was established in 1964. The Clinical Research Training Program, which confers Master of Science degrees in clinical research methods, began in July 1998.

The world&#x27;s first coronary artery bypass surgery was performed May 2, 1960 at Einstein by a team led by Robert H. Goetz and the thoracic surgeon, Michael Rohman with the assistance of Jordan Haller and Ronald Dee.

The Ullmann Research Center for Health Sciences, a 12-story facility, opened in 1964. The following year, on behalf of the Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Foundation, Senator Robert F. Kennedy announced a $1.45 million donation to Einstein to establish a center to study human development and mental disabilities. The center, named for Rose F. Kennedy, had 200 staff scientists upon opening. In the late 20th century, neurology dean and Rose F. Kennedy Center faculty member Isabelle Rapin was instrumental in the recognition that autism is a spectrum disorder.

In 2002, the college opened the three-story Gruss Magnetic Resonance Research Center. Equipped with magnetic resonance equipment beyond conventional MRI, the center was the only such facility in the New York metropolitan area and one of six in the world, upon opening. In 2008, Einstein opened a $225 million research complex, the Price Center. This expansion doubled the size of Einstein&#x27;s campus to nearly 40 acres. Also that year, the college replaced its old logo—a &quot;staid&quot; portrait of Albert Einstein—with a stylized symbol that represents the helical structure of DNA, a notable spiral staircase on campus, and &quot;E&quot; for Einstein.

===Recent history===

In February 2015, Yeshiva University announced the transfer of ownership of Einstein to the Montefiore Health System, in order to eliminate a large deficit from the university&#x27;s financial statements. The medical school accounted for approximately two-thirds of the university&#x27;s annual operating deficits, which had reached about $100 million before the announcement. On September 9, 2015, the agreement between Yeshiva and Montefiore was finalized, and financial and operational control of Albert Einstein College of Medicine was transferred to Montefiore. Yeshiva University continued to grant Einstein&#x27;s degrees until 2018, as the medical school achieved independent degree-granting authority in the spring of 2019.

In February 2024, Ruth Gottesman, who had been a long-time professor at the medical school and is head of the board of trustees, donated $1 billion to the school to make free tuition available to all students in perpetuity. The donation was one of the largest to any educational insitution, and, according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, likely the largest donation to any medical school. One condition of the contribution was that Einstein never change its name.

== Student body ==
There are 183 first-year medical students in the Class of 2025. 9,773 people applied for seats, and 1,200 were interviewed. 60% of the class identify as women and 20% identify with groups underrepresented in medicine. Ages range from 21 to 34 with an average age of 23.5. 16% of students were born outside the United States and students come from 17 U.S. states.

==Academics==

=== MD program ===
Applicants are expected to demonstrate a solid foundation in science, but there is no strict requirement on which prerequisite courses must be taken. This &quot;competency-based&quot; approach also provides candidates greater flexibility, for example, by substituting laboratory experience gained, while employed, for laboratory and or course requirements taken in school, or by substituting online courses that free up time to pursue interests that enhance the applicant&#x27;s level of maturity and readiness for the medical profession.

=== Medical Scientist Training Program ===

Einstein&#x27;s Medical Scientist Training Program was one of the original three programs funded by the NIH in 1964, and has been funded continuously since then. The program is designed to train investigators who could bridge the gap between basic science and clinical research by providing integrated graduate and clinical training. Einstein&#x27;s program offers an integrated first-year curriculum covering both graduate and medical coursework. Second-year students complete the second year M.D. curriculum while working to select a Ph.D. thesis advisor. After performing one clinical clerkship, students commence their thesis research while completing any remaining coursework required for their graduate department. Students are expected to publish at least one first author, peer-reviewed paper. On average, students publish two first-author papers and four papers. After defending their dissertation, students complete the required clinical clerkships then have the opportunity to take &quot;fourth-year&quot; electives. While on dissertation status, students have the opportunity to attend a continuity clinic which ensures they stay in touch with patients and the clinical atmosphere.

Since the first graduating class in 1961, the Graduate Division of Biomedical Sciences has trained over 1600 students, including 400 M.D./Ph.D. students. The average time to complete the degree is 5.8 years, and students produce an average of four peer-reviewed papers and two first-author peer-reviewed papers. Students do not apply to a specific department, but rather to the Ph.D. program as a whole, permitting them to rotate across laboratories and disciplines to make an informed choice regarding their thesis laboratory.

=== Master&#x27;s degree programs ===

The Clinical Research Training Program, founded in 1998, leads to the awarding of the Master of Science in Clinical Research Methods. This program involves spending one year after clerkships and some elective time during the fourth year completing courses in clinical research methods and driving a mentor-guided research project that leads to two first-author manuscripts. This program is offered at no additional cost to medical students and fellowship stipends are available.

In partnership with The Cardozo School of Law, Einstein offers a Master of Science in Bioethics that focuses on transnational work in bioethics to help professionals improve care and communication.

=== PhD Program in Biomedical Sciences ===
Applicants apply directly to the PhD program, not to a specific department. This allows graduate students to gain exposure many areas of research before making an informed decision about the thesis work. There are more than 200 biomedical laboratories for students to choose.

=== PhD Program in Clinical Investigation ===
The Ph.D. concentration in Clinical Investigation provides advanced training that prepares students for an independent research career in clinical and translational science. It is offered for Ph.D. students enrolled in Einstein’s graduate division and for M.D./Ph.D. students in Einstein’s Medical Scientist Training Program.

==Affiliations==

=== Montefiore Health System ===
Einstein&#x27;s parent institute, Montefiore Health System, is a private healthcare system and one of the largest employers in New York. It comprises 15 member hospitals, including Montefiore Medical Center and Children&#x27;s Hospital at Montefiore, and more than 200 outpatient ambulatory care sites that provide coordinated, comprehensive care to patients and their families across the Bronx, Westchester and the Hudson Valley.

=== Jacobi Medical Center ===

Jacobi Medical Center, a public hospital adjacent to Einstein, provides healthcare for some 1.2 million Bronx and New York City area residents. Jacobi is the primary clerkship site for 3rd- and 4th-year medical students from Einstein.

== NIH-designated centers ==
The college hosts several NIH-designated centers:
* Montefiore Einstein Comprehensive Cancer Center
* Center for AIDS Research
* Diabetes Research Center
* Harold and Muriel Block Institute for Clinical and Translational Research at Einstein and Montefiore
* Institute for Aging Research
* Marion Bessin Liver Research Center
* New York Regional Center for Diabetes Translation Research
* Rose F. Kennedy Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center

==Notable people==

===Faculty===

As of 2025, Einstein had over 2,000 faculty members, yielding a faculty-student ratio of 2.6:1. Faculty members that have taught or are currently teaching at Einstein include 18 members of the National Academy of Sciences and 5 members of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. One faculty member—William R. Jacobs Jr.—has been a Howard Hughes Medical Investigator. In 1987, professor Harry Eagle was awarded the National Medal of Science for developing Eagle&#x27;s minimal essential medium (MEM), widely used for cell culture.

Neurologist and author Oliver Sacks taught at the college for over 40 years. His 1973 book &quot;Awakenings&quot;—documenting his work with encephalitis lethargica at Beth Abraham, a Montefiore hospital in the Bronx—was adapted into a 1990 film starring Robin Williams and Robert De Niro.

===Alumni===
Alumni of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine include seven elected members of the National Academy of Sciences, two Howard Hughes Medical Investigators, and five American Academy of Arts and Sciences members.

<text>Logos (, ; ) is a term used in Western philosophy, psychology and rhetoric, as well as religion (notably Christianity); among its connotations is that of a rational form of discourse that relies on inductive and deductive reasoning.

Aristotle first systematized the usage of the word, making it one of the three principles of rhetoric alongside ethos and pathos. This original use identifies the word closely to the structure and content of language or text. Both Plato and Aristotle used the term &quot;logos&quot; (along with &quot;rhema&quot;) to refer to sentences and propositions.

== Background ==

 is related to which is cognate with . The word derives from a Proto-Indo-European root, *leǵ-, which can have the meanings &quot;I put in order, arrange, gather, choose, count, reckon, discern, say, speak&quot;. In modern usage, it typically connotes the verbs &quot;account&quot;, &quot;measure&quot;, &quot;reason&quot; or &quot;discourse&quot;. It is occasionally used in other contexts, such as for &quot;ratio&quot; in mathematics.

== Origins of the term ==
&quot;Logos&quot; became a technical term in Western philosophy beginning with Heraclitus (), who used the term for a principle of order and knowledge. Ancient Greek philosophers used the term in different ways. The sophists used the term to mean &quot;discourse&quot;. Aristotle applied the term to refer to &quot;reasoned discourse&quot; or &quot;the argument&quot; in the field of rhetoric, and considered it one of the three modes of persuasion alongside &quot;ethos&quot; and &quot;pathos&quot;. Pyrrhonist philosophers used the term to refer to dogmatic accounts of non-evident matters. The Stoics spoke of the &quot;logos spermatikos&quot; (the generative principle of the Universe) which foreshadows related concepts in Neoplatonism.

Within Hellenistic Judaism, Philo () integrated the term into Jewish philosophy.
Philo distinguished between &quot;logos prophorikos&quot; (&quot;the utterer word or speaker&quot;), logos spermatikos(&quot;the speech&quot;) and the &quot;logos endiathetos&quot; (&quot;the word remaining within&quot;).

The Gospel of John identifies the Christian Logos, through which all things are made, as divine (&quot;theos&quot;), and further identifies Jesus Christ as the &quot;incarnate Logos&quot;. Early translators of the Greek New Testament, such as Jerome (in the 4th century AD), experienced frustration with the inadequacy of any single Latin word to convey the meaning of the word &quot;logos&quot; as used to describe Jesus Christ in the Gospel of John. The Vulgate Bible usage of was thus constrained to use the (perhaps inadequate) noun for &quot;word&quot;; later Romance language translations had the advantage of nouns such as in French. Reformation translators took another approach. Martin Luther rejected (verb) in favor of (word), for instance, although later commentators repeatedly turned to a more dynamic use involving &quot;the living word&quot; as used by Jerome and Augustine. The term is also used in Sufism, and the analytical psychology of Carl Jung.

Despite the conventional translation as &quot;word&quot;, &quot;logos&quot; is not used for a word in the grammatical sense—for that, the term &quot;lexis&quot; (, ) was used. However, both &quot;logos&quot; and &quot;lexis&quot; derive from the same verb (), meaning &quot;(I) count, tell, say, speak&quot;.

In the ancient Greek context, the term &quot;logos&quot; in the sense of &quot;word&quot; or &quot;discourse&quot; also contrasted with &quot;mythos&quot; (). Classical Greek usage sees reasoned argument (&quot;logos&quot;) as distinct from imaginative tales (&quot;mythos&quot;).

==Ancient Greek philosophy==
The writing of Heraclitus () was the first place where the word &quot;logos&quot; was given special attention in ancient Greek philosophy, although Heraclitus seems to use the word with a meaning not significantly different from the way in which it was used in ordinary Greek of his time. For Heraclitus, &quot;logos&quot; provided the link between rational discourse and the world&#x27;s rational structure.



What &quot;logos&quot; means here is not certain; it may mean &quot;reason&quot; or &quot;explanation&quot; in the sense of an objective cosmic law, or it may signify nothing more than &quot;saying&quot; or &quot;wisdom&quot;. Yet, an independent existence of a universal &quot;logos&quot; was clearly suggested by Heraclitus.

Following one of the other meanings of the word, Aristotle gave &quot;logos&quot; a different technical definition in the &quot;Rhetoric&quot;, using it as meaning argument from reason, one of the three modes of persuasion. The other two modes are &quot;pathos&quot; (, ), which refers to persuasion by means of emotional appeal, &quot;putting the hearer into a certain frame of mind&quot;; and &quot;ethos&quot; (, ), persuasion through convincing listeners of one&#x27;s &quot;moral character&quot;. According to Aristotle, &quot;logos&quot; relates to &quot;the speech itself, in so far as it proves or seems to prove&quot;. In the words of Paul Rahe:
&quot;Logos&quot;, &quot;pathos&quot;, and &quot;ethos&quot; can all be appropriate at different times. Arguments from reason (logical arguments) have some advantages, namely that data are (ostensibly) difficult to manipulate, so it is harder to argue against such an argument. On the other hand, trust in the speaker—built through &quot;ethos&quot;—enhances the appeal of arguments from reason.

Robert Wardy suggests that what Aristotle rejects in supporting the use of &quot;logos&quot; &quot;is not emotional appeal per se, but rather emotional appeals that have no &#x27;bearing on the issue&#x27;, in that the &quot;pathē&quot; [, ] they stimulate lack, or at any rate are not shown to possess, any intrinsic connection with the point at issue—as if an advocate were to try to whip an antisemitic audience into a fury because the accused is Jewish; or as if another in drumming up support for a politician were to exploit his listeners&#x27;s reverential feelings for the politician&#x27;s ancestors&quot;.

Aristotle comments on the three modes by stating:
Stoic philosophy began with Zeno of Citium , in which the &quot;logos&quot; was the active reason pervading and animating the Universe. It was conceived as material and is usually identified with God or Nature. The Stoics also referred to the &quot;seminal logos&quot; (&quot;&quot;logos spermatikos&quot;), or the law of generation in the Universe, which was the principle of the active reason working in inanimate matter. Humans, too, each possess a portion of the divine &quot;logos&quot;.

The Stoics took all activity to imply a &quot;logos&quot; or spiritual principle. As the operative principle of the world, the &quot;logos&quot; was &quot;anima mundi&quot; to them, a concept which later influenced Philo of Alexandria, although he derived the contents of the term from Plato. In his Introduction to the 1964 edition of Marcus Aurelius&#x27; &quot;Meditations&quot;, the Anglican priest Maxwell Staniforth wrote that &quot;Logos&quot; ... had long been one of the leading terms of Stoicism, chosen originally for the purpose of explaining how deity came into relation with the universe&quot;.

Public discourse on ancient Greek rhetoric has historically emphasized Aristotle&#x27;s appeals to &quot;logos&quot;, &quot;pathos&quot;, and &quot;ethos&quot;, while less attention has been directed to Isocrates&#x27; teachings about philosophy and &quot;logos&quot;, and their partnership in generating an ethical, mindful &quot;polis&quot;. Isocrates does not provide a single definition of &quot;logos&quot; in his work, but Isocratean &quot;logos&quot; characteristically focuses on speech, reason, and civic discourse. He was concerned with establishing the &quot;common good&quot; of Athenian citizens, which he believed could be achieved through the pursuit of philosophy and the application of &quot;logos&quot;.

==In Hellenistic Judaism==
===Philo of Alexandria===
Philo (), a Hellenized Jew, used the term &quot;logos&quot; to mean an intermediary divine being or demiurge. Philo followed the Platonic distinction between imperfect matter and perfect Form, and therefore intermediary beings were necessary to bridge the enormous gap between God and the material world. The &quot;logos&quot; was the highest of these intermediary beings, and was called by Philo &quot;the first-born of God&quot;.
Philo also wrote that &quot;the Logos of the living God is the bond of everything, holding all things together and binding all the parts, and prevents them from being dissolved and separated&quot;.

Plato&#x27;s Theory of Forms was located within the &quot;logos&quot;, but the &quot;logos&quot; also acted on behalf of God in the physical world. In particular, the Angel of the Lord in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) was identified with the &quot;logos&quot; by Philo, who also said that the &quot;logos&quot; was God&#x27;s instrument in the creation of the Universe.

===Targums===
The concept of &quot;logos&quot; also appears in the Targums (Aramaic translations of the Hebrew Bible dating to the first centuries AD), where the term &quot;memra&quot; (Aramaic for &quot;word&quot;) is often used instead of &#x27;the Lord&#x27;, especially when referring to a manifestation of God that could be construed as anthropomorphic.

==Christianity==

In Christology, the Logos () is a name or title of Jesus Christ, seen as the preeminent expression in fulness of all the attributes, the complete thought, and the entire &quot;knowable&quot; reality of the infinite and spiritually transcendent Godhead. The concept derives from John 1:1, which in the Douay–Rheims, King James, New International, and other versions of the Bible, reads:
==Gnosticism==
According to the Gnostic scriptures recorded in the Holy Book of the Great Invisible Spirit, the Logos is an emanation of the great spirit that is merged with the spiritual Adam called Adamas.

==Neoplatonism==

Neoplatonist philosophers such as Plotinus (270 AD) used &quot;logos&quot; in ways that drew on Plato and the Stoics, but the term &quot;logos&quot; was interpreted in different ways throughout Neoplatonism, and similarities to Philo&#x27;s concept of &quot;logos&quot; appear to be accidental. The &quot;logos&quot; was a key element in the meditations of Plotinus regarded as the first neoplatonist. Plotinus referred back to Heraclitus and as far back as Thales in interpreting &quot;logos&quot; as the principle of meditation, existing as the interrelationship between the hypostases—the soul, the intellect (&quot;nous&quot;), and the One.

Plotinus used a trinity concept that consisted of &quot;The One&quot;, the &quot;Spirit&quot;, and &quot;Soul&quot;. The comparison with the Christian Trinity is inescapable, but for Plotinus these were not equal and &quot;The One&quot; was at the highest level, with the &quot;Soul&quot; at the lowest. For Plotinus, the relationship between the three elements of his trinity is conducted by the outpouring of &quot;logos&quot; from the higher principle, and &quot;eros&quot; (loving) upward from the lower principle. Plotinus relied heavily on the concept of &quot;logos&quot;, but no explicit references to Christian thought can be found in his works, although there are significant traces of them in his doctrine. Plotinus specifically avoided using the term &quot;logos&quot; to refer to the second person of his trinity. However, Plotinus influenced Gaius Marius Victorinus, who then influenced Augustine of Hippo. Centuries later, Carl Jung acknowledged the influence of Plotinus in his use of the term.

Victorinus differentiated between the &quot;logos&quot; interior to God and the &quot;logos&quot; related to the world by creation and salvation.

Augustine of Hippo, often seen as the father of medieval philosophy, was also greatly influenced by Plato and is famous for his re-interpretation of Aristotle and Plato in the light of early Christian thought. A young Augustine experimented with, but failed to achieve ecstasy using the meditations of Plotinus. In his &quot;Confessions&quot;, Augustine described &quot;logos&quot; as the &quot;Divine Eternal Word&quot;, by which he, in part, was able to motivate the early Christian thought throughout the Hellenized world (of which the Latin speaking West was a part) Augustine&#x27;s &quot;logos&quot; &quot;had taken body&quot; in Christ, the man in whom the &quot;logos&quot; (i.e. or ) was present as in no other man.

==Islam==

The concept of the &quot;logos&quot; also exists in Islam, where it was definitively articulated primarily in the writings of the classical Sunni mystics and Islamic philosophers, as well as by certain Shi&#x27;a thinkers, during the Islamic Golden Age. In Sunni Islam, the concept of the &quot;logos&quot; has been given many different names by the denomination&#x27;s metaphysicians, mystics, and philosophers, including &quot;ʿaql&quot; (&quot;Intellect&quot;), &quot;al-insān al-kāmil&quot; (&quot;Universal Man&quot;), &quot;kalimat Allāh&quot; (&quot;Word of God&quot;), &quot;haqīqa muḥammadiyya&quot; (&quot;The Muhammadan Reality&quot;), and &quot;nūr muḥammadī&quot; (&quot;The Muhammadan Light&quot;).

===&quot;ʿAql&quot;===

One of the names given to a concept very much like the Christian Logos by the classical Muslim metaphysicians is &quot;ʿaql&quot;, which is the &quot;Arabic equivalent to the Greek (intellect).&quot; In the writings of the Islamic neoplatonist philosophers, such as al-Farabi () and Avicenna (d. 1037), the idea of the &quot;ʿaql&quot; was presented in a manner that both resembled &quot;the late Greek doctrine&quot; and, likewise, &quot;corresponded in many respects to the Logos Christology.&quot;

The concept of &quot;logos&quot; in Sufism is used to relate the &quot;Uncreated&quot; (God) to the &quot;Created&quot; (humanity). In Sufism, for the Deist, no contact between man and God can be possible without the &quot;logos&quot;. The &quot;logos&quot; is everywhere and always the same, but its personification is &quot;unique&quot; within each region. Jesus and Muhammad are seen as the personifications of the &quot;logos&quot;, and this is what enables them to speak in such absolute terms.

One of the boldest and most radical attempts to reformulate the neoplatonic concepts into Sufism arose with the philosopher Ibn Arabi, who traveled widely in Spain and North Africa. His concepts were expressed in two major works &quot;The Ringstones of Wisdom&quot; (&quot;Fusus al-Hikam&quot;) and &quot;The Meccan Illuminations&quot; (&quot;Al-Futūḥāt al-Makkiyya&quot;). To Ibn Arabi, every prophet corresponds to a reality which he called a &quot;logos&quot; (&quot;Kalimah&quot;), as an aspect of the unique divine being. In his view the divine being would have for ever remained hidden, had it not been for the prophets, with &quot;logos&quot; providing the link between man and divinity.

Ibn Arabi seems to have adopted his version of the &quot;logos&quot; concept from neoplatonic and Christian sources, although (writing in Arabic rather than Greek) he used more than twenty different terms when discussing it. For Ibn Arabi, the &quot;logos&quot; or &quot;Universal Man&quot; was a mediating link between individual human beings and the divine essence.

Other Sufi writers also show the influence of the neoplatonic &quot;logos&quot;. In the 15th century Abd al-Karīm al-Jīlī introduced the &quot;Doctrine of Logos and the Perfect Man&quot;. For al-Jīlī, the &quot;perfect man&quot; (associated with the &quot;logos&quot; or the Prophet) has the power to assume different forms at different times and to appear in different guises.

In Ottoman Sufism, Şeyh Gâlib (d. 1799) articulates Sühan (&quot;logos&quot;-&quot;Kalima&quot;) in his &quot;Hüsn ü Aşk&quot; (&quot;Beauty and Love&quot;) in parallel to Ibn Arabi&#x27;s Kalima. In the romance, &quot;Sühan&quot; appears as an embodiment of Kalima as a reference to the Word of God, the Perfect Man, and the Reality of Muhammad.

==Jung&#x27;s analytical psychology==

Carl Jung contrasted the critical and rational faculties of &quot;logos&quot; with emotional, non-reason oriented and mythical elements. In Jung&#x27;s approach, &quot;logos&quot; vs &quot;eros&quot; can be represented as &quot;science vs mysticism&quot;, or &quot;reason vs imagination&quot; or &quot;conscious activity vs the unconscious&quot;.

For Jung, &quot;logos&quot; represented the masculine principle of rationality, in contrast to its feminine counterpart, &quot;eros&quot;:
==Rhetoric==
Author and professor Jeanne Fahnestock describes &quot;logos&quot; as a &quot;premise&quot;. She states that, to find the reason behind a rhetor&#x27;s backing of a certain position or stance, one must acknowledge the different &quot;premises&quot; that the rhetor applies via his or her chosen diction. The rhetor&#x27;s success, she argues, will come down to &quot;certain objects of agreement...between arguer and audience&quot;.

==Rhema==
The word &quot;logos&quot; has been used in different senses along with &quot;rhema&quot;. Both Plato and Aristotle used the term &quot;logos&quot; along with &quot;rhema&quot; to refer to sentences and propositions.

The Septuagint translation of the Hebrew Bible into Greek uses the terms &quot;rhema&quot; and &quot;logos&quot; as equivalents and uses both for the Hebrew word &quot;dabar&quot;, as the Word of God.

Some modern usage in Christian theology distinguishes &quot;rhema&quot; from &quot;logos&quot; (which here refers to the written scriptures) while &quot;rhema&quot; refers to the revelation received by the reader from the Holy Spirit when the Word (&quot;logos&quot;) is read, although this distinction has been criticized.

== History ==
=== Origins ===
While attending (and later leading) the Freewill Baptist Parsonsfield Seminary, Bates founder, Oren Burbank Cheney worked for racial and gender equality, religious freedom, and temperance. In 1836, Cheney enrolled in Dartmouth College (after briefly attending Brown), due to Dartmouth&#x27;s significant support of the abolitionist cause against slavery. After graduating, Cheney was ordained a Baptist minister and began to establish himself as an educational and religious scholar. Parsonsfield mysteriously burned down in 1854, allegedly due to arson by opponents of abolition. The event caused Cheney to advocate for the building of a new seminary in a more central part of Maine. With Cheney&#x27;s influence in the state legislature, the Maine State Seminary was chartered in 1855 and implemented a liberal arts and theological curriculum, making the first coeducational college in New England. Soon after establishment several donors stepped forward to finance portions of the school, such as Seth Hathorn, who donated the first library and academic building, which was renamed Hathorn Hall. The Cobb Divinity School became affiliated with the college in 1866. Four years later in 1870, Bates sponsored a college preparatory school, called the Nichols Latin School. The college was affected by the financial panic of the later 1850s and required additional funding to remain operational. Cheney&#x27;s impact in Maine was noted by Boston business magnate Benjamin Bates who developed an interest in the college. Bates gave $100,000 in personal donations and overall contributions valued at $250,000 to the college. The school was renamed Bates College in his honor in 1863 and was chartered to offer a liberal arts curriculum beyond its original theological focus. Two years later the college would graduate the first woman to receive a college degree in New England, Mary Mitchel. The college began instruction with a six-person faculty tasked with the teaching of moral philosophy and the classics. From its inception, Bates College served as an alternative to a more traditional and historically conservative Bowdoin College. There is a complex relationship between the two colleges, revolving around socioeconomic class, academic quality, and collegiate athletics.
The college, under the direction of Cheney, rejected fraternities and sororities on grounds of unwarranted exclusivity. He asked his close friend and U.S. Senator Charles Sumner to create a collegiate motto for Bates and he suggested the Latin phrase &quot;amore ac studio&quot; which he translated as &quot;with love for learning&quot; which has been taken as &quot;with ardor and devotion,&quot; or &quot;through zeal and study.&quot; Prior to the start of the American Civil War, Bates graduated Brevet Major Holman Melcher, who served in the Union Army in the 20th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment. He was the first person to charge down Little Round Top at the Battle of Gettysburg. The college graduated the last surviving Union general of the American Civil War, Aaron Daggett. The college&#x27;s first African-American student, Henry Chandler, graduated in 1874. James Porter, one of General Custer&#x27;s eleven officers killed at the Battle of Little Bighorn in 1876 was also a Bates graduate. In 1884, the college graduated the first woman to argue in front of the U.S. Supreme Court, Ella Haskell.

=== 20th century ===

In 1894, George Colby Chase led Bates to increased national recognition, and the college graduated one of the founding members of the Boston Red Sox, Harry Lord. In 1920, the Bates Outing Club was founded and is one of the oldest collegiate outing clubs in the country, the first at a private college to include both men and women from inception, and one of the few outing clubs that remain entirely student run. The debate society of Bates College, the Brooks Quimby Debate Council, became the first college debate team in the United States to compete internationally, and is the oldest collegiate coeducational debate team in the United States. In February 1920, the debate team defeated Harvard College during the national debate tournament held at Lewiston City Hall. In 1921, the college&#x27;s debate team participated in the first intercontinental collegiate debate in history against the Oxford Union&#x27;s debate team at the University of Oxford. Oxford&#x27;s first debate in the United States was against Bates in Lewiston, in September 1923. In addition during this time, numerous academic buildings were constructed throughout the 1920s. In 1943, the V-12 Navy College Training Program was introduced at Bates. Bates maintained a considerable female student body and &quot;did not suffer [lack in student enrollment due to military service involvement] as much as male-only institutions such as Bowdoin and Dartmouth.&quot; During the war, a victory ship was named the SS &quot;Bates Victory&quot;, after the college. It was during this time future U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy enrolled along with hundreds of other sailor-students. The rise of social inequality and elitism at Bates is most associated with the 1940s, with an increase in racial and socioeconomic homogeneity. The college began to garner a reputation for predominately educating white students who come from upper-middle-class to affluent backgrounds. &quot;The New York Times&quot; detailed the atmosphere of the college in the 1960s with the following: &quot;the prestigious Bates College—named for Benjamin E. Bates, whose riverfront mill on Canal Street in Lewiston was once Maine&#x27;s largest employer—provided an antithesis: a leafy oasis of privilege. In the 1960s, it was really difficult for most Bates students to integrate in the community because most of the people spoke French and lived a hard life.&quot;During this time the college began to compete athletically with Colby College, and in 1964, with Bowdoin created the Colby-Bates-Bowdoin Consortium. In 1967, President Thomas Hedley Reynolds promoted the idea of teacher-scholars at Bates and secured the construction of numerous academic and recreational buildings. In 1984, Bates became one of the first liberal arts colleges to make the SAT and ACT optional in the admission process. Reynolds began the Chase Regatta in 1988, which features the President&#x27;s Cup that is contested by Bates, Colby, and Bowdoin annually. In 1989, Donald West Harward became president of Bates and greatly expanded the college&#x27;s overall infrastructure by building 22 new academic, residential and athletic facilities, including Pettengill Hall, the Residential Village, and the Coastal Center at Shortridge. During the 1990s (and mid-2000s), Bates consolidated its reputation of being a &quot;playground for the elite&quot;, by educating upper-middle-class to affluent Americans, which led to student protests and reforms to make the college more diverse both racially, and socioeconomically.

=== 21st century ===
Elaine Tuttle Hansen was elected as the first female president of Bates College and managed the second-largest capital campaign ever undertaken by Bates, totaling $120 million and lead the endowment through the 2007–2008 financial crisis. The college announced her retirement in 2011, appointing Nancy Cable as interim president, to serve through June 30, 2012, while the college conducted a national search for its eighth president. In 2011, Bates made national headlines for being named the most expensive college in the U.S., which caused backlash from American academia and students as it indirectly highlighted substantial socioeconomic inequality among students.

After a year-long search for the next president, Harvard University dean, Clayton Spencer, was appointed as Hansen&#x27;s successor. Spencer assumed the presidency in 2012, and created diversity mandates, expanded student and faculty recruitment, and financial aid allocation. While some reforms were successful, minorities at the college, typically classified as non-white and low-income students, still reported a lack of safe spaces, insensitive professors, financial insecurity, indirect racism and social elitism. According to a 2017 article on income inequality by &quot;The New York Times&quot;, 18% of Bates students came from the 1% of the American upper class (families who made about $525,000 or more per year), with more than half coming from the top 5% (families who made about $110,000 or more per year). According to the &quot;Portland Press Herald&quot;, Michael Bonney &#x27;80 and his wife donated $50 million to the college in support of the $300 million &quot;Bates+You&quot; fundraising campaign launched in May 2017. The campaign is the largest ever undertaken by the college totaling $300 million, with $168 million already raised . In the aftermath of the 2019 college admissions bribery scandal, Ron Lieber of &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted that need-aware colleges like Bates and others prioritized students who could pay full tuition in the admission process, writing that, &quot;you can get help if you&#x27;re admitted, but you might not be admitted if you need help.&quot; Though it has a large endowment, Bates has continued to struggle to set a fee schedule that students can afford. Garry Jenkins succeeded Spencer in 2023, becoming the first black president of the college.

== Academics ==
Bates is a private baccalaureate liberal arts college that offers 36 departmental and interdisciplinary program majors and 25 secondary concentrations, and confers Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) and Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degrees. The college enrolls 1,792 students, 200 of whom study abroad each semester. The academic year is broken up into three terms, primary, secondary, and short term, also known as the 4–4–1 academic calendar. This includes two semesters, plus a Short Term consisting of five weeks in the Spring, in which only one class is taken and in-depth coursework is commonplace. Two Short Terms are required for graduation, with a maximum of three.

The largest natural science academic department at Bates College is the biology department, followed by mathematics, physics, and geology. The social science academic department with the highest number of majors is its economics department, followed by psychology, politics, and history.

=== Teaching and learning ===

Students at Bates take a first-year seminar, which provides a template for the rest of the four years at Bates. The student selects a specific topic offered by the college, and works together in a small class with a scholar-in-field professor of that topic, to study and critically analyze the subject. All first-year seminars place importance on writing ability, and composition in order to facilitate the process of complex and fluid ideas being put down on paper. Seminars range from constitutional analysis to mathematical theorizing to disturbance ecology. After three complete years at Bates, each student participates in a senior thesis or capstone that demonstrates expertise and overall knowledge of the Major, Minor or General Education Concentrations (GECs). The Senior Thesis is an intensive program that begins with the skills taught in the first-year program and concludes with a compiled thesis that stresses research and innovation.

A feature of a Bates education is the Honors Program which includes a tutorial-based thesis modeled after the universities of Oxford and Cambridge.

=== Research and faculty ===
According to the U.S. National Science Foundation, the college received $1.15 million in grants, fellowships, and R&amp;D stipends for research. The college spent $1,584,000 in 2014 on research and development. The Bates Student Research Fund was established for students completing independent research or capstones. STEM grants are offered to students in the science, engineering, technology and mathematics fields who wish to showcase their research at professional conferences or national laboratories. Independent research grants from the college can range from $300 to over $200,000 for a three-year research program depending on donor or agency. The college&#x27;s Harward Center is its main research entity for community-based research and offers fellowships to students. According to a 2001 study, Bates College&#x27;s economics department was the most cited liberal arts department in the United States. 

Bates College has been the site of landmark experiments and academic movements. In chemistry, the college has played an important role in shaping ideas about inorganic chemistry and is considered the birthplace of inorganic photochemistry as its early manifestations were started at the college by 1943 alumnus George Hammond who was later dubbed &quot;the father of the movement&quot;. Hammond would go on to invent Hammond&#x27;s postulate, revolutionizing activation levels in chemical compounds. In physics, 1974 alumnus Steven Girvin credited his time at the college as pivotal in his development of the fractional quantum Hall effect, now a pillar in Hall conductance. During the development and production of the first nuclear weapons during World War II, two students researching nuclear chemistry at the college were hired by the United States Army Corps of Engineers as part of the first Manhattan project scientific team.

Atop the Carnegie Science Hall sits Stephens Observatory which houses the college&#x27;s high-powered 12-inch Newtonian reflecting telescope. The telescope is used for research by the college, local government agencies, and other educational institutions. The Observatory is also home to an eight-inch Celestron, a six-inch Meade starfinder, and the only Coronado Solarmax II 60 in the state.

, Bates has a faculty of 190 and a student body of 1,780 creating a 10:1 student-faculty ratio and the average class size is about fifteen students. All tenured faculty possess the highest degree in their field. Full-time professors at the college received an average total compensation of $123,066, with salaries and benefits varying from field to field and position to position, putting faculty pay in the top 17% of all public and private universities.

=== Mount David Summit ===
The college holds the annual Mount David Summit which serves as a platform for students of all years to present undergraduate research, creative art, performance, and various other academic projects and is named after the campus&#x27; Mount David. Presentations at the summit include various discipline-centered projects, themed panel discussions, films Q &amp; A&#x27;s, as well as other activities in the Lewiston area. Started in 2002, the summit is held in Pettengill Hall, and on April 1, 2016, held its 15th summit.

== Admissions ==

During the 2018–19 admission rounds, Bates accepted seven transfer students from 205 applicants, yielding a 3.4% transfer acceptance rate. The college has had years where no transfer applicants were accepted, such as in 2016–17, where all 170 applicants failed to gain admission. The college had its highest admit rate during the 2008–2009 year, accepting 30.4% of applicants.

The average high school GPA for the class of 2019 was an unweighted 3.71. The average SAT Score was 2135 (715 Critical Reasoning, 711 Mathematics and 709 Writing), and the average ACT score range was 28 to 32. Bates has a Test Optional Policy, which gives the applicant the choice to not send in their standardized test scores. Bates&#x27; non-submitting students averaged only 0.05 points lower on their collegiate grade point average. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; found that Bates had some of the &quot;toughest rejection letters&quot; in the U.S. during the late-2000s. The college later apologized and issued a statement assuring that it makes an effort to &quot;[deny] the student&#x27;s application… not [reject] the student&quot;.

=== Cost of attendance and financial aid ===

For the 2016–17 academic year, Bates charged a comprehensive price (tuition, room and board, and associated fees) of $66,550. The college&#x27;s tuition is the same for in-state and out-of-state students. Bates practices need-blind admission for students who are U.S. citizens, permanent residents, DACA status students, undocumented students, or who graduate from a high school within the United States, and meets all of the demonstrated need for all admitted students, including admitted international students.

Bates does not offer merit or athletic scholarships. Bates is often the most expensive school to attend in its athletic conference. It has the second-lowest percentage of Pell Grant recipients in the United States, below only Fairfield University.

The college is also known as one of the Hidden Ivies, which includes much larger research universities such as Johns Hopkins and Stanford University. The 2025 annual ranking by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked Bates tied for 26th overall best liberal arts college in the nation. &quot;Forbes&quot; ranked Bates 80th in its 2025 national rankings of 500 U.S. colleges, universities and service academies, and 20th among liberal arts colleges.

== Campus ==

Bates is in a former mill town, Lewiston, which has a large French Canadian ethnic presence due to migration from Quebec in the 19th century. The college is known for cultural strains with the town, with townspeople describing Bates as a &quot;leafy oasis of privilege.&quot; The overall architectural design of the college can be traced through the Colonial Revival architecture movement, and has distinctive Neoclassical, Georgian, Colonial, and Gothic features. The earliest buildings of the college were directly designed by Boston architect Gridley J.F. Bryant, and subsequent buildings follow his overall architectural template. Colonial restoration influence can be seen in the architecture of certain buildings, however many of the off campus houses&#x27; architecture was heavily influenced by the Victorian era. Many buildings on campus share design parallels with Dartmouth College, University of Cambridge, Yale University, and Harvard University.

Bates has a 133-acre main campus and maintains the 600-acre Bates-Morse Mountain Conservation Area, as well as an 80-acre Coastal Center fresh water habitat at Shortridge. The eastern campus is situated around Lake Andrews, where many residential halls are located. The quad of the campus connects academic buildings, athletics arenas, and residential halls. Bates College houses over 1 million volumes of articles, papers, subscriptions, audio/video items and government articles among all three libraries and all academic buildings. The George and Helen Ladd Library houses 620,000 cataloged volumes, 2,500 serial subscriptions and 27,000 audio/video items. Coram Library houses almost 200,000 volumes of articles, subscriptions and audio/video items. 

The most notable items in the library&#x27;s collection include copies of the original Constitution of Maine, personal correspondence of James K. Polk and Hannibal Hamlin, original academic papers of Henry Clay, personal documents of Edmund Muskie, original printings of newspaper articles written by James G. Blaine, and selected collections of other prominent religious, political and economic figures, both in Maine, and the United States.

The campus provides 33 Victorian Houses, 9 residential halls, and one residential village. The college maintains 12 academic buildings with Lane Hall serving as the administration building on campus. Lane Hall houses the offices of the president, dean of the faculty, registrar, and provost, among others.

=== Olin Arts Center ===
The Olin Arts Center maintains three teaching sound proof studios, five class rooms, five seminar rooms, ten practice rooms with pianos, and a 300-seat grand recital hall. It holds the college&#x27;s Steinway concert grand piano, Disklavier, William Dowd harpsichord, and their 18th-century replica forte piano. The studios are modernized with computers, synthesizers, and various recording equipment. The center houses the departments of Art and Music, and was given to Bates by the F. W. Olin Foundation in 1986. The center has had numerous Artists in Residence, such as Frank Glazer, and Leyla McCalla. The Olin Arts Center has joined with the Maine Music Society to produce musical performances throughout Maine.

=== Museum of Art ===
Founded in 1955, the Bates College Museum of Art holds contemporary and historic pieces. In the 1930s, the college secured a private holding from the Museum of Modern Art of Vincent van Gogh&#x27;s Starry Night, for students participating in the &#x27;Bates Plan&#x27;. It holds 5,000 pieces and objects of contemporary domestic and international art. The museum holds over 100 original artworks, photographs and sketches from Marsden Hartley. The MoA offers numerous lectures, artist symposiums, and workshops. The entire space is split into three components, the larger Upper Gallery, smaller Lower Gallery, and the Synergy Gallery which is primarily used for student exhibits and research. Almost 20,000 visitors are attracted to the MoA annually.

=== Bates-Morse Mountain Area ===
This conservation area of 600 acres is available to Bates students for academic, extracurricular, and research purposes. This area is mainly salt marshes and coastal uplands. The college participates in preserving the plants, animals and natural ecosystems within this area as a part of their Community-Engaged Learning Program. Due to its overall size, the site is frequently used by other Maine schools such as Bowdoin College for their Nordic Skiing practices.

== Student life ==
In 2015, the college&#x27;s dining program was ranked 6th by &quot;The Princeton Review,&quot; and 8th by Niche in the United States. The college&#x27;s dining services received the grade of &#x27;A+&#x27; by Niche in 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017. The college holds one main dining area and offers two floors of seating.

Among those is the competitive eating club, the Fat Cats, Ultimate Frisbee, and the student government. The largest club is the Outing Club, which leads canoeing, kayaking, rafting, camping and backpacking trips throughout Maine. Although Bates has since conception rejected fraternities and sororities, various social groups exist.

=== Student media ===
==== The Bates Student ====

Bates College&#x27;s oldest operating newspaper is &quot;The Bates Student&quot;, created in 1873. It is one of the oldest continuously published college weeklies in the United States, and the oldest co-ed college weekly in the country. Alumni of the student media programs at Bates have won the Pulitzer Prize, and have their later work featured on major news sources. It circulates approximately 1,900 copies around the campus and Lewiston area. Since 1990, there has been an electronic version of the newspaper online. The newspaper provides access free of charge to a searchable database of articles stretching back to its inception on its website. In 2021, the college administration requested the student newspaper to retract an article that focused on the ongoing unionization among faculty staff members and replace it with an article that also included anti-union arguments. Some students accused the administration of censorship over this issue.

==== WRBC ====
WRBC is the college radio station of Bates College and was first aired in 1958. Originally started as an AM station at Bates, it began with the efforts of rhetoric professor and debate coach Brooks Quimby. It is ranked by the 2015 &quot;Princeton Review&quot; as the 12th-best college radio station in the United States and Canada, making it the top college radio in the New England Small College Athletic Conference.

=== A cappella ===
There are five auditioned a cappella groups on campus. The Deansmen and the Manic Optimists are all-male, the Merminaders are all-female, and the co-ed groups are known as TakeNote and the CrossTones.

=== Brooks Quimby Debate Council ===

The formation of the team predates the establishment of the college itself as the debate society was founded within the Maine State Seminary making it the oldest coeducational college debate society in the United States. It was headed by Bates alumnus and teacher Brooks Quimby and became the first intercollegiate international debate team in the United States. The Quimby Debate Society has been noted as &quot;America&#x27;s most prestigious debating society,&quot; and the &quot;playground of the powerful.&quot; During the 1930s, the debate society was subject to &#x27;The Quimby Institute&#x27; which pitted every debate student against Brooks Quimby himself. This is where he began to engage in heated debate with them that stressed &quot;flawless assertions&quot; and resulted in every error made by the student to be carefully scrutinized and teased. Bates has an annual and traditional debate with Oxford, Cambridge and Dartmouth College. It competes in the American Parliamentary Debate Association domestically, and competes in the World Universities Debating Championships, internationally. The debate council was ranked 5th nationally in 2013, the year prior year ranking 9th in the world.
=== Traditions ===
==== Ivy Day ====
The class graduates participate in an Ivy Day which installs a granite placard onto one of the academic or residential buildings on campus. They serve as a symbol of the class and their respective history both academically and socially. Some classes donate to the college, in the form of gates, facades, and door outlines, by inscribing or creating their own version of symbolic icons of the college&#x27;s seal or other prominent insignia. This usually occurs on graduation day, but may occur on later dates with alumni returning to the campus. This tradition is shared with the University of Pennsylvania and Princeton University. On Ivy Day, members of Phi Beta Kappa are announced.

==== Winter Carnival ====
This tradition is nearly a century old. The college has held, on odd to even years, a Winter Carnival which comprises a themed four-day event that includes performances, dances, and games. Past Winter Carnivals have included &quot;a Swiss Olympic skier swooshing down Mount David&quot;, faculty and student football games, faculty and administration skits, oversized snow sculptures, &quot;serenading of the dormitories&quot;, and expeditions to Camden. When alumnus Edmund Muskie was governor, he participated in a torch relay from Augusta to Lewiston in celebration of the 1960 Winter Olympics.

Robert F. Kennedy, with his naval classmates, built a replica of their boat back in Massachusetts out of snow in front of Smith Hall, during their carnival. This tradition is second only to Dartmouth College as the oldest of its kind in the United States. Students are known to participate in what has been colloquially termed as the &#x27;Dartmouth Challenge&#x27;, which consists of alcohol related activities, closely related to the parent ritual Newman Day, a tradition the college started in the 1970s. The carnival has been hosted by the Bates Outing Club since its conception.

==== Puddle Jump ====
On the Friday of Winter Carnival, the Bates College Outing Club initiates the annual Puddle Jump. A hole is cut by a chainsaw or by the original axe used in the inaugural Puddle Jump of 1975, in Lake Andrews. Students from all class years jump into the hole, sometimes in costumes, to celebrate, &quot;exuberance at the end of a hard winter.&quot; By mid-evening, they celebrate with donuts, cider and a cappella performances.

== Athletics ==
The college&#x27;s official mascot is the bobcat, and official color is garnet. The college athletically competes in the NCAA Division III New England Small College Athletic Conference (NESCAC), which also includes Amherst, Connecticut, Hamilton, Middlebury, Trinity, Tufts, Wesleyan, Williams, and &quot;Maine Big Three&quot; rivals Bowdoin and Colby in the Colby-Bates-Bowdoin Consortium. This is one of the oldest football rivalries in the United States. This consortium is a series of historically highly competitive football games ending in the championship game between the three schools. Bates is the holder of the winning streak, but also has the record for the biggest loss in the athletic conference.

Overall the college leads the Colby-Bates-Bowdoin Consortium in wins. Bates has won this championship a total of eleven times including 2014, 2015, and in 2016 won it again with a 24–7 win over Bowdoin, after their 21–19 home victory over Colby.

According to &quot;U.S. Rowing&quot;, the Women&#x27;s Rowing Team is ranked first in the New England Small College Athletic Conference, and first overall in NCAA Division III rowing, . In the 2015 season, the women&#x27;s rowing team was the most decorated rowing team in collegiate racing while also being the first to sweep every major rowing competition in its athletic conference in the history of NCAA Division III athletics. In 2015, the men&#x27;s rowing team had the fastest ascension in rankings of any sport in its athletic conference and is the NESCAC Rowing Champion. Bates has the 4th-highest NESCAC title hold, is ranked 5th in its athletic conference and 15th in Division III athletics. , the college has graduated a total of 12 Olympians, one of whom won the Olympic gold medal rowing for Canada at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. The all-time leader of the Chase Regatta is Bates with a total of 14 composite wins, followed by Colby&#x27;s five wins, concluding with Bowdoin&#x27;s two wins.

The ice hockey team is the first team to win the NESCAC Club Ice Hockey Championships four times in a row. , the men&#x27;s club ice hockey team is ranked 5th in the Northeast, and 25th overall in the NECHA rankings. In the winter of 2008, the college&#x27;s Nordic Skiing team sent students who were the highest-ranked skiers in the Eastern Intercollegiate Ski Association and placed 4th in the 2008 NCAA Division I Championship. In April 2005, the college&#x27;s athletic program was ranked top 5% of national athletics programs. The men&#x27;s squash team won the national championships in 2015, and 2016, with the winning student being the first in the history of the athletic conference, to be named the All American all four years he played for the college. The men&#x27;s track field is the first team in the history of Maine to have seven consecutive wins of the state championship, a feat completed in 2016.
Bates maintains 31 varsity teams, and 9 club teams, including sailing, cycling, ice hockey, rugby, and water polo.

== Sustainability ==

In 2005, President Elaine Tuttle Hansen stated, &quot;Bates will purchase its entire electricity supply from renewable energy sources in Maine&quot; and secured a new contract, adding a premium of $76,000 to their energy supply. Bates College signed onto the American College and University President&#x27;s Climate Commitment in 2007. In April 2008, the college completed its dining complex named &quot;The Commons&quot; at a cost of approximately $24 million. The complex is 60,000 square feet, certified LEED Silver, and features occupancy sensors, anti-HCFC refrigerants, natural ventilation, heat islands, and five separate dining areas with almost 70% of the walls being glass paneling.

In 2009, the college was given its third $5,000 grant allocation by the Hobart Center for Foodservice Sustainability which cited Bates as &quot;having the best sustainability program among numerous entrants nationwide&quot;. In 2010, the college was named one of 15 colleges in the United States to the &quot;Green Honor Roll&quot;, by The Princeton Review. Bates mitigates 99% of emissions via electrical consumption and purchases all of its energy from Maine Renewable Resources. The college expended $1.1 million of its endowment to install lighting retrofits, occupancy sensors, motor system replacements and energy-generating mechanisms. Select buildings at the college are open 24/7, thus requiring extra energy, due to this the college has implemented technology that places buildings on &quot;stand-by&quot; mode while minimum occupancy is attained to preserve energy. The practice is set to reduce the college&#x27;s overall emissions levels by 5 to 10 percent. Overall, the academic buildings and residential halls are equipped with day-lighting techniques, motion sensors, and efficient heating systems. Bates expended $1.5 million to implement a central plant that provides steam for heating for up to 80% of all on-campus establishments. The central plant is equipped with a modernized biomass system and a miniature back-pressure steam turbine which reduces campus electricity consumption by 5%. The college also installed a $2.7 million 900kW hyper-roterized turbine that accounts for nearly one-tenth of the campus&#x27; entire energy consumption. Bates was the first food-service operation in higher education to join the Green Restaurant Association. In 2013, the environmental practices of the college&#x27;s dining services were placed along with Harvard University, and Northeastern University, as the best in the United States by the Green Restaurant Association; it earned three out of three stars, the only educational institution in Maine to do so.

Bates maintains numerous environmental clubs and initiatives such as Green Certification, which recognizes students who commit to sustainable policies and practices, Green Bike, which offers students access to bicycles for use on and off campus for free, and the Bates Action Energy Movement in which students participate in &quot;both on-campus and nationwide environmental events and engage students with discussions on climate change and other pressing ecological crises.&quot; The Bates College Museum of Art offers programs such as the Green Horizons Program that showcase environmentalism in art, society, and culture.

The United States Environmental Protection Agency honored Bates as a member of the Green Power Leadership Club due to the fact that 96% of energy used on campus is from renewable resources. All newly developed buildings and facilities are built to LEED Silver and Gold standards. The college achieved complete carbon neutrality in 2019, as a result of campus-wide conservation efforts and specific initiatives in its implementation plan.

== Administration ==
=== Leadership ===

Bates College is governed by its central administration, headquartered in and metonymically known as &quot;Lane Hall&quot;. The first president of the college was its founder, Oren Burbank Cheney and its president is Garry W. Jenkins, who took office in July 2023. There have been nine presidents of Bates College, and one interim president. The president is &quot;ex officio&quot; a member and president of the board of trustees, chief executive officer of the corporation, and principal academic of the college.

There are 37 members on the Bates College board of trustees. The chairman of the board is 1981 alumnus, and CEO of PineBridge Investments, Gregory A. Ehret.
=== Endowment and fundraising ===
As a tax-exempt nonprofit organization, Bates is classified under section 501(c) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. The endowment surpasses the national average, yet has been seen as a laggard compared to its direct peers. During the first half-century of the college, the endowment grew at an exponentially high rate, topping off at $1 million in 1910, as Yale University, then 207 years old, stood at $12 million. &quot;Lackluster fundraising, poor governance, and divestments&quot; from the 1960s to 1980s, &quot;cost Bates hundreds of millions&quot; according to a 2019–20 &quot;The Student/&quot;BCIC academic study. During the 2007–2008 financial crisis and the Great Recession, the college&#x27;s endowment lost 31% of market value. The Bates endowment consistently outperformed peers in market returns, particularly against fellow NESCAC colleges and the Ivy League from 2010 to 2018. Its low endowment-to-student ratio increases the college&#x27;s fee dependency and therefore overall sticker price, frequently making Bates one of the most expensive colleges to attend in the United States.

As of the 2016 fiscal year, the college received $28.2 million in overall donations demonstrating a 134% increase in giving since 2013, and breaking the previous 2006 record of $24.8 million. In May 2017 president Clayton Spencer announced the &quot;Bates+You&quot; fundraising campaign, the largest ever undertaken by the college, due to close out on $300 million.

In 2014, members of the student advocacy group, Bates Energy Action Movement (BEAM), requested the college divest from 200 companies that held the largest fossil fuel reserves. In response the college asserted the board of trustees had a fiduciary responsibility to the growth of the endowment and declined to specifically divest from the companies. However, in accordance with the student&#x27;s request the college did disclose its full investment strategy, and commented on the long term implications of divestment by saying:

<doc id="319765" wikidata="Q489155" url="?curid=319765" title="Sunshine Policy">
<text>The Reconciliation and Cooperation Policy Towards the North (), colloquially referred to as Sunshine Policy () is one of the approaches for South Korea&#x27;s foreign policy towards North Korea, lasting from 1998 to 2008 and again from 2017 to 2020.

== Background ==
The policy emerged largely in the context of the growing economic gap between the two Koreas: the South was strengthening itself and experiencing economic prosperity that had begun under President Park Chung Hee in the 1970s while the North was experiencing severe economic decline, consequently caused the 1990s North Korean famine and faced bankruptcy. The Sunshine Policy aimed at mitigating this gap in economic power and restoring lost communication between the two States.

Furthermore, the background to South Korea&#x27;s decision to engage North Korea through cooperation rather than maintaining a conservative stance in the past shows a historical shift in the South Korea&#x27;s domestic politics as well. According to Son Key-young, a South Korean author, the Sunshine Policy emerged ultimately as evidence of the evolving South Korean national identity since the Cold War. The end of the Cold War &quot;ushered in an era of unprecedented confusion in South Korea over whether to define North Korea as friend or foe&quot;.

The Sunshine Act was created and launched by President Kim Dae-jung in 1998. This policy resulted in greater political contact between the two States and some historic moments in Inter-Korean relations; the three Korean summit meetings in Pyongyang (June 2000, October 2007, and September 2018) and two meetings in Panmunjom (April 2018 and May 2018), as well as several high-profile business ventures, and brief meetings of family members separated by the Korean War. In 2000, Kim Dae-jung, the then-President of South Korea, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his implementation of the Sunshine Policy.

Following the election of Moon Jae-in in 2017, South Korea began reconciling with North Korea once more, thus beginning a revival of the Sunshine Policy. Moon Jae-in&#x27;s effort to improve the inter-Korean relationship resulted in three inter-Korean summits in a year, including two summits held in Panmunjom (April and May 2018) that marked the first inter-Korean summits to be held outside of Pyongyang, and one in Pyongyang (September 2018). In recognition of Moon&#x27;s endeavor in inter-Korean relationship as the first president to hold multiple summits in a year, his version of Sunshine Policy became known as &quot;Moonshine Policy&quot;.

== Etymology ==
The policy is also known as The Operational Policy Towards the North () and The Embracing Policy ().

The term &quot;Sunshine Policy&quot; originates from a speech given by Kim Dae-jung after his election, in which he referenced &quot;The North Wind and the Sun&quot;, one of Aesop&#x27;s fables.

In the tale, the north wind and the sun debate which one is stronger. They challenge each other to see who can get a passing traveler to remove their cloak. The wind tries with all its might to bluster and blow the cloak away, but the wind&#x27;s chill makes the traveler cling to their cloak even more. The sun, however, has a different effect: its blistering rays cause the traveler to sweat and, unable to continue walking in the sweltering heat, he decides to take off his cloak. Therefore, the meaning can be interpreted as persuasion triumphing over force.

In the framework of this fable, South Korea needs to be warm towards the North in order for them to feel secure enough to &#x27;remove their cloak&#x27; (make peace and disarm) instead of using the harsh wind (brute force and military aggression) which would only make the North cling to their &#x27;cloak&#x27; (nationalism and isolation). Hence, the Sunshine Policy is based upon the notion that kindness and mutual co-operation are more effective than demands and aggression.

==Overview==
The main aim of the policy was to soften North Korea&#x27;s attitudes towards the South by encouraging interaction and economic assistance.

The national security policy had three basic principles:
*No military provocation from the North will be accepted;
*The South will not attempt to annex or occupy the North in any way;
*The South will actively seek peace and mutual partnership with the North.

These principles were meant to convey the message that the South does not wish to absorb the North or to undermine its government; its goal was peaceful coexistence rather than regime change. Kim Dae-jung&#x27;s administration was well aware of the prevalent fear spread within North Korea, afraid of its own identity as a state being taken away through coerced integration or any interaction with the international community.

In line with these principles, Kim ordered that the term &quot;reunification&quot; be removed from the vocabulary used to describe relations with their northern neighbour as this promoted the idea that the South sought to absorb or destroy the North. Instead, they favoured terms such as &quot;inter-Korean relations&quot; or &quot;policy towards North Korea&quot;.

Kim&#x27;s administration also outlined two other core policies. The first was the separation of politics and economics. This hoped to facilitate inter-Korean trade despite any political challenges, boosting the North&#x27;s economy and, in turn, inducing change in the North&#x27;s economic policy.

The second component was reciprocity. Initially, it was intended that the two states would treat each other as equals, each making concessions and compromises, with the philosophy that &quot;give and take&quot; was required from both parties. Perhaps most criticism of the policy stemmed from the significant backpedaling by the South on this principle in the face of unexpected rigidity from the North. It ran into trouble just two months into the Sunshine era, when South Korea requested the creation of a reunion center for divided families in exchange for fertilizer assistance; North Korea denounced this as &quot;horse trading&quot; and cut off talks. A year later, the South announced its goal would be &quot;flexible reciprocity&quot; based on Confucian values; as the &quot;elder brother&quot; of the relationship, the South would provide aid without expecting an immediate reciprocation and without requesting a specific form of reciprocity. The South also announced that it would provide humanitarian assistance without any expectations of concessions in return.

The logic of the policy was based on the belief that, even in light of its continuing shortages and economic duress, the North&#x27;s government will not collapse, disintegrate, or reform itself, even if the South were to apply strong pressure. It was believed that military tensions can be lessened through bilateral and multilateral frameworks. This emphasized the normalization of political and economic relations between both the United States and North Korea as well as Japan.

Sunshine Policy is often compared to the Western German Chancellor Willy Brandt&#x27;s &quot;Ostpolitik&quot; (Eastern Policy) which is a foreign policy of change through détente in the hopes of improving relations with East Germany, the Soviet Union, Poland and other Soviet Bloc countries in the early 1970s.

==Kim Dae-jung Administration: 1998–2003==
The Sunshine Policy was first formulated and implemented under Kim Dae-jung&#x27;s government. North-South cooperative business developments began, including a railroad and the Mount Kumgang Tourist Region, where several thousand South Korean citizens still traveled until 2008, when there was a shooting incident and the trips were cancelled. Though negotiations for them were difficult, three reunions between divided families were held.

The year 2000 marked a significant milestone in relations between the two states when Kim Dae-jung and Kim Jong Il came together for the 2000 inter-Korean summit, the first-time leaders of each Korea had met since the end of the Civil War. The conference was held between 13 and 15 June. By the end of the meeting, the June 15th North–South Joint Declaration was adopted between the two Koreas. In the declaration, the two Koreas reached an agreement on five points, to settle the problem of independent reunification, to promote peaceful reunification, to solve humanitarian problems such as the issue of separated families, to encourage cooperation and exchange in their economy, and to have a dialogue between the North and South. After the summit, however, talks between the two states stalled. Criticism of the policy intensified and Unification Minister Lim Dong-won lost a no-confidence vote on September 3, 2001. Returning from his meeting in Washington with newly elected President Bush, Kim Dae-jung described his meeting as embarrassing while privately cursing President Bush and his hardliner approach. This meeting negated any chance of a North Korean visit to South Korea. With the Bush administration labeling North Korea as being part of the &quot;axis of evil&quot;, North Korea renounced the non-proliferation treaty, kicked out UN inspectors, and restarted its nuclear program. In 2002 a short naval skirmish over disputed fishing territory killed six South Korean naval soldiers, further chilling relations.

==Roh Moo-hyun administration: 2003–2008==
President Roh Moo-hyun continued the policy of his predecessor, and relations on the divided peninsula warmed somewhat from 2002. In 2003, the issue of the North&#x27;s possession of nuclear weapons surfaced again, with both North Korea and the United States accusing each other of breaching the Agreed Framework.

Nevertheless, Roh stayed committed to the policy and his government continued to supply the North with humanitarian aid. The two governments continued cooperation on the projects begun under Kim Dae-jung and also started the Kaesong Industrial Park, with South Korea spending the equivalent of just over $324 million on aid to the North in 2005.

There appeared to be a pro-unification Korean trend in public attitudes during the Roh administration, though there are significant differences between generations, political groups, and regions. But the ruling Uri Party, which strongly supported it, suffered electoral defeats and in 2008 the party lost its majority in the government. The new government took a harsher stance toward North Korea.

Both the North and South Korean Governments agreed to hold a summit in Pyongyang on August 20, 2007, but this was later postponed to October 2 to 4 due in part to an internal crisis within North Korea. Unlike his predecessor Kim Dae-jung who travelled to Pyongyang by plane, Roh travelled from Seoul to Pyongyang overland by car on October 2. Roh made a stopover at Panmunjom and crossed the Military Demarcation Line by foot, stating that his gesture would symbolize the future reunification of Korea.

==Criticism==
North Korean defector and journalist Kang Chol-hwan, who spent nine years in a North Korean prison, claims that Kim Dae-jung was mistaken in offering assistance to the North without any conditions of improving human rights in return. Kang disagrees with claims that the Sunshine Policy has led to a settlement of peace between North and South and questions the concept of no-strings-attached humanitarian aid, saying &quot;it is important to understand that North Koreans are starving not because of a lack of aid from South Korea or the U.S., but because they are deprived of freedom. Giving aid only throws a line to the government, and prolongs starvation, surely a perverse outcome.&quot;

Furthermore, the policy built upon &quot;flexible reciprocity&quot; is often criticized to be an inappropriate ideal, bound to have realistic obstacles in Inter-Korea relations. Rather than viewing North Korea as a full equal to its power, South Korea took the stance that the stronger counterpart should wait patiently until the other has gained enough power, allowing North Korea to reciprocate with time. It is theorized that the &#x27;time-differential&#x27; in the interaction between the two nations did not aid in the restoration of trust and cooperation but led to further problems in missing transparency and the delay in fully understanding the implications of the policy, which did not benefit the mass as much as expected.

Some critics of the Sunshine Policy contend that rather than increasing the chances of reunification or undermining the regime in North Korea, it has been used instead for political gain in domestic politics in the South. They point to what they say are the continuing provocations and criminal activities committed by the North, such as the 2002 sea battle that left several South Korean sailors dead,
 the counterfeiting of American money, and what they call the North&#x27;s general unwillingness to reciprocate Seoul&#x27;s gestures of goodwill, as evidence that the North is interested only in receiving money and aid to prop up the communist regime. Critics also believe that, in exchange for providing humanitarian aid, the South should demand that the North return detained South Korean citizens and the remains of POWs from the Korean War. Some see the Kaesong Industrial Park as merely a way for large South Korean companies to employ cheaper labor.

Many South Korean conservative-leaning observers see the weakening of the US-South Korea alliance as being due in large part to the Sunshine Policy; they say it has led the South to favor the North&#x27;s interests over those of its ally, the United States, and that it leads South Korean politicians to unreasonably mute or censor criticism of the North and even to ignore the sacrifices of its own soldiers so as to avoid upsetting the North. They say that this is harmful to the South&#x27;s national interest in being allied with the United States, and actually damages the chances for a smooth and peaceful reunification. Internationally and at home, the South Korean government has been criticized for repeatedly abstaining from United Nations votes condemning the North&#x27;s human rights record. The government defends the abstentions by citing the special character of inter-Korean relations.

Conspiracies have been alleged about South Korea&#x27;s motivations for this policy. One North Korean defector who worked on weapons systems claimed that South Korean intelligence wanted to suppress his story, because it would shed a bad light on the policy. According to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, several U.S. senators believe his story.

Despite both the positive and negative reactions and criticism about the Sunshine Policy, there is still a debate going on today about the effectiveness of the Sunshine Policy. Even the antagonists of the Sunshine Policy were in agreement that the humanitarian emergency aid that was released from the international community, as well as South Korea, contributed to the relief of North Korea&#x27;s great famine during the late 1990s. However, the ensuing cooperation policies in fact produced a backlash to goodwill argument stating that the government guided economic assistance and also direct investment instead saved or even brought back the hyper militarized North Korean regime, which because of these delays the inevitable economic reforms consequently stalled the nuclear crisis. This debate now had entered a very decisive combination. The latest supposedly alleged hydrogen bomb test seemed to very much falsify the effectiveness and also the ability to produce the desired result of positive inducement policies based on the Sunshine Policy. The idea was that South Korean economics assistance could succeed in persuading North Korea&#x27;s post-communist reform and opening, which would hopefully promote peace between North Korea and South Korea. Even with all this effort and good intentions that were put into the Sunshine Policy, the policy itself began to fall apart and would soon be no more. The South Korean government officially acknowledged the reverse effects of both the current and existing inducement approaches. The President of Korea at the time President Park Geun Hye even stated during this time &quot;Gone are the days when we caved into the North&#x27;s provocations and unconditionally pumped aid into the North&quot; This statement was given as an address to the National Assembly in South Korea. Because of this critical reappraisal, this led to the complete shutdown of the Kaeseong Industrial Complex. The Kaeseong Industrial Complex was the very last symbol of the Sunshine Policy. The building was eventually closed on February 11, 2016.

However, it can be suggested that the Sunshine Policy had some positive effect on North Korea&#x27;s military and nuclear stance. Kim Suk-young mentions that North Korean government is &quot;both strong and weak&quot; and it is affected by &quot;external and internal pressures&quot; and its decisions to militarize and nuclearize or not are made due to the relationship with other countries. The author of &quot;Inside the Red Box: North Korea&#x27;s Post-Totalitarian Politics&quot;, Patrick McEachern also analyzes that the North Korea&#x27;s government has not decided its policies. Moreover, he stated that North Korea has never changed its behaviors to become peaceful by others&#x27; pressures and suggests it never will. The view that the Sunshine Policy de-escalated tensions is may be given weight by comparing the number of North Korean missile and nuclear tests during Sunshine Policy period and the present unfriendly policy since Lee administration. North Korea engaged in nuclear tests five times and missile tests eight times in the eight years since 2008; by comparison, one nuclear test and three missile tests were carried out before 2008. However, this may also be indicative of the North gaining the technological capabilities to conduct extensive nuclear and missile tests circa 2008. (Refer to List of nuclear weapons tests of North Korea, List of North Korean missile tests, Kwangmyŏngsŏng-3, Kwangmyŏngsŏng-1.)

==End of the Sunshine Policy: 2008–2017==
On October 9, 2006, before the nuclear and missile tests, South Korea suspended aid shipments to the North and put their military on high alert status. There was much concern regarding how South Korea can maintain a cooperative policy towards the North when such provocative acts occurred. Nonetheless, the government of South Korea insisted that at least some aspects of the Sunshine Policy, including the Kumgangsan Tourist Region and the Kaesong Industrial Region would continue.

From March 2008, however, the new president of the South, Lee Myung-bak and his conservative Grand National Party took a different stance to North Korea, and the South Korean government stated that any expansion of the economic cooperation at the Kaesong Industrial Region would only happen if the North resolved the international standoff over its nuclear weapons. Relations have again chilled, with North Korea making military moves such as a series of short-range ship-to-ship missile tests.

After the 2009 North Korean nuclear test, the relationship between Seoul and Pyongyang was again strained. According to Jungmin Kang writing in the &quot;Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists&quot;: &quot;Because of the post-1998 &#x27;Sunshine Policy&#x27;, many South Korean nongovernmental organizations and the public weren&#x27;t concerned about North Korea&#x27;s threats, believing that Pyongyang would never use nuclear weapons against them.&quot; South Korea&#x27;s response to the nuclear test, although dampened by the recent death of its former President Roh Moo-hyun, included signing the Proliferation Security Initiative to prevent the shipment of nuclear materials to North Korea.

In November 2010, the South Korean Unification Ministry officially declared the Sunshine Policy a failure, thus bringing the policy to a formal end.

==Return to the Sunshine Policy: 2017–2020==

Moon Jae-in was elected President of South Korea in 2017, promising to return South Korea to the Sunshine Policy. 2018 and 2019 saw a rapid acceleration in talks between the two countries, seeking inter-Korean dialogue, denuclearization and demilitarization, and eventual unification of the peninsula.
On 27 April 2018, the first of three summits took place between Moon and Kim in the South Korean side of the Joint Security Area inside of the Peace House. The summit ended with both countries pledging to work towards complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. They also vowed to declare an official end to the Korean War within a year. The Panmunjom Declaration was signed by leaders of both countries, which laid out the goals of inter-Korean dialogue and peace negotiations. Both countries called for the end of longstanding military activities in the region of the Korean border and an eventual reunification of the peninsula. Additionally, the leaders agreed to work together to connect and modernize their railway systems.

Moon and Kim met a second time on 26 May, this time on the North Korean side of the Joint Security Area in the Unification Pavilion. This meeting was unannounced to the media prior, but focused on discussions around Kim&#x27;s upcoming summit with United States President Donald Trump. The summit also resulted on an agreement to reopen a jointly operated liaison office in Kaesong that the South had shut down in February 2016 after a North Korean nuclear test. The office was operational from September 2018 to June 2020 and held many inter-Korean talks, until the building was demolished by North Korea amid rising tensions.

From 18 to 21 September, delegations from both countries met in Pyongyang, North Korea for the third and final summit between Moon and Kim. The summit resulted in agreement in a number of areas, including the removal of land mines and guard posts along areas of the Joint Security Area. North Korea agreed to dismantle their nuclear complex in the presence of international experts if the U.S. takes correlative action, although this never occurred. Moon became the first South Korean leader to give a public address in North Korea.

South Korea announced that it would not conduct annual military exercises with the US in September 2018, and would also stop its own drills in the Yellow Sea, in order to not provoke North Korea and to continue a peaceful dialog. On 1 July 2018 South and North Korea resumed ship-to-ship radio communication, which could prevent accidental clashes between South and North Korean military vessels around the Northern Limit Line (NLL) in the West (Yellow) Sea. On 17 July 2018, South and North Korea fully restored their military communication line on the western part of the peninsula.

Cultural exchanges were also an important aspect of normalizing relations. In preparation for the 2018 Winter Olympics, held in South Korea, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un proposed sending a delegation of athletes and officials. In the opening ceremonies, North and South Korea marched together under the Korean Unification Flag. At the games the two countries fielded a united women&#x27;s ice hockey team. Apart from their athletic delegation, North Korea sent an unprecedented high-level political delegation. This delegation was headed by Kim Yo Jong, sister of Kim Jong-un, and President Kim Yong-nam, and included musical performers like the Samjiyon Orchestra. The arrival of Kim Yo-jong to the games marked the first time since the Korean War that a member of the Kim ruling dynasty entered South Korean territory. The delegation extended President Moon an invitation to visit North Korea. On 1 April 2018, South Korean K-pop stars performed a concert in Pyongyang entitled &quot;Spring is Coming&quot;, which was attended by Kim Jong-un and his wife. In May 2018, North Korea adjusted its time zone to match the South&#x27;s while the South began removing propaganda loudspeakers from the border area in line with the Panmunjom Declaration.

In recognition of President Moon Jae-in&#x27;s attempts to restart engagement with North Korea and cooperate with Washington, Moon&#x27;s return to the Sunshine Policy is sometimes referred to as &quot;Moonshine Policy&quot;. While Moon is commended for his attempts at seeking peace for the peninsula, increased military hostility from South Korea and the United States has soured inter-Korean relations since 2019. Denuclearization of North Korea has also made little progress since 2019, while weapons testing has increased.

However, by 2020, negotiations almost completely stalled without progress on denuclearization, with both Trump and Kim focusing on domestic issues. North Korean foreign ministry further criticized the Trump administration that year for &quot;empty promise[s]&quot;, and further took action by demolishing the four-story joint-liaison office building it shared with South Korea on June 17.

<doc id="319769" wikidata="Q208961" url="?curid=319769" title="Brendan the Navigator">
<text>Brendan of Clonfert (c. AD 484 – c. 577) is one of the early Irish monastic saints and one of the Twelve Apostles of Ireland. He is also referred to as Brendan the Navigator, Brendan the Voyager, Brendan the Anchorite, and Brendan the Bold. The Irish translation of his name is or . He is mainly known for his legendary voyage to find the &quot;Isle of the Blessed&quot; which is sometimes referred to as &quot;Saint Brendan’s Island&quot;. The written narrative of his journey comes from the immram (Voyage of Saint Brendan the Abbot).

Saint Brendan&#x27;s feast day is celebrated on 16 May by Catholics, Anglicans, and Orthodox Christians.

==Sources==
There is very little secure information concerning Brendan&#x27;s life, although at least the approximate dates of his birth and death, and accounts of some events in his life, are found in Irish annals and genealogies. The earliest mention of Brendan is in the (Life of Saint Columba) of Adamnan written between AD 679 and 704. The earliest mention of him as a seafarer appears in the &quot;Martyrology of Tallaght&quot; of the ninth century.

The principal works regarding Brendan and his legend are a &quot;Life of Brendan&quot; in several Latin () and Irish versions () and the better known (Voyage of Saint Brendan the Abbot). Unfortunately, the versions of the and the provide little reliable information of his life and travels; they do, however, attest to the development of devotion to him in the centuries after his death. An additional problem is that the precise relationship between the and the traditions is uncertain.

The date when the tradition began is uncertain. The earliest surviving copies are no earlier than the end of the twelfth century, but scholars suggest that a version of the was composed before AD 1000. The was probably written earlier than the , perhaps in the second half of the eighth century. Aengus the Culdee, in his &quot;Litany&quot;, composed in the end of the eighth century, invoked &quot;the sixty who accompanied St. Brendan in his quest for the Land of Promise&quot;.

Any attempt to reconstruct the facts of the life of Brendan or to understand the nature of his legend must be based principally on Irish annals and genealogies and on the various versions of the .

==History==

===Early life===
Brendan was born in AD 484 in Tralee, in County Kerry, in the province of Munster, in the south-west of Ireland.

He was born among the Altraige, an Irish clan originally centred around Tralee Bay, to parents called Finnlug and Cara. Tradition has it that he was born in the Kilfenora/Fenit area on the north side of the bay. He was baptised at Tubrid, near Ardfert, by Erc of Slane, and was originally to be called but signs and portents attending his birth and baptism led to him being christened or &#x27;fair-drop&#x27;. For five years he was both educated and given in fosterage to St. Íte of Killeedy, &quot;The Brigid of Munster&quot;. When he was six he was sent to Jarlath&#x27;s monastery school at Tuam to further his education. Brendan is considered one of the &quot;Twelve Apostles of Ireland&quot;, one of those said to have been tutored by the great teacher, Finnian of Clonard.

===Foundations===
At age 26, Brendan was ordained a priest by Erc. Afterward, he founded a number of monasteries. Brendan&#x27;s first voyage took him to the Aran Islands, where he founded a monastery. He also visited Hinba (Argyll), an island off the Scottish coast, where he is said to have met Columcille. On the same voyage he travelled to Wales and finally to Brittany, on the northern coast of France.

Between AD 512 and 530 Brendan built monastic cells at Ardfert, and Shanakeel (, usually translated as the &quot;Old Church&quot;), at the foot of Mount Brandon. From there he is supposed to have embarked on his famous seven-year voyage bound for Paradise. The old Irish calendars assigned a feast for the &quot;egressio familiae Sancti Brendani&quot;.

===Legendary journey===
Brendan is primarily renowned for his legendary journey to the Isle of the Blessed as described in the (&quot;Voyage of Saint Brendan the Abbot&quot;) of the ninth century. Many versions exist that narrate how he set out on the Atlantic Ocean with sixteen monks (although other versions record fourteen monks and three unbelievers who joined in the last minute) to search for the Garden of Eden. One of these companions is said to have been Malo. The voyage is dated to AD 512–530, before his travel to the island of Great Britain. On his trip, Brendan is supposed to have seen Saint Brendan&#x27;s Island, a blessed island covered with vegetation. He also encountered a sea monster, an adventure he shared with his contemporary Columcille. The most commonly illustrated adventure is his landing on an island which turned out to be a giant sea monster named &quot;Jasconius&quot;.

====&quot;The Voyage of Saint Brendan the Abbot&quot;====
The earliest extant version of the (&quot;Voyage of Saint Brendan the Abbot&quot;) was recorded AD 900. There are over 100 manuscripts of the narrative throughout Europe and many translations. The is plainly a Christian narrative, but also narrates natural phenomena and fantastical events and places, which appealed to a broad audience. The contains many parallels and inter-textual references to &quot;Bran&quot; and &quot;The Voyage of Máel Dúin&quot;.

On the Kerry coast, Brendan built a currach-like boat of wattle, covered it with hides tanned in oak bark and softened with butter, and set up a mast and a sail. He and a small group of monks fasted for 40 days, and after a prayer on the shore, embarked in the name of the Most Holy Trinity. The narrative is characterized by much literary licence, for example, it refers to Hell where &quot;great demons threw down lumps of fiery slag from an island with rivers of gold fire&quot; and also to &quot;great crystal pillars&quot;. Many speculate that these are references to volcanic activity around Iceland and to icebergs.

;Synopsis
The journey of Brendan begins when he meets with Saint Barinthus. Barinthus describes The Promised Land for Saints (). As Barinthus describes his journey to this island, Brendan decides to visit the island also because it was described as a place of those who lived a certain lifestyle and embraced true faith of Christianity. Brendan assembles a group of fourteen monks who pray together with him in his community to leave with him on his journey. Before departing, Brendan and the monks fast at three-day intervals for forty nights and set out on the voyage that was described to him by Barinthus. They first embark towards the island called Saint Edna. After Brendan and the monks build a small boat for their journey, three people join them after Brendan has already chosen his companions. These three extras will not return to Ireland, as Brendan prophesies, since their number is now an unholy one.

For a period of seven years, the group travel the seas and come across various locations while searching for the Promised Land. One of the first islands they come across is an unnamed and uninhabited island. It is here that the first of the three extra travellers dies. The survivors leave and continue their journey to the Island of Sheep. After a short stay, they land on the back of a giant fish named Jasconius, which they believe to be an island. But once they light a fire, the island starts to move revealing its true nature. Other places they visit include the Island of Birds, the Island of Ailbe inhabited by a community of silent monks, and the Island of Strong Men. In some accounts, it is on the Island of Strong Men where the second of the three additional sailors leaves, remaining on the island instead of continuing. The third of the three is dragged away by demons.

After travelling for seven years, visiting some of the same places repeatedly, the wanderers finally arrive in the Promised Land for Saints. They are welcomed and allowed to enter briefly. Awed by what they see, they return to Ireland rejoicing.

====Context====

The fits in with a then-popular literary genre, peculiar to Ireland, called an immram. Irish immrama flourished during the seventh and eighth centuries. Typically, an immram is a tale that describes the hero&#x27;s series of seafaring adventures. Some of the immrams involved the search for, and visits to, Tír na nÓg, an island far to the west, beyond the edges of the world map. There appear to be similarities with &quot;The Voyage of Bran&quot; written much earlier. In the , this style of storytelling accorded with a religious ascetic tradition in which Irish monks travelled alone in boats, in a similar way to that in which their desert brothers isolated themselves in caves.

Brendan&#x27;s voyages were one of the most remarkable and enduring of European legends. With many of the facts of Brendan&#x27;s journeys coming from the , it has been difficult for scholars to distinguish fact and folklore. The narrative of Brendan&#x27;s voyage, developed during this time, shares some characteristics with immrams. Like an immram, the tells the story of Brendan, who, with some companion monks, sets out to find the , (&quot;Promised Land of the Saints&quot;), that is, the Earthly Paradise.

Jude S. Mackley holds that efforts to identify possible, actual locations referred to in the distract from the author&#x27;s purpose of presenting a legend of &quot;salvation, monastic obedience and the faith required to undertake such a pilgrimage.&quot;

====Intertextuality====
Scholars debate whether the influenced &quot;The Voyage of Máel Dúin&quot; or vice versa. Jude Mackley suggests that an early influenced an equally early and that inter-borrowing continued as the traditions developed. The adapts the immram traditions to a Christian context.

A principal similarity between and the is the introduction in both of three additional passengers. Mael Dúin is joined by his foster brothers, and Brendan by three additional monks. Both additions upset the equilibrium of the voyages, and only when the additional persons are no longer on board can each voyage be completed.

====Anglo-Norman version====
The Anglo-Norman &quot;Voyage of Saint Brendan&quot; is the earliest surviving narrative text of Anglo-Norman literature. It was probably translated around 1121 by a cleric called Benedeit at the commission of Adeliza of Louvain, the second wife of Henry I of England. In its use of octosyllabic couplets to recount a quest narrative drawn from Celtic sources, it has been described as a precursor of later Old French romances. Benedeit&#x27;s version of the legend was itself retranslated several times into Latin prose and verse.

====Early Dutch version====
One of the earliest extant written versions of Brendan&#x27;s legend is the Dutch (Mediaeval Dutch for &quot;The Voyage of Saint Brendan&quot;) of the twelfth century. Scholars believe it is derived from a now lost Middle High German text combined with Gaelic elements from Ireland and that it combines Christian and fairy tale elements. describes &quot;Brandaen&quot;, a monk from Galway, and his voyage around the world for nine years. The journey began as a punishment by an angel who saw that Brandaen did not believe in the truth of a book of the miracles of creation and saw Brandaen throw it into a fire. The angel tells him that truth has been destroyed. On his journeys Brandaen encounters the wonders and horrors of the world, such as Judas Iscariot frozen on one side and burning on the other; people with swine heads, dog legs, and wolf teeth carrying bows and arrows; and an enormous fish that encircles Brandaen&#x27;s ship by holding its tail in its mouth. The English poem the &quot;Life of Saint Brandan&quot; is a later derivation from the Dutch version.

====Saint Brendan&#x27;s Island====

While the narrative is often assumed to be a religious allegory, there has been considerable discussion as to whether the legends are based on fact. There have been many interpretations of the possible geographical location of Saint Brendan&#x27;s Island. Various pre-Columbian sea charts indicated it everywhere from the southern part of Ireland to the Canary Islands, Faroes, or Azores; to the island of Madeira; to a point 60 degrees west of the first meridian and very near the equator.

====Tale of reaching North America====
Belief in the existence of Saint Brendan&#x27;s Island was almost completely abandoned until a new theory arose that the Irish were the first Europeans to encounter the Americas.

There is no reliable evidence to indicate that Brendan ever reached Greenland or the Americas. The Saint Brendan Society celebrates the belief that Brendan was the first European to reach North America. Tim Severin demonstrated that it is possible for a leather-clad boat such as the one described in the to reach North America. Severin&#x27;s film &quot;The Brendan Voyage&quot; of 1978, which documented his team&#x27;s feat, inspired the Irish composer Shaun Davey to write his orchestral suite &quot;The Brendan Voyage&quot;.

The was known widely in Europe throughout the Middle Ages. Maps of Christopher Columbus&#x27; time often included an island denominated Saint Brendan&#x27;s Isle that was placed in the western Atlantic Ocean.

Paul Chapman argues that Christopher Columbus learned from the that the currents and winds would favour westbound travel by a southerly route from the Canary Islands, and eastbound travel by a more northerly route on the return, and hence followed this itinerary on all of his voyages.

===Later life===
Brendan travelled to Wales and the holy island of Iona, off the west coast of Scotland; returning to Ireland, he founded a monastery in Annaghdown, where he spent the rest of his life. He also founded a convent at Annaghdown for his sister Briga. Having established the bishopric of Ardfert, Brendan proceeded to Thomond, and founded a monastery at Inis-da-druim (currently Coney Island), in the present parish of Killadysert, County Clare, AD 550. He then journeyed to Wales and studied under Gildas at Llancarfan, and thence to Iona, for he is said to have left traces of his apostolic zeal at Kil-&quot;brandon&quot; (near Oban) and Kil-&quot;brennan&quot; Sound. After a mission of three years in Britain he returned to Ireland, and evangelized further in various parts of Leinster, especially at Dysart, County Kilkenny, Killeney near Durrow (Tubberboe ), and Brandon Hill. He established churches at Inchiquin, County Galway, and Inishglora, County Mayo, and founded Clonfert in Galway AD 557. He died AD 577 in Annaghdown, while visiting his sister Briga. Fearing that after his death his devotees might take his remains as relics, Brendan had previously arranged to have his body secretly returned to the monastery he founded in Clonfert, concealed in a luggage cart. He was interred in Clonfert Cathedral.

==Veneration==
Brendan was recognised as a saint by the Catholic Church. His feast day is celebrated on 16 May.
As the legend of the seven years voyage spread, crowds of pilgrims and students flocked to Ardfert. Religious houses were formed at Gallerus, Kilmalchedor, Brandon Hill, and the Blasket Islands, to meet the wants of those who came for spiritual guidance from Brendan. Brendan is the patron saint of sailors and travellers. At the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, a large stained glass window commemorates Brendan&#x27;s achievements. At Fenit Harbour, Tralee, a substantial bronze sculpture by Tighe O&#x27;Donoghue/Ross was erected to honour the memory of Brendan. The project, including a Heritage Park and the Slí Bhreanainn (the Brendan way) was headed by Fr. Gearóid Ó Donnchadha and completed through the work of the St. Brendan Committee. 
==Patronage==
Brendan the Navigator (Brénainn moccu Alti or Brénainn maccu Alti as he is often known in medieval Irish) is the patron saint of two Irish dioceses, Kerry and Clonfert. He is also a patron saint of boatmen, mariners, travellers, elderly adventurers, whales, the United States Navy, and also of portaging canoes.

==Establishments==
St Brendan&#x27;s activities as a churchman, however, were developed in Western Ireland, where his most important foundations are found, i.e., Ardfert (County Kerry), Inishdadroum (County Clare), Annaghdown (County Galway), and Clonfert (County Galway). His name is perpetuated in numerous place names and landmarks along the Irish coast (e.g., Brandon Hill, Brandon Point, Mount Brendan, Brandon Well, Brandon Bay, Brandon Head).

Brendan&#x27;s most celebrated foundation was Clonfert Cathedral, in the year 563, over which he appointed Moinenn as Prior and Head Master. Brendan was interred in Clonfert.

The group of ecclesiastical remains at Ardfert is one of the most interesting and instructive now existing in Ireland. The ruins of the ancient Cathedral of St Brendan, and of its annexed chantries and detached chapels, form a very complete reliquary of Irish ecclesiastical architecture, in its various orders and ages, from the plain but solid Danhliag of the seventh or eighth century to some late and most ornate examples of medieval Gothic. Following the Reformation, the cathedral was finally dismantled in A.D. 1641.

===Brontë in Sicily===
In the Sicilian town of Brontë there is a church dedicated to Saint Brendan, whose name in the local dialect is &quot;San Brandanu&quot;. Since 1574, the &quot;Chiesa di San Blandano&quot; (&quot;Church of Saint Brendan&quot;) has replaced a chapel of the same dedication and in the same location. The reasons for dedicating a church to Saint Brendan here are still unknown and probably untraceable. 
However, it is known that the Normans and the many settlers that followed the Norman invasion brought into Sicily the tradition of Saint Brendan; there are documents of the 13th century written in Sicily that refer to him. In 1799 the countryside surrounding Brontë became the British &quot;Duchy of Horatio Nelson&quot;. The town of Drogheda, moreover, is twinned with Brontë.

<text>Sheffield Town Hall is a municipal building on Pinstone Street in the City of Sheffield, England. The building is used by Sheffield City Council, and also contains a publicly displayed collection of silverware. It is a Grade I listed building.

==History==
The current building, commissioned to replace the Old Town Hall, was designed by the London-based architect Edward William Mountford in the Renaissance Revival style and constructed between 1890 and 1897. The building was opened by Queen Victoria, using a remote control lock from her carriage, on 21 May 1897. The turning of the key in the lock triggered a light in the building which was the signal for three concealed men to open the gates.

An extension designed by F. E. P. Edwards was opened by the Prince of Wales on 29 May 1923.

The gardens were first laid out in 1938, following the demolition of St Paul&#x27;s Church. Originally named St Paul&#x27;s Gardens, they were immediately nicknamed the &quot;Peace Gardens&quot;, marking the contemporary signing of the Munich Agreement.

An extension designed in the Brutalist style was added to the east of the Peace Gardens in 1977; nicknamed &quot;The Egg-Box&quot; after its appearance, it was demolished in 2002.

==Exterior==
The design of the exterior echoed to a certain extent the architecture of the adjacent St. Paul&#x27;s Church of 1720 (now demolished). During construction, the building was criticised for its expensive embellishments. The exterior is built of Stoke stone from the Stoke Hall Quarry in Grindleford, Derbyshire and is decorated with carvings by F. W. Pomeroy. The friezes depict the industries of Sheffield, and the 64-metre-high clock-tower is surmounted by a statue of Vulcan. The clock, by Potts of Leeds, was provided with striking and chiming trains, but bells were never installed in the clock-tower so they remained unused. In 2002 an electronic bell sound system was added to provide hourly strikes and Westminster-style quarter chimes.

==Interior==
The entry contains displays relating to HMS &quot;Sheffield&quot; and leads to the Main Entrance Hall with a grand marble staircase. This also has an Electrolier an electric chandelier, part of the original lighting of the building. The walls include friezes including a depiction of the slaying of the Dragon of Wharncliffe. On the first landing is a statue of the first Lord Mayor Henry Fitzalan-Howard, 15th Duke of Norfolk.

The first floor has a gallery running its length which can be divided into four sections by means of powered oak panels descending from the ceiling. The south room is the Lord Mayor&#x27;s Parlour which is kept permanently divided. On the same floor is the oak-panelled Council Room and its antechamber, which has above its door the advice &quot;Be Ye wise as serpents and harmless as doves&quot;, a quotation from the Bible (Matthew 10:16).

<doc id="319775" wikidata="Q41151" url="?curid=319775" title="South Gyeongsang Province">
<text>South Gyeongsang Province (, ) is a province in the southeast of South Korea. The provincial capital is at Changwon. It is adjacent to the major metropolitan center and port of Busan. The UNESCO World Heritage Site Haeinsa, a Buddhist temple that houses the &quot;Tripitaka Koreana&quot; and tourist attraction, is located in this province. Automobile and petrochemical factories are largely concentrated along the southern part of the province, extending from Ulsan through Busan, Changwon, and Jinju.

==Etymology==
The name derives ; . The name derives from the names of the principal cities of Gyeongju () and Sangju ().

==History==

===Joseon===
In 1407, for military purposes, the administrative districts were reorganized, with Gyeongsang-do being divided into Gyeongsangjwa-do (or Gyeongsangjwa Province; left) and Gyeongsangwu-do (or Gyeongsangwu Province; right) as the reference points of the Nakdonggang River.

Before 1895, the area corresponding to modern-day South Gyeongsang Province was part of Gyeongsang Province, one of the Eight Provinces of Korea during the Joseon dynastic kingdom. In 1895, southern Gyeongsang was replaced by the districts of Jinju in the west and Dongnae (modern-day Busan) in the east. In 1896, they were merged to form South Gyeongsang Province.

===Today===
The provincial capital was originally at Jinju; it moved in 1925 to Busan. During the Japanese rule over Korea, the province was known as Keishōnan-dō. In 1948, South Gyeongsang Province became part of South Korea. In 1963, Busan separated from South Gyeongsang Province to become a Directly Governed City (&quot;Jikhalsi&quot;). In 1983, the provincial capital moved from Busan to Changwon. In 1995, Busan became a Metropolitan City (&quot;Gwangyeoksi&quot;), and Ulsan separated from South Gyeongsang Province to become a Metropolitan City in 1997.

==Geography==
The province is part of the Yeongnam region, on the north by North Gyeongsang Province, on the west by North Jeolla Province and South Jeolla Province, and on the south by the Korea Strait far from Nagasaki Prefecture, Japan. Most of the province is drained by the Nakdong River and its tributaries. The total area of the province is .

The tail of the Taebaek Mountains reaches the east of the Province, and the Nakdonggang River flows in the middle of the mountain range. The Province is bordered by the Sobaek Mountains and Honam to the west. The central lowland spreads along the Nakdonggang River basin. The Nakdonggang River is collecting tributaries of Gyeongsangnam-do to develop the Gimhae Delta Plain near the downstream. Jirisan, Deogyusan, and Bagunsan are lined up in the west.

==Demographics==

==Resources==

The Nakdong delta plain around Gimhae is one of the best granaries in South Korea. Agricultural products form Gyeongsangnam-do include rice, beans, potatoes, and barley. The area is renowned for its cotton, sesame, and fruits which are grown along the southern seaside. A number of marine products are caught. The province is one of the country&#x27;s leading fisheries.

==Major cities==
The largest cities in the region are Busan and Ulsan, which are separately administered as provincial-level Metropolitan Cities. Apart from the capital Changwon, other large or notable cities include Gimhae and Jinju.

==Attractions==

Gyeongsangnam-do is the home of Haeinsa, a Buddhist temple that houses the &quot;Tripitaka Koreana&quot; and attracts many tourists. It is in the national park around Jirisan (1,915 m) on the border with Jeollabuk-do. The temple was first built in 802.

Changnyeong County contains three major tourist attractions for the province: Upo Wetland, the natural hotsprings of Bugok, and Hwawangsan.

Yangsan-si contains two major temples for the province: Tongdosa and Naewon Temple

==Culture==
===Festival===
Beginning in 2002, the Tongyeong International Music Festival is one of the most important music events in Asia. Held every spring, the festival consists of stages from well-known classical music figures and aspiring musicians. It aims to foster young composers and performers.

Jinhae Naval Port Festival, one of the biggest cherry blossom festivals in South Korea, is held in Jinhae.

The Haman Water Fireworks Festival takes place around Buddha&#x27;s Birthday in April every year. It is one of the cultures that has existed since the Joseon Dynasty. It originated from the heart of praying for peace in the country.

==Tourism==
The Jinju National Museum opened in 1984 as the first national museum in South Gyeongsang Province. Visitors can experience cultural heritages in the Province, including Gaya.

Haeinsa, one of Korea&#x27;s top three temples, was built in 802 by two monks Seung-woon and Lee Jung. The temple houses various treasures along with Woodblocks of national treasures, including the Tripitaka Koreana and Janggyeong Panjeon.

== Economy ==

<text>The Free Aceh Movement (, GAM; ) was a separatist group seeking independence for the Aceh region of Sumatra, Indonesia. GAM fought against Indonesian government forces in the Aceh insurgency from 1976 to 2005. Estimates of the death toll total over 15,000 people killed.

The organisation surrendered its separatist intentions and dissolved its armed wing following the 2005 peace agreement with the Indonesian government, and subsequently changed its name into Aceh Transition Committee (, KPA). The Indonesian government called the group the &quot;Aceh &quot;.

==Background==

The conflict in Aceh stems from several major factors including historical mistreatment, disagreements over Islamic law, discontent over the distribution of Aceh&#x27;s natural resource wealth, and the increase in the numbers of Javanese people in Aceh.

During the era of Dutch colonisation in the 1800s Aceh was a centre of resistance against Dutch colonial rule. They were one of the last Indonesian peoples to succumb to colonial rule and only after a brutal 30-year campaign, the Aceh War of 1873–1903. When the Netherlands transferred sovereignty of their colonial territory, administration of Aceh was handed over to Indonesia and GAM claims that this was done without consultation with Acehnese authorities. Daud Beureueh mounted an armed rebellion that ended with Aceh being granted special status by President Sukarno. However, President Sukarno had not allowed Aceh to implement sharia law during his reign (1945–1967) due to his strong belief of separation of religion and state.

Motivated by discovery of large gas reserves in Lhokseumawe, a former Darul Islam &quot;foreign minister&quot;, Hasan di Tiro established the Free Aceh Movement (Gerakan Aceh Merdeka) in December 1976. The small movement carried out its first attack on Mobil engineers in 1977, killing one American engineer. Due to this incident, GAM came under the attention of central government who sent small units of counter-insurgency troops that successfully crushed the movement. Di Tiro was nearly killed and was forced to flee to Malaysia while all members of his cabinet were either killed or forced to flee abroad by 1979.

==Armed wing==
* National Acehnese Army or (Acehnese: Teuntra Neugara Aceh) (TNA)
* &quot;Acheh Sumatra National Liberation Front&quot; (ASNLF)
* Laskar Inong Balee

==Guerrilla war==
Since its inception GAM has gone through three stages or three rises and falls. The first was at its birth in 1976 to the year 1979 when it was almost wiped out. The second rise and fall was in 1989 to the early 90s when it received funding and training from foreign countries. The third rise was a result of finally gaining widespread support throughout Aceh as a result of donations and extortion and a large group of potential soldiers who had lost relatives in the previous uprising.

===GAM I===
At first the guerrilla war of GAM was quite unsuccessful. By 1977, the central government appeared to have entirely neutralised the group. The early GAM efforts were mainly directed at the local ExxonMobil gas plant. Di Tiro had connections with the petroleum industry and even bid, via a tender process, on a contract to build a gas pipeline which was beaten by the gas giant Bechtel. The reason for this failure was a lack of popular support from both within Aceh and from international sources. President Suharto was favoured by countries such as The United States of America due to his anti communist policies during the Cold War period and likely due to the need for oil, as a result of the 1970s oil shocks.

===GAM II===
The group renewed its activities in the 1989, apparently with financial support from Libya and Iran, fielding around 1,000 soldiers. This training from overseas meant that GAM soldiers were much more organised and better trained than the previous insurgency. To counter this new threat Aceh was declared an &quot;area of special military operations&quot; (Daerah Operasi Militer) or DOM in 1989. Special counter- insurgency troops were sent in and Aceh was locked down. Villages that were suspected of harbouring GAM operatives were burnt down and family members of suspected militants were kidnapped and tortured. Amnesty International called the military response &quot;shock therapy&quot; and it is believed 7,000 human rights abuses took place during DOM. GAM forces have also been suspected of Human Rights abuses. Extra judicial executions of suspected military informants and targeting of civilian infrastructure such as schools have both been attributed to GAM operations.

In 1996, the Indonesian government announced the end of GAM as the counter-insurgency operations had effectively destroyed GAM as a guerrilla force. Surviving GAM members were forced to hide in Malaysia.

===GAM III===

The fall of Suharto in 1998 and the decision of his successor President Jusuf Habibie to withdraw troops from Aceh as part of democratic reform gave space for GAM to re-establish itself, recruiting youths by exploiting brutality stories of Indonesian military. Increasing violence beginning in 1999 by GAM rebels against government officials and Javanese residents, buoyed by massive weapons smuggling from Thailand by the GAM, led to an increase in military presence. Troop numbers are believed to have risen during the rule of Megawati Sukarnoputri. In 2001–02 the combination of military and police forces in Aceh had grown to about 30,000. In one year this number jumped to 50,000 operating in what the International Crisis group called, &quot;a virtual legal vacuum&quot;. The security crackdowns during this time resulted in several thousand civilian deaths. The government launched a large 2003–04 Indonesian offensive in Aceh against the GAM in 2003 with some success.

==Peace negotiations==
The leaders of GAM, Hasan di Tiro, and his chief deputy, Zaini Abdullah, and Malik Mahmud lived in exile in Stockholm, Sweden for most of the 1980s and 1990s. The group&#x27;s main Indonesian spokesman was Abdullah Syafei&#x27;i Dimatang. In the late 1990s, GAM began peace talks with Jakarta, brokered by the Swedish government.

In 1999, it was reported that the group had split into two factions, GAM (representing the original group) and the Free Aceh Movement Government Council (MP-GAM). This was denied by GAM spokespersons but was widely reported in the Indonesian media.

In December 2002, GAM and GoI signed a breakthrough Cessation of Hostilities Agreement (COHA) which only held for a few months before violations started occurring. The mediator in these negotiations, the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue, did not have adequate monitoring and enforcing mechanisms to enact sanctions for violations.

In 2002–2004, the GAM was severely hit by a series of government offensives in which the organisation lost approximately 50% of its members including its commander, Abdullah Syafei&#x27;i Dimatang, who was killed in a military ambush in January 2002.

On 28 December 2004, in the aftermath of the devastation caused by a massive tsunami, GAM declared a ceasefire of hostilities to allow for aid to reach within the disputed area. In turn, the Indonesian government temporarily removed restrictions of northern Sumatra to allow for rescue efforts in that area.

Other Aceh separatist groups exist and there was some tension between them and GAM over tactics and GAM&#x27;s monopoly of negotiations with the government.

On 27 February 2005, the Free Aceh Movement and the delegation of the Indonesian government started another round of peace talks in Vantaa, Finland, moderated by former Finnish president Martti Ahtisaari. On 16 July 2005, the Indonesian Minister of Communication and GAM announced a peace deal to end the thirty-year insurgency.

The peace agreement was officially signed on 15 August 2005 in the Finnish Government Banquet Hall in Helsinki by chief Indonesian negotiator Hamid Awaluddin and GAM leader Malik Mahmud. President Ahtisaari was the witness of the peace treaty.

Under the terms of the agreement, both sides agreed to cease all hostilities immediately. GAM also agreed to disarm, while the Government pledged to withdraw all non-local military and police by the end of 2005. An Aceh Monitoring Mission was set up by the EU and ASEAN to oversee the process of disarmament and the reintegration into society of GAM members. A presidential decree granted amnesty to about five hundred former GAM members who were in exile in other countries, and unconditionally released about 1,400 members who had been jailed by the Government.

The Government agreed to facilitate the establishment of Aceh-based political parties; this had been one of the most contentious issues in previous negotiations. A &quot;truth and reconciliation commission&quot; will be organised. On the question of the uneven distribution of income, it was settled that seventy percent of the income from local natural resources will stay within Aceh.

On 27 December 2005, the leaders of the Free Aceh Movement announced that they had disbanded their military wing. The action, which took effect immediately, follows from earlier peace talks and the destruction of 840 weapons by international observers, Free Aceh movement commander Sofyan Daud told reporters, &quot;The Aceh national army is now part of civil society, and will work to make the peace deal a success.&quot; As a sign of how the peace process was progressing the founder of Aceh&#x27;s separatist rebel movement, Hasan di Tiro, returned to Indonesia on 11 October 2008 after nearly 30 years in exile.

==2006 elections==

During the election of 11 December 2006, the Free Aceh Movement temporarily split into two factions each supporting its own candidate for governorship. One side supported Zaini Abdullah&#x27;s brother, and the other side supported Irwandi Yusuf, a former GAM negotiator. Irwandi Yusuf got more support from the grass root level and won the election. The losing faction proceeded to bide its time, aiming to make a comeback in the next gubernatorial election in Aceh due at the end of Irwandi&#x27;s five-year term in 2011. In the event, the gubernatorial election due to be held at the end of 2011 was delayed by procedural squabbling as different factions scrambled for advantage. The elections took place in April 2012.

==2012 elections==

The 2012 election, held on 9 April, was largely a continuation of post-agreement rivalries between former GAM leaders, with Zaini Abdullah having returned from exile and entered into the contest for the governorship against Irwandi. Zaini Abdullah, with the strong support of the Aceh Party, won the election with a substantial majority.

<text>A sandworm is a fictional extraterrestrial creature that appears in the &quot;Dune&quot; novels written by Frank Herbert, first introduced in &quot;Dune&quot; (1965).

Sandworms are colossal, worm-like creatures that live on the desert planet Arrakis. Their larvae produce a drug called melange (known colloquially as &quot;the spice&quot;), the most essential and valuable commodity in the universe because it makes safe and accurate interstellar travel possible. Melange deposits are found in the sand seas of Arrakis, where the sandworms live and hunt, and harvesting the spice from the sand is a dangerous activity because sandworms are aggressive and territorial. Harvesting vehicles must be airlifted in and out of the sand sea in order to evade sandworm attacks. The struggle over the production and supply of melange is a central theme of the &quot;Dune&quot; saga. The sandworms are reverently called Shai-Hulud by the planet&#x27;s indigenous Fremen, who worship them as agents of God whose actions are a form of divine intervention. The name is the derived from the Arabic (&quot;šayʾ khulūd&quot;, &quot;thing of eternity&quot;).

==Conception==

The sandworms in &quot;Dune&quot; were inspired by the dragons of European mythology that guard some sort of treasure. In particular, Herbert referred to the dragon in &quot;Beowulf&quot; that guards a hoard of gold in a cave, and the dragon of Colchis that guards the Golden Fleece from Jason. Like these dragons, the sandworms of Arrakis will attack anyone who attempts to take the treasure that is spice from the desert sands, as if they were guarding it. In &quot;Children of Dune&quot; (1976), a character even refers to sandworms as &quot;the dragon on the floor of the desert.&quot; However, in the story, the sandworms are merely territorial and have no use for the spice, which is in fact waste matter produced by their larvae.

In the plot of Frank Herbert&#x27;s novel &quot;Dune&quot;, Herbert used the sandworms (along with the spice they produce) as a plot device to provide Paul Atreides with the trials through which he ascends to a superhuman state of being. Herbert believed that a memorable myth must have something profoundly moving that could either empower the hero or overwhelm him completely. The force in question must be dangerous and terrifying, yet somehow essential. In &quot;Dune&quot;, the sandworms serve this function. To earn the spice, humans must cope with sandworm attacks on their harvesting expeditions. To earn an even greater prize (his apotheosis into the all-seeing Kwisatz Haderach), Paul undergoes even more dangerous and transformative trials in which he risks madness and death, one of which involves the ritual sacrifice of a juvenile sandworm, and another in which he must learn to ride a sandworm.

Sandworms are attracted to rhythmic vibrations in the sand, which they mistake for prey (smaller sandworms). To escape the notice of the sandworms, a traveller in the desert must learn to &quot;walk without rhythm&quot; in a manner that simulates the natural sounds of the desert. This element comes from Frank Herbert&#x27;s experiences as a hunter and fisherman. He knew how to mask his presence from prey by techniques such as approaching from downwind and treading lightly. Frank Herbert&#x27;s son Brian explained that &quot;In &quot;Children of Dune&quot;, Leto II allowed sandtrout to attach themselves to his body, and this was based in part upon my father’s own experiences as a boy growing up in Washington state, when he rolled up his trousers and waded into a stream or lake, permitting leeches to attach themselves to his legs.&quot;

John Schoenherr provided the earliest artwork for the &quot;Dune&quot; series, including the illustrations in the initial pulp magazine serial and the cover of the first hardcover edition. Frank Herbert was very pleased with Schoenherr&#x27;s art, and remarked that he was &quot;the only man who has ever visited Dune&quot;. Schoenherr gave the sandworm three triangular lobes that form the lips of its mouth. This design was referenced for the sandworm puppets that appeared in the 1984 movie adaptation of &quot;Dune&quot;.

==Description==
Sandworms are giant creatures found only on the desert planet Arrakis. They are reverently called Shai-Hulud by the planet&#x27;s indigenous Fremen, who worship them as agents of God whose actions are a form of divine intervention. The Fremen also refer to the sandworms as Makers.

===Physiology===
Herbert describes sandworms as colossal terrestrial annelids with features of the lamprey. They have an array of crystalline teeth which are used primarily for rasping rocks and sand. During his first close encounter with a sandworm in &quot;Dune&quot;, Paul notes, &quot;Its mouth was some eighty meters in diameter... crystal teeth with the curved shape of crysknives glinting around the rim... the bellows breath of cinnamon, subtle aldehydes... acids...&quot;

Sandworms grow to hundreds of meters in length, with specimens observed over long and in diameter, although Paul becomes a sandrider by summoning a worm that &quot;appeared to be&quot; around half a league () or more in length. These gigantic worms burrow deep in the ground and travel swiftly; &quot;most of the sand on Arrakis is credited to sandworm action&quot;.

Sandworms are described as &quot;incredibly tough&quot; by Liet-Kynes, who further notes that &quot;high-voltage electrical shock applied separately to each ring segment&quot; is the only known way to kill and preserve them; atomics are the only explosive powerful enough to kill an entire worm, with conventional explosives being unfeasible as &quot;each ring segment has a life of its own&quot;. Water is poisonous to the worms, but it is in too short supply on Arrakis to be of use against any but the smallest of them.

===Life cycle===
Herbert notes in &quot;Dune&quot; that microscopic creatures called sand plankton feed upon traces of melange scattered by sandworms on the Arrakeen sands. The sand plankton are food for the giant sandworms, but also grow and burrow to become what the Fremen call Little Makers, &quot;the half-plant-half-animal deep-sand vector of the Arrakis sandworm&quot;.

Their leathery remains previously having &quot;been ascribed to a fictional ″sandtrout″ in Fremen folk stories&quot;, Imperial Planetologist Pardot Kynes had discovered the Little Makers during his ecological investigations of the planet, deducing their existence before he actually found one. Kynes determines that these &quot;sandtrout&quot; block off water &quot;into fertile pockets within the porous lower strata below the 280° (absolute) line&quot;, and Alia Atreides notes in &quot;Children of Dune&quot; that the &quot;sandtrout, when linked edge to edge against the planet&#x27;s bedrock, formed living cisterns&quot;. The Fremen themselves protect their water supplies with &quot;predator fish&quot; that attack invading sandtrout. Sandtrout can be lured by small traces of water, and Fremen children catch and play with them; smoothing one over the hand forms a &quot;living glove&quot; until the creature is repelled by something in the &quot;blood&#x27;s water&quot; and falls off. Leto II says in &quot;Children of Dune&quot;:

The sandtrout are described as &quot;flat and leathery&quot; in &quot;Children of Dune&quot;, with Leto II noting that they are &quot;roughly diamond-shaped&quot; with &quot;no head, no extremities, no eyes&quot; and &quot;coarse interlacings of extruded cilia&quot;. They can find water unerringly, and squeezing the sandtrout yields a &quot;sweet green syrup&quot;. When water is flooded into the sandtrout&#x27;s excretions, a pre-spice mass is formed; at this &quot;stage of fungusoid wild growth&quot;, gases are produced which result in &quot;a characteristic &#x27;blow&#x27;, exchanging the material from deep underground for the matter on the surface above it&quot;. After exposure to sun and air, this mass becomes melange.

Kynes&#x27; &quot;water stealers&quot; die &quot;by the millions in each spice blow&quot; and may be killed by even a &quot;five-degree change in temperature&quot;. He notes that &quot;the few survivors entered a semidormant cyst-hibernation to emerge in six years as small (about three meters long) sandworms&quot;. A small number of these then emerge into maturity as giant sandworms, to whom water is poisonous. A &quot;stunted worm&quot; is a &quot;primitive form... that reaches a length of only about nine meters&quot;. Their drowning by the Fremen makes them expel the awareness-spectrum narcotic known as the Water of Life.

While sandworms are capable of eating humans, the latter do contain a level of water beyond the preferred tolerances of the worms. They routinely devour melange-harvesting equipment—mistaking the mechanical rhythm for prey—but they seem to derive actual nutrition only from sand plankton and smaller sandworms, and have no actual interest in the spice. Sandworms will also not attack sandtrout.

===Behavior and function===
In &quot;Dune&quot;, the desert of Arrakis is the only known source of the spice melange, the most essential and valuable commodity in the universe. Used as a drug, melange lengthens life span, increases vitality, and heightens awareness. It can also unlock prescience in some subjects, which makes safe and accurate interstellar travel possible. The harvesting of melange is therefore essential, but is also a highly dangerous undertaking due to the presence of sandworms. Rhythmic activity as minimal as normal walking on the desert surface of Arrakis attracts the territorial worms, which are capable of swallowing even the largest mining equipment whole. They are an accepted obstacle to spice mining, as any attempt to exterminate them would be prohibitively expensive, if not entirely futile. Harvesting is done by a gigantic machine called a Harvester, which is carried to and from a spice blow by a larger craft called a Carryall. The Harvester on the ground has four scouting ornithopters patrolling around it watching for wormsign, the motions of sand which indicate that a worm is coming. Melange is collected from the open sand until a worm is close, at which time the Carryall lifts the Harvester to safety. The Fremen, who base their entire industry around the sale of spice and the manufacture of materials out of spice, have learned to co-exist with the sandworms in the desert and harvest the spice manually for their own use and for smuggling off-planet.

Due to their size and territorial nature, sandworms can be extremely dangerous, even to Fremen. The worms are attracted to—and maddened by—the presence of Holtzman force fields used as personal defense shields, and as a result these shields are of little use on Arrakis. In &quot;Children of Dune&quot; it is noted that a weapon has been developed on Arrakis called a &quot;pseudo-shield&quot;. This device will attract and enrage any nearby sandworm, which will destroy anything in its vicinity. The Fremen manage to develop a unique relationship with the sandworms. They learn to avoid most worm attacks by mimicking the motions of desert animals, moving with the natural sounds of the desert rather than rhythmic vibrations. However, they also develop a device known as a thumper with the express purpose of generating a rhythmic vibration to attract a sandworm. This can be used either as a diversion or to summon a worm to ride.

The Fremen have secretly mastered a way to ride sandworms across the desert. First, a worm is lured by the vibrations of a thumper device. When it surfaces, the lead worm-rider runs alongside it and snares one of its ring-segments with a special &quot;maker hook&quot;. The hook is used to pry open the segment, exposing the soft inner tissue to the abrasive sand. To avoid irritation, the worm will rotate its body so the exposed flesh faces upwards, lifting the rider with it. Other Fremen may then plant additional hooks for steering, or act as &quot;beaters&quot;, hitting the worm&#x27;s tail to make it increase speed. A worm can be ridden for several hundred kilometers and for about half a day, at which point it will become exhausted and sit on the open desert until the hooks are released, whereupon it will burrow back down to rest. Worm-riding is used as a coming-of-age ritual among the Fremen, and Paul&#x27;s riding and controlling a giant sandworm cements him as a Fremen leader. Paul also uses worms for troop transport into the city during the Battle of Arrakeen after using atomic weapons to blow a hole in the Shield Wall. After the reign of Leto II, sandworms become un-rideable. The one exception is a young girl named Sheeana, an Atreides descendant who possesses a unique ability to control the worms and safely move around them.

Fremen also use the sharp teeth of dead sandworms to produce the sacred knives they call crysknives. Approximately long, these hand-to-hand weapons are either &quot;fixed&quot; or &quot;unfixed&quot;. An unfixed knife requires proximity to a human body&#x27;s electrical field to prevent its eventual disintegration, while fixed knives are treated for storage. Fremen tradition dictates that once a crysknife is drawn, it must not be sheathed until it has drawn blood.

==Storylines==

===Original series===
By the time of the events of &quot;Dune&quot; (1965), humans have been harvesting melange from Arrakis for several thousand years. The indigenous Fremen regard the sandworms as divine, but to everyone else, they are just deadly pests. Few people understand the sandworms&#x27; connection to the spice. This is no longer the case by the time of &quot;Children of Dune&quot; (1976), and numerous groups attempt to smuggle sandworms off Arrakis and transplant them to other planets so as to break the Atreides&#x27; monopoly on spice production.

In &quot;Children of Dune&quot;, Leto II consumes massive amounts of spice and allows many sandtrout to cover his body, the concentration of spice in his blood fooling them. This layer gives Leto tremendous strength, speed, and protection from mature sandworms, which mistake his sandtrout-covered body for a lethal mass of water. He calls it a &quot;living, self-repairing stillsuit of a sandtrout membrane&quot;, and soon notes that he is &quot;no longer human&quot;.

Gradually over the next 3,500 years, Leto not only survives, but also is transformed into a hybrid of human and giant sandworm. By the time of &quot;God Emperor of Dune&quot; (1981), he has exterminated all other sandworms, and his own transformation has modified his component sandtrout. When Leto allows himself to be assassinated, the sandtrout release themselves to begin the sandworm lifecycle anew; subsequent offspring are tougher and more adaptable than their predecessors, allowing them to ultimately be more easily settled on other worlds, thus ensuring the survival of the sandworm species. Each one, according to Leto, carries in it a tiny pearl of his consciousness, trapped forever in an unending prescient dream.

Over the next 1500 years, Arrakis (now called Rakis) is returned to a desert by the thriving sandworm cycle. Bene Gesserit Mother Superior Taraza becomes aware in &quot;Heretics of Dune&quot; (1984) that humanity is being limited by the prescient dream of Leto, and controlled by him through his worm remnants. She engineers the destruction of Rakis by the Honored Matres to free humanity, leaving one remaining worm to start the cycle anew. Taraza is killed; her successor Darwi Odrade takes the worm to Chapterhouse. She submerges it in a spice bath to generate sandtrout, with the goal of terraforming their own planet Chapterhouse into another Dune, and later doing the same on other planets, with new worms and infinite potential for gathering spice.

===Prequels and sequels===

In the &quot;Prelude to Dune&quot; prequel trilogy by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson (1999–2004), the Tleilaxu initiate Project Amal, an early attempt to create synthetic melange to eliminate dependence upon Arrakis. They are fundamentally unaware, however, that melange production is part of the sandworm lifecycle, and the project is an abysmal failure.

In &quot;Sandworms of Dune&quot;, Brian Herbert and Anderson&#x27;s 2007 conclusion to the original series, the Spacing Guild is manipulated into replacing its Navigators with Ixian navigation devices and cutting off the Navigators&#x27; supply of melange. Sure to die should they be without the spice, a group of Navigators commissions Waff, an imperfectly awakened Tleilaxu ghola, to create &quot;advanced&quot; sandworms able to produce the melange they so desperately require. He accomplishes this by altering the DNA of the sandtrout stage and creating an aquatic form of the worms, which are then released into the oceans of Buzzell. Adapting to their new environment, these seaworms quickly flourish, eventually producing a highly concentrated form of spice, dubbed &quot;ultraspice&quot;. Meanwhile, sandworms are revealed to have survived the devastation of Rakis after all, by burrowing deep under the surface.

==In adaptations==
===&quot;Dune&quot; (1984)===
In the 1984 David Lynch film &quot;Dune&quot;, the sandworms were designed by special effects modeler Carlo Rambaldi for a budgeted $2 million. Rambaldi had previously created the titular alien for the 1982 film &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot;. The blue screen constructed for &quot;Dune&quot; special effects was thirty-five feet (11 m) high and 108 feet (33 m) wide, the largest at that time. The sandworms were achieved using practical effect models, miniature sets and blue screens. Several scales of sandworm models were created, operated by &quot;worm wranglers&quot; and pulled with cables to simulate motion. The largest models, which were approximately 20 feet (7 m) long, allowed for wranglers to open the worms&#x27; mouths and crane their bodies up and down and from side to side. The smaller versions were used for other movements, and for background action.

Critics were generally not impressed with the film&#x27;s effects. Roger Ebert called Lynch&#x27;s sandworms &quot;striking&quot;, but noted, &quot;the movie&#x27;s special effects don&#x27;t stand up to scrutiny. The heads of the sand worms begin to look more and more as if they came out of the same factory that produced Kermit the Frog (they have the same mouths).&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; Sandra P. Angulo called the sandworms &quot;embarrassingly phallic looking&quot;. Daniel D. Snyder of &quot;The Atlantic&quot; was impressed by the &quot;gargantuan&quot; appearance of the sandworms thanks to the &quot;staggering sense of scale&quot; achieved by the miniature sets created by Emilio Ruiz del Río. Though panning the film overall, Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted the &quot;nice worm-fight at the end of the story.&quot; Hoai-Tran Bui of &quot;/Film&quot; noted that &quot;the popular image of the sandworm comes from David Lynch&#x27;s 1984 film, which depicted the massive creatures as fleshy, phallic-looking monsters.&quot;

===&quot;Dune&quot; (2000) and &quot;Children of Dune&quot; (2003)===
The 2000 Sci Fi Channel miniseries &quot;Frank Herbert&#x27;s Dune&quot;, and the 2003 sequel miniseries &quot;Frank Herbert&#x27;s Children of Dune&quot;, employed computer-generated visual effects to create sandworms onscreen, under the guidance of special effects supervisor Ernest Farino.

Critics praised the visual effects in both miniseries, each of which won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Special Visual Effects for a Miniseries, Movie or a Special. Deborah D. McAdams of &quot;Broadcasting &amp; Cable&quot; suggested that the images of &quot;gigantic computer-generated sandworms munching down huge machines and people like popcorn&quot; contributed to the 2000 miniseries&#x27; record-breaking ratings.

===&quot;Dune&quot; (2021) and &quot;Dune: Part Two&quot; (2024)===
Regarding his 2021 film &quot;Dune&quot;, director Denis Villeneuve said:

VFX production supervisor Paul Lambert explained, &quot;We spent more time working out the animation around the worm than the worm itself [with its large mouth and teeth]. You see the destruction that it creates. We spent time trying to find references of how sand can be displaced so we could copy that.&quot;

===Video games===
Besides film and television adaptations, the &quot;Dune&quot; franchise has been adapted into a series of computer and video games in which sandworms play a part. Sandworms are a featured element in the 1992 real-time strategy video game &quot;Dune II: The Building of a Dynasty&quot;, primarily as destroyers of the player&#x27;s spice Harvesters, assault tanks, and other equipment. In the game, sandworms are computer-controlled forces that lie dormant under the sand until either player- or computer-controlled units come within range, and they will attack indiscriminately. The sandworms can be damaged or destroyed by sonic blasts, a Death Hand explosion, a detonated Spice Bloom, or a self-destructing Devastator, and will disappear when they have been destroyed, reduced to half health, or have eaten three units. Sandworms do not appear until the third missions, and there may be two or three in play at once. Sandworms also appear in &quot;Dune 2000&quot; (1998). They behave somewhat differently than in the previous game, and are present from the first mission. Sandworms will disappear temporarily after devouring five vehicles, but eventually return. &quot;&quot; (2001) features gameplay on four planets, and sandworms are a hazard on Arrakis. Players must also destroy a genetically engineered &quot;Emperor Worm&quot; to complete the game.

==Merchandising==
A line of &quot;Dune&quot; action figures from toy company LJN was released to lackluster sales in 1984. Styled after David Lynch&#x27;s film, the collection included a poseable sandworm. Revell also produced a model kit of a sandworm complete with figures representing Fremen riders. For the 2024 release of Denis Villeneuve&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, AMC Theatres introduced a popcorn bucket with the likeness of the giant sandworm, featuring a lid with flexible plastic &quot;teeth&quot; that appear to consume the moviegoer&#x27;s hand as they reach in. The bucket was satirized by &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and on social media.

==Impact and analysis==
The sandworms have been called &quot;iconic&quot; to the franchise, and &quot;synonymous with the &quot;Dune&quot; series&quot;, having appeared in nearly every novel, on several book covers, and in all of the television, film, and video game adaptations. Hoai-Tran Bui of &quot;/Film&quot; noted that they are an &quot;essential to the narrative of the story&quot;, and Lindsey Romain of &quot;Nerdist&quot; deemed the creatures &quot;extremely important to the plot and the very fiber of the &quot;Dune&quot; universe.&quot; Bella Ross of &quot;Screen Rant&quot; called the sandworms &quot;the embodiment of the perils of colonization.&quot;

William Touponce suggests that Herbert&#x27;s depiction of larval sandworms (or sandtrout), which hold back water in the desert to maintain the arid conditions their sandworm vector requires to thrive, is &quot;an analogy for a stage of consciousness [Paul&#x27;s sister] Alia can feel. Some of the ancestral voices within her mind hold back dangerous forces that could destroy her.&quot; Touponce also describes &quot;the archetypal terrors of confronting Shai-Hulud, the giant sandworm guarding the treasure&quot;.

Sibylle Hechtel analyzes the concept of sandworms in the essay &quot;The Biology of the Sandworm&quot; in &quot;The Science of Dune&quot; (2008).

A hacker group responsible for several major cyberattacks in the 2010s named itself Sandworm, in reference to the fictional organism.

In August 2023, University of Kansas paleontologist Rhiannon LaVine named a newly-discovered, 500-million-year-old marine polychaete worm &quot;Shaihuludia shurikeni&quot; after Herbert&#x27;s fictional sandworms.

<doc id="319789" wikidata="Q108807" url="?curid=319789" title="Bent Larsen">
<text>Jørgen Bent Larsen (4 March 1935 – 9 September 2010) was a Danish chess grandmaster and author. Known for his imaginative and unorthodox style of play, he was the second-strongest non-Soviet player, behind only Bobby Fischer, for much of the 1960s and 1970s. He is considered to be the strongest player born in Denmark and the strongest from Scandinavia until the emergence of Magnus Carlsen.

Larsen was a six-time Danish Champion and a Candidate for the World Chess Championship on four occasions, reaching the semifinal three times. He had multiple wins over all seven World Champions who held the title from 1948 to 1985: Mikhail Botvinnik, Vasily Smyslov, Mikhail Tal, Tigran Petrosian, Boris Spassky, Bobby Fischer, and Anatoly Karpov, but lifetime negative scores against them.

From the early 1970s onward, he divided his years between Las Palmas and Buenos Aires with his Argentinian-born wife Laura Beatriz Benedini. He suffered from diabetes, and he died in 2010 from a cerebral haemorrhage.

== Career ==

=== Early life ===
Larsen was born in Tilsted, near Thisted in Denmark, and was educated at Aalborg Cathedral School. In January 1942, Larsen contracted a number of childhood diseases. Although none had any permanent effects, it was during this period that Larsen discovered chess. He went on to represent Denmark twice in the World Junior Championship, in 1951 at Birmingham (placing fifth) and in 1953 at Copenhagen (placing eighth). He started playing seriously at the age of 17 when he moved to Copenhagen to study civil engineering, but he never graduated, choosing instead to play chess professionally. Furthermore, while at military service, he studied Russian, which was instrumental in assisting him to understand Russian-language chess literature (something Bobby Fischer was also known to have done). He became an International Master at the age of 19 in 1954, from his bronze-medal performance on board one at the Amsterdam Olympiad. He won his first of six Danish Championships in 1954, repeating this feat in 1955, 1956, 1959, 1963 and 1964.

Larsen defeated Friðrik Ólafsson in an exhibition match at Oslo in 1955 by 4½–3½. He took first prize at the Gijón International Chess Tournament in 1956, ahead of Klaus Darga and Jan Hein Donner, and in the same year won at Copenhagen with 8/9.

=== Young Grandmaster ===
Larsen became an International Grandmaster in 1956 with his gold-medal performance on board one at the Moscow Olympiad, where he drew with World Champion Mikhail Botvinnik. He tied for 1st–2nd places at Hastings 1956–57 on 6½/9 with Svetozar Gligorić. At Dallas 1957, he scored 7½/14 for a shared 3rd–4th place; the winners were Gligorić and Samuel Reshevsky.

At the 1957 Wageningen Zonal, he tied for 3rd–4th places, along with Donner, with 12½/17; there were only three qualifying berths, so the two players had to dispute a playoff match. Larsen won by 3–1 over Donner at The Hague 1958 to qualify for his first Interzonal, at Portorož 1958. Larsen could score only 8½/20 for 16th place, and was not close to qualifying. But he scored his first major individual international success by winning Mar del Plata 1958 with 12/15, ahead of William Lombardy, Erich Eliskases, Oscar Panno, and Hermann Pilnik.

Larsen went into a slump beginning with the 1958 Interzonal. He tied 5th–6th in a strong field at Zürich 1959 with 9½/15, behind winner Tal, Gligorić, Paul Keres, and Bobby Fischer. But Larsen placed only 4th in a middle-range field at the 1960 Berg en Dal Zonal 1960 with 5½/9, and did not advance to the Interzonal. He recovered by sharing 1st–2nd places at Beverwijk 1961 on 7½/9 with Borislav Ivkov. At Zürich 1961, he tied for 6th–7th places with 6/11, as Keres won ahead of Tigran Petrosian. At Moscow 1962, he shared 7th–11th places with 7½/15 (Yuri Averbakh won).

=== Challenging for the World title ===

Around this time Larsen diversified his style, switching over to risky and unusual openings in some of his games, to try to throw his opponents off balance; this led to the recovery of his form and further development of his chess. He finished 2nd at the 1963 Halle Zonal with 13/19, behind winner Lajos Portisch, to advance to the Interzonal the next year. At Belgrade 1964, he shared 5th–6th places with 10/17 (Boris Spassky won). He tied for 5th–7th places at Beverwijk 1964 on 9½/15; Keres and Nei won. Larsen&#x27;s unusual openings were on full display at the 1964 Amsterdam Interzonal, where he shared the 1st–4th places on 17/23 with Boris Spassky, Tal, and Vasily Smyslov, advancing as a Candidate.

In the 1965 Candidates&#x27; matches, he defeated Borislav Ivkov at Bled by 5½–2½ but lost a hard-fought semifinal, also at Bled by 4½–5½ to former World Champion Mikhail Tal, who won the tenth game with a complex speculative knight sacrifice in the center. Larsen won a playoff match for alternates, an eventual third-place Candidates&#x27; position, against Efim Geller by 5–4 at Copenhagen 1966 (the first time a Soviet grandmaster had ever been beaten by a non-Soviet in a match). In 1967 he won the Sousse Interzonal with the score of 15½/21 after Fischer withdrew; this placed him 1½ points ahead of the field. He then won his first-round match against Lajos Portisch by 5½–4½ at Poreč 1968. In Malmö, however, he lost the semifinal by 2½–5½ to Boris Spassky, who went on to win the title.

In 1970 he shared 2nd in the Palma de Mallorca Interzonal, on 15/23, behind Bobby Fischer. He reached his top rank in the Elo rating system at the start of 1971, equal third in the world (with Korchnoi, behind Fischer and Spassky) with a rating of 2660. He then defeated Wolfgang Uhlmann by 5½–3½ at Las Palmas 1971. But then he lost the semifinal 0–6 at Denver to Fischer, who also went on to win the title.

Larsen later claimed that his one-sided loss to Fischer was due in part to his condition during the match: &quot;The organizers chose the wrong time for this match. I was languid with the heat and Fischer was better prepared for such exceptional circumstances... I saw chess pieces through a mist and, thus, my level of playing was not good.&quot;

In 1973 he failed to advance from the Leningrad Interzonal; he tied for 5th–6th places with 10/17, with Karpov and Viktor Korchnoi winning. In 1976 he won the Biel Interzonal, but lost his 1977 Candidates&#x27; match, a rematch of their 1968 encounter, to Lajos Portisch by 3½–6½ at Rotterdam. In the Riga Interzonal of 1979, Larsen scored 10/17 for 7th place, and did not advance.

=== Tournament dominance (1965–73) ===

Starting in the mid-1960s, Larsen enjoyed a very successful run in major tournaments around the world, and he and Fischer became the two strongest players outside the Soviet Union. Larsen played in a lot of strong events, at least as many as any other top player, and repeatedly finished ahead of the top Soviet players. He won at Le Havre 1966 with 9/11, ahead of Lev Polugaevsky. At Santa Monica 1966, he placed third with 10/18, behind Spassky and Fischer. He won at Havana 1967 with 15/19, ahead of a strong group that included Mark Taimanov, Smyslov, Polugaevsky, Gligorić, and Miroslav Filip. He shared 2nd–3rd places at Dundee 1967 with 5½/8, behind Gligorić. At Beverwijk 1967, he was 4th with 8½/15 (Spassky won). At Monte Carlo 1967, he shared 3rd–4th with 6/9, behind Fischer and Efim Geller. He shared 1st–2nd at Winnipeg 1967 with 6/9, along with Darga, ahead of Spassky and Keres. He won at Palma de Mallorca 1967 with 13/17, ahead of Smyslov, Botvinnik, Portisch, Gligorić, and Borislav Ivkov. He was awarded the first Chess Oscar in 1967.

Somewhat unusually for the late 1960s, Larsen—as one of the world&#x27;s top players—often entered large Open tournaments run on the Swiss system, and had plenty of success. He won the Canadian Open Chess Championships at Toronto 1968 and St. John&#x27;s 1970. He also won the U.S. Open Chess Championship of 1968 at Aspen, Colorado, and that at Boston in 1970.

Larsen won at Monte Carlo 1968 with 9½/13, ahead of Botvinnik, Smyslov, Vlastimil Hort, Robert Byrne, Portisch, and Pal Benko. This completed a string of five consecutive clear wins of major tournaments, a feat that had not previously been accomplished in modern chess. Larsen shared 2nd–3rd places at Palma de Mallorca 1968 with 13/17, along with Spassky; Viktor Korchnoi won. In a playoff match for third place in the Candidates Tournament, he defeated Tal at Eersel 1969 by 5½–2½ in a rematch of their 1965 encounter. He won at Palma de Mallorca 1969 with 12/17, ahead of Petrosian, Korchnoi, Hort, and Spassky. There was a further victory at Buesum 1969 with 11/15, ahead of Polugaevsky. At San Juan 1969, he scored 9/15 for a shared 6th–7th place (Spassky won). He defeated International Master Heikki Westerinen by 6–2 at Helsinki in 1969 in a match in which every game was decisive.

Larsen won at Lugano 1970 with 9½/14, ahead of Olafsson. In the USSR vs Rest of the World match at Belgrade 1970, he played first board for the World side, ahead of Fischer, and scored 2½/4 against Spassky and Leonid Stein. At Leiden 1970, he shared 3rd–4th places with 5½/12, (Spassky won). He defeated Lubomir Kavalek in a 1970 exhibition match at Solingen by 6–2. He won at Vinkovci 1970 with 10½/15, ahead of David Bronstein, Hort, and Gligorić. At Palma de Mallorca 1970, he shared 6th–7th places with 9/15 (Panno and Ljubomir Ljubojević were joint winners). Larsen shared 8th–9th places at San Antonio 1972 on 8½/15 (Portisch, Petrosian, and Karpov triumphed). He won at Teesside 1972 with 11/15, ahead of Ljubojević and Portisch. At Las Palmas 1972, he shared 2nd–3rd places on 11/15 (Portisch won).

Larsen won at Hastings 1972–73 on 11½/15, ahead of Wolfgang Uhlmann. At Bauang 1973, he scored 6/9 for 4th place (Kavalek won). Larsen won at Grenaa 1973 in the Nordic Championship with 8½/10. He won again at Manila 1973 with 12½/15, ahead of Ljubojević and Kavalek. In 1975, Larsen defeated Danish Champion and future International Master Gert Iskov at Gellerup by the score of 5½–½ and lost a match to GM Ulf Andersson by the score of 5½–2½ at Stockholm the same year.

=== Olympiad performances ===
He represented Denmark six times in Chess Olympiad play, always on first board, and compiled an aggregate score of 75/109 (+61 −20 =28), for 68.8%. He always played a very high number of games and in 1954 played a maximum of 19 games. He won three board medals, one gold and two bronze.

* Amsterdam 1954, board one, 13½/19 (+11 −3 =5), board bronze medal;
* Moscow 1956, board one, 14/18 (+11 −1 =6), board gold medal;
* Munich 1958, board one, 13/19 (+11 −4 =4);
* Havana 1966, board one, 11/18 (+9 −5 =4);
* Lugano 1968, board one, 10½/18 (+8 −5 =5);
* Siegen 1970, board one, 13/17 (+11 −2 =4), board bronze medal.

=== Later career ===
In 1988 he lost a game to Deep Thought in the Software Toolworks Championship, becoming the first Grandmaster and, at the time, the player with the highest Elo rating (by then 2560) to be defeated by a computer in tournament play. In 1993 Larsen won a return match against the supercomputer Deep Blue in Copenhagen by 2½–1½.

Despite his advancing age, Larsen continued to play in tournaments. In 1999, he finished 7th out of 10 in the Danish Championship, but in the 2000 event he was forced to withdraw when he became seriously ill with an edema which required brain surgery. Thereafter he only played a few tournaments in Buenos Aires. He was 4th in the 2002 Najdorf Memorial knock-out.

Larsen&#x27;s final tournament was Magistral Internacional Ruibal 2008 in Buenos Aires. He delivered a poor performance and lost all nine games he played. In the April 2009 FIDE list, he had an Elo rating of 2415.

He died in Buenos Aires in September 2010. According to the English Chess Federation Newsletter, &quot;His health had been poor for some considerable time and he had been virtually inactive for years&quot;.

== Playing style and authorship ==

Larsen was known as a deep-thinking and highly imaginative player, more willing to try unorthodox ideas and to take more risks than most of his peers. This aspect of his play could even manifest itself in his choice of openings. Grandmaster Samuel Reshevsky wrote that Larsen &quot;is a firm believer in the value of surprise&quot;, and that led him to resort to &quot;dubious variations in various openings.&quot; He also wrote that while Larsen &quot;has a great deal of confidence in his game and fears no one&quot;, his style was &quot;extremely effective against relatively weak opponents but has not been too successful against top-notchers.&quot;
He was one of the very few modern grandmasters to have employed Bird&#x27;s Opening (1.f4) with any regularity, and had a long-term association with the move 1.b3, a system commonly known as Larsen&#x27;s Opening or the Nimzo–Larsen Attack in his (and Aron Nimzowitsch&#x27;s) honor. He played the Dutch Defence with success at a time when the opening was rarely seen at the top level. He revived the almost dormant Bishop&#x27;s Opening (1.e4 e5 2.Bc4) with success in 1964 and explored new ways for Black to seek activity in the Philidor Defence (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 d6). Indeed, he wrote a short monograph on the Philidor, &quot;Why Not The Philidor Defense?&quot;, in 1971. He was also the first top player to successfully use the Grand Prix Attack against the Sicilian Defence (1.e4 c5 2.f4), spurring a sudden and sustained gain in its popularity. In the mid-1960s, he showed surprising faith in Alekhine&#x27;s Defence (1.e4 Nf6) and even employed it on important occasions. He played the rare Scandinavian Defence 1.e4 d5 to defeat World Champion Anatoly Karpov in 1979, sparking renewed interest in that variation. A favourite line in the Caro–Kann Defence (1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 dxe4 4.Nxe4 Nf6 5.Nxf6+ gxf6) is co-named for him and David Bronstein; the idea is to accept a weakness to the Black pawn structure in exchange for an unbalancing of the position and retaining the bishop pair.

Larsen&#x27;s 1969 book &quot;Larsen&#x27;s Selected Games of Chess, 1948–69&quot; contained annotations that delved into chess psychology and the effective use of rare openings. A chapter of the book gives some of Larsen&#x27;s thoughts on his own style, and he upholds the views of Polugaevsky and Gligorić that he indulged in flank attacks and favored the advance of rooks&#x27; pawns more than other contemporary masters. He was also content to be described as an aggressive player, stemming from his dislike of draws. He disputed the notion that he would willingly accept dubious positions in order to complicate tactics, a characteristic he attributed more to Tal. The book was first published in Denmark; an English-language version followed in 1970 and was sub-titled &quot;Master of Counter-Attack&quot;.

Larsen was one of seven top grandmasters who wrote chapters for the 1974 book &quot;How to Open a Chess Game&quot;. He edited the tournament book for San Antonio 1972. When Ken Smith played most of his games in that event with the white pieces using the Smith-Morra Gambit, Larsen quipped—after one of Smith&#x27;s opponents responded to 1.e4 with 1...e6, entering a French Defence and avoiding the gambit—&quot;stronger was c5, winning a pawn!&quot; He also wrote the well-received &quot;Karpov Vs. Korchnoi: World Chess Championship, 1978&quot;, which was published within days of the match ending and was the first book in any language on the 1978 World Championship match.

The Grünfeld Defence (1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 d5) was another opening that became a frequent choice of Larsen with the Black pieces, and similarly he placed considerable reliance on Grünfeld-Indian systems as White. This led him to co-author, with Steffen Zeuthen, a 1979 book on this opening titled &quot;Zoom 001 Zero Hour for Operative Chess Opening Models&quot;.

== Notable games ==
*Bent Larsen vs. Boris Spassky, Amsterdam Interzonal 1964, Bird&#x27;s Opening (A03), 1–0 Larsen successfully played unusual openings in this tournament, and here he uses one of them to knock off a top Soviet, on his way to winning the tournament.

*Mikhail Botvinnik vs. Bent Larsen, Leiden 1970, Dutch Defense, Classical Variation (A90), 0–1 Larsen outplays another former World Champion in a long endgame.
*Bobby Fischer vs. Bent Larsen, Palma de Mallorca Interzonal 1970, Sicilian Defence, Velimirovic Attack (B89), 0–1 Larsen surprised Fischer, who was then nearly invincible, with an opening innovation, and plays a near-perfect game to win.
*Anatoly Karpov vs. Bent Larsen, Montreal 1979, Scandinavian Defence (B01), 0–1 Larsen springs a rare opening on the World Champion, and is rewarded with success.
*Viswanathan Anand vs. Bent Larsen, Roquebrune 1992, Sicilian (B27), 0–1 Larsen beats a future World Champion using Larsen&#x27;s favourite opening.

== Early life and education ==

Vaira Vīķe was born in Riga, Latvia. At the end of 1944, as the second Soviet occupation of Latvia began, her parents escaped to Nazi Germany. There she received her first education in Latvian primary school at a displaced persons camp in Lübeck, Germany, where her baby sister died. Then her family moved to Casablanca in French Morocco in 1949. There, she learnt French at a primary school at the Daourat hydroelectric dam village. She then went on to attend &quot;Collège de jeunes filles de Mers-Sultan&quot; in Casablanca. In 1954 her family moved to Toronto, Ontario, Canada, where she completed high school.

Vīķe attended Victoria College of the University of Toronto, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in 1958 and a Master of Arts in 1960, in psychology. She worked at the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce as a teller and part-time as a supervisor in Branksome Hall Boarding School for Girls. In 1958, being fluent in English, French, Latvian, Spanish and German, she worked as a translator and the next year went on to work as a Spanish teacher for grades 12 and 13 at Ontario Ladies&#x27; College.

During this period she authored ten books and about 160 articles, essays or book chapters and has given over 250 speeches, allocutions and scientific communications in English, French or Latvian, and gave numerous radio, TV and press interviews in various languages.

<doc id="319799" wikidata="Q186316" url="?curid=319799" title="Ayman al-Zawahiri">
<text>Ayman Mohammed Rabie al-Zawahiri (; 19 June 195131 July 2022) was an Egyptian-born pan-Islamist militant and physician who served as the second general emir of al-Qaeda from June 2011 until his death in July 2022. He is best known for being one of the main orchestrators of the September 11 attacks.

Al-Zawahiri graduated from Cairo University with a degree in medicine and a master&#x27;s degree in surgery and was a surgeon by profession. He became a leading figure in the Egyptian Islamic Jihad, an Egyptian Islamist organization, and eventually attained the rank of emir. He was imprisoned from 1981 to 1984 for his role in the assassination of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat. His actions against the Egyptian government, including his planning of the 1995 attack on the Egyptian Embassy in Pakistan, resulted in him being sentenced to death &quot;in absentia&quot; during the 1999 &quot;Returnees from Albania&quot; trial.

A close associate of al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, al-Zawahiri held significant sway over the group&#x27;s operations. He was wanted by the United States and the United Nations, respectively, for his role in the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania and in the 2002 Bali bombings. He merged the Egyptian Islamic Jihad with al-Qaeda in 2001 and formally became bin Laden&#x27;s deputy in 2004. He succeeded bin Laden as al-Qaeda&#x27;s leader after bin Laden&#x27;s death in 2011. In May 2011, the U.S. announced a $25 million bounty for information leading to his capture.

On July 31, 2022, al-Zawahiri was killed in a CIA drone strike in Afghanistan.

== Personal life ==

=== Early life ===
Ayman al-Zawahiri was born on 19 June 1951 in Giza, Egypt to Mohammed Rabie al-Zawahiri and Umayma Azzam.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; in 2001 described al-Zawahiri as coming from &quot;a prosperous and prestigious family that gives him a pedigree grounded firmly in both religion and politics&quot;. Al-Zawahiri&#x27;s parents both came from prosperous families. Al-Zawahiri&#x27;s father, Mohammed Rabie al-Zawahiri, came from a large family of doctors and scholars from Kafr Ash Sheikh Dhawahri, Sharqia, in which one of his grandfathers was Sheikh Mohammed al-Ahmadi al-Zawahiri (1887–1944) who was the 34th Grand Imam of al-Azhar. Mohammed Rabie became a surgeon and a professor of pharmacy at Cairo University. Ayman Al-Zawahiri&#x27;s mother, Umayma Azzam, came from a wealthy, politically active clan, the daughter of Abdel-Wahhab Azzam, a literary scholar who served as the president of Cairo University, the founder and inaugural rector of the King Saud University (the first university in Saudi Arabia) as well as ambassador to Pakistan, while his own brother was Azzam Pasha, the founding secretary-general of the Arab League (1945–1952). From his maternal side yet another relative was Salem Azzam, an Islamist intellectual and activist, for a time secretary-general of the &quot;Islamic Council of Europe&quot; based in London. The wealthy and prestigious family is also linked to the Red Sea Harbi tribe in Zawahir, a small town in Saudi Arabia, located in the Badr.
He also has a maternal link to the house of Saud: Muna, the daughter of Azzam Pasha (his maternal great-uncle), is married to Mohammed bin Faisal Al Saud, the son of the late King Faisal.

Ayman Al-Zawahiri said that he has a deep affection for his mother. Her brother, Mahfouz Azzam, became a role model for him as a teenager. He has a younger brother, Muhammad al-Zawahiri, a younger sister, Heba Mohamed al-Zawahiri, and a twin sister, Umnya al-Zawahiri. Heba became a professor of medical oncology at the National Cancer Institute, Cairo University. She described her brother as &quot;silent and shy&quot;. Muhammad was sentenced on charges of undergoing military training in Albania in 1998. He was arrested in the UAE in 1999, and sentenced to death in 1999 after being extradited to Egypt. He was held in Tora Prison in Cairo as a political detainee. Security officials said he was the head of the Special Action Committee of Islamic Jihad, which organized terrorist operations. After the Egyptian popular uprising in the spring of 2011, on March 17, 2011, he was released from prison by the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, the interim government of Egypt. His lawyer said he had been held to extract information about his brother Ayman al-Zawahiri. On March 20, 2011, he was re-arrested. On August 17, 2013, Egyptian authorities arrested Muhammad al-Zawahiri at his home in Giza. He was acquitted in 2017.

==== Youth ====
Ayman al-Zawahiri was reportedly a studious youth. He excelled in school, loved poetry, and &quot;hated violent sports&quot;, which he thought were &quot;inhumane.&quot; Al-Zawahiri studied medicine at Cairo University and graduated in 1974 with &quot;gayyid giddan&quot;, or roughly on par with a grade of &quot;B&quot; in the American grading system. Following that, he served 1974–1978 as a surgeon in the Egyptian Army after which he established a clinic near his parents in Maadi. In 1978, he also earned a master&#x27;s degree in surgery. He spoke Arabic, English, and French.

Al-Zawahiri participated in youth activism as a student. He became both quite pious and political, under the influence of his uncle Mahfouz Azzam, and lecturer Mostafa Kamel Wasfi. Sayyid Qutb preached that to restore Islam and free Muslims, a vanguard of true Muslims modeling itself after the original Companions of the Prophet had to be developed. Ayman al-Zawahiri was influenced by Qutb&#x27;s Manichaean views on Islamic theology and Islamic history.

==== Underground cell ====
By the age of 15, al-Zawahiri had formed an underground cell with the goal to overthrow the government and establish an Islamist state. The following year the Egyptian government executed Sayyid Qutb for conspiracy. Following the execution, al-Zawahiri, along with four other secondary school students, helped form an &quot;underground cell devoted to overthrowing the government and establishing an Islamist state.&quot; It was at this early age that al-Zawahiri developed a mission in life, &quot;to put Qutb&#x27;s vision into action.&quot; His cell eventually merged with others to form al-Jihad or Egyptian Islamic Jihad.

=== Marriages and children ===
Ayman al-Zawahiri was married at least four times. His wives include Azza Ahmed Nowari and Umaima Hassan.

In 1978, al-Zawahiri married his first wife, Azza Ahmed Nowari, a student at Cairo University who was studying philosophy. Their wedding, which was held at the Continental Hotel in Opera Square, was very conservative, with separate areas for both men and women, and no music, photographs, or gaiety in general. Many years later, when the United States attacked Afghanistan following the September 11 attacks in October 2001, Azza apparently had no idea that al-Zawahiri had supposedly been a jihadi emir (commander) for the last decade.

Al-Zawahiri and his wife, Azza, had four daughters, Fatima (born 1981), Umayma (born 1983), Nabila (born 1986), and Khadiga (born 1987), and a son, Mohammed (also born in 1987; the twin brother of Khadiga), who was a &quot;delicate, well-mannered boy&quot; and &quot;the pet of his older sisters,&quot; subject to teasing and bullying in a traditionally all-male environment, who preferred to &quot;stay at home and help his mother.&quot; In 1997, ten years after the birth of Mohammed, Azza gave birth to their fifth daughter, Aisha, who had Down syndrome. In February 2004, Abu Zubaydah was waterboarded and subsequently stated that Abu Turab Al-Urduni had married one of al-Zawahiri&#x27;s daughters.

Ayman al-Zawahiri&#x27;s first wife Azza and two of their six children, Mohammad and Aisha, were killed in an airstrike on Afghanistan by US forces in late December 2001, following the September 11 attacks on the U.S. After an American aerial bombardment of a Taliban-controlled building at Gardez, Azza was pinned under the debris of a guesthouse roof. Concerned for her modesty, she &quot;refused to be excavated&quot; because &quot;men would see her face&quot; and she died from her injuries the following day. Her son, Mohammad, was also killed outright in the same house. Her four-year-old daughter with Down syndrome, Aisha, had not been hurt by the bombing, but died from exposure in the cold night while Afghan rescuers tried to save Azza.

In the first half of 2005, one of Al-Zawahiri&#x27;s three surviving wives gave birth to a daughter, named Nawwar.

In June 2012, one of al-Zawahiri&#x27;s four wives, Umaima Hassan, released a statement on the internet congratulating the role played by Muslim women in the Arab Spring. She is also known to have written a leaflet explaining women&#x27;s role in jihad.

== Medical career ==
In 1981, Ayman al-Zawahiri traveled to Peshawar, Pakistan, where he worked in a Red Crescent hospital treating wounded refugees. There, he became friends with Ahmed Khadr, and the two shared a number of conversations about the need for Islamic government and the needs of the Afghan people.

Ayman al-Zawahiri worked as a surgeon. In 1985, al-Zawahiri went to Saudi Arabia on Hajj and stayed to practice medicine in Jeddah for a year. As a reportedly qualified surgeon, when his organization merged with bin Laden&#x27;s al-Qaeda, he became bin Laden&#x27;s personal advisor and physician. He had first met bin Laden in Jeddah in 1986. According to other sources, they met the first time in 1986 at a hospital in Peshawar.

In 1993, al-Zawahiri traveled to the United States, where he addressed several mosques in California under his &quot;Abdul Mu&#x27;iz&quot; pseudonym, relying on his credentials from the Kuwaiti Red Crescent to raise money for Afghan children who had been injured by Soviet land mines—he raised only $2000.

== Militant activity ==

=== Assassination plots ===

==== Egypt ====
In 1981, Al-Zawahiri was one of hundreds arrested following the assassination of President Anwar Sadat. Initially, the plan was derailed when authorities were alerted to Al-Jihad&#x27;s plan by the arrest of an operative carrying crucial information, in February 1981. President Sadat ordered the roundup of more than 1,500 people, including many Al-Jihad members, but missed a cell in the military led by Lieutenant Khalid Islambouli, who succeeded in assassinating Sadat during a military parade that October. His lawyer, Montasser el-Zayat, said that al-Zawahiri was tortured in prison.

In his book, &quot;Al-Zawahiri as I Knew Him&quot;, Al-Zayat maintains that under torture by the Egyptian police, following his arrest in connection with the murder of Sadat in 1981, Al-Zawahiri revealed the hiding place of Essam al-Qamari, a key member of the Maadi cell of al-Jihad, which led to Al-Qamari&#x27;s &quot;arrest and eventual execution.&quot; He was released from prison in 1984.

In 1993, al-Zawahiri&#x27;s and Egyptian Islamic Jihad&#x27;s (EIJ) connection with Iran may have led to a suicide bombing in an attempt on the life of Egyptian Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi, the man heading the effort to quash the campaign of Islamist killings in Egypt. It failed, as did an attempt to assassinate Egyptian prime minister Atef Sidqi three months later. The bombing of Sidqi&#x27;s car injured 21 Egyptians and killed a schoolgirl, Shayma Abdel-Halim. It followed two years of killings by another Islamist group, al-Gama&#x27;a al-Islamiyya, that had killed over 200 people. Her funeral became a public spectacle, with her coffin carried through the streets of Cairo and crowds shouting, &quot;Terrorism is the enemy of God!&quot; The police arrested 280 more of al-Jihad&#x27;s members and executed six.

For their leading role in anti-Egyptian Government attacks in the 1990s, al-Zawahiri and his brother Muhammad al-Zawahiri were sentenced to death in the 1999 Egyptian case of the Returnees from Albania.

==== Pakistan ====
The 1995 attack on the Egyptian embassy in Islamabad, Pakistan, was carried out by the Egyptian Islamic Jihad under al-Zawahiri&#x27;s leadership, but Bin Laden had disapproved of the operation. The bombing alienated Pakistan, which was &quot;the best route into Afghanistan&quot;.

In July 2007, Al-Zawahiri supplied direction for the Lal Masjid siege, codename Operation Silence. This was the first confirmed time that Al-Zawahiri was taking militant steps against the Pakistani Government and guiding Islamic militants against the State of Pakistan. The Pakistan Army troops and Special Service Group taking control of the Lal Masjid (&quot;Red Mosque&quot;) in Islamabad found letters from al-Zawahiri directing Islamic militants Abdul Rashid Ghazi and Abdul Aziz Ghazi, who ran the mosque and adjacent madrasah. This conflict resulted in 100 deaths.

On December 27, 2007, al-Zawahiri was also implicated in the assassination of former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.

==== Sudan ====
In 1994, the sons of Ahmad Salama Mabruk and Mohammed Sharaf were executed under al-Zawahiri&#x27;s leadership for betraying Egyptian Islamic Jihad; the militants were ordered to leave the Sudan.

==== United States ====

In 1998, Ayman al-Zawahiri was listed as under indictment in the United States for his role in the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings: a series of attacks on August 7, 1998, in which hundreds of people were killed in simultaneous truck bomb explosions at the United States embassies in the major East African cities of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and Nairobi, Kenya.

In 2000, the USS &quot;Cole&quot; bombing encouraged several members to depart. Mohammed Atef escaped to Kandahar, al-Zawahiri to Kabul, and Bin Laden also fled to Kabul, later joining Atef when he realised no American reprisal attacks were forthcoming.

On October 10, 2001, al-Zawahiri appeared on the initial list of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation&#x27;s top 22 Most Wanted Terrorists, which was released to the public by U.S. President George W. Bush. In early November 2001, the Taliban government announced they were bestowing official Afghan citizenship on him, as well as Bin Laden, Mohammed Atef, Saif al-Adl, and Shaykh Asim Abdulrahman.

=== Organizations ===
==== Egyptian Islamic Jihad ====
Al-Zawahiri began reconstituting the Egyptian Islamic Jihad (EIJ) along with other exiled militants.

In Peshwar, al-Zawahiri was thought to have become radicalized by other Al-Jihad members, abandoning his old strategy of a swift coup d&#x27;état to change society from above, and embracing the idea of takfir. In 1991, EIJ broke with al-Zumur, and al-Zawahiri grabbed &quot;the reins of power&quot; to become EIJ leader.

Ayman al-Zawahiri was previously the second and last &quot;emir&quot; of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad, having succeeded Abbud al-Zumar in the latter role when Egyptian authorities sentenced al-Zumar to life imprisonment. Ayman al-Zawahiri eventually became one of Egyptian Islamic Jihad&#x27;s leading organizers and recruiters. Al-Zawahiri&#x27;s hope was to recruit military officers and accumulate weapons, waiting for the right moment to launch &quot;a complete overthrow of the existing order.&quot; Chief strategist of Al-Jihad was Aboud al-Zumar, a colonel in the military intelligence whose plan was to kill the main leaders of the country, capture the headquarters of the army and State Security, the telephone exchange building, and of course the radio and television building, where news of the Islamic revolution would then be broadcast, unleashing – he expected – &quot;a popular uprising against secular authority all over the country.&quot;

==== Maktab al-Khadamat ====
In Peshawar, he made contact with Osama bin Laden, who was running a base for &quot;mujahideen&quot; called Maktab al-Khadamat (MAK); founded by the Palestinian Sheikh Abdullah Yusuf Azzam. The radical position of al-Zawahiri and the other militants of Al-Jihad put them at odds with Sheikh Azzam, with whom they competed for bin Laden&#x27;s financial resources. Al-Zawahiri carried two false passports, a Swiss one in the name of Amin Uthman and a Dutch one in the name of Mohmud Hifnawi.

British journalist Jason Burke wrote: &quot;Al-Zawahiri ran his own operation during the Afghan war, bringing in and training volunteers from the Middle East. Some of the $500 million the CIA poured into Afghanistan reached his group.&quot;

Former FBI agent Ali Soufan mentioned in his book &quot;The Black Banners&quot; that Ayman al-Zawahiri is suspected of ordering Azzam&#x27;s assassination in 1989.

==== Al-Qaeda ====
According to reports by a former al-Qaeda member, al-Zawahiri worked in the al-Qaeda organization since its inception and was a senior member of the group&#x27;s &quot;shura&quot; council. He was often described as a &quot;lieutenant&quot; to Osama bin Laden, though bin Laden&#x27;s chosen biographer has referred to him as the &quot;real brains&quot; of al-Qaeda.

On February 23, 1998, al-Zawahiri issued a joint fatwa with Osama bin Laden under the title &quot;World Islamic Front Against Jews and Crusaders&quot;. Al-Zawahiri, not bin Laden, is thought to have been the actual author of the fatwa.

Bin Laden and al-Zawahiri organized an al-Qaeda congress on June 24, 1998. A week prior to the beginning of the conference, a group of well-armed assistants to al-Zawahiri had left by jeeps in the direction of Herat. Following the instructions of their patron, in the town of Koh-i-Doshakh, they met three unknown Slavic-looking men who had arrived from Russia via Iran. After their arrival in Kandahar, they split up. One of the Russians was directly escorted to al-Zawahiri and he did not participate in the conference. Western military intelligence succeeded in acquiring photographs of him, but he disappeared for six years. According to Axis Globe, in 2004, when Qatar and the U.S. investigated Russian embassy officials whom the United Arab Emirates had arrested in connection to the murder of Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev in Qatar, computer software precisely established that a man who had walked to the Russian embassy in Doha was the same one who visited al-Zawahiri prior to the Al-Qaida conference.

Al-Zawahiri was placed under international sanctions in 1999 by the United Nations&#x27; Al-Qaida and Taliban Sanctions Committee as a member of the Salafi-jihadist group al-Qaeda.

In June 2001, al-Zawahiri formally merged the Egyptian Islamic Jihad into al-Qaeda.

In late 2001, a computer was seized that was stolen from an office used by al-Qaeda immediately after the fall of Kabul in November. This computer was mainly used by al-Zawahiri and contained the fraudulent letter used to arrange the meeting between two al-Qaeda attackers posing as journalists and Ahmad Shah Massoud. The journalists who conducted the interview assassinated Massoud on September 9, 2001.

===== Emergence as al-Qaeda&#x27;s chief commander =====
In late 2004 bin Laden named al-Zawahiri officially as his deputy. On April 30, 2009, the U.S. State Department reported that al-Zawahiri had emerged as al-Qaeda&#x27;s operational and strategic commander, and that Osama bin Laden was now only the ideological figurehead of the organization. After the 2011 death of bin Laden, a senior U.S. intelligence official said intelligence gathered in the raid showed that bin Laden remained deeply involved in planning: &quot;This compound (where bin Laden was killed) in Abbottabad was an active command-and-control center for al-Qaeda&#x27;s leader. He was active in operational planning and in driving tactical decisions within al-Qaeda.&quot;

Following the death of bin Laden, former U.S. Deputy National Security Advisor for Combating Terrorism Juan Zarate said that al-Zawahiri would &quot;clearly assume the mantle of leadership&quot; of al-Qaeda. A senior U.S. administration official said that although al-Zawahiri was likely to be al-Qaeda&#x27;s next leader, his authority was not &quot;universally accepted&quot; among al-Qaeda&#x27;s followers, particularly in the Gulf region. Zarate said that al-Zawahiri was more controversial and less charismatic than bin Laden. Rashad Mohammad Ismail (AKA &quot;Abu Al-Fida&quot;), a leading member of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, stated that al-Zawahiri was the best candidate.

Hamid Mir is reported to have said that he believed that Ayman al-Zawahiri was the operational head of al-Qaeda, and that &quot;[h]e is the person who can do the things that happened on September 11.&quot; Within days of the attacks, al-Zawahiri&#x27;s name was put forward as bin Laden&#x27;s second-in-command, with reports suggesting he represented &quot;a more formidable US foe than bin Laden.&quot;

===== Formal appointment =====
Al-Zawahiri became the leader of al-Qaeda following the May 2, 2011 killing of Osama bin Laden. His succession to that role was announced on several of their websites on June 16, 2011. On the same day, al-Qaeda renewed its position that Israel was an illegitimate state and that it would not accept any compromise on Palestine.

The delayed announcement led some analysts to speculate that there was quarreling within al-Qaeda: &quot;It doesn&#x27;t suggest a vast reservoir of accumulated goodwill for him,&quot; said one celebrity journalist on CNN. Both U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mike Mullen maintain that the delay didn&#x27;t signal any kind of dispute within al-Qaeda, and Mullen reiterated U.S. death threats toward al-Zawahiri. According to US officials within the Obama administration and Robert Gates, al-Zawahiri would find the leadership difficult as, while intelligent, he lacks combat experience and the charisma of Osama bin Laden.

=== Activities in Iran ===
Al-Zawahiri allegedly worked with the Islamic Republic of Iran on behalf of al-Qaeda. Author Lawrence Wright reports that EIJ operative Ali Mohammed &quot;told the FBI that al-Jihad had planned a coup in Egypt in 1990.&quot; Al-Zawahiri had studied the 1979 Islamist Islamic Revolution and &quot;sought training from the Iranians&quot; as to how to duplicate their feat against the Egyptian government.

In public, al-Zawahiri harshly denounced the Iranian government. In December 2007, he said, &quot;We discovered Iran collaborating with America in its invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq.&quot; In the same video messages, he moreover chides Iran for &quot;repeating the ridiculous joke that says that al-Qaida and the Taliban are agents of America,&quot; before playing a video clip in which Ayatollah Rafsanjani says, &quot;In Afghanistan, they were present in Afghanistan, because of Al-Qa&#x27;ida; and the Taliban, who created the Taliban? America is the one who created the Taliban, and America&#x27;s friends in the region are the ones who financed and armed the Taliban.&quot;

Al-Zawahiri&#x27;s criticism of Iran&#x27;s government continues when he states,
Al-Zawahiri said that &quot;Iran of the Islamic Nation.&quot;

In April 2008, al-Zawahiri blamed Iranian state media and Al-Manar for perpetuating the &quot;lie&quot; that &quot;there are no heroes among the Sunnis who can hurt America as no-one else did in history&quot; in order to discredit the Al Qaeda network. Al-Zawahiri was referring to some 9/11 conspiracy theories that claim that Al Qaeda was not responsible for the 9/11 attacks.

On the seventh anniversary of the attacks of September 11, 2001, al-Zawahiri released a 90-minute tape in which he &quot;the guardian of Muslims in Tehran&quot; for recognizing &quot;the two governments&quot; in Iraq and Afghanistan.

=== Activities in Russia ===
At some point in 1994, al-Zawahiri was said to have &quot;become &quot; but is thought to have traveled widely to &quot;Switzerland and Sarajevo&quot;. A fake passport he was using shows that he traveled to Malaysia, Taiwan, Singapore, and Hong Kong.

On December 1, 1996, Ahmad Salama Mabruk and Mahmud Hisham al-Hennawi – both carrying false passports – accompanied al-Zawahiri on a trip to Chechnya, where they hoped to re-establish the faltering Jihad. Their leader was traveling under the pseudonym &quot;Abdullah Imam Mohammed Amin&quot;, and trading on his medical credentials for legitimacy. The group switched vehicles three times, but were arrested within hours of entering Russian territory and spent five months in a Makhachkala prison awaiting trial. The trio pleaded innocence, maintaining their disguise while other al-Jihad members from &quot;Bavari-C&quot; sent the Russian authorities pleas for leniency for their &quot;merchant&quot; colleagues who had been wrongly arrested. Russian Member of Parliament Nadyr Khachiliev echoed the pleas for their speedy release as al-Jihad members Ibrahim Eidarous and Tharwat Salah Shehata traveled to Dagestan to plead for their release. Shehata received permission to visit the prisoners. He is believed to have smuggled $3000 to them, which was later confiscated, and to have given them a letter which the Russians didn&#x27;t bother to translate. In April 1997 the trio were sentenced to six months, were subsequently released a month later, and absconded without paying their court-appointed attorney Abulkhalik Abdusalamov his $1,800 legal fee, citing &quot;poverty&quot;. Shehata was sent on to Chechnya where he met with Ibn Khattab.

There have been doubts as to the true nature of al-Zawahiri&#x27;s encounter with the Russians in 1996. Jamestown Foundation scholar Evgenii Novikov has argued that it seems unlikely that the Russians would not have been able to determine who he was, given Russia&#x27;s well-trained Arabists and the suspicious acts of Muslims crossing borders illegally with multiple Arabic false identities and encrypted documents. Assassinated former FSB secret service officer Alexander Litvinenko alleged, among other things, that during this time al-Zawahiri was trained by the FSB and that he was not the only link between al-Qaeda and the FSB. Former KGB officer, Voice of America commentator and writer Konstantin Preobrazhenskiy supported Litvinenko&#x27;s claim. He said that Litvinenko &quot;was responsible for securing the secrecy of Al-Zawahiri&#x27;s arrival in Russia, who was trained by FSB instructors in Dagestan, Northern Caucasus, during 1996–1997.&quot;

=== Activities in Egypt ===

Al-Zawahiri was convicted of dealing in weapons and received a three-year sentence, which he completed in 1984, shortly after his conviction.

Al-Zawahiri learned of a &quot;Nonviolence Initiative&quot; organized in Egypt to end the terror campaign that had killed hundreds and resulting government crackdown that had imprisoned thousands. Al-Zawahiri angrily opposed this &quot;surrender&quot; in letters to the London newspaper &quot;Al-Sharq al-Awsat&quot;. Together with members of al-Gama&#x27;a al-Islamiyya, he helped organize a massive attack on tourists at the Temple of Hatshepsut to sabotage the initiative by provoking the government into repression.

The attack by six men dressed in police uniforms succeeded in machine-gunning and hacking to death 58 foreign tourists and four Egyptians, including &quot;a five-year-old British child and four Japanese couples on their honeymoons,&quot; and devastated the Egyptian tourist industry for a number of years. Nonetheless, the Egyptian reaction was not what al-Zawahiri had hoped for. The attack so stunned and angered Egyptian society that Islamists denied responsibility. Al-Zawahiri blamed the police for the killing, but also held the tourists responsible for their own deaths for coming to Egypt,
Al-Zawahiri was sentenced to death &quot;in absentia&quot; in 1999 by an Egyptian military tribunal.

=== Activities and whereabouts after the September 11 attacks ===
In December 2001, al-Zawahiri published a book entitled &quot;Fursan Rayat al Nabi&quot; (&quot;Knights Under the Prophet&#x27;s Banner&quot;) which outlined ideologies of al-Qaeda. English translations of this book were published; excerpts are available online.



Following the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan, al-Zawahiri&#x27;s whereabouts were unknown, but he was generally thought to be in tribal Pakistan. Although he released videos of himself frequently, al-Zawahiri did not appear alongside bin Laden in any of them after 2003. In 2003, it was rumored that he was under arrest in Iran, although this was later discovered to be false.

On January 13, 2006, the Central Intelligence Agency, aided by Pakistan&#x27;s ISI, launched an airstrike on Damadola, a Pakistani village near the Afghan border where they believed al-Zawahiri was located. The airstrike was supposed to kill al-Zawahiri and this was reported in international news over the following days. Many victims of the airstrike were buried unidentified. Anonymous U.S. government officials claimed that some terrorists were killed and the Bajaur tribal area government confirmed that at least four terrorists were among the dead. Anti-American protests broke out around the country and the Pakistani government condemned the U.S. attack and the loss of innocent life.

On August 1, 2008, CBS News reported that it had obtained a copy of an intercepted letter dated July 29, 2008, from unnamed sources in Pakistan, which urgently requested a doctor to treat al-Zawahiri. The letter indicated that al-Zawahiri was critically injured in a US missile strike at Azam Warsak village in South Waziristan on July 28 that also reportedly killed al Qaeda explosives expert Abu Khabab al-Masri. Taliban Mehsud spokesman Maulvi Umar told the Associated Press on August 2, 2008, that the report of al-Zawahiri&#x27;s injury was false.

In early September 2008, Pakistan Army claimed that they &quot;almost&quot; captured al-Zawahiri after getting information that he and his wife were in the Mohmand Agency, in northwest Pakistan. After raiding the area, officials didn&#x27;t find him.

== General Emir of al-Qaeda ==
In two videos posted on Jihadist websites in 2012, al-Zawahiri called on Muslims to &quot;capture&quot; foreign citizens to leverage the release of Omar Abdel-Rahman, mastermind of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing.

In June 2013, al-Zawahiri arbitrated against the merger of the Islamic State of Iraq with the Syrian-based Jabhat al-Nusra into Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant as was declared in April by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Abu Mohammad al-Julani, leader of al-Nusra Front, affirmed the group&#x27;s allegiance to al-Qaeda and al-Zawahiri.

In September 2015, al-Zawahiri urged Islamic State (ISIL) to stop fighting al-Nusra Front, the official al-Qaeda affiliate in Syria, and to unite with all other jihadists against the supposed alliance between America, Russia, Europe, Shiites and Iran, and Bashar al-Assad&#x27;s Alawite regime.

Ayman al-Zawahiri released a statement supporting jihad in Xinjiang against Chinese, jihad in the Caucasus against the Russians and naming Somalia, Yemen, Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan as battlegrounds. al-Zawahiri endorsed &quot;jihad to liberate every span of land of the Muslims that has been usurped and violated, from Kashgar to Andalusia, and from the Caucasus to Somalia and Central Africa&quot;. Uyghurs inhabit Kashgar, the city which was mentioned by al-Zawahiri. In another statement he said, &quot;My mujahideen brothers in all places and of all groups ... we face aggression from America, Europe, and Russia ... so it&#x27;s up to us to stand together as one from East Turkestan to Morocco&quot;. In 2015, the Turkistan Islamic Party (East Turkistan Islamic Movement) released an image showing Al Qaeda leaders Ayman al-Zawahiri and Osama Bin Laden meeting with Hasan Mahsum.

The Uyghurs East Turkestan independence movement was endorsed in the serial &quot;Islamic Spring&quot;&#x27;s 9th release by Al-Zawahiri. Al-Zawahiri confirmed that the Afghanistan war after 9/11 included the participation of Uyghurs and that the jihadists like Zarwaqi, Bin Ladin and the Uyghur Hasan Mahsum were provided with refuge together in Afghanistan under Taliban rule. Uyghur fighters were praised by al-Zawahiri, before a Turkistan Islamic Party performed a Bishkek bombing on August 30. Uighur jihadists were hailed by Ayman al-Zawahiri.

Doğu Türkistan Bülteni Haber Ajansı reported that the Uyghur Turkistan Islamic Party was praised by Abu Qatada along with Abdul Razzaq al Mahdi, Maqdisi, Muhaysini and al-Zawahiri.

Abu Muhammad al-Maqdisi and Abu Qatada were referenced by Muhaysini. Osama bin Laden and al-Zawahiri were by Muhaysini.

The Rewards for Justice Program of the U.S. Department of State offered a reward of up to US$25 million for information about al-Zawahiri&#x27;s location.

On July 31, 2022, al-Zawahiri was killed in a US strike in Kabul, Afghanistan. He had been rumoured to be in Pakistan&#x27;s tribal area or inside Afghanistan. His death is considered to be the biggest hit to the terrorist group since Osama Bin Laden was killed in 2011. Others described his death as &quot;anticlimactic to Al Qaeda&#x27;s demise&quot;, stating &quot;[h]is moves as leader of the shrinking group were watched more by analysts than by jihadists&quot; at the time of his death.

=== Promotional activities ===
Al-Zawahiri placed supreme importance on winning public support, and castigated Abu Musab al-Zarqawi in this regard: &quot;In the absence of this popular support, the Islamic mujahid movement would be crushed in the shadows.&quot;

==== Online Q&amp;A ====
In mid-December 2007, al-Zawahiri&#x27;s spokespeople announced plans for an &quot;open interview&quot; on a handful of Islamic Web sites. The administrators of four known jihadist web sites have been authorized to collect and forward questions, &quot;unedited&quot;, they pledge, and &quot;regardless of whether they are in support of or are against&quot; al-Qaeda, which would be forwarded to al-Zawahiri on January 16. al-Zawahiri responded to the questions later in 2008; among the things he said were that al-Qaeda didn&#x27;t kill innocents, and that al-Qaeda would move to target Israel &quot;after expelling the occupier from Iraq&quot;.

== Views ==

=== Islamism ===
As a leader of Egyptian Islamic Jihad, al-Zawahiri conceived of Islamism in Egypt as a revolutionary movement of heroic fighters who the masses would join in the wake of their victories. The movement was mostly a failure, including its crushing defeat and suppression by the Egyptian government following the assassination of Anwar Sadat. The popular uprising envisioned by al-Zawahiri never came to be, and some Islamist leaders agreed to cease-fire terms with the government. After these events, al-Zawahiri joined Al-Qaeda, which had aims that were international in scope and was focused on the conflict with the United States rather than the ongoing localized conflict with the secular regime in Egypt.

=== Loyalty and enmity ===
In a lengthy treatise titled &quot;Loyalty and Enmity&quot;, al-Zawahiri said that Muslims must at all times be loyal to Islam and to one another, while hating or avoiding everything and everyone outside of Islam.

=== Female combatants ===
Al-Zawahiri said in an April 2008 interview that the group does not have women combatants and that a woman&#x27;s role is limited to caring for the homes and children of al-Qaeda fighters. This resulted in a debate regarding the role of mujahid women like Sajida Mubarak Atrous al-Rishawi.

===Iranians===
In 2008 he claimed that &quot;Persians&quot; are the enemy of Arabs and that Iran cooperated with the U.S. during the occupation of Iraq.

== Death ==
Al-Zawahiri was killed on July 31, 2022, shortly after 6:00 a.m. local time in an early-morning drone strike conducted by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency in the upscale Sherpur neighborhood of Kabul, reportedly in a house owned by a top aide to Sirajuddin Haqqani, a senior official in the Taliban government.

In a statement to reporters, a senior administration official said &quot;over the weekend, the United States conducted a counterterrorism operation against a significant Al Qaeda target in Afghanistan. The operation was successful and there were no civilian casualties.&quot; The United States Department of Defense denied responsibility for the strike, while the United States Central Command declined to comment. On August 1, delayed by two days to allow time for proper verification of the operation&#x27;s success, President Joe Biden announced at the White House that the U.S. Intelligence Community had located al-Zawahiri as he moved into downtown Kabul in early 2022 and that President Biden had authorized the operation a week prior. Biden also stated that the operation did not harm any members of al-Zawahiri&#x27;s family or other civilians.

According to U.S. government sources, Al-Zawahiri was killed by Hellfire missiles fired from a Reaper drone. Press sources have speculated that the missiles may have been R9X Hellfire missiles, which are designed to kill by impact and with blades instead of explosion to avoid unintended casualties.

Al Qaeda in December 2022 released a video it stated was narrated by al-Zawahiri. The video was undated and did not mention when the recording of the audio was done. In February 2023, the United Nations reported that many member countries believed Saif al-Adel to be the de facto successor of al-Zawahiri, but al-Qaeda had not formally named him to probably avoid scrutiny against the Taliban for giving shelter to the latter and due to al-Adel living in Iran.

<doc id="319801" wikidata="Q3180297" url="?curid=319801" title="Joey Aiuppa">
<text>Joseph John Aiuppa (December 1, 1907 – February 22, 1997), also known as &quot;Joey O&#x27;Brien&quot; and &quot;Joey Doves&quot;, was a Chicago mobster who became a leader of the Chicago Outfit from 1971 until his skimming conviction in 1986.

== Early career ==
Joseph Aiuppa was born in Melrose Park, Illinois, the eldest son of Simone (Sam) Aiuppa (1883-1934) and Rosalia (Rose) Marie Greco (1886-1968), Sicilian immigrants from Lascari, Province of Palermo, Sicily.

During the 1920s, former boxer Aiuppa rose through the ranks of the Chicago Outfit, beginning as a driver for higher ranking Outfit leaders such as Tony Accardo.

He graduated to operate several gambling establishments in Cicero, Illinois. These clubs included bookmaking establishments and underground casinos with secret entrances. In the early 1930s, Aiuppa managed Taylor &amp; Company, ostensibly a furniture manufacturer though in actuality a front for manufacturing illegal slot machines. Aiuppa was a charter member of Local 450 Union for Hotel and Restaurant Employees. A member of the Capone Mob, Aiuppa also had connections to John Dillinger and the Karpis Gangs. In 1935, Chicago crime files indicated Aiuppa as a trigger man and expert bank robber for Claude Maddox.

Beginning in the late 1940s and well into the 1960s, Aiuppa was in charge of the Cicero district of the Outfit. The Cicero district was the highest-earning neighborhood for decades, going back to Al Capone, who headquartered out of this area while he was in command. Aiuppa eventually owned or operated several establishments in Cicero, collectively called the Strip. This was the original &quot;strip&quot; before the mob-controlled casino strip in Las Vegas. Aiuppa operated handbooks at 4835, 4811, and 4818 Cermak Road in Cicero, IL. The various clubs located on Cicero Avenue were the Frolics, the Towne Hotel, the 411 Club, and a few others. Prostitution, slot machines, and various gaming activities occurred inside these nightclubs.

Aiuppa also owned it for many years and eventually sold the Navajo Hills golf course outside suburban Chicago. This was one of his many real-estate dealings that he made money on with his personal take and share of running the most powerful and successful Outfit neighborhood for decades. Aiuppa operated his real estate holdings under &quot;Rosemar Realty&quot;, named after his mother, Rose Marie. From time to time, Aiuppa also put cars or small real estate in her name, as he would rarely keep any assets in his name except for the home in which he resided in Oak Brook, Illinois. He also used other relatives, including brothers and later nephews, to hold title to his many constantly changing real-estate assets in and around the Chicago area.

== &quot;Joey O&#x27;Brien&quot; and &quot;Joey Doves&quot; ==
For almost 40 years, Aiuppa&#x27;s original nickname was his old boxing name, &quot;Joey O&#x27;Brien&quot;, often abbreviated in mob circles to just &quot;O&#x27;Brien&quot; or &quot;Joey O.&quot; Irish boxers got paid more on the fight card in those days so Aiuppa chose an Irish name to fight under. This was one of his last known jobs before he started as a driver for the Outfit.

In a move reminiscent of Al Capone&#x27;s prosecution for tax evasion, Aiuppa was convicted in 1966 for the unlawful possession and transportation of mourning doves across state lines. Under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918, possessing more than 24 doves per person is illegal outside of hunting season. In September 1962, as part of Robert F. Kennedy&#x27;s crackdown on the Chicago Outfit, FBI agents in Kansas searching Aiuppa&#x27;s car discovered 563 frozen doves. Following a series of appeals, Aiuppa was eventually sentenced in August 1966 and received a three-month jail sentence and a $1,000 fine. As a result, Aiuppa gained various nicknames like &quot;Joey Doves&quot;, &quot;Joey the Doves&quot;, &quot;Doves&quot;, and &quot;Mourning Doves&quot;.

== Leadership ==
Joey Aiuppa gained control of the Chicago Outfit after the death of Sam Giancana, who had strong support from Paul Ricca and Tony Accardo. Aiuppa became the boss in 1971 after Felix Anthony &quot;Milwaukee Phil&quot; Alderisio was sent to prison. Under the leadership of Aiuppa, the Chicago Outfit grew stronger ties to its Las Vegas Casinos. Eventually, he became one of several de facto leaders running The Outfit in Chicago. Following his indictment and subsequent imprisonment, Joseph Ferriola ran the Outfit from 1985 until 1988. Aiuppa&#x27;s chauffeur driver and protégé, Samuel Carlisi, took over leadership operations shortly after.

Sometime following the murder of Giancana, Aiuppa bought a house in Palm Springs, California, as had several other Chicago mobsters.

== Conviction and retaliation ==
In 1986, Aiuppa was convicted of skimming profits from Las Vegas casinos and received 28 years in prison. In 1986, Jackie Cerone took over control after the semi-retirements of Accardo and Aiuppa as leaders of the Chicago Outfit. The convictions of five mob ties to skimming $2 million from Las Vegas Casinos evolved with Joseph Agosto from the Kansas City crime family testifying against the bosses. Among the few that were imprisoned included Aiuppa, Carl DeLuna, Angelo J. LaPietra, and Jackie Cerone. LaPietra was a top enforcer for Aiuppa in the Chicago Outfit and early years in Cicero crime operations. From prison, Aiuppa chose John &quot;No Nose&quot; DiFronzo to run criminal operations in Chicago&#x27;s western suburbs over acting boss Ferriola. In June 1986, Tony &quot;the Ant&quot; Spilotro and his brother Michael were beaten to death in Bensenville, Illinois, and buried in a cornfield in Enos, Indiana, five miles from Aiuppa property near Morocco, Indiana. Nicholas Calabrese, a member of the Outfit, testified that both Spilotro brothers were killed in a home in Bensenville, Illinois and then buried in the cornfields in Indiana. Calabrese is known to be the first made-man to testify against the Chicago Outfit. His nephew, Frank Calabrese Jr., was also an informant for the FBI. Calabrese Jr. is the son of notorious mobster Frank Calabrese Sr. However, in a 2010 interview with &quot;Maxim&quot; magazine, while promoting the opening of the Las Vegas Mob Experience at the Tropicana Hotel, Tony Spilotro&#x27;s son Vincent claimed that the real target was his uncle Michael, and Tony was killed to prevent any revenge.

== Release from prison and death ==
Serving nearly 10 years of his sentence, on January 19, 1996, Aiuppa was released from the U.S. Bureau of Prisons Federal Medical Center at Rochester, Minnesota. On February 22, 1997, Aiuppa died at Elmhurst Memorial Hospital in Elmhurst, Illinois. He was buried in Hillside, Illinois at the Queen of Heaven Cemetery.

Aiuppa&#x27;s nephew Sam Aiuppa is a member of the IATSE Projectionists Local 110 union and does not share how he became part of the union. Sam Giancana&#x27;s nephew, Andrew Giancana, was on the board for the IATSE. The IATSE Projectionists Local 110 in Chicago was once widely believed to be one of the U.S. most mobbed-up locals.

== Filmography ==
The film &quot;Casino&quot;, directed by Martin Scorsese in 1995, is based on the Chicago Outfit ties to the Las Vegas Casino industry. The events that occur in the movie are based on the relationship between the associates of the Chicago Mob and Las Vegas businessman Frank &quot;Lefty&quot; Rosenthal. The character of Remo Gaggi, played by Pasquale Cajano, is based on Aiuppa. Other portrayals include Robert De Niro as main character Sam &quot;Ace&quot; Rothstein, based on Rosenthal, and Joe Pesci as Nicky Santoro, based on Chicago enforcer Anthony Spilotro.

<doc id="319802" wikidata="Q7098058" url="?curid=319802" title="Ophiussa">
<text>Ophiussa, also spelled Ophiusa, is the ancient name given by the ancient Greeks to what is now Portuguese territory near the mouth of the river Tagus. It means Land of Serpents.

== The expulsion of the &quot;Oestrimni&quot; ==
The 4th century Roman poet Rufius Festus Avienius, writing on geographical subjects in &quot;Ora Maritima&quot; (&quot;Seacoasts&quot;), a document inspired by a Greek mariners&#x27; Periplus, related that the &quot;Oestriminis&quot; (&quot;Extreme West&quot; in Latin) was peopled by the &quot;Oestrimni&quot;, a people who had been living there for a long time; they had to flee their homeland after an invasion of serpents. These people could be linked to the &quot;Saephe&quot; (Saefs) or &quot;Ophis&quot; (&quot;People of the Serpents&quot;) and the &quot;Dragani&quot; (&quot;People of the Dragons&quot;), who came to those lands and built the territorial entity the Greeks termed &quot;Ophiussa&quot;.

The expulsion of the Oestrimni, from &quot;Ora Maritima:&quot;
The &quot;serpent people&quot; of the semi-mythical Ophiussa in the far west are noted in ancient Greek sources.

==Land of the &quot;Ophi&quot;==
The &quot;Ophi&quot; people lived mainly in the inland mountains of Northern Portugal (and Galicia). Others say they lived mainly by the estuaries of the rivers Douro and Tagus. The &quot;Ophi&quot; worshiped serpents, hence &quot;Land of Serpents&quot;. There have surfaced a few archeological findings that could be related to this people or culture. Some believe that the dragon sometimes represented as a griffin, from the original Winged Serpent, or Wyvern (the traditional Portuguese &quot;Serpe Real&quot;), old crest of the crown of the Kings of Portugal and later of the Emperors of Brazil, is linked to local people or to the Celts who had previously invaded the area and could also have been the influence for the &quot;Ophi&quot; cult.

==&quot;Ophi&quot; legend==
A legend relates that on the summer solstice a maiden-serpent, a chthonic goddess, reveals hidden treasures to people journeying through forests. This maiden would live in the city of Porto. Festivities related to this goddess occurred during the solstice. During the rest of the year, she would change into a snake living under or among rocks, and shepherds would set aside some milk from their flocks as an offering to her.

<doc id="319804" wikidata="Q239768" url="?curid=319804" title="Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties">
<text>The Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT) is an international agreement that regulates treaties among sovereign states.

Known as the &quot;treaty on treaties&quot;, the VCLT establishes comprehensive, operational guidelines, rules, and procedures for how treaties are drafted, defined, amended, and interpreted. An international treaty is a written agreement between countries subject to international law that stipulates their consent to the creation, alteration, or termination of their rights and obligations, as stipulated in the treaty. 

The Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties was adopted and opened to signature on 23 May 1969, became effective on 27 January 1980, and has been ratified by 116 sovereign states as of January 2018. Non-ratifying parties, such as the U.S, have recognized parts of the VCLT as a restatement of customary international law. In treaty law, the VCLT is the authority for resolving disputes about the interpretation of a treaty.

==History==
The Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT) was drafted by the International Law Commission (ILC) of the United Nations, which began work on the convention in 1949. During the 20 years of preparation, several draft versions of the convention and commentaries were prepared by special rapporteurs of the ILC, which included prominent international law scholars James Brierly, Hersch Lauterpacht, Gerald Fitzmaurice, and Humphrey Waldock.

In 1966, the ILC adopted 75 draft articles, which formed the basis for its final work. Over two sessions in 1968 and 1969, the Vienna Conference completed the convention, which was adopted on 22 May 1969 and opened for signature on the following day.

==Content and effects==
In the practices of international law, the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties is the legal authority about the formation and effects of a treaty. The legal standing of the VCLT is recognised by non-signator countries, such as the U.S. and India, as legally binding upon all sovereign states who have recognised the customary-law status of the Vienna Convention.

The VCLT defines a treaty as &quot;an international agreement concluded between [sovereign] states in written form and governed by international law&quot;, and affirms that &quot;every state possesses the capacity to conclude treaties.&quot; Article 1 of the VCLT restricts the application of the convention to written treaties between states, excluding treaties concluded between the states and international organizations or between international organizations. Article 11 defines &quot;means of expressing consent to be bound by a treaty&quot; including ratification, acceptance, approval or accession. Article 26 defines &quot;pacta sunt servanda&quot;, that agreements must be kept; Article 53 defines &quot;jus cogens&quot;, peremptory norm; Article 62 defines Fundamental Change of Circumstance, which determines the validity or invalidity of a treaty; and Article 77 defines depositary, the organisation or person who holds a multilateral treaty.

==Scope==
The Vienna Convention applies only to treaties agreed after the VCLT was ratified, and to treaties agreed between sovereign states, but does not govern other agreements between sovereign states and international organizations, or between international organizations, if any VCLT rules are independently binding upon such international organizations. In practise, Article 2 and Article 5 of the Vienna Convention apply to treaties between sovereign states and an intergovernmental organization.

However, agreements between states and international organizations or between international organizations themselves are governed by the 1986 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties between States and International Organizations or Between International Organizations if it enters into force. Furthermore, in treaties between states and international organizations, the terms of the Convention still apply between the state members. The Convention does not apply to unwritten agreements.

==Parties to the convention==
As of January 2018, there are 116 state parties that have ratified the convention, and a further 15 states have signed but have not ratified the convention. In addition, the Republic of China (Taiwan), which is currently recognized by , signed the Convention in 1970 prior to the UN General Assembly&#x27;s 1971 vote to transfer China&#x27;s seat to the People&#x27;s Republic of China, which subsequently acceded to the convention. There are 66 UN member states that have neither signed nor ratified the convention.

==Vienna formula==
=== Signature, ratification and accession ===
International treaties and conventions contain rules about what entities could sign, ratify or accede to them. Some treaties are restricted to states that are members of the UN or parties to the Statute of the International Court of Justice. In rare cases, there is an explicit list of the entities that the treaty is restricted to. More commonly, the aim of the negotiating states (most or all of which usually end up becoming the founding signatories) is that the treaty is not restricted to particular states and so a wording like &quot;this treaty is open for signature to &quot;States&quot; willing to accept its provisions&quot; is used (the &quot;all states formula&quot;).

In the case of regional organizations, such as the Council of Europe or the Organization of American States, the set of negotiating states that once agreed upon may sign and ratify the treaty is usually limited to its own member states, and non-member states may accede to it later. However, sometimes a specific set of non-member states or non-state actors may be invited to join negotiations. For example, the Council of Europe invited the &quot;non-member States&quot; Canada, the Holy See (Vatican City), Japan, Mexico and the United States to &quot;participate in the elaboration&quot; of the 2011 Istanbul Convention and specifically allowed the European Union (described as an &quot;International Organisation&quot;, rather than a &quot;State&quot;) to sign and ratify the convention, rather than accede to it, and &quot;other non-member States&quot; were allowed only accession.

The act of signing and ratifying a treaty as a negotiating state has the same effect as the act of acceding to a treaty (or &quot;acceding a treaty&quot;) by a state that was not involved in its negotiation. Usually, accessions occur only after the treaty has entered into force, but the UN Secretary-General has occasionally accepted accessions even before a treaty went into force. The only downside of not being a negotiating state is that one has no influence over the contents of a treaty, but one is still allowed to declare reservations concerning specific provisions of the treaty that one wishes to accede to (Article 19).

=== Statehood question ===
When a treaty is open to &quot;States&quot;, it may be difficult or impossible for the depositary authority to determine which entities are States. If the treaty is restricted to Members of the United Nations or Parties to the Statute of the International Court of Justice, there is no ambiguity. However, a difficulty has occurred as to possible participation in treaties when entities that appeared otherwise to be States could not be admitted to the United Nations or become Parties to the Statute of the International Court of Justice because of the opposition for political reasons of a permanent member of the Security Council or have not applied for ICJ or UN membership. Since that difficulty did not arise as concerns membership in the specialized agencies, on which there is no &quot;veto&quot; procedure, a number of those States became members of specialized agencies and so were in essence recognized as States by the international community. Accordingly, to allow for as wide a participation as possible, several conventions then provided that they were also open for participation to state members of specialized agencies. The type of entry-into-force clause used in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties was later called the &quot;Vienna formula&quot;, and various treaties, conventions and organizations used its wording.

Some treaties that use it include provisions that in addition to these States any other State invited by a specified authority or organization (commonly the United Nations General Assembly or an institution created by the treaty in question) can also participate, thus making the scope of potential signatories even broader.

==Interpretation of treaties==
Articles 31–33 of the VCLT entail principles for interpreting conventions, treaties, etc. These principles are recognized as representing customary international law, for example by the International Law Commission (ILC).

The interpretational principles codified in Article 31 are to be used before applying those of Article 32, which explicitly states that it offers supplementary means of interpretation.

The European Court of Justice has also applied the interpretational provisions of the VCLT in different cases, including the &quot;Bosphorus Queen Case&quot; (2018), in which the court interpreted the extent of the term &quot;any resources&quot; in Article 220(6) of UNCLOS.

The VCLT is often relied upon in investment arbitration cases.

<text>Tintin in America () is the third volume of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, the comics series by Belgian cartoonist Hergé. Commissioned by the conservative Belgian newspaper for its children&#x27;s supplement , it was serialized weekly from September 1931 to October 1932 before being published in a collected volume by in 1932. The story tells of young Belgian reporter Tintin and his dog Snowy who travel to the United States, where Tintin reports on organized crime in Chicago. Pursuing a gangster across the country, he encounters a tribe of Blackfoot Native Americans before defeating the Chicago crime syndicate.

Following the publication of &quot;Tintin in the Congo&quot;, Hergé researched a story set in the United States, desiring to reflect his concerns regarding the treatment of American Indian communities by the U.S. government. Bolstered by a publicity stunt, &quot;Tintin in America&quot; was a commercial success in Belgium and was soon republished in France. Hergé continued &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; with &quot;Cigars of the Pharaoh&quot;, and the series became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. In 1945, &quot;Tintin in America&quot; was re-drawn and colored in Hergé&#x27;s style for republication by Casterman, with further alterations made at the request of his American publisher for a 1973 edition. The critical reception of the work has been mixed, with commentators on &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; arguing that although it represents an improvement on the preceding two installments, it still reflects many of the problems that were visible in them. The story was adapted for both the 1976–77 West End play &quot;Tintin&#x27;s Great American Adventure&quot; and the 1991 Ellipse/Nelvana animated series &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, which aired as the series finale.

==Synopsis==
In 1932, Tintin, a reporter for , goes with his dog Snowy on an assignment to Chicago, Illinois, to fight against the city&#x27;s organised crime syndicate. While travelling by taxi, their taxi driver is held at gunpoint by police and the police hijack their taxi alongside Tintin and Snowy. Soon after arriving there, their taxi is collided by another car with Tintin being injured. Tintin and Snowy are kidnapped by gangsters and brought before Pietro and his mobster boss Al Capone, whose criminal enterprises in the Congo were previously thwarted by Tintin. With Snowy&#x27;s help, Tintin subdues his captors, but as he goes to inform the police, they reject his claims, and the gangsters escape while Tintin is away. After surviving attempts on his life, Tintin meets Capone&#x27;s rival Bobby Smiles, who heads the Gangsters&#x27; Syndicate of Chicago. After Smiles is held at gunpoint, Tintin falls down to the basement and smoke billows everywhere as Tintin collapses on to the ground. He is being rescued by Nick and they place an unconscious Tintin into Lake Michigan but regains consciousness. Tintin is unpersuaded by Smiles&#x27; attempt to hire him, and after Tintin orchestrates the arrest of his gang, Smiles escapes and heads west.

Tintin pursues Smiles to the Midwestern town of Redskin City. Here, Smiles convinces the Blackfoot Confederacy that Tintin is their enemy, and when Tintin arrives dressed as a cowboy, he is captured and threatened with execution. After escaping, Tintin discovers a source of underground petroleum. Oil companies offer Tintin large sums of money for the land, but after Tintin states that the Blackfoot actually own the land, the United States Army forces them to leave and oil companies build a city on the site within 24 hours. Tintin evades a lynch mob and a wildfire before coming across train tracks which he decides to follow in order to get back to civilization and continue on Smiles&#x27; trail. However, he is ambushed by the gangster and one of his associates, who ties him down to the tracks to be killed by a train scheduled to come through. However, the train happens to stop right before running him over and he is safely rescued, allowing him to continue on his search and find Smiles&#x27; remote hideaway cabin. After a brief altercation, he finally captures the gangster.

Returning to Chicago with his prisoner, Tintin is praised as a hero, but gangsters kidnap Snowy and send Tintin a ransom note. After changing back into civvies, Tintin started his shift as a newspaper delivery boy but in the flat, a loud howling sound is heard as Tintin races up the flat to rescue Snowy but it is a baby crying with his mother after all. At the police station, Tintin is questioned by police about the kidnapping of Snowy. Tracing the kidnappers to a local mansion, Tintin hides in a suit of armor and frees Snowy from the dungeon. The following day, Tintin is invited to a cannery, but it is a trap set by gangsters, who trick him into falling into the meat-grinding machine. Tintin is saved when the machine workers go on strike and then apprehends the mobsters. In thanks, he is invited to a banquet in his honor, where he is kidnapped. His captors tie him to a dumbbell and throw him into Lake Michigan to drown, but Tintin survives by floating to the surface, with his dumbbell having been accidentally replaced with a fake. Gangsters posing as police capture him, but he once again overwhelms them and hands them over to the authorities. Finally, Tintin&#x27;s success against the gangsters is celebrated by a ticker-tape parade, following which he returns to Europe.

==History==

===Background===
Georges Remi—best known under the pen name Hergé—was the editor and illustrator of (&quot;&quot;The Little Twentieth&quot;), a children&#x27;s supplement to (&quot;The Twentieth Century&quot;&quot;), a conservative Belgian newspaper based in Hergé&#x27;s native Brussels. Run by the Abbé Norbert Wallez, the paper described itself as a &quot;Catholic Newspaper for Doctrine and Information&quot; and disseminated a far-right, fascist viewpoint. According to Harry Thompson, such political ideas were common in 1930s Belgium, and Hergé&#x27;s milieu was permeated with conservative ideas revolving around &quot;patriotism, Catholicism, strict morality, discipline, and naivety&quot;.

In 1929, Hergé began &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; comic strip for , about the exploits of fictional young Belgian reporter Tintin. Having been fascinated with the outdoor world of Scouting and the way of life he called &quot;Red Indians&quot; since boyhood, Hergé wanted to set Tintin&#x27;s first adventure among the Native Americans in the United States. However, Wallez ordered him to set his first adventure in the Soviet Union as a piece of anti-socialist propaganda for children (&quot;Tintin in the Land of the Soviets&quot;) and the second had been set in the Belgian Congo to encourage colonial sentiment (&quot;Tintin in the Congo&quot;).

&quot;Tintin in America&quot; was the third story in the series. At the time, the Belgian far-right was deeply critical of the United States, as it was of the Soviet Union. Wallez—and to a lesser degree Hergé—shared these opinions, viewing the country&#x27;s capitalism, consumerism, and mechanization as a threat to traditional Belgian society. Wallez wanted Hergé to use the story to denounce American capitalism and had little interest in depicting Native Americans, which was Hergé&#x27;s primary desire. As a result, Tintin&#x27;s encounter with the natives took up only a sixth of the narrative. Hergé sought to demystify the &quot;cruel savage&quot; stereotype of the Natives that had been widely perpetuated in western films. His depiction of the Natives was broadly sympathetic, yet he also depicted them as gullible and naïve, much as he had depicted the Congolese in the previous &quot;Adventure&quot;.

===Research===
Hergé attempted greater research into the United States than he had done for the Belgian Congo or Soviet Union. To learn more about Native Americans, Hergé read Paul Coze and René Thévenin&#x27;s 1928 book (&quot;Customs and History of the Redskin Indians&quot;) and visited Brussels&#x27; ethnographic museum. As a result, his depiction of the Blackfoot Native Americans was &quot;essentially accurate&quot;, with artefacts such as tipis and traditional costume copied from photographs. Although Hergé&#x27;s depiction of the Native Americans wearing war bonnets could be considered stereotypical, the Blackfeet were one of the few tribes who actually did wear these.

To learn about Chicago and its gangsters, he read Georges Duhamel&#x27;s 1930 book (&quot;Scenes from Future Life&quot;). Written in the context of the Wall Street crash of 1929, Duhamel&#x27;s work contained strong anti-consumerist and anti-modernist sentiment, criticising the U.S.&#x27;s increased mechanisation and standardisation from a background of European conservatism; this would have resonated with both Wallez and Hergé&#x27;s viewpoints. Many elements of &quot;Tintin in America&quot;, such as the abattoir scene, were adopted from Duhamel&#x27;s descriptions.

Hergé was also influenced by a special edition of radical anti-conformist magazine (&quot;The Mortar Shell&quot;) that was published in October 1930. Devoted to the United States, it contained a variety of photographs that influenced his depiction of the country. Hergé used its images of skyscrapers as a basis for his depiction of Chicago and adopted its account of Native Americans being evicted from their land when oil was discovered there. He was particularly interested in the articles in the magazine written by a reporter Claude Blanchard, who had recently traveled the U.S. He reported on the situation in Chicago and New York City and met with Native Americans in New Mexico. Blanchard&#x27;s article discussed the gangster George Moran, whom literary critic Jean-Marie Apostolidès believed provided the basis for the character Bobby Smiles.

Hergé&#x27;s depiction of the country was also influenced by American cinema, and many of his illustrations were based on cinematic imagery. Jean-Marc Lofficier and Randy Lofficier thought that Tintin&#x27;s arrest of Smiles had been influenced by the &quot;Buffalo Bill&quot; stories, and that the idea of the gangsters taking Tintin away in their car came from &quot;Little Caesar&quot;. Despite his extensive research into American life, Hergé accidentally drew steering wheels on the right side of cars in some panels of the comic. It has been suggested that strongman Arthur Saxon, who died a decade prior to serialization of &quot;Tintin in America&quot;, may have influenced the character Billy Bolivar.

One of the individuals that Hergé could have learned about through Blanchard&#x27;s article was the Chicago-based American gangster Al Capone. In the preceding story, &quot;Tintin in the Congo&quot;, Capone had been introduced as a character within the series. There, he was responsible for running a diamond smuggling racket that Tintin exposed, setting up for further confrontation in &quot;Tintin in America&quot;. Capone was one of only two real-life individuals to be named in &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, and was the only real-life figure to appear as a character in the series. In the original version, Hergé avoided depicting him directly, either illustrating the back of his head or hiding his face behind a scarf; this was altered in the second version, in which Capone&#x27;s face was depicted. It is not known if Capone ever learned about his inclusion in the story, although during initial serialisation he would have been preoccupied with his trial and ensuing imprisonment.

===Original publication, 1931–32===
&quot;Tintin in America&quot; began serialization in on 3 September 1931, under the title of (&quot;The Adventures of Tintin, Reporter, in Chicago&quot;). The use of &quot;Chicago&quot; over &quot;America&quot; reflected Wallez&#x27;s desire for the story to focus on a critique of American capitalism and crime, for which the city was internationally renowned. Partway through serialisation, as Tintin left Chicago and headed west, Hergé changed the title of the serial to (&quot;The Adventures of Tintin, Reporter, in America&quot;). The dog Snowy was given a diminished role in &quot;Tintin in America&quot;, which contained the last instance in the &quot;Adventures&quot; in which Tintin and Snowy have a conversation where they can understand each other. In the banquet scene, a reference is made to a famous actress named Mary Pikefort, an allusion to the real-life actress Mary Pickford. That same scene also featured a prototype for the character of Rastapopoulos, who was properly introduced in the following &quot;Cigars of the Pharaoh&quot; story.
The strip&#x27;s serialization coincided with the publication of another of Hergé&#x27;s comics set in the United States: (&quot;The Adventures of Tim the Squirrel Out West&quot;), published in sixteen installments by the Brussels department store L&#x27;Innovation. Produced every Thursday, the series was reminiscent of Hergé&#x27;s earlier &quot;Totor&quot; series. Alongside these stories, Hergé was involved in producing his weekly &quot;Quick and Flupke&quot; comic strip and drawing front covers for , as well as providing illustrations for another of supplements, , and undertaking freelance work designing advertisements. In September 1931, partway through the story&#x27;s serialization, Hergé took a brief holiday in Spain with two friends, and in May 1932 was recalled to military service for two weeks. On 20 July &#x27;32, Hergé married Germaine Kieckens, who was Wallez&#x27;s secretary. Although neither of them was entirely happy with the union, they had been encouraged to do so by Wallez, who demanded that all his staff marry and who personally carried out the wedding ceremony. After a honeymoon in Vianden, Luxembourg, the couple moved into an apartment in the rue Knapen, Schaerbeek.

As he had done with the prior two &quot;Adventures&quot;, Wallez organized a publicity stunt to mark the culmination of &quot;Tintin in America&quot;, in which an actor portraying Tintin arrived in Brussels; it proved the most popular yet. In 1932, the series was collected and published in a single volume by , coinciding with their publication of the first collected volume of . A second edition was produced in France by in 1934, while that same year Casterman published an edition, the first of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; that they released. In 1936, Casterman asked Hergé to add several new color plates to a reprint of &quot;Tintin in America&quot;, which he agreed to. They also asked him to replace the cover with one depicting a car chase, but he refused.

===Second version, 1945===
In the 1940s, when Hergé&#x27;s popularity had increased, he redrew many of the original black-and-white Tintin adventures in color using the (&quot;clear line&quot;) drawing style he had developed, so that they visually fitted in with the newer Tintin stories. &quot;Tintin in America&quot; was reformatted and colored in 1945 and saw publication in 1946.

Various changes were made in the second edition. Some of the social commentaries regarding the poor treatment of Native Americans by the government were toned down. The name of the Native tribe was changed from the (&quot;Tied Toes&quot;) to the (&quot;Black Feet&quot;). Perhaps because Al Capone&#x27;s power had diminished in the intervening years, Hergé depicted Capone&#x27;s scarred face in the 1945 version. He removed the reference to Mary Pickford from the ceremonial dinner scene and deleted two Chinese hoodlums who tried to eat Snowy. References to Belgium was also removed, allowing the story to have a greater international appeal.

===Later alterations and releases===
When the second version of the story was translated into English by Michael Turner and Leslie Lonsdale-Cooper, they made several alterations to the text. For instance, Monsieur Tom Hawke, whose name was a pun on tomahawk, was renamed Mr. Maurice Oyle, and the Swift factory was renamed Grynd Corp. Other changes were made to render the story more culturally understandable to an Anglophone readership; whereas the factory originally sold its mix of dogs, cats, and rats as hare pâté—a food uncommon in Britain—the English translation rendered the mix as salami. In another instance, garlic, pepper, and salt were added to the mixture in the French version, but this was changed to mustard, pepper, and salt for the English version, again reflecting British culinary tastes.

In 1957, Hergé considered sending Tintin back to North America for another adventure featuring the indigenous people. He decided against it, instead of producing &quot;Tintin in Tibet&quot;. Although &quot;Tintin in America&quot; and much of Hergé&#x27;s earlier work displayed anti-American sentiment, he later grew more favourable to American culture, befriending one of the country&#x27;s most prominent artists, Andy Warhol. Hergé himself would first visit the United States in 1971, accompanied by his second wife Fanny Rodwell, and meet Edgar Red Cloud, the great-grandson of the warrior chief Red Cloud. With a letter of recommendation from his friend Father Gall, he was invited to indulge his childhood desire to meet with real &quot;Red Indians&quot;—members of the Oglala Lakota on their Pine Ridge reservation in South Dakota—and take part in a pow wow.

American publishers of &quot;Tintin in America&quot; were uneasy regarding the scene in which the Blackfoot Natives are forcibly removed from their land. Hergé nevertheless refused to remove it. For the 1973 edition published in the U.S., the publishers made Hergé remove African-American characters from the book, and redraw them as Whites or Hispanics because they did not want to encourage racial integration among children. That same year, the original black-and-white version was republished in a French-language collected volume with &quot;Tintin in the Land of the Soviets&quot; and &quot;Tintin in the Congo&quot;, the first part of the collection. In 1983, a facsimile of the original was published by Casterman.

In 2020, Editions Moulinsart published a newly colorized version of the original 1932 B&amp;W version of &quot;Tintin in America&quot;, with all-new English translation by Michael Farr.

==Critical analysis==

Jean-Marc Lofficier and Randy Lofficier opined that Hergé had made &quot;another leap forward&quot; with &quot;Tintin in America&quot;, noting that while it still &quot;rambles on&quot;, it is &quot;more tightly plotted&quot; than its predecessors. They believed that the illustrations showed &quot;marked progress&quot; and that for the first time, several of the frames could be seen as &quot;individual pieces of art&quot;. Believing that it was the first work with the &quot;intangible epic quality&quot; they thought characterized &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, they awarded it two out of five stars. They considered Bobby Smiles to be &quot;the first great villain&quot; of the series, and also thought that Mike MacAdam, the incompetent hotel detective featured in the comic, was a precursor to Thomson and Thompson, while another character, the drunken sheriff, anticipated Captain Haddock. The Lofficiers believed that Hergé had successfully synthesized all of the &quot;classic American myths&quot; into a single narrative that &quot;withstands comparison with the vision of America&quot; presented in Gustave Le Rouge and Gustave Guitton&#x27;s (&quot;The Billionaires&#x27; Conspiracy&quot;). They thought that Hergé&#x27;s depiction of the exploitation of Native Americans was an &quot;astonishing piece of the narrative&quot;.

Harry Thompson considered the story to be &quot;little more than a tourist ramble&quot; across the U.S., describing it as only &quot;marginally more sophisticated&quot; than its predecessors. He nevertheless thought that it contained many indicators of &quot;greater things&quot;, remarking that Hergé&#x27;s sympathy for the Natives was &quot;a revolutionary attitude&quot; for 1931. Thompson also opined that the book&#x27;s &quot;highlight&quot; was on page 29 of the 1945 version, in which oil is discovered on Native land, following which they are cleared off by the U.S. Army, and a complete city is constructed on the site within 24 hours. Biographer Benoît Peeters praised the strip&#x27;s illustrations, feeling that they exhibited &quot;a quality of lightness&quot; and showed that Hergé was fascinated by the United States despite the anti-Americanism of his milieu. He nevertheless considered it &quot;in the same mode&quot; as the earlier &quot;Adventures&quot;, calling it &quot;a collection of clichés and snapshots of well-known places&quot;. Elsewhere, Peeters commented that throughout the story, Tintin rushes around the country seeing as much as possible, likening him to the stereotypical American tourist.

Hergé biographer Pierre Assouline believed &quot;Tintin in America&quot; to be &quot;more developed and detailed&quot; than the prior &quot;Adventures&quot;, representing the cartoonist&#x27;s &quot;greatest success&quot; in a &quot;long time&quot;. Opining that the illustrations were &quot;superior&quot; due to Hergé&#x27;s accumulated experience, he nevertheless criticized instances where the story exhibited directional problems; for instance, in one scene, Tintin enters the tunnel, but Assouline notes that while he is supposed to be traveling downward, he is instead depicted climbing upstairs. Such directional problems were also criticized by Michael Farr, who nevertheless thought the story &quot;action-packed&quot;, with a more developed sense of satire and therefore greater depth than &quot;Soviets&quot; or &quot;Congo&quot;. He considered the depiction of Tintin climbing along the ledge of the skyscraper on page 10 to be &quot;one of the most remarkable&quot; illustrations in the entire series, inducing a sense of vertigo in the reader. He also opined that the depiction of the Blackfoot Natives being forced from their land was the &quot;strongest political statement&quot; in the series, illustrating that Hergé had &quot;an acute political conscience&quot; and was not the advocate of racial superiority that he has been accused of being. Comparing the 1932 and 1945 versions of the comic, Farr believed that the latter was technically superior, but had lost the &quot;freshness&quot; of the original.

Literary critic Jean-Marie Apostolidès of Stanford University thought that in &quot;Tintin in America&quot;, Hergé had intentionally depicted the wealthy industrialists as being very similar to the gangsters. He noted that this negative portrayal of capitalists continued into later &quot;Adventures of Tintin&quot; with characters such as Basil Bazarov in &quot;The Broken Ear&quot;. He considered this indicative of &quot;a more ambivalent stance&quot; to the right-wing agenda that Hergé had formerly adhered to. Another literary critic, Tom McCarthy, concurred, believing that &quot;Tintin in America&quot; exhibited Hergé&#x27;s &quot;left-wing counter tendency&quot; through attacking the racism and capitalist mass production of the U.S. McCarthy believed that the work exposed social and political process as a &quot;mere charade&quot;, much as Hergé had previously done in &quot;Tintin in the Land of the Soviets&quot;. Years later, while brainstorming what ultimately became &quot;Tintin in Tibet&quot;, Hergé considered bringing Tintin back to the United States to aid a group of Native Americans in defending themselves from a large corporation willing to drill their land for oil, but Hergé felt in reflection that retracing old ground would be a step backwards and discarded the idea.

==Adaptations==
&quot;Tintin in America&quot; was adapted into a 1991 episode of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; television series by French studio Ellipse and Canadian animation company Nelvana. Directed by Stéphane Bernasconi, the character of Tintin was voiced by Thierry Wermuth in French and by Colin O&#x27;Meara in English. Besides being aired as the last episode of the series (despite being the earliest book adapted), it is also the most altered episode, amounting to almost a completely new story. For example, the involvement of the Native Americans has been removed, giving the gangster element the main focus. Bobby Smiles, who was the head of a rival gang to Al Capone as depicted in the book, became a henchman of the latter (which is unnamed) as depicted in the series. The ending of the story also rewritten; in the book, Tintin returns safely to Europe, however, in the televised episode, he receives a phone call about the unknown situation and leaves his hotel room to solve it.

In 2002, French artist Jochen Gerner published a socio-political satire based on &quot;Tintin in America&quot; titled . It consisted of a replica of Hergé&#x27;s book with most of the images blocked out with black ink; the only images left visible are those depicting violence, commerce, or divinity. When interviewed as to this project, Gerner stated that his pervasive use of black was a reference to &quot;the censure, to the night, the obscurity (the evil), the mystery of things not entirely revealed&quot;.

<text>&quot;Complexity, Problem Solving, and Sustainable Societies&quot; is a paper on energy economics by Joseph Tainter from 1996.

== Focus ==
It focuses on the energy cost of problem solving, and the energy-complexity relation in manmade systems. This is a mirror of the negentropic tendencies of natural evolution, according to ecological economics, notably the arguments of Donella Meadows and her colleagues on the economic constraints of contemporary problem solving.

&quot;The Limits to Growth&quot;, 1972, argued that &quot;to raise world food production from 1951-1966 by 34%, for example, required increasing expenditures on tractors of 63%, on nitrate fertilizers of 146%, and on pesticides of 300%. To remove all organic wastes from a sugar-processing plant costs 100 times more than removing 30%. To reduce sulfur dioxide in the air of a U.S. city by 9.6 times, or particulates by 3.1 times, raises the cost of pollution control by 520 times.&quot; All environmental problem solving will face constraints of this kind, Tainter argues. It is not a question of expending a lot of energy to discover &quot;more efficient&quot; ways to do these things - that process amplifies the decline.

=== Attempts ===
Attempts to impose the &quot;most efficient&quot; means have other problems. In &quot;The Rise and Decline of Nations&quot;, Mancur Olson argues that &quot;bureaucratic regulation itself generates further complexity and costs. As regulations are issued and taxes established, those who are regulated or taxed seek loopholes and lawmakers strive to close these. A competitive spiral of loophole discovery and closure unfolds, with complexity continuously increasing.&quot;

&quot;In these days when the cost of government lacks political support,&quot; Tainter argues, &quot;such a strategy is unsustainable. It is often suggested that environmentally benign behavior should be elicited through taxation incentives rather than through regulations. While this approach has some advantages, it does not address the problem of complexity, and may not reduce overall regulatory costs as much as is thought. Those costs may only be shifted to the taxation authorities, and to the society as a whole.

It is not that research, education, regulation, and new technologies cannot potentially alleviate our problems. With enough investment perhaps they can. The difficulty is that these investments will be costly, and may require an increasing share of each nation&#x27;s gross domestic product. With diminishing returns to problem solving, addressing environmental issues in our conventional way means that more resources will have to be allocated to science, engineering, and government. In the absence of high economic growth this would require at least a temporary decline in the standard of living, as people would have comparatively less to spend on food, housing, clothing, medical care, transportation, and entertainment.&quot;

&quot;To circumvent costliness in problem solving it is often suggested that we use resources more intelligently and efficiently,&quot; Tainter continues, but cites Timothy F. H. Allen and Thomas Hoekstra, 1992, as claiming that &quot;in managing ecosystems for sustainability, managers should identify what is missing from natural regulatory process and provide only that. The ecosystem will do the rest. Let the ecosystem (i.e., solar energy) subsidize the management effort rather than the other way around.&quot; This was later to be a cornerstone of the economic strategy of natural capitalism.

=== Requirement of knowledge ===
Tainter argues that this would &quot;require much knowledge that we do not now possess. That means we need research that is complex and costly, and requires fossil fuel subsidies. Lowering the costs of complexity in one sphere causes them to rise in another.&quot;

&quot;Industrialism illustrates this point. It generated its own problems of complexity and costliness. These included railways and canals to distribute coal and manufactured goods, the development of an economy increasingly based on money and wages, and the development of new technologies. While such elements of complexity are usually thought to facilitate economic growth, in fact &quot;they can do so only when subsidized by energy.&quot;&quot; (italics ours).

This is the central argument Tainter makes: the energy economy always subsidizes the product economy and service economy, and any intermediates such as commodity markets. Without looking at energy costs at every trophic level, and the transfer between, which appears to be &quot;decreasing&quot; as more technology is applied, there is simply no way to discover what is and is not &quot;efficient&quot;.

&quot;With subsidies of inexpensive fossil fuels, for a long time many consequences of industrialism effectively did not matter. Industrial societies could afford them. When energy costs are met easily and painlessly, benefit/cost ratio to social investments can be substantially ignored (as it has been in contemporary industrial agriculture). Fossil fuels made industrialism, and all that flowed from it (such as science, transportation, medicine, employment, consumerism,
high-technology war, and contemporary political organization), a system of problem solving that was sustainable for several generations.&quot;

&quot;Energy has always been the basis of cultural complexity and it always will be.&quot;

Tainter concludes that considerable hardship will be required to adjust to an economy that is (a) smaller (b) reliant more on individuals to carry out their own primary production, say in gardens and farms (c) not investing in problem solving to a greater extent than is warranted by the actual savings in energy that result out the other end.

<text>Chai Ling (; born April 15, 1966) is a Chinese psychologist who was one of the student leaders in the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. According in the documentary Gate of Heavenly Peace, she had indicated that the strategy of the leadership group she dominated was to provoke the Government to use violence against the unarmed students. She had also claimed to have witnessed soldiers killing student protesters inside Tiananmen Square.

She is the founder of All Girls Allowed, an organization dedicated to ending China&#x27;s one-child policy, and the founder and president of Jenzabar, an enterprise resource planning software firm for educational institutions.

She has made a number of controversial remarks regarding her role in the 1989 protests that were recorded in an interview with Phillip Cunningham in the documentary &quot;The Gate of Heavenly Peace&quot;, which have since been the subject of various legal and personal disputes.

==Life in China==
Chai was born on April 15, 1966, in Rizhao, Shandong. Both Chai&#x27;s mother and father had been doctors in the People&#x27;s Liberation Army during the 1950s. Chai is the eldest of four children. In 1983, Chai Ling began her education at Peking University where she eventually earned a B.A. in psychology.

Chai met her future husband, Feng Congde, in January 1987. She became aware of Feng after his arrest on January 1, 1987 for his participation in a democracy demonstration, and met him a few days later on her way to the university library. Chai and Feng were married in the spring of 1988, though they were forced to alter their identification because they failed to meet the age requirements to be legally married. After their wedding, Chai was accepted as a graduate student at the Child Psychology Institute of Beijing Normal University. Chai and Feng became increasingly distant over the course of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, and their marriage ended in divorce soon after the movement ended.

==Protest and exile==

Chai first became involved in the 1989 Tiananmen Square Protests through her work as a secretary for the Peking University Preparatory Committee, which had elected Chai&#x27;s husband Feng into a leadership position. She rose to prominence as a student leader as a result of her involvement in the student hunger strike. Chai has stated that the idea for the hunger strike was given to her by Zhang Boli, another Beijing University student, but has also claimed that a member of the national security force informed her that a hunger strike would elicit a reaction from the government. On May 12, fellow demonstrator Wang Dan approached Chai and informed her that he planned to join the hunger strike, which at the time consisted of only forty members. Chai agreed to join as well, and that evening delivered a speech to the demonstrators that generated a large amount of support for the hunger strike movement, and enabled Chai to gather support from the student demonstrators and endorsement from the Beijing Students&#x27; Autonomous Federation.

The growth of the hunger strike allowed Chai&#x27;s influence over the student movement to grow. On May 13, she participated in a student dialogue with the government that was led by Yan Mingfu. Two days later, Chai was elected to serve as commander in chief of the Hunger Strike Committee, one of several student demonstration organizations in Tiananmen Square. On May 19, Chai announced the end of the hunger strike, a decision that was met with criticism from Feng Congde, Wang Wen, and groups of angry demonstrators. Chai and most other major hunger strike leaders went into hiding on May 21 in response to rumors of government troops invading the square that evening, but returned to the square the following day after hearing that no attack had occurred during the night. The retreat of the hunger strike leaders caused a power vacuum that was filled by the Beijing Students Autonomous Union, as well as new organizations which had been created. On May 23, the students of the square voted to transfer leadership from the Beijing Student&#x27;s Federation to a temporary organization called the Defend Tiananmen Square Headquarters, which selected Chai Ling as its leader and made permanent the following day. During a May 27 meeting with other student leaders, Chai Ling and Feng Congde voted in favour of evacuating the square on May 30. At the press conference that same evening, however, Chai and Feng changed their positions and instead supported the continued occupation of the square. Chai claimed that the meeting had been part of plot to remove the students from the square and defended her change of opinion by stating that she had been pressured into voting to leave. Chai resigned from her role as commander in chief of Defend Tiananmen Square Headquarters on May 29, though she later resumed her position.

Like many of the student leaders during the demonstrations, Chai Ling was also a participant in some of the internal conflicts within the student movement. Chai was highly critical of the Beijing Students&#x27; Autonomous Union. In response to losing control of the square while in hiding on the May 21, Chai criticized the rival leadership group of lacking &quot;leadership quality,&quot; opposing the hunger strike and accomplishing nothing positive for the student movement. In an essay given to reporters in late May, Chai reiterated her role as &quot;chief commander&quot; of the square, while also stating that she refused to make compromises with the Autonomous Student Union of Non-Beijing Universities and other student factions. In this same essay, Chai accused Liu Xiaobo and others of using the student movement as a way to &quot;rebuild their own images,&quot; criticized many participants in the movement for lacking belief, and stated that China&#x27;s intellectuals and theorists were &quot;lagging far behind&quot; in their understanding of democracy. Chai was also an adamant supporter of the purity of the student movement and resisted both the participation of non-student protesters, and involvement in the political struggle between government reformers and hardliners. Unlike more moderate leaders within the movement, Chai Ling seemed willing to allow for the movement to end in a violent confrontation. In an interview given in late May, Chai suggested that only when the movement ended in bloodshed would the majority of Chinese realize the importance of the student movement and unite, though she felt that she was unable to share this idea with her fellow students. Chai has since claimed that these remarks were taken out of context and selectively edited. She has also claimed that her expectation of violent crackdown was something she had heard from Li Lu and not an idea of her own.

When the violent government crackdown ended the demonstrations on the night of June 3, Feng and Chai escaped Beijing by train. The couple spent the next ten months in hiding, where they were aided by a network of organizations which aimed to help student dissidents. On June 8, Chai recorded a speech while she was in hiding at the Wuhan University which stated that she was alive and provided her account of the events of June 3 crackdown. In this recording, Chai stated that she witnessed at least twenty students and workers being massacred in the square, though she was unable to confirm the estimates of other witnesses. However declassified US embassy cables published on Wikileaks, contradicted this and concluded that the students were allowed to leave peacefully without bloodshed when soldiers had arrived to clear the square. Chai was not alone in reporting seeing a massacre in the square. Wu&#x27;er Kaixi claimed to witness two hundred students massacred in spite of the fact that he had left hours before the military arrived at the square. Li Lu also stated that he witnessed tanks drive over tents full of sleeping protesters, killing hundreds of unarmed students. However, Hou Dejian claimed that despite being present until 6:30am on June 4, he did not witness anyone being killed in the square itself. On June 13, the Public Security Ministry issued an arrest warrant which listed the names of twenty-one student demonstrators in order of importance. Chai Ling&#x27;s name was fourth on the list, behind Wang Dan, Wu&#x27;er Kaixi and Liu Gang. Eventually Chai and Feng were smuggled out of mainland China and into Hong Kong via Operation Yellowbird. At the University of Hong Kong, Feng and Chai were put in contact with an underground rescue network that orchestrated their escape to France.

==Post-Tiananmen==
While in hiding, Chai was nominated by two Norwegian legislators for the 1990 Nobel Peace Prize. As a result of her role in the student demonstrations, Chai also received an invitation to attend Princeton University through the China Initiative Program, an organization which aimed to provide educational scholarships for student refugees. While at Princeton, Chai studied politics and international relations at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs.

After graduating from Princeton in 1993, Chai began working at the consulting firm Bain &amp; Company. While working at Bain &amp; Company, Chai began dating her current husband, Robert A. Maginn Jr., a partner at the firm. The couple married in 2001 and currently reside in the United States, where they have three daughters.

In 1998 Chai earned her M.B.A. from Harvard and founded an Internet company called Jenzabar. Jenzabar provides ERP software to universities across the United States of America. She has been President since founding Jenzabar and Chief Operating Officer since 2001.

In 2009, Chai converted to Christianity. In June 2010, Chai Ling started a nonprofit called &quot;All Girls Allowed&quot; with the aim of stopping the human rights violations related to the One-Child Policy.

Though Chai Ling was reportedly working on an autobiography as early as 1991, her autobiography, &quot;A Heart for Freedom: The Remarkable Journey of a Young Dissident, her Daring Escape, and her Quest to Free China&#x27;s Daughter&quot;s, was not published until 2011.

Chai has been called to testify before the United States Congress 8 times, most recently on June 3, 2013. Her testimony has mainly related to Human Rights Issues in China.

===The Gate of Heavenly Peace documentary===
Footage from a documentary titled &quot;The Gate of Heavenly Peace&quot; shows viewers parts of an interview between Chai and reporter Philip Cunningham from May 28, 1989, a week prior to the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre. In the footage, Chai makes the following statements:

The footage has been verified by third-party media specialists as genuine, and is readily available online. Chai, however, claims that she had been misquoted and that the footage used &quot;interpretive and erroneous translation&quot;. Declassified US embassy cables published on Wikileaks contradicted her later witness testimonial of experiencing a massacre in the square.

According to Keith Schoppa, Ling&#x27;s comments showed the &quot;depth of her revolutionary feelings&quot; and that the film itself featured &quot;much of the criticism of Chai Ling&#x27;s zealotry.&quot; In June 1995, Chai attacked the film in the journal Tiananmen where she argued the film&#x27;s producer made the film for &quot;crude commercial gain by taking things out of context.&quot;

Chai and her firm have launched multiple lawsuits against the film&#x27;s non-profit producers, the Long Bow Group. An initial suit, in which Chai alleged defamation, was summarily dismissed. An additional suit claimed that the organization infringed upon Jenzabar&#x27;s trademark by mentioning the firm&#x27;s name in the keyword meta tags and title tag for a page about Jenzabar on its website. Her lawsuits were subsequently criticized by some commentators, including columnists for the &quot;Boston Globe&quot; and &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. In the end, each of her legal actions against the film were dismissed by the Massachusetts appeals court. In its ruling the Superior Court handed an award to defendants of more than $500,000 in attorney fees and expenses, stating that Jenzabar &quot;subjected Long Bow to protracted and costly litigation not to protect the goodwill of its trademark from misappropriation, but to suppress criticism of Jenzabar&#x27;s principles and its corporate practices.&quot; in the ruling.

===Religious discrimination lawsuit against Jenzabar, All Girls Allowed and Chai Ling===
Jing Zhang, a Chinese feminist activist, sued Jenzabar Inc., The Jenzabar Foundation, All Girls Allowed and their founder and Jing&#x27;s former employer, Chai Ling. Zhang had established her own nonprofit, Women&#x27;s Rights in China, when she joined forces with Chai to develop programs to prevent forced abortions in China. Then, she alleges, Chai fired her for being insufficiently religious and for declining to engage in &quot;weekly corporate worship.&quot;

<doc id="319820" wikidata="Q93604" url="?curid=319820" title="Lotte Lenya">
<text>Lotte Lenya (born Karoline Wilhelmine Charlotte Blamauer; 18 October 1898 – 27 November 1981) was an Austrian-American singer, diseuse, and actress, long based in the United States. In the German-speaking and classical music world, she is best remembered for her performances of the songs of her first husband, Kurt Weill. In English-language cinema, she was nominated for an Academy Award for her role as a jaded aristocrat in &quot;The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone&quot; (1961). She also played the murderous and sadistic Rosa Klebb in the James Bond movie &quot;From Russia with Love&quot; (1963).

==Early career==
In 1922, Lenya was seen by her future husband, German-Jewish composer Kurt Weill, during an audition for his first stage score &quot;Zaubernacht&quot;, but because of his position behind the piano, she did not see him. She was cast, but owing to her loyalty to her voice coach, she declined the role. She accepted the part of Jenny in the first performance of &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot; (&quot;Die Dreigroschenoper&quot;) in 1928, and the part became her breakthrough role. During the last years of the Weimar Republic, she was busy in film and theatre, and especially in Brecht-Weill plays. She made several recordings of Weill&#x27;s songs. 

With the rise of Nazism in Germany, many artists were not appreciated, and although not Jewish, she left the country, having become estranged from Weill. (They would later divorce and remarry.) In March 1933, she moved to Paris, where she sang the leading part in Brecht-Weill&#x27;s &quot;sung ballet&quot;, &quot;The Seven Deadly Sins&quot;.

Lenya and Weill settled in New York City on 10 September 1935. During the summer of 1936, Weill, Lenya, Paul Green, and Cheryl Crawford rented a house at 277 Trumbull Avenue in Nichols, Connecticut, about 2 miles (3.2 km) from Pine Brook Country Club, the summer rehearsal headquarters of the Group Theatre. Here, Green and Weill wrote the script and music for the controversial Broadway play &quot;Johnny Johnson&quot;, which was titled after the most frequently occurring name on the American casualty list of World War I. During this period, Lenya had a love affair with playwright Paul Green.

During World War II, Lenya did a number of stage performances, recordings, and radio performances, including for the Voice of America. After a badly received part in her husband&#x27;s musical &quot;The Firebrand of Florence&quot; in 1945 in New York, she withdrew from the stage. After Weill&#x27;s death in 1950, she was coaxed back to the stage. She appeared on Broadway in &quot;Barefoot in Athens&quot; and married editor George Davis.

==Late career==
In 1956, she won a Tony Award for her role as Jenny in Marc Blitzstein&#x27;s English version of &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot;, the only time an off-Broadway performance has been so honored. Lenya went on to record a number of songs from her time in Berlin, as well as songs from the American stage. Her voice had deepened with age. When she was to sing the soprano parts in &quot;Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny&quot; and &quot;The Seven Deadly Sins&quot;, the music needed transposition to substantially lower keys.

&quot;Sprechstimme&quot; was used in some famous songs in the Brecht-Weill plays, but now Lenya used it even more to compensate for the shortcomings of her voice. Lenya was aware of this as a problem; in other contexts, she was very careful about fully respecting her late husband&#x27;s score.

She founded the Kurt Weill Foundation for Music, to administer incomes and issues regarding rights, and to spread knowledge about Weill&#x27;s work. She was present in the studio when Louis Armstrong recorded Brecht-Weill&#x27;s &quot;Mack the Knife&quot;. Armstrong improvised the line &quot;Look out for Miss Lotte Lenya!&quot; and added her name to the list of Mack&#x27;s female conquests in the song.

She narrated &quot;George Grosz&#x27; Interregnum&quot;, a film about the artist George Grosz that was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Short in 1960.

Her role as Vivien Leigh&#x27;s earthy friend Contessa Magda Terribili-Gonzales in the screen version of Tennessee Williams&#x27; &quot;The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone&quot; (1961) brought Lenya Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations as Best Supporting Actress. In 1963, she was cast as the SMERSH agent Rosa Klebb in the James Bond movie &quot;From Russia with Love&quot; starring Sean Connery and Robert Shaw.

In 1966, Lenya originated the role of &quot;Fräulein&quot; Schneider in the original Broadway cast of the musical &quot;Cabaret&quot;. Kander and Ebb&#x27;s score was considered by some to be inspired by Weill&#x27;s music. In 1979, two years before her death, Lotte Lenya was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame.

==Personal life==
Lenya was born to Catholic working-class parents in Vienna. She went to Zürich to study in 1914, taking her first job at the Schauspielhaus, using the stage name Lotte Lenja. She moved to Berlin to seek work in 1921.

Lenya and Weill did not meet properly until 1924 through a mutual acquaintance, the writer Georg Kaiser. They married in 1926, and later divorced in 1933, only to reconcile in September 1935 after emigrating to the United States. They remarried in 1937. During and between their marriages, she had numerous lovers, including Max Ernst, Paul Green, and Tilly Losch. In 1941, the couple moved to a house of their own in New City, New York, roughly 50 km north of New York City. Their second marriage lasted until Weill&#x27;s death in 1950.

Lenya&#x27;s second husband (1951–57) was American editor George Davis, who was homosexual. After Davis&#x27; death in 1957, she married artist Russell Detwiler in 1962, who was homosexual as well. He was 26 years her junior and a heavy alcoholic, but she was widowed for a third time when Detwiler died at the age of 44 in 1969 as the result of a fall from an alcoholic seizure. He was interred on their seventh wedding anniversary. On June 9, 1971, she married critic and TV producer Richard Siemanowski, but separated from him only two years later, never having lived with him.

==Death==
Lenya died in Manhattan of cancer in 1981, aged 83. She is buried next to Weill at Mount Repose Cemetery in Haverstraw, New York.

==Legacy==
In 1956, Louis Armstrong recorded the song &quot;Mack the Knife&quot;, both as a solo number and as a duet with Lenya. Armstrong added Lenya&#x27;s name into the lyrics, in place of one of the characters in the play. Bobby Darin&#x27;s 1959 hit recording of the song used these updated lyrics mentioning Lenya.

Donovan&#x27;s 1968 song &quot;Laléna&quot; was inspired by Lenya.

The Michael Kunze play &quot;Lenya&quot; is about Brecht&#x27;s favorite singer, Lotte Lenya.

In 2007, the musical &quot;LoveMusik&quot;, based on Lenya&#x27;s relationship with Weill, opened on Broadway. Lenya was portrayed by Donna Murphy.

She is mentioned in the Fascinating Aïda song &quot;Lieder&quot;, which originally described her as German, but was corrected for later performances. She is referenced in the Gavin Friday song &quot;Dolls&quot; from his 1995 album &quot;Shag Tobacco&quot;.

The Lotte Lenya Competition recognizes young singers and actors who are dramatically and musically convincing in repertoire ranging from opera and operetta to contemporary Broadway scores, with a focus on the works of Kurt Weill.

<text>The  (; also known as ENS de Lyon, ENSL or Normale Sup&#x27; Lyon) is a French grande école located in the city of Lyon. It is one of the four prestigious écoles normales supérieures in France. The school is composed of two academic units —Arts and Sciences— with campuses in Lyon, near the confluence of the Rhône and Saône rivers.

ENSL&#x27;s students usually enjoy a special civil servant status in the wake of highly competitive exams, providing they pursue careers in public service. Although it maintains extensive connections with the University of Lyon and external research institutions, including the CNRS, the school remains independent.

==History==

===Training teachers for normal schools===

&quot;L&#x27;École normale supérieure de Lyon&quot; is the descendant of two top educational institutions founded by Jules Ferry:
*&quot;L&#x27;École normale supérieure de Fontenay-aux-Roses&quot;, for girls, founded in 1880.
*&quot;L&#x27;École normale supérieure de Saint-Cloud&quot;, for boys, founded in 1882.
Recruiting among the most brilliant French students, these two schools used to train the professors of the French normal schools. Whereas these schools were largely regarded as meritocratic, their sisters – the eldest, &quot;l&#x27;École Normale Supérieure de la Rue d&#x27;Ulm&quot;, and her feminine counterpart, &quot;l&#x27;École normale supérieure de jeunes filles de Sèvres&quot; -, which trained academics, were &quot;de facto&quot; dedicated to the heirs of the Parisian elites.

===A shift towards secondary and higher education===

Following a reform of normal schools, the decree of February 19, 1945 granted both institutions the title of &quot;Écoles normales préparatoires à l&#x27;enseignement secondaire&quot;. The schools&#x27; purpose changed with the growth of the French education system. By 1956, the length of studies was increased to four years in order to institute a preparation for the &quot;agrégation&quot; – a prestigious teaching qualification. Increasingly opening up to research, they aligned their development strategies with those of the ENS Ulm and Sèvres.

===The relocation in Lyon===

As part of France&#x27;s process of decentralisation, the Schools&#x27; scientific departments moved in 1987 to Gerland, an old industrial district of Lyon, in the premises of the current Monod campus. The relocated institution was named &quot;ENS Lyon&quot;.
Humanities students remained in the Parisian suburbs within the coeducational &quot;École normale supérieure de Fontenay-Saint-Cloud&quot;. In 2000, this school, informally renamed École normale supérieure lettres et sciences humaines, was transferred to the new Descartes Campus also located in Gerland.

On the first of January 2010, the two branches merged to become a single institution, retaining the name &quot;École normale supérieure de Lyon&quot;.

== Academics ==
&quot;ENS de Lyon&quot; is a &quot;Grande École&quot;, a French institution of higher education that is separate from, but parallel and connected to the main framework of the French public university system. Similar to the Ivy League in the United States, Oxbridge in the UK, and C9 League in China, &quot;Grandes Écoles&quot; are elite academic institutions that admit students through an extremely competitive process. &quot;Grandes Écoles&quot; typically they have much smaller class sizes and student bodies than public universities in France, and many of their programs are taught in English. While most &quot;Grandes Écoles&quot; are more expensive than French universities, &quot;ENS de Lyon&quot; charges the same tuition fees: €243 annually for the master&#x27;s degree in 2021–2022; €184 for the Bachelor&#x27;s. International internships, study abroad opportunities, and close ties with government and the corporate world are a hallmark of the &quot;Grandes Écoles&quot;. Degrees from &quot;École normale supérieure&quot; are accredited by the &quot;Conférence des Grandes Écoles&quot; and awarded by the Ministry of National Education (France) (). Alums go on to occupy elite positions within government, administration, and corporate firms in France.

Teaching at the ENS de Lyon is organised through twelve main departments, spread over the two campuses:

===Monod Campus: Natural and Experimental Sciences Departments===

*Biology
*Chemistry
*Computer science
*Earth science
*Mathematics
*Physics

===Descartes Campus: Humanities and Social Sciences Departments===

*Arts and humanities: Musicology, Cinema and Theater studies, Classics and modern French Literature
*Economics
*Education and digital humanities
*Foreign languages, Literatures and Civilisations: Arabic, Chinese, English, German, Italian, Spanish and Russian
*Human sciences: Philosophy, Cognitive science and Anthropology
*Social sciences: Sociology, History, Geography, Political science and International studies

==Research==
23 of ENSL&#x27;s research groups have contractual ties to major research organizations, notably the CNRS and INSERM. ENSL is a member of several advanced research networks and competitive clusters, including Lyon BioPôle, and hosts an Institute for Advanced Study, the Collegium de Lyon.

===Sciences===
*Institute of Functional Genomics of Lyon (IGFL)
*Laboratory of molecular and cell biology (LBMC)
*Laboratory of plant reproduction and development (RDP)
*Laboratory of human virology (VIRO)
*Laboratory of Earth Sciences (LST)
*Joliot-Curie interdisciplinary laboratory (LJC)
*Laboratory of Pure and Applied Mathematics (UMPA)
*Laboratory of chemistry
*Computer science laboratory (LIP)
*Laboratory of physics
*Astronomy research center (CRAL)
*Center for high field Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (CRMN)

===Humanities===
*C2SO – Communication, culture and society
*Institute for the History of Classical Thought, from Humanism to the Enlightenment
*Institute of East Asian Studies (IAO) 
*Interactions, Corpuses, Learning and Representations
*Interdisciplinary approach to the logics of power in medieval Iberian societies
*Literature, Ideologies and Représentations in the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries
*Rhône-Alpes Centre for Historical Research
*Socialisation Research Group
*Triangle: Action, Discourses, Economic and Political Thought
*History and Archaeology of the Medieval Christian and Islamic Worlds
*Economic Theory and Analysis Group

==Students==
===Normaliens-élèves===

ENSL retains its close links to the classes préparatoires which prepare high-level students – previously selected on the basis of their academic record – for the competitive entrance examination that is taken after two years of pluridisciplinary undergraduate-level study.

Students who succeed in the entrance examinations, which attract some 6000 candidates for 228 positions, are known as &quot;normaliens-élèves&quot;; those who are from France or another European Union country are considered trainee public servants, and receive a salary for their studies during 4 years. A second entrance examination is also open to students who have not gone through the &quot;classes préparatoires&quot; system.

In return of their salary, they have to serve in public services for 10 years.

===Normaliens-étudiants===

Entry to ENSL is not restricted to &quot;normaliens-élèves&quot;. Students may also apply through a separate admissions process based on academic prowess. The &quot;normaliens-étudiants&quot; are not public servants, but their training and diploma are the same as those of the &quot;normaliens-élèves&quot;.

===Auditeurs de masters===

An &quot;auditeur de master&quot; is someone who has been admitted at the ENSL at the master level. By opposition to the &quot;normaliens-élèves&quot; and the &quot;normaliens-étudiants&quot;, they don&#x27;t have the title of &quot;Normalien&quot; and are just eligible to a master&#x27;s degree. They can&#x27;t obtain the ENSL diploma.

==Studies==

===First year===
Students prepare the third year of &quot;Licence&quot;, the equivalent of a UK Bachelor&#x27;s degree.
The ENS de Lyon offers numerous courses which are conceived as preparations for Masters.

===Second and third years===
Students prepare in two years their Master&#x27;s degree. 5 research Masters are proposed in Sciences, 36 in Humanities.

===Fourth year===
During this year, students can prepare the &quot;agrégation&quot; teacher recruitment examination in 16 different subjects.
Students can also start their PhD, go studying for one year or more in a foreign country, or follow during one year courses in other subjects.

===Gap years===

Between the first and fourth year, &quot;normaliens&quot; can also spend up to 2 free years called &quot;années sans solde&quot;, during which they can study other disciplines or do a long internship, sometimes in foreign countries. Each &quot;année sans solde&quot; project needs the approval of the ENSL supervisors.

===Doctoral studies===
The ENS de Lyon welcomes over 400 PhD students from all over the world. &quot;Normaliens&quot; can apply to specific doctoral contracts, as long as the thesis is undertaken within a French research institution.

==Rankings==


The 2023 QS World University Rankings ranked the ENSL 111th university in the world.

However, international rankings do not suit well the French academic system, where research organizations are often independent from universities. Moreover, the ENS are small institutions favouring education quality rather than research productivity. For instance, some French universities are better ranked than the ENS, even though the different &quot;écoles normales supérieures&quot; are considered to be among the highest French academic institutions due to their endowment, prestige and selectivity.

<doc id="319826" wikidata="Q327331" url="?curid=319826" title="Boléro">
<text>Boléro is a 1928 work for large orchestra by French composer Maurice Ravel. It is one of Ravel&#x27;s most famous compositions. It was also one of his last completed works before illness diminished his ability to write music.

==Composition==
The work&#x27;s creation was set in motion by a commission from the dancer Ida Rubinstein, who asked Ravel for an orchestral transcription of six pieces from Isaac Albéniz&#x27;s set of piano pieces, &quot;Iberia&quot;. While working on the transcription, Ravel was informed that Spanish conductor Enrique Fernández Arbós had already orchestrated the movements, and that copyright law prevented any other arrangement from being made. When Arbós heard of this, he said he would happily waive his rights and allow Ravel to orchestrate the pieces. But Ravel decided to orchestrate one of his own works instead, then changed his mind and decided to compose a completely new piece based on the &quot;bolero&quot;, a Spanish dance musical form.

While on vacation at St Jean-de-Luz, Ravel went to the piano and played a melody with one finger to his friend Gustave Samazeuilh, saying, &quot;Don&#x27;t you think this theme has an insistent quality? I&#x27;m going to try and repeat it a number of times without any development, gradually increasing the orchestra as best I can.&quot; Idries Shah wrote that the main theme is adapted from a melody composed for and used in Sufi training.

==Premiere and early performances==

The composition was a sensational success when it premiered at the Paris Opéra on 22 November 1928, with choreography by Bronislava Nijinska and designs and scenario by Alexandre Benois. The orchestra of the Opéra was conducted by Walther Straram. Originally, Ernest Ansermet had been engaged to conduct the entire ballet season, but the musicians refused to play under him. A scenario by Rubinstein and Nijinska was printed in the program for the premiere: 
Inside a tavern in Spain, people dance beneath the brass lamp hung from the ceiling. [In response] to the cheers to join in, the female dancer has leapt onto the long table and her steps become more and more animated.
 But Ravel had a different conception of the work: his preferred stage design was of an open-air setting with a factory in the background, reflecting the mechanical nature of the music.

&quot;Boléro&quot; became Ravel&#x27;s most famous composition, much to the surprise of the composer, who had predicted that most orchestras would refuse to play it. It is usually played as a purely orchestral work, only rarely staged as a ballet. According to a possibly apocryphal story from the premiere performance, a woman was heard shouting that Ravel was mad. When told about this, Ravel is said to have remarked that she had understood the piece.

The piece was first published by the Parisian firm Durand in 1929. Arrangements were made for piano solo and piano duet (two people playing at one piano), and later, Ravel arranged a version for two pianos, published in 1930.

The first recording was made by Piero Coppola for the Gramophone Company on 13 January 1930. Ravel attended the recording session. The next day, he conducted the Lamoureux Orchestra in his own recording for Polydor. That same year, further recordings were made by Serge Koussevitzky with the Boston Symphony Orchestra and Willem Mengelberg with the Concertgebouw Orchestra.

===Toscanini===
Conductor Arturo Toscanini gave the American premiere of &quot;Boléro&quot; with the New York Philharmonic on 14 November 1929. The performance was a great success, bringing &quot;shouts and cheers from the audience&quot; according to a &quot;New York Times&quot; review, leading one critic to declare that &quot;it was Toscanini who launched the career of the Boléro&quot;, and another to claim that Toscanini had made Ravel into &quot;almost an American national hero&quot;.

On 4 May 1930, Toscanini performed the work with the New York Philharmonic at the Paris Opéra as part of that orchestra&#x27;s European tour. Toscanini&#x27;s tempo was significantly faster than Ravel preferred, and Ravel signaled his disapproval by refusing to respond to Toscanini&#x27;s gesture during the audience ovation. An exchange took place between the two men backstage after the concert. According to one account, Ravel said, &quot;It&#x27;s too fast&quot;, to which Toscanini responded, &quot;You don&#x27;t know anything about your own music. It&#x27;s the only way to save the work&quot;. According to another report, Ravel said, &quot;That&#x27;s not my tempo&quot;. Toscanini replied, &quot;When I play it at your tempo, it is not effective&quot;, to which Ravel retorted, &quot;Then do not play it&quot;. Four months later, Ravel attempted to smooth over relations with Toscanini by sending him a note explaining that &quot;I have always felt that if a composer does not take part in the performance of a work, he must avoid the ovations&quot; and, ten days later, inviting Toscanini to conduct the premiere of his Piano Concerto for the Left Hand, an invitation that was declined.

===Early popularity===
The Toscanini affair became a &quot;cause célèbre&quot; and further increased the fame of &quot;Boléro&quot;. Other factors in the work&#x27;s renown were the large number of early performances, gramophone records, including Ravel&#x27;s own, transcriptions and radio broadcasts, together with the 1934 motion picture &quot;Bolero&quot; starring George Raft and Carole Lombard, in which the music plays an important role.

==Music==

&quot;Boléro&quot; is written for a large orchestra consisting of:
* &quot;woodwinds&quot;: piccolo, 2 flutes (one doubling on piccolo), 2 oboes (one doubling on oboe d&#x27;amore), cor anglais, 2 clarinets (one doubles on E-flat clarinet), bass clarinet, 2 saxophones (sopranino and soprano doubling tenor), 2 bassoons, contrabassoon
* &quot;brass&quot;: 4 horns, 4 trumpets (3 in C, one in D), 3 trombones (2 tenor and one bass trombone), bass tuba
* 3 timpani &quot;and 4 percussionists&quot;: 2 snare drums, bass drum, pair of cymbals, tam-tam
* celesta and harp
* &quot;strings&quot;

The instrumentation calls for a sopranino saxophone in F, which never existed (modern sopraninos are in E). At the first performance, both the sopranino and soprano saxophone parts were played on the B soprano saxophone, a tradition that continues to this day.

===Structure===
&quot;Boléro&quot; has been called &quot;Ravel&#x27;s most straightforward composition in any medium&quot;. The music is in C major, time, beginning &quot;pianissimo&quot; and rising in a continuous crescendo to &quot;fortissimo&quot;. It is built over an unchanging ostinato rhythm played 169 times on one or more snare drums that remains constant throughout the piece:

On top of this rhythm two melodies are heard, each 18 bars long, and each played twice alternately. The first melody is diatonic, and the second introduces more jazz-influenced elements, with syncopation and flattened notes (technically it is mostly in the Phrygian mode). The first melody descends through one octave, the second through two octaves. The bass line and accompaniment are initially played on pizzicato strings, mainly using rudimentary tonic and dominant notes. Tension is provided by the contrast between the steady percussive rhythm, and the &quot;expressive vocal melody trying to break free&quot;. Interest is maintained by constant reorchestration of the theme, leading to a variety of timbres, and by a steady crescendo. Both themes are repeated eight times. At the climax, the first theme is repeated a ninth time, then the second theme takes over and breaks briefly into a new tune in E major before finally returning to the tonic key of C major.

The melody is passed among different instruments: (1) flute, (2) clarinet, (3) bassoon, (4) E clarinet, (5) oboe d&#x27;amore, (6) trumpet and flute (latter is not heard clearly and in higher octave than the first part), (7) tenor saxophone, (8) soprano saxophone, (9) horn, piccolos and celesta; (10) oboe, English horn and clarinet; (11) trombone, (12) some of the wind instruments, (13) first violins and some wind instruments, (14) first and second violins together with some wind instruments, (15) violins and some of the wind instruments, (16) some instruments in the orchestra, and finally (17) most but not all of the instruments in the orchestra (with bass drum, cymbals and tam-tam).

While the melody continues to be played in C throughout, from the middle onward other instruments double it in different keys. The first such doubling involves a horn playing the melody in C, while a celesta doubles it 2 and 3 octaves above and two piccolos play the melody in the keys of G and E, respectively. This functions as a reinforcement of the first, second, third, and fourth overtones of each note of the melody (though the &quot;G major&quot; is 2 cents flat, and the &quot;E major&quot; is 14 cents sharp). The other significant &quot;key doubling&quot; involves sounding the melody a 5th above or a 4th below, in G major. Other than these &quot;key doublings&quot;, Ravel simply harmonizes the melody with diatonic chords.

The following table shows the instruments playing in each section of the piece (in order):

The accompaniment becomes gradually thicker and louder until the whole orchestra is playing at the very end. Just before the end (rehearsal number 18 in the score), there is a sudden change of key to E major, but C major is reestablished after just eight bars. Six bars from the end, the bass drum, cymbals, and tam-tam make their first entry, and the trombones play raucous glissandi while the whole orchestra beats out the rhythm that has been played on the snare drum from the first bar. Finally, the work descends from a dissonant B minor over F minor chord to a C major chord.

===Tempo and duration===
The tempo indication in the score is &quot;Tempo di Bolero, moderato assai&quot; (&quot;tempo of a bolero, very moderate&quot;). In Ravel&#x27;s copy of the score, the printed metronome mark of 76 per quarter is crossed out and 66 is substituted. Later editions of the score suggest a tempo of 72. Ravel&#x27;s own recording from January 1930 starts at approximately 66 per quarter, slightly slowing down later on to 60–63. Its total duration is 15 minutes 50 seconds. Coppola&#x27;s first recording, at which Ravel was present, has a similar duration of 15 minutes 40 seconds. Ravel said in an interview with &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; that the piece lasts 17 minutes.

An average performance lasts about 15 minutes, with the slowest recordings, such as that by Ravel&#x27;s associate Pedro de Freitas Branco, extending well beyond 18 minutes and the fastest, such as Leopold Stokowski&#x27;s 1940 recording with the All American Youth Orchestra, approaching 12 minutes. In May 1994, with the Munich Philharmonic on tour in Cologne, conductor Sergiu Celibidache at the age of 82 gave a performance that lasted 17 minutes and 53 seconds, perhaps a record in the modern era.

At Coppola&#x27;s first recording, Ravel indicated strongly that he preferred a steady tempo, criticizing the conductor for getting faster at the end of the work. According to Coppola&#x27;s own report:

Maurice Ravel... did not have confidence in me for the &quot;Boléro&quot;. He was afraid that my Mediterranean temperament would overtake me, and that I would rush the tempo. I assembled the orchestra at the Salle Pleyel, and Ravel took a seat beside me. Everything went well until the final part, where, in spite of myself, I increased the tempo by a fraction. Ravel jumped up, came over and pulled at my jacket: &quot;not so fast&quot;, he exclaimed, and we had to begin again.

Ravel&#x27;s preference for a slower tempo is confirmed by his unhappiness with Toscanini&#x27;s performance, as reported above. Toscanini&#x27;s 1939 recording with the NBC Symphony Orchestra has a duration of 13 minutes 25 seconds.

==Reception==
Ravel was a stringent critic of his own work. During the composition of &quot;Boléro&quot;, he said to Joaquín Nin that the work had &quot;no form, properly speaking, no development, no or almost no modulation&quot;. In a 1931 interview with &quot;The Daily Telegraph,&quot; he spoke about the work as follows:It constitutes an experiment in a very special and limited direction, and should not be suspected of aiming at achieving anything different from, or anything more than, it actually does achieve. Before its first performance, I issued a warning to the effect that what I had written was a piece lasting seventeen minutes and consisting wholly of &quot;orchestral tissue without music&quot;—of one very long, gradual crescendo. There are no contrasts, and practically no invention except the plan and the manner of execution.

In 1934, in his book &quot;Music Ho!&quot;, Constant Lambert wrote: &quot;There is a definite limit to the length of time a composer can go on writing in one dance rhythm (this limit is obviously reached by Ravel towards the end of &quot;La valse&quot; and towards the beginning of &quot;Boléro&quot;).&quot;

Literary critic Allan Bloom commented in his 1987 bestseller &quot;The Closing of the American Mind&quot;, &quot;Young people know that rock has the beat of sexual intercourse. That is why Ravel&#x27;s &quot;Bolero&quot; is the one piece of classical music that is commonly known and liked by them.&quot;

In a 2011 article for &quot;The Cambridge Quarterly&quot;, Michael Lanford wrote, &quot;throughout his life, Maurice Ravel was captivated by the act of creation outlined in Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s &quot;Philosophy of Composition&quot;.&quot; Since, in his words, &quot;Boléro&quot; defies &quot;traditional methods of musical analysis owing to its melodic, rhythmic, and harmonic repetitiveness,&quot; he offers an analysis that &quot;corresponds to Ravel&#x27;s documented reflections on the creative process and the aesthetic precepts outlined in Poe&#x27;s &quot;Philosophy of Composition&quot;.&quot; Lanford also contends that &quot;Boléro&quot; was quite possibly a deeply personal work for Ravel. As evidence, Lanford cites Ravel&#x27;s admissions that the rhythms of &quot;Boléro&quot; were inspired by the machines of his father&#x27;s factory and melodic materials came from a berceuse Ravel&#x27;s mother sang to him at nighttime. Lanford also proposes that &quot;Boléro&quot; is imbued with tragedy, observing that the snare drum &quot;dehumanizes one of the most sensuously connotative aspects of the bolero&quot;, &quot;instruments with the capacity for melodic expression mimic the machinery,&quot; and the melody consistently ends with a descending tetrachord.

==In popular culture==
&quot;Boléro&quot; gained new attention after it featured prominently in the 1979 romantic comedy &quot;10&quot;, costarring Dudley Moore and Bo Derek. This resulted in massive sales, generated an estimated $1 million in royalties, and briefly made Ravel the best-selling classical composer 40 years after his death.

The French film &quot;Les Uns et les Autres&quot; was also distributed under the name &quot;Boléro&quot;, and features a bolero dance sequence by Jorge Donn at the end.

The ice dancing pair Torvill and Dean danced to a four-and-a-half-minute version of &quot;Boléro&quot; in winning the gold medal in ice dancing at the 1984 Winter Olympics, receiving perfect 6.0s for artistic merit.

The eight-minute short film &quot;Le batteur du Boléro&quot; (1992) by Patrice Leconte concentrates on the drummer, played by Jacques Villeret, and the problems of his musical part. The film was screened out of competition at the 1992 Cannes Film Festival.

&quot;Boléro&quot; played during the torch-lighting ceremony of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and 2024 Paris Paralympics.

It was used by Kamila Valieva in her 2021–22 season&#x27;s free skate program.

A version was recorded with Frank Zappa conducting an all-brass big-band ensemble.

Koji Kondo, composer at Nintendo, planned to use &quot;Boléro&quot; as the opening crawl for the first &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; video game, but shortly before release was forced to use other music from the game instead due to copyright concerns.

Angélique Kidjo performed an adaptation of &quot;Boléro&quot; in the song &quot;Lonlon&quot; for her 2007 album &quot;Djin Djin&quot;.

Sigge Eklund played &quot;Boléro&quot; repeatedly in his episode of the Swedish radio programme Sommar because his grandfather—actor Bengt Eklund, whom the programme is about—liked the piece.

== Public domain ==
In France, &quot;Boléro&quot;&#x27;s copyright expired on 1 May 2016. The work is public domain in Canada, China, Japan, New Zealand, South Africa, and many others where the copyright term is &quot;Life + 50 years&quot;. It is also public domain in the European Union (where the term is Life + 70 years). In the United States, &quot;Boléro&quot; remained under copyright until 31 December 2024, as it was first published in 1929 with the prescribed copyright notice. The last remaining rights owner, Evelyne Pen de Castel, has entered a number of claims that the work was in fact co-created with the designer Alexandre Benois. The effect would be to extend the copyright (when performed as a ballet) to 2039. French courts and the French authors&#x27; society SACEM repeatedly rejected the claims. The matter was due to be decided on 24 June 2024 before the court in Nanterre, and on 28 June it was reported that the court rejected the claim.

<text>Aston Clinton is a historic village and civil parish in the Vale of Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire, England. The village lies at the foot of the Chiltern Hills, between the Wendover and Aylesbury arms of the Grand Union Canal. Surrounding towns include Wendover to the south, Aylesbury to the west, and Tring to the east - across the nearby county border with Hertfordshire.

==History==
It is believed that the village started at the crossing of two Roman roads, Akeman Street and Icknield Way, both of which are still main roads in the village. After the fall of the Roman Empire, it became a Saxon settlement and remains of a Saxon cemetery were found during the construction of the Aston Clinton Bypass.

Before the Norman Conquest of England in 1066, the settlement was probably held under patronage of King Edward the Confessor. The village is recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086, where in Old English it was called &quot;Estone&quot;, which means &quot;eastern estate&quot;.

The &quot;manor&quot;, later to be known as Aston Clinton, was for a short period after 1100 under the control of Edward de Salisbury, who was King Henry I&#x27;s standard-bearer. In 1217 King Henry III gave it to Sir William de Farendon. However, by 1237 the manor was owned by the de Clinton family, hence the name at that time of &quot;Aston de Clinton&quot;. William de Clinton separated out from Aston Clinton to a new manor called Chivery as a dowry for his daughter Alice. Sometime after 1239, King Edward I granted the estates to the Montacutes, who were the ancestors of the Earls of Salisbury. Their descendant the Countess of Salisbury was beheaded by King Henry VIII in 1541. Successive families have owned the manor, passing by marriage from the Hastings to the Barringtons, Gerards, and then to Lord Lake of Aston Clinton later to become Gerard Lake, 1st Viscount Lake.

On 22 September 1934, a twin-engined biplane named &quot;Youth of New Zealand&quot; of Sir Alan Cobham&#x27;s National Aviation Displays, crashed into a field near the canal at Aston Clinton. The &quot;Youth of New Zealand&quot; had just departed from Heston Aerodrome after being refuelled when it crashed, killing all four crew. The probable cause was the failure of a bolt through metal fatigue.

The car manufacturer Aston Martin took one part of its name from the nearby Aston Hill combining it with that of its co-founder Lionel Martin. The firm had great success in the Aston Clinton Hillclimb competition up nearby Aston Hill. A plaque now marks the site.

The modern parish of Aston Clinton was created in 1934. Of the other medieval manors:- Dundridge; Chivery; St Leonards and Vaches, historically all closely associated with Aston Clinton, only Chivery and Vaches have remained distinct parts of Aston Clinton, which now forms part of Aylesbury Vale District. Dundridge manor became part of the ecclesiastical parish of St Leonards which has itself since 1934 become part of the parish of Cholesbury-cum-St Leonards.

==The village today==

There are many historic buildings with listed status in Aston Clinton including Anthony Hall, a concert hall situated in the centre of the village which was donated to the community by the widow of Anthony Nathan de Rothschild. To the south-east of the village in Green Park was the former Aston Clinton House. The village also contains St. Michael and All Angels parish church, dating from the late medieval period.

The village was used as a filming location for the 1962 film &quot;Lolita&quot;. The TV programme &quot;Hotel Babylon&quot; was filmed in Aston Clinton.

Aston Clinton Household Recycling Centre opened in 2009 and was built to the north of the village off the A41 Aston Clinton bypass.

In 2011 a new industrial park opened in Aston Clinton called Halton Brook Business Park, designed and developed by Horstonbridge Development Management which replaced an old dairy, demolished in 2006, that once stood in the same location. Two companies currently occupy Halton Brook, Zethon &amp; DeSoutter Medical.

<doc id="319832" wikidata="Q2895240" url="?curid=319832" title="James Rubin">
<text>James Phillip Rubin (born March 28, 1960) is an American former diplomat and journalist who served as U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs in the Clinton Administration from 1997–2000. He wrote a regular column on foreign affairs for &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; of London, and has been Diplomatic Counselor to the Secretary General of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) since June 2021.

Having served in the State Department during the administration of President Bill Clinton, Rubin became a Sky News presenter with his own show called World News Tonight. The show was short-lived and after it was cancelled he became a commentator for the channel. In 2013, he moved from New York City to live permanently in London, England, with his then-wife, CNN Chief International Correspondent and anchor Christiane Amanpour, and their teenage son.

In December 2022, Rubin was appointed Special Envoy and Coordinator of the State Department&#x27;s Global Engagement Center.

==Early life==
Rubin was born on March 28, 1960, into a Jewish family in New York City, and raised in the village of Larchmont, in Westchester County, New York. He is the son of Harvey Rubin, a publisher and President of Pindar Press, and his wife, Judith (&quot;née&quot; Lowe), who trained students specializing in psychiatry. His sister Elizabeth Rubin is a journalist, Edward R. Murrow press fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), and staff writer for &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;.

==Education==
Rubin was educated at Phillips Exeter and Mamaroneck High School, from which he graduated in 1977, followed by Columbia College at Columbia University, from which he graduated with a BA in political science in 1982, and a Master of International Affairs (MIA) in 1984 from Columbia&#x27;s School of International and Public Affairs. At Columbia, Rubin was a student of Zalmay Khalilzad, later U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan, Iraq and the United Nations under President George W. Bush. Rubin also attended Boston University in Massachusetts.

==Career==
Early in his career, Rubin was the Assistant Director of Research at the Arms Control Association.

===Clinton administration===
Rubin served under President Clinton as Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs and Chief Spokesman for the State Department from 1997 to May 2000. In the Clinton administration, he was considered Secretary Madeleine Albright&#x27;s right-hand man.

===2000–2006: academia and media===
After leaving government, Rubin and his family relocated to London. He took on a portfolio career, becoming: a Visiting Professor of International Relations at the London School of Economics; a partner at communications consultancy Brunswick; and between 2002 and 2003, the host of PBS&#x27;s &quot;Wide Angle&quot; series, a weekly international affairs program.

Returning to the United States, Rubin served as chief foreign policy spokesman for General Wesley Clark&#x27;s presidential campaign from the launch of Clark&#x27;s campaign in 2003 until Clark withdrew during the Democratic Party&#x27;s 2004 Presidential Primaries, and then worked for Democratic nominee John Kerry during his 2004 Presidential Campaign, serving as a senior advisor for national security affairs.

Returning to London, from October 2005 to July 2006 Rubin became lead news anchor on &quot;World News Tonight&quot; on Sky News.

===Support for Hillary Clinton 2008 candidacy===
After returning to the United States in 2007 in the run-up to the 2008 presidential election, Rubin was a member of Hillary Clinton&#x27;s campaign team for the 2008 Democratic nomination. He caused some controversy when he described Lord Trimble, the Nobel Peace Prize-winner and former First Minister of Northern Ireland, as a &quot;crankpot&quot; for stating that Hillary Clinton&#x27;s claim to have been &quot;helpful&quot; in the Northern Ireland peace process was &quot;a wee bit silly&quot;. Rubin also stated that Trimble&#x27;s opinion was not important as he was &quot;a Protestant&quot;, and so &quot;traditionally conservative&quot;.

During the 2008 campaign, Rubin was a guest on CNN&#x27;s &quot;Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer&quot; in a foreign policy discussion with Susan Rice, who later became Barack Obama&#x27;s nominee for Ambassador to the United Nations.

===2009–present===

Rubin joined Bloomberg News in December 2010 and oversees editorial issues of Bloomberg News in Central and South America, Mexico, Europe, the Middle East, Asia and Africa. He also led Bloomberg View, a Bloomberg op-ed project, with David Shipley. After only 10 months, he quit the position, appointed adjunct professor at Columbia University. Gov. Andrew Cuomo appointed Rubin commissioner of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey in 2011 as well as a counselor to the state&#x27;s Empire State Development Corporation.

Rubin resigned all of his US-based positions on May 29, 2013, announcing that the family would return to London to work on several projects. Rubin was appointed scholar in residence at Oxford University&#x27;s Rothermere American Institute. He also wrote a weekly foreign affairs column for &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; and co-chaired a high-level panel on Extending American Power for the Center for a New American Security in Washington.

Rubin was chair of International Policy and Strategy at Ballard Partners, based in Washington DC until June 2020. He was also a contributing editor at Politico, writing on U.S. foreign policy and world affairs.

Rubin relocated to Paris on June 1, 2021 to serve as diplomatic counselor to the newly elected Secretary General of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). At the OECD, his portfolio is focused on advising Secretary General Cormann on global affairs and diplomacy with key countries in Europe, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East.

Rubin was appointed as Special Envoy and Coordinator of the Global Engagement Center on November 16, 2022 by Secretary of State Antony Blinken.

==Personal life==
In 1998, Rubin, who at the time was spokesman for the U.S. State Department, married Christiane Amanpour in a Catholic wedding at Bracciano, Italy. Having moved to London, England, they returned to New York City in 2010, where they rented an apartment in Manhattan&#x27;s Upper West Side. 

In 2013, he, his wife and son, moved back to London to live permanently. It was announced in July 2018 that Rubin and Amanpour were getting a divorce.

<text>Vladimiro Ariel Dorfman (born May 6, 1942) is an Argentine-Chilean-American novelist, playwright, essayist, academic and human rights activist. A citizen of the United States since 2004, he has been a professor of literature and Latin American studies at Duke University, in Durham, North Carolina, since 1985.

==Background and education==
Dorfman was born in Buenos Aires on May 6, 1942, the son of Adolf Dorfman, who was born in Odessa (then Russian Empire) to a well-to-do Jewish family, and became a prominent Argentine professor of economics and the author of &quot;Historia de la Industria Argentina&quot;, and Fanny Zelicovich Dorfman, who was born in Kishinev of Bessarabian Jewish descent.

Shortly after his birth, they moved to the United States, where he spent his first ten years of childhood in New York until his family was forced to relocate due to &quot;the anti-Communist frenzy&quot;. His family eventually settled in Chile in 1954. He attended, and later worked as a professor at, the University of Chile, marrying Angélica Malinarich in 1966 and becoming a Chilean citizen in 1967. From 1968 to 1969, he attended graduate school at the University of California, Berkeley and then returned to Chile.

Since the restoration of democracy in Chile in 1990, he and his wife Angélica have divided their time between Santiago and the United States.

==Career==
From 1970 to 1973, Dorfman served as a cultural adviser to President Salvador Allende. During this time he wrote, with Armand Mattelart, a critique of North American cultural imperialism, &quot;How to Read Donald Duck&quot;. Dorfman went on to live in Paris, Amsterdam and Washington, D.C. Since 1985, he has taught at Duke University, where he is currently Walter Hines Page Research Professor of Literature and Professor of Latin American studies.

Dorfman details his life of exile and bicultural living in his memoir, &quot;Heading South, Looking North&quot;, which has been acclaimed by Elie Wiesel, Nadine Gordimer, Thomas Keneally and others.

In 2020, he wrote in the Los Angeles Times: “Fifty years ago today, on the night of Sept. 4, 1970, I was dancing, along with a multitude of others, in the streets of Santiago de Chile. We were celebrating the election of Salvador Allende, the first democratically elected socialist leader in the world. President Allende’s victory had historical significance beyond Chile. Before then, political revolutions had been violent, imposed by force of arms. Allende and his left-wing coalition used peaceful means, proclaiming it unnecessary to repress one’s adversaries to achieve social justice. Radical change could happen within the confines and promises of a democracy. I have often fantasized about how different the world would be if Allende had not been overthrown, three years later, in a bloody coup. I wonder where humanity would be if his peaceful revolution had been allowed to run its course and become a template for other countries.”

==Literary work==

Dorfman&#x27;s work often deals with the horrors of tyranny and, in later works, the trials of exile. In an interview in &quot;BOMB Magazine&quot;, Dorfman said, &quot;I&#x27;m constantly trying to figure out how you can be true to an experience which in fact very few people in the world would understand, such as having most of your friends disappear or be tortured, and at the same time finding a way of telling that story so other people in other places can read their own lives into that.&quot; His most famous play, &quot;Death and the Maiden&quot;, describes the encounter of a former torture victim with the man she believed tortured her; it was made into a film in 1994 by Roman Polanski starring Sigourney Weaver and Ben Kingsley. Dorfman identified &quot;the stark, painful Chilean transition to democracy&quot; as &quot;Death and the Maiden&quot;&#x27;s central theme. The play received a 20th anniversary revival in the 2011–2012 season at the Harold Pinter Theatre in London&#x27;s West End, directed by Jeremy Herrin and starring Thandiwe Newton, Tom Goodman-Hill and Anthony Calf. The story was adapted in 2020 into a second English-language film, &quot;The Secrets We Keep&quot;, directed by Yuval Adler, screenplay by Adler and Ryan Covington, and starring Noomi Rapace, Joel Kinnaman and Chris Messina.

His thesis on the absurd in plays of Harold Pinter was published in Spanish as &quot;El absurdo entre cuatro paredes: el teatro de Harold Pinter&quot; &quot;(The absurd within four walls: the theater of Harold Pinter)&quot; by Editorial Universitaria, in Santiago, Chile, in 1968 (124 pages). Pinter later became a personal friend as well as an influence on Dorfman&#x27;s work and political thinking.

A critic of Pinochet, he has written extensively about the General&#x27;s extradition case for the Spanish newspaper &quot;El País&quot; and other publications, and in the book &quot;Exorcising Terror: The Incredible Unending Trial of Gen. Augusto Pinochet.&quot; Rather than distinguishing between politics and art, Dorfman believes &quot;that one’s writing is deeply political,&quot; and, at its best, &quot;engages the major dilemmas...of the community.&quot;

Dorfman&#x27;s works have been translated into more than 40 languages and performed in over 100 countries. Besides poetry, essays and novels— &quot;Hard Rain&quot;, winner of the Sudamericana Award; &quot;Widows&quot;; &quot;The Last Song of Manuel Sendero&quot;; &quot;Mascara&quot;; &quot;Konfidenz&quot;; &quot;The Nanny and the Iceberg&quot;, and Blake&#x27;s &quot;Therapy&quot;—he has written short stories, including &quot;My House Is on Fire&quot;, and general nonfiction including &quot;The Empire’s Old Clothes: What the Lone Ranger, Babar, and Other Innocent Heroes Do to Our Minds&quot;. He has won various international awards, including two Kennedy Center Theater Awards. In 1996, with his son, Rodrigo, he received an award for best television drama in Britain for &quot;Prisoners in Time&quot;. His poems, collected in &quot;Last Waltz in Santiago&quot; and &quot;In Case of Fire in a Foreign Land&quot;, have been turned into a half-hour fictional film, &quot;Deadline&quot;, featuring the voices of Emma Thompson, Bono, Harold Pinter and others.

Dorfman&#x27;s human rights play, &quot;Speak Truth to Power: Voices from Beyond the Dark&quot; (based on interviews with human rights defenders conducted by Kerry Kennedy Cuomo), premiered at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., in 2000, and subsequently aired on PBS as part of its &quot;Great Performances&quot; series. The play starred Kevin Kline, Sigourney Weaver, Alec Baldwin and John Malkovich, among others, and was directed by Gregory Mosher. It has gone on to numerous performances around the world, including a run in New York City. On May 3, 2010, a &quot;Speak Truth to Power&quot; benefit for survivors of the 2010 Chilean earthquake was put on by New York&#x27;s Public Theater, directed by David Esbjornson, and featuring an all-star cast of Elias Koteas, Marcia Gay Harden, Alfred Molina, Julianne Moore, Viggo Mortensen, Gloria Reuben, Paul Sorvino, Meryl Streep, Stanley Tucci and Debra Winger.

Dorfman&#x27;s play &quot;The Other Side&quot; had its world premiere at the New National Theatre in Tokyo in 2004 and opened off-Broadway at the Manhattan Theater Club in 2005. Other recent plays include &quot;Purgatorio&quot; at the Seattle Rep in 2005 and at the Arcola Theatre in London in 2008; &quot;Picasso’s Closet,&quot; a counterfactual history in which the Nazis murder Picasso, had its premiere at Theater J in Washington, D.C., in 2006.

He is also the subject of a feature-length documentary, &quot;A Promise to the Dead: The Exile Journey of Ariel Dorfman&quot;, based on his memoir &quot;Heading South, Looking North&quot; and directed by Peter Raymont. The film had its world premiere at the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival on September 8, 2007. In November 2007, the film was named by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences as one of 15 films on its documentary feature Oscar shortlist. The list was narrowed to five films on January 22, 2008, and &quot;A Promise to the Dead&quot; was not among the five Oscar-nominated documentaries.

His latest works include the Lowell Thomas Award-winning travel book, &quot;Desert Memories&quot;; a collection of essays, &quot;Other Septembers, Many Americas&quot;; a novel he wrote with his youngest son, Joaquín, &quot;Burning City&quot;; &quot;Americanos: Los Pasos de Murieta&quot;; and a new volume of memoirs, &quot;Feeding on Dreams: Confessions of an Unrepentant Exile&quot;. In 2007, his musical, &quot;Dancing Shadows&quot;, opened in Seoul, Korea. This collaboration with Eric Woolfson, the principal composer for the Alan Parsons Project, won five Korean “Tony” awards. In 2011, his play &quot;Purgatorio&quot; has its Spanish language premiere at the Teatro Español in Madrid, starring Viggo Mortensen and Carme Elias.

Dorfman currently has several film projects in development with his sons, Rodrigo and Joaquin Dorfman, including a screen adaptation of his novel, &quot;Blake’s Therapy&quot;.

Dorfman also writes regularly for such publications as &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot; (where he has a featured blog), &quot;Le Monde&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;Unità&quot;.

He is a member of L&#x27;Académie Universelle des Cultures, in Paris, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

<text>The Rutherford scattering experiments were a landmark series of experiments by which scientists learned that every atom has a nucleus where all of its positive charge and most of its mass is concentrated. They deduced this after measuring how an alpha particle beam is scattered when it strikes a thin metal foil. The experiments were performed between 1906 and 1913 by Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden under the direction of Ernest Rutherford at the Physical Laboratories of the University of Manchester.

The physical phenomenon was explained by Rutherford in a classic 1911 paper that eventually led to the widespread use of scattering in particle physics to study subatomic matter. Rutherford scattering or Coulomb scattering is the elastic scattering of charged particles by the Coulomb interaction. The paper also initiated the development of the planetary Rutherford model of the atom and eventually the Bohr model.

Rutherford scattering is now exploited by the materials science community in an analytical technique called Rutherford backscattering.

==Summary==

===Thomson&#x27;s model of the atom===
The prevailing model of atomic structure before Rutherford&#x27;s experiments was devised by J. J. Thomson. Thomson had discovered the electron through his work on cathode rays and proposed that they existed within atoms, and an electric current is electrons hopping from one atom to an adjacent one in a series. There logically had to be a commensurate amount of positive charge to balance the negative charge of the electrons and hold those electrons together. Having no idea what the source of this positive charge was, he tentatively proposed that the positive charge was everywhere in the atom, adopting a spherical shape for simplicity. Thomson imagined that the balance of electrostatic forces would distribute the electrons throughout this sphere in a more or less even manner. Thomson also believed the electrons could move around in this sphere, and in that regard he likened the substance of the sphere to a liquid. In fact the positive sphere was more of an abstraction than anything material. He did not propose a positively-charged subatomic particle; a counterpart to the electron.

Thomson was never able to develop a complete and stable model that could predict any of the other known properties of the atom, such as emission spectra and valencies. The Japanese scientist Hantaro Nagaoka rejected Thomson&#x27;s model on the grounds that opposing charges cannot penetrate each other. He proposed instead that electrons orbit the positive charge like the rings around Saturn. However this model was also known to be unstable.

===Alpha particles and the Thomson atom===
An alpha particle is a positively charged particle of matter that is spontaneously emitted from certain radioactive elements. Alpha particles are so tiny as to be invisible, but they can be detected with the use of phosphorescent screens, photographic plates, or electrodes. Rutherford discovered them in 1899. In 1906, by studying how alpha particle beams are deflected by magnetic and electric fields, he deduced that they were essentially helium atoms stripped of two electrons. Thomson and Rutherford knew nothing about the internal structure of alpha particles. At the time, scientists did not know exactly how many electrons a helium atom had (nor atoms of other elements for that matter), so a helium atom stripped of two electrons might still have ten or so left for all they could tell.

Thomson&#x27;s model was consistent with the experimental evidence available at the time. Thomson studied beta particle scattering which showed small angle deflections modelled as interactions of the particle with many atoms in succession. Each interaction of the particle with the electrons of the atom and the positive background sphere would lead to a tiny deflection, but many such collisions could add up. The scattering of alpha particles was expected to be similar. Rutherford&#x27;s team would show that the multiple scattering model was not needed: single scattering from a compact charge at the centre of the atom would account for all of the scattering data.

===Rutherford, Geiger, and Marsden===
Ernest Rutherford was Langworthy Professor of Physics at the Victoria University of Manchester (now the University of Manchester). He had already received numerous honours for his studies of radiation. He had discovered the existence of alpha rays, beta rays, and gamma rays, and had proved that these were the consequence of the disintegration of atoms. In 1906, he received a visit from the German physicist Hans Geiger, and was so impressed that he asked Geiger to stay and help him with his research. Ernest Marsden was a physics undergraduate student studying under Geiger.

In 1908, Rutherford sought to independently determine the charge and mass of alpha particles. To do this, he wanted to count the number of alpha particles and measure their total charge; the ratio would give the charge of a single alpha particle. Alpha particles are too tiny to see, but Rutherford knew about the Townsend discharge, a cascade effect from ionisation leading to a pulse of electric current. On this principle, Rutherford and Geiger designed a simple counting device which consisted of two electrodes in a glass tube containing low pressure gas. (See #1908 experiment.) Every alpha particle that passed through the gas would create a pulse of electrical current that could be detected and counted. It was the forerunner of the Geiger-Müller Counter.

The counter that Geiger and Rutherford built proved unreliable because the alpha particles were being too strongly deflected by their collisions with the molecules of air within the detection chamber. The highly variable trajectories of the alpha particles meant that they did not all generate the same number of ions as they passed through the gas, thus producing erratic readings. This puzzled Rutherford because he had thought that alpha particles were too heavy to be deflected so strongly. Rutherford asked Geiger to investigate how far matter could scatter alpha rays.

The experiments they designed involved bombarding a metal foil with a beam of alpha particles to observe how the foil scattered them in relation to its thickness and material. They used a phosphorescent screen to measure the trajectories of the particles. Each impact of an alpha particle on the screen produced a tiny flash of light. Geiger worked in a darkened lab for hours on end, counting these tiny scintillations using a microscope. For the metal foil, they tested a variety of metals, but favoured gold because they could make the foil very thin, as gold is the most malleable metal. As a source of alpha particles, Rutherford&#x27;s substance of choice was radium, which is thousands of times more radioactive than uranium.

===Scattering theory and the new atomic model===

In a 1909 experiment, Geiger and Marsden discovered that the metal foils could scatter some alpha particles in all directions, sometimes more than 90°. This should have been impossible according to Thomson&#x27;s model. According to Thomson&#x27;s model, all the alpha particles should have gone straight through.

In Thomson&#x27;s model of the atom, the sphere of positive charge that fills the atom and encapsulates the electrons is permeable; the electrons could move around in it, after all. Therefore, an alpha particle should be able to pass through this sphere if the electrostatic forces within permit it. Thomson himself did not study how an alpha particle might be scattered in such a collision with an atom, but he did study beta particle scattering. He calculated that a beta particle would only experience very small deflection when passing through an atom, and even after passing through many atoms in a row, the total deflection should still be less than 1°. Alpha particles typically have much more momentum than beta particles and therefore should likewise experience only the slightest deflection.

The extreme scattering observed forced Rutherford to revise the model of the atom. The issue in Thomson&#x27;s model was that the charges were too diffuse to produce a sufficiently strong electrostatic force to cause such repulsion. Therefore they had to be more concentrated. In Rutherford&#x27;s new model, the positive charge does not fill the entire volume of the atom but instead constitutes a tiny nucleus at least 10,000 times smaller than the atom as a whole. All that positive charge concentrated in a much smaller volume produces a much stronger electric field near its surface. The nucleus also carried most of the atom&#x27;s mass. This meant that it could deflect alpha particles by up to 180° depending on how close they pass. The electrons surround this nucleus, spread throughout the atom&#x27;s volume. Because their negative charge is diffuse and their combined mass is low, they have a negligible effect on the alpha particle.

To verify his model, Rutherford developed a scientific model to predict the intensity of alpha particles at the different angles they scattered coming out of the gold foil, assuming all of the positive charge was concentrated at the centre of the atom. This model was validated in an experiment performed in 1913. His model explained both the beta scattering results of Thomson and the alpha scattering results of Geiger and Marsden.

===Legacy===
There was little reaction to Rutherford&#x27;s now-famous 1911 paper in the first years. The paper was primarily about alpha particle scattering in an era before particle scattering was a primary tool for physics. The probability techniques he used and confusing collection of observations involved were not immediately compelling.

==== Nuclear physics ====
The first impacts were to encourage new focus on scattering experiments. For example the first results from a cloud chamber, by C.T.R. Wilson shows alpha particle scattering and also appeared in 1911. Over time, particle scattering became a major aspect of theoretical and experimental physics; Rutherford&#x27;s concept of a &quot;cross-section&quot; now dominates the descriptions of experimental particle physics. The historian Silvan S. Schweber suggests that Rutherford&#x27;s approach marked the shift to viewing all interactions and measurements in physics as scattering processes. After the nucleus - a term Rutherford introduced in 1912 - became the accepted model for the core of atoms, Rutherford&#x27;s analysis of the scattering of alpha particles created a new branch of physics, nuclear physics.

==== Atomic model ====

Rutherford&#x27;s new atom model caused no stir. Rutherford explicitly ignores the electrons, only mentioning Hantaro Nagaoka&#x27;s Saturnian model of electrons orbiting a tiny &quot;sun&quot;, a model that had been previously rejected as mechanically unstable. By ignoring the electrons Rutherford also ignores any potential implications for atomic spectroscopy for chemistry. Rutherford himself did not press the case for his atomic model: his own 1913 book on &quot;Radioactive substances and their radiations&quot; only mentions the atom twice; other books by other authors around this time focus on Thomson&#x27;s model. 
The impact of Rutherford&#x27;s nuclear model came after Niels Bohr arrived as a post-doctoral student in Manchester at Rutherford&#x27;s invitation. Bohr dropped his work on the Thomson model in favour of Rutherford&#x27;s nuclear model, developing the Rutherford–Bohr model over the next several years. Eventually Bohr incorporated early ideas of quantum mechanics into the model of the atom, allowing prediction of electronic spectra and concepts of chemistry.

Hantaro Nagaoka, who had proposed a Saturnian model of the atom, wrote to Rutherford from Tokyo in 1911: &quot;I have been struck with the simpleness of the apparatus you employ and the brilliant results you obtain.&quot; The astronomer Arthur Eddington called Rutherford&#x27;s discovery the most important scientific achievement since Democritus proposed the atom ages earlier. Rutherford has since been hailed as &quot;the father of nuclear physics&quot;.

In a lecture delivered on 15 October 1936 at Cambridge University, Rutherford described his shock at the results of the 1909 experiment:

Rutherford&#x27;s claim of surprise makes for a good story but by the time of the Geiger-Marsden experiment the result confirmed suspicions Rutherford developed from his many previous experiments.
==Experiments==
===Alpha particle scattering: 1906 and 1908 experiments===
Rutherford&#x27;s first steps towards his discovery of the nature of the atom came from his work to understand alpha particles.
In 1906, Rutherford noticed that alpha particles passing through sheets of mica were deflected by the sheets by as much as 2 degrees. Rutherford placed a radioactive source in a sealed tube ending with a narrow slits followed by a photographic plate. Half of the slit was covered by a thin layer of mica. A magnetic field around the tube was altered every 10 minutes to reject the effect of beta rays, known to be sensitive to magnetic fields. The tube was evacuated to different amounts and a series of images recorded. At the lowest pressure the image of the open slit was clear, while images of the mica covered slit or the open slit at higher pressures were fuzzy. Rutherford explained these results as alpha-particle scattering in a paper published in 1906. He already understood the implications of the observation for models of atoms: &quot;such a result brings out clearly the fact that the atoms of matter must be the seat of very intense electrical forces&quot;.

A 1908 paper by Geiger, &quot;On the Scattering of α-Particles by Matter&quot;, describes the following experiment. He constructed a long glass tube, nearly two metres long. At one end of the tube was a quantity of &quot;radium emanation&quot; (R) as a source of alpha particles. The opposite end of the tube was covered with a phosphorescent screen (Z). In the middle of the tube was a 0.9 mm-wide slit. The alpha particles from R passed through the slit and created a glowing patch of light on the screen. A microscope (M) was used to count the scintillations on the screen and measure their spread. Geiger pumped all the air out of the tube so that the alpha particles would be unobstructed, and they left a neat and tight image on the screen that corresponded to the shape of the slit. Geiger then allowed some air into the tube, and the glowing patch became more diffuse. Geiger then pumped out the air and placed one or two gold foils over the slit at AA. This too caused the patch of light on the screen to become more spread out, with the larger spread for two layers. This experiment demonstrated that both air and solid matter could markedly scatter alpha particles. 
===Alpha particle reflection: the 1909 experiment===

The results of the initial alpha particle scattering experiments were confusing. The angular spread of the particle on the screen varied greatly with the shape of the apparatus and its internal pressure. Rutherford suggested that Ernest Marsden, a physics undergraduate student studying under Geiger, should look for diffusely reflected or back-scattered alpha particles, even though these were not expected. Marsden&#x27;s first crude reflector got results, so Geiger helped him create a more sophisticated apparatus. They were able to demonstrate that 1 in 8000 alpha particle collisions were diffuse reflections. Although this fraction was small, it was much larger than the Thomson model of the atom could explain.
These results where published in a 1909 paper, &quot;On a Diffuse Reflection of the α-Particles&quot;, where Geiger and Marsden described the experiment by which they proved that alpha particles can indeed be scattered by more than 90°. In their experiment, they prepared a small conical glass tube (AB) containing &quot;radium emanation&quot; (radon), &quot;radium A&quot; (actual radium), and &quot;radium C&quot; (bismuth-214); its open end was sealed with mica. This was their alpha particle emitter. They then set up a lead plate (P), behind which they placed a fluorescent screen (S). The tube was held on the opposite side of plate, such that the alpha particles it emitted could not directly strike the screen. They noticed a few scintillations on the screen because some alpha particles got around the plate by bouncing off air molecules. They then placed a metal foil (R) to the side of the lead plate. They tested with lead, gold, tin, aluminium, copper, silver, iron, and platinum. They pointed the tube at the foil to see if the alpha particles would bounce off it and strike the screen on the other side of the plate, and observed an increase in the number of scintillations on the screen. Counting the scintillations, they observed that metals with higher atomic mass, such as gold, reflected more alpha particles than lighter ones such as aluminium.

Geiger and Marsden then wanted to estimate the total number of alpha particles that were reflected. The previous setup was unsuitable for doing this because the tube contained several radioactive substances (radium plus its decay products) and thus the alpha particles emitted had varying ranges, and because it was difficult for them to ascertain at what rate the tube was emitting alpha particles. This time, they placed a small quantity of radium C (bismuth-214) on the lead plate, which bounced off a platinum reflector (R) and onto the screen. They concluded that approximately 1 in 8,000 of the alpha particles that struck the reflector bounced onto the screen. By measuring the reflection from thin foils they showed that the effect due to a volume and not a surface effect. When contrasted with the vast number of alpha particles that pass unhindered through a metal foil, this small number of large angle reflections was a strange result that meant very large forces were involved.
===Dependence on foil material and thickness: the 1910 experiment===

A 1910 paper by Geiger, &quot;The Scattering of the α-Particles by Matter&quot;, describes an experiment to measure how the most probable angle through which an alpha particle is deflected varies with the material it passes through, the thickness of the material, and the velocity of the alpha particles. He constructed an airtight glass tube from which the air was pumped out. At one end was a bulb (B) containing &quot;radium emanation&quot; (radon-222). By means of mercury, the radon in B was pumped up the narrow glass pipe whose end at A was plugged with mica. At the other end of the tube was a fluorescent zinc sulfide screen (S). The microscope which he used to count the scintillations on the screen was affixed to a vertical millimetre scale with a vernier, which allowed Geiger to precisely measure where the flashes of light appeared on the screen and thus calculate the particles&#x27; angles of deflection. The alpha particles emitted from A was narrowed to a beam by a small circular hole at D. Geiger placed a metal foil in the path of the rays at D and E to observe how the zone of flashes changed. He tested gold, tin, silver, copper, and aluminium. He could also vary the velocity of the alpha particles by placing extra sheets of mica or aluminium at A.

From the measurements he took, Geiger came to the following conclusions:
* the most probable angle of deflection increases with the thickness of the material
* the most probable angle of deflection is proportional to the atomic mass of the substance
* the most probable angle of deflection decreases with the velocity of the alpha particles


=== Rutherford&#x27;s &quot;Structure of the Atom&quot; paper (1911) ===

Considering the results of these experiments, Rutherford published a landmark paper in 1911 titled &quot;The Scattering of α and β Particles by Matter and the Structure of the Atom&quot; wherein he showed that single scattering from a very small and intense electric charge predicts primarily small-angle scattering with small but measurable amounts of backscattering. For the purpose of his mathematical calculations he assumed this central charge was positive, but he admitted he could not prove this and that he had to wait for other experiments to develop his theory.

Rutherford developed a mathematical equation that modelled how the foil should scatter the alpha particles if all the positive charge and most of the atomic mass was concentrated in a point at the centre of an atom.
From the scattering data, Rutherford estimated the central charge &quot;qn&quot; to be about +100 units.

Rutherford&#x27;s paper does not discuss any electron arrangement beyond discussions on the scattering from Thomson&#x27;s plum pudding model and Nagaoka&#x27;s Saturnian model. He shows that the scattering results predicted by Thomson&#x27;s model are also explained by single scattering, but that Thomson&#x27;s model does not explain large angle scattering. He says that Nagaoka&#x27;s model, having a compact charge, would agree with the scattering data. The Saturnian model had previously been rejected on other grounds. The so-called Rutherford model of the atom with orbiting electrons was not proposed by Rutherford in the 1911 paper.

===Confirming the scattering theory: the 1913 experiment===
In a 1913 paper, &quot;The Laws of Deflexion of α Particles through Large Angles&quot;, Geiger and Marsden describe a series of experiments by which they sought to experimentally verify Rutherford&#x27;s equation. Rutherford&#x27;s equation predicted that the number of scintillations per minute &quot;s&quot; that will be observed at a given angle &quot;Φ&quot; should be proportional to:
# cosec4
# thickness of foil &quot;t&quot;
# magnitude of the square of central charge &quot;Qn&quot;

Their 1913 paper describes four experiments by which they proved each of these four relationships.
To test how the scattering varied with the angle of deflection (i.e. if &quot;s&quot; ∝ csc4). Geiger and Marsden built an apparatus that consisted of a hollow metal cylinder mounted on a turntable. Inside the cylinder was a metal foil (F) and a radiation source containing radon (R), mounted on a detached column (T) which allowed the cylinder to rotate independently. The column was also a tube by which air was pumped out of the cylinder. A microscope (M) with its objective lens covered by a fluorescent zinc sulfide screen (S) penetrated the wall of the cylinder and pointed at the metal foil. They tested with silver and gold foils. By turning the table, the microscope could be moved a full circle around the foil, allowing Geiger to observe and count alpha particles deflected by up to 150°. Correcting for experimental error, Geiger and Marsden found that the number of alpha particles that are deflected by a given angle &quot;Φ&quot; is indeed proportional to csc4.
Geiger and Marsden then tested how the scattering varied with the thickness of the foil (i.e. if &quot;s&quot; ∝ &quot;t&quot;). They constructed a disc (S) with six holes drilled in it. The holes were covered with metal foil (F) of varying thickness, or none for control. This disc was then sealed in a brass ring (A) between two glass plates (B and C). The disc could be rotated by means of a rod (P) to bring each window in front of the alpha particle source (R). On the rear glass pane was a zinc sulfide screen (Z). Geiger and Marsden found that the number of scintillations that appeared on the screen was indeed proportional to the thickness, as long as the thickness was small.

Geiger and Marsden reused the apparatus to measure how the scattering pattern varied with the square of the nuclear charge (i.e. if &quot;s&quot; ∝ &quot;Q&quot;&quot;n&quot;2). Geiger and Marsden did not know what the positive charge of the nucleus of their metals were (they had only just discovered the nucleus existed at all), but they assumed it was proportional to the atomic weight, so they tested whether the scattering was proportional to the atomic weight squared. Geiger and Marsden covered the holes of the disc with foils of gold, tin, silver, copper, and aluminium. They measured each foil&#x27;s stopping power by equating it to an equivalent thickness of air. They counted the number of scintillations per minute that each foil produced on the screen. They divided the number of scintillations per minute by the respective foil&#x27;s air equivalent, then divided again by the square root of the atomic weight (Geiger and Marsden knew that for foils of equal stopping power, the number of atoms per unit area is proportional to the square root of the atomic weight). Thus, for each metal, Geiger and Marsden obtained the number of scintillations that a fixed number of atoms produce. For each metal, they then divided this number by the square of the atomic weight, and found that the ratios were about the same. Thus they proved that &quot;s&quot; ∝ &quot;Q&quot;&quot;n&quot;2.

Finally, Geiger and Marsden tested how the scattering varied with the velocity of the alpha particles (i.e. if &quot;s&quot; ∝ ). Using the same apparatus, they slowed the alpha particles by placing extra sheets of mica in front of the alpha particle source. They found that, within the range of experimental error, the number of scintillations was indeed proportional to .
===Positive charge on nucleus: 1913===
In his 1911 paper (see above), Rutherford assumed that the central charge of the atom was positive, but a negative charge would have fitted his scattering model just as well. In a 1913 paper, Rutherford declared that the &quot;nucleus&quot; (as he now called it) was indeed positively charged, based on the result of experiments exploring the scattering of alpha particles in various gases.

In 1917, Rutherford and his assistant William Kay began exploring the passage of alpha particles through gases such as hydrogen and nitrogen. In this experiment, they shot a beam of alpha particles through hydrogen, and they carefully placed their detector—a zinc sulfide screen—just beyond the range of the alpha particles, which were absorbed by the gas. They nonetheless picked up charged particles of some sort causing scintillations on the screen. Rutherford interpreted this as alpha particles knocking the hydrogen nuclei forwards in the direction of the beam, not backwards.

== Rutherford&#x27;s scattering model ==

Rutherford begins his 1911 paper with a discussion of Thomson&#x27;s results on scattering of beta particles, a form of radioactivity that results in high velocity electrons. Thomson&#x27;s model had electrons circulating inside of a sphere of positive charge. Rutherford highlights the need for compound or multiple scattering events: the deflections predicted for each collision are much less than one degree. He then proposes a model which will produce large deflections on a single encounter: place all of the positive charge at the centre of the sphere and ignore the electron scattering as insignificant. The concentrated charge will explain why most alpha particles do not scatter to any measurable degree – they fly past too far from the charge – and yet particles that do pass very close to the centre scatter through large angles.

===Maximum nuclear size estimate===
Rutherford begins his analysis by considering a head-on collision between the alpha particle and atom. This will establish the minimum distance between them, a value which will be used throughout his calculations.

Assuming there are no external forces and that initially the alpha particles are far from the nucleus, the inverse-square law between the charges on the alpha particle and nucleus gives the potential energy gained by the particle as it approaches the nucleus. For head-on collisions between alpha particles and the nucleus, all the kinetic energy of the alpha particle is turned into potential energy and the particle stops and turns back. 
Where the particle stops at a distance formula_1 from the centre, the potential energy matches the original kinetic energy:

formula_2

where

formula_3

Rearranging: 
formula_4

For an alpha particle:
* (mass) = = 
* (for the alpha particle) = 2 × = 
* (for gold) = 79 × = 
* (initial velocity) = (for this example)
The distance from the alpha particle to the centre of the nucleus () at this point is an upper limit for the nuclear radius.
Substituting these in gives the value of about , or 27 fm. (The true radius is about 7.3 fm.) The true radius of the nucleus is not recovered in these experiments because the alphas do not have enough energy to penetrate to more than 27 fm of the nuclear centre, as noted, when the actual radius of gold is 7.3 fm.

Rutherford&#x27;s 1911 paper started with a slightly different formula suitable for head-on collision with a sphere of positive charge:

formula_5

In Rutherford&#x27;s notation, &quot;e&quot; is the elementary charge, &quot;N&quot; is the charge number of the nucleus (now also known as the atomic number), and &quot;E&quot; is the charge of an alpha particle. The convention in Rutherford&#x27;s time was to measure charge in electrostatic units, distance in centimeters, force in dynes, and energy in ergs. The modern convention is to measure charge in coulombs, distance in meters, force in newtons, and energy in joules. Using coulombs requires using the Coulomb constant (&quot;k&quot;) in the equation. Rutherford used &quot;b&quot; as the turning point distance (called &quot;r&quot;min above) and &quot;R&quot; is the radius of the atom. The first term is the Coulomb repulsion used above. This form assumes the alpha particle could penetrate the positive charge. At the time of Rutherford&#x27;s paper, Thomson&#x27;s plum pudding model proposed a positive charge with the radius of an atom, thousands of times larger than the &quot;r&quot;min found above. Figure 1 shows how concentrated this potential is compared to the size of the atom.
Many of Rutherford&#x27;s results are expressed in terms of this turning point distance &quot;r&quot;min, simplifying the results and limiting the need for units to this calculation of turning point.
===Single scattering by a heavy nucleus ===
From his results for a head on collision, Rutherford knows that alpha particle scattering occurs close to the centre of an atom, at a radius 10,000 times smaller than the atom. The electrons have negligible effect. He begins by assuming no energy loss in the collision, that is he ignores the recoil of the target atom. He will revisit each of these issues later in his paper.
Under these conditions, the alpha particle and atom interact through a central force, a physical problem studied first by Isaac Newton. 
A central force only acts along a line between the particles and when the force varies with the inverse square, like Coulomb force in this case, a detailed theory was developed under the name of the Kepler problem. The well-known solutions to the Kepler problem are called orbits and unbound orbits are hyperbolas.
Thus Rutherford proposed that the alpha particle will take a hyperbolic trajectory in the repulsive force near the centre of the atom as shown in Figure 2.

To apply the hyperbolic trajectory solutions to the alpha particle problem, Rutherford expresses the parameters of the hyperbola in terms of the scattering geometry and energies. He starts with conservation of angular momentum. When the particle of mass formula_6 and initial velocity formula_7 is far from the atom, its angular momentum around the centre of the atom will be formula_8 where formula_9 is the impact parameter, which is the lateral distance between the alpha particle&#x27;s path and the atom. At the point of closest approach, labeled A in Figure 2, the angular momentum will be formula_10. Therefore

formula_11

formula_12

Rutherford also applies the law of conservation of energy between the same two points:

formula_13

The left hand side and the first term on the right hand side are the kinetic energies of the particle at the two points; the last term is the potential energy due to the Coulomb force between the alpha particle and atom at the point of closest approach (A). &quot;q&quot;a is the charge of the alpha particle, &quot;q&quot;g is the charge of the nucleus, and &quot;k&quot; is the Coulomb constant.

The energy equation can then be rearranged thus:

formula_14

For convenience, the non-geometric physical variables in this equation can be contained in a variable formula_15, which is the point of closest approach in a head-on collision scenario which was explored in a previous section of this article:

formula_16

This allows Rutherford simplify the energy equation to:

formula_17

This leaves two simultaneous equations for formula_18, the first derived from the conservation of momentum equation and the second from the conservation of energy equation. Eliminating formula_19 and formula_7 gives at a new formula for formula_15:

formula_22

formula_23

The next step is to find a formula for formula_24. From Figure 2, formula_25 is the sum of two distances related to the hyperbola, SO and OA. Using the following logic, these distances can be expressed in terms of angle formula_26 and impact parameter formula_9.
The eccentricity of a hyperbola is a value that describes the hyperbola&#x27;s shape. It can be calculated by dividing the focal distance by the length of the semi-major axis, which per Figure 2 is . As can be seen in Figure 3, the eccentricity is also equal to formula_28, where formula_26 is the angle between the major axis and the asymptote. Therefore:

formula_30

As can be deduced from Figure 2, the focal distance SO is

formula_31

and therefore

formula_32

With these formulas for SO and OA, the distance formula_24 can be written in terms of formula_26 and simplified using a trigonometric identity known as a half-angle formula:

formula_35

formula_36

formula_37

Applying a trigonometric identity known as the cotangent double angle formula and the previous equation for formula_24 gives a simpler relationship between the physical and geometric variables:

formula_23

formula_40

formula_41

formula_42

The scattering angle of the particle is formula_43 and therefore formula_44. With the help of a trigonometric identity known as a reflection formula, the relationship between &quot;θ&quot; and &quot;b&quot; can be resolved to:

formula_45

formula_46

formula_47

which can be rearranged to give

formula_48
Rutherford gives some illustrative values as shown in this table:
Rutherford&#x27;s approach to this scattering problem remains a standard treatment in textbooks on classical mechanics.
===Intensity vs angle===

To compare to experiments the relationship between impact parameter and scattering angle needs to be converted to probability versus angle. The scattering cross section gives the relative intensity by angles:
formula_49

In classical mechanics, the scattering angle formula_50 is uniquely determined the initial kinetic energy of the incoming particles and the impact parameter . Therefore, the number of particles scattered into an angle between formula_50 and formula_52 must be the same as the number of particles with associated impact parameters between and . For an incident intensity , this implies:

formula_53 

Thus the cross section depends on scattering angle as:

formula_54 

Using the impact parameter as a function of angle, , from the single scattering result above produces the Rutherford scattering cross section:
formula_55

*&quot;s&quot; = the number of alpha particles falling on unit area at an angle of deflection &quot;Φ&quot;
*&quot;r&quot; = distance from point of incidence of α rays on scattering material
*&quot;X&quot; = total number of particles falling on the scattering material
*&quot;n&quot; = number of atoms in a unit volume of the material
*&quot;t&quot; = thickness of the foil
*&quot;q&quot;n = positive charge of the atomic nucleus
*&quot;q&quot;a = positive charge of the alpha particles
*&quot;m&quot; = mass of an alpha particle
*&quot;v&quot; = velocity of the alpha particle
This formula predicted the results that Geiger measured in the coming year. The scattering probability into small angles greatly exceeds the probability in to larger angles, reflecting the tiny nucleus surrounded by empty space. However, for rare close encounters, large angle scattering occurs with just a single target.

At the end of his development of the cross section formula, Rutherford emphasises that the results apply to single scattering and thus require measurements with thin foils. For thin foils the degree of scattering is proportional to the foil thickness in agreement with Geiger&#x27;s measurements.

=== Comparison to JJ Thomson&#x27;s results ===

At the time of Rutherford&#x27;s paper, JJ Thomson was the &quot;undisputed world master in the design of atoms&quot;. Rutherford needed to compare his new approach to Thomson&#x27;s. Thomson&#x27;s model, presented in 1910, modelled the electron collisions with hyperbolic orbits from his 1906 paper combined with a factor for the positive sphere. Multiple resulting small deflections compounded using a random walk.

In his paper Rutherford emphasised that single scattering alone could account for Thomson&#x27;s results if the positive charge were concentrated in the centre.
Rutherford computes the probability of single scattering from a compact charge and demonstrates that it is 3 times larger than Thomson&#x27;s multiple scattering probability. Rutherford completes his analysis including the effects of density and foil thickness, then concludes that thin foils are governed by single scattering, not multiple scattering.

Later analysis showed Thomson&#x27;s scattering model could not account for large scattering.
The maximum angular deflection from electron scattering or from the positive sphere each come to less than 0.02°; even many such scattering events compounded would result in less than a one degree average deflection and a probability of scattering through 90° of less than one in 103500.

=== Target recoil ===
Rutherford&#x27;s analysis assumed that alpha particle trajectories turned at the centre of the atom but the exit velocity was not reduced. This is equivalent to assuming that the concentrated charge at the centre had infinite mass or was anchored in place. Rutherford discusses the limitations of this assumption by comparing scattering from lighter atoms like aluminium with heavier atoms like gold. If the concentrated charge is lighter it will recoil from the interaction, gaining momentum while the alpha particle loses momentum and consequently slows down.

Modern treatments analyze this type of Coulomb scattering in the centre of mass reference frame. The six coordinates of the two particles (also called &quot;bodies&quot;) are converted into three relative coordinates between the two particles and three centre-of-mass coordinates moving in space (called the lab frame). The interaction only occurs in the relative coordinates, giving an equivalent one-body problem just as Rutherford solved, but with different interpretations for the mass and scattering angle.

Rather than the mass of the alpha particle, the more accurate formula including recoil uses reduced mass:

formula_56 

For Rutherford&#x27;s alpha particle scattering from gold, with mass of 197, the reduced mass is very close to the mass of the alpha particle:

formula_57

For lighter aluminium, with mass 27, the effect is greater:

formula_58

a 13% difference in mass. Rutherford notes this difference and suggests experiments be performed with lighter atoms.

The second effect is a change in scattering angle. The angle in the relative coordinate system or centre of mass frame needs to be converted to an angle in the lab frame. In the lab frame, denoted by a subscript L, the scattering angle for a general central potential is

formula_59 

For a heavy particle like gold used by Rutherford, the factor formula_60 can be neglected at almost all angles. Then the lab and relative angles are the same, formula_61.

The change in scattering angle alters the formula for differential cross-section needed for comparison to experiment. In general the calculation is complex. For the case of alpha-particle scattering from gold atoms, this effect on the cross section is quite small.

== Limitations to Rutherford&#x27;s scattering formula ==

=== Very light nuclei and higher energies ===
In 1919 Rutherford analyzed alpha particle scattering from hydrogen atoms, showing the limits of the 1911 formula even with corrections for reduced mass. Similar issues with smaller deviations for helium, magnesium, aluminium led to the conclusion that the alpha particle was penetrating the nucleus in these cases. This allowed the first estimates of the size of atomic nuclei. Later experiments based on cyclotron acceleration of alpha particles striking heavier nuclei provided data for analysis of interaction between the alpha particle and the nuclear surface. However at energies that push the alpha particles deeper they are strongly absorbed by the nuclei, a more complex interaction.

=== Quantum mechanics ===
Rutherford&#x27;s treatment of alpha particle scattering seems to rely on classical mechanics and yet the particles are of sub-atomic dimensions. However the critical aspects of the theory ultimately rely on conservation of momentum and energy. These concepts apply equally in classical and quantum regimes: the scattering ideas developed by Rutherford apply to subatomic elastic scattering problems like neutron-proton scattering.

== An alternative method to find the scattering angle ==
This section presents an alternative method to find the relation between the impact parameter and deflection angle in a single-atom encounter, using a force-centric approach as opposed to the energy-centric one that Rutherford used.

The scattering geometry is shown in this diagram

The impact parameter &quot;b&quot; is the distance between the alpha particle&#x27;s initial trajectory and a parallel line that goes through the nucleus. Smaller values of &quot;b&quot; bring the particle closer to the atom so it feels more deflection force resulting in a larger deflection angle &quot;θ&quot;. The goal is to find the relationship between &quot;b&quot; and the deflection angle.

The alpha particle&#x27;s path is a hyperbola and the net change in momentum formula_62 runs along the axis of symmetry. From the geometry in the diagram and the magnitude of the initial and final momentum vectors, formula_63, the magnitude of formula_62 can be related to the deflection angle:

formula_65

A second formula for formula_66 involving &quot;b&quot; will give the relationship to the deflection angle. 
The net change in momentum can also be found by adding small increments to momentum all along the trajectory using the integral

formula_67

where formula_68 is the distance between the alpha particle and the centre of the nucleus and formula_69 is its angle from the axis of symmetry. These two are the polar coordinates of the alpha particle at time formula_70. &quot;q&quot;a is the charge of the alpha particle, &quot;q&quot;g is the charge of the atomic nucleus, and &quot;k&quot; is the Coulomb constant. The Coulomb force exerted along the line between the alpha particle and the atom is formula_71 and the factor formula_72 gives that part of the force causing deflection.

The polar coordinates &quot;r&quot; and &quot;φ&quot; depend on &quot;t&quot; in the integral, but they must be related to each other as they both vary as the particle moves. Changing the variable and limits of integration from &quot;t&quot; to &quot;φ&quot; makes this connection explicit:

formula_73

The factor formula_74 is the reciprocal of the angular velocity the particle. Since the force is only along the line between the particle and the atom, the angular momentum, which is proportional to the angular velocity, is constant:

formula_75

This law of conservation of angular momentum gives a formula for formula_76:

formula_77

Replacing formula_76 in the integral for Δ&quot;P&quot; simultaneously eliminates the dependence on &quot;r&quot;:

formula_79

formula_80

Applying the trigonometric identities formula_81 and formula_82 to simplify this result gives the second formula for formula_66:

formula_84

We now have two equations for formula_66, which we can solve for &quot;θ&quot;:

formula_86

formula_87

Using the following values, we will examine an example where an alpha particle passes through a gold atom:

* &quot;q&quot;g = positive charge of the gold atom = = 
* &quot;q&quot;a = charge of the alpha particle = = 
* &quot;v&quot; = speed of the alpha particle = 
* &quot;m&quot; = mass of the alpha particle = 
* &quot;k&quot; = Coulomb constant = 

When the alpha particle passes close to the nucleus barely missing it, such that the impact parameter &quot;b&quot; is equal to the radius of a gold nucleus (), the estimated deflection angle &quot;θ&quot; will be 2.56 radians (147°). If the alpha particle grazes the edge of the atom, with &quot;b&quot; therefore being equal to , the estimated deflection is a tiny 0.0003 radians (0.02°).

==Why the plum pudding model was wrong==
J. J. Thomson himself didn&#x27;t study alpha particle scattering, but he did study beta particle scattering. In his 1910 paper &quot;On the Scattering of rapidly moving Electrified Particles&quot;, Thomson presented several equations that modelled how beta particles scatter in a collision with an atom per the plum pudding model.

The average partial deflection caused by the atomic electrons on an incoming beta particle is

formula_88

and the average partial deflection caused by the positive sphere is

formula_89

where &quot;q&quot;e is the elementary charge, &quot;q&quot;g is the positive charge of the atom, &quot;m&quot; and &quot;v&quot; are the mass and velocity of the incoming particle, &quot;N&quot; is the number of electrons in the atom, and &quot;R&quot; is the radius of the atom.

The net deflection is given by

formula_90

Thomson did not explain how he developed these equations, but this section will provide an educated guess. At the same time, it will adapt these equations to alpha particle scattering, on the assumption that alpha particles are point charges much like beta particles. These equations will then be used to show that Thomson&#x27;s model was inconsistent with the experimental results of Rutherford and his colleagues.

===Deflection by the positive sphere===
Consider an alpha particle passing by a sphere of pure positive charge (no electrons) with a radius &quot;R&quot;. The sphere is so much heavier than the alpha particle that we do not account for recoil. Its position is fixed. The alpha particle passes just close enough to graze the edge of the sphere, which is where the electric field of the sphere is strongest.

An earlier section of this article presented an equation which models how an incoming charged particle is deflected by another charged particle at a fixed position (ie infinite mass).

formula_91

This equation can be used to calculate the deflection angle in the special case in Figure 4 by setting the impact parameter &quot;b&quot; to the same value as the radius of the sphere &quot;R&quot;. So long as the alpha particle does not penetrate the sphere, there is no difference between a sphere of charge and a point charge, a mathematical result known as the Shell theorem.

* &quot;q&quot;g = positive charge of the gold atom = = 
* &quot;q&quot;a = charge of the alpha particle = = 
* &quot;R&quot; = radius of the gold atom = 
* &quot;v&quot; = speed of the alpha particle = 
* &quot;m&quot; = mass of the alpha particle = 
* &quot;k&quot; = Coulomb constant = 

formula_92

This shows that the largest possible deflection will be very small, to the point that the path of the alpha particle passing through the positive sphere of a gold atom is almost a straight line. Therefore in computing the average deflection, which will be smaller still, we will treat the particle&#x27;s path through the sphere as a chord of length &quot;L&quot;.

Inside a sphere of uniformly distributed positive charge, the force exerted on the alpha particle at any point along its path through the sphere is

formula_93

The lateral component of this force is

formula_94

The lateral change in momentum &quot;p&quot;y is therefore

formula_95

The deflection angle formula_96 is given by

formula_97

where &quot;p&quot;x is the average horizontal momentum, which is first reduced then restored as horizontal force changes direction as the alpha particle goes across the sphere. Since the deflection is very small, formula_98 can be treated as equal to formula_96. The chord length formula_100, per Pythagorean theorem.

The average deflection angle formula_101 sums the angle for values of &quot;b&quot; and &quot;L&quot; across the entire sphere and divides by the cross-section of the sphere:

formula_102

formula_103

This matches Thomson&#x27;s formula in his 1910 paper.

===Deflection by the electrons===
Consider an alpha particle passing through an atom of radius &quot;R&quot; along a path of length &quot;L&quot;. The effect of the positive sphere is ignored so as to isolate the effect of the atomic electrons. As with the positive sphere, deflection by the electrons is expected to be very small, to the point that the path is practically a straight line.

For the electrons within an arbitrary distance &quot;s&quot; of the alpha particle&#x27;s path, their mean distance will be &quot;s&quot;. Therefore, the average deflection per electron will be

formula_104

where &quot;q&quot;e is the elementary charge. The average net deflection by all the electrons within this arbitrary cylinder of effect around the alpha particle&#x27;s path is

formula_105

where &quot;N&quot;0 is the number of electrons per unit volume and formula_106 is the volume of this cylinder.

Treating &quot;L&quot; as a straight line, formula_107 where &quot;b&quot; is the distance of this line from the centre. The mean of formula_108 is therefore

formula_109

To obtain the mean deflection formula_110, replace formula_108 in the equation for formula_112:

formula_113

formula_114

where &quot;N&quot; is the number of electrons in the atom, equal to formula_115.

===Cumulative effect===
Applying Thomson&#x27;s equations described above to an alpha particle colliding with a gold atom, using the following values:

* &quot;qg&quot; = positive charge of the gold atom = = 
* &quot;qa&quot; = charge of the alpha particle = = 
* &quot;qe&quot; = elementary charge = 
* &quot;R&quot; = radius of the gold atom = 
* &quot;v&quot; = speed of the alpha particle = 
* &quot;m&quot; = mass of the alpha particle = 
* &quot;k&quot; = Coulomb constant = 
* &quot;N&quot; = number of electrons in the gold atom = 79

gives the average partial angle by which the alpha particle should be deflected by the atomic electrons as:

formula_116

and the average partial deflection caused by the positive sphere is:

formula_117

The net deflection for a single atomic collision is:

formula_118

On average the positive sphere and the electrons alike provide very little deflection in a single collision. Thomson&#x27;s model combined many single-scattering events from the atom&#x27;s electrons and a positive sphere. Each collision may increase or decrease the total scattering angle. Only very rarely would a series of collisions all line up in the same direction. The result is similar to the standard statistical problem called a random walk. If the average deflection angle of the alpha particle in a single collision with an atom is formula_119, then the average deflection after &quot;n&quot; collisions is

formula_120

The probability that an alpha particle will be deflected by a total of more than 90° after &quot;n&quot; deflections is given by:

formula_121

where &quot;e&quot; is Euler&#x27;s number (≈2.71828...). A gold foil with a thickness of 1.5 micrometers would be about 10,000 atoms thick. If the average deflection per atom is 0.008°, the average deflection after 10,000 collisions would be 0.8°. The probability of an alpha particle being deflected by more than 90° will be

formula_122

While in Thomson&#x27;s plum pudding model it is mathematically possible that an alpha particle could be deflected by more than 90° after 10,000 collisions, the probability of such an event is so low as to be undetectable. Geiger and Marsden should not have detected any alpha particles coming back in the experiment they performed in 1909, and yet they did.

==Notes on historical measurements==
Rutherford assumed that the radius of atoms in general to be on the order of 10−10 m and the positive charge of a gold atom to be about 100 times that of hydrogen (). The atomic weight of gold was known to be around 197 since early in the 19th century. From an experiment in 1906, Rutherford measured alpha particles to have a charge of and an atomic weight of 4, and alpha particles emitted by radon to have velocity of . Rutherford deduced that alpha particles are essentially helium atoms stripped of two electrons, but at the time scientists only had a rough idea of how many electrons atoms have and so the alpha particle was thought to have up to 10 electrons left. In 1906, J. J. Thomson measured the elementary charge to be about (). In 1909 Robert A. Millikan provided a more accurate measurement of , only 0.6% off the current accepted measurement. Jean Perrin in 1909 measured the mass of the hydrogen atom to be , and if an alpha particle is four times as heavy as that, it would have an absolute mass of .

The convention in Rutherford&#x27;s time was to measure charge in electrostatic units, distance in centimeters, force in dynes, and energy in ergs. The modern convention is to measure charge in coulombs, distance in meters, force in newtons, and energy in joules. Using coulombs requires using the Coulomb constant in certain equations. In this article, Rutherford and Thomson&#x27;s equations have been rewritten to fit modern notation conventions.

<text>James Merrill Jeffords (May 11, 1934 – August 18, 2014) was an American lawyer and politician who served as a U.S. senator from Vermont. Sworn into the Senate in 1989, he served as a Republican until 2001, when he left the party to become an independent and began caucusing with the Democrats. Jeffords retired from the Senate in 2007. Prior to serving in the Senate, he served as the U.S. representative for from 1975 to 1989.

The son of Olin M. Jeffords, who served as Chief Justice of the Vermont Supreme Court, James Jeffords was born in Rutland, Vermont. He graduated from Yale University, served for three years in the United States Navy, and then attended Harvard Law School, from which he received his degree in 1962. Jeffords practiced law in southern Vermont and became a resident of Shrewsbury, where he was active in local politics and government as a Republican, including serving as chairman of the town&#x27;s Republican committee. He served one term in the Vermont Senate (1967–1969), and two as Attorney General of Vermont (1969–1973). He lost the 1972 Republican primary for Governor of Vermont, but won the election for Vermont&#x27;s lone seat in the United States House of Representatives in 1974. He served in the House from 1975 to 1989; in 1988 he was the successful Republican nominee for the United States Senate seat held by the retiring Robert Stafford.

Jeffords served in the Senate from 1989 until 2007, winning reelection in 1994 and 2000. In 2001, he left the Republican Party to become an independent, and began to caucus with the Senate&#x27;s Democrats. His switch changed control of the Senate from Republican to Democratic, the first time a switch had ever changed party control. During his Senate career, Jeffords served as chairman of the Public Works and Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committees.

Jeffords did not run for reelection in 2006 and retired at the end of his term. He was succeeded by Bernie Sanders. Jeffords retired to Shrewsbury in 2007. After the death of his wife, he moved to the Washington, D.C. area to live closer to his children. He died in 2014 from complications associated with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, and was buried in Shrewsbury.

==Background==
Jeffords was born in Rutland, Vermont, the son of Marion (née Hausman) and Olin Merrill Jeffords, who served as Chief Justice of the Vermont Supreme Court. According to Jeffords, his mother was a relative of French architect Georges-Eugène Haussmann. Jeffords attended the public schools of Rutland, and graduated from Rutland High School in 1952. He received a Bachelor of Science degree in industrial administration from Yale University in 1956.

Jeffords was a member of the Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps in college, and after graduating he received his commission in the United States Navy. He then received training as a surface warfare officer, followed by assignment to USS &quot;McNair&quot;. He served for three years, and was aboard &quot;McNair&quot; when it became the first ship to enter the Suez Canal following the 1956 Suez Crisis. He was also aboard &quot;McNair&quot; as it took part in the U.S. response to the 1958 Lebanon crisis. After completing his active duty obligation, Jeffords served in the United States Navy Reserve until retiring as a captain in 1990.

After leaving active duty, Jeffords attended Harvard Law School, from which he graduated in 1962. During 1962 and 1963 he was a law clerk for Ernest W. Gibson Jr., Judge of the United States District Court for the District of Vermont. A longtime resident of Shrewsbury, Jeffords practiced law in Rutland and became active in politics and government as a Republican. In the 1960s, he served as Shrewsbury&#x27;s Grand Juror, Town Agent and Zoning Administrator, in addition to serving as chairman of the town&#x27;s Republican committee. He also served as Rutland County&#x27;s chairman of the Board of Property Tax Appeals.

Jeffords married Elizabeth &quot;Liz&quot; Daley twice, first in 1961, which ended with a June 1978 divorce. On August 26, 1986, they married again. Liz Jeffords died on the morning of April 13, 2007, after a long struggle with ovarian cancer. Jeffords and his wife had two children, Leonard and Laura, both of whom live and work in the Washington, D.C., area. After his wife&#x27;s death, Jeffords resided in Washington, D.C., a move he made in order to live near his son and daughter.

==Political career==
===Early career===
Jeffords won a seat in the Vermont Senate in 1966. During his 1967 to 1969 term, Jeffords served on the General and Judiciary Committees. He followed that success in 1968 with a victory in the race for Attorney General of Vermont. He was a presidential elector for Vermont in 1972, and voted for reelection of the Nixon–Agnew ticket.

Jeffords sought the Republican Party nomination for governor in 1972, but was defeated in the primary by Luther &quot;Fred&quot; Hackett.

===Congressman===
In 1974, after winning the Republican nomination with a plurality in a three-way race, he won Vermont&#x27;s sole seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, where he served for 14 years. Jeffords was a member of the Agriculture and Education and Labor Committees, and rose through seniority to become the ranking Republican on Education and Labor. Jeffords was the only Republican to vote against the Ronald Reagan tax cuts of 1981, and was a supporter of both abortion rights and expanded protections for the rights of gays and lesbians. In addition, he was recognized as a moderate-to-liberal Republican because of his pro-environment positions and his support for the National Endowment for the Arts.

Jeffords endorsed fellow moderate Republican John B. Anderson in his campaign for the 1980 Republican Party presidential primaries.

===U.S. Senator===
In 1988, Jeffords was elected to the U.S. Senate, and was reelected in 1994 and 2000.

Jeffords long favored expanded access to health care, and supported the plan offered by Bill Clinton in the early 1990s. In February 1998, after David Satcher was confirmed by the Senate for U.S. Surgeon General, President Clinton issued a statement thanking Jeffords and several other senators &quot;for their strong support for this extremely qualified nominee.&quot;

He was one of only five Republican senators who voted to acquit Clinton after Clinton was impeached by the U.S. House in 1999. In October 1999, Jeffords was one of four Republicans to vote in favor of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. The treaty was designed to ban underground nuclear testing and was the first major international security pact to be defeated in the Senate since the Treaty of Versailles.

Jeffords&#x27; work in Congress focused on legislation involving education, job training and individuals with disabilities. In his later years in the Senate, his emphasis shifted somewhat, as he pushed through Congress several important pieces of environmental legislations. He was, together with Paul Simon, credited by Canadian Lieutenant-General Roméo Dallaire, Force Commander of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR) from 1993 to 1994, for actively lobbying the U.S. administration into mounting a humanitarian mission to Rwanda during the Rwandan genocide. According to Dallaire&#x27;s book, &quot;Shake Hands with the Devil&quot;, he &quot;owe(s) a great debt of gratitude&quot; to both senators.

Jeffords was one of the founders of the Congressional Solar Coalition and the Congressional Arts Caucus. Jeffords was frequently recognized for his performance as a legislator, receiving &quot;Parenting&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Legislator of the Year&quot; award in 1999, and the Sierra Club&#x27;s highest commendation, the John Muir Award in 2002.

During part of his tenure in the Senate, Jeffords sat at the Candy Desk.

==Departure from the Republican Party==
On May 24, 2001, Jeffords left the Republican Party, with which he had always been affiliated, and became an independent. Jeffords discussed this decision: &quot;I will make this change and will caucus with the Democrats for organizational purposes once the conference report on the tax bill is sent to the president. I gave my word to the president that I would not intercept or try to intervene in the signing of that bill.&quot; Jeffords&#x27; opposition to the policies of the George W. Bush administration, including concerns over the size of the Bush tax cuts, motivated his party switch. Jeffords&#x27; switch was also motivated by the refusal of Senate Republicans to fully fund the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, stating, &quot;Increasingly, I find myself in disagreement with my party... I understand that many people are more conservative than I am and they form the Republican Party. Given the changing nature of the national party, it has become a struggle for our leaders to deal with me and for me to deal with them.&quot;

The 2000 Senate elections had left the Senate with a 50–50 split in partisan control, forcing Democrats and Republicans to negotiate an unusual power-sharing arrangement (although Republican Vice President Dick Cheney could break tie votes). Following the election, Democrats sought out a Republican to defect from the Republican caucus, which would give Democrats control of the chamber. Democratic whip Harry Reid courted Jeffords, Lincoln Chafee, and John McCain as potential party-switchers. After being promised the chairmanship of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee to offset his loss of a committee chairmanship under Republican control, Jeffords decided to change parties, and gave up the chairmanship of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, which he had held since 1997. Jeffords&#x27;s switch gave Democrats control of a chamber of Congress for the first time since the 1994 elections, and Jeffords is the only senator in history to tip the balance of power in the Senate by switching parties. However, the effects were not long-lasting: 18 months later, after 2002 midterms, the Senate switched back to a Republican majority.

Jeffords agreed to vote with the Democrats on all procedural matters except with permission of Democratic Whip, Harry Reid. In return, Jeffords retained his seniority and received the committee seats that would have been available to him had he been a Democrat during his entire Senate tenure. He was free to vote as he pleased on policy matters, but more often than not voted with the Democrats.

Jeffords&#x27; party switch made him only the second Senator from Vermont to caucus with the Democrats. The seat that Jeffords occupied had been held by a Republican from 1857, when Solomon Foot joined the new party, until Jeffords became an Independent in 2001.

==Senate record==
Even before switching parties, Jeffords&#x27; voting record was moderate-to-liberal, which was typical of Republicans affiliated with Vermont&#x27;s Aiken–Gibson wing. (The Aiken–Gibson wing of the Vermont Republican Party were those party activists and office holders identified with progressive policies. The party&#x27;s conservatives comprised a pro-business wing, which was led by the Proctor, Fairbanks, and Smith families. In addition to Aiken and Gibson, other members of their wing of the party in the 1950s and 1960s included Jeffords and Robert Stafford. Members of the party&#x27;s conservative wing included Harold J. Arthur, Lee E. Emerson, and Winston L. Prouty.)

By the time of his switch, no Republican Senator had a lower lifetime score from the American Conservative Union. In 1981, Jeffords was the only Republican member of the House to vote against a bill reducing the top tax rate from 70 per cent to 50 per cent—a hallmark of President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s legacy. During his time in the Senate, he voted for the Brady Bill, the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, an end to the ban on gays serving in the military, and against permanent normal trade relations with China and barring affirmative action at the federal level. Jeffords was also vocal in his opposition to the nomination of Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court of the United States by President George H. W. Bush. He was one of only two Republicans to vote against confirming Clarence Thomas. In 1993, he was the only prominent Republican to support President Clinton&#x27;s unsuccessful attempt to establish a national healthcare plan. Jeffords&#x27; voting record and positions on environmental issues put further distance between himself and his Republican Party colleagues.

Jeffords consistently voted against the ban on partial-birth abortion, and also against a harsher line on Cuba. In 1995, Jeffords was one of two Republican senators, the other being Bill Frist of Tennessee, to vote in favor of confirming Dr. Henry Foster as Surgeon General; the vote failed, and Foster&#x27;s confirmation was ultimately denied. In 1995 he was one of only 16 senators to vote against the Communications Decency Act. The Supreme Court later struck part of it down as unconstitutional. Jeffords advocated LGBT rights in the workplace. He sponsored The Employee Non Discrimination Act of 1995 (104th Congress), 1997 (105th Congress), and 1999 (106th Congress). Jeffords&#x27; non-discrimination bills did not include gender identity. He was in the minority of Republicans to oppose the Flag Desecration Amendment. On guns his record was mixed, despite voting for the Brady Bill and the Federal Assault Weapons Ban, he voted with gun control opponents against background checks at gun shows in 1999 and he voted with the majority of Congress for the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act. He took a more moderate line on the death penalty.

On many economic issues Jeffords was roughly in line with the majority of the Republican Party, before and after his switch: he mostly supported free-trade agreements, voted for making enforcement of consumer protection laws more difficult by moving many class-action lawsuits into federal courts, tighter bankruptcy rules and a balanced budget amendment. Even after becoming an independent, he did vote with Republicans on many major pieces of legislation. For example, Jeffords did vote against the Bipartisan Patient Protection Act, a bill supported strongly by Republican John McCain and many moderate Republicans like Olympia Snowe, Arlen Specter and Mike DeWine. Two years later he voted for the prescription drug bill, derided by many Democrats as a give away to drug companies and opposed by many conservative Republicans who opposed further federal spending, but ultimately strongly supported by President George W. Bush, and the vast majority of the Republican Party.

On October 11, 2002, Jeffords was one of 23 senators to vote against authorizing the use of military force in Iraq. Shortly after that, he was one of only nine senators to vote against the bill establishing the United States Department of Homeland Security. On November 11, 2003, Jeffords was one of only four senators to vote against the Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act, a bill that received strong support from politicians from across the aisle.

==Retirement and death==
In April 2005, the 70-year-old Jeffords decided not to run for re-election in 2006 citing health issues. Jeffords said his wife&#x27;s cancer and his own growing health concerns caused him to decide it was time to retire. On September 27, 2006, Jeffords delivered his farewell speech on the Senate floor. Floor speeches by and in tribute to retiring senators are a Senate tradition, but only one Republican senator, Chuck Grassley of Iowa, spoke on the floor in praise of Jeffords. After his retirement, Jeffords was succeeded in the U.S. Senate by Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with the Democratic Party.

Jeffords died of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease on August 18, 2014, at Knollwood, a military retirement facility in Washington, D.C., where he had lived for eight years. He was 80 years old. He was buried at Northam Cemetery in North Shrewsbury.

<text>In the United Kingdom, there are several Secretaries to the Treasury, who are Treasury ministers nominally acting as secretaries to HM Treasury. The origins of the office are unclear, although it probably originated during Lord Burghley&#x27;s tenure as Lord Treasurer in the 16th century. The number of secretaries was expanded to two by 1714 at the latest. The Treasury ministers together discharge all the former functions of the Lord Treasurer, which are nowadays nominally vested in the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury. Of the Commissioners, only the Second Lord of the Treasury, who is also the Chancellor of the Exchequer, is a Treasury minister (the others are the Prime Minister and the government whips).

The Chancellor is the senior Treasury minister, followed by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, who also attends Cabinet and has particular responsibilities for public expenditure. In order of seniority, the junior Treasury ministers are: the Financial Secretary to the Treasury, the Economic Secretary to the Treasury, the Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury, and the Commercial Secretary to the Treasury (currently not in use).

One of the present-day secretaries, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury, formerly known as the &quot;Patronage Secretary&quot;, is not a Treasury minister but the government whip in the House of Commons. The office can be seen as a sinecure, allowing the Chief Whip to draw a government salary, attend Cabinet, and use a Downing Street residence.

<doc id="319847" wikidata="Q812906" url="?curid=319847" title="Beaconsfield">
<text>Beaconsfield ( ) is a market town and civil parish in Buckinghamshire, England, northwest of central London and southeast of Aylesbury. Three other towns are within : Gerrards Cross, Amersham and High Wycombe.

The town is adjacent to the Chiltern Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and has Georgian, neo-Georgian and Tudor revival high street architecture, known as the Old Town. It is known for the first model village in the world and the National Film and Television School.

Beaconsfield was Britain&#x27;s richest town (based on an average house price of £684,474) in 2008. In 2011, it had the highest proportion in the UK of £1 million-plus homes for sale (at 47%, compared to 3.5% nationally).

==History and description==
The parish comprises Beaconsfield town and land mainly given over arable land. Some beech forest remains to supply an established beech furniture industry in High Wycombe, the making of modal and various artisan uses.

Beaconsfield is recorded in property returns of 1185 where it is spelt Bekenesfeld, literally &quot;beechen field&quot; which would less archaically be read as &quot;clearing in the beeches&quot;. Nearby Burnham Beeches is a forest named after the beech genus. Although, it is often incorrectly contested that Beaconsfield derived its name from a street called Beacon Hill in neighbouring village, Penn, which was a lookout point and beacon originating in Saxon times. Local men were called to defend an island fort as the beacon was part of a chain from the naval base at Portsmouth via Butser Hill Hindhead, Hogsback and Windsor. 

The parish church at the crossroads of Old Beaconsfield is dedicated to St Mary, it was rebuilt of flint and bath stone by the Victorians in 1869. The United Reformed Church in Beaconsfield can trace its roots of non-conformist worship in the town back to 1704. Old Beaconsfield has a number of old coaching inns along a wide street of red brick houses and small shops. It was the first (coach) stopping point on the road between London and Oxford, as it is equidistant between the two places.

An annual charter fair is traditionally held on 10 May and has been held every year since 1269 celebrating its 750th year in 2019.

In the Victorian era the town was the home constituency of Benjamin Disraeli, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in 1868 and then again from 1874 until 1880 (in fact his home, Hughenden Manor is in the nearby town of High Wycombe). In 1876 he was made the 1st Earl of Beaconsfield by Queen Victoria with whom he was very popular. It was due to this that Beaconsfield became a popular road name in industrial cities across the country in the late Victorian era.

It is the burial place of the author G. K. Chesterton, Edmund Burke and the poet Edmund Waller, for whom a tall stone obelisk was erected over the tomb chest in St Mary and All Saints’ churchyard.

In 1624, Waller&#x27;s family acquired Wilton Manor and Hall Barn in the town. &quot;The Wallers, who came from Speldhurst, Kent,&quot; says the Victoria County history of Buckinghamshire, &quot;were settled at Beaconsfield as early as the 14th century.&quot;

Beaconsfield is the home of Bekonscot model village, which was the first model village in the world; and Beaconsfield Film Studios becoming the National Film and Television School, where many film directors (including Nick Park) and technicians have learned their craft. It is the birthplace of Terry Pratchett, author of the Discworld series of fantasy novels. Several scenes in &quot;Brief Encounter,&quot; a classic film about a woman in a dull middle class marriage who almost undertakes an affair, were filmed in the town: Station Parade served as Milford High Street and Boots on Burke&#x27;s Parade was where Alec runs into Laura. The exterior of the Royal Saracens Head Inn can be seen in the James Bond film &quot;Thunderball,&quot; and the interior shots for the pub in &quot;Hot Fuzz&quot; were filmed in the Royal Standard of England pub. The New Town also features in two other postwar colour films, John &amp; Julie and The Fast Lady. Many other parts of the town have been used in films due to the old film studio and nearby Pinewood Studios. More recently it has often been used as a &quot;location&quot; for the TV murder mystery series, &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot; and the &quot;Inspector Morse&quot; spinoff &quot;Lewis&quot;.

The New Town was built one mile further to the north, when the railway arrived, at the turn of the 20th century. The railway station is on the Chiltern Main Line out of Marylebone towards High Wycombe, after which it then branches to Aylesbury, and Birmingham Snow Hill. Old Beaconsfield which grew up on the Oxford Road in part to serve the coach traffic, is mirrored by New Beaconsfield which has grown up round the station.

Beaconsfield is also home to the Chiltern Shakespeare Company, which annually holds amateur performances of Shakespeare plays, Beaconsfield Theatre Group (over 60 years old), Beaconsfield Musical &amp; Operatic Society (over 100 years old) and to The Young Theatre (at Beaconsfield), a theatre company &quot;run by young people for young people&quot; and winners of the All British Festival of One Act Plays in 2004.

Local pop band The Hit Parade released their single &quot;On The Road To Beaconsfield&quot;, a celebration of Enid Blyton and her life in the town, in 1994.

==Sport and leisure==
* Beaconsfield Cricket Club play at Wilton Park.
* Beaconsfield Rugby Club play at Oak Lodge Meadow.
* Beaconsfield Town Football Club, a Non-League football club play at Holloways Park, Windsor Road, Beaconsfield, Bucks. HP9 2SE.

==Governance==
===Parliamentary constituencies===
The parish of Beaconsfield is within the parliamentary constituency of Beaconsfield (which also covers Marlow and other neighbourhoods) towards the south. There are also areas to the north of the town (particularly in the parish of Penn) which have Beaconsfield postal address, but fall within the Chesham and Amersham constituency. Joy Morrissey is the current MP for Beaconsfield constituency, which has its office in Beaconsfield town. She defeated fellow Conservative, Dominic Grieve QC, in the 2019 general election. Grieve, the former Attorney General, was first elected in 1997, and stood as an independent in the 2019 election having had the party whip removed.

As a young man, Tony Blair, later Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, stood as Labour&#x27;s candidate in the 1982 Beaconsfield by-election, but lost to the Conservative candidate, Tim Smith. Smith was later found to be involved with Neil Hamilton in the cash-for-questions affair which was the financial part of the Major ministry sleaze uncovered before the 1997 general election. This was the only election Tony Blair ever lost. 

Liam Fox was a GP in Beaconsfield before being elected to Parliament, though he represented a seat in Somerset.

===Local government===
There are two tiers of local government covering Beaconsfield, at parish (town) and unitary authority level: Beaconsfield Town Council and Buckinghamshire Council.

On Buckinghamshire Council, the town is represented by Councillors Anita Cranmer (Conservative Party), Jackson Ng (Conservative Party) and Alison Wheelhouse (Independent). All three are also sitting councillors of Beaconsfield Town Council.

The parish of Beaconsfield was made a local board district in 1850, which became Beaconsfield Urban District in 1894. Beaconsfield Urban District Council built itself Beaconsfield Town Hall on Penn Road in 1936 to serve as its headquarters. Beaconsfield Urban District was abolished in 1974, with the area merging with part of Eton Rural District to become Beaconsfield District, which (despite the name) chose to base itself at the old Eton Rural District Council&#x27;s offices in Slough rather than in Beaconsfield. Beaconsfield District Council renamed itself South Bucks District Council in 1980. The district council was abolished in 2020.

Beaconsfield Town Council was created in 1974 as a successor parish, covering the area of the abolished urban district. Beaconsfield Town Council is based at the urban district council&#x27;s old headquarters at Town Hall.

==Transport==
The M40 runs very close to the town with Junction 2 on the parish boundary and is 4 lanes wide in either direction (junctions 1a to 3). Junction 2 is home to Beaconsfield motorway services. Local roads include the A355 which connects Amersham and Slough via Beaconsfield. The A40 parallels the M40 from London to Oxford and for years was the main road between the two cities as its precursor. The B474 connects the town to Hazlemere.

Beaconsfield railway station provides services to Birmingham Snow Hill and Moor Street, Aylesbury, Oxford and London Marylebone. There are fast and slow services, the former currently reaching London in around twenty-five minutes. It has a car park for commuters who drive towards the capital along the M40.

==Twin town==
Beaconsfield has been twinned with Langres, France, since 1995.

==Education==
Buckinghamshire Council operates a selective secondary education system, rather than a comprehensive system. Pupils can take the 11+ test at the beginning of year 6, when they are age 10 or 11. Approximately 30% attain a score that makes them eligible to go to grammar schools, as well as to the county&#x27;s upper schools.
* Alfriston School is a special school for girls, with moderate learning difficulties, between the ages of 11 and 18.
* Beaconsfield High School is a high performing grammar school for girls between the ages of 11 and 18.
* The Beaconsfield School has a good performance rating and its sixth form students join together with Beaconsfield High to increase the courses available.
* Davenies School is a private preparatory day school for boys between ages 4 and 13, with facilities including: a sports field, swimming pool, astroturf and sports hall.
* High March School is a private preparatory day school for girls between the ages of 3 and 11 with a few boys in the Nursery.
* Butlers Court School is a primary school for girls and boys.
* St Mary&#x27;s and All Saints is a CofE primary school for girls and boys.

<text>The Treasurer of the Household is a member of the Royal Household of the Sovereign of the United Kingdom. The position is usually held by one of the government deputy Chief Whips in the House of Commons. The current holder of the office is Mark Tami MP.

The position had its origin in the office of Treasurer (or Keeper) of the Wardrobe and was ranked second after the Lord Steward. The office was often staffed by the promotion of the Comptroller of the Household. On occasion (e.g. 1488–1503) the office was vacant for a considerable period and its duties undertaken by the Cofferer of the Household. By the end of the 17th century the office of Treasurer was more or less a sinecure, and in the 18th and 19th centuries it was usually occupied by peers who were members of the Government. The Treasurer was automatically a member of the privy council. They were a member of the Board of Green Cloth until that was abolished by reform of local government licensing in 2004 under section 195 of the Licensing Act 2003. 

On state occasions, the Treasurer of the Household (in common with certain other senior officers of the Household) carries a white staff of office.

<doc id="319854" wikidata="Q2976308" url="?curid=319854" title="Bierton">
<text>Bierton is a village and civil parish in Buckinghamshire, England, about half a mile northeast of the town of Aylesbury. It is mainly a farming parish. Together with the hamlets of Broughton, Kingsbrook, Broughton Crossing and Burcott it historically formed the civil parish of Bierton with Broughton within Aylesbury Vale district and form part of the Aylesbury Urban Area, but in 2020 the parish was broken into three, with Bierton becoming its own parish.

==History==
A substantial Belgic settlement once occupied the site of the village with an extensive ditched enclosure. Excavations in 1979 detected four phases of occupation. The ditches were deliberately filled in the first century and little is visible today.

The village name was first recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Bortone&quot; and means &quot;farmstead near a stronghold&quot; in modern English. The development of Bierton as a village was hampered by its being a linear settlement along the last road leading from Aylesbury to have its toll gate removed. The extra costs involved in travelling northwards using this route deterred many merchants, who favoured the less costly route via Winslow and Buckingham. The village remained an important point on this alternative northward route however, due to the presence of a wagon pond. This was used to swell the wooden axles of carts, and was a popular watering spot for carthorses.

The Church of England parish church of Saint James the Great is largely 14th century.
At one time the village contained no fewer than seven public houses and porter houses. The stained glass door of the long since defunct &quot;Star&quot; can still be seen, as can that of the &quot;Eagle&quot; next door to the Jubilee Hall. The two remaining pubs are the historically significant Red Lion, and the Bell.

The Red Lion public house is a 16th-century inn, and was significant during the English Civil War. Bierton was a Royalist stronghold, opposed to its larger Parliamentarian neighbour of Aylesbury, and the Red Lion was host to many Cavalier Officers, and rumours have it to Charles I himself. A minor battle was fought northwest of the village towards Weedon.

==Chapels==
Bierton had two non-conformist chapels - a Methodist chapel and a Baptist chapel, now both closed and converted to other use.

A Baptist congregation was formed in Bierton and they met for worship at the chapel, originally called the school house, which was constructed in 1831 and enlarged in 1885. It was registered as a place of worship in 1864 as place for Baptists and Independents. The church became a Gospel Standard cause in 1981 and the last minister was sent to preach in the church in 1982. The chapel was closed for worship in 2002, after all the former members died, and it was eventually sold in 2006. The trust deeds were lodged with HM Land Registry and the property was later sold as a domestic dwelling.

The Methodist chapel is now also closed and was on the corner of the road to Broughton. It has an existing graveyeard behind it.

==Other activities==

The major industry of the village in times past was brickmaking. Sitting on large sub-strata of Bierton Complex blue clay, the resource was mined for several centuries, and the bricks were fired close to the quarry. Brick Kiln lane exists to this day, although the workings themselves are no longer active.

The clay pits are now quiet pools, known as The Ponds. They have been turned into a private carp and tench fishery, whose fishing plots are highly sought after.
A well close to the church of St James the Great is dedicated to St Osyth, a local Anglo-Saxon princess born at Quarrendon Palace. She was reputedly beheaded in the woodland at St Osyth Priory by the Danes after having earlier drowned in a stream and been revived by nuns; it was said that a spring sprung up in nuns&#x27; wood within the grounds of St Osyth Priory that is still in existence today. It is not known why the well at Bierton is dedicated to the saint, only that ancient Bierton was on the route along which her body was taken from the priory to her final resting place; it is said that they made a stop-off at Bierton and laid her body down at the well&#x27;s current location, which is why the well is dedicated to her.

==Present day==
Today, with Aylesbury growing, the village is at risk of becoming a suburb of the larger town. All that separates the two at present is a field of allotments about a hundred yards wide, owned by the Parish Council.

Bierton Church of England Combined School is a mixed voluntary controlled, Church of England primary school, which takes children between the ages of four and 11. The school has about 300 pupils.

Notable inhabitants of Bierton include architect Deborah Saunt of Channel 4 television&#x27;s series &quot;Grand Designs&quot;, playwright Robert Farquhar, BBC fashion commentator Jerry O&#x27;Sullivan, and the author and poet May Sinclair, who lived at The Gables in Burcott Lane for the last ten years of her life.

The nearest station to Bierton is Aylesbury, operated by Chiltern Railways. Buses that serve Bierton run between Aylesbury and Milton Keynes, operated by Arriva, and between Leighton Buzzard and Aylesbury run by Z&amp;S International.

<doc id="319856" wikidata="Q2264746" url="?curid=319856" title="Battle of Yavin">
<text>The Battle of Yavin takes place in the fictional universe of &quot;Star Wars&quot;. It pits the Galactic Empire against the Rebel Alliance around the gas giant planet Yavin and its fourth moon.

In a previous battle, the rebels managed to steal the plans for the Death Star, a gigantic Imperial battle station equipped with a laser capable of destroying planets. However, the Empire has discovered the location of the rebel base on Yavin 4 and intends to destroy it using its new weapon. The Death Star has a vulnerability that the rebels have discovered. When it is in orbit around Yavin, they send all their ships in a desperate attack to destroy it. This leads to battles with Imperial fighters commanded by Darth Vader. Using the Force, Luke Skywalker manages to reach the vulnerability and destroy the battle station without leaving any survivors, although Darth Vader flees and lives to fight another day.

For the Rebel Alliance, this battle is a victory. However, the rebels are forced to flee to settle elsewhere. Indeed, Darth Vader, who was not aboard the Death Star when it exploded, continues to hunt them down.

The Battle of Yavin is depicted in the film &quot;A New Hope&quot;. It is largely created using practical special effects. It serves as a reference point in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; chronology.

In addition to the film, it is represented in novelizations of the film in which it appears, as well as in several novels, video games, and comics.

== Universe ==

The Star Wars universe unfolds in a galaxy inhabited by humans and numerous extraterrestrial species. It is the stage for conflicts between Jedi knights and Sith lords, individuals sensitive to the Force, a mysterious energy field that grants them psychic abilities. The Jedi master the light side of the Force, a beneficial and defensive power, to maintain peace in the galaxy. The Sith, on the other hand, harness the dark side, a harmful and destructive power, for their personal use and to dominate the galaxy.

Since the acquisition of Lucasfilm by the Walt Disney Company, there are two Star Wars universes: &quot;Legends&quot; and &quot;Canon.&quot; They share the six original films and the television series &quot;The Clone Wars&quot;. The Legends universe additionally incorporates complementary stories presented in books, comics, TV movies, or games released before 2014. The Canon universe, on the other hand, encompasses the stories from the films and other materials released since 2014.

== Background ==
Several years before the Clone Wars, the Confederacy of Independent Systems begins developing a weapon capable of destroying entire planets: the Death Star. Following the war in 19 BBY (Before the Battle of Yavin), the Galactic Republic is reformed into an Empire, and Grand Moff Tarkin oversees the construction of the battle station until its completion nearly twenty years later. It is intended to quell any dissent against the Empire.

From the Empire&#x27;s inception, small groups rebel against its authority, including Saw Gerrera and his team, as well as the crew of the &quot;Ghost&quot;. Over time, some of these cells unite to form the Rebel Alliance.

== Prelude ==

=== Official Universe ===
Engineer Galen Erso, who participates in the design of the Death Star, embeds a flaw that can destroy the entire station. He manages to contact the rebel Saw Gerrera so that his daughter, Jyn Erso, can retrieve the station&#x27;s plans and destroy it. With the help of the Rebel Alliance, Jyn and her team, named Rogue One, infiltrate the Scarif base where the Imperial archives are located. A fierce battle ensues on the surface between the assault group and the forces on-site, and in space between the rebel fleet and the Imperial reinforcements led by the Sith Darth Vader. Jyn Erso succeeds in transmitting the Death Star plans to the orbiting ships, but the battle station fires its superlaser on the planet&#x27;s surface, leaving no survivors. The &quot;Tantive IV&quot; commanded by Princess Leia Organa receives the plans and escapes.

=== Legends Universe ===
On Toprawa, where the Death Star&#x27;s superlaser is under construction, a group of rebel spies manages to steal the plans for the battle station. They transmit them to the &quot;Tantive IV&quot;, which is orbiting the planet. However, it is pursued by Darth Vader&#x27;s Star Destroyer, forcing it to flee.

=== Common part ===
The &quot;Tantive IV&quot; is intercepted by Darth Vader&#x27;s Star Destroyer above Tatooine. Before being captured, Princess Leia Organa entrusts the Death Star plans to the droid R2-D2, who escapes aboard an escape pod accompanied by C-3PO. On the desert planet, the two droids are captured by Jawas who sell them to the farmer Owen Lars. He hands them over to his nephew Luke Skywalker, who discovers a message hidden by Leia Organa for the Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi. She asks him to aid the rebellion. R2-D2 leaves without warning to search for the Jedi. He is caught up by Luke and C-3PO, but they fall into an ambush by Tusken Raiders. They are saved at the last moment by Kenobi, who takes them to his home.

Darth Vader brings Leia Organa back to the Death Star, where she is imprisoned. Since the Imperial Senate was dissolved shortly before by the Emperor, she no longer enjoys the protection afforded to senators. Grand Moff Tarkin interrogates the princess, wanting to know the Rebel Alliance&#x27;s headquarters location. He threatens to open fire on Alderaan, where Leia Organa grew up. She tells him that the Rebel base is on Dantooine. Despite this, Tarkin orders the planet&#x27;s destruction before her eyes.

On Tatooine, Luke learns that his father was a Jedi Knight; Obi-Wan gives him his former apprentice&#x27;s lightsaber. When they return to the Lars farm, they find a massacre; Imperial troops have murdered Luke&#x27;s uncle and aunt. Consequently, he decides to accompany Kenobi and the two droids to Alderaan. In Mos Eisley, they meet Han Solo and Chewbacca, owners of the &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot;. The smugglers are hired to discreetly take them to their destination. However, they are found by stormtroopers, forcing them to leave the planet in haste.

On board the space station, Grand Moff Tarkin learns that there is only an abandoned old base on Dantooine. He tortures the princess to make her confess the truth. At the same time, the &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot; exits hyperspace into an asteroid field. The crew realizes that the planet has been destroyed. They follow TIE fighters heading towards a moon. When they realize it&#x27;s not a moon but the Death Star, it&#x27;s already too late; they are caught in a tractor beam and forced to land. They manage to disguise themselves as stormtroopers and infiltrate the station. They free Princess Leia but must face a powerful enemy: Sith Lord Darth Vader. Obi-Wan Kenobi engages him in combat while the others board the &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot;. The Jedi allows himself to be killed by his former apprentice, allowing the others to escape.

They go to Yavin 4, where the rebel base is located, to deliver the Death Star plans contained within R2-D2. They are analyzed by the Alliance engineers, and the vulnerability is discovered. However, the Empire had placed a tracking beacon on the Falcon when it was still aboard the station. This allows Grand Moff Tarkin and Darth Vader to know the exact position of the rebel headquarters and therefore to send the Death Star to destroy it.

== Battlefield ==

The battle takes place in the orbit of the gas giant planet Yavin, near one of its natural satellites, Yavin 4. It also unfolds around the Death Star, extending into one of its trenches.

== Technologies ==

The Imperial forces consist of the Death Star, a mobile battle station capable of destroying entire planets, equipped with numerous TIE fighters, the Empire&#x27;s primary combat vessel and a symbol of its power. Darth Vader pilots an upgraded version, the TIE Advanced X1, which is faster, more powerful, and tailored to the dimensions of the Sith Lord&#x27;s armor.

The Rebel forces consist of two squadrons. The &quot;Gold Squadron&quot;, commanded by Jon &quot;Dutch&quot; Vander, consists of eight Y-wing interceptors, which are used primarily for bombing missions. It is accompanied by the &quot;Red Squadron&quot;, led by Garven Dreis and composed of eight X-wing interceptors. They are supported by the &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot;, a YT-1300 light freighter piloted by smugglers Han Solo and Chewbacca.

== Course ==
When the Death Star arrives at Yavin, it is not properly positioned to fire on the fourth moon. This allows the rebels to launch an attack to destroy the battle station. Its weakness has been clearly identified: a proton torpedo must be fired into the exhaust port to trigger a chain reaction that will destroy it. For this mission, two squadrons of Y-wing and X-wing interceptors take off. Luke Skywalker, designated as &quot;Red 5,&quot; pilots one of the X-wings accompanied by R2-D2. As they approach the Death Star, a group of TIE fighters intercepts them. The &quot;Red Squadron&quot; engages in combat with them, allowing the Y-wings of the &quot;Gold Squadron&quot; to enter the trench toward the exhaust port.

However, they are destroyed by Darth Vader&#x27;s TIE Advanced X1 fighter. The Sith Lord participates in the battle to protect the station, forcing the X-wings of the &quot;Red Squadron&quot; to enter the trench as well. They are vulnerable there and are each destroyed or damaged in turn. At the end, only Luke Skywalker remains to accomplish the mission. A group of TIE fighters led by Vader pursues him, preparing to fire. He is saved at the last moment by Han Solo and Chewbacca aboard the &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot;, who shoot down one TIE fighter, causing a second one to panic and collide with Vader&#x27;s ship, sending it spinning out of control away from the Death Star. Following the advice of Obi-Wan Kenobi, whose voice he hears, Luke Skywalker deactivates the targeting system of the ship, and using the Force, he fires a proton torpedo that enters the port and destroys the Death Star before it can open fire on Yavin.

== Review ==
The Battle of Yavin is a victory for the Rebel Alliance. They manage to defeat the forces of the Galactic Empire. Practically all Imperial personnel are killed, and almost all of the Empire&#x27;s equipment, including the Death Star, is destroyed. The only survivor is Darth Vader, who participated in the battle; his TIE Advanced X1 fighter was damaged by Han Solo.

On the rebel side, the losses are heavy. In addition to the &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot;, only three ships from the &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Gold&quot; squadrons return, including those piloted by Luke Skywalker and Wedge Antilles. However, the commanders of these two squadrons were shot down during the fighting.

== Consequences ==
Following the loss of the battle station, the Empire initiates the construction of a second Death Star. This one is under construction around the forest moon of Endor and is more than twice the size of the first.

With the rebel headquarters discovered on Yavin 4, they are forced to relocate to another planet. They decide to settle on Hoth, an icy planet located in the Outer Rim.

The Second Death Star is eventually destroyed by the Rebels as well.

== Concept and creation ==

Before the production of the film &quot;A New Hope&quot; even began, George Lucas created sketches of the various spacecraft that would participate in the Battle of Yavin. In November 1974, he hired model maker Colin Cantwell and illustrator Ralph McQuarrie. Cantwell created the initial designs for the Y-wing interceptor and the &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot;, while McQuarrie produced illustrations of key scenes from the film, one of which depicted a group of Y-wing interceptors attacking the Death Star.

Only one full-scale X-wing interceptor model was built, which was visible in the scene preceding the battle in the Rebel hangar on Yavin 4. The space battles were entirely created using mechanical special effects. Only one cockpit was constructed, and the actors portraying the pilots took turns sitting in it while the droid behind them was replaced.

Some scenes of the battle were enhanced with digital special effects in the 1997 and 2004 re-releases of the film. For example, the number of rebel ships approaching the Death Star was increased, and the space battle sequences were refined, with the explosions being reworked. The scene depicting the destruction of the battle station was embellished with a circular shockwave.

== Adaptation ==
In addition to its official appearances in novels, novelizations, films, and television series, the Battle of Yavin appears in various other &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe derivative products.

=== Video games ===

The Battle of Yavin is featured in numerous video games. In &quot;Star Wars: Empire at War&quot;, released in 2006 and set between &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot; and &quot;A New Hope&quot;, players can control either the Galactic Empire or the Rebel Alliance. At one point, they find themselves replaying the battle around Yavin while controlling one of these two factions. In &quot;Star Wars: X-Wing&quot;, released in 1993, players embody Luke Skywalker and must destroy the Death Star.

In &quot;Star Wars: Rogue Squadron&quot;, released in 1998, players take on the role of Luke Skywalker and can unlock a secret level allowing them to participate in the Battle of Yavin. This mission is also the first in its sequel, &quot;Star Wars: Rogue Squadron II - Rogue Leader&quot;, released in 2002.

In 2009, the mobile game &quot;Star Wars: Trench Run&quot; was released. Players take on the role of a pilot during combat in the trench of the space station.

The arcade game &quot;Star Wars&quot;, released in 1983, includes several space combat sequences, including one on the surface of the Death Star.

=== Figurines ===
Many action figures depict characters from the Battle of Yavin. For instance, in 2012, Hasbro released action figures featuring certain pilots from the &quot;Red Squadron&quot; and the Empire. In 2004 and 2005, action figures depicting Wedge Antilles, General Jan Dodonna, and Dutch Vander, the leader of the &quot;Gold Squadron,&quot; were also released.

Lego has produced spherical figurines of various planets and moons, with the Yavin 4 figurine released in 2012 as set number 9677, titled &quot;X-wing Starfighter &amp; Yavin 4.&quot; It comes with a figurine of Luke Skywalker and the X-wing interceptor he pilots during the battle.

=== Amusement parks ===
A segment of the &quot;Star Tours&quot; attraction is inspired by the Battle of Yavin. Visitors board a Starspeeder 3000, an intergalactic transport ship bound for the moon of Endor. At one point, the transport joins a group of Rebel fighters and takes part in the assault against the third Death Star. This attraction, no longer in existence, was replaced by &quot;Star Tours: The Adventures Continue&quot;. It was present in Disneyland Resort and Walt Disney World Resort in the United States until 2010, at Tokyo Disney Resort in Japan until 2012, and at Disneyland Paris in France until 2016.

== Reception ==
The website Screen Rant ranks the Battle of Yavin in third place in its list of the best battles from the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy. The site finds that &quot;everything about this battle is superb,&quot; particularly praising the mechanical special effects and the scene where Han Solo saves Luke Skywalker. In its ranking of the entire saga, the same website places it in the first position, explaining that it is the sequence with the most tension. Similarly, the website PubSquare Media also ranks the Battle of Yavin in the first position. However, the website Looper only ranks it in fifth place, as it considers it to be a small battle between two Rebel squadrons and a few Imperial fighters.

== Posterity ==

=== In the culture ===
Several fans have attempted to calculate the number of casualties resulting from the explosion of the Death Star at the end of the Battle of Yavin. The figures vary as sources do not always provide the same number of people on board. Estimates suggest it to be around one million.

On YouTube, a channel imagined what the Death Star&#x27;s laser light would look like if it existed in reality. In the video, the laser light is not green but transparent, making it invisible. It is also depicted as capable of quickly changing targets, rendering it more dangerous than in the fictional universe. Another channel recreated the trench run scene using animated Lego figurines. The creators took some liberties, including the presence of ships that would not normally be there.

In a spoof of 9/11 conspiracy theories, some fans have made tongue-in-cheek speculations that the Death Star&#x27;s destruction was actually deliberately caused, or at least allowed to happen, by the Galactic Empire itself, rather than as the result of the Rebel assault.

&quot;The Simpsons&quot; animated series has parodied the Battle of Yavin on several occasions. In the episode &quot;My Sister, My Sitter&quot; from Season 8, Bart hears his dance teacher&#x27;s voice in his head advising him to use dance in the same way Obi-Wan Kenobi advises Luke Skywalker to use the Force before destroying the Death Star. Similarly, in the episode &quot;Pygmoelian&quot; from Season 11, Patty says to Selma, &quot;&quot;The bitterness is strong in this one&quot;,&quot; referencing Darth Vader&#x27;s line, &quot;&quot;The Force is strong in this one&quot;,&quot; from the trench run scene. Additionally, a reference to the battle appears in comic book number 45 released in October 1999. The family&#x27;s dog, Santa&#x27;s Little Helper, appears in a commercial for the Krusty Burger chain wearing Biggs Darklighter&#x27;s X-wing helmet, who was a childhood friend of Luke Skywalker and a member of the &quot;Red Squadron&quot;.

=== Star Wars timeline reference point ===
The Battle of Yavin serves as the reference point for the Star Wars timeline. Events are dated in relation to it using 365-day years. For example, the Battle of Geonosis, which marks the start of the Clone Wars, takes place in 22 BBY, while the Battle of Endor, which marks the end of the Galactic Civil War, takes place in 4 ABY.

The book &quot;Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: The Visual Guide&quot;, released in 2019, uses another reference point: the Battle of Starkiller Base depicted in &quot;The Force Awakens&quot; (2015).

<doc id="319860" wikidata="Q1539197" url="?curid=319860" title="Uechi-Ryū">
<text>is a traditional style of Okinawan karate. Uechi-Ryū means &quot;Style of Uechi&quot; or &quot;School of Uechi&quot;. Originally called Pangai-noon, which translates to English as &quot;half-hard, half-soft&quot;, the style was renamed Uechi-Ryū after the founder of the style, Kanbun Uechi, an Okinawan who went to Fuzhou in Fujian Province, China to study martial arts and Chinese medicine when he was 19 years old.

After his death, in 1948, the style was refined, expanded, and popularized by his son, Kanei Uechi.

== Early history ==

Kanbun Uechi studied Southern Chinese kung fu and later would refer to the style as Pangai-noon (traditional Chinese characters: ) meaning &quot;half-hard, half-soft&quot;. In the late 19th century and early 20th century Kanbun Uechi trained under a teacher and Chinese medicine hawker known in Japanese as Shū Shiwa (Chinese: &quot;Zhou Zihe&quot; 1874–1926). Shū Shiwa/Zhou Zihe&#x27;s life is not well documented. Some have suspected without conclusive evidence that he had connection with the secret societies which worked for the overthrow of the Qing dynasty and the restoration of Ming dynasty. Research by the Fuzhou Wushu Association reported in 1984 revealed that he was born in the Zhitian Village (直田村) in 1874 to family wealthy enough to have him educated in letters and fighting arts which included weapons and Tiger Fist Kung Fu or Huzunquan (虎尊拳, Fujian Tiger Boxing).
The exact provenance of the romanization &quot;Pangai-noon&quot; is not clear, and it may be from the lesser-known Min Chinese language. It is not a Japanese, Okinawan, nor Mandarin Chinese pronunciation of the original characters. The standard Japanese pronunciation of the three characters is &quot;han kō nan&quot; (はんこうなん), while the standard Mandarin pronunciation is bàn yìng ruǎn. The Cantonese language pronunciation is &quot;bun ngaang yun&quot;. In modern times, the &quot;katakana&quot; version of &quot;pangainoon&quot; (パンガイヌーン・&quot;pangainūn&quot;) has been used in Japanese writing rather than the &quot;kanji&quot; (半硬軟). While the Fuzhou Wushu Association confirmed the meaning of &quot;half-hard, half-soft&quot; in interviews in 2012, in 1934, Kanbun Uechi explained to Kenwa Mabuni when asked about the meaning of &quot;Pangai-noon&quot; that it referred to the rapid speed of the &quot;kata&quot;.

After studying about 10 years under Shū Shiwa/Zhou Zihe, Kanbun Uechi opened his own school in Nanjing in 1906, and he continued periodic training under Zhou Zihe for a total of 13 years. Three years later, Kanbun Uechi returned to Okinawa, determined never to teach again because reportedly one of his Chinese students had killed a neighbor with an open-hand technique in a dispute over land irrigation.

While in Okinawa, Kanbun Uechi did not teach his martial art. In 1912, a tea merchant and White Crane Kung Fu master Go Kenki (Wú Xiánguì) who knew him settled in Okinawa. As word spread from Go Kenki that Kanbun Uechi was a skilled martial arts teacher, he received requests to teach but refused.

Due to the economic situation in Okinawa, in 1924, at the age of 47, Kanbun Uechi left for Wakayama City, Wakayama Prefecture, Japan to find employment. While he was working as a security guard for a local cotton spinning mill, he was persuaded by a co-worker, Ryuyu Tomoyose, to teach him privately. After two years of private lessons, Ryuyu Tomoyose and about 30 other men interested in learning convinced Kanbun Uechi to resume teaching. He taught in small rooms in the company dormitory before work, during lunchtime, and after work until 1932 when he opened a general store and the &quot;Pangai-noon Ryu Karate Academy&quot; (半硬軟流唐手術) to the general public. In 1940, he and his students, including his son Kanei, renamed the system &quot;Uechi-Ryū Karate-Jutsu&quot; (上地流空手術) in his honor.

Kanbun Uechi&#x27;s son, Kanei Uechi, taught the style at the Futenma City Dojo, Okinawa, and was considered the first Okinawan to sanction teaching foreigners. One of Kanei&#x27;s students, Ryuko Tomoyose, son of Ryuyu Tomoyose, taught a young American serviceman named George Mattson who authored several books on the subject and is largely responsible for popularizing the style in America. Uechi-Ryū emphasizes toughness of body with quick blows and kicks. Some of the more distinctive weapons of Uechi practitioners are the one-knuckle punch , spearhand , and the front kick delivered with the first toe (&quot;sokusen geri&quot;). On account of this emphasis on simplicity, stability, and a combination of linear and circular movements, proponents claim the style is more practical for self-defense than most other martial arts.

In contrast to the more linear styles of karate based on Okinawan Shuri te or Tomari-te, Uechi-Ryū&#x27;s connection with Chinese Shorin-ken means the former shares a similar foundation with Naha-te (and thus with Gōjū-Ryū) despite their separate development. Thus, Uechi-Ryū is also heavily influenced by the circular motions which belong to the kung fu from Fujian province. Uechi-Ryū is principally based on the movements of three animals: the Tiger, the Dragon, and the Crane.

== Kata ==
There are eight empty-hand &quot;kata&quot;s in Uechi-Ryū. Only Sanchin, Seisan, and Sanseiryū come from Pangai-noon; the others were designed and added to the style by Kanei Uechi and other senior students of Kanbun. Many of the names of the newer &quot;kata&quot; were formed from the names of prominent figures in the art, e.g. Kanshiwa from &quot;Kanbun&quot; and Zhou Zihe&#x27;s Japanese pronunciation of his name: &quot;Shu Shiwa&quot;. The &quot;kata&quot; are:

# Sanchin
# Kanshiwa
# Kanshū
# Seichin
# Seisan
# Seiryū
# Kanchin
# Sanseiryū

&quot;Sanchin kata&quot; is deceptively simple in appearance. It teaches the foundation of the style, including stances and breathing. Kanbun Uechi is quoted as saying, &quot;All is in Sanchin.&quot;

# : Literally translated as &quot;three fights/conflicts&quot;. From the &quot;kanji&quot; and . Usually interpreted as three Modes/Conflicts: &quot;Mind, Body and Spirit.&quot;
# : A combination of the first &quot;kanji&quot; in Kanbun&#x27;s name, and the last two &quot;kanji&quot; written in Chinese order of Shu Shiwa&#x27;s name in Japanese pronunciation. Originally known as &quot;Kanshabu&quot; based on earlier mistranslation of Zhou Zihe&#x27;s name into Japanese as &quot;Shu Shabu.&quot; Created by Saburo Uehara in 1956.
# : A combination of the first &quot;kanji&quot; in Kanbun&#x27;s name, and the &quot;kanji&quot; for Shu Shiwa&#x27;s family name (Shu) [see previous note on pronunciation]. Originally known as or &quot;Second &quot;Seisan&quot;,&quot; it was created by Seiki Itokazu in the 1956.
# : Literally translated: &quot;10 fights/conflicts,&quot; or a combination of the names of &quot;Seisan&quot; and &quot;Sanchin&quot;. Created by Saburo Uehara in the 1950s.
# : Literally translated: &quot;13.&quot; Usually interpreted as &quot;Thirteen modes of attack and defense&quot; or &quot;13 positions to attack/defend from&quot;.)
# Seiryū (十六): Literally translated: &quot;16.&quot; Created by Kanei Uechi in 1950.
# : A combination of Kanbun&#x27;s first &quot;kanji&quot; 完 and &quot;fight&quot; 戦. Created by Kanei Uechi in the 1950s.
# Sanseiryū (三十六): The &quot;kanji&quot; was originally pronounced &quot;Sandairyū,&quot; literally translated: &quot;36.&quot; Sometimes interpreted as &quot;thirty-six modes of attack and defense&quot; or &quot;36 positions to attack/defend from.&quot; While apocryphal, the 1977 &quot;Uechi-Ryū Kihon&quot; (Techniques Book) claims Shu Shiwa was also known as &quot;The 36th Room Priest&quot; to suggest the interpretation of the name as the &quot;36th Room &quot;Kata&quot;&quot; made from techniques taught individually in the previous 35 rooms.

== Ranks ==
These are the ten beginner or &quot;Kyū&quot; ranks, which in traditional practice count down from 10 to 1. The white, green, and brown belts are standard. Different schools in the same organization may have different designations of the intermediate ranks, such as different belt colors and stripes:

# 10º Jukyū (White Belt)
# 9º Kyukyū (White Belt w/1 Green Stripe; Yellow Belt)
# 8º Hachikyū (White Belt w/2 Green Stripes; Gold Belt)
# 7º Shichikyū (White Belt w/3 Green Stripes; Blue Belt)
# 6º Rokkyū (White Belt w/Solid Green Bar; Green Belt)
# 5º Gokyū (Green Belt w/no stripe; Green Belt w/1 Stripe)
# 4º Yonkyū (Green Belt w/1 Brown Stripe; Green Belt w/2 Stripes)
# 3º Sankyū (Brown Belt w/1 Black Stripe)
# 2º Nikyū (Brown Belt w/2 Black Stripes)
# 1º Ikkyū (Brown Belt w/3 Black Stripes)

These are the ten black belt or &quot;Dan&quot; grades:

# Shodan (1st degree | Regular Black belt)
# Nidan (2nd degree)
# Sandan (3rd degree)
# Yondan (4th degree)
# Godan (5th degree)
# Rokudan (6th degree) (Master&#x27;s title: &quot;Renshi&quot;; Black belt w/1 Gold stripe)
# Nanadan (7th degree) (Master&#x27;s title: &quot;Kyōshi&quot;; Black belt w/2 Gold stripes)
# Hachidan (8th degree) (Master&#x27;s title: &quot;Kyōshi&quot;; Black belt w/3 Gold stripes)
# Kyūdan (9th degree) (Master&#x27;s title: &quot;Hanshi&quot;; Black belt w/4 Gold stripes)
# Jūdan (10th degree) (Master&#x27;s title: &quot;Hanshi&quot;; Black belt w/5 Gold stripes)

Originally, Okinawan styles use the gold bars on black belts to denote the various masters titles rather than ranks after fifth &quot;dan&quot;. Thus one gold stripe designated , two designated , and three designated . In the early 2000s, different Okinawan styles started using the stripes to designate &quot;dan&quot; grades above &quot;godan&quot;. Others, including many Uechi organizations, have followed suit, while others have not.

== Additional training elements ==
Kanei Uechi, besides adding &quot;kata&quot;, also introduced a sequence of exercises to the Uechi-Ryū training regimen. The are warm-up and stretching exercises based on Asian school training exercises. The are standardized exercises that incorporate elements of all of the &quot;katas&quot; of the system as well as additional techniques.

The &quot;junbi undō&quot; exercises are:

# (&quot;heel pivot&quot;)
# (&quot;heel lift&quot;)
# (&quot;foot and ankle rotation&quot;)
# (&quot;knee circular bend&quot;)
# (&quot;leg lift and turn&quot;)
# (&quot;straight leg lift&quot;)
# (&quot;waist scoop and twisting&quot;)
# (&quot;trunk stretch&quot;)
# (&quot;double arm strikes&quot;)
# (&quot;neck rotation&quot;)

The &quot;hojo undō&quot; exercises are:

# (&quot;Front kick&quot;)
# (&quot;Side kick&quot;)
# (&quot;Closed Fist Punch&quot;)
# (&quot;Hook Punch&quot;)
# (&quot;Tiger paw blocks and strike&quot;)
# (&quot;Chop, Back-fist, One-knuckle punch&quot;)
# (&quot;Elbow strikes&quot;)
# (&quot;Turn-Block-Front Kick-Forward Leg&quot;)
# (&quot;Turn-Block-Front Kick-Back Leg&quot;)
# (&quot;Turn-Block-One Knuckle Punch&quot;)
# (&quot;fingertip strikes&quot;), also called (&quot;front fingertip strikes&quot;)
# (&quot;wrist blocks/strikes in four directions&quot;)
# (&quot;Fish-tail wrist blocks/strikes&quot;)
# (&quot;Deep breathing&quot;)

Uechi-Ryū developed a sets of pre-arranged sparring exercises referred to as . Individual organizations and &quot;dōjō&quot; have developed their own. They involve two partners exchanging a formal sequence of blocks and strikes. There are five to eleven of these exercises, and each one involves three to six exchanges of single blocks and strikes. The kumite exercises involve blocks and strikes that are, for the most part, also found in Uechi-Ryū &quot;kata&quot;. Thus, like &quot;kata no bunkai&quot;, these exercises help students become familiar with the application of Uechi-Ryū techniques. Typically, the highest &quot;kyu&quot; ranks are expected to be able to move through these exercises with great strength and fluidity. &quot;Dan&quot; level students practice additional pre-arranged sparring exercises.

Applications of &quot;kata&quot; are also practiced in a pre-arranged format. These patterns are called . &quot;Kanshiwa Bunkai&quot; and &quot;Seisan Bunkai&quot; date to the time of Kanei Uechi. Individual &quot;dōjō&quot; may create other &quot;bunkai&quot; for the other &quot;katas&quot;, such as &quot;Kanshu&quot; and &quot;Seichin&quot;, and these will vary in format more from &quot;dōjō&quot; to &quot;dōjō&quot;. &quot;Okikukai&quot; – 沖空会 (&quot;Okinawan Karate-Dō Association&quot; 沖縄空手道協会) from the late 1990s to early 2000s developed a &quot;San Sei Ryū Bunkai&quot;. Videos made during this time as well as a book, and later DVD document how the sequence developed over time. Interestingly, a recent project headed by the Okinawan government involving many Uechi groups in Okinawa to publish a manual with a DVD for the style has non-&quot;Okikukai&quot; members demonstrate a form of the &quot;bunkai&quot; that has some slight variations from the current &quot;Okikukai&quot; version.

Special forms of strength training and body conditioning are generally practiced in Uechi-Ryū drilling. A formal Uechi-Ryū forearm conditioning exercise, called , or &quot;forearm tempering,&quot; involves variations of striking a partner&#x27;s forearms with ones fists and forearms. Kanbun Uechi learned this conditioning exercise in China. Similar exercises involve conditioning the legs , or &quot;leg tempering.&quot; Uechi-Ryū also trains with &quot;makiwara&quot;, as well as incorporates other traditional Okinawan physical conditioning exercises as part of their training, such as plunging hands into baskets full of rocks, or performing &quot;Sanchin kata&quot; stepping while gripping (heavy ceramic jars).

== Uechi-Ryū today ==
Like many arts, Uechi-Ryū experienced organizational splits after its founder&#x27;s death. Nevertheless, in 2018 as part of its Okinawan Karate Style Research Project, the Okinawan government brought together seniors from some of the main organizations, which include the Okinawan Karate-Dō Association (沖縄手道協会), Kenyukai (拳優会), Konan Ryū Shureikai (硬軟流守礼会), and the Uechi-Ryū Karate-Dō Association (上地流空手道協会).

Pangai-noon
In 1978 a group of Uechi-Ryū students headed by Seiki Itokazu and Takashi Kinjo broke away from the Ryū due to political disagreements and the desire to teach &quot;kobudō&quot; in their &quot;dōjō&quot;, and they adopted the style name &quot;Pangainoon Ryū&quot;. By the early 1990s Itokazu and Kinjo had renamed this breakaway style &quot;Konan Ryū&quot;. In the 2000s Kinjo and his students began using the style name &quot;Kobu Ryū&quot;, however one of Kinjo&#x27;s students, Mikio Nishiuchi, reverted to using the style name &quot;Pang Gai Noon Ryū&quot;. This name has also been used by later groups over the years who have practiced the additional &quot;kata&quot; and exercises. All extant organizations are either former Uechi-Ryū organizations or schools that chose to use the old name, or current Uechi-Ryū schools which wish to give homage to the old name. In 2019 the Okinawa Konan Ryu Karate Dō Association (沖縄硬軟流空手道協会): Seiki Itokazu and currently headed by Seisho Itokazu, changed the name of the association to Uechi-Ryū Karate-do Konan-kai (沖縄上地流空手道硬軟会).

Shōhei-Ryū
After the death of the founder&#x27;s son, Kanei Uechi, most of the senior practitioners of the original art split for political and personal reasons from his son Kanmei Uechi to form the Okinawa Karate-Dō Association (沖縄手道協会). Barred by Kanmei Uechi from using his family name, the Okinawan Karate Dō Association eventually decided to rename its system which combined the Late Emperor Hirohito&#x27;s reign name &quot;Shōwa&quot; and his son Emperor Akihito&#x27;s &quot;Heisei&quot; to mean &quot;to shine brightly with fairness, equality, and peace.&quot; The Okinawan Karate Dō Association added a new two-man prearranged exercise and an application or form for the third original &quot;kata&quot;: &quot;Sanseiryū bunkai&quot;. One teacher developed an additional &quot;kata&quot; which was deemed by the Okinawan Karate Dō Association to be a &quot;kata&quot; for his school. With the name &quot;Uechi-Ryū&quot; passing out of copyright in Okinawa, an easing of political and personal disagreements, and a desire to promote the style in anticipation of the 2020 Summer Olympics, on September 18, 2016, the Okinawa Karate-Dō Association officially dropped &quot;Shōhei-Ryū&quot; and returned to the name &quot;Uechi-Ryū.&quot;
